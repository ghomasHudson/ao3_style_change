"I could have been!" Malfoy retorts, shaking the swimsuit at Harry. "I ought to go right back to bed. Fuck your plans."
"It was more a wine and h'ordeuvres situation," Draco murmurs at the floorboards, gathering himself to get back to his feet. He can't even begin to address the rest of what Harry's said, between being called
Ron yanks off the gloves and whisks his wand over them, shrinking them down to something more like Hermione's size. "Here you are, then, a custom fit."
"I mean—" Malfoy seems to frown at his own nose, blinking so fast Harry worries, for a moment, that something's wrong physically. "My god, Potter, I'm only joking. No need for your gay panic." He takes a sharp turn of his heel and marches off, his whole body stiff with offense.
"I know, I'm a fool." Harry presses his lips to Draco's high forehead, then to Draco's own mouth. They spend a few more minutes at the door simply caressing each other with lips and hands, chaste but full of meaning, before Draco shivers in the chill of the October morning air.
Draco doesn't think he should say anything, this time, and he twines his fingers together to keep them quiet.
"Oh, come here, you sensitive loon," Harry says with another low chuckle. "I haven't made all this food just to have it sit because you got a bit stroppy."
"Draco, why did you leave?" Harry crosses the small distance to take a careful seat on the bench. "Did Charlie do something to offend you?" He bites his lip, frown deepening. "Did—did I? Have I made you angry?"
"You're unbelievable," Hermione mutters, but she accepts the gloves and shimmies past Ron to take his place.
It feels as though all of wizarding London is here, packed into one room doing its best to accommodate them all. And though they're not
"Yes, your husband," Hermione huffs, pointing at Draco where he's been watching from a distance. "Why haven't you come home, if you were this close, Harry?"
Draco wishes, he really does, that he wasn't so insecure, that he could just take Harry's affection as it comes and enjoy it for what it is. He should already feel more special than he deserves just for Harry kissing him when asked. Dr. Fiddlewood would remind him not for the first or last time, that
Draco doesn't remember what her reaction is. He's standing in front of a bed where a restrained wizard is sleeping fitfully; even in dreams, Venari Virtute's victims try to cast the spell, his hand shaking with half-formed wand movements, his lips chapped with sleep-mumbled incantations. The wizard's name is Harper Littletree, according to the orderly. Harry puts a hand on Draco's shoulder. The orderly puts a bottle in his free hand, and Draco looks at both the bottle and the orderly curiously.
There's an option to stay after dinner, but most aren't taking it, between the lateness of the hour and the fullness of their bellies. Harry orders drinks for Draco and himself while they watch guests trickle out of the Great Hall. Draco is horrified as he watches the server peel off, until the server returns with a gin and tonic for Harry, and a mock Negroni for Draco. "See, now you
"Well." Draco's hands immediately enmesh themselves, fingers tapping against the backs of his hands. "Can't let you have all the fun. I haven't gotten to do any shouting today, and I wouldn't be a Malfoy if I wasn't a covetous little prig."
"Fine, then, you got me. I can't plan worth a damn." Harry grabs Malfoy by the wrist, snapping him close as he steps forward, and Apparates.
He finds he suddenly can't go in the kitchen anymore. Draco looks at the table and his body seizes up, pain blossoming in all the places it remembers Griselda opening him up. Another one of Dr. Fiddlewood's ghosts that lives in the manor, keeping him from yet another part of his childhood home.
So of course he adds a black leather bodice, worn over the dress in the space between the bottom of his minimal pecs and his natural waist. Of course he adds straps, crossed in the back and wide-set in the front, to make sure his nipples will never be blocked. After all, he's already committed to flaunting them. (By the croquis hips, he adds
Dinner goes as smoothly as any event with so many big personalities can go. Pansy holding a conversation with Molly at the opposite end of the table makes Draco absolutely tense, as does Blaise talking to Neville at the other table, but Harry squeezes Draco's thigh under the table and points out that nobody is shouting, or making faces. In fact, Blaise and Neville are talking about plants, while Molly and Pansy are having a barely veiled conversation about Pansy's attempts to conceive with her wife. The kids don't seem to be listening, at least, for which Draco is grateful. Rose seems to think the way she checks her mobile under the table top is surreptitious, and Hugo is monologuing to Lily about the Weasley family tree, not bothering to clear his mouth of food before he talks.
"I," Draco says, "promise I will do my absolute best not to give you any new reasons to kill me. Truly."
"I'm sorry," Draco says, quickly before Harry can cut him off again. It's surprisingly easy to gather Harry's hands in his own, easier still to thumb at the tears pooling in Harry's shining eyes. "I am."
. Then spends several shameful minutes imagining what it might have actually been like, followed by hours of flipping between berating himself and insisting it didn't mean anything because it was just a thought. Just a long, extended thought about someone with no redeeming qualities except for his dry humor, his desire to be better, his long legs—
"Of course I did," Draco interrupts. "That was never in question. You look lovely, by the way." He gestures at Hermione's gown. "Who made this for you?"
Harry plunges his hand into his bag and pulls out a pair of swim trunks he conjured last night. "Swimming. We're going swimming."
"Then don't plan on wearing it as I fit you," Draco says. "Now, again, where am I going that isn't the bloody hall, and this time, where might I hang up my cape?"
"You should have owled. I would have made tea." Draco doesn't know what he's saying. He thinks he might be joking. With Potter.
"It's okay to cry," Pansy tells Draco, squeezing his hand as he returns from being the first to pour a shovelful of dirt into the grave hole; public opinion is apparently that Harry Potter deserves to have a mausoleum all his own, but even if Harry were truly dead, Draco knows he'd hate that. So he has a tombstone, like anyone else.
The organza sleeves fall in slow, soft motion as Harry stops cold, deflating. "Did you not actually want to be my date, then? Am I that stupid?"
"Is that what that feels like?" Malfoy murmurs, getting ahead of Harry. Predictably, he makes a wrong step and falls, yet again, skidding down the mountain on his bottom. "These new soles do nothing!"
"Why don't we continue this in the kitchen?" Granger says, gesturing down the hall. Draco waits until they've both begun walking before following them, his nerves whistling as he looks around. Everything is sort of packed together and shabby, yet each oddment looks as though it was always meant to be where it is, crowding the Burrow with a warm sense of being thoroughly lived in. It is nothing like the manor.
Harry pauses, two massive forks dug into a deep bowl of salad. He wrinkles his nose. "Is that what I said?"
Harry snorts. "Whatever you want it to be. Now look," he says, tugging at Draco's sleeve as he arranges himself cross-legged on the blanket. "I've made a fucking charcuterie and cheese board from Waitrose, so I want you to look at it, acknowledge it, appreciate it."
"Apologies, it's the aforementioned fashion brain rot. But yes, you're right, some swotty little git who thought Gilderoy Lockhart was the real deal when we were children is no good for your image."
"You move like treacle in January. You'd think anything is 'moving fast'." Harry looks at Draco from the sides of his eyes. "You're saying you don't want to come to Grimmauld? You want to drag yourself back to your flat in Battersea?"
"Who—?" Draco's question is answered the moment Pansy and her enormous dress move off the bench. Harry stands in the courtyard entrance, tugging urgently at the sleeves of his golden linen robe.
"It's funny, actually," Potter begins, and the thunder is in Draco's head, now, growing into a full blown storm of wishing himself mute. "But this isn't too far off from how we first met, is it?"
lock; everything she says sounds like scripted ad copy, and not by a particularly talented copywriter, either. She'd glittered so beautifully in her Malfoy Couture, though, so he's never told her he finds her stilted and corny to her face.
"My face is like stone," Draco sniffs, knowing he hasn't been able to control his expressions or blushing in a lifetime of trying. His sixth year machinations had been, more than anything else, about keeping away from everyone. And even then, Potter had seen it in his face.
At last, Draco takes slow steps around Potter until he stands in front of him. This time when their eyes meet, there is no bashful looking away from either man. Potter bites his lip, and Draco's eyes drift down to begin work pinning the collar.
a fucking idiot," Draco mutters, and Potter laughs. For the first time, Potter laughs—not a chuckle, not a snicker—full-throatedly at something Draco's said, and it makes him feel so frustratingly warm.
. "Tell me, Draco, should I make this personal for you? Or would a run of the mill grisly death work for you?"
Their kiss doesn't last, given that they're treading water in a part of the lake where their feet can't find the floor; the imbalance makes their teeth clack together, hard enough for Harry to exclaim a short "Ow!" Malfoy is quick to be mortified, but Harry takes a chance and rests his hands on both of Malfoy's shoulders, laughing as he puts his forehead to the other man's. It isn't long before Malfoy is laughing, too.
thank you, as usual, to spacehubsands and Saphira for an excellent beta, and thank you to @donnarafiki for helping me to unstick a particularly sticky bit of dialogue! also as per usual i could not have done this without the britpicking channel in the server; i know i ask a lot of questions and here's hoping this fic proves they're worth it!
Luna's arrival to the conversation is the tipping point for the guests surrounding their little group.
you are!" she says, with a particularly vicious saw at the vines. "But yes, we didn't tell you when we got started for a reason."
Draco mumbles to himself whenever he finds himself imagining Harry catching on. But he misses Harry's laugh.
"Williamson's always been more suited, they just wanted the glamour of my name, I think." Harry leans into Draco, a silent request to be embraced, and Draco gives it to him. "He won't need training."
Harry resolves to put the whole incident out of his mind, from Malfoy's unnerving candidness, to the sight of Malfoy's nearly-naked body, and enjoy his swim.
Draco reminds Potter, as they finish eating several minutes later, that the fitting is not optional—he wasn't kidding. While Potter cleans up in the kitchen, Draco heads upstairs, back to his satchel. And to the robe Potter discarded, in the wrong color and without embellishment.
He fills the album end to end, packing in not just photos but old owled letters from when they were bothering each other in Connemara, from when they had started courting each other outside of the fantasy world of hols—here's the one where Harry had asked Draco to move in with a simple, short sentence, the imprint of a key folded into the parchment still there after all these years. He puts in the long letter Hermione had owled him detailing all her reservations about the relationship, warning Draco of all the ways she'd make him feel pain if he was being insincere or otherwise awful, but ultimately offering her blessing, with Ron's signature at the bottom for an easy cosign. Draco almost thinks of taking it out when he realizes he's reached the end of the album and has some more photos he'd like to put in still, but Hermione's (and Ron's) letter feels too important to the cause the album is to serve.
"I can't believe the sun's down and I'm still here," Draco says with a sigh, much later. He was right in that the new ensemble is nearly a perfect fit, but
Draco's hand slips as Harry says it, and all his parchment bursts from the top of the bag, scattering across one corner of the room. "Sorry?" Draco stammers.
Hermione reads the list of the dead, a macabre and somber tradition held over from the first anniversary celebration of the end of the war, as Harry tells him. (It was not a Gala, not then.) Hermione gives a rousing speech about peace, and rooting out evil before it can sprout. She talks about the hope the next generation gives her, watching her children and their friends. "Bigotry is the seed," she says, "and our children will not water it."
The "perfectly functional atelier" still sees plenty of use. Client requests for jackets and robes for the Gala have ramped up, and while they're not as intensive as the full ensembles Draco had been working on, they still take a good deal of time. Atelier Malfoy begins declining all requests, with all five couturiers full up on work.
Potter's contemplative silence is maddening. His eyes flick over the sketch over and over again, as if a man wearing a terrycloth bathrobe and baggy sweatpants has got any valuable criticism to offer. But this isn't a part of the process Draco will rush, even with the most annoying client, so he holds his tongue. (He succeeds, this time.)
"Now, you can't blame that one on me," Harry laughs. "You've been indecent since you put it on." A hand slides up Draco's body, rubbing across a nipple through the scant layers of Draco's dress.
"So you expected to speak to my parents?" Weasley asks. When Granger approaches the table, he jumps back up, and pulls a chair out for his wife, who gives him a smile accompanied by a wrinkled nose. "And you thought they'd just tell you where we lived, so you could come bother us in our proper home rather than send an owl like anyone else?"
Looking at this design, Draco feels an elation that the dragon suit never gave him. This is a thing of beauty. Moreover, it's personal to Potter, so much more intentionally so than adding dragon ridges before remembering Norbert the dragon. And even more than that—
"He knows what that means," Hermione says to Draco in a conspiratorial voice, to which Draco says nothing because he wants well out of it.
Even with Potter's dark complexion, Draco knows he's blushing. "Trust you to put it like that," Potter mutters, and Draco rolls his eyes. All the strange intimacy from just a few minutes ago was probably just a product of the two of them being silent for once.
"What better way to make time for my lifelong obsession?" he drawls, straightening the back of his shirt. It rumpled and rode up when he fell out of his chair. Speaking of which, Draco beckons the chair back toward his desk with a wordless
Three hours into the party, Harry's angry voice slices through the party, and a stunned hush falls across the room. Draco doesn't know what Seamus Finnegan's said to set Harry off, but he looks blanched with surprise, holding up his hands placatingly. "I didn't mean—" Seamus is saying when Draco pushes his way over.
grateful for how the firelight hides his reddening skin. "I think it would be a shame for you not to go," he says, quietly. "When you look so good."
"Fine, don't say thanks for all the trouble I've gone to," Harry says, but there's no venom to it. "What about this?"
Cold. Draco doesn't realize how long he and Potter have been standing in this field until he shivers, despite his cloak—he'd only meant for a stroll, the movement of his body keeping him warmed up, and hadn't dressed warmly beneath the cloak.
But the outer robe. Upon the black silk organza robe, Draco has embroidered and beaded the entire Northern sky's constellations. From Pisces to Virgo, from Orion to Ophiuchus, no constellation has been left out. Every star is a golden pearl connected to the next by a shimmering stripe of golden silk. Along the hem and around the collar, tiny golden stags chase ribbon-stitched suns, kicking up their silk heels and lowering their gleaming antlers every so often. Around the robe is a sparkling golden cloud, for all the stars in the spaces between each constellation.
"Damn, the trousers," Draco says, snapping his fingers as he sighs. Where his pinning on the robes consisted of minor adjustments here and there, he has to admit the trousers are not his best patterning. He darts back to his satchel to grab his pincushion again. "Hold still, Potter, it turns out your inseam isn't safe after all."
"Oh, uh..." Harry scrunches his nose in sudden concentration. "The cheese is..." He touches the different items as he names them; a soft sheep milk cheese, mild and pungent, next to a heady goat's cheese that looks zesty and crumbly. Thin ribbons of prosciutto, hearty slices of soppressata, a modest helping of Iberico ham that does, in fact, have Draco nodding in appreciation. Harry hasn't laid the board out neatly, and Draco picks up a black olive that's rolled off onto the blanket before flicking it out into the field. Some bird is going to love that little salt bomb.
, and takes a smooth seat as it approaches. "Shall we continue our previous task, my most beloved business partner?"
"Just something I picked up this morning," he says, returning his gaze to his patterning. "It's really nothing."
Yes. Yes, Draco is proud to bring this one to Potter. He leaves it to dry a bit more on the table, notes that it's far past his bedtime as well as dinnertime thanks to his engrossment in sketching, and takes himself to bed. The anticipation feels almost like Christmas Eve, urging his brain to let him sleep even as it buzzes with all the ways he can imagine Potter appreciating the beautiful thing Draco is bringing him.
"What a prude you've grown up to be, Pans." He sighs, though, because maybe-Harry-Potter is probably the one client he really shouldn't show his nipples to on a first outing. He slings away his cape with a practiced gesture, and summons a black silk poplin shirt with a dramatic pointed collar, said collar decorated with tonal embroidery of bats. "Better?" he asks, once he's nearly done buttoning up the new shirt; despite her stated feelings about his nipples, she doesn't even blink as he changes in front of her. Frequently topless models in the atelier have inured them both to most nudity.
"You just want me to stop wearing so many sheer tops," he sniffs, as if he hadn't asked her opinion in the first place.
"You don't like it," Draco says, panic only making his dizziness worse. "You don't have to wear it! You have an entire other completed ensemble to wear! I'll take this one home and make a bonfire, you can come by if you promise to cook—"
cowardice, but she'd forgotten, he supposes, that asking a coward to confront anything is a contradiction. He takes his seat in the front row as his mother takes the podium by the gleaming silver casket, and cannot see his jilted friends anymore.
And because the Ministry can't admit they seem to have misplaced Britain's most famed modern wizard—
"I'm unfit for polite society," Draco continues, despite Pansy's tired look. "Did you see today's Prophet? I'm a Squib now. You can't be seen faffing about with me."
He should have expected Malfoy would be here, too, though the idea of Draco "My father will hear about this" Malfoy deigning to stay in a structure probably no bigger than his wardrobe at Malfoy Manor is mind-boggling.
Auror Potter, bereft now of friends, becomes Head Auror Potter, bereft now of emotion. His new steely personality, if it could be called one, lends itself well to the work. Nothing fazes Head Auror Potter, the department head who won't stay at his desk, and his solve rate is one of the highest the department has ever seen. And if Harry, buried deep inside Head Auror Potter, howls at the barrage of corpses, blood, viscera, the unmistakable stench of the Dark Arts permeating it all—well, Head Auror Potter knows just the cage to stuff him into. It just takes him a moment, sometimes.
"To answer your question," Draco says, rushing his words to override their imminent back-and-forth, "no, I usually face my clients, but you seem ill-inclined to face
"Fourth floor," Potter corrects, already walking away. Draco sees now that he is, in fact, standing at the very top of the stairwell. "Master bath is this way."
"They might be a little angry at you," Draco says, not unreasonably, he doesn't think. "But not at a party."
"Too right I won't." But Harry doesn't push him, hanging back like a sulking teenager. Which, Draco supposes with a sad smirk, he is. He says he's twenty three, but if he woke up an eighteen year old and hasn't seen anyone since, he's probably not much different now than he was five years ago.
Harry chews his lower lip. "It's not the same when you choose to be alone. It's—respite, especially when you know everyone you love, and who loves you back, will be there when you're ready to return."
"Worth it," Harry says with a wicked grin as Malfoy struggles to put the boot down while blinking away the beer threatening to get into his eyes.
. He's on his feet immediately, clutching the most important documents and scribbled notes as he stalks up to Potter's door and reaches for the door knob.
"No, you stink of alcohol and I don't think they have showers on the moon yet," Draco says in return. "How about I just take you to your bed and we'll take our holiday to the moon later?"
"That doesn't seem terribly safe," Potter remarks once he's far enough inside the building, his Disillusionment Charm falling away. Today's fashion choices include a hooded green sweatshirt and another pair of black sweats. They're clearly not a matched set, and Draco doesn't know if that's better or worse. The sweatshirt looks like it's made from particularly thick knit, and Draco frowns, forgetting whatever clever comeback he'd been about to fire off.
if you want to be reformed?" Harry bites back. "You can think of yourself as a better person all you like, it doesn't wash away the harm you've done!" Harry spreads one arm wide as he says
"You know what my answer is. Override her." Draco smooths his hands down his front and approaches one of many full-length mirrors in the atelier. His look is understated, he thinks; just fashionable enough to silently underscore his expertise to a client without intimidating them. The cloak splits at each shoulder, the better to let the front become form-fitting and sleek while the rest of the cape drapes to mid-calf, and the splits reveal the bishop sleeves of his white silk georgette shirt. Pansy thinks he's going to run the trend of sheer shirts into the ground, or so she's said, but in practice she's as onboard as he is. His boots don't quite meet the cropped hems of his slim black trousers, and the boots themselves have high, blocky heels and an angular swordfish toe that gives them interest without being stupid. Yes, this is just the look with which to show Potter he's a professional.
," Potter says, the words sounding as though they've been squeezed out between gritted teeth. "I just—fashion and I have never gotten along. I don't know. Hermione says I should look nice for the Gala, and you're the best in wizarding Britain, so here we both are."
"Measurements?" Potter's manifested another one of those ugly ballpoint pens, this one a bit chewed on the end, but he pauses as he takes the approval form, eyeing the measuring tape nervously.
"No. No, not the price," Potter says. He still won't look up. His breathing seems labored and strange. "It's—it's this! It's all too much! It's—it's fucking invasive and weird, Malfoy!" Potter picks up a corner of silk faille again, shaking it at Draco, and this is when he finally makes eye contact again.
, of course. It's also his first meal of the day, and as soon as he's finished, he drops the dish in the sink and immediately dives back into work.
Draco had assumed, when he'd gone into the master bath, that Potter had likewise gone into the master suite to clothe himself. Instead, at the other end of the landing, snatches of Potter's voice slip through the door of another room entirely, just barely ajar.
"This?" Pansy pinches the organza between her thumb and forefinger, rubbing the texture between her fingers. "Draco, what is this? It's beautiful."
"Do you really want the last interaction you've had with my friends to be caught kissing behind Ron's parents' house before shrieking goodbye and Disapparating?" Harry asks, smugness pulling at the corners of his lips.
"Don't tease me!" Malfoy snaps, turning suddenly to finally face Harry, and this close, Harry can see his face again—he's angry. Why is he
"What are you wearing?" Potter asks as Draco falls into the same old armchair in the next room. Draco drops his satchel to the floor with a soft
"Is that what that's supposed to be?" Draco wants to know, head tilting with exaggerated inquisitiveness.
"He made a joke about how I missed Hugo’s birth," Harry says, closing his eyes. "Said I must be planning another breakdown in time to miss the next baby." He shakes his head. "What a stupid thing to be so angry about."
out here, and while Draco has a ready retort about just how unfit for anything posh Potter's hair is—
"Liar." Harry taps the end of his wand against the soft underside of Draco's jaw. "Have you come to kill me, then? Take revenge for your sorry excuse of a father going where he belongs?"
He realizes, as Harry's own pained realization flashes across his face, that he hadn't even mentioned the word
"Right." Harry rolls his eyes and makes his way to the living room as gracefully as any man might with a six foot barnacle hanging off his left shoulder.
He wonders what it must have been like at the Burrow, when Harry came back. Molly must have gone absolutely spare. Ron must have wept, and Draco bets he called Harry a wanker through those tears. For them, it would be a sad but funny quirk that Harry couldn't remember any of them past the Battle of Hogwarts, not an insurmountable agony.
"I don't think you would, actually," Potter says, and Draco pauses, because these moments of being sassed by Potter come so intermittently that he's surprised every time.
He's sitting at their kitchen table, in their house in Chudley. Ron and Hermione sit across from him; Hermione's eyes are rimmed red, and Ron's long nose has gone red from crying.
that had nothing to do with either the event or Harry himself. His second design was based on assumptions, listening to Harry's overheard words but not
"What an excellent point you've made. I'll just wander off into the wilderness on my own and see if I ever come back, no Harry Potter required."
The eulogy is what anyone would expect at a funeral. All of Lucius Malfoy's mistakes and faults of character are distilled into a handful of strong, positive words. His bribe-like monetary donations become his generosity. His obsession with blood purity becomes a strong interest in preserving history. His need for a perfect son in his exact image now makes him a dedicated father.
"Potter!" Williamson suddenly isn't listening anymore, tearing past Draco for the door. Draco whirls to see, on the other side of the glass, a cowering Dendron before a Harry Potter on his feet, wand raised in a tight fist. Draco pelts after Williamson, only seconds behind him.
"No," Draco says slowly, adding his measuring tape to the drawer of his drafting table before tapping it back into a satchel. "I believe I have everything I need, for the moment." The coffee he drank just before making his trip to Islington is catching up to him. "Might I make use of the facilities before I go?"
Another careful look. "Yes," she says, slowly, tapping the side of her face with one finger. "You were fine before, really, but you only listen to me about what you should wear when something's afoot. Tell me who the client is."
Potter doesn't say anything as Draco hauls himself up with a groan. His mother had warned him so many times in the past that Malfoy joints were no good; even with the Cushioning Charm, his knees hadn't much liked being that close to the floor. He ignores Potter to check over his measurements. They're rudimentary, but enough to apply to the Resizing Dress Form, so he doesn't think there's any need to torture Potter further.
"If you like this, I'll have Pansy make a headpiece that matches it," Draco says, petting the organza now. He's not quite sure
Ginny throws her head back and guffaws, and Draco sees now why she and Pansy seem so well-matched. "Nice save, Malfoy. Maybe you can teach Harry something about how to rescue a conversation, eh?"
"I'll have to get there before she sends a Howler, then," Harry says, cringing. "Feels like all this Gala is really doing for me is setting up future social plans when I'm barely up to the one."
Then Draco Malfoy reenters his world. Just as much a whirlwind of entitlement, sharp remarks and words meant to provoke as he ever has been, somehow focused from his first step into the Auror offices on dragging Harry out of his icy disguise. For the first time in years, Head Auror Potter slips.
It's such a simple incantation. A single word that robbed Harry of years of his life; the Mediwizards at St. Mungos admitted Harry would likely never remember who cursed him, even with a full Legilimency healing. And yes, Draco believes he's powerful enough to pull off a memory charm of the magnitude and precision required. He could Obliviate himself.
Strange, Draco muses as he opens Pertinger's folder atop the case files, that any Auror, even one so wet behind the ears, should be ignorant of a coworker's injury status. According to the case files, Pertinger was hit with the curse on duty, trying to take down the latest lunatic victim before they spread the curse any further. Even Potter must surely know that compartmentalization can be taken too far, hindering his little Ministry-approved army of brutes—and he'd never taken Potter for the secretive type, anyway.
Mafalda Hopkirk pokes her grey head into the office from the corner hall, scowling. "Really, now!" And the entire office breaks out in laughter that just makes her harrumph as she withdraws.
Potter. His father's funeral should be the headline of this session, and still everything comes back to Potter.
—that Draco looks away in an instant. He thinks Potter does the same, but he's not chancing another look. He takes his quill in hand, writes in a neat
The kettle shrieks back in the kitchen, and Draco pulls himself from his self-imposed torture to leave the drawing room. "What would Dr. Fiddlewood say?" he mutters to himself as he heads toward the stove, pulling the kettle from the heat as he flicks the burner off with a deft twist. But he struggles to think of just what she might tell him, hearing a replay of Harry's words again instead, calling him a manipulative cockroach.
"I don't know how you've done it, Draco Malfoy," Harry says, and Merlin, he's so close, he's leaning in and Draco knows it must be because his voice is so quiet, he just wants Draco to hear, but he can
It's Malfoy who kisses Harry first. It's Malfoy who closes the gap between their lips, slowly, asking permission with his eyes and receiving his answer by way of Harry's closed eyes and parted mouth. Malfoy kisses softly at first, a second question in his tenderness—
"Apparently, if anything goes wrong at the party, you're going to Apparate me to the moon, and we won't be seen again." Harry vanishes into the kitchen, and Draco twists his anxious hands together until his knuckles crack. He follows Harry in despite his trepidation.
Draco settles into the sitting room with his dinner of pork cutlet and roasted asparagus on a tea tray balanced on his lap, holding a letter from his mother in one hand. He received the letter this morning, but in his rush to the Ministry he'd just set it aside for later.
Harry swallows again, turning his face away from the firelight, and for a long, long moment, Draco is sure that's it—he's fucked it all up. All that trust squandered.
"By being me, I suppose," Potter says with another tug at his hair. His hairline doesn't seem to have moved at all since they were in school, drat him. Drat Lucius Malfoy and his genetics, may he rest in some modicum of peace, but not too much. "I did try to actually shave my hair off, you know. It just didn't take."
"This! I'm—I'm old! I've got aches, and crow's feet, and there's gray in my beard! I've got a bloody
"I don't mean anything by it except that Harry's recovered a good deal of his memories this past week." She follows Draco outside, and collects a big wicker basket from its place against the wall to take over to Ron. Ron's already thwacking away amid the delicatas, and Hermione puts the single squash he's managed to harvest into the basket. "It's excellent news, if you ask me."
"I don't mean because of that." Draco settles back into the bed, wiggling his shoulders until the wound in his right one reminds him he oughtn't. "Because you're powerful, Harry. Exactly the kind of powerful wizard Griselda would want to drain of magic."
His therapist says he doesn't deserve it; she even says he didn't deserve the outright jeers and attempted assaults when he was just barely of age. He's supposed to at least try to take her words to heart.
Well, Draco is nothing if not a talented wizard, even if most of his talents lie in charming fabrics to trail glittering stars. He brandishes his wand anew and pushes the door open.
"That it would be me, what?" Draco asks. He looks down at Potter's hand and changes the position of his own two, now drawing his circles with a lazy index finger as the other hand cradles Potter's. His heart is still in his throat, possibly never to come down. He supposes that's just where his heart lives, now.
Most of the Manor is sealed off now. Before Narcissa left for Europe the first time, she'd cast locking charms on so many of the rooms tainted by the occupation rather than look at them ever again. Without his wand, Draco is powerless to reopen them, but he doesn't have any desire to ever look at the drawing room where he was asked to identify Harry Potter for Voldemort's killing pleasure.
"Biased is the diplomatic term," Draco sneers in reply. "I made Harry look like a god, and you made Weasley look like an off-season matador."
Harry goes on with his story, Draco sipping his butterbeer at the edge of the conversation. He heard this story yesterday, but he laughs along with his friends at just the right points, in case Harry's forgotten he told Draco already. Even when what Harry forgets is easily categorized as natural, human, even middle-aged forgetfulness, reminders of it just breed anxiety and irritability that can spiral quickly. Ron started a story with the words
Harry frowns, rubbing his chin in thought. "How could a victim keep casting curses if their magic vanishes?"
"If the opposite of you constantly insulting me is being some kind of sycophant, I'd rather you go back to insulting me."
"Sorry." Harry's hand finds its place wrapped around Draco's. Draco checks Harry's handiwork; Hermione and Ron are one seat closer to the Minister, putting Harry's placard between Draco's and Ron's.
"So—" Draco finds himself blinking rapidly, his tears returning fresh and painful. "You would rather have gaping holes in your memory than even entertain the
Potter's wand is at his throat before he even understands why he's lost his balance. Both his arms have been jammed up behind his back, straining his shoulders painfully, and his weight is all against Potter's broad chest before he can shuffle his feet back under himself. Potter's breath comes hot and dangerous by his ear, and Draco finds his pulse is racing, a frightened rabbit heart threatening to explode.
It doesn't make him feel any better. Molly bids him farewell after showing him each and every dish she's brought him and where she's put it away, and Draco is left inside his empty home, its only occupant. He lays about with his mind buzzing in the remaining hours before bedtime, then summons a pillow and blanket from the closet so he can sleep on the sofa. He can't bring himself to go up to the master bedroom anymore, to lay down next to no one.
"Good morning, Draco," Pansy calls out across the atelier as she enters, and Draco swears his lungs twist into little babka knots. There's something off about her voice.
"Oh, don't be so dramatic," Draco murmurs, taking better stock of himself now that his eyes have adjusted. He's tucked into a hospital bed, angled up just enough to see Harry without craning his neck, and he's swathed in what feels like a sea of bandages. His left forearm, in particular, is bulky with it. "What's it been, an hour?"
The kitchen has nothing in common from the snatches of memory from his youth. The practically medieval vibes he recalls are gone, replaced with a fairly modern kitchen, though it looks well lived-in. The broken-down cabinets, once resplendent in a dark walnut, have been repaired and repainted in white, a sort of shabby chic that suits Potter. There are dishes in the sink, a stain on one of the counters, and most jarringly, a refrigerator. There's never been one of
Draco should be happy to let Potter leave his ancestral lands, as it were. He should want nothing more than the solitude he had just been seeking, to have no more company than the sky and the plants and the tiny animals housed in both. But finding Potter wandering the canola fields feels like the discovery of a strange new magical creature, rare and fleeting. He reaches for Potter's wrist.
The Great Hall is bright when Draco follows Harry through. The long tables he ate at as a child have been cleared away, replaced with a number of round tables; Draco wonders if they're the same ones they trotted out for the Yule Ball, all those years ago. The walls are pushed out, borrowing from the rest of the castle to Expand the room. Floating balls of
to drop in his perfect quip," she grumbles. "Alright, Draco, we'll be there Thursday afternoon. Don't forget us, darling, you know your memory is shit."
Draco's vision blurs, and he can't figure out why until he feels the first tear sliding down his face. "I don't," he says, the words riding a shaky breath. "It's not true."
"Keep going, he says," Malfoy mutters. "Alright, fine. I'm sorry for working for that troll in a pink skirt in fifth year."
"I'm going downstairs to get lunch started." Potter pauses at the door, looking at Draco blankly. "You're going upstairs to sleep."
Draco rolls his eyes. "I couldn't, you debase yourself so well I'm too self conscious to try it for myself."
But Draco Malfoy does not give up, for good or bad, and he's spent the morning in the garden, restoring the stupid garden furniture to some degree of usefulness and beauty. Inside, Harry has been toiling in the kitchen for hours, and will probably go on toiling for several more. The one time Draco had popped into the basement, thinking he'd get underfoot as he once had until Harry found something for him to do, he was shouted right back up to the ground floor. Something to the effect of Draco's CV being found lacking, with no time for an inexperienced sous chef.
"Puddlemere!" Harry gasps in mock outrage. "Do you actually think that, or do you assume they'll win because all their recruits are high profile every season?"
"Don't you remember? You've been downgraded to friendly rival," Harry snickers. "Or upgraded, it's all in how you look at it."
"Shut up!" Harry raises the stupid boot to his mouth, clacking his teeth painfully, and barely has to tip it before he's gulping down mouthfuls of beer, foam painting itself across his upper lip. "There!" he says with a gasp, when he's drained a couple inches out of the thing, and wipes at his mouth with the back of his hand. "Now you."
, living home to a curse that checks potential new victims for two things. First: A wand. Pertinger ignored both the wandless star Hogwarts student as well as Draco himself.
Granger adds, as a post script, that Draco should come, then adds another post script saying she hopes Draco had already assumed he would be in attendance. He rolls his eyes before summoning more parchment.
"I'm 42. Hardly a boy." A wave of Potter's hand, and the cabinet doors of a liquor bar in the corner swing open. "Whiskey, Malfoy?"
It takes Draco a moment to realize Potter is cooking. Cooking what, he doesn't know, but there's already a pot on the stove, a tray going in the oven, and an aproned Potter is deftly pulling the leaves from oregano stems.
"I'd turn you down flat if you offered me English Breakfast," Draco snorts. "Do you have no respect for my tastebuds?"
"Well then, I suppose you've helped yourself," Harry says, and starts turning back toward the summit.
, properly, and not as like, Malfoy brought the wine!" Harry says with a nervous, hiccuping chuckle, his words jumbling together. "It doesn't have to be that word. If you don't want it to be."
Draco lowers himself to the floor, tucking himself carefully under the organza and leaning his side against the sofa. He should have a snappy repartée for that, but all he manages is to rest his chin on the back of his hand, held up by the seat cushion of the sofa.
"I've been here before, you know. Out in the fields." Potter lets go of the leaf, and its stalk bounces softly with its release. "I like to come here on my own terms."
"Thank you for the reminder," Draco says drily, holding up a hand to the server offering a tray of Champagne flutes. Hermione takes one, replacing it with her empty glass.
"Saved you?" Potter doesn't quite hide the disbelief in his words. Draco can feel it rumble under his fingertips.
"Maybe I do." Draco wiggles his fingers. "Come on, Pans." She huffs, then slaps her hands into his, and Draco winces.
"Oh, er—" Potter blinks rapidly. "Of course. But—oh, not that one right there," he adds, as Draco picks up his satchel and makes his way to the door. "Better to use the one upstairs."
Potter frowns, but doesn't move from his desk. "Alright." At least today there's some semblance of work on Harry's desk, spread out in the unorganized way he expected to see.
"No, no, we have to pull out the big guns, don't we? Now's your chance to show Parvati Patil that you do know how to show a girl a good time, and be the best looking pair on the dance floor. Potter, do you know how to waltz?"
Pansy leans forward, eyebrows now wiggling like a stadium audience waving their arms, and Draco decides immediately he will not share the news of Potter's weight gain. Not yet, anyway; it's not like she won't find his measurements once they're taken, or see the completed garment once it hangs on a Resizing Dress Form, patent pending. And she's well aware of the privacy agreement Draco signed, promising she wouldn't even talk to anyone else in the atelier about it. But telling Pansy now feels salacious in a way that makes him feel slimy, rather than the bitchy delight gossip usually brings him.
"Then you will," Draco says, quiet but firm. It's an echo from his own recent past, trading bottles for needle and thread. He had never felt ready.
on it wrong. There's strength reinforcements in every seam, and it's spill-resistant, tear-resistant, and even wrinkle resistant. You'd better believe there's charms protecting the pearls, individually, as well."
That has to be where Harry is. Draco strides toward it immediately, heart just behind his teeth. He's always passively wondered why Harry wouldn't have come home if he's as alive as Draco claims, wondered if Harry had been hurt, brainwashed, mutilated beyond even his own recognition. Wondered, on some dark nights, if Harry had seen an easy way out of a disappointing marriage to a terrible and stupid man.
Harry looks oddly somber at that. "I don't—I don't mean to leave in the middle of things, you know. I don't want to go back to work for any number of reasons, but this is certainly on the list now." The smile he gives Draco this time is weak, falling almost as soon as it's up. "It's not what I expected to happen, if you want to know. You surprised me." Harry adjusts his bag, clearing his throat. "But I'm glad you did."
Harry doesn't know if he's felt this way before. He knows what he thought he felt for Ginny, and even for Cho, and he knows in the end he had been fooling himself. (If nothing else, Ginny had been doing much the same, and seemed so happy with Luna when last he saw her, five years ago.) He and Ginny had been each other's escape, each hiding in the other's embrace against the crushing pressure of the war, against the storm of life.
That doesn't seem to be the reaction Malfoy wanted, because he's frowning, and says, "Oh, come off it, Potter, that didn't hurt your feelings. There's no way."
"Why are you doing this?" Draco's mouth is dry. He's screaming inside himself that it doesn't matter what fucking intel he gathers if he's just going to die, but he's asked it already, and why
"Well, mate," Ron says, tapping the handle of the basket. "It's intense, I won't lie to you. It's like reliving all those memories, not just seeing them happen but
Pansy hums. "Three very long visits to Harry Potter's home, an unnecessary and complete revision of Harry Potter's ensemble that has thrown you off schedule and deeply cut into the administrative work that you promised to take on entirely. That promise, you might recall, was in exchange for the only workspace with a door, as well as your name on the official company name because you thought my surname made it too long and unwieldy."
The grounds of Malfoy Manor had fallen into shameful disrepair before his mother's return for the funeral. With just a few waves of her wand, Narcissa had restored them to their splendor, but without her magic to sustain them, and with no staff to replace that magic, Draco has no doubt they will relapse into their overgrown, tumbledown state before too long. He keeps walking.
There is absolutely nothing untoward about it, as it turns out. A standard legal document that looks like it was copied from a Ministry file, guaranteeing Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy and Atelier Malfoy's promise of client confidentiality as pertains to the transaction between one Mr. Harry James Potter and Atelier Malfoy, blah blah blah. Yadda yadda, as Draco's favorite American client is wont to say.
"Were you just fishing for compliments, then?" Harry says, his smile lopsided with alcohol. "Git. Suppose I should ask you if I'm fit, let you get out that long list of insults."
She frowns. "Aren't you the scholar? Didn't you figure out what it is my spell does? I'm draining magic from Britain's most powerful witches and wizards."
his mother had once told him. It pulls at the seas, makes men into beasts. It makes Draco feel soft and open, like he wants to reach for Potter's hands, Potter's heart. It makes the memory of their past feel distant, immaterial, as much as it feels all-consuming, huge with its importance.
"Who sprained their ankle after nearly tobogganing down a mountain on his face?" Harry counters. "Also, you look like a photo of someone's great-granddad about to go on safari. All you're missing is your blunderbuss."
"Clever as always," Draco mutters, letting himself fall back against the pillows. "So I have a bit of a stumble in my own home and that gives my friends the right to break in with my ex-husband, does it?"
Harry had been in the room when Draco had first held Hugo. He hadn't fallen in love with holding an infant all by himself; no, Harry had been next to him, arm held around Draco's waist to anchor him in the sea of Ron and Hermione's doubt. Harry had been there when Molly had embraced him. Harry had never missed a Burrow gathering. Whatever happy moment Draco tries to summon, that he might send a message to his friends that he's sorry, that he doesn't want to push them away anymore, Harry is always there, infecting the memory with pain and sadness.
"All yours," Pansy says, putting her free hand up. "I wouldn't dare step between a Malfoy and the longtime object of his obsession."
"You're alright, aren't you?" Harry says, shrugging deeper than he means to, though his eyes sweep along with Malfoy's hands, checking for injury. "You haven't been splinched."
"Harry." Draco tucks his needle into his ferret pincushion, just for the moment. "I was thinking I was a bit hungry. Nothing more, nothing less."
"I'm sorry for that business with that horrible Skeeter woman." Suddenly Malfoy stands taller. "But you and I, we're even when it comes to attacks."
Harry retakes his seat slowly. "I was never teasing you," he whispers. "I told you, both times you said that to me. I didn't—I didn't understand what you were asking of me. But I didn't think you
Draco pulls the shroud from his head, slowly enough to tug at his hair and make more flyaways. Potter yelps.
"Fine," Draco sneers, "I'll leave." He yanks his arm away from the Larch's grasping fingers and hurries out toward the Auror office door, snatching up the contents of his desktop as he goes.
Potter looks up from his whiskey at last, and his cool demeanor only lasts a second more, replaced by discomfort. Embarrassment, perhaps? "What on earth is that?"
Hermione is speaking to him. He needs to focus, climb out of the hole he's in. Put his eyes on her. He needs to process her words, respond to them. These are all things Harry knows.
The problem, of course, is that Draco remains wandless. It is up to Harry to interpret Draco's theory and hand-flapping into actual casting and wand movement, and there's a disconnect between the two that makes Draco waspish, which in turn makes him embarrassed and apologetic.
"We've taken Harry to St. Mungo's, of course, and while it took a bit for them to make their final diagnosis, but it looks like Harry's memory is treatable."
"Nothing new," Harry says with a wicked little smile, before he shrinks the umbrella down and drops it into a bag.
They don't know what they're asking of him. They're war heroes, and staunch Gryffindors, besides. They probably don't see Draco approaching Harry as a brave thing to do, so much as a simple act of strategy that just needs to be carried out.
"Plummeted?" Draco studies Pertinger's drawn face, the valleys of her cheeks that hadn't been present in her personnel file photo. No amount of magical hydration and nutrition can substitute for a real meal. He wonders if his father had looked so shrunken as he approached death; his mother hadn't let him see the body, wanting him to remember his father hale and whole. He hadn't asked why she'd said
When he emerges, his satchel is on a hook on the wall he's quite sure wasn't there before, and he grabs his bag as though the hook personally insulted him. It
"You don't have to sell it in order to find a new living space, do you? Perhaps one with no ghosts?"
"Stop wriggling about and you wouldn't have to worry about sharp objects below the belt," Draco tsks. "Hold still, lout."
"You're such an idiot, do you know what?" Draco says with a roll of his eyes, nibbling at the soft piece of cheese before deciding it's too soft to hold onto much longer and puts the whole bite in his mouth. "Asking for help isn't lumping the whole thing off onto someone else."
"What if you'd died?" Harry wants to know, desperation coloring his voice, and the way he pushes at his hair—out in full curliness, Draco notes. So much for not debuting new old looks at St. Mungo's. "Would that have been right?"
"Just in writing? Not an Unbreakable Vow?" Draco asks, voice as dry as his brow is arched. "Shoot for the stars, why don't you?"
"Harry?" Draco calls through the small house, and wishes he could quiet the sound of his heartbeat as he listens hard for a response. Nothing.
The windchime over the back door—its tubes shaped like little brooms, its sail a snitch—lets Draco know someone's entered the garden. Draco stills, but he doesn't show himself.
"I don't know what those places are, either," Draco says with a characteristic drawl. "Some Muggle establishments, I'm sure, judging the context. Say as many Muggle names as you like, I'm not going to get it any better."
"Fine." Harry gives the direction of the summit one last wistful glance, promising himself to come back and try again
"No," Draco moans, as the unsuccessful summoning charm on the wand fades and the wood stills. "Please, Harry, for the sake of the victims, let me finish the damn spell!"
A pause, and then Malfoy's nasal voice rings out, "Salazar fucking Slytherin, who else? Are you going to open the door or must I stand here all morning?"
"You could try," Hermione says with a bemused voice, and gives Ron a peck on the cheek as he pours her cup.
Just about a minute later, the Aurors settle determinedly into their work, returning to the flow of their strange little beehive as if nothing had ever interrupted it. Apparently Sundays do nothing to thin the herd, the offices full and buzzing. Harry admits that as much as he seems to have easily played off their three day absence, he does now have a three day backlog to get through as Head Auror. "Meet me at mine tomorrow? Say, eleven in the morning?" Harry asks, hand on the knob of his office door.
Potter looks up in shock, which is to say nothing of Draco's own. Blood spatters Potter's face and arms, a dried arterial spray dark enough to make itself seen on Auror robes. He'd been holding his head when Draco came in, and his hands still quiver.
years ago by now, and the quote has dogged him since, to the point of annoyance on his part. "Melinda Hemlock," Draco mutters, rolling his eyes. More like
Potter takes his time in putting his wand back into the holster up the sleeve of his Auror robes, pushing his glasses up his nose, then re-clasping his hands behind his back.
Potter opens a closet just past the staircase without a word, gesturing. Draco plucks a wooden hanger from inside, hanging up his cape with shame burning his face into patchy ruddiness. He's
"Hermione sent me the guest list," Harry says, with a rueful little smile that Draco spots from the corner of his eye. "Will you go with me? Please?"
After ten at night, the kitchen is only serving one thing: Stew. When Harry asks what's in it, the barkeep gives him a hard eye and repeats that he can have stew or nothing. "Stew it is," Harry sighs, and the barkeep whisks off to spoon him up a bowl. "And a pint!" he calls after her, but he's not sure she heard him. "Not the lager!"
"If that's not a lie, then why didn't you direct him here?" Draco says with a disbelieving arch of his brow.
"He does need help," Granger admits, and Weasley shoots her a look of betrayal that she shrugs off. "But he's not going to get that help if he just shuts us all out. And I want him to know Rose and Hugo."
"You could have just rescheduled," Draco says faintly, scooping the jasmine flower from his tea with a spoon that materializes on his saucer. This, too, he flings into the field after the olive. "I still have the wine."
"I sit on the balcony, sometimes," Harry protests, but he looks away, almost childishly. "And I open the windows. I get air."
"I'm just another vacationer enjoying the sights, and this man accosted me," Malfoy says with a particularly smarmy look on his face. "I don't know him."
"Doesn't seem like her," Draco says, careful not to describe her any way that might get misconstrued. Loud, opinionated, perhaps a know-it-all. Harry definitely wouldn't like that last one coming from him.
It's stupid. It's absolutely impossible. Harry hasn't ventured outside of his home in ten years. For all that he's grown comfortable with Draco, that's exactly what this is; he's not used to anyone else. He's frightened, whether he admits it or not, and he needs his tailor on hand to assure him he doesn't look like a jackass, or to fix his attention-grabbing ensemble if something happens to it.
There are other rooms in this vast, echoing building he never wants to see again. It was the west green room where Fenrir Greyback had first pinned him to the wall, slavering in his ear and cackling at the scent of Draco's terror—so he'd told him, as if it was important Draco knew just what those dark guffaws were for.
Draco sighs, giving Potter's door one last disgusted look. "I suppose I am, yes. And they left you behind to make sure I don't waltz out of the Ministry with an armful of stolen files and goods?"
socially anxious as an adult and he doesn't want the only people he really knows at a party to be the guy who knows everyone, and Blaise Zabini. That's all it is. He goes to bed still arguing the point with himself; Harry is an adult who can feel out his own limits, even though past evidence has shown that his idea of limits is locking everyone out of his life for years at a time. It'll be fine. Draco is the problem. It'll be
"As if you would give real gifts if that became tradition," Draco says, trying not to laugh loud enough for anyone else to notice.
"Don't think I forgot you know how to spell away the smell of booze, you know. You're always first in, last out, like you're hiding something. And do you know what? Turns out you are."
"I'm not so callous I don't care about people dying." Draco wrings his hand, wishing he had something to put on the abraded skin of his knuckles. Or a quick spell to cast. "What do you mean, after yesterday?" He remembers Potter covered in blood, but—
"You know, people usually can't stop looking at me," Draco snorts, speaking to her freely the way one might to a cat. "I like that you don't care, Pertinger. It's refreshing."
First, Draco fills Harry in a little more thoroughly about his visit with the Granger-Weasleys, including getting punched in the bottom by their gremlin of a son, who seemed to think Draco was some kind of miscreant out to seduce his mum away from the family. That gets big laughs from Harry, who says Draco is just the type to look like a homewrecker. When Draco wants to know what that means, Harry changes the subject.
"Well, right now, I'm trapped on this rude little hill with a man who has threatened my physical safety on more than one occasion," Malfoy says as he very preciously hops over a log so small it barely deserves the title. "Why, what were
"I don't doubt it's chilly," Draco says, and it comes out uncertain, as though he's really asking for a weather report on a celestial body. He stays near the doorway to the kitchen, watching Harry finish pulling dinner together. "I thought you didn't like protective."
scream for her again, as he curls in on himself with his wand held in both hands, blood slicking his palms—Griselda approaches. Her magic pulls him back by his short hair, and she grabs at his left arm to yank his sleeve up, popping buttons and tearing fabric as she does. His faded Dark Mark lies underneath.
"I am spending enormous amounts of energy asking you gently so you won't run away like a frightened animal," Pansy growls. "And yet here you are, ready to bolt anyway."
Harry strides toward Griselda, his face a mask of rage, his magic one wordless concussive blast after another that keeps her off her feet. She snarls at him from her place on the floor, and he staggers back, but then he throws his arm out and she's pinned, spread-eagle, to the wall. Draco's vision is darkening, narrowing. The brick grows chains, ropes, vines, anything it seems Harry can think of to bind her there. It doesn't stop her, of course, and Harry is blown back again by several feet.
"I've brought wine," Draco says in a quavering voice, and holds up a massive liter bottle of Pinot Noir.
Griselda tears herself out of Draco's memories with a grin, leaving Draco dizzy and pale on the floor. "Oh, it's so much better than I'd hoped for," she says. "Up, Draco!" Her magic yanks him up like a marionette, pulling at his limbs with sharp fingers, his head lolling before he forces himself to stand straight.
And there's Harry at the center of them, gesticulating emphatically. Probably talking about the kids at the Muggleborn preschool, where he's been working for most of the past year. Harry glances Draco's way as he joins them, and gives Draco a wide smile that even now sends a jolt through Draco's heart. Draco was right; Harry's telling a story about the preschool's latest addition, who has an unhelpful predilection for jumping six feet high to grab her astonished parents' most interesting breakables, as well as clear baby gates.
The trepidation in Potter's voice brings Draco back to his body. "What? Oh—no. No, no more measurements, Potter, have no fear. Your inseam is safe from these hands." Draco wiggles his fingers at either side of his face and immediately wishes he hadn't. "Please pretend you never heard me say those words."
"I can't do a thing without them." Draco immediately corrects himself, mentally—sourcing fabric and notions can certainly take time, and require no measurements. Pansy doesn't need the diameter of Potter's head to begin work on the Horntail halo charm.  But Potter doesn't need to hear that.
"Oh, please. If not a martyr, then you're certainly being coy. Harry already told me he asked you out." Hermione gives Draco's shoulder a shove, and he barely catches himself.
"Harry," Draco says, catching the other man by the wrist with a note of warning in his voice. "Don't do anything stupid."
"It came out in 2010. That does not make it a classic. That makes it just something that has been plaguing me since the theater production first came out in 2006."
"I do none of those things!" Draco snaps, even as he flashes back to yesterday when his quill broke and he couldn't find a single whole quill anywhere in the Auror offices. He'd gone on a characteristic rant about the sorry state the DMLE finances must be in if they couldn't afford so much as a few spare quills when lives were on the line.
He doesn't realize he's put a calming hand on his own chest until he's already approaching the chatting adults.
"I would have wanted it when I was—" Draco pauses, trying to pinpoint the certain time of his life he means. "Eighteen, perhaps. When I thought the end of the war meant a fresh start for everyone."
Ron is in it too, now. He can't ignore them both. He flexes his hands, wishing he could cut them off. They might be violent.
, but there's no need to inflict them on Harry. "I've worked hard to be a better person, and in that regard I began far behind the starting line. A better person wouldn't think of you that way. Besides," Draco says, picking out his next pearl, "we're over forty; we look how we look. Pansy's got a big arse, I've no arse at all, and you've transformed into a bear fit for The King's Arms."
hate Harry, because he's a coward who has the wrong idea of what it is to be brave. And she finds him crashing to the floor as Harry counters him, blood pouring from the deep gashes in his chest and belly into the water that floods the tiles.
"No." Potter's voice doesn't rise except in urgency, and Draco feels that prey animal flutter again. "Right now."
"You don't know what he'll want by the time my Ron is finished with him, and especially after Hermione does her part. I'm sure they'll both work to help Harry see you in a good light."
"Oh, please, as if I'd debase myself with something so awful as commitment." Pansy glances at Blaise. "You and Longbottom are lovely together, Blaise. Beauty and the Bore."
Draco pours the water for his tea, dropping in a sachet of truly fine Jeju Island green tea. The sachet is pre-charmed to adjust the water to an ideal brewing temperature; he would never dream of burning delicate green tea leaves. He focuses on small things like making sure his tea is perfect because otherwise he returns to idle thoughts like pouring the boiling water over his hands, or putting one of his favorite cooking knives somewhere in his body. These thoughts never alarm him, because they feel so distant, unaccompanied by sad or self-loathing thoughts—simple
Harry frowns. "I don't think trying to dance around the magical aspects of my life with a Muggle is going to do much to help."
"I saw Granger and Weasley," Draco says, and for all that he doesn't raise his voice, his words sound piercingly loud in the quiet of the house. "They miss you, you know."
"Absolutely glorious," he mutters to himself, not for the first time tonight. Draco arranges his drafting table, with a small sheaf of fresh parchment to his left, his inkpot and small collection of sharp quills on a flat part of the drafting table to his right.
Would that Kreacher were still alive to give him some sort of status update on Harry, Draco thinks grimly. Although any house elf worth their tea towel would never let the house get in this state, he's quite sure. He picks his way through the wreckage, calling for Harry in every room on the first floor. The stairs make the only path clear enough to walk, though Draco has to leap over a particularly thick mound of mess at their bottom.
"If you mean 'do better,' then I can't say I can pinpoint it." Malfoy leans back. "You have one realization about something terrible you believed because your parents did, then another, and another, and suddenly you realize your perspective has shifted completely."
"Perhaps we're simply a naturally matched set," Draco says before he can stop his foolish mouth. He pushes his single ring further up his middle finger, a massive cameo setting with a faceted obsidian center, and checks his face in a nearby mirror for missed spots; this is the first time he's been clean-shaven in years. His hair has all been brushed to the right side of his face to make a waterfall of white hair, the sides and back of his undercut freshly shorn. "Alright. Are you ready?"
"I want anything that isn't the bloody war," Harry spits. "Cho Chang, in fourth year. Ginny Weasley, sixth year. Er, Luna Lovegood, for a bit of fifth year," he adds.
"You have a therapist?" Potter's body is starting to come loose again as he leans over with curiosity. "Do you really?"
"If you're going to shout at me again, please do it quickly, it's been an emotionally exhausting day." Draco realizes he's essentially balled himself up on the floor, and his back is going to
"Drinking this morning before I came to get you, were you?" Harry asks with a nervous laugh, rolling onto his belly in the water to swim after Malfoy.
The kettle comes to a quick boil, and Pansy continues her silence as she pours it into her mug, dropping her mesh ball of tea in after it. Only after she's replaced the kettle on its stand does she fold her hands over her lap, leaning against the counter, and look at Draco. "This is my normal start time, now."
"Just for that, yes. Stand there all afternoon, too, for all I care." Harry splashes cold water on his heated face at the kitchen sink, hoping he's buying himself enough time. Maybe Malfoy won't know a blush on dark skin when he sees one. "Come back when you're Godric Gryffindor."
with slim sleeves, and just long enough for his matching golden trousers to be seen, breaking evenly over black balmoral boots. Delicate metal sunbeams frame Harry's head, lighting his face gently with an ethereal inner radiance; just out of reach of the metal tips, tiny planets orbit Harry's temples, trailing golden glitter in their wakes.
"The drawing was certainly art, quite literally," Potter scoffs. "But this? Why don't you just pull a bag over my head and save yourself the fabric?" This time, when he hurls the robe, he puts enough force behind it that it lands at Draco's feet.
"You know," Malfoy says as they approach the foot of the mountain at last, "I do mean it when I say I want to be better. I'm just not sure where to begin."
Well, anything else he wants is unethical to think about, because Harry is a paying client. Potter, properly.
"Don't do that." Malfoy's eyes shine in the wan light cast by the half moon above, and Harry realizes he's leaning over him. The better to see his face, his reactions, he reasons.
It's the first week of Harry's holiday in Connemara, and he's signed up for a tour that he's hoping will give him some basic landmarks for exploring on his own later, the better to not get hopelessly lost in the wilderness. A tour run by Muggles, specifically, so he doesn't understand what's happening when Draco Malfoy—of all bloody people—shows up as part of the tour group.
"You can't be bloody normal. You never could, you know, but this is abysmal, even for you." Draco wants to shift, wants to peek so badly. Who on
"Now wait just one minute," Draco says, cutting Potter off before he can all but shoo him out the door with his words. "I can design for anybody. For any
"This is a fine moment we've been having, separate from this next one," Harry says, and he's kissing Draco again.
Instead they're trapped together inside possibly the tiniest proper room of a massive house, and Draco doesn't doubt Potter wishes just as fervently that he'd been sent an underling.
he says, slapping the water with both hands. "Not fair is you holding the things I've said to you over my head!"
Potter calls right back, tearing his wand from his sleeve to blast Pertinger with a Stunning Spell. It lands at her throat, and she falls back to the bed, gasping and shaking, but her eyes are still open. For once since Draco began this case, there's emotion painted across Potter's face, his expression sick with anger and despair. He Stuns her again, and she goes limp, her wand arm hanging over the edge of the thin mattress.
Harry buries his wet face in Draco's neck, arms trembling against Draco's back. It strikes Draco that it's been ten years since anyone's held Harry, and he embraces him all the tighter.
"The numbers on this order—" Elda shuffles the parchment in her arms, pulling out a particular sheet. "Mr. Malfoy, did you mean to write ten thousand spools of black thread?"
“I can’t put my finger on exactly how, but you lied to me,” she says in a low voice. “You knew I didn’t like that you’d started the Potter job over from scratch.”
"Then let's be off to Chudley." Harry gets up abruptly, as though he hadn't just been doing his best impression of an elderly man, leaving Draco's head to drop onto the cushions below.
"Oh, I love this already," she snickers, drumming her fingertips against the side of her wine glass, which she's holding wrong again. "Alright then, debase yourself."
The walk back down is not nearly as exciting. Malfoy wants the safest, most boring paths through the woods, lest he dirty up his expensive outfit or have to exert more energy than a stroll down Diagon Alley. "I don't get it," Harry says, a third of the way down. "What are you doing out here?"
"Quite," Pansy agrees, but it doesn't have any of her usual spunk to it. She selects her tea from the cabinet, and pulls out a mug emblazoned with the logo for the London Underground. (He's never been sure where it came from.)
Potter takes long, juddering breaths, in time with Draco's circles, and Draco finds he matches them with his own, until the pair of them are breathing in sync.
"At the door?" The image of a coterie of owls dropping food on Potter's doorstep and ringing the doorbell snaps Draco out of his emotional swamp just long enough to fix Potter with a confused look; Potter looks strangely... contrite? "You have a doorbell?" Draco adds, as Potter leaves the sitting room.
"A downgrade. Nobody remembers friendly rivals." Draco puts a delicate hand on Harry's arm. "How very dare you."
"I don't see how I tricked you. What do you think I did in that room?" Draco asks, sincerely curious. "Or don't you remember I have no wand?"
That's when Draco lets himself take Harry in the most, indulging himself when Harry's closest and thinking,
"You first, then." Draco unhooks himself from Harry, and gestures toward the door leading up to Dr. Fiddlewood's office.
At first, there is nothing unusual about Draco's morning. He enters the atelier at a quarter to nine on a cold winter morning, walking with swift strides lengthened by the height of the heels on his boots. He taps the kettle once to fill it with fresh water, again to set it to boil, then sets about putting coffee to brew, because he doesn't know yet if it's a tea or coffee sort of business day. His assistant Elda arrives soon after with a box of scones he knows his fussy staff will pick at all day—fashion people are hard-pressed to ever admit they are hungry. He selects a scone studded with blueberries for himself, then heads into his office in the back to review his in-tray and discover which caffeine beverage he'll be having today before Pansy joins him in about an hour, if she's feeling punctual.
"What, doubting my sexual prowess?" Harry says, laughing again. He doesn't know what makes him say it, except that the way Malfoy turns absolutely flaming was worth it. He
"I've a friendly rival lurking in my fields, then." Draco looks away as soon as he's met with Potter's surprised expression.
A teapot joins them on the blanket, suddenly, bringing with it a small glass teacup Draco's never seen before. A tightly-wrapped ball of leaves sits in the teacup's bottom, and when the teapot levitates to pour a neat stream of boiling water over it, the leaves unfurl into a flower that radiates a delicate color into the water.
"I could not possibly feel that way," Draco says, too vehemently. "Harry, not to be crass, but what you are wearing is my finest work to date."
Draco's skin nearly jumps clear off his body at Potter's voice. He hadn't even noticed him Apparating back into the room. "No, thank you," Draco says, primly, taking a step away from the minibar. Then he turns.
Panic fills him, his breath coming fast through his soundless mouth as a pair of strong hands take him by the ankles. There seems to be little effort on the part of his assailant as he's dragged along the floor, the sides of his ragdoll body scraping against door frames as they take a turn out of the bedroom.
Draco glances through the window. Dendron looks smaller, somehow, as if he's a reincarnated turtle wondering where his shell's gone. Potter is leaning forward now, and the tautness of his shoulders has spread like a contagion to the rest of his body. "No, I suppose not," he says, turning back to Williamson. There doesn't seem to be a point in bringing Dendron back; everything he's said so far, in Draco's passive listening, lines up with the case files he read when he arrived.
"Does that mean lunch is soon?" Draco asks, finishing his stitch. He pulls the next bit of fabric over, and rethreads his needle with a fresh length of silk thread.
He can feel his emotions surging up, clawing for dominance; he's going to scream, he's going to draw his wand and destroy something, or he's going to keep his wand sheathed and destroy
"Well—yes." Harry scratches at the back of his head. Since the last Auror went home, he's let his hair show again, thick and shiny. "I suppose you couldn't stay in here alone, given you don't have keys."
"Twelve—? Wait, that's my—" But Harry is gone, and Draco's only recourse is to take a pinch of powder and follow him.
"Don't tease me," Draco murmurs, pushing another ring into place as he lets his gaze drop. They're plain gold bands; he was only thinking of how they would look with Harry's robes when he chose them. He should follow his request with a funny little bon mot, make sure no one could ever think he was being vulnerable—but the moment passes, slipping by in the seconds it takes for Draco to daydream of Harry kissing him ferociously.
When he sees Malfoy at the pub central to the houses one night, he reminds himself yet again that he's here to enjoy himself and the natural beauty of Ireland,
trying to speak every blasting spell he knows until either he dies for his efforts or until one hits. And then he will keep trying some more. "Bomba—" She slices him down the middle of his abdomen and his new scream is barely distinguishable from the constant sobbing that won't stop coming out of him.
"Calling me a host implies you're my guest," Potter says as Draco follows him in, which is just bitchy enough that Draco pauses the removal of his cape mid-twirl. He can't quite tell yet if he's offended or impressed, but he thinks he might actually be leaning toward the latter.
"I'm watching you two," she says. The glass she puts next to Harry's stew is absolutely full of the lager he said he didn't want.
Draco scrapes the last few unappetizing bites of his dinner into the bin. The clock says it's time for bed, not to mention the fact that he intends to come in early. Before the Potter job, it was always Pansy late to work, but ever since she's taken up his slack—and he really does think it's unfair, he's only been to Potter's three times—she's been aggressively punctual.
Despite Draco's fears, Larch makes his return with the personnel file in hand. He thanks Larch softly, and watches the young man dip his head into Potter's office before walking out of sight, likely to his own desk. Draco assumes he's keeping Potter abreast of
"You wouldn't. It'd tear that thing apart, it looks like it's made out of gossamer and fairy wishes," Harry scoffs, holding out his arms nevertheless.
Those eyes are full of fear. Draco tries to think, under the pressure of them, what Dr. Fiddlewood would do. What had she done when Draco had broken down in her office, too dizzy to know anything but his own mortality?
A new client request. An ordinary event at Atelier Malfoy, and surely not the only one he'll receive today; the client load these days justifies a staff of three other couturiers. But this one—well, there's nothing ordinary about the client.
the heat radiating from Harry's body, from his face. "But you—you've helped me, more than you even seem to know. I never feel like I have a
"Tragically for you," Draco says with a smirk, absolutely besotted. "These go on next." He taps a tray full of jewelry.
For however long it's been since Draco last walked the corridors of Hogwarts, it takes him no time at all to remember the path to the courtyard. He casts a quick warming charm over himself as he steps outside; in the Scottish Highlands, spring won't come for weeks yet. For a while, Draco doesn't even bother feeling sorry for himself, letting the wind whistle through his brain as he looks up at the brilliant, star-studded sky.
get into fights with bigoted old schoolmates. Then he has a couple more pints, and he can't remember what he'd been reminding himself.
"You live alone in a giant house full of ghosts of horrible memories. War memories. Torture. An occupation. Living in terror."
"Stop being a pillock and take my hand or I'll break both your legs and leave you on this mountain to practice that broken bones spell you were using incorrectly before." Harry shakes his hand once more. "Come on, Malfoy, you great lump."
going to Chudley, and this is your way of telling me to go home," Draco says, setting his teacup down a little too firmly.
"This is cut just like the sage green robes," Draco says, unfurling the finished gold linen garments. An inner robe, a pair of trousers, made in the custom golden linen he wove in his own home. Instead of tiny glass beads, the collar is encrusted with a swathe of golden pearls, their density thinning as they radiate outward. Draco hopes Potter doesn't care that there are no frolicking fawns on this one; by the time he'd thought of how to decorate the robe, his brain's processing power was already shot.
To Draco's surprise, Harry laughs, though the sound is gentle and the expression doesn't quite reach his eyes. "You know, I do, actually?"
"Take down that very obvious Disillusionment Charm, then." Draco lowers his wand, but he refuses to holster it.
Despite the emptiness of the fields, Draco stands there a few minutes longer, rolling the short stem of the canola flower between his fingers.
Draco imagines the office inside, within the few seconds of waiting for permission to enter. A mess, likely, and Potter will match it, if his secretary's untamed hair and hastily-tied robes are anything to go by. Potter's appearance has ceased to be public knowledge since his ascension, but Draco remembers Potter's perpetually untidy hair and clothes well enough from school.
Draco thinks, but blessedly does not say as he rises. Potter puts a hunk of hard cheese into Draco's washed hands without looking at him, pointing at the grater nearby. If it were up to Draco, he'd simply use magic to get this done—but it's clear that's not how Potter does things. So he grates.
"Yes, in your best rags," Draco says, meeting Potter's smirk with his own, albeit less rueful and more playful. He hopes it's the right kind of playful.
The front door slams open. Draco had left it ajar, he suddenly realizes, and if that's Harry, he must think there's an intruder. Draco tucks the journal into his cloak without thinking, and shouts, "Harry?" before rushing back into the entryway.
these days is because of his ongoing refusal to be seen in public; the most recent photo of him in known existence dates to his thirty-third birthday party, the scene of his disappearance from the public eye.
As Draco fidgets with his Never-Ending Measuring Tape, the door to the drawing room opens, and in comes Potter's Disillusionment Charm. Disillusionment is right. Draco sighs, trying so hard not to sneer. "I can't measure what I can barely see," he says, releasing the end of the measuring tape and letting it snap back into its fathomless little case.
Nobody tells him when the Legilimency sessions begin, though he knows each of Harry's emotional anchors—that is to say Ron, Hermione, and himself if Harry ever lets him—must endure no less than five arduous sessions over the course of as many days. Draco spends the days waiting to hear about the beginning of the sessions in a gardening fever, with colder months approaching. He'll need to start a new compost, take cuttings, collect seeds to get the garden through winter, just to start.
"What I'm saying is—there's no other outcome, if you take the shroud off. If you want to keep it on, if you want to find a way to sneak out—we'll find a way. But Harry," Draco says, turning to face Harry's voice, "for what it's worth, you have me. I'm here."
"Getting there, dear." Molly taps a cabinet door and it swings open, revealing precarious stacks of plates. "Would you get your cousin and set the table?"
"You know what?" Harry lets go of his shirt hem and smooths his hands down it, then does the same to his head, his hair vanishing in favor of stubble. "Nothing. Nothing at all. Let's go."
of all places, but puzzle pieces are beginning to slot themselves together in his brain and he can't do much more than sit back and let it happen.
yet. (It doesn't escape him that this is, just about, the glass of wine and h'ordeuvres he'd almost invited Harry to before.) He has a feeling Harry is more a beer drinker than wine, though, and he regrets not inviting Greg, just a tiny bit; Greg might know about beer.
. Draco scoffs, glances at the little owl hunting under the cabinets for more owl treats, and summons parchment and quill.
"Oh! Here. Ron said I ought to give it to you." Harry fishes in the pocket of his jeans, and pulls out the wedding ring with its crossed boughs. He holds it out in the flat of his hand. "I think he's right."
The body count is so much higher than Draco had known. The only survivors so far are the victims most recently cursed, and by the look of things, their days are certainly numbered.
He marks his curve, and sighs as he moves on to the next dotted carbon line in need of truing. "You're being very stiff, you know," he tells her.
"Stop, I've never lied about my age. I'm a fun 33." Her fingers wiggle. "Ooh, I'd die for a smoke. I've had enough of watching you soak up all the attention like you did third year for that thing with the hippogriff, Draco, I'm off."
Draco doesn't like this Potter one bit. He's always had a tempestuous relationship with Potter, but at least the Potter he grew up with—fiery, impetuous, disrespectful, certainly a streak of martyrdom—was a known quantity. The Potter he's faced with now is an immovable object, and if manipulation works on him, it's outside of Draco's usual bag of tricks.
free food out of the deal, and I still maintain my house is nicer than your flat." He raises his arm at Draco's nudge.
He taps a thoughtful finger toward the bottom of the list of victims. Auror Blair Pertinger, the only MLE employee to have been struck—and she's still alive. She's been placed in "protective custody" at St. Mungo's, which is a confounding combination of words if ever he's seen one.
Rather than reply, Draco begins pulling out the next item. He admits he stuck to the formula of the green and silver ensemble—he still rather likes the concept of a massive robe draped over another. Masses of black organza tumble out of the bag like a Muggle magician's handkerchiefs as Draco pulls, twinkling with the ornamentation buried in its folds.
Draco talks, just as Dr. Fiddlewood had promised he would when they began. He tells her about the funeral. About saying nothing. About ditching his friends who had only come to support him. About his mother crying—and Dr. Fiddlewood already knows not to point out that people usually do cry at funerals, especially ones for their husbands. His mother is not
Draco doesn't comment on her faux pas. He taps his chin, the better to control his wayward hands. "Are there other survivors on this ward?"
"Well, I was too bloody embarrassed, wasn't I?" Malfoy says, not bothering to correct Harry. "He wasn't impressed by me. I couldn't very well just fucking talk to him, when all I knew how to do was brag or be cruel."
"You know, I almost didn't wear the thigh-high boots, but now I'm glad I did. There's rather a chill in here, don't you think?" Pansy says, glancing meaningfully at Draco's chest. "A tid bit nipply, one might say."
"Interesting words from a Malfoy," Williamson snorts, ruffling the front of his beard. "No, Malfoy, you're better off waiting for tomorrow. Potter will be in there all day, after yesterday. Your contract is the same price no matter how you go about solving the case, anyway, so why the rush?"
He considers climbing the veritable tower that is Twelve Grimmauld, to make sure Potter knows which way round to put his trousers on and that he hasn't somehow ripped through all Draco's seams, but just the thought of all that cardio puts him off the idea quickly. No wonder Potter Apparates from room to room, more or less, for all that Draco gave him grief about it the last time he was here. Instead he investigates the contents of Potter's minibar, and a thought tickles the back of his brain. After all
"Buck—that great hairy beast?" Malfoy scoffs, and when Harry gives him a stony face right back, Malfoy frowns. "That was my father's idea. Not mine. But," and he swallows, "yes, I can be sorry on his behalf."
