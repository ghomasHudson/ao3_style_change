Draco didn’t hesitate to immediately press against her. The head of his arousal ground obscenely against her plump bottom cheek as he leaned down to his in her ear, “This is how you want me, Potter? Like a bloody animal?”
His grey eyes narrowed and his mouth fell open.
As Draco crashed into her over and over again, his fingers deftly slipped around the curve of her belly and found that bundle of nerves at the crest of her womanhood, as swollen and sensitive as the rest of her body. Kisses as frantic and rough as the motions of Draco’s fingers against Harriet’s pleasure spot flew back and forth between them and somewhere in their gasping, groaning display of passion, they both reached their peaks, crying out against each other. The sheets beneath them were soaked with the sweat of their exertion but neither of them cared.
“Malfoy…...that’s…...that’s a very big decision!” Hermione gasped.
“Looked real to me.” Ron commented.
Harriet and Draco hadn’t bothered to explain enough of their personal lives to make any real, discernible sense.
Harriet healed nicely after the birth and she was pleased by how quickly her tummy started to deflate.
Draco bent his neck and pressed a loving kiss against Harriet’s forehead.
Draco to fall on his knees as soon as they were back in his room and express his love for her again?
They fell into such a familiar routine that one night, when Draco wrapped around Harriet, he noticed she was actually arching her spine towards him.
“Say it.” Draco smirked down at his mate.
“Harriet!” George called out to his old friend as she walked up.
Harriet laughed at the softness in her mate’s grey eyes as he knelt in front of her and gently touched her flat belly with his hand.
That was the wrong answer to give to the blonde at that moment.
Harriet’s dress was dreamy and elegant, the ivory fabric was a striking contrast against her vividly green eyes and her rich, dark hair, which Hermione had skillfully managed to tame into a sophisticated chignon.
That had been his own idea.
Draco was glad that he had Harriet back, really back, and that she was acting like her old self once more.
Harriet changed into her new dress and looked at her reflection in the mirror while she tamed her rustled hair with a few strokes from her brush.
She blinked as Draco stood beside her and placed one of his large hands across the very slight, but very present, little bulge that had manifested on her lower abdomen.
—————————————————————
It registered to Harriet that that horrible pain had ended and then, shockingly, Hermione moved back and Draco sat a tiny bundle next to her on the bed.
“Ron, it’s complicated!” Harriet said quickly as she glanced over at Ron.
“Daddy thinks that it’s time for Mummy to stay home.” Draco said with a dark frown as he lifted his eyes up to meet Harriet’s.
As he did, his grey eyes hovered reverently over her swollen belly.
—————————————————————
“Then…..I can…..I can build a piece suited to whatever needs you seek to meet, sir.” The jewelry salesman offered, desperate to gain some of the Malfoy family’s gold.
Draco moaned as Harriet crushed her lips against his in a deep, loving kiss.
Narcissa had lied during the war to protect Harriet, ultimately to protect Draco, but regardless of her true reasoning, if Narcissa hadn’t told her lie, Harriet would have never lived through the battle.
The couple had retreated to their flat the night before. Draco watched as Harriet rushed around to make herself decent for the momentary arrival of their guests.
Harriet was constantly and irrationally worried about Scorpius’s life. If he cried, she cried along with him. If Scorpius was carried out of the room by anyone, even Draco, Harriet followed closely behind, convinced that whoever held her baby was out to take revenge on her by hurting her only child.
She saw herself after the war when she found out about the baby, showing the test results to Draco, which caused him to embrace her warmly in a show of his gladness.
Draco swallowed dryly as he stared absently at his wife.
When the Malfoy family was left standing alone in their elegant dining room, Narcissa frowned and glanced worriedly between her warring husband and son.
“Potter, look at me. Look at me! Breathe, remember? Focus on your breathing.” Draco calmly coached his omega while he splayed his elegant hands protectively over her belly.
Ron and Hermione both nodded hesitantly.
As soon as Harriet crawled under the covers next to Draco though, she noticed that resting really wasn’t on her husband’s mind.
Narcissa looked like she was in great pain as she gazed at her son and spoke softly, “Draco, darling-“
Harriet watched Draco stare reverently towards the screen and her grip tightened on his as she watched him gaze at it as if he were looking into the future itself.
“You’re mine, Potter.” Draco boldly declared as he crawled over Harriet and cupped her face in his hand.
Harriet turned around in the bed and bent down to give him a kiss.
Harriet glanced over at the score board and saw that Slytherin had a ten point lead.
Both the healer and the midwife turned around to stare at their employer.
She was healed and feeling well, but she had noticed that Draco hadn't made love to her since Scorpius was born and she didn’t understand why.
“A-Alright…...thank you.” Harriet mumbled.
Harriet had worried that Draco would be annoying and relentlessly overbearing, but to her surprise, as the days passed by, he continued to look after her, but he seemed to be drifting farther and farther away when he wasn’t lying with her in the nest.
He cracked his grey eyes open and spied Harriet lying beside him as she rustled around while she slowly woke.
Harriet was so busy drowning in her husband’s affection that she barely felt Scorpius latch on.
Didn’t he know that?
Ring, Ring!
Harriet was the only one who knew about the baby.
Harriet blinked as Draco reached under her arms and, careful not to put any pressure on her belly, lifted her up.
Harriet kissed his cheek gently before she struggled out of bed as quietly as possible.
“You didn’t trouble me at all.” Draco replied, “I’m glad I could help. That’s all I want to do, Potter…...Help.”
—————————————————————
“Everything’s fine, Weasley.” Draco sneered.
“Draco?” Harriet asked quietly.
In response, Draco smirked down at his son, which caused a wide grin to break out across Scorpius’s tiny, pale face.
Harriet’s robes did an excellent job of hiding her condition, but as she turned, with her hand pressed on her middle, Draco saw the outline of her new curves.
Had that been passion or spite?
“It’s alright, it’s alright, love. I’m here, I’m right here.” Harry said, chuckling as he kissed Draco’s cheek reassuringly, “Ready to go, darling?”
Harriet’s head spun even faster when she heard that.
Draco made no attempts at moving until Harriet wriggled out from underneath him and stood.
She hadn’t been correct in assuming her contractions had been farther apart than they felt.
“Is she having twins?” Draco asked with narrowed eyes, “Is there another baby?”
She could only tolerate apples, apples and carrots, but anything else made her gag.
Caring for Your Newborn
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Draco had sent for a healer, but by the time the wizarding island’s medical team arrived, Harriet was already frantically scrambling to make a nest on the bed in their lavish room while she whimpered for Draco, desperate for him to join her there.
Harriet had to abandon the idea of enjoying some quality time with her alpha, he simply didn’t have the available room in his schedule for that.
The early morning looked like a masterpiece as the sky gleamed with striking, vivid hues of orange, yellow, purple, and pink. The ocean only enhanced the splendor of the scene and in the bright light of day, Harriet and Draco were both awed by how clear the water looked that surrounded them.
When she turned her face up to look at him, Draco glanced down and met her gaze with a gentle smile on his handsome features.
Freed from his father’s disruptive commentary about his life, his choices, and his mistakes, Draco smirked at himself in the mirror.
The full brunt of her heat didn’t crash over her until the day of her alpha’s return.
Harriet thought that she should have felt relieved and happy.
“Shopping?” Harriet asked as she glanced up at her alpha.
As Draco slipped from her, he took his wand from his pocket and apprated them both back to Malfoy manor.
It was over.
He was angry at Harriet.
Thank you so much for reading and following! I hope that you enjoyed this story! I have more Drarry works planned for the future. If they interest you, I hope you’ll consider checking them out! Thanks again!
They were going to be…..to really be…...married?
Draco nodded with a frown at Harriet before he quickly went to do as the midwife ordered.
She felt an unfamiliar sensation, a soothing, gentle motion over the firm curve of her swollen belly.
She looked forward to going home that evening.
“What?!” Draco barked.
He would gladly marry Harriet the instant she would have him and his father knew that.
With a scowl, Draco opened the door and barged into his bedroom without bothering to knock.
At a surprising speed, their kiss went from sweet to passionate to greedy as Harriet’s hands moved up and down Draco’s chest to feel the firmness of his fit frame through the soft fabric of his shirt.
The Slytherin princess hadn’t been watching the clock and so, she didn’t panic when another pain hit her middle, as sharp and as sudden as the last.
But when that week arrived, Harriet was disheartened to discover they had all been wrong.
Harriet was more than surprised though when her alpha readily assisted her with Rose’s care.
Envy wasn’t a feeling that Draco Malfoy was used to, he usually had everything and others envied him for it.
Draco reached over and gave Harriet’s bare thigh a kiss as the frustrated omega whined, “Draco, you’re being ridiculous. The pamphlets said-“
Memories of the past months and the previous night flashed through his mind.
“Potter and I are mates.” Draco said simply, deciding that he would interject after all, since Harriet couldn’t find her own words, “And our gelato is melting, so you’ll have to excuse us, Granger.”
Draco looked at his mother for a second and then they both left the room, followed by the healer and the midwife who also politely took their exits.
Since the matter of the looming adoption was all but handled, Draco focused on his next most important task, helping his pregnant omega settle into life at Malfoy manor while he saw to her care.
“Love…….” Draco spoke softly, “Wake up, it’s time to eat.”
Inside the tangled mess of covers, Draco could just barely see Harriet’s head poking out. He smiled softly when he heard her gentle, rhythmic breathing.
In his picture, he was seated on Narcissa’s lap with Lucius standing stoically behind them both.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“......Need you to move…” Harriet gasped as the feeling of being so pleasantly full returned at last.
“Perhaps that’s because I enjoy seeing you in them, Potter~.” Draco smirked.
Harriet was relieved that Draco understood the error of his ways, but she had no issues forgiving her alpha as they resumed the usual, daily dynamics they had previously established.
Baby Scorpius didn’t hear Draco’s guttural grunts as he held Harriet’s hips in his hands and thrust into her from behind.
“Well, well, well, Potter~. I’ve finally tracked you down.”
The letter was an invitation to the Weasleys’ for tea.
She smiled to herself and took a deep breath, enjoying the fresh breeze from the sea that billowed into her and Draco’s room.
For an alpha, choosing an omega usually meant that marriage was on the very near horizon. The Malfoys were a bit concerned since their son had yet to introduce them to his mysterious lover.
He wasn’t sure how he had imagined it would all go, if Harriet did decide to be with him and raise their child together. Of course his overbearing parents would be involved and that meant that they would have to interact with Harriet during several different points in time.
“Good morning, husband.” Harriet replied with a proud grin.
“What is that?!” Draco demanded as he scowled at the muggle doctor.
Or a bakery, perhaps?
“In the muggle world, proposing in a restaurant is considered ‘cliché’.” Hermione educated the alpha across from her, “Perhaps it is in the wizarding world too, I’m not that familiar with magical engagement traditions.”
Harriet didn’t even have to turn anything.
Once the decorations were up and the throngs of guests started to arrive, Harriet stayed safely hidden away in the secluded part of the manor where she had spent the night.
Harriet her moment, it was his turn then.
“Well, you don’t think that’s it, do you?!” Hermione exclaimed.
There was indeed a corridor in Malfoy manor that was lined with each generation’s family portrait, which were made shortly after the birth of a new child.
Draco looked down at Harriet once her tears had ceased. Harriet felt his gaze upon her and she turned her head to look up at him as well.
“Most men think pregnant women are fat and ugly.” Harriet sniffed.
He had read nightmares were common for pregnant women.
He didn’t have time for rhetoric!
Draco had to nearly force what little he could down her throat. He complimented his efforts at feeding the mother of his child by coaxing her into taking small sips of water every once in a while.
The man blinked in surprise at Draco.
“Good.” Lucius huffed, “Go to bed and get yourself some rest, you’ve got your work cut out for you.”
—————————————————————
“It will be if you can get the girl more rest.” The midwife interjected.
For the next seven days, Harriet laid blissfully in her alpha’s arms while she lounged about in his care.
Being extremely careful not to make any noise while he put his clothes on and they apparated away from the manor, Draco breathed a sigh of relief when he and Harriet successfully escaped to an obscure muggle town that his omega apparently knew somewhat well.
She rose from the sofa and walked over to the writing desk next to the bed. She stared down at the letter that she and Draco had received that morning and she paused to think.
Draco struggled not to purr as the toddlers fondly pulled on the collar of his suit and used their tiny hands to pat his face.
“........In our nest?” Draco answered in a soothing purr, nipping softly at Harriet’s lips.
Draco began to stroke the back of Harriet’s knuckles and she felt a surge of want bloom in her lower belly as she and Draco moved closer together on the couch.
Draco had slept a solid, uninterrupted four hours, which was the longest he and Harriet had gone without each other since the first night of their stay at the beautiful island.
He thought at first that she may be wearing perfume but as he leaned his face towards her more, he noticed it was her scent he smelled, raw and natural, the scent of his mate~.
Harriet sighed as she crawled out of her nest and placed a hand on her belly.
“If the baby’s real, then Harriet will need lots of help. We’ve helped all these years, we’ll help her some more.” Hermione decided, “We can’t just leave her alone, Ron!”
He placed the book back on the shelf and quietly returned to his room. A frown creased his handsome face as his grey eyes fell on Harriet while he gently closed his bedroom door.
They had been growing closer and closer to one another, or at least, he thought they had. Surely that wouldn’t all be thrown out the window as soon as the baby was born?
The plan that Hermione and Ron had assisted Draco with was tedious and subtle.
Harry thought it was lovely. Though he had been frequently annoyed by Dobby in his youth, the house elf was rather talented when he wasn’t cowering in fear.
Draco smirked victoriously.
“For the baby.” Draco explained with a smile.
A proud grin spread across Draco’s pale face as he pulled the covers over them both and let Harriet stay nestled against him while he closed his eyes as well.
Narcisss Malfoy was more than ready to hold a grandbaby in her arms.
It was over, he had it.
Harriet’s fiancé was busy dusting himself off in an attempt to straighten out his black suit that had wrinkled during their impromptu trip.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Harriet frowned as she listened to Draco and tried very hard to understand his viewpoint.
It was almost amusing to the omega. Draco wasn’t asking out of stupidity. The look on his face was genuine and full of wondrous curiosity.
With only a year’s difference in their ages, the Malfoy siblings often had many disagreements, but they remained each other’s primary playmate and best friend.
Harriet knew she should have felt a sense of relief as she watched the baby start to nurse exactly like she and Draco had been instructed during their classes, but as she stared down at her son, she was pulverized by a crushing, unavoidable sense of deep and horrible despair.
It wasn’t that he blanched about the prospect of the delivery, but he was terrified that they wouldn’t make it to the hospital and that his darling or his baby may suffer an unforeseen issue.
Harriet barely remembered handing the snitch to Oliver Wood, she had forgotten all about her bet with Draco, or who was supposed to have been the better flyer, the better player……
“Mr. Malfoy, sir…..” The house elf began, “The healer’s here to see you.”
It was a complicated thing in the wizarding world to perform genetic tracking magic.
The next morning came and Draco blinked at the ray of sunlight that spilled into the room through the slit in his damask curtains.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
While Harriet sat, nibbling on her gelato, a man and woman happened to pass by the windows of that small shop.
Draco had come and asked the muggles nicely to back away from his baby. He had even offered to compensate them as well. If neither of those strategies worked, then he felt he would have no choice but to use magic against them.
When they passed by a nursery window and Draco caught a glimpse of all the newborn babies swaddled in their tiny cots, he knew they were getting close.
She didn’t understand why she spent the rest of the day crying.
The alpha sneered as he hissed, “Thank goodness, Potter. This manor would have been flooded with letters if you hadn’t told them I wasn’t holding you prisoner.”
First her tiny head, then her little ears, then her shoulders, her hips…...
“Lily!” Harriet chastised her daughter with a scowl, “Don’t hurt him!”
Women often forgot the depth of labour pain.
She was proven wrong when they found out a second little one would be joining their household.
Her fingers clutched the soft blankets of her nest that she was safely cuddled in as she unconsciously squeezed Draco so tightly with her legs that he began to wonder if that may be the end of him.
“Quaint” was not a word used positively in the Malfoy household.
If she needed nothing, he would stare at her until she fell back asleep.
—————————————————————
With a huff, Draco dared to open her eyes.
Harriet threw her alpha an unamused scowl.
The Malfoys….the Malfoys wanted to have dinner with her?
Hermione and all of her coworkers had told her how much better she would be feeling by that point.
To Draco’s irritation, not every detail had been remembered or recovered but what he sought was there.
She was very pleased with how suddenly accepting Draco seemed of the muggle world. The pregnancy hormones flooding her veins were suppressing any suspicion she may otherwise have held about his eagerness.
“Oh….I needed to fetch something from the parlor.” Draco fibbed.
At the last glance she had taken, Harriet had seen Draco still standing at the order counter and that gave her hope.
Granger and Weasley,
Lucius’s greatest mistake was only siring one son and Draco had better not commit the same error….
Together, the Malfoy family happily shared the first year of Scorpius’s life.
She had thought it was never going to happen or perhaps she had gotten the days mixed up, but it had happened, at last, it happened!
“......But I want you to claim me now.” Harriet pouted.
Besides, Draco wanted to watch over Harriet and Scorpius both and he couldn't do that very well in two different rooms simultaneously, even with magic.
—————————————————————
The midwife and healer eventually did knock on the door and Draco gave them permission to enter with a single call, “Come in!”
“You’ve never mentioned it before.” Harriet huffed as she crossed her arms, “We’ve never taken care of a baby, either, until now. It’s a novelty, that’s why you think you want children.”
It was on that facet that Harriet sought to surprise her alpha.
Draco’s hands were extra gentle around Harriet’s back, belly, and breasts, the places he knew that she was the most tender.
Her pink lips seemed so kissable that Draco smiled bittersweetly at the barrier that existed between them.
“Are you nervous?” Hermione asked Harriet as she sat beside her while they watched Ron and Scorpius.
The long-anticipated Malfoy wedding was little more than a large, formal party to Harriet and Draco.
Draco was wearing his most muggle-appropriate suit, which was simple and black, hoping that it wouldn’t draw too much attention.
While Harriet was busy getting ready for the night, Draco opened up a secret compartment in the bottom drawer of his ornate dresser, removed the velvet ring box that lay within, and slipped that little box into the inner pocket of his jacket…...
“What about the baby?” Ron asked.
“No.” The healer snapped.
Draco wasn’t trying to be cruel to Harriet, but he had run out of ideas.
Draco had no idea who else was waiting on him there too…
Scorpius whimpered softly and Harriet bent down to kiss his tiny, round head as Draco asked, “Tell me, Potter, what do you think of this one?”
As he watched the rise and fall of the oncoming waves, Draco felt himself begin to relax.
One morning though, as Draco sorted through the mail that had been brought into his damask office at the headquarters of Lucius Malfoy’s company, he frowned curiously at a strange letter amongst the pile of bills and notices.
Years Unknown
“Everything looks good and healthy.” The muggle doctor announced to the couple once she was finished. Before she removed the wand from Harriet’s abdomen though, she gave the couple an option.
Harriet saw her husband’s eyelids flutter and she took a breath as she decided what she would do.
“Very well.” Hermione nodded, boldly choosing to answer for herself and Ron, much to her lover’s chagrin, “We’ll help you propose to Harriet.”
Although there was the slight glint of disappointment in Narcissa’s eyes when she found out that she had not received a blonde little girl to dress up in Slytherin-esque frocks, Draco had never seen Lucius’s pale face glow with such pride as it did when he gazed down at the youngest Malfoy.
Draco’s hand wandered down to proudly splay over her belly as he thought.
Draco Malfoy woke alone in his grand, canopied bed. A year after the conclusion of the war, his mother and father had managed to pay off the rest of their Azkaban sentences with money instead of time and the Malfoy family had recently been reunited.
“I’m starving!” Harriet admitted with a laugh.
“For mating with Malfoy?” Hermione asked, “Harriet haven’t we always been there for each other? We would have stood beside you, we would have helped you. Promise me you won’t ever do this again?”
As soon as the healers had left, Draco pulled Harriet into his arms.
Despite the discomforts that her cycle brought, Harriet genuinely enjoyed being so close and so tightly bonded to her alpha.
“You said at first that I wasn’t your mate. Remember that?” Draco asked as he pulled out his wand.
“Very well!” The man said as he opened up the envelope that he held and ordered the couple, “Kindly take each other’s hands and face one another, if you will.”
“Oh, really?” Draco scoffed, “You still think you’re a better seeker than I am, eh, Potter?”
“Um, sure…..yes, I’m fine.” Harriet nodded.
“So…….how do I go about that?” Draco asked.
“So what?” Harriet frowned.
Conversation was very difficult. Even if the situation had been different, the Malfoys had very little to discuss with a member of the Potter family, especially the Girl Who Lived, but Narcissa was trying.
“Alright.” Draco nodded, “Is there anything I can do to help you? Is there anything I can get for you? Or bring you?”
“That's good.” Harriet replied.
Draco moved his hands down her sides until they came off of her torso and gripped her soft thighs instead.
The Malfoys had been served by the same healer for decades. Now an elderly woman, she was stern but kind. Draco was positive that the family healer would be able to help Harriet just as well as the staff at St. Mungo’s and much more than a group of ordinary muggle physicians.
As one who served a prestigious wizarding family, Healer Marigold made it a point not to get entangled in the Malfoy family’s member’s personal affairs.
Draco’s sneer immediately twisted into a scowl of concern as he asked, “......What’s the matter?”
And Harriet’s family……
“Thank you…….You look very handsome.” Harriet nodded in approval as she walked over to her mate, placed her hands on his chest, and looked up into his eyes.
Harriet ended up sitting on the side of the bed, with her legs dangling down towards the floor while she groaned through another pain.
He was unable to disguise his grin as he handed the baby over to Draco and kissed her lips softly.
Harriet swallowed and paused to consider the best way to respond.
Before he could control his hands, he placed his open palms possessively over his mate and Harriet sighed at the sensation as she scooted herself up and let Draco nuzzle her soft mounds.
“We don’t need to move her to St. Mungo’s now?” Draco asked worriedly as Harriet’s grip on his hand tightened.
Draco smirked at his mate when he heard her back down from her stubborn stance and willingly acknowledge the fact that a break from the stress of her career had been needed.
He wrapped his arms around his wife and grit his teeth as he struggled not to explode.
Draco didn’t want Harriet to think that he was some kind of deviant, so he had tried to be respectful about his unspoken new feelings that he was certain would be most unwelcome.
—————————————————————
“You seduced the Potter girl once, Draco.” Lucius remarked, “Sure you can manage it again, this time, do not let her go so easily.”
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy!
“You mean…...you want us to go to muggle shops?” Draco blinked.
He was real.
Draco was trying to memorize every word.
“Need you to marry me….” Draco huffed.
Draco frowned in disgust.
—————————————————————
He sat up quickly and grimaced when he felt how sore his back and neck were from sleeping in the hard, unforgiving rocking chair all night.
Draco’s wife looked forward to the occasion.
Once Harriet was finished, she picked up her wand and laid it against the parchment. Murmuring under her breath, a small light burst from her wand tip and turned the corner of the letter a very distinct shade of blue, which Harriet knew that Hermione would recognize.
“..........No.” Harriet replied without looking at her alpha.
“WWWWAAAAA!”
Scorpius did fine.
Harriet’s sobs gradually lessened as she enjoyed being wrapped in Draco’s embrace, leaning against him. Harriet closed her eyes and allowed herself to inhale, taking her time to savor the soothing scent of the alpha that she continued to deny.
“Hello.” Hermione nodded to her former enemy.
Draco sat alone at the table.
Admittedly, Harriet almost thought she was in heat the next morning, when she woke up cuddled so closely to Draco in their cozy, temporary home.
Hermione sighed and took her friend's hand in hers as she looked at the omega across from her and asked, “Harriet, if he’s like that all the time, how can you possibly be relaxed? I’d have lost it if Ron acted like that.”
That would be another upcharge.
“Well, then, try harder, Potter. I don’t like delayed gratification.” Draco retorted.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
The atmosphere became even more uncomfortable at that affirmation. Ron stared at Harriet and Draco but Hermione pushed to try and reach Harrirt as she asked, “Well, how…..um, how are you doing?”
Any unfortunate employee who crossed paths with Draco would be trapped listening to an update of how baby Scorpius was doing and viewing photographs of the infant for a minimum of twenty minutes.
“Yesterday. They promised they’d send an entire team of reporters.” Lucius sniffed arrogantly.
Draco knew he was certainly ready to, but Harriet apparently was not.
That would be an upcharge.
Where was that?
Draco looked down at his plate and cleared his throat.
“Mother’s milk is the healthiest for infants. I’ve read that over and over again. You could stay a little while…..to recover of course, but to feed the baby too.” Draco slyly suggested.
Food would be a good excuse to leave the house.
He didn’t really know what kind of scenario or setting that Harriet would approve most of for him to ask her one of the most important questions in her life.
He walked down another hallway before he stepped into the room that was closest to his and Harriet’s.
Across the street on another bench, there was a young mother cradling a very new, very pink baby.
Wizarding elevators did provide a much gentler ride than those in the muggle world.
Dr. Krause smiled at her patient and Draco as she spoke, “We’ll send your results over, Harriet, but I didn’t see any problems. I trust you two are getting ready to meet your new addition? The nursery’s set up? You’ve signed up for classes?”
“I thought that’s what you wanted!” Draco exclaimed, “That’s what you said!”
Obeying the primal command that issued from somewhere deep within her, Harriet leaned forward and parted the cover on the carrier.
“Breathe, Potter! Breathe!” Draco cried over Harriet.
As Harriet began to zoom around the stadium, she gripped her broom with white knuckles. A strangled gasp escaped her lips as she narrowly avoided a raging bludger by dodging out of the way just before it slammed into her face.
What a revolting turn of events.
“She’s perfect, love.” Harry whispered, “You did so well!”
“A while, yet.” Harriet argued.
“Hello, Rose.” Harriet said with a gentle smile as she looked down at the infant who blinked up at her with wide, green eyes, “Do you remember me? I’m Harriet. I’m a friend of your mummy and daddy’s and I’m going to look after you until they come home.”
Rational thoughts had all but disappeared from her mind.
Instead of the fulfilling pressure of their bodies joining together, Harriet’s eyes popped wide open when she felt a feather-light, teasing flick against the sensitive bundle of nerves at the crest of her womanhood.
Silently, she admired his chiseled torso and the lean muscle on his elegant arms.
“Do you have a ring yet?” Hermione asked Draco haughtily.
Draco wanted a paternity test…..
Once they arrived in the middle of Draco’s bedroom, he was startled when he looked down at Harriet and saw her wiping away tears that fell from her eyes.
With a nervous grin, Draco respectfully withdrew his trousers from the nest and took a step back.
“Potter! What’s wrong?!” Draco demanded, seeing Harriet huddled in bed with tears pouring down her cheeks, “What’s the matter?! Are you in pain?!”
“Malfoy.” Ron nodded in forced politeness.
“If they grant you custody,” Mr. Roberts continued, “Then the process will be cancelled and the child will be placed in your care.”
“Yes, Draco. Hermione and Ron can’t take a baby with them where they’re going. It’s fine…..Rose is an infant, not a lion.” Harriet replied with a glare.
By her tenth week, when the midwife informed the couple at her check up that she had actually lost weight, Draco squeezed Harriet’s hand.
However, as Harriet looked around, she nodded silently to herself.
The healer hadn’t given instructions on the matter mentioned specifically, but in Harriet’s current, weakened condition, Draco knew that making love was most likely not a good idea.
“Actually, Weasley,” Draco nodded at Ron, “I did try asking her outright. She thwarted my efforts and I never got the chance, but as I sat there afterwards, I pondered the setting I chose and I don’t think she would have cared much for it anyway.”
“‘Everything?’” Draco sneered, “Tell me what is ‘everything’, father? Feeding me and Potter to the media so we be swallowed down like candies? Plastered across the pages of the news? Harriet hates the press and-”
Lucius raised an eyebrow, “That you cannot allow.”
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Harriet and Draco often mused about what great, even if only unintentional, things their son had already done.
An hour and a half later, the baby woke and nursed, his diaper was changed, then after he drifted back to sleep, Draco and Harriet closed their eyes again.
Draco scowled at first until he saw the glossy photos that the box contained.
Draco shockingly matched Harriet’s efforts on all of those matters.
Draco’s outburst began to upset the women in class and nervous murmurings broke out as Harriet’s peers began to express their qualms about potentially having to undergo the surgery.
Accountants?.........In the muggle world?
Harriet clamped her legs around Draco and cried out, clutching onto him for support when she hit her peak as she felt him spill himself within her.
When Harriet looked down and noticed that the very top of her cleavage would be exposed to Draco’s view if he stood nearby, she understood why he had chosen that particular dress for her to wear on their special, private night.
Both of his parents were more than relieved when he started to sleep all the way through the night.
One evening, as Draco sat on the small sofa in their bedroom, kissing Harriet fervently while he tried to maintain his composure as she clawed at his shirt, a thought entered his mind that saddened him just a bit.
So then, the elation he felt as Harriet kissed back in silent acknowledgement of their loving tryst, was immeasurable.
After a moment, Draco looked back out in that same direction and asked with a mirthless chuckle, “........How have you done it, Weasley?”
He saw the awe and fascination in Harriet’s face as she stared at the little baby across the street.
Didn’t she want that Malfoy to have a place on the portrait wall beside his father and ancestors?
She took her birth control pill at the same time every night, but she rarely took them in the lavatory.
With a dry swallow, Harriet shakily pulled her toothbrush out and gripped the porcelain sink while a cold sweat broke out over her skin and her stomach ominously turned.
—————————————————————
“That’s not what I said!” Harriet snapped.
Draco had carried out his errand with Ron and Hermione before Harriet and Scorpius woke from their afternoon nap.
Draco hovered over Harriet once they had finished, sweat gleaming on his skin as he dipped his head down and nipped at her breasts, laying his face against her chest to enjoy the strong beating of her heart.
A quarter of an hour later, Harriet sat with Draco at a table in a private corner of the finest eating establishment in Britain’s wizarding world.
Good.
————————————————————
When the Hogwarts Express pulled away a few moments later, Scorpius waved out the window to his family with a bright smile as he departed towards the beginning of his magical education.
Draco was instantly awakened by the sound.
Would he ever be able to do that again?
It seemed endless to him, the amount of people that Lucius and Narcissa deemed necessary for the event, the chefs, the planners, the decorators, the bakers, the endless array of supposedly vital services…...
The wooden sign hung proudly outside.
She rummaged around until her arms were full of Draco’s clothes, which she then piled on the bed.
Harriet shrugged, “I feel fine.”
She was certain that if her alpha had been there, he would have noticed the inexplicable shift in her scent.
“You’d hardly be imposing.” Draco mused quietly.
He had spent the previous half an hour skimming through articles on the best way to hold a baby.
While Draco was in the bathroom, Harriet pulled herself out of her nest and walked over to open the door. She peered into the hallway and called out when she saw Narcissa’s figure walking away.
If it was nine months, after all.
The cashier couldn’t help but notice the soft look in Draco’s disguised eyes as he placed a gentle kiss on top of Harriet’s head, nor could the woman ignore the way Harriet sighed and instinctively leaned back against Draco.
Draco had no intentions of waiting any longer than necessary.
“Name?” The woman asked abruptly.
Harriet Potter.
Draco’s scowl remained on his face as he threw himself down against the pillows that were fluffed up behind him.
A week passed by more quickly for Draco than Harriet. As the pregnant omega entered her third trimester, she noticed that her belly grew heavier and her body became more fatigued.
Harriet’s green eyes were full of pride as she watched her two blonde boys.
“I’ve watched her diet and monitored her water intake!” Draco roared in defiance at the healer, “She sleeps well at night! She’s comfortable at home, she’s-“
Harriet bent over the bassinet and felt her nipples threaten to leak as she scooped her son up into her arms.
Draco knew instantly that he had made a mistake.
His bed, usually expertly made with the finest sheets and duvet available, was rumpled and disheveled.
She resigned herself to the fact that he would probably pout until he discovered what she had done.
As Draco’s shiny, black shoes clicked across the marble floors while he approached the bedroom, Harriet writhed in her nest.
Draco didn’t care that everyone, including his wife, warned him it was far too early for that.
“Hello.” Harriet murmured, barely stopping as she swished past him and made her way towards the door.
Draco was, in fact, pouting, but not only out of pride, out of genuine disappointment that he would never have the opportunity of family life that he so desperately wanted, or at least he thought.
“I wasn’t talking about the baby being real, Hermione.” Ron said in a voice that was so serious, Hermione stared at him with her eyes narrowed.
Draco gasped in disbelief as she looked down at her small daughter, gazing into her green eyes, in awe of how alert the newborn was.
It was blurry without his glasses, but Harry didn’t mind.
Draco didn’t like the self righteous look on her face.
Harriet was very happy that she was still nursing Scorpius because she was fairly certain that if her little one had already weaned, entire days would pass where she wouldn’t even have the opportunity to see her baby.
Rising numbly from his seat in the pub, he paid his bill, and left to wander aimlessly through the streets of Hogsmeade, apparating home late that night in time for dinner.
“-You know what I meant!” Draco snapped as he looked over at whom he had always considered an enemy, “I’ve done everything I can! Potter agreed to work with me, but her body has different ideas, apparently.”
Work, to free herself from pain, that’s what Harriet had to do.
Draco glared at her but Hermione swallowed back the tears that gathered in her eyes as she pleaded with him, “Draco, she’s my best friend! Surely you can understand that! I only want to sit with her for a while! I promise I-“
“I want to.” Draco nodded.
“Here, support her head like this, keep your arms firm like this….” Harriet guided her husband as she taught him how to hold an infant.
“Malfoy! I said Harriet Malfoy!” Draco bellowed.
That was it and he knew it, she was frightened.
“Going to finally let me meet my daughter today, Malfoy?” Harry teased with a hopeful grin.
Draco would have much rather cuddled his baby.
Draco…....holding her?
“We’re going to do as Draco asked.” Narcissa informed her husband.
Ron and Hermione both stood waiting to hear what she had to say, but as Harriet’s gaze flickered back and forth between the shocked, hurt looks on her friends faces, she was overwhelmed by guilt.
As Harriet blew out a breath, the new grandmother gently lifted the little bundle out of Harriet’s arms to leave the omega free to grab Hermione and Draco’s hands.
He liked healer Marigold.
“Hello, my princesses.” Draco chuckled as he grinned at his twin daughters.
“Good afternoon.” Draco chuckled in response.
They had a baby and he and Harriet didn’t.
There were no breast pumps in the wizarding world and Harriet didn’t ask her alpha to go to the muggle realm to secure one for her, so she remained in charge of Scorpius’s feedings.
He trusted healer Marigold.
Harriet couldn’t get comfortable in bed that evening and it didn’t help that Draco kept staring at her scrutinizingly.
Trying to win the battle her emotions were waging against her, Harriet reached out to the end table and picked up another letter she had received about a week ago.
“You look gorgeous.” Harry said with a smile, gazing down lovingly at his wife.
Whispers began to fly about why the most eligible, pure-blooded bachelor was shopping in a woman’s boutique, but Draco ignored the murmurings of the bystanders close to him.
He and Harriet had been having such a lovely moment….
However, as Harriet and Draco walked back down the wooden pier on the morning of their departure, ready to apparate home, they were holding hands with their fingers entertained.
The Roberts Family
Harriet wasn’t someone who was particularly interested in jewelry, but even she had to admit, the ring that her lover had chosen for her was beautiful.
As long as he had Harriet, that was enough.
Draco’s door creaked open and Narcissa peered into the room.
“No, I wasn’t suggesting that.” Harriet replied with a shrug.
It was Hermione’s turn.
Satisfied?
“Nothing’s wrong, Draco darling…..” Narcissa replied, “But you two need to get dressed! All the bakers have come early. We’re waiting for you downstairs.”
“She collapsed, mostly from, as I said, exhaustion. We had trouble waking her.” The healer nodded at Draco.
Fortunately, though, her body showed her a bit of mercy.
He wouldn’t!
Her alpha had been right about one thing, Draco Malfoy always got what he wanted.
His smirk faded when he thought back to their gelato outing. Unconsciously, he tightened his grip on Harriet when he thought about the fear in her eyes and the way Weasley and Granger had cornered his poor mate. Draco knew that Harriet had been in no danger of physical harm from her friends, but that didn’t quiet his instincts or the urge to protect his pregnant lover. He struggled to suppress a low growl at the thought, frightened it would wake Harriet, when a knock sounded on his door.
“Good.” Harry said with a chuckle of approval. His fingertips began to trace over her swollen womb as he went on, “Two days overdue, it’s about time…..When did it start, love? Do we need to go ahead and-“
“Perhaps you should wait a moment before you dress, to be sure.” Draco urged his omega anxiously.
…….Unless you finally feel like responding?
Draco carried his little ones out of their nursery and across the hall. He mumbled under his breath and handlessly opened the door to his and Harriet’s bedroom.
“What’s happened to her?!?”
Harriet Potter may have been the Dark Lord’s vanquisher and she may have had a mother who was muggle born, but……
Harriet, Ron, and Hermione all blinked as Draco stomped across the room, threw open the door, and walked outside.
With a deep sigh as if it were a great bother to him, Draco reluctantly took his omega’s hand and stood from the bed with a frown.
After Draco held Rose for several seconds and managed not to drop her, he gained enough confidence in himself to stare down in wonder at the baby.
“What are you doing?” Harriet questioned with a chuckle as Draco shifted.
“Thanks.” Harriet nodded.
It was one of the happiest days of Draco’s life because finally, it would become publicly known that Harriet Potter was irrefutably his~.
“Alright, sir. Can you confirm your wife’s date of birth?” The receptionist asked very calmly.
He didn’t want to disturb her sleep, else, he would have gone over and pecked those plump lips of hers with his own.
“You heard the healers, Draco. I had exhaustion. Thanks to you I’m doing much better now.” Harriet replied with a yawn.
A wide smile formed on Draco’s face and it wasn’t clear if it was from the way that Harriet settled against him again as if it were the most natural thing in life or from the way that she didn’t say anything in protest when he called her “love”, though it was obvious that she had heard him.
“Very well, then.” The man nodded with a smile at the couple, “You two have chosen a beautiful setting to elope! The Isle of Skye attracts many visitors…...Though most people do come during the day….that’s alright! You can see the waterfall better at night anyway!”
“I’m nothing.” Harriet snapped, “I…...brewed an elixir incorrectly and it caused some bloating, that’s all.”
He gave a single command and two house elves appeared in their bedroom doorway a moment later.
Harriet was aghast.
Scorpius let go of Harriet and squirmed in her arms with a whimper as she bounced him gently.
The muggle photographer had done an excellent job of capturing Harriet on film.
When Harriet broke away from their kiss, she looked up at Draco and he gazed down at her.
“Well…….Well, we were told that we were having a girl!” Draco frowned at the midwife, “We bought clothes for a girl….. We’ve prepared a nursery fit for a Slytherin princess! What are we supposed to do now?”
Once the order was totaled and the payment was processed, the cashier smiled at the couple as she remarked, “Congratulations! You both seem so in love, I’m sure you’ll give your little one a wonderful home!”
Draco laid a pair of his trousers down right along the edges of two blankets that Harriet had painstakingly arranged to her liking.
It surprised Harriet how quickly Draco managed to fly up beside her.
She harbored a silent hope.
Draco still remembered the fire that burned in her green eyes as she moved forward and crushed her lips against his.
“Comfortable here, like this?” Harry asked.
“......What do you say to a day of shopping, then?” Draco asked as he bent his head and kissed her cheek.
“Expectant mother’s don’t need to carry heavy packages.” Draco retorted.
“I’m…..alright.” Harriet said weakly as that horrible feeling of lightheadedness gradually passed.
The secretaries’ heads snapped towards the sound and together they dashed into Harriet’s office.
Draco’s desk was heavy, sculpted, and it loomed in front of his black, leather, high-backed chair.
By the time that Scorpius was two months old, it would have been a surprise for anyone who met Draco and Harriet to discover the two of them weren’t married.
As the birth approached, Harriet seemed to become more vulnerable and more needy every day.
—————————————————————
His father’s ideas.
When Harriet stubbornly refused to speak, Draco straightened up and let his manhood proudly protrude from his hips as he reached forward and began to knead her sensitive breasts, intent on teasing her about what she could have if she just let go of her pride.
“Did you order the flowers?” Lucius asked his wife while they packed up their belongings and prepared to leave.
Draco’s smirk lessened as he asked quietly, “Am I hurting you?”
Harriet had been waiting for that moment to come~.
Spicy and sweet, urging him to protect and provide.
She wasn’t protesting his touch, she was expecting it.
“We’ll both play in the game, just like old times.” Draco grinned at his wife, “If Gryfinndor wins, I won’t say another word about us procreating for the rest of our lives, I promise.”
By the time they arrived at their destination, Harriet was laughing so hard that she had to hold her belly.
Harriet sat up and dried her face with her hands as she looked at Draco sheepishly and asked, “Sorry….I’ve…..I’ve been so out of sorts…....”
“....Then move on, Malfoy.” Harriet groaned, still rubbing the sting of pain from her rib.
Draco let out a frustrated sigh of mild amusement as he scooped his weepy omega into his arms.
At intervals, he gently voiced his concerns to his suffering omega but whenever he mentioned anything about her appetite changes, whenever he asked her how she was feeling, or what else he could do to help her, Harriet responded by snapping hatefully at him or bursting into tears.
“I don’t think any of my own friends will know how to please Harriet Potter.” Draco retorted, “My parents are no help on the matter, their marriage was arranged. The closest thing Potter has to any family is……”
There was an unending string of Aurors at the Ministry, and the magical government could always recruit more if need be, but Draco’s baby only had one mother.
Once Harriet was dressed, Ron came back in the room, sat down, and looked on uselessly while Hermione crouched next to Harriet as she worked to corral her friend’s messy, dark tresses into an elegant chignon.
“That’s not what I’m talking about, Ronald! Can you not see this is obviously a bad situation? What if…..what if he’s keeping her prisoner or something?! What if he’s forcing her?! I’m going to owl her tonight and tomorrow and the day after that until she answers me.” Hermione said quickly.
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
“That’s alright…..that’s alright.” Harry said calmly, kissing Draco’s forehead, “Every baby’s different. There's nothing to worry about.”
Harriet was vulnerable.
Draco frowned while he pulled on his pajamas.
“We don’t have anyone here in the emergency department by that name either, sir.” The receptionist said with a smile so sweet Draco wondered if it caused her cavities.
“......it’s…...it’s time….” Draco huffed, her grey eyes widening in horror as she felt another pain build across the base of her spine.
Nothing harmful, of course, but the use of magic would bring the need for more magic to cover his tracks and Draco would prefer a simpler resolution.
He was so worried about Harriet that he barely noticed Hermione was right behind him.
“I want to keep you like this forever.” Draco confessed. That pompous smirk he had worn so often during their school years crossed his face as he went on, “I want to watch you carry my children and have you be completely dependent and reliant on me. I want you to give yourself only to me and let me use you exactly how I want to, touch what I want to, nibble what I want to…....”
“Don’t you think this is a little…...much?” Harriet pressed with a nervous chuckle.
Harriet looked at the healer and the midwife with wide eyes, unable to believe that this was how new mothers were treated, but when they refused to meet her gaze, she stared past them and pleaded silently with Draco.
—————————————————————
Harriet didn’t reply, she was too busy glancing back down to admire her little boy.
He bent and captured her lips with his in a rough, deep kiss, his hands roamed her body, pinching and squeezing her curves as if owned them and finally, finally……..
“You’ve just become a mother.” Draco replied with a soft smile at his darling, “There’s no need to apologize, Potter. Your alpha’s here~.”
The muggle doctor returned a few moments later and presented the couple with the first hazy images of their little one. Harriet looked over them with a soft smile but Draco stared at the pictures in genuine amazement.
Relax, his omega needed to relax.
“..........Yes.” Draco replied as he smirked, “I love you like this, Mrs. Malfoy~.”
“Right, then!” Dr. Krause said cheerily as she picked up a small device, which was connected to the machine by a grey, rope-looking object, “Let’s have a look, shall we?”
“I could eat.” Harriet replied, “But I’m not starving, don't worry about it.”
There came a rare stretch of three consecutive days that Harriet was fortunate enough to get off of work. Draco planned to spend those days cuddling and lounging around with his beloved wife.
“What’s the matter?” Harriet asked immediately when she saw the troubled look on his face.
Harriet’s green gaze bore into Draco’s grey eyes as she declared with absolute seriousness, “I, Harriet Potter, boldly state that you, Draco Malfoy, are bone of my bone and blood of my blood. I give you my body, Draco Malfoy, that we two might be one. I give you my spirit, Draco Malfoy, until our lives shall be done.”
“How’s my pup?” Draco asked anxiously as he sucked in a breath, “Do I still have a pup?”
From Harriet’s obviously pregnant belly to the two gelatos on the table, not one, Ron and Hermione didn’t know where to look or what to think.
A week later, Harriet felt and looked much better.
His rapid pulse crescendoed as the door finally swung open.
“Alright, Malfoy?” Harriet asked.
Anything that Harriet needed or wanted, Draco provided, and he did so with a pleased smirk.
If Harriet had known how much she could basically ignore the child inside her throughout the day, she would have agreed to start a family with Draco a long time ago.
“Can I not take the woman I love out for a decent meal?” Draco asked Harriet seriously.
Draco’s baby.
Perhaps she may avoid the hospital yet…..
Draco lay back against the pillows and Harriet put her head down on his chest. She continued to weep softly while he tenderly stroked her hair and kissed the top of her head.
When he latched back onto her darkened nipples and sucked hard, Harriet winced and looked up, feeling desire flood her core again at the rough contact.
Draco had spent long hours mastering his new skill, but the day that he received the court order to officially request a paternity test from Harriet, he was finally successful at performing the useful spell.
“Yeah……” Draco breathed.
Harriet had forgotten all about the baby.
Draco looked up at the healer with a scowl so serious you would have thought he was facing his own executioner.
“That doesn’t matter, I can tell.” Draco replied.
Draco smirked as he looked up into Harriet’s green eyes and whispered arrogantly, “Do you trust me, Potter?”
It was nearly noon.
Lucius Malfoy would never admit it, but he had seen the head and the arm of his grandchild as well as his wife.
Draco knew that Scorpius would be thrilled to spend a moment in the company of his favorite house elf.
Draco meant well, she knew that.
Draco Lucius Malfoy
When they returned back to Malfoy manor later and found Scorpius asleep in his nursery after being soothed into slumber by Narcissa’s lullabies, Draco seized his opportunity.
It was mostly quiet at first. Harriet dozed on and off while Draco held her. If he saw her wince with pain, he kissed her cheek and cooed gentle words of encouragement to her while his hands gently rubbed her quivering belly.
“NNNNGGGHHHH!”
Draco was trying to quell some of his rage and stifle a bit of his sadness so he could make it through the rest of the visit when the door to the Weasley’s cottage opened behind him.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“May as well and get it over with.” Draco murmured against her skin, “Didn’t realize you were going to make this so much bloody work for me.”
One night, hours before dawn, Harriet’s green eyes cracked open to a familiar sound.
Harriet cooed reassuringly to her friends’ daughter and lifted the tiny baby up into her arms.
Harriet seemed to possess a special knack for ruining important moments.
She waited for a moment and let Draco brood as he stared into the crackling fireplace before she spoke again, “If you could relax, it might be-“
Harriet decided to meet it head on, to crash into that pressure and let it rip her apart as it so badly wanted.
Ron led them over to sit down on the sofa in the small living room as he nodded at them both as he whispered, “Give me just a moment and I’ll be back with some tea. I don’t want to make-“
“I don’t even know where we’re going.” Draco huffed as Harriet finished packing his trunk for him while he sat on the edge of the bed with a scowl.
With a hateful snarl, Draco sneered at the receptionist before he dashed towards the Auror secretary.
That was done and settled.
Draco had been right about her hair and her makeup.
“It’ll be over soon, love.” Draco whispered as Harriet whimpered when he helped her stand to her feet.
Draco couldn’t wait to be involved with the pregnancy and his baby and Harriet’s care….....but he learned an important lesson that afternoon.
He couldn’t hold her back, being an auror was Harriet’s dream.
The morning of Harriet’s ultrasound appointment, she and Draco woke, washed, and dressed before she apparated them to an alley behind the large complex that housed London’s sprawling muggle hospital.
—————————————————————
Instead, Narcissa thought about the probable results from her son’s actions, and that put a smile on her face.
“I beg your pardon, sir.” The receptionist replied as she blinked up at Draco over her glasses, “......But first you’ll need to tell me who your wife is.”
Harriet instantly startled awake but Draco held her close reassuringly.
“Another trying day, Malfoy?” Harriet asked in a voice that was barely above a whisper.
Harriet had imagined that by taking their honeymoon on an island near Greece that she and Draco would have ample amounts of romantic moments between them, but she hadn’t anticipated that the peace that came with their wedding, the gentle, loving reassurance of her alpha, and the calmness of the sea would induce her next heat.
She found Draco sitting calmly on the bed, in a new black suit, lacing up a fresh pair of shiny, leather shoes when he looked up at her and scowled.
Even though he had only seen her naked once before, he remembered every inch of her, every line, every freckle…...
Harriet could feel Draco’s heart thumping in his chest behind her as he watched the muggle doctors reach inside the woman and pulled around on her insides like they were gutting a fish.
Draco instantly began rubbing deep circles in her lower back as he coached her, “Breathe, love, it’ll pass in a moment.”
Draco thought that Lucius had been right.
What he really needed was help.
“That’s odd…...Harriet mentioned something different.” Ron casually replied.
Draco hadn’t been with his lover for a terribly long time but he knew from seven years of observing her and staying by her side those past, lovely few months that Harriet just wasn’t herself.
“Of course I’m not upset, Potter.” Draco replied with a scowl, “All men want sons anyway. Look at him, he’s healthy and strong. He’ll be a fine heir to house Malfoy and house Black when he grows.”
“Draco used to kick all the time too.” Narcissa said with another smile, this one though was bittersweet. As Harriet watched Narcissa Malfoy reminisce about her pregnancy, she saw not a death eater or an enemy, but a mother who was willing to share her memories and her experiences.
He kept smiling at Harriet in a way she found annoying and he continued to berate her each time she woke, went to work, or came home with superfluous questions about her health.
—————————————————————
Harriet knew that once the game began, the noise would intensify to a deafening level.
“Letters?” Harriet asked innocently.
In a very tense quiet, all four of them began to eat their frozen treats.
“This isn’t my home.” Harriet said calmly.
She quickly laid down a galleon on the table to pay for her drink and stood from her seat, “Goodbye, Malfoy.”
Eventually, when the conversation became consumed by the topic of how lovely Hermione and Ron’s family was coming along, Draco could take no more.
The careful attention that Draco showed Harriet, the rest and relaxation she finally allowed herself to receive, and the many hours she spent languishing idly in her alpha’s arms and cooing under the gentle assault of his loving hands, all helped Mrs. Malfoy sail smoothly into her third trimester.
Harriet tapped her fingers against the back of his knuckles to calm him down as his frown turned into an angry scowl, “Every day she wakes up exhausted! She comes home from work exhausted! Look at her! Her color doesn’t look right, something’s wrong!”
He’d already waited long enough, Harry was anxious to meet his daughter.
That was his baby, there, inside his mate’s marvelous belly, round and full and vulnerable, dependent on him to protect. From her ample breasts to her supple thighs, Draco didn’t know where to begin on his omega.
It was early, that meant they had a few minutes before the baby woke.
“That was an accident.” She said quietly, “We made a mistake, Malfoy, everyone makes mistakes.”
He felt secure with the preparations he had made for his wife and child and that left him content to explore the nightly visions that danced through his mind of the family life that was to come.
He offered no reply but as soon as they stepped out of the shower, he dried them both off and covered Harriet’s throat and collarbone in gentle, loving kisses.
It amused him to see the same expression of consternation on his wife’s face.
“Thank you.” Draco nodded haughtily. Harriet scowled up at him from her position on the floor.
Dr. Krause smiled knowingly while she moved the wand around and finished Harriet’s exam. She tried to take her time and let the awestruck alpha have a visit with his unborn child.
When Draco finished speaking, Harriet found herself gasping for air as she looked up at him, but Draco’s smirk changed into a pleasant smile as he continued, “But….. I’m not going to get what I want, and that’s alright, because that’s not the best thing for you….. And you’re not going to get what you want, either, Potter, because that’s not the best thing for our baby. Life is full of sacrifices, darling.”
—————————————————————-
Draco didn’t allow Harriet to kiss him because he knew that if his lips touched hers, they’d never make it to dinner~.
It was a well set trap, Draco had to admit that. Whether his mother and father had laid it on purpose or they had simply misunderstood his current stance with his lover, he didn’t know.
Harriet was always eager to hear her friend’s guidance.
Harriet turned in her nest to face Draco and he reached a hand out to touch her blushing face.
With a heavy sigh, Harriet opened up her alpha’s dresser and went through the closet.
There would surely be rumors afloat after Harriet Potter and Draco Malfoy were seen together out on……...out on…….a date?
—————————————————————
She yawned again, fatigued to her core, despite the lengthy five hours of sleep she had managed the previous night. Draco didn’t listen to his wife’s denial as he knelt down and smiled at her tiny belly as if the baby would see him and smile back.
It was Draco, whom Harriet was convinced she didn’t need.
As the wedding planning dragged on, Draco started to resent the whole process.
When Harriet took her pills, the gory mess was barely noticeable. The cramping and bloating during her heat was miserable.
When Scorpius needed to have his nappy changed, Draco took his baby to the nursery himself, insisting that the house elves wouldn’t lay a scraggly finger on his precious son.
For the most part, anyway.
How was she supposed to breathe with all that cloth covering her airways?
Draco finally closed his eyes when he found peace in one irrefutable fact.
As she lay in bed, Harriet’s heart clenched when she overheard Draco and realized who was at the door.
—————————————————————
Harriet pulled an envelope out of her pocket and opened it as they walked along.
Lucius and Narcissa would be overjoyed.
Harriet lifted the lid and stared down at the dark dress inside before she asked her alpha with a confused scowl, “......Where are we going?”
“Sitting in the best magical restaurant, beside glowing candles and exquisite food.” Draco boasted.
In those awful moments afterwards, Draco remembered the secretary helping him to a nearby bench and sitting down beside him.
On Saturday afternoons, Draco and Harriet sat for their weekly instruction on how to care for a newborn.
A moment passed and Draco kissed Harriet reassuringly until the midwife interrupted again and asked the couple, “Would you two like to know the sex?”
“I’ll break the lease, don’t worry about that……..Tell everyone you’re going on holiday abroad and you’re not sure when you’ll be back.” Draco shrugged.
“That’s right, Scorp.” Harry smiled, chuckling at Dobby’s wide eyes. “Sissy today, or maybe early tomorrow morning. You nearly took that long to come to us.”
Draco clutched Harriet close and watched as she closed her green eyes and drifted off.
The last line that Draco spoke was more emotional than either of them had anticipated and Harriet felt tears water in her eyes as Draco gave her a tense scowl of deep admiration and devoted determination.
Draco tried not to frown.
She didn’t appreciate that her alpha was silently trying to guilt her into scaling back her hectic schedule.
As he moved lower, Harriet instinctively widened her legs in eager acceptance.
As soon as the reporters noticed movement, the cameras began to flash and the quills began to sway back and forth as pictures were snapped and reports were documented.
Draco’s heart sped up as footsteps approached…...
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” She asked Draco quietly.
With his pride and his heart wounded, the alpha held his omega close while they apparated back to Malfoy manor.
Both of them gaped openly at what they saw.
Draco was too busy floating on a cloud of triumph that he had managed to evade his parents for the moment. Allowing Harriet to take the lead, Draco let her order two chocolate gelatos for them and the couple sat down at a small table by the window with their frozen treats.
To his relief, Harriet begged him to do exactly what they both wanted.
With Harriet nestled in his bed, with them both snuggled together, naked, in her nest, after a night of sharing each other’s pleasure, Draco thought he would most likely have no better chance to confess his true feelings to Harriet.
She could have taken every memory he had of their tryst, of the letters, of the baby.
“Where?” Harriet asked with a chuckle, “We can’t just disappear, Draco, not for days, they’ll notice we’re gone…...What are we supposed to do with Scorpius? I can’t be away from him completely for more than about two hours at a time. They’ll definitely notice the baby’s gone. Your mother likes to carry him around like a little girl with her doll.”
There was something he found attractive about the level of confidence that Harriet had demonstrated by having those portraits made in the first place.
“You did well, Harriet.” Hermione complimented her friend with a soft smile.
Draco frowned and looked at Harriet imploringly as he asked, “Potter, if there’s something else you had in mind-“
When their lips barely met, a loud, intrusive growl erupted from the pit of Harriet’s belly and Draco pulled away.
Draco’s gesture was loving and sweet, but Harriet would have much rather had him place his lips elsewhere on her.
“She often doesn’t feel well.” Draco frowned at the midwife as he informed her of his mate’s symptoms, “I’m giving her anti-nausea potion and we go to bed early……..What else can I do to make her more comfortable?”
“If she was, then why wouldn’t she have written to us herself?” Hermione shot back.
At least for a moment?
“Potter, why are you crying?” Draco asked softly.
That particular evening, Draco had barely been paying attention to Lucius’s stern voice as the eldest Malfoy droned on and on.
What was that?
“Does it hurt?” Narcissa asked Harriet quickly as she put her own hands over Harriet’s bump.
Perhaps not.
“I’ve already told you I’m not going to the hospital.” Harriet scowled as Draco worriedly laid his hands over her belly, “The healers and the midwife agreed that there’s no reason why I can’t stay here.”
All Draco wanted was for his darling Harriet to be happy, and of course, for her to become his bride~.
“She’s hiding here, Mother!” Draco went on, “She’ll have the baby and then she’ll leave….sometime...shortly after. She’s going to leave! She’s with me, for now, but we’re not….together! I never said we were a couple in the letter! I never said we were engaged! You both jumped to conclusions!”
During those final weeks, Harriet continued to exchange letters back and forth with her friends every couple of days when she found the energy to write.
Harriet didn’t reply, but she squeezed her eyes shut at the frustrating feeling of emptiness as she wriggled her bottom against him, trying to force Draco to stop his teasing and just give her what she wanted.
Was it…...was it over?
Slytherin had claimed fifty points ahead of Gryffindor.
They made their way inside the hospital’s double doors and as they stood in the sterile hallway, looking at the reception desk while people scurried about, Draco reached out and grabbed Harriet’s hand so quickly that the action startled her.
That was something that Draco had to grant the muggles, they were years ahead in their ways of thinking about…...some matters.
What house would they be sorted into?
“If you’re alright, Harriet, we’ll go ahead and get started?” Dr. Krause asked with a kind smile.
Her smile widened as she glanced around the room.
Draco knew how well his mate loved pleasure.
Love.
Draco was just as anxious as Harriet was to rekindle their intimacy, but he knew what was coming and he wanted the occasion to be…..meaningful.
Draco’s breath hitched as he read over the page.
Yet, a year had passed.
It was a triumph for both Draco’s ego and his heart that Harriet said nothing to protest him addressing her by that sweet nothing.
The couple settled in and curled up in that round bed with the fluffy, soft covers as they lay down to sleep an hour later.
There was no need, she already knew who it was from.
Harriet had been very glad when her old broomstick, given to her by her late godfather, had been recovered after the war.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
“Lucius and I are very glad that you’re here.” Narcissa told Harriet as she stared down at her belly with a happy smile.
How was Draco supposed to protect his mate from the pains of labor if he didn’t learn what Harriet would need him to do?
One afternoon, while Harriet and Narcissa were walking through the Malfoy gardens, showing Scorpius all of the lovely plants and flowers, Draco was inside the manor, hatching a plan which Harriet knew nothing about.
Once the midwife finished helping Harriet with the birth, she cleaned mother and baby, and settled Harriet so that she was resting comfortably with her newborn.
The softness in his grey eyes as he gazed at Harriet startled her.
With a flick of his wand, Draco was able to trace down the additional piece of himself in the world.
She led Draco to the bungalow at the very end of the wooden pier, and when they stood in front of the door, she slid the silver key into the doorknob.
Ron and Hermione both saw the way that Draco’s harsh, grey eyes softened and clouded as he thought of Harriet and his mind seemed to drift off…….
Draco reached over and used his snakehead letter opener to hesitantly slit the sealed parchment and pull out the letter that lay inside.
“You’re supposed to be on holiday!” Ron gasped.
“I know it is!” Harriet snapped.
While the house elves began to scurry in with refreshments for the small, afternoon party, Draco intertwined his fingers with the ones on Harriet’s free hand and whispered, “I know you’ll refuse and I respect that, but I just want you to understand how madly proud I am that you’re mine, Potter~. If it was up to me, we’d have a wedding. A proper, grand wedding.”
He tried not to dwell on the fact that though several, grim minutes passed by, the medical staff did not leave Harriet’s room.
“There are no pixies in the trees.” Draco insisted.
Narcissa sighed as if her son had said something ridiculous and she scowled back, “Draco, this is a wedding. Did you honestly think that we could just use the draperies that are already on the rods?!”
They had listened to the midwife’s advice about not overtaxing her body with another pregnancy.
“Of course.” Narcissa nodded to her son, “We’re in no rush, darling, let her have her rest. I spent a lot of time napping when I carried you.”
Draco’s extreme enthusiasm was actually rather convenient.
While the other players went on without her, Harriet searched and searched.
The first thing she noticed was that the wizarding world’s version of children’s safety locks had been installed on every door, every cabinet, and across every stairway in the house.
Draco’s mouth fell open and his face went slack.
What was she thinking?
“Give me an entire quidditch team~....” Draco growled as he licked the cruel love bite he had placed on his beautiful wife.
Draco tenderly cradled Harriet’s belly as she cupped his handsome face. Daringly, he deepened their kiss, groaning against her when she welcomed him readily by parting her lips, allowing his tongue to explore her mouth.
A very awkward silence passed between the muggle and the former Death Eater until Mr. Roberts cleared his throat and went on, “I’m quite sorry…... but the birth mother we’re working with hasn’t mentioned you at all. She told us the father wasn’t involved.”
Harriet started to pant for breath as she began to bounce on top of him. Through clenched teeth, Draco forced his words out in a husky growl, “If Slytherin wins…...when Slytherin wins…..I’m going to knock you off your broom and put a baby in you right on the quidditch field…….in front of the whole crowd. Do you hear me, Potter?”
Harriet glared at Draco’s hand on her and he removed it.
It seemed to happen overnight.
For the rest of the afternoon, Draco spent his time fussing and cooing over Harriet as they cuddled together in the nest that she had hastily thrown together.
“Good.” Draco nodded.
A few saw Harriet as a traitor and vice versa, but fascination overruled ill feelings among the masses for the most part.
Apparently, muggle law had several differences than the laws of the wizarding world.
Draco wasn’t only interested in his future pups.
She forgot all about her breathing as she reached out to grab Hermione’s hand.
“Who is this girl, Draco?” Lucius asked.
She didn’t even have any difficult assignments at work, but she started and ended each day feeling drained.
Draco noticed that the healer and the midwife had gathered around her.
Harriet curiously stepped down the small hallway.
In the picture, Harriet was sitting on the chair with Scorpius and Draco was standing behind her….....but as she watched, Draco opened up his suit jacket, and held it out so the embossed, white stitching on the jacket’s inside was clearly legible:
“Oh…..” Draco said.
Harriet initially felt uneasy later that afternoon, when Narcissa came to collect Scorpius well before dinner would be served.
He dropped the parchment from his shaking hands and gripped his wand.
Her expression was so strikingly…....vapid.
As Harriet approached the middle of her second trimester, the healers had finally proclaimed her and the baby back on track and clinically healthy, but Draco’s aloof behavior made her feel……..uncertain.
“I was only joking.” Draco defended himself with a smirk.
He deftly moved so that Harriet’s hips were directly over his as he sat up in bed and held her delicately in his strong hands.
Harriet stared down at the photograph on the table in disbelief.
Draco gazed over at his omega intently and waited eagerly to hear her answer.
“Of course, Mother. We’ll be there as soon as she’s ready.” Draco nodded.
Draco didn’t want to crowd her, but he couldn't resist the urge to kiss her cheek in appreciation  as he watched her guide their baby to latch onto one of her fattened nipples.
Lucius had other ideas about what was acceptable talk at the dinner table.
Mr. Roberts looked at his guest apprehensively but Draco drew in a breath and tried to calm himself as he spoke, “She never even told me about the child…..I stumbled upon the news by chance. I have no mate or little ones of my own, you see, but that doesn’t mean I’ve resigned myself to a life of loneliness. I had a chance reunion with the…..mother, recently, and I have no intention of abandoning my son or daughter. Please pardon my interruption of your evening, but I implore you, sir, will you revoke your part in this adoption? If it’s a financial matter, rest assured, I can pay any price.”
Working in the capacity that he did, the officiant knew when he saw a bride and groom truly in love.
“You’re showing!” Draco shouted again.
In both families, Draco was the first to marry in over twenty years…...
Somehow, that made everything more uncomfortable for everyone.
With one hand resting on her belly, Harriet walked down the corridor until she came to the nursery.
Physical intimacy in their relationship hadn’t been lost yet.
—————————————————————
“No, Draco! I’m expected to be at work by eight, I can’t sit around all morning waiting on hypothetical situations that may never be.” Harriet scowled as she stood from the bed, despite Draco reaching a hand out to stop her, and began to rush around while she readied for her day.
Harriet blinked her eyes open moments after Draco had left.
He had to corral his parents and get them to understand some basic principles about his situation, regardless of what they wanted it to be.
Dobby cringed at the loud noise and Scorpius blinked, but Harry was up and out of his seat in an instant, racing out of the kitchen and down the hall.
Neither Draco nor Harriet felt the years as they passed, but to the couple, it seemed terribly soon that their family of four was standing on platform nine and three-quarters, facing the Hogwarts Express.
Through his anxiety, Draco found himself unable to extinguish the happy smile that curled the ends of his thin lips.
On Thursday evenings, Draco and Harriet participated in their prenatal and postpartum class.
With his wand still in his hand, Draco vanished her clothing and left her exposed and gasping on his lap.
She wouldn’t be running away from him in that state~.
Within a day of printing the massively lengthy announcement, every witch and every wizard had learned all about what had happened between Draco and Harriet.
“I don’t need your help or your pity.” Harriet sniffed, “I’ve found a solution, so there’s no need to worry about it.”
Enough work, enough worry, rest.
Harriet read the instructions in the envelope and shook the parcel until a small silver key slipped into her palm.
The wedding officiant cleared his throat and spoke over the whispers of the crowd as he declared, “I pronounce you, man and wife. Now, Mr. Malfoy, you may kiss your bride.”
On the day of the wizarding world’s most highly anticipated wedding, Malfoy manor was in complete chaos.
She didn’t speak a word to anyone as she barged into her office.
Draco closed his eyes as he began to move his hand, recalling with perfect memory the exact pitch of the sharp cries he had drawn from Potter’s throat, after he brought her back to his room and claimed her for his own.
Harriet’s parents were resting in their graves and her dreams of holding back an announcement from Lucius and Narcissa until the right time were thrown right out the window by her overzealous alpha.
Harriet’s words weren’t true, there had to be something he could do to help his love.
“I think I’m going to have to do a bit more than that.” Harriet grinned as she looked down at Draco and let her fingers idly ghost through his platinum blonde hair.
“Rose, this is Draco, my husband. Draco, this is Rose, our little guest.” Harriet said with a quiet chuckle.
Draco looked over at Ron and Ron smiled sadly when he watched the anger and the haughtiness leave Draco’s face Draco replied, “I love her too, Weasley. Why do you think I’m here?”
—————————————————————
Hermione left a little while later and while Harriet took a brief nap, Draco took his son to meet his grandfather.
Lysandria Malfoy - Wife of Abraxas Malfoy
“Relax.” She whispered.
“I don’t think that’s necessary yet, Malfoy.” Harriet gasped as Draco dipped his head and began to place gentle kisses along her collarbone, “Do you want me to have five at once?”
—————————————————————
—————————————————————-
Draco’s kiss was no longer sweet, it was deep and dangerous, and as he sucked on her bottom lip for a moment, Harriet found her mind going into all sorts of lascivious directions, until he pulled away with a gentle, teasing bite~.
“You’re being sued for paternity by a…...Draco Smith? He claims to be the father of your child. He’s asking for a definitive test and it seems the court has already granted him an order to have it performed. If he can prove the child is his and the court deems him a fit parent, then I’m terribly sorry, Miss Potter, but the Roberts family won’t be able to adopt your baby.”
Her heart was light and full and she was nearly on the brink of tears again as she pondered over Narcissa Malfoy’s words.
Would magic be useful?
When Harriet was finally able to purchase her completed pictures, it was all she could do to manage leaving her nest long enough to venture out and complete her transaction.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
She had been back to the toilet twice before she was able to swallow the potion but Draco had stayed beside her the entire time.
Draco shouldn’t have woken alone, he should have woken beside Harriet, his mate, his omega.
Their stay in the distant castle where they had been hosted by one of Lucius’s business contacts had been pleasant, but they were both anxious to get back to Malfoy Manor.
It was only a chandelier, but in that moment to Harriet, the boxes and the chandelier were a complete disaster!
“YOU’RE SHOWING!” Draco exclaimed.
“After the trouble your wife’s had, it’s quite remarkable the baby is unharmed.” The midwife snapped at Draco, “Only a headstrong little woman could survive something like that.”
After the war, he had lost most of his Slytherin friends and as he prepared to take Harriet as his wife in front of a very populous audience, the only soul with him besides the house elves was his father.
“You don’t know if they’re false contractions or not.” Draco retorted, “The healers said on Monday that the baby could come anytime.”
—————————————————————
It improved her focus on the quidditch field.
Draco glanced up at Harriet and held her gaze as he gently took one of her plump nipples directly into his mouth. Harriet gasped sharply as he stroked his tongue over every crevice on the tender little bud before he began to rhythmically suck. He felt the omega rustle against him as a needy whimper escaped her lips. When Draco realized that Harriet had spread her legs to invite him closer, he felt his arousal pulse in his trousers as he curled around her belly, greedily pushing her other heavy, soft breast towards himself.
Harriet smiled at how alert her baby looked.
As the officiant shifted on his feet, Draco let out a sigh and turned towards the man.
“Well? What are you standing there for? Hurry up! My distraction won’t last forever. Open that box there and put on your dress. Be quick about it, will you?” Draco huffed.
Draco was pleased to discover that his omega actually had decent taste. He agreed with most of the decorations and the linens that Harriet chose, his only stipulation was that he preferred shades of green, white, and black.
That simple phrase hurt Draco more than any curse ever could, but he swallowed his tears and held his heart high.
“This is going to be a bit cold.” Amelia warned her patient.
Harriet insisted that all of the house elves who served the Malfoys were freed and allowed to stay on as hired employees, if they wanted. Although it disgusted Lucius, Harriet demanded that the Malfoys’ small workers were treated with at least a civil amount of respect and fair wages.
Growing impatient, Draco unlocked the door with a swipe of his wand and peered inside.
“I would have been glad to help, you know. You should have gotten me up with you.” Draco sniffed.
As he apparated to St. Mungo’s, Draco couldn’t remember a time when he had felt more helpless, not even during the war.
“Do I have enough time to at least brush my hair or rogue my cheeks before we leave?” Harriet asked.
“And I’m not due for another week.” Harriet scoffed.
Harriet opened her arms and Scorpius rushed forward to give her a very gentle, very delicate hug.
—————————————————————
“As you wish, Mrs. Malfoy.” The midwife nodded, “Allow me to prepare your paperwork from today’s visit, then you and your husband will be free to go.”
Harriet sniffed and glanced at Draco hesitantly.
She narrowed her eyes as she walked over to that table and rummaged through the parchments.
As Draco finished speaking, his grey eyes were soft and loving and the gentle way his gaze drifted down to their newborn melted Harriet’s heart.
Yes, he had been correct.
Draco would never know, the wizarding world would never know.
The flat was small but bright.
“Alright, alright…..” Draco said soothingly as he took Scorpius by his little hand and led him back in the house, “You can play with the pixies again tomorrow, how does that sound?”
There were few things as comforting in the world as a slow burning fire.
“My nest is the only place where I feel comfortable at this stage.” Harriet grumbled as Draco stood and draped one of her arms across his shoulders.
“Potter,” Draco said quietly, “Please, make this simple for everyone. All you’re doing is causing pain and chaos. I thought heroes didn’t like pain and chaos?”
That answer wasn’t good enough for Harriet’s alpha.
“Why not?” Ron shrugged to Hermione.
With a frown of irritation,Draco crawled overtop of her and let his ear continue to hover against the area underneath her navel.
His grey eyes widened incredulously as he tried to determine if he was really looking at what he thought he saw printed on those pages.
Draco lifted his hand but right before his lips moved, Harriet spoke.
Draco had lit the fireplace to make sure that Harriet and the baby didn’t catch a chill.
Draco’s heart leapt in his chest when instead of pushing him away again, Harriet placed one of her hands over his own.
Harriet stilled when her head started to throb again. As she relaxed back onto Draco’s bed, she asked wearily, “Why…...Why am I here?......You’ve abducted me.”
———————————————————-
With a few flicks of his wand, Harry cleaned the floor, vanished Draco’s nightdress and panties, assembled some supplies, and sanitized his hands.
While the weeks passed that Harriet had to wait for the photographer to develop and review the pictures, every day the growth of the life inside her brought her closer to bursting with her alpha’s baby.
Silence fell between them as Draco gave and Harriet happily received.
“Of course it does.” Draco replied, “It's our baby.”
As the afternoon gradually passed, Harriet and Draco sat on the Weasley’s sofa and sipped their tea while they chatted with the hosting couple.
Harriet and Draco had rented a quaint estate, far away from wizarding Britain for their honeymoon, and the two returned to Draco’s bedroom only long enough to collect their trunks and Scorpius’s things they were bringing along.
Harriet turned her face back towards the wall and sighed as Draco’s skilled hands continued to massage her gently.
As their son squirmed in Harriet’s arms, something gave Draco peace of mind knowing that it would probably be quite a while before Harriet even considered returning to the office.
Harriet couldn’t stand it, Draco was suffocating her.
The secretary closed Harriet’s door with a thud, and the intrusive noise seperated Draco further from his incapacitated wife.
He could have had three delicious days of watching Harriet squirm and writhe underneath him, in front of him on her hands and knees, against the wall………...but instead he was going to play Daddy to the child of two people he couldn’t stand.
Harriet was much more relaxed, and she spent that evening with only Ron and Hermione.
Harriet liked cuddling with him.
She blinked when she felt something gently push her fingers away.
“Why?” Scorpius asked with large, curious, grey eyes.
Harriet’s eyes widened as her eyes flickered over to Draco for a second before she looked at Lucius and replied, “That’s right, Mr. Malfoy…..We haven’t discussed marriage.”
When Harriet finished reading the letter, her eyes flickered back to Draco and she asked, “How’s this going to shut you up?”
Draco Malfoy refused to accept defeat. As he took his hands off of Harriet’s abdomen and wrapped his arms around her shoulders, Draco promised himself that he simply wouldn’t allow Harriet to reject him.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“He’s our son, Lucius!” Narcissa snapped, looking at her husband with her own eyes narrowed, “That’s my baby boy! I don’t care about the betterment of the family business if it means hurting Draco! I only want to see him happy and this makes him happy! Are you that blind that you can’t see it?!”
Harriet frowned but let him go and cuddled into her blankets.
Gasping in shock, his hand shot out and Harriet whimpered as the alpha who fathered her child placed his hands on her rounded abdomen.
“So then, take a year off, give me a child, and go back to work.” Draco shrugged.
“Why not?” Draco asked Harriet bluntly.
“Look, Potter…...if you don’t want to be with me, that’s fine.” Draco murmured.
And bond.
Under her dress, when Draco’s manhood brushed her innermost thigh besides her panties and felt the wetness there, a growl left his throat as his length quivered impatiently.
Draco had been away for the past three days on a business trip with Lucius and for that, she was glad.
When Draco came to stand in the nursery doorway, he frowned as he watched his mate hold their son in her arms while he slept and she stared forlornly out the window.
He had lost count of the times he had thrust into his mate as they lay cuddled together in her nest.
Draco eagerly nuzzled against the pulse points at the base of Harriet’s neck and closed his eyes to inhale and enjoy that intoxicatingly sweet scent.
Draco groaned softly as he crouched over his mate and eagerly kissed her back, although he was careful not to put any weight on her torso.
Draco kissed Scorpius’s chubby little cheek as his fussy cries gradually stopped and he slowly slipped back into sleep.
Harriet glanced over beside the bed and saw Scorpius still sleeping in his little crib, peacefully dreaming.
“Very well.” The healer said with a sigh that sounded almost irritated, “You may take your leave now, Mr. Malfoy. I have work to do.”
Draco and Harriet were both too needy.
Everyone’s gaze roamed back and forth between Harriet, Draco, and that amazing ring.
“Why do you even want to take those classes anyway?” Harriet fumed at Draco later that night while they readied for bed, “You know they’re muggle classes, right?”
“Can you feel that?” Harriet asked innocently as Draco flattened his palms on either side of her bump.
Harriet shifted on the bed and Draco boldly moved closer, seeing the apprehension about what to do next clearly in her green eyes.
Draco leaned over the counter and whispered to the salesman as he asked, “Can you keep a secret?”
“You’ve had complications!” Draco exclaimed in exasperation as he looked down at his wife and threw up his hands.
Draco and Harriet turned around.
Draco chuckled in a low, velvety sound that issued from his throat as he glanced at the baby, then back at Harriet before he opened his lips and spoke in the commanding way that made his mate shiver, “I want one, Potter~.”
—————————————————————
That morning, Harriet felt achy, heavy, and a bit frightened.
“Shit, Potter……” Draco exclaimed in a husky, breathless gasp as his eyes widened at how impossible wet and accepting and tight Harriet felt.
Draco stared down at Harriet and relished the feeling of her fingertips sliding over his silky shirt for a moment.
“I give you my spirit, Harriet Potter,” Draco said to Harriet and as he spoke, his grip on her fingers tightened, “.........Until our lives shall be done.”
His little girls were his little cream puffs.
Would she still……..
Draco tried to hold back as his omega crammed her curves into his face, assaulted him with her scent, tantalizing and vulnerable all at once…...but when Harriet moved and purposely coupled with her husband, he abandoned his futile attempts at resistance.
Draco covered Harriet in kisses and saw that his mate had all the tea and witch hazel-soaked pads that she needed to aid in her postpartum recovery, but Harriet had it easy compared to most new mothers.
As he lay behind her, Draco’s frown turned into a scowl.
Draco scowled at both of the healthcare practitioners that afternoon and left the room in a huff.
Whenever he woke from one of those horrible dreams, instead of Harriet finding respite in his scent, it was Draco who took solace in hers. He would nuzzle into the crook of her neck and breathe in the smell of the beguiling hormones she released, listening to her heartbeat until he fell back asleep.
When the next contraction crashed into her, Draco couldn’t continue to voice her concern to Harry. Falling dead weight onto her knees, Harry’s expression of happy excitement turned serious when Draco leaned forward and retched all over the floor.
Harriet turned the other way and found Draco also resting in a deep slumber, exhausted from the previous night.
If Harriet continued to be that stubborn about everything, it was going to be a very long nine months.
Harriet’s dress was dark and short, with a flattering fit, and a plunging opening between the high, lace collar, and the sweetheart neckline.
Draco had sent for all of her things so she would have what she needed and feel more comfortable in her new surroundings.
“Few days?” Draco chuckled, “Potter, I’m going to be right beside you through-“
“Have a baby with Malfoy?” Harriet asked with a playful grin.
The wedding planning became much less tedious for the couple after their secret marriage.
There was a flurry of motion around the laboring omega as the midwife, the healer, Narcissa, and Hermione came barging in to help.
“.............Congratulations.” Draco muttered under his breath to Ron as he watched the alpha that he furiously envied sit the tea serving tray down on the table in front of the sofa.
“I, Draco Malfoy, boldly state.” Draco echoed.
Draco woke later in the morning to the demanding sound of someone loudly knocking on the front door.
Under the strict orders and generous tip received from Lucius Malfoy, the midwife who had cared for Narcissa during her pregnancy arrived at the Malfoy residence the following day to examine Harriet.
When Harriet finally began to rustle around, Draco was spooned so closely behind her that her movements woke him as well.
He returned to Harriet’s side in time to take the many different educational parchments and advice booklets that the midwife gave the couple.
“Potter and I are meant to be together, Father.” Draco spoke as he stared determinedly back at Lucius, “Our love doesn’t pay much attention to silly things like ‘common social courtesy’ or the opinions of those not involved.”
—————————————————————
Since she had reached the final weeks before their baby’s arrival, Harriet didn’t have the energy or the desire to do much besides curl around her belly and lay in her nest.
“If you smile for your mother, I’ll give you an extra chocolate after dinner…...” Draco offered.
She realized that he was listening for something…...
Draco’s parents’ return to the manor didn’t make the estate any less lonely for its heir though.
It was going to happen again.
She tried not to go out much, only buying what she needed to survive. Harriet hadn’t been in the public eye often since her impromptu tryst with Draco, but she did occasionally leave her apartment to buy a handful of groceries, wearing long, loose robes that hid her shape.
While-
“No, I’m fine.” Harriet said as she let out the breath she had been holding, “That happens sometimes.”
The war, her and Draco, everything…...
Draco wanted Harriet to be with him forever and Harriet didn’t want to leave, he knew it.
The three were a family.
Carefully, he picked Harriet up into his arms and gingerly sat her down on the floor so that her back was supported by the nursery’s wall.
She said no, but her body was betraying her. Harriet felt her core tingle as she imagined what it might be like to carry Draco’s children. Her cheeks started to blush when she thought about how pleased her alpha would be with her and how adorable their chubby, little babies would be as they laid at her breasts.
What had she wanted?
They had already had their day, their moment, their special, meaningful ceremony.
Draco removed his shirt, shoes, and trousers to change into the shirt and slacks that he preferred to wear when he lounged.
“Shall I tell them you’re coming back to work tomorrow?” Draco teased in the same haughty, arrogant tone that Harriet had heard him use so often during their youth.
Would Draco finally try to seduce her again?
He watched as the creature led Scorpius down the hallway towards where Lucius and Narcissa sat waiting at the dining table.
The nursery was ready.
“You may not admit you’re mine, Potter, but please…..let me care for you?” Draco asked gently.
Their kiss was long and languid and genuine…...and Harriet mourned the moment when Draco finally pulled away.
In her misery of heated cramps and empty want, Harriet tried to focus on just how pleased Draco was going to be when he walked through the door and found her in such a state……...
Harriet frowned, “Draco, I-“
Prenatal and Postpartum: What to Know
Unfortunately, Harriet’s friends seemed to have other ideas.
“Then tell me what I should do instead!” Draco commanded with an impatient scowl.
Instead, he pulled a very old volume from the ebony shelf and opened it up. He scowled in concentration as he skimmed over its pages.
The healer and Draco exchanged icy glares before she eventually yielded, turned, and followed the midwife out of the room.
Harriet was sitting comfortably amongst the blankets and pillows with her hair brushed and a clean nightdress on. The nest on Draco’s bed had been sanitized, refreshed, and the tiny baby was diapered, clothed, and swaddled in a warmer blanket as he lay in his mother’s arms.
They climbed into Harriet’s nest before Draco covered them both with a blanket, took one of her fattened nipples into his mouth, and began to nurse gently while he kneaded the swollen gland.
Harriet didn’t glance over at Draco in the bed but she tried to move without disturbing her alpha while shuffled over to the bassinet where her little one lay waiting for her.
“It’s not a guarantee that conception will happen during a heat, you know that as well as I. You were in health class with me in sixth year.” Harriet chided quietly.
The stubborn omega trudged through her days until her nausea abated without help from Draco’s potion.
Harriet watched apprehensively as Draco withdrew his wand and raised it towards her, “Since it’s only bloating, then I suppose I’ll stupefy you so we can finally have a little chat.”
After all, graduation did not absolve one from one’s loyalty to one’s Hogwarts house.
“Do you want a child to grow up like this?” Harriet asked Draco seriously.
Were both of them…….gone?
The following day, after the Auror department employees had all left the hospital, wishing their coworker and her husband well, Draco was permitted to take his two ladies home.
Draco wanted to make sure that their pup was able to nestle properly in its mother’s womb.
With a frown, she stared back at her alpha defiantly.
Draco frowned when he heard her sniffle and watched her start to cry, “What’s the matter, love?!”
It slightly annoyed him that he had to do so at all, though, hadn’t his actions so far proven to her the true desires of his heart?
Draco’s grey eyes shot wide open as he looked at Hermione. Wordlessly, he turned and raced down the hall towards his mother’s voice.
She smirked against him arrogantly, confident that she had her alpha wrapped around her little finger.
Harriet laughed and went on, “It’s not certain that it will or won’t happen during a heat or not, heats just make it more likely. We’re still young, Draco, we have plenty of time.”
He would leave the nest up to his omega.
“What don’t you understand, Draco?! I don’t want them to have anything to do with the wizarding world!” Harriet cried, “I don’t want them to have to live through the ugliness that we have!”
The photographer quietly walked up behind Harriet’s alpha and slipped an extra, very special, picture that he had captured into the hand that Draco held behind his back.
Harriet answered in a spine-tingling scream.
Shakily, she walked over to the bed and opened the dark grey box that was sitting on top of the duvet.
They barely heard the words that fell from their own lips, they were only for ceremony anyway, Harriet and Draco had already pledged their oaths to each other.
She used spell after spell to clean the room from the ceiling to the floor.
Harriet and Draco looked at each other in wonder.
Died in Childbirth
…..And her hand was still tragically on her side.
At that moment, all Harriet wanted to think about was the incredible, gentle affection her alpha lavished upon her and the way he was driving her so cruelly towards blissful release~.
They were certain the plan they had devised would work and Draco trusted their judgement as Harriet’s best friends.
The way that she smiled when she looked at him…..
“WWWWAAA!”
A soft smile played across Draco’s lips as he nodded, “Of course! You know I do, I’ve been waiting for this.”
“No………” Harriet replied with a saddened sigh of acceptance, “There’s nothing you can do at all to help me, Draco.”
Harriet’s laugh rang out in the room. It was a jovial, deep sound of genuine mirth as she replied arrogantly, “Draco Malfoy, I am ten times the flyer that you will ever be! Everyone knows that.”
“Do you want me that much?” Harriet asked as she walked over towards Draco and laughed as he tried to push his chair back even further to escape her.
“WWWWWAAA!”
Together?
The alpha felt pride swell in his heart as he looked down at his tiny son and admired his chubby little cheeks and the fluffy tufts of platinum blonde hair that lined his head.
As the days wore into weeks and weeks melted into months, Draco celebrated each of Scorpius’s milestones with an enthusiasm that rivaled even Harriet’s and his parents’.
Draco was growing frustrated at his omega’s apparent determination to ruin all of the surprises for the night as he huffed and sighed, “Potter……”
She stepped away from her post, ready to work as she asked the omega, “Tell me, does your alpha…...like you…...like this?”
He smiled when she cooed and burrowed against his side.
“As am I.” Draco agreed as he turned and pecked Harriet’s cheek, earning a laugh from his wife when Lily made a noise of disgust at the sight and the sound.
The walls were a deep shade of emerald green, embossed with black filigree.
Draco had in his hands the literary form of the Malfoy family tree. The book contained data that was centuries old, but its original had been destroyed in a fire before the first wizarding world war.
Please send your reply as soon as possible.
What was the healer doing to help?
Harriet frowned in aggravation while she opened her eyes and saw her loving alpha already wrapped around her.
“.....Sure.” Harriet blinked.
As they both came down from their orgasm, Draco didn’t bother to remove himself as Harriet kissed his lips playfully again before he bent his head to nibble teasingly on her plump nipples.
“-What do you mean if they grant me custody?” Draco cut in, narrowing his eyes.
When Draco came down from his fleeting peak of pleasure, he looked over at the empty spot in the bed beside him and scowled.
“Malfoy……” Ron said as he blinked over at his friend’s husband, “You and Harriet have been married a long time now, surely you must know a few positions at this-“
And the night before…….
Draco was busy showing off his skills by leisurely helping the Slytherin chasers knock the quaffle past Gryffindor’s keeper, but Harriet ignored him and focused on her task.
Draco licked his lips when he realized that delicious smell was coming from his beloved~.
“What’s that, Malfoy?” Harriet answered after they kissed briefly before he pulled away.
Draco’s long, light blonde hair never tangled, no matter how she rolled in bed at night. Her grey eyes were particularly bright that morning and her pink lips begged Harry to kiss them…...
“I did. I felt them all night, but I didn’t mind. I’ve missed out for months, you know.” Draco said as his handsome face twisted into a frown. Harriet ignored his comment, too preoccupied with the pain from the baby’s kick and that worried Draco.
“They’re still a part of me, Draco.” Harriet huffed.
“Hello, love.” Draco whispered from the doorway, “Would you like me to take him for a while?”
—————————————————————
“-I wasn’t talking about Potter, you imbecile!” Lucius growled.
There was something boldly alluring to him about it all, besides the beauty of his mate in those frames.
The first night with his newborn has been as tumultuous as he expected, but it wasn’t a pace he couldn’t handle.
The room began to swim as Harriet felt all of the blood in her body rush to her head.
—————————————————————
Harriet drifted back into a deep, dreamless sleep as she nodded off again, too comfortable to stay awake.
“I wasn’t going to do it, Potter. I knew you were lying.” Draco chuckled darkly.
Harriet struggled against the tears that welled in her eyes as she walked back into her small living room. Sitting down on the sofa, she placed a hand to her face for a moment and tried to forget Draco’s pleading words.
Coupling with Harriet~.
In the awkward, nearly unbearable silence that followed, punctuated after a moment by hushed whisperings of disbelief, Draco released Harriet and stepped back.
Harriet’s green eyes widened at Draco’s gentle gesture. She didn’t want to admit to the electric shocks that Draco’s kiss sent shooting through her body, but that didn’t make them any less real.
—————————————————————
“I’m going.” Harriet replied with a laugh.
Ron gazed back at Hermione as he spoke with complete conviction, “I think that she and Malfoy really…….really care about each other.”
“Is it, Granger?” Draco snapped, purposefully ignoring Ron’s comment, “The two of us already share a son and a bed~. She’s mine and I’m hers. I’m tired of lollygagging around. She should be my wife and she will be…...I need you two to assist with that.”
Draco grit his teeth and positioned himself, growling as he sank into his omega, exhaling at the feeling of being sheathed within her once more.
In that moment, Draco despised those stupid muggle classes. With what Harriet faced in that brutal contraction, “breathe” was a flimsy defense.
—————————————————————
“That’s alright.” Harriet replied to the doctor, “We’ll wait.”
The next two weeks passed by in a flurry of continued vendor appointments, scheduled consults with decorators and blocks of time where entire hired teams of people used their wands and their expertise to turn damask Malfoy manor into the elegant, host location of the year’s most heralded social event in Britain’s wizarding world.
Whether his son grew to be the greatest wizard in the world or one of those…..what were they called?
“Morning, love.” Harry whispered, leaning in for a kiss, which Draco returned with a tense sigh.
Part of Harriet had wondered if Draco would really see his wish through after her pregnancy ended and the real work began.
He really had wanted to wait until they got engaged, but he had to think up a new plan and……..and Harriet looked too good in her lovely dress for him to resist.
A brand new body with a brand new set of eyes and lungs as the mouth opened and that brand new body gave an irritated cry……….
Harriet watched while Draco pressed his cheek against her abdomen and her smile turned into a smirk when Draco stilled.
Draco Malfoy was in love with Harriet Potter, but he had already fallen in love with his pup.
Harriet took in a happy breath of relief as she asked, “W-What about your files?”
Beside her, Scorpius was snoring gently on Harry’s chest, lulled into slumber by his father reading him a bedtime story.
As Draco stood up to pin his mate against the wall and slam into her while he stood, somewhere, in the part of his mind that could reason through the sight of her bouncing breasts and pale, exposed throat, he thought it was just as well.
“Good morning, Scorp.” Draco grinned as he reached out and carefully grabbed one of Scorpius’s tiny, socked feet in his pale, elegant fingers.
Harriet was breathing hard as Draco rose behind her. He knelt on the bed so he could look down over his vulnerable darling as she waited for him to pounce and take~.
Draco nodded but the concern didn’t leave his face. Harriet didn’t need her alpha’s help but he gave it to her anyway.
—————————————————————-
Harriet turned on her side and Draco spooned around her, careful not to put pressure on her belly as he held her close to make his omega feel protected and comfortable.
“That we two might be one.” The man nodded.
The woman behind the counter acted like Draco had nothing better to do but stand there and chat with her about Harriet’s identifying information.
Narcissa looked over at her husband and said very seriously, “You’ll do well to remember that now, my love. I don’t care about the war. I don’t care about rival families. I care about my family, my husband, my son, and the grandchild that my son’s omega is soon to give birth to. You’ve gone around the bend if you think I won’t be there waiting to hold that baby the moment they come into this world.”
“Draco!” Narcissa called out as she felt Harriet’s belly contract under her palms.
He found himself temporarily distracted when his grey eyes roamed over Harriet’s appealing curves while she battled to stretch the tight fabric of her dress over her body.
Draco couldn’t wait to meet his baby, but a part of him was really going to miss Harriet being pregnant.
Draco was hip deep in Harriet as he kissed his needy mate and set a pounding pace that caused her to cry out in ecstasy.
“She’s still being examined by one of our midwives, but yes, Mr. Malfoy, she’s awake and you can join her.” The healer nodded.
“I’ll bet she looks just like Weasley.” Draco sneered.
Draco pounced so quickly that Harriet barely had time to process the sensations he sent racing through her.
When she walked into the bedroom and saw Draco lying on the bed, naked, with one arm carelessly behind his head and the letter over the part of him that Harriet liked best, she rolled her eyes.
A moment passed.
If she and Draco hadn’t promised each other that they would reveal their secret to no one, she would have told her in an instant.
Regardless, through money or magic, that evening, Draco Malfoy was determined to win his fight against the muggle family who were seeking to adopt his son or daughter.
So far away from any population of the wizarding world, Harriet hadn’t given it a second thought.
“Certainly.” The woman nodded with a smile as she led Harriet through the shop and up the short staircase into the room that functioned as her studio, “Many of my customers come with similar requests.”
Draco allowed Harriet to go to bed first, then he followed shortly afterwards. That way, he was sure that he gave her the privacy to shower and dress, then they cuddled together in her little nest in the bed and went to sleep.
Draco never missed an opportunity to see Harriet naked, but that morning was different.
“So….the baby isn’t scheduled to be born for two more weeks, that’s what.” Draco replied.
“I don’t know anything about muggle hospitals.” Draco sneered, “Did you really want the attention that our sudden arrival in St. Mungo’s would bring?”
“Piss off, Potter.” Draco scowled as she rolled over on her side.
Draco gave him a curt nod and swallowed.
“........Potter?” Draco called again as his eyes scanned over the flat.
“Yeah, it’s been…….quite some time.” Harriet agreed with a nod.
Draco and Harriet both looked at Narcissa silently as she shook her head and replied, “Thank goodness that you have your father and I to help you, this entire event would be a total disaster otherwise. Now hurry up! You’ve got a lovely breakfast of cake being cut as we speak.”
—————————————————————
The bells on the shop’s door chimed as she entered the establishment.
Draco had been very pleased when Harriet invited him to sleep in her nest after that first night. She passed her request off under the guise of wanting him close by in case she had another nightmare, but he knew the silent truth.
Draco had turned plan after plan over in his mind…….
—————————————————————
“HHAARRRRYY!” Draco shouted again from her place by the window and Harry raced over, draping her arm over his shoulder so he could support her.
—————————————————————
Draco glanced over at Harriet and groaned, his grey gaze half-lidded with lust.
Narcissa and Hermione looked up as a gentle little cry sounded after Harriet’s ended and Draco waited impatiently for the midwife to cut the cord.
Didn’t Harriet say this family had a farm?
Or perhaps…….so in love?
It didn’t matter if it was usually served at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, or dessert…if Harriet requested it, then Draco had it prepared for her.
Draco had had enough battling for one day.
When she was finally finished, the room looked nearly the same as it did before.
Draco’s face contorted in anguish.
He meant well…..
He sighed softly as he pulled Harriet against him so she could relax better.
And their son…….
Draco offered his arm to Harriet and she gladly accepted.
Harriet’s obstinate denial no longer bothered him.
Harriet slept very well that night, but Draco barely managed to get any rest at all.
“Your body certainly disagrees.” Draco said with a hint of a purr in his smooth voice.
Draco frowned as he bent down and hugged Harriet close while she whimpered and began to sob, “I’m sorry, Draco! I’m so sorry!”
Harriet picked up her toothbrush and placed some toothpaste on the bristles while Draco slept on in the other room.
Draco tried to talk to Harriet about her wishes for the birth, but whenever he did, she changed the subject.
“And neither my mother nor my father ever wake before sunrise.” Draco replied.
Without a second thought, Draco carefully scooped the pregnant omega into his arms and apparated them both out of her apartment and straight to Malfoy manor.
————————————————————
He cupped one side of Harriet’s face and closed his eyes as she deepened their kiss. Over and over, their lips met while they snuggled together under the warm blankets on the bed.
At first it wounded Harriet’s pride that her husband hadn’t sought her out but when she realized that he had only been thinking of her safety, an arrogant smirk spread over her face at the power she temporarily held over her alpha.
Harriet was ashamed about the tears that gathered in her eyes as she listened to the harsh words being hurled at her. She had been through much worse than Draco‘s verbal attack, but in her pregnant state, she found herself defenseless against the pools of thick tears that clouded her vision.
“At dinner. Nosy, aren’t you?” Draco scoffed.
“Nothing, I’ve got a headache, that’s all.” Harriet replied.
“It’s alright, it’s alright now.” Draco whispered as he kissed Harriet’s cheek and watched the midwife work, “I’m here, Potter, it’s alright.”
————————————————————
Harry noticed the wetness on Draco’s thighs and he asked her in a soothing whisper, “Waters’ gone, love?”
Harriet was usually fairly level-headed emotionally. He really hadn’t noticed that big of a change in his omega during the duration of the time they had shared together over the months she had been in his care, but that had changed over the past week.
Another contraction threatened to start and Draco feared she would perish with its intensity. She was safe in her home, in her room, with her husband, a skilled, adept healer who loved her but for some reason, Draco was confined by absolute terror.
His torment was short-lived.
“I can help, if you’d like. I believe the same midwife that delivered Draco is still working. She did an excellent job.” Narcissa offered Harriet, then she looked over at Draco and sighed as she smiled bittersweetly while she reminisced, “I remember the day you were born, my darling. It was such a lovely June afternoon.”
The fact that his journey brought him directly face to face with an apartment door in Hogsmeade which he assumed belonged to Harriet should have been proof of enough of his paternity.
As the couple landed in the middle of a dark, warm area, and stood atop a wooden pier, Draco saw the mirth on Harriet’s face as she smiled in delight, and he knew that was a lie.
“Scorpius was already far too old for you to pass him off as a wedding night souvenir when I proposed to Potter.” Draco retorted, “The baby had to come from somewhere, Father, would you rather I have told a lie and claim that I adopted him? A child that looks just like a Malfoy? What sense would that make to anyone?”
Harriet could already feel a primal urge to start making a few preparations for the baby, but during the next few weeks, she was too weak to do anything but come home from work and close her eyes.
It was almost unbelievable how green the grass was, even under the dark cover of night.
She felt a surge of excitement ripple through her when his hard arousal pushed against the soft flesh of her thigh.
Hermione had seen more evidence of Draco’s affection for Harriet than her boyfriend had.
When he saw no one there, he looked at Harriet again and nodded, “Yes! Come on! We’ve got to hurry! Put on the dress I bought you so I can take it off you later~.”
Afterwards, once they had finished coupling and Harriet lay dozing against his chest, Draco held the ring that he meant to have already placed on Harriet’s finger and frowned.
It was tacky, honestly, that his mate, the mother of his child, wasn’t already a Malfoy.
“It’s right there.” Narcissa replied irritably as she traced along the outline of the picture with the tip of her fingernail, “Look at that…..there’s the head…..that must be an arm…..”
Unbeknownst to either Draco or Harriet, far away, Lucius and Narcissa were making some last minute arrangements before they returned home.
Harriet looked up at him and she was taken aback by the intense way he stared down at her.
Draco didn’t care.
She peered to the left and found the lavatory, which was as sleek and as well-appointed as she expected.
As soon as they arrived in the foyer, Lucius turned and walked towards the wing of the house that he shared with Draco’s mother, Narcissa.
Harriet heard his comment but as he grabbed her hips and squeezed the extra flesh that had formed there, there was little else she could do besides whimper.
Harriet stared out at the ocean, while Scorpius clung tightly to her, holding onto her breast while he enjoyed his morning meal.
“Nothing.” Draco replied quickly, shaking his head as if he were offended that Harriet had even asked, “Nothing’s the matter.”
Wave after wave of pain rolled through her body, leaving her kneeling on the bed, rocking back and forth while she tried to catch her breath.
————————————————————
The thought made him pulse inside her and he listened to her cry out at the sensation.
The wedding officiant nodded in understanding and respectfully silenced himself so the bride could speak her vows to her groom.
Draco’s face tensed like he had been stabbed in the gut and Harriet watched him draw in a tense breath.
By day fifteen, Draco was driving her mad.
Those times were just so much…….so much…..better~.
Without hesitation, she raised her wand and apparated to Hogsmeade.
“Draco…….” Harriet said very seriously, “There’s something I need to tell you.”
Draco was attempting to hasten their last transaction as they stood at the register. Ever the attentive alpha, although Harriet didn’t complain, Draco could see in her green eyes that she was tiring.
“-Hush, ‘Cissa!” Lucius hissed cuttingly to quiet his wife. When Narcissa fell silent, he turned back towards Draco and regarded him coldly, “When you have your own child, you’ll understand the lengths that a father will go to so their child’s survival is assured. Your mother and I don’t understand why you and the Potter girl can’t take a photo together and have a small article run in the Prophet. It would be wonderful publicity for this family’s companies.”
Harriet had allowed Hermione to help her with her research, so she knew the direction in which she needed to walk.
Harriet was finished with schooling.
A shadow of sadness crossed Draco’s face though he tried to hide it with a sneer, “So you just weren’t going to tell me at all, Potter? I’d have a son or daughter walking through the world and just never know?”
“You two aren’t supposed to be here!” Harriet snapped at her friends. She felt like a criminal who had been caught in the middle of an offense as Ron and Hermione stared at her in the gelato shop.
Harriet sat up with a gasp as Draco stepped into the room.
Draco had faced the destruction of his family before, but he had battled against it in his own way, if only through a private, internal struggle.
“Don’t look so grim, Draco.” Lucius commanded.
When the morning of the alumni game arrived, Harriet felt like she was sixteen again as she pulled on her old quidditch uniform and retrieved her Firebolt from storage.
“No, I’m helping my baby have a better life.” Harriet huffed while Draco scowled down at the family in the photograph, “They seem lovely. I’ve met them once, briefly. They have a farm and everything.”
“WWWWWAAAA!”
Draco’s broom was newer and more expensive than Harriet’s. His ambition to succeed was also much greater. He grasped the handle of his broomstick and rocketed at full speed nearly straight towards the ground.
After a very tense pause, Harriet glanced back over towards Draco and wordlessly, he opened his arms for her. They were still standing so near to each other that it only took one step for Harriet to cuddle against Draco’s chest while he wrapped her in his embrace. Gently, he lifted her off of her feet and slipped their shoes off before he tucked himself and Harriet into the nest she’d made on his bed.
Draco silently admired his wife for a moment. He watched the light in the bathroom glint off of her head and highlight the colors of amber and red that made up her hair.
Ron and Hermione were left to blink at each other in their wake.
“Oh, Harriet!” Hermione cried and knelt beside her friend.
He rushed to her side and without her cooperation, he gently pulled her to sit up.
The baby had a peaceful sleep, but as the moon rose high in the sky, it was doubtful that either of his parents would see a single wink that night.
“Take me to see my wife immediately or I’m going to barge into every room until I find her myself!” Draco spat furiously. His face was red from rage.
Her sobs gradually quieted and Draco bent down to place a very sweet kiss right over the center of her belly.
Draco had held the baby, Narcissa had held the baby, Harriet was tired of her best friend being ignored.
Behind her, Draco kept his hands protectively splayed around Harriet’s belly, watching proudly as she ate with zeal.
His smile only grew as his little girl began to slip into his hands.
Draco frowned while he showered.
The slow pace of her response made Draco want to scream at the ceiling in consternation.
Narcissa was three times as flustered as the bride that morning.
And the day after that.
Draco owned dozens of fine, black suits, but that suit was different.
“Lily.” Draco chided as he glanced over at the toddler that stood in her bed and looked at him with her emerald eyes, “Narcissa,” Draco added as he turned his gaze on the other small girl who was standing in her own crib, which was directly across from her twin sister’s, “What have I told you two about holding onto the rails like that? You’re going to slip and pinch your fingers.”
She didn't want to think about it, but she had indulged in more than one fantasy about lying in bed and Draco offering to rub…..something…..for her~.
Harriet had nearly died of embarrassment when Draco had contacted the midwife to ask if her lengthy bathroom stays should be of any concern to her health or their baby’s.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
The room was elegantly decorated in a fashion that was worthy of Slytherin royalty. The walls were a deep shade of emerald green, embossed with black filigree. The damask curtains were highlighted by the gothic chandeliers that hung over each ornate, ebony crib.
Draco wouldn’t let her out of his sight, much less out of the house.
Hermione had never been one to have trouble reacting and she spoke first as she accused Harriet, “I can’t believe you’ve lied to us!”
That time though, Draco didn’t look shocked or disheartened, instead, he only looked angry.
Draco gripped his wand as Harriet grunted, but the midwife held up a hand to stop him.
His omega was in a strange place, preparing to have something that he wasn’t familiar with done to her, and she had given her consent so it would be difficult for him to intervene and try to protect her if she needed his help.
“Congratulations, Weasley.” Draco nodded at Ron while Hermione and Harriet sat, talking about their little ones as they sipped their tea on the other side of the room.
—————————————————————
“Mmm…...alright…...” Harriet agreed without paying any attention to what Draco was saying as he began to kiss her sore body again while his hands dipped down to her bottom.
Draco had noticed the green dress she wore first, then her amazing scent, soft and sweet, at the delayed graduation party held at Hogwarts.
Harriet opened the letter and blinked as her green eyes scanned over the page.
That thought broke Draco’s heart. He wasn’t sure he could withstand the hurt of seeing that idea validated, but in spite of himself, he turned to glance back at Harriet just before he left the room.
Draco hastily apparated back to his childhood home with a scowl plastered on his handsome face.
He eventually reached his destination and walked up the steps to a brick townhouse which was positioned at the end of a long row of shops.
“It is until my child arrives.” Draco said, scowling over at Harriet.
“...........He needs a name, love.” Draco said quietly.
Harriet enjoyed a quiet sense of arrogant pride and as she chewed, she contemplated different ways to break the news to the future grandparents.
“I’d love to.” Harriet said with amused enthusiasm.
How was he supposed to fight against the complications that his pregnant mate faced?
Harriet felt a flutter against her ribs and her breath hitched in her throat.
Had Harriet lost their pup?
That would be a welcome relief.
The Roberts family would.
Harriet swallowed thickly.
Draco’s eyes narrowed to slits as he looked at Lucius and replied, “Have you lost your hearing, Father?”
Draco frowned while he laid down in bed.
“Draco….” Harriet began, thinking about a few things she could probably go ahead and do for work while she was confined to the house.
The nervous alpha outwardly appeared calm as he watched a majority of the crowd whisper to their neighbors, about which Draco assumed was himself and Harriet.
—————————————————————
“Now, that isn’t true, love……. you know better than that.” Draco chided as Harriet gasped out a sob so dramatic that anyone else would have thought she had just learned tragic news.
Hot tears of fury sprang to Harriet’s eyes and that made her even angrier.
Whenever she and Draco shared a family dinner with his parents, which was several nights a week, Lucius stared at her calculatingly in between the Draco proud, arrogant glances that he threw at his only son.
She sighed gently, feeling surprisingly relaxed.
Draco was so close to succeeding in seducing his stubborn, skittish omega to stay at his side.
Whenever Harriet felt up to it, Draco continued to show his eagerness and enthusiasm for making love to her.
Harriet stood beside her alpha while they gazed over the magical pictures that had been laid out across the dining table while Scorpius cuddled against his mother and cooed softly.
The enamored alpha barely paused to toss the piece of ebony in his hand onto one of the side tables in the room before he was standing beside Harriet.
Draco’s body went limp upon impact and startled gasps rippled through the crowd as everyone in the stands fell silent.
“What?” Draco asked in an annoyed tone as he looked up from his position against her lower belly.
If his mate wanted to go into the dreaded muggle world and purchase some of their goods, then….fine. Draco comforted himself with the fact that he could always order some nicer things for his son or daughter later.
Draco was very displeased that apparently, the two of them had differing ideas on when exactly that time would begin.
Harriet didn’t feel like herself anymore, under Draco’s onslaught, she felt like a queen.
Baby Scorpius didn’t hear his mother’s whimpers of pleasure as her new husband pounded her into the bed.
Pick the baby up.
Business conditions at the Malfoys’ company were not the best.
Harriet was nervous, she had never actually been through a heat, and as her warning symptoms increased while Draco was still away, she hoped she wouldn’t have to endure her first one alone.
He took Harriet back to the manor, undressed them both, and minutes after they lay down in her nest, she was asleep.
“Dinner is prepared whenever you and…...whenever you both are hungry. Your father and I will be waiting.” Narcissa ended with a nod.
That was during the next Malfoy board meeting and Harriet marveled at how close she had come to failing at completing her private project.
“You should have told me!” Harriet said as she pulled back from Hermione and glanced down at her belly.
His grey eyes lit up with hope as he read over one particularly interesting page in the book that lay in front of him……
—————————————————————
The preparations had been overwhelming for her too, yes, but Harriet wasn’t angry at Lucius or Narcissa over it all.
—————————————————————
Draco blinked back.
“Thank you for coming so suddenly.” Draco explained, “There’s no one my family trusts more than you, healer Marigold.”
After he recovered from his sudden surprise, Draco scowled back at Harriet, “I wasn’t talking to you, Potter! I was speaking to my child, thank you very much!”
As he thought to himself, Draco felt fear stir in his heart and he looked over at Harriet as she lay slumbering in her nest.
It was a small group, composed of only Lucius, Narcissa, Ron, and Hermione, but Draco had been assured by his mate’s friends that that's the way Harriet would prefer it.
“What does it look like I’m doing, Potter?” Draco shot back as he glanced over at Harriet then back towards the chandelier, “I’m putting the nursery together.”
As her irritation rose with her pain level, she was very grateful to be there, in her home, in her nest, not on some unfamiliar hospital bed with bright lights glaring down in her face while strangers surrounded her and stared at her most private bits.
Draco was the sole heir to not one but two prestigious wizarding lines…..
As she felt her next heat approaching one evening, she sat down with her alpha on the green velvet sofa in their bedroom and took his hand in hers.
When Draco finally woke some time later that morning, he blinked and opened his grey eyes to see his bride sitting up in bed beside him.
She thoroughly enjoyed experiencing her heats with her alpha.
It was a very lovely week for the newlyweds, together there on the sunny island, with each other, and their little one.
Draco had not asked his wife for a family as a result of a fleeting whim.
As much as he would have loved for his omega to have ridden him to ecstasy, he was more than pleased when Harriet moved off of him and laid down in the nest, staring up at him, nude, while she invited him to come and explore.
“Of course, sir, and congratulations to you both!” The man said cheerfully before he turned and hurried away.
In the chaos of the flying players, the cacophony of cheers and claps from those seated in the stadium, and the buzz of the whirling balls as they whizzed by, Harriet slowly remembered how to play.
Quick, scuffling footsteps came pounding through the hall until a quiet knock fell on Draco’s bedroom door.
It was a rapid and unexpected change from languishing about Malfoy manor, as they had done since Harriet had come to stay, to bustling about, planning the grand wedding.
The healer scoffed as she gave her own response, “This is her first child, she can’t possibly-“
She was pleasantly surprised that Draco became completely dedicated to fatherhood after Scorpius’s birth, all the while remaining a supportive husband.
Each evening as Draco snuggled close to Harriet, his heart leapt hopefully when the omega gladly snuggled back.
She saw herself fighting her previous battles with Draco standing by her side.
Harriet’s bold attitude fell away as her alpha’s arousal ground into her bottom cheek. She turned her head and they both abandoned their battle as their lips locked together.
As they sat on the bench next to each other, Draco looked over at Harriet with a frown as she wiped the tears away from her eyes, staring straight ahead.
Draco was skeptical about Harriet’s friends’ ideas but he took their advice and proceeded with the actions that they recommended.
Hermione grinned.
“AH!......I…...I stopped…..” Harriet gasped.
Ring, Ring!
Quietly, Draco stepped inside with Lily and Narcissa in tow.
“Everything’s alright, don’t worry.” The midwife said in a much more pleasant tone as she glanced up from her place between Harriet’s thighs, “We’re just finishing up.”
Harriet seemed to deteriorate with each passing hour after Scorpius’s birth.
Harriet stared into Draco’s eyes and he watched as she started to move.
It was all done, everything was prepared, but it hadn’t been finished to suit her, and she was desperate to see that remedied.
Irritated by the unwelcome noise, she glared over at Draco with narrowed eyes, “........What?”
Suddenly Draco didn’t matter so much as she squeezed onto Hermione and gave a harsh grunt as she listened to her body and pushed again…….hard.
Calling Harriet by her married name hadn’t gotten old to Draco yet.
That was something he had always admired about his omega, her complete and utter determination to protect Draco. It had been an unignorable instinct for Narcissa from the moment the Malfoy heir had been conceived.
“......But you’re mates?” Ron asked, frowning in confusion.
She wasn’t sure which part she found more confusing…...The fact that Draco was so eager to care for a baby parented by two people he held such a great contempt for, or the wide smile of joy that was spread across his face while he did?
“You should have woken me earlier.” Draco murmured as he bent his head and kissed Harriet’s face, “How far apart are they?”
A worried scowl marred his face when he saw Harriet standing tensely in front of the table they had shared. Draco’s pulse quickened when he saw how bewildered his omega looked.
Draco was no fool.
“I’ll be fine.” Harriet said coldly.
Slowly and carefully, Harriet transitioned baby Rose into Draco’s grasp.
“Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.” Harriet replied politely.
With a melancholy frown marring his handsome face, Draco rolled over in bed and sighed, feeling the skin on his bare chest tingle in irritation at the early morning chill.
Draco’s scowl deepened in irritation as he watched his young son’s blonde head turn towards him in the distance.
Harriet didn’t expect it all to be done right then.
“What’s the matter?” Ron Weasley asked as Hermione Granger stared through the window.
What if…..what if she didn’t take good care of the baby?
Draco Malfoy was Harriet Potter’s alpha, so why wouldn’t she let him be her husband too?
Draco didn’t see his wife until he stood facing her as both the Slytherin and Gryfinndor alumni teams waited for the game to begin.
Harriet groaned in displeasure and rustled around in the covers for a moment before she cracked her eyes open and blinked at her husband sitting at her side with their two tiny girls.
“I’ve never heard of anything like that, but I think it’s a brilliant idea.” Draco replied as he fastened the buttons on his green and black silk pajamas, “St. Mungo’s doesn’t offer those. Our family healer told me I won’t be allowed in the room when the baby comes and I’m afraid that won’t work, Potter. Apparently, it isn’t a wizarding tradition for the father to be very hands-on. ”
Harriet blinked as she looked out over the array of props and backdrops and cameras set up in the small space.
She would think about Hermione and Ron later.
Or her…….
—————————————————————
After a short distance down the crowded street, Harriet arrived at her destination.
Once the bathroom door was locked, Draco quickly apparated back to Malfoy manor, intent on handling Narcissa and Lucius….and quickly.
He felt himself melt at how beautiful she looked with her hair fanned behind her on the pillow and her fair face relaxed as she rested.
Narcissa and Lucius, though the eldest Malfoy wouldn’t say it outright, were ready.
The first female Malfoy in generations had green-eyes and a bright smile as she joined her older brother, who had celebrated his first birthday only a few months prior.
Draco arrived at St. Mungo’s in a swirling whirlwind of mortal terror.
“Yes.” Harriet admitted with a blush, “He does, indeed. He’s been very lovely and very gentle. I wanted to do something nice for him.”
Draco knew that things were progressing as He watched Harriet fight her way out of the nest and walk around the room. He trailed obediently behind her with a soft, clean towel, trying to blot away the perspiration from her skin during the break between pains.
“Potter, this isn’t your fault.” Draco said as he spoke to Harriet. She didn’t reply but she stared back at him and Draco knew that she was listening, “It could be…..it could be from the hormones, played against your fears or worries…...it could be everything you’ve seen and lived through, but you need me right now, Potter. I’m the only one that realizes how much trouble you’re in!” Draco exclaimed.
If she seemed sad or frightened, he’d pull her close and stroke her hair while he whispered pleasant reassurances to her.
Draco moved forward, wanting with every fiber of his being to hold Harriet’s hand, but the secretary pushed him back when one of the healers turned towards the two in the doorway and shook their head in a firm, silent warning of “no”.
The commotion attracted the attention of several  others who all hurriedly gathered around the spectacle.
Ron shifted in his chair and Hermione narrowed her brown eyes suspiciously.
“You’re a father yourself?” Draco asked, feigning surprise.
Draco had never heard her sound so exhausted as she did when she laid her head back.
She groaned when he decided that he’d like to have a taste and suckled her as she lay helpless underneath him.
Draco wrapped his hands around Harriet’s waist and pressed a victorious kiss to her lips.
Harriet gave Draco a pleasing look and he smirked as he realized that she did in fact want his help.
Ron would have been lying if he said he didn’t enjoy the look of utter defeat on Draco’s face, but he remembered Harriet and that’s what stopped him from smirking in triumph.
Whatever trial she faced, Draco would be there.
He had until dawn to live out the fantasy of holding Harriet close, stroking her belly, and pretending that they were a real couple.
After a moment passed, when they began to grind against each other again, Draco lamented the fact that they had gone this long before experiencing one of Harriet’s heats together.
Her smile was bright and her blue eyes were mirthful as she looked down at the sweet, blonde newborn in her arms.
He was careful to blot the excess water out of her hair before they laid down in her nest so she wouldn’t catch a chill.
Thank goodness.
Draco himself wasn’t tired, especially after their previous nap a few hours earlier, but he smirked in amusement at Harriet’s apparent exhaustion.
In the wizarding world, preparing for a new baby was somewhat more basic than it was in the muggle world. For children from magical families, most cradles were either heirlooms or designed by a hired woodcarver and most infant clothing was ordered from a tailor or handmade.
Harriet insisted on dressing them in fluffy, frilly outfits, but Draco didn’t mind.
Draco was infuriated.
—————————————————————
“Why?” Scorpius pressed.
That was one of the best mornings of Harriet’s pregnancy.
Without a word, Harriet squirmed in the sheets until her legs were wrapped around her husband’s trim waist, pulling his hips to center over hers so that his arousal nudged against the thin fabric of her panties, the only barrier that kept them apart.
A square, slender black box.
“We’re going to get married, Potter.” Draco revealed as he finished with his shoes and stood.
“I don’t see what’s so funny, Granger!” Draco snapped.
—————————————————————
Back at Malfoy manor, Draco also wore a dramatic scowl as he stared into thin air after his wife.
Were Harriet and the baby alright or not?!
—————————————————————
“What’s the matter?” Draco murmured to Harriet as her green eyes widened in horror at his sudden, ill-timed appearance.
Harriet answered so quickly that she stung Draco, “No.”
But it was real.
His mate.
“-Mr. Malfoy!” Someone called out from behind him.
He admitted to himself that the restaurant had been a terrible idea, yet he didn’t know where to get a better one.
What an idiot!
A small trickle of gold in the blazing sunlight, it was down so low that it was nearly skimming across the ground.
While she had an innate desire to please, nurture, seek comfort, and bear children?
As she watched Draco, and admired how utterly fascinated he was by the promise of the family that they may finally get a chance to have, Harriet was elated that she had made her alpha so happy.
“The best night of your life, that’s what’s happening this evening. Now go on, get started, we’re scheduled to arrive at seven.” Draco replied in a low whisper.
Harriet glanced over at Draco and he glanced back at her.
Draco and Harriet were marrying for love and yet somehow, their day of sentiment was quickly evolving into becoming nothing more than a very formal, very public declaration of family wealth and nobility.
She had to push and as her pain crescendoed, she decided that her two attendants would find that out for themselves.
Harriet’s expression was deadly serious as she replied, “Especially not to Malfoy.”
Draco was terrified that Harriet would abandon him and their little son.
Draco closed his eyes and resumed their kiss, placing one hand tenderly on the side of her face. Harriet’s headache began to ease as she breathed in her alpha’s soothing scent, whimpering as he moved his hands to knead at her swollen breasts.
The pleasantly torturous hours had been deliciously sublime for the young lovers.
“Potter!” Draco cried, racing over to his omega and shaking her slightly to see if she would rouse, “Potter! Look at me!”
Muggles could determine a child’s gender before birth?
“They do realize we have no idea how to care for a child, right?!” Draco called down the short hallway after Harriet.
A week before the baby was scheduled to come, Draco noticed a striking difference in Harriet’s behavior.
As they continued their long talk, on the inside, Draco was reeling with disappointment.
“I am.” Harriet replied as she scribbled down her response to her friends, “If you don’t want to come, then don’t come. We’re around your family all the time. I think it will do me some good to visit with Ron and Hermione.”
Harriet spied several flyers on the table by the fireplace.
—————————————————————
Thump-Thump
When Harriet felt her breasts start to become tender and those familiar, low cramps begin to roll through her belly, she was filled with a greater sense of dismay than she had anticipated.
Hermione blinked, “Maybe it was an illusion he cast, I don’t know.”
Draco let out an exasperated sigh of complete disbelief after she was gone.
Harriet looked mortified but Draco was instantly vigilant.
“No, really, it’s alright. I don’t eat very much.” Harriet replied, placing a hand on her bump as she tried to quiet her growling stomach.
Most of those boxes were sealed shut, but some were open.
“Hello.” Harriet said politely, “I have an appointment in the imaging department this morning.”
Thank you for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Draco swallowed thickly in his throat as he realized what was happening.
Draco didn’t know what was better, the all-consuming enrapturement that Harriet’s kisses brought him, the feeling of her full breasts pressed firmly against his chest, or the warmth of her heavy belly in his hands.
“Do you think you’re having early contractions?” Draco asked as he immediately walked over and sat down on the side of the bed.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this story! I hope that you’ve enjoyed it! I do have a couple new Drarry fics that will be starting soon and if you enjoyed this one, I hope that you may consider checking them out if they interest you!
Draco frowned at his father and watched as Lucius stood and walked towards him with heavy steps.
He didn’t bother to pause his kiss with his wife as he gave his wand a flick and those panes of glass disappeared, which allowed the ocean breeze to ghost through the room and envelope him and Harriet in its tranquil peace.
Draco had never been with an omega in heat before.
Draco knew he had overstepped his boundaries when instead of receiving a reward for his efforts, he was met with an ominous scowl from his omega.
Desperate to reverse the adoption quickly and break down the walls that Harriet kept placing between him and her, Draco had decided he would escort his pregnant omega to have the test completed, wherever that would take place in the muggle world.
Harriet couldn’t even bear to look at Draco as he gazed at her with all of the lavish sentiment that a Malfoy in love possessed.
“Paternity test?” Draco blinked.
Regardless of their progress, when the Malfoy heir saw that as a realistic possibility, he was the one who began having nightmares.
Draco had had enough of sneaking around.
He held Lily in one arm and Narcissa in the other.
Those-
The only thing that Draco wanted more than Harriet was for his little one to arrive safely.
Scorpius Potter’s was “why”.
Draco had read that most omegas had little interest in sex during late pregnancy, but Hareiet seemed experience the opposite. Harriet’s desire for making love wasn’t lacking to begin with, although Draco noticed that the closer the birth drew, the more Harriet attempted to lure him into her nest for more than a cuddle.
“You’re being ridiculous.” Draco scowled.
“He’s perfect, Harriet.” Hermione complimented her friend as she looked over at her.
Awake and alert, Rose stared back at the new person to whom Harriet had introduced her.
Harriet was mortified but when Draco continued his ministrations, to her dismay, a soft, satisfied sigh escaped her lips.
Harriet slowly pulled herself out of the bed and placed one hand on her aching belly and another against her throbbing temple.
Scorpius had continued to grow and do well.
Draco’s grey eyes widened as blood rushed to his groin at the sound.
—————————————————————
Draco scowled as he watched his young son’s blonde head turn towards him in the distance.
He tried to emulate his godfather and maintain a calm face, even though he wanted to scream in terror.
Lucius and Narcissa thought it was ridiculous.
“Perhaps we should call a healer?” Narcissa suggested urgently as her blue eyes flickered between her husband and Harriet.
Let Draco make his bets.
That wasn’t a lie, but it wasn’t why she was standing next to Draco.
He would have immediately apparated home and taken Harriet into his arms, if she hadn’t been carrying such precious cargo.
I’ll send another message tomorrow.
“The notion itself is ridiculous. What about my job?” Harriet asked, “I’m an auror, Draco. I’m constantly in danger…..I keep long hours. You expect me to mother a child under those circumstances?”
That statement hurt Harriet even more deeply than it did Draco.
Lucius narrowed his eyes but Narcissa frowned, immediately concerned for her dear boy, “What’s the matter, Draco?”
“.......Because I’m your alpha, Potter.” Draco said with absolute confidence.
Draco had already left earlier, eager to get in some practice with his fellow Slytherins before the start of the match.
During those three weeks, the midwife and the healer released Harriet from all of her postpartum restrictions, beyond the foods and drinks that would interfere with her milk, and little Scorpius celebrated his first three months of life.
Those other women that complained about their pregnancies must have been the overly dramatic types.
Instead of being offended, Draco was angry, intrigued, and wounded. His alpha pride flared at the brazen omega and he grabbed her wrist from behind, spinning her around as he spoke, “Don’t you understand, Potter?! I don’t want to move on! I want to be with you!”
Harriet wouldn’t mind in the least if her child was unable to do magic but her guts clenched at the ostracization that she knew her son or daughter would receive from their only living grandparents if that ended up being their plight.
Harriet’s look of reverent admiration and arousal turned into a deep frown of disappointment as she stared up at Draco and cried, “That’s not fair!”
Draco looked like he had been bludgeoned.
“He was fine earlier!” Harriet said quickly to Narcissa.
“Mrs. Malfoy!” Harriet called out.
But a family meal just sounded so…...bizarre to Draco, not to mention, a great opportunity for drama and disaster based on his earlier confrontation with his parents.
Besides her neediness, Draco was enraptured by the fullness of her curves and the sweet, pleasant blush to her complexion that she kept every day that she carried their son or daughter.
Finished with his teasing, on edge with the urgency of his own need, Draco moved up and bent his head to kiss Harriet’s lips once more as he purred, “Tell me how you want me, love~. I’m not the one with child.”
The doorbell rang a moment later and Harriet immediately scurried out of the room to answer it.
There was one window outside that showed the sky, but none open to the inner workings of the employee’s section of the office.
The trousers wrinkled and worse than that, their placement ruined the clean, rumple-free edges of the blankets that Harriet had taken the time to smooth out.
Scorpius and Lily Malfoy had spent most of their young lives secluded in the manor.
Harriet had a feeling that it was going to be the day when Draco got his smirk back~.
Narcissa stopped in her tracks when that soft whimper was the only sound that came from the room.
Since the wizarding world lacked an equivalent curriculum, he saw no better way to prepare himself and his mate for parenthood.
“Harry Potter could never be in Dobby’s way, sir!” Dobby said humbly, smiling at Scorpius as the fair-headed, chubby-cheeked little boy giggled at him, “Master Scorpius looks very happy this morning!”
Harriet hadn’t thought it was possible, but the sudden wave of illness she had been struck by was ruthless.
The glare that Harriet threw at Draco when she turned her head towards him made him smile.
Alone with her alpha, Harriet frowned down at their wailing baby while she tried to soothe him.
“I think he’s perfect.” Harriet whispered as she tucked the blanket that her infant was wrapped in a little tighter and kissed the top of his round head.
“No!” Harriet cried, “I…...I……”
“What do you mean you’re not engaged?!” Lucius asked his son with narrowed eyes.
Was that more work one of his underlings had tried to levy on him?
“Yes, I can! I’m listening to it right now.” Draco insisted without looking up.
Scorpius would certainly appreciate a playmate.
We aren’t together.
She was wrong.
The instructor moved on to observe another couple.
Harriet had staunchly refused, she preferred to try out Hermione’s advice first.
Scorpius and Dobby both blinked over at Harry.
Now that he was facing fatherhood, he had hoped that he had remembered what he had been told incorrectly.
—————————————————————
The baby blinked his large, grey eyes up at his parents as he stared at them both in silent wonder.
For a moment, Draco thought he imagined the noise. However, as he closed his eyes to rest some more and enjoy the feeling of Harriet’s soft, plump curves against him, he couldn’t deafen his ears to the chatter and shuffling that he heard faintly from a distant part of the house.
Healers and nurses were working so concentratedly on Harriet that they were practically tangled up with each other.
Harriet and Draco had never gotten to experience a heat or a rut together and certainly not both at the same time.
After years of turmoil, war, struggles, and death, finally, the unlikely couple had dropped the walls around their hearts and let their love blossom.
Scorpius had taken hours to arrive.
He flipped them both over with a smirk and crawled on top of Harriet as he whispered, “Excellent, Potter~. I’ll make the arrangements right away~.”
“Alright.” Harriet agreed. Draco was about to speak again but Harriet added, “........I’d like that.”
Draco then took a moment to climb into Harriet’s nest beside her before he brought his parents in to meet their new grandson.
As she changed, she felt Draco’s grey eyes watch her every movement and her heart fluttered in her chest.
The Malfoys thought that a small column would be printed in the paper to announce Draco and Harriet’s engagement and relationship.
“I’m saving our relationship with our son, what’s left of it anyway, after that ludicrous display you put on earlier.” Narcissa remarked to her husband as she continued to ensure that the dining room and the contents of the table were being arranged perfectly.
Draco’s eyes dilated as they locked onto Harriet’s center.
Harriet gave Draco a quizzical look before she buried her head in the crook of his shoulder.
The alphas in the class helped their omegas sit up and Draco was no exception.
“......Yes.” Mr. Roberts admitted with a heavy sigh, “Yes, I’d do the same…...Has your lawyer received the results of your paternity test, Mr. Smith?”
Then she padded across the landing and looked at what would be her and Draco’s bedroom for the duration of their stay.
His grey eyes burned with want as he scanned over his omega, from her thick, lustrous hair, to the places in her figure that Scorpius’s birth had softened desirably~.
Harriet let out a deep sigh as she closed her eyes and felt the echoes of pain start to ripple across her belly again as another contraction vaguely threatened.
Somewhere private?
“Love you, Malfoy.” Harry whispered, resting his forehead against Draco’s.
Nine weeks wasn’t long at all.
Draco swallowed dryly as he accepted the harsh truth of reality.
When the silence lingered, Draco dared to step over the threshold and into Harriet’s apartment.
“Harriet Potter-er, Malfoy….Harriet Malfoy! I am extremely wealthy and she is extremely famous! How do you not recognize us?!” Draco shouted in exasperation.
“SHE’S HERE!” Draco screamed excitedly at Harriet as his mate fell back against the pillows, panting.
“Our destination is a surprise, Draco. I told you I called the travel planner last month and she booked us a holiday. You agreed to go with me wherever I chose, remember?” Harriet asked as she locked their trunks.
Harriet took a deep breath as she heard footsteps running down the hall towards the room.
Draco’s polished, black shoes clicked over the dark floor as he walked over and opened up his desk drawers to collect the parchments he sought.
Harriet watched him leap from the bed and dash over to her.
“You think I don’t already know that?!” Draco thundered, “That’s why I’m pursuing this paternity test to stop it! I will get my child, Potter! Whether you end this foolishness and give them to me, or I win them back through the ridiculous muggle court system, or I steal them in the dead of night from whatever family ‘adopts’ them, I will have my son or daughter! I have just as much responsibility to them as you do, though I doubt you’ll admit that…..You know, I thought Gryfinndors were supposed to be brave?”
After one particularly productive meeting, Draco slipped back into the nest beside Harriet just as she was waking up and he smiled as she cuddled against him.
Narcissa remembered when Draco had been that small and that innocent.
Harriet had taken the time to change into her best maternity dress. Her long hair had been neatly brushed and as she sat across from Draco, he had a difficult time keeping his eyes off of his mate.
Draco hovered over his expectant guest, monitoring her intake of water and the quality of her nutrition.
“D-Draco……?!” Harriet huffed as the pain started to build again.
Harriet would never admit it, but he was right. As she looked at her alpha, her alpha, tall and handsome with his sharp, grey eyes and pristine platinum hair, standing and cradling an innocent baby in his strong arms, warmth did fill her heart and desire did coil in her lower belly.
His irritation was made even worse as his instincts screamed at him to go in the room and help his frightened, suffering omega.
“Go ahead and get comfortable for me, dear.” The woman said with a smile, “We’ll choose your outfits, then I’ll help position you a bit.”
Draco marveled at how beguiling the pinkness that tinted her cheeks seemed to him……..
His efforts were not unrewarded.
“No, Potter!” Draco replied with an incredulous chuckle, “You really don’t give up, do you?”
Draco had quickly become well-known in his and Harriet’s childbirth class. He did nothing to hide the softness in his grey eyes as he and Harriet practiced together or the way that he smiled softly when he looked at her.
The secretary eventually came to a stop outside of a closed door.
The vividness that flashed through Harriet’s green eyes as she looked back at Draco made him grin.
Draco wasn’t going to hear of it.
Harriet’s ears had been accurate. As she approached the stadium, the excited chatter from the games’ attendees were unignorable.
Draco opened the bathroom door and walked down the narrow hallway that led from the lavatory and the side of the shop out into the main dining area and the counter.
“.............Congratulations, son.” Lucius nodded at Draco. His grey eyes regarded Harriet coldly as he nodded at her as well and spoke, “........Harriet.”
“He’ll do just fine, love.” Draco whispered to Harriet when he saw his wife blotting away tears.
Across the manor, Draco stood in his room while two house elves tended to him, straightening his suit, brushing minuscule fibers from his tie, and making sure every hair on his blonde head was in place.
“Now, then, Miss Potter, let’s help you become Mrs. Malfoy, shall we?” The man asked as he turned to Harriet, “Repeat after me, “I, Harriet Potter……”
Since that had finally happened, the fact that he was able to carelessly take the day off of work was a dangerous thing.
“When I saw her right after she was born, she looked more like Hermione.” Harriet retorted as she quickly brushed her long, brown hair.
Draco read every book he could find on the subject.
The handsome, attentive Malfoy heir had caught the eye of the other pregnant omegas in the class and the envy of their alphas, but Draco’s attention was firmly centered on Harriet.
Draco’s grey eyes widened as he looked on in disbelieving horror while the on-screen muggle doctor grasped a scalpel and slit the woman’s abdomen in a motion that was eerily smooth.
“Wonderful.” Harriet said nonchalantly with a smug nod.
Draco lay down beside his alpha, smirking when he opened his arms and she crawled right into them to place her head down on his trim chest while they both struggled to breathe.
After the Malfoys’ tea with Ron and Hermione, Harriet had taken her friends’ advice. With the help of a traveling planner who worked in the wizarding world, Harriet had arranged a romantic, stress-free vacation for herself and Draco.
“That’s inhumane!” Draco cried at the teacher, “That…...that omega…...! Look what they’re doing to her!”
Later in the day, Ron and Hermione arrived at the Malfoy’s flat to collect little Rose. A part of Harriet was worried that Draco wasn’t going to return the baby to her parents.
“No, Slytherin lost, Gryfinndor won.” Harriet snapped. She was very irritated that after so narrowly avoiding death, the first thing on Draco’s mind was his pride and their ridiculous wager.
Despite her aversions to most foods, Harriet slept that week until Thursday.
Harriet needed her alpha more than she wanted to admit.
Draco’s voice was low and quiet as he spoke honestly, “........I don’t want to do this.”
Fortunately, Harriet wasn’t an overly fussy person.
Draco appeared outwardly calm, but inside he was reeling.
After all their years as friends, Hermione still frightened Harriet when she was angry.
Outside, the waves continued their tranquil, never-ending roll as Harriet’s nails raked her alpha’s back, letting him stifle her cries with a hand over her mouth so their baby could continue his nap.
He imagined Harriet lying pitifully on a metal table while a group of muggle doctors pulled her innards out…...the mental imagine sickened him.
His hands felt good to Harriet~.
Ron was nowhere near as abrasive as Draco and he nodded back to his guest politely as he glanced at Scorpius and replied, “Congratulations to you too, Malfoy. He’s a fine lad.”
“May I not wait and see her for just a bit once she’s up?” Hermione asked Draco pleadingly.
Harriet sighed as she felt Draco’s fingers idly trace across her back from where he lay.
Harriet closed her eyes and took a deep breath.
Her eyes remained open when she felt him place his smooth hands on the bare skin of her back, underneath her nightshirt, and gently began to rub soothing circles into her tense muscles.
Ron had already taken his seat, but Hermione walked behind her to insure the flowing train of her veil didn’t get caught on the aisleways of the temporary benches that had been placed in the Malfoy ballroom.
Harriet and Draco finished their gelato alarmingly quickly and several seconds after, they bid Hermione and Ron brief goodbyes before they exited the shop.
Harriet didn’t care what the midwife said.
He should have been pulling her close and begging his omega for one last cuddle before they started their day.
Harriet closed her green eyes and took a deep breath as she listened to her alpha’s voice.
“You heard me, Potter.” Draco replied as he looked at Harriet with profound sincerity, “Run away with me.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harriet incredulously, “Potter, the war is over. You do know that, don’t you?”
Harriet smiled as she watched her pills disappear in the swirling rush of water.
Harriet had brought it up first. She took pills from Diagon Alley’s apothecary to block out her heats, for fear that she would give into her instincts.
Draco looked into Harriet’s green eyes and narrowed his, not in annoyance or irritation, but in sadness.
Harriet blinked and laid a hand on her belly as she listened to her husband, “........Is the company in trouble?”
“What does ‘cliché’ mean, Granger?” Draco frowned.
Harriet’s eyes were dull and her frown was even more exaggerated than his own as she gazed over the foggy grounds of Malfoy manor on that gloomy day.
Both girls had inherited Harriet’s bright, green eyes and messy, dark hair.
Harriet didn’t even bother to look up and Draco frowned, but he didn’t let her numbness halt his efforts.
Draco blinked for a moment and then he leaned down in the darkness to give Harriet a long, honest kiss.
In the two weeks that led up to the Malfoys’ tea date with the Weasleys, Draco’s quest for a baby crescendoed into an outright obsession.
Considering that he and Harriet had barely gotten to sleep by then, neither of them were particularly pleased when the inn’s attendant rapped firmly on their door.
Current students as well as faculty, staff, alumni, and parents had packed into the stands and they were all waiting for a proper match to watch.
Draco wasn’t put off by his mate’s reluctance. He was well aware of the ability he had to melt Harriet’s heart. For that reason alone, he was more than confident that he would ultimately win the war.
The midwife had estimated Harriet to be about six weeks along.
—————————————————————
“I’m fine.” Harriet reassured him. He watched as she rubbed her eyes to try and hide her blushing cheeks from him, but Draco wasn’t going to let her downplay what had happened the previous night so easily.
A house elf, whom Scorpius was very fond of, appeared at the end of the long hallway and as soon as Draco saw the familiar family servant, he ran towards the elf while Draco called out, “Go and sit with your grandparents at the table! Mummy and I will be right there!”
“Not for much longer.” Draco replied. His statement would have usually come with an arrogant smirk but the reality of the situation painted a very serious look on his face instead.
Harriet knew from the look on his face that he must have received her parcel.
Scorpius possessed his father’s striking looks and Harriet’s gentle, kind disposition.
It was overwhelming to Harriet for reasons she couldn’t fully explain. The unwanted touching and the sudden exposure of her naked chest felt like a violation against herself and her own intentions to help her baby.
Harriet was ashamed of herself but under Draco’s captivating gaze and his tender touch, the pregnant omega didn’t have the ability to maintain her efforts of pushing him away. Another sharp flutter landed against her rib cage suddenly and Harriet winced as her hand flew to the side.
The floors and walls were nearly black, with flocked wallpaper covering the area above the molding that wrapped around the room.
What was she smiling about?!
Could she not see that his wife was in pain?!
The tears began to pour so quickly and her shoulders shook so violently that Draco began to worry she would work herself up into early labor on her own if he didn’t calm her down.
He had even given up his room to Harriet, allowing her to sleep in his bed while he slept in a guest room after he saw how naturally she cuddled into the sheets that smelled so nicely of him.
His bedroom was closest to the Manor’s entryway and knowing full well that his parents wouldn’t hear the unexpected visitor in time to avoid Harriet waking from the sound, he threw on his robe, left the bed, and dashed down the hallway.
The healer shrugged, “Not quite yet formed enough to salvage, I’m afraid. If the mother doesn’t improve, I fear the pup may be lost.”
“I can nap with him.” Harriet replied as she looked back down at Scorpius.
—————————————————————-
Dear Hermione,
As the evening wore on and dessert was served after three prior courses, Harriet asked her mate with a laugh, “Alright, Malfoy, tell me the truth.”
The gothic parlor was piled high with gifts brought by the party’s many attendees, which numbered well over one hundred.
She sat up to look at Draco with wide eyes in silent accusation.
True to her word, the next day, the owls began to arrive at Malfoy manor with letters from Hermione.
The woman paused to peer through the textured glass…...
It felt good…...until she opened her eyes, at least.
“Potter~.....” Draco exhaled in a husky growl.
Draco wrapped his arms around what he could of Harriet and her middle.
—————————————————————
They were far too concerned with making sure their union had been undoubtedly consummated to consider slumber.
Draco smirked.
One evening, before Draco joined her, Harriet sat down on the bed with a pained sigh.
————————————————————
Between their secret ceremony by the waterfall, the feel of each other’s touch, and the cozy warmth of their room at the romantic inn, that night felt like a dream to Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy.
Trying not to drool, Draco took his hands off Harriet’s shoulders and cupped her heavy breasts in his elongated hands.
Draco’s scheme took some time to finalize.
Draco sighed and shook his head as he unbuttoned his suit jacket and slipped it off, “Nothing’s wrong…..Father isn’t happy that profits have fallen this past quarter. This morning was nothing but a circus of shareholders wanting to withdraw their money and executives begging them to reconsider.”
“Nothing, love.” Draco said hastily.
It wasn’t a hungry kiss or a needy kiss, but a long, slow, authentic kiss.
“Now, Dobby!” Harry snapped.
Harriet wouldn’t need to quit her job forever if they had a child.
Harriet and her handsome alpha delighted in the greatest joy that either of them had ever known……..the joy of love.
Harriet and Draco didn’t know much about wedding planning, but Lucius and Narcissa were completely prepared to make their only son’s special day absolutely unforgettable~.
A large part of Harriet was pleased that she hadn’t conceived during her first cycle spent in Draco’s arms.
Harriet didn’t respond, she just looked over at Draco and saw him grit his teeth.
She could never speak to him or see him again.
A hideous falsehood spewed out to expectant parents to stop them from fearing the approaching horror that was postpartum.
Draco woke when he felt movement in the bed and he watched with Harriet as the sun climbed into the sky.
“......But I just wanted to pick up a few papers.” Harriet frowned.
Draco watched in awe as that full head of blonde hair became a slippery, brand new little body in the midwife’s hands.
Potter, will you marry me?
Harriet grinned at Draco and he smiled back for a second before he turned and closed the door gently with a flick of his wand.
As every man in his position feared, Draco numbly considered what would happen if things didn’t go as well as he hoped, if Harriet rejected him and refused to be his bride.
“I wasn’t a coward and I’m not a scoundrel either, Father!” Draco retorted, not flinching and not backing down as he stared into Lucius’s frigid, grey eyes, “I’m in love with her! Her rejection of me isn’t my choice! I want to marry Potter!”
Narcissa remembered when Draco had cooed at her like that.
One particular healer was the last to exit and instead of bustling down the corridor with the rest of his team, he walked in front of Draco to speak with him.
“No.” Harriet said confidently, “I don’t have any reason to be.”
“What’s an ultrasound?” Draco asked curiously.
“That’s also correct.” Draco nodded, “This is my fiancé, Harriet Potter.”
Draco wanted to slap that stupid smile off of Harry’s face.
With one hand, Draco guided her head to lay against his chest and he began to idly stroke her hair as he whispered, “Please……..stop crying.”
From the look on Draco’s face, she worried for a moment that he would climax from her statement alone.
“What difference will that make?” Harriet asked.
Narcissa, on the other hand, reminded Harriet of an elegant spider. The Malfoy matriarch looked at the Potter omega like she was going to eat her.
As Dr. Krause gently ran the ultrasound wand over Harriet’s bare belly, the screen began to turn and change.
Harriet ignored Draco for a moment as her green eyes skimmed over the parchment in her hands:
“You don’t have to do that.” Harriet said as they walked across the street together.
The tailor had often wondered just how many black pieces of clothing the Malfoys really needed to buy, but he said nothing for fear of losing his best patrons.
Harriet stood in the bathroom one morning and frowned at her reflection in the mirror.
Draco was snoozing peacefully beside her. Her face softened as she looked at him and thought about the devotion he had shown her.
The smell coming from the omega was dizzying, maddening.
The next three days were busy for the expectant parents.
Draco held up a hand to silence her abruptly.
Harriet sighed and moved over in her nest to make room for Draco.
She and Draco would be newsworthy for a while and then once something else more interesting happened, people would move on.
When Harriet looked up at Draco and remained silent for a moment, his face fell in disappointment.
Making sure his fingers were moistened by a simple spell often used at the hospital for examinations, he let Draco lean on him so he could gently check her progress.
In the Roberts’ small living room, Draco came to grips with the nauseating fact that gold wasn’t going to solve his problem.
“What are you talking about? ‘A solution?’” Draco asked suspiciously, narrowing his eyes at the omega across from him.
Whatever the outcome was from the day’s disaster, he had to be strong for his mate.
Harriet poured one pill out of her pouch, into her hand, and then another and then another, until she had emptied the pouch of its contents.
How irritating.

Draco kept his scowl on his face as he took a step back. He glanced between Lucius and Narcissa in such melancholy disappointment that it disturbed both of them.
The new life she carried for him.
Heated arousal rushed through Harriet’s body as more of those delicious flicks landed there, in the best spot, while her alpha held his firm grasp on her supple thighs.
