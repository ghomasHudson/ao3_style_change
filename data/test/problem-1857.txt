Arthur let out a weary sigh, slumping down into his chair, eyes starting to fill with tears. He allowed his sons to guide him to the living room, Percy transfiguring their lumpy couch into a bed big enough for them all to lay in. Arthur flanked by his twins and then his eldest two sons, Percy heading off into the dining room to start fixing this mess.
Lyle’s grin grew wider, which seemed impossible, his arm wrapped tightly around Harry’s shoulders. “Yes! Siles, let me introduce you to Harry Potter, my clan’s adoptive son.” Harry squirmed uneasily under Siles’ attention, he didn’t know why, but the other man made his tummy flutter.
Sleep started to fall from Harry’s brain, face pressed into his soft blanket and body warm. He wished he could sleep for longer, but he was already at the point of no return. So he squinted. His eyes open, still a reflex from years of sight.
Godric had purposely kept Salazar within Gryffindor Manor for the last going on two weeks. So much had changed since the man was last awake that Godric knew if he just threw his mate out into this strange world with no prior preparation that he would have an absolute breakdown.
Minerva’s pinched face seemed to tighten further, her eyes were barely visible slits and her mouth nothing but a slash on her pale skin. “I knew you would be returning to retrieve your belongings, I put the school House-Elves on alert to tell me if the old
Harry noticed how Draco was staring at him unblinking, he couldn’t help the flush as he looked away. Draco’s ghostly gray eyes had always felt like an arrow through his body, and right now he couldn’t muster the courage to glare back. Instead, he looked over to Neville again, who was still watching Harry, eyes so warm.
“Do you and your family want what is best for Harry, his health and happiness?” Charlie asked, arms crossed over his broad chest. He had only had the pleasure of meeting Harry twice but from the moment he first saw those beautiful green eyes, face squinted up into a broad smile he promised to take care of him. This promise was reinforced the moment he saw just how happy Harry made Fred and George.
Anna suggested they eat the cake and ice cream Tiptop made while they all calmed down. Harry was relieved she suggested that because if he didn’t have this break, Harry was sure he would break down.
Harry pinched the tip of his ear where the fur was golden, the ear flicking away automatically at the slightly painful hold. The fur was extremely soft, and Harry found himself purring and his tail wagging behind him as he scratched at the base of his ear. The swishing appendage was the next to receive Harry’s attention. Harry turned, looking at his backside from over his shoulder. Where his skin slowly turned into fur was strange, he ran his fingers over the change, smooth olive skin seamlessly transforming into stark white fur.
Arthur still blushed when he thought back on it, ashamed he had fallen apart in front of his child. He was a parent and he had to be strong in his children’s eyes. It had been something Arthur had strived for every day. When Molly quit her job when she was pregnant with Ron, Arthur had been understanding. And when Ginny followed not even a year later, it had made sense for her to stay home, she had already had five children after all and Ron and Ginny’s pregnancies were much harder on her. But then she never went back, and Arthur was left to pick up all the slack. When they first got together she and Arthur had promised each other that they would both contribute to the household income so that they could both spend time with their children.
The skin from his forearms down was slowly turning black, red sales bursting through his skin and fingernails turning to talons that could disembowel in one swipe. “When I saw Harry at the Welcoming Feast I knew something was very wrong. But then you used that damned spell to make me ignore it! And beyond that, you ordered me to treat him no better than a worm. You dared force me to belittle and insult him!”
Harry startled when the floo flared, and a tall man stepped out, flicking his fingers out in a careless show of wandless magic to clean the ash from his silk shirt and black slacks. Harry couldn’t help the blush that covered his cheeks when the man looked at him, one red and one blue eye piercing into him like a brand.
“Another thing we need to speak about now that we,” Godric pointed between Sal and himself, “know Lord Black is in your care, it that we must discuss his younger brother Regulus.”
Sorry, this took so long, it ended up waaayyy longer than I planned. And by the end I was just too sick of working on this chapter to do as much editing as I normally would so I am also sorry about the mistakes.
Neville’s anxious nature was only made worse when Amelia mentioned during one of her often dinner visits to his Gran that Harry’s custody had been changed. Neville’s neck popped with how fast he looked over at the woman, listening intently. The way her square jaw tightened, and her knuckles went white around her knife let Neville know just how bad it was.
Harry’s observations were cut short by Issy tackling them. Only David’s much larger form kept them all from falling to the ground. Harry wiggled out of the older man’s hold so he could hug Issy properly. “Mummy, you are so pretty,” Harry whispered into her hair.
Harry was amazed. When he first entered Diagon Alley, he couldn’t imagine a place that could be any more obviously magical, but here it was. People were walking around with wings and tails, fur, feathers, and scales. Children were playing with magical toys, people flying above the streets with both brooms, flying carpets, and wings. Animals were following their wizards as they walked, one woman even being followed by a giant tiger with long front teeth. Vendors were selling thing’s Harry had never seen before, floating gemstones and magnificent armors. Furniture that looked like it was made from shell, bone, and exotic woods with all types of swirling patterns and colors. One chest of drawers in a window front was even glowing blue in the middle of the knots in the wood.
Albus’ magic once again burst from him in a flaming tornado that burnt the house down around him within seconds. The sound of the other villager’s worried voices and rapid footsteps was the only reason he made it out of the remains of the house before Aurors arrived.  It took every last ounce of his magic to apparate away. He was knocked out with magical exhaustion before he even landed against the hard stone face first.
By the time he had collected himself his joints all felt wobbly, like if he didn’t balance his weight just so they would collapse under him and his left third toe was tingling strangely. But all he wanted was to crawl under the covers and hold Harry. But he couldn’t so he just scooting a little farther onto the bed until his hand was touching Harry’s, too tired to consider what he had just done with that hand.
“Let’s follow the doctor’s orders!” Lyle lifted Harry into a bridal carry, pushing David off the couch where the wolf landed with an indigent woof. And started running for Harry’s room, David chasing them, playfully nipping at Lyle’s heels, while Bartok just chuckled at his younger mate’s antics.
He wished he could thank Tiptop but she was already gone, and from the green blush she had sported as she popped away Harry doubted she would come if called. Instead, he just decided the next time he saw her, she would be receiving a huge hug. For now, he just buried his face into the long turtleneck.
Harry studied all his friend’s features, one dark eyebrow always slightly higher than the other, and dirt smeared on the side of his jaw. For the first time since Harry had felt the urge, he reached across the distance, thumb caressing the strong line of Neville’s jaw, wiping away the soil. Neville leaned into the touch, eyes never leaving Harry’s as he nuzzled into the soft hand.
He stood there for three minutes, warm hand pressed to cool canvas. Finally, a head of wild curly blonde hair peeked out of the edge of the painting. Helga… She was so beautiful, looking like she did the day the school first open, eyes going wide in shock before she ran out to the middle of the painting, screaming in excitement. “Godric!?” She reached out as if to hug him before realizing that he was out of her reach.
So much had changed in these last few weeks, he had felt like he was cast adrift at sea but now, here Neville was, an island of calm in the midst of stormy seas. All he could do was hold on.
And now, almost twenty years after Bartok finished his Mastery, they still got together at least every other week. Even if it was just a quick lunch together at one of the cafes outside of The Council of Terradore’s main buildings. They always made the time. At least until the last two weeks, all Bartok had time for were a few letters and a short floo call, but Percival was more than understanding and was happy that his friend was now a father.
This was an argument they had been having for years. Anna didn’t like the risk Bartok took by working in Britain and his regular visits to the Ministry. Her objections were only born out of worry, her nightmares were filled by the Ministry capturing Bartok out of the blue. She had tried for so long to convince her mate to at least think of moving to Terradore where they would have more protection if he continued working on cases in Britain. But so far none of her pleas had worked. Anna knew it wasn’t because he didn’t value her opinion but because he cared too much for others and would never abandon those in need.
“Harry, that is our son’s name, on top of the abuse, had his magic bound and was stolen from. But this was systematic, the abuse was planned, done to keep him meek and downtrodden. While Harry knows about our findings, we have kept from commenting on what we believe might be the reason behind all of it. While I am not sure what the end goal of his treatment was, I am sure the theft was a major factor.” Bartok poured himself another finger, swallowing it back in one swig.
Arthur took the time for the potion to kick in by looking over Molly. She was covered in soot, something she would have normally done away with by a quick flick of her wand. The fact that she hadn’t done so was a sign of her emotional state. Though Arthur wasn’t sure why she was so upset at the moment, Arthur couldn’t imagine it was just the loss of money, but then again he didn’t understand anything she had done or the reasons.
“How could you?! Harry is like a son to us?” Arthur screamed at her, still unable to believe what Molly had done.
Remus’ wolf raged to go kill the ones who hurt his cub, but his human side wanted to cry. He could feel the same emotions coming off of Sirius, barely hidden, to keep the fury from scaring Harry. Sirius obviously was too upset to speak so Remus had to take the lead. “Harry, you aren’t unnatural, you aren’t disgusting, and you aren’t a freak. You are a young boy who is loved very much by many people. You are smart and powerful, and kind beyond belief. You are a son, a friend, but most of all you are Hadrian James Potter. You are perfect just the way you are, and anyone who says otherwise is wrong, and you should never listen to what those people say. You have been through horrible things, but none of them were your fault and you deserve better. And hopefully, now that you are safe, and with people who love you very much, you will get what you deserve.”
“It’s not theft since I am to be Lady Potter one day, we have every right to that money.” Ginny sneered, face almost a mirror of her Mother’s.
, to let them know they had a code red going on. Bill was the first to arrive and the twins were quick to fill him in. Bill was furious, the only thing keeping him from killing the woman was the devastated look on his Dad’s face.
Harry rolled over, face pressed into black wool as he groaned, he had been so comfortable and now he was awake. Harry just wanted to bury himself into Neville’s warmth and fall right back to sleep. But when he heard his friend
Neville was sitting on the edge of the near side of the bed, hands curled tightly around his knees, wearing a deep burgundy sleep outfit. When Harry came in, Neville looked up, searching his body for injury but for some reason when he looked at Harry’s lower half his face turned an even deeper shade of scarlet than previously, and he drew his knees up to his chest, eyes focused slightly over Harry’s head.
When the fire settled down, two men were standing in the middle of their room. One was tall with wild red hair and broad shoulders, freckles smattered across every inch of skin. The second was around a foot shorter than the other but his features were much more elegant and spoke of noble birth, dark hair in loose waves around his head and clear skin.
As he rounded the last turn to the corridor that held his chambers and personal lab he saw a figure, the warm torchlight flickering over a stern face. Severus didn’t know if he could trust the woman that was leaning against the stone wall across from his entrance way so he slowed and approached cautiously.
He had never before spent more than a few seconds looking at it, and the only time he noticed it was if his pants or underwear shifted strangely. Harry pinched the excess skin between his first two fingers, rolling it slightly. It was a strange feeling but it didn’t feel like much.
His wand was in his hand faster than a man of his years should be able, tip pointed directly between Molly’s eyes, killing curse on the tip of his tongue before he finally realized what he was about to do. He might hate the women but Albus knew if he was to kill her it would bring too much attention onto him. She wasn’t just a homeless muggle who he could take his frustration out on. The woman was also a useful tool he would hate to lose.
Harry woke the next morning with Neville close to him, but the only part of their bodies that were touching was their hands. Harry took the time to watch how the rising morning sun softened his friends…
“You, Mrs. Weasley, are not a licensed healer and therefore do not have the knowledge to deal with this sort of case. It’s more than just handing him the potions. We have to test him daily and adjust the doses to make sure they are working correctly. He is fragile, both from the abuse and his inheritance, and is still on bedrest.” Anna explained, trying to hammer it into the woman’s thick head. But she seemed just not to get it, opening her mouth to try another angle, luckily the Minister stood, obviously done listening to this bickering.
Bartok was quick to instruct Tiptop to retrieve a pair of his jogging clothes for their guests to wear. He thanked the House-Elf and dressed, the clothes almost a perfect fit, if not a bit small in the chest area and long in the leg.
But to Godric's surprise, when he finally got to the bit about how mates and bonds had changed, Salazar had just smiled a little sadly. Before saying that he understood and agreed with the change. Since it was now what was best for all of them, even if he was a little sad at having to share Godric with more people.
After they were finished eating, Lyle joining them at the table just before they left to make their way into the floo room, Anna instructed them on the address, and they were off.
A loud groan snapped him out of his daze, the sound coming from the door closest to him. Harry ran to the door, throwing it open, worried about someone being hurt.
The clawing terror when Hagrid took the key from him. The urge he felt to reach within Hagrid’s pocket to secret it away, swallow it and hold it within his body where he knew it would be safe. The only thing that stopped him was the thought of being found out, of being kicked back out to the Muggle world.
This vial had been a family heirloom from his Mother, given to her as part of her dowry when she married Septimus Weasley. All Black women were given two vials at marriage to ensure if anything happened they had a way to find out.
Harry was already at the dining table with Bartok, a plate of cheese and crackers between them, Harry munching away. David and Lyle joined them, reaching out to take a cracker but Tiptop popped in and smacked both of their hands with a wooden spoon. She glared at them both, but it was better than the wrath Anna could bring down on them. Especially considering they slept in the same bed.
Harry was silent as he rubbed his neck thinking over if there was anything he needed to ask. There was one thing he was still wondering about, “The- The bite marks and bruises I saw earlier… Are they supposed to feel good?” Harry asked Sirius, his Godfather flushing at the question.
But now Harry was in an unknown place, and while Auntie Amelia assured them Harry was in better hands, Neville still couldn’t help but worry. So when they got the Invitation to the Potters’ Will reading Neville could only hope Harry was there so he could check on him. To make sure the people he was living with now wouldn’t hurt his friend.
“Neville, he- he asked me to be his brother-” Harry started between sobs, shaking his wrist. Harry didn’t realize both Remus and Sirius were now even more confused, brows knitting into frowns. Harry continued, “And what if- what if he doesn’t accept me now?!”
The six Weasleys men, all without hesitation, reassured Bartok that they all cared for Harry, the twins going so far as to proclaim their love for Harry again.
Harry had foolishly wished that his Dad might have said something directly to him but this Will had been written when he was just a baby and his parents probably expected this Will to be read years ago, there was no reason for them to say something directly to him. So instead he took all those small bits of information about them and held them close to his heart, locking them in so he could never forget.
So, for now, Godric was slowly easing Salazar into the new world he would soon find himself in. He bought Sal sets of Muggle and Magical encyclopedia that covered a hundred years of history and development a book. Salazar had always possessed the same thirst for knowledge that Rowena did, though his want wasn’t just for knowledge for knowledge’s sake, so he was making his way through the books quickly.
Neville extracted himself from Harry's hold, his mate whining at the loss and gripping at the pillow placed within his grasp,  his tail coming to cover his face. Neville couldn't help the fond smile, spending far too much time just staring down at Harry. The knock at the door was what finally broke him out of his distraction.
By then they were running out of time, so all they could do was quickly portkey all the prisoners to the Gryffindor manor. The few House-Elf still living in the manor were happy to have fresh magic beyond just that of the ley lines and wards and were fast to help get everyone settled. When the Gryffindor clan was large, the manor had been used in times of emergency, a fortress against all that might stand against them. There was plenty of space in the healing ward for all thirty-six prisoners to rest, but the equipment and potions stored there were terribly out of date.
Too many people had already forced Harry to be and do things he didn’t want to and Sirius and Remus swore to themselves that they would never allow anything of the sort to happen again.
“I would like to share the memory of my Great-Aunt Dorea Potter, your Grandmother, giving James and me, The Talk.” Sirius took Harry’s hand in his, watching as his pup’s face turned hopeful as he realized what the bowl in front of him could mean. Here was a way for Harry to get to know his parents.
It was true that The Elder Wand’s allegiance was to the Magical to win it in a duel to the death, but what legend didn’t say was that it had one greater allegiance. The Elder Wand was bound to the Peverell line in a way that could only be a product of soul magic and perhaps necromancy. But the wand’s secrets could only be known by the rightful Peverell Lord.
Harry was surprised when Siles moved in front of him, holding out a hand for Harry to take. The boy did so hesitantly, not sure what Siles was doing when the grip wasn’t that of a handshake. Instead, the older boy bent nearly in half and kissed the top of Harry’s hand gently, barely a brush of lips before he was pulling away. He waved goodbye at the two and flooed away without another word.
Magic surrounded them, the war of his magic against his body finally stopped, and he finally felt at peace.
Remus coughed, getting everyone’s attention. “I know where Sirius is…” Harry also couldn’t figure out why Remus was blushing, but he decided to speak up as well.
“Is something the matter Arthur?” Molly asked, expression as if butter wouldn’t melt in her mouth. Her hands anxiously smoothing down her dress, gaze locked slightly over Arthur’s head so that it looked as if she was looking him in the eyes but she really wasn’t.
He was conflicted, on the one hand, Harry was his baby boy, and he wanted to roar at the young man touching his son. But on the other hand, he was happy to see someone who so clearly loved his son and would do anything to protect him. Bartok knew that Harry finding his mates was inevitable, but that didn’t stop him from wanting to hide away his son and to keep him young forever. Anna said it was probably harder for them since they had only had Harry for a month.
“Dorea always had a flair for the dramatic,” Remus commented wistfully as the woman pulled out her wand, flicked her wrist and pillows floated from the bed to rest in front of the settee a House-Elf popping in with a tea service with two mugs of cocoa and a plate of cookies. Finally, the two boys rolled from under the bed, Harry watching them both eagerly, drinking in the form of his young Father. Harry could see why so many people compared them to each other. But the longer he looked the more different they seemed, his Father’s features were sharp where Harry’s face was much softer, lips thin where Harry’s were full, hair pitch black where Harry’s was dark brown. At first glance, they were almost mirror images, but once you saw them side by side they looked nothing alike. They did, however, share their curly hair and tanned skin tone, their noses the same straight line that Dorea shared with them.
Godric was relieved as well as certain once the two had some time to get to know each other, they would get along easily. Godric just hoped he could find happiness with Harry, even if they were never romantic or sexual. But Godric thought Harry would easily charm the pants off of Salazar. Godric found he was less anxious about introducing Sal and Harry, in fact, he felt quite excited to see them interact with each other. Sal, the man he had known for what felt like forever, and Harry, the young sub he always felt drawn too would hopefully hit it off quickly.
The bust of Salazar he had made was comically incorrect. He had made it after Salazar was placed into his sleep; it had only been a hidden passageway, like that of the Slytherin common room. While Sal was dramatic, he wasn’t narcissistic enough to want a giant bust of himself. That was precisely way Godric made it.
Sirius hunched as if he had been struck in the solar plexus, a painful whimper causing Harry to look over at him in confusion. Remus reached over to take Sirius hand, knowing the man needed the comfort. “Harry, why do you think that?” Remus asked softly, he knew by the way Harry reacted that he didn’t truly believe what he said, that he was just parroting something he was told.
But then his wolf was howling in his mind louder than ever before, Remus stepped forward and kissed his mate just to get the wolf to stop. As soon as he did the howling calmed down into a contented purr, and Sirius was melting under him, both crying for everything they’d lost. Later that night, when they were curled together naked, but not having had sex, Sirius confessed in stilted whispers that he had been afraid Remus would no longer want him. That he wouldn’t be good enough for him or Harry. That he already failed his pup so much and wasn’t even able to keep his promise to take Harry in. That was when Sirius confided in Remus about what he had seen and heard that day on Privet Drive.
This chapter ended up to be the longest yet and has a rollercoaster of emotions, please let me know what you think of it because it was a very hard chapter for me to write. Be warned this chapter has a very short smut scene.
Harry fidgeted nervously on the couch between Anna and Issy, teddy and tail clutched tightly to his chest, there were three hours left before the Minister and Dumbledore were set to arrive, and Harry had been jittery the whole day. His parents had assured him many times that there was nothing to worry about, but Harry couldn’t help it. He was contemplating asking Anna for a calming draught, but he was trying to get through a day without needing one.
Behind those doors he built a mansion, he built, and he planned, and he invented, doing anything just to keep himself from going insane. He built the potions lab of his dreams, filling it with all known ingredients and spent his free time experimenting. He would send commands to his shadow self to collect old potions books, test theories. Dumbledore only thought he was doing as instructed, the man had hoped that with Severus’ aptitude for potions, he would be able to make money off of Severus’ inventions.
Tiptop had taken to dosing Harry’s food with nutrient potions to fatten him up a bit, so she was glad to see him eat so much. The moment she first laid eyes on the little Kitsuné, she claimed him as hers. His magic, even while in a coma was warm and welcomed her in like a hug, Tiptop had never felt anything like it before. That was when she swore to do everything in her power to protect her little Harry.
Sirius sat up a bit straighter and pushed Harry a little further away so he could say the next thing he needed to. “Now Harry, since you are now bonded, even if you are never sexual with any of your mates, we are going to need to have the Sex Talk with you.” Harry, unlike, the two adults didn’t blush, too naive to know this was something people were usually embarrassed about. Especially when speaking with people you considered parents.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter. While it's not much on the plot it has a bunch of world-building and background information.
As she broke down, sobbing about her lack of magic, something she barely had to begin with, Albus started planning in his mind. His biggest problem at the moment was the lack of magic. He could fake it for a while, but Dumbledore needed some way to fix that. There was a magical artifact he knew of that could temporarily borrow magic from another. It had been invented by Cortez Mogan for his squib sister, Carina, he made it so that she could use some of his magic to experience the feeling. Cortez was a well above average wizard and had the excess to support her using magic almost full time. Though they could only be small bits. The toll it took on the donor was double that of the spell used. However, Cortez rarely cast spells, a Runemaster and Arithmancer by trade.
Dumbledore allowed Fudge to do the talking while he just analyzed the man in front of him. He was tall, and if Dumbledore wasn’t so self-assured, he might have been intimidated by his physique. Instead, he saw what the man truly was, just another filthy creature that needed to be put down. Luckily, Fudge knew how to use his clout and authority and quickly secured a meeting at the creature’s home where they could plant evidence if needed to get Harry back within his control. He would bring Molly and Ron just in case to entice the boy into complying without a fight.
The cake was an elaborate raspberry cake with a delicious whipped cream frosting. A the top of it was sixteen candles, and when Harry was prompted to make a wish and blow them out, all Harry could think to wish for was to have this forever. He blew out the candles, and Bartok served them all.
A soft knock announced Anna’s arrival, the woman standing in the doorway warily, unsure if now was a good time to come in. Augusta waved her in, one hand still clutching at Neville’s. Anna surveyed the other two Longbottom’s condition, strong jaw tightening and full lips thinning as she assessed them.
Neville was surprised by this since it was a common topic in their dorm, well not so much common as it was something Ron prattled on about often. Everyone else in the dorm just ignored him, though now that Neville thought about it Harry was never there at those times. Neville also knew that Dean and Seamus tried to be scarce whenever Ron started in, mainly because of his homophobic views. And considering the two were dating they would often find ways to excuse themselves, faces always stormy, but Ron never realized it. Neville was the best at ignoring what Ron said and refused to let himself be driven from his own room. He just wished he had paid more attention to what Harry was doing during those times.
The marrow deep emotions they were all feeling was enough to let Bartok know that they had no clue of the plans and strongly disapproved of them.
“And what could that possibly be,” Remus growled, still feeling defensive over his helpless mate. He quickly glanced around the room, everyone’s wand at the ready but only Augusta looked like she was ready for a duel if it came down to it.
Godric couldn’t help the huffed out a laugh as he leaned down to kiss the other man, full of raw passion and the desperation born from years of separation. Godric pulled back, needing to see the other’s eyes again.
“And what will you both be doing about getting that evil man out of our castle?” Rowena’s eyes went sharp, her brilliant mind obviously already planning five steps ahead.
His sons were laying together on the couch, hands intertwined and George’s head resting against Fred’s shoulder. Arthur was honored that they were willing to show this level of intimacy in front of him, and he knew no matter what happened they would have each other. They talked quietly about the twin’s plans for the coming week, they were working on a new potion, they were way above Arthur’s level of Potions making. Arthur was so proud of their abilities and inventiveness, and when they mentioned they were trying to find a substitute for an ingredient they were missing, Arthur knew what he could do to help them. He took a mental note of the ingredient so he could pick it up after work tomorrow.
But now all Remus could hope for is that these people wouldn’t cut them out, that they would listen to what happened to Sirius and allow the man to be part of his Godson’s life. To not bar him from seeing his cub just because he was a werewolf.
The calming draught had already kicked in but Harry couldn’t do anything but desperately wish her Will had been longer. Wished he could have listened to her voice forever. But that wasn’t to be, and Helix’s gravelly voice broke him out of his longing.
Harry turned and started whispering to his mate, kissing Neville’s forehead before getting out of bed. Neville whined lowly before rolling over to sleep on his back, spread like a starfish. Bartok couldn’t help the low chuckle at the sight, Harry absentmindedly scratching at his belly. Harry was quick to dress, once again wearing the soft green jumper that Tiptop had knitted for him.
So it is Acute CHF that means that with time it can heal completely and hopefully a heart transplant won't be in my future. I still have to take a bunch of meds to help my heart take a rest and heal and have a lot of doctor appointments. On the 15th I will have a full heart scan to see if it has improved any since I went into the hospital.
“What were you going to do to Harry once you married him?” George asked, still stuck on the fact that there was a marriage contract that could destroy his brother and his future to be with the man they loved. Sure he knew his Father was distressed at the moment and wished he could go to him and comfort him. But he also knew they only had so long for the truth serum to last, and they needed to get all their questions answered now.
So instead, he showed his dominance by winning his clients the case. The more he pointed out how insane this whole witch hunt was, the more aggravated Dumbledore looked. Despite being clearly in the right, Bartok wouldn’t have won the case if a majority of the Wizengamot votes weren’t held by old families who still held by the old ways and took pride in their creature lineage.
“Lord Gaunt made you his heir after you defeated Voldemort,” Bartok skirted around the issue since this wasn’t the time to go in-depth about the subject and David still wanted to research. After Godric had come to them to warn them about the Horcruxes, since both Lyle and David were very knowledgeable about the Black arts, the three and Salazar started to get together to solve their problems. With the information Tom and Godric provided about that night, Anna and Lyle had secretly, in the middle of the night, checked to see if Harry was a Horcrux. Of course, as they believed, it came up negative, but none of them wanted to risk missing something.
“Of course, we all want to be there to support you, Harry,” Anna assured, Issy, clutching his hand within hers.
Luckily, Godric knew just the women to call for this emergency and Salazar would be more than happy to make the potions, just as soon as Godric got a potions text with all the new and improved recipes.
But now looking at them Harry could only compare them to the Dream Lilies that Neville had gifted him, and the roses paled in comparison. As Neville had claimed, the blossoms shifted with the passing sun, going from a stark white to a plum so dark it was nearly black. And its scent was beyond compare.
But now, so close to the time everything would change, he flamed away from the Headmaster’s office to his little mate’s side. The compulsion magic was causing his own to attack his body, but there was no way he would miss this for the world.
It was Harry that came to their rescue, sitting up, a grin spread across his face, tummy rumbling. And that was all it took, one happy look from those large emerald eyes and Tiptop melted. She cast a hovering charm on the young boy, his body following her out of the room as she mumbled about feeding him up. Harry just turned and waved at his fathers and started sharing recipes with the elder House-Elf.
Of course, Lady Magic takes into account the reasons for breaking an Oath that is outside of one’s control. And if someone purposefully forces another to break their Oath in hopes of the Oath giver losing something Lady Magic will punish the ones responsible.” David finished his speech.
With the Minister’s departure, it seemed as if Dumbledore regained his footing. “Come now, my boy, don’t you wish to spend the rest of your summer with Ronald? I hear they even have tickets to the Quidditch World Cup and that Ms. Granger will be joining them.” Dumbledore pressed, twinkle back in his eye.
Bartok looked between the two of them, trying to figure out why they were being punished. They both went pale, Bartok would have no problem telling Anna what happened. “I don’t want to know, do I?”
She was well known for her many trips into Diagon Alley, which Albus used to spy on the populace. He also had her twist rumors to blow them out of proportion or minimize them depending on what the situation called for. With all his positions Albus couldn’t subtly guide the opinions of the Wizarding community like Molly could, he was too public a figure and people were always on their best behavior when he was around. Even those who hated him didn’t dare go against him strongly in the view of others. While Dumbledore reveled in his rightful position in the spotlight, he did miss the days of anonymity.
Ron finally seemed to come out of his stupor when his mother started talking, years of her yelling, making him attuned to her voice. “Yeah, mate! We already got the spare cot set up in my room! And I got a new Quidditch magazine for us to read! It features the Cannons.” Ron said as if an article on the Cannons would be enough to entice him into leaving with them.
After thirty minutes of blasting at the wards, Albus finally realized that they were sucking in the magic he threw at them, only making the wards stronger. He left with a final fruitless
Siles blushed lightly, “Ah, I have yet to start the courting process so I would like to wait to tell you more if you don’t mind.”
He nodded, knowing that if he were in the Draken’s position, he would ask for the same. A screech broke into their conversation, and he looked over, spotting the snow owl he had gotten to know. “Hello, Mistress Hedwig, I also promise you I shall take care of your human.” He gave her a small bow, knowing that the sign of respect would go a long way in earning her trust. Harry probably didn’t know what Hedwig was his familiar and would live as long as he did, so the Phoenix wanted to make sure she liked him.
“Next the will of Lily Potter will be read, please continue to remain silent.” Helix opened the second scroll, a musical voice filling the room. Harry didn’t know what he expected but it hadn’t been the deep rich tone his Mother had. The basics of her will were the same, except for her message to her husband.
He and his Grandmother listened to what the head healer had planned to hopefully help his parents out. Shocked that there was so much they considered trying. By the time they left Neville was overwhelmed and ready to sleep.
Molly finally got her chance to speak up, fake smile plastered on her face in mimicry of human emotion. “Yes, we would love to take you in, Harry.” She turned towards the Minister, thinking that if she just smiled wide enough, she could convince him that it was for the best that Harry come stay with them. “Harry, the dear, has stayed with us for a portion of the past few summers. He and my Ronny are best friends, don’t you know? He loves staying with us,” Molly insisted.
“Father! Papa! You came!” The ghostly image of a young girl bounded towards them, hair long and wild and cheeks full and rosy. Unlike a ghost she was colorful, body blurred around the edges, but when she wrapped her small arm around one of each of their arms, they could feel her. Her skin slightly cold, muscles hard but magic welcoming.
Harry just enjoyed their company and the obvious fun they were having together. He listened to Remus and David talk about their respective research projects, focusing heavily on the efforts to find a cure for the infected werewolves. David told Harry about his work when Harry had still been blind, the day after he and Issy told him about infected werewolves. At the time Harry still wasn’t sure if he could fully trust the Claremores so he hadn’t mentioned Remus. He had, however, asked many questions in hopes that if he saw Remus again he could tell the man about the research.
Harry was about to reply to that when he saw something strange, walking towards the end of the bed where a pair of shoes were pointed up to the ceiling. “Ah, I see you found us,” Sirius sighed, “I was spending a week at the Potter manor between first and second year when this memory happened. As you can see me and James were hiding. Your Grandmother Dorea had mentioned at breakfast that morning that she would be giving us the Sex Talk. We were both so embarrassed we went and hid under James’ bed. Of course, that didn’t stop your Grandmother. If you would like to sit we can start the memory?”
What Sirius didn’t know, was that Remus had secretly gone to Lily and James and asked them if they would consider Lily being a surrogate for him and Sirius. They had both quickly agreed. Remus had been over the moon, making his two friends promise to keep it a secret so he wouldn’t stress Sirius out more. Sirius had grown rather withdrawn and Remus was worried about him. They had only found out two weeks ago that Regulus was dead, Sirius had been like a zombie for a whole week, and then he had raged, almost completely destroying their flat. The only things left untouched were Remus’ belongings and the pictures on the mantle. When Remus had come home to the destruction, Sirius in the middle of the living room floor crying his heart out, Remus had gathered him up, carrying him to their destroyed bed. Spending the next two days wrapped in each other, Sirius begging for Remus to fuck him hard until he didn’t remember his name. But Remus didn’t do that. He spent the time worshipping his mate, slow and steady while Sirius cried and continued begging for more.
Lyle burst out into guffaws, hand slapping down on the table in delightment. Harry looked at him in shock at the outburst, he couldn’t see what was so funny.  Lyle seemed to notice his confusion and choked out between laughs, “It’s a professional lock picking set. I love whoever gave that to you.”
Arthur, on the other hand, when not working would take the time to spend individual time with each of his children. Harry included. During this time he would devote all his attention to the child he was talking to, and even if he was busy doing something when one of the Weasley children came to their Father he would put down whatever he was working on to talk to them.
Dumbledore’s voice was flat, his fingernails cutting into the meat of his palms, blood rolling down his hands. “Each year, we have many students who wish to stay over the summer, but we have no right to keep them from their legal guardians. Nor do we have the staff to supervise them over the break. All students must go home to their families.” Towards the end, Dumbledore tried to sound reassuring, but it came out as condescending.
“Madam, while I respect your worry for your Grandson and his bondmate, they are both also our Bondmates, and while there will come a time when we are sexually intimate, both of us are adults who have plenty of experience handling our own urges. We have been alive this long and waiting until they both come of age isn't a problem for us.” Salazar was honest in his words, but his face and eyes were tight at her accusation.
Issy kissed them both goodnight, telling them to behave themselves or else. Harry giggled at how much redder Neville had gotten at those words. He doubted they would break a vase during a pillow fight like Dudley and Piers had, or accidentally leave the fridge open all night. “I promise Mum, we’ll be careful,” Harry replied causing Neville to blush deeper, his ears now cherry red.
Harry was relieved no one displayed their emotions openly. He didn’t know if he could take it after all the twists this day had taken without falling to pieces. By the time the story was over Sirius and Remus, along with the Longbottoms, were all grateful these people had been the ones to find Harry in his time of need. They were also curious about this mysterious Phoenix but when Neville asked, Anna just shook her head in a silent request to talk about it later.
“This was your Father’s childhood room in Potter Manor, the memory is paused if you would like to look around.” Sirius was gentle in the suggestion, not sure if Harry would want to look around or just move on to the talk.
The two young men sulkily sat down on the pillows Dorea placed on the floor. Sirius with his legs crossed and James holding his knees up to his chest, both avoiding the gaze of everyone in the room.
With the news of Dumbledore's threats planned to be released to the public, Percival had been appointed to be a bodyguard for Harry and the rest of the Claremores. They didn't want to risk Dumbledore or any of his followers going after any of them in retaliation. They all doubted anyone would be able to get into Garden Hill both because it was well guarded and because no one knew that is where the Claremores were currently living. Regardless, they all didn't want to take any chances and being family friends with the Claremores, Percival was the first to volunteer.
Siles was soon saying that he needed to go home and unpack his belongings, standing up to hug his brother as he did. It was funny to Harry to see how much taller Siles was then his older brother, and he couldn’t help the giggle that came out as Siles ruffled his brother’s hair, Lyle glaring playfully back at him.
I leave to Remus John Lupin of London, England, if he shall survive me, Vault 585 and the cabin at Howling Shores. In the case he is unable to accept this bequest, it is to be given to Sirius Orion Black of London, England. Remus, my best friend, please take care of yourself, Harry will need you. I want you to have the contents of this vault and house to make sure if anything happens you will be taken care of. Please use it, it’s one of my biggest fears that you will struggle unduly. Take this and use it, you know I have more than enough to make sure Lily and Harry are well off, so don’t worry about them. Also, please, make sure to balance out Sirius if the two of you have to raise him. And even if not, please make sure Sirius doesn’t go overboard, you know how Lily threatens to castrate him and I can’t imagine you would be okay with that.
If the previous three individuals are unavailable I appoint in this order, Guardianship of Hadrian James Potter until he comes of age at eighteen.
He couldn’t believe they dared look at him like that, he was the Headmaster of Hogwarts. He had reached for his wand, to blast them to pieces, only to find he was still in his sleepwear and his wand must still be on his nightstand in his chambers. Albus cursed under his breath, swearing that he would curse whoever had done this to him. He could barely handle the pranks the children pulled, but they were easily removed and for the most part, never directed his way.
Albus’ magic exploded again, ripping open the patches he had made to his core, everything in his office exploded outwards and Dedalus shooting from the room without even looking back. The whirlwind continued until his office was completely empty and his core was drained. He could barely make his way to the floo, stumbling as he called out Weasley Manor, only to see the office empty of everything besides a cheap glass orb Dippet gifted with him with when he became Headmaster.
His mate was curled into the soft pillows and blankets of his bed, and he couldn’t be more happy to see it. Harry looked better than he had ever seen him before. Long, dark eyelashes rest against tanned cheeks, plush mouth open and emitting tiny snores.
“I am sure we can reopen the case, it will just take us a few weeks of work.” Albus continued without paying attention to what the man in front of him was trying to say.
He had spent all his years in Azkaban imagining what they would say to him, their accusations and looks of loathing and disappointment. That more than anything was what the dementors caused him to feel. More than the Cruciatus his Mother had loved so much. More than the look of disgust his Father had worn anytime he saw his son. More than the memory of kneeling in rice, knees bloody, as he learned to read and write.
Helga gave a battle cry from her spot, looking more like the Viking princess she was then she did even on the battlefield. “Onwards!”
Lastly, they blood locked the room, only allowing direct kin to enter the room, and even then they wouldn’t be able to make any changes to the wards.
This way they could also keep a close eye on Harry’s mates to make sure they treat him like the precious treasure he is. So far they knew Siles planned on courting their son. Normally this wouldn’t automatically mean bonding, but since Siles was gifted with future sight, they had no doubt he would end up being one of Harry’s mates. But at least they all knew him and trusted him to treat their son right. That didn’t mean they wouldn’t still keep a close eye on the young Tengu.
Harry had to shake the strange image from his mind as the two more people entered the room, Harry had very little time to study the two but the woman did give Mrs. Malfoy a stiff nod. But with tension suddenly filling the air and everyone going stiff-backed, Dumbledore swept in, in hideously garish orange robes, looking around the room as if he owned it, His eyes locking on Harry, making the boy shrink back into Lyle’s side, turning to hide his face from the man.
Harry was lying in his bed, Neville on the other side from him. Harry had been preoccupied throughout dinner with the thought of how Neville would react to Harry’s revelation. He was still anxious but now, in the dark silence of his bedroom, teddy and Phoenix blanket clutched to his chest for comfort, he felt like he could whisper out the words. A small part of him hoping his friend was already asleep and would be unable to hear the confession. “I’m gay…” Harry tensed, waiting for Neville to burst into angry words or movements. But that didn’t happen, the bed shifted, Neville’s warmth coming closer.
“To the ward stone chamber, we have to… Well, Boudicca wasn’t the only one the fucker placed dark spells on.” Godric had to fight to the temptation to let his rage get the best of him. He had had the time to take in all the information, and now all of this was being dumped on Salazar, so, for now, he had to be the strong one.
They were all soon chowing down, the room filled with little moans of pleasure. Tiptop had really outdone herself today. None of them knew, but this smorgasbord was a trick for Tiptop to learn what was her little master’s favorite foods were. She noted that he was favoring the fruits over everything but was already on his second helping of eggs benedict which he told Anna he had never tried before.
She conjured an ornate chair with a flick of her wand, sitting down and smoothing out the fabric of her skirt, the two hiding boys slowly wiggled their way from under the bed, taking their time in an attempt to put off the inevitable.
Harry jumped up, hugging Issy around the waist and holding on for dear life. “I would love to have your help, Mummy.”
“I have already sworn an oath to Lady Magic in front of Harry, stating that all I want is what is best for him,” Bartok replied, knowing pulling the oath card would help his case.
I am really sorry it has been so long, my depression has been kicking my ass. I hope to get back to writing but if the wait is long again I am really sorry. But I promise I will never abandon this story!
Without his wand, and with his core steadily leaking, he couldn’t cast a Patronus to try and contact Minerva, so he had no choice but to apparate to his nearest safe house.
Bartok lifted the bracelet from its box. “This crest,” he indicated as he raised one with a sword and stage with an unknown gemstone hanging from it, “Is the Potter family crest, the family gemstone is a Fire Agate. You, of course, recognize the Ravenclaw crest. This one here, with the thestral and tome, is the Peverell crest, with its opal. Lastly, this is the Le Fey Crest, with its dual swords striking through a man with the family stone being an emerald.”
By the time they arrived at the Garden Hill manor Harry was already too tired to stay awake, it had been a stressful day and all Harry wanted to do was sleep. He didn’t even bother looking around his new home as David carried him to their new rooms. Harry was asleep before they made it up the stairs.
Bartok relaxed, even though he knew his friend would never hurt him, it was best to take precautions. “The Potter’s Wills were sealed by that man, and now that Harry was able to go to Gringotts and speak with his Account Manager, they will be read in four day. Unfortunately, Dumbledore was mentioned in the Wills so will be in attendance, I was hoping you would come in your official role as Head Auror as back up. I doubt he will try anything on Goblin soil, but it’s not worth the risk.”
Anna’s forest green eyes were piercing, making anyone she looked at feel like a specimen she was studying. Her eyes roamed over every part of Harry and David, checking for injuries, ever the healer. Her brilliant red hair, which made Harry miss the twins keenly, fell down to her back. And her moonlight skin was speckled with constellations of freckles. The milky way mapped across her body.
softly. Harry jumped up eyes darting around for danger but he saw nothing, just Neville sitting with his legs now pulled up to his chest, his eyes wide.
All five older Weasley boys looked over to Arthur sharply, shocked that he would ever do such a thing. Arthur, however, looked just as bewildered, “I never did such a thing and I promised never to do such a thing to any of my children.”
For the first time that day her features loosened with a small pleased smile as she shooed him off, waiting until he apparated away before marching her way back up to the school.
“Will you be staying until Harry wakes?” David asked, wondering what his son would think of this man suddenly showing up.
Now that she had access to her full core size, they could open the tap to the ley line. They only opened it the slightest bit, not wanting to flood her body. The small trickle already had the young girl relaxing further into the bed.
Remus was now facing away from them, shoulders hunched and ears red, mumbling lowly. “Oh, Harry, Remy wasn’t hurting me,” Sirius assured. But Harry didn’t believe him, now that he was closer to his Godfather he could see the many bruises, in all stages of healing.
Tiptop was the one trying to keep them all together, going about her knitting as if nothing was going on. The yarn, a fuzzy baby Alpaca fur, she was using the same color as Harry’s gem-toned eyes. She was also quietly humming to herself, an old song she would sing when Issy woke from a nightmare in her youth.
“Lucius, I know we haven’t talked in years, but I need-” Severus stuttered, his pride shattered as he begged for help.
Harry nodded at them both slowly and listened intently to the rest of the lesson Dorea had to offer. After she was done, Remus paused the memory to allow Harry to study his Father and Grandmother which his cub took full advantage of, sitting in front of both of them, studying the smallest details.
“You will be family one day, please call us by our first names. And even if you think nothing is wrong, I would still like to put you through I full health check. It has been over 2000 years since you last had a human form, and from your behavior, we concluded you were under some kind of binding. Both for your sake and Harry’s I would like to give you a check over.” Anna’s tone was that of a healer who would be willing stun you to get her way.
Lyle whined but after his brother kept his lips tight after begging to know more Lyle finally let it drop.
Before a fight could break out, Helix spoke up, the previously unseen Goblin warriors stepping forward menacingly with their sharp axes in hand, their attention focused on the Headmaster. “Mr. Dumbledore, if you will take your seat we can begin,” Helix’s voice was calm but the daggers he was shooting at the older wizard with just his gaze were deadly, and Dumbledore was soon sitting, taking his time as if it was his idea.
“Ah, that is the problem, if Salazar sees his chambers in such a state, he will throw a tantrum. If you have Elves to spare to give them a quick clean, I will be extremely grateful.”
At the sight, Harry realized they were having a sleepover. Harry had never had one before if you didn’t count sleeping in the dorms at Hogwarts or when he spent the rest of the summer with the Weasleys when Fred and George rescued him. Dudley often had friends stay over for the night and Harry had always been envious of it, their abundance of snacks and whispered giggling conversations well past midnight. Harry wanted a friendship like that. But here Neville was, about to have a sleepover with him, and Harry couldn’t help but smile widely, Neville blushing back at him for some unknown reason.
And then Harry tried to imagine kissing a girl. No one came to mind, Hermione and Ginny had betrayed him, he saw Luna as a little sister and those were the only girls he had even been close to. But then there was Katie, Angelina, and Alicia, he had gotten to know them quite well through the rigorous training sessions Oliver put him through. He had heard many boys saying how hot they were, and while Harry could see their beauty, he had never given them a second glance. But then there was Oliver, his exuberance for Quidditch lighting up his face, his hands on Harry’s shoulders after a training session when he realized Harry was in pain. Large warm hands encircling his neck. Water sluicing down his broad shoulders and muscular legs as Harry snuck glances at him as they showered in the locker room.
When Harry next woke he was surrounded by a pile of warm bodies, the room he was in completely dark. He could hear the slight snoring of David and Issy’s nonsensical mumblings in her sleep. A large hand reached over to rub at his scalp.
It was long and fluffy, white tipped with metallic golden fur. It shined in the low-light like a new galleon and Harry could figure out how it was real. Petunia had a dress that had golden thread embroidery she only brought out for business dinners, but the fur on his tail made it look like a cheap imitation.
Arthur’s knees buckled and it was only a strong set of hands gently setting him into his seat that kept him from falling to the floor. Soon a voice Arthur knew all too well was speaking up. His little boy was here. Arthur looked up to see the furious face of Bill glaring at the woman sitting across from them. “Are my Fathers still alive?” Bill interrogated, expression like a freshly sharpened dagger.
Severus sat back onto the bed in the guest room that he had been given by Lucius, the bedspread the finest Egyptian cotton that caressed his skin. The soft fabric tickling his balls, making him squirm at the new feeling.
Before he would work himself up any further the doors opened, Neville scanned the room, but at first, all he saw was six strangers and Professor Lupin. He started to deflate, his fears confirmed, but then his Professor took a step to the side, revealing a small teen. A teen that Neville cared about more than his own life.
Albus had calculated the vote count himself, and they should have had a comfortable margin. He quickly scanned all his people, looking for betrayal but they all looked just as shocked and disgusted. The Minister looked flabbergasted, and Umbridge looked like she was about to snap and start casting Unforgivables.
“Yes, it was created in such a way that compassion instead of hatred can also fuel it. While it is outlawed, people in certain lines of work have permits to use it. Such as livestock farmers and some healers.” Anna interjected.
Neville was standing there, looking worried before he slowly looked down, blush rising on his face when he saw that Harry was naked from the waist down. He snapped his head up, eyes locked onto the ceiling with its crown molding, an apology forcing its way through shocked lips.
“I would like you to check my Grandson when you have the time Mrs. Claremore.” Both women nodded in agreement as they bent down, Remus following them, focus trained on his mate.
“Moony, how are you? Have you heard from Padfoot? I want you to meet the Claremores… they saved me… and… they adopted me.” Harry had started off excited but soon he was obviously worried. Ears laying flat against his head and tail curling up between his legs as if trying to protect his belly from possible attack.
Remus had to bring it up, “Harry, I know this might be hard… but do you know if you like boys or girls? And just so you know Sirius and I, along with the Claremores, and anyone else who really cares about you won’t care if you like boys or girls, or both or neither. All that will matter to those who love you is that you are happy.”
“Good evening, Minister. I can spare a moment of my time to talk,” Bartok replied even though he wished he could just pop away. If he didn’t do this now, it would only get worse when the man undoubtedly cornered him again.
Issy studied Harry for a few seconds before throwing her head back and cackling, skipping out of the room with a jaunty wave. Harry was confused by her action but shrugged it off and headed over to his wardrobe to retrieve his sleeping clothes, the soft black silk, like water in his hands. When Harry turned around to make his way to the bathroom, Neville had already started removing his clothes, shirt tossed on the floor. Harry blinked rapidly at the exposed planes of tanned skin and hard muscle, his forearms like small tree trunks. Neville looked up at him from his bent down position as he untied his boots, his eyes shadowed by thick lashes.
“Salazar!” Both women squealed, tears flowing freely from Helga while Rowena tried to hold them in but failed. “You look just as handsome as always.”
By now they were all crying, Harry’s face hidden within the crook of Sirius’ shoulder, Remus wrapping the two within his arms. They sat together for hours, both Sirius and Remus reassuring Harry that there was nothing wrong with him and that what the Dursleys said was only lies. When Harry tried to say being gay was unnatural once again, Sirius asked him seriously, “Do you think there is something wrong with Remus and I loving each other like that?” Harry was quick to say there was nothing wrong with it and that if they were happy, that was all that mattered to Harry.
“If you need, you may cycle through the family crests or keep them invisible. Next, are your Heir rings,” Helix said as he pulled out another three boxes.
“Why don’t you tell us where you might have heard that before,” Sirius asked, more gentle that Remus ever thought he could be. One of Remus’ greatest regrets was his inability to give Sirius children. While Sirius had always said it was fine, when Remus had seen Sirius hold a just born Harry, he knew Sirius had lied to him. He never pointed it out but he had subtly suggested they consider adoption. But Sirius had shot that down, they were in the middle of a war and they didn’t want to risk putting a child in danger.
Remus had shakingly offered it to Harry, but by the worn-edges and place so close to Remus’ heart Harry knew this photo wasn’t for him. Even if he wanted it desperately. When he told Remus to keep it, the man had almost burst into tears of relief and that was when Harry knew it was the right thing to do.
Issy soon joined them on the couch as more people started arriving; Remus and the Longbottoms taking the seats closest to Harry. The two boys stared at each other longingly between people entering. The first to arrive was Professor McGonagall, her silver-streaked brown hair in a tight bun, wearing tartan formal robes. For some reason, when she saw Harry she looked shocked, but not disgusted, all she did, however, was give them all a formal nod before taking the seat next to Augusta as the two began chatting in whispered tones.
His friend has just asked him to be his brother earlier. what if Neville wasn’t okay with this? Worse they were bonded, and Issy had told him at one point that bonding was for life. He felt horrible, and Harry began to panic, a steel band around his chest, pushing his ribs into internal organs, heart beating in alarm and breath sharp. Unable to get in lungfuls of air making his face tingle.
Harry looked around the table, the bounty of presents spread out around him and thought, ‘This is the best birthday I could ever wish for.’
Severus, I know you haven’t replied to my many letters and that you had Albus send me a letter stating your wish to never to speak to me again, but I can’t leave it like this. Hopefully, by the time I have passed, we have reconnected. But if not, I beg you to read the letters to you in the vault. I am sorry I didn’t listen to you during fifth year, I was clouded by hero worship and didn’t take your concerns seriously. But now I know the truth and I am so sorry, so sorry, you will never know the depths of my sorrow that I lost my brother over such things. If you still don’t want to talk to me I am sorry that I am using my death to trick you into listening to my apology but I felt it was my last chance. I have told James to give you free access to my portrait if you wish it. Regardless of if you read my letter or not, know that I have always loved you.”
His mind yelled. Harry, filthy?! The sweet boy who had captured his heart, who Arthur had promised to protect as his own?
Bill cast a silencing spell on Molly and waited for Charlie to come back downstairs with Ron and Ginny. They were soon coming down, Charlie looking thunderous and Ron and Ginny complaining about being woken. Bill motioned them to sit and it wasn’t until they did that they seemed to notice that Molly was yelling silently next to them. When the two tried to stand Percy was the one to bind them to the chairs. The two started to scream but when Bill asked, “What do you know of the theft from the Potter vaults?” They both went silent for a second and then started to speak, both sounding disgusted by the topic.
Neville stood in front of the fireplace for hours, too anxious to see Harry to move or eat. His Gran had tried to pull him away but she eventually gave up after twenty minutes. He kept casting the Tempus charm over and over, the time moving as if through molasses.
Arthur knew the statement wasn’t quite true though. He would always care about all of his children but there were a few things he would not and could not, accept, even from his own children. But what the twins were to each other was one of the things he could abide.
Neville and Issy were both quick to plaster themselves to Harry's sides. His Mummy pulled his head into her chest, cradling his jaw in one of her soft hands, but the fingers of his left hand were tightly entwined with Neville’s, refusing to let go of his rock in this storm.
“So what would asking Lady Magic to pass judgment do?” Harry questioned, eager to learn more about this whole new world he found himself in.
Severus ran as fast as he could, muscles protesting at this unusual treatment. He desperately needed to get to Hogwarts before the Headmaster could. Now that he was free, he didn’t want to risk being under that man’s control again. But all of his worldly possessions were in his chambers and there was no way he could survive without them. Severus crashed through the front doors, too rushed to try sneaking about. He practically flew down the stairs into the dungeons, wand at the ready the entire time.
She was soon nipping him goodbye and swooping out the window and flying off above the garden. Harry saw her make a quick dive before continuing.
Fred and George let the tension in their body ease, their hands finally loosening in each other’s grip, hands tingling with the restriction of blood from holding each other so tightly. They smiled over at Bartok as Helix put away the crystal, and passed over a green journal that had Harry’s name in gold on the front. When Bartok looked at them both questioningly, George spoke up, ”It is one of our inventions, it’s a connected journal so that we can talk to Harry while we are apart.” Fred looked over to his twin, George’s smile blinding and Fred couldn’t help how his heart fluttered at the look.
Remus found out his wolf had always been right in its defense of Sirius and its distrust of Peter. His wolf had always been upset when Peter was around, and it only grew as they aged. Now that his wolf had proved it knew things Remus didn’t, he took to listening to its instincts.
“He is safe and being cared for and healed for past injuries from abuse,” Bartok said, wanting to let these people know that they need not worry about Harry being in his custody. All of the men relaxed at the crystal still green state but were worried about the abuse. “Did any of you know about Molly, Ginny, Ron or Albus’ plans for Harry Potter?”
She came back, dragging the much taller Rowena by her wrist. She too went wide-eyed when she saw who was in front of her but unlike Helga didn’t reach out, gathering Helga within her arms as a substitute instead. “Godric, we have waited so long to see your face once more. Where is Sal?”
"Harry slept like a log," He chuckled, the way Harry had conked out and then hadn't even moved an inch all night was endearing. "Unfortunately I didn't sleep as well. Seeing what happened when he touched the cloak was very unsettling for me."
This chapter took so long because I was in the hospital for a while and found out I have Congestive Heart Failure. It has been a really trying time and then my Grandmother died a few days ago. So I am sorry if the next few chapters also take a while.
Harry gently reach out to lift the parchment, the same magic he had felt moments before making his fingertips tingle. He lifted the perfectly circular seal as delicately as he could as to not destroy it.
This chapter was meant to be much longer but since I needed to rewrite the whole thing and that was taking much longer than the initial writing for it (which only took me like 3 days) I decided to split it here so you didn't have to wait any longer.
Molly’s face was now predatory, seeing the weak spot and attack. “No, you married my horrid Brothers, and your sister birthed your awful spawn, especially those twins of yours, I am just lucky Albus bound their creature sides. But Albus said I had to be with you so no one would question who Ron and Ginny’s Father was so we used an ancient spell that changes people's perception to believe it was me they saw instead of those freaks.”
If this was any other time, Sirius would have laughed at how wrong Harry had misread the situation. But his Godson was so obviously distressed that Sirius could do nothing but pull Harry back into him, the boy’s face hiding back against his neck, his skin and collar soon wet with tears.
“And both of you are looking as lovely as ever,” Salazar said with a flourish, bowing to both of them.
There had been many clues as to Harry’s home life, and Neville and tried his best to get Harry out of the situation he had been in. When he told his Gran and Aunt Amelia his suspicions, they had both been shocked, however, when Neville asked a few days later if Harry would be removed, Amelia just looked away from him. Not daring to meet his eyes as she left, leaving Augusta to let Neville know that while Amelia had tried her best to check on Neville’s claims, someone had blocked her at every turn.
So far he hadn’t been left alone since they were worried that Fudge would try to pull the same trick he tried with the DuMone Clan and show up early. Harry had barely been able to down one finger sandwich, but when the rest of his parents finally finished whatever it was they were doing, he finally relaxed fully.
And suddenly Remus was alone, his parents having died long ago and the family he had built for himself, destroyed from the inside. Werewolves were not meant to be alone.
Neville was devastated, and he took it into his own hands to do all he could for Harry when they were together. He had unlikely partners in crime with the twins. They had seen him trying to slip a general healing potion into Harry’s goblet during their first breakfast back. Their intense blue eyes pierced him and stilled his hand, they were soon manhandling him off to an empty classroom.
Arthur was surprised but he didn’t think there was anything wrong with Harry if it was true. He couldn’t believe Molly would think such a thing when both of their families had a history of creature members.
They just smiled and began stuffing a bag, that Salazar seemed to produce from thin air, full of everything in the office they could get their hands on. Swiftly dismantling any alarms or locks and shoving everything away into the small pouch. Soon the room and the Headmaster’s quarters were devoid of everything but the man’s atrocious clothes. And those Salazar set on fire out of spite.
“When this crystal is activated it will glow red if someone is lying, myself and Mr. Claremore will be included in this. If you do not wish to answer any questions asked you do not have to but know depending on what the question is, it may affect our view of your intentions and actions.” Helix set the crystal in front of him, tapping it with one long boney finger, causing it to glow a brilliant green.
He couldn’t help but relax back into the seat, eyes fluttering closed at just how loved he felt at that moment. It was unlike anything else he had ever felt. After a few minutes of Harry basking in the warmth, Helix cleared his throat to get his attention. Harry sat up, embarrassed as he reached out for the next box. The Peverell ring, while welcoming, wasn’t nearly as strong as the Potter ring. When the Peverell ring touched the Potter, the two combined splitting the ring in half The Le Fay and Ravenclaw rings doing the same until there was only a single ring on his finger.
Arthur didn’t know what he would do. Molly was easy, they were only married, and unhappily. But Ron and Ginny were his children, who he had sworn to protect with everything he was.
Harry forced his mind not to wander. Before coming here, he had always lived in the moment, not having the luxury to go over his past or feelings. But now, with the safety, his new family provided and the past two weeks of extensive bed rest it was one of the only things he could do. His voice broke when he spoke, but he plowed through it, “Thank you.” Harry wished he had more to say, but his feelings were all over the place, and he couldn’t find the words to express everything. So instead he just holds onto Anna’s hand like it’s a lifeline.
Sirius glared at Neville when he tried to get close to Harry, a growl rumbling deep in his chest until the other boy raised his hands and backed away. Harry looked up at his Godfather, confused at the man’s reaction, but Sirius just glared until Neville took a seat next to David. He then buried his face in Harry’s hair, taking in deep lung-fulls of Harry’s scent. He ignored the weird behavior to focus on Augusta, who had retaken her seat and was speaking again.
Harry couldn’t help but run his finger along the words, rereading it twice before placing it down gently and opening the package. Inside was a leather case, obviously Muggle by the zipper that held the two sides together, he turned it over and noticed that it was also embossed in gold with his name. Harry was confused by was inside, there were ten metal objects, they were a flat metal on one end, and the others were made up of all different shapes.
Harry was so focused on staring over the grounds that he missed when Tiptop brought in breakfast and sat down. He only noticed it when the scent of bacon filled the air and Hedwig came zooming in through the open window, landing right in front of the plate of her favorite snack. She shamelessly started munching on the bacon, ignoring Tiptop’s glare. Harry, however, smile fondly at his friend, reaching out to pet down her back.
Instead of the tears, Godric expected Salazar’s eyes were stoney, as unforgiving as they were when he was in his Basilisk form. The words came out as a hiss, barely even English, “What are we waiting for?” He hopped out of bed, a quick switching spell having him in his battle robes. Feet being shoved into dragon hide boots.
Dumbledore started to make his way over to Harry, but before he could get any closer Remus jumped up, body fully unfurling for the first time in Harry’s memory, easily over six foot. A deep almost inaudible growl echoed from Remus’ chest, and Harry caught the look of disgust Dumbledore shot Moony, hand twitching towards his wand. That was when Neville stood as well, shoulders still a little hunched and a full step behind Remus, but he still stood.
Harry looked over all his interaction with the people he cared about. And that was when he realized all the people he trusted the most, at least that weren’t family, were male. Harry was sure this didn’t automatically make him gay, but it gave him a place to start. He tried to imagine kissing Neville, it was easy to imagine. Too easy. He could imagine earlier, when they had been so close after lunch, leaning in and just pressing their lips together like he had seen Anna do to his other parents.
Neville was put at ease with how comfortable the room was, the chairs looked soft and welcoming, unlike the stiff ones he had come to hate at St. Mungos. Head Healer Lorraine was behind her cherrywood desk, two files to her side and a tea service in front of her.
“When I came home from my workshop, mother told me Vippy was helping you move, I wanted to come to see what was going on.” Siles leaned forward, obviously worried for his brother and his family.
Harry went stiff, confused at what his Mummy said. He looked up at her, unaware of his mouth hanging open. “Bond?” His voice squeaked out.
The image made him blush, and it seemed like the most natural thing to have done. Harry wondered why he hadn’t just leaned in.
“You know where Siri is? Is he okay?” Harry asked in a hurry. Ever since they parted, Harry had felt this constant nagging worry.
She had to be strong now that things were more turbulent than ever. So she mustered her courage, pulling it around he like a well-worn cloak and demanded the two men in front of her take her to Regulus.
“Please, Father, remove the evil man’s bindings from me, I am dying!” She screamed and went silent, the bindings strangling her voice.
Neville looked down sharply at him, examining every inch of Harry’s body, looking for injury, until he once again saw Harry’s naked thighs gaze forcibly redirected to the ceiling once more. “What- I mean- How did it attack you, are you alright?” Neville asked voice still riddled with worry, though now it held a note of something that Harry didn’t recognize, it made the other boy’s voice deeper than normal.
The Minister was now just sitting back in his chair, arms crossed and face red as he took in all that was said. Molly looked just as furious, but more so because Harry had dared to yell at the Headmaster. Ron just ignored everything that was happening, sporting the same look he did when he was daydreaming about the Chudley Cannons, and Harry felt nothing but disgust towards the other boy. Here they were discussing the horrific abuse Harry had gone through, and all he could do was think of himself.
“Thank you for attending the reading of the Last Will and Testament of the late Lord and Lady Potter. As per the request of the Potter heir, Hadrian James Potter, the Wills have been unsealed; the sealing of which is currently under investigation. However, we at Gringotts will now read and adhere to the Potter’s last requests.” Helix pulled out a stack of documents, placing his half-moon glasses onto his hooked nose. Harry barely recognized the small hand intertwined with his own, all his attention focused on the Goblin in front of him.
He ate his food almost mechanically, even though it was delicious as always, as he thought about how Neville would react to seeing their gardens, what expressions he would make and how his magic hummed when he was around plants.
Sirius choked out a bark-like laugh, “You’re sorry? No, Lils, I am the one who is sorry, I failed you… Harry he…” Sirius covered his mouth to try and stop his sobs,
Sirius told Harry that he, Remus, and anyone of the Claremores would also provide lube and contraceptives if Harry needed them. Harry could only nod numbly, still too shocked with all the things he was learning.
The twins were bouncing up and down in their seats at the news. Arthur smiled softly at his boys, and Bartok could see how much the man loved and cared for his children in that one look. Arthur looked over at Bartok, sharing a knowing look that they would be family at some point.
As soon as Harry’s fingers touched the smooth length of wood, the wand came alive under his fingertips. Hundreds of ghostly animals in all colors bursting from it. Stampeding around the room, being led by a silver thestral. Before they all charge for Harry, colliding with the boy in a brilliant display of colors.
“I vote for going home!” Lyle cried, clearly wanting to leave this all behind them and get back to their regular routine without the risk of Harry being taken. All the paperwork was finished, and the House Elves had finished moving the two beds during the meeting. They all said their goodbyes to Percival who bowed towards Harry and said it was nice meeting him. Harry was quick to thank him for defending them, and then they were being swept away by green flames.
Harry nodded, cheeks a dark red, “And you’re sure… it’s okay to be gay, and that no one will hate me for it?” Harry seemed so much younger than he really was at that moment, like a child who had just broken a vase and was worried his parents would hate him for it.
“If you don’t mind me asking what was this shocking news?” Bartok queried, wanting with all his heart for a reason to believe these men. Harry cared for them so much that he couldn’t help but want them to have not betrayed his son. But he was still wary and wouldn’t believe them without using truth serum, he wouldn’t allow anyone to hurt Harry, and if there was any chance they would, he would cut them out faster than they could say lawsuit.
That would have to work for now until he could track down the source of the rumors he had once heard of a way to break a decree Lady Magic set. At the time Albus heard them he had never thought anything like that could happen to him, that was why he hadn’t followed up on them at the time. But now he was kicking himself for not doing it when he first heard them.
Helga huffed and placed her hands on her wide-set hips, stern mother face on. That face had always made everyone to see it spill all their misdeeds. “Well, go to him! Make sure to bring him back here to visit us!”
