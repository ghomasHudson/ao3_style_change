“And that’s just the average. Some years it’s more. Sometimes they use wands passed down from family members, and sometimes their parents have to try to find other economical ways of obtaining them. For students with non-magical families, we’ve even found people selling them fraudulent wands. The student and parents don’t know how to tell the difference.”
. And the man nodded as he lowered his hand again, “But…” It didn’t make sense. “Y-you’re supposed to be my age?”
Draco hesitates and gives Harry a questioning look. “What’s he saying?”
Ernie was the actual manager, though, and more than half of this mess was his fault, so Draco shot him a glare, hoping to hide his rising embarrassment over his momentary lapse of attention. “How do you expect me to find
. Draco rolled his eyes at his own folly and walked in the direction of the feeding paddocks.
Except, Draco still refused to believe it. Even as the people around him screamed out their despair, even as he witnessed Potter’s lifeless body being placed on the ground at the Dark Lord’s feet, Draco just
Harry doesn’t really know what to think but eventually decides to give Malfoy a fair chance before writing it all off as poppycock.
Draco, you daftie,
“Oh, I never said I’d turn down an offer of help.” Those emerald eyes were sparkling now, Draco could hear it in his amused tone. “Not if you’re volunteering…”
Not that I don’t know why, I do, but being here again makes all my past excuses seem so trivial.
“No, I—” Harry said faintly even as he tilted his head to give the man better access to his heated skin.
Yes, I’m here. Didn’t really know where else to go, to be honest, now that my Hogwarts days are officially over, so I let Ron and Hermione talk me into coming here with them. It’s actually not as bad as I remember it being over Christmas, even if Fred’s absence is still lurking in every other corner. I think it being summer helps, what with the weather allowing for being outside and all. Somehow, it’s easier not to be reminded that someone’s missing when the people who are left are all spread out in every direction. Easier to pretend he just popped inside for a minute instead of having left for good.
Draco dropped his head in his hands. Telling Sirius was supposed to help. Why the hell did he feel like things had just gotten worse?
“At work?” Draco cut in, saving Harry’s imminent blunder. “Yes, I— It’s been a looong day…” He grimaced and made a good show of stretching out his spine with one hand on the small of his back. “You know, travelling all over the world in one day really takes its toll on…”
PS Teddy is a perfectly valid name, you poncy git. He’s named Edward Remus Lupin, after his father and grandfather, and it suits him just fine.
Harry didn’t know if Draco would still be there when he came back down. For all he knew, the man could have come only for the boy’s sake. He probably had, too, if his choice of appearance was anything to go by. Harry didn’t want to hope, but he did. He didn’t want to look back at Draco as he exited the room, but he did. He definitely didn’t want to catch Draco watching him with twinkling eyes and an amused smile curving his lips. But he did.
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but Harry kept going.
Harry runs his finger along Orion's spine, making him stretch under his touch. "
? How? When?”
Charlie’s eyes brightened. “Yes, she sent a card. Most dragons wouldn’t bother, but she’s a special one.”
Draco approached, careful to keep his voice low as to not frighten the animal. “Hey there.” He sat down on the bench, hoping to entice the dog closer. The dog didn’t growl or give any warning signs, so Draco waited, then spoke gently. “Are you lost? Can I help you find your family?”
Then there’s Aya Ambarella, a thirty-something witch from South America. I have no idea where McGonagall found her, but she went to Castelobruxo and hasn't set foot in Britain before this past summer. She teaches Defence, or, as it’s called now, DAHM (Defence and Healing Magic). I don’t know why we’ve never been taught basic healing before — I certainly could’ve had good use of it these past few years — but I can definitely see the logic behind combining defence and healing. Most students seem to like the change and according to Professor Ambarella, this is how they’ve always done it at Castelobruxo so it obviously works.
“He’s been home too much lately. I haven’t been able to take him to the Reserve this week, given everything else going on, and it’s not good for him to be alone so much. Foxes are pack animals, you know, and I’m his pack.” Draco looked down at the crate in front of him and used his wand to spell off the top. It was the oil portrait promised by Dean Thomas. He reached for his clipboard and checked off the auction item before levitating it to the easel prepared for it on the far side of the ballroom. “Besides, he’s still a baby.”
He sighed and tore off a piece of his sandwich, tossing it to the dog. He took a bite of his own and chewed thoroughly before continuing.
Draco opened his mouth but nothing came out.
Sent: Well, I need to find you first, you dolt!
“But you are, my love. You’re such a good boy. Just lying here, taking it so beautifully.”
, they said.
“Perfect! Want to come over to my place?”
“Right.” Draco nods decidedly. “I… I’ll be back… I’ll just…” He motions with the flower before disappearing into the kitchen without another word.
Draco grinned. “You’ve seen it! Well, you know Charlie and his dragons.”
No, Potter had played him, all right. And he’d done it so convincingly too, all sweet smiles and twinkling eyes. Hell, that kiss on the forehead still burned hot on Draco’s skin more often than not. He still hadn’t figured out Potter’s reasons for the visit, what difference it could possibly have made in the grand scheme of things. If it hadn’t been just for kicks, of course? Just another way of taunting him and making his life miserable. Which, Draco admitted, certainly could’ve been the case. Dangling that tempting vision in front of Draco, leading his naive mind to believe in things too good to be true, making it wish for things that could never be.
— yelped as he bumped directly into Harry Potter.
you look ok, so there’s that.
I may not have liked Snape, but no, you’re right, by the end I probably wouldn’t have been able to kill him, no matter the circumstances. Did you know he and my mother used to be friends once, before they went to Hogwarts? And here’s another surprise for you, not that you’ll ever believe it: he actually was on ‘our side’, not Riddle’s. Yes, I know how it sounds, i.e. crazy as fuck, but it’s true. I didn’t have it confirmed myself until the night of the final battle, but as it turns out, he was the Order’s bravest and most loyal spy, right to the very end.
She rolled her eyes, but her voice was soft. “You’re the only one without any other obligations.”
A smile crossed the girl’s face. “Great. I have your fiancé’s belongings. They told me to give them to you so you could take them home? We don’t like keeping valuables around in case anything gets lost.”
It’s not like love is a regular topic of conversation between them or anything. Not that they never talk about philosophical stuff; they do. But
“I’m sure he will.”
Saturday 7 August 1999
notice. I just don’t know how to do it. I’m not like you, who learned to perfect the patented Malfoy Mask of Indifference long before you even had anything to hide. Unlike you, I’ve always worn my heart on my sleeve, unable to hide anything from anyone, unable to compartmentalise my emotions the way a gifted Occlumens like you can.
The look on Malfoy’s face tells him all there is to know. If Harry were to return with only one purchased item from this shopping spree, this would be it.
“I do,” Draco blurts with a slight headshake. “I most definitely…”
“Harry?”
Her eyes widened. “Because you said you were going to marry him. I mean, you were out of it, but you were talking about not wanting to have a crispy groom.”
“Oh, Helga, I’m so sorry, Draco.” And she did look sorry. She looked like somebody had kicked her crup, actually, and all at once, Draco felt awful for getting so angry at her. “What are you going to do?”
The sound of the pouring rain filled the silence between them as they traversed the uneven ground. Draco’s thoughts wandered freely, contemplating Harry and everything Draco was learning about the man he’d become. A few minutes passed before he eventually decided to voice a question that had puzzled him for over a decade.
Harry dropped his gaze to the floor and shoved his hands deeper into his pockets, his shoulders slightly slumped as he shrugged. “I blow glass. It’s something I picked up as a hobby after the war. I like to give them as gifts, or sometimes donate them or whatnot.”
” Ernie’s voice jumped an octave. “How could you not tell me?”
“I don’t want to hurt them.”
She raised an eyebrow, suddenly interested. “Harry? Since when has he been
“Yes.” Harry’s smile subsided, not fading completely but turning more serious, wistful. “Listen, Draco,” he said, tightening the hold of Draco’s hand. “I won’t lie to you; not everything is going to be sunshine and rainbows. There are rough times ahead, worse than either one of us should ever have to live through.”
I’m at the academy five days a week, and Hermione’s off at uni most days (she’s studying law at Wixbridge now), only coming home to sleep before leaving again in the morning, apparently. Meanwhile, Ron works evenings and weekends at the shop more often than not, and whenever they both happen to be free at the same time, they have their new home to occupy them. That, and their seemingly never-ending lovey-dovey phase (which I’m still not all too keen to intrude on if I can help it).
“Uh, thanks?” Draco turned to Molly and strode over to give her a hug. “I need to go, though. I’m pretty tired.”
The wheels had quickly been set in motion and Draco had been caught up in a relentless whirlwind ever since, overseeing a total refurbishment of the space, working out the finances, the marketing, contracts with suppliers…and the menu. The vision had always been to bring the real Muggle thing to the wizarding world, and that was still the main business idea. However, the more Draco had thought about it, he hadn’t been able to resist the opportunity to put his own magical touch on it somehow, offering some hints of familiarity to ease the wix of Britain into the new concept.
"No," Harry answers, smiling. "You promised me once, in this spot all those months ago, that you'd fly with me one day. I want to fly—" he runs his hands up Draco's back to where he knows Draco's Veela wings are magically hidden away beneath his skin "—with you.
“I know,” Sirius replied, his voice firm.
Now it’s Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “I was never your saint, Draco,” he says, pinching that sensitive nipple again for emphasis. Draco instinctively bucks against him, arching his back to meet Harry’s touch. So beautifully responsive.
“I missed it sometimes, of course I did, especially in the beginning. It was all I had ever known, after all. But it’s not like coming back would ever be the same, I—” He swallowed around a sudden lump in his throat. “I know I’m not welcome there anymore.”
“Now, a
“It’s the wings I smell, then? Merlin, that’s lovely.”
. Three sharp knocks on the front door. Harry frowned, stilling his hand.
Draco looked at the phone and frowned. “How’d you get my number?”
Harry was shaking with suppressed laughter now, and Draco couldn’t help letting an audible snicker escape his own lips. It was all so ridiculous. And yes, perfect.
Entering the hospital room again felt strange. After yesterday, when it had been filled to the brim with people, it just seemed…empty. The steady beeps from the monitoring charms comforted him, though, and Draco examined Charlie’s sleeping face.
Without warning, a burst of red shot by him, mere inches from his left shoulder, hitting the back wall with a blinding crash.
"Merlin, Harry, you're incorrigible. Now, I'm here, and there's not a book or study sheet in sight. What did you have planned?"
Draco loved that bowl. He’d loved it from the moment he’d set eyes on it, the deep red ruby glass that curved up just enough to be a bowl, but not enough that it’d actually hold anything. It had spoken to him, and he’d bid high, wanting to ensure it’d be his.
“He took…?”
Charlie chuckled and rolled his eyes. “Calm down, man. If he wanted to make a big entrance at his own wedding, it’s his right.”
Sent: Left? You mean right, right?
He’d found his way to this hidden alcove shortly after Potter had saved his sorry arse,
“A—” Startled by the unexpected bluntness, Draco looked up to find deep-blue eyes twinkling back at him. It wasn’t the first time he’d been propositioned at work; men and women alike had a tendency to confuse his professional joviality with genuine interest. And it wasn’t like he could deny this bloke was attractive, what with his disarming smile, sandy blond curls and that well-defined, stubbled jaw. Honestly, had it been just a week ago, Draco probably would’ve taken him up on his offer. As it was, though…
So he’d come. But between meals, he’d so far spent all his waking hours in here, in the vast family library, going through endless shelves of wisdom and nonsense, in search of… nothing in particular, really. Just anything to keep himself occupied and as far away as possible from the Dark Lord and his snake and…
Sent: And I think you've done enough drinking for the two of us...
. Didn’t help him much now, though.
“It's just,” Harry started, shoving his hands into his pockets and hunching his shoulders, “George said— And then the whole apple-and-cheese thing, I—”
“He’s amazing, isn’t he?” a familiar voice came from behind Draco, making his stomach flutter most pathetically.
“Hermione. Seriously. Stop. It’s fine. And if he wanted to, he could have talked to me too, you know, any of those times we’ve bumped into each other. The fact that he hasn’t just goes to show that he’s not interested in being my friend. Besides…” Harry stopped himself, thinking better of it.
“Well, I suppose if you’re counting the effort I put into discrediting you and accused you of lying to everyone… And let’s not forget the time when you were kindly helping me move all the firework equipment, and I showed my appreciation by insulting you. Or, maybe you’re talking about when I accused you of flirting with your neighbour and then proceeded to announce to all your friends and colleagues that you were pregnant?”
And now he’d gone and done it again; cursing an innocent victim with an unforgivable, harming another. And once it came out, Draco was doomed. He'd be expelled for sure. And without access to the school, he’d be unable to complete his task for the Dark Lord, which meant…
And you think you can dare me into becoming gay? Ha. Good luck with that.
They walked side by side down an aisle of the large storeroom, the stock all neatly labelled and lining the shelves in sizes that would be easy to grab and restock the shop. Draco tried not to be impressed.
“Yes, I think we both have.”
“Yes.”
“Sure,” Draco says as he appears in the doorway to the living room, glancing over at the telly while Harry takes in the sight of him over the back of the couch. The sparkling eyes, the soft, white-blond hair, the striking features, the perfect body hidden under impeccable clothing — even now, Harry can’t get enough of the sight. “What are you watching?”
No, I didn’t kill Snape. Riddle did. He cornered him in the Shrieking Shack on the night of the final battle, ordering his snake to kill him in an attempt to become Master of the Elder Wand. Good thing he never figured out you’d already won its loyalty from Dumbledore before Snape got to the Astronomy Tower that night — if he’d known, he wouldn’t have hesitated to go after you too.
“So, if you don’t work here often, what else do you do?”
Draco glanced up at the man standing over by the window. He looked unkempt — an unshaven jaw, dark curly hair without a trace of product, strange clothes unlike anything Draco’d ever seen before — but he had a kind warm smile, and when he gestured towards the bed with a polite, “May I?” Draco could only nod.
TW: Incessant typos due to excessive alcohol intake (Harry, not me)
“And you did that on purpose, you absolute tosser.”
“Ciao, bella.”
You know what? Once you’re out of that place, how about meeting up for a seekers’ game sometime, just you and me and the snitch? For old time’s sake? I’d even let you win if you wanted me to. Anything to get to race you again. I still haven’t flown against anyone who’s been able to push me to my limits the way you always used to do. (And I had the opportunity to play several seekers’ games against Krum over the summer.)
“I thought I’d never see you with a Weasley.”
“Can’t believe you’re here,” Harry said at one time, pushing Draco up against the wall, wanting to melt into the man he’d been yearning for for so long.
He’d already known their next meeting was going to be a challenge, that if he wasn’t careful, he’d risk an emotional backlash the moment he set eyes on Draco again. He couldn’t allow for it to happen, not after all they’ve been through. Their friendship was too important for Harry to ruin it with his stupid feelings.
Draco looked like he was about to leave, and Harry scrambled for something to say, anything that might make him remain in the office just a few moments longer. What had they been talking about again? Ah, yes…
Zabini gave him a toothy grin and disappeared in the sudden flurry of robes, gloves, scarves, and hats being summoned from various dorms upstairs. Harry shoved his belongings into his bag and ducked out of the way of various flying garments as he headed for his room. Since he’d left his wand on the nightstand this morning, he had no choice but to pick up his outerwear the Muggle way.
“I know.” He sat down in the seat across from her, incredibly proud. It was a big moment for her and the Foundation.
Harry nodded and stepped back down off the porch and into the night, heading back towards the offices. “Be careful. It’s icy,” he muttered to Draco and waited on him to follow. Draco did, breathing through the dull ache the memories had brought on, ready to put them back into the far corner of his mind where they belonged. As they began to walk, though, Harry picked the conversation back up. “I suppose you can go now that you have Charlie, then.” His voice sounded strained. “To Florence, that is.”
He entered the kitchen, but the room was silent, Molly evidently having gone back upstairs. He jotted down a quick letter of thanks to her and promised to see her later at St Mungo’s, then walked to the small sitting room with the Floo. He reached for the Floo powder, but the discreet sound of a throat clearing behind him made him freeze.
“Oh, for… Just tell me, Draco. It’s not like he knocked you up or anything?”
A young woman in blue Mediwitch robes approached him, frowning as she hunched down in front of him. “Malfoy? Are you okay? Do you need help too?”
Draco tightened his hold on the coin, making a decision right then and there. Why wait? Surely he could start changing things for the better already tomorrow if he wanted to. Harry had said they were the same age, and that meant Harry would be on the train tomorrow. And he might have said they wouldn’t be friends at first, but the future wasn’t set in stone, was it? No. Draco would set things straight right away. He’d seek Harry out already on the train tomorrow, making sure not to waste a single day of friendship with the legendary Boy Who Lived.
Just fine, indeed.
“Oh, kiddo. You really do remind me of Cissa sometimes,” Sirius said quietly. “Once you’ve made your mind up about something, there’s no leeway for any other option, is there?” Draco looked up at the man who shared his eyes, the last of his mother’s family. The last of his own.
I can’t say I’ve received all that many birthday presents in my life, but Merlin, Malfoy. You wrote me a song? And maybe I should wait until I’ve heard it played before I say anything, because I know there’s a chance you’re just messing with me and the song will turn out to be a right torture to listen to, but for some reason, I get the feeling that’s not the case. I’ve contemplated asking Fleur to play it for me, but for some reason, I don’t want my first time hearing it to be in a house full of curious Weasleys who’ll want to know what it is and where I got it from. But I have a plan. I’ll be staying with Andromeda and Teddy next weekend, and I know she has a piano in her living room. I don’t know if she plays herself or if the piano was her husband’s or daughter’s, but if she does, I’m going to ask her to play it for me when I’m there. Godric, I still can’t believe you did that. That’s probably the most personal gift I’ve ever gotten. Thank you.
Malfoy bumps his shoulder with a smirk and Harry swallows, averting his gaze.
PS Dragon Dust? I’ve never listened to them before but apparently, Hannah’s a big fan and when I asked her about it, she lent me that third album you mentioned. It’s quite all right, I guess, but if you hadn’t told me, I never would’ve guessed you were into them. Now that I know, though, I figure it makes sense; the moody melancholy in some of those songs is bloody brutal. Based on them, I bet you’d love muggle artists like Tracy Chapman, Sade, and maybe Alanis Morissette.
“Yeah. You’re the one who helped me face my fears. You’re the one who cheered me up and calmed me down.” Draco swallowed around the sore lump forming in his throat. “What you said that night helped me keep the faith through the darkest times of my life, Harry. I don’t know that I would’ve survived the war without you.”
“…and that’s basically it,” Draco says as they approach Harry’s front door. “Because I hope to Merlin I won’t have to teach you about the birds and the bees too.”
“Fuck,” Draco said as he came up for air, sounding dazed and awed and husky beyond measure. “Fuck,” he said again as he pushed a long, slender finger into Harry’s panting hole. “Fuck, Harry,” he breathed as he started fucking Harry with it, slowly, thoroughly. “Do you have any idea how sexy you are like this? Giving yourself to me so willingly, so eagerly? So open and pliant and utterly delectable.”
Draco isn’t far behind, grunting out his orgasm just as Harry’s tense muscles begin to relax, post-coital bliss overtaking him and rendering him a boneless puddle of goo in Draco’s arms.
Hermione says the sight of me apparently brings people hope. Now don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I don’t want people to feel hopeful — I really do — but do they really need an eyeful of me to be able to do that? If so, that might be the most depressing thing I’ve ever heard.
“Really?” Harry sounded surprised but then quickly tried to cover it. “I mean, thank you. Can you meet me at the Wheezes at seven?”
Draco raised an eyebrow and chuckled. “Now that’s an idea. Maybe you could have brought down old Voldie with a calculator and a spreadsheet?”
And by the way, thanks ever so for the very
“Yeah. It was.”
“I’m actually quite good at the guessing, but I always feel silly being the one to act them out.” He let out a long yawn, the food making him drowsy.
“Merlin, Harry, you’ll be the death of me.”
“Suit yourself.” You grin, downing the shot and placing the glass next to your already empty one on the bar.
When they ended the call a few moments later, Draco still had no clue how he was supposed to help out studying for the exam. Surely, this not-knowing must be the cause of the flutter of anticipation suddenly itching under his skin.
He shrugged uncomfortably. “Well, I need to maintain my image, don’t I?” He pulled Ernie’s paperwork from the folder on his lap and handed it to her. “I promised Macmillan I’d bring this over. He said it was urgent?”
And he was. Together, they soared; like two Seekers towards the sky; side by side, reaching for the Snitch; for once working in unison to catch the golden prize in their joined hands.
“Oh, Draco.” The man frowned and reached out to place a hand on Draco’s foot over the covers, squeezing it gently. “Never think for a minute that your parents don’t love you. They do. You mean the world to them and I know it.”
And I can’t help it, I burst into a laugh that has me doubled over in tears within moments. “Y-you’re insane,” I wheeze as soon as I’m able to breathe again. “You’re insane and adorable and…” I straighten up and look at him across the table. “I love you so much.”
Saturday 26 June 1999
"Please," Harry adds, quiet enough for only his mate to hear.
Orion hisses from his place in the front pouch of Harry's hooded jumper.
Harry rolled his eyes. “As much as Ron likes to think he understands Parseltongue, you shouldn’t believe everything your boyfriend tells you. And Orion is just teasing me, just like the rest of you. And although I have no clue what I’m saying in my sleep, you’d think it’d be okay seeing as how I’m actually
Draco turned to Harry who was watching him with something akin to sadness in his eyes. “Hey, cheer up, Potter!” he said with a grin as he bumped Harry’s shoulder with his own. “It’s a party. Come on, let’s mingle.”
No, hateful avengers and avid fans might not be the same thing, not by a long shot, but even so… Had Harry really experienced the same yearning for anonymity as Draco had? The same need to escape the world they once used to be such an important part of? He was here, after all, living among the Muggles the same way Draco did… Maybe Draco wasn’t the only wizard who had migrated into the non-magical world in search of a new start? Maybe they had more in common than he’d first thought.
“Oh, I—” She reluctantly tore her eyes away from her date, her freckled skin turning pink as the wallet slipped from her restless fingers and fell onto the countertop. “I’m sorry, I—”
When they finally entered Charlie’s hospital room together, most of the family was already gathered. Percy and his wife were missing, as were George and Angelina, and none of the children were there, either, but the others huddled around the bed talking, with Molly sitting and holding Charlie’s now healed hand.
"Is Kingsley still bugging you too? Or just Hermione?" Draco asked casually as if Harry would give him a different answer than he had every other time they'd talked about it.
She burst out laughing. “Exactly. It’s just like your sixth year all over again.”
They each placed their orders, but as they waited for their drinks, the silence grew heavier and both seemed equally reluctant to break it. Stepping back outside, Draco took a fortifying sip of his tea before saying what was on his mind.
She patted his cheek and turned, then took Draco’s arm and led him out of the room.
— again, and of his unexpected acceptance. “Right. Yes, it is.”
“Blond,” came Sirius’s voice from Draco’s left, but it was quiet, and he wasn’t sure who all could hear it. “Harry likes blonds.”
When Draco sneaked a peek towards the corner table in the back, the bloke was glancing down at his phone, an amused smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. Feigning nonchalance, Draco left him to it and lay down his phone on the counter to do what he’d been wanting to do for hours now. He reached back to tug the elastic out of his hair, shaking out the long blond tresses before gathering them into a new, improved bun at the nape of his neck.
“No!” Harry winced. “No, of course not. And I didn’t think… But then George said—”
And speaking of the people surrounding me, I get why the photo I sent made you assume I’ve told them about
When he blinked his eyes open, Hannah was gone, but a glass of water sat on the table next to him. He must have drifted off. He sat up against his pillows and reached for the glass, taking a long drink of water as he tried to put his thoughts in order.
Dubious Malfoy,
“Darling, I’m having a dinner party tomorrow night with a group of friends, and you simply
Ernie chuckled. “Nice. Lucky man. What I wouldn’t give for a weekend away for debauchery.”
“Yes.” It was time. Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco beat him to it. “Here. Why don’t you have a look at it?”
“Harry,” Draco says softly, cupping Harry’s face with both hands and lifting his head, forcing Harry to look him straight in the eye. “I’ve wanted you for years.”
After New Year’s.
“Tomsy is to take young sir Edward to meet Master Santa Claus,” said the male elf who’d just returned a beaming son to Mrs Finch-Fletchley. Without further ado, the elf then turned on his heel, clearly expecting Teddy to follow him as he strode over the podium as fast as his short legs could carry him.
“…your hero is gone…” “…the battle is won…” “…kneel before me…” The Dark Lord’s voice continued unperturbed. As if the world hadn’t just ended. As if all hope wasn’t suddenly lost.
So instead, he scowled. “But seriously, no socks? In December? We’re going to northern Scotland, you dunce. You’ll freeze.”
Draco smiled and pointed to the northern sky. “Over there. Do you see Ursa Minor? It sort of does a little hump over the Little Dipper and scoops up towards Vega.”
Arriving on Charlie’s floor, Draco slowed his steps, reluctant to approach the room. Hannah found him at the end of the hallway.
Sometimes I wish we weren’t limited to these letters, though. I mean, writing is nice and all, but sometimes I feel like I can’t read you as well as I’d want to. Like in your latest letter, where you first promise me you won’t ridicule my friends anymore, just to go on calling Ron a joke a few paragraphs later? What the hell am I supposed to do with that?
He picked up the bowl and started wandering the rest of the cottage. He passed a filthy bathroom with a toilet that looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages. He couldn’t resist hitting it with a quick Scourgify as he continued on to the bedroom.
Most people, you included, probably wonder why I even agree to come out with you every weekend. I don’t drink; I don’t dance; I don’t even flirt with the handsome men brave enough to approach me. That first time, it had been for moral support. You had talked about it all week, the excitement evident in your voice, in your gestures, the thrill and anticipation of finally getting out there, pursuing your true self. Behind it, though, I noticed the nervousness in your eyes, a stormy swirl of insecurity that made my heart ache. So I decided to come with you, to show that even if your father doesn’t approve of you being who you are, other people do.
“But you’re not him. Listen, I’m speaking from the wisdom of age here. Do not project your own fears and insecurities onto other people. You are not them. Worry about yourself and wait to see what they’ll do. In my experience, people will surprise you more often than not.”
“Come on.” She cut him off without even glancing his way, already starting up the latte-making process. “I haven’t seen you off your feet since I arrived this morning. Just take a break, will you?”
“Honestly,” Draco said slowly, still feeling a bit off-kilter by Harry’s admission, “I didn’t think I’d see you either. None of you, I mean. Any magic folk. Or, at least I hoped I wouldn’t.”
Harry had a wistful smile on his face, and Draco’s eyes burned at the realisation that Harry had no memories like that, nothing to hold on to. “It sounds wonderful,” Harry said quietly. “Do you still go?”
Draco paused and glared at Harry. “Well, perhaps he doesn’t mind when he’s visiting
Thank Merlin you’re ‘still intact and fully functioning’. I don’t know what I’d do if you weren’t. So, I take it we’re talking about ugly scars? If so, welcome to the club. I have more scars than I can count and believe me, the one on my forehead is not the ugliest one. So, if you think no one will ever want to look at you naked, the same goes for me too. Honestly, though, if someone loves you, they won’t care about the scars. They’re just superficial marks on your skin and they shouldn’t define you. And at least you’ve got a well-toned body going, don’t you, Adonis?
“Um,” Harry hesitated, the silence just long enough for Draco to assume the worst. Once he continued, he sounded confused. “Er, no. They’re fine; mum and baby both. It’s just, Ron didn’t want to leave them, and—”
- Harry
“Can you come back in a bit? I’d like to talk to you about something important.” Draco’s stomach knotted, but Charlie smiled, a little dimple poking through on his freckled cheek. “It’s good, though. Promise.”
Draco sat quietly.
He cleared his throat. “Right, well, this isn’t a bowl; it’s a sculpture. I saw it last night, actually. I’m surprised it’s here already.”
It was all so perfect. The food was delicious, the evening comfortable, and the rhythmic sound of the waves lulled them both into a sense of utter calm.
Harry’s chest heaves with his shallow breaths, his heart pounding furiously as he struggles to understand. Has Draco been hiding these feelings all along? Just like Harry? No, surely that’s impossi—
Draco waggled his old-man eyebrows and Harry smiled, feeling some of the pent-up tension subside. He was still unable to grasp quite what was happening between them, but if this was real, if they were actually on the brink of what he thought they were, Harry wanted to savour it.
“Nah, it’s okay,” Harry shrugged.
fireworks,
” he muttered, then repeated it several times until they were returned to their original colour.
Making up his mind, he closed the window and grabbed his cloak from the peg on the wall, gave the roaring fireplace a longing look — he was momentarily grateful that protection spells made the fire safe to leave so the office would stay warm and dry for when he returned — then ventured out into the dreadful Christmas afternoon weather.
Harry’s eyes widened. “No, I— I didn’t mean… Just recognising the desire to be left alone, is all. You know, getting overrun by fans and reporters all the time wasn’t all that amazing either.”
She nodded then opened her brown eyes, meeting his gaze and cocking her head to the side. She seemed to be considering him.
Yes, you dimwit, I have indeed released you from the secret quill-pal closet. And apart from Ron, who I already knew would be a challenge and a half, I’d like to think they’ve all had time to process it by now. To be honest, though, I can’t say for sure. Thing is, Draco, we’ve all been so busy these past few weeks, what with studies and work and everything else, that I’ve barely seen anyone but my fellow auror trainees since that day when everyone found out, not even Ron and Hermione.
Draco hadn’t seen such gorgeous glassware in his life. Ever. Shelf after shelf of useful, everyday items like bowls, goblets, platters, and vases nearly took his breath away with their unique shapes and vibrant, eye-catching colours. What really drew Draco’s attention, though, was the sculpture.
Draco holds up his hand and Harry watches in silence as the glow of Draco’s skin dims into nothing and his wings slowly fade away to disappear as if covered by a glamour. Within a minute, Draco looks normal again — as normal as a stunningly gorgeous man can ever look — stepping into his shoes and covering the bare skin of his torso with a light blue, knitted jumper.
“And you told me yourself that you don’t care about body type,” George added. “Wasn’t your last boyfriend kind of slim and willowy?”
“Draco? You’re a-a Veela?” Draco nods silently, looking defeated. “How could I not know you...? No, please, don’t apologise. Just tell me what’s going on.”
He wasn’t sure what he had expected when he arrived on the fourth level of the Ministry of Magic and approached the Office of Civil Affairs where the ceremony would take place, but a room full of people was not it.
I can’t hear what you’re all talking about, your voices drowned out by the too-loud music, but if Ginny’s delighted grin is anything to go by, it’s old anecdotes from school, saucy gossip from the Slytherin dorms that I can only hope she’ll want to tell me all about later. She looks between the rest of you in rapt attention, soaking up every word you’re saying, hungry to learn as much as possible about her boyfriend’s childhood escapades.
“No, he doesn’t,” Harry asserted. “He hates being so far away from his dragons.”
A commotion outside the doorway had Draco jumping up and moving into the corner, sure he’d be reprimanded for being in Charlie’s private room. Nobody paid him any attention, however, as the room filled with ginger-haired family, quickly going from small to cramped as the newcomers took up more space than seemingly possible. As he watched them enter, Draco realised he was somewhat familiar with most of them already, either through school or their work during and after the war. A disconcerting thought, especially as they all most likely had preconceived notions about him from the past. He may have made peace with his old Gryffindor rivals during that eighth year they all attended at Hogwarts, but that didn’t mean they’d parted as friends or that they’d passed on his apologies to their relatives.
And he did. Draco undressed him with the utmost care, covering every bared inch of skin with gentle caresses and soft kisses. He took his time to explore every dip and curve of him, all the while showering him with praise that made Harry blush like a shy teenager. Draco rolled him over and brushed his fingertips over Harry’s shoulders, his back, his hips, his thighs, his calves. His barely-there touches were maddening, just enough to set Harry’s entire body tingling and yet not nearly enough to satiate him. By the time Draco’s hands finally reached Harry’s arse, Harry was keening with pent-up desire, eagerly pushing up against Draco’s palms, practically mewling when Draco took pity on him and dug his fingers into Harry’s flesh.
“Teddy!”
"Now I have to figure out a way to top this in July." He stops and wiggles his eyebrows.
“Oh, pish-posh,” she said, a slight tinge of rose spreading over her cheeks. “I did most of it, yes, but I love it. There’s nothing better than watching people eat the food you made them.”
"No Weasleys…" Draco said, no doubt thinking about the times he'd tried to slip into Harry's room at the Burrow so they could have some privacy. They had not been successful.
“Indian,” Draco said immediately, remembering the disgusting takeout containers.
There’d been a reason he’d opted for the peace and quiet of upstairs today. His Charms revision required his undivided attention, something a crowded common room would never be able to provide, but with a roommate like Potter, he should have known better. He should have gone to the library.
You swallow, distress furrowing your brow. Your silky blond locks are in complete disarray, as if you’ve pushed your hands through them countless times, as if you’ve repeatedly clenched your fists in them in an attempt to ground yourself. They fall in your face, veiling stormy-grey eyes glistening with unshed tears.
He lets out a shout and Draco's hand is suddenly tight in Harry's hair, making it even better — a surprise to consider later, for sure. He comes hard, his body overcome with ripples of pleasure. Draco pulls out from Harry's mouth and kneels down before him, pulling him close, kissing and tasting his own residue. He runs a feather over Harry's cock, the gentlest of touches, and then Harry's coming again, a second, completely unexpected wave that takes his breath away.
“Mum, don’t smother him. He’s injured,” Bill admonished, putting his arm around Fleur. Memories of reading about their marriage in
Draco’s heart skipped a beat.
“Like…” Draco gulped. Was he really implying…? “What do you have in mind?”
“Welcome back to earth, Harry.” Luna’s eyes twinkle in amusement. “Had a good time?”
“I did,” Draco said with a sigh. “I just wish I’d gotten there faster.”
“Well, I mean, not in the last couple of years or anything, obviously, or I would’ve known about you. We’re just friends now, I promise,” he added, all but stumbling over the words in his haste.
“When did you start blowing glass, then?”
” Draco heard Wood asking once he got into the hallway, making him pause.
When those pleading crystal blue eyes zoned in on Draco and he finally realised who Charlie was talking about, he tried his best not to roll his eyes. “The dragon is fine, Charlie. She’s not hurt. And because you’re okay, the Reserve won’t be forced to put her down.”
“No, I’m not a… If anything, I was stupid. I had no idea what I was doing and could have easily gotten us both killed if I’d made her even angrier.”
Received: Just a tad. It's my b-day, after all
Yes, my relatives did indeed hate me, and it wasn’t until my eleventh birthday that I found out why. Before then, I was just a mistreated and malnourished, unwanted nephew, a burden that had been imposed on them after my parents died in a ‘car crash’ the night I turned 15 months old. They used to imply that my parents, specifically my dad, were abominable freaks, and they never missed a chance to remind me I most likely was one too. They thought they could suppress it, that they could make my abnormalities go away if they only prohibited me from expressing them. Unfortunately for me, though, that was not the case.
I curse to myself and take a long swallow from my forgotten bottle of ale, decidedly tearing my eyes away from you and your striking beauty. As I do, the music returns to my awareness —
godfather, though, he’d better remember that. He was Harry’s. And kind of Charlie’s. His allegiance laid elsewhere, evidently.
Glancing at his watch, Draco held out his hand. “Give them to me. I should have time.”
“You’re going to make some bad decisions along the way — and so will I — but when the time comes, when it matters the most, you will make the right one; the one that changes everything.”
PPS Nope, no bruising facepalms yet. Anything you’d like to tell me, Dray?
Draco rolls his eyes. “You know this means I’m your mate too, you idiot.”
“You’re bonkers.”
“So, where should someone take
“Good point.”
As if.
They dipped up and down over the waves, laughing hysterically when a wave crested early and sprayed them both. They landed in a small inlet sheltered by the rocks and took in the tranquillity of the evening, wrapping it around them.
Harry considered. He did like the way Malfoy looked these days, so much better than that day at his trial. His hair practically glowed with health now, and his skin looked so soft, so smooth that Harry itched to reach out and touch it, just to find out if it felt as perfect as it looked. And the one or two times they’d bumped into each other in the hallway between classes, Malfoy had smelled of caramel and oranges and tea; a most intriguing smell.
Draco froze. “
Draco had grown so accustomed to Muggle attire over the years that he seldom spared it a second thought anymore, but seeing Harry now, looking exactly like he did that first time Draco met him, he was suddenly reminded of how weird he’d found Harry’s clothes that night. How foreign and confusing.
“That’s it.” Harry slumps down in his chair and hides his face in his hands. “I officially suck at dating.”
Also, Harry admitted to himself as he watched Draco greet his unsuspecting cousin, he wouldn’t have minded one last chance of being close to Draco before he left for France.
“Teddy! Mealtime.”
“When did…? How…?” Teddy stilled, confusion transforming into awe. “Santa brought you, didn’t he?”
Harry’s voice sounded tight. “Wait, what?”
Merlin, he loved his job sometimes. A compliment to this witch on her taste in jewellery, and didn’t she see this amazing piece up for auction that just screamed her name? It’s one of a kind and is sure to be one of the more popular pieces tonight. And then a challenge to this wizard over here, covertly suggesting true artistic taste could see value in up-and-coming-artists aeons before their names were renowned. Draco watched that man add bids to three different paintings not long after their brief conversation.
“True.” Harry tears his gaze from the stunning view of London to take in Malfoy’s equally stunning profile. “So, what to avoid then? Any examples?”
Ron and Hermione have found a little cottage in Ottery St Catchpole that they’ll get access to on 28th August. It’s not all that far from here, just a twenty minutes’ walk or so, and it looks really nice, with a well-kept front garden and plenty of space for all the bookshelves Hermione will undoubtedly need. It’s a three-bedroom place, and they’ve already offered me to crash in one of their spares, but since they’re in their lovey-dovey phase, I think I better not. They may be my best friends, and I am happy for them, but there’s still a limit to the amount of mush one’s capable of witnessing without feeling like the fifth wheel in their company.
“And you’re cute.” Harry waggled his eyebrows, making Draco shake his head in fond exasperation. “Any of those for me?”
"Harry," Draco gasped, moving to kneel above him, his wings keeping him afloat as his hands roamed over sun-kissed skin, his feather-light touches making Harry's heart sing. "Tell me what you want. Anything. I want to make you feel so good."
“What? Are you insane?”
“Of course,” Draco said, deciding not to mention the preparations Pansy had made him juggle for weeks. For some reason, the dragons seemed to love the fireworks, and magical inhabitants from across the Hebridean islands gathered there on New Year’s to celebrate. It was the only time all year the reserve was fully open to visitors.
Hermione, sitting next to him, must have been watching because she leaned over and nudged him. “Put it on. Everyone else is.”
“You…?” Draco gaped.
Draco considered. “Probably not. I mean, he’s trained and all, but he’s—”
Draco chuckles. “He’s not wrong, you know. It
“Fine,” Draco said, veiling his thrumming anticipation with a challenging quirk of his eyebrow. “Show me.”
Harry, who didn’t seem to have any limitations when it came to sugar, closed his lips around another spoonful of the sweet dessert and moaned as he savoured it with half-lidded eyes. Draco felt his blood rush south at the mere sight of him, imagining that same blissed-out face, that same sinful sound in a whole other setting. A setting that involved a bed, tangled sheets, sweat-glistening skin, and much fewer clothes. The thought was so distracting, he nearly missed Harry’s next words as they fell out of his mouth, sounding more casual and innocent than they ever had a right to, considering the revelation they carried.
“Charlie Weasley, right? It’s his stuff.”
Blood boiling, it took all Draco had to tamper his instinctual urge to lunge at the man. The fury must have shown on his face, though, because Potter had the good sense to lift his chin, alarm written all over his face.
“I’m sorry, I—” Draco blurted, mortified. “It’s not what you think. I can explain, if you’d just let me—”
“I’m sorry I’ve been away so much lately. I’ll make it up to you after this whole mess is cleared up, I promise. Now, what’s it to be tonight? Animal bloopers or nature videos?”
His eye caught on Charlie Weasley’s little hut and the two rocking chairs on the small, covered porch that welcomed friendly visitors. Not that Draco had ever been invited to use them. For all of his pining for the man, Charlie barely knew Draco existed. He’d smile at him when they crossed paths, and Draco was sure the other man knew he was a Malfoy — it’d be hard not to — but it was always the same. A friendly smile and a nod on Charlie’s end, and an evening of ginger-flavoured dreams awaiting Draco once he got home to his flat.
So, of course, Draco would have something to say about it.
It’ll probably be enough. Probably. But…
“Holy fuck,” he breathed, only now taking in the full reality of it all. Draco was here — his Draco, the man he’d been in love with for so long. He was standing only inches away with his flushed cheeks and his shallow breaths, about to enter Harry’s bedroom, about to… “
As soon as the boy was out of sight, Harry went for the closest chair, unsure of how much longer his knees would be able to support him. He wasn’t ready for this. Nowhere near ready. He was only halfway through his two-week Draco detox, and after spending the entire day surrounded by happy couples, his heart felt even more fragile than it usually did.
“Come in!”
Draco’s blood chilled, but Sirius stood and slapped Draco cheerfully on the back as though he’d not delivered an implied threat just seconds before. “Come on. They’re waiting for us at the Burrow.”
The door swung open, and there he was, a dark blue apron secured over his front and a bright, toothy smile adorning his face.
Draco couldn’t help chuckling at the man’s antics as he turned to the espresso machine and started in on his over-specific coffee order. Just like that, his good mood was back, an excitement that only increased when he felt his phone vibrate in his trouser pocket. There was no time to check it right then, but he didn’t have to. He had a feeling he already knew who the text was from.
“Good morning,” Harry murmured and watched Draco’s mouth curve into a content smile. He really, really didn’t want to leave the bed, but… “I have to—”
Harry cringed. “I’m sorry. That’s a common side effect of being seen together with me. Are you sure you’re up for that?”
Draco looked at the clock. That gave him a little over an hour to finish the muffins he was making and get cleaned up. It would be tight, but he could manage. “That should be fine.”
“A double tall extra hot latte macchiato with whip.”
“Do you?”
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco interrupted, instantly worried about his new friend. “Is she okay? And the baby? Do they need anything?”
Bellatrix’s cackle broke through the clatter of books raining down from what used to be a bookshelf a few yards away.
“Really? It felt like much less.”
“Hmm? Oh, I just… Um. I baked them a fruitcake.”
“All in a day’s work,” she said, her voice teasing.
“Thank you,” she said, grabbing the cups and making a move to finally let Draco breathe. He was just about to force his shoulders to relax when she stopped in her tracks and turned back to face him, the clear challenge in her gaze making Draco’s pulse race. She bit her lip, considering, then leaned in. “Just do it, okay? We have this really important anatomy exam next week, and if James flunks it, it’ll all be your fault. He hasn’t been able to concentrate for weeks, thanks to your pretty face.”
Harry wasn’t exactly sure what it was that he needed, except
“I guess I’ll have to take your word for it then.” Draco could see Molly still wasn’t completely convinced about the brilliance of apple-cheese combining, but he was quite sure Arthur would eventually talk her into making it for him to try.
when the chime of an incoming Floo call stopped him. Harry looked relieved by the interruption. “I’ll get that.”
Then, as he’d lain in bed in the dead of night, flashes of emerald eyes, bronze skin, and raven-black hair preventing him from falling asleep, he’d finally succumbed to the dark and let himself fantasise about the impossible — about those five words actually being true.
Draco reluctantly let go of Harry’s cock and kissed his way up Harry’s happy trail, pausing at the navel, dipping his tongue inside before continuing, up across smooth bronze skin, following the hills and valleys of his well-defined muscles until he reached a pebbled, cocoa-coloured nipple too tempting to ignore. The involuntary noises coming from Harry’s mouth provided the perfect soundtrack as Draco flicked it teasingly with the tip of his tongue while simultaneously circling the other with the pad of his thumb.
“Perfect. I’ll be with you in a moment.” Harry winked —
Draco’s strong hands slide under the waistband of Harry’s joggers and boxer briefs, making Harry gasp as they grip his arse cheeks firmly and pulls him even closer. Draco’s palms are hot against Harry’s skin and the fingers dig into the flesh hard enough to bruise. Harry doesn’t mind. On the contrary, the thought of Draco marking him like this — claiming him — is hot. So fucking hot.
“Oh, come on. When did you ever need me —
“No, you absolute tosser, I do.” Draco huffs amused, smacking Harry’s arse cheek without malice. “Why would I even consider it otherwise?”
Her eyes widened. “You saved him?” She began running a diagnostic spell over Draco, then tutted. “You’re singed, and there’s a small burn on your arm. I can’t believe you dragged him away from dragonfire!”
“I just…” Harry swallowed. “I just don’t want Teddy to walk in on his number one idol defiling me on the kitchen table.”
Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth, and Harry swallowed it greedily, lapping up every trace of the glorious sound as if he were a parched man who’d been wandering the desert for ages. Harry sank his fingers into the soft, silky locks of Draco’s longer-than-usual hair, grabbing it in his fists and rejoicing in Draco’s answering groan. Draco’s hands, hot and large and eager, moved along the waistband of Harry’s trousers, one of them trailing off to follow the curves of Harry’s spine as the other settled on the small of his back. The press of his palms brought them closer together, reminding Harry of Draco’s current state as he felt the man’s protruding stomach against his abs.
Harry tasted of wine and treacle tart, heady and sweet and utterly divine. Draco simply couldn’t get enough. He’d intended for their first kiss to be slow and tender, soft and promising. He should have known better. This was Harry, for Circe’s sake, Harry fucking Potter; nothing between them had ever been short of explosive.
“Draco,” Harry murmured. “Can we talk?”
Draco thought fast. “Two months ago.”
PS I do hope you’ll change your mind about showing me your drawings one day. The way you describe them, I bet they’re nothing short of breathtaking.
I hadn’t planned to, it just came out. Like, we were just getting ready to leave when someone, I don’t even remember who, declared they had a few phials of Sober-Up on offer. I naturally jumped at the chance, thinking I wouldn’t want to upset you with another hungover mess of a letter in the morning. (Yes, go figure. The reckless Gryffindor is
“I don’t want you to be unhappy.”
He’d been contemplating it for ages, envisioning different scenarios, discarding them one after the other and growing more frustrated with every passing day. When the idea struck him now, though, there was no hesitation. He knew it was right — perfect even — and so he reached for two cups and drew his wand, surreptitiously spelling a message on the inside of one of them in white, water-proof ink.
had loved staying at Hogwarts for months on end without seeing their parents, without coming home. And now they just expected him to feel the same?
“Okay,” Teddy agrees, already on his feet, running downhill.
Harry popped a piece of bacon in his mouth and shrugged. “Doing what? I just want to make sure everyone is treating each other the right way.”
“So, Mr Claus, are you ready to face the crowd?”
Draco turned and rolled his eyes at her. He knew she hated when he did that. “Read the invitation, Pans. Charlie Weasley.”
Nerves pulled taut, he almost flinched at the creak of a floorboard on the landing above, the sound soon followed by familiar footsteps coming down the stairs. Draco took a deep breath and pressed a hand to his knee, willing it to stop bouncing. Merlin, he hadn’t been this jittery in years.
As they start for the stairs, Harry is struck by a sudden thought, an idea that makes him ridiculously excited in multiple ways.
Received: Are you on your way yet?
“Oh, and how did you know about the, uh, Prince Albert?”
, Draco chided himself,
“You should’ve been here, grandma. Santa came, and—”
Harry grunted and shifted his box. “You and everyone else. But family is important to me, and, well, it was right after we finally finished school, and George was barely functioning at the time. I mean, with Fred gone and, well… Anyway, I figured I’d have time later, to join the Aurors or get a Defense Mastery, if that was what I wanted.” He fell silent and Draco glanced over at him, biting his tongue to stay quiet in hope that Harry would continue. He did. “Well, eventually I realised I didn’t really want all that other stuff. I liked the peace and quiet. I get to help the family, and I travel from time to time for the business, so I’ve been able to see the world.”
Harry lifted the edge of the duvet, helping Draco get settled and tucking him in the way Mother hadn’t done since he was five. It was nice, having someone care for him this way. Harry stroked his hand over Draco’s head, brushing a stray lock of hair out of his face. Draco felt soft lips placing a gentle kiss on his forehead, and he relaxed, sinking into the safety that was Harry’s nearness. When Harry spoke again, Draco was already half asleep.
“He won’t,” Draco mumbled, nuzzling the soft spot behind Harry’s ear, making Harry whimper.
And Harry does, thinking trousers that snug really shouldn’t be allowed in a public place like this.
They remained silent on their trip back to the Security Shed, but at least the rain had stopped now and the clouds were starting to clear, opening the sky to the millions of stars above. Draco took a deep breath, letting the clean, crisp air fill his lungs.
Draco simply couldn’t take his eyes off it.
“And don’t worry about dinner. I’ll make us something.”
Sent: What bar?
- Harry
"I want to try something different," Draco says after a minute, a rivulet of sweat sliding down the bridge of his nose. "Can I?"
Draco scanned the room. From what he could discern, he assumed the only people who hadn’t been at the hospital were spouses and children. “Uh, not everyone. Only the ones from the other day. Oh, and Joh— Angelina, right? She’s married to George now, isn’t she?”
He looked back up at the sky and let out a long breath, the visible exhale floating up and away into the cool night air. “The song you were humming. It was my mother’s favourite. You know, Sirius’s cousin.” Harry turned to look at Draco, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to meet his eyes. Instead, he kept watching the stars, letting their familiarity bring him comfort as he continued. “My mother used to sing it to me all the time. ‘I wish I had a river so long, I would teach my feet to fly. I wish I had a river I could skate away on.’ I haven’t heard it in a long time.”
— lets their lips touch for the very first time.
“Of course,” I say, smiling, bumping your shoulder just for something to do to ease the pressure on my yearning heart.
A minute later, he was wiping crumbs and coffee stains off the countertop when his phone buzzed again.
Now, knowing what he did have to tell me, I almost wish he’d rather gone with any of your stupid suggestions. (But when did any of my wishes ever come true?) No, apparently he’s realised he doesn’t want to become an auror anymore. Apparently, he and George talked a lot over the hols and now Ron has decided to join his brother in the joke shop instead.
“She doesn’t have to find out,” he drawls, cocking a challenging eyebrow. “After all, you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t—”
enthusiastic fans? Did you know I can’t even walk the halls of Hogwarts unaccompanied by several friends without being attacked by reverent pre-teens at every turn? Seriously, Malfoy, I swear, most of the time, I feel like a fucking prey.
Draco chuckled and nodded, trying not to think too much about the sensation of Harry’s light stubble against his cheek as he did. Harry’s hands moved slightly over Draco’s back, and then it all changed.
“But that was all a mistake! You can’t marry Charlie.” Her tone was matter-of-fact and it just pissed him off.
“Bella, please, don’t… You’re going to…”
Fleur leaned back on her hands. “That’s normal. There are a lot of people in this world. The odds of hitting upon the one person meant for you on the first try are pretty high, yes?”
“I bet they’ll miss you tremendously,” the man said, green eyes sparkling behind sleek, gold-rimmed glasses. “They just won’t let it show. They don't want you thinking about them when you should be focusing on all the good stuff that’s waiting for you at Hogwarts.”
Harry turned towards the sound, squinting in the sun at the man coming towards them from Hagrid’s hut.
“Charlie, I need to talk to you about something.”
He can't see it in the dim room, but Harry's pretty sure Draco rolls his eyes. "We really need to get him a girlfriend," he grumbles before grabbing his wand and casting a Heating Charm on a pillow before throwing it into the corner.
Potter — the younger version; the one who’d never cared two Knuts about Draco — had just pulled him out of a rampant Fiendfyre, saving his life without rhyme or reason, only to…
. Draco had anticipated this inquiry, of course, and he already had the answer prepared at the tips of his thumbs. “All right, here goes nothing…”
“Fine. I’m not really impressed either.” Draco rolled over and his stiff body screamed in protest. “I am, however, fucking sore. Merlin, who knew saving somebody would be such a hassle?”
Harry’s voice, soft and tentative, cut through the rush of blood in Draco’s ears. “You like it?”
,” I correct him with a scowl.
Orion yawns.
Sent: Oh Salazar! Not a Gryffindor. How did you get my number?
“No,” Teddy groaned, stomping his foot. “No one’s ‘dressed as Santa’. It’s
Received: Oh, you're no fun
Harry’s voice was very quiet. “Was she bothering you?”
“And you really like these people, don’t you?”
. Tonight. From France.” He turned to lie on his side, propping his head on his elbow. “If it weren’t for Andromeda…”
“In front of our
Draco took the parchment, a smear of something that he sincerely hoped was mud and nothing more sinister swiped across it. He glanced at the heading and closed his eyes, doing everything he could to rein in his temper. They couldn’t afford to lose Ernie. There was no one else willing to work his crazy hours to keep this place functional. “In the bin? The invoice was in the bin?” He took a deep breath. Ernie
“No, you’re kidding.” Harry chuckled and shook his head as he returned to his whisking.
“I don’t see why not. Especially not after tonight.”
“Waiting for me to…? Wait,” Draco raised an eyebrow, “you’re trying to blame me for your blue balls?”
family — and even though it had left him with an overstuffed stomach and a slight ringing in his ears, there was no doubt they all loved him.
“That man,” Draco said slowly, “that late-night visitor… It was you.”
fest... Since it's an anon fest, I'm not supposed to reveal any details before the reveals on 15 June, so if you want to have a guess on which LCD story may or may not have my name attached to it, I won't be able to confirm or deny anything until then. 🤐
“Still; older,” Harry chuckled. “Still out of breath.”
“Did you bring your pyjamas, Santa?”
“Perfect,” Draco sighs. “Abso-fucking-perfect.” He takes another sip of his tea and lowers his mug to his lap, cradling it in his hands as he leans his head back against the couch cushion.  Harry tries to ignore the pleasant warmth spreading through his chest at the words, tries to keep his gaze off the pale arch of Draco’s neck as the man continues, now addressing the ceiling. “You’re too good to me, Harry. You’re too good for your own damned good.”
“Pans, nobody has been there to feed it for days. I have to go.” He jumped up, making Smaug yip and saunter off to his room while Draco gathered Charlie’s things back into the bag. He bit his lip, only hesitating for a brief moment before he grabbed the man’s keys and slipped them into his pocket.
“No,” Draco said, instantly feeling sheepish.
“Do you even go on any dates?” Draco peers at him from the corner of his eye, frowning. He’s still resting his head on top of the couch’s back, a lock of his damp, post-shower hair falling in front of his eyes as he turns to Harry with a faint smile. “You’re quite a catch, you know?”
Draco glanced over at Harry, who was currently smiling up at some wizard and his wife, making polite conversation despite the strained tiredness only Draco knew to detect in his perfectly friendly features. If Draco hadn’t already known how much Harry loved him, this, if anything, would’ve been the ultimate proof; Harry deciding to be here for Draco and his shop’s grand opening regardless of all the hero-worshipping thrown his way.
Received: My precioussss, where are you?
Draco took in the face he’d once known so well. The famous scar was mostly faded, though still cut through that dark eyebrow in the same way it always had. He’d lost the look of childhood, as was to be expected in his late twenties; his jaw was well-defined, dark from an extended five o’clock shadow, and his cheekbones prominent. As always, though, his eyes drew the most attention, and now more than ever. No longer hidden behind glasses, the emerald green positively glowed in the low firelight from the hearth.
Gryffindor Tower, Hogwarts
When he returns two minutes later, he’s managed to collect himself somewhat, shrugging on his coat without much fuss and complementing it with a steel-blue scarf and black leather gloves.
“So, what do you want, Harry?” Draco murmured against Harry’s lips.
“Which I’m quite grateful for, both as an employer and as the one responsible to pay for the Reserve’s insurance policies.”
Annoyed, Draco kept walking, forcing Harry to catch up. “Yes, Harry. I help to run a charity. Is that so hard to believe?”
Harry takes a deep breath through his nose, willing his heart to slow down. His fingers are itching to run through his hair, but he manages to resist the urge at the last minute. Instead, he hastens to clench his fist and knock on the door before his courage leaves him.
Drunk-no Malfoy,
“I know it may have sounded extreme yesterday, but I meant what I said. The Weasleys have been through a lot, especially Molly.”
Yes, Kingsley Shacklebolt is the new Minister. And maybe you’re right, maybe I shouldn’t have bothered him with my questions, but since he’s the one I know best in that bureaucratic nightmare of a Ministry — except Arthur, who’s in the wrong department to be able to help me get any answers — it only felt natural to turn to him. And I’m sure he doesn’t mind; he’s a good guy.
And no, you’re not going to go insane, Malfoy. You’re much too stubborn to let that happen, and you only have eight months left now; you can do it.
Draco took his foul tea and headed towards a seat on the edge of the tearoom, but a head of dark hair caught his attention, and he made a beeline in that direction.
Harry reached out and held Draco’s arm to stop him. “But a relationship is about you, too, not just what Charlie wants. If you want to go, you deserve to go.”
“Good luck!” Pansy called as he threw the Floo powder into the fire.
“Sir?”
Molly wrapped Harry in a hug before he could even get in a reply or brush the Floo dust from his shirt. As if he wasn't living in Charlie's old room and hadn't just left the house that morning to get Draco for the party.
He began drying the dishes, opening cupboards to tuck them all away neatly, then turned around and glared at the countertops. “
“Yes, thank you. I’ll remember,” Harry forced out, and Draco grinned.
“Grandma!” came Teddy’s excited voice from downstairs.
Even after fifteen years, Draco was still humbled by the effect something as simple as a cup of tea could have on this man. It was as if Harry never would be able to get used to the fact that someone would want to care for him, to love him the way he deserved to be loved. It was only one of the many reasons Draco still wasn’t able to think about the Dursleys without wanting to punch something, but also one of the
PS I think Snape disliked me mostly because of how much I reminded him of my dad. To say there was no love lost between them would be putting it mildly, and Snape surely had his reasons for hating my father’s guts. (And not only because the love of his life chose James instead of him.) Of course, I didn’t know any of that when we first met, but now that I do, and considering how much I’ve always resembled my father, I can understand why Snape barely tolerated the sight of me.
“Yes, well.” Hannah gave him a wry smile. “You wouldn’t have to do it without me, would you, since this is all my fault in the first place. Now, go over there and get your man.”
Harry can’t help it; his eyes roll of their own accord. They’ve just completed their first ‘inspirational workshop’, a round of indoor mini-golf — a concept Harry wasn’t even aware existed but had ended up enjoying quite a lot — and now the time has apparently come for today’s introductory ‘mini-seminar’.
“My family loves you—”
“Good. Well, then.” Draco forced a shrug, willing himself to sound casual. “I was about to offer my help, not that I know the first thing about kinesiology, but, well… I don’t know. Just, I mean, Janie
Draco grimaced. He figured he’d deserved that. “It’s not all I do,” he bit out, his tone sharp. Too sharp for the innocent question, he realised. He sighed. “I’m sorry. That was rude of me. I generally only work here a day or two per week, taking care of their accounting.”
“I…” Draco swallowed. “I really don’t think…” Words left him as Potter’s thumbs started rubbing small circles at the nape of his neck.
Harry opened his mouth. Closed it. Swallowed. Then, “Draco Malfoy, would you allow me to study the muscles of your body?”
Draco's body seems to chant as he claims Harry, and Harry willingly allows himself to be claimed.
Harry takes him to The Golden Cauldron; because sometimes it’s actually warranted to use your fame to get ahead in life, like when you want to take your boyfriend to the most exclusive restaurant in wizarding Britain on Valentine’s Day.
to know,
Bellatrix’s exasperated sigh was loud enough to reach all the way to where Draco stood, and Draco could almost hear the accompanying eye roll. “All right, Cissy. I guess I can always find him later. He won’t be going back to Hogwarts until Saturday, right?”
Received: You
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry groaned, sounding almost pained with awe. “Can I—?”
Too close.
Draco braced himself against the cold ground, bucking his hips in an attempt to throw Potter off before he noticed the complication growing rapidly in Draco’s trousers. But it was too late. Potter was too strong, keeping him pinned down as easy as anything, and to make matters even worse, in his irrational panic, Draco had managed to alert Potter to the one thing he’d fought so hard to hide from the git ever since they ended up as roommates. Potter’s impossibly green eyes widened and then he thrust his hips against Draco’s, gasping as he found his initial suspicions confirmed.
Draco laughed. “Open book, I hope.” He turned and gestured to all the food. “This all looks and smells amazing. Please tell me you had help.”
. It’s all Harry can do not to come right there on the spot.
The man.
… Of course not, because that’d be silly, right?
“Are you listening to me?”
An image flashes through Harry’s mind, of soft, pale skin shivering under his hands and lips, and he swallows as he tries to ignore the twitch of interest in his pants.
“But…”
“Fuck, I’m sorry,” Harry stammered. “I heard you back here and was trying to let you know I’d arrived.”
He shifted his weight and freed Harry’s left wrist too, no longer able to resist the urge to touch Harry’s naked flesh any way he could; his sensitive nipples, his smooth flank, his round arse, and his thick, muscular thigh. As he did, Harry’s hand went straight for Draco’s hair again, fingers digging into his dishevelled tresses as if wanting to get tangled up for life, and not only in his hair either. And fuck if Draco didn’t enjoy that thought, far more than he probably should. They’d never talked about this being more than a one-time thing, after all. Heck, they’d just dived right in, all reckless and foolhardy — something he might have expected from a Gryffindor like Harry, sure, but never ever from himself.
That said, let’s try for a lighter topic, shall we? I’m sure we’ll be able to find some muggle sports that strike your fancy. Football and cricket are the most popular ones I think, at least here in Britain, but if those are too slow for you, there’s plenty of other stuff as well, like horse racing, or why not polo? That should be a snobby enough sport for you; even the muggle royals play it. Or maybe you’re more for technique and precision, like fencing or figure skating or something. Honestly, unlike us, muggles compete in almost anything. Running, swimming, throwing, climbing, jumping, skiing, diving — you name it; I can assure you it’s a thing.
You light up at whatever Parkinson is saying, the corners of your mouth curving into a smile. It looks good on you, that smile, so open and genuine. Nothing like the countless smirks and haughty sneers that once were your shining armour. The reflections of the festive fairy lights make your eyes glitter in the dim room, and with that smile adorning your features, you look more relaxed and carefree than I’ve ever seen you before.
? Merlin, Harry’s not sure his walls are strong enough to handle talking with Draco about love.
Received: Dinner. My treat.
“Huh?” Draco was blurry when Harry turned to look at him, an abstract blob of colour extending a hand with Harry’s… “Oh, thanks.” Harry accepted his glasses and put them on, grinning as Draco’s striking features returned to his face.
“I wouldn’t say no to a date.”
Because Harry Potter wasn’t dead. He was moving, for Salazar’s sake, and no one but Draco seemed to notice. They were all too preoccupied with the imminent arrival of reinforcements — whose, Draco had no idea — to witness Potter rise like a Phoenix from the ashes and… disappear.
He nodded again and looked so uncomfortable that Harry wanted to laugh. Instead, he slipped his hand in Draco's and pulled him towards the door and the noise of the Weasley clan that could easily be overheard from the garden.
“Pott— Harry…” Draco squeezes his eyes shut and swallows before they flutter open once more. “I-I don’t think that’s a good idea.” He shifts his weight to his toes and rises to standing in one elegant fluid motion, starting to back away. Harry’s Seeker reflexes are the only reason he manages to grab Draco’s pale arm in time, preventing him from moving too far.
a lot. What the hell are they all even for?) It’s highly entertaining to think about you muttering and swearing as you try to get rid of the dust and cobwebs with nothing but a first-class Nimbus at hand. (You know, even most muggles are better equipped than that, with hoovers and mops and cleaners of all kinds.) The idea of you collapsing sore and sweaty in bed every night after a hard day’s work has effectively brightened my entire week.
deal.
I give him a stern look. “My girlfriend would,” I say, surprised by my own words. I have no idea where they come from; I haven’t even looked at a girl in over a year. To be honest, I’m not sure where the surly attitude comes from either. If it weren’t for the monster currently running rampant in my chest, I’d probably just wave the man off with a wink and a laugh. As it is, though, I have no patience for this man, this smirking smug idiot who keeps my attention away from you.
well. “Right. Well. I’ll just clean this up and get it paid, then.”
…Bellatrix.
Someone to laugh with, to share his joy with.
“Argh, all right then,” Draco said through clenched teeth. Not that he wanted to come with. He just needed to get Potter’s hands off his body before he accidentally let out the moan threatening to escape his throat.
“Pansy—” He really didn’t want to be left to his thoughts. He needed to stay busy. He needed not to think too much.
Draco lifted the lid off the one in front of him and sucked in a breath. It was the sculpture.
"Draco," he gasps when he's finally able to breathe again. "Fucking. Hell."
. Turn up on time, don’t be under-dressed, at least
Draco willed his body to remain upright as he nodded slightly. “Okay.”
"Do you trust me?" Draco's voice is quiet and vulnerable.
“Then…?”
And all right, Harry guessed he did, in a way. Between the Christmas tree in the corner and the yule log crackling merrily in the hearth, a well-dressed Santa Claus could but complete the picture.
loving relationship would even make you less of a git? Maybe if you found someone to love like that, you’d eventually end up less of an arse? What if the loving devotion to a wife is what’d finally make you
“Uh, I think I have to object too.” Harry’s voice rang clear through the silent room, and Draco’s eyes shot up. Harry met his gaze with a pleading look, his brows drawn and lips tight.
“Well, I’ll let you get back to work.” George grabbed Draco and gave him a loud kiss on the cheek before heading out of the room. When he got to the door, he stopped and turned, mirth twinkling in his eyes. “If you’re younger than me and marry my older brother, does that make you my kid brother or another big brother?”
Harry chuckled. “Now who’s sex fixated?”
“I—” Draco ventured, only to find himself fresh out of words.
“Um, thanks.” Draco bit his lip, only hesitating for a moment before convincing himself to cross the threshold. “Here.”
Draco looked around, searching for a glimpse of Harry’s messenger bag which he knew to contain what they’d need to get started. There were a lot of muscles to keep track of, Draco realised, so this could take a while. Not that Draco would mind if it did; it wasn’t like he itched to get back to his empty flat anytime soon.
Harry turned around in Draco’s arms, craving another taste of those lips, another glimpse of his gorgeous angel, when… the distinct chime of the Floo alarm sounded through the room.
“Hmm. Yes, well, with everything that’s been going on, and Charlie in the hospital, and then Smaug ate something he shouldn’t have yesterday and kept getting sick. I had to take him to the Animal-Healer so they could vanish a piece of leather from his stomach.”
Harry gave Draco a slightly crooked grin, his eyes searching Draco’s face like a caress.
“Potter—”
Narcissa sounded certain, but Draco knew she was lying. Because he was a coward, wasn’t he? Hiding here in the depths of the library instead of going over there, confronting his aunt and defending his mother and his own honour. Careful not to make a sound, Draco raised his hands close to his waist, the left still clutching the coin while the right slowly reached for the wand hidden in his left sleeve. He had no idea what he’d do once he held it, but he had to do something, right?
Beside Harry, Draco chuckled. “Yeah, something like that.”
Potter didn’t let him explain, choosing instead to silence Draco with a bruising kiss.
Harry’s hands ventured up to cradle Draco’s heated cheeks and he angled their heads to allow for the kiss to deepen. Sucking in Draco’s lower lip between his own, Harry begged for entry in the only way his brain could manage at the time; with a whine so desperate and needy he’d be loath to admit himself capable of anything like it for the rest of his life. But capable he was — apparently, Draco brought it out of him — and thankfully, Draco didn’t seem to disapprove. On the contrary, he readily opened his mouth and flicked out the tip of his tongue to meet Harry’s. The connection sent a flush of arousal straight to Harry’s core, igniting every fibre of his body until he felt ready to soar broomless through the sky.
I’m glad to hear Narcissa is recovering. I get if you feel like it’s going too slow, but I bet it would’ve been even worse if you hadn’t been there to care for her. I can’t say she’s given me the best impression on the few occasions our paths have met, but I must admit, reading about her in your words makes her sound more ‘human’ than I’ve ever given her credit for in the past. From what I gather, it seems her gardening fills much the same function in her life as cooking does for Molly, and with that in mind, it’s not hard for me to imagine how much being in that sunroom surrounded by her precious plants means to Narcissa. I never would’ve pegged her as the artistic type, but now you’ve got me all curious about her drawings. You make them sound rather remarkable. Please tell me there are pictures of baby you in that stack too? I bet toddler Malfoy from his adoring mother’s point of view would be a sight to behold. Do you draw too?
When Draco glanced over this time, the bloke was already composing his next message, seemingly unaware of his friend shaking her head fondly at him before returning her focus to her revision notes.
“Er…” Charlie said after a while, glancing over Harry’s shoulder. “I probably shouldn’t hog any more of your time, mate. Your boyfriend’s staring daggers at me.”
But Harry needed more. He needed Draco, needed him in ways he hadn't ever done before. He needed something new, something he was almost afraid to verbalise. Deciding to let his actions speak for him instead, he grabbed onto Draco's hips, barely giving his mate a moment to brace himself before he turned on his heel, Apparating them both to their rented cottage and the bedroom awaiting them inside.
on a date if they wanted to ‘sweep you off your feet’?”
PPS Don’t worry about Theo and me, that kiss was just a one-time thing, I promise. Merlin, if I had known you were still so hung up on him, I never would have let him do it. Any other blokes in your past that I should know about, just so I don’t accidentally step on your precious toes again?
Holy hell.
Sent: I believe I've already responded to the dancing query.
. I’m in love with him, you know, think I have been ever since Eighth Year. I just thought I’d managed to put it aside, but…” He fed the dog some more of his sandwich but avoided eating anymore himself. “It’s just… He seems to know me inside and out — you should see this snowglobe he made me. Only it’s not snow, it’s flowers, and it’s so gorgeous — and he’s got this kindness in him, this ability to care about people that I’ve never seen in anyone else. But then, I guess now that I’ve gotten to know his family, I understand it better. It’s all of them.”
Sent: Give it a go.
When his message came through, Draco noticed a slight tensing of shoulders but little else. The bloke — no, Draco still couldn’t bring himself to call him by his name — kept talking to his friend, only briefly glancing down at the phone in his hand once she turned to look something up in one of the textbooks. A covert smile transformed his already striking features, making it impossible for Draco to tear his eyes away from the sight as the bloke started tapping out a reply without ever looking up to meet Draco’s gaze. Only when Draco’s phone vibrated in his hand did he come to his senses and resume his breathing.
The room let out a collective gasp, but Draco refused to look away from Arthur, eyes pleading for his understanding.
"Harry!" several voices echoed as he and Draco stepped into the chaos. Everyone was there, even George who was looking better than Harry had seen him in ages.
Draco gulped and forced his gaze back to Harry’s, the vibrant, twinkling green making Draco’s head spin.
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, well, we’ll see. I can’t imagine Charlie being happy away from his dragons.”
can entertain you.”
Instead, I lay down beside you, curling my body against yours, my chest against your back, my thighs behind your legs, wrapping my arm around you and hoping my presence will say all the things my words aren’t able to. My hand comes to rest over your beating heart, moving with the ebb and flow of your ragged breathing. I’m still not sure whether you really want me here, whether you mind me witnessing your tears, but then you clasp my hand with your own, clutching it tightly to your chest, and I know I’ve done the right thing.
She stared at him, then sighed. “Ernie has requested Christmas Eve and Christmas Day off. His little sister just got engaged and his family is making a big deal about it. And Jillian has a ski vacation already scheduled.”
Draco frowned at her amused smile and wracked his mind, trying to figure out what she was blabbering about, then remembered thinking something of the sort before he dozed off earlier. Merlin, had he said those things out loud?
Stubborn, and foolish.
As it was, though, Harry couldn’t for the life of him figure out what the man was up to, and it was driving him insane.
Draco’s chest swelled a little with pride. “Thank you, sir. Although, I just work for the Park Foundation. I wouldn’t say I’m a mastermind behind anything.”
Even so, he can’t find it in him to move away. Instead, he attempts for some distance by placing an open palm on Draco’s chest. The sight of his hand there, touching Draco’s body, is so surreal Harry can’t take his eyes off it. He’d never thought he’d be able to touch Draco like this, that Draco would ever let him. With only a thin layer of cotton between them, Harry can feel Draco’s rapidly beating heart under his palm, its pulse reverberating up Harry’s arm towards his chest, reaching for Harry’s heart as if wanting to become one with Harry’s heartbeat.
“Okay.” Teddy’s pout vanishes as he catches sight of the pond. “Can I go look at the ducks?”
Harry hisses in return. "
“But…” Someone had to be messing with him. Like a start-of-school prank or something. Because it simply couldn’t be… It didn’t. Make. Sense. “I don’t…”
All Harry really
could be my mate, I was sure I was going to lose my mind.” Then his eyes fling open and Harry’s heart clenches at the sudden panicked look on his face. “Not literally. I know there are all kinds of rubbish stories out there about Veela bonds, but… Harry, my life isn’t dependent on you accepting me or anything. If you don’t want this, if
Yeah, your aunts are quite alike, aren’t they? I can’t really blame you for doing a double-take at seeing Andromeda, I did too, the first time I met her. Apart from their looks, though, they really don’t have anything in common except being your mother’s sisters. Andromeda is really sweet, and I still don’t know how she manages to hold herself together what with losing both husband, daughter, and son-in-law in the span of a few months. I guess her secret must have something to do with your cousin Teddy. Yes, he’s indeed a handful, but an adorable one, and being with him does put the past in perspective. He’s a metamorphmagus like his mum so his hair changes all the time. The turquoise is just for when he’s feeling antsy. I guess he wasn’t all that pleased to be told to sit still for the photo.
The beautiful, blonde-haired child ran from the room as fast as she’d entered and seen them, but Sirius simply ran to scoop her up, grinning. “Victoire, I got you!”
“What?”
As if that was an option.
“You know I’m right here, right?” Charlie said with a sharp look at the Healer, “Think you could talk to me? I mean, if I can handle a dragon, I think I can handle a little bit of memory loss.” His eyes widened, and he looked around the room in alarm. “Wait, what happened to Daenerys? Is she okay?”
“Fuck, Hannah, I was delirious.” He looked around, making sure nobody was watching them, even if they couldn’t hear. “I’ve had a crush on him for ages, all right, but we’ve barely even spoken!”
“True.” Harry took another sip of his tea before setting his cup aside on the end table next to him. “He’s nervous about the sorting, though. Apparently, Ron’s been talking shit again.”
With that thought occupying his mind, it was hardly a surprise when that same ginger hair flashed across the periphery of Draco’s sight. Of course, it would draw his attention; it always did.
“Come on, Tony. Live a little,” Hannah said, bumping his shoulder before getting to her feet.
Despite himself, Draco leaned in, curiosity piqued. The revolving rings, one inside the next; the small hourglass in the middle… Draco’s eyes widened. “Yes. It’s a…” He swallowed, mouth dry, heart racing. “…a time-turner.”
A nice long walk with Harry Potter, with his perfectly green eyes and wonderfully tight arse—the man who Draco certainly did
- Harry
When Harry turned, he found Draco's lips with his own, losing himself in the familiar taste of his mate. It was sweet and heady, making Harry's blood thrum with each passing moment.
“What was it that made you leave?”
Harry sighs, leaning forward to set his mug down on the coffee table before he accidentally spills its content in his lap. “It doesn’t matter, okay?” he says, slumping back against the cushion.”It’s not mutual, so—”
“But what?”
“I can’t believe there isn’t any place like this in Diagon Alley!” Ron had exclaimed. He had already fallen in love the first time he’d entered the shop, instantly enamoured by the broad variety of hot and cold beverages, syrup flavours, and delicious pastries, bakes, and cakes. “There really should be, don’t you think, ‘Mione? I’m sure the first to open one would make a fortune in no time.” He had then proceeded to elaborate on his idea for a solid half-hour, blabbering on about his vision of an entire chain of coffee shops all around wizarding Britain; Hogsmeade, Ottery St Catchpole, Godric’s Hollow… He’d even started coming up with name suggestions (all of them abysmal, of course) before he’d looked up at Draco — who’d just come by to clear their table of empty plates which seemed to have been licked clean of every last crumb — and said, “You should do it!”
“Yes, Draco, to talk.” Draco swore he could hear a smile in those words. “I know you’re feeling worried about going to Hogwarts tomorrow, and I thought…”
“What was that?” Draco smirked and stepped closer, careful to avoid the ice.
Well, I guess I can’t avoid the erumpent in the room forever… You and Blaise?
Sent: What, pray tell, is a b-day?
With nothing to do and nowhere to go, he usually didn’t mind taking on the Friday shifts, even ending up trading them with other colleagues on the rare occasion he wasn’t already scheduled to work. Like this week, when he’d agreed to swap his Saturday shift with Mandy whose sister was visiting from Wales and had insisted on a night on the town. An agreement he deeply regretted now as the afternoon dragged on, seemingly with no end in sight.
The words were casual, almost flippant, but there was no denying the strain in his voice. Draco wished he could determine the cause of his unease, because if…
“Tell me she’s okay. Please?”
That was…insightful, actually. Generally, Draco hated to be sad, so he usually pushed the memories aside, afraid of them creeping up on him. But, well, maybe…
“Yeah?”
It was useless. As long as Draco was near, Harry didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell of resisting the magnetic pull towards him. Harry wanted him, ached for him, and there was absolutely nothing he could do to avoid it.
Something had to change. And if Draco didn’t have the decency to stay away when he was supposed to, maybe Harry should be the one to create the necessary distance instead? Maybe that could be his New Year’s resolution or something; taking some time off work to travel the world? He’d miss Teddy something fierce, but maybe it’d be worth it? Just to gain a little perspective, to meet some new people, and… maybe even get laid? (Merlin knew he needed to get laid, what with him sitting here, in the presence of a child, lusting for a hundred-year-old.)
"Then I'll make some calls next week to see what flats are available. Or we can try a house?"
She grimaced at the thought but nodded, a twinkle of amusement in her hazel eyes. No doubt, she was also thinking back to one of their first encounters back at the beginning of term when they’d commiserated over her friend’s abysmal taste in hot beverages.
"What they think they see is an illusion," Harry says, wrapping his arms around Draco's warm torso in an attempt to stave off the cold night air. He hasn't noticed it much before, but now that the arousal is gone, he is thankful for the heat Draco always seems to emanate. Harry tilts his head up to meet Draco's gaze. "I see you."
Draco sensed they weren’t talking about missing limbs anymore, but it was New Year’s, dammit, and he wasn’t going to let himself get overly maudlin pondering any deep thoughts. “Yes, well.”
A contemplative silence settled between them, and when Harry finally spoke, his voice was soft and rough.
Harry smirked and reached under the collar of his shirt to fish up a circular bronze pendant hanging from a long chain around his neck. “Have you ever seen one of these before?”
Received: Then don’t stand over there and ogle me like a creepy lurker. Come over here and do it for me, Malfoy.
Sent: I’d rather you passed out where you did instead of in some alleyway.
“Anyway… Thanks for coming.” Harry said as he paused at the far end of the long aisle, his hands shoved deep in his jeans pockets. A lock of his unruly raven hair had fallen in front of his eye, and instead of flicking it back, he peeked up at Draco through his inexplicably long eyelashes. If Draco didn’t know better, he’d assume the mighty war hero was nervous about something. “We keep the fireworks and anything else flammable in the cave. It’s back here.”
“I’m not sure what Charlie’s told you, but Molly lost two brothers, twins, in the first war. Gideon and Fabian were friends of mine and good fighters, but, well, it was hard on her when they were killed. When she lost Fred in the final battle, she almost didn’t recover. Losing a loved one is hard, but losing a child… It’s something nobody should ever have to endure.”
“Then, take care of this and don your finest coat.” Harry motions for Draco to take the rose, which he does after another brief moment of hesitation. Harry can’t help grinning at his stunned expression. “I wouldn’t have minded standing here all evening waiting for your brain to catch up if it weren’t for the fact that we have a reservation to…”
And he did. The two of them came in almost every day after classes, occupying the small corner table in the back, spreading out their textbooks and essays and lecture notes all over its surface until the tabletop seemed to be made out of paper rather than wood. At first, Draco had assumed the two of them were together, but as the days passed and he never caught them kissing, or even touching, he wasn’t all that sure anymore. They felt close, though, as if they were the kind of friends who shared a flat and occasionally fell asleep next to each other in front of the telly. The kind of friendship Draco sometimes wished he had with someone too. Not that he minded living alone, it was pretty nice not to have to compromise and adjust to other people the way he’d had to do in the Slytherin dorms. It was just… well, sometimes alone turned into lonely, and when it did…
“Auction items setup, protective charms up?”
"Shhhh, you'll wake Orion, and I'm rather sure we don't want an audience for this."
They’d invited him to Christmas dinner? Draco’s stomach tightened, and he moved to the table to sit, trying to calm his racing thoughts. He wanted to go, to be part of this family tradition more than anything, but it would only make this whole lie worse. He couldn’t do it. He shouldn’t.
“I thought I already was…”
A yip at their feet cut through Draco’s momentary haze and brought him back to his senses.
Sent: Fuck, Potter. You must be pissed.
“Well, shall we start this?” the Ministry official asked, sounding bored. He shot an irritated glance at Draco. “We’re already ten minutes late as it is.”
With a tad more power than is strictly necessary, Harry flicks his wand, sending the tea leaves out of existence. If only his conflicting emotions were as easily vanished. A dash of milk in the rainbow mug —
Thinking rationally, Harry knew chances were minimal that anyone would try something in the middle of the holiday rush, but that didn’t mean his protective instincts ever took a break. Although it felt like a lifetime ago, the war wounds were still fresh and deep enough for some resentful people to take justice into their own hands, driven by a perceived obligation to right the wrongs they believed had been wrought in the aftermath of the war. There were still wizards and witches out there who believed in Voldemort’s agenda; anonymous, faceless people who hadn’t been active in the war and therefore had never been identified or apprehended. Who knew when any one of them would suddenly think it a good idea to attack the man who had vanquished their admired martyr?
“Draco,” Charlie said, his voice bright and cheerful.
Well, that explains why Ron hasn’t snuck out tonight. Harry refrains from commenting on the matter and wills himself not to think about what his best mates have been doing with him asleep in the same room. He looks down at the Marauders’ Map in his hands and knows Hermoine will insist on getting herself involved if he tells her what he’d been searching for. “Sorry. It’s nothing. Just looking for a jumper.”
“Hey, wait,” Harry called out, catching up, his breathing steady despite the run with the heavy box. “So where are we going?”
to touch them, but something tells him doing so would be too intimate a gesture. His hand is already reaching out when he stops himself, just inches from Draco’s shoulder, and clears his throat, meeting Draco’s eyes.
With his eyes fixed on the red velvet above, he goes through each sound, ticking off each one in his mind, as if from a checklist. Neville’s snore, check. Ron’s mumbling, check. Low murmurs from Dean and Seamus’s bed—officially Seamus’s bed, but they’ve hardly slept apart since Fifth Year—check. The brisk wind outside, whipping against the tower’s windows, confirming his place in space and time; Scotland, late November. Check.
Draco turned to the room at large but kept his eyes on the family. Charlie’s family. “I’m in love…”
Molly wants me to stay indefinitely. She’s even offered me BIll’s old room since he lives in Cornwall with Fleur now, but I don’t know. I guess I don’t mind staying here as long as Ron and Hermione are around too, but they’re already talking about getting their own place and if they do, where would that leave me? Holed up with my friends’ parents like a fucking charity case? No thanks. Not that Molly and Arthur would ever think of me as a charity case, I know that, but still. It feels like I’m intruding on something I shouldn’t, like the broody black sheep in a flock of cheerful ginger.
Oliver Wood, Captain of the Wimbourne Wasps, strode into the room looking just as windswept and handsome as he did on the covers of Quidditch Weekly. He glanced at Draco, who was already standing up and gathering his things.
attend. I’ve told them all about you, and they’re ever so eager to make your acquaintance.”
"And the brightest witch of our age," Ron boasted, resting his chin over her shoulder. "But of course you want to study first. You wouldn't be our Hermione if you didn't."
Sent: Good grief. Perhaps I should come get you.
“Y-You sure it’s him?” Teddy nodded. “The same man you met in Diagon Alley last week?”
Wrapped in his invisibility cloak and with Orion curled around his upper arm, Harry creeps across the grounds to the tower that holds the Owlery. It’s quiet but cold, and he’s sorely tempted to turn back to the warmth of his bed. He probably would, too, if it weren’t for that pulling… It’s starting to get uncomfortable, and Harry needs to figure out what’s going on.
Harry flicks the switch on the kettle, marvelling in the unlikely friendship he and Draco have managed to forge between them since the war ended. Who would’ve thought they’d ever be able to be in the same room without wanting to hex each other into next week? The perpetual rivals of their schooldays, the opposing poles of a full-on war, the indoctrinated Death Eater and the hero of the wizarding world.
“No. You’re staying here, my little dragon. Fireworks and foxes don’t mix.” He dug a small bite of liver out of his refrigerator and held it out then ran a hand over Smaug’s head as he inhaled the treat. “An entire evening alone with Potter, huh?” Draco thought back to his eighth year at Hogwarts when he’d been hopelessly pining for the Gryffindor’s attention. “You’d better wish me luck.”
our correspondence yet, that’s not really an option at the moment.
A reply popped up on the screen and Draco blinked, feeling strangely dizzy. Why did— Oh yeah, apparently the occasional intake of oxygen was still a requirement for keeping a functioning brain. Draco took a shaky breath, filing that observation away for future reference while waiting for his blurred sight to return to normal.
The rest of the collection faded into nothingness as soon as Draco’s gaze fell on the majestic piece in the middle. It was several feet tall and flowed up like fountains of spun sugar twisted around one another, the rich blues, yellows, and teals so vivid that Draco could have sworn they were moving, undulating against one another. It was beautiful. Sensuous. Arousing.
want to open up that particular can of flobberworms.) I haven’t really thought about it before, but it’s essentially the same bigotry, the same narrow-mindedness, the same xenophobia — just at opposite ends of the spectrum. The difference between your situation and mine, though, and what probably shaped us so differently despite growing up with such similar parental figures, is that yours loved you whole-heartedly while mine basically hated my guts above everything else in the world.
Malfoys didn’t run. Ever. Running was for reckless Gryffindors or absent-minded Hufflepuffs, Draco knew that. Which was why he wasn’t running out of the Great Hall heading for the stairs, wasn’t running away from Potter and Bell and the truth that would soon explode and destroy him, his family, and everything he’d worked for for so long.
Draco felt panic rising in his chest.
Harry looked annoyed. “I know you’ll be fine. I just want to walk with you. Is that a problem?”
“You know…” Draco said, lifting his gaze to give Harry a mischievous hint of a smirk, “I was thinking…”
Draco studied him for a moment, fingers still moving idly over his wine glass. “What
Smaug started pawing at his pointy ears, the red fur that feathered from the sides fluttering as he groomed.
“No buts, Teddy.” The boy flinched at his clipped tone, and Harry realised with trepidation that he, in his distress, had brought his godson to the verge of tears. He swallowed and forced the agitation from his face, careful to replace it with something more akin to concern. “Listen,” he said softly as he squatted in front of the boy. “I know you’re excited to meet Santa, darling, but this is serious. I don’t want to lose you.”
Harry didn’t want to hang around downstairs alone on Christmas evening. He didn’t want to be reminded of his loneliness tonight of all nights; this evening, meant to be spent with the ones you loved most..
He hadn’t planned to elaborate on the matter, but the wine had apparently tampered with his mind-to-mouth filter. That, and the unexpected comfort of sitting in front of Harry, another wizard; the only person in this non-magic world who could possibly understand what Draco had gone through. When Draco spoke again, the words came unbidden, voicing a truth he, until now, hadn’t even admitted to himself.
Draco clenched his jaw and looked over to where Sirius was standing, an inscrutable look on his face.
“Ahh,” Draco smirked. No wonder she was nervous. “The chai latte is for her?” The girl nodded expectantly. “Well then, may I suggest a caramel ginger cookie?” The oversized biscuits were sweet — something she obviously liked — but not too sweet. The added ginger usually balanced it out perfectly, plus it paired well with the ginger in the chai spice mix.
The second part of it, though, the one I haven’t been able to tell anyone of them about, is that I just can’t bear the thought of spending another family holiday with them so soon after Christmas. You see, family holidays at the Burrow are truly something special, all children coming home to celebrate the occasion with their parents and significant others; even Charlie, who travels all the way from Romania just to spend some time with his siblings. It’s usually a joyous thing, filled with love and cheer, but ever since
Teddy frowned apologetically. “Then you probably won’t get any marshmallows on yours.”
“What flavour did you get?” I ask him as soon as the waiter leaves.
After that first encounter in the Owlery, the scene seemed to repeat itself, with Harry finding more and more reasons to send letters, and with Malfoy being there nearly every time, his gaze lost far away amongst the clouds in the sky.
“Yes, of course you are.” Draco’s smile is kind and warm. Harry wants to melt under it. “You’re kind and caring, funny and gorgeous—”
“Shit.” He’d heard of people who’d travelled through time before, but from what he’d heard, there were restrictions, limitations, regulations. Five hours, he’d read somewhere. And here was this man, who, if he really was the person he claimed to be, must have travelled not hours, but years. If not decades.
Draco was just about to say…
It came out weak and breathless, the pathetic sound of it reminding Harry to muster up his resolve. He wasn’t over Draco yet, but he would be. Soon. If he could just— Harry allowed himself one last look in Draco’s direction, pouring all his yearning into it with the hope to drain the seemingly fathomless well in his heart.
Harry grinned. “Nah, I’ll be okay. Besides, I’m comfortable this way.” He made a point of looking Draco up and down and gave a little nod in Draco’s direction. “You look nice, too.” The pleased sensation fluttering in Draco’s stomach turned sour in an instant as Harry frowned and added, “Are you wearing makeup?”
At least Harry was sleeping well. Now, if he could only make sure everything was okay with Malfoy, if he could figure out what was going on, he’d be able to concentrate on his studies and have a normal, final year at Hogwarts.
“Hey, cutie cub?” he offered in a jawn-induced break. “Time for bed.”
“Yeah…” Harry breathed, feeling dizzy.
"You know you're dancing now, right?" Draco said softly, his voice amused and his breath warm as it ghosted over the sensitive skin behind Harry's ear. "I thought we might have a little bit to eat, a glass of wine, and then as the sun sets behind the hill and we won't be seen, we could go for a fly."
“Er,” I say — oh, so eloquently — trying my level best not to acknowledge the sinewy thighs screaming for attention or the glimpses of black peeking out behind the garments as you move them right to left, left to right. “The blue one?”
“Harry?” Molly asked, then whipped her head to look at her youngest son. “Harry, what did you do?”
, and had huddled here in the darkness ever since, clutching his silver Sickle so tightly in his fist his fingers had started to tingle. Hiding. Like the fucking coward he was.
Draco had no idea how time-turners worked, but he’d figure it out. Heck, if nothing else, he’d become an Unspeakable, just to be able to get access to the secrets hidden deep within the Department of Mysteries. It wasn’t the first time he’d considered it. After all, Potter had once called him a mystery-solver, and Draco had to admit the implication had always intrigued him. He already knew he’d ace the N.E.W.T.s needed to qualify for the training, and while his work on the vanishing cabinet was something he’d rather not think about if he could help it, his success fixing it would make for an outstanding accomplishment on his CV if he ever were to apply.
Harry looked embarrassed and his face turned pink.
Happy birthday, Draco! I hope your 41st is celebrated properly with your near and dear ones. After all you've been through, you truly deserve it 💙
"Probably a good idea for my first time doing this," Harry chuckles against Draco's heated skin. "I wouldn't want you to drop me."
Draco pulls back to meet Harry's gaze, his eyes like molten silver in the moonlight. "Show me."
"What?" Harry asks, trying to raise his head, but Draco nudges it back down and scoots away slightly.

. Every single piece of you. Been wanting you for so long.”
“Yes, all right,” he said awkwardly. He liked Sirius. He reminded Draco of his mother in so many ways — his speech pattern, his demeanour, some of the expressions on his face. He was a little wild, though, even if he was thankfully missing Aunt Bella’s sparkle of insanity.
“Draco…” Harry clears his throat. “I’m Harry; your date for the evening.”
He stepped closer, and Harry jumped back with a grin. “No way, you jerk! You’re practically a married man, for Godric’s sake!”
Draco’s bare chest moves against his, his ribcage rising and falling under Harry’s with every ragged breath as they calm down. It takes a while before Harry realises their bodies move in perfect unison, that his own breathing is matched so perfectly with Draco’s, it’s like they’ve always been in sync. As if they’ve been following the same rhythm all along, only now uniting downstage to perform the gig’s main duet together.
“I bet they will.”
The owl swooped over, landed on the back of the armchair nearest to Draco, and stuck out his foot.
“Florence? A person?”
Sure, Draco guessed it could be nice spending more time with people his own age, maybe even get some new friends. The Wiltshire countryside didn’t really have a lot to offer in that regard, and even if his parents had made sure to invite the Crabbes and the Goyles on several occasions to let Draco get to know their boys before heading off to school, Theo was really the only other kid he’d call a friend. And now he was going to be with them every day. They would even share the same bedroom.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Charlie doesn't have a cat.”
The man walked over to sit on the edge of the bed, bending one leg up on the mattress to be able to face Draco fully. Without drawing his wand, he motioned with his hand, increasing the light in Draco’s orb as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
— for their every purchase? It was honestly so very impractical.) “I hadn’t realised your grand opening would bring so many extra customers to the rest of us, but it seems as though every witch and wizard in the country have suddenly decided to run their Diagon Alley errands today.”
Tomorrow.
Harry laughed and Orion peaked his head out of the bag Harry had set by their feet. "
You’ve dated boys? Seriously? How come I didn’t know about this? Who? When?
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I’m sure they do, but you owe it to yourself to do what you love. And anyone with eyes could tell this is something you love.” Draco’s eyes were back on the sculpture now, defenceless against its allure.
“Well, yeah.” Harry’s smirk served as a shot of espresso to Draco’s stirring arousal. “You see, you’ll never be ‘just anybody’ to me.”
Yeah, the Patronus Charm is indeed quite hard to get right. It took me almost all of Third Year before I managed to do it, but Merlin, what a kick it was that first time my stag leapt out from the tip of my wand. I take it you haven’t been able to conjure yours yet, but have you ever attempted it? You’re a powerful wizard, I bet you could do it if you only put your mind to it. If you want, maybe I could help? As you said, I have taught others how to do it, and I’d never say no to being there for the exhilaration of someone’s first successfully cast Patronus. Just bring your wand and a happy memory, and I promise we’ll be able to figure out the rest. Have you ever wondered what form yours would take?
I recall you not being too enthusiastic about having children, more resigned to the idea than anything else? Is that still the case? If so, I bet you’ll change your mind once you’ve met Teddy. He really is the most adorable boy to have ever walked the earth.

“Yeah, I get it.”
The fox raised his head and cocked it to the side, listening.
Sent: It’s a date, Potter.
Draco laughed. "Fine. You can remove it now."
Clothes were strewn all over the floor as they made for the bed, the buttons of Harry’s dress shirt flying in every direction once Draco got too impatient in his quest for naked skin. Draco didn’t stop as Harry’s calves hit the bed frame, instead crowding Harry until he fell backwards onto the dark blue bedspread. Harry scooted up to rest against the pillows and Draco followed him, straddling his legs and taking in the sight of the man sprawled out underneath him.
“Oh, fuck off.”
I think we can both agree on all the classrooms we shared throughout the years, the Great Hall, and the quidditch pitch, of course. The library, the hospital wing, and the corridor outside the Room of Requirement. (I haven’t dared try to conjure it since I came back. You know some speculate the fiendfyre might still be raging in there?) I still can’t help smiling every time I cross the courtyard where you were once turned into a furry little ferret, and I still roll my eyes every time I walk past the paddock where you insulted
— ☕ MONDAY ☕ —
“I had planned to come in earlier, but the shop has been awfully busy all day,” Madam Malkin said as she waited for Draco to retrieve her change from the cash register. (This part had taken far longer to get used to than Draco had anticipated; the twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, seventeen Sickles to a Galleon just didn’t make sense anymore. Not to mention, why did these magic folk still rely on cash —
He lets out a deep breath and wills himself to relax. "Okay, I'm ready. You can go on," he says, and his voice sounds weird — all rough and breathy.
“Then we’ll have to believe it’s going to be okay. I’ll stay close by and get you out if you need it. Deal?”
Draco blinked. His mind was reeling. “So you’re…”
She grinned. “Deal.”
Don’t think swapping yours truly for someone else would get you out of your promise, though, because I’m fairly sure I’m going to take you up on it. I honestly can’t wait to test your fan-repellant abilities in real life so you might as well book it in your calendar right away, my friend. You, me, Memorial Day 2000. It’s a
— and so does the people around me. The people I’m supposed to be socialising with.
When Harry remained silent, Draco opened his eyes to find something dark troubling Harry’s features, something Draco wasn’t able to make out. Regret? Sadness? No, it didn’t seem likely. Maybe Harry’s face was only reflecting Draco’s own mood.
A flash of white caught his eye over by the old escritoire in the corner, and Draco braced himself for another explosion that never came. He blinked. It wasn’t another curse. It was the light from the overhead lamp reflecting off… a metallic disc rolling over the polished hardwood floor, coming to rest somewhere underneath the antique piece of furniture. Draco’s gaze flitted to his hand, palm flat against the floorboards, fingers splayed wide, and his eyes widened, panic building in his chest.
The words had barely left him before Draco kissed him again, slowly, tenderly, achingly sweet. “I’ll take care of you, love,” he said. “Just relax and I’ll take care of you.”
And then they dance, cheek to cheek, wrapped up in each other’s arms, swaying to the soft tones of
“Where are we taking them?”
Draco stifled a sigh, but it didn’t escape the notice of his colleague.
Draco simply refused to accept it.
However, when George had come back to him a few months ago, telling him about Amanuensis Quills closing down — inside information he’d just gleaned at a Diagon Alley Shopkeepers’ Association meeting — Draco finally caved. The opportunity was too good to miss out on; the location too perfect to ignore and let go to waste. Situated right next to Madam Malkin’s, with the entrances of Gringott’s and Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes not even fifteen yards in each direction from its front door, the premises couldn’t have been more ideal for what they had in mind.
“Trust me, I do. They would do anything for you.”
“Yes, sir.”
So, I, well, we all went out last night to celebrate the end of N.E.W.T. exams and— And before you go all ‘don’t drink and write, or I’ll perish from your typos’ on me: I’m perfectly sober now, thank you very much.
“No, Pans. I’m not going to wait around on the idea that Harry Potter, of all people, might come around and decide I’m worth his time. Charlie wants me, and I want what he has to offer: friendship, family, companionship.” He sighed and rubbed his eyes. “I’m so fucking tired of being alone, Pans.”
