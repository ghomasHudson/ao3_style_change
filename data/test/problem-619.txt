Looking in the mirror he saw the reflection of himself sitting on the bed and the rest of the room. The clock on the wall behind him reminded him of the time. An hour left before he had to leave this saferoom.
Most girls were dressed up in long formal dresses in a rainbow of colors clashing against each other as they mingled. A few wore shorter ones to right under their knees as it was still a formal party. Harry even saw one girl wearing a silver jumpsuit with a matching feather in her hair. Although he had absolute no sense of fashion and was sure he was gay, he actually found the suit rather appealing. Finally, they went down the stairs and could see the great hall doors. The doors were opened wide and classic music were blasting out.
“Don’t you dare mention it!” Outraged and ashamed by the reminder, Harry pushed Malfoy away from him. Unfortunately, it didn’t stop the Slytherin from stepping right back and closer.
Chuckling, the man returned the box. “Ah, yes, just like my Delilah. She was always so certain what she wanted. She practically bought her own gifts for birthdays and Christmas.”
“Hey.” The group of fourthyears were startled at the seventh year Slytherin talking to them. “Where did you see Melck last?”
“There!” Hermione clapped her hands in a finished manner. “Alright, I have to go get dressed. I’ll see you downstairs.”
Harry was learning to accept the idea of Nathan's death. Draco was helping him a lot in dealing with it. He didn't feel so lost and alone as he used to and he didn't think about it with the same bitterness that he once did.
Dean looked lost, and his mind instantly registered one thing. Seamus was probably in danger. If the Death Eaters were on the loose again, and Seamus had been a spy for the Order, they must be after him. Nervously, he started to breathe unsteadily.
“THE BASTARD! I can’t believe he took part in such a hideous plan!” Harry stormed. “Oh my God, Draco. Is there something wrong with Nathan? Did he suffer from side effects or–”
‘Everyone dies one day. But my time is not up yet,’ I muttered. ‘I don’t know what I have. Nobody really does. Some think it’s purely psychological. It’s not contagious, that’s for sure. And even though it makes me sick, it also doesn’t seem fatal. But maybe... maybe in the future, I might come to lose all of my magic.’
“No, Draco, please tell me you won’t do that! It’s not safe, especially now that you’re pregnant! We don’t know what your father is planning,” Hermione said worriedly. “You must be careful now. Not only for yourself, but for your baby.”
The squeaking tree-door opened and the second Harry opened his mouth to say ‘hello’ he was attacked and pinched to the ground. Thankfully, the snow took most of the fall but Harry was pretty sure there would be a smaller bulge on the back of his head tomorrow. A heavy weight laid on his stomach and chest, almost forcing the air out of his lungs.
Snape froze for a moment and Harry wished he had kept his big mouth shut for once. Imagining the amount of points Snape would deduct, he was surprised when the man only looked somewhat amused.
Harry could for some reason only think of the most Slytherin way to end the game. He finally wrestled his arm free and quickly pulled Draco down, kissing him soundly on the lips. Draco was so surprised he almost knocked their teeth together. Harry gently continued to kiss the boy above him, grabbing his hair. The second he felt Draco lean into him, releasing an almost silent moan, Harry went for it.
He knew that at some point he would have to face the music. How long would he have left before everyone knew?
“Getting back on the important topic, why didn’t you tell me you have hired a new Professor?” Severus tried to keep his voice calm, hoping to keep Albus from seeing him as a stubborn child.
“It’s very you, love.” Seamus saved Neville’s awkward attempt to flatter. Unfortunately, Dean saw straight through them.
The two friends shared a quick cup of tea and an almost eatable brownie, before Harry said his goodbyes. He had almost spent three hours in Aodhan and Hagrid’s company. Now, as time got closer to dinnertime, he should probably spend some time with Jason or some of the other students.
Remus laid a hand on his knee.  “If Mr. Malfoy came to you and told you he had made a mistake whilst being drunk and had slept in the same bed, in their underwear, kissing with another Slytherin; Would you forgive him?”
Emerging from the bathroom, Seamus came out in his blue pyjamas. Still drying his dripping dark hair, he listened in on their conversation. After the freckled teen had made sure he was caught up, the three young men spend the rest of the evening discussing Harry’s sexuality. It took a crazy amount of time before Harry felt just the slightest comfortable enough to talk about the intimate details of his non- existing sex life. As the conversation continued and Seamus and Dean felt fine with sharing, Harry soon became his usual self again.
The three boys said goodbye to the others and headed for the first shop on their list. Harry told them he didn’t have any preferences and simply looked around wherever Dean dragged them. After three clothes store, Seamus had only gotten a gift for himself ‘But it perfectly matches the gloves I bought last time!’, and Harry still hadn’t found anything yet. He had a lot of people to buy for so perhaps he was being a little too picky. The next store he decided, he wouldn’t leave until he found something.
“No, I’m fine! It’s going- good. Oh, shut up.” Harry pushed the tall boy away from him as he laughed at his expense. The laughter slowly stopped as they stood in comfortable silence, simply enjoying the beautiful view of the sun sparkling in the snow and the lake. The squid had finally gotten enough ice broken up for it to lay there, content.
“Dragons are rare creatures Harry, they simply do not have time to take care of egg that has no chance of surviving. If his mother smelled it early that there was something wrong with him, she might have left to get a new egg quicker.”
Thankfully, the topic of Luna’s weird creatures did not return as everyone started gathering food on their plates. While Harry waited for the potatoes to be passed, he sent a worried glance to the left, catching the eyes of Jason. He too, seemed slightly worried. And although the thought made him feel like a terrible friend, Harry hoped no one would take Luna very seriously even if she had managed to actually guess right about Jason’s heritage.
“Thank you…” Harry’s ‘thank you’ turned rather awkward, as it turned out the strong grip was Professor Snape. Who else could it possibly have been?
Getting up he went to his trunk in which a single closed box lay. Spelling it opened, he looked inside. In it laid his family’s map, his father’s cloak and the photo album Hagrid had given him. And right on top of everything was Draco’s gift placed. The necklace was still one of his favorite things and the only present he had ever gotten from a boyfriend and Draco. Carefully, he placed the chain around his neck and locked it in the impossible small loop. Harry knew it was simply his mind playing tricks but he could swear the pendant felt warm against his skin.
“Maybe…” Harry said thoughtfully. “I’m used to people talking, I hate it, but I am. But I know about his family. I can’t imagine it will go well. I just want to know everything will go back to normal soon.” He started ranting.
“If you say so. But a tiny piece of advice; you might want to start to call them by their actual names, if Potter is supposed to believe you’ve actually changed at all.”
He pulled it back and fourth gently, simply noticing his inner walls as the wrapped around him. Feeling the slight pain fade, he moved another finger inside himself. Harry couldn’t help but rock back and fourth as his cock desperately tried to find any kind of friction in the water. Moaning, he slipped a third finger inside and finally hit god’s greatest creation. He couldn’t help moaning so loudly now that he noticed the mermaid had woken up by the noise.
Not really knowing where they were going, Jason looked around. They had entered the woods and would probably find themselves in front of the haunted house if they took a hard turn left now. He didn’t want to spend their date, fighting. Instead, he grabbed Blaise’s hand tighter and dragged him even further into the woods.
Fiddling with his own fingers, he moved in and closed the gap between them. As if natural, Draco placed his hands around him and pulled their chests together. Trying to keep his mouth from drying out, Harry licked his lips. Obviously, from the look on Draco’s face, he had seen the tongue dart out and moisturize the pink skin.
“Well, while I was rather nervous and uncertain of Severus’ intention. We once again met in the library the following week. I think perhaps Severus’ expected me to have told everyone in Gryffindor but since I hadn’t… he took it as a sign.” Remus’ otherwise pale cheeks slightly rouged. “This time as we were about to leave, I kissed him instead.”
It was too much. Hearing as well as seeing the expression on Potter’s face, ended him. Pushing as hard as he could, Harry legs swung over his ass, keeping him grinded almost painfully against him as they came.
“Merlin, Potter…” Draco pulled back to look him in the eyes. “How could you not have told me? What if something had happened to you?”
Severus had never been good with emotions. After he left Australia, he had also left his heart behind. A few months after, he had sealed his own fate as well as the rest of Britain when he delivered the prophesy to the dark lord and failed to protect his only friend and her son. As he had failed to take care of his own family. A very conflicted emotion settled over him at that second. The pain of losing an imaginative lifetime with his own family as well as the love of his life, crashed over him like a tidal wave. But one thing remained locked in his brain; He now had a new opportunity to have a son. His son.
Harry tried his best to take action. Altering between cheering him up by playing games and distracting him, to simply staying by his side during whatever Jason was doing too. Finally, after three days of staying locked up inside the castle, the snowstorm passed. A lighter, blue sky had appeared this morning and Harry had taking advantage and hurried to breakfast so he could see his friend once more.
“Blaise.” Jason tone had changed. Harry couldn’t help but notice the different attitudes Jason withheld. The usual uncaringly happiness it brought shifted whenever Zabini was involved. Harry took a second glance at the dark-skinned boy sitting quietly beside Malfoy.
“Come on, it’s fun.” Harry pleaded and smiled encouraging. Shaking his head, Malfoy stopped resisting and got dragged into the warm shop.  There weren’t any new toys or collector items so they simply went around trying the test products. Harry left a cockroach on the blond boy’s shoulder, and the fake insect sat for almost a minute before Malfoy felt it screeching against his ear.
“Surely.” Taking a sip, Esben looked towards the couple. “Well, you see, while my family hasn’t been running in the same circles as the Malfoys’, my father inherited a larger company fund in the recent years. As we started getting invited to gatherings, I only met Draco once on occasion, as a child. I barely remember being introduced and I’m certain he wouldn’t remember me now.”
“Have you finished the charm essay?” groaning behind him Crabbe picked up another sour worm angrily eating it. Zabini smirked and looked at him.
Laughing, Blaise sat down beside him on the bed. “And I suppose I should love having to hear Pansy nag you for all eternity?”
“Yeah, but I don’t think he should be alone down there. I tried to take him back myself but he sent me back to the tower.”
Barely able to keep himself up, Draco didn’t wander far. A person had the audacity to walk straight into him and entangled, they dropped to the floor. Draco was normally a very composed young man but he was certainly also a rather temperamental one. So, as he usual handled situations where he was caught off guard, he immediately turned to anger. He quickly tried to push himself away from the warm body beneath him. He had barely recognized the red collar coated robe before an angry shout reached his ears.
“Gay! I know, okay!”  Harry could barely stand to see the already very tight lips turn even narrower as well as the rather feisty look in the obsidian eyes.
“Oh right, like perhaps a girl? Maybe Ginny?” Harry tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice but he certainly wasn’t successful.
“Uuh buuuurn… literally.” Knott gibed, having obviously seen the exchange. Draco ignored the annoying boy behind him.
“-Therefor you shall be teamed up in pairs between the houses-” Groaning and small uttered protests rang amongst the students. Hagrid swiftly tried to settle them down.
Ah yes, saving the best for last. The almost sickeningly sweet voice woke him up from his daydreaming. Almost sighing, Draco responded.
Laughing, Dean told him to relax. “There is one thing you can do to prepare, so to speak. Learn your own body. Find out what you like. You like when you touch yourself normally. But where else besides just your genital. You know; neck, lips, nipples, ass-“
“Yeah, but I used them up on notes.” Seeing the derisive look on all his friends faces, the slightly buffed boy blushed and mumbled. “I spilt ink and sat on it, okay.”
His shaking hands were pulling his brown curls and Blaise was almost afraid he would pull out a lock.
“Harry please, all we are saying is just be careful, okay? Even if Jason isn’t a follower, there are still people out to get you, so… just look out, please?” Hermione leaned over to grab his hand.
But being Draco’s god father and a good friend of Narcissa, they were bound to see each other often. Lucius stubbornly stuck to his view and refused to speak to Severus for a few weeks. It didn’t last as long as Severus actually believed it would, considering Lucius’ nature. Unfortunately, Lucius would quickly learn that there were not so many people from their proud Slytherin pureblood society, whom he could tolerate for more than a few hours at a time. Therefor Severus once more found himself invited back into the luxurious library sipping whiskey and elfmade win. Now sipping, what could only be described as ‘old slug water’ he could
The volume of Ron shouting hurt his already aching head. For the first time in her young life, Hermione seemed lost for words. Her slightly widened eyes were the only indicator that she had heard him at all.
Opening the heavy door to the infirmary, they entered silently. No words were exchanged between the boys as Harry showed him towards the only occupied bed. The moment they had gotten close enough, Blaise uttered a strangled sob as he witnessed the painful sight of the man he loved, literally breaking apart. Harry was happily surprised as Zabini ignored their head of house and quickly yet gently grabbed the cracking pale hand in his.
The pale hand however, froze midair as Harry slapped away from him. Draco hissed in pain. Harry’s own hand was actually stinging as well, but he ignored it.
Sitting down on the offered chair, Harry -as gently as possible- grabbed the other hand lying on top of the sheets.
The spider, while intimidated, set out an angry screech of clicking sounds, extending the salivating white fangs. Aodhan refused to move and simply set out his own roar to keep the animal at bay. Spreading the massive wings, Aodhan stood solidly on the ground while the smaller gushes of wind ruffled the spider’s hairy legs. The beast chose to continue its way towards them in spite of the wind and now apparently the mighty dragon had had enough. Moving slightly over Harry, the dragon pulled in so much air, Harry feared for a second, its chest would crush him.
“Oh, okay.” Ron gave a rather awkward smile, but nonetheless a smile. Smiling back at him, Ron left the room with an unopened inkbottle. Things would certainly take its time, but perhaps being apart for a few weeks would be best for all of them. Even though Ron was his first- and for many years – best friend, Harry had to acknowledge they were growing older. He couldn’t expect him, Ron and Hermione to remain close for the rest of their lives. Hopefully, they would always remain friends but for now he would stick to hanging out with Seamus and Dean.
“I told you not to approach me anymore.” it was such a rare sight to see Blaise Zabini yelling. It almost made Draco feel scared. The unknown teen just gave a dishevelled smile and dragged his fingers through his tousled brown hair. Except for the hair colour, it resembled quite a lot to Potter’s. As he removed his hair from his face, Draco realized the boy had two different coloured eyes. The left was almost unnatural deep blue whilst the right was the same hazel brown as Blaise’s eyes.
Now only two presents were left on his bed and one of them could only be a book. The book-shaped one was from Pansy. Unwrapping it he almost threw it across the room but then he actually started laughing. In giant golden block letters across an awful pink cover was written ‘The 101 wedding plans before the magical day’. Snorting he gentle threw it onto the pile of other presents before reaching for the last one. The lumpy package was wrapped rather shabbily. He turned it over a few times looking for a name or a greeting card but nothing showed any indication of the sender. Shrugging to himself, he opened the wrinkled paper.
A few compartments further up, a group of Slytherins sat. Here in between sat a blond boy looking smug as ever. Of course, this was a fair amount of façade but having been raised in a strong-opinioned family he had to be composed, to be known in charge. The truth was the Malfoys were far from it. At pure luck, his father had escaped life sentence at Azkaban. Lucius Malfoy had gotten his wand under limitation control and was only allowed to perform second-year magic spells and such. Furthermore, he wasn’t allowed to leave England without a passing control from the Ministry and any new place or building he spend a certain amount of time at, had to be reported to the Ministry. His mother had managed to escape the sentence all together. Because her involvement in the war had never been particular and there wasn’t any evidence to suggest such, she had been free to go after a huge amount of money donated to the Ministry’s charity raiser.  Now his father was trying to set up a new head business in his department while his mother focused on their social life and reputation. Draco himself, had the shortest trial of all. While he had taken the mark, ‘of free will’ the fact remained that he was underage and had in fact, not committed any atrocities. No murder, torture or dark magic had left his wand.
Harry was sitting outside the infirmary, alone, waiting on any kind of news update. After Jason had fainted, Remus had quickly firecalled Madam Pomphrey and Professor Snape. While Harry was eager to help, he had no idea how and tried to stay out of the way, as they moved his friend through the hallways. Harry had to come inside and finish his exam before he could visit Jason in the infirmary. The exam had been plagued with worry, but Harry had managed to get an E and he was fine with that.
Harry just stared at him while Jason explained his relationship. Even though they were almost the same age, this was the reason Jason sometimes seemed so much older, wiser. Harry believed that like himself, the Slytherin had been forced to grow up faster than normality. The larger part of their fellow students had no idea what it felt like to lose someone so close to you. Many thought it was the same as losing an uncle or grandmother, but it was nothing like that. Losing a parent changed you forever. Not everyone would see the change but it came in a smashing desperate feeling of loss and abandonment.
Stretching his neck, Harry looked into the goblet where he realized the content of the batch. It was the same muddy potion, Remus had been drinking every month for the past many years. The wolfsbane potion looked as it always had and Harry wasn’t surer why Jason would believe this could be a present since Professor Snape brewed it every month. On the other hand, it was very nice of him to brew it even though the two men had had their difficulties.
“Merlin’s lumpy underpants!” Harry laughed as the Veela honestly jumped into the air. Sitting down gently, so as not to create even more disturbance, Jason held a hand over his heart in a theatrical sense.
Jason had barely turned, before a giant smile broke out, reaching from one ear to the other. Harry could clearly see the emotions he held for the other boy in front of them. Jason’s eyes shone with happiness and with what he assumed was love.
“Well, Professor Flitwick has allowed me to follow the seventh year curriculum with the rest of the Ravenclaws, since I have already gathered more than enough points for my own.”
Snape obliviously knew he was perfectly aware of the issue but instead of calling him out on the lie, the professor made the Slytherin choice and left Draco to dig himself even deeper. But the blond knew he had no proof, so if he could just hang on to the lie for next few minutes, he would be off the hook.
“Aodhan is grown enough to take care of himself now, Hagrid, we both know he is.” Dumbledore calmly reminded him. The giant dried his tears but his red eyes puffed out like golf balls.  Harry couldn’t believe it. He knew that Aodhan would have to go, but so soon? He had barely grown considering how big the peruvian vippertooths’ usually were. How far away would he have to go? Dreading the answer, Harry didn’t protest any further but already felt the need to grief his friend’s departure. Aodhan had become such a big part of him, even though they hadn’t really spent that much time together or had known each that long, Harry had watched him grow from a puppy sized runt to the giant elephant chasing birds. He had watched him hatch, for Merlin sake! And now he was never going to see him again.
Snape lifted a single hand to stop his questioning. The rest of the trip continued in complete silence.
Harry knew that if he tried to move it would spit acid web towards or worse; simply attack and start eating. Never moving his gaze from the long fangs, he carefully tried to move his hand towards his pocket. The clicking sounds of the mouth continued louder, making the hair on his neck rise. The second he felt a good grip around his wand he pulled it out and shouted;
“Hey,” Harry had barely gotten to say hello before Aodhan hurried towards him, butting his head so hard against his stomach he almost fell back. Smiling he hugged the giant around his warm neck.  “Don’t you dare, he would never hurt Harry!”  Hearing Hagrid protesting voice booming, he turned his head to see four people holding their wands ready as they watched Aodhan lick his face and shoulders. Harry appreciated how many of his friends were ready to protect him, but he knew it was unnecessary. As Hagrid said, Aodhan would never hurt him and he was sure of it. Although Harry couldn’t help the warm feeling spreading inside his chest as he watched the alarmed yet determined face on his boyfriend, ready to defend him.
The first night at Hogwarts was always the worst. Draco spent so much time turning, trying to find just a slightly comfortable position in the tiny single bed in their dorm. Next to his king sized bed at home filled with pillows made of peacock feathers, the bed at Hogwarts felt like a bale of hay. Therefor, waking up the first morning was never a good morning for Draco. Silently walking into the huge bathroom, he turned the knobs and entered the warm spray of water.
“Harry?” Ron got up from his seat as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Are you coming?”
“I should get going, I have to go all the way up to the tower for Divination.” Waving goodbye, Harry turned and tried his hardest to pull his facemuscles into a natural looking façade, instead of that ridiculously happy smile he knew was covering it.
“Amusing way of showing interest in speaking by ignoring the subject all together.” Snape couldn’t help the smidgen of anger in his voice. He tried to calm himself by breathing in deeply. He refused to humiliate himself in front of the wolf.
“Hey! I’m trying, okay?” Ron grumbled. Harry took a deep cleansing breath. Why did he and Ron always seem to get on the wrong side of each other lately? It couldn’t just be about Draco. It was as if, no matter what Ron said or commented, just drove him crazily annoyed. Everything struck a nerve somehow. Maybe they were just outgrowing each other. Ron had been his first real friend and he would always care deeply for him and the Weasleys’, but they were getting older and things didn’t seem so simple anymore.
“It is a black Marone suit with silver cuffs. The tie is black but can certainly be uplifted by a different color.” he showed it off.
He nodded and finally had a chance to see whom this new guy was. The tanned skin looked sunkissed as if he had just come home from a long vacation. Toned, but not overly muscled the boy stood taller than him, almost as tall as professor Snape. His thick brown curly hair reached his shoulders, covered a side of his forehead and a part of his right eye. Just by looking, he seemed at bit over the ordinary student but nothing you would notice enough to turn your head after him on an open street. Although one characteristic was rather out of the mundane. Being so much shorter than others, Harry could see his left eye rather clearly and he noticed right away how different it was. As the left eye was a deep sea blue, the other was darker hazelnut.
“Easy Potter, breath. It wasn’t how I wanted it either, but it’s done now so we might as well use it to our advances.”
“I swear, Harry, I have never heard anyone speak of this. Malfoy had never really seemed to be a considerate person, but I didn’t want to say anything. Didn’t want to make something weird between us…”
Getting a fresh towel from the cabinet, he trudged barefoot into the shared bathroom. Standing in front of the mirror, he could truly see how tired he was and quickly brushed his teeth while he still remembered it. Spitting out the last of the toothpaste and turned on the shower. Letting it run until the warm water arrived, Harry took off his clothes and left it on the shelf, hanging his towel beside it as well. Seeing the glass frame starting to fog, He stepped in under the showerhead at let the water run over his face and body. Using his natural- scentless shampoo he closed his eyes and leaned back to enjoy. Before rinsing, he soaped in his body and couldn’t help give a little extra attention to his nipples.
While it was fun seeing Potter make an ass of himself, Draco didn’t want to ruin the big step forward their relationship had taken. Leaning in to kiss him, he silenced the dumbass.
“You were wrong?! Are seriously even listening to yourself? Were the hell is the proud pureblood whom I lived with?!”
Right now, everything was frightfully quiet. Harry wasn’t sure how long it had been since he sat down on the uncomfortable chair and the giant door to the infirmary had shut close. It was long enough for his ass to lose any kind of sensitivity. He was incredibly worried for his friend. No matter what Jason was suffering from, Harry had a suspicion it was connected to his refusal to be around Zabini.
Harry tried to relax again, and finally the strong head came through. It was quite painful compared to the fingers. He bit his lips, hoping to keep the whimpers inside, but Draco must have felt the tension roaring through his body, because he gently started stroking Harry’s waist and shushed him.
“Don’t know. There was no sign or clue of Snape having stayed with my father in Australia. The only reason I found out who he was, is because the aurors’ team collected everything for me, including my family’s old tapestry of birthing records. Over my name stood my parents’ names and Snape’s was the only one who hadn’t been stretched out.”  Jason explained.
Ron certainly would feel betrayed that he hadnt told him about Aodhan. Hermione would simply scold him, making him feel worse than before…  But Draco knew the world wasn’t black and white. Surely, he would understand…  Harry wasn’t sure how long he sat there on the uncomfortable bench, hoping to hear anything coming from the office.  At last, the door was opened and Professor McGonnagall peered out.
Severus confused glance must somehow have been enough to decide. Suddenly Lauris reached around the bar and grabbed a bottle of wine.
Still holding a hand on the dragon’s back, the pair slowly walked back to the edge of the forest. As the trees around them became noticeably smaller, Harry was finally able to see Hagrid’s hut. A small puff of smoke was making its way through the chimney, indicating Hagrid’s return. Quickly the pair smuggled back inside where Harry told Hagrid the slightly scary incident. Hagrid’s eyebrows flicked up in wonder and down in a frown as Harry told his story. When he finished, Hagrid looked less than pleased.
The wolf was gladly surprised when he got a discreet leather band ‘For his especially rough after-transformation days.’
“Harry?” Hermione voiced called from the first floor. The boy-who-lived quickly pocketed the small package and hurried down stairs. His male friends all stood with bags of various items, while Hermione looked rather annoyed.
He moaned. “Please, don’t stop!” he jammed his nails into Draco’s back and the blonde hissed in pain. But to Harry’s surprise, his boyfriend seemed to like it, because his thrusts increased. Draco’s noises almost sounded feral as he grunted into his ear.
“Oh, yeah.” Hannah got an almost worried look on her face. Typical Hufflepuff, getting worried on others behalf. A very nice trait if you asked Harry. “Well, you see, we were in Herbology with the Slytherins and… I stood to far away to see why, but suddenly there was a
“What do you think?” He said showing off the darkened gloves on his hands. The scaly leather moved as he stretched and fisted his hands.
Done eating, the two friends left the great hall. Harry really didn’t wish to the spend the last hour wrapping presents but Seamus was his friend and he was right, Harry didn’t really have anything better to do. Well, he did want to find Draco and wish him a merry Christmas before he left. Even though he was still mad at him, he didn’t want to spend Christmas wondering if Draco was still his boyfriend or not.
Simply lying there, Harry listened to his lover’s heart drumming in his ear and before he realized it, he had closed his eyes and had fallen asleep.
“So Harry, was there a reason for you to come down here in such a dreadful weather?” he wondered, pouring them both a cup of black tea.
Neither seemed to know what to say. Severus had never actually escorted a date back to their house. Should he just say goodnight and leave? Kiss him first?
“I could!” Harry tried to defend himself as Malfoy started to seriously laugh. “What do you think I did for the past six years?”
“Not a chance, Potter. I can accept the idea of you dating one, but no way am I spending any of my free time on Slytherins!” Ron opined dramatically.  Looking for help from Dean and Seamus, he felt rather betrayed when they grimaced.
Quickly, he felt his body reacted and his cock started twitching against the warm water. Keeping one hand on his nipple, his other hand teasingly started playing with his smaller head. Gasping as he pulled back the foreskin and twisted his hand around. Leaning his forehead against the cold stone wall, he closed his eyes. Different images erupted and the tan boy from Ravenclaw sat in front of him on his knees. He sinfully sat all innocent before him and slowly darted his tongue forward, licking his head as if he were a kitten. Gasping, Harry pinched his nipple a little harder, as the fantasy was replaced by a paler hand from behind. Running teasingly over his body, the hand mapped out his toned muscles, moving down his abs and it suddenly grabbed his cock. Hollowly, Harry pushed into his hand and speed up. So close. His other hand went to his mouth and he pushed a finger into it. Pushing it back and fourth he imagined Malfoy’s finger in his mouth teasingly running his tongue all over it, getting it good and wet. So close.
it, I just…” Harry thought long. “I just don’t want someone to only be there for me when everything is good. Money wise.”
He waited until he could no longer hear the potion Professor and then slid out. Making sure Snape wasn’t going to jump out from somewhere and surprise him, Harry continued outside. The sun had lowered over the land and was shining its last rays of the day. Harry jumped a few times trying to catch up with Remus. What if he had already apparated? Hurrying even faster, Harry ran the last way to the Quidditch pitch, almost running straight into it, but the gates were securely locked.
Glancing over his house’s table, he regathered the last few days’ commotion. It was obvious how many of the Slytherin students had been pulled out of school since the dark lord’s decline. However many wished it the same, the difference in general quantity between the houses was noticeable. His house had always been the least likable of the four. Always regarded as the ruthless, evil and scheming. Severus had worked most of his adult life as a teacher and head of house to change this into respect. Slytherins were proud and cunning creatures, but finding just the right angle, they were also decisive and loyal. The friendships amongst the students were almost impossible to lose again if you showed how to be a valuable friend. Many thought it rude or even snobbish to choose your friends based on their value, connection and wits, but when everyone else felt obligated to sneer in disdain at the mention of Slytherin, then who else was there to turn to? Severus was a potion master of first degree, had studied and taught potion in two different countries and had even been recognized for his invention of the improved wolfsbane potion. And yet when he was looking for a job he was blindly rejected as soon as they remembered him from school. Even if he had never even met them in person. Five different companies, stores and private potion makers had rejected him without even looking at his overqualified resumé. He wasn’t sure Dumbledore had ever hired him as a teacher if it hadn’t been for a cover as a spy.
Thankfully, no one brought up the shower ‘incident’ again, but was staidly focused on Christmas. People looked ready to leave and get home to their families. Dean and Ron started discussing, very loudly, what the best present this year could possibly be and Harry used the distraction to seek out the blond boy from Slytherin. But before he could even begin to look across the room, a barn owl landed beside him. It stretched out a long leg where a small note wrapped around it.
Hagrid started to break a few of the fallen beams. “The poor thing got a cold and his sneezing seemed to increase. In the end, I imagine he must have started sneezing real fire. I wasn’t here when it happened. ‘should have known not to leave him alone…”
“Yes, please, say it louder.” Harry mumbled. A big slap on the back almost tipped him over on the staircase.
Looking at Lupin, Severs hoped for his expression to make Lupin rethink the very dangerous topic of conversation he had chosen. Unfortunately, Lupin had been used to his glares since childhood and they had obviously lost their touch.
“I was so angry at you for so long.” He shook. “I wondered for weeks why you hadn’t contacted me and why I didn’t even know where you were. I really felt like you were the only person whom could possibly understand how I felt about Sirius, and you were gone. I miss him.”
While Harry hated when people were sticking their nose in others business, Jason was his friend and helping his friends was always a good idea. Especially if they didn’t get punished by their Potion professor while doing it. Yes, the veela and his very stubborn father simply needed some help.
“Of all the thoughtless and reckless ideas you have had over the years, this has by far been the most idiotic.” Then the blackcloaked man stormed back into the office, slamming the door behind him. Harry stomach churned. Hagrid was in trouble but so was he. Harry should never have promised to help Hagrid with Aodhan. He should have remembered how many times the giant had brought him, his friends and himself in danger by giving a creature too much humanizing. No matter how badly Harry wanted to defend his fourlegged friend he had to remember Aodhan was a wild creature and the larger he got, the more danger he brought along.  What was to happen to him? Would he finally be expelled? Would Hagrid be fired? What would happen to Aodhan?  God, Harry wished he wasn’t sitting out here alone. Right now, of all the people he wished was with him, Draco was the only candidate that probably wouldn’t yell at him.
They walked outside to meet at the gate where the rest of Hogwarts were standing, chatting. The third years all seemed thrilled and Professor Trelawney nervously shushed them in order to count them. Personally, Jason wasn’t a very big fan of the Professor. He had always believed it to be a waste of time, searching for the future and the truth, in half drunken cups of tea and oversized marbles. Perhaps his dislike for the subject stemmed from the uncertainty and mystery of his tiny family. Did he hope for a future in which his love for Blaise and his relationship with his father would blossomed? Of course. But did it magically appear if he stared at a crystal ball long enough? No. It would happen, if he worked hard enough and put in the effort and time for it to transpire. People who believed it was faith that they failed their exams were simply foolish enough not to take responsibility for their own laziness.
“Well, it says so on the back.” Seamus released the light and it immediately flew straight at his boyfriend whom was colored in a bright pink light.
“Nothing.” Shaking his head dismissively. “Just sitting up there, you kind of look like an elf on the shelf.”
Speaking of relationships, he and Malfoy had made progress and were most of the time able to keep the conversations free of Voldemort-related topics. Of course, it also meant Harry constantly had to be careful before opening his mouth but for now it wasn’t too difficult.
“Like this.” Malfoy suddenly grabbed his arm and pulled it out from his pocket. The cold hit him hard and before he could demand him to let go, Malfoy had taken his hand in his. Warmth shot through his hand and left him tingling as though he had been sleeping on his hand and now blood was rushing back to it. Letting the joined hands fall between them, Harry smiled shyly at the taller teen. The rest of the walk to the little town was spend discussing the recent Quidditch match between Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Slytherin had actually won but hadn’t caught the snitch. This was rather unusual since it was practically the snitch that ruled the end of the game.
Barely able to breath, Harry wished it would never end. His whole body shivered as he neared completion. The roaring fire in his stomach continued and started centering in his abdomen.
Smiling Jason shrugged. “It isn’t really fair to compare. My instinct told me from the second we met that I loved him more than I possibly could anyone else. It didn’t matter what he liked or disliked it wouldn’t really matter. The universe – or whatever you believe in – brought us together. Meaning our morals, need and personalities would match like two puzzle pieces. But I can feel underneath that I truly would love Blaise now even without the Veela. It’s… hard to explain but I can sense the difference between ‘me’ the veela and just ‘me’.”
After only a few minutes, his thoughts started drifting. Looking aside in boredom he noticed Blaise was doodling. Beside his notes, he drew a small man from the side, one hand in the air, another holding something by the hip. Another doodle was drawn beside it and Draco couldn’t help the snort leaving him as he realized it was two guys dancing together. Hearing the snort, Blaise quickly hid the note underneath the rest of his parchments and turned a rather deadly glare his direction.
“What the actual hell, Malfoy?!” Her tone reached a completely new level of high-pitched noise; in fact, Goyle had to scratch his ear afterwards.
A nervous but wonderful anticipation settled over him as the blond started unbuttoning his tie and shirt. Not wanting to feel left out, Harry began toying with Draco’s robes as well. Realizing Harry wanted to go further, Draco pushed up again and continued to kiss him, this time with much more vigor.
Besides, he was pretty sure that Dean was coming to drag him out of the house – since he ditched on the boys, last Friday. Hopefully, he could sneak out of drinking his face off, manage to spend his Saturday being productive and not having to walk around with a major hangover at the same time.
It was rather amusing to see how tired Potter was because of their nightly wandering. It had certainly been a pleasant one. Draco knew he wouldn’t expect the boy to be easy or into one night stand but Merlin, the boy was a prude. Draco had truly tried to be patient with him and he knew that f he tried to pressure Potter too much the relationship would end as fast as it began. Draco wasn’t used to go this long without having sex and his morning shower was becoming longer and longer each morning.
Hermione huffed. “Mmh and that is why he is currently holding your hand, to show off your… friendship?” Harry knew he was blushing as he was laying down and could actually feel the blood rushing to his head quicker than it already was.
The annoying disruption continued to be a distraction through charms and Blaise barely got anything done. As soon as the bell rung, Blaise collected his things. Thankfully they wouldn’t have to see the Gryffindors for the rest of the day and even had a free period until the Hufflepuff were ready for Care of Magical Creatures.
“Oh, oh. What’s wrong?” he stepped to the side, resurging they wouldn’t get trampled by hungry students.
Okay, now he was getting worried. How could the boy not have heard him, Harry was sitting right next to him. Not wanting to spook him, Harry poked him in the shoulder with his pencil, carefully. Even though he had been careful, Jason was still startled at the contact.
Moving his hands down, he brought a bit a soap from his thighs up and started circling his crack. He imagined the way Draco would look while teasing him. Would he talk to him, smirk at him? Harry loved the idea of Draco being just as taken by the mood as he teased him.
“You know what?” Draco showed him that annoying smirk that usually indicated he had an idea. “Take mine. The ones for the Slytherins are thicker since we have to use them in the dungeon.” He said, pulling off his top layer. His shirt underneath rose up slightly, revealing his stomach. Although they had made out many times before and had touched each other overall, Harry had never actually seen Draco’s stomach. It was as annoyingly, yet wonderfully perfect as he had imagined. His skin was as pale as the rest of his body. It was a bit more flat than Harry’s but Harry muscles was rather toned after playing Quidditch all these years. Draco’s wasn’t very toned but enough to see the two lower muscles.
“It’s not so big but it is a great place considering the rent and distance from the shop.” Lauris slipped off his shoes and Severus followed his behavior. Lauris showed him the small kitchen, where he couldn’t imagine being able to cook anything without hitting his head on the cabinets.
“Uh, such a gentleman.” Lauris teased but Severus could see the slightly colored cheeks even in this light. With his left hand, he grabbed his and they made their way towards the muggle’s home. They walked in comfortable silence, enjoying the warm evening and the sounds of the streets. Children running around laughing as their parents sat talking at the restaurant. Immigrants selling nicks, jewelry and paintings from homemade stalls.
“I have only tasted these Jaffa Cakes once on my last trip to London by muggle train. They were truly delightful, my boy. Have you ever had any?”
So many things had been left unsaid, questions unanswered. Besides leading his best friend to her death, leaving without saying goodbye was the biggest regret of Severus’ life.
“Please.” The blond boy sniffed. “I refuse to play along your childish manner. Besides-“ he took out his wand. “That’s what magic is for.”
“Oh, one of your Slytherins, Pansy Parkinson, asked him to dance.” Harry tried to spot the teen in the crowd.
“You were a subject in our bet… a coincidence waiting to happen. Since the first day, we simply waited for the moment where Draco would either win or lose.”
“Nothing, it…” Harry tried again. “I guess I needed to say it to someone else. Someone who I know won’t believe in all the other rumors.”
Tumbling through the masses, he tried to protect the gift from too much damage as he ran outside. He ran around and passed so many students while he constantly searched for the blond head in between them. His lungs felt on the edge to collapse but somehow he found himself staring at the train station where the giant metal was still puffing smoke. Searching, he couldn’t see Draco anywhere but maybe some of his friends had seen him. Frantically looking around he finally saw a familiar head poking up between multiple of black robes. Jason was thankfully so tall it was impossible to miss him. He squeezed through people and apologized a few times, as he caught up with the Aussie.
“No, just wanted… to feel you completely.” He panted and gave a sweaty smile. A relieved chuckle escaped the pale lips as Draco crawled across the bed to lie on top of his lover. Both looked down as they watched their bodies connect once more. Moaning now seemed more out of amazement than pleasure. As Draco laid down on his arms on each side of Harry’s body, the smaller Gryffindor grabbed him by his broad shoulders and held on. He felt every movement in the muscled back and the shivers each time Draco gasped. Harry wasn’t sure what was possible the best part about this experience; the lustful silver eyes locked in his, the way Draco’s toned stomach pressed against- and stroked his cock, or possibly the way they stole eachothers’ oxygen every time they kissed.
“I was a little worried, but Jason is cool, so I’m thinking he knows his friends well enough. I’m sure it will be fine.” He shrugged. “As long as everyone remember it’s
Harry waited patiently for Hagrid to get back on track. Thankfully, the man caught himself before going into the whole deal with flightless birds in general. Taking a big slurp of his tea, he sighed deeply.
Knott and Harry followed, and they walked in silence. Feeling somewhat off, he thought back to how hard Draco had been trying to become acquainted with his friends and he should have the courtesy to do the same.
“But if the date goes well, then they should probably get used to seeing me.” Malfoy smirked and leaned in. Gentle he kissed Harry on the lips and they molted together. Again, electricity went straight through him and Harry unintentionally lifted his body to get closer. He could feel Malfoy chuckling into his mouth and he leaned further in to deepen the kiss. It was getting harder to breath and heat was heading south.
When the meeting finished, his friends gathered around him, taunting him for receiving the letter, trying to deceive him into sharing whatever the message withheld. But Severus wasn’t that stupid that he wished to share anything. He was on the verge to lash out when Lucius told them to leave him alone.
Sighing, the dark boy asked Jason to leave them alone for a while, and the tall man closed the door behind him without saying a word to Draco. He was more than sure the man still hated him for breaking things off with Harry. It would be so much fun hanging out with him and Blaise for the rest of his life.
“Yes, some jasmine tea with milk and sugar on the side. Oh, and ideally some Jaffa Cakes, please.” Albus delightfully asked.
Being the golden boy could be so life-depriving, especially when folks around you expected you to excel in anything you tried, but this class was the one thing Harry truly felt justified being praised on. He could possibly feel his wand buzzing with magic as he held it beneath the desk. Professor Bjorkfire was slowly walking amongst the students, teaching. As he finished telling them of today’s lesson, he waved a wrinkled hand and wandlessly moved the furniture up against the stone walls.
But before long, the bird had shed a quite amount and Jason’s face was dripping too with the unused tears. Finally the bird moved and flew back to his master and friend. Blaise was about to ask why he left before looking closer at Jason’s face.
Harry was too tired to pick a fight this early in the morning. Placing a comforting yet lightly-pushing hand on his friend’s back, Harry whispered; “Let it go.” Ron continued to grumble but walked into the classroom. In silent protest, Ron picked their seats in the front of the class, so as to “be as far away from the Slytherins as possible.” Harry couldn’t deal with him right now and simply plopped down in a random seat. Starting the class, Professor Flitwick began explaining the new theory concerning elementary spells such as ‘Depulso’ in different environments. Harry had barely begun taking notes before a minor headache started pounding on the back of his skull. Trying to discreetly massaging it away, Harry tried to concentrate on the lecture. When it finally became time to practice, the headache was more or less gone.
"I thought it was something else," Draco defended himself. "Besides, whether you wanted it or not, you grabbed me, Harry. You know you did."
"Oh, yeah, right. Because jobs appear out of thin air," Ron said with sarcasm. "Besides, how can you be so sure that Draco would want to teach there? How do you know that he’ll be accepted there? He’ll resent you, Harry."
But not tonight. Tonight I wanted to join the stars. I wanted to forget about everything and focus only on Harry and the pleasure he could give me, even though I knew it was all an illusion.
“And I can teach my cute little nephew how to stop saying wanna and gonna,” Sirius said. “Honestly, Harry, what are you teaching him? Shouldn’t he be in school already? You and Draco are terrible teachers!”
“Ron will appreciate your company, Harry,” Hermione said, “and you can take care of him for me. He’s the one with a temper, you know?”
“Whatever. Just take Nathan away again, Harry. I’ll do my best to solve this situation once and for all. He’s such a great kid. My father doesn’t think that someone will try to get him but it’s better not to play around with our luck.”
"I did not! And if I did, it wasn’t on purpose." All of a sudden, Draco was the one that burst out laughing. "Oh, my God! We both thought we were sleeping and we weren’t! And we both enjoyed it all the way. You thought you were taking advantage of me as well, didn’t you?"
“But appearances can be deceiving, Potter,” I said with a smirk. “I thank you for worrying about me, but..."
"When you kissed me I didn’t even think about pushing you away. I was… enjoying it…" Harry finished, his face slightly reddened.
"Saulus is at the top, not me. Well, depends on the point of view, of course," Lucius smiled mischievously. "He likes me on top."
“It doesn’t matter. Tonight there will be only us - two strangers knowing each other for the very first time - without names. Our bodies will move for themselves, our lips will touch and we’ll lose our wills because all that matters is this moment. No names.”
“I am.” Laughing, the couple moved very simplistic around the room, only shifting whenever another couple came to close for comfort.
The blond boy barely managed to turn before a fist landed on his cheek. Malfoy flew backwards and landed against the window ceil where he barely succeeded to uphold himself. The girls around them screamed as Ron took another swing at the blond.
Remus quickly apologized, as he hadn’t expected this turn of events, he had only bought a present for Harry. Jason gave him a breathtaking smile before waving his hand disregarding.
The three boys known as Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan and Neville Longbottom all came through and launched themselves in the red seats.
Professor Snape still didn’t seemed convinced but his shoulders slightly relaxed. Unless you knew him well, you wouldn’t have noticed at all, but thankfully Draco had known him since birth and Snape’s tense demeanor was always the same, for instance when his father asked him a favor.
“He isn’t yours.” Harry mumbled as he crushed the paper between his hands. He had no reason to be jealous. He had told Malfoy to stay away from him and he had complied. Never once had he tried to find Harry at Hogwarts or afterwards. Not once….
“Anyway… according to the new rules they are enforcing, all dragons must be kept under ‘natural’ procedures. And since his mother left it in the cold ground nest…” Hagrid murmured.
“Well,” Draco grimaced. “Not so much accepted, as not outright disown me.” He joked as Potter smiled.
Understanding Dumbledore was always a riddle. He never truly said what he meant, but by what he could decipher, he knew about Malfoy and him, which was pretty obvious, since the headmaster probably read the paper. But more importantly, he approved. Unlike Mr. Malfoy.
Sitting down on his Draco’s bed, the shy Gryffindor took his hand. Draco watched him as he kept his eyes firmly attached to the floor.
Their breathing was speeding up as Malfoy looked steadily into his eyes. Neither of them moved for a while, both just getting used to being so close to one another. Malfoy moved his hands from where they had grabbed his arms and gradually moved up over his throat, slowing down to feel his pumping pulse, before gently holding his face in place. Of All the ways Harry had imagined his first kiss with another man, and of all the ways he had imagined kissing Malfoy, quickly, deeply, hungry, gentle, nothing could have prepared him for the spark of pleasure and warmth that hit him.
“I guess.” Harry dried the last of his wet spots on his cheeks. “I’m just going to miss him a lot. It was so weird how quickly he grew. You should have seen him as a cub, he was truly adorable.”
“People do stupid things when they are in love. Karen turned to dark magic at the hope of keeping her lover, even if she knew the chance of her getting hurt, was greater.”
“Silence, please!” The charm Professor ascended the mountain of books he usually stood on. “Do hurry and place your assignments- Mrs. Granger could you collect- yes, thank you.”
“Mr. Weaple? What is all this commotion? Why aren’t you going to class?” Professor Binns slowly appeared through the wall, having heard the loud voices outside his classroom. He floated a few inches of the ground watching the four students for answers.
Blaise didn’t answer, but seemed to accept his conclusion anyway. Jason only waited for the group to walk a few more meters ahead before letting Blaise move. At least so far, so he was able to walk without being bothered by their joined hands.
Was Malfoy asking him out? The butterflies just reformed and sprouted new even bigger wings. He thought Malfoy was cute, but he had never realized the feeling was mutual. He hadn’t imagined it would ever be current. Trying to keep his voice even, Harry answered quickly.
Back in Australia. We met at a museum in Sydney. I was there because of schoolwork and I saw him, sitting on a bench drawing sculptures. He didn’t notice me at all, even though I tried to walk past him twice.” Jason laughed at himself. “Finally, I got the courage to approach him, he smiled at me and that was it. I had never experienced this feeling before. It was like love at first sight. I didn’t need to know anything about him to know it was true and yet I still wanted to learn everything.”
Finally arriving home, he threw his soaking bag and sneakers on the floor. The water already dripped down and hit the pinewood floor. Dragging his feet behind him, he landed on his red wine-colored couch. He wandlessly started the coffee maker, trying to keep his mind on the sound of the old kettle.
Shrugging, Harry pretended it was nothing. “I’m not sure. It just seems like it’s more than old rivalry from their schooldays. Remus also seems different around him, more than he used to.”
“No.” Snape affirmed. “-And I don’t believe he meant for you to find out before much later, after the war. You had enough on your own mind, without having to discuss your godfather’s sexlife.” It was almost comically how they both shuddered at the thought.
You could cut the tension in there with a knife and Harry wrecked his brain trying to find a possible topic of conversation.
Harry was surprised. “Why do you say it like that? Why would Remus know-“ Harry almost felt as if he had hit a wall. Remus. Remus whom had been Sirius and James’ best friend. Remus who had been so close to his godfather after the thirteen years they had been apart. Remus whom had lived all summer with Sirius in the horrible house of Black. Lived there. Alone. For months.
“But he did.” He was interrupted. “Why didn’t he try to find another way to stay? Go into hiding or something…”
“It was.” Malfoy agreed. Harry felt as if something was happening between them. Perhaps an understanding? An agreement?
In that moment, Severus should have said so many things, explained his life of poor choices, answered all his son’s questions honestly, yet he did nothing. He only watched as Jason left for the door, before turning back to look at him a last time. Severus could remark the strong exterior he had, but his emotional eyes he had inherited from Lauris, shone through him, showing the hurt he had kept inside for so long. Before leaving, Jason simply looked at him, and whispered;
“Hey.” He pulled of the cloak, as he stood right in front of his boyfriend.  “Shit!” Draco almost jumped away from him as he appeared out of thin air.  Trying to keep from laughing, he quickly apologized for scaring him.
The gang settled for some lunch and a cup of coffee at the Three Broomsticks. The rush-hour was almost over by now and it wasn’t too difficult to find a table for all of them. Sitting in the back at one of the round tables, Harry quickly got up to place their order.  He still had a few coins left over from shopping – since the suit wasn’t as expensive as he had predicted- and he knew Ron and Neville would have trouble paying for everything. After a very nice chicken and mozzarella sandwich and a warm latte, the Gryffindors went out into the cold air once more.
“How did your father react?” Harry was suddenly worried for the image of the child whom was standing against the wrath of Mr. Malfoy.
Time went by slowly and no potions was to be brewed today, so Harry found himself drifting off thinking about his encounter with Malfoy, rather than writing notes. Shaking his head at his own immaturity, he tried to stay concentrated and began listening to the professor in earnest.
The grey clouds on the ceiling left little to the imagination of the weather outside. Harry hated the fall. It only got colder from now on and it always rained. It left you with a longing for the winter snow, which would first come in months and a dreaded sense of saying goodbye to warm sunny days and late light evenings. As Harry continued to play with his porridge, he spectated over the last few days. Malfoy and he had spent last night outside, getting to know each other. It actually hadn’t been as awkward as he had imagined.
“It’s okay.” Draco took one of his hand and led it to his shoulder. “We will just be swaying gently, if you are so afraid of stepping on my toes.” He smirked.
“No.” Harry had to skip a few times to keep up. “When you spent most of your childhood being invisible, having people fall at your feet is rather…. Embarrassing.”
Even under the warm glove, Harry could feel the smooth shell pushed against him. The globe was almost too perfect to be of natural causes, Harry awed. Gently, he moved it over and almost pulled back in shock as he felt the weight shifting inside the egg. Slowly he moved his hands. In the last second though, he gasped.
Thank you so much for the reviews and kudos! it is so wierd how happy it makes me every single time i see a new one popping up.
Harry almost walked right into Snape’s back at the staircase. As the staircase began to move, Snape took his sweet time to answer.
“Just as I said, my love. If you, Draco Malfoy, get someone from… Gryffindor, to sleep with you AND get them to admit they love you, then I, Pansy Parkinson, will tell my parents the marriage is off. Just like that.” Pansy cajoled him and snapped her fingers.
“I don’t know…. I imagined for years how my parents meet, how my father appeared, and I always thought there was so little to it. I guess I thought he was just a one night stand or something else unpleasant.” He grimaced. “But knowing they could actually have been happy. If he had stayed.” He sighed and rubbed his faced.
“Uh sorry there, mate! Almost didn’t see you.” Harry didn’t recognize the voice. It was deeper than his own, but reminded Harry of tower bells and summer, for some reason. The thick accent was impossible not to identify as Australian. The blurry shape of a boy became clearer as Harry got his glasses handed to him by the unknown person. As the world once again became clear, he looked up at the boy he had encountered. He was suddenly pulled to his feet and Harry had to stand on his toes for a second before gaining balance again.
Harry heart started pumping slightly faster. It was as though his brain knew where this was heading but his heart desperately hung on to the last part of her story, wishing for it to be a joke.
Harry really hoped the two boys would keep it to themselves. Seeing the two faces of his friends so excited on his behalf, he took a deep breath before barely whispering;
“Lupin. Why are you here?” he masked all sense of emotion from his voice as Lupin arrogantly stepped around him and entered his quarters.
“Not really.” Seamus said bored. Ron leaned in closer across the table as if he was about to solve a major mystery.
“Yes, he was in fact the one who told me.” Severus whispered, holding on to his cup a little too tightly.
Luna Lovegood was looking quite stunning as her tuftpoofy dress clashed colors in white, blue and oddly yellow. The airheaded girl continued to look towards the ceiling as Neville brought them over.
“Uh, pink means…” Seamus checked the box. “Love.” ‘Aww’s arose between the gang as Dean leaned in to kiss him. Soon the bouncing light was off again and this time it landed on Neville. The mood was a light green which was the aura or ‘Happy’. This continued for the remaining of the walk and somehow it made Harry feel closer to his friends as the ‘Happiness’ jumped from person to person.
Ron had apparently had the same idea as he, and obviously hadn’t expected him to continue the conversation.
The surprised look on Malfoy’s face was almost adorable, but Harry quickly contained himself from laughing, not wanting to spoil the moment or embarrass him. Finally, Malfoy controlled his expression and exclaimed his joy.
“I’ve never even been outside England before… well, besides when we travel to Hogwarts of course.” Harry tried to laugh off how sad the comment sounded.
“-therefore you simply focus on the object – in this case the Christmas ball, and picture the transferring imagine in your mind; thus.”
“Probably also thirteen if you want to exaggerate the meaning of inventing future charm spells.” Knott interfered.
Before Harry had even been able to sass the Slytherin, he found himself swept off his feet and thrown over on the bed. Huffing, he sat up.
The smaller boy had a growing blush across his cheekbones as he tipped up to meet Draco’s lips. A simple kiss warmed them both in the cold air and even though it didn’t evolve into anything other than a meet of lips, it still left them breathing deeply.
“He is a respected member of the society. Imagine, dear, the connection and allies he could gather in the right circles.” Narcissa defended.
“Harry, we are so glad you’re awake. How are you feeling?” Hermione came closer and sat down on the other side of his bed.
“Very funny.” The pale boy said sarcastically as he dusted off the invisible bacteria left behind from the plastic. Neither of them needed anything from the shop and as they left, Harry noticed Zabini and Jason walking past them across the road.
“Harry!” Dean waved to them from the left side of the dancefloor. His friends had clearly found a liking to the table partly away from the dancing couples. Harry silently waved back.
This year all he had to focus on was his robes and Draco. And most likely, keeping Draco and Ron from killing each other…
“Hey, look who I found staring at the stars on Everly Brown’s dress.” Neville smiled as he let the girl down in a chair. It took almost a minute before the Ravenclaw realized she wasn’t moving anymore. Finally her head dropped down and she noticed they weren’t alone.
“It is.” Draco poured them a small glass each, before he handed one to him. “You should see the fields in the middle of June. Maybe one day, you will.”
“Well, actually I was talking to Jason, and he was the one whom suggested it. So, it will be us against a group of his friends.” Harry answered him while chewing his chicken.
Of all the things to talk about, Harry wasn’t expecting that. His curiosity and confusion must have poured out of him because Remus gave him a saddened smile before grabbing his unoccupied hand.
The blond poured a large amount on to his fingers and swirled it around. The dark pink fluid was thankfully, not so dark it reminded him of blood. As Harry laid back and enjoyed watching his boyfriend play with the lube, the scent suddenly hit him. It smelled like raspberry sorbet. Cold and fresh.
“Since you believe you can do SO much better than me, how about we make a wager? To see if this proclamation is true.” Pansy looked at her nail, trying to sound bored. Theodore had placed his book in his lap, looking on at the passive battle between the blond boy and the cat-like girl.
Ridiculous Potter would assume something from a silly precious memory was a great way to show you cared.
For a long time, Jason didn’t speak. He didn’t even look at him. Harry waited patiently, as he expected the explanation to be of rather significant size. Unicorns usually didn’t attack humans unless they see it as an only option. The beautiful creature was quiet and kept close to its herd mostly. A sigh sounding through the empty dark room almost startled him.
“Oh, Jay, please…” the gasping mess of the teen, pushed up his hips as Jason sucked him all the way in, trying to take in as much as possible. His boyfriend was quite big, just slightly longer than his own, but also more narrow and a little curled. Even in his mouth, he felt the cock’s head point towards its owner’s stomach. Letting the moaning and gasping lead him in the right direction, he continued to suck him down until he felt the slight stubbly of shaved pubic hair hit his nose. Blaise was desperately clinging to his shoulders and couldn’t keep his hips on the ground.
It was as if time slowed down while Harry turned around. His heart began pounding, as he was barely able to continue breathing. He was desperately wishing for Dean’s outburst to be truthful but deep down he feared the mistake, that Dean had seen wrong. Finally, he had turned around completely and everything turned quiet. As if the other students had any idea how important, their old defense professor had become to him. But it was true. There he stood. A few feet away from the teen, a man, wrinkled from ages of worry and transformations were holding on to his loose-fitting coat and outdated suitcase. He looked incredibly tired but the genuine smile on his face told Harry all he needed to know for now. He had safely returned from his mission.
Potter just used his arm to remove what was left of the note, onto the floor before turning back to his book.
“Seriously Potter, if you tell me now that you have lost your mind, don’t expect me to-“ Draco’s insult fell from his lips as he watched the stonewall transform. The beautiful carved door appeared as Harry ended his walk.
“Oh, I’m sorry, did that hurt? Did it possibly hurt you as much as you hurt me? Should I kiss it to make it better? Tell you I love you? Would that make everything better?!”
As they said their ‘goodmorning’s and ‘Merry Christmas’s around, the two boys sat down in the middle of the single long table. As he poured up scrambled eggs on his plate he noticed how Jason could barely keep in his laughter. Giving him a rather curious look, Jason sent a quickened glance down the table. Turning around he observed the wondering amusement. And a sight it was.
Then the form started walking again, continuing towards the entrance gate and Blaise could barely hold in a scream at the pain erupting in his chest. Never had something hurt him this way.
Being stuck with the Dursleys all summer had kept the both of them in a cage. Harry’s more metaphorical than Hedwig’s. For almost two months, Harry had been kept busy tending the garden, cleaned the house – inside and out -, washed the car, cooking and even for two weeks having to walk his annoying aunt’s dog, Ripper. But even though Harry knew the Dursleys had had no intention of making his life easier, he had found it relieving to be kept busy. His sixth year at Hogwarts had been a horrible one of a kind.
Out of all the chaos and heartache, one thing had changed for the better. Ever since his son had lost his spark, Snape had been careful and attentive towards the teen. As if he finally grasped the concept of being there for him in the worst of times, the two had become closer. Harry was glad if not a little jealous. Yes, it was true, he had his friends, but Harry could imagine it would feel better to have a parent’s shoulder to cry on. Someone whom had experience in relationship. No matter how sappy it sounded, none of his close friends had ever really been in his situation. Hermione and Ron were still happy even though they fought all the time. Dean and Seamus was happy but did at least try to keep it civil in front of Harry as to not choke him on their happiness.
For a long moment both teens were lost in thoughts. Harry couldn’t help but feel grieving for the Malfoy child whom would have his heart broken so many times over the year by his father. Thankfully, Harry didn’t think Malfoy turned out like the Sr. and perhaps the Malfoy generation would change slowly over the course of time.
“It was rather tasty.” He refused to handle out compliments as if he had nothing better to do. Unfortunately, it was good enough for the too happy guy and he smiled appraisingly. Then he looked straight at Severus and a finger as suddenly on his cheek. The Slytherin almost flinched at the contact but withheld himself.
The first trip to Hogsmeade would be taking place that day. It also happened to be the day of Harry’s first official date with Malfoy. He tried his best to concentrate on his breakfast and on the other Gryffindors’ chatting. He weighted in a few times, but it mostly didn’t turn out to be more than a ‘hmm’ or ‘sure’. His stomach was not just filled with butterflies it felt more like a cocoon of bees buzzing and gnawing their way right through him. He didn’t want to seem too eager but he couldn’t help but look at the Slytherin table where Malfoy was also eating. He was slowly chewing a red apple while talking to his friends. It seemed so unfair how relaxed he was while Harry tried not to break out in cold sweat.
Harry’s stomach clenched at the thought of telling her the truth. He didn’t want to face Malfoy, and he certainly didn’t feel like telling Hermione she had been right from the start. Even if things had become easier between them, Harry knew Hermione wouldn’t help but gloat at the idea of being right. It was in her nature to feel smug about knowledge.
“Let’s just say; they never missed an opportunity to remind me how unwanted I was.” Harry stated with a morbid smile. There were still times were Harry felt unwanted and wished they could understand how their treatment had sculptured his life and behavior. But he kept reminding himself that in one year he would never have to go back.
“I think he’s a bit groggy from the medicine and it’s not making much sense. Oh, wait, he’s always been like that,” he said with a smirk.
He didn’t dare to look at Harry but as the silence went on and on he turned around to see what had happened and found Harry with his mouth half-opened and popeyed. Draco watched as Harry tried to make a sound but all he could hear was a mumble.
The nice and easy-going Bob was actually very evil. It was all in his eyes. Draco knew this because he had lived among the evilness for a long period of time. Seamus would have agreed with him. Bob had same the kind of deceiving look that most of Voldemort's followers had had.
I didn’t like that at all. Although Harry fascinated me, I would never forgive him if he bothered Astoria. She was, after all, my partner.
Draco smiled. "He’ll be. Right now he’s too young to even think about those things. He’s outside with Hermione. Come on." Draco headed to the door.
Another hooded person appeared throwing curses at us. My heart beat faster. Part of me wanted to panic, but the other part told me to hold on. I defended myself the best I could, mainly because even though the older boy had a wand, he didn’t seem to know what to do with it at all. Another wizard came and shouted something to the man attacking me.
Harry sighed and sat down on his side of the bed. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you the way I did. I guess I wanted you to like Bob because he helped me a lot and he's a good friend."
“Oh, just shut up!” Draco yelled back. “Your son is only five years old! Yelling at him won’t matter. And I can’t believe you said that to me. I’m not good enough to raise your son? Go to hell then! You can be such a jerk sometimes, Harry. I didn’t disappear, I left you a note. If you have no confidence in me, that’s your bloody problem.”
The train would soon be leaving. Nathan licked his lips and then turned to say goodbye to his family. He wasn’t surprised when he saw tears in Draco’s and Harry’s eyes. But he was surprised to realise that he also wanted to cry. He tried to hold back his tears the best he could because it wouldn’t look too good if he cried in front of all those boys and girls.
Draco went to the other side of the cell, staying as far away as he could from Bob. He had a terrible headache and was really confused. He felt a pang in his belly and slid to the floor, screaming in pain. Bob instantly knelt down by his side.
“And how exactly are you going to achieve that?” he snorted. “Lying on a hospital bed with an IV attached to your arm?”
He felt Harry’s hand stroking his cock as fast as he was burying himself inside him until he lost all of his balance once more and surrendered to pleasure. Harry came a few seconds later, screaming his name and dropping his seeds inside of him and over the table.
She raised an eyebrow. “I know that. But a little caution never hurt anyone. Besides, Harry will be–”
I skipped dinner and tried to sleep unsuccessfully. I should have eaten something. There was food in the fridge. But as usual, I wasn’t the least bit hungry. Imagining Harry under the sheets with a certain woman was making my stomach churn.
Alfred didn’t say anything. He got lost in his own world, probably trying to come up with a solution to his problems. Fortunately for him, his only solution was to trust Harry. He was just too young to realize just how big Harry Potter was to the wizarding world. His mind, just as mine, was filled with catastrophic predictions. But at least I knew Harry wouldn’t let us down.
“Where are we? What is this place?” asked the blond teenager with widened eyes, probably because of the size of the Manor.
“What can I say? That I can’t help it? Is that a good defence? Besides, I’m not really doing anything. I’m in my own house. What’s the problem with that?”
He took a deep breath and activated his powers. It was like a jolt hit his body, and images of very old memories and feelings flashed through his eyes.
I winked at him once more and felt something squeeze hard around my heart as I saw him disappear inside the train. I prayed for the gods to protect him. I could almost hear Astoria’s heart breaking into tiny little pieces. I wanted to hold her, but I was never the type to display affection. So I gave her my arm, and she took it. We turned to leave and my eyes found a pair of emerald-green ones staring straight at me for the second time that day.
“No problem.” Harry closed the door and led Bob to the living room. “So, what brings you here?” he asked after they were comfortably seated on the couch.
“No, I don’t think so. He had the keys and he looked really furtive. Something isn’t right, I can tell. My hunch is that you should listen to him, but don’t believe a word that he says. I don’t even think he’s Bob.”
While Jonas shook Draco’s hand enthusiastically, Draco said, “I need a favour, Jonas. I came here because you’re the only one I trust.”
The meeting between father and son was touching. The moment Nathan saw Harry entering the living room, he ran to him and his father lifted him in the air. They hugged each other tightly and Harry soon started to cry. His emotions were running wild and he couldn’t hold himself together. Nathan, seeing his father crying, started to sob and while the men in the room were staring at the scene with unshed tears, the women were crying copiously.
“I was about to exclaim ‘are you kidding me’, but knowing your father, I believe that he is in Paris and he is depressed for real,” Harry said with a smirk. “His intentions were world domination after all. He must be feeling really depressed for losing such a powerful device. That shows that we have to be careful about him.”
“I don’t think that’s his problem. I just think that it’s hard to accept that your lover was once a...”
“I’m just trying to do my job, Harry. It won’t take long. I just want to check on Nathan. He seems to be fine.” Neville sent a warm look in Nathan’s direction. “But I need to make sure. This is routine, Harry. Trust me?”
Draco shook his head and smiled bitterly. “Those men could tell us what the hell happened to Nathan. It’s so damn convenient for you that they are all dead now, and there’s no one that can really tell us what they did to Cho Chang and Nathan.”
I tried to hear any noises coming from next door. There were no sounds at all. It was as if Harry was not there anymore. I had no idea where Harry had gone after leaving me.
“Just be careful, Potter,” I said, and I left before I could make a fool of myself. Harry didn’t follow me, and I didn’t expect him to. I found Astoria, and the moment she looked at me she knew it was time to go home. We didn’t apparate. I was too weak for that. Instead, we went by flu powder. When we arrived I went straight to my room. I wanted to hide from the world, as usual, like that was even possible.
“It’s alright, Louis,” he said to the man, and then to me, “If the problem is having someone to be responsible for him, I can ask for one of the tutors of our Institution to come here.”
“Come on, Malfoy. If you don’t tell me what happened, I’ll have to summon you to testify at the Ministry, where you’ll be questioned not only by me but by several Aurors who don’t like you. It won’t be very pleasant, I’m sure you realise that.”
“But he wanted to come here. I was the one that didn’t let him. I thought you wouldn’t want to see him.”
Harry made a face. “All right then. The important thing now is to find them. Dean was very worried and I pitied him.”
“But he is ok? I mean, this is really normal, right?” She nodded and he sighed, saddened. “I won’t see him for a whole day?”
“Read properly. I wrote that we won’t be having sex with the same frequency as before. You know, for the baby’s welfare,” Harry explained kindly.
Draco, who couldn’t take his eyes off his little girl, said, “Can you believe her? I still can’t believe we created such a perfect child.” Draco stroked Hope’s chubby little fingers tenderly. “She’s so cute. I could bite her!” Harry raised an eyebrow and Draco chuckled. “You know I won’t bite her. Right? You’re so silly, Harry.”
Harry watched Saulus give orders to his men, and he couldn’t help but feel admiration for his leader posture. He had to admit that Saulus was the kind of man that exuded authority. It was, in fact, very sexy. Lucius caught Harry’s eye and smirked as if he knew exactly what Harry was thinking. Harry looked away, embarrassed.
Alfred stopped talking. He was trembling all over, and he had tears in his eyes. Even so, he was strong enough not to shed them. I pitied him, but more incredibly than that was the wave of fatherly affection that came over me. I wanted to protect him. Harry seemed to be feeling the same way, but for him, the feeling wasn’t as alien as it was for a person like me.
"I was just about to leave." Seamus tapped Draco on the shoulder. "I’ll call you, Drake. I have a journal about my days as a Death Eater, so perhaps I can find the spell in its pages. I’ll have a look at it. Bye, Harry! Oh, by the way, your son is so adorable! I’m really happy for you. Bye, Nathan!" Seamus winked at Nathan and left the office.
Draco had some ideas about it, but he didn’t want to say them in front of Nathan. He didn’t want to scare the child, but his fears were that maybe Nathan had been taken away in the past for a much darker reason.
To use Nathan, they’d had to destroy Voldemort, which Harry did for them. But in the end, the whole plan had been jeopardised by the members’ individual ambitions.
Hearing news from Scorpius made me finally leave my room and face the world outside. I went back to walking with my dogs and being followed around by Angel. Alfred was behaving so well I began to suspect that he was planning something.
Harry looked at him in a naughty sort of way. “Why, Draco, I didn’t know you were up for a threesome.”
Nathan then walked towards Draco and placed his little hands on Draco’s belly. Draco and Harry held their breaths in anticipation. Nathan was so serious that it scared Harry. It was as if Toledo was back again.
Draco had explained to Harry his reasons for abandoning the wizarding world a week after they had started going out. It hadn’t been easy for Draco. The memories were still painfully disturbing to his soul. Eventually he had been able to explain that he had seen way too much injustice and evilness for a lifetime. The torture rituals still haunted his nights, and from time to time he woke up screaming, soaked in cold sweat. However, ever since Harry had come into his life, the nightmares had almost completely vanished.
‘You can’t make me, Potter. I’m an adult. I’m not a fucking child!’ Although I wanted to make myself look fierce, I’m sad to say I coughed at the end of the speech and just looked feeble and pathetic.
“Alfred’s joined the Death Gang when his mother died, but at the time Matthew’s little group was already being slowly snared by another group of cunning wizards.”
“It all looks delicious,” Draco said. “But please tell me that hidden somewhere there’s an aspirin for my headache, too.”
Draco opened the door wearing nothing but jeans and a big smile. Hermione promptly hugged him tightly.
That made me lose my temper for good. I sent caution through the window and cast Accio to get the letter back. It flew towards me, but before I could put my hands on it, Harry got it back with a counter-spell. Spells be damned. I decided to get physical with him. It was a lousy idea, for many reasons, one of them being that Harry was stronger and healthier than me. We felt down and the house-elves got frightened. It was not difficult for Harry to subdue me. My wrists were held to the floor by his strong hands. Our bodies were now touching one another completely.
Nathan smiled at him. “I really like my new name.” He caught Harry’s hand and squeezed. “I’m happy to be your son in this life.”
That took me by surprise. Astoria hadn’t said a word about it. I grimaced. Astoria was that kind of woman. She would never break the trust of whomever it was, least of all of an innocent child's. However, I got irritated. I was her husband after all. I should be informed of what went on in my own house.
“Someone had to guard the house, Nat. Don’t worry. You’ll see him soon,” Harry said to cheer him up.
My heart thumped hard when I met his eyes. I shouldn’t be afraid of the past, but I was. I couldn’t hide the dread in my eyes for all that had happened and could happen again. I didn’t want Scorpius to have to go through what I had lived.
‘I never thought of Voldemort’s followers as human beings,’ he said, and it felt like a slap in my face.
“I’ll be your Secret Keeper. The boys can stay here,” he said at last. “But that’s it. Forget about the Book of the Dead. It doesn’t concern you. Let my Squad take care of it.”
‘Do I have to remind you that your principles were quite distorted in the past? But that is subject to another day. Why are you calling? Has something happened?’
I got near him without even realising it. I touched his bruised arm carefully and he shivered slightly. His breathing caressed my face.
Tears ran down Harry’s green eyes as the speed of their hips moving against each other increased. He was lost into a mixture of pain and delight. Finally their bodies gave in. With a deeper movement, the blond thrust inside Harry’s buttocks one more time and came crying loudly. Harry exclaimed something, his seeds spreading on them. He could not believe he had come again.
It looked like it could because a few minutes later Ron and Hermione were thrown inside the cell with them under everyone’s apprehensive eyes. Motive: they had insulted the Hit Wizard’s Chief.
"You don’t know what you’re talking about, Harry! You have Nathan to think about! How are you going to support your son? And... And... And there’s me! Have you ever thought of me!? I’m your partner! We’re great together!"
Harry found Draco’s jealousy adorable. He hugged him tightly, and Draco melted in his arms. He realised, stunned, that that was the first time he had touched Draco ever since Nathan was admitted to the hospital. He had been so worried about his son that he had barely given any attention to Draco, which he was now regretting. Once he had found out that Draco and the baby were ok, he’d immediately turned his full attention to Nathan and Draco hadn’t complained about it once. Harry tightened his arms around Draco, vowing to make up for his lack of attention. He promised himself that he would be a better father and a better husband. Everything would be fine from now on. He would make sure of that. Even if Saulus and Lucius were still plotting something, Harry wouldn’t let them ruin things for Draco, Nathan and his daughter.
Draco pouted. There he was, ready for another round, and Harry could just get up and leave. He understood, but his body was still protesting. Draco sighed, and then he smiled. He had the feeling that Harry would get up many times that night. But he didn’t mind. Draco would probably get up a few times too.
Nathan. Harry didn't say the name of his son out loud but they knew he was talking about him. Silence reigned in the room for a moment.
Draco snorted. “Nobody deserves anybody’s love. Do you think Harry deserves my love? Well, maybe he does… Even if sometimes he’s a prick. But do you really think that I, Draco Malfoy Potter, the one who made his school years miserable, deserve his love? If I got to thinking about every single reason why Harry and I weren’t supposed to be together, I would go insane. We were wrong for each other from the start. But that was what made it so right.” Draco smiled softly as the memories of the past washed over him. He felt his love for Harry increase even more. How he missed being in Harry’s arms.
Ron also stepped up; after all, he was an Auror. Harry told Draco he was going with the Weasleys, too, and chaos reigned.
“Look, let’s eat the cake, because I think Hermione is pregnant and it wouldn’t be good to get her upset,” Harry whispered against Draco’s swollen lips.
“Life is not fair. Haven’t you learned that after all these years?” Draco walked towards the door. “Give me the key.”
“I’m fine,” I repeated, getting up quickly and almost knocking Harry down in the process. I felt like running away, but I was not well at all. Harry caught me in his arms again when I stumbled.
With Harry by his side again, Draco recovered faster than anyone – including his new doctor Neville Longbottom – had expected. Within a week he felt his strength back once again and his energy level higher than ever. He owed it all to Harry. Draco had never seen Harry behaving in such a caring and careful way towards him. Sometimes it had been annoying actually. Draco wasn’t made of glass and he had let Harry know that rather nastily. Later that same day, he pleaded to Harry to forgive him, and they had spent a quiet afternoon talking silly and loving words in each other’s ear.
Harry tried to explain to Nathan what was going on and why he shouldn’t go out alone. Nat seemed to understand. Harry stayed with him long enough for him to finally fall asleep.
It was partially true. Harry, however, kept staring at me fiercely. He didn’t believe a word I said.
Once again I realised he was having fun. I cast a spell on the bastard, but it barely scratched him. Knowing that he wasn’t taking me seriously only made me angrier and I lost it. I would not give up until one of my spells hit him somehow.
I didn’t have time to celebrate the fact that my wand was pulsating in my hands. I ran to Harry thinking that he was probably fuming and that I’d definitely suffer the consequences. When I got to him, I knelt down by his side and got the surprise of a lifetime. He had a huge smile on his face.
“Mr Malfoy? Are you Mr Potter now? Is it true that you and Mr Potter are married? Harry Potter is gay? When did you meet? Has Mr Potter ever been tempted for the Dark Lord to becoming a Death Eater? Is this how you two met?” the questions went on and on, one after another, and Draco almost screamed out of frustration.
Harry was afraid of that, too, but he was in a dead-end. There was nowhere safe enough for Nathan. If only Harry had more time, he could take Nathan to Hogwarts. But he couldn’t stop thinking about Draco, and his disappearance was driving him insane. He needed to find Draco no matter what. But that didn’t mean someone else couldn’t take care of Nathan for him.
“You’re going to tell him, aren’t you?” he asked in a whisper. He didn’t resemble the same confident teenager from before at all. He was now a fragile and frightened boy. He was right to be frightened. I surely was. Not that it was anything new. I was used to living like that. Anxiety and fear were my old friends. Nevertheless, I didn’t want the boys to go through the same thing. They were so young. I didn’t want to be facing another Draco Malfoy.
Draco got out of Harry’s lap and faced him fuming. “I don’t need your permission, Harry. If I wanted to go you wouldn’t be able to stop me. I have my connections with the Unspeakables as well. This is my family, too, and in case you don’t remember, I was a Death Eater, so I guess I know a little more about them than you do! I’m not taking part in this bloody mission because of personal reasons, but you wouldn’t be able to stop me if I wanted to go! I just thought you ought to know that.”
I wasn’t surprised that Harry had gotten into my hideout so easily. He was the truly Almighty here, the Great Harry Potter. He could do anything.
“All right. But since I’ll have to put up with Weasel, I think you’ll have to make it up to me for all the stress I’ll be submitted to.”
He turned to face Hermione again and noticed that she looked like a child who had been caught doing something very wrong. Harry found it adorable. Hermione had always been terrified of doing anything remotely out of line. That fact had never stopped her from doing it though.
Harry passed his hands across his hair in desperation, mussing it in the process. Tears threatened as he struggled not to cry. It was Saturday night and there was still no sign of Draco. It was as if he had disappeared off the face of the planet. It didn’t matter that he had left a note. That bloody piece of paper only made Harry worry even more. What was Draco thinking leaving him such an ambiguous note? Didn’t he know how preoccupied Harry was?
He wasn’t lying when he said that once he had crossed Harry’s door he would never want to see him again. But that was in the heat of the moment. If Harry appeared in front of him at that exact moment and asked him for forgiveness he would punch him in the gut and only then he would forgive him.
“Of course you are, love. But not today. Today you’re my property. You belong to Draco Inc. and you are mine to satisfy me in every possible way,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear.
Harry didn’t show up the next day, but the security around the Manor increased. There were now four Aurors patrolling the grounds and watching out for any dangers. The number of protective spells also got bigger. My dogs seemed agitated, but I managed to keep them in line.
Harry looked at the paper and opened his eye wide when he saw, written with Nathan’s not so perfect handwriting, the name of a person he thought it was long dead: Lucius Malfoy.
Merlin, he was such a bastard. Why did I have to say it all? Why couldn’t he just state what he had to say about what had just happened between us? It was his entire fault after all. He had barged into my room and attacked me like a wild animal. Why couldn’t he just tell me he wanted to be here with me?
I took a deep breath and nodded. Of course, I wouldn’t be 100% well, but I would do anything to be Harry’s partner in that journey. Perhaps I could even try something that I didn’t believe much, but that muggles seem quite fond of: acupuncture. I felt chills down my spine at the thought of needles on my body.
My kids. That fact suddenly dawned on me. They were my kids now. The adoption papers had yet to be released, but the process had already started.
“Just feel the energy travelling through our bodies. That’s what our eyes are doing, Harry. The eyes are the windows of the soul. When you look at me and I look at you, we’re seeing inside our souls. We’re creating a bond so strong nothing will ever have the power to break it. Can you feel it, Harry? Can you feel the energy around us? Our energy?”
"Be realistic, Draco! Saulus is the Minister of Magic! He must be a very busy guy. You just can’t expect to go there and be admitted into his office! That’s insane. My father had to wait at least three weeks to talk to him once."
“You really need to gain some weight,” he pointed out, and before I could protest he went on, “You seem so fragile… so delicate… your skin is so soft. I feel I'm going to break you.”
Nathan lay down on his small bed inside the cupboard and closed his eyes with a sigh. One more miserable day had passed and nothing extraordinary had happened. The Dursleys were the most boring family in the world. They didn’t allow him to do anything, not even play with Dudley’s son, Peter Dursley, who was only a year younger than he was. Peter looked like he wanted to play with Nathan, but Vernon Dursley had never allowed them to play together. Nathan didn’t think there was a child in the whole world that was as miserable and unhappy as he was.
It was a statement, not a real question. Even so, I decided to answer, “Not exactly. I know Astoria cares, and maybe another half a dozen. But I don’t think they called you here because they’re actually interested in your cause as noble as it is. Remember that these wizards and witches are anything but noble...”
That did it. His reaction was immediate and so was the penetration. I felt some pain, I cannot deny it. But I was instantly taken by the intense pleasure of having Harry Potter filling me in. His green eyes shone like precious gemstones. His body was stiff from the effort of keeping control of the situation, but it was too late for that now. Both of us were lost and delirious. No amount of rationality or reality could have torn us apart, not then. His cock touched a rather sensitive spot inside of me and I cried involuntarily. Pleasure overtook any fear I could still have. I held on to him, scratched him, and made him mine. I discovered many different types of moans that night at each thrust. I clenched my ass around his shaft in sweet revenge, forcing a primitive groan as ancient as time itself from his throat.
“Did you know what Nathan called me today?” Draco said all of a sudden to lighten up the air. Harry shook his head and he went on, “He called me ‘dad’. He called me ‘dad’, Harry. You have no idea how happy I felt when I heard it.”
Harry seemed more relief after hearing that. When he left, Draco turned to Nathan and said, “Although we are out of the water, the real reason why I sent Harry away was to thank you, Nathan.”
“Are you serious? That’s it?” I interrupted him. “You appreciate my help but you want me to step back?”
Harry wondered what Draco was talking about when Dr Jules entered the room and asked Harry to wait in the corridor.
He tried to keep himself awake but soon tiredness came upon him, and he fell asleep in Harry’s arms.
“What the hell!” Harry muttered, quickly stepping before him and shutting the door. “You damaged my door, damn it!”
“Oh, yes. Lucius Malfoy is a stockholder in many wizard companies and even some muggle ones! How he got hold of them, however, is something to be fully investigated, especially the muggle ones.”
Harry leaned against the wall where Nathan was standing close by and sneered. “You talk as if you were a saint in Hogwarts, Draco, and that couldn’t be further from the truth. Draco was the devil, Nathan. He was always trying to get me in trouble.”
When Harry broke their kiss, Draco was still too lost in it to move away. He kept entangled in Harry's arms wanting more of him, more of everything.
Saulus smiled sadly. “We did, Harry, and we’re sorry. We needed a weapon against Nostrums as soon as possible, and we didn’t know whether you and Draco were thinking about having a baby, so we decided to advance things a little.”
“There’s hardly anything I don’t know, my friend,” Jonas said absently. “But I’m sorry to say that I don’t know anything about Deadly Jo. I haven’t seen him in years. He never came here again after the Dark Lord’s downfall. I can’t really blame him. This is not the kind of place for a member of the Order to hang around...”
“Seamus didn’t choose to follow that path, Harry.” And Draco explained to Harry what had really happened to Seamus.
“I’m sorry, Draco, but I have to say a few things. First of all, I believe we could get a license, even though I think you would have to pay a fine to the Wizards’ court. Second, you should consider your father’s intention. What is his purpose? Why did he make you get pregnant? You have to consider those questions. Your father might be thinking about creating another kid like Nathan,” at the mention of Nathan, Draco’s eyes went wide. He had no idea Snape knew about it. “Yes, I know about Nathan. A good friend of mine told me. Don’t worry though. I haven’t told a soul.”
“Er... Well, see Draco...” Fred started cautiously but was interrupted by the arrival of the enemies’ minions. “Can we talk later? Right now, we need to fight those guys and get the hell out of here.”
“Let’s just say it’s less... complicated. Besides, aren’t you the one who said that you are way too involved in all of this to be left out of it?”
His teeth looked for Draco’s nipples and bit them gently. Then he cupped Draco’s face and kissed him, pushing himself further and deeper, this time stimulating his nipples with his hands. Draco grabbed his buttocks and bit his lips softly. As the tip of his shaft touched Draco’s prostate, he felt delighted by the noises his lover made.
He gave his back to Harry, still hurt by his previous comments, especially about the fact that Harry didn’t think he was good enough to raise Nathan. He knew Harry had said that in the heat of the moment, but he couldn’t help but think that deep inside Harry had meant it.
Harry got closer. I thought I was going mad. Now my fear was mixed up with my desire. How would I survive such contradictory emotions? I needed to get out. I shouldn’t have called for Harry. But he was already there and he was so real. And intense. And I wanted to embrace him and never let go.
The clock struck at ten. Angel was supposed to be in bed already. I found it strange that Astoria hadn’t shown up to take him to his room.
Their lips touched slowly, almost as if it was their first time. Harry caressed Draco’s face wishing to wash all of his sadness away. He didn’t want Draco to cry ever again. Their baby wasn’t a problem but a blessing. The most beautiful gift they could ever receive.
The fact that I used his first name didn’t go unnoticed. I could see how confused and even surprised he was. The hand that touched mine disappeared. It was as if only then he had realised what he was doing. We tensed. But before I could say something, Astoria appeared.
‘Really? So I shouldn’t worry about my father getting in touch all of a sudden and speaking in codes?’
“She said Dennis Creevey is the president. I hate the Creeveys. They’ve always had a crush on you. That brother of his, Colin, he kept staring at you the whole time today. Did he have to be at our wedding?”
They hid behind a big column to avoid the next volley of hexes, and Fred went on, “George told me that Harry was the first one to get here. Hermione, Ron, George and the backup arrived a little afterwards. They saw Nostrums and Harry arguing, and nobody could meddle, for obvious reasons.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered so as not to wake Nathan. He wanted to ask Harry to go to bed, but he didn’t have the courage to. Harry was still shaken about everything that had happened, so it was normal for him to want to spend the night in Nathan’s bedroom. “Do you want me to transfigure the armchair into a bed so you can sleep comfortably?”
“Honestly, Potter!” It was outrageous. “If that was really the case, I’d have already turned him to The Almighty! I know it’s hard for you to accept that I have feelings. I like the boys! I’m a father! I love my son! Every time I look at Angel and Alfred I think about Scorpius and what kind of situation he would be in if I hadn’t made it! If I had been arrested or killed, Scorpius would be just another lost child in the hands of those bastards!”
While Harry waited for his arrival, Sirius and Remus appeared through the fireplace with a worried expression on their faces. Harry immediately realised that something was wrong with Nathan, and as Sirius explained to him that Nathan was nowhere in the Mansion, Harry almost collapsed.
“First of all, I would have said it earlier but I’d been in prison, in case you don’t remember. Second, you’d never showed any interest in me that way so I guess I was afraid of your reaction. And this was the worst timing ever to confess what I’ve been keeping for myself for all these years... I mean, Draco was here... Dammit!” Sirius cursed himself.
Harry smiled nervously. "I had a surprise planned for us. I would take you to a cabin at the lake and we would have a romantic dinner, followed by a night of wild sex. I even bought those pashmina scarves you wanted."
As if to prove otherwise, my vision went blurred and I felt myself falling. To my utter humiliation, Harry was the one to hold me in his arms. He caught me as if I was made of paper. I mumbled something not so polite, when in fact what I really wanted was to lean my head on his shoulder and rest.
The day went by very slowly and to Draco’s distress was just as unproductive. Harry sent him a letter telling him that he and Nathan had arrived safely at the cabin and that Nathan had loved it. Draco knew he would. That place was magical. Draco smiled dreamily as he remembered the night he and Harry had stayed there.
“I wouldn’t say that,” the Healer stated as he examined me. I glared at him, but the man didn’t seem to care and just laughed it off. “Don’t worry. There’s nothing a good day’s rest can’t cure. Mr Potter will have to wait a while if he wants to arrest you, though.”
“What?” Horace asked, catching their looks. “Please, don’t hide things from me. I promise whatever it is, it won’t leave this office.”
He was afraid of using magic without his wand, so he just sat on the bed, desolate. Tears ran freely down his cheeks, but he quickly wiped them away. He wouldn’t cry. He had to be strong and find a way to escape so he could warn Harry about what was going on.
“You’re wasting your time. It would be easier if you just asked me to open my mind to you. I wouldn’t refuse,” I started casually.
I sincerely hoped that my father wasn’t involved in anything illegal. Not again. Hadn’t he learned his lesson? My mother certainly had. But then again, my mother had always been more sensible than Lucius.
Harry looked at me as if he was trying to read my mind. I got the feeling he was trying to use Legilimency against me.
Hermione didn’t like the sound of that. “Shouldn’t we call the Hit Wizards to help us, Harry? Bob is not reliable. And besides, you don’t know if Lucius is responsible for Nathan’s disappearance.”
“No! Ginny may be jealous of Harry but she’s not evil! She would never do something like this!” Ron defended his little sister.
“You really are dense, aren’t you?” Draco sighed. “If this song is magical, then we can use magic here!”
Wasn’t life damn funny? My son succeeded where I had failed. He managed to gain the loyalty and friendship of a Potter. I wanted to grin, but in the current circumstances, I was in a state of shock.
“Herm,” Ron called her when they were close to the car. “I’m glad I’ve married you. You’re so wonderful and wise.  I mean, what woman wouldn’t want to rip the guts of her man if she saw him with another woman?”
“See? He needs me here,” Harry said, kissing Nathan’s hands. “I’m here, sweetie. I’m not going anywhere without you.”
“Hermione. And that nice brunette at the i-ice-cream p-parlour,” he stuttered. “They told me where to find you. Am I interrupting something?”
He easily deflected from all of them. In fact, at every spell I cast, Harry seemed to grow stronger while I was growing weaker.
I watched her go without saying anything. I called Joah, another one of our house-elves, and I asked him to take care of Alfred. The boy also needed a shower and probably food and plenty of rest. He was rather thin for someone his age. I was sure he was one of the children that would fit Harry’s charity programs perfectly.
“Oh, I’m so sorry. To be honest with you, I don’t know what to say. It sounds like a hell of a science fiction story! I still can’t believe they did that to a baby! It’s so absurd! Ron won’t believe it when we tell him.” Hermione placed her hand in her stomach protectively. “Do you think they did the same experiment with other children as well?”
“Stop it, Harry! It isn’t funny!” Draco exclaimed angrily. After a few more seconds though, he joined Harry and laughed his heart out. They had tears in their eyes when they finally stopped. Draco lay in front of Harry beaming, their lips only inches apart. “Ok. It did sound funny.”
“Why not?” He shrugged. “I guess they’re finally getting into their thick heads that we cannot shut ourselves in our own tiny world and not expect things to affect us all. These boys and girls are just kids, but they're doing a lot of damage because we’ve forgotten to look after them.” Harry’s voice was so bitter that it became clear he blamed himself for what was happening. I didn’t know why. After all, he couldn’t be responsible for everybody, let alone for what happened to the families of ex-Death Eaters. Nobody wanted them around. My own family suffered prejudice from our own kind.
“You’re my key to the Book of the Dead, Malfoy. I need you alive and kicking. Well, not really kicking... I’m sure you get what I mean.”
“Of course not. I am investigating the case after all. We suspect your grandfather ordered someone to kill Diggus, but there isn’t any proof. There’s also the fact that your grandfather didn’t set foot in Egypt before or after that. He most likely thought that what Diggus told him was not true. Diggus was only after his money, so the whole thing could have been just a big scheme to rip him off and he found out and dismissed it all.”
“Yes, you are. Sometimes I think you don’t trust me, Harry. I don’t know. Maybe you don’t love me either. You just think you do.”
“That’s not true!” Sirius objected. “I don’t care about your sexual preferences. I care if it’s Snape! I mean, even Harry agrees with me that Snape is not the right guy for anyone! Isn’t that right, Harry?”
Harry and Draco looked at it and realised that it was the same message that Draco had been analysing with Seamus that morning.
Bob frowned. “It’s kind of hard to do that when I’ve been here all along, don’t you think? It wasn’t me who put you here, Draco. I’m really sorry to say this, but it was Harry. Harry has been acting like a maniac. I think he’s possessed.”
Harry shook his head. “You shouldn’t have said that, Draco. You don’t know if I’ll get out of here.”
“No, it won’t. But the group is not that big so I think we will be able to take them all into custody.”
“But...” A blue light missed Draco by a few inches. Bob protected him by hitting back the man who had tried to jinx Draco. Draco was impressed by Bob’s skills. He wasn’t joking when he had said he was good at that. He seemed to be someone entirely different when in combat.
“Because I know you. I’ve studied you all my life. I know your scent and your gestures by heart. My body can recognize yours by itself. It’s an addiction, really. I’m sorry.”
“Even though I miss my old wand,” I said in a low voice, “what happened so long ago has nothing to do with my current state.”
“You have to, Potter. You don’t have a choice!” Lucius moved uncomfortably on the couch. “Now, do tell us where Draco is!”
I stood still. Harry was now just a few steps away from me. I was definitely disturbed if I hadn’t realised until that moment how close he really was.
Harry stared at the landscape ahead. Saulus’ Mansion was located at the top of a cliff, and very far ahead he could hear the ocean. Life seemed so beautiful from up there, so peaceful. It was a contrast to Harry’s turmoil.
At that moment, I decided to be reckless. My magical levels had dropped a lot ever since I got sick. I could perform some simple spells without getting too tired, but complex ones drained me completely. Even so, I decided to use Legilimency on Matilda. I walked towards her and used my charms to call her attention. My eyes found hers, and for a brief instant, I could see into her twisted mind. I saw a secret meeting with hooded and masked wizards. Those masks were very similar to the ones the Death Eaters used to wear. I blinked so the spell could be broken. Fortunately, Matilda didn’t notice a thing, just blinked stupidly for a few seconds and then turned to normal as if nothing had happened. I really had become quite good at that kind of magic. My evil aunt Bellatrix had been a marvellous teacher.
Draco had thought a lot about everything, and he was still hurt about Harry’s decision, but he understood. Draco also knew that even though Harry was the most important person in his life, he wasn’t the most important person in Harry’s life. Nathan was, and Draco didn’t have the right to complain about that. Not just that, but he also didn’t want to. He loved the child as much as Harry and he also wanted to protect him. Still, his heart hurt.
The line was cut off abruptly. It made me angrier than I thought possible. I knew my face was red when I threw the phone back to Grey.
“Seamus is still recovering,” Harry pointed out. “He can’t do anything yet. He isn’t like you willing to do it here.”
Was it my impression or did Harry Potter just blushed? I opened my eyes wide. My heart was overjoyed.
“I’ll give you one last chance, Harry. Just one. You can explain yourself better right now, or I’ll walk out of that door and never look back. Did you hear me? Once I put my feet outside that door you’ll be dead to me. Once I’m out of here, there’s no turning back. So, what’s it gonna be?”
His strong hands cupped my face. I opened my mouth like an idiot as if I was waiting for a kiss. I was definitely dreaming.
“I did what I had to, Harry. I went after Saulus, yes. I needed to know the truth. After all, he could have been my father. Lucius was a shitty father but he was my father. And I needed to know the truth about Nathan as well.”
“Isn’t it kind of obvious, Harry?” Ron pointed out. “Nostrums probably had followers of his own. You can always count on some stupid human who worships stupid things like demons… Someone must have stolen it from the Harvest family.”
“But, Harry...” Hermione bit her lower lip. “How could Lucius have kidnapped Nathan from Sirius’ Mansion? It doesn’t make sense.”
“Do your homework, but find some time to have fun. No wandering around the castle at night, let alone the Forbidden Forest. And above all, if somebody bullies you, go straight to the Headmistress. Got it?’
"My dream. That’s the word that makes them go away," Nathan explained as if that was the most normal thing in the world. "
“I’m not involved in any of this mess, Potter!” I tried to reason with him, knowing quite well it was pointless.
It’s time! Hope you enjoy and thanks for the reviews. This chapter is very short, since it is a lead-on to the story outside of Hogwarts.
“Right, so based on your conclusion, we should just eliminate every new person moving to England and/or Scotland… just in case they supported the You-know-who?” Dean snorted.
“Be quiet! The next student to say the word ‘Dress’ will spend detention the night of the ball.” Snape called out in his devious voice. Instantly the students quieted down but more than a few students looked excited enough to jump up from their seats.
“It is truly a beautiful setting.” Luna was completely ignorant of the rude behavior. “And it is especially a good place for Fruitloompers.”
“We’re casual?” He fumed. “Oh well, since we’re ‘casual’ then perhaps I should go with someone else, but yeah sure, we can ‘
“Stop! Jason, stop!” seeing the dark-haired teen laughing and squirming around, it was hard to take his order seriously. “Stop it!”
Even between the added exercise, Ron found it necessary to discuss Harry and Malfoy’s upcoming date.
“-As a Slytherin, you will show yourself from your best behavior, not tumbling around like a foolish Hufflepuff!”
“No, I-“ Harry began. “Ron and I are heading in a difficult direction right now, so I thought I would give him some space.”
Draco mostly felt the need to give the older man the middle finger right about now, but instead decided to crumble the note in his hand. Giving the professor a single nod, he asked to be excused and left the classroom shortly after. Feeling the list of names in his hand gave him a strong sense of antagonism. Why did Potter believe him to just be another name? Was this list of any kind of recognition? Future lovers?
“Come on, it will be fun.” Jason begged. “Please Harry, we could invite some of Blaise’s and my friends, and you invite the Gryffindors. It will be a fun way to spend this cold afternoon, pleaaaase?” The hurt puppy look was back and Harry finally caved.
Deciding to ignore them seemed like the best option. Of course, that was until Crabbe practically beat the book out of Hermione’s hands.
“Yes, it has certainly been preventing us from having more than one round of sex since it affects his-“
Oh. Harry hadn’t even thought of that. He hadn’t been back since fourth year and he certainly couldn’t do it with weeping myrtle wandering about in the pipes. But it was truly a wonderful place to relax. He remembered all the different tapes of color and added scents. Maybe he should true it again…
God! He started to sound like a bloody Hufflepuff! To think of sex as anything other than gratification….
The rest of the time was rather uneventful, and before Harry knew it, their last class was over. He fiddled with his school supplies as he packed his bag, looking for an excuse to remain the last person. Remus closed the door and asked him to accompany him to his private quarters. Inside the tiny cozy livingroom, Remus called for a pot of tea and some chocolate biscuits.
He took especially long time around the chest; rubbing the soap and his hands across his nipples a few times. It wasn’t so strange how sensitive his body felt. It had been at least three days since he had had the time to touch himself. Without further thinking, he soaked up his hand and started pinching his nipples playfully. At first gently running his fingertips across them, then actually gripping them, pinching. Gasping he felt the need arose as well as the flesh between his legs. If only it was Draco touching him, right now instead of his own hands.
Harry couldn’t help but feel sorry for the egg as well as the mother. As he had learned over course of time, Dragon were very distrusting when it came to leaving their eggs behind. Just remembering how aggressive the Dragons back in fourth year had been, Harry imagined how harassed the mother must have felt.
“We better leave before the professors are too far away to see us.” Knott suggested and didn’t wait for a reply before heading out the gate. The group of Slytherins followed. Blaise started walking as well, but practically fell back against his chest when Jason stood steady.
Entering the silent hall, he searched between the large sections of books, only seeing few unimportant students, studying. No, he wasn’t here. Or at least not in this section. Turning towards the forbidden section, he imagined very well, one could seek solitude in between the screaming horrors.
The smile and the striking uneven hair should have given him a clue long before he was told. But what could possibly had left him, thinking ‘I have a son from a barely real relationship?’. No. No matter how much pain it had caused him to see Lupin leave and to leave his own lover unexpected, he would never regret it, because the most wonderful person had been led right to him. Severus thanked the stars that his son had only inherited his intelligence and barely any part of his appearance. The tall build was certainly his, as well as the slightly narrowed lips but the rest was pure Lauris.
Sirius nodded, touched. It was hard to win back Harry’s trust after Nathan disappeared from his own house, but Harry had forgiven him already. Now, every time Sirius looked after his nephew – as he called Nathan – he made sure to keep a closer watch on him.
Harry raised a brow. "Draco, you're in my house, uninvited. I'll call you whatever I want. What are you doing here anyway?"
Nostrums gave him the usual smirk. “Should we just sit down and talk things over or should we battle until one of us is dead? I’m all for the last one. It would be a bit unfair because you’re such a peaceful being, but...” Nostrums shrugged. “I’m amoral. I don’t care at all.”
Harry roughly flattened Draco against the wall and squeezed his neck. “But we have the same face, the same body.”
My mother’s reaction wouldn’t be any different, or so I thought. I wasn’t really sure. My mother had become more understanding over the years. Still, there was the matter of Scorpius’ inheritance. I knew for sure my father would think of my adoption as a betrayal to Scorpius. I wasn’t ready to face him and his angry accusations yet.
The accusations against him were very serious. Betrayal and murder. The least important of them all had been threatening Vernon Dursley, and that was the only one that was real. The fat bastard deserved that and more for mistreating Harry and Nathan for so many years.
“Right, what do I know anyway? I am just an Auror dealing with dark forces since I’ve been born… How could I forget I have an entire Headquarter with the best agents in the world at my command?’
Where was he? Draco had no idea. All he knew as he opened his eyes was that he was in deep trouble. His memories came back to him slowly. He saw himself and Fred knocking on Flint’s door, interrogating him, and then… an explosion. Flint had tried to attack them, and someone had helped him. Someone Draco knew pretty well.
“You heard me. I can’t do this. I’ve changed, Harry. I’m not the same cold-heartless bastard I used to be. Back then I thought I could have you and leave you without hurting myself. But now only thinking about you abandoning me after a short period of wild sex just kills me. I can’t do this to myself. I love you too much but I can’t do this.”
“No. But I know Harry. And I know the glow in his eyes when he’s looking at you. He loves you, Draco. I think he’s just waiting for the right moment to say it. Maybe he’ll say it at the surprise party he’s planning for you and–” she covered her mouth with her hands.
Seamus Finnegan… Draco let his mind drift away to the past. Seamus had helped him a lot. Draco owed his life to him. Seamus had been the one who had saved him from being killed by the Death Eaters when they had discovered Draco’s betrayal. He also had been the one who prevented Draco from doing something stupid with his own life when all hell broke loose.
“I’m serious. Thanks for the sudden chivalrous impulse, but I think you’d better get some rest. After all, we’re leaving for Egypt in a few days. The sooner we go the better.”
“All right.” Harry glanced at Draco and then at the road again. “Breathe, honey. Remember what Dr Jules said?”
Draco opened the door wearing only jeans. He looked at Harry shaken and surprised. Harry looked at him completely dazzled by the image of his wet naked torso.
“Oh, don’t try to take it back now; it’s too late. And I already admitted that I was funny, so you are forgiven.”
Neville smiled evilly. “I don’t think so. You’ll have to wait. I need to talk to you both about Nathan’s prescription. It isn’t anything to worry about. Just precautions you’ll have to take when he gets home.”
I also noticed how hurt Harry looked by Alfred’s affirmation, which distracted me from my own pain. Harry felt guilty. When we talked in Matilda’s house, he looked sincerely shaken by the increase of wizards who were living on the streets. Kids who were related to ex-Death Eaters. Kids just like Alfred and Angel. I was shocked to realise that Harry blamed himself.
“Well, it’s kind of hard to miss when it’s all over the news,” Jonas sneered. “I figure you’d show up eventually. In fact, I was planning to write you a letter, but you know I’m not very good at it…”
Once again, Nostrums lowered the Corona of Power and closed his eyes. It was so easy that Nathan felt apprehensive. Even so, he stepped forward and raised his forefinger in the direction of Nostrums’ forehead. For a moment, he was scared of what he’d see inside Nostrums. His hand shook a little, and he sighed deeply to calm himself down. Whatever Nostrums wanted to show him, it wouldn’t shock him. As Toledo, and even before that, he had seen and felt many different things. The one in front of him was just another demon.
Draco sighed. He understood Harry’s feelings completely. He didn’t want to leave the room either. But it would only be for a few minutes. Neville and the medi-witches needed privacy to examine Nathan. Having Harry hover around them like a watchdog wouldn’t do any good.
The fingers kept moving for a while until Draco lifted Harry and buried his throbbing cock inside him. Harry moaned soundly. Draco started rocking his body very slowly, teasing his partner in every way he could.
Alfred appeared behind Harry and he frowned when he saw his brother. ‘There you are! Mrs Malfoy is looking for you. It’s past your bedtime.’
“You’ve lost your touch, Nathan,” smirked Nostrums. “The spell was supposed to work both ways. We shouldn’t be able to see them.” He pointed at the people fighting next to him, an evil smile playing on his lips. “Just a little disturbance will be enough to break the spell, and then I’ll be able to hurt your friends. You even let your daddy inside your magical dimension. How sweet and convenient. But first, let’s finish what we began centuries ago. I will destroy you this time, Nathan. Or should I call you... Toledo?”
“It’s my fault. I had to know more about you and your illness so I ended up putting her under pressure a little bit...”
Patiently, Nathan took her little hands and made her let him go slowly. Then he knelt beside her and kissed her on the cheek. “I’ll bring you something from Hogsmeade,” he whispered in her ears. Her face lit up.
"Hmm… We do have a problem then." Draco slipped his hand down Harry’s stomach and stroked him a few times. "You’ve always liked to be in control… But sometimes you have to face defeat, Harry, and this is one of those times." He climbed on top of Harry and kissed him on the lips. "Just surrender. There’s really nothing you can do about it. Let me take you to places you’ve never imagined before," Draco taunted him, "Let me penetrate you slowly, just the way you like it, and then speed up my movements until you come."
He took the wand from my hands and then stepped away. He looked at me from the opposite side of the garden and pointed the wand at me. I suddenly became very aware of myself and my surroundings.
I stood up and Angel did the same. When I turned around, I saw Harry. He looked absolutely exhausted. His green eyes, however, were shimmering. There was admiration in those eyes, and something more. Something that seemed to mirror what I was feeling. Sadness mixed with resignation. The desire for things to be different. Or maybe it was only my mind playing tricks on me.
When he was gone, Dean caught Seamus’ hand and kissed it. Suddenly, just one look into Seamus’ eyes was enough for him to realise that he couldn’t leave Seamus. He would be the one to make things right for Seamus again.
“He won’t tell you anything, Potter. I know it’s difficult to accept, but you’re not every child’s hero,” I said with a sneer. “Why can’t you just accept my help?”
The little hand caught his. Silently, Nathan had made his choice. He had chosen to go with Harry. Without waiting for anyone Harry left the house leading Nathan by the hand. His friends followed him a few seconds later. Outside, they met five Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad. Harry knew them and he wondered why they were there. Then he grimaced. The Hit Wizards were specially trained to deal with criminals. Maybe the Council had decided that he was a criminal after all the threats he had made to those old fools.
I felt out of breath. I wanted to run and hide. I felt my eyes filling with tears, and how humiliating would it be to cry in front of Harry Potter? I’d done it once with catastrophic results. I bit my lips. I had to be strong.
Harry’s lips went down licking and biting my neck. I threw my head back in ecstasy. I held him and buried my hands in his luscious black mane, something I had always dreamt of doing. I pulled him as closely as I could, my hips moving desperately. I noticed that Harry was as excited as I was, and I smiled victoriously. Harry groaned and kissed me until I was out of breath. He kissed me as if to wipe out the smile on my face. Our hips moved in unison. I wanted him naked, but there was no way of stopping now, not when I was almost bursting. The friction between our bodies was heavenly. I bit Harry's lower lip hard and came in his arms whimpering his name. Harry followed me closely in a strangled moan as if he were in pain. I held on to him as if I was a castaway, my own primitive groan escaping from my lips.
Professor Snape’s small black eyes lingered on his for second longer than Draco felt comfortable with and he had to resist the feeling of squirming in his seat. Snape couldn’t possible have picked up anything from their conversation, but Draco had learned a long time ago that the professor had a tendency to know secrets, giving he basically had spent half his life spying. The tall man finally nodded and continued to hand out the pieces of paper for each student at the Slytherin table.
“’Can’t believe we have classes at eight tomorrow.” Dean yawned and stretched his arms. Seamus had already gone to bed and was pulling his covers around his legs. Harry had just started to pull off his shirt when a slight tapping began. Seeing something move in the corner of his eye, he noticed a brown owl sitting on their window ceiling. Its yellow eyes stared unblinkingly at him, obviously waiting to be let in. He had barely opened a narrow slit before the owl dropped a note and jumped out of the way to fly back. Harry turned to see if any of the boys had noticed the interaction, but all had gone to bed and closed their drapes.
Even though he had known, hearing Malfoy actually say it out loud, hurt worse than Harry could have imagined.
“It’s not your fault, Hagrid-“  Harry never finished because suddenly Aodhan started snarling towards something behind them. Glancing across his shoulder, he saw some of the teachers running towards them.
“I… Sir-“ Draco could feel tiny beads of sweat collecting in the back of his neck. “The truth is I’m in love with Harry Potter, sir.”
“No!” Pansy shook for finger right into his face. “The school knew! Not PEOPLE, not OUR people! What am I going to tell my father?”
“Here, you take this.” Before he could object to the disgusting treat, the cashier had handed him it. “-And I will get you what you need.” He once again smiled brightly at Severus as he removed the powder from his own fingers.
This had indeed been the first time the dragon had even come close to such a thing as smoke let alone real fire.
him. Completely laying down on top of Potter, he felt the hard signs of an erection matching his own. Slightly adjusting, Draco lined their prisoned cocks up together. He waited for Potter to take another deep breath, before grinding his pelvis against the hardened boy. Pushing his pelvis up as though he was already fucking him.
He took a small sip from the scolding drink, enjoying the slight burn and bitter taste across his tongue. Beside him the joyful headmaster blew his own drink before slurping a taste.
“I found it after it had fallen out of Mr. Potter’s pocket the other day. If you and he is in a… liaison, then do tell me why you are simply another name on a list?”
The long parchment was the one, Jason and he had been working on so far in class. But now it was filled with scribbles, crossed out phrases and newly joined notes written on top and on the sides. Inspecting it, he found the words ‘ridiculous’ and ‘Not like that’, on more than a few pages. Harry couldn’t help the small chuckle that escaped him as he was reminded of the book of the half-blood prince.
The fight continued but it didn’t really last as long as they had hoped. Getting closer to each other became too easy, since it was impossible to avoid the snowballs at the same time. After two games ending after just six minutes they took a small break, wondering how to make the game last longer.
Despite his body sweating already, Harry felt his body freeze as he looked at the fireplace. Or rather, what was in the fireplace. A scolding black cauldron was positioned on top of the roaring fire and in it was a rather familiar sound of something round gentle pressing up against it, rolling around.
“Yes, I suppose it had been more difficult for us to let the past slip away.” Setting down his half cup of tea on the coffee table, Remus stared at him with a painful look in his eyes.
“I see.” Malfoy was fiddling with his sleeves, removing invisible lint. “I saw Professor Snape followed you down here, did he say anything interesting?”
Seeing the brown bag hanging on the back of his chair, Harry got up. Suddenly someone bumped into him and hurried past. Looking up from the content in the schoolbag, he saw Parkinson sitting down in a chair as well, burring her face in a novel. Harry couldn’t help but notice how she had picked the chair as far away from his as she possible could, while still sitting beside Crabbe and Goyle. Burrowing the things he needed, he sat back down and leaned towards Zabini.
A tiny hand grabbed his and in what Harry assumed was a hard grip, it was pushed against a leathery cheek.
“Was…” Snape couldn’t believe this. No longer able to sit still, he rose from his chair and moved to look out the window, desperately wishing he was alone now. Lauris was dead. Only a few months ago. Trembling, he took a deep breath, commanding himself not to lose control. This wasn’t possible. Lauris had been pregnant. Looking at the picture again, he realized the picture was taken in 1980. It had truly been seventeen years since he had seen the beautiful man. Whom had been pregnant….
They had almost reached the hidden entrance when, once again, Harry was pushed to the ground. Unlike the first, he really hit the floor this time and Harry’s glasses flew off his face.
“Do not worry, it will only be temporary!” He explained. “But the reservation is full these days and not enough workers. Apparently, the Ministry in Romania has enforced new safety rules regarding the Dragons and it is almost impossible for them to work without some Fancy-Pansy getting involved.”
Harry was happily eating a big brunch, feeling as if he hadn’t eaten in ages. Neville sitting next to him was not hangover either and they amused themselves by watching the struggling students sit done and trying not to throw up in their porridge.
“Erhm..” Harry doubted he would be able to get another sweater if he talked to him right now. He could always catch up to with him later that day. “I really have to get to my room before class, so kind off.”
“A night everything changed. The others have never told me what truly happened between us as animals, I will never know, but somehow we ended up fighting and as I tore into Padfoot I must have regained some sort of sanity and remembered they were my friends. I ended up biting Sirius to blood but I didn’t kill him, which as very lucky considering what I was. When I woke up, everything was changed.”
The dungeon that morning was terribly cold and he hurried to dress in both long socks and a new sweater from his aunt. The wool slightly itched, but with a long-sleeved underneath, it was probably be fine. Brushing his teeth and combing his hair in the bathroom, he listened to his dorm mates getting ready to leave for the excursion to Hogsmeade. Normally, having roommates for the first time in his life wouldn’t have been very difficult, if it weren’t for the fact that he now had rather sensitive hearing.
Harry started chuckling. “Wow, are you seriously acting this childish over a few inattentive weeks?”
The dungeon was colder than usual, and Harry could see why. As it was daytime, the house elves hadn’t bothered to lighten thee dozens of torches attached to the walls. Rubbing his arms to gather warmth, Harry walked towards the potion master’s private quarters. He had been there before and he knew the way by now. Knocking carefully on the portrait earned him a very long glare, which he avoided by staring at the wall beside it.
It was an early morning in the beginning of November when Harry realized he hadn’t been in contact with Remus for almost six months. Sitting at breakfast and watching the grey clouds drifting at the magical ceiling reminded him of Moony’s fur. While he knew the werewolf was grieving, he felt it was time to take action. He wanted to continue and improve his relationship with Remus. After all, Lupin and Professor Snape were the only two people in this world who truly had a connection to his parents. Losing them would mean losing another of the already tiny bit he had left of his parents.
“Are you still trying to win the bet?” Goyle tried again. His two minions seemed uncertain of his will.
Suddenly Harry noticed a figure behind Jason moving closer. A rather intimidating glare pierced his eyes. The person turned out to be a boy from Slytherin whom Harry had seen hanging out with Malfoy. Something-Zabini, Harry remembered. Moving closer rather quickly, Zabini seemed to stare intensely at the back of Jason’s head.
“Mngh..” Harry clenched painfully and Draco stood completely still, begging to everything holy that Harry wouldn’t ask him to pull out.
He had been afraid he wouldn’t be able to come along to buy new dressrobes for the dance, as Dumbledore had forbad him from going on any more trips. Thankfully, being the brilliant weird old wizard, the headmaster had found a way around his own punishment and allowed Harry to go ‘just this once’. Snape whom had been standing beside Dumbledore when he had asked for permission, seemed very annoyed by the favorisme and had no disregards to letting his mentor know of his displeasure.
“Just answer me this, Potter.” Getting a nod, he continued. “Is Mr. Malfoy the reason why you were sitting in an abandoned classroom?”
Turning over once more, Draco couldn’t help but think back to the last time he and Pansy had spoken without fighting. It had seemed forever ago, that he had called her his friend. While he could live without the nagging woman and the crazy part that wanted to marry him, Pansy was a rather intelligent and funny girl. He could ‘actually’ admit to himself that he missed her the tinniest bit.
“Potter, if I may.” Professor McGonagall was standing behind him, looking almost sympathetic. Knowing what could be the only thing sending him any kind of sympathy from the strict professor, Harry simply asked; “Already?” The stiff nod was the confirmation he got.
“What?” Draco pondered as he handed him the sweater. Following Harry gaze, he smirked. Even though Draco had pulled down his arms, his shirt was slightly tucked out of his pants now.
The forbidden forest was rather sunlit even with the tall trees trying to block it out. The snow reflected the sunrays the few places it could pass the leaves. Sparkling snow piles surrounded the forest as Harry sat on a bigger tree trunk. Leaning back slightly, he could see Aodhan flying around in between the trees, trying and desperately failing to catch some of the smaller birds in his razor sharp teeth.
Deciding to give him a chance, Jason let him pull free. Stepping back, the boy dried of his face, grimacing as he used his sleeve to remove the spit stuck to his cheeks. Suddenly a rather deceiving look obtained his face and with another step, he backed away before taking off. Jason had not seen it coming and was left back blinking stupidly as his boyfriend ran away from him. Unfortunately for Blaise, Jason felt his inner hunter relieve as his smaller prey disappeared between the trees.
“But even with that, I had failed you and your parents and run away like a coward. I know I can never make up for the times I have abandoned you, but I can still only hope to ask you for forgiveness and hope you want an old man in your life.”
Jason nodded in agreement. In perfect time to, as the giant clock rang and professor Binns’ let them out.
“Good, good.” He said with childish glee. “And there was the tea, thank you, Mist.” He reached to take the tray from the smaller creature holding it over his head. When the elf was certain the headmaster wouldn’t spill anything, he bowed and vanished once more.
“But even so, Mr. Potter, I do not believe it is in your best interest to get to know most of my housestudents. They may be undermined in these times, but protecting themselves against all odds, is in their blood. Although some may be changing for the better, others will continue down the wellknown path.”
Harry couldn’t help the small gasp from escaping him, as he did exactly that. He couldn’t take it anymore, he tightly grasped his cock as it stood almost purple straight up towards his stomach. As he quickly rubbed himself to completion, he moaned so loudly he felt a bit off water trickly into his mouth.  He sighed heavily against the cold tiles as he watched his remains run down the shower drain. He had no idea how long it had been, but he should probably have gotten out and ready for dinner by now. He looked at the watch again as he stepped out of the shower. Noticing that dinner had already begun almost fifteen mites ago, he used a drying charm and hurriedly got dressed.
“We should head back.” Jason pecked him once more before sitting up. “I don’t want you to get sick, lying around here all day.”
Jason could barely keep his eyes open at this point. He had been in such a pain for so long and now, as he had come clean to his favourite person in the world, the worry had settled. His mate was still there, right beside him. He hadn’t left him; screaming in terror.
“Besides-“ Harry shrugged. “Snape is helping me as well with… some personal matter.” He repeated Jason’s own words. As if they somehow had gotten a small connection through the Professor, Harry placed a gentle hand on one of Jason’s arms.
Even though honey wasn’t a favorite taste of his, he slowly began to taste something else. Something that was clearly just pure Malfoy, and Harry didn’t catch himself before moaning at the fresh taste of mint and a second taste he couldn’t quite put a word to.
As the large group were contemplating ideas, a light chuckle was released from behind Harry. Seeing the faces on the other teens he turned in the same second, Dean exclaimed excitingly; “It’s Professor Lupin!”
Harry left the tower, assured that Winy would deliver the presents to the werewolf’s private quarters. Remus’ Quarters were behind the door in the back of the Defense against Dark Arts’ classroom. Walking through the halls, he witnessed all the magical scenes on the walls where the paintings had gathered around each other’s frames, celebrating Christmas in their own manner. Many of whom wished Harry a Merry Christmas when they saw him stroll by.
“It’s settled then,” I stated, and Angel showed me such a smile that my entire being was affected by it.
Draco looked at him with one of the famous smirks Hogwarts ever produced. “That’s a small price for damaging my heart.”
“We are gathering forces.” She stared at him with suspicion. “Why? Please don’t tell me you want to be a part in it.”
“Harry didn’t mean it like that, Dean,” Ron said instantly. “You’re a civilian. You don’t have training so you can’t help us with field research. But you can stay alert to every little clue you spot. And who knows? Perhaps Seamus will appear at your shop again. Like I said, stay alert. Keep the number of our cell phones. If you need anything, call us.”
Scorpius stared at me with the same adoration and trust I had stared at my own father when I was a child. My heart was filled with sadness. What I really wanted was to take Scorpius back home and hide him from that wicked world. I wondered if my father had had the same thoughts about me when I first went to Hogwarts. Probably not. I knew my father loved and cared for me, but to Lucius being a powerful man came first. Any type of weakness was not allowed. It was damn ironic, actually, since our own weaknesses had been our downfall in the past. The proud Malfoys, in the end, did care for one another.
“But George is here,” Fred said with a mischievous smile. “And there’s nothing we can’t do when we are all together. Let’s find him.”
Harry laughed. “I can see that you’re recovering rather fast. But we really can’t, Draco. We have lunch with Hermione and Ron, remember? We can’t cancel it like we did it the last time.”
Although Lucius had become a little more humble over the years if one could call him that at all, I knew he was still disappointed in me. I had failed to become the Dark Lord’s favourite minion. I had been unable to look at that creature’s face without feeling extreme repulse. I had not become the best Seeker, neither the best student. I hadn’t become anything at all.
“Go to bed early?” I cut across her before she could say something to upset me. “Great idea, darling. I’m really tired.”
‘Ah, but this is perfect, Potter. I’m the sacrifice. Or haven’t you realised it yet? All you have to do is let me bleed to get the book. You don’t need me healthy, just alive.’
“Damn right I didn’t!” Ron looked up to face Harry. “I’ve been trying my best, Harry. You have no idea how much pressure I’ve been suffering at work because of you!  I might even get fired!”
“He said nothing. Just that I should take you and Nathan and go into hiding. I think he wants to keep me away so I can be safe. There’s nothing altruistic about his warning though. He just wants to make sure that nothing bad happens to the baby,” Draco grimaced. “I’m almost sure that he wants our baby. I just don’t know why.”
"I will." Then Harry turned to Hermione and hugged her, too. "Take care of my husband. I know he thinks he’s tough, but the truth is that he’s extremely emotional."
My mind wandered to the first day my friendship was turned down by the one who would become my world from then on.
Draco swallowed hard and looked down. Oh, yes, he understood everything, which didn’t mean that he would accept it easily. If he’d understood things right, Harry would leave him.
If it wasn’t for the pain in his stomach, Draco wouldn’t have woken up so early. He was now eight months pregnant and he was used to spending most of his days in bed. He had never felt such fatigue his entire life. Dr Jules had warned him about that. He had told Draco that as his due date approached, Draco would feel tired and sleepy, and he would need a lot of rest. That was a problem for someone as energetic as Draco.
“Look, it was all Hermione’s idea. She arranged the room and she told me to go for it. I was a little unsure about the whole thing at the beginning, but she said she suspected you loved me as well, so I went and I hoped that we had the chance to use that room. And we did. So... The whole Ball thing... It was kind of a scheme to get into your pants... but also into your heart.” Draco smiled shyly.
In the letter, Dumbledore explained to Harry that he himself hadn't learned about it until after Voldemort's death. He'd discovered that it had all been a sick plan hatched by Fudge to make Harry kill Voldemort faster and that way he could return to his post as the Minister of Magic. It had worked. Harry indeed had become very angry; enough to make him lose his sense of danger and go after Voldemort all by himself. But Fudge had never made it back to the Ministry of Magic because he had died, too.
Severus tried to ignore the warmth flowing feeling spreading across his body at the way Albus dictated himself as a parent. The rest of the evening went by slowly as they focused on his year so far, discussing students, the curriculum and Albus ideas for this year’s Christmas.
Collecting himself, Mr. Malfoy hurried; “Draco, tell me immediately what happened so we can get a prosecution started.”
Taking the cold pale hand lying on top of the covers, Harry gently stroked it, hoping for Malfoy to open his eyes. Squinting for a few seconds, Malfoy carefully opened his eyes.
Harry had to clear his throat before answering; that he had a numbing headache. Madam Pomphrey gave him a smaller pain relieve potion and moved on to Jason.
Dread quickly dropped as a bomb into his stomach. ‘Can we talk’ was usually the beginning of every breakup that had ever happened. The worry must have been plain to see, because Draco hurried to smile and tell him everything was okay.
Harry snorted. “I bet the man wasn’t exactly fine with being turned to a monster-looking death creature. Perhaps he would rather had remained dead, had she thought of that?”
Yes, he would consider himself in love. But with Jason it was different. He wasn’t simply looking for a crush, - a silly school fling. If Blaise wasn’t sure it could continue into something serious, he wouldn’t have let himself become so attached nor so ridiculed whenever Jason saw it fit to attack him with hugs.
A painful dark hand clasped around his heart and Harry quickly posed himself before everyone could see how much that bit of information was killing him. Seeing his friend in pain, Jason tried to cheer him up.
It hadn’t escaped his attention how pleasant he had felt when Malfoy smiled at him. And it certainly wasn’t in a I-got-a-new-friend kind of way. He wasn’t interested in Malfoy, was he? No that’s stupid, Harry didn’t even know him very well. ‘On the other hand’, Harry thought. ‘I’m not blind either.’ There was nothing wrong with looking. JUST looking.
