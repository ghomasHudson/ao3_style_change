"And then what would he say? Hey, I’m an old Death Eater, I almost killed Dumbledore, but I didn’t have the balls to do it, because I’m as cowardly as my asshole father? No, honestly... Not a very attractive approach." Ron said, rolling his eyes.
Draco had nodded silently before finally turning heels to go towards the door and leave the office in which he had begun to suffocate.
“The one you’ve been staring at for a few minutes now.” she replied, slowly lifting up her eyes to put them on the table right in front of them.
Draco had winced when he had passed the threshold of the door, standing in front, without daring to come any closer. Harry had to pull him by the arm to force him back in.
Malfoy had strands of hair stuck to his shiny sweaty forehead, a smile curling with obscenity and breath short of having given so much on the dance floor a few minutes before. Harry slapped himself mentally to find him attractive at this very moment.
He wasn’t even thirsty; he just came in here to get one foot down for the night. Her throat was too tight anyway to swallow anything. The mere fact of swallowing his saliva was already too much for his stomach which painfully contracted to remember what he had done. About what he’d broken forever.
Potter gauged him for a moment before turning his eyes away from his glass, which he laid down in his turn, to fit completely into the couch.
Harry was almost offended about that. Malfoy had clearly messing with him and he could not let this go by without saying anything. He had to pay. That asshole had to explain why he sudden stoped everything.
Harry frowned. He fucking screwed up... If Ginny’s eyes threw lightning, the moisture he saw shining there was in no way due to anger.
So when Ron came up with the idea of going out to get some fresh air, they had first been in the Burrow’s garden to start a snowball battle, under the amused gazes of Hermione and Ginny, in front of their childishness.
Harry squished his eyes in an attempt to see more clearly but the bleachers had become abstract and the students he had seen were no longer visible and no longer looked like coloured spots.
He risked a glance towards Potter to notice that he was staring at him intensely. Potter’s eyes seemed hypnotized on the lower part of his face, a strange mixture of fear and desire shone in his green irises. He had still not touched his meal, his hands tightly pressed on the edges of his plate while all the muscles of his body were fully tensed up.
Draco hung his hands on Harry’s hips, losing himself to his soft lips that he didn’t think he could taste for a long time.
But his life had always been complicated and too far ahead of how he managed it. He had learned long after his birth that he was a wizard, much later that he was the only one who could kill Voldemort and save his world from his permanent threat.
There was a delicately framed picture on which the weasel girl kissed him with her hand and smiled at him lovingly.
Draco stared at the ground, trying to gather all the elements he had just witnessed and sought a plausible explanation for what Potter had just revealed to him.
In the darkness, a few silhouettes were vaguely visible, but it was when Harry and Ron headed just below a streetlight, that their faces appeared.
“I don’t see how this therapy is gonna help me get my memories back” he groaned, unquestionably bored.
He looked like Malfoy but did not act like Malfoy, didn’t look at him with that despicable glance that he had always been destined for him.
With a move of his wand, Dumbledore made appear the image of a potion with a golden aspect, who’s clear yellow reflections made it almost luminous in the small transparent bottle that floated in front of them.
Harry had made various and varied apologies in their seventh year and had continued long after that. He had confessed to him that it was impossible for him to forget the sight of Draco bathed in blood on the white tile, his shirt gradually dyed with hemoglobin, while he watched him die, unable to make the slightest move.
He couldn’t tell if the urge to throw himself at him was for the purpose of hitting him or kissing him as he was dying to since he knew the taste of his fucking lips.
A soft blue light sprouted from his hand, the colour of which rapidly darkened and let appear some snowflakes that flew inside, in a small whirlwind.
Malfoy once again focused all his attention on Noah, totally disinterested in Harry, who opened wide his eyes before sighing with contempt.
Harry breathed the frozen air into his lungs before exhaling an almost opaque white mist in front of him.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy come closer to grasp his arm with delicacy and pull it up to him.
They went back to Florean Fortescue to order a sorbet each and Malfoy proposed to go and taste it in a park a little further to avoid the too insistent glances of some passers-by who had recognized them both.
He extinguished the fire under the cauldron and then cleaned all the ingredients still present on the work surface. He discarded half of them which were to be used immediately after taking them out of their jars.
On the other hand, he was particularly good at Occlumancy. A capacity that his late aunt Bellatrix had taught him to help him carry out his mission in sixth year and thus hide what it consisted of.
Swallowing with difficulty, he squeezed the flask a little in the palm of his hand, before turning to the Pensieve to deposit the memory meticulously.
The beats against his chest intensified as he stared at Malfoy with a certain appetite, feeling all his senses waking up when he was doing nothing more than reading a
He had come at once, his hand still stretched out on his sex which slowly collapsed... He had never taken so much pleasure on his own, even the last time, when Malfoy had burst into his mind by changing Ginny’s features to appear totally in front of him.
“Not tire yourself, I’m willing to bet she’s the only one who’s never discovered this type of colour in the entire universe.” he retorted, carrying his glass to his lips.
Stacks of colourful files were lying here and there, leaves protruding from all sides, a feather abandoned in the middle of scrolls and its inkwell placed in a recess, poorly plugged.
He had certainly asked Malfoy not to tease him anymore, but he had never thought that he was simply going to ignore him.
He headed towards the exit without much enthusiasm knowing full well that once home, Ginny was going to jump on him to ask him if he had thought between the two exterior decorations, she had shown him the day before.
Malfoy had a jolt at this contact and Harry smiled to see him so excited too. He already felt that he didn’t have much time left, the expert Malfoy’s hand continuing his more and more enterprising back and forth. He heard himself moaning louder as it moved on his sex.
Harry watched him sorting the clothes with anger before sending his own into his face which he would receive clumsily.
When he reopened them, they put themselves on the door of his room, the irrepressible urge to go and see Harry to talk to him.
Harry focused again on his map to see Malfoy still in the middle of a hallway in front of a deadlock.
Harry tilted his head forward to look at him and bit his lips, preventing another moaning from coming out.
Never mind the delay he would take in making his last potions, he would send an owl to warn his superiors that he would not come back this afternoon.
Kingsley was in the midst of demonstrating the new construction that the Ministry was going to fund to make a better future for wizard children and he was constantly debating with the members of the Wizengamot about the next activities that would be organized for them in the school setting.
“Ron is an Auror? So… I’m an Auror too, right? That’s what we both wanted to do, we took the same courses to get there in sixth year!” he reminded.
Malfoy had never been so disinterested in him.… He always had a knack for giving him a bad gaze in the days of Hogwarts, which had since turned into a mischievous glance, eager to make him lose his mind.
Draco sketched a new smile, crossing Potter's sparkling gaze in front of him, as his friends handed him packages all carefully packed.
This one began slowly, each one taking his marks and learning to identify the other. Soon, Quaffle was thrown from one team to another. The players began to fly more precisely and we guessed that the level was much higher than at the time of Hogwarts.
His black trousers molded the muscles of his thighs, going down in a straight cut on the rest of his legs.
Abandoning his reflection, he turned his heels to head for the shower, opening the hot water tap before beginning to undress.
“I have to go back to the office, I’ll let you know as soon as we know we’re going to get them!” he added, chewing loudly.
Draco bit his lower lip to prevent the tears that he felt rising from his throat to his eyes, where already the moisture was shamefully wetting his lashes. He took a deep breath and turned completely to clasp his back against the door and let himself slide until he met the ground.
Harry was still in the middle of his thoughts, still in the middle of the office when a movement finally caught his attention.
“Malfoy, we literally just jumped on each other, if you hadn’t pushed me away, we probably would have gone even further. Don’t you think that’s reason enough to have a discussion with your fiancée?”
He recognized Malfoy, who walked to the building with a pressing step, a young man with brown hair following him.
Without really realizing what he was doing, Draco slowly rubbed his thigh at this spot, letting out a hoarse groan to Potter, who undertook to rub himself as well, sticking his cock a little more against his thigh, until he veers off course and meets his own.
Harry moved his head from side to side, losing all control of his body while Malfoy sucked him as if his life depended on it.
Fully aware of his condition, he struggled against himself to wake up and frowned on eyelids that he felt closed now to try to open them.
"Right, but you won't make me believe there's nothing else, and no, it doesn't go with my sister. How do I figure it out? Just so you know, girls talk to each other!"
Dumbledore's smile stretched slightly as he raised his hand in a sign that was meant to be comforting, certainly suspecting his mind set at that moment.
Harry grabbed what he guessed to be his glasses and put them on his nose. The familiar features of his best friends finally appeared to him quite sharp and anxious as he had expected.
Malfoy ended up pinching his lips in a very thin bitter line before swallowing and lowering his eyes. He stared at the floor for a few seconds and then raised his head to turn it towards the stage without a look for him.
The mild warmth of the inn immediately surrounded him when he arrived on the still soaked threshold of the storm from outside. He carelessly shook his cape to drop the last drops of rain and wiped his feet on the doormat before moving fast to the bar.
“We’re not so different that you don’t seem to think so, you know…We are much more alike than you think…” Draco added, in a dragging voice.
But then if she did, she would have told Ginny everything and clearly murdered him for betraying the young woman and lying to everyone.
Potter had a slight jolt before abruptly moving his eyes up into his own. He then quickly lowered his head to see all the damage that his magic was causing and quickly loosened his hands from his plate by discarding them as if the porcelain had just burned him.
So he had let the day go by, waiting for the evening, hoping inwardly that Ron would want to cancel everything. But when Harry told back to him, Ron had become very excited, as if his tiredness due to yesterday’s party had left his body at the simple thought that in the evening they would come out.
Harry had again shown signs of weakness concerning him, such as the discomfort of their proximity when they were Side-Along, or when they were close enough to feel the heat of the other spreading through a part of their body.
So Harry went to the cafeteria with Ron for his breakfast, determined to forget the last slippages of his misguided mind. When he sat next to Ginny, she smiled at him, kissing him in love, and he immediately felt much better. He took her against him and began to swallow his meal.
They were in the middle of discussing how they could use Fire-Making spell to their advantage, when Harry again crossed Malfoy’s path, also heading his dormitory in a hurry.
Malfoy bowed harder this time, clenching his teeth, his fingers sinking into his skin, before coming into his hand, in a silent cry, trembling with jolts. At the same time, Harry also came in a long moan, letting go of Malfoy’s erection to extend his two arms, on both sides of Malfoy’s face, before landing on his sweaty body.
At about 5:00 p.m., Harry and Ron were back on campus, with new ideas running through their heads as they walked to the dining hall for something to eat.
"Yeah, George is so screwed, he can no longer do without me!" he laughed, knocking on his friend’s back.
A small smile stretched Dumbledore’s lips before he lifted his head a little more by squinting his eyes.
There was no four-poster bed where he had wisely fallen asleep the day before, nor was it the Gryffindor’s dorm with the famous red and gold colors as he expected to find it...
Theodore Nott was a bloody genius. It was undeniable and Draco was delighted to know that he would take care of Harry, convinced that he was the best placed and also the best wizard therapist of his generation to be able to help Potter out psychologically.
His breathing became more difficult to control when he already imagined it take apart with him like in his many dreams and he licking his lips just thinking about it.
When Harry woke up that morning, he felt something was wrong. It definitely wasn’t his bed, it wasn’t even the smell of his sheets.
There was no doubt that the Draco Malfoy who stood before him was the version he had always known. The cold and sarcastic character who had ruined his existence since his arrival at Hogwarts. The fucking aristocrat who denigrates everything that he thinks is not worthy of his worth, the pale copy of his own asshole father just good at demeaning others.
Harry swallowed hard, squeezing the shirt between his fingers, forgetting everything he did before that.
He turned his head in their direction but saw only the bleachers where only a few students were present to encourage them. He thought he could ear the rustling of cloth, like the rustling of a dress that rubs when one moves and the flapping of the sides that hit the ground under the effect of the wind.
Professor Powell was behind his desk, patiently waiting for everyone to take their seats. When they were all seated and all the students looked at him attentively, he spoke.
The urge to talk to him itched and he was constantly struggling with it, preventing it from getting the upper hand.
Harry sneered at the threat of his girlfriend, before losing his smile when his green eyes met two gray pearls, as cold as the wind blowing around.
"Are you going to threaten me for a long time, or are we doing this out of court?" Malfoy asked, amused.
Harry opened his eyes again when he heard him sneer, his gaze, this time amused, always resting on him.
A few minutes passed and he already wanted to turn around. Noise resounded inside and the door finally opened.
Malfoy, who had completely abandoned the book now, turned his eyes on a corner of the room and pretended to think.
Harry didn’t know what awaited him once he meet Dumbledore. He had absolutely no idea what he was going to learn from him -if he really knew what had happened- and the fear that this would not be the case kept the members from moving forward properly.
Sitting crossed-legged beside him, her nose was plunged into a book three times bigger than his. He looked at her sideways and could see that she was absorbed by her reading, the small crease between her eyebrows regularly wrinkling as she read the different lines of the grimoire.
“This is the particularity of alteration phenomena, Harry. They exist only because we want them to and as a result of the choices we have made.” Dumbledore explained, quietly staring at him with his piercing eyes.
Harry Potter was currently finalizing the witch autopsy report Malfoy brought him a few hours earlier. He was working next door on his own report to tie it together.
“Draco, Harry, step aside as you can” she added, grabbing a handful of powder that Ron was handing her in a small bag.
“Okay. I’m going home to talk to Ginny. Because unlike you, I can’t live in a lie all my life and I care too much about her to make her suffer.” he asserted, in a neutral voice, before turning to take the direction of the exit.
Strangely, it wasn’t the anger that was blocking his breath, but the terrible fear that Malfoy wanted him dead that day. Harry had a horrible feeling about the pain that Malfoy might have intended to kill him. That night, when he caught him in a moment of weakness in the fourth floor bathroom.
Nott stretched his lips with a slight grin before very slowly pulling his wand out of a sleeve of his shirt and pointing it at Harry.
Malfoy flinched slightly, following the book with his eyes, before turning his head sharply towards Harry. His usually impassive mask had cracked somewhat and revealed a slight uneasiness as well as a semblance of astonishment.
"You bastard... I should hex you that will make you shut your mouth for the rest of your life," he spit out.
Harry blinked, stunned by the luxury in which Malfoy seemed to live, even if he expected this kind of abode from an aristocrat of his rank. Everything seemed to have been chosen and tidied up with care, an aspect of Malfoy’s personality without a doubt.
Ron was nervous by his side, commenting on every movement he found impressive, a hilarious smile stretching his lips. Hermione also seemed to concentrate on the match that was taking place in front of them, watching the darkness slowly falling.
Determined to cut short the discussion, he was about to answer her, already opening his mouth to rebuke when something in the corner of his eye attracted his attention. He suspended his words by turning his eyes to look behind her, instantly running into the fact of his atony.
Harry glanced at him, seeming to have a hard time detaching himself from the vision he had in front of him, but nodded silently.
Harry turned his attention to Malfoy, swiftly turning his head towards him. Malfoy was still staring at the portrait, a muscle in his jaw quivered before he turned his eyes on Harry, breathing difficult from his chest that was struggling to get up.
Harry finished drinking the sip of whiskey he had just taken and then placed his drink heavily on the table.
"Shh... Calm down, it’s going to be okay," he said softly, tightening his fingers on his trembling arms.
In truth, he was fucking over the head of this whole thing that had been hanging out with Malfoy since they were children… All that hate that they used to throw themselves in the face whenever the opportunity presented itself, as if it were necessary.
"2006…" Harry blew, his heart racing even more. “It’s impossible…I was in Hogwarts, in sixth year, in my dorm…about to…reading. How did I get there? How did this happen?” he added.
It was almost laughable that he knew the way by heart. He couldn’t count the times he’d come in Malfoy’s bed, on his desk or even against the door of his room when his desire was too strong.
Harry felt his hand sticking against Malfoy’s penis and gave a little cry in Malfoy’s mouth. He wanted to back off, but Malfoy clung to his arm and holding his hand firmly around him. Malfoy then began slow movements on his sex, thus guiding Harry’s hand in slow back and forth, to accustom him to his body.
Potter’s eyes darkened instantly when his mouth met his fingers, avidly following his gesture as Draco kissed them one by one, gradually lowering into the hollow of his palm where he laid a burning kiss.
Harry only had time to see a dark-coloured figure closing the door and a few strands of light hair flying when the door closed.
He made several back and forth at first very smooth, biting his lip in front of Malfoy’s vision under him. Malfoy let go of the sheets and laid his hands on Harry’s hips, burying his nails in his flesh, a sigh escaping from his lips. When he made small whistles, Harry almost completely withdrew and returned more abruptly, making them moan with pleasure.
Harry was already in his pajamas and lying on the bed, a book on Quidditch in his hands. Draco took the opportunity to open the drawer where his clothes were, all tidy and folded to perfection to get out a fine pajamas.
A throbbing pain hit him in the face and pulled out a muffled moan when he felt he was going backwards under the violence of the blow.
Several nights that he slept on that bloody couch where his sleep and body were suffering, leaving him a little more tired and bruised than ever.
He could drop everything and let the magic take over. Stop struggling to be swallowed up by the power that grew in him. He could let her destroy one by one his vital organs and nibble on his flesh until she reaches his epidermis. He would let her take his body shell and destroy his spirit. Demand the neural connections of his brain and take his place until he annihilates him all.
“Yes, you too…” he nodded, lifting them briefly to meet his grey eyes and slowly moving away towards the corridor.
Draco stood upright, waiting for Potter to finish dressing up, his face firmly lowered on his feet, visibly resigned to the fate that awaited him.
Harry had not slept all night. He had refused to give in to sleep for fear of deviating again in his dreams. It was the first time he had done that. He had never thought of anyone other than Ginny since his sixth year at Hogwarts while he masturbated...
Yeah, he was ashamed to think so much of Malfoy when he had Ginny as his girlfriend. She was so pretty, so nice to him. And she had a tempered character like Harry liked. She was perfect for him and he knew it. But that didn’t stop his mind from wandering towards that little bastard. He spent his time verbalizing himself mentally every time his fucking dick pulsated when Malfoy’s face was going through his thoughts.
A slight smile stretched the lips of Draco who felt at last in his place. Harry, in the hollow of his arms, his heart beating softly against his chest, meeting his own in a similar rhythm. Then he leaned his head to the side pressing his cheek against his shoulder, his mouth meeting the skin of Potter’s neck where he dropped a light kiss.
“Hello Mr. Potter, I’m Andrea Page, the Healer’s Chief of the treatment of spell damage services. Please follow me” she announced, pointing the corridor to her right.
Malfoy had backed up his chair and was already standing with his hand stretched out on his coat rack.
“So, tell me everything! What complications are we talking about, exactly?” Blaise asked, crossing his legs, one of his feet resting carelessly on one of his knees, while his arm lay on the back of the couch.
“I’m so sorry, Harry. I wish I could have brought you better news, but I can’t possibly misrepresent the truth, even though sometimes it would be easier to digest.” Dumbledore replied, whose voice suddenly seemed farther away.
"Well, if I expected this…I never thought that YOU, you don't know about my sexual preferences…" he just said.
Harry tried to calm his ardour a little, without however obscuring Malfoy from his thoughts. He remembered the moment of complicity they had shared, when Malfoy had for a moment abandoned his impassive mask, making him more agreeable than usual and unveiled a facet of his personality that he had particularly appreciated.
The warmth of Malfoy’s hand in the hollow of his kidneys, his subtle perfume embalming his nostrils, made him blink to focus more on the place where he wanted to land.
Harry glanced at him and very quickly turned his eyes, shrugging his shoulders before getting up and taking his plate and putting it in the sink.
"Then, explain to me what you’re doing here, if you want everything to stop between us Potter?" he asked, skeptic.
will get your kicks, Malfoy!” Harry assured, turning to him, slightly pushing him to fall on the bed.
” he began, with a move of the hand, while showing an object in front of each student, as well as at his desk.
Yes, Harry was definitely physically attracted to Malfoy. More than that, he kept wanting him. It was as if his body claimed some as soon as he left him. Like a lack never satisfied, a desire never satisfied.
“But I don’t fucking remember! This morning again I was convinced to want to become Auror, I was studying to spend the N.E.W.Ts with you! How could I change my mind after the fact?” Harry shouted, causing the lights to flicker around him.
He had difficulty concentrating during the practice of the new defense spells he was taught that day. But he quickly recovered when he almost touched the teacher with one of them. The rest of the day was as difficult as the morning. Harry had hardly eaten anything during lunch, too disturbed to swallow his entire meal.
Potter stopped looking at him. With his head turned to the side, he had the look of the one who felt guilty, as if the fact of having hurt Draco also reached him. He clenched his fists around his plate, his lips tightly pinched, seeming to struggle not to hit himself.
“Absolutely none.” he answered instead of Zabini, placing an arm in front of him to prevent him from going further.
Malfoy squinted his eyes before lowering them to look at his thigh and then raised them to plunge his metallic irises into his.
Harry breathed through his nose, a little smirk adorning his lips, before getting up with difficulty to start dressing and looking for his clothes in the little pile at his feet. He took off a T-shirt and put it over his head and unfolded it on his chest, before stopping in front of Malfoy’s burning gaze, looking up and down.
“It would have been my pleasure, but today’s training has worn me out… Next time,” she smiled, winking.
The cold winter air blew in his face, drawing the lines of his skin every gust. However, neither the cold nor the snow that fell by large flakes would spoil this moment when he felt soothed and at the same time so energized.
"Tell me where it is" Harry retorted, his heart pounding against his chest, his breathing difficult to control.
And it had taken many years before he could say a word about how he felt about someone he had always considered a rival, an enemy, a first-rate bastard. And that more than anything else, even the fact of separating from Ginny only a month before marrying her, it had crushed his bowels and flipped his guts to understand the bottom of his feelings for him.
Malfoy had his head turned in his direction but didn’t seem to see him. He squinted his eyes; his lips were deformed by a disgusting wince as he stared at a spot right next to Harry. It did not take long for Harry to understand that it was Ron who had begun to emit a slight snoring in the middle of his heavy breath.
He took the pillow and pinned it against his face and smothered a scream, gripping the edges of the fabric firmly between his fingers.
Harry closed his eyes briefly, feeling his heart beat faster at the thought that he too had particularly snogged Malfoy not long ago and that he had very quickly replaced him.
In the midst of his reflections, he remembered his appointment with Dumbledore and hurried up the stairs where he had stopped to go to his office.
He pinched his lips, wrinkling his eyes like he was trying to get through the epidermis to make sure there was nothing to hide.
He stood up carefully, and began to look for them, groping the nightstand with his hand, finally finding them, perfectly folded, before putting them back on his nose.
Nevertheless, he became tense, feeling the fingers of Malfoy loose his palm by fondling it gently, barely a slight touch, but enough that his heart began to beat louder under the softness of his skin against his own.
place, so you can tell everything that Andrea told you and I intend to be part of the conversation,” he retorted.
Ron to the right, laughed brightly, snaking the air, leaning on his broomstick, pushing a little to overtake him.
“Let’s say it’s a good start, but you’ll have to be a little more demonstrative next time” he replied, in a smirk.
In Hogwarts already, he was the closest to his fame in the House of Slytherin. He had a very similar presence to his, an undeniable attraction to manipulate others, and his grin was almost as bad as his at the time when he used it to destabilize other students who bothered him.
It just took a third party to figure it out, and it wouldn’t be that desperate if it wasn’t someone, he had never thought he’d feel that way about before. It could have been simpler if he had not been so late in understanding how he had been feeling in recent years.
Harry turned his head slightly to the side to try to see the face of his stranger, but it was too dark to hope to recognize him.
Malfoy had once again blamed him, repeating that he was far too distracting to simply look at him without wanting to make him lose his means. Harry had then replied that it was not with this kind of attitude that he would succeed in progressing, that he had come to train him and not only to fuck with him.
Harry opened wide his eyes and stretched out an amused smile and then nodded silently by knocking his glass against Malfoy’s.
“So we’re done here because I’m not going to let you continue” he announced with a sharp blow, painfully wincing when Malfoy’s sex completely withdrew.
Draco had spent a good part of his studies looking for himself. And when he got tired of the look that he had chosen to have, although restful, he had decided to grow.
Draco stared his grey eyes into Potter's too-green ones, taking a deep breath before opening his mouth.
Harry felt his body stagger under the pressure of the spell, his eyelids flapping frantically to prevent his sight from blurring.
The heartbeat of his heart did not slacken as he walked nervously and finally reached the entrance of the building. He closed his eyes before crossing the magical field that would lead him to his workplace. He could feel the presence of Potter in his back, which followed him closely and the slight sound of his steps. He repressed a long shudder when his warm breath crashed against his neck, and more strongly wrinkled his eyelids as he passed through the barriers of St Mungo’s.
He released his arm, painful efforts undertaken. Harry breathed for a long time, his breath being lost on the candlestick to create a little mist. He had partially succeeded. The ice was still too thin, but the candlestick was completely frozen.
He then rested the cloth and glanced at the enchanted objects that prepared the meal before leaving for the living room. He hesitated for a moment in front of one of the closets then sighed before opening it to take a glass.
Malfoy gauged him up and down, lingering on his bust, in such a delicate way that it made Harry terribly uncomfortable.
Events had undoubtedly bruised him internally, it was difficult to remain focused on a happy memory.
He had completely lost control this time. He almost hurt someone and didn’t even realize it. It took a third party to stop him from going any further, and it was Ron who intervened.
Blinking, he quickly looked around the room to see that he was well in the infirmary of Hogwarts as he had suspected. He squished on the edges of his glasses which had regained their usual round appearance and a violent panic rose up in his throat to prevent him from breathing.
Harry couldn’t forget that feeling that went through him that night. This craving that had encompassed his entire brain to focus only on Malfoy’s lips and the taste they would have when they touched his.
“I- I don’t know…. Maybe.” he replied, looking away, unable to face the young woman's piercing eyes.
He was frowning, seeming not to believe what he saw when only Harry was standing in front of him. Harry went one step further, determined to understand the strange behaviour displayed by Malfoy but a noise rang on the side making them both turn their heads towards its origin.
“But I would understand if you wanted to go back to yours to enjoy the evening with her.” he added, to cut short the discussion.
Ginny’s team scored a first goal, raising and shouting several students in the stands, he and his friends too. The opposing team equalized just after, however, making him grunt.
“I understand this is very disturbing for you, Harry, but you’re in no condition yet for me to explain anything to you.” Dumbledore said, in a softer tone than the last.
He shifted the chair a few inches away from the Slytherin, which made a slight grin before playing with the cufflinks of his shirt.
He had also agreed to sit on the couch, chewing as if his life depended on it, before swallowing loudly and grabbing a cup of tea to pass it off.
He raised his gray eyes into the emerald green of the survivor and smiled at him with his eternal grin before lifting his brow arch.
Malfoy’s hips rose up against him, exerting a pronounced upward and downward movement against his buttocks. Harry could feel his dick pulsating over his pants, showing all of Malfoy’s cravings for him right now.
He had been to the library just before he went to find him, killing two birds with one stone since it was on his way to Malfoy’s dorm.
He did not yet fully realize when the cold of the glasses met his cheekbones. He was just as terrified when the tip of Potter’s nose plunged into his cheek, his warm breath subtly caressing the bottom of his face. He completely stopped breathing when Harry’s lips were shyly resting on his own. Just a touch, as if he wasn’t quite sure he was entitled to it.
Harry took great inspiration and anchored his eyes in Malfoy’s. Malfoy displayed a victorious, almost sadistic smile that had the effect of upsetting Harry who then advanced to attack him. But Malfoy spoke before Harry had time.
Malfoy’s laughter calmed down a bit and Harry realized that he had stopped smiling and that his breath had stuck in his lungs. He took a deep breath and exhaled heavily when he felt the rising fear in his bowels to experience such emotions.
“Learn to master yourself, Mr. Potter, your future depends only on what you do with it and the actions that flow from it.”
Later in the evening, Harry had gone to escort Ginny to her dorm. He had not wanted to follow her inside as she had implicitly asked him. He didn’t want to, not after what happened the night before at the nightclub...
With his breath jerking, his arm in the air and his fist closed, Harry looking at Malfoy as if it was the first time he saw him.
Ron seemed to understand his gesture since he leaned to the side to catch something and reached out in his direction a few seconds later.
“Shut up, Malfoy, and just make me get a hit.” Harry hissed, giving him a deep pelvis blow that tore away a hoarse moan while his eyes were veiled with desire.
"No fucking matter if you repented or not, you were a fucking bloody Death Eater, Malfoy!" Harry shouted, out of his mind.
"Bloody hell! You're doing it on purpose, isn't it?! You're going to ask me that question, yes!" Scarhead said, really pissed off, by punching the table.
Harry stayed a little while longer to finish his dessert and left the room still crowded with students finishing their meals.
Malfoy stared at him one last time before finally Side-Along, leaving him alone in the middle of the living room.
“None of the people we interviewed were good enough, so I had to trade my place as a chaser to replace you.”
Harry forced his hold on him to kiss him again and held his mouth against his own. A muffled moan escaped from Malfoy’s lips, visibly annoyed to see himself cut again in his remarks.
“But that’s exactly why I came to talk to you. To warn you that it was over, all this bullshit... Then, you’ll be nice to go fuck yourself!” Harry scolded.
They then turned to join Ron and Hermione and Ginny told them the news immediately by throwing themselves in the arms of her best friend. Ron had glanced to him, confused, and Harry shrugged his shoulders, not knowing what to say, and smiled widely before hugging him.
Draco loosened his grip on his pants to drive his nails straight into the flesh of his palms, looking for a way to focus on something other than his inner sickness.
Ron pinched his lips in a desolate pout before sighing and sitting down, his azure blue eyes anchored in Harry’s emerald green.
“Fine. Then good luck” Malfoy replied with his dragging voice. “For that and… for the rest of the wedding organization.” he then added, stretching a thin smile.
The young man stopped sharply, spreading his eyes in his direction, before turning them towards Potter to stare at him. Then, he turned his attention to Draco in half a smile.
He had then straightened himself and gave him a shy smile, his silvery grey eyes anchored in his own. Harry’s stomach had growled at the hunger that was pulling him, making him all the more uncomfortable than the more unusual situation he was in.
He said this in a tone that Harry didn’t know him. But Malfoy’s unexpected attitude was particularly disturbing.
He had always known that Malfoy had been a Death Eater, but had never seen it with his eyes, on Malfoy’s skin.
Draco was frozen for a moment under the crude words of Potter, not expecting them to be so raw, although coming from Scarhead, he should not be really surprised.
To his great astonishment, he heard himself moaning, thinking of the sensation he felt when his hands ran through Malfoy’s skin.
"Well, obviously, I still have a lot to learn about you…. Is there any other information I should know about? The one Blaise was talking about, perhaps?" Draco asked with a sarcastic tone.
It took Harry a few moments to move to find him. He nodded faintly from his head to finally cross the doorway without a look for him. He grabbed his coat and Harry took his jacket without him having to give it to him, tearing off a slight smile on Draco’s face to see him take on habits he didn’t even remember having.
It’s been several weeks since they slept together and she wasn’t complaining. Harry had already seen her give him a few stealth glances, without insisting when she saw that he was not receptive to his request.
The light of day burned his retinas over his eyelids, which he creased strongly before sticking a hand on them to preserve them.
Harry had apparently repressed his desire for him until he finally snapped because it was too complicated to keep it in him.
“This is my business and I have no intention of telling you more. So, either you tell me where he is, or you leave me alone," Harry said, annoyed.
Harry let himself fall on the blankets, sinking his shoulders, releasing his book where his hands had become tense since he had outrageously fixed him.
Instead, several shelves were hung on them where a few trinkets, here and there, were sitting, including cups where a small snitch was flying happily at their summits.
Draco saw him reach out to his side, once he had understood the intention of the young girl who was approaching with great strides to the one-who-lived.
An awkward silence ensued between them, leaving room for the music, the bursts of voices and the laughter of their classmates echoing in the room.
He knew that Malfoy had never been a Death Eater now, and despite the actions of his father against him and his friends, he could not determine how he was perceived to be walking around with the son of an ex-Voldemort supporter.
Finishing buttoning the last one, Malfoy raised his head, raising an eyebrow in front of the surely suspicious look that Harry had to show and opened his mouth.
Harry spent all his emotions in that kiss, trying to express all craving he had for him, all the lack he had felt of having had him so far in the past few weeks. He closed his eyelids tightly, concentrating more than ever on letting all his feelings flow in the way he kissed him. Applied more than usual to show him that he was more than determined.
He stayed focused on the game as much as he could, trying to get up at the same time as his friends when his girlfriend’s team scored. He wanted to get out of here, he wanted to get out of and deal with his fucking erection which was not determined to getting down!
Certainly he had been that cold and cynical character that everyone thought pompous and unbearable, but this picture still stuck in the minds of some witches, was no longer. He’d changed a lot since Hogwarts.
Opening the drawers of the dresser, he took at random the clothes that appeared in front of his eyes, opting for a black sweater and dark blue jeans.
Harry leaned heavily against the railing by holding his ribs. He was gasping loudly, the air coming straight into his lungs was burning his throat and coming out in a rather disturbing whistle.
And even if it was wrong, even if he didn’t have the right, it was Malfoy, bloody hell, and no one ever made him feel so alive. Never before had he felt so much life sweating under his skin.
He lingered on a transparent bell where a beautiful black snake hovered, curled up along its branch, seeming to be sleeping. He wrinkled his eyes, trying to find out why this one was in such a small habitat and what the hell he was doing in an office like this.
Jealousy resurfaces as quickly as it left. This feeling burned all the pores of his skin, at the same time igniting his mind which suddenly came to life, swinging mortuary pictures against Noah who kissed Malfoy under his nose.
Abandoning Noah, he crossed the stadium, with fear in his belly, mixed with hatred towards Malfoy now and what he was probably doing…
Bill and Fleur were there too, as were Percy and the so-called Audrey, who had recently shared his life. Charlie couldn’t have been one of them that night, but would join them the next day at noon.
He frowned, remembering that Scarhead had come near him to flee all the girls who desperately wanted to steal his moment of intimacy. But that against all odds, he had preferred to kiss him, a man, rather than the young woman?
Harry remained frozen for a moment, looking at the door, overlooking the landing where the second staircase that ascended to the second floor would lead him to his room.
Harry must have felt his gaze too insistent on him, since he turned his eyes in his direction, frowning.
Malfoy was sitting on his desk, his pants undone, his sex stained with his own sperm, his eyes still darkened by the pleasure that Harry had just given him.
After closing the bottle allowing the door to remain camouflaged, he went to the kitchen, Harry on his heels, to take make the meal.
“So what? For fuck’s sake Harry, there’s got to be something or someone who puts you in that state!” Ron shouted, moving slightly on his bed to totally face him.
After all, they had shared seven years of common life when they were in Hogwarts. Every morning, they got up and every night, they fell asleep in the same dormitory. They had also occupied the same common room, attending school classes together, although their schedules differed depending on the specialties they had both chosen.
Harry passed one of his hands between their sweat-soaked bellies, and rolled it up on Malfoy’s sex. He began back and forth and detaching his lips from his own before anchoring his gaze in his own.
Harry moved slightly to the side with his hands, before groaning when he pressed his wound, bringing it back before his eyes.
It must be said that he had something to train with Harry as the main victim of his appalling cynicism at the time. He still used to be sarcastic, but no more for the same reasons about Potter. Simply because sometimes he wanted to see him react to his words. He liked to be Harry’s center of attention as when they were children.
Harry grabbed his wand and stared at it for a few moments before closing his eyes again, exhaling loudly.
“But… I don’t see what I did to get myself into it?” he retorted, seeking as far in his memories as his mind allowed him.
He wasn’t even sure it was Malfoy, but given the beating of his traitor of heart, he had high hopes.
So the guy followed Malfoy’s glance and fell on Harry’s, who automatically turned his eyes to stick them in the starry sky. His heart was pounding and he was breathing hard. His cock was still pulsating and he really wanted to deal with it!
He climbed up to the landing of Malfoy’s dormitory and held his breath before knocking on the door where his name was written.
Harry breathed with difficulty, his heart beat louder in his chest. He lost himself in Malfoy’s eyes, too grey, too dark, and lowered his gaze on half-open lips, both fine and fleshy, letting out a warm breath that came to caress his own.
As if to antagonize him, Blaise settled on the couch beside Potter who tensed up and shifted on the edge to remain as far back as possible from him, looking down on him.
Harry had wanted to save his hand, because it burned him, where Malfoy had touched him… Even after removing it, it still radiated, the warmth still present on the back of his hand, troubling him all the more if he had just laying it there.
If he were to be perfectly objective, he would understand what today’s Harry, in relationship with the man who pressed him against him to Side-Along, must have felt for him.
He may have been completely awakened by now, but he felt exhausted by the weight of memories which perhaps was not and was not surprised when the tiredness fell on him like an anvil in the midst of all his reflections.
Here again, this writing before the eyes of which he knew the author, undoubtedly made his poor heartbeat louder. Knowing that it was Malfoy who was causing this, the mortification was dreadful but did not prevent him from feeling this heat taking hold of his body by thinking about the desire he had to taste his lips in the elevator.
“I’m sorry Ginny, I’m just tired and I didn’t notice that I was so distant...” he explained, clumsily.
When Harry knew that Malfoy was the new examinwizard dedicated to their service, he could not help but ask that the ex-Slytherin travel in person to see if he had changed.
Judging by the voices that came from it, Ron must have already arrived and he rushed to welcome him, too happy to find back his best friend.
"You still think that’s true? I can’t believe this prick really recognized you and didn’t say anything" he said, shaking his head. “And for what? Give us a chance? Because he had mercy? No, I honestly think he didn’t suspect a thing and he regretted it bitterly.”
Harry gave Malfoy time to catch his breath before positioning himself more forward between his legs. He passed a hand on his own sex, going back and forth to spread the pre-seminal liquid in order to lubricate himself.
The significant noise of a floo call made them turn to the hearth to find out who wished to speak to them.
Draco took the opportunity to get closer, carefully reaching his arm to put it on his lower back, feeling him tense under fingers.
Harry was carried away by Malfoy’s bewitching kiss, moving his tongue to find his own and embrace it with devotion. He groaned under the texture of his full lips, eagerly breathing in the tangy odor, and then finally backed away from the delicious taste of Malfoy.
Harry scanned the room with his eyes and played nervously with his fingers on his trousers, before dipping his hands into his pockets. He glanced at Ron who had obviously resumed his intensive reading and bit his lower lip.
Did that mean his Harry still wanted him? Even as the 16-year-old was stuck in his mind? The Harry’s body was visibly attracted to his own.
“I guess you were inspiring me.” He explained, before drinking a sip of whiskey. He licked his lips and turned his dark eyes towards him. “And it wasn’t just you, remember the song for Weasel. Another one of my wonderful finds.” He added, stretching another smirk.
What did he still want? Had he not humiliated himself enough by coming to him to confess what he had done?
"I don't know, I foolishly thought that after everything we've been through, you just wouldn't hate me anymore, but after the witch press revealed that I was gay, and… why Zabini cowardly ran away, I thought that was what made you hate me again," he sighed, looking disappointed.
Malfoy looked down on him for a moment, perfectly still, no expression betraying the fine features of his face.
After a last breath, Harry deigned to turn his eyes towards her before once again lowering his head to put his attention on his plate.
Harry opened wide his eyes, visibly shocked by his frankness, and then nodded before resuming his reading, his hands again tense on his book.
“No, there you see, I think I’m just going to get what I came for and I’m going to let you talk quietly.” Nott added, taking a book that was lying around before heading calmly to the door and closing it behind him.
“I just want it to stop…” he moaned as he grabbed a handful of his black hair between his fingers, ruffling them a little more.
He had long believed that their relationship was doomed to failure, unnatural and unimaginable. Now, he no longer saw his life without him.
He even remembered having sketched a victorious little grin of having succeeded in destabilizing the hero of wizard world, he who had spent seven fucking years making him feel so little in control of himself by his many feats.
He turned his head to Ron and raised his eyebrows, astonished that he was not under the protection of the spell.
“No...” Malfoy blew, leaning slightly back without he seems to realize it. As if his whole being wanted to escape the present moment.
He loved his mess. This was what best represented him. He was spontaneous, impulsive, and passionate and his office clearly reflected his personality. He had never been able to contain his emotions fully. They had always taken precedence over his decisions and that is what made his strength today but also his weakness during difficult situations.
“Weren’t you eating it while you were spying on Mr. Malfoy on your map?” He asked, a little grin adorning his lips while his eyes sparkled with malice.
Obviously, just thinking was a hardship in his current state, and he clearly didn’t want to fight it while knowing it would lead to nothing good.
Harry Potter, a young student, was walking up the stairs that separated him from the hallways that he would walk for five years.
He went one step further to find himself a few inches from Malfoy and could see his shoulders collapse as if he understood that there was no way out.
He did not even have the strength to restrain the salty tears that he felt rolled against his cheeks.
“So, when did you plan this?” Seamus asked, passing his tongue on his lips to remove the rest of the foam that had lodged there after drinking a sip.
Malfoy did not insist anymore and led him to the exit. Once outside, he made a brief stop, before gently moving closer to hug his waist, pressing his fingers against Harry’s jacket.
Harry leaned over to a Quidditch trophy where the word "Seeker" was engraved right above his last name.
His blood gone up into his head when he realized that Potter had found the passage leading to the Pensieve.
Draco raised a skeptical eyebrow, before turning his eyes on Andrea who gave him a slight contrite smile.
Harry’s hands went to grab his back and squeeze his shoulder blades over his cape. He groaned when his thigh touched Malfoy’s erection through his robe and bent his head to the side to deepen the kiss.
The elevator doors closed, and Harry stepped into the corner, grabbing the railing with one hand, and placing the other on the top of his thigh to rub the stiff spot that was causing him pain.
Harry had always wondered how George felt since the loss of his twin. He suspected that he had been devastated when he died, but he had never known how he had recovered...
This one looked at him calmly, his grey orbs were piercing, but no hint of animosity seemed to have settled there.
Dumbledore made a new wrist move and divided the Cauldron Cakes into two distinct parts before his eyes.
Harry then deflected the spell and pushed the civilian to the side by throwing him a Protego to protect him from a possible recurrence. This second too much had been enough for him since the wizard had taken the opportunity to aim at him with his wand and Harry had only time to take a step to the side to dodge it. Unfortunately, the spell touched his leg and a dazzling pain crossed his tibia and went up to his thigh which caused him to lay one knee on the ground.
Hermione and Ron in their matching dresses, the pain that had gone through their faces when he told them he had forget everything.
“Please don’t make things more complicated than they already are…” he groaned, grabbing a handful of his hair between his fingers.
“First of all, because you’re not an Auror, Harry, so you don’t have to get involved in investigations and you’re the one who was attacked, so there’s no way you’re going head down until we know more” Ron said, calmly.
Malfoy dipped his dark eyes, by the lack of brightness, into his own. He was impassive, like he was out of touch with reality. He put his thumb on Harry’s lip to caress her before turning her over. Harry blinked but left them firmly anchored in Malfoy’s, waiting for the rest. Malfoy bit his lower lip before moving slowly towards Harry’s face. Harry stiffened and tried to retreat again, as if he wanted to merge with the wall.
His own breath became difficult to control when the information traced back to his brain, which ran out of oxygen at the sight of his ex-enemy taking his foot with a man. He always thought he was dating Pansy Parkinson. Harry had always believed that, being of his branch, the pureblood could only go out with girls.
Despite the situation, he was strangely no stressed. The cloaked atmosphere was rather pleasant, except the colors a little too dark to his taste. A mixture of gray and bottle-green with some notes of black here and there, nothing to do with the flamboyant colors in the common room of the Gryffindors that Harry particularly enjoyed. He literally thought he was in Snape’s classroom.
He felt Harry tense under his fingers, but despite the fact that he seemed strained by their pressure, he did not move, leaving his hand firmly on the table.
Harry immediately grabbed it, making his eyes run out on the paper to read the few lines of his friend.
Draco frowned at his strange behaviour. Potter seemed so focused on that part of his face that he didn’t even notice that Draco was staring at him back. It then became evident that Harry looked at his lips when he bitten one of his own strongly without detaching the eyes from Draco’s mouth.
Malfoy stared at him intensely before taking a deep breath and pushing back into him. Harry could feel the burning of the rubbing of his sex that made him wince while his nails crossed the sheets to anchor in his palms.
Harry slowed down a bit to give them time to join him, Ginny, falsely outraged, caught up with him very quickly and got close to him until to stuck him. Ron, on the other hand, struggled to reach their heights, being much better in front of a goal than in the air.
His stomach contracted painfully at this terrible finding. He swallows hard before surreptitiously closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, his hand picking up his wand from the pocket of his pants.
All Malfoy’s efforts to be particularly attentive, his maturity far too present both in his remarks and in his way of treating him disturbed Harry just as much. He saw that the years had passed painfully… The sixteen-year-old Malfoy was not so understanding, it was by far a good rot to be cropped.
Because that's what he was doing, wasn't it? He was openly kidding him, there was no other explanation...
“Yeah, if you want so…” he added, without much spirit to his best friend as he tormented a piece of carrot by crushing it between the picks of his fork.
Malfoy kissed him one last time and Harry heard him come in his mouth, so he also came and continued to kiss him, even after.
Malfoy sneered slightly, putting back the hair strands behind his ears which were inexorably falling back in front of his face.
Draco tilted his head to taste a little more of Potter's taste, breathing more deeply into his smell, getting completely drunk of his perfume.
He jumped when he felt the hand of Malfoy pass under the edge of his t-shirt, caress his skin with his fingertips, just above his pants. But, He did not retreat. He was as if frozen and his muscles refused to move.
"Oh, that? Nothing very important, a crazy idea that just crossed my mind," he replied, sweeping the air with a wave of his hand.
Ron and Harry stayed there for a good part of the day. They had tested a few safe inventions, and Ron had even admired his brother’s hard work. They had both submitted a few more ideas and George had kindly noted them, while Lee had seemed much more interested.
Harry could not prevent a victorious smile stretching his lips in front of Malfoy’s recognizable hate look. One of those he had long seen draw his face at a time when everything seemed simpler between them. When cravings didn’t fit in.
The kiss was more languid and Harry felt his eyelids let go when Malfoy’s tongue played with his own in a hypnotic dance. So Harry closed his eyes and knocked down the invisible wall he had built between them. His body regained its mobility and he let his hands wander through Malfoy’s hair. Malfoy had hers on either side of his cheeks and gradually lowered them down on his neck and shoulders before going to explore under Harry’s shirt.
This latter information danced for a moment in his thoughts when he realized that they were already crossing the brick wall, revealing Diagon Alley before his eyes.
He casted a spell of quick storage, the various books flew away in front of him while resuming their original place in the library, as if nothing had happened.
Harry squeezed his cover between his fingers, thinking back to his past self’s sentence, because it was true. Malfoy had a way of making him feel alive, exulting countless feelings when he spoke to him.
Draco felt sore, understanding the implication in Harry’s remarks. He knew full well at what stage their relationship was in Potter’s last memories and he apparently wished that they would return. His heart shook at the simple thought, that the Harry standing in front of him did not want his presence at his side, or at least not as he had shared it for the past few years.
This had to be understood since Malfoy smirked and turned his eyes to him by raising a sarcastic eyebrow.
Once outside, he took the time to take a breath of fresh air and close his eyes. He had just seen Potter again, and things were still not getting better…
Draco placed his cup on the coffee table, slowly turning his head towards Harry, contemplating him in spite of himself. Harry was undeniably attractive in his clothes that Draco himself had chosen for him a few days before.
Draco slowly drew closer to his still figure, stooping to his height to contemplate it. He released a strand of black hair from his lover’s forehead, thus revealing the scar in the form of a flash and freed the sparkling green eyes that made him capsize so much.
Harry was mostly disgusted, but he could already feel his fucking cock react. He wriggled in his chair, trying to hide the bump that was forming between his legs.
Harry stayed in this position for a long time, until he felt too tired to keep his eyes open and ended up closing them.
even though it was because he was irritated to see him pick himself up every time his first name escaped the barriers of his lips.
A few strands of his hair pinned to his skull fell before his eyes, which he pushed out with a move of his hand before inspecting the premises.
“I was waiting for the moment when you would decide to ask me” He blew, lowering a little his very light grey eyes, in the cold winter, reflecting the trees of the park as clearly as a mirror.
He opened his mouth and forced a little on his voice, letting out a hoarse sound that burned his throat painfully.
“Where is your sense of joke?” he taunted, raising his eyebrow a little more, his gaze firmly set on the object.
"Before you think about starting over, I'm going to get away from you and this fucking mistletoe and get me drunk," he said, heading towards the buffet.
Harry was still smiling, his face a few inches from Malfoy’s face, which was frowning. He looked at his fine features and his light grey eyes, feeling his heart beating louder in his chest, the corners of his lips slowly lowering, as his gaze landed on Malfoy’s offered mouth under him.
“As you wish, but be careful, Mione will not forgive me if something happens to you on the way...” he winced.
Harry had done well to stop everything and if that fucking ferret persisted in pissing him off, he would make him regret.
Harry thought as fast as his mind allowed and remembered that they were visiting George at the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes shop, to give him a hand.
Harry seized it with one trembling hand and had to use his second to hold the glass while he was drinking. He forced himself to swallow and winced when he felt the water flowing into his trachea, barely passing the barrier that separated it from his stomach.
The next night, he was determined to explain himself to Malfoy. Even if, in doing that, he had to admit that it happened...
“Seriously? Good old Theo? I am not even surprised that he chose this path, it is certainly the one that suits him best. Manipulating people was one of his favorite hobbies” he noticed while drinking a sip of wine.
He let the cold water run over his skin to calm his excitement and then turned the button over the hot water to erase the tension that was squeezing his muscles. Harry then returned to his room and dropped heavily on his bed.
Slight noises reached him to his right, but he did not get immediately pay attention, thinking of students who were dragging to get home too. But small groans rang out and made him shiver with embarrassment.
But Harry couldn’t go back. He had this need to know if what he saw in Malfoy’s eyes that night in the elevator was what he thought. If on his side he had come to terms with the fact that he had desperately wanted to kiss him, he wanted Malfoy to prove to him that he was not the only one who thought of it.
The constant urge to touch him, to hold him to calm him down, to tell him that he was there, to comfort him…
“Yes, but for the right reasons. Because I’d rather tell her the truth now than spend the rest of my life letting her think that I’m still in love with her. I just can’t do that to her, and neither can I. We’ve all been through enough in the last few years and I don’t intend to add to that. So, what if it hurts now, what if it takes time, but I can’t hide how I feel about you anymore.”
Draco Malfoy and his ex-Slytherin’s friends sat on the back of a bench, a cigarette in his hand that he carried to his mouth smiling. He took a whiff of it and his eyes set on Harry, who had frozen when he saw him.
Draco swallowed with difficulty, nodding silently in turn, turning away his eyes, suddenly unable to face Harry, to face reality…
"I’m surprised to find you here, I was convinced that you would follow the path of your beloved father," he replied, in a contemptuous tone.
Draco repressed the rage that he felt rising to block it in his throat and thus contain the hateful words that would emerge in a flood of ineptitude that he would regret in the moment. Because Potter didn’t remember. Because the fucking hero of the witch world didn’t know how much he loved him, how happy they were both and how complete they were.
“One of those fucking assholes managed to cast me a fucking spell. But it’s okay, it’s just my leg, the rest is fine.” Harry had then replied, in a tone that was meant to be casual while he forced himself not to wince under the pain.
"You don't think so, this is the fifth time a girl has tried to kiss me because I'm under the mistletoe!" he growled, squinting his eyes behind his round glasses.
Harry flew, on the broom that had belonged to Fred, and his heart, in spite of a little bit of pain at the thought of the deceased twin, filled with joy.
“You can say that, yes, let’s say we’re old acquaintances,” he explained, grabbing a leaf at the top of the pile of scrolls to place it in front of him.
The four of them had been together since the end of Hogwarts and thus the end of the war. It was like writing somewhere that they were meant to be a couple.
Potter, who licked his neck, his teeth biting his flesh to suffocate his moans as his heart beat against his chest echoing against Draco’s bust.
“Bloody hell! Malfoy, let me go, now!” he growled between his teeth, without making the slightest gesture to get rid of his hold.
The lights around them again flickered, triggering a slight sneer from Nott, who seemed to enjoy the show.
Harry grinned slightly, extending his arm to retrieve the book he called silently and then to rest it on the desk.
Harry’s hands were asking for more, scouring the body of the young woman more deeply, looking for the little extra that would make him take off as he had gotten used to doing in Malfoy’s arms. Always trying to reach over and over that moment where his mind would go out and his body would do everything else.
"I’m sorry to disappoint you, but it really wasn’t my intention. I love making you go crazy, it’s so… fascinating" Malfoy sneered.
Draco rushed to Harry to get him out, but he saw the stag load from the corner of his eye and melt on him. It passed through him, grabbing his breath and then blocking it in his lungs.
Blinking, he felt blushed by his similar behavior of the day before, when he had already felt attracted by the sight of Malfoy’s body.
Walking with determination, surpassing the reception and moving through the various corridors of the building, Malfoy had a grin before answering him.
“Please swallow this potion three times a day until it is completely covered.” she ordered, handing him the vial.
In the entrance of the house, there was a loud crack noise, where only the whistling of a log burning in the imposing fireplace of the living room was heard.
They were having lunch and as since the beginning of the week, Harry couldn’t get his eyes off the table in front of him...
“What’s surprising is that this spell is designed to keep the patient in a state of torpor, inviting him to remain resolutely prostrated in this chair until the end of the session and that you, you got out after only a few minutes of your own initiative. If I’m not mistaken, you must certainly have a particular resistance to persuasive spells. It’s a rare ability, and to your credit.” he specified, his dark blue eyes shining with greed.
“Fine, but you’ll always be the pretentious little prick who shared seven years of my life in Hogwarts!” Blaise sneered.
He would have wanted to forget how their bodies had rubbed against each other, the pleasure he had felt when their cocks had touched.
Harry swallowed, contracting all his muscles as his eyes opened wide. Malfoy’s smile doubled as his erection hardened between his fingers. Malfoy started a slow and calculated back-and-forth movement on Harry’s sex, biting his lips, preventing a moan from coming out.
Ron was actually already sitting in one of the armchairs in the living room, sipping a cup of tea in discussion with Malfoy sitting on the couch.
He had not been an exemplary boyfriend for the past few weeks, but Harry was determined to fix it, now that everything was back to normal on his side.
His breath pounded against his chest, while the image of Malfoy playing his tongue with Noah was painted before his eyes, diffused by his sick mind. The light in his hand lost its color to be almost transparent, seeming to blink at times, like a light bulb about to give up the ghost.
She passed her hand in her hair to take it back, directly sending him a slight scent of flower that he so enjoyed. Harry quietly inspired her scent, which immediately relaxed him. He was fully aware of his feelings for Ginny and despite Malfoy, his feelings did not seem to have diminished.
Draco had positioned himself in the center of the room, briefly detailing the decoration he had found to his liking, before putting his grey gaze on the wizard therapist, who had applied himself to having his quill scratched on a parchment.
The exercise turned out to be much less painful than the day before and he managed to say "Hello" in a somewhat hoarse voice, still a little too close to the murmur to his liking.
Harry took a deep breath, swallowing with difficulty, his heart prey to a mad race, before answering.
Draco shyly reached out his hand, intimating him to hold on to it so that he could Side-Along instead of the session. Potter gauged his hand, a resigned look reflected on his features as he approached his hand to hold his wrist. He then got closer to Draco and moved his hand along his arm to grab one of his hips.
His breathing became trapped in his chest as he remembered the last moments in his company when he had allowed himself to be invaded by the pleasure he himself had initiated.
Spreading his fingers, he released his fork, whose imprint was still visible in the hollow of his palm, having pressed it too firmly while he cursed Malfoy during his reflections.
A shout from Ron brought him back to reality and he realized that Ginny was hurrying on his broom. He then distinguished a tiny gold-coloured ball whose wings split the sky at an impressive speed. Harry held his breath, staring at the scene, before rising screaming with joy as Ginny raised her arm in the air, with her fist closed on the Snitch, whose wings were twirling between her fingers.
Harry immediately froze when he saw him sitting on his bed reading a Quidditch magazine nibbling Fizwizbiz.
It was difficult for him to swallow when he felt the red sticking up his cheeks to have so much let things go so badly and tightened his grip on his glass until his fingers completely circle it and his nails got into his skin..
Harry was so impulsive that it was never easy to find out what state of mind he was going to find him in when he got out of bed.
It was after 7:00 p.m., and Harry was slowly walking out of his office dragging a leg behind him. The day had been long and particularly hectic following the mission entrusted to him.
Not losing a second more, he plunged his head into the liquid and was automatically brought into the scene.
He had acquiesced and returned to the Ministry with floo powder as he was unable to Side-Along in his condition. Ron was already there, as well as the various Aurors present at the attack site. He then explained that they had managed to catch the bastards who launched the offensive and that they were currently being sent straight to Azkaban.
Draco, who had followed him with his eyes, sighed as he lowered his head to shake it from left to right, before lifting it up with a weary look.
He lifted the towel which he carelessly threw onto his plate and then cast a "Tergeo" on the blood stain which disappeared instantly. He then turned his hand to expose his palm and cast the spell "Episkey" to heal his wound, which was already beginning to heal.
Harry swallowed his saliva, staring at the black which had definitively replaced the grey in Malfoy’s eyes and felt his body lean forward without doing anything to prevent it.
“That’s the question I was asking myself… I don’t know why I keep talking to you. I’d better get going," Harry said, in a tired tone.
Harry raised his eyes higher to meet the cold, grey gaze that had haunted him since he had returned.
He began to get dressed, making as little noise as possible to avoid waking Malfoy who was sleeping peacefully back to him. The blanket covering half his body, stopping to his hips, revealing his pearly skin that Harry contemplated for a moment, before putting on his t-shirt.
Harry frowned, remembering last night when he really believed that Malfoy was at his bedside while he was sleeping. He was pretty sure it was Malfoy he saw leaving the infirmary when he woke up.
Harry could not help noticing that he seemed even more tired than their last interview and glanced at his hand with rings that swept over his blackened appearance.
Harry had felt a slight pinch in his heart when he saw him go away, but had quickly resumed, silencing that feeling which was not his.
His magic lost its flow, lost its strength, Harry lost his gift while his imagination drove him mad. The tears of anger rose up in his eyes, feeling his power leaving his body, the light in the hollow of his hand fading away. The dizziness took place, blurring the vision of Malfoy and Noah in his mind.
Kissing Malfoy was totally hot. Malfoy’s kisses were feverish and his taste was so good that Harry lost his mind. Malfoy’s hands were already beginning to take off his t-shirt and unbutton his pants, his breath against his mouth becoming shorter and shorter.
She had seemed a bit taken aback at the very beginning but had stretched a very wide smile, discovering all her teeth, and had nodded frantically before saying “yes” and kissing him fiercely.
Harry straightened out slowly and continued his movements on Malfoy’s sex. His breathing was jerky as his eyes met those of Malfoy, darkened by the pleasure he gave him.
And as usual, the words came out before he could hold them. This question was burning his lips that he absolutely had to ask.
More than a month now that Malfoy was acting as if he simply didn’t exist and that had really put his nerves on edge. He didn’t understand at what point Malfoy had decided to simply ignore him.
"Fine! If that's what you want, here you go: Are you gay, Potter?" Draco shouted, arms wide open, face forward.
“The trouble with you, Potter, is that you haven’t through far enough ahead. You don’t know why I joined him, you don’t know what I went through to “deserve it”. So before you jump to conclusions, shut up, it’s best for everyone." Malfoy jeered, staring at the wall.
Harry turned his eyes to Malfoy who seemed to listen attentively to Parkinson’s telling him a story rich in twists and then lowered his eyes to his drink by shrugging his shoulders.
Draco could feel the tension that was pulling all of Harry’s muscles while a dazed look distorted his features.
Harry tensed his hands on his book, the blood flowing quickly along his cock as he bit the inside of his cheek to swallow his urge to get up to touch Malfoy. He wanted to grab his shirt and turn him in front of him and ferociously steal his half-open pale lips that moved while he seemed to recite his course.
The rest of the evening was a little fuzzy, although he remembered very well abusing Malfoy more than reason.
“Oh yeah? Don’t you think it’s strange that at every meal we stuffed Malfoy’s face and his asshole friends? They can’t go and eat any further?” Ron jeered, wrinkling.
“That’s correct. I’m delighted that you take it as a reference, I myself would not have found a better way to explain how this potion works.”
Draco had learned to overcome his fears by working with Harry, because he always helped him to show the best of himself, repeating to him that he was a good person and that it was normal to have moments of weakness.
Harry picked it up twice, leaning excessively up and down, but couldn’t find it. He frowned, thinking that they must have forgotten his name in the list, when close steps made him turn his head to the side.
Blaise’s face lit up as a smirk gradually stretched his lips, revealing his white teeth denoting the dark color of his skin.
“I didn’t anticipate all these details when I proposed. I sincerely thought she didn’t care about this kind of festivities.” he confessed, lowering his fingers under his nose. “I guess that you never really know someone even after several years…”
“Charming, Potter…Really…but that doesn’t give you the right to force me to wank you” Malfoy insisted.
Malfoy attempted a move in his direction but Harry held out his wand to prevent him from going further.
“By the way,” he shouted, on the back of Malfoy who tensed a second before relaxing. “Congratulations!” he added, in a less loud voice.
took him in his arms, behind him, his head resting on his shoulder. They were laughing. Then Harry put a light kiss on Malfoy’s cheek, then Malfoy turned his head and gently grabbed his lips to kiss him.
The wizard therapist then began a wrist gesture that made Harry tense a little more, expecting the worst, when a box of tissues materialized on the small coffee table in front of him.
Harry lowered his eyes on Malfoy’s already hard cock, lifting one of his hands up to his mouth to pull his glove with his teeth and spit it on the side. He then surrounded Malfoy’s dick between his fingers, giving a slight wrist stroke that made him jerk and moan.
“You must be really worried about using that nickname against your boyfriend… I highly doubt he appreciates you using his name and reputation to find out more about him… Is he even aware that you came here?” Theo had jeered, putting his teeth on his lips, visibly delighted to see him so uncomfortable.
Regaining his wits, he hastened to follow him but he did not have time to catch up with him that already Harry locked himself in their room by slamming the door. Draco, who had almost reached it, stretched his arm to grab the handle but suspended his gesture, before closing his fingers in the void.
“I better go too. Astoria hates me coming home late.” he added, recovering his cape from one of the wooden knobs.
This asshole smiled, participated in the discussion led by Zabini without ever paying attention to him. Yet Harry was sure he could feel his murderous gaze pressure on his profile. He was all the more aware that Malfoy probably saw him from the corner of his eye, as he had seen him settle down a few moments earlier.
“You’re not entirely wrong, Potter, but Theo excelled in this field, far more than all Slytherins put together. By the way, your level wasn’t the worst Draco” he admitted.
“Ginny, Mom asks for your help downstairs, I hear you’re doing dishes.” Ron’s voice sneered, behind the door.
Harry had always been clumsy in his way of expressing himself. He did not think about how to turn his sentence so that it came out well-worded and smooth. All the words that came out of his mouth were raw and brutal, without any filter to soften them.
Too stubborn to let go, he grabbed his magic wand and cast a spell of silence on it before beginning to cast different spells on the protective barrier, in the hope that it will eventually weaken under the shock.
Draco raised his eyebrows at the pronounced discomfort Potter seemed to feel. This was not the first time since the beginning of the evening. To think about it, it began just after it had been removed from the memory in which he was immersed. Draco had immediately noticed how embarrassed Harry had seemed to discover this moment of his past.
Harry squinted his eyes, following his move, before turning his face towards him again, raising his brow, skeptically.
Harry was suffering from this situation. He couldn’t bring himself to sleep with Ginny when he was thinking about Malfoy, but he couldn’t stop seeing him. He felt in the depths of his being that if he suspended everything, he would lose his oxygen, one more reason to live on this blooded planet, one reason to have survived this fucking war.
“Just because you told me the truth. I never thought you’d be able to, but you were right about seventh year, the Astronomy Tower and-” he interrupted, obviously unable to continue.
Harry contracted his jaw and continued on his way to an indefinite destination before finally stopping at the bar. He ordered mead and almost drowned in it hoping someone would get it out. And that someone sat beside him, barely two minutes later. Malfoy, still oozing and euphoric of his hypnotic dance, ordered in his turn a drink with a gasping voice.
“Calm down” made Malfoy’s voice strangely soft behind him. “I’m sure they’ll find them” he added, in a more dragging and sustained tone.
He walked to the centre of the circular room which he had visited a lot since the beginning of the year.
Harry felt the corner of his lips quiver and could not hold back the smile that stretched them. He then passed a hand under his glasses and put it on his eyes as he sighed.
The slight rustling of a cloth grazed his ears, indicating that he had to be partially conscious and therefore not completely asleep.
Potter pointed to a tall brown man sitting at a remote office of theirs who greeted him politely, not without a remark to Potter, about his shitty humor.
Harry lost his mind, and all that he had so far contained rose up in his throat, inevitably making him lose his mind even more.
"You’re not joining us?" Malfoy asked, who had obviously abused witch cigarettes to offer them such an invitation.
and don’t you dare come back! Anyway, I’d be too busy “spreading my thighs” to welcome you if you ever decide to take responsibility for the facts!” Malfoy hissed, a deep contempt in the voice.
“I don’t know what he took from you but you’re not in your normal state, you don’t know what you’re doing” Draco said.
“Oh you two are pissing me off, I’d rather go study my next class than hear you get mad at them again” Hermione sighed, grabbing his tray and rising to head for the exit.
The opposing team scored another goal reducing the gap to four out of five for Ginny’s team. It was very tight and it proved the top level of the various players.
Draco Malfoy stood to his right, a grin adorning his lips, dressed in a dark three-piece suit, bringing out the pale of his skin and the whiteness of his blond hair.
Harry’s breath stuck in his as he stared at that grey-angled gaze. Her hands had become sweaty and the one still holding the door, slipped a little around the handle.
Draco Malfoy Side-Along appeared to his office. Not a very nice place at first. It was a large, dilapidated building used as a lure to the Muggles. Dummies in poor condition strolled behind the store window.
The kiss was fiery and just as desperate as their gestures. For too long Draco had wanted Harry and kept suppressing his desire to touch him, to have Potter against him.
No matter how much he screamed, he didn’t even know if the sounds were coming out of his mouth or from his thoughts.
Harry’s wand flew in the air. A cry of joy escaped from Neville’s lips, irremediably happy to have disarmed Harry.
His short trips to the bathroom didn’t really count and he didn’t want to sink like a fool the first time he went out.
And when Malfoy’s moans became more raucous and Harry’s hand accelerated his friction a little more, Malfoy stopped kissing him and bit Harry's neck to shout and cum between his fingers.
“Careful, it may be that one day she has already prepared the ceremony and you may have to celebrate it right away!” Neville added, giggling.
It was terribly frustrating to come into a world where everything, including your friends, your ideas and your perception had abruptly changed…
Harry stared at him for a moment, his smile still stuck to his lips and then also turned his head to follow the speech. He had a feeling of well-being that surrounded him as his heart began to beat harder in his chest. He hadn’t felt that way in weeks.
And Potter, he was leaving, he was going away and he wouldn't have his answer… It was inconceivable, he needed his fucking answer!
“It’s already been an hour, I took the opportunity to go round the classrooms and find out where I was staying. Sorry, Ron, but the rooms are not mixed.”
“When I think of all the times we were bitching about Hogwarts' schedules…” Ron said sarcastically, eyes fixed on the timetable.
Harry took the opportunity to pick up his wand which he had been forced to leave for his visit to the wizard therapist because it’s not allowed during consultations.
His hand on the handle, he opened the door and froze for a moment before turning his head slightly to the side.
He then took a deep breath, before putting his hand on Harry’s shoulder to pull him towards him and pull him out once and for all of this bloody Pensieve.
Harry nodded but didn’t move. His eyes had not left the group that was now melting in the shade of the trees bordering the campus. A light breeze reminded him that he was cold and they hurried back to warm.
He wanted to scream but the words were stuck in his throat. He could see nothing more than all those memories that were tirelessly spinning under his eyelids, cluttering his ears to prevent him from hearing what was going on around him.
Harry waited a little while, giving him an interrogative gaze before going deeper. Malfoy breathed strongly, biting his lower lip, his fingers squeezing the sheets of his bed, looking at the ceiling above him. He closed his eyes a few seconds before anchoring them in Harry’s and smiling at him slightly.
But before he could repair his impulse of feelings, Potter’s voice resounded in the room, making him tenser to make him close his eyes expecting the scathing reply he knew.
Harry then pointed his cock right in front of Malfoy’s hole, breathing hardly. His jaw was twitching with apprehension and he moved on to Malfoy again, one hand on his sex guiding it on his interstice, the other clinging next to his face, with his arm outstretched.
“I don’t want to interrupt this wonderful moment, but I’ll let Kingsley know about your condition, Harry, maybe we’ll find some answers on our side. And I would really like to get this cleared up as quickly as possible…” Ron announced, scraping his throat through the door.
It was like a gaping hole oozing in place of his heart, an open wound that was bleeding as Malfoy did not blink and stared at him with that smug look that would harden his features, making him dreadfully horrible.
“Are you saying that it was someone outside the castle who took advantage of my trip to Hogsmeade to pour it into the Cauldron Cakes?” Harry asked, following with his eyes the little Cauldron Cakes fly from the bag to land on the desk in a straight line.
“You’re not in a position to talk, so shut up and let me take you to the hospital, is that clear?” Ron had hissed, turning him enough to plunge his blue eyes into his own.
He turned his attention to his scroll and then dipped his quill in his inkwell by draining the tip to avoid the drops of ink and continued to scratch on the paper.
Harry turned his eyes away from the armchair and placed them on the imposing black desk, also in moldings, where a multitude of files of all kinds, of which his must have been included.
He promised to be more careful, because if Ron had realized that something was going on, Hermione for his part would have felt it for miles around and she was much more perceptive than the two of them combined.
Harry repressed a pout of disgust at the thought of being emotionally attached to him. Not that the fact that he was a man was disturbing, although it was still quite surprising, but the mere fact that it was Draco Malfoy, his enemy since his eleven years after Voldemort, was more than terrifying.
“Well they’re wrong, I’m just another student and I also need to study to improve, it’s not innate!” he protested, raising his eyes to the ceiling.
"Malfoy, do you realize how stupid your question is," he sneered, wiping a tear at the corner of his eye.
“Absolutely. This was not the case before you did it, but you yourself created an opening to another universe simply by using your subconscious.” he explained, passing his wand on the pile of Cauldron Cakes on his left to the right to demonstrate his theory.
Harry, on the other hand, was not as relieved as he would have liked. Apparently he was fine, but it still didn’t explain what he was doing there when he remembered being with Malfoy and they—
Harry breathed heavily while a nascent headache, turning his head a little more, making him nauseous. He beat eyelids, a few red drops fell on the beige notebook, impregnating it with more colored liquid this time.
Harry wasn’t following the game at all. He could no longer hear the students shouting in the stands around them. A hand on his shoulder brought him to his senses, making him look away and lay his eyes on Ron, who was smiling to his teeth.
“I get the distinct impression that our evenings are quite similar. I would bet the most expensive cauldron that Astoria is handling the table allocation right now.” he grinned, rolling his eyes slightly but enough for Harry to notice.
They settled in silence, him in one of the armchairs near the fireplace, while Harry sat on the couch.
Harry winced to be so transparent and tried to lessen his feelings about what Ginny had been doing to him for the past few weeks.
A young woman presented the upcoming news in the coming months and showed the various news of what she was reporting. An image of the next titanium cauldron then took place in the centre of the page. A wizard then appeared, pouring all kinds of ingredients inside before displaying the exorbitant price of this fabulous product.
Harry didn’t know if the real cause of his heartbeat was running after Malfoy to catch up with him or just running into him when he was dying to since he got back.
He was so upset that he drank the wrong way and rested his cup while coughing before clearing his throat and swallowing his saliva.
Of his last memories, the Dark Lord was building an army, gathering as many Death Eaters as he could. Terrorizing Muggles and ransacking cities with black magic to show his many powers and power unparalleled over the centuries.
He trembled with anticipation to know that he would find him to share their forbidden passion, letting it swallow him up, devour him whole.
Malfoy had then put the knife down and handed him half a loaf of bread spread, biting one bite into the other to show him that he had nothing to fear.
He prepared the next ingredients by lifting from time to time the head towards the clock hanging on the wall in front of him.
Harry watched him bend the cup slightly to his lips to swallow a sip and slowly rest it on the table while contemplating the bottom.
“I am indeed referring to our years in Hogwarts, but as I told you we weren’t so close, we didn’t even share the same dormitory.” He explained, dipping the feather in its ink.
He gently pushed Malfoy’s arm to the side to bring it back along his flank and carefully disengaged from his accidental embrace by shifting to the side. Harry got up with his hands and took great care not to touch Malfoy when he got out of bed.
Once his friends leave by floo, not without a last hug from Hermione and a heavy gaze from Ron, Harry waited patiently for Malfoy’s return, again roaming the room, looking for other clues that might put him on the path to his situation.
have changed! You’re 26 now, you have a full life and you’ve decided not to interfere with these cases when you were 18, so just let the pros do their job now, all right?” Ron replied, in a firm tone.
Harry blinked several times while the information reached his brain, still too obsessed with his recent troubles. He finally made the connection and turned his eyes to Ron before lowering them again on his food.
Harry was doing everything he could to get Malfoy out of his head, but he was obviously not determined to leave him alone... He kept seeing Malfoy pass by, his seductive smile on his fucking lips that he had tasted and enjoyed the times when he had kissed them.
Harry closed his eyes, remembering the blood on the tile, Malfoy’s already white body losing little of its colors, while he died in front of him, by his fault, by his hands...
He was still struggling to realize what had just happened when he, in turn, grabbed a handful of powder and threw it into the hearth in front of him while whispering the name of his destination before entering the flames.
Other students had the same idea and walked between the alleys of the campus, talking about things and other things, or had breakfast on the adjacent tables.
No one moved, too shocked by the scene unfolding in front of them. Malfoy and Potter spoke without insulting each other! It had never happened and it was really special.
The beating of his heart redoubled before the intensity of the emotions he felt thinking of all the times when he had wanted Malfoy. The pressing need to find him to make him pay for this obsession, this addiction that slowly breathed into his veins, spreading its venom in his blood to control his desires.
He didn’t want to go back to his dorm, Ron had probably gone to sleep at Hermione’s like almost every night. He didn’t want to be alone in his bed with Malfoy’s visions, his voice in his ear telling him to let himself be done...
It was powerful and didn’t seem to want to be so easily tamed. Harry grabbed his arm with his other hand to keep him from shaking and give him some stability. The magical flux appeared between his fingers, still weak though, but well present in his palm.
“Merlin’s balls, I’ve never said I didn’t, but he is there very often and he sometimes looks at you and you look at him sometimes.” Ron insisted heavily, glaring at him.
Harry focused on Ginny, spinning in the air under the dark late afternoon sky. The days had been terribly shortened in this month of January, revealing the moon before the end of the day.
Harry was moaning as he tasted the lips of Malfoy that he had been thinking of for several weeks... He had missed them too much...
“For my part, I don’t know him at all and I don’t care at all that he is part of a line of pure bloods, as long as I've seen him, I don’t like him at all, his behavior disgusts me to death” Harry hissed, staring at him.
So Harry forgot his thoughts and focused on the moment that Malfoy offered him, penetrating his body and sharing this moment of intoxicating pleasure.
According to his behavior, Draco’s suspicions about Harry’s desire for him were confirmed, but far from him the idea of using it against his will.
He then stretched the boiling cup to Harry, who grabbed it by touching his fingers, jumping to the touch, missing to let go of the container, before bringing it back to him with his head slightly turned to the side, avoiding his gaze.
Yes, Harry didn’t know exactly why Malfoy had allied himself with Voldemort’s cause, but it didn’t matter to him at the time, the damage was done, he had chosen his clan and it wasn’t his.
Malfoy’s eyes squinted dangerously, staring at him a few seconds before a wince stretched his mouth into a disgusted pout.
Harry couldn’t help laughing at the bickering of his best friends, who usually annoyed him but who finally missed him in a few days. They were finally behaving in a way that seemed familiar to him and he felt much more serene to see them like that.
Harry turned his eyes to Parkinson, who stared at him with a sneaky air, her lashes tightly tightened leaving only a glimpse of light between her eyelids.
"I’m tired of fighting, it’s just-" he began, turning his eyes to a corner of the room and squeezing his lips tightly.
It was 6:00 p.m. when Harry and Ron finally got out of their last class. Exhausted, but brains well imbued, they spoke with liveliness of their new lessons.
The only thing he was particularly sure of was seeing Malfoy again being a fucking shock to which his head and heart were obviously unprepared.
“Come on, it’s time to go” Draco added, as he got up to head for the door. He opened the door wide before moving to the side and then turned around completely to encourage Harry to cross it.
Draco’s shoulders were slowly sagging, and he released the pressure on Harry’s wrists, who took advantage of it to free himself completely. They stared like this for a few moments. Draco holding his breath before the unmistakably determined look of Potter.
Frowning, Harry blinked with both incomprehension and anger. Parkinson did not blink, she looked down on him passing her tiny dark eyes over his entire face and detailed his features, as if to guess his emotions.
By the time of Hogwarts, all the students were there to watch a game, mixing up all the houses, regardless of which one was fighting.
"More seriously, I can't stand this mistletoe bullshit! Even Ron is ready to play! I was sure with you at least I wouldn't have a problem with it" he explained, sighing.
Not hearing anything particular, he took care to knock slightly to signify his presence and opened the door delicately to sink inside. It was dark. Only the low brightness of the living room gave a glimpse of the furniture in the room.
Then Malfoy got a little closer, a few strands of his hair tickling his neck, where he dropped a slight kiss from the tip of his lips.
So much time wasted trying to prove that he was right. So many times he had insisted to Ron and Hermione about that bloody mark on Malfoy’s arm when it wasn’t.
They had then landed at St Mungo’s where a medical team had taken care of him and placed him on a stretcher before taking him to a room where they had stabilized his leg with a spell.
Later that evening, Harry convinced himself that an explanation with Malfoy was necessary. He had to talk to him and set the record straight.
Harry glanced at her briefly before turning to Hermione, who seemed troubled to have been so sharply interrupted in the middle of his question, for information that should not have been in the discussion.
But his desire for Malfoy had overtaken his reason and Harry had let himself be carried away by it, never to rise again.
Draco, surreptitiously closed his eyes to the sound that resonated between the walls, then immediately reopened them, his heart bursting in his chest.
Draco quickly walked into the kitchen, took two cups and the teapot on a tray  he had prepared before Ron arrived, and set off again towards the living room, his heart beating faster than it should.
“Ron’s right, Harry. The reason Dumbledore called you into his office tonight is because he’s got to have a theory.” Hermione added, with a small encouraging smile.
As he continued his inspection, another object attracted his attention, a transparent jar with a crystal stopper, filled with a strangely vaporous liquid. Harry fixed it for a few moments before reaching out to remove the cap, intrigued by what was in it.
Harry sighed heavily before laying his eyes on the wedding photo of Ron and Hermione who sat on a corner of his desk. He stretched a slight smile in front of the winces of his best friend and the outraged look of Hermione when she noticed him before hitting him gently on the head.
The lights of the room began to flicker dangerously as Harry felt his anger rise into a magical stream throughout his body, clutching fists to try to contain it.
His pulse had accelerated sharply and his compressed lungs altered his breathing under the frigid atmosphere between them. Yet he was unable to dislodge the anger and pain that had gripped his being and his heart since noon. Even after trying to calm that disproportionate feeling he felt when he saw Malfoy.
“You’re not going to make me think you give a shit about my life” he retorted, planting his eyes in his own.
He clasped his tongue on the roof of his mouth and dismayed himself for having lost himself in his reflections long enough to completely ruin his potion.
But when you had just left the woman who has shared your life now for six years, it was hard to imagine recovering so quickly…
“Believe what you want, but I assure you there is nothing. Malfoy makes his life on his side and I make mine.”
He walked up to the door and was about to open it when the wizard therapist’s voice was ringing in his back.
“We are in agreement!” Hermione nodded to cut short the conversation, “I’ll leave you too, I have my first witch law’s class.” ».
The therapist sneered again, scratching the tip of his pen on the parchment before raising his head in his direction.
Malfoy groaned against his lips, his hand was almost no longer holding his own, only his fingers still surrounded his own, but not enough to continue guiding them. It was Harry who rubbing his hand against Malfoy’s sex. And he liked it, feel the heat emanating from his bloody dick. He was excited to know that it was
Harry swallowed in front of so much zeal while they were at the table in the presence of her brothers and parents, he probably had forsaken Ginny too long for her to react in this way.
“We’ve talked about this before, Ron, I’m sure of what I’m saying!” Harry claimed, following the point on the map.
“So keep me informed, I’m tired of always taking the first step... For once I’ll not move and I’ll wait for you!” the named Noah affirmed.
“Holy shit, Harry! What happened?” he had asked, worried as he passed his arm around his shoulders to support him.
Without knowing it, Malfoy had just touched something that he felt contracting painfully in him, taking his breath and twisting his bowels to an almost throbbing pain that reverberated directly into his heart.
“Absolutely fine! I have so many requests, I can even get late in my deliveries!" George answered, with pride.
“Fuck it! Come on! Stop making yourself pray and get your ass back! …. And before you open it again, it’s not a question!” Ron ended, seeing Harry about to retaliate.
Draco folded and unfolded his hand, feeling the heat of the spell spreading under the pores of his skin, immediately healing the crack in the center of his palm to leave no trace of it.
Harry, still motionless, didn’t move. Then, after a few seconds, consented to blink his eyelids in a calculated slowness.
Harry tensed up on his chair. He turned slightly to watch them settle down. In particular Malfoy who slowly removed his scarf to gently place it on the edge of the table before take off his gloves.
He was in love with someone else and had only just realized it when all the evidence showed that he had been in love with that person for years.
He thought he saw the outline of a smile on Potter’s lips, a small victory for Draco who had not seen a single one except those filled with scorn appear on his face.
The assumption that ten years had passed seemed increasingly plausible in view of their physical changes.
“I’m talking about your inability to control your magic flow when you’re upset. Like when you inflated your aunt…” the young man specified, insinuating the extent of the information he possessed.
Malfoy appeared in the frame and his face seemed to decompose for a second before a smirk took place on his lips.
“I don’t know, Harry, but this person definitely knew what she was doing by integrating it into yours.” Dumbledore sighed, resting his hand on his desk.
Gently loosening his fingers, he winced when he felt a slight scrape foretelling him that he must have damaged his skin. He brought his hand back to him, and examined the cut in the corner of his palm, and then turned his eyes to the wall to see that a few drops of blood were spreading there, just where a small crack had formed.
Draco waited for him to calm down a little before loosening his hand and finally releasing it, standing straight up and looking down on him.
“Eat, you must be hungry” he correctly pointed out, leaning over to take one of the cups of tea before sitting comfortably in his seat.
He looked outside, in the different alleys where Malfoy and his friends liked to hang out. In the dining hall where he often saw them smoking and laughing. No one... not Malfoy’s shadow on the horizon.
He sighed at what appeared to be Harry’s anxiety attack. He knew his temper, for he often bore the brunt of it when they were younger. Once had been one too many and had almost killing him.
"How could I miss this headline? How come everyone knows but me?" he exclaimed, pressing his hand a little more into his hair.
“That fucking ferret never knew how to do anything but make a show of himself, especially if it’s in his interest, he goes all the way” Harry spit out loud, enough for Malfoy to hear before he overtakes them.
Malfoy then put his lips on the fine skin of his sex and Harry blew a small acute moan. His eyelids beat frantically under the sensations that Malfoy gave him of his expert tongue, so damp, so hot, and terribly skillful...
"You understand why I was so surprised that you didn't know!" Potter exclaimed, with a movement of his hand.
Draco sneered, looking up at the sky to see that Potter was standing where he had been a few minutes earlier.
Not that he was not interested in Ron’s story, but since Saturday night it was very difficult for him to focus on what surrounded him.
He was flying on his Firebolt, giving direction to his team during a Quidditch workout when the slight squeak of a door that opens sounds inside his skull.
An acid taste rose up into his throat, coming directly from his stomach, prompting him to rise quickly to expel it.
Harry felt his heart beating louder in his chest without understanding the reason as he lowered his eyes on Malfoy’s lips.
Harry wicked at him and turned to the bar to order his drink. Malfoy followed him and settled by his side; his mocking smile still stuck to his bloody lips.
"So what?" Harry asked, rising up on the back of the sofa, his bust going forward with apprehension.
"Don’t you dare touch me again, Malfoy! I’m not your friend and I’ll never be your friend, that’s for sure!" Harry threatened.
“Well, Mr. Potter, it looks like you’re almost out of the woods. Apart from a few minor injuries, the rest works perfectly!” She said, nodding her head.
Harry listened to him without blinking, reminded the sensation of tranquility that had invaded him for a moment, enclosing him in a cocoon where he felt safe, somewhat blurring his thoughts.
explain to me what is happening here, I don’t understand anything anymore..." Harry added, hoping she can help him see things through.
He saw Malfoy clearly sketch a thin smile on his lips, his grey eyes filled with a deep sympathy which he did not know.
It was wrong, he knew it, it was abject to let go that way. But the more Malfoy touched him, the more he discovered new sensations.
But Harry was scared. Because it was Malfoy and he didn’t trust him at all. And even though he desperately wanted it and his lust for him was bordering on indecency, their relationship was based only on sex, nothing more.
Ron was still as tall, looked more adult, his face still as dotted with freckles, his features a little more marked than in his memories. His build, too, seemed much fleshier. He had visibly gained muscle.
He have felt the pent-up desire of Malfoy whirling in his memory, fear and desire to continue kissing him.
Harry shook his fists glaring at Noah when he reached his height. He frowned, seeming not to understand and looking down on Harry.
Or rather, he played the scene in slow motion. Half conscious, he was looking for the flaw that had turned everything around.
Sitting on one of the benches in the park, his hands in the pockets of his pants, he looked at the trees rocked by the light breeze that touched his face and closed his eyes under this pleasant caress. He reopened them to look at the water bordering one of the aisles of the campus and stared at the few ducks swimming.
Dropping his hair, his arms down his body, Harry stuck the back of his skull against the cold tile of the shower, resigned by what his heart proved to him.
Admitting that he might not have a better time to do so, he took a deep breath and decided to drop everything.
They made them visit the new storefronts of the store, made up of all sorts of more improbable objects than each other. Most of them moved by themselves, as if animated, materializing the effects they produced once used.
He obviously did not find him and sneered inwardly for thinking that Malfoy was really coming to have a drink with him. He finished cleaning the last ashes on his sleeves and then took a quick step towards the bar.
Harry stilled. It had already been two months since he met Malfoy in his dormitory in order to satisfy their common desire. So he knew all too well how Malfoy behaved in bed. Although Harry was always on top, it didn’t take anything away from the fact that Malfoy was particularly hot and made him take off every time they saw each other.
What Zabini meant was that apart from the fact that my sexual preferences were in the papers, I had been thinking about someone for a while, and when the news came out, none of my close friends were really surprised. Neither do your friends apparently…"
The position was not unpleasant, even though the weight was more present now that he had realized it. This movement disturbed him more than he should have, accentuating the strange complicity that settled between them.
“Gentlemen, please, this is neither the place nor the time to argue about what just happened. Mr. Weasley, please resume your seat. As for Mr. Potter, put your mess away and concentrate more to prevent it from happening again.” shouted their teacher across the classroom, startling them both.
Ron tried to say no, but he finally admitted that he would be more useful in the field than waiting wisely for someone to take care of him. He had promised to come back to see him after everything had been settled and Harry had acquiesced before throwing him out of the way.
It was like taking a cold shower, like waking up in the middle of the night after a bad dream. All the sensations of pleasure burst away and left nothing but cold that surrounded him all.
He felt his stomach contract painfully at the fact that he had wanted to know the taste of Malfoy and that he had started to get hard just thinking about touching his bloody lips.
Harry had always had great regard for Neville. Especially since last year when, thanks to him, a horcrux had been killed. And not just any… That fucking Nagini.
He felt less alone now, surrounded by a loved one whom he recognized, someone who had not changed, a pillar which he desperately needed to move on.
The picture of the nightstand came to his mind. What if it were true? If really ten years of his life had been taken from him? Ron and Hermione seemed to believe it, too, and Harry had no reason not to trust them.
He felt sucked in, his internal organs completely overturned. After the unpleasant familiar impression, they found themselves in front of the window where the naked dummies, in a pitiful state, were waiting for them.
The fire took on a greenish color and after a few seconds, a familiar face materialized before them.
The pain that had taken possession of his heart seemed to be digging a deeper abyss as he thought of him, gradually crumbling his hopes of seeing Potter one day again himself.
“That, you see, I doubt…I refuse to be associated with someone as treacherous as you!” He jeered, with disgust.
“In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve been extremely patient with you, and I’m tired of having to stop at the limit of what you’ve imposed” Malfoy jeered, staring at him with his grey eyes.
Draco gauged himself one last time, pulling on the edges of his jacket to put it straight, chasing the few folds in places and consenting to leave the bathroom, a ball forming in his stomach.
A faint smile was born on his lips, thinking of what Potter had said at the trial of his parents and his own. As if his mother had allowed the Order to win the war and without her and Draco nothing would have been possible.
He remembered that Harry had confessed to him that he too had a dark side, that all who thought him a
A tally had been started by most of the students around them, the large wall clock, indicating that it would soon be midnight.
He did not want to rush Harry by telling him about the trouble he had felt earlier during their altercation. Draco knew it was new to him, he remembered again the first time he had could feel the envy he had for him and he had answered in favor of it…
“I swear you, Mione, he had almost scared me with his “look how I’ve changed, I’ve become a junkie”” Ron mimicked with a chicken leg in his hands.
He took a deep breath, blocking it in his lungs, trying to make the emptiness in his too eventful mind and slowly exhaled after a few seconds.
After his last hour of the day, he was getting ready to go to eat when Malfoy appeared in front of him, startling him.
“Okay, bad idea… I won’t talk about it anymore, but look out for her, okay? Because if you ever hurt her, you’ll have to deal with me, best friend or not!” Ron retorted, pointing his finger at him.
Harry made a slight movement of his hand toward the candlestick, which cooled immediately, but did not freeze. A light powder fell on it as his magic reduced in the palm of his hand.
Blinking, he straightened himself out slowly before jumping on Draco and pinning him against the corridor wall.
"But what the hell do you care since it's ridiculous, I tell you," Draco replied, not understanding Potter's infatuation with a simple question.
Harry retreated, abruptly pulling Malfoy’s collar towards him, his knees scraping the ground, making him groan.
“You really have the gift of dramatizing everything… You had a little loss of control, it happens to everyone and it did nothing to me but a slight wound, nothing serious in the end” he argued, cleaning the blood stain on the table.
Harry was biting his lips watching Malfoy lose his mind. It was he who made him moan with pleasure with his hand. And he liked it, he liked it to do Malfoy good. Because it made him beautiful, it made him more desirable than he already was in his eyes.
Harry squinted his eyes, realizing that he was playing the fool and fully understood who he was referring to.
As usual, he was sitting outside smoking among his acolytes who laughed and looked at him with pride. Malfoy remained their prince even after Hogwarts, he was their pillar, their culmination to all.
Malfoy sighed, surreptitiously closing his eyes and immediately opened them on his book before settling to answer him.
Harry smiled and sighed at ease as his hand moved toward his groin. He imagined his feminine curves that he had finally learned through their various lovemaking, while rolling his fingers over his cock, and began to move his hand.
Harry laid his owns on her, scouring her feminine forms, appreciating them, but the passion was not the same as when his fingers stroked Malfoy’s soft skin.
“Don’t worry, mate, we’re not going to ask you to sing Hogwarts' anthem to make sure you can talk again.” Ron laughed, chewing a Chocolate Frog on a chair by his side.
But he seemed so much more confident of himself… and more importantly, he had a way of looking at him that wasn’t at all the same as in the past…
He was still sitting on the floor, his knees bent over himself, supporting his head with his hands when the elementary magic teacher arrived to open his class.
Harry, who was too absorbed in his movements, did not immediately understand what he was doing, then shook his head to come to his senses and frowned.
His eyelids lowered slowly under the touch and he leaned his head slightly to the side to take advantage of this hand that inflamed all his senses. He then picked up his own to put it on, grabbing Potter’s fingers and squeezing them between his fingers. He gently shifted them to his mouth to gently kiss them with the tip of his lips.
Harry scraped his throat before swallowing the rest of the saliva mixed with the last drops of potions and tried to pronounce a few words.
Harry was surprised to appreciate this closeness which at first repulsed him. The feeling of discomfort was always present, but the scent of Malfoy mixed with the warmth of his body against his had something soothing and he almost wanted to close his eyes to sigh.
“If during your task you are not satisfied with the result, you can always go back and pronounce the
It drained him of smiling, while the fear ate his bowels but he did not want to worry more his friends who had spent two months moping over his health.
Harry gauged this hand for a moment before deigning to hold it briefly, quickly loosening his grip to bring his arm back to his side.
Harry gauged the pale hand with long thin fingers before advancing his arm in turn and grabbing Malfoy’s wrist further, unwilling to experience sensations that would still make him uncomfortable when he touched his skin against his own.
“But… it’s impossible… I can’t want what happened! There must be a mistake!” Harry retorted in a breath, an insurmountable fear taking him to the guts as he stared at the Cauldron Cakes.
He had fallen asleep with his glasses on his nose, too exhausted to have had the strength to remove them when Dumbledore had left him.
He took advantage of this to free himself from Malfoy’s embrace and stumbled back, with very short breath, his mouth burning. Harry passed his fingers over it, then into his hair, his eyes fixed on the ground, spread with terror.
He tried to refocus himself after being excluded from his previous course and bring down the magical power that had possessed him. Harry could still feel it tingling his skin, like small pins and needles that numbed all his limbs.
How could he have done this to her... How could he have let Malfoy touch him when he felt nothing for him?
She had decided not to do her 7th year at Hogwarts and to join the Quidditch section directly at the Witch Academy.
Draco blinked several times, feeling the information materialize in his mind. His heart suddenly began to beat harder, spilling into his temples.
Yeah, Malfoy was the only one making him feel all this at once, and Harry was so pissed that he was haunted by him, his
Music of the evening’s news flash rang out just above his head and Harry looked up to watch the wizard network.
Harry squeezed his teeth thinking it hadn’t been so horrible after all. As much as he tried to spit on it to comfort himself, he knew it was not entirely true. He had begun to appreciate this improved version of Malfoy and a little more than he ever thought…
Harry had a hiccup of surprise when he felt his cock swell in his pants, as his nails entered the flesh of his palms of a hatred too long repressed.
It was more complicated than it seemed. Since he had seen Malfoy teasing him at breakfast, he spent his time crossing him. That bloody git was everywhere! However, they didn’t have their lessons in the same place. From what he knew, Malfoy and his friends were housed in the buildings farthest from the campus.
He crossed the hall, came to the atrium and carefully avoided the pressing glances of the visitors who stared at him without restraint.
He was a tall young man, with short brown hair framing a slim and fine face with soft features, although very masculine.
Harry instantly froze in front of the proximity, which had yet nothing special compared to everything else they had shared in the evening. He noticed that he did not feel Malfoy’s body behind his back, since he was obviously not attached to him. Only his arm was in direct contact with his skin and diffused a gentle warmth there.
With difficulty swallowing the last piece of bun, he had rubbed his fingers to drop the encrusted crumbs, and in turn had stood up beside him.
When Harry lowered his eyes again to Malfoy, he froze when he noticed that Malfoy was watching him. Harry frowned when he saw a malicious smile stretching his lips. He then saw Malfoy grabbing his neighbour’s neck and kissing him on his mouth without leaving Harry’s eyes.
“You know… repressing one’s impulses is terribly bad for mental health,” Malfoy replied, ironically.
“I do know the terms of the contract that bind you, but I had nevertheless hoped that in memory of the good old days you would have broken the rules for one of your old acquaintances and especially for a colleague” he had tried, in half a smile.
"Yeah! Since I tell you that they do it to piss us off, I'm convinced!" Ron claimed, with a big gesture of the hand.
With his breath suddenly jerking, he heard Malfoy rise up behind him and turn to see him head towards the entrance and take off his coat before putting it on. He then grabbed the leather jacket next to it and threw it without looking at him.
Harry discovered new ways of taking pleasure and he liked it, he liked what Malfoy showed him. And he wanted more.
Harry remembered seeing it the many times they had never reached the bed to engage in their sexual practices. He remembered looking at it in detail when he was breathing back against Malfoy’s shoulder and found it really pretty.
Biting cold from the outside reminding him of the gentle warmth that his arm spread against his flank. He managed with great difficulty to silence the desire to find Malfoy’s sheets to stick against his body and find his cocoon.
While all the utensils were sharpening around him, he went to the sink to splash fresh water on his face, basking in the goodness of the water as it dripped down his skin. He then took a cloth to sponge off the few drops that were slipping on his face and sighed into the cloth that he kept for a moment against his skin, with his eyes closed.
Harry blinked his eyes, not realizing what he had just witnessed and realized that he had stopped breathing, so he took a deep breath before exhaling long in silence.
“If you think I’m going to let you attack me without defending me, you are sadly mistaken,” Harry hissed, glaring at him.
Harry frowned, noticing that he was not alone. A young man was following him closely, grabbing his hand in his run and shoving it in his, pulling him towards him to grab him in his arms.
He arranged the plates and the various elements of the dishes, and he made the food in the cupboards and the fridge float alternately, placing them on the table in the centre of the room. As soon as he had put the water to heat in the teapot on the stove fire, a sound behind his back suggested that Potter had just joined him.
Harry nodded, suppressing a sigh of relief while the tension that bound his muscles slowly diminished.
“Well, you see, I may be wrong, although this happens only very rarely, but I hypothesize that you found yourself in one of them, or especially that you created it yourself.”
Harry struggled to concentrate on the magical flow that he felt seething in him with a greater impulse than he would have wished…
One of the customers scoffed to his right and made him turn his head by reflex. One of the people at the table was telling a story that turned out to be exceedingly funny because all the guests seemed to have an uncontrollable laugh.
The game was tight, both teams were very good and no one seemed to want to give the other a chance to win. The goals were tied from opponent to opponent, the gap being equal for each.
A restful silence then settled with the smell of coffee impregnating the room in a pleasant way. Harry felt like in his living room sipping his mug with Ron and Hermione for an afternoon. Sometimes he would sit quietly on his couch, a coffee on the coffee table and a Quidditch magazine in his hand while waiting for Ginny to return when she had late workouts.
In front of his best friend’s serious face, Harry sat down on the couch without taking into account the fact that he was sticking his thigh against Malfoy’s, too attentive to what Ron had to teach them. He vaguely felt Malfoy tense at his side, but remained resolutely focused on Ron in front of him.
Malfoy’s long fingers awkwardly grabbed his hands anchored on his shoulders, visibly trying to detach them without succeeding.
“We’d better try to get some sleep, tomorrow we’ll start practice and I think we’ll be even more exhausted than we are today,” Ron said, changing the subject and taking off his clothes to put on his pajamas.
Draco felt Potter's trembling hands land flat on his chest and apply a slight pressure on it before being abruptly pushed back. He staggered for a moment a little disconcerted by the sudden loss of Potter’s warm body against his own and blinked when he saw him move quickly towards the living room.
Malfoy opened wide his eyes and hid with difficulty his impassive mask which had definitely cracked since the beginning of their exchange. Harry did not wait for his answer and proceeded to the main room to reach the elevator and return home.
Harry couldn’t help but feel a certain discomfort towards Ginny. If she knew what he had dared to do for nearly three weeks with Malfoy, when she thought he was so faithful, so kind, so “Harry”…
Harry frowned. He clearly remembered going to Honeydukes just after going around Flourish and Blotts so that Hermione could find a book. It had seemed like an eternity, and Ron had suggested that he wait for her at the Three Broomsticks not knowing how long it would take.
Malfoy slowly lowered his eyebrow and blinked once, twice, before turning his face to the fireplace to observe the green flames. What the hell was he thinking?
“I’ve been calling you that for eight years, so yes, it’s complicated to have to go back to my old habits all the time.” he admitted, annoyed
Draco gauged him for a moment before looking away at one of the pictures of the living room, placed on a side table, showing them both side-by-side, smiling.
He lowered his eyes to himself, noticing that he was not wearing pajamas as usual, but simply wearing black cotton underpants.
Once fully naked, he climbed into the bathtub and let the hot stream of water scald his skin before regulating the temperature until it was satisfactory. He closed his eyes, to appreciate the effects on his body, feeling his muscles loosen under the benefits of heat.
“You impress me Potter, it only took you ten minutes to escape the torpor. It’s faster than any of the patients who have already crossed the threshold in my office.” he announced, his corner smile widening as he stared at Harry with his piercing eyes.
“There’s going to be a Quidditch game next week.” Ginny interrupted her, in a strong and hard voice to cover his own.
Harry was convinced that he was carrying the Dark Mark and intended to prove it to himself before he was projected here…
Harry definitely had a knack for making him lose his mind, whether or not he was without his memories, he was still the most amazing man Draco had ever met.
He could not believe that Malfoy was telling the truth, but the doubt settled when he did not move, his eyes resolutely stuck in his own, looking down on him. His breathing intensified, his heart beating harshly against his temples as he stared at him with apprehension.
He went through the shelves, looking at the various photographs where he, Ron and Hermione smiled. Malfoy was there, too, somewhat behind on some, but never very far from him.
“It’s not as if the question is on your mind every time you come…” Malfoy sighed, casting himself a cleaning spell before getting dressed.
This one was particularly clear, a little too bright, it should have been dark blue but Harry’s magic was half consumed by his jealousy. Almost entirely tainted by this bullshit of emotion from which he was desperately unable to detach himself.
“I assure you, Potter, only the chair has the spell. The rest of my furniture is perfectly devoid of it. But you’ll soon realize that, because obviously, if he had been, he wouldn’t have any effect on you” he confirmed, standing slowly, to get close to him.
Harry blinked once, shaking his head to regain his senses and turned his gaze in his to her. She frowned, her previous smile having left her lips to leave only a very fine line showing all her worry.
With rage, he kicked the blankets, uncovering his torso and the top of his thighs, the sheets slipping from the fingers that held them against him.
“That’s what worries me most about this story. But I hardly see a student making a potion of this magnitude. And I have full confidence in my teaching staff.” he said, lowering his hand and resting it on the desk.
His hands clumsily covered Malfoy’s body, from the birth of his hips to retracting his thighs, rising higher to grip his neck and strengthen the kiss.
“Ginny... I’m really sorry, I didn’t realize, I never wanted to hurt you...” Harry said, who felt his heart tighten in the face of Ginny’s bruised look.
“Draco? Since when do you call him like that? Fuck, Ron, can you explain what the hell is going on?” Harry spit out, feeling the panic coming back.
He then raised a suspicious eyebrow when Harry still did not react. Harry slowly regained his senses and blinked as he realized he was still watching him. He felt blushed and lowered his head to his cup before lifting it to finish off his coffee.
Harry had a gift for not caring what people thought. Quite the opposite of Draco at that time, or showing himself as he really was, was exposing a state of weakness of which he was deeply ashamed. Because a Malfoy never reveals his moods. A Malfoy keeps his temper in all circumstances, even in the face of death.
His arm, still holding the doorknob of Theo’s office, was surprisingly tense. He obviously didn’t want to let go of it and was certainly using it as a catalyst to get through all the stress accumulated during the psychoanalysis session.
Harry stay still for a moment, before going to sit mechanically on the bed, Malfoy’s feet grazing his pelvis under the sheets.
The drawing depicted them, sitting at the Gryffindor’s table in the Great Hall, feasting for having won the cup of the four houses. Each of them smiled, they even seemed to sing on the drawing, their bodies swaying from left to right, while their lips moved in rhythm.
“At least it changes from the off-white and anthracite grey that Astoria decided to impose on me… I’ve never seen such sad colours for a wedding.”
His heart beat louder in his chest, remembering the sequel, his eyes traveling over Malfoy’s body asleep in front of him.
Malfoy seemed to never leave his office, at least that’s what Harry thought since he didn’t see him anywhere in the corridors of the Ministry.
It was only the second session and Harry was already looking forward to the end of this whole improvised course thing.
Harry found it more difficult to stand up and help himself from the railing to get up completely. When he was standing, he took a quick look at Malfoy, who stared at the ground with fear and breathed quickly. He then proceeded towards the gates in a step almost as steep as Harry, with abnormally tight shoulders.
"You're kidding me, aren't you, Potter? You're not really...gay?" he jeered, deliberately pressing the last word.
Harry slowed down on his broom while stopping the instructions he was explaining to Angelina about the passing techniques he had read in
Harry sighed, surreptitiously closing his eyes, worn out by the maternal side of his friend whom he had always struggled to bear.
As questions rushed through his head, Malfoy was already just a few inches away. Harry couldn’t believe he didn’t have the upper hand... As if his body didn’t want to struggle, as if he was numb and didn’t have the strength to reject him.
Then, after a few long minutes though too short in his humble opinion, Potter finally freed his hand and brought it back to his bust, where he squeezed his shirt with his fingers.
Neville was also improving, he managed to expel the wand from Harry’s hands, almost every time. Harry was very proud of him.
Harry’s lips parted, opening his mouth in an inspiration as he was preparing to rebut something, anything that could silence this idiot Parkinson, but she spoke again before he had time to close her beak.
Draco felt that something was slipping through his fingers when he saw his best friend and Potter also suddenly complicit but still couldn't put his finger on it.
He stopped on one of them, indicating «Draco Malfoy», «Theodore Nott» and his breath got stuck in his chest.
” Blaise replied, throwing a malicious smile at Potter, who shuddered at the term used, before blushing slightly and finally rising.
His hand hurt him as it was still closed against the wall, a few tingles mingling with the pain, pulsating from the place that had hit the tile.
Malfoy had let go of his shoulders, bringing his arms along his flanks, his face covered by Harry’s collarbone. Breathing erratically, Harry lifted himself up with his arms, gently withdrawing from Malfoy, before falling on his back next to him.
It was good, it was hot, but too little to his liking. Harry’s moves became more impatient, always wanting more, wanting Malfoy...
Draco walked cautiously towards her, taking part in knocking on it before opening it larger when Potter replied.
But the pain that he could read in the grey orbs was almost palpable. It almost hurt him so much that it seemed deep.
He had barely walked through the door, that Malfoy was already laying his hands on him. Harry groaned when Malfoy’s hands ran through his back before grabbing his hips firmly and turning him over to face him.
Malfoy seemed to understand this time, since his eyes opened wide, seeming to wonder if his own showed the truth.
He fell face to face with an immaculate white torso, almost unreal pale. If he hadn’t seen it the day before, he might have convinced himself that he imagined it.
“Stop being dumb!” he winced, then began to remove his own pants, pulling off his underwear and throwing them carelessly to the side.
Malfoy still held his hips firmly, his fingers stuck in his skin. His breath was crashing against his shoulder and he was sweating from the orgasm that had passed through him a few seconds earlier too.
“Neither do I, but obviously you have to go through this to get a fucking answer!” he jeered. “I know you’ve always been a fucking impulsive, but this is bigger than anything you’ve gotten us used to… And this time you won’t hide behind a bloody Dark Lord who’s directing your emotions."
"I've thought about it, but I have to admit that seeing your face now is far too rewarding to regret my touch," he said, proud of himself.
Dumbledore raised his head a little to put it back totally straight, the glass of his glasses clogging his eyes so disturbing.
Then she went to the door and opened it, Ron was already gone. She turned her head slightly, a little smile on her lips.
Draco detached his hands tightly closed on the earthenware. He groaned under the pain of having squeezed too hard and frantically beat fingers to release them. He then turned the cold water tap and passed his hands under the jet to collect the flow, lowering his palms on his face to cool off.
Then he made a decision which he had thought long and hard, and which he knew would make him an even more pathetic being than he already was, but for too long, he had gone to great lengths to deny the truth. It’s for this reason that he was already in front of Malfoy’s dorm to expel all that he wanted from him.
Harry opened wide his eyes and had a recoil movement. Malfoy was always staring at him as he continued to explore the guy’s mouth. It was totally obscene, and his brain was on standby. He was still watching Malfoy but he didn’t really see him.
Harry had laughed, but insisted on taking at least one trinket to please Molly. So, Draco had finally gave in and agreed to choose with him.
Harry was gasping on his shoulder. His chest would hardly rise against his while his warm breath touched his neck and made him shiver. Potter must have misinterpreted his reaction since he froze instantly and raised his arms extended along his flanks to pass them between their pressed bodies against each other.
“Good evening Harry” his soft voice made, from his seat whose backrest exceeded him by several meters.
Then George and Bill had followed them, the twin had pulled the brooms out of the storeroom asking them if they were brave enough to fly in this weather. And Ron immediately accepted, grabbing the brooms of his hands and handing one over to Harry.
“That’s not the point, Potter, it’s how I get to know your departure time by hearing you leave the premises when the elevator comes down.”
An awkward silence had set in, interspersed with porcelain noises and chewing from Harry, before he cleared his throat and decided to speak.
The today’s Harry seemed to nibble him from within, seeking to recover his feelings, leading a constant battle with his past self. His what he thought he was just a day ago…
Harry looked at him without blinking, then finally nodded his head before letting go of his grip on his hair, lowering his arm on Ron’s shoulder to press it.
Theo had not bothered to stand up to welcome him, nor had he even looked up his eyes as the files on which he was leaning.
Harry could see in his eyes the path of his reflection, as a genius who seeks a way to solve his equation.
Harry looked at his desk. Ron was right, it was a pile of scrolls and files of all kinds and he didn’t even realize it. As if it’s normal to work in such a mess!
Malfoy was beautiful. It was suddenly obvious, as if it were the first time he saw him. A heat wave invades her, trapping her heart in front of the beauty and delicacy of her features.
Zabini stole his cigarette from him and took a whiff of it under Malfoy’s falsely outraged gaze, who hit his shoulder before recovering it by ripping out of his lips.
He frowned when they seemed familiar to him, searching in his memory where he had already seen this kind of furniture, folding his eyelids under the white light that always attacked his pupils as much.
He moved instinctively towards the bar where Mrs Rosmerta was already filling several glasses when a very recognizable voice rang behind him.
Draco gave up the ingredients he had prepared and he grumbled because the potion should have had the shade of a vermilion red and he had waited too long to incorporate them.
“Find something to do. There’s reading on this side,” he said, pointing to the library with his chin.
Harry looked at the alarm clock in the middle of the cabinet, marking 7:30 a.m., and swore in a low voice before picking up his clothes that were littering the floor. He had to get home before Ron came to pick up some stuff himself.
“No, but it’s their mere presence that bothers me. Already that in Hogwarts we supported them, I don’t want it to happen again. And then Malfoy is so weird lately, look at him, he doesn’t look anymore like that arrogant little prick he was, it seems like he’s impersonating someone else”
As he slowly emerged, he felt a weight weighing on his right flank and lowered his eyes to determine what it was. Harry discovered with astonishment one of Malfoy’s arms curling his waist, his hand strolling in the void and his long thin fingers grazing the blankets.
Draco went to the kitchen to prepare lunch. To occupy his mind, to make the void so that the suffering he felt permeating his thoughts did not extend into his muscles, preventing him from moving forward and nailing him permanently to the ground.
He turned his head on the chair beside him to find that Ron had completely abandoned the idea of pretending and had already fallen asleep, his head leaning backwards and his mouth slightly ajar.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and thought back at the strange event that had occurred that morning. Harry had certainly let his emotions get in the way of his magic and had once again made him feel five times what he felt.
“Then try harder!” Harry retorted, who strongly doubted his partner’s investment in his willingness to learn to practice nonverbal spells.
Malfoy had two small pink spots on the top of his cheekbones and his grey eyes, usually cold in appearance, shone with the various memories they shared.
They took advantage of the restful calm and the sounds of the many birds in the trees, feeding their chicks or repairing their nests to face the bitter cold surrounding them.
“Good evening sir” he replied, raising the eyes to anchor them in the piercing blue that seemed to probe him.
Harry finally came back to him and blinked to see that he was standing a few meters from him and raised a sceptical eyebrow. He looked at him for a moment, his hair with bluish reflections by the torches hanging on the walls and his bright grey eyes which seemed to probe him on all sides.
Harry had just filed the last documents of the day and placed them in the receptacle which would send them directly to the department concerned.
Malfoy finally realized that he was being watched as he turned his eyes to him and frowned before turning his head completely to face him.
When he entered the room, Ron turned his eyes to him and welcomed him with a broad smile before rising to take him in his arms.
Harry turned to the side before throwing up the leftovers from his dinner on his shoes. He coughed before he got up and took out his wand to clean.
So he hardly got up from the couch, leaning on the armrest so as not to fall down and walked with a nervous step towards the door where Harry was.
magic, you’ll react differently!” he spit, with disgust, before sticking his incredible irises in his eyes.
Harry sighed. He expected Ginny to do this to him as soon as he saw her. She had waited for him after his last class of the day and had intimately asked him to follow her to her dormitory to talk to him. He would have done the same if he had been in his place.
It was good, but nothing sensational, nothing like what Malfoy would have done if he had taken care of his erection. With him, Harry’s head would have already gone back, his eyes would have difficulty remaining open and his breath would be more erratic than ever under his touch.
He couldn’t help blinking at this particularly silly gesture and wondered how the Potter he knew could work all day in front of this disgusting, bloody love’s smell.
Had he been afraid that Malfoy would kiss him again? Had he unconsciously desired this closeness after what had happened?
He blinked his eyes before turning them to the place that made him shiver, because the touch was so soft. Malfoy’s hand was always anchored around his waist while his thumb moved delicately in a circle as if to reassure him, to intimate to him that it would go well, that everything would go well.
Harry tensed up slightly but caught himself not panicking, as if he suspected that Malfoy meant him no harm. And that was the case, he knew it, he felt it.
A satisfied smile adorned his lips as he mixed the concoction one last time, losing himself in the hypnotic colour, similar to that of will-o’-the-wisps.
Winter wasn’t too far away by now. He felt the wind blew under his sweater and he breathed for a long time this breeze which oxygenated his brain to have too, or not worked enough, according to him.
Malfoy moved his eyes to his body, lingering on his crotch, which he felt hardened again in spite of himself. He then lifted his grey eyes up to his face and planted them in his own before stretching a grin.
Very few wizards had the ability to use this gift, he himself was not able to master it enough to read clearly in the minds of others.
Harry guessed that it was the living room, a soft sofa in the middle of the room, soft cushions resting on each armrest. A large glass coffee table placed in front of it, a luxurious carpet surrounding it, to finish with a beautiful large fireplace all in moldings, a black grid decorated with sumptuous designs protecting them from the fire that emanated from it.
