“I won’t be too long, I promise” he blew her a kiss.
Harry sighed and walked away without saying anything.
Now he only had to inform one other...
Stay tuned for more gossip!
“I’m not doing this for you. All I want is Draco’s happiness. He may seem tough on the outside, but on the inside he’s soft and delicate, almost like a flower’s petals” she said truthfully.
“Why?” James asked her. They usually got their robes and clothes from Madam Malkin’s robe shop.
“What if I took you to see a specialized therapist? Someone who could really understand your... eating habits” Lily didn’t dare use the words ‘unusual’ or ‘problematic’, not when she knew how much it bothered her son to be called something (anything*) un-normal.
He then offered it to the bunny who thankfully latched onto it and started sucking.
Draco closed his eyes. He wondered what his life would be like in every house.
“But they’re so boring! Snape is horrible to us Gryffindors while Sinistra is so dull”
Lily stayed quiet. She didn’t even want to thing  about what went on in the Manor before that raid.
“Thank you. You look quite handsome yourself” Kate said with a smile as she rested her head on Draco’s shoulder.
This wand is extremely loyal and will not work for any other person except for its original owner. It is powerful and in my experience this type of wood produces the fewest accidents, the least foolish errors and the most elegant charms and spells, so it goes well with this particular core. It is a sophisticated wand, capable of highly advanced magic. Wands made with Whitewood are complex, intriguing and often mysterious, just like the owners who best suit them. This one is well versed in healing magic (when healing or removing dark magic the tip of the wand will get tinted with red or black streaks of color - depending on the magic you are dealing with) however it is also adapt to curses. A first example happened right now: those flowers were well on their way to death and Mr. Malfoy returned them to full health with a swish of his wand: for this reason I suspect he may have a gift in Magical Healing. However, I also have generally observed this type of wand seems most at home with a wizard of conflicted and manipulative nature and a person which went/is going through a trauma and dealt/are dealing with it. As a wand it is not easy to master so I would only consider placing it in the hands of a witch or wizard with great talent. These wands also have a peculiarity: they can sense people who have (or may have) dark intents towards their owners and thus are very protective. For example, if Draco were to be unconscious and someone tried to harm him, the wand would cast a powerful shield to protect him for how long it would be needed.”
Draco turned around and looked at the mirror: he saw himself smiling back at him.
“Kate, wake up...” he whispered softly again.
Between Harry and Kate the former seemed to be the one dealing worse with his situation.
“He is dangerously underweight, so he was probably barely fed before. He also had quite a lot older injuries that were never treated and many scars, some of them old enough to be form 8/9 years ago. As for the more recent injuries, he had quite a few external and internal cuts/bruises, he was bleeding a lot from some open wounds and had a few broken bones… It’s—it’s a miracle he is still alive. He did crash a few times while we were working on him but fortunately we were able to bring him back. We healed everything we could and left a few bruises to heal on their own. He’s currently sleeping” Healer Montary said grimly.
“Yeah, Flitwick asked us to check it as it had...  you know... interesting charm work cast on it recently” Ron added.
Not even his wretched father.
“You’ve had bad dreams before and never reacted this strongly after” Harry noted as he cleaned up everything with a simple flick of his wand.
‘What’s interesting?’ he thought.
“You smell so good” Harry mumbled as Draco leaned in to him enough so that he could smell his hair.
“Don’t worry, Harry. We’ll think of something” she said.
“Of course! It’s just weird to find someone who actually likes Astronomy. Most people in Gryffindor won’t so I’ll guess you’ll be a first!” Harry said.
“So what happened to them?”
He missed... everything about him.
“Guys! You’ll never believe what I just saw!”
Dr. Dirwin raised both eyebrows and wrote some more on her notepad.
“And are those the only people in Slytherin?” he asked purposely.
“Draco, dear, are you sure you don’t want to get some ice-cream?” Lily asked him.
He grinned.
It was time to make things right.
Before turning around a corner, Kate looked at him and waved. He waved as well before turning around and quickly walking back to his own dormitory.
But now, even after receiving Muggle painkillers and a dose of two different headache-relieving potions he felt like someone was splitting his head in two with a saw or an axe while they pushed his eyes into their sockets.
Another visit with Healer Kum eased his worries a bit: his powers were permanent and definitely wouldn’t harm anyone. He was relieved.
Draco had also been very busy researching some useful healing and defensive spells to help prevent anyone sneaking up and hurting him again.
Too tired to do anything else, his eyelids started to drop.
“Lucius” he said in a neutral voice while keeping his head high, trying to remain as calm as possible. He purposefully didn’t address him as ‘father’.
“NO! He can’t! He has to eat! I’ll force the food down his throat myself if he doesn’t!” Harry said in worry. He didn’t want Draco to go to a hospital. He didn’t want Draco to leave him.
Ron rolled his eyes.
“Harry! Please calm down: everything will be alright with Draco” Hermione said as she grasped her friend’s shoulders.
“Just one thing...”
His ‘parents’ had informed Harry of their decision to take Draco in but hadn’t explained to him the reason why Draco couldn’t stay with his birth parents since they felt Draco himself should decide what to tell Harry and what not to.
“How was she?” he asked, letting his jealousy control him for a moment.
————————————————————————————
Why Harry was awake at 4 AM was a mystery, however at the moment he was too preoccupied with drying his face and hair.
“What do you mean? Could your parents not afford to feed you properly?”
“I agree, my dear, but I’m afraid students and professors have grown quite used to calling me that by now. Thank you anyway, you’re very sweet” she smiled at him.
“Glad to see you’re still alive, champ” Cedric said as he hugged Draco as well.
“No! No, it’s not weird at all. Sorry... just please don’t bring up Kate again. Ok?” he asked.
Looks like these two lovebirds can’t keep their hands to themselves as shown in the photographs taken late last night after the couple returned from their romantic trip to Paris.
His night was filled with nightmares and flashbacks about the moment he discovered Harry was just toying with him.
He had spent the night in the guest bedroom at Ron and Hermione’s house.
“You know what, guys? I think I’ll ask him later in a more private place” he said.
He missed the tightening in Harry’s jaw and the pointed look his friends sent the boy as he greeted Kate with a warm smile.
“I was busy this afternoon” Draco said and watched with the corner of his eye as Kate blushed. Kate touched his leg with hers from under the table and Draco didn’t shy away from her touch.
“Don’t worry. I’m sure you’ll excel in whatever profession you chose” he said softly.
This is a step forward in both medicine and science as it completely branches off any type of treatment that may have been developed in the past.
The Hufflepuff whispered the password “Bubbles” and the both of them went inside the room.
“I can’t. It’s-It’s hard for me to eat... I don’t want to go into detail, just know that all my life I’ve been used to eating a certain way until when I was taken in by the Potters everything changed and it was too much...” Draco hoped she understood what he meant.
“Of course, Sir!” he said and smiled. In the back of his mind he wondered whether this had anything to do with Nott and what he had said.
Draco and Harry sprang apart just as Elizabeth speed walked around the corner.
Draco looked up and surprisingly Lily saw determination in his eyes.
“I FUCKING KNEW IT! And now Draco’s all alone with that SMIRKING WHORE FROM SLYTHERIN!” he shouted at the top of his lungs, letting out some of his anger.
“I would never put him in that position to begin with. He just has to come to terms with the fact that I’m the one in charge in our relationship and that I only want what’s best for him” Harry stated while finishing his drink. He got up, left the money for his bill on the table and went to the Floo.
He fumbled with his suit as his tie felt like a coarse rope was choking him. He had wanted to look his best.
There were four long tables in the room and each was filled with students of different ages.
“AQUASPIRITUS-1.5 HOURS”
He asked if they could visit the potions shop again and Harry fortunately agreed so they quickly walked there.
Or at least part of it.
Draco prayed he had made the right decision in accepting Harry’s plea, because he didn’t know if his heart could take it if it were broken once more.
“It’s not too late you know... if you tell him how you feel maybe he’ll change his mind?”
“That sounds great! You’re the best at potions!” Harry said.
Even if they couldn’t be more, he would always be first and foremost her friend, sexual tension and all that be damned.
Draco frowned at Harry’s language but couldn’t stop the corner of his lips from turning up a little. If only Harry knew...
Immediately Draco and Mr. Diggory had rushed by his side.
Sev looked at him knowingly.
“I met Harry, Ron, Lavender, Hermione and... uhm...” he couldn’t recall the names of the two brunettes.
He rushed over to him and cradled his upper body in his arms. The boy was deathly pale and skeletal. He also had various injuries that were bleeding profoundly. James felt for a pulse in his neck and was relieved to find one, albeit weak and slow, but a pulse nonetheless.
“Thank you” he said with a nod.
He snaked his hands under Draco’s form, feeling his lithe and frail physique through his clothes and gently lifted him up. He was as light as a feather.
He himself had a son, Harry, and he couldn’t imagine harming him the way this boy was hurt by his own parents.
Harry didn’t even want to think about the possibility of his Draco being with someone else other than him.
Kate nodded and followed him, walking back into the Great Hall, which was half way empty with students (and even a few professors) slow dancing.
He liked Cedric: he was nice and smart and knew how to uphold an intelligent conversation. Another plus to his name was that he adored Snoodle and always asked Draco if he could bring him to their study sessions. He of course agreed and that led to Cedric bringing Snoodle treats.
He cut for himself a little carrot stick and ate it.
“Ho- hhhmpf-“ he kept on clearing his throat so Lily quickly offered him a glass of water from the night stand.
Draco melted into Harry’s green eyes and sighed. “I love you.”
Harry gave him a half-smile and Draco laid his hand on Harry’s chest.
Sure enough, Draco Malfoy turned around at that precise moment, briefly scanning the coffee shop as he waited for his order. Before Harry could hide his face (unnecessarily, he realized after the fact, as he was unrecognizable under the glamor charm), Draco caught sight of him.
Draco swatted his chest. “Excuse me! None of that. Only nice things, if you please.”
“Yes,” Draco agreed. “It isn’t bad at all.”
Harry smiled at him, once again feeling completely gobsmacked by his beauty. “You’re very handsome.”
“Was that an extremely conspicuous dig at my pale skin?”
“Are you fucking kidding me?!” Harry gestured at Draco’s bare chest. “Fine! You look at me and hate yourself, but I look at you and I’m reminded of what I did!”
Draco leaned forward and swiftly stole a bite of his sandwich, smiling at Harry’s delighted grin.
“I don’t know! I don’t bloody know, Potter, alright! Because the moment I look at you, all hell breaks loose in my brain and all my words fly out my ears and all I can see is your damn green eyes and I lose absolutely all control and it terrifies me! No one has ever come close to having this power over me, aside from a psychopath, and it’s been just a few fucking hours, Potter! Hours! You can’t control my emotions this effectively in a few hours, I won’t bloody let you, you fucking stupid arse!”
“I didn’t think you would. But I thought I would say it, nonetheless.”
“Yeah, you do.”
anything,” Harry declared vehemently for the fourth time, pulling at his hair in frustration. The muscles in his arms flexed deliciously when he did so, and Draco forced himself not to stare.
After several hours of childishly competitive flying, they each apparated home to shower and change, and Harry picked up his sitting room a bit while he thought about how attractive Draco’s wind-swept hair had looked. No doubt he would show up here dressed to the nines, hair styled to within an inch of its life as usual, but he didn’t mind that either. Harry wouldn’t soon forget how Draco looked on a broomstick: carefree and joyful, yet somehow still as graceful as ever. God he was sexy.
“Sure,” Draco agreed, though Harry could practically see him making a mental note to check his plate for suspicious additions before he began eating. Or maybe he was just planning which pair of fancy slacks to wear. Who could tell with Draco?
“I’m not wrong about this.”
“I did,” Harry nodded, hoisting himself up onto the counter across from Draco. He anxiously began to nibble on his thumbnail. “I mean, I told them a reporter was coming, and they were fine with it.”
Sod it, Draco decided, pulling off his underpants. He hopped in the shower and rinsed the grogginess out of his eyes, giving his body a thorough scrub-down and washing his hair with care. He resisted the urge to sing, but damn, he wanted to.
“Well what are your theories then, genius?”
Draco seriously considered the offer for a moment. If he was honest, he really did want to stay, even though he knew it was a terrible idea. The lines between professionalism and friendship had already blurred in a way that couldn’t be undone, and while Draco knew that Harry shouldn’t be anything to him but the subject of an article, he also knew, without a doubt, that he was falling for him. And that couldn’t be undone either.
“I suppose that’s why you’re ashamed of me.”
Finally Draco smirked. “You are relentlessly aggravating.”
“Draco…” Harry whimpered, “oh god,
“See, Potter?” Draco whispered. “Words aren’t always necessary.”
“Well it’s nice to know that you can manage it when forced,” Harry said. He squeezed Draco’s hand to let him know he was teasing again.
“I don’t want to,” he said petulantly.
Draco shrugged it off, but suddenly he wanted to tell Harry all of his thoughts, every single one of them, as soon as they popped into his head. Thoughts like…
“Just because I always use a glamor charm in public doesn’t mean I don’t go out,” Harry grumbled petulantly. “Only that no one
Draco smirked back at him.
“But your boundaries…”
“Draco,” Harry interrupted him before he could say something that he might not be comfortable sharing in front of a stranger. (Perhaps Draco’s social acumen was finally rubbing off on him.) “This is Auror Sidhu. He and Auror Reed will be conducting your questioning this afternoon.”
“But… then why was he there at all?” Draco wondered aloud, vigorously massaging his forehead.
Harry laughed. “I’d never sue you.”
“That was one of your worst lines yet,” Draco said, a tenderness in his voice that really did make Harry want to say…
Once Harry had figured out how to work the Daily Prophet visitor’s entrance, he meandered up a tall brass staircase into the open, bright newsroom filled with a maze of cubicles. He resisted the bizarre urge to yell out “olly olly oxen free” as he sauntered through the eerily deserted office, peering into each cubicle as he went along.
“I’ll never get used to you, Draco,” Harry admitted. “Everything you say sounds sexy, really. You have a sexy voice.”
Harry smiled. “There’s my mature, logical man."
“Why?”
“Damage?” Harry growled.
“If I were going to get tired of you, Potter, it would’ve happened years ago,” he replied, smiling.
Harry smiled up at him. “Yes, sir.”
“What does?”
Yes, sure enough, Draco’s eyes faithfully followed Harry’s movements as if he was studying them for an exam. Harry’s heart beat louder in his chest; being ogled in such a way was a huge turn-on for him. It made him want to make a real show of it, to display himself just for Draco.
“Of course we will.”
“When you die of Malfoy-itis, you mean?”
“Within reason,” Draco said, chuckling at his enthusiasm. “Cooperative saint, my arse.”
“Anyway, you have a severe lack of skincare potions here, Potter,” Draco continued. “It’s rather worrying.”
“I thought you didn’t care about looks?” he managed to whisper, placing a gentle hand on Draco’s neck.
“Your friends can be just as verbose as you are, Potter,” he replied. “They’ve supplied me with more than enough information.”
He supposed he had to eventually, at any rate. Draco looked in the mirror once again and tried to fix his hair into something passable. He was only moderately successful, but he figured it didn’t really matter now, given the circumstances.
“Yes, please do that,” Harry said, the corners of his mouth twitching.
“So this is the Weasley castle, is it?” Draco asked, gazing slowly about the room.
“Except when I say hurtful or harsh things, as is often my custom.”
Draco laughed. Harry couldn’t ignore it anymore: the word
Draco sighed again and set his tea down on the counter. “You were on theirs first.”
“Here’s what we’re going to do,” Harry began, taking the reins before Draco could retreat any further into his melancholy. “You’re going to take a very careful shower, in which you’re not going to move a fucking muscle above your shoulders. And I’m going to find you some clothes and get you a snack, and then we’re going to just hang out and relax and not ask anymore questions. Okay?”
“A minor fancy,” Ron laughed. “Kind of like what I had for Hermione for seven bloody years?”
“We’re a simple folk, Harry,” Ron explained, leaning back lazily in his chair. “Give us food, butterbeer, and a good shag, and we’re happy.”
“Because… I’m…” Draco fiddled with his wand, just to distract himself, to keep his hands busy, to expel a fraction of the energy that was surging through his veins at full speed. It was making his ears ring, this intense feeling. His stomach… he didn’t think he could stand the feeling…
“You’re miffed that I didn’t tell you who I was the other night,” Harry inferred, looking awkwardly down at the table.
Draco pushed him away after only the gentlest of kisses, smiling up at him.
“Draco,” Harry breathed out.
“No significant developments,” Draco replied as Rosalind took a long swig of tea.
“Would you like something to drink?” Harry asked, ignoring his erratic heartbeat and forcing himself to sound normal. Draco made him far too jumpy. “I was going to make some tea after I’m done tidying up in here.”
Harry glared at nothing as he picked up his wand with his free hand. “I really hate that bloke. At least tell me where he lives so I can go ransack his house.”
“We’re still friends, of course.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, the things you find attractive… And now do you see what I mean? We can’t even have a conversation without it turning sexual.”
“If you think I’m going to expand upon that answer, then you’re sorely mistaken.” He took a dainty sip of water.
“Gorgeous?”
“Yes, you are.”
“Want me to regurgitate it for you?” he joked.
Suddenly, two children ran out in front of him, chasing each other, and he dodged backwards out of the way just in time.
“We… have a history.”
“Sexy name,” Draco muttered, envy curling around him like smoke.
“Don’t touch me,” he said sullenly.
Draco allowed himself the luxury of lying there and staring at the man for a few blissful minutes. He had somehow forgotten in the night just how incredibly beautiful Harry was.
Harry moaned, and the tortured bliss on his face drove Draco to insanity. He couldn’t stand it for one second longer.
“I suppose your technique is rather effective,” Draco grudgingly told him.
He knew how small it sounded, but he meant it with all his heart. He hoped the words would convince them, nearly as much as he hoped they would convince himself.
“You have a strangely innocent charm about you,” he went on, and Harry started to feel a bit uncomfortable. “Your heart has no malice in it. You’re very likeable.”
“Looking forward to it.
,” Harry grumbled, putting as much vitriol into the name as he used to do in school.
“Noted,” Harry said shyly, his imagination already running amok, even though Draco had been joking (he assumed).
Malfoy pulled the empty chair across from Harry out from the table and sat down with a sigh.
“Fuck you, arsehole.” Harry shook his head and laughed as he sat back down, only to fold his arms on the table and lay his head face-down on top of them. Draco felt a wonderful tickle of pleasant nostalgia in the back of his neck every time Harry called him names, and he didn’t much care how twisted that was. As a matter of fact, it made him want to do very twisted things indeed.
After a moment, Draco pulled his slippery hand away from Harry’s and moved it back beneath the bedsheet.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said gently.
“Clearly we both have our moments,” he replied.
“Honestly, it’s banshees versus werewolves all over again.”
“Well, that was before I knew it was you,” Draco mumbled. “I didn’t realize at the time that I had so much more for which to apologize."
“Because you’re you,” Draco told him. “You’re the very best of men. The rest of us are merely living in your shadow. No one will ever measure up.”
Ron shook his head. “Of course not. After all, we hate each other.”
“No,” Draco mumbled.
Draco peered at him, surprised at the statement. “Try me.”
“I don’t want you to leave.” His voice sounded peculiar even to his own ears.
He quickly pushed himself up from the couch, fetched his wand from the kitchen floor, grabbed his beer off the coffee table and migrated to the armchair. There, now Potter would be a few feet away at least. It might help.
Once Draco had received and paid for the drinks, he walked back through the pub and saw that Potter was watching him do so, tilting his head to the side as was often his wont. Draco tried to ignore the thrill creeping up the back of his neck and held Potter’s gaze as he gracefully meandered through the crowd.
“Wouldn’t put it past him,” Draco mumbled, his heart still pounding with worry.
Draco studied him for a moment as he shuffled his way around the kitchen, flicking his wand and busying himself with his cooking.
Draco gave the top of Harry’s head one last kiss and then padded quietly to the bathroom across the hall.
“Well you certainly did use a lot of things against me.” Potter looked down at the table again.
“Well, to answer your earlier remark, you’ve basically seen the house already, aside from a very tiny bedroom the next room over,” Draco said, crossing one leg over the other. “I’m essentially living in a garden shed.”
“What can I get you?” the barkeep asked in a bored voice.
Harry shook his head, still smiling. “Mythical. Ethereal. Enchantingly graceful.”
Draco smirked at him. “Don’t you remember, Potter? I offered my friendship and you rejected me? Tale as old as time, and what have you.”
“Look, Harry…” he continued, looking nervous again. “What I was saying earlier…”
“About as subtle as a rogue bludger,” Draco concurred with a smile, and a look that Harry couldn't quite read. “But yes, I am a single homosexual, guilty as charged. And I presume that you are as well, since you’re so inclined to flirt with handsome blokes in coffee shops?”
They stared at each other.
“I’m a bit too drunk to give you another interview right now,” Harry said, sighing deeply, as if it was the end of the world. “I’m so sorry. Just a little bit too drunk.”
Draco shifted even closer to him until there was almost no space left, and only when their knees were touching under the covers did Harry seem to realize where his other hand was.
“This is your… Proffice.” Harry snorted to himself at his own hilarity.
Draco tried not to smile at him. It didn’t work.
“Ron,” Harry warned, “I swear…”
morning person if I’ve been up late the night before.”
And with that, Draco spun on his heel, stomped into the kitchen, flung open the back door, and trod down the short pathway into his tiny garden. He kept walking until he was at the very end of the yard, with nowhere to go but headlong into the hedgerow.
Ron didn’t seem suspicious, only a little confused. He gestured at a short wooden stool tucked underneath the desk in front of Draco.
When he opened his eyes again, Harry was standing in front of him, and he had his hand over his mouth, once again looking like he was barely stifling a laugh.
“Did Harry send you?” Weasley asked, sounding more curious than anything else.
Once he’d retrieved the small jug, he leaned back against the counter and cradled it in his hands, looking at Harry pensively. “May I ask you something?”
Draco found the gesture downright adorable, especially with Harry in his dashing Auror robes, but he would take that to the grave.
“You know, you’re the only man in the world who uses the full word for recap.”
Harry furrowed his brow. Whatever he had expected Draco to say, it wasn’t that. “Yeah?”
“Tutors,” Draco explained.
“Come for me, Harry,” he demanded gruffly, as he stroked his own cock.
When Draco stepped out of Harry’s fireplace a moment later, he hadn’t expected to nearly trip over the intoxicated imbecile, who was sitting on the slightly-raised ledge of the brick hearth.
Again Draco felt himself shifting further towards him, a bit startled that Harry had pegged his thoughts so easily. “Yes, you are.”
Harry picked up his wand once the questions had ceased for a moment and levitated the tea pot over to the table, pouring Draco another cup without being asked. Draco tapped the end of his quill against his bottom lip and surveyed his plentiful notes.
She placed his teacup on the ledge of the fire pit in front of him. “No, athletics have never been my forte. Aside from my strong arm, of course.”
But something stopped him, an oddly calm voice in his head, something that sounded a lot like Harry and felt a lot like love. That voice told him not to walk away. No, he’d walked away enough; now was the time to stay. Harry hadn’t left yesterday. Draco wouldn’t leave today.
“Right,” he said, and he made his way through the newsroom once again, an unfamiliar and altogether pleasant spring in his step. He was sure people glared at him, but he hardly noticed.
“Er, please?” Harry added. He could feel himself inconveniently blushing.
Draco nodded, grateful that he had chanced upon the correct Weasley. “Yes, I would, thank you. Shall I wait here, then?”
“You know you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, Harry, or reveal anything that you don’t want known,” Draco assured him. “You don’t owe anyone a damn thing. I hope you know that.”
Harry snickered. “Damn right.”
The unseen house elves cleared away their bowls from the kitchens below, and the second course of Caprese salad appeared before them. The Malfoys somehow managed to consume the entire course without speaking a single word to each other, and Draco groaned internally at the fact that they still had three remaining courses to sit through. He wished he was sharing the meal with Harry, with whom he could always find something to talk about.
“Let me see,” Harry insisted, tugging at Draco’s arm.
“Don’t think about him. Please. And you know not everyone despises you. I certainly don’t.” He touched those delicate pink lips. “Far, far from it.”
“Now get out of my office and start your research,” she dismissed him. “I need a whiskey.”
“Guess I can do that,” Ron said. “For Harry.”
Draco looked over at him, surprised. Harry chuckled at the face he must have been making.
“That was your worst compliment yet,” Harry said once his laughter had subsided. “In fact, I think it was just a straight insult.”
“So, do you play quidditch as well?” he asked lamely instead.
Draco chuckled. He paused and looked cautiously at Harry.
“That I can handle. Cunning, determined, always-gets-his-man Slytherin Draco Malfoy.”
“See?” Draco chuckled. “Rude. And yet… Easily forgiven.”
“Get the fuck out of here, werewolf,” Draco called after him.
“Yeah,” Harry said, nodding.
To his surprise, Draco stood up rather abruptly and stepped over to the other side of the cubicle.
Harry was staring at him, that maddening half smile playing on his face.
“For a time?”
“And I’m sorry for saying that looking at you makes me hate myself,” Draco admitted. “That’s not true at all. But I’m not sorry for anything else I said, Potter, and I am still angry with you.”
Harry looked over and gave him a surprised grin. “Sorry, what was that?”
“Um… hi,” Harry muttered, looking flabbergasted, both eyebrows lifting high and a hand twisting through his hair.
“Good evening, Draco,” his father finally said in his chilly, detached voice.
“I know,” Draco said. “But this is different. It’s just wanking. We won’t touch each other.”
Harry smiled and shifted so that he was sitting cross-legged on the bed, turned slightly away from Draco. No, that would never do. He shifted once again, trying to get comfortable.
Harry muttered unintelligibly, and Draco watched him until he heard the soft snores once again. Draco thought it was rather fitting that Harry snored, somehow. He even thought it was just a little bit sexy, although he would never tell anyone that, least of all Harry. He’d never hear the end of it.
This time Harry couldn’t ignore the jolt in his gut upon hearing his name on Draco’s lips. Yes, this was definitely dangerous. He felt as if he’d just walked onto the quidditch pitch, in the very best way.
about him. When he made his morning tea at the hotel kitchenette, there was Draco sipping it primly at the table across from him. When he joked around with Andrea, he thought about which of Draco’s smiles the joke would’ve elicited. And when he wanked at night (and in the morning, if he was honest), he thought of Draco, always Draco,
“I have impeccable taste in music, Malfoy,” Harry scoffed.
He rolled his eyes at his own ridiculousness as he desperately tried to push it all out of his head, but it was a challenge. No one had ever been able to obliterate his self-control like Harry bloody Potter.
Finally, when he could feel that Harry was finished, Draco slowly pulled his lips off of Harry’s cock and sat up. He looked up and met Harry’s eyes as he swallowed the last of Harry’s cum, wiping a finger across his bottom lip and sucking it as he stared at Harry.
“Is it?” He tightened his hold around Harry’s middle.
“Alright,” Harry agreed. He moved his body and laid back on the couch so that he was on his back, his arm behind his head, staring into the fire. “See, I won’t even look at you. A sacrifice I’m sure I’ll never recover from, but I’ll try my best.”
“I love this song,” he said grudgingly, at the exact same moment Harry did.
“Very well,” Draco nodded, refusing to rise to his teasing. “Thank you for today. I know it was a long one.”
Harry laughed. “Well thank you.”
“Yes,” he said, sounding like a petulant child.
“Mmm,” Harry muttered, nodding slowly in agreement. “And what about your father? And that’s not my third question.”
“I don’t mind it in the slightest,” Draco told him, haughtily sipping his tea. “Though your compliments are few and far between, as it happens.”
“Rest assured, however, I have no ulterior motives this time.” He glanced up at Harry for a second, as if gauging whether or not to say what he was thinking.
“You can dispense with the chat-up lines, Harry, I’m already yours,” Draco said softly, setting his tea cup down on the countertop.
“If you promise to make me some of your peppermint tea, then I’ll be there.”
“I know I can,” Draco answered. “Don’t tempt me, Potter, lest I toss you over my shoulder and drag you back inside right this very moment.”
Eventually, Harry decided that he needed to think of other things instead. Predictably, the first 'other thing' his mind supplied him with was a certain handsome blonde with impossibly soft hands. Well, anyway, at least the Draco issue was something he had a bit of control over. After ruminating on each and every emotion he’d felt the previous night (and numbly consuming four of the warm scones out of nervousness), Harry decided he couldn’t stand it any longer. He had to know exactly how monumentally he had fucked things up with Draco the night before, and to see if anything could be done about it.
Harry chuckled. “Because he looked like you. The whole time I was out with him I was thinking about you, and then I couldn’t
“I mean when you have sex, you’re passionate,” he ventured, trying to keep up with his own mouth, but it (along with his cock) held the reins. His imagination was painting vivid images: sucking on Harry’s neck, biting at his nipple, worshipping his prick, Harry softly moaning his name with
“I remember being so terrified at the idea of you being hurt, being caught… I knew I would rather die than have anything happen to you. I suppose that made things rather obvious for me, as far as my feelings were concerned.”
saying there?”
The foyer was hardly big enough to accommodate the two of them, and Harry was entirely too close for his liking, so Draco swiftly sidled over a bit as he watched Harry survey his sitting room.
“Thanks for saying all that.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck again, staring at his knees. “Earlier.”
Suddenly Draco felt Harry’s hands on his belt and pulled his lips away.
“Yes,” he replied, already hungry for Harry. “Fill me.”
“No, that’s not fair,” Harry complained. “You’ll just pick an easy question.”
Six days after their groundbreaking first interview, Draco had once again agreed to meet Harry at the place of his choosing. Though public, this seldom-used quidditch pitch several kilometers outside of London was a reasonably secluded meeting place, particularly since the weather was still so brisk, so they luckily had the place entirely to themselves.
“The horror,” Harry deadpanned, and Draco chuckled.
“Yes, for the moment, at least,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes and dropping down onto the couch. “Ron’s just going to sit with her for another minute.”
"No, not at all," Harry agreed, laughing at him. "But I do now."
“Oh, did you take your potion?” Harry asked, before Draco’s handsome face could distract him too much.
“That’s not fair,” Harry muttered.
“That’s your second question,” Draco said, and Harry rolled his eyes. “I suppose it means… My mother spent her life ensuring that all her emotions remained in check. She never once allowed her composure to slip. She only gave power to the things she chose to give power to. Thus, she always had the upper hand. She was in control.”
Draco smiled--typical Harry--but didn’t reply.
He would talk to Weasley.
Harry shifted in his chair and nervously continued rubbing at his chin. “I don’t, erm… I dunno if I want to--”
Harry grinned at him and kissed his cheek. “Then I said Draco Malfoy.”
“What?” Draco replied, surprised. “You said she wasn’t.”
Harry was silent, evidently engrossed. Draco sighed and took a long sip of his tea (out of a ‘Boss Witch’ mug; Harry was a cheeky little fucker at times) before he pressed on. Draco wasn’t sure why he was telling Harry all of this, but for some reason, he desperately wanted to.
Draco smiled at him. “Which part?”
“No.”
He nodded, and then shook his head. Until he had his journal in front of him, not to mention a clearer head, he didn’t feel up to sorting through the decision.
Ron snorted, confused. “Because I was poor?”
“I like finding things out about you.”
“Fainéant? It means someone who’s idle. Someone lazy, purposeless.”
“My former comments still stand,” Draco muttered, tapping his quill against his lip. “Anyways, my tastes have changed since then.”
“You have no idea.”
“No,” Harry said, “you can do that.”
“If you say ‘very Gryffindor’ I really will hex you into next week.”
“It’s really nice hearing you laugh,” Harry murmured, staring at his pink lips. His eyes were starting to get heavy.
“Like that’ll last.” Draco felt Harry smiling against his neck.
Draco lifted his eyebrows in surprise. Potter was notoriously private these days, almost to the point of being reclusive, and a full-blown interview was an incredibly rare occurrence. In fact, as far as Draco was aware, he’d only given two in his whole life.
“Alright, talk to me, then,” Harry said. “You went awfully quiet. Did you puke up your voice box in there as well?”
Draco strolled into work the following morning at precisely seven a.m., a smaller coffee in his hand than usual. He’d spent several hours at Potter’s house last night, asking even more soft-hitting questions long after they’d confessed to no longer hating each other. Harry had gradually become more comfortable opening up as the night had progressed, even readily volunteering details before Draco could ask for them.
Somewhere along the line, Draco had forgotten about the simple joy of waking up beside another warm body. He’d shoved it down, a rare pearl alongside all of his bad memories, and it had died there among the rot. Waking up next to Harry reminded him that there were things about his past that he could think of with fondness, things he didn’t have to shove down. It reminded him that there was a future there as well, a future that perhaps he didn’t have to be afraid of… a future with Harry.
Draco nodded. “I reckon you’re right.”
“What?”
“It’s Draco.”
Draco couldn’t help it anymore, he burst out laughing. It all struck him as just so typically Potter: bringing him to the brink of coming in his pants one moment, only to make it all a hilarious and endearing joke a minute later. Harry was the perfect storm of overpowering sexual tension and incredibly charming likeability. Draco had never met someone who married the two characteristics so seamlessly. Merlin, he wanted to both fuck Harry senseless and also cuddle him into the ground, and the two intense desires colliding inside of him felt far too close to love.
“As I said,” Draco continued, his cheeks tinged with pink, “I think we need to establish boundaries. I’m the reporter, you’re the subject, and that’s that.”
Draco didn’t respond, but he kissed Harry’s hand three times.
Draco smiled to himself and dumped the biscuits onto a serving dish unceremoniously. Then he hastily grabbed a small stack of napkins, admitting to himself that he was eager to get back to talking with Harry. The thought still made him shake his head in complete bewilderment, but it felt a little less alien to him now. Because of course he wanted to talk to Harry. Even as enemies, Draco had longed to talk to Harry. Now that he was finally getting his wish, he dare not question it.
“Ha!” Harry yelled. “I knew it.”
Draco smiled in spite of himself. “I beg your pardon?”
“Little bit,” he said, a gross understatement, before finishing the last of his first butterbeer and picking up the new one. He didn’t remember anyone ever asking him that question before.
Draco nodded numbly once again. Potter. The Stranger was
But he shifted off of Harry while Harry gently helped lift his hips so that Draco was sitting on the couch. Harry grabbed his glasses and shoved them back on his face. Then he leaned over Draco and placed a hand on each side of the couch beside Draco’s head, trapping him there. Harry gave him a quick peck, and then a second one.
Ron put his hands over Rose’s ears. “Fucking Malfoy? Really, Harry? Fucking
Draco nodded. “Alright.”
“You’re beautiful, too, Harry,” Draco told him. “I need you to know that. So, so beautiful.”
“And why, pray tell, should I be civil to the arsehole who fought against me in a war, held me prisoner in his house, and called my fiancee a mudblood?” Ron spat.
He knew his family was rich (the huge and classy manor was a dead giveaway) but he had never seen his parents use their wealth for trivial things: the odd party held in the ball room was it and the only reason he knew was from the leftovers he was brought and the mess there was to clean after the party was over.
“It still bothers me though...” Harry muttered to himself “Does it not bother you?”
They didn’t really know for how much time they stood there, kissing passionately as they released all their sexual tension, before they broke apart, both breathless.
The two of them spent their remaining time together talking and studying, generally enjoying each other’s company.
“Yes, ‘we’” Draco said boldly.
Harry sighed and sat down. He really didn’t want Draco to be subject to some untruthful rumors because he didn’t deserve it.
Then, after he became so weak and his hands started shaking so badly from the lack of nutrition and the effects of the torture curses he endured, his father started using him mainly as a ‘punching bag’.
As the food appeared on the tables the whispers started and random people (even from other schools) began coming up to him and expressing how sorry they felt for what happened and how they were glad he was alright now.
“Only eleven wands of this type have ever been made and I must say I am quite honored to have finally paired the last and only one with a White Moon Fish Fin core” Mr. Ollivander said as James and Lily paid for it.
“The Black Lake. I read that lots of creatures live in it such as a giant squid, grindylows and merepeople!” Draco said.
Sighing, he collapsed on his knees and wrapped his arms around himself as he finally let the tears fall. He had quickly learnt that crying angered his father even more, so he waited until after he’d gone to do so.
“But you’ll be on the other side of the castle!” Harry said.
“Isn’t there a way you can get out of this?” Harry pleaded.
Three weeks after their break up and he still was a mess, pining over his ex, who apparently didn’t seem to miss him in the slightest.
“What?”
“Oh... I hadn’t thought about that” he said.
“He’s a foster child” Lily mouthed and the doctor nodded.
“ALL CHAMPIONS PLEASE HEAD TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE MAZE” a loud magical voice sounded across the room.
“No. Probably not”
As Pansy chatted with Astoria, Blaise dragged him aside to speak privately with him.
Today was no different.
“Mr. Malfoy, please follow me” the kind witch behind the desk informed him with a smile. He thanked her as he made his way through the menacing black door.
Draco pressed his lips in a thin line and nodded.
“Yes, Sir” Nott’s voice trembled.
And recover what we took,
What more could anyone possibly want!
Draco smiled as well as he noticed a proud look on his mother’s face with the tail of his eye.
When Draco nodded, James took hold of his hand and apparated them outside the Manor’s grounds.
Another person who had constantly been by Draco’s bedside was Harry.
James pulled out a little silver key from his pocket and handed it to the goblin.
Lily suddenly understood what the problem was and judging by James’ expression he had too.
He read the labels on it.
“With all my heart” Harry said seriously.
He couldn’t move.
She glanced at Blaise, who was sitting next to Draco. He wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders as the blond leaned into the comfort and warmth that was the Italian man.
She looked like she wanted to protest.
“I saw you passing by my compartment. You looked on the verge of tears so I went to find you” Cedric said just as a single tear slipped from his left eye.
Draco nodded and smiled a little.
“I know where we can go: the Prefects Bathroom! The bathtub there is big enough for the both of us!” Cedric said as they quickly made their way to the fifth floor.
“But I think he already has. Mate, there’s a reason why he invited her to the Yule Ball and I’m telling you it’s because he likes her. I dare say she likes him too judging by what I’m seeing now” Ron nodded with his head to the pair and as Harry turned his head he saw the pair slow dancing in a tight embrace. Kate had rested her head on Draco’s shoulder.
“They’re beautiful” Kate said as she turned to him and smiled. He didn’t say anything and simply watched her gaze at the night sky.
At first they used him as a servant: making him wash the floors of his huge Manor, having him dust the countless artifacts on the shelves and sometimes even ordering him to clean all the mirrors and windows until they were shiny and perfectly polished.
“Draco, I have to show you something in the Gryffindor Common Room” Harry said as they passed right in front of the entrance portrait.
“Oh, well, don’t worry, we’ll get to that later. Isn’t there something else that maybe you want to get from the Manor?”
A tapping noise from outside the window distracted him.
Unfortunately both of them weren’t available for any comments regarding their relationship as I’m sure they were quite preoccupied with each other, if you know what I mean”
The two weren’t available for any comments.
He was surprised at how perfect it felt as their fingers entwined. Harry could feel the Malfoy signet ring as he pulled Draco a bit closer to him, enough to smell the cologne Draco used.
‘Here goes nothing...’ he thought. He would have to tell Harry what he went through.
They resumed their studying but not for long.
“Of course not! Why would you think that?”
“That was amazing! Great job Ced!” Draco heard the Hufflepuff’s friends congratulating him.
“What’s wrong?” he asked as he furrowed his eyebrows slightly.
As he broke the surface of the water he heard loud cheers and applauds surround him, but those didn’t matter: he had to get Draco, who still hadn’t woken up, safely back to land.
“The Hogwarts champion is: Cedric Diggory” as everyone started clapping and congratulating his friend, Draco could only sigh and clap halfheartedly.
Draco’s body wavered a bit and felt unstable.
Silently Draco got up and left the compartment, ignoring his friends calls for him to stay.
As they made their way to the bedroom, after making various stops down the hallway, he laid her down gently on the bed and began undressing her.
“I need one that’ll be able to make him breathe under water. This one will do” Draco said and pointed to a chapter in the book. Sev nodded.
The unexpected happened: Harry burst into tears and clutched at his mother.
Immediately he Flooed over to Ron and Hermione’s house. He needed them right now.
Ron placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
His eyes widened when he realized what was in the clearing: two bodies were floating there, tied to the floor of the lake with kelp.
“You expecting anyone?” he asked Astoria as he stilled over her.
“Okay, am I the only one who thinks that’s a bit creepy?” Lavender asked as a few of the other Gryffindors nodded.
“Harry, dear, what’s wrong?” Lily asked as the three of them left Draco and Kate alone.
“Perhaps...” he said and went to the very back of his store. He came back with an ancient looking box that was all dusty and took out from it a white wand that was very thin and simple looking yet elegant.
Lily and James stayed by his bedside as Draco sweated and dealt with the pain by closing his eyes and gritting his teeth.
“I think you’re amazing. You’re kind and loving and, to be honest, too smart for your own good. I like you because you’re different from others” Cedric said as he pushed back a strand of hair from Draco’s forehead.
“Maybe, but I think we have a higher chance of understanding it if we first find out which language this is. I suggest we research on some population that sounds like high shrieks” Draco said. Cedric nodded.
He shamelessly stared at her pert breasts.
“Because they’re Slytherins!” Ron exclaimed. Again with ‘being Slytherins’... was that supposed to enlighten him?
“Hello, sorry, to disturb you but have you seen Draco?” Harry turned his head and saw bloody Kate smiling down at him.
“If you want to, I think we should start with getting to know one another and establishing some sort of ‘relationship’ and then we can-”  Sev said but Draco interrupted him.
“And... how do you feel about... this?” Sev asked him cautiously after a minute. Draco understood the man was quite embarrassed.
“You don’t know what Hogwarts is?” James asked him.
‘Oh God! If only he knew...’ James thought as he looked at Draco.
Draco liked Elizabeth but sometimes he didn’t understand her.
He was too occupied thinking about Draco and his mysterious absence.
Before Draco had associated black with cold and emptiness, but now, as he watched the golden light of the Sun fill the room, he changed his mind. Maybe black wasn’t so bad...
He shook his head.
Soon they started opening the presents and Draco enjoyed the scene of James bouncing in  joy in his seat when he saw what Draco had gotten him.
She blushed slightly at the compliment.
“Draco” he heard a distant voice call and saw a blurry figure in black over him.
“I know but I heard him with my own ears. If I didn’t I probably wouldn’t believe it myself” Draco said.
“Oh... uhm... I’m not sure...”
“Could you at least eat a little bit?” Michael asked hopefully as he offered Draco an apple.
“OUR CHAMPIONS ARE READY FOR THE SECOND TASK, WHICH WILL START ON MY WHISTLE. THEY HAVE PRECISELY AN HOUR TO RECOVER WHAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM. FLEUR DELACOUR WILL NOT BE COMPETING TODAY, AS SHE WASN’T ABLE TO SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF THE EGG” Dumbledore said.
One of them finally worked and as the door swung open, he gasped in shock: laying on the floor in a pool of blood was a young boy.
Draco had left him.
He contemplated telling Anthony, Terry and Michael but reconsidered. He was glad Ravenclaw and Gryffindor were now getting along but he knew the moment he told anyone about this his whole friend group would know and in approximately a few days the whole school.
The only good thing he had come out with from his investigations was a new friend: Cedric Diggory, an older Hufflepuff boy.
Harry visibly blanched.
“Sorry to say but if that was a joke, it kinda sucked” he said.
She was smart too and Draco liked her a lot.
He quickly located him as he was seated at his favorite spot in Library: a window seat with a few big comfy chairs and a little table.
“I knew it!” he screamed as they entered an empty classroom.
“Harry, could you give Draco and I a moment alone please? I think we have quite a lot to talk about” Kate said and Harry looked at Draco before nodding and tightly smiling at the brunette. He gritted his teeth as he left the Hospital Wing.
“Your parents informed us. Plus... uhm... Rita Skeeter may have written a few articles about you” Kate said.
“I would do anything, Draco” Harry said seriously while cupping the other man’s pale face.
Under the article there was a picture of Draco irradiating happiness while delivering his speech for the world to hear.
‘Because! You’re meant to be with me!’ the voice screamed in his head. He ignored it; after all, he didn’t want to scare him away.
He couldn’t believe it. He hadn’t seen her in the longest time!
“Harry” Hermione said, trying to calm him down.
A minute later Harry ran down the stairs with his coat half fastened and his hair wilder than usual. He was carrying his trunk and Hedwig’s cage in his hands and with his teeth his glasses.
“Hold it!” a girl’s voice called from behind him, so he turned around and saw a girl was running towards him. She had shoulder length dark brown hair and dark brown eyes as well. A few freckles decorated her otherwise pale face. She smiled sweetly at him.
“Good! Then you can follow me! I’ll be taking ya up to Hogwarts as you’ve not been sorted yet” Hagrid said.
He smiled politely, but was distracted. Right now he was looking for his blond Slytherin. He was, after all, entitled to a victory kiss.
Harry looked at him horrified.
————————————————————————————
“Calm down, Harry. It’s fine”
Lily thought about this possibility and conceded her son was right. Only one idea came to mind.
————————————————————————————
“Your parents were shouting at a ministry man and let it slip because of their anger” she said.
Clearly Nott’s intent was to humiliate him in front of the entire school but Draco wasn’t going to give him that satisfaction. This time he wouldn’t run away with his tail between his legs just because Nott insulted him: he had been thrown much more hurtful insults by his own father. Nott was just a warmup compared to Lucius Malfoy.
“Draco, Love, I’m back!” Harry called as he exited the fireplace and went searching for his boyfriend.
When Draco looked at her with indecision she added: “No one has to know about this. Only you and me”
“-which is fine by the way” James added.
Step by step he wondered all over London and soon his feet brought him to one of his favorite night clubs.
He had been feeling a lot better lately: his health had almost completely healed in the past month and a half and generally he felt normal for once.
“I don’t think I’m ready for another relationship just yet, Blaise”
The main themes of the room seemed to be the colors grey and black: the bedpost was black and the bed was covered in grey sheets; the desk was made out of black wood while the comfy chair was grey with black designs: the wardrobe was of the same material and color of the desk.
“Probably” Cedric said tiredly. Draco eyed him up warily.
He resumed his reading with Snoodle on his shoulder until a knock sounded on the compartment’s door and an explosion of noise filled the air.
He also didn’t want to involve his parents or Sev in this as it would be too awkward.
He felt hot tears make their way down his cheeks. Soon those single drops became a river of tears as he ran away towards the Black Lake, not caring that it was December and it was freezing outside. He fell to his knees.
“I wish Harry and James were half as tidy as you” she said as she looked around the room.
Overall it was a pretty pleasant ride.
“Hi! Have you seen a black rabbit anywhere around here? I’m afraid one of my dogs accidentally killed its mum and I don’t want the poor baby alone” the elderly woman explained.
“Well not all of them but some” Hermione said.
In that moment, Harry knew he had lost.
“What do you want to be?” Harry asked as the two sat down on a large flat stone by the lake.
It was all he ever wanted: to be appreciated.
After they finished dinner, Draco offered to clean the dishes but Lily wasn’t having it, so James asked Draco if he wanted to rest for a bit, to which he agreed. Honestly he had been feeling a bit tired.
She looked closely at her friend and sighed.
Draco sniffed one last time and nodded, grateful Cedric was such a kind person who was always ready to help someone in need.
Draco’s eyes went blurry for a moment.
A deep voice that sounded vaguely irritated said “Come in”.
Evidently he would be forced up in the air by Harry, who seemed to enjoy the sport just as much as his father.
‘Can’t even mind their own bloody business...’  he thought to himself as he opened a door and ran straight into someone... hard. This person luckily seemed to be able to steady themselves before they could fall but Harry, being angry and distracted, fell down on the floor like a sack of potatoes. He groaned loudly.
And the more he thought the more he felt hurt, betrayed, used and... angry.
As he made his way towards his international portkey he looked back one last time and waved to his family.
“-so we planned to lock you and Draco in this room until you proclaimed your undying love to him” Ron finished.
It was huge.
The goblin opened the door with the key and waited outside for them to enter.
Draco trusted Harry and knew his friend would never lie to him, so he let the matter of the gifts drop, although he did ask that Harry reduce drastically the quantity which he gave him.
“She also said this basically confirmed her theory about you and I being together because I saved you...” Cedric said.
Hermione rushed to Harry’s apartment.
Yours,
Ron sighed.
She then picked up Snoodle and cradled him in her hand. Since Draco wasn’t able to look after him, Lily and James had been looking after the bunny.
Once outside it didn’t take a long time to spot his date as she was standing alone looking at the stars. No one else was outside due to the cold weather.
Taking a deep breath he started walking making sure he made absolutely no noise in hope of not attracting too much attention on himself.
“Because she wants you! And she knows I’m a possible threat to her since- well...” Harry blushed.
“I love it! It’s so much tidier than mine” Harry said as he sat on the bed, earning a panicked cringe from Draco.
He stood up and went to answer it.
Lily and James smiled.
Cedric didn’t have problems with Sev.
“You were found bleeding and unconscious in a cell in Malfoy Manor. You were brought here at St. Mungos and your parents were arrested for child abuse. They will be serving a lot of time in prison so you don’t have to worry about ever seeing them again” she said and waited for some sort of reaction.
Draco nodded.
“IT’S NOT HERE WITH YOU?! W-WHY?! WHY WOULD YOU CONDEMN YOUR POOR BROOM TO A SAD LIFE IN A DARK, LONELY CUPBOARD WHEN YOU CAN KEEP IT HERE WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES, READY TO GO FOR A SPIN?!” Harry said (more like shouted) at him and Draco cringed. Harry definitely got this *passion* from his father.
Dumbledore’s welcoming speech did include news of the tournament and of the other two schools who would be competing.
“Cedric calm down, you’ll be fine” Draco repeated. Cedric has been in this state since this morning and by now Draco was pretty desperate to get him to calm down.
“Thank you” Draco smiled.
Lily pointed at him with her head so her husband started speaking.
He glanced down and saw Draco was smiling at him.
“Oh please don’t look at me like that!” Draco said as Snoodle turned around and made him face his back.
He then summoned the Healing Potion he himself had made a few days prior as a Potions homework assignment.
“What happened?” Lily asked.
“Harry! Hurry or you’ll miss the train!” James said as he took Draco’s trunk. He knew his son was still very thin and didn’t have much muscle to keep that heavy trunk up by himself so he helped him. Even after one year Draco still had trouble with eating...
A minute later Sirius and two other aurors were helping him move safely the unconscious boy.
“Her name’s Kate and she’s really nice! She speaks english as well” he said, avoiding the question.
“Oh, please. Why would she even want to tear us apart!?”
Draco nodded absentmindedly. He was thinking of what sort of relationship he could form with Sev.
“Oh... I’m sorry...” Draco was unsure about what to say.
“Here, I brought you your medicine, son” James said as he gently sat down next to Draco’s bed and placed four different sets of potions and two pills on the bedside table.
“Well, you don’t have to, but I suggest you do. It’s good for you if you have a sum of money to keep with you, not necessarily a lot, just enough for an emergency or something” James said.
The last thing he wanted was for Cedric to blame him for stealing all his glory or something because he really didn’t mean to and hated being in the spotlight.
James considered buying some Pepper Imps (they allowed you to breathe fire and made smoke come out from your ears and nose) and giving them to Draco as a joke since he knew Draco would eat anything he told him to, but then he remembered Draco was quite tenderhearted and wasn’t like Harry, who enjoyed pranking and getting pranked. So, he refrained himself from buying them.
He hadn’t realized he had started crying.
“Thank Merlin for your blond hair or I wouldn’t have recognized you. My son’s told me quite a lot about you, you know!” the man was slightly breathless, probably from rushing up the steps. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“My boy! That’s MY BOY” Mr. Diggory had cried out as he grasped his son’s shoulders and turned him around.
“Don’t worry, judging by the way you had her against the wall I’d say you scored pretty good last night. Besides you are a very good dancer” he mused.
The boy settled on one of the couches, next to Lavender, and everyone silently waited to hear why he was there. They suspected they already knew the reason.
“Hi I’m Harry! You must be Draco! It’s a pleasure to finally meet you!” he said as he walked up to him, slapped away the handshake Draco was offering him and instead hugged him tight.
“He performed a type of highly difficult healing magic. He transferred some of his own magical blood to Mr. Diggory, to keep him alive” Dumbledore muttered.
“Just ask him to the Yule Ball, mate!” Ron suggested, tired of hearing his friend fret on the blond.
Lavender shrugged and took a sip of Pumpkin Juice out of her goblet.
They were standing by the ground floor window and Draco hadn’t noticed them.
“Come seek us where our voices sound,
Turning he head, she then laughed out loud when her husband was incapable of forming a coherent sentence.
“This is the Malfoy signet ring: you can see your family crest engraved on it. It was worn by your ancestors and now you. It will pass on to your children, if you ever have any, and so on” James said but Draco didn’t give any visible response as he was busy staring at the jewel in his hand with a small pout.
Staying silent however meant unwillingly giving Nott ‘permission’ to bully him as much as he wanted.
Harry shrugged.
The bunny was still there, laying down on a scrunched up piece of cloth. Its fluffy tail was moving with the light breeze.
Draco looked at the mirror one last time before leaving.
You’re so unwilling to admit your own faults that you’re always blaming me for every single thing. Well, I can’t be with someone as immature as you anymore.
Draco looked at the wand in his hand warily.
“I’m happy and excited. I like spending time with him: he’s so nice and sweet, he’s so good with Snoodle and he’s soooo cute when he’s shy” Harry gushed without even realizing what he was saying.
“Uhm... so...” Kate blushed.
“You show him that you’ve changed, that you’re willing to compromise instead of dictating the rules. And Harry, make it as sincere as possible. You’re the one at fault here, so you can’t just go to him with a bratty attitude. Maybe give it a few days before you talk to him”
Lily shook her head and fixed him up until he was presentable. After all, Harry was the most disorganized one between the two of them.
“For Quidditch of course!” James said “It’s the best fun game: the object of the game is to score more points than your opponents. Each goal is worth ten points and catching the Golden Snitch is worth one-hundred and fifty points. Catching the Snitch will end the game. You play in a pitch with...” James carried on explaining the rules of Quidditch (which to Draco seemed to go on forever) as they entered the shop.
Draco buried his head in James’ chest and cried, letting out all his frustrations.
He started pacing the length of his dorm room as he thought about what he could do regarding his issue. Snoodle watched him from his bed.
“Because... it’s ugly...” Draco said quietly. She was sure this time her husband was going to have a proper stroke as he was staring with his mouth open at Draco, who was now looking at the floor as if he’d just done something he shouldn’t have.
He collected his trunk and Snoodle’s cage and went downstairs where his parents were waiting to accompany them to the train station.
“Sorry to bother you but I wanted to speak with you. Do you have a moment? Alone possibly...?” Cedric said as Draco turned to face Kate.
“I studied privately” he answered without hesitation. This was what his parents had told him and Harry to say should anyone ask them about Draco’s education prior to Hogwarts.
“At least you won: you should be happy!” Draco tried to cheer up.
“Great... just great...” Draco muttered as he frowned but immediately stopped when he felt one of his stitches throb.
It didn’t matter what house he ended up in. He just wished to be happy and not to be like his father.
“He’s like an evil mastermind plotting world domination” Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear, making him laugh out loud.
One moment he was dancing on the floor after drinking alcohol of some sort and suddenly the next he was in bed with a total stranger, pounding him into the mattress.
“I’m so-”
“Hello, Mr. Malfoy” this woman said as she gave him a small smile.
Lucius’ mouth contorted into a sneer.
“I know you probably don’t want to hear this but as your friends we’re really worried about you, Dray...” Michael said as he cautiously approached Draco’s bed and sat down on it.
“I promise I won’t tell anyone” Cedric finished for him.
Even though he was out of breath and exhausted, he took the time to thoroughly kiss his girlfriend goodnight as the two of them feel asleep in each other’s arms.
————————————————————————————
“Wow... it’s so... elegant” Harry gasped as he saw the “Grey Room”.
“Do you like it?” he asked nervously. Everything with Harry had gone well so far.
Sighing he sat on the sofa and started doing some of his work-related paperwork while his wife cooked dinner in the other room. He would have helped her, but he hadn’t even offered as he already knew the answer would be ‘no’. He was a complete disaster in the kitchen: this fact was proven by the ‘hilarious’ story Sirius liked to tell of the time he tried to cook some pasta and ended up burning down the stove.
They talked and got to know each other and Draco found he really enjoyed her sense of humor.
He decided not to tell anyone about this conversation.
Yes, he had been with Kate but come to think about it he had never been attracted to her sexually. He loved her personality but didn’t feel the actual need to do anything intimate with her. They held hands, cuddled and kissed but that was just about it.
Soon he had her moaning as his talented tongue and fingers pleasured her.
“C’mon, dear. I’ll apparate us. The house’s name is Godric’s Hollow” James said as he took Draco’s hand while Lily held onto his arm.
“Kate, wait, I’m not anorexic or bulimic or suicidal or anything. I don’t not eat because I want to be thin, in reality I really want to eat in a healthy portion!” Draco said urgently.
I’ve missed you, you know. The house just hasn’t felt the same without you living with me in it: it feels colder, hollow, like something’s missing. You.
“You don’t have to wear it if you don’t want to, Draco” he said as he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder but the blond didn’t register what he said as his mind was occupied with various thoughts.
He woke up late the day after.
“WHAT!?” he screamed. Draco jumped in is seat next to him and Harry flinched.
“She also wrote everything about your health conditions: about your respiratory problems, about your head surgery and about your-your heart stopping... is this true? Did your heart really stop?” Cedric said.
She truly was a remarkable woman and he valued his friendship with her a great deal.
An idea came to Harry’s mind.
His new friends also were very much fun and he liked them a lot as well.
“Why is Draco talking to her!? Why is he not sending her away!?” he cried. He didn’t want his Draco talking with stunning girls.
“Really?”
“What makes you think he’ll be in Gryffindor?” Lily asked him. In her opinion Draco was more of a Hufflepuff or a Ravenclaw based on his kindness/shyness and on his love of books.
“I’ll give you the tour of the house” Lily said as she took him around and pointed out the spaces and finally stopped in front of the spare bedroom.
“Yeah, especially with that hot girl making eyes at him!” Dean added. Harry turned his gaze on Draco again and saw him laughing and talking with the girl.
“Yeah it is now, but it won’t be if you get yourself killed” he said.
Draco felt his eyes start to water again as he finished the letter and tossed it into the fire in his dorm.
Draco stopped and turned to face his friend.
Since the Ravenclaw table was in the center of the hall he could clearly see the new arrivals and took a good look at the girl: her long brown hair was twisted into soft curls and it framed the delicate features of her face beautifully, she had blue eyes and a pale and delicate complexion. She was a bit shorter than the other girls and was walking at the back of the group along with another two girls, both blonde.
Elizabeth shivered and suppressed a moan when he started blowing in her ear.
He looked at his pet bunny and, despite himself, wished someone was there with him like Sev or his parents. He knew however that he couldn’t inform any of them about what had been going on between him and Harry.
Should the consistency be a problem you can easily thin it with any regular potion thinner as long as the potion and the thinner remain on a proportion of 2/3 potion and 1/3 thinner”
Draco had died all alone, scared and helpless.
At that Draco slapped his arm as hard as he could manage.
“What a waste...” he muttered. His eyes scanned the table for his friends and found them talking and laughing together.
“Well, we could start slow, maybe hold hands” he said as he grabbed Draco’s right hand and encased it with his own.
That got all the group’s attention immediately as they looked at the girl in disbelief.
Quietly Lily slipped away, found what she was looking for and had it wrapped in paper while she paid for it separately and returned to her husband and son.
As he opened the door he was shocked to find the one and only Hermione Granger-Weasley standing in front of him, looking just as shocked as he was.
No this couldn’t be happening. Not again.
“Dear Draco,
“Now, let’s go and dance!” she said as she set down her glass on their table.
“But it’s so... green” Harry said and readily covered his mouth with his hands.
“Because I’m not hungry right now and I would throw it up later if I ate it” he said.
“Why should I? Everything that happened could be explained simply: you like Elizabeth, so you kissed her, and meanwhile you were playing me as another one of your cruel pranks!” Draco said as he looked closely at Harry.
“Did you see the papers?” he asked frantically as he basically shoved the paper in Ron’s hands. As the two read, Harry started pacing around the room.
Meanwhile outside the Hospital Wing...
“Sure thing! I’ll see you here tomorrow alright? Bye!” she interrupted him again before rushing off.
Draco found himself looking into those emerald eyes once more.
“Yes, Draco?”
“But what if I can’t? Everyone is counting on me to win-”
‘Mission Accomplished’ he thought.
Draco knew their time together would most likely end soon so he tried to spend as much time as possible with his girlfriend.
He sat down by the Ravenclaw’s bedside and watched him ‘sleep’: he was... beautiful. Breathtaking. Even now, after all that had happened.
Since then he had noticed little changes in his behavior and this had caused general gratitude in Gryffindor house towards him.
“HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID!”
It had never happened for Harry to be so blatantly mad about something as to shout at him.
I swear on my parents’ graves that I never ever wanted to hurt you or make you think that you weren’t important to me.
Overall he had stayed at St. Mungo’s for four days.
“He’s my godfather” Draco had said deciding to act on impulse.
He had spoken with Cedric about this and the Hufflepuff just said: “We can’t choose who we love”
He stood up and went up to Draco’s room.
“Perhaps we can do this later. Let’s let him rest for a bit” she whispered and Blaise nodded in agreement.
The boy had woken up only two days before and was in a very unstable condition: his magic was drained from sustaining Cedric and this had taken a toll on his already weak health.
I was wrong to criticize your work, as I’ve clearly seen recently with the release of the Spattergroit Cure that your brilliant mind came up with. I wanted to congratulate you earlier on that by the way but I couldn’t find a way to reach you.
When they were finished they placed them all under the tree. Let’s just say you could tell who had wrapped what. Draco’s presents were neat while Harry’s were a bit of a mess to be honest: the wrapping paper was all wrinkled and the bows were completely crooked and out of proportions.
“Do you really think I’m brave?” he asked shyly. Out of all the adjectives he could be described with ‘brave’ wasn’t one of them.
Hermione and Ron were still slightly mad at him, although they had agreed to help him.
“You’re right. I’m not normal. I’m not like you others, I’m not fun or impulsive or hot headed. I’m unlike anyone of your other friends, Harry”
He had to hurry.
When Draco woke up about an hour and a half later it was early in the afternoon.
“Sorry if I ruined this night for you, Hermione” he apologized and before Hermione could respond that she didn’t mind he had left the Great Hall.
“Cedric owes his life to this brave young man” Madam Pomfrey sighed as she finally patched up Cedric’s last two wounds.
What do you think? Might there be something more going on here?
Finally the blue and white glow was directly in front of him and as he took one last final ‘step’ (more like crawl) he blindly reached out and grabbed the glowy object.
“Look, Ron, I’m sorry but it’s not my fault. She roped me into going before I could say anything” Draco apologized.
After that they headed to Scribbulus Writing Implements where they bought a few quills (Draco particularly liked one that had a Peacock’s feather), ink and some parchment.
Immediately Draco’s grey eyes opened, he shifted onto his side and a lot of lake water spilled out of his mouth as he coughed and spluttered. Cedric was so horrified by the amount of water that came out from his lungs and mouth that he didn’t even register Viktor emerging form the lake with his own ‘object’: his best friend from Durmstrang.
“What about water?” she asked when she finished.
“Why would they listen to you?”
Draco took the smooth red colored wood with both hands and examined it: it was nice and he liked the simple shape of it.
“I promise I’ll try not to” Draco said as the two separated. Draco yawned.
As he and Kate left the Great Hall he found his Gryffindor friends were waiting for him.
“Harry, if you’re so sure he’s going to choose you, then why are you here instead of at home with him?” Ron asked after a few seconds.
————————————————————————————
“Well, I wouldn’t want to be in Slytherin” Ron muttered.
Lily nodded and smiled at him.
“We were able to determine the boy was beaten quite regularly from the wounds he sported. Have you gotten hold of his parents?”
It had been a gift from Snape for Christmas and Harry couldn’t help but thank the man as the scent was so... Draco. The subtle smell he had come to associate with the blond was of vanilla paired with something else... something only Draco smelled like. Unfortunately Harry had never been able to pinpoint what the scent was...
Me, me, me, Me, ME! That’s all you can say!
Draco ignored his fatigue and kept on reading until finally his hard work paid off.
—————————————————————————————
“It means that your deepest and most desperate desire is to ultimately be happy. It does make sense for a boy who has known nothing but solitude and pain all his life to want happiness” Professor Dumbledore said.
‘Manipulation skills?’ he thought.
He entered and found Draco laying on his bed with his arms wrapped around his stomach and curled up around himself in discomfort.
Draco frowned.
Draco felt like an animal at the zoo under his gaze.
Draco’s been my friend for a very long time and I’d hate to see him unhappy, so if you waste this opportunity he is so graciously giving you I will hunt you down and destroy you. My friend is a good man and he deserves to be treated well” she said.
The only thing that hadn’t gotten better were his headaches.
“What else did they do to you?” Harry asked Draco quietly.
‘Potter isn’t gay. He won’t want you’ the voice, this time sounding an awful lot like his father, spoke in his mind.
So he had sat back on his broom and watched James play and have fun like an eight year old kid. In the end it had been Lily who reprimanded James because he wasn’t letting Draco play and was only showing off.
Draco”
Draco Malfoy”
“Sorry I bothered you, Hermione, but I really need someone I can trust to confide in” he said.
He had to get away from the haunting sight in front of him.
“I-” they suddenly both said at the same time and blushed.
Draco understood Harry was in one of his sensible moods.
“Yes?”
Grey eyes met brown ones.
The family settled on the sofa by the fire with mugs of hot chocolate and enjoyed a very pleasant evening together.
Draco immediately offered her his coat.
He was immediately engulfed in a big hug.
“Although I should tell you something first” Draco muttered softly in her ear. His hand lingered next to her ear along with his soft lips.
“Someone had to eventually. It was nothing” she said with a dismissive wave of her hand.
In the meantime, James took out all their purchases from her bag: he sent the robes and clothes to wash and dry themselves so that they would be clean by the time Draco woke up; he also brought the magically shrunken purchases to Draco’s room and quietly set them on his desk. Draco could organize them when he wanted to.
It was past dinner time so he just stopped by the kitchens and grabbed a green apple to eat before heading to bed.
The news had spread quickly in the hospital and quite a few people had already came in to express their sadness for him, even if he wasn’t conscious yet. It was nice of them.
“Don’t worry: they’re not all that bad. They point out how despicable the Ministry’s actions were, placing in such peril a young and unhealthy boy” Cedric said in a tight voice.
“We know, son” James chuckled.
People were nice to him and even the teachers liked him (after all, he was a good student): his head of house, Professor Flitwick, was a good man and had thoroughly explained all the rules and activities here at Hogwarts.
“Yes, I know that, but what if he doesn’t like me that way?”
Finally he regained his bearings after a minute or so.
“I’ll meet you there. I have to discuss something with Elizabeth here but I’ll join you in a few minutes alright?” his friends all nodded except for Harry, who was busy glaring at the girl standing a few steps behind Draco, looking at the blond boy as if he were a piece of cake.
“Yes. Theodore Nott and his two goons will think twice before deciding they want to hurt my godson” Professor Snape said darkly.
“I’ll see you tomorrow alright? Bye!” Draco said and hurried up the last few stairs to Ravenclaw Tower.
“Did you notice how Draco didn’t deny being gay? Maybe I do have a chance after all! Oh and when we get together it’s going to be so great! I already know what we’re going to do: taking long walks together because Draco loves being outside, cuddle by the fire after a long day, hold hands and rub our noses together and study together because Draco would be worried about my grades and would make me study” Harry said excitedly. His friends stared at him.
Hermione sighed to herself.
He thought of all the times Harry had played cruel jokes on people just for the sake of it.
Also, he couldn’t help but ask himself: did he even like girls?
As James helped him sit up and take his medicine, he felt tears pricking his eyes.
Auror James Potter quickly cast a ‘Tempus’ as he practically ran through the corridor that lead to the meeting room: fortunately he was just in time.
—————————————————————————————
“Yes, dear, I did. It’s quite useful if you don’t want visitors to know the password to your dormitory. All house portraits have this ability, but of course, being a Ravenclaw you wouldn’t know that since you ravens have a knocker who asks clever questions instead of a portrait” she said.
“I k-know it’s wrong and-and I shouldn’t like him but I d-do and it hurts to see him with Kate. I was going to-to tell him but-but” Harry said in a rush as he sniffed and cried.
He studied closely Draco’s hands.
No no no no NO! This was NOT how it was supposed to go!
“O-Okay...” he didn’t really know what to say.
Fortunately the nameless stranger from last night had already left.
Draco bit his lip.
“Are you sure?”
All of these actions were of course accompanied by a string of taunts and insults.
As Draco limped inside the house he ‘walked’ as quickly as possible from his old cell, got the object he was looking for and went back out. James was still there, waiting for him with a big smile.
Draco promised himself he wouldn’t cry over Harry Potter and he wanted to keep that promise.
He didn’t go outside his dorms that day and completely ignored the food his friends brought him. He didn’t even pick up a book or copy his friend’s notes.
He had just gained another relative and he couldn’t wait to get to know him.
He had even made a lot of progress with his eating disorder and his therapist said he would be completely healed in about a year if he kept on going like he was now. These things took time anyway...
She backed away from him until the back of her legs came into contact with the sofa.
It is also said that this isn’t the first time they meet after Miss Greengrass’ return to England!
“I can’t lose you, Draco. Every time I close my eyes I see you laying there wet, pale and unmoving and people asking if you’re dead and...” Harry trailed off trying to gesticulate with his hands.
He moaned into the kiss at the feeling of the lean body pressed against his own. His arms wrapped around Draco as the blond opened his mouth slightly, giving Harry access.
“Harry you’re never going to get the chance to be with Draco if you keep on stalling” Hermione said.
They also went to Slug & Jiggers Apothecary and Sugarplum’s Sweets Shop although he didn’t get anything except for a Blood-flavored Lollipop. Harry said he was nutters for liking those but Draco didn’t listen to him.
The pounding on the door worsened his headache as he got up and rushed over to open it.
“We’re here to purchase a wand for this young man” James said as he patted Draco on the shoulder.
“Hello boys, I hope you’re hungry! Today we’re having roast chicken with mashed potatoes. I hope you like it, Draco. By the way, is there any kind of food that you don’t like or that you can’t eat?”
His healers said it would be a slow recovery and that it would take time for his magic to fully recover.
Draco internally sighed.
He waited nervously for their reactions.
“No, I’m fourteen as well! I came along because I‘m part of the student newspaper and am here to report on the tournament” she explained.
If Harry had thought Draco couldn’t get any cuter then he was wrong.
Harry felt like dying when he saw those grey eyes fill with anguish and sadness.
Harry/Draco couldn’t have one moment alone with his crush and frankly it was frustrating, seeing also as how close they had actually gotten to kissing the last time they were alone together.
As she left his flat, he realized that for the first time in over a month he may actually stand a chance of getting Draco back.
“Come in” she heard her son say softly.
Lily smiled patiently.
Draco closed his eyes.
“I can’t actually believe he’s your godfather. I mean, Snape doesn’t seem like a man who likes children”
“Why don’t you and Blaise dance? I’m going speak with St Mungo’s Head Healer” Draco suggested and watched as the Italian man glared at him as he was dragged onto the dance floor.
Tears began to fall as he struggled to come to terms with what had happened.
He was reminded of Kate once more, only this time he wouldn’t let Draco go so easily.
‘I’ll never remember all of that...’ he thought as everyone sat down and Lavender (?) took the seat beside him and scooted over too close to him for comfort.
Meanwhile Lily Potter couldn’t help but admire this little boy’s courage at wearing a ring he associated with horrible memories.
“What?”
“Harry we passed the ‘a few’ mark about two months ago” Draco said. Harry smirked and the blond rolled his eyes.
“He’ll probably be in the Library studying his ass off or something” Ron muttered, not looking up from his Quidditch magazine.
He cried as he clutched at the Slytherin robes, shaking his head frantically.
He would never see that bright smile again. He would never see those grey eyes light up in mirth, that mouth smirk at him, that melodic voice call him.
“What do you want to take?”
Overall everything was going pretty well, until one night...
“Sorry about earlier, Draco. I didn’t mean to shout at you” Harry said sheepishly.
He watched the owl fly away.
He could only listen to the vague and distant voices around him.
Ron’s eyes softened slightly.
It really was cute.
Chief Horkins and Sirius also left: Chief had to regroup the team and collect reports while Sirius had some business to attend to back at the Ministry.
Lily and James were thrilled to see them and immediately started asking them about their time at school, their grades and their friends.
Draco chuckled slightly.
This time James and Lily looked at him as if he’d just sprouted two heads.
He looked so peaceful. She smiled at the sight.
Or could he?
‘Uh oh’ he thought. They both looked furious.
But what was he doing here?
He had told his Gryffindor and Ravenclaw friends about him and they hadn’t disapproved of him meeting other people.
Nott immediately stopped laughing.
Harry had managed to understand what he had said and looked at him sadly.
Draco and Lily thanked her and left.
“He’ll be just fine if he manages to eat some more” Lily said.
“They abused him in every possible way minus sexually. A child shouldn’t have to go through that... Lily contacted me a few months after they took him in (she knows I’m Draco’s godfather) and confided in me. She asked if I wanted to meet him but I couldn’t bring myself to say yes... I should have been there for this little sweet boy and yet I left him alone with those beasts simply because I was too stupid to see what was right in front of my own two eyes. I should have known something was amiss when he didn’t come to Hogwarts for his education. I simply thought they decided to send him elsewhere, perhaps at Durmstrang…”
“Please?” he pleaded. She looked at him for a moment and nodded.
And while you're searching, ponder this;
“Always so serious. I’ll be fine, Draco!” Cedric said as he patted Draco’s shoulder.
“Look, Harry: if I asked Lavender out to the Yule Ball then you can do it as well” Ron encouraged him.
Cedric looked at him with wide eyes.
Another relatively good thing was that the pin was in the lower back of Draco’s head and it hadn’t been necessary to shave his whole head but only a little spot which was almost unnoticeable. He would have a little scar but it would be covered by his hair so it didn’t matter too much. He already had a few scars around his body so he didn’t much care if another one was added to his collection.
“Swart” he said curtly.
Nott was shocked into silence with his mouth hanging open and a few people in the Great Hall gasped in shock.
As the year progressed Draco got closer to his friends (including Cedric) and got to know them well.
He was quickly running out of options.
He turned his head and saw a brown owl he didn’t recognize was knocking on his window.
The ceiling was lit with hundreds of floating candles and it was spelled to look like a night sky full of stars.
As the Hufflepuff left, the room remained silent.
When Draco broke their embrace he immediately placed the mat on his desk and rearranged everything neatly so that they were in their original positions.
————————————————————————————
“I just meant that all we have to do is determine which one is Draco’s best option between Potter and Astoria”
He swam towards the voice and was startled by what he saw: a creature with greyish skin/scales, long greenish hair, golden yellow eyes and a silver tail was singing. It looked nothing like the painting of the mermaid in the Prefects’ Bathroom. He recognized this creature as a Selkie.
He treated the many cuts and bruises his friend had and immediately healed them all.
The excitement people felt for this medical discovery and advancement was shown and printed all over the papers.
“All of them?” he asked.
“I can’t wait!”
‘He’s not used to physical contact that isn’t abuse’ she mouthed at him and he nodded.
“Love...” he whispered again and gently blew on Draco’s face.
He furrowed his eyebrows. How did she know-
He knocked on the door and waited.
He entered the Great Hall and looked around for Kate but didn’t find her.
Lily chuckled a bit but stopped when she noticed it made the boy uncomfortable. She reminded herself that Draco isn’t used to people being friendly and kind to him. She promised herself in that moment she would love this boy like a true mother and do everything to make him feel loved.
Again Lily stored them in her bag.
“DRACO MALFOY AND ASTORIA GREENGRASS COUPLE OF THE MOMENT!
‘He was the one at fault, not you’ he reminded himself.
“What is your favorite food, Draco?”
However he did make them swear on their Gryffindor honor they wouldn’t try to do anything because it would only make it worser for him.
“Oh. What are you having?” she asked as she looked at his meal.
Draco got for James one of the latest models of broom servicing kits which included a shiny wood polish that apparently did something incredible to your broom.
“What would happen to the boy’s parents should they be guilty of abusing him? And most importantly, what would happen to the boy himself?” the healer asked as they started walking toward the room the boy was sleeping in.
James nodded and smiled at his wife.
A few minutes passed in silence as the couple watched Draco sleep.
Harry kept on glancing at Draco but the blond never glanced back.
“I promise you, Snoodle. No one could ever take your place” at this the bunny gave a twitch in his ears to signify he was interested in what Draco was saying.
“And I’m Seamus”
Gasping in delight he hugged her tightly. Her delicate frame feeling familiar in his arms.
Just as Crabbe was about to punch him a deep and familiar voice sounded in the corridor.
“DRACO. DRACO OH MY GOD DRACO!” Harry said desperately as he shook the blond.
“Good. Use your Patronus to notify everyone you’ve found something worth checking out. We’re leaving in two minutes: apparate outside the wards, after we’ve breached, you may proceed with the raid” the head auror ordered as they prepared to leave.
“You don’t need to apologize!” Harry said as he got up from his bed.
“There are only two causes: physical and mental exhaustion. The second one is much rarer and only occurs in determined circumstances” the healer finished the sentence grimly.
Draco was immediately taken into a very delicate and long surgery and the pin was removed successfully.
Everyone turned to look at him and suddenly he felt very shy. He smiled tentatively.
Michael nodded.
He would have said ‘I tried everything I could’ but he knew that wasn’t true.
We cannot sing above the ground,
“In the broom cupboard with the rest of my Quidditch stuff” Draco said.
“Oh, how you hurt me! I shall never speak to you again!” he said/laughed. Draco rolled his eyes. He was glad their ‘sexuality lessons’, as he had started to call them, hadn’t made their friendship awkward.
He nodded.
He thought about all this as he sat in the Great Hall for the Welcoming Feast.
“Here, I have an idea” she said and pulled out her wand. It was a nice light brown color.
As their lips met everything around them spun and suddenly they were left alone in their own little world.
“I was down in what seemed to be like a cold dungeon, which consisted in a few different rooms. When I tried to open the last door, I found it was locked by a complex charm and I had to use quite a few unlocking spells to get it open. Immediately I saw the boy, laying on the floor in a puddle of blood. As I rushed over to him I checked for vitals and found he was still alive, thankfully, so I called for help and we brought him here. The healers have been tending to him for about twenty minutes” James said as the chief wrote down what he was saying.
When they were inside James excitedly picked a variety of sweets he suggested Draco tried: a Chocolate Frog, a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, a Pumpkin Pastie, a Cauldron Cake, a bundle of Liquorice Wands and a Sugar Quill.
He had heard of apparating before because his father sometimes did it when he came to his cell instead of walking down to the dungeon but he didn’t know what “floo” meant. He refrained from asking.
In the letter he’s says you’re immature and he’s right. Being in a relationship means communication and respect of one another. If you’re going to him saying “I’m the boss here and you’ll do what I say” then he’s obviously going to leave you. You should have just compromised with him and maybe now you two would still be together” the read-head pointed out.
Where was his boyfriend? Why hadn’t he come to find him?
He knew their relationship had been doomed to end sometime because of the distance but he had least expected a mutual break up that ended in a friendly manner.
The Easter holidays seemed to fly by as Harry and Draco caught up and had fun together.
Currently he was in the library reading an old book on ancient languages.
Draco told Harry about all his studying and his visits to Healer Kum while Harry told Draco about Hogwarts and his friends.
“I’ve missed you so much” he whispered into his ear while placing a kiss onto the pale skin of his neck.
————————————————————————————
“In these few months you’ve been giving me a gradually increasing amount of presents and praises, which I appreciate mind you, but why? Did you do something wrong towards me?”
“Uhhh- I uhh” Sev tried to say but the words got caught up in his throat by the embarrassment. Draco now understood why Sev had never had any children: if this was how he treated the matter of sex he knew Sev would probably be more embarrassed than his children when having The Talk.
“There’s-There’s just something I have to do first” Sev said as he got up from his chair behind his desk and walked up to stand tall in front of Draco.
As they finished their breakfast Harry immediately dragged Draco upstairs. There still was no sign of either Lily or James.
“Then it’s settled! Sorry, but I really have to go back to Ravenclaw Tower now: Michael, Anthony and Terry are waiting for me for a Charms study group!” Draco said as he rushed back to his Dorm.
Suddenly pain flooded through him as she ran her hand through his hair and touched the spot where he had been hit when he was taken. He shuddered and pulled away from the kiss to gasp.
He felt ice cold in his bones.
“I’ll help you figure out whether you’re straight, gay or bi” he said.
He turned around: it was Cedric.
Elizabeth didn’t seem to notice this.
“You know, you could have come down. We were discussing going on a trip to Diagon Alley together to get the things you need!” she said as she ruffled his hair.
‘Oh god’ he thought as he suddenly felt like he had to retch violently.
He frowned slightly as a thought come to mind.
“Excuse him, he’s only a few months old and-”
“How did you find me?” he asked with a sniff as the other boy knelt beside him and took Snoodle in his lap.
“And you’ve been in here, alone, sitting on the floor and playing with a ball?” she asked him and he nodded.
“What?”
“Can I?” Harry asked.
He took out his wand and cast the counter-curse for the Jelly-Legs Jinx.
“Prepare yourself because once we go in there you’re going to be the center of the attention” Cedric said as he pointed to the Great Hall’s double doors.
“Hit a nerve have I? Oops” Kate said.
Was he ready?
James chuckled.
She blushed red and looked at him, her mouth open but no words coming out.
“Do you want to go ice skating?” he asked him.
“Snape favors his own house rather than others’ and this is the first time he punishes his own for the sake of a student who isn’t a Snake. Do you think it means something?” Lavender explained.
When that didn’t work he took out his wand.
“Mate!” one of the brunette boys said (shouted*) and went to hug Harry.
He wished his feelings had never existed. He wished that the pain he was feeling would go away.
Harry and Draco were sitting on a picnic blanket by the Black Lake, enjoying the fresh air. As Harry polished his broom, Draco couldn’t help but look at his friend in a different way for the first time.
He had no idea who this ‘Elizabeth Swart’ was; hopefully she was pleasant to work with.
He had noticed the way Harry tensed up when she was brought up in conversations so he tried not to mention her as much as he could.
“You’re going to be the best Head Boy ever!” Harry said as he hugged Draco.
As Draco closed the door behind him, Harry sighed, walked down to the living room and flung himself on the sofa.
“You really think so?”
It just so happened that one evening as he was walking to his study session with Cedric he overheard his name being said in what seemed to be a private conversation.
Draco made to move away but instead he let out a cry of pain as he cradled his arms around his stomach and abdomen.
Draco didn’t know. And he hated not knowing.
“I have got to do something!” Harry said as he paced around the room.
Once they were outside the office Lily took a moment to hug her son.
“No son of mine will be gay!” he said in anger, raising his voice slightly.
Draco found himself drawn to all the ingredients, wanting to know their properties and purposes. He knew Potions would be a subject he would enjoy.
“Draco, we’re only in Sixth Year!” Harry exclaimed.
His. Draco. Asking. Him. About. A. Hot. Boy.
“Oh I don’t think so. You see I’ll just claim you kissed me and I didn’t want it” she smirked victoriously at him and walked away.
“This is me” Astoria pointed to the building where her apartment was.
Lily expressed how proud she was of the both of them as she hugged them while James only patted them on the back.
“Okay, so first of all I think we should go to the Jewelry Shop to get the ring’s fitting charm renewed. Then we probably should head to Twilfitt and Tattings instead of Madam Malkin’s” Lily said as she took Draco by the hand. She didn’t want him to get lost in the big crowds.
And that’s when he saw IT.
He cast a quick ‘Tempus’ which revealed it was nearly nine o’clock so he began preparing Snoodle’s breakfast which consisted in grass hay, rabbit pellets and some cut vegetables.
“Yeah?” he mumbled.
“Don’t be ridiculous! Draco would never fall for her...” he said and it sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than Ron.
She handed it to him and left before he could ask what it was.
‘Its rude for people to refer to her as ‘Fat Lady’, as if being fat was her biggest achievement in her entire life’ he thought to himself.
“I left a note with his meal and grooming preferences. Don’t give him too many dried apple slices as-”
“Really? You would do that for me?”
Draco enjoyed this moment with his godfather before heading to Charms and being ambushed in the corridor by Cedric, who was frantically saying how he was so happy Draco had put Nott in his place and how proud he was as well.
“I’m so proud of him, he’s been doing magic only for a month and is already able to heal a rabbit” James said “I think he should keep it, after all, he didn’t find a pet in Diagon Alley and seems to like this one” he then added when Draco started petting the bunny.
Snape was still crouched next to his godson.
Outside the Hospital Wing they found a bit of a commotion: Harry was having a full on panic attack while James and Lily Potter shouted at Barty Crouch about putting their son in grave danger. Ron and Hermione were trying to calm down their friend while their other friends watched in silence and waited for news about Draco. Cedric, who had now dried himself and gotten dressed was waiting with the others, looking worried. There was also Kate there with them. She was standing close to the door and looked worried out of her mind. A few tears wet her fair cheeks.
“That’s awesome! What’s your favorite subject? I’m betting either Transfiguration or Charms. I love DADA but I’m better at Charms. Don’t you-”
A clock ticking.
Instantly some sort of electric energy coming from the wand itself formed and forced the girl to retract her hand with a cry.
“Just because he’s not interested in you, Lavender, doesn’t mean he’s gay” Hermione said.
Cedric turned to where he was sitting in the stands and grinned at him.
He stood up and started pacing.
She nodded.
How was he supposed to apologize if he couldn’t even see him!? Unfortunately he also didn’t know where Draco was staying at the moment so going to the blond was not an option for Harry.
As the weeks passed Harry noticed Elizabeth had stopped openly flirting with Draco and had chosen a more discrete technique.
I know you said you didn’t want any contact with me, but I just had to tell you all of this.
“I’ll miss you”
“How dare she! Oh how I would like to strangle that vile woman!” Harry was ranting in frustration. Skeeter’s implications about Draco hadn’t gone down well at all with him and he had been raving for twenty minutes about what he would like to do or say to her.
It was true. He had felt like this for a while and wanted to have a little time just to himself. To organize his thoughts. A lot had happened in the last few years and even more was going to happen once he left school. As a boy who had had limited contact with the world, he was struggling with the last of the demons in his closet. He just needed some time to deal with the fact that his life was going to drastically change. Again.
“Everything alright?” Draco asked, picking up on Harry’s mood.
“You can’t... this last step I need to do alone” when Harry looked like he wanted to protest he added “Please”
“Scent? Heat signature?” Mr. Diggory asked bewildered.
I truly didn’t deserve your affection...
“Language...”  he heard him say. He smiled at him.
He didn’t know what to do so he just stayed in his room and played with his ball on the floor: he threw it low in the air and caught it in his other hand.
As he made it to the ‘Grey Room’ as Harry jokingly referred to his friend’s bedroom, he laid Draco down on the bed.
Cedric sighed and nodded.
As he gave his last burst of magic he felt his wand vibrate in worry in his hand as he panted.
Staying inside was driving him crazy.
“If it makes you feel better, Harry, I don’t think Draco is interested in girls” Lavender said and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
“Someone get him a blanket for Merlin’s sake!” Professor Snape barked. Two ministry officials rushed in and handed the man a warm and fluffy towel, which he immediately wrapped around his godson’s shoulders.
“Okay” he said as he turned and said goodbye to his friends.
“Draco who do you-”
“Or, instead of violence, you could use jealousy. Potter was always jealous of you soooo...” Blaise smirked as he gestured to Draco.
‘That’s odd’ he thought as he tried numerous unlocking spells.
Their free period came too soon in Harry’s opinion.
Next he hesitantly tried breathing and found the sensation of water filling his lungs wasn’t uncomfortable at all.
“What?”
“Is it really that bad?” Astoria asked him.
This was it. He would be meeting Harry.
They then paid for their stuff and left the building.
“Drugs? No... they’re vitamins that help supplement what I don’t get...” he muttered.
“It’s just... you’re a good and kind person, Draco. You’ve been through so much in your life... I only want for you to be happy...” Harry said.
“Uh... Draco... are you doing something tomorrow?” he nervously asked the blond.
A powdered scale of turtle shell was the last ingredient he added before turning the fire up a bit and letting the potion ‘cook’ for one hour.
“I just don’t understand. Why? Has he already gotten over me? Did I really just waste all of my time?” Draco asked as he searched his two best friends’ eyes for answers they couldn’t possibly have.
“Has anyone seen Draco?” Harry asked his friends as they sat in the stands. The Second Task was about to start and there still wasn’t any sign of his crush.
Hesitantly at first someone (most likely Harry...) began clapping and soon most students were cheering at what Draco had said. Nott, Crabbe and Goyle fled the room when they noticed people were still giving them dirty looks...
“Hey! How are you feeling? Have you taken your medication?” he asked him as he put down some papers.
Lily immediately understood: he hadn’t been fed enough food to know what he liked and what he didn’t like. So she let the matter drop.
Harry looked up. He felt a tug at his heart when the Ravenclaw said Draco liked him.
As the two made their way onto the dance floor and generally caught up, they were unaware of all the attention they were drawing to themselves.
He smiled. He could stay like this forever.
A few minutes later they entered the tub with the egg.
He glared at her.
He found Harry in the kitchen.
“Of course Draco likes you, honey” she soothed. The two boys had really taken to each other and both the adults were sure the boys liked each other and enjoyed hanging out together.
“And who’s this little fella?” Lavender asked as she pointed to his shoulder.
Meet me in my office.
He was heartbroken.
“Did you make these yourself?”
“I don’t know, Mate. I wouldn’t be so sure if I were you. Draco loves his job” the read-head said as he took a sip of beer.
“HE’S NOT LIKE OTHER KIDS HIS AGE! HIS HEALTH IS MORE FRAGILE: HE IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH A SERIOUS EATING DISORDER AND FRAGILE HEALTH CONDITIONS AND YOU THINK IT’S A GOOD IDEA TO PLACE HIM IN A FRIGID LAKE FOR AN ENTIRE NIGHT AND PART OF A MORNING?!” Lily shouted at Crouch who tried to defend himself.
Had he meant so little to Harry? Was a week really all that it took for him to be forgotten?
“This will go nicely as well in your room, Draco” Lily said as she showed him a tall white lamp which he could place in the corner behind his chair to have some light while he read it if was nighttime. Draco nodded in agreement.
“Do you find that guy... cute?” he repeated as he nodded to a brown haired Slytherin boy who was sitting at a table near theirs.
Kate suddenly started giggling and Draco soon followed her with his own laugh.
Draco nodded absentmindedly.
The bunny’s fur was soft and smooth.
“It was a bit hard to miss, it being on the front page and all...” she chuckled.
Harry sighed and bowed his head in defeat.
“And what if he says no? What if he doesn’t see me that way? What if he sees me more like a brother?” Harry said.
He swam toward the stands in the lake and hoisted Draco out first onto the wooden dock before letting himself be helped out too. He knelt beside Draco, who was laying supine on the wood, unconscious and pale.
After that Harry was sure that at least Draco could feel something for him and that meant he could have a chance with the blond.
He needed to get out and be with people.
As they were walking to a shop James had called “Potage’s Cauldron Shop” he noticed with the corner of his left eye a few well dressed middle aged women were staring at him and consequently making him feel uncomfortable. Was it because of his complexion? He knew white blond wasn’t a common hair color but that didn’t mean people could openly (and rudely) stare at him...
“Mhh, absolutely” he said while giving her a peck on the lips.
He had moved a bit too fast.
“Now you feel fine but if you keep on eating like this you won’t be” she gently said.
Kate’
“Honestly, Draco, that’s up to you. He’s your ex and unfortunately we can’t make the decision for you. What we can do is help you decide whether it’s actually a good or bad idea to accept Potter’s friendship” Blaise said as he sipped his tea.
‘Here goes nothing...’ he thought.
“No, I haven’t” she said and turned to smile at Harry.
Snoodle, who was sleeping as well, was cuddled against his neck and pillow; the pair looked adorable together. Harry kinda envied Draco for having such a cute pet.
But why did our beloved champion choose to ‘befriend’ Draco Malfoy, only heir to the Malfoy and Black fortunes and first Malfoy ever not sorted into Slytherin?
Well, this blond isn’t so easily discouraged as he’s so effectively proven!
“Cedric. Listen to me. Everything will be just fine. We’ve been preparing for months and I’m absolutely positive you can win this” Draco gently said.
“You know, your inferiority complex is fully justified by your behavior. You’d get a ‘P’ for the way you try not to be a scared little boy” Kate roasted and Draco had to cover his mouth to cover his smile.
“Hermione. Uhm... what are you doing here?”
“Here you are, dear!” the lady said as she smiled brightly at him.
Ron nodded.
The rabbit was looking at him with wide blue eyes and wriggling his nose.
Harry got closer to him and placed a soft hand under Draco’s chin and lifted it until grey met green.
“CEDRIC DIGGORY AND DRACO MALFOY IN A SECRET ROMANCE?
“Yes, thank you” she whispered as he let go of her hand. He smiled.
“Yes, we have. We tried when he first came home with us by slowly introducing bigger amounts of food into Draco’s diet and by changing it often, making sure he ate a lot of different kinds of food. It seemed to work for sometime but once he went to his boarding school he settled back into his old habits” Lily answered. Draco looked at the floor in shame. Dr. Dirwin offered a sad but understanding smile when she noticed this.
James smiled and grabbed Lily’s hand with his.
“Was that the only toy you had growing up?” Lily asked him.
“I feel fine” he countered.
Unfortunately his hair had been particularly untamable this morning. He somewhat tried to get it to resemble a neat style like Draco’s but to no avail. It simply wouldn’t stay in place.
He frowned slightly as he opened it and began reading the letter inside.
Draco started bringing his fork to his mouth but stopped.
“4 days, dear” she said as she retracted her hand. He relaxed a bit.
Draco smiled as he read the letter.
Getting worried about his friend’s health he glanced down and saw the blond was tied by his ankle to the floor. He took out his wand and cut the kelp, freeing Draco.
After they visited the jewelry shop where a man (probably the owner) charmed Draco’s signet ring to fit him perfectly and to expand as he grew, it was time to acquire some clothes. As they entered Twilfitt and Tattings immediately a shop assistant asked if she could help them and overall she was very polite and didn’t ask any questions, which was perfect. One hour later Lily had him buy clothes he liked and fit him well: several sets of robes, comfy pajamas and normal clothes.
“Then why didn’t you tell me? All of this could have been avoided” he said.
“But won’t you be cold?” she asked him.
“Let’s just say I wasn’t opposed to the idea” she answered as her hands undid his belt and trousers.
“I’ve had a really great time tonight. Paris was beautiful, just as you said.” she smiled at him.
“You wouldn’t truly be happy with the Lions. You aren’t as rash and hotheaded as them and you would stop and think about everything before you do it while they would immediately charge ahead. In my opinion you belong either with the Snakes or the Ravens”
As Ron handed him a sobering potion and his glasses, he hastily put on some clothes before going back in the living room.
Because I do love you, Draco, I do.
Instead of spending your time thinking about how to humiliate me or others, try focusing on what really matters: try spending some time with your actual friends or maybe try picking up a hobby. Anything goes. Just do something that you enjoy and actually makes you happy, because I’m sure you’re not as mean as you think you are.
“Now, to start with your recovery plan: as we are trying to avoid any kind of relapse, I suggest we start small and build up from there. Try eating a little less food at dinner and having small but frequent meals during the day. These meals don’t have to necessarily be dishes, even a few blueberries will suffice because they’re better than nothing at all. Draco, even if your stomach feels sealed try swallowing a few blueberries anyway. It’s important that you do so to stimulate your hunger” the therapist explained and Draco nodded.
“What does he mean?” he asked.
He stayed by his side for the rest of the day: healers came in to check on him, make sure he was alright, give him his pain potions and generally keep him a bit of company for a few minutes.
They finally arrived at the shop where Lily selected for Draco a Copper Cauldron: perfect for brewing all types of potions at a fast speed.
“Uhm... okay?” he said quietly and looked at his feet.
Harry stared at him and furrowed his brows.
As he finished reading out loud the final draft of his letter, he sent it off with an owl.
Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore were talking to the distressed man who thought his son was dead, trying to calm him down. Students were crying and shouting.
He took her hand in his as the two fell asleep in each other’s arms.
I’m writing you this letter to apologize for everything I said to you.
After all, this “relationship” had only just begun.
As Draco explained what he had done and seen during his vacation and who he had visited as his final destination, he felt the curious stares of his family.
Harry frowned some more.
Draco yawned.
————————————————————————————
“Who doesn’t like you?” she asked as she patted her son’s back.
‘What do I name you?’ he thought. His first thought had been something like ‘Shadow’ or ‘Nero’ because of its completely black fur however as he watched it he decided those weren’t names that suited him.
A minute passed in comfortable silence.
Draco looked at him blankly and Harry mentally slapped himself.
“I’d like to work as an Auror, just like Dad” he said. Draco smiled. “How about you?”
“Mhh...” Draco muttered as he breathed loudly and snuggled more into Harry.
“Yes, but I’m not Kate, Draco” he said trying to keep the annoyance from his voice.
“Don’t worry, Sev. We’ll only cuddle and kiss a bit before falling asleep together on my bed” Draco openly smirked this time when he saw his godfather’s lips tremble slightly.
“I love it” he said as he admired his room “Thank you” he then added while turning to face Lily. She smiled.
A short but pregnant silence followed.
“Where are you going?” he was standing at the top of the stairs that led to his room.
Harry sighed.
“Uhm, I’m not sure...” he answered quietly.
He knew if his father ever found out he was reading Muggle books he would probably find a way to break out of prison to come and murder him... Shaking his head he cast those kind of thoughts aside: his father couldn’t hurt him anymore. So he bought it.
“Goodnight” Draco said in a low voice once it was time for them to separate.
‘You’ve broken up. You don’t owe him anything anymore’ he convinced himself as he fell into a drunken blackness.
“Head Dorms!?” he asked out loud “You didn’t say anything about Head Dorms!”
As they went underwater they heard some beautiful and melodic voices singing.
Everything went black.
“Miss Aguillon, I need to speak with my student. If you could please leave us alone for a few minutes: I’ll return him to you shortly” someone said from behind them as they walked to Ravenclaw Tower.
When the two bottles flew in his hands, he set them on the picnic blanket.
As he smelled Harry’s scent again, Draco couldn’t help but bask in the warmth and comfort that came with being wrapped in the Gryffindor’s strong arms.
“What worries me is his ‘gift’ in Healing Magic, as Ollivander called it” James said.
“She could speak english but that’s not the point. Go get him, Harry, before it’s too late!” Lavender said and Harry nodded determinedly.
Speaking of friends, Harry had been a source of constant affection towards him and Draco couldn’t be more grateful.
“Of course I’m alright! Why wouldn’t I be? The love of my life hates me and is with somebody else and I’m here alone because I messed up so badly! Of course I’m not bloody fine, Hermione!” he said.
Please do not be late.
“Oh please, Draco, you were the reason why I wasn’t maimed or burnt alive by that dragon today. Take a little credit for it!” Cedric said.
Draco stood there nervously in silence.
He paled as he read the title on the front page.
“Yes, Sir, we have: I modified a Disillusionment charm so it would make Cedric look like the things that are around him. For example, if he were to stand in front of a tree, he would look like its trunk and be textured and colored exactly like the bark. This way his only way of being noticed is if he makes too much noise, something picks up his scent or if his heat signature is detected. You mustn’t worry, however, we made a special potion to cover his scent so he only has to be careful about the other two things” Draco explained.
“I can’t forgive you right away” Draco said eventually after a minute or so of staring at each other in silence. He had decided that by the look in Harry’s eyes he was sincere. “We can’t pretend everything’s going to be fine immediately, because it won’t. We’re still going to disagree eventually...”
Draco’s smile turned brighter despite of what he said next.
Draco slowly headed to his Gryffindor friends and smiled back at Harry when the raven haired boy grinned brightly at him, a thing which he had started doing a lot around the Ravenclaw lately.
He also felt a weight compressing his chest and lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
He turned off the flame and let the potion cool down for fifteen minutes. By now it’s color had turned to a very dark blue and it smelled like roses.
“These are the most beautiful girls I’ve ever seen...” Dean muttered as he watched their guests with wide eye.
We are all proud of Mr. Malfoy’s achievement, especially following a hard break up with Harry Potter.
You would be a lot happier if you stopped being angry and mean all the time and simply accepted yourself for the way you are.
Hermione raised her eyebrows and smiled.
“I just asked Kate to the Yule Ball and she said yes!” Draco said happily and Harry actually felt his heart shatter in his chest.
Either way he definitely liked to read.
Sighing Draco got up and stopped his friend’s pacing by standing in front of him. He placed his hands on the taller boy’s shoulders and got him to look in his eyes.
“Yeah. Sorry, I have to go: Professor Snape wants to see me” Draco said as he put away the letter.
He lowered the flame under the cauldron.
James also had suggested he bought some pillows so Draco had gotten some comfy and soft looking ones to place on his bed and chair.
“Excuse me!” a voice called. It was their neighbor who was calling him from the other side of the fence.
The group nodded or generally said ‘okay’.
Now that Harry had managed to finally get Draco to listen to him, every single thing he had wanted to say to the blond seemed to vanish from his mind as he lost himself into those grey eyes.
Silence fell over the room again.
“What will happen to him?” she asked.
‘Kate...’ he though as he held his breath and opened the letter.
So that’s how Draco found himself sitting in front of a therapist the very next week.
“Thank you, Draco. You’re the best friend anyone could ever have” Cedric said and Draco blushed.
“No, Minerva. If Draco had been in Gryffindor he would have been influenced by Harry and his friends: being alone in a different house left him open to new friendships, such as Mr. Diggory, and to forming his own opinions. If Draco had been a Gryffindor, Harry would have been the one defending him today and Mr. Nott would have never been taught a valuable lesson. Draco unlocked his true potential in Ravenclaw; besides, the boy absolutely loves reading!” Dumbledore said.
“It’s fine...” Draco said quietly. He didn’t want to be the cause of any arguments.
“So, can I ask what you took from the Manor?”
As Astoria’s hand began stroking him, Draco barely contained a moan, his own fingers wondering down her body and quickly finding what he had been looking for. As he heard her gasp beneath him, he smiled.
He waited for what seemed like hours before trying to open his eyes; this time he managed to only open them a crack but it was enough to tell him he was in the Hospital Wing.
For the second time in an hour, Harry envied a rabbit, for it could have what Harry so desperately wanted but couldn’t.
“At least now he’ll have a lot more room to hop around once we’re in the Head Dorms...” Draco said.
I’ll go grab my broom! Can you manage to get outside by yourself?”
“Draco?”
Cedric and Kate leaned in close as well to check if their friend was alright.
————————————————————————
“Well, actually, you can fly while I watch you...?” Draco was blushing slightly.
Draco closed his eyes and didn’t answer.
“Then it’s decided” the Hat said and then shouted:
As he arrived he found both of them having breakfast.
“It’s going to be just fine, Ron. It’s what we do: we fight and then make up. We always find a way to make it work” Harry explained to his friend.
————————————————————————————
He jumped in shock when he received one.
They put on their robes as the train arrived in Hogsmeade.
He took his fighting stance and before attacking he remembered what Draco had said while they were training: “Remember: before you attack study your adversary, look for his weaknesses; don’t jump in a duel head first but analyze him and find out what his deal is”
As they entered the shop the man greeted them in a friendly way.
“It’s about Draco. He’s not talking, not eating, not even studying! He literally cried himself to sleep last night and we’re worried about him”
“A ball? What for?”
It was only by the end of the school year that he actually talked to his godfather.
The meal continued happily as the four boys chatted and got to know each other.
“Why ‘monsters’, Severus?” Headmaster Dumbledore asked.
The house was quiet.
Draco didn’t seem to be that much interested however as he obediently followed James without complain wherever he went and listened to what he had to say without interrupting or making contributions of his own to the monologue her husband was reciting.
As he walked in he watched with wide eyes the tall piles of gold, the jewels, the towers of ancient books and manuscripts and couldn’t help but wonder who all this wealth belonged to.
“What happened?” Cedric asked and Draco explained everything to him.
Harry suspected she somehow knew Draco’s timetable and knew his habits.
That night as he laid on his bed, even Snoodle seemed happier than usual as the little fella hopped around on his bed and cuddled with him. Draco chuckled and gave his beloved pet a kiss before closing his eyes and going to sleep.
Evidently it had started snowing sometime during the night and lots of snow had fallen.
Draco couldn’t believe it. Wouldn’t believe it.
“Do I have to explain to you the ways of procreation?” Sev grimaced.
“Very remarkable... such a lovely boy, unlike every other Malfoy before him: I wish he had been a Gryffindor. Is it possible that the Sorting Hat was wrong when it said Draco would have been unhappy there?” Professor McGonagall asked and smiled as well.
“I spoke with your parents who asked me to tell you that they’re proud you’ve been helping Cedric and to pay no mind to rumors. Now go, or you’ll miss dinner!” Sev said as Draco thanked him and went down to the Great Hall.
James then went downstairs again and organized all of Draco’s sweets in a basket which he left on the kitchen counter.
“Oh sorry” Harry gave him a sheepish look.
Draco lied and said ‘nothing’ most of the time because he didn’t want Harry to get into trouble for cursing Nott, like Draco knew he would do.
When it finished its dose Draco picked it up again and started stroking its fur slowly and scratching behind his ears.
“What did you have in mind?” Draco asked as he collected all of his stuff and got up.
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“Alright. I promise I won’t tell anyone what we talk about today” she said.
“Goodnight. And thank you: I had such a wonderful time” Kate smiled as she kissed his cheek and turned to walk away. Draco stayed where he was.
“Oh, I just had to deliver this ministry letter to Astoria because my assistant unfortunately called in sick today” she said. “What are you doing here?” she added.
“Harry, Draco can like whatever subjects despite their teachers” James said.
‘Oh no, please have mercy on me’ Draco thought. Dancing with Pansy was always a health hazard as she stepped on your toes and sometimes kneed you in... delicate places.
Draco remained unmoving.
Draco nodded and bit the piece off of his fork. He trusted Lily’s cooking more than Harry’s.
Hermione was glad she had cast a quick ‘Muffiliato’ when they entered.
Sev sighed.
“What’s happening?” Severus asked in an alarmed voice. Dumbledore had never seen him this much worried over a student.
I, for one, would be really interested in finding out.
“Uhm... I think so?” he said. He hadn’t been the one who chose it so he didn’t know. Anyway, he didn’t see how it really mattered.
He leaned down and gently kissed his boyfriend, not caring about the dust and tears and blood. He kissed him one last time, wanting to remember the feeling of his beloved’s lips against his.
“Uhm, actually we just finished. I was heading back to Ravenclaw Tower. Elizabeth and I have been working tirelessly to plan that ball. I’m so tired I think I may faint!” Draco said slightly dramatically, trying to lighten up the mood.
“This isn’t over” Nott said as he stomped away, followed by his two bodyguards.
“You’d make an excellent Gryffindor! I can already visualize it: you in a black, red and gold uniform! Oh it’s going to be so fun in Gryffindor Tower! You’ll meet all of my friends and we can go prank Slytherins!” Harry gushed. Draco gulped and said nothing.
First he added to water some chopped Bat Wings, Dandelion Roots and Cat Hair and stirred three times counterclockwise.
Lately there has been speculation on whether Mr. Malfoy, after his recent break up, was in a relationship and finally it seems like we’ve got some answers!
”What caused this outbreak?” James asked the man.
The two remaining months of school also passed quickly for Draco, who was getting rather excited to go to Hogwarts. He couldn’t wait until September.
He appreciated it but couldn’t help but ask what was the occasion.
A cough interrupted them.
He had a Potions’ Test that morning and he was absolutely sure he was going to get a perfect grade.
He watched the two’s retreating backs when suddenly the girl turned around and smirked at him before walking up to Draco and entwining their arms together.  Harry nearly shattered the glass that was in his hand.
Suddenly Mr. Ollivander narrowed his eyes while looking at him and craned his head to the side.
He told his friends about what happened.
“Good. It’s good that you’re aware of your condition: most people who come here aren’t willing to admit they need help. Judging by what you’ve told me so far I’d say you have an eating disorder that is based on habits. Have you ever tried changing them before?” the woman directed the last question to Lily.
He felt jealousy flare up in him as he watched the way Draco’s arm wrapped around her, his hand placed on the small of her waist.
He gasped in horror.
“Oh yes dear boy, you could be quite manipulative if you really wished to and haven’t even realized yet. If you wish to dabble in this subtle art, do not worry: even manipulation can be used to achieve good, as long as the heart his pure” the Hat said.
“No worries... I...uhm... I like Potions and Astronomy” he said quietly.
He pushed the door open and saw his godfather was sitting at his desk, grading papers.
“I promise I’ll be careful. And besides, you’ll help me!” Cedric said.
To make it taste a bit better he added a few drops of Honey Water.
You are incredible, Draco.
“About time” Ron said as he returned to his chicken leg.
If you do, know this: a life lived to please others isn’t a life worth living.
He locked away such thoughts. He didn’t need this from his own mind, especially right now. His parents were in Azkaban.
“Wait. Does that mean you’re... gay?” he asked.
“Was she good? Was she little Miss innocent and perfect? Was she batting her eyelashes at you?” he growled out jealously. Draco frowned this time.
Tears started to fall, and soon streams became rivers and rivers became waterfalls.
About fifteen minutes later he heard voices in the house and took a deep breath.
As he checked out all the rooms, he even discovered a wine cellar full of rich and expensive wines. As he tried to open the last door, he found it locked and when he tried the unlocking charm it didn’t work.
Anyway, it didn’t matter.
“NO!” he cried out louder.
Fortunately he was going in the opposite direction than him. He immediately started searching for his object
“He’ll be alright. Madam Pomfrey will heal him just fine and he’ll be with us in no time”
“And if he doesn’t?” Harry asked, dreading receiving an answer.
“Kate...” he whispered. The brunette didn’t stir.
“I’m Michael, pleased to meet you!”
Very helpful...
Draco interrupted his friend; he knew where this conversation was going to end if he didn’t intervene. He could, though, understand why Cedric was so nervous: he was in first place by just a few points and Viktor Krum still could very likely win this competition.
Harry wanted to scream in anger.
She grinned at him.
‘What the hell just happened?’ he asked himself as he got out of bed and went downstairs.
“Why do I get the feeling that’s not everything she wrote?” he grimaced.
His biological father had changed a lot since the last time he saw him, although he had to concede that he had changed as well.
“How are they, Poppy?” Professor McGonagall asked worriedly as she stood there on the side next to Professor Dumbledore.
He smiled.
Kate stayed silent.
“I take it you read that article?” Draco winched.
“Pansy! Give the man some space to breathe!” Blaise said as he entered the flat.
Cedric was panicking: Draco was nowhere to be found and he still had no way to breathe under water for an hour. He was pacing along the dock.
“That-was-perfect” she said between breaths as he flipped them over and pulled out of her.
“Can’t I just eat a meal a day? It’s much less fussy than having to force myself not to throw up every time I eat something other than dinner” Draco pleaded and a little piece of Lily’s heart shattered at the thought of a young boy not wanting to eat because it’s become too much effort.
“Ah, that happens when your family company earns money. Currently it is being run by your father’s employees. Don’t worry: when you’re old enough you can decide to take control of it or not. It pretty much runs itself, so it’s your choice” Lily said.
“But the Black Lake will be freezing at this time of year! Also, how will I be able to breathe under water for an hour?” Cedric asked and Draco sighed.
“Let’s go home, honey. I’m afraid we stressed our son enough. He should have been home resting, and instead we took him shopping...” Lily said as they quickly headed to the public floo service and flooed home.
“I’ve got it! Thanks mum!l he said as he raced upstairs leaving a smiling Lily behind him.
As Harry and his friends started to talk Draco went back to his book as Snoodle snoozed on his shoulder.
So, instead, Draco opted for a safer conversation instead.
“I’ll go there?” Draco asked. If he’d not misunderstood Lily’s words, he would be going there.
Hagrid left him in front of the main gates where another woman was waiting for him.
As they were walking their hands brushed against each other. Electric waves sent off from their fingers as they quickly pulled their hands away.
“Of course I do. Many people have eating disorders but not many of them are brave enough to do something about them. I’m assuming you told your parents about your ‘problem’?” she asked.
“Change Quidditch?!” James said in a panic. If there was one thing he loved more than sweets it was Quidditch and the idea only of changing his beloved sport flabbergasted him.
“Hi! I’m Elizabeth but you can call me ‘Liz’ or ‘Lizzie’!” she said cheerily as she introduced herself. Her eyes shined brightly.
Also, where was Harry? And Snoodle?
He smiled at the warm feeling he felt in his chest and was about to say something but Lavender beat him to it.
He felt her eyelashes moving against the soft skin of his neck as she blinked.
As the girls all sat down after Dumbledore’s speech Harry noticed something he didn’t like at all.
“Ehmm not really no...”
Now the blond wasn’t coming to class or meals and Harry had no way of talking to him.
He figured this crush would go away in time.
It was then only then he realized... he had a full-on crush on his friend...
On the right hand’s fourth finger he wore the Malfoy signet ring while his left was left plain.
“He can’t die. He can’t die. Not like this. Not before I’ve told him... Not-Not now” Harry said as he sobbed. He had the image of a deadly pale Draco laying unconscious on the stand’s floor and couldn’t shake it out from his head.
After what felt like hours he finally opened his eyes again and looked at a now sleeping Draco.
Cedric laughed and pushed open one of the doors.
“Yeah... but I’m not sure yet...for now I’ll just stick to my family business” Draco said quietly.
“Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Potter. Always a pleasure! How may I help you today?” he asked.
Harry got up quickly and left the Great Hall, Ron and Hermione following him quickly.
“Dray? What’s taking you so lon- oh Merlin!” she said in surprise and covered her otherwise naked body with Draco’s white shirt.
“Right...” he muttered, still not convinced. He knew, however, that it was too late now.
It looked like it was a dungeon of some sort.
Diggory was heard thanking the young Malfoy for helping him with the first task and stated he was “the reason why I wasn’t maimed or burnt alive by that dragon”.
He took another deep breath to try and clear his head, but to no avail. His left hand shook slightly.
He knew he had to confess his feelings but every time he tried to the words just wouldn’t come out. So, instead, he opted for making sure Draco wasn’t ‘distracted’ by anyone, especially Slytherin whores.
“At this time of night? Please, I wouldn’t risk anything happening to you, I’d feel too guilty.
“Go on, try it” Mr. Ollivander said and Draco took the wand with his left hand, swished it and immediately on the counter a glass vase filled with dying flowers broke. Draco jumped in surprise while Mr. Ollivander simply repaired it and started muttering again.
“Cedric! Here, this is for you” Cedric turned around and saw a young girl with a bottle.
“Mr. Malfoy
He cursed Cedric Diggory for always putting his Draco in such danger.
Throughout the whole conversation Mr. Diggory was fairly hands-on with Mr. Malfoy, who didn’t seem to mind the contact at all, so we’re left wondering: are these two together?
“Yes, it’s with me right now. If you want I could keep it company” he said. He didn’t mind.
“So, what house do you think you’ll be in, Draco?” Sean/Seamus (?) asked him.
“My friends should be joining us in a few minutes” Harry said.
As the doorbell rang, he practically ran to answer the door.
“He’s my godfather” he repeated.
“What’s Hogwarts?”
“Mhhh... interesting...” the Hat said.
Gifts could be interpreted as a sign of guilt and the more expensive the gift the more guilty the person giving them felt.
Unfortunately that meant sleeping and pain potions/pills until he could manage without them.
Draco lightly rested his chin on her head and wrapped his arms around her waist.
“The mirror does not lie, Mr. Malfoy” Dumbledore said and walked away with a knowing glint in his eyes.
He froze. Did she read his thoughts?
“Funny, I was supposed to meet Draco here about...” she looked at her watch”... now” she smirked at him. She nodded her head towards a spot behind him. As he turned around he could only frown as he spotted a satchel had been abandoned on the floor, probably by the person who had gasped at seeing them kiss earlier.
So he learnt various extensive healing spells: not only for him, but for anyone else who was around him that needed help. He had decided it was better if he actually knew the charms instead of relying on his ‘gift’ and on his wand.
Since he was on painkillers basically all day and night, he felt fine and beside the occasional tug at his stitches, his whole ordeal didn’t bother him that much anymore.
He asked himself all these questions as he walked behind James and Lily, who had already left the shop and were waiting for him outside.
He would never let that happen! He would fight tooth and nail for the blond. He was definitely worth it.
“Your hand is cold...” Harry said.
“Uhm... pardon me, Sir, but have met?” he asked as politely as possible.
It appeared Cedric hadn’t told everything about him to his father.
“Oh, well, I-uhm....” he struggled to come up with an excuse that wasn’t “we had a sleepover last night”.
—————————————————————————————
“Oh Harry, we can’t choose who we love” James said gently as he patted his son’s back.
As his friend started asking him questions that he would never answer, an intrusive thought crossed his mind.
“Duly noted, boyfriend...” Kate whispered as she sighed and got even closer to him. She threw a leg over both of his and rested her head directly in the crook of his neck. She was breathing softly on his neck and Draco, who was slightly ticklish there, couldn’t help but laugh a bit.
So, with this string of logic in mind, he found himself talking about Sev to Cedric one evening during their study session.
Soon it was Easter and he was feeling rather excited for two main reasons: he would be seeing Harry again and he had finished the Second Year’s Curriculum so they had time to do things together.
“Mate, you can’t just- he won’t agree with you just because you demand it. Imagine if your positions were reversed-” Ron was interrupted mid-sentence.
“Oh so that justifies everything, doesn’t it! If maybe you didn’t think with your prick, you’d still have a chance with Draco! He won’t take you back after this, Harry, and if by miracle he does, then you really don’t deserve his affection” Hermione said. Ron nodded in agreement with her.
Unfortunately, any other thoughts evaporated immediately as he set foot inside his cubicle. The realization that he had been cursed here the previous evening hadn’t truly sunk in until this very moment; evidently, Harry had, as usual, been a sufficient distraction. Draco shuffled unsteadily backward, his body trembling as he stared into the tiny workspace. All he could see were hateful eyes, a raised wand, a flash of red light…
Draco hummed in pleasure as he stroked his erection faster. “Likewise.”
“Will you please just tell me what you’re thinking and have done with it?” Draco spouted, sounding very agitated even to his own ears. “If this is going to be an issue I would rather know now.”
Draco sighed and shook his head.
“Depends on my mood,” he reluctantly smiled back. “And on how much coffee I’ve consumed that day.”
“I’m under a glamor charm,” Harry admitted with a shrug.
“Things changed for me, too,” Draco said, so quietly that he was surprised Harry heard him, but he must have, because he turned to slowly face him again.
Harry didn’t quite see how the two things were related, so he waited for Malfoy to elaborate. When he didn’t, Harry slowly reached across the table and gingerly began to pull the folder towards himself. This time Draco didn’t try to stop him.
Draco shrugged. “Perhaps. Someday.”
Draco laughed again, deciding it was best not to dwell on that comment but flushing with pleasure all the same. “Oh Merlin, please leave before I’m obligated to hex you.”
“Alright, no more David,” he said. “Hey, you can call me Webster.”
Draco nodded. “Exactly. It’s weird.”
“Sitting room?” Harry murmured against his lips.
Potter looked as if no one had asked him that before. “I don’t know.”
Harry snorted into his cup; this, too, felt like irony. Draco stared at him for a second and then ruefully shook his head.
“Perhaps,” Draco said. “Although, the way you talk about him makes me think I could never keep up.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “
“I know,” Draco agreed, somewhat bitterly. “Why do you think I instantaneously hated you back then?”
He nodded, studying Harry’s face and reading honesty there.
Draco let the information sit with him for a moment. He had watched Potter enough at Hogwarts to have seen him with her. They had looked happy enough, but to Draco, it seemed as if Potter was mostly happy just to be doing something normal for once, content to have found himself in a regular relationship, with a regular girl. Draco never saw anything much deeper in it (though he acknowledged that he may have been projecting just a little), but the whole wizarding world seemed to want them to be together forever. A fairytale romance for the ages.
Harry scoffed, then he flicked his wand at the refrigerator in a choppy fashion and summoned himself a butterbeer, even though he was still nursing his cup of tea.
Draco lifted his shoulder. “I’ve always been that way.”
,” he muttered, childishly.
Harry smiled sadly at him. “I could almost say the same about you.”
“No,” Harry insisted. “You don’t deserve it.”
“Well, since we’re saying everything, don’t ever pout at me again,” Draco muttered, quite against his will. “It’s far too adorable.”
The prospect of telling his parents about Harry was daunting, and Draco was deliberating over the first course--a tasty chestnut bisque--whether he should just yank it out like a mandrake and have done with it.
“Yes, you raging prat, I do,” Harry said, once again answering Draco’s thoughts. Draco smiled at him, and Harry smiled back.
“No, just masturbate with me,” Draco said in his most sultry voice. “Take your clothes off and sit next to me and touch yourself.”
“I’ll file that away for future reference,” Draco smirked at him over his shoulder, an eyebrow lifted. “And let it be known that I don’t hate being called sir, either.”
Draco lowered his head, slightly ashamed that he’d assumed the worst of Potter. He should certainly know better by now.
“Perhaps…,” he began, his voice shaking nervously. “Perhaps I can try to tell you what draws you to me now. If you promise not to laugh at me too hard.”
Harry scoffed and picked up his wand. “Go on, you lazy git. I’ll start cleaning.”
The thought filled Harry with a fresh wave of anger: Alex had hurt his dragon. He desperately wanted to find the arsehole and make him pay, but he couldn't--and wouldn't--leave Draco. In a strange way, Harry was a little proud of himself for being able to resist his impulse to take action, difficult as it might have been. Perhaps Draco wasn’t the only one who had changed since Hogwarts.
“As I’ve told you,” Draco said loftily, “looks are unimportant to me.”
Draco gently nudged Harry backwards after too short a kiss, and Harry took the hint again, breaking away and taking a small step back. Draco’s hands left Harry’s hair and rested instead on Harry’s shoulders. Draco let himself absorb the feeling of the hard muscle under his fingers, and the way Harry was still clutching his middle like he was a life preserver. They stared at each other, still breathing heavily.
Finally Harry veered left into another room, yanking his jumper off as he entered. Draco stopped himself at the doorway and realized that this had to be Harry’s bedroom. The canopy bed, stately grandfather clock, and huge armoire looked like they belonged to anyone but him, and yet he flung his jumper over the dark blue wingback armchair in the corner as if he was very much at home here. The room was untidy, but not as dishevelled as Draco had imagined. Not that he’d ever imagined Potter’s bedroom. Obviously.
cock in
Harry grinned without comment and passed the paper and quill back to him.
“Harry,” Draco whispered. “Don’t worry. Surely you knew that Lucius Malfoy wasn’t going to be doing cartwheels when he heard that his only son and heir was in love with the Chosen One.”
“Sorry to hear,” Draco said, turning sideways on the bench to face Harry, his legs still folded up under him like a pretzel. The blanket slipped down off of Draco’s shoulder, but he didn’t care. He pulled their joined hands into his lap, giving Harry his full attention.
“Of course they are,” Harry admitted, shuddering when he imagined what Ron might be telling Hermione about his ‘minor fancy.’ “But I reckon it might be better for everyone if we let them have a quick recon before we start.”
Harry sighed. “It’s not good.”
“Not a liar, per se,” Draco said, once again tapping his quill against his mouth. “Just… in denial?”
“That many?” Harry smiled softly. He’d been mostly ribbing him, but Draco’s face told him he had taken the teasing seriously. Harry thought that was painfully sweet.
Draco now faced an entire evening alone, and he found himself pathetically wishing that he had gone with Harry after all. He fought off the sudden compulsion--but only just--to apparate directly into Harry’s sitting room and declare that he had changed his mind, and then to shower his ravishing face with a deluge of kisses.
“Anyway, it all worked out in the end, didn’t it?” Harry said with another long sigh.
Merlin’s beard… another baby!
“I’m very weird then.”
“They tell me it’s terminal.”
As Harry’s pleasant giggles echoed down the hallway, Draco sighed. He tossed down his floo powder and tried his best to ignore the fact that leaving Harry felt utterly and completely wrong.
Draco smiled and followed the sudden impulse to lean his head onto Harry’s shoulder. It felt warm, hard, reassuring under him, and it wasn’t more than a few seconds before he felt Harry’s head on top of his own.
Harry held his hands up as if to deflect the question. “Absolutely nothing, actually. You dress very nicely.”
them to. He wanted to pay recompense for every single injustice he’d ever committed, and he wanted them to accept him as wholeheartedly as Harry had. Perhaps it wasn’t impossible. (And perhaps Draco was a little naive, after all.)
Leaning over the bowl just in time, and before he could even think, he vomited violently into the toilet, mentally (and physically) groaning with humiliation.
Yes, that sounded very nice on his tongue.
“Do you miss the Manor?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Come on,” Harry said, groaning as he clutched his hair in frustration. “Why won’t you just flirt with me again, dammit?”
Draco moaned softly against Harry’s cheek and leaned into him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders.
“You like being praised, too,” he guessed, breathless desperation in his voice. “You like to be a good boy for your man.”
, Draco,” Harry stated firmly. “And I would appreciate it if you didn’t question my feelings for you again.”
“It is not a normal question for anyone on this earth but you, you overly heroic, interfering, ridiculous man!”
“Lucius!” his mother exclaimed.
“Well I like telling you.”
Draco nudged him away with a giggle. “Let me speak, Potter.”
Draco smiled at him. “No need to get all Gryffindor about it.”
“I love you, too,” Draco replied with a laugh. “Even though you are a commoner. Good luck tonight.”
“Amazing culinary skills, eh?” Harry tried to tease Ron, but it came out more than a bit breathless.
“I think I’ll stick around, actually,” Harry said.
like.”
“Has it really been three weeks already?” he asked, crossing his legs into a pretzel and dragging the blanket up to his chin and over his shoulders.
“You won’t survive this, Harry,” his mother told him sadly, linking her fingers with his father’s. “You’ll die. We can’t save you.”
“Yes, it appears you’ve once again roused my inner Slytherin,” Draco replied, and he could feel his face cracking into the smallest of smiles.
“Well, as much as I would rather pull out my own toenails than have this conversation with you, Weasley…” Draco sighed. “It was only ever going to be Harry. There’s no one else for me. There never will be.”
“I don’t mean that in an insulting way,” Draco said, placating him. “The Weasel, showing an aptitude for anything…I mean, the fact that he’s good at…No, there’s really no way for this not to sound insulting.”
“Astoria Greengrass,” Draco answered.
“Yes, well, it’s a thin line between love and hate, as they say.”
“I wash my hands of you,” he uttered.
“Oh, fuck, yeah,” Harry breathed out, finally walking over to Draco and leaning down for a kiss.
“It works fine, or you can even come earlier if you want,” Harry told him, his eyelids already drooping. “Do you want me to come see you out?”
Draco woke with a sharp gasp the next morning, having been jolted awake from a particularly chilling nightmare. He kept his eyes closed as he tried to focus on the sound of light rain tapping melodically against his window. His toes were cold. No, his entire body was cold.
“You are,” Harry said, nodding. “Absolutely.”
Draco awoke the following day with a slight headache as the bright morning sun streamed through the window from an unusual angle. When he gradually opened his eyes, he realized why it seemed different: this wasn’t his bedroom. That wasn’t his antique grandfather clock, those weren’t his sheer white drapes. That most certainly was not his crude mug on this vaguely familiar nightstand.
“If they hadn’t been alright with it…,” Draco asked him, suddenly looking very serious indeed, “if they’d said no, what would you have done?”
Draco sank down into his armchair with a groan and folded himself up, hugging his legs. Harry stood frozen a few feet away, merely staring at him, looking on the verge of tears himself.
“What the fuck,” Harry spluttered through the washing up bubbles, glaring as Draco cackled.
“But what about-”
“Pfft, no. Why should I sleep on the sofa?” Harry raised his voice to reach the kitchen. “Draco can sleep on the sofa.”
Pressed to the wall by the volume of the prophecy, Severus scrambled for his wand, cursing himself for forgetting to wear the Ministry issue earplugs. All the intact prophecies were supposed to be catalogued already, but a few smaller ones had slipped through the initial sweep. Once the prophecy finished it fell back into the box it came from.
“Um.” He turned to look at Malfoy, who was staring uneasily at the door.
“Yes,” Harry insisted.
Minerva did not “know” but Rolanda was smiling properly again.
It turned out that Snape’s idea of explaining ‘everything’ actually meant explaining nothing, badly. Hours later, squinting through the dark to see if the bedroom ceiling had any interesting cracks, Harry made a list of the things he did know.
“Bit of a nutter.” Ron decided. “Funny though, think her and Ginny would get on?”
"And now I'm here," said Blaise, smoothing his robes. "Problem?"
“Nofgeveshabish?”
“Of course we have your generosity to thank for that,” Fudge was saying. “All these rumours about You Know Who and Dumbledore’s own, ah, eccentricities. We want our graduates to have maximum confidence in the Ministry, both as a governing body and a future employer-”
“Neither would Pansy. Do you think that we Slytherins go around constantly manipulating and deceiving each other?”
“I don’t understand.” It didn’t make any sense. Draco hadn’t done anything to break the time loop. He hadn’t grown and he hadn’t changed and he definitely wasn’t a better wizard than he had been when he entered the Cereal Monogamist.
“You do? Who is it?” Harry turned back to the screen. What had he missed?
"A donation that size, for only one team as well, I don't know what Dumbledore will have to say about-"
But neither the potions kit, nor the dildos had the power to make Harry stop in his tracks. No, it was Draco Malfoy, standing right behind the row of dildos, who had Harry rooted to the spot. Harry felt annoyance rise in his chest. He had been successfully
“Yeah, think she might have got Pansy in on it too.” Potter grinned ruefully and ran a hand through his hair.
“Steady on,” Potter sat up, glaring at Draco. “Hermione didn’t lie, she-”
“We were kids,” said Harry. “School kids!” He watched in amusement as Malfoy gapped. “And we had Hermione. Play to your strengths, yeah?”
“Drink.” A plastic beaker of amber liquid slapped down in front of Draco. It had cheerios floating in it and Draco looked up at the waitress in horror, only to see her place a matching beaker in front of Potter. Draco’s phone buzzed with a text as the waitress asked “Have you decided what you want to order yet?”
“Why aren’t you at school?” Scorpius’ last letter had informed Draco that Leopold was about to start the delicate moulting season. “Please tell me that you did not trust the feeding of Leopold to Professor Hagrid. Rockbuns are hardly an appropriate diet for-
“Thank fuck,” Ginny cheerfully agreed, stepping up to the doorway and gazing down at the swamp. “Surprised there’s not more of you lot down here to be honest. If I worked here I’d be diving in face first, never to emerge.”
“I prefer to think of it as dedicated.”
“Why are you all being so weird?” Harry demanded, starting to feel the panic tickle at the base of his throat.
“Yeah.” Nervous panic began to claw at Harry. He’d been wanting to ask Draco out for ages but was now really the time?
“He Who Must Not Be Named.” Umbridge nodded, smiling up at Draco as she obliterated the last few shreds of his mental equilibrium. “Your father’s houseguest. Don’t you think he’d like to know that his enemy has developed a powerful weapon, and that you and I have discovered its whereabouts?”
“Well I haven’t exactly played a lot of this before,” said Harry, ignoring Fred’s barked laugh.
“Indeed.” The smile slipped off Draco’s face and he turned his attention back to the hanging baskets.
“But for such a trifling matter...”
“Dear, dear. Anyone who knew you at Hogwarts could tell them it’s a lost cause.” Draco takes a final step, standing almost but not quite between Harry’s knees.

“And what was I supposed to do, Accio-boy?” Tonks asked. “Cast an
When no one volunteered to retrieve the stone they settled on Fred’s trainer and, with much grimacing, Alicia bestowed a small kiss on the tip of one of the laces. A shower of Scouring charms followed, with much grimacing on Alicia’s part and faux-outrage from Fred.
“Draco? Where are you going?”
“It, er, it shows the viewer whatever they most desire,” says Harry, ripping the bottom out of Draco’s stomach. “Bit like the Mirror of Erised, you know?” He darts a glance at Draco, then quickly looks away. “Ginny talked me into having it, er, there-” he makes an abortive gesture towards the small of his back. “I thought, um. Thought when you came up here that you might be coming to rip the piss out of me, you know, maybe for having a tattoo of myself or something…”
“Now that I’m no longer trying to murder you, you want to spend time with me?” Draco tried to keep the hurt out of his voice.
“No, that’s not what I…Harry…” Draco was staring at Harry, his face twisted in distress. “I didn’t realise that you thought we were. You know.”
Still, Harry was fairly sure that after the weekend was over he would be able to walk into a room full of Slytherins without getting hexed. Or stunned. Or having his wanking hand transformed into a cheese grater. The teams weren’t exactly friends, but having a common goal with months of training still ahead of them created a certain respect that-
“Oh,” Draco blinked, finally looking at Harry. “That’s... it’s fine, Potter. I don’t mind.”
“You... you can’t prove anything...” he tried to meet her eyes, vering off at the last minute to inspect the stuffed mouse perched on the mantelpiece.
Taking a deep breath, Harry turned to Draco. A deep flush was spreading across Draco’s face, making the spots on his chin even more prominent and highlighting the dampness at his temples. His eyes were lowered, dark lashes stark against the soft pink of his skin. Draco’s hands were still curled into fists on his lap and he flinched when Harry shifted closer, his red tongue darting out to wet his thin lips. Thin lips that Harry would soon be kissing, if he could just get his own hands to stop trembling.
“But are you really alright?” Scorpius had got his tears under control and was now scowling up at Draco. “Like, properly? Because sometimes spell damage takes a while to show up, you know? Like you feel alright in the beginning and then you walk around a bit and then poof, you drop dead!”
“Put that down,” Harry hissed. He was already regretting giving the mug to Ron. Still, better than Cormac. “That is not Malfoy, it just looks like him. And secondly-” Harry snapped his mouth closed, realising he’d been about to point out that Malfoy probably wouldn’t mind getting naked for him, seeing how eager he’d been to take his clothes off at Harry’s- No. Delete. Erase. Annul. No thinking about that.
“How long have you known about this?” Harry ignored them both and turned to Draco, a thrill of joy shooting through him as he realised Draco was sitting with his arm lightly resting on the back of Harry’s chair.
“I’m afraid not, you see-”
“Potter.” Blood rushed to Draco’s face as the name slipped past his lips. Glancing around, Draco satisfied himself that no one had heard his outburst—Lucius was still talking to Fudge while Narcissa was smiling at something on the pitch—and refocused his omnioculars. Harry Bloody Scarhead Bloody Saviour Bloody Bloody Potter, sitting in the pleb seats with the Weasels and, judging by his gormless grin, having a marvellous time. Draco’s hands tightened on the omnioculars and they squeaked in protest.
“You must know what peer pressure is, Potter,” Mafalda joined in. “The feeling that everyone else is doing something so you should too.”
“Think it’s best we get out the way.” Freckled fingers wrapped around Draco’s elbow and Ron started leading him towards an ambulance parked further up the street.
“You wouldn’t believe me.”
Their voices had risen with each exchange and they were now glaring at each other, hands gripping the table and breath coming heavily.
“This really is the most ridiculous activity I have—”
“Potter.” Draco pulled the shirt down, lifting his feet onto the bench and tucking the hem over his knees. It made him look a bit like he had a very pointy pair of breasts—a thought Harry quickly decided not to share as Draco gestured to the spot beside him. “Sit if you want.”
The memory charm fell away. Harry remembered.
“Watch the screen.” Draco cleared his throat, pale grey eyes flicking over to Harry. “Not me.”
“Yeah, bye,” Harry stumbled out of the room. He was out the flat and halfway down the stairs before he realised that he was smiling.
“So, is the ferret also in the oven?”
“Yep.” Harry nods. “A bit. We should go downstairs, Molly will be asking where we are-”
“Right,” said Harry.
“Oliver, control your boyfriend,” said Angelina as she wrapped an arm around Astoria’s shoulders. The Third Year was looking horrified by the turn of events.
“Roger?” Harry vaguely remembered a pale hazy face that wasn’t quite pointy enough, floating eyes that were brown instead of grey. After Ron had said Draco might fancy him, Harry had planned to enjoy the weekend before going into the office and asking to be assigned a different partner. “I didn’t snog him.” Harry heard himself say around a mouthful of toast. “I don’t think. No, I wouldn’t have.”
-+-+-+-+-+-
Comforted by McGonagall’s implied promise that Hogwarts’ magic would help him control his transformation, Draco returned for his second year in high spirits. He had spent the summer practising on his broom in the Manor Grounds, learning all the kinks and quirks of the Cleansweep Six his mother had picked up on Knockturn Alley. It was a bit scuffed and had a habit of darting straight up into the air when alarmed, but a few Glamours turned it into a passable Nimbus 2001. Having learnt to compensate for his broom’s rather hysterical tendencies, Draco was confident in bagging a spot on the Slytherin Quidditch team.
“Never run when a wand will do!” Harry chanted.
“Oi oi! What’s all this about ‘vigorously rubbing?’” Fred had noticed their conversation, possibly because they had both leapt to their feet and were speaking at the highest possible volume.
“Right that’s enough of that.” Ron’s voice was level as he grabbed Draco’s hand. “Let’s get this nasty graze cleaned up, shall we?” He began dabbing at a long red mark on Draco’s wrist, tightening his grip when Draco squirmed. “Every time you tried to leave the restaurant it flipped the time trap. We still hadn’t worked out if the suspect was carrying and there you were, climbing out the windows and pissing off the waitress. Zach Smith was campaigning for us to drop a sedative in your cereal.”
“What?” Harry’s head snapped up so fast at this that he was fairly sure he felt something tear. “When did that happen?”
“What? Ahem.” He cleared his throat, trying to pretend that he hadn’t just squeaked. “No, I greatly appreciate your help. Please, do go on.”
“You looking forward to having to review those tapes?”
“You what? You’ve only been together a few weeks.”
“Well maybe you could, ah, look off the pitch?” Minerva asked, mentally batting away the pressing need to see Rolanda’s broad grin reassert itself.
like we’re being generous,” said Harry.
“You are wanted,” said Hermione, reaching past Harry to grab the biscuits. She was going for the posh ones, he noted.
“-as you.” Ron continued, raising an eyebrow at Draco’s interruption. “Thought we were going to have to send someone in to tie you to the bloody chair.”
He was sitting back at the table, opposite Potter who was put down his own phone and turned to the waitress. “We need a few more minutes, thanks.”
“Hem hem.” She stepped forward, shaking her head. “I will take it from here, Mr Malfoy.” Draco opened his mouth as if to protest, then closed it again as Umbridge shook her head. “Miss Granger, Mr Potter. This way if you please.” She pointed her wand at the two Gryffindors. “Miss Shatterdrop,” she addressed herself to Janice. “Do not let these students out of your sight until I return.” Umbridge gestured to the rest of the DA members.
“Forgive...”
The Weasley library was actually just a slightly wider section of the first floor landing, inhabited by a comfy window seat, the Muggle phone stand (swathed in a protective bubble), and a collection of sudoku books. Harry is curled up on the seat, the phone jammed between his shoulder and cheek as he traces patterns on the condensation-streaked glass.
“Oh.” Harry didn’t really know what else to say; he was fairly sure that Draco would not appreciate being told that his leggings looked ‘nice.’ They sat and watched the empty hanging baskets sway in the breeze.
They sat in silence as the waitress moved to the next table, Potter having already tasted and given up on his bright, pointy cereal.
“Misguided”? You’re saying you wouldn’t prefer an underwear model?” the expression of discomfort on Potter’s face suggested that his mouthful of spikey cereal was especially pointy.
“Well,” she says, flipping the end of Draco’s scarf up so that it slaps him wetly across the face. “Thank you for the timely reminder that I am neither your elf nor your mother. Not that Narcissa would ever stand for such behaviour.”
M.E.A.T.U.S. is an organisation designed to raise awareness of the many overlooked aspects of human and creature sexuality!” She ran out of breath slightly at the end and paused to take a sip of tea (“called it!” crowed the part of Harry’s brain not spiralling into a panic. This woman was very nice but he really did not want to talk about the erotic potential of his own meatus). “I run workshops and I’ve written a sex manual.” The woman carried on, picking up a leaflet. “Would you like a sample chapter?”
“You know as well?” Draco asked. He was sitting up straight, assessing the three of them. “Tell me. Unless it’s private, of course. Although if it is private I will have you know that the Malfoys are excellent secret keepers. Minds like vaults, once something is in there it’s—”
“I’m saying that Hogwarts is fortified with charms to help the young students control their accidental magic and the longer you stay here the less common any accidents will be.” She nodded and Draco realised he had been dismissed.
“No I do not! It took Draco and I months to go on a vacation together. Months! And they went to Paris, the City of Love, in one week!” Harry interrupted.
Draco smiled and closed his eyes. He let his body relax and his mind calm as he reveled in being close to Harry again.
Draco buried his nose in Harry’s neck for a while before deciding it was enough.
“It’s fine, really, I don’t want you to be cold. It’s just my uniform isn’t really fit for your Scottish weather” she attempted to joke but Draco wasn’t having it.
Soon things got more heated as Astoria started to unbutton his white shirt, her hands exploring his chest.
“If the healers say you can, you can come home with me today and we can get you settled in, since legally we have already ‘adopted’ you as a foster family. Would that be alright?”
Harry saw red.
Currently the three of them were attending the medical conference’s fundraiser after Draco’s successful speech.
“Chapter fifteen, third paragraph” Draco said quietly as he turned his head back to his book.
She had to make absolutely sure that he didn’t see today’s paper; it was almost as if her life depended on it.
“Is this enough?” he asked.
“I’ve missed you so much” she whispered as she kissed him on the mouth. He responded eagerly.
The therapist nodded and started writing again.
“Always so modest! Well, I want to thank you anyway: thank you for helping me” Cedric said.
The forgiving side wanted to take Harry back and see if he had truly changed while the self-preserving and proud side suggested he refuse and further his relationship with Astoria.
Kate looked up and smiled at him.
“It’s been better but it doesn’t hurt so much now” he said.
Kate however looked at him and frowned slightly.
“What Ron means is that Slytherins are bullies and racists” Hermione explained when she saw the expression on Draco’s face.
In the end he had almost been late to his lesson...
“What if Elizabeth doesn’t like Snoodle!” he said “I can’t leave him behind! He’s my best friend!” Harry knew Draco meant his non-human best friend.
Suddenly James realized exactly what was wrong with the ring and mentally slapped himself for being so stupid.
“We can decorate the Great Hall in gold and white. What do you think? ... Draco?” Elizabeth waved her hand in front of his face.
“Would you like to dance?” he asked while offering her his hand. His heart was beating quickly in his chest.
“Which is understandable”
“Twenty points from Slytherin EACH for bullying. Consider yourselves lucky: this is my first and only warning. Now get out of my sight” Professor Snape hissed.
I also wanted to thank you: you were the best boyfriend I could ever have hoped for. You’re kind, funny, sweet, witty and smart! Any girl would be lucky to have you and I’m honored you picked me out of all the possible girls (or boys ;), we both know what I mean).
When Draco took it he was shocked by how bony and weak his hand and grip were.
“I see myself. Smiling” Draco said as he warily watched the image in the mirror.
He ran and ran as fast as he could, not even caring that he left his satchel there. Not caring that his legs felt like they could give out at any moment. Not caring that he couldn’t breathe.
“This is not about you, Harry. I just need to get away and see the world a bit before I settle down and start my life here” Draco said.
Harry’s fists clenched when he saw Draco reach out and tuck a strand of Kate’s hair behind her ear.
“I’ve missed you so much, Love” Harry whispered in his ear, sending a small shiver down his spine.
Draco arrived at his old apartment only to find Harry staring at the wall and smiling brightly.
“James, don’t push him. He’s not hungry!” Lily said in a scolding voice as she patted affectionately Draco’s head.
The two even color coordinated their outfits! Yes indeed, my dear readers!
Kate nodded.
“I’m so happy you’re okay. Never do something like that to me ever again” Harry whispered into his ear as he hugged him fiercely.
Good.
Just to be sure.
“Hey!” he said cheerily as he sat down in front of Harry and placed his Potions book on the desk.
