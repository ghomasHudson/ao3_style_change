Draco waved him off. "Yes, yes. I'm fine."
They stood in silence as Draco processed this.
He no longer grimaced at Harry when he was seen rumpled and frustrated, instead, he’d recounted the situation while he’d sat on Harry’s lap, his eyebrows furrowing at the scrap of paper that constituted as Harry’s ‘wedding checklist.’
He landed on a cushioning charm but it hadn’t stopped him flailing around like a wingless gull. Less grace and more fragility. The sight would have been almost intimate if he hadn’t screamed a litany of curses as he fell.
He found it relaxing, the waxy feel of the leaves coming through his fingers. The solitude was a bonus; maybe this was how Potter felt when he was alone.
Draco thought of answering truthfully for all of three seconds before reverting back to a sneer. “Even I didn't think you were that dense. You see that branch you were so lovingly gazing at earlier, the one on the floor. Well, it’s come from this tree, you see, so putting two and two together you’d see I’m-”
“How do you fuck up a perfectly good crumpet?” Draco said while simultaneously stuffing the light spongy dough into his mouth.
Easing himself out of the cupboard, back-end first, Harry grabbed onto the bottle as if it was a lifeline, conveniently ignoring the dripping that had started above his head.
Before Harry could even think about Walaburga Black’s incessant screaming Ron rushed on, assuring himself that Harry wasn’t too deep in his own head not to listen to him. “What’s that poncey git got to do with sticking charms?”
“I was trapped in such a small bubble that putting myself in someone else’s robes was impossible.”
Ron and Hermione exchanged glances as Harry pulled another chair out from the dining room. Sheepishly he evanesco’ed another pair of glasses.
And Harry had laughed. A decisive snort that dissolved into a smattering of underhanded giggles. Inappropriate, when he looked back on it, the way it had all started, haltingly, over an over abundance of alcohol and gallows humour.
“OW!”
Harry reached to touch the pores on his cheek before pulling his hand back right before he touched him.
Only Harry was left, looking around the Atrium like he’d never seen it before—great glass windows lording over the statue at the end of the large expanse of polished wood that was the floor, although marks from hundreds of witches and wizards had scuffed it near where the floo resided.
“Yeah.”
"Oh. Yeah, sure you were."
“I’m happy, Draco. I just have… more immediate problems.”
He practically felt Lucius drag his hand down his face in slow motion, probably to avoid looking at his son, who was currently kneeling on his floor, frantically making complicated knots in his shoe with a wand hanging from his mouth.
by a Thank You note by a particularly regal looking owl, (Harry had asked if it was possible.)
“That sounds ominous, why? Are you expecting me to set the ministry alight?”
She sat near the front of the congregation, her hair more white than blonde now, although still long and fine as it had been years ago.
“He’s got his wand on him, I don’t want to be hit with any angry spells, which we will be if we just try to drag him away.”
Harry laughed as Draco tried to put two and two together. The fact that Ron could cook really well-put-together, balanced meals and still resorted to eating the worst combinations of those foods himself seemed like an enigma to him.
He'd hoped Shacklebolt wouldn't give him the time off; make up some flimsy excuse about hours like he did with Potter, but no. Since Draco got up at the ass-crack of dawn every Monday to Friday and Potter came in around lunchtime and sometimes skipped Thursdays altogether Draco was 'entitled to a few days off'. It was ridiculous.
Harry looked thrown for a minute before deciding it was better than arguing. After all, Draco might have a concussion and that concussion might be Harry’s fault.
The clock resumed it’s ticking and Draco breathed out, a sort of contented sigh, or maybe a sigh of relief.
Draco lay back, letting Harry ease him into opening up. He teased at the cracks in his memory, wondering all the while whether dredging up the past was as good an idea as Harry seemed to think.
Harry.” She inclined her head before turning back to her old schoolfriend.
“I hope you’ll say yes.”
Harry had been talking since they’d swung out of the Atrium doors, half the Ministry flooing to their respective homes or the pub.
Harry dragged his hand down his face, ignoring the scratch of two day old stubble. “You learned this from Hermione, I suppose?”
“Of course not darling.”
Draco thought about this for a moment, the tip of his wand tapping against his chin. “I concede.” With that he dumped himself at Harry’s feet, legs crossed.
Draco found himself talking into Harry’s hair.
“You can’t tell him what?”
He heard Harry’s voice catch as he pointed his wand downward, and instantly jerked his hand backward. “I- it was a lighting charm.” Before he could change his mind a “Lumos” had been cast and Harry’s face was awash with light.
"Hey! Shut up. Stop bullying me."
“I’m looking at the stars,” he said vaguely.
He touched his hair gingerly before zeroing in on Harry's dresser. "Is that a... Chudley Cannons scarf? That's it. Crush on you well and truly finished."
“Okay.” Draco nodded.
"Let them sell that to the Daily Prophet."
"I'd better be going anyway-" Draco was about to ask for the man-who-certainly-was-not-Potter's age, but before he could he was cut off by his voice - clearly he hadn't finished his little goodbye speech "-I'd better be getting back to the Mrs."
about going straight away.”
“Why me?” His voice came out whiny and infantile. Draco bit his lip. “Fine. Why do you want him, again?”
“You’re one to talk about convention.” Harry had moved to prop himself up on an elbow, shifting in such a way that Draco groaned where the mattress dipped.
“Well,” Draco pointed north to a cluster of stars. “That’s my namesake, Draco. See the way it dips down then up before ending in the tail. And that one-” he moved his finger so he was circling the zodiac. “In between the crab and the maiden is Leo, the lion.” He grinned, obviously impressed with himself. “Too bad there isn’t a constellation called Harry.”
“You probably need stronger reading glasses.”
Draco smiled as he fiddled with the drops. “If I started with the words ‘I’m just gonna disintegrate part of your eye.’ I doubt you would have let me anywhere near them.”
“Something like that.” Draco fixed his tie, turning to Harry for approval.
The Potions Room was a small room off to their left, embossed with a black nameplate bearing the same name. Draco had hardly glanced at it, purposely sitting as far away from the place as humanly possible.
“Come on then.”
The red socks were an accidental homage to his house - although Draco would have been appalled if he’d seen him in them.
Hermione got to the pub when the sky had already blackened. Harry was most certainly drunk. More drunk than he’d ever been in his life, he assumed, as he watched the floor sway under his feet and the sky splinter into stars.
Harry looked at him. Not through him, like he’d previously thought, but at him. He almost stopped breathing.
“You’ve messed up the translation.”
Harry hesitated for only a fraction of a second before shrugging and dropping to the ground, the autumn leaves crunching under his back as he shifted.
“I’m sorry I ruined your dress shoes. And the sink. And the umbrella stand.”
His hand lingered for a beat longer on the cool metal of Narcissa’s chair.
"Huh?" Lark looped his arm around Draco as they pushed their way through the door, the warmth evaporating as soon as the heat and smoke was locked safely back inside the Pheonix.
He brought his hand up to his forehead self-consciously and Draco reached out, just shy of touching his knuckles. Slowly, Harry entwined his fingers with Draco’s.
Harry didn’t have to think about what he meant, but Draco said it anyway. Softly, his voice cracking as he looked up at the ceiling.
going out with
Draco hummed knowingly. “Oh... this and that.” He glanced up the stairs before wandering into the living room.
Draco dolled out a plate of sausage and egg, ignoring the way Teddy whined about his plate being full of 'breakfast food', instead taking to stabbing the browning sausages almost viciously before cutting them up.
Was this how Muggles felt?
He pushed his eggs around his plate. “It’s very resilient, you know. If you want to see it.”
Even if there were office rumours about the man being shrewd enough to go into hiding, Draco doubted it was very likely, considering the fact that his eye was on Draco’s desk.
“Shit.”
He turned back to the line guiltily as it shuffled forward, the hot food calling to him, aggressively reminding him that he’d skipped breakfast.
Draco’s eyes shone at this, although he fought tooth and nail with his burgeoning smile - choosing instead to take a couch cushion from its space between the back of the sofa and his ribs and hurl it at Harry’s head.
“Whatever was in that kiss must have been strong.” Harry laughed as he stumbled over his own feet, Draco grabbing him around the waist before he could fall. They were back in Grimmauld Place, the apparition far less sickness-inducing than usual.
Their foreheads pressed together, a single, perfect moment, trapped at the end of the most disastrous week of Harry’s life.
Harry did his best to hold in his snort as Draco coughed up most of his tea.
“I’m not going home tonight, I’ll try to kill someone. Maybe myself. Could I stay with you? For tonight?”
“If he’s looking at your feet he’s a trollop anyway.” Ron laughed, opening the door to a small gaggle of people that had gathered on Harry’s doorstep.
“Of course, he seemed to be concerned you would set the house on fire or some such nonsense.” Draco looked towards his bedside unit.
“Actually, no. I do care.” Draco said, breaking the spell. “Fuck Robards, he deserves it.”
To his surprise, Harry laughed.
Draco looked at Harry for a long moment before replying.
Harry did as he was told, trying not to squirm as his sofa turned into a temporary chair-lift and he, a temporary test subject.
“That’s Polaris.” Draco pointed to the brightest star in the sky. He watched Harry as he located it. “At nightfall in May, the Big Dipper is above it, see?” He traced the outline loosely.
“Oh shove off Malfoy, from what I can gather it’s basically wizard LASIK. It’s not exactly the idea of the century.”
“Broke my glasses, sir.” Harry jerked his head back to where a single arm was poking out of the rubble he’d kicked up.
“I’m not trying to crash your downtime, but Hermione wanted me to keep an eye on you.”
Harry rolled his eyes, smiling for a camera that was pushed in his face before the reporter went off to find another hapless victim. “Into what? I can’t promise everything but I won’t blow up the Ministry.”
Which, in Draco’s opinion was far more his thing. Or his stomach’s thing anyway.
He didn’t have to explain. Harry just nodded. He went to sit on the sofa instead. “So, please explain my living room?”
That had to be a dream.
He really couldn’t understand why the man was so ecstatic at this time of morning, it was unreal. He was always either awake or asleep, seemingly with nowhere in between.
He must have been missing Draco more than he thought he was, if he was thinking in his speech patterns. Maybe he needed more sleep than he’d originally thought.
“I don’t really care about him right now.” This time, when Harry went to touch him, Draco did not pull away. They stood, forehead pressed against one another, watching the racing flecks swirling around each other’s eyes.
was something he had to bookmark.
“It’s easier to go with what’s expected of you.” Now that they’d started whatever
"Get married?" Lark quirked an eyebrow in Draco's direction but didn't oppose him.
.” Harry smiled fondly, already undoing his jeans. “Tea,” he rolled his eyes, “you’re so pretentious… Can you make me sausages?”
“I’m not. I took a Health and Safety course while in Belfast.”
Draco relaxes into the feeling of being allowed to take control, whirling Harry almost seamlessly in and out of the masses of people, manoeuvring him around the dance floor with a dexterity Harry had never seen before.
They were so green. Like velvet, or the sea around the Hebrides where he went on holiday with his mother once.
He immediately reached for his gloves. “There has to be fingerprints or…” whatever he was doing, he wasn’t talking to Harry anymore.
“Are you coming?” Draco asked, bored.
"Perfect! Harry will be ready in a minute!"
Draco sighed, but made little more complaint as he folded over Harry’s shirt fabric until he got enough to work on.
“Is it?” Draco seemed not to have noticed.
“They’ve taken me off the case. I didn’t promise to fix your stupid eyes and they took me off the bloody case.” He said as calmly as he could, his voice barely shaking.
”-and the lady and gentleman.” The Pastor added for the convenience of Mr and Mrs Granger - who blushed profusely.
The wine cellar was cool and dry, and quiet. His head was pounding. Draco knew he would never get used to the dry heat of Brittany the way Narcissa had. For all her faults, his mother always looked immaculate, even now, with the greying streaks slicing through her blonde hair - it only served to make her look like a fractured mirror when she moved, beautiful and strange.
"Oh? It was quite nice while it lasted."
"Marrying me what the-" Draco cut himself off as he spied the clothes he'd kicked off earlier in the night. Apart from them being all over his room, a lone shoe sat snuggled in the corner. A lone shoe with a big, purple stain on the upper part of his shoe.
Malfoy hadn’t been fired then.
“What? Why would it be your fault I’ve had Moody’s eye since before…”
“Alright, alright I’m getting up but I’m going to have to hold onto something or I’ll fall down the stairs.” Draco said through a bleary-eyed yawn while Harry pulled him to his feet.
The latex of the newly issued mandate gloves didn’t allow it to respond at all. He’d spent countless nights trying until he finally pulled them off in a huff, wadding them into a tight ball, which he watched unravel as they went sailing through the air. Then the eye had wriggled.
Oh, no reason.”
What he wanted to understand, he wasn’t sure. Reaching out, Harry carded his fingers through Draco’s hair as an alternative to thinking.
Draco gave him a weak smile. “That’s one thing we agree on.”
"Of course." Draco waved him away with a flourish of his hand. The man could do what he liked, he was the one who'd been throwing around his sickles all evening.
But then Harry is by his side again, grasping his gloved hand and thrusting both of their hands deep into his coat pocket.
By the time they got to the Portkey Harry had eaten half a cucumber sandwich and a fifth of a chocolate frog.
Dickens
“Lumos.”
“I used the massive book on the desk for reference. I’m really sorry Draco. I didn’t mean to tell you this late but I was thinking about-”
“Never before have I been so revolted by you but you sound like Aunt Petunia.” Harry stuck his tongue out in disgust before pulling his own jacket on and following his flustered boyfriend downstairs. “What did you go out for this morning?”
“Will it?”
Harry grinned. It felt like the perfect opportunity to annoy the man. “No.”
“Odd?” Harry raised an eyebrow as he watched Draco grapple for the words he’d lost.
Draco went pink.
“Oh. Gawain. What can I do for you?” Draco tapped his fingers on the underside of his desk. He hated people interrupting him, especially people who weren’t actually his boss, double for when they thought they could order him around anyway. Robards was of no exception.
“So, acetone.”
He never saw himself like this. And Harry had decided to put it on his bookcase. So he could watch Draco laugh over and over again.
Because, for once, Draco was looking toward the future. The what if was a more hopeful question.
Refractions. Dilation.
“Both. Where’d you get that?” Harry pointed to the chicken bits scattered across Ron’s dish. They were certainly not on the menu from what Harry had seen.
“And you came to this conclusion how?”
His eyes sparkled as he made his way down the aisle, the snow collecting on the hem of his robe making him look ethereal.
He turned back around and immediately flushed. “Oh. Minister, hello!”
Harry put his head in his hands, slumping into a rounded armchair that was tucked beside the window to Draco’s left. “This is my fault isn’t it?”
He knows this will always be his house, that he'll always be welcome here, but no matter the love Molly has for him he doesn't really want to run into Ginny, It'll feel like he's trespassing. More than sneaking down the halls ever will.
Pointing at Draco, Harry continued. “You need about a weeks worth of sleep first, don’t argue with me. I know you get up in the middle of the night to write down your ideas.”
“Have you stopped though? When I told you the first time did you even consider why I was informing you at all? You work for the government! You handle their secrets!”
“Do you have no sense of morality whatsoever? I thought I’d killed you! And then I thought I’d given you amnesia for Merlin’s sake! I was ready to forgive you-”
“I hate you.” Draco said to no one in particular, but maybe he was talking to the eye, of which he was already bending to scoop up, trying not to recoil at the slightly sticky residue it left on his naked flesh.
"Did he poppet? What was it?"
"Bastard." Draco whispered, Narcissa pulled the newspaper down from her eyes, raising an arched brow in Draco's direction.
“Shacklebolt might relegate you to the archives, or actually make you do your backlog of paperwork.”
Warmth flooded through Draco and he couldn't tell if it were Harry's hands or his own cheeks, or both, but when he leaned up into Harry's lips, it didn't matter anymore.
“Are you always like this?” Draco asked, bewildered that Hermione wasn’t outraged. “Why?”
Draco snorted at this but he said nothing else.
He lowered the shield and whisked away the broken glass. The eye was surprisingly unharmed. When he turned back around, Draco was faced with an empty room. Robards had left. The door, however, was swinging on it’s latch.
He looked Ron in the eye as he swallowed the rest of his bun. “Why’s it always food with you? I’d feel less disturbed if you were having an affair.”
”I think you might have to hop in the shower.”
Harry coloured at this, smiling sheepishly. “She dropped off some sort of cake. I don’t know what it is but I found it in the fireplace with a note.”
“Well sure,” Harry’s mouth crinkled into a smile at the memory. “I have great friends and family-” (Draco didn’t have to ask if he meant the Weasley’s) “and you.”
The look had been withering.
Harry knew about most of this - Draco spoke about his father with reckless abandon, quick and venomous.
Robards didn’t look angry, which was usually worse. He sighed heavily, dragging his hand down his face in a gesture that he seemed to reserve solely for Harry. “Potter, what the hell?”
Harry nodded. He smiled at Draco, who’d unknowingly given him the permission he needed to not talk to any reporter for the entire night. It wasn’t quite bliss, but it was close enough.
“Pureblood genes.” Ron shrugged, his button down heaving along with his chest, “It’s just something that gets passed down through the family and you assume everyone else just knows about it. It honestly didn’t twig until tonight that you might be looking for a sticking charm solution. Anyway, it’s not really a
“I still think I did something illegal.”
The sobering potion had been wrapped tightly in his fist since Draco had insisted he take it. Now that the cold was hitting him he realised he probably needed it.
Tipping his head back, Draco shut his eyes. “Carry on, then.”
“One?” He still sounded sceptical. “Maybe you need new glasses too.”
"Oh for Sala-" Draco caught himself. No-one spoke to him outside of Potter's stupid charity fundraisers and speeches, he might as well bandy the bloke's name around for some purpose. "Yes, I did."
“Keep your voice down or they’ll-” Draco was about to tell Harry he’d have his wand confiscated but he trailed off at the sight of the statue in the middle of the room.
As the sun sank below the horizon, Draco started to panic, going as far as to consider - if only for a split second - turning his wand inwards so he could try a self-inflicted defence spell.
“You have a wine stain on your shirt.” Pansy rolled her eyes.
"I'm well, thank you, mother."
“Sure you don’t.” Draco tried to smirk but it was cut off by a yawn.
Arthur was on his arm, jittering with excitement as he passed through the crowd of onlookers.
He heard the sound of her thin heels before he saw the rest of her. Pansy had kept her A-line bob and her severe frown, but her wardrobe choice had become much more conservative since she’d landed a high end business partnership with a Muggleborn investor in Japan.
A dusting of light beer froth coated his top lip as he made a considerable effort to refrain from saying anything else that would set him off again.
The figure that she'd previously hidden flickered across the front page, stopping in the centre to fix on Draco. Big, brown eyes stared out from the page, like an owl, sizing up it's prey.
He never saw himself like this.
“I’m reading.”
The next day he was back on the sofa, Draco’s jaw soft and fuzzy around the edges of his vision.
“Pizza.”
“Yes.” He said, finally, before adding “what is… this?”
As Draco’s feet left the floor all he could think about was the way he wished to be whisked into a fictional world, once apon a time.
After half a minute Draco leaned back on his hands, and he felt Harry pull away. His hair was sticking to the back of his neck and Harry's was more mussed than Draco had ever seen it. His lip quirked as he looked at Harry, dishevelled and bright eyed.
“I guess so.” Came the muffled reply. “But never let me do it again, you’re an awful lab rat, you twitch.”
“Not according to your colleagues.” Hermione smiled. “Ah, Ron! There you are!”
“Maybe.” Harry still didn’t believe it but he chose to keep his thoughts to himself. He’d watched Draco go through about six different emotions in the past ten minutes and the one he chose now was anger, slamming glass bottles into bags as if they were unbreakable.
“I… don’t remember what I was saying.” Harry’s mouth was dry. It was hot here, maybe he was claustrophobic. Or maybe he just didn’t like the idea of a hundred tonnes of dirt weighing him down from above. Maybe he didn’t like the thought of being dead.
“Uh, he hasn’t.” Harry pushed the bridge of his glasses up his nose, where they promptly slid back down.“Not... officially anyway.”
Draco searched his trouser pockets, eventually coming up with an empty phial.
“It’s cold.” Draco cast a heating charm on the tepid liquid before giving his own mug of tea a chance.
He didn’t realise he was holding his breath until Harry sat down. “Have you tried getting your broom?”
“I need you to do something about Potter.”
“Except red.” Draco wrinkled his nose. His suit was, of course, grey: a charcoal that was offset only by his green tie. He’d said something about it matching Harry’s eyes and the man had gone incredibly swoony.
”Yeah... yeah okay. Sure”
“No.” Harry was so glad to have his wand back from the dratted wand-box as he floated plates of casserole through the partition.
“And yes, actually.” Harry was still talking. “I read every one of my school books under the covers with a torch the first year. It was like stepping into fantasy-land. You can’t imagine how boring maths was in primary for me to actively want to read things.”
“So you
“You’re not going to
Instead of porn, bad or otherwise, Harry said, “So, dinner?”
“I don’t know why you’re asking me, you look good in everything.”
Silvery wisps of hair collected around Draco’s face. He was so used to being taller than Harry that the disadvantage he was suddenly at made him blush.
“Didn’t look like he hated you ten minutes ago darling.”
There was a finality to it, as Draco placed his palm in Harry's, feeling the rough, calloused warmth.
Draco presses the blanket to his nose, breathing in Harry's scent long after he's gone. It's been a month and neither of them have broached the subject of what to call they're little affair.
“That he was right, essentially.” Her eyes were steely as she levelled her chin towards Draco, who was trying his best not to smirk. “Don’t. Say. A. Word.”
Hermione’s hand flew to her mouth as she swore under her breath. “You can’t tell him you know. I’ve got a lot on my plate right now, I really didn’t mean to say anything Harry, I’m so sorry.”
“No way, I’m done with all that. You’re an adult and you have a bunch of money, even if you choose to live in that torn up apartment you can’t hide from your privilege so use it. I know you have in the past. You still do.”
While this was, by all means, not exactly new territory for Harry, it was for Draco, who hadn’t remembered anything about the night in the cupboard.
"Someone's getting married."
“I rearranged one of your bookshelves a bit this morning.”
He should’ve known Hermione would come as early as feasibly possible, she was always
“Did you want to keep an eye on me?”
He stopped her.
“Have you tried using acetone?”
His eyes were bright and his arm was slung around his friends. His hair was glossy, catching the light of the lense. His chin was a little less pointed when he laughed. He looked, for once in his life, like the angel his mother said she thought he was.
Harry sealed the charm shut again as he watched Robards’ figure come closer, no doubt shouting something obscene at Harry as he dived between the people with clipboards that were clustered in small groups around the windows. He only glanced back once, his stupid eyes converting the lab coats to snowballs of white amidst the greying afternoon sky.
The floo whoshed to signal he had guests two minutes after he’d stepped into the shower. He rolled his eyes, continuing to soap his hair. “
"Another... yes. Andrew will be back in a minute." Draco nods, less stiffly than before.
The headline was printed in bold, black letters:
Molly smiles at Draco, gently. A fragile smile that may break if it's disturbed. She lifts her wand and Harry watches the wool slide back onto the needles, the double stitch neatly unpicking itself. Draco doesn't look away from Harry, the blush rising up his cheeks involuntarily, although he does try to stop it, with growing difficulty.
“I’m doing you a favour, remember. I could be having a nice cup of tea right about now but-”
Harry turned to watch multiple rivulets of water trickling from the sink and down the hall,  converging only at the entrance of the living room door, a thin line of water soaking into the carpet on the other side.
“Please? I know it’s a childish way to-” Harry’s nose and ears coloured considerably, warmth radiating from his cheeks.
“What, like I have my whole weekend?” Harry grimaced as he lowered his head onto the table, Draco pressing his palm in circles in between his shoulder blades.
He stared at Harry’s palm again and he almost asked Harry why his lifeline had a scar cutting through it but quickly thought better of it. Skeletons, he thought, should stay in closets. For now, at least.
He rolled his eyes at that. “Alrighty then.”
He’d refused to look at the paper that morning - not that he read it anyway, but he usually liked having some idea of the topic of conversation just in case he was sprang upon by a particularly enthusiastic witch. There was no chance of that now, not until this curse was lifted.
“Only after you thought I’d died. Duly noted.”
“Fuck off.”
LOCK UP YOUR DRINKS CABINET: DRACO ON THE LOOSE
"He's not- never mind. Don't repeat that. Got it?" The exasperated tone isn't directed at Teddy but Draco feels a roiling in his stomach when Teddy's face fell. "I'm sorry Teddy. I'm not disappointed in you, I'm disappointed in me. I shouldn't have said a bad word. Please don't tell your dad?"
“You’ve been cursed.” Hermione said flatly, looking downcast as she read from the passage again.
“Oh. Then, thank you.”
“I’ve wanted to do this since fifth year.” Harry mumbled against Draco’s lips before flopping onto his back again.
As the clock let out another loud reverberation Draco placed the eye in it’s box - all the while feeling the dread that came with locking a small animal in a cage.
Draco's hands are delicate, pearlescent. Harry just wants to hold them to his chest, kiss his fingertips... try to breathe some life into the marble beauty beneath him.
A light appeared from Harry’s own outstretched wand, bathing his face in a clear pearlescent glow. His eyes were clouded with sleep and his hair mussed up on one side. He grimaced as he watched Draco take in his new, clearer appearance.
“How was your trip? I know you were panicking about the-”
He bounced his foot on the branch beneath his heel as he watched the pink sky fade to orange, tapping his heel vigorously in time with his thoughts.
Harry cleared his throat. “What he
Tap. Bounce. Tap. Bounce.
“Well, that was a disaster. Whoever said ‘
But Harry did.
“So…” Ron looked from Draco to Hermione and back again. “What the fuck is going on?” His eyes settled on Harry, as if he could answer, or even formulate words to describe what was currently happening in Hermione’s living room.
Draco blinked hard before closing his eyes, considering what he wanted to say next.
Harry swallowed, forcefully. His voice was too loud for the intimacy of a moment he’d want to cherish.
"And I am?" Harry's eyebrows disappeared into his hair as he watched Draco frantically search the room for his clothes without moving from the bed.
He was roaring drunk, his arm slung loosely around Pansy’s. Someone had taken a camera out. He didn’t know who. He didn’t particularly care.
“No.”
“Your papers are with Pansy.” Harry reminded him, as if Draco could forget.
“It’s two o’ clock! We’re going to be late!”
"I see. Ah, Narcissa. Your son is here to see you."
Harry let go of Molly and held out his hand to Arthur. “Thank you.”
Shaklebolt’s smile was brief. “I heard our Head Auror can’t do his speech… as his partner he must have at least read it to you, could you...?” The Minister let the question hang in the air.
“Have I
of this.” Harry sounded exasperated. A dark tint had collected under his eyes from two nights of travel and Merlin-knows how many hours of wasteful conversation. His hosts had been quite accommodating with the tea and biscuits but less so information-wise. He’d eventually given up, sloping off to Ron and Hermione’s for a break before he looked for someone else tomorrow. Even he couldn’t function on the fraction of sleep he’d managed to get.
He turned away, rifling quickly through the drawer, fingers skating over the other items he’d left in there; a ballpoint pen, little love notes Harry had left over the years, a pack of seeds for a houseplant that had yet to actually be planted, and, of course, the box tucked at the back.
And then she’d started talking about Mermaid Rights.
Harry rested his chin on top of Draco’s head as he knelt, sighing as he gave up on the mess.
He did this for a few moments before Harry broke the silence; it was easier to talk while staring at the sink bottom.
Draco opened his eyes, moonstones in every aspect; wide and granite grey. His lips parted and in those seconds he turned into a painting. He was marble until he started giggling, a laugh bubbling up from so deep in his stomach that his head ended up falling forward, his whole body shaking. “Drunk, Potter? Are you mad?”
“I’ll remind you of that the next time you need my help for something.”
Draco’s dress shoes were immaculate when he’d gotten them, a low heeled leather dress shoe with a patent square toe. They were quite nice to look at, really. Or they had been. The problem was, Draco had put them on the shoe rack by the door before he’d left for Belfast, because it was practical.
It'd been Granger's innovation, if he remembered correctly, God knows Potter hadn't developed any of his grandfather's talent for hair potions. However, the way Luna wore the spell was unique.
“I’m sorry you didn’t get to show me whatever you were working on, it seemed important to you.”
Draco shut his eyes, trying to refocus the wavering images he'd managed to dredge up from last night... and if the hair was anything to go by..
He sighed, realising he'd eventually have to contribute to the conversation going on over his head. "No. Thank you very much. I do not need anyone to accompany me to my mother's summer home I'm very capable of using an International Floo Connection."
know anyway?” Harry narrowed his eyes at his friend, who laughed. He genuinely wondered whether Ron would be so cruel as to prank him with something like this.
“Pizza?”
He let his hand drop.
The ball, which they’d been so graciously invited to attend, was an illustrious occasion that couldn’t really be turned down -
sneaking around.”
“Well, you don’t, so, either tell me what you’re doing in my space or leave. Shut the door behind you.”
“Your issue is with your macula… or fovea I haven’t figured out which yet since they’re so close together— look up?”
Instead, he turned over, carefully, steadying his breathing as he watched long, dark hair shift against his pillow.
It was a dark blue velvet, rounded at the top. He tried not to catch his fingers on the hinges as he pried it from it’s corner.
“Nonsense, you’d be serenading Mrs. Black.” Harry found it much more satisfying insulting Walburga when she couldn’t see him - and right now he didn’t want
Harry had woken continuously at 6am for the last twelve years, first with Ginny and later with Draco - minus the eight months in between when he’d slept alone for the first time since he was seventeen.
He looked up, eyes skimming past the windows of the upper levels of the Ministry where people were scurrying about like moths in a tank. His eyes rested on the top floor: Level One; the offices of the Minister. He watched Kingsley swoop around the room as an unidentifiable man stood, statuesque at the door, refusing to move into the light. No matter how much Harry squinted, he couldn’t make out who it was—until, of course, Draco Malfoy apparated into the Atrium with a loud pop.
know this?” Harry threw his hands in the air. “Also, that
"Where!" Draco yelped, turning in a quick circle, trying to get a glimpse of messy brown hair and- he didn't know what colour Larks eyes were. He didn't care. Because right now Harry was grasping his shoulder, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth - the way he always smiled, the way everyone smiled after the war, like they aren't sure whether they're allowed to - his eyes filled with mirth. His bright, green eyes.
Harry still didn’t understand. Not really.
acetone.” He pointed to the spray bottle besides the dress shoes.
"Oh." Lark went from looking shocked to bemused in the span of about ten seconds. "Oh!" Draco wondered, for the first time, how old he was. "Yeah, I'll- I'll do that then. Can I nip off to the Potions Room first though?"
Draco still can't quite place it - cedar and cinnamon with undertones of... something - maybe broom polish. His toes are visible from the bottom of the blanket. Harry's so much shorter than he is, it's so obviously a perfect size for him. He resolves to find a place that supplies knitting needles, and some wool.
“Maybe.” Draco acknowledged, slumping forward a second later.
Draco settled his head back on the sofa. “Can I continue my monologuing, now that you know there’s food on the way?”
Andrew comes back from his break, raising his eyebrows at Draco before he's whirled away into the crowd, the music starting up again, although with less poise.
He shrugged it off when his alarm clock didn’t ring; it’d been broken for so long it was just part of the decor now.
The words were like magic unto themselves. The last piece slotted into a long abandoned puzzle.It all made a sudden, awful kind of sense.The soft blurring of ink on creamy paper. The pain.
“How are you so sure?” Draco squinted.
“Do you understand how concerned my mother was when she found out I liked people other than girls?” There was a dry type of lilt to his voice, as if he was trying - and failing - to lighten the mood at the dismal turn in conversation.
"Yeah, why not?" Draco felt a flash of heat tingle down his spine as he lent into Lark, angling his body away from the wind.
“This is the most unorthodox position you could have put yourself in.” Harry said. From his vantage point, Draco was as fuzzy as he had been every time Harry had to remove his glasses, all soft and sweet, like a rippling puddle or a streetlight after you try to focus on it for too long.
”About you rubbing off on me or the bookmark?”
Draco holds out his hands, the crackling down his spine piquing in intensity as Harry pulls him from his chair.
Pansy drank her wine in long gulps, making a face every time, her dark red lips bunching together in the worst way.
“If you did sleep.”
They were all placed in the middle of the third shelf in such an obviously ordered way, jutting out from their usual pushed-back state, that Draco couldn’t help looking at the spines. Intrigued, he fumbled for his reading glasses, cursing softly when he realised he’d left them on the nightstand. Not that they’d really do him any good.
He wasn’t angry though, accidents happened and the best you could do was fix things afterwards. He glanced at the heavy black lines on his arm before focusing all his attention back onto Harry.
Draco threw floo powder into the fireplace as Harry skidded across the carpet. “Oh no! My shoes!”
“You won’t. He loves you.” Hermione said quietly. “I promise, he’ll be over the moon after all this is over. I
He was squinting up at him, glancing from Draco’s white face to the branch and back. His eyes narrowed when he looked back at Draco. “How do I know this isn’t a trick?”
Draco waved a hand. "I'll figure it out."
“Concerned?”
“They’re the ones he bought for the ball.” Harry admitted.
The subheading wasn't much better:
Harry had been there too, waiting at the entrance for someone. Probably Ron or Ginny.
“Whatever you were going to ask.” He lifted a hand, piano teeth fingers caressing the air in an attempt to ask Harry to talk, in not so many words. “Ask away.”
It would have rolled out of the door if not for the lone glove that barricaded it in. He breathed out, running a hand through his hair as he realised a single blue ball of latex that had missed the bin yesterday evening might have just saved his job.
Draco told Harry as much in bed that morning. Calling him unconventional just made Harry laugh as he’d pressed his stomach into Draco’s, forehead resting neatly between the crook of his neck and his shoulder.
“You’re in my house.” Harry pointed out delicately.
Harry laughed as Draco made a face that was a mixture of disgust and confusion.
“For a Hit Wizard you talk a lot.”
"Are you sure you don't want any of us to come with you?"
He must be up to something.
“Are you aware I don’t speak eye anatomy?” He didn’t say it meanly, it was just a stated fact, like a secret shared between only them, this small admittance of ignorance.
The eye jumped again, responding to his touch.
“I- excuse you, did you just say
Harry took a bite of his bacon roll. “I’m sort of glad she’s not here, she’d have a fit if she saw me eating this.”
He screwed up his nose, not wanting to think about Robards at all, let alone while he was sneaking around the underbelly of the only wizarding government building in London. To take his mind off what they were doing - which he still felt uneasy about, regardless of how legal it would have been if he’d taken his superiors up on their offer - he talked. A lot.
The word
“Do you have your speech with you?” Draco looked down at Harry’s hands, noticing they were empty.
She cut him off, pointing a finger at him. “Yes. And Draco’s going to have to hold off on… Never mind that, you were supposed to write that speech for the Minister - a month ago, Harry, don’t go blaming that on the curse - and it was Draco who saved you from possibly being fired! It was important!”
“No I don't.” Harry scrambled to keep up as Draco started walking again, if possible, he was being even brisker than before. “They trust me with jack shit. They want powerful, not smart. That’s why they keep you people around.”
“Honestly Ronald! You can’t wait an hour?”
Harry pushes his head into Draco's neck, letting him take the lead as they weave in and out of the crowd. "I liked the previous pianist much better."
He also thought some other things but they were definitely more down to his lack of a sex life and absolutely nothing to do with the hint of clavicle under Draco’s shirt.
He narrowed his eyes at Draco’s wand hand. “Don’t you dare think of cleaning my jeans while I’m wearing them.”
“That’s Head Auror Robards to you boy.”
"So, how are you, Draco?"
“It tastes like shit. My head hurts.” He said offhandedly, as if he’d just noticed, as if it hadn’t been pulsing slowly behind his temples since late afternoon, although, it was easing.
"Oh crap, not again."
Another silence descended and Harry jumped to fill it with a matter that he considered more pressing: “Would you like to continue your tale of woe, or do you want dinner first?”
“Damn him. I can’t believe he didn’t even look at my list!” She darted into the kitchen, kneeling down close to the grate.
"Birds?"
Draco raised his eyebrow. “Are you now?” He sipped his tea.
"You're cute when you're drunk. I'll think about it in the morning when I'm... not." Lark bubbled, the laughter bursting out of him as they stumbled around the corner, the nearest multi-location Portkey emitting a familiar faint blue light. Above it probably read the words "Don't Drink & Splinch!" But everything was spinning, so Draco couldn't really tell.
“She flooed you a cake and you said nothing?”
Draco wasn’t a lab technician but he wasn’t an idiot either. If he got his possessions down to fingerprint analysis he could get results within the hour—if he promised Pansy he’d come over later for some cream scones and pink wine.
"Fuck!" Teddy says proudly, a smile stretched like sunshine across his face.
Obediently, Draco felt around his temples and ran his hand through his hair. He heard a soft swear word come from the end of the bed, ignoring it in favour of the feeling of his hands in his scalp. “Maybe.” Draco shrugged.
Somehow he’d managed to get the end of the tablecloth twisted quite severely into one of his belt loops and removing it required a lot of fiddling while pretending to look interested in the caviar.
He stopped tracing Harry’s hand, instead lifting his palm up to his cheek, leaning upwards to press a kiss to his lips, soft at first, before letting himself sink into the feeling. “I forgive you for moving my books.” Draco mumbled against his lips.
”I decided I wouldn’t yell at anyone for breaking anything accidentally because I’m not my father.”
“I fell asleep. If you’re one of my father's friends, kindly leave me alone.”
He found himself shuddering at the impulsiveness of the thought - so
Draco wrinkled his nose at that. “Didn’t you promise you’d make me food?” He said instead of addressing his disdain for being compared to Granger.
“Okay, okay. Don’t give me that look.”
Emerson
“Well… I don’t really
"Draco? Are you alright?"
She clicked her tongue in irritation.“You’re no fun.”
“If you would, darling.”
“No! Draco!” Harry struggled against the bubbling laughter.
Harry's been saying this for a week, and Draco is, for some reason - relenting. Or at least he isn't protesting. He can feel his feet move forward and his hand in Harry's pocket. It's warm, smooth from what he can feel through his gloves. He wants to feel it wrapped around his waist, like it was in the hall that night.
The tree had grown since his antics in 5th year and he had found, quite by accident, that he could no longer jump to the floor.
“Wait, so he’s only had one disaster today?” Hermione decided she could corner him about getting a filing tray some other time. “He’s drinking, we have to do something before he makes a complete fool of himself.”
Harry almost hit his head against the cupboard door as he watched the join in the pipes repair itself with such efficiency that he’d have thought he was just delirious - if not for his wet knees.
“Draco, darling, how are you?”
Draco, while bouncing on his heels from excitement, looked at Harry like he’d won the lottery—trying to communicate how much he didn’t need his approval, and also how much he did.
“Draco’s going to kill me.” Harry eventually said into his cordial.
“Thanks Harry.” Hermione smiled as she Ever since the legislation of stricter wand policy, Hermione had decided to, in her words, live better. Most of which involved putting her wand in the cupboard upstairs for allotted periods of time.
“Yes.” The word was low, barely a breath.
”The bookmark.” Draco said, far too quickly - as the image of Harry bending him over the table he was currently sat at flitted unhelpfully through his mind.
“Head Auror Robards, then.” He focused on the eye, noting specifics before grabbing his wand. He watched Robards flinch and felt a tendril of guilt leap from his stomach. “You didn’t answer my question. What are you doing in the Department of Mysteries? Are you lost?”
“I also couldn’t find cake, so you’ll have to make do with transfigured, slightly over buttered crumpets.” He cleared their plates and whisked two more in from the back room labelled
Damn Harry through the veil and back.  Saviour or not he was still
“Could you not shut up for two seconds?” Draco hissed.
"Harry now is it?" Lucius looked as though he'd sucked on a lemon. Just thinking about it made Draco want to laugh.
“Wait, what?”
Draco put his head in his hands. He couldn't stand to look at anyone's concerned faces, especially not in the current circumstances. He knew his workmates all acted like buddies - going to the pub, asking each other round for curry - but really, this was bordering on unprofessional.
"You don't look like you're too fond of him, or me." The man laughed a little as Draco fought to school his features into something other than a frown. "Would you like a drink?"
He didn’t mention Ron or Hermione as Harry laughed, instead he watched patiently as Harry struggled with the buttons on his shirt.
They were almost nose to nose. “Potter.” Draco nodded curtly. “The minister wants to see you.”
He flooed okay. If you'd classify okay as getting chimney soot all over the knotted wooden floor and then knocking half of the floo powder into the knolls for good measure. And that was when he noticed Mr. Malfoy strolling through the hallway.
The last ten months really had tested their relationship, he’d joked once that he hoped it would all be worth it. But, as he turned away from the shining lights outside and back to the empty portion of his bed, he realised it would. If only so he could have Draco back beside him.
“But when you do it 100 points to Gryffindor.” Draco mimicked Dumbledore’s accent, badly, as he pushed his tea away to rest his head on the table.
He didn’t ask for help, but Harry wasn’t quite
“...because of all your privately funded orphanages I know.” Harry rolled his eyes but he smiled a little, pushing his glasses up his nose. “And before you say anything I know it was you because your fathers an arsehole and he’s the only one who lives anywhere near you who has a rivalling amount of money. I don’t want you to think I was snooping that one time I brought you Chinese food.”
“I don’t squeak.”
Pansy let the various powders to soak up whatever they could find and clasped her tea in two hands.
Harry was almost bouncing on the balls of his feet as Draco struggled into a shirt, his arms flailing slightly.
“Honestly.” Draco tapped the counter as he waited for the kettle—the longest three minutes of his life. “Does she think I’m incompetent without a wand in my hand?”
He craned his neck, looking back at the photograph of his husband and his friends, Hermione’s head thrown back in unashamed laughter.
to see him.
"Maybe if I looked more like sodding Harry Potter the general public would like me better." He mumbled, slipping, quite literally into a bar stool. He was about to put his fingers up to request a drink when he felt someone shift into the seat beside him.
She was working as Shacklebolt's secretary part time "just until the business gets off the ground". Surprisingly, Draco learned, the business venture was in fact, carpentry. "I know," Luna shook her head as she meandered through mostly deserted hallways, Draco trailing behind her like a dejected puppy, "everyone seems to think I should be off travelling the world, or planting flowers or something but I just don't see it."
He cracked an eye open. “Do you mind?” He
Bass thrummed under his feet and up through his bones whilst glaring white strobe-lights blinked in and out of focus overhead. Draco assumed they were supposed to mimic some sort of shooting star but he couldn't tell, and he wasn't about to risk his perfectly good eyesight in order to find out.
Draco turned around slowly, taking Harry in. His thick rumpled hair, his glasses-less eyes wide and green and beautiful against the warm beige of his skin. He stepped forward, to take a closer look, he told himself firmly.
one at a time as if the fantasy of it all would disintegrate if he spoke too loud, turning to Harry for confirmation.
Even with all the planning and double checking, things were bound to go wrong. Harry had mumbled this to Draco in a number of soothing tones as his financé stressed over timing, even though they both knew with an absolute certainty Draco was going to be
“It’s not exactly intentional. Sir. But if you haven’t noticed, we don’thave access to anything better than those.” Harry jerked his thumb in a general backwards direction, even though his glasses were half buried in ash. “Now, since I can’t see, can I go off field?” Harry bit the inside of his cheek to stop himself from grinning. He couldn’t see Robards’ face but he could guess it wasn’t amused.
Harry ducked, cheering triumphantly as it hit the floor with a deflated
“I’ve missed you.” Harry said softly, fog misting out of his mouth as he slipped the ring onto Draco’s finger, barely looking at his knuckles. Instead he counted all the shades of grey in Draco’s eyes as snow shook down from the trees.
“Draco, what the fuck.”
Hermione looked pained as she slammed the book shut. “I can’t tell him.”
“I model my work on Halstead.” He said softly.
“Okay, good, now, is this bit tende-”
A hush fell over the room as multiple pairs of eyes swivelled towards the sound of broken crockery.
“...ask.”
to him constantly.
“I’m seeing stars.” He said to no one in particular.
“Not all of your bookshelves. One.”
“Are you just being vain or are you genuinely interested?” Draco’s eyebrow rose, unconvincingly from where he lay in the leaves.
- that he made the decision to wait it out, settling his back against the curve of the tree, feeling the rough edges of the bark digging into his shirt. His warming charm was bad, dipping in and out, but it was more than nothing, a cocoon against the cool breeze.
Harry hadn't intentionally bumped into Draco, well, anywhere. But they kept running into each other; The Three Broomsticks, Diagon Alley... they'd even met once at a Swish and Flick concert. Although Harry wasn't quite sure how much of that had been an accident, on Draco's part. Harry had described Draco as "not as bad as he was in sixth year" and that was all he'd really told anyone - predictably, it had made the headlines anyway.
They’d been going back and forth on the issue for long enough that they were both getting progressively more annoyed with the other.
"Morning, Potter." Draco mumbled, deciding it was probably best to hide his blush in the bed sheets if the man ever bloody woke.
That was another matter altogether.
“I was supposed to write a speech?!” Harry looked panicked now. “It’s okay, I can improvise!”
He wasn’t sure what he was defending - looking at Harry laugh, the crinkles he got around his eyes, the dimple that popped deeply from his left cheek, he didn’t care.
sound.
"Harry will what now?"
“How-”
“You need to go to bed.”
Draco shrugged, as much as he could with one shoulder pressed into the mattress.
At the time it had seemed like a non-issue, he wasn’t going to waste his valuable sleep on righting all the shoes if he was just going to knock them back down again six times.
Including Harry coming there most nights instead of going back to Grimmauld Place. Sometimes popping in in the morning too, if he could.
While Harry went to the bathroom Draco took stock of the living room. A photo of him was perched on the corner of the bookcase. He was laughing about something over wine at the pub with Pansy. He left the sofa, walking over to see it better.
“Everyone, Look! It’s my husband!”
Well, that was unhelpful.
And Andromeda was sick. What had started off as a chesty cough became worse as the days went on. She was cold too, in no fit state to keep a child around. At the start Harry - and later Draco - had made abundant trips, separately at first, before ending up having friendly chats at Andy's door while delivering soup (Draco) or helping with a phone installation (Harry).
“Not always. We’re comfortable enough to be able to gently rib each other. I do it to Ron too, usually whenever he tries to tell me that a cheese toasty is a balanced diet.”
“Pans’!” Draco called to her retreating back.
In lieu of an answer, Draco yawned, flipped over and grabbed the pillow from behind his head, tossing it in the general direction of the owner of the voice. "Go away!"
?” Ron was so shocked it seemed he’d forgotten to call the man Malfoy for the first time in his life. “I thought your frantic scrambling was about the Black portrait.”
She stopped herself as Draco glared at her, shaking his head.
Potter in a cupboard with him?
The beach house was pleasent, ignoring the air of forgotten Grandma the decor seemed to suggest. The bay windows opened wide, out to the foaming waves, and the sea air blew in from the rocky coves, hanging low and salty in the air. Draco found himself turning to Narcissa, who immoderately set her newspaper in her lap, laying her hands daintily atop the image moving atop the front page.
“Shut up I wasn’t finished on my soap box.” Draco pulled his hands over his face in order to stifle his giggles.
”He and I are going out tomorrow morning, I know you probably want a lie in. You might need it.”
“Make sure you wash your hands before coming back in here!”
It was almost a race to Harry’s table as Draco wove his way through the crowds.
So he sat back, letting Draco gather his thoughts again, and waited.
“What is?”
Released from his parents hold unexpectedly, he'd spiralled. Quite dramatically, too, if he might add. His mother had begged for him to come with them, of course, as soon as his father came out of Azkaban. He'd stoutly refused the offer. Even a portkey to France would be too much time trapped in a small space with Lucius these days.
“He was an inventor. Muggle-Born, not that it matters.” Draco rolled over to face Harry, who was watching him intensely.
"And what about when you get back?"
“I already want to die of shame and I’ve been here five minutes.”
“That was one time! And besides, he hates me. Wait, I what?”
Merlin, it was like the start to a bad porn.
The Prophet have had a lot  to say on the matter, as per usual, but neither of them have taken to reading the Prophet since Skeeter's eminent collapse. Draco focuses on the blanket. It's a deep jade green, hints of his own lemongrass cologne lacing in with Harry's signature smell.
The clock chimed six-thirty and Draco cursed Harry’s timekeeping as he was left to enjoy his-
Harry fiddled with the black handkerchief in his breast pocket as everyone else turned to watch Draco.
“You People?” Draco breathed out of his nose heavily, the only audible noise other than their footfalls. “Taking a leaf out of Robards book are we?”
He said the names softly, then the letters,
“Just need to fix the near-response. Your cornea should then work better.”
“It says here that it’s a mild form of a control spell. Something with the power to cause
"You've also got a stupid name, for the record." God, Draco needed to learn to shut up. "I also don't plan on marrying you."
But now, like this, he looked forward to it all, the good and the bad. Most of all he looked forward to Draco being happy. He looked forward to being alive to see it happen.
Draco threw his arms around Harry as Harry struggled to maintain his balance.
“Oh! But wasn’t he supposed to do that impassioned speech about war orphans?” Her dark lipsticked mouth quirked upwards as she crossed her ankles, her hands sliding seamlessly into her trouser pockets.
”I’ve been grumpy all day.” Draco gave Harry a weak smile.
He didn’t prod further. Anything pertaining to the war was shaky ground for the both of them, he knew that more than anything.
Draco was seated at the kitchen table, his hands shaking around a warm mug of tea. It had been hot but for the last ten minutes it had remained untouched, being slowly cooled by the roaring wind that was coming through the cracks in a window pane.
“I can see.” Harry snorted. Although he didn’t comment, Draco couldn’t help but notice the way the man pushed his own glasses further up his nose.
“It’s not pity. It’s humanity. Punching you once was satisfying enough. Don’t make me do it again.”
“What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.” Draco didn’t even look up as he placed the eye in a stable mix of solutions on his desk. His notes were stacked neatly, at least an inch thick with information crammed onto the pages as if he’d run out of paper.
“I was half expecting you to try to come to my rescue again.”
Draco, as the tallest, was pulling glasses down from the kitchen cabinet and handing them one at a time to Hermione.
”Yes.” He didn’t elaborate.
“You ordered yourself pizza? Or did you get one for me too?”
Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second before deciding to stand, leaning over the table in order to place a hesitant kiss at Draco’s temple. “Sorry.”
The piano in corner of their living room is their only witness.
Harry rubbed his knuckles along the table, back and forth. “I thought I was just being clumsy.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “What did you do then? You wouldn’t shut me in a cupboard if you didn’t do something.”
“Do you want to stay like this?”
just for you to tell me to use a Muggle solvent?” Harry spoke slowly, deliberately trying to keep his tone even.
“I’m so tired the days have sort of blended together.”
He stared at the shoes and the stain underneath with loathing. The colours weren’t that different - it was a black floor after all - but Harry was quite a bit closer to it than he had been in previous months and he could see where the stain of the wood had chipped away and how the glue-like substance of the sticking charm had clung to the shoes, almost a perfect black outline against the tobacco coloured wood.
Harry grabbed the blankets, the knot in his chest tightening as he yelled through the house; “Have either of you seen my shoes!”
Hermione, at least, had the decency to let her hand fly to her mouth. “Oh Harry!”
“You owe me Malfoy.”
He watched with a mix of horror and fascination as the eye rolled over itself, leaving a slug like trail around the lip of his desk before teetering on the edge. He made a grab for it and missed, the eye plummeting to the floor with barely a sound.
“I can sleep all the time now I’ve been fired.” Draco grumbled.
A splash of purple liquid fell onto Draco's shoe as he spun one hundred and eighty degrees in the bar stool to watch his companion leave.
“I can-” Draco fell silent as Harry glared at him.
Hardy stepped towards him and Draco turned away. “I can only do so much physical contact…”
“Quidditch.” Harry lied, thinking about how he had been caught sneaking onto the training ground on his lunch hour. Why am I in a broom cupboard?” If it were anyone else Harry would have jumped on the defensive but Draco, while clean, wasn’t in any fit state to kidnap him. He had dark circles under his eyes, almost purple in the low light coming from the single candle-case hanging from the ceiling. “Don’t you ever get any sleep?”
Draco rolled over and for a single, terrible moment, he was back in his parents bed with a man he didn't know, who had a wife.
It was Draco's turn to quirk an eyebrow. He and his mother were playing such a petty game but it was better than airing their dirty laundry to the neighbours. Neither of them were ones for shouting; Lucius did quite enough shouting for the both of them.
“I got you veggie pineapple.” He leant up to kiss Harry on the nose before adding,
“What…” for a second Harry was thrown, swallowing as he looked down at Draco’s mussed fringe and spiderweb eyelids.
It was the first time Harry had said his name.
And with that Draco was swept up into Harry's arms, in an embrace that he couldn't describe if he tried. All he knew was he didnt want to let go.
“Oh my god, we’re late, how are we late!” Harry couldn’t tell whether it was Molly or Hermione who had spoken, amid the hustle and bustle of already assembled guests.
Draco brought his mother flowers every Sunday and cleaned her countertops when she didn’t have the energy to haul herself into the kitchen. He’d use the killing curse if it meant keeping Narcissa Malfoy safe.
"Uncle Draco taught me a word."
"So," Draco unpopped the cork of what was now his wine. He listened as it made a satisfying whistling noise, the trapped air finally set free. "you're free to criticise... after my fourth glass." He kept his eyes locked on his father's as he poured himself a generous amount of wine.
“I fixed your kettle by the way. It was one of the wires. You know.” He rotated his hand in a lazy arc, “Electricity and magic”.
“-two and a half minutes ago.”
"Fancy. What's the occasion?" Draco tried his hardest to look disinterested but it was hard to feign disinterest while staring directly at the way a piece of fabric joins over one's shoulders.
"Lark Finchham. You have to be kidding me." Fucking birds."
“And one egg, four slices of bacon, two rounds of toast and a cup of water?”
Harry swore before putting his fork down. “I thought no one saw that.”
Amusement danced in Harry’s eyes as Draco shifted his weight onto his elbows, interlacing his delicate fingers before resting his chin neatly between his knuckles.
“You have my dead teacher’s eye? That’s what you’re experimenting on?”
Harry had ended up on the sofa again. This time lying down. Draco was kneeling over him, all talk of numbing and slight twitchiness.
“Robes?” Harry snorted. “You don’t mean shoes?”
Draco ignored it, instead settling back on his haunches. “You don’t seem as excited as you should be.” It came out as a question.
“Please go and tell Harry I would like to see him.”
“Do you just want an extra five minutes in bed?”
misses the piano's jutting edge; hands splayed to save himself, he doesn't think.
He couldn't tell whether it had happened when he'd pulled it out of his closet this morning or earlier in the night, all he knew was there was no button on the floor, and he only knew that because his head was on the table, eyes glaring straight down at the clean slabs of stone beneath his rickety wooden chair.
“I know.” Harry smiled into Draco’s neck as he buried his face inbetween his collar.
It took Harry all of two minutes to deliberate between a bacon roll and the egg salad. He pushed his tray onto the cramped table next to Ron. “Where’s ‘Mione?”
Narcissa wiped her eyes with the tip of a handkerchief while Ron and Hermione clasped hands.
“Hermione! Do you have so little faith in me that-”
“Yes. You don’t have to ask.”
“Harry’s lost his voice.” Draco laughed easily, “so I’m going to be doing most of the talking tonight.”
He could see Luna's shoes from where he was lying against the table. They were small and brown, Mary Janes, he thought they were called. He couldn't really care less. Especially as they'd been offset with some garish striped tights in some shade of traffic-cone orange.
The owls, the wind, Harry sneezing.
”If you want to look like Professor McGonagall, I’m not going to stop you.”
“I’m coming with you to get them though.” It wasn’t a question.
The silence was too much. “Do you believe wands are offensive weapons?” The question came from nowhere but Harry needed to know. Once again, like a lot of things with Draco these days, what he got was not what he expected.
“At least Shacklebolt gave me the weekend off!”
“Oculus Reparo.” this one did nothing but shock Harry’s fingers, his wand wavering as he tried to concentrate on the now blurry foreground that was his hand. Another explosion hit a rock a few metres away and Harry dropped his already mangled glasses into the dirt so he could roll into a ball. “Shit.”
For the most part, he was thankful to have the manor to himself. The only thing that had really changed was the House Elf Tax, but he had enough money to cover that. Provided he pretended to shake Potter's hand in solidarity - discretely washing it quite vigorously afterwards - and as long as he didn't overdo it at Ministry functions.
He sat down with a casual “Hey, babe.” that probably sounded more like a strangled cat. “I’m not your husband.” He felt his heart keen against his chest as Harry’s face visibly dropped.
to say is I’ve, uh-” Harry, once again, faltered. He felt the heat rise in his cheeks, and although he knew the others couldn’t see it, it didn’t make it any less embarrassing while it was happening. “I accidentally stuck Draco’s shoes to the floor.”
, Draco’s useless brain supplied.
“And the bookshelf?” He asked, almost in disbelief that he wasn’t about to be at the very least lightly scolded for such a mishap. Even if it wasn’t really a
Pansy and Ginny sat together while Luna moved to the back, trailing something long and pink in her wake.
"I'm sorry I'm reshaping  your blanket." The blanket rises in the air and Harry sees the evident join in the fabric, the way the two shades of green don't quite match up. His face breaks into a smile as he watches Draco's delicate fingers weave stuttering patterns in the air, the knitting needles in front of his face following suit.
They were in a huddle near the floo, where quite a large wizard was attempting to squeeze himself into the space available.
Draco turned back around as if she’d physically taken hold of his shirt and pulled him. “So, what’s all this about?” She nodded to the door Harry had left through, a delicate eyebrow arching upwards.
Draco shut the door to their bedroom and made his way down to the kitchen, humming softly, only to be revolted by himself when he realised it was Celestina Warbeck’s
“The more you talk the more you sound like a dictionary.” Harry levitated a plate of chips over from where they sat at the end of the bar under a hand drawn sign labelled:
Draco laughed before proceeding to nudge himself in between Harry’s knees. “Lie down.”
Draco quirked an eyebrow, clearly amused. He didn't even wear cloaks to the office, hated them so much, in fact that he'd rather get formally reprimanded for dress code every time rather than just... come in in work robes. Honestly. The nerve of him.
“Why do you put up with me?”
When Harry was finally able to think again he remembered Kingsley. “Shaklebolt called the house phone by the way. It was along the lines of Robards being put on permanent suspension?”
“Quite possibly”.
"I know. I can't bring myself-"
“Because he acts like a dad?” Ron pointed out.
Harry looked at Draco’s perpetually tired eyes and still-frazzled hair and decided it might be a good idea for him to stay somewhere where he might actually sleep.
“Accio broom.” He called into the night, to no avail. Even so, he kept his hand outstretched for a couple of minutes, in a bleak sort of hope. A damning hope that he carried with him always.
“If you weren’t such a good Hit Wizard those eyes would be your downfall.” Robards’ was talking to Harry’s back. By the end of his sentence Harry was across the grass and ripping a hole in the charm against the door.
“I’d feel awkward if you did.”
“Sure you aren’t. You just climbed a tree to watch Potter for no reason in fifth year.” Pansy wasn’t even looking at him as her bob fell forward, concentrating wholeheartedly on fingerprint-dusting. “And you waxed lyrical about him for two hours in the pub.”
"Are you getting on with my House Elves, Draco?"
"At least it can't get any worse." Draco whispered to himself as he vanished the soot and righted the floo powder. He decided to re-tie his shoe the Muggle way, whether it was to avoid looking his father in the eye or to piss him off, he hadn't quite decided yet.
“Do you ever feel,” he waved his hand in a circular motion, as if that was going to ever replace what he was trying to convey. “Odd.”
“Do you trust me, Harry?”
Harry snorted, not quietly enough, apparently, because Draco moved his head towards the armchair to shoot him a glare, lips pursed in a frown.
"Are you always going to be so smart when someone shows you genuine emotional connection?” Harry waved a hand dismissively, he wasn’t about to get into all that now. “Would you like me to prove it to you?" Harry's eyes searched Draco's face when he shrugged. Whatever he found there was obviously enough, because not a minute later, a brown hand was cupping Draco's chin, thumb and forefinger resting either side of his cheeks in a delicate bowl.
"Sorry." The voice strained over the sound of the music. "Did you say Harry Potter?"
Harry bends to kiss his boyfriend's forehead. "I love you."
It wasn’t completely empty, but everything of importance had gone.
Harry interlocked their fingers as Draco traced the light scarring on the back of his hands. “Together?” he supplied absentmindedly.
wouldn’t keep tripping over it - But, evidently, it didn’t work.” He briefly removed his hands from his face to gesture the still stuck shoes.
Hermione and Ron (after some sharp words from his wife) went to help, joined quickly by Hannah Abbot and Ernie McMillon.
He’d been relegated to the back office where, officially, he’d been filing paperwork. In reality he’d been making paper aeroplanes while waiting for his new glasses to come in. They’d arrived on his desk at ten to two that afternoon and he’d barely shut up about being able to see again before Hermione had brought up the wand conversation.
“Oh!” Draco’s brain caught up with his heart as he closed his eyes.
“No need for that, now.” Arthur’s voice cracked as he swept Harry up into a hug that was just as tight as Molly’s had been.
Harry came back to Draco staring at his bookshelf. He flushed.
He lit another cigarette, having barely let the first drop to the pavement as he ground the butt in with his heel, grimacing at the ash residue the wind insisted on imparting up the back of his shoe.
Ron nodded, confused but supportive. But it was Draco who asked, “can you speak Mermish?” The tension was thick enough to put a knife through.
Or it had been.
“Whatever, Draco.” Harry grabbed his hand underneath the covers, lightly tracing patterns over his knuckles. “As long as you come with me to get new frames fitted. Skeeter will have a fit if she sees me walking around without them.”
He’d said friendship, but it wasn’t really. Not in the conventional sense anyway.
Harry made a face at Draco’s back as he yanked another gold-flaking door open. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?” He gasped.
Draco thought, reaching out to swipe the cutlery away from the boy before he started playing drums on the counter-top.
He hated his boss for a lot of reasons but trying to tamper with staff space was out of the question. The war had wreaked havoc on the inside of the Ministry, turning a team against each other was a Death Eater tactic and Harry wanted no part in it.
"You're not even married anymore!"
“I didn’t think to question what I’d been taught when I should have and instead I stood my ground - I clung to what I knew like a raft.”
Harry quirked an eyebrow as Draco blushed.
“Why does everyone keep saying that.”
Draco was a lot of things. He was intelligent. He laughed loudly. He was oddly chivalrous when he was trying not to impress people he hated. Draco was a full, realised person, all sharp edges and fine lines.
“I’m interested because you’re interested.”
Harry crossed the room so he could lean his head on Draco’s shoulder, kissing his neck intermittently. “I mean it. You look good in everything. Including-” He’d started popping the buttons of Draco’s suit jacket before Draco yelped.
”Why are
“Stuck.” Harry’s eyes glinted with mirth in the low light.
He plumped for running his fingers over the raised surface of the spines as he put it all together: the first letters of the last names screaming at him to understand, although by his smile, he felt like he already did.
Harry angled his face towards the pinpricks of light. “The centaurs have a hell of a job. I wouldn’t know where to begin.”
“Sorry.” Draco didn’t sound sorry at all as he moved, standing up only to immediately sit back down again.
Breathing more slowly he tried again. “You’re offering me a solution. I'm not just going to walk away from that. I considered it and the pros outweigh the cons.”
“You know
Draco glared at the glass cabinet full of wands before moving to switch the kettle on in the small ‘tea room’ off to the side of the lab.
“Sorry ‘Mione I have to go, promised the lads I’d meet them at the pub.”
It turned out it wasn’t so much a knob as it was a crank. A small hand crank jutting out from the side of the table, hidden only by the wide tabletop.
anywhere, if that’s what you mean.”
He thought he’d done a rather remarkable job of schooling his face into something that resembled outrage at being interrupted while pretending to read.
“Yes.” Harry said firmly before wrapping his arms around Draco, assuring himself again that this was real. ”I’m glad I didn’t scare you off with... everything.”
“I like you.” He looked up, counting the flecks of gold in Draco’s otherwise grey eyes.
“Floo call to 12 Grimmauld Place, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry found Draco draped over a statue of the French president - in France - at the foot of an out of date portkey, with drool dripping steadily onto the path beneath him.
“Hey! Ow.” Harry shook his head so his curls fell back over Draco’s fingers. “What are you doing anyway? You’re not a healer.”
Draco peered over her shoulder as she read him the passages.
"Will-will you..." Harry stumbles over his words as he reaches his hands back from the piano, aware of the eyes on his back, Draco whines at the sudden loss of warmth.
His leg was slung over the side of the sofa as Draco slid in between Harry’s limbs, moving his eyelids with gentle thumb pads.
A bird overhead sqwarked, darting in and out of the trees and bushes leading up the front path. Harry tracked it's movements for a while, while Draco tracked Harry's.
“And if it doesn’t work? If I render your best Hit Wizard blind?” Draco almost spat the words, refusing to come in, to sit down, to have a glass of water, Draco, please.
It snowed the night before the wedding, fat white flakes skimming the windows to settle on already heavily laden windowsills across the country. But Harry wasn’t bitter, not at all, in fact, they’d gotten a floo call about it a month before - the venue manager asking if they’d like a
She placed the sleep potion on the table before walking back into the living room, leaving Draco clutching the tiny bottle like it would save his life.
dense. He pulled the hem of Draco’s shirt down an inch and suddenly it was okay again.
“Who’s Halsted?” Harry asked, his head propped up on his knuckles.
”It rings true doesn’t it?” Harry smiled as Draco pushed his face into a pillow.
“My broom’s in the broom shed, we locked them up last night and no, I’m not sneaking around because I have the key. I don’t.”
He’d been so smug about it.
Draco moved on. He knew there was nothing he could do to make up for the past. The best thing he could do was this.
Before Draco could scramble back, let alone move his foot the branch broke completely. The thump was solid and Draco peered over the edge of the foliage to where the dead branch lay, disturbing the already browning leaves below.
Harry just smiled up at him, his eyes crinkling at the corners.
"Nonsense. The manors bigger."
Since they’d started this - whatever
Harry made his way over to the buffet table as Draco started improvising - and quite well, at that - about the war and suffering and building community. It actually sounded quite earnest and Harry would have listened if it concerned him at all, but he was currently fighting with a tablecloth.
“I really am screwed, if
Draco snuggles under the blanket, feet tucked into the ends. He lays in Harry's lap, as Harry runs his fingers through Draco's blonde hair, watching this years snowfall come down.
“Why do
His eyes flickered to Harry’s stomach, his shoulders, his cheekbones. He was going to
“His eyes.” Draco whispered. Almost as if he were sharing a secret.
Harry blushed, his eyes finding a particularly interesting tile to focus on. “They erected it ages ago - I did ask Shacklebolt to have it taken down but he thought it was the funniest thing in the world. I still can’t quite believe I have to walk past a seven foot carving of my own face every morning. It’s ridiculous.”
Draco opened his mouth but then closed it again.
“Two days.” Harry sighed miserably. “I don’t know why he puts up with it all; I spelled his grey robes pink the day he was due to Portkey there.”
”The opposite, I think.”
Draco knew very well that they didn’t mix,
Draco closed the book he was reading as slowly as he could manage without looking undignified.
With Draco's needles settled, Molly turns to greet Harry. She's warm and friendly, although there's barely a force in her voice that he can't quite detect. It's a strange sight, Draco Malfoy curled up on Molly Weasley's cushy armchair. A sight of domesticity that he never thought he'd see.
He emerged from the wine cellar a minute later clutching a rich, red Beaudoux. Clutching probably wasn't right, more like cradling. The wine crooked at an angle under one slender pale arm as he moved stealthily over to the glass cabinet in the corner of the room, prising a glass from the exact middle of the shelf.
Now I’ll go make you a cup of tea. Stay here; we can talk through options when you’ve had something to drink.”
“He’s Harry now is he?” Pansy rolled her eyes fondly. “He wasn’t Harry before. What changed?” She kicked him playfully under the table.
The tree stood, still and tall in the waning light, its leaves moving from time to time with the steady breeze. Draco had taken to watching the sunset more, the sky open and free above him as he picked bits of foliage from the branches. He’d been doing it since first year and had never really found a good time to stop.
He shook his head. He wouldn’t think of a that
“You’re not a Muggle.” Draco kissed Harry on the shoulder before asking him to move out of the way of the sink. “Reparo.”
“All of them?” Draco’s eyebrows disappeared to his hairline as he imagined the disarray of a multiple shelf pile up, blinking in surprise at the small, silent grief he felt for torn spines.
“Charm troubles?” Hermione levitated her shopping onto the counter so she could put her hands - balled into determined fists - on her hips. “Is that a euphemism?”
“Do you want to get drunk?”
“I’m sorry Potter, but upon finding my desk looking like a jack-in-a-box my first inclination is not to wind it up.” He sniffed. Clowns were not his strong suit. “They’re creepy.”
“Have you ever looked at someone and not seen a grey blob?” Draco replied as he mixed something wet and slimy into an unappetising substance to his right.
“It’s different when you love someone.”
Now, Harry thought back to their living room. The disarray of robes and RSVP’s, the dress shoes that should have been by the door but had ended up in a box underneath the adjustable shelf and, of course, the blasted wedding checklist flung haphazardly down on the coffee table.
"Of course not, I was merely waiting to be allowed into the parlour. Of course, that's if you trust me near your wine cellar."
“Understandable.” Harry sat down. “Are you still talking about Robards? Because if he tries to claim you’ve been fired, sue him.”
Ron nodded to the back of the hall where the Level Fours usually sat, his freckles shifting from red to blonde under the sunlight streaming from the windows. Hermione, indeed, sat with them, instead of with the Level Sixes like she usually did.
”I said I was sorry last night!”
“So did everyone else.”
Harry laughed, the sound cutting through the still night, Draco laughing with him, shoulders shaking heartilly until he fell from the tree.
“Because Harry is the best at what he does.” Kingsley held up a hand. “I would want nothing less than the best for him. That’s where you come in.”
“You said you’d be home early, so I ordered pizza. It should be here in about five minutes.”
Draco resolved that he definitely wouldn’t be building anything for anyone, especially Harry Potter.
God, he’d hated Divination.
Harry’s eyes were shining as he tried to concentrate on the book Hermione had open on the kitchen table.
giving me advice.” Harry continued, nodding to Ron.
Draco took a long swig of his vodka almost as soon as it was put down on the beer mat. He pretended with all the aloofness of an angry swan that his sleeve wasn't dampening from the small puddle of un-mopped alcohol that had spilled onto the beer mat. Especially as he was ninety percent sure he hadn't spilled his own drink yet.
“I guess I always knew people were different but I didn’t really question any of it. The rich were born rich and the poor were born poor, that was just how the world worked. I didn’t realise anyone believed otherwise, I didn’t understand why they would. So when the war broke out I was just... mainly confused.”
He thought he saw Hermione but when he looked back up there was just Draco, standing on the pavement - alone.
It wasn’t the eye’s fault - not exactly. It had been encased in bronze when it was brought to him, stuck fast into a round, firm seal - like a ring. The casing had been tight, cold and hard on his fingers as he tried to wedge them in between the cracks. He would have worn gloves, had the job not been what it was.
Everything was fuzzy around the edges, if he squinted a bit he could almost, almost pretend Lark actually did wear glasses after all.
Draco spelled a blanket from the basket by the church door as snow began to swirl more thickly around them, leaving it to drape itself over Harry’s shoulders. “To have and to hold…”
Of course, it had a few wards, but they'd been coming to Brittany since Draco was four, and Narcissa had only made this her permanent residence after Draco had turned eighteen. He knew the wards inside out, which was lucky considering he wouldn't put it past his father to do such a thing.
Harry’s eyes shone with wonderment, as if it was the first time he was seeing snow and not the hundreth.
“I can sleep whenever I want, thank you very much.”
So much that after five minutes Draco stopped, swinging around on his toes so fast that Harry almost barrelled into him.
“I never really apologized for that, did I?”
While not unflattering in of itself, it would be different if it were Ron, or even
’ was definitely lying.” Harry was sat on the toilet lid as Draco sponged his dress shirt quite vigorously with a wet cloth.
If they weren’t the Celebrity Couple the people wanted, the Prophet would definitely let them know. Draco cringed as a camera went off somewhere to his right, making a mental note to apologise to Ginny at some point - this was definitely harder than she’d made it look.
“Now, can we get on with unravelling the mystery of my dress shoes?”
“You made this?” Harry said in a whisper. “How?”
“My what?”
Harry felt like he should be uncomfortable about this tenuous friendship - a bridge formed by a mutual hatred of authority, while simultaneously needing a job.
Shacklebolt’s eyebrows shot up.
“That’s it.” Draco announced. “As soon as we leave I’m going to force you to watch me make this Sight Solution. I’ll get it right this time.”
The thought wasn't quite a memory. It was a warped version of what used to happen at restaurants. And balls. And weddings. He decided it was probably safer to start retching after he'd consumed some alcohol, instead of before. It was far too soon in the night for all that, regardless of how dark the club was.
"Potter." Draco nods stiffly, but he continues to play. As if Harry's hands aren't currently covering his own, as if the warmth doesn't send such a shock through his body that he almost trips on the chorus.
He remembered Draco at the hearth, shaking floo powder and soot from his unpressed trousers.
Harry made his way over to the bed, yawning a little as he sat down, taking off his shirt more smoothly than he had in the last week.
Harry turned around too quickly, almost knocking himself out on a cupboard. “You think? Everything you ever do is illegal.”
“Oh.” Draco hesitated. “Is that all you want me for? Because if I misread anything…” he stepped away, hands clasped at his front.
“Are we?” The question was loaded. Unintentional.
Harry was still tying his shoelaces, not bothering to look up as he spoke. “If that’s the Prophet tell them to bugger off.”
“I was gone for five days and you’ve managed to destroy most of downstairs.” It wasn’t a question, Draco’s lips quirked in the approximation of a smile as Harry tried to pretend he was busy fixing the sink.
“So, what’s all that about?” Ron nodded to the crumpled piece of paper that Harry had just about managed to spell clean after he’d spilled his beer over it.
“Romilda slipped me some from under the counter. Don’t look at me like that, it’s chicken not a substance charm.”
“Why do
“Because I don’t know what you are building. You say you have the eye but how do I know that? How do I know you aren’t leading me around so you can kill me?” He hadn’t really thought about it before voicing it but now it was a very sudden reality.
“Hermione told me I might have to wait because of, well, everything. But I think I’ve waited long enough. I know it’s terrible etiquette to do this while you’re eating but I’m just really nervous and I hate keeping secrets from you even though it’s not really a secret anymore.” He laughed.
“You talk too much. Ask too many questions.” Draco was sounding it out slowly, as if he was reading from a baby book.
“Okay, I’ll bite. What was it this time?”
“That’s rubbing alcohol. Acetone has different components.”
“If I told you it wouldn’t be a mystery.” Draco rolled his eyes before yawning. “I was tired, Potter. I’ve been awake since four trying to perfect that.”
Draco was sure Lucius was trying for something cunning, but since Draco didn't know what it was, he just nodded.
Pansy groaned. “You’re even starting to sound like him. What happened to manners, Malfoy.”
“Parchment, Draco. It’s the thing I’m currently testing for fingerprints because you’re not only bizarre, but possibly paranoid.” Pansy held up the yellowing paper as if it were irrefutable proof that everything she said was true. “Shaklebolt wouldn’t fire you he’s like… weirdly nice to you.”
“My world has always been very black and white.” Harry said after a moment of silence. “There are good people and there are bad people.”
Harry lifted his newly mangled glasses from the dirt, carrying them between his thumb and forefinger as he inched himself off the field. An explosion sounded as he crouched behind a rock to fiddle with his glasses in peace.
He pushed it away, focusing on the curl gently pressing up against his nose instead. “I mean the surgery.”
“Where?”
conversation, is it?”
“I’m not eye-fucking Potter.”
“You have got to leave, right now.” Draco was whispering, his breath hot on Harry’s face as he yanked him into the closet. It smelled clean. Like disinfectant, a lemony smell. Harry, with his messed up uniform and muddy face breathed it in. “Are you even listening to me… you smell like a pigsty what on Earth have you been doing?”
“With you?”
By this point Harry had given up. He pointed at the window, shaking slightly, hiccuping twice as he gulped air back into his lungs.
“You’re upset.” Harry had clocked it at the time Draco had started tapping, he did it when he was frustrated. He’d noticed it when he awoke in Harry’s house, an automatic reaching of his hand to the bedside table. Tap first, wake later.
“Because it’s the least healthy option on the menu or because it contains meat?” Ron asked, tucking into his salad.
Harry looked lost, so, without thinking, Draco grabbed his hand. “There.”
"You think?"
things then?”
Harry focused very hard on trying to swallow.
“Probably finishing off Molly’s pantry instead of ours.”
Draco cracked an eye open, immediately shutting it again as he found himself caught by the sun. “Potter, why are you in my house?”
“Oh.”
Draco had mumbled something back to him, indignation cutting below the halfhearted note in his voice as he tried to seek out Harry’s warmth while simultaneously not moving more than three inches. He didn’t really know whether Harry was talking about his book obsession or their relationship when he’d called Draco unconventional. He wasn’t about to ask now, not this far into… whatever
No wands in the cafeteria. No wands in the paperwork rooms unless they were in a box by the desk. No wands in the Atrium. Offensive weaponry causes terror attacks printed on black metal signs above all the doors. Harry wondered how Draco felt about it before recoiling. No one deserved to feel sorry for that bastard, least of all him.
Admittedly, Harry was much less of an ass when he was spooning bolognese over their spaghetti later in the evening.
Draco turned over reluctantly and was greeted with a kiss on the forehead. “I suppose I’ll be able to squeeze in another invention or two... If you give me enough love.”
“Surprise!” The living room floo spat out green flames as Draco landed neatly on the carpet, brushing his immaculate robes for invisible dust as he did so. “Mon Chou, I’m home.” The name calling had been intentionally sarcastic at first, a nod to Harry’s Cabbage-Patch bedhead, but, as these things do, it had stuck. “Where are you?”
The snow cakes the roofs of the dilapidated houses like icing, settling in Harry's hair in thick layers.  Draco entertains the idea that he looks quite delectable - like an iced bun. He allows a faint smile to quirk over his lips before the icy wind hits his cheeks again. He's cold and wet, feet sinking far into the snowy ground beneath him.
He scoured the very back of the cupboard again, this time with the help of some light and the ability to move things more easily than before. Hidden under the more useless cleaning products, the rubbing alcohol stared him in the face.
"So, Draco, would you like to be walked to your departure spot?"
He didn’t hear the rest of her micro-speech as he grabbed his jacket from where he’d flung it over the back of the kitchen chair, leaving Hermione sour-faced, standing alone in the hallway.
“Sure you don’t have a plaque but everyone with working eyes knows it’s you.”
He could see Harry in his peripheral and he faltered, self-conscious.
“You keep saying that.”
“I don’t know.” Draco did look genuinely confused as he eyed his belongings that had been packed away into the large desk.
Harry beamed, tipping his head up to kiss Draco on the cheek. “I don’t know where I’d be without you.”
“Oh no-” he whispered as the tablecloth disentangled swiftly from his trousers only to end up on the floor: multiple entrees crashing down with it.
The church was to serve as a backdrop.
Harry trips.
“Acetone.” Harry had muttered the same word over and over again as he searched the storage cupboards under the sink, the only difference being the cadence of his voice as he tried to squeeze his long, athletic limbs into the tight space.
"Okay."
While Draco digested the information, Harry picked at the hem of his sweater, eyes flickering back and forth from the slowly unraveling green yarn to Draco’s unrelenting grey eyes.
“Yes Minister. I’ll tell him.” Harry hung up. He walked into the living room in order to tell Draco what he’d just learned but he was struck dumb by the sheer magnitude of Draco’s ideas.
“Does that hurt?”
Harry also hadn't intentionally acquired one metamorphagus in the shape of Teddy Lupin. Andromeda had been shamefaced when she'd handed him over, almost like she'd failed her daughter, although she hadn't done that at all. Even she wasn't proud enough to make Teddy sick.
“Why is it imperative for you to ruin what I’m building?”
“Well, maybe you can fix that for me.”
Draco raised his head, giving her a fleeting smile. "That's be... great actually, Luna. Thank you."
He slipped back into his seat as soon as Draco was standing at the makeshift altar, nodding to Narcissa before he sat.
The word test subject was used a lot, Shacklebolt waving his arms around like an energetic turnstile.
“So, all I’m saying is they could be a little more respectful in regards to such an ancient language.” Hermione looked up expectantly.
“Why?” Harry narrowed his eyes before relaxing. He didn’t want hurt Draco.
Although he would never say it to her face, he could understand why his father had wanted to marry her.
Ron narrowed his eyes and Harry was startingly reminded of Hermione. Since when did Ron become the sensible one! God!
“No or I wouldn’t still be here and you wouldn’t be squeaking in pain.” Draco hissed, pausing to rub his eyes.
was - a number of unconventional things had happened: including Draco buying the shop underneath him outright.
“Pansy said I could have it. She said you wouldn’t mind. I was going to ask you but you were so happy to tell me about your invention that I didn’t get the chance”.
“Oh thank you Pansy for doing me a huge favour even though I don’t see you anymore because I’ve been eye-fucking 600 pieces of parchment and also Harry Potter.”
“I can’t just not do anything until this is lifted. I have a life. Oh god what if Draco proposes and I do something stupid? What if the department make fun of him because he’s with
They’d met up for drinks. That’s how it’d started, a large group of post-war kids with no one to lay their self pity on but each other.
The rest of Ron’s backyard Quidditch team had gone home and it was just him and Harry, the round empty table covered in beer rings and empty packets of nuts.
They were allowed to move around, of course, but when you worked alongside people, you usually ate alongside them too. It wasn’t out of any sort of grudge on Hermione’s part, but she was in work from at least 9-5 and that included her break times. She couldn’t discuss work outside of the Ministry for security reasons, and even if she did, neither Ron nor Harry would care that much.
Hermione mumbled her apologies as Ron let out an uproarious snort.
"Behind our backs with-"
“No.”
”Together.” Draco nodded. “Now thag we don’t have your multiple mishaps to contend with.”
“Just think, you have the prophet to look forward to!”
“Here.” Draco pointed to a particularly fancy piece of handwritten Latin. “This means, uh, kissing. Essentially.”
"With Gin away for such long stretches of time I have to do most of the childcare - which is fine - I just have to work too." Harry did not have to work. He knew it and Draco knew it too, but he was worried he'd go insane. If he couldn't sleep he could at least get out of the house and do something productive.
were bitter, coated in the same self-hatred Harry sometimes saw in himself - when he looked in the mirror and something wasn’t quite
Draco jerked his head in the direction of the newspaper that had been pasted onto a bulletin board with a poorly applied sticking charm. "In the prophet. Do you reckon we should?"
The clock in the hall let out an almighty gong and Draco jumped, clamping his hands over the eye as he did so. It squirmed like a trapped spider beneath his palms as he headed for the cabinet by the wall, easing the metal box open with an elbow.
“He should be alright for a certain length of time - don’t ask me how long he’s got its specific to the castor/castee - but since he slipped in the shower this morning and managed to completely destroy his filing system-”
was, he might as well carry on.
“I do want to marry you, you know?”
“His wife… She was a St. Mungo’s nurse. He noticed her hands were chapped when she came back from surgery. He invented rubber gloves. Specifically for her. I can’t believe you didn’t know about it but then again, not your area of expertise. It’s one of my favourite quotes.”
“You have a bit of a lump on the back of the head.” Draco abandoned his shoes in favour of kneeling behind Harry, positioning his knees in between the floorboards so he was hovering over Harry’s right calf. “Let me look at it at least.”
“As if you could ever be sure with her.” Harry glared pointedly at Romilda. She stood behind the counter with the sour face of a school matron. One black eyebrow arched, her red-lipped mouth in a permanent pout. Her clear gloves shimmered tightly against her slim wrists, her wand shoved through the middle of her wild hair.
“Can’t we just storm down there and get him?”
Granted. Not the best situation he could have gotten himself into. At least he was of age. Draco shivered, retching over the side of the bed once before zeroing in on the carpet.
Twain
Weak sunlight didn't so much stream through the window as it did jump. By Draco's body clock, it was dark and then it wasn't, there hadn't been an early morning in between any of it. A weight shifted in the bed that certainly wasn't him and he almost yelled.
He really couldn't bear to look up, his cheeks burned whenever Harry spoke, especially in those soft, soothing tones. Especially after a couple of nights ago when he-. No. If he didn't think about it, it would go away.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Your broom.” He shook a tree branch above his head and watched in delight as Harry picked needles from his mane of hair.
Hermione glared at him. “If only we were so lucky.” She said drily, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. ”God knows why Draco wants to marry you.”
"I'm saddened you don't get the Prophet delivered any more Draco. I hear page three is... interesting."
“Like you don’t belong anywhere.”
“You fell asleep and I didn’t know what to do.”
The place was already swarming and Draco delicately put his hand on Harry’s arm. “Please be careful. Ron said Hermione’s looking into it.”
“And the carpet and the floorboards.” Draco pointed out.
The snow has broken, but Harry still takes his boots off at the door. He steps into the hallway, squinting into the brilliant light that glows down the hallway from the living room. He can see the door is slightly open and there's muttering from the other side.
The branch creaked, a long low sound in the quiet of the encroaching night. It started small, cracking under Draco’s heel, long spindly splits emerging along the bark.
“Malfoy are you drunk?”
"He called me Potter!" Flip to Page 3 for full exclusive!
Harry stared at Draco as he dropped single sheets of plastic into filmy bags with some forceps.
The 40 minute walk was scenic, if cold. Dozens of windows were painted with frost and a layer of snow crunched underfoot.
Draco paced his office in small circles as Hermione leant against the door jamb.
His eyes strayed to the thick, grey blankets perched on the back of the chair propped by the door. Harry smiled briefly before he caught his reflection bouncing in and out of focus on the windowpane as the dazzling street lamps glittered on the London skyline.
“Yes, that’s precisely it.” Draco blinked up at him sleepily as Harry moved none-too-gracefully towards the table so he was bent over him. “Although I’d rather eat at the table.”
He half-listened to the kettle clank a bit as he cracked the spine of whatever novel he had at hand - he rarely cared about the title, just being whisked into a fictional world was good enough for him.
now. Not here, when he wanted an escape. This was his peace.
“Uh, no.” Ron jerked his wand in an arc and Harry watched the dishes position themselves neatly in the drying rack before remembering he needed to breathe out. It seemed all the breath had been taken from him the moment Ron had said the word a
lifelineheartlineloveline.
”Yes.”
“This is a wonderful casserole Hermione.”
He knew he could let go, but he just wanted to feel the warmth of Harry’s arms, the repeated rise and fall of his chest. The reminder they were alive and that everything might really be okay, despite his pesky need for stronger reading glasses.
“You think Robards’ is capable of whatever you do? Seriously?” Harry was skeptical. “And there’s no evidence. You found your stuff in your lab.”
As soon as the laughter stopped though, silence bloomed, large and wide like an unfurling rose.
“Harry! Don’t you dare!”
Draco hadn’t made up his mind on what to think about Harry’s newfound love for meticulous timekeeping.
“Can’t he just go buy new shoes?” Ron asked.
“Oh!”
Finally, something Draco Malfoy can't do well.
The question caught Draco off guard, if he said yes he’d look possessive and if he said no he’d look like he didn’t care about Harry’s wellbeing. Or at least he knew that’s how the newspapers would spin it.
“NO! Don’t come in!” Draco was an inch away from the door that led into their hallway before it was promptly slammed in his face.
“I look forward to it.” He didn’t really, but Draco looked more relaxed than he had in a long time. Harry reminisced on how he hadn’t looked forward to anything much after the war.
Draco thinks about his father, a flash of a memory - and then blackness. He shakes his head decisively, clasping Harry's hand more tightly, hoping to push his emotions out, through the bond between their clasped palms.
Draco dropped his wand, the eye shrinking back to its original size. It floated gently down to the bottom of the jar as his wand clattered in between the fine line of space between the jar and the stack of papers. He turned around fully, one hand gripping his desk. “What about him?”
“You’ve got that look on your face again.” Hermione hiked her bag up on her shoulder from where it was slipping, the extension charm obvious thanks to the loud rattle inside.
True to his word, Harry had patched up the bookcase and the books were more or less in the right order. Draco counted six that weren’t.
“The directory?” Draco laughed. “Yeah, okay.” Draco hadn’t picked up on Harry’s stumbling, over the unsaid words caught in his throat. The only time, in all the years Harry had known him, that he wasn’t in some state of paranoia over the
There was just
Harry had to power-walk to keep up, Draco weaving in and out of doors and around tables with the nimble ease of a gazelle, leaving Harry yards behind. If Robards were to see him he’d definitely be brought up on how he was neglecting his exercise regime.
by now!”
Well, his wife knew now didn't she. "Hah." He mumbled sleepily to himself as he wiped away the drool that had collected on his pillow.
sort of us that came right before a break-up. This us was soft. A domestic sort of us. The finality to it more of a beginning than an end.
”Harry.” Draco said after a minute. Speaking as seriously as he could while also trying to keep his composure.
Draco swallowed and squared his shoulders. “Of course.” He could do impassioned speeches.
“Oh.” He nodded. “Right.”
“‘Mione gave me some conditions.”
He walks with a purpose, trying to keep his head down. Skirting the spinning skirts and the toes of men in charcoal suits. He's so focused on his footing that he almost forgets his destination.
“I’m glad you could make it.” Harry said softly, choosing to ignore the sniff that she gave.
The silhouette was dark amongst the branches, looking too short to reach for the lower branches to help Draco from his seat in the higher up boughs. He would have mistaken him for a forth year if not for the obviously tousled curls.
”Do you want to talk about it?” Harry tried but he was met with a shrug and a “not really.”
He held onto Harry as tightly as he dared as Harry turned them both around once before setting Draco back onto the wood beneath his feet.
“Yes?” The word was drawn out, like a question.
There was an actual cigarette bin, Merlin knows why, on the inside porch. Draco busied himself with halfheartedly rubbing the back of his white (now grey) heel with his cloak, before giving up and dropping the cloak on top of someone else's on the only available hook.
Draco cringed at the memory of that particular night, alone in the school’s infirmary - decorated with white sheets and disinfectant charms.
He waved awkwardly at some glaring faces he remembered vaguely: a gaggle of girls no older than eighteen seated by the door, an older man who seemed irritated by Harry’s outburst - probably one of those who wrote an underread column about unwarranted fame and exuberant youth - and another small crowd of reporters seated in the back, probably trying their best to be noticed as little as Draco.
“Wait,
He left them all to it as he moved down the aisle, touching the backs of chairs where friends and family sat, the folding chairs that had been hastily jammed into the snow that very morning.
“When you put it like that it does sound bad. But you saw how your arm reacted and that eye is almost an exact working model of a human eye.”
“I’m not excusing myself for, well, anything, I was a malicious rat bastard - I’m just-”
Draco smiled lopsidedly, trying for a smirk that he didn’t have the energy to conjure this late in the day.
He thought he was doing quite well at not asking his best mate about Draco’s ring choices when the pubs side door creaked open.
Taking a long drink, Harry’s vision blurred more than usual before slamming back into focus like a snapped elastic band.
No glasses, he noted.
“Thank you.”
“I mean, it’s only us with these useless signs. And the drop boxes… I’d understand if they decided to update the equipment but I’m not allowed so much as a ballpoint pen!”
There was some rustling before the voice spoke again. “Can I check?”
“Because I can teach you if you want.” He backtracked immediately. “Or I could put you through to someone to help you learn.”
"And so it begins." He whispered.
Draco didn't smoke. It was vulgar.
Withdrawing his long fingers from where they were skating along the dusty surfaces of a back shelf. He stalked toward the table in the middle of the room. It was dark wood, but he couldn’t decipher the grain, from the amount he’d spilled on it over the years.
“Sorry.” He forced himself to stand still, his hands coming down on the back of his office chair, where he started tapping. “I’m just really worried about him. He might do something irreparable. I might do something irreparable.”
”I could make you some. Call it an inspired invention.” Draco kissed the side of Harry’s neck.
Instead of taking the hand Harry proffered, Draco traced the lines of his palm, his own fingers so pale against the creasing rivers of Harry’s-
“Are you mocking me?” Harry swung his legs over the side of the chair and Draco pushed his plate off his lap.
“Okay.” Harry shrugged. “Can we circle back to the part where I compared you to the Dursley’s and you just acquiesced?”
Unfortunately, the door was also practical and Harry slammed it into the shoe rack almost constantly. In hindsight, he should have moved the shoe rack. Instead, he’d just left it where it was and vowed to put all the shoes back in their rightful places before Draco got home.
magical repair places - who
They entered the atrium without any surprising mishaps. Harry even landed on his feet as he shot from the floo in the back of the room.
“Potter! Get your arse back here!”
“What’s… never mind that. I need your arm.”
“And you didn’t think to tell me this before staring at me for a disturbing length of time?”
He works on what he'll say to her instead - how it's probably inconvenient to drop by, how he can smell the pumpkin pasties cooking in the oven... He sees Draco drop his knitting needles, a deer in the headlights as he sits, clutching the blanket to his chest - looking for all he's worth like he wants to be clutching an Invisibility Cloak.
"Fuck." He said it before it really had time to register that the word had passed his lips. Levitating the plate over to the sink, Draco let a scouring charm deal with the damage to the floor. The hardwood had chipped where the plate had landed only seconds before. If Draco had only been a second faster he could have arrested the flying food, and maybe saved the plate in the process. Draco pushed his fingers through his hair.
“Why are you asking so many questions?”
“Specimen.” Robards sniffed. “It’s hardly alive - a bit like Death Eaters in that respect.” It was hardly said under his breath, and with stiff resolve Draco turned back around, indicating the conversation was over.
Yes, he was definitely more appealing from behind.
He didn’t notice her eyes brimming with tears, or the small smile tugging at her mouth. Narcissa hadn’t learned to smile, it was unladylike. She told herself this was different.
Someone said “cheese” and he thought it was the funniest phrase on earth. Who, upon being asked to smile, said cheese? Draco threw his head back in merriment and chose, in that moment, to be happy.
, he thought ruefully but Harry had chosen to stay the night. Again. To be there when he woke in the morning. He wasn’t sure when that had become a regular occurrence but Draco wasn’t going to complain, in fact, he’d make the most of it and he’d told Harry as much.
“It’s coffee.”
Draco tried to look offended but his heart just wasn’t in it. “I wouldn’t work on your eyes for the good of the world or the glory of the Ministry. While I was learning about Project EYE I was… doing some things on the side. Did you hear nothing of my rant in my lab?”
“Either you’re going to convince him to work with me or you’re going to give him a dressing down because he used his paid leave to bully Robards into letting him do paperwork.” Draco curled his fingers into quotation marks.
“Are those the ones?” Ron asked through an ill-concealed yawn almost as soon as Harry stepped from the shower. He nodded towards the blankets draped over the chair.
Harry in an armchair by the fire, with Ron leaning against his knee, gangly legs stretched out on the rug. Hermione sat herself on one end of the sofa so Draco was forced to sit on the other; stiff and awkward like a jointed marionette.
He looks at his hands before he has chance to register his face. They fly over the keys, barely touching them as the melody wafts around the dancers. Harry's eyes are immediately drawn to his fingers, long and graceful. They're adorned with sparkling silver, the rings catching in the florescents every time he twists his hands. Harry finds himself weaving his way through the dancers, just to get a closer look.
Draco nodded. The desk clicked, the whole thing popping open like the desk of a Victorian schoolchild. His lips pressed together in a thin line, the pink of his lips whitening around the edges. “No going back now.”
“You look like all my great aunts rolled into one.” Draco took a sip of his own wine.
Harry let out a groan, pulling away reluctantly.
If Harry kept looking at him like that he was almost sure he’d drop it. He decided to focus on talking, telling him useless facts and the ingredients and about the distilling process.
“Gloves, Pans.” Draco nodded towards her latex encased fingers.
“- why can’t you get yours?”
“You might have a concussion. Or memory loss or something.” The voice didn’t sound sure.
Draco barked a laugh, turning it into a cough as he stepped away from the door. His father had been out of prison six months and still, neither of them could hold their tongues around their prejudices. Merlin. "I hope I wasn't interrupting anything, Draco."
“Look sir, you didn’t hear it from me but you might want to check his bin for paper aeroplanes.”
This was his parents room. His parents bed.
Draco turned to look at the man. Dark stubble grazed his jaw and his hair tickled at his neckline, where his shirt was. Draco studied the strands for a lingering moment before dragging his eyes up to the strangers face.
His stomach rumbled. “Can you make me breakfast?”
? “Thanks. Any sex drive I would have had is now well and truly gone.”
Harry smiled wide.
Draco ignored the thumping in his heart as he thought about the little ring box tucked at the back of his bedside cabinet, concentrating instead on the sizzling egg in the frying pan.
If a look could convey how much someone wanted to cast a lip-lock Charm, Draco wore it.
Harry felt almost imperceptibly lighter as Draco touched his lips to Harry’s.
Draco Malfoy's eyes are cast downward, toward the keys, not even looking up to the scrap of music paper perched on the piano's ledge. Harry catches the sparkling greys as Draco's eyes search out the keys. The roiling sea of emotion emitting from just below the surface pours into every  note.
“Harry would think it was a new thing for the elite.” Draco said. He sounded wistful.
“Yes I do.”
Harry’s bed was different to the one Draco had slept in, but he wasn’t thinking about anything other than Harry’s legs entwined in his.
"Is there another pianist that can take over for you?" Harry breathes down Draco's neck, short and sharp, making Draco shiver - with cold or anticipation... well, he can only find out, can't he?
“You don’t have working eyes.” Draco said before he could stop himself.
Oh, here we go. Draco tapped faster.
A silence had fallen until Harry asked what Draco was looking at. He was confused for a split second before he realised his eyes had drifted, fixing on a non-specific point in the sky.
“Oh no you can not.” Draco lost the colour in his face. “I’m not having any obscene quotes splashed across the Prophet just yet. You’re going to have to pretend you’ve lost your voice.”
"Dangerous." Hermione had commented once.
They would care because they were her friends, but not because they were actually interested in whatever she was doing for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.
He'd hoisted Teddy onto his knee and rocked him when he cried, fed him bottles and changed him. He lost a lot of sleep but it was worth it. It would always be worth it.
“Not the welcome I thought I’d be getting but I’m glad you’re home and I wasn’t wasting my breath by shouting at an empty house.”
Draco whipped around with the ferocity of a viper. “No. You’re a witness.” It took him another five seconds to say “I bet it was Robards.”
“Elegant, Potter.”
. His comment about Anderson the night before.
Harry’s hand receded from the doorknob and he moved toward the stairs.
“Draco.” Harry sighed, pushing himself forward so his elbows rested on his knees. “I’m just trying to understand.”
Harry had brought a cloak.
They turned together as light started to paint the room, watching the sunrise in silence.
Draco groaned, throwing his hands up in defeat, wrapping his legs around the trunk momentarily before grabbing back onto the trunk. His blush was travelling down his neck, he could feel it heating his cheeks and nose, all too aware of the light shining between him and his nemesis.
“Pansy?” Ron asked.
He supposed some clubs used a modified fidellius charm, but they were reserved for the elite, so he wouldn't know anything about that. He supposed his parents might. He instantly wrinkled his nose at the idea of Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy sharing a bottle of Odgen's finest and complaining about the poor service despite having the best seat in the house.
Draco rolled his eyes skyward. She was so passive aggressive sometimes. “Would you like me to make you some tea, Pansy?”
The sound Harry gave was noncommittal, and Draco leant into the sensation of curling fingertips on his scalp.
Draco blinked the image away. “Right.”
Purple drapes hung just inside the second door, trying - and failing spectacularly - to give some modicum of privacy. Draco almost snorted. The Phoenix was known for a lot of things but it was definitely not their privacy.
“Can I kiss you?”
“Your bookmark is on the floor.”
“She flooed
“Because I love you, you silly goose. I can also tell you didn’t get any sleep so don’t even
“No.” Eventually he just pulled it over his head, tossing it into the laundry basket with a satisfied sound. “Maybe I’ve been cursed.”
He didn’t have a chance to find out.
Harry spoke in between bites of mince. “I can move them back if you’re not okay with me touching your stuff, I should have asked before...” He trailed off.
Every star Draco had ever laid eyes upon couldn’t compare to the galaxy exploding behind his eyes as Harry ran his hands through Draco’s hair, his fingers looping runaway strands behind his ears in slow, practiced motions.
Grey and green, each looking into the universe. The planets of their eyes staring like they wanted to belong in the other man’s gravitational pull.
“An idiot.” Harry said softly into the night, staring up at Draco as he gesticulated at the air, long limbs swaying in graceful arcs as he talked, ignoring Harry’s lopsided grin completely.
Draco grimaced. “You’re trying to have a heart attack.”
“What?” Harry was snapped from his existentialism like a rubber band.
"Hello. Earth to Malfoy? Are you awake?"
“So, I look like McGonagall and you’ve moved my bookshelves.”
didn’t know
God, he was so fucked.
“What’s what all about?”
Narcissa fixed him with a pointed glare before shifting her paper in her lap, eventually deciding to flick through it, and Draco watched as it once more obscured her face. The way Narcissa sat, her ankles so obviously crossed at the balls, her back ridgid, The Prophet may as well have been an expensive pair of sunglasses.
He blinked, about to wipe the sleep from his eyes with his shirt. Instead, Draco jerked upright as his long, cold fingers came into contact with his nipples. The first thing he saw was a long nest of dark hair.
If he was going to prison for anything it wouldn’t be theft of government documents or breaking and entering or even unlawful use of potion ingredients without a licence. It was going to be for the cold-blooded murder of Pansy Colette Parkinson.
Draco had been in Belfast for almost a week, ironing out Muggle/Wizard relations between England and the Celtic Nations. Supposedly, according to Draco, it was the Muggle/Muggle relations they needed to be more worried about.
"Who taught you to do that? Not Potter I hope?" Lucius sneered, but it wasn't nearly as menacing as it had been when he was a child. If Draco thought about it, after all this time he was probably more scared of Aunt Andromeda than both of his parents combined.
"Oh for Merlin's sake." Harry bundled Draco, all long, dangling limbs and unusually hard stomach over his shoulder. "You'd better keep your appendages inside the damn car." Harry whispered softly as he apparated them back to England, accompanied to the never-ending tune of carnival music in Harry's head.
“I swear she’s the only one who can get away with that anymore.” Ron smiled at her and she dipped her head in an acknowledgement of the extra chicken. He stared forlornly toward the double doors leading outside, the wand box stuck to the wall.
"Wait what are you doing?!" Draco squeaks as Harry dumps Teddy in his open arms. The boy squeals, wriggling out of Draco's grasp just as quickly as he's plopped into it. He watches in despair as Teddy wobbles over to Harry, a half-sprint to the door before the other man can leave.
“Everyone knows sticking charms are tricky. Sometimes magic just won’t budge without Muggle equipment. It’s what we used to use before wands, you know.”
“No you don’t.” Harry said.
. He was just a boy who wanted to be loved. A boy who’s lips felt like the whole sky.
The words
Harry heard his fork clatter back onto his plate, the piece of bacon dropping back down onto the tray as he watched Draco position himself at the end of the bed - the ring box going from a theoretical to an actuality in seconds.
He grabbed the sides, the feel of the cold wood between his fingers grounding. “What the hell have they done with my research?”
“Well.” Draco sniffed. “I suppose, yes. So help me down or go away.”
“Good morning.”
“Wait what!”
He threw his arms around Molly, ducking so she could loop her arms around his neck. Her hair was coiled loosely around her face, a greying gold that caught the weak sunlight streaming through the living room blinds.
“It’s not for me!” He nodded towards Harry who was twisting his engagement ring around his finger nervously.
“And have you? Perfected it I mean- OW!” Harry yanked his arm away from Draco’s long fingers, as a long red mark started to appear.
“I see you’re back to bullying my husband.” Hermione appeared from behind a paper bag full of vegetables. She turned to Ron. “What’s he done this time?”
“You’re telling me that I’ve been to not one, but
a cake. Well, you. The note thanked you for looking after me and things.”
“Don’t look at me like that.”
“Aren’t all his robes grey?” Ron said.
“Have I- of course I’ve tried! It was the first thing I did, what do you take me for?”
Technically, Draco should have been in bed by now, he’d finished cashing sales and pottering around in the semi-functional on-site kitchen - which was really just a back room with a slightly broken kettle.
“Go on then, open it!”
It was barely work. For all Potter grumbled though, it was as though he was doing a life sentence - and it wasn't him who had to cobble together retribution speeches for a stadium-wide audience at arse o' clock in the morning.
“It will.”
It all twisted together, a mess inside him as he started explaining: all retina and optic nerve. Cones and colour perception.
“Shit.” Pansy laughed. “I don’t suppose I’ll be getting any sleepover invites to Potter’s will I?”
Draco’s eyes widened, immediately straying to the mantelpiece that held the photo of Harry, Hermione and Ron; all cackling at something just out of frame.
Or at least Draco didn't smoke until March, because it had been vulgar, previously, until March.
He supposed, thinking about it properly, his accent did make the sentence kind of amusing.
He’d been happy enough, alone with his tightly packed bookshelves and whistling kettle but it had been lonely, sometimes. Surrounded by lives he couldn’t live. Not really.
He’d known they were old fashioned but
"-with a Muggleborn!"
She acknowledged him with a tip of her chin.
...now
And with that, Draco vanished, the wispy grey trace the only thing left to indicate he’d apparated away.
“Why? You’re in Muggle liaison.”
"Relax, they're in the wash, along with your shoes. One of them was purple?"
“We can’t… Hermione’s parents are coming and it’s already a lot for them to take in.”
“Now you’re being overdramatic. Just pretend you don’t know for Christ’s sake.” Hermione put her hand to her forehead for a second.
Harry looked exasperated. “Shacklebolt wouldn’t do that.”
“Shit.”
”Draco wants to marry me?” Harry’s eyes lit up.
"I don't know what that was and I don't think I really want to, so I'll leave you to it, yeah?"
“I’ll tell you later”, Hermione smiled, full of conspiratory.
“Fuck me. I deserve it too.”
Hermione nodded gratefully. “Thankfully this curse doesn’t involve your untimely death so you just need to fulfill the conditions.” She scribbled frantically as she spoke, her pencil scratching quietly on the back of a piece of discarded parchment. “We have bigger problems than your love life you know.”
Draco inhaled his laugh so quickly that it came out as a snort, which, of course, Harry had fun mimicking for the five minutes it took to walk back to Draco's. By the time they got to the door they were both in stitches, having to catch their breath before saying their goodbyes.
Draco was sat on Harry’s sofa, prodding the buttons on the remote control as if they’d bite him.
Until now.
Tripple- Draco cuts the thought off before it can form, instead pasting on a smile and taking Teddy's hand. "How about we go and get you ice cream from the nice man down the road?" Draco crosses the fingers on his other hand behind his back. Fortescue's can fix everything, right?
“Robards told me Shaklebolt was taking me off the case.”
” He mimicked. “Wow. I love you too.”
"Look it's only one day, I'm sure even you can handle that." Harry raises his eyebrow in a challenge, ruffling Teddy's shimmering hair as he makes for the door, leaving Draco spluttering his contentions, but not really doing anything to stop Harry leaving.
“They’re different shades.” Hermione looked at Harry, horrified that she knew such a thing. While they were on a first name basis now, they were still by no means on friendly terms.
“That’s classified information Mr. Malfoy. You know that.” Shacklebolt smiled a little.
Most of the roosting birds squarked to life and Harry watched as a dispersion of wildlife temporarily let the stars wink out.
All he knew was he felt safer in Grimmauld Place than he ever had anywhere else and whether it was the house welcoming him as a member of it’s family or Harry’s presence, Draco wasn’t going to argue with it.
Instead of offering the banister, Harry looped his arm around Draco’s shoulders, steering him down the stairs and out of the door that read
He didn’t really need this, he was in therapy, he’d dealt with all that. But if it helped Draco, come to terms with some things in the process, he didn’t mind raking up the past just a little more.
“The one you give Draco. Constantly.” Ron shrugged before asking Hermione if she’d packed a sandwich.
“I’ve got a sobering potion in my pocket. Please take it before you do anything you’ll regret.”
“I couldn’t stand the thought of being wrong -
Draco sighed, content.
“He’s having charm troubles.” Harry hadn’t noticed the point when Ron had gotten himself a drink but now that he had it he was definitely chuckling into his butterbeer.
“It fell off the table..” Harry missed a beat, tearing his eyes from Draco to check the clock above their heads, the one mounted above the brick wall of the fireplace.
"Harry? No- I started smoking." As if to prove it, Draco pulled the wand from his teeth, holding it aloft between his forefingers.
“So, Harry. What about your glasses?” Ron asked.
“Did you hit your head Malfoy?”
Double fuck. He'd hoped Teddy hadn't heard.
“Since you’ve had such a terrible week I’m going to leave you in here,” he glanced around to make sure the bedroom was tidy enough for Harry not to make a fool of himself if he disappeared. “I’ll assume you’re okay to put yourself to bed while I make your tea.”
The disturbance of leaves below had Draco on his guard, wand drawn. He had all of two minutes to decide which he loved more; his pride or his want of hot food.
The words blurred together and he heard himself huff in annoyance, biting back another irritating sound that cut through the bliss of his concentration.
“You didn’t.”
The clack of needles is apparent, getting louder as he sneaks down the hall.
It had been a long three hours that night and Harry revelled in never having to have a conversation that exhaustingly long again.
Draco studied the eye carefully as it rolled around his desk. No matter what he did, the thing just wouldn’t stay still - he had the scratches to prove it; angry, red lines stemming from the tips of his fingers. They only started to fade to a light pink at the second knuckle.
managed to sound haughty and annoyed, his crisp, clipped accent causing them both to dissolve into more, quiet giggles.
“Great, you can just tell him I flooded the kitchen instead.” Harry was too tired to do much but let his head drop back against the pillow as Draco stroked his forehead.
Harry’s expression mirrored Hermione’s, albeit with less hair. The pure horror that he’d divulged such information as Draco’s wardrobe choices, and apparently bemoaned them enough times for Hermione to quote his words exactly back at him was a ghastly notion.
The response was so snarky that Draco heard Pansy in his head “You’re even starting to sound like him.”
The man held out his hand. "I'm Lark."
“You don’t know anything about my paperwork load, that’s private information of the Auror Department.”
“They should have had enough time to
Your son. Not our son. Draco sighed, before seating himself on an armchair that opposed his mothers, ignoring the lace doily he'd neglected to remove.
While Draco was in his element at functions, any event that required him to be anything other than perfectly manicured made him feel like a fish out of water. He was overdressed, he could tell, looking at Ron and Harry in jeans next to his pressed trousers and slightly open button up shirt.
Anderson
Harry had faced his demons, he might as well do the same. “I thought I was doing them- my parents-  a favour”.
Ron got up, unwillingly from where he had been pulling cat hair from the rug.
Nothing.
“Are you sure you want this?”
Draco tipped his head back, panting as his heart hammered in his chest. He closed his eyes, listening to the small sounds of the night.
When Draco properly looked at her later, at the pub before everyone else crowded in, he nodded appealingly. Her hair was swept up in a ponytail, although it still managed to reach halfway down her back. She'd positioned her wand in such a way that it cut straight down the middle, focusing a little ball of energy on the mass of blond locks so they'd stay in place.
“Uh, yeah.” Harry stood dripping on his bedroom floor, a towel around his waist. “Can you both leave? I need to get dressed.”
Draco sat up, hitting his head on the bed frame as he did so and for one horrible moment he was back in the manor. But Voldemort’s voice didn’t ever sound as honey-sweet, the cadence dipping down like oaken wood. Bright yellow to a deep rich brown. He struggled to open his eyes.
“Why would he do that?” Pansy gave Draco a look that was both sharp and sad.
Harry had simply rested his chin in the dip between Draco’s neck and shoulder, taking in the scent of lavender shampoo.
"Hah. No chance."
Draco had owned flat above the bookshop for a number of years before Potter came back into his life, quite allusively at that.
“Oh God.” Harry brought his hands up to his face, peering through his fingers as if to check that Draco hadn’t disappeared. “I tried to stick the umbrella stand to the floor so we wouldn’t keep tripping over it. Well, so
A small bell jangled dimly. It sort of sounded like the front door but Draco ignored it.
Draco hid his mouth behind his hand as he tried to keep his bubbling giggles at bay. “I’m very proud of you sweetheart - your hair’s been captured perfectly.”
Draco shrugged as he tucked Harry into bed, eventually climbing in beside him. “Ron flooed me.”
“She’s going in a Muggle car! They have something called a chauffeur!” Arthur talked nineteen to the dozen as he ducked under the awning of a new café en route to the town hall that had been dutifully cleared of Muggles - although it needn’t had been; the snow had settled overnight.
Pansy pouted before stalking off turning only to tell him she’d inform the Minister of Harry’s
It was turmoil, everything turned on its head. He respected his father but now that he was in jail Draco had time to re-evaluate that he might have been wrong, as least some of the time. Government conspiracy though, he didn’t have the energy. He had NEWT’s to study for.
“Nothing was ever that bad for me.”
"Have you seen mother anywhere? I'd like to see her before dinner, if that's quite alright." Draco cringed at himself. He knew the way he spoke wasn't brilliant but here it just seemed to get worse, especially in the presence of his parents. He suspected it was because there was no-one there to correct him. (Or, as Harry had once so eloquently told him: "You sound poncey, cut it out".)
“What look?”
“Just because it moves doesn’t mean it’s still alive - if it ever was to begin with. Mad Eye is dead and, with all intents and purposes, so is that thing.” He told himself as he picked the glove from the floor, dropping it into the bin as he left. He bit the inside of his cheek as he listened to the slow rattle of the eye slamming back and forth against the lock on the box.
Harry’s breath was shallower as he let Draco guide his hand. “See that the North Star is to the left? Well… if you look to the right that’s Leo.”
This, for some reason, was a revelation to him.
Draco nodded, immediately tense until the hands went in, rooting around for a swelling. He sunk into the feeling.
Hermione unshrunk the book she’d brought with her - With Curses - and dumped it on the half full desk to her right. She only slightly cringed as Harry’s terrible filing system drifted to the floor.
“All done!”
“How long have you been…” Harry gestured to the bruises under Draco's eyes, lighter but no less prominent.
Shit. Not Potter then.
They stared, incredulous. The desk was organised; neat piles of parchment pushed against the edges of the inside of it, while phials of liquids were cuddled together in a box. The eye was front and centre. It looked up from the jar of saline solution it was sat in.
“Yes!” Came the ensuing answer from behind the door.
hated me because I wasn’t wizard enough.” There was no malice in his voice, just resignation.
As another camera clicked he was pulled back to 1998 and some long-forgotten headline that had her pitched against Cho for at least a month.
And she couldn’t have Harry coming into her house just to leave again, with Draco Malfoy of all people. So they sat.
"No need. Trey will put it on my tab." Oh. So he was arrogant too, just Draco's luck, someone who looked like Potter and acted like him.
Draco was about to answer another of Potters’ idiot questions as he yanked the door open to his studio. He had been expecting to perfunctorily apologise for the mess - no matter where he is or what he’s doing, he’s still his mother’s son and she took a selective pride in the manor and it’s gardens like no other.
“No! Of course not!”
“You’ve rubbed off on me.” Harry said in a way of response. He then ruined it by adding “or it could have been Hermione.”
Harry scrambled to his feet, almost slipping on the stones under him as he did so. “Yes, sir!” God, he hated drills.
"Why? Think I'm going to sell you out to the Prophet?"Draco was sure his already slight blush darkened to a maroon. Maybe a scarlet, he definitely wouldn't look out of place in the room he was in: all deep reds and bright golds. "Sorry." Harry said, "that was probably in poor taste."
“The other stuff?” Harry took a chair from under the table, wincing as it was dragged along the floor.
“You snuck into my lab! I have the authorization to kill you.”
“You’re not a bad person now.”
It had started as expected, with Hermione pulling Harry into the kitchen by the sleeve of his jumper to demand what was going on. “As an adult I thought I was above punching people but right now I feel like I’m not.”
“They’re creepy because they’re supposed to trap the devil, God, it’s like you never even read A History Of Magic.” Potter cracked a smile.
It had claimed their heads but they didn’t have to let it touch their hearts.
“What, like tasks you have to do because of the circumstances affecting the way you live?”
“You locked me in a cupboard.”
Draco took a breath and measured the drops before asking Harry to blink. Hard.
“Have you ever looked at someone and thought am I a dumbass?” Harry said out of the blue as he watched Draco mix another ingredient into a glass bottle—an already hazy lilac liquid starting to emerge—while he was cross-legged on his carpet
He was surrounded by bottles and notes and “Hermione gave me a sleep potion. Turns out I can read my own writing when my wrist isn’t shaking from constant insomnia. I figured out where I went wrong.” He grinned like he’d won a prize and Harry couldn’t help but ask him if he wanted a hug.
