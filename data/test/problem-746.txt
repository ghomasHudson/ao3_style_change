Daxia looked down uttering a laugh so sad it pulled at Harry's heart. She shook her head as if reprimanding herself for something, "That's just it isn't it. Why do I care, I shouldn't I know I shouldn't but I can't help it because I love you " she said tears now falling freely from her eyes. Harry breadth in sharply at her declaration.
"Thank you " she said . "For what?" Harry asked. " For giving me a reason" she stated simply and then without adding anything else walked away, leaving Harry more confused than ever.
He watched her, the dark shadows under her eyes, paleness of her skin, the way she merely shuffled her food around barely eating anything . She seemed thinner than last year and he couldn't even comprehend how that was possible as she was skin and bone last year as it is. Something wasn't right.
" Yeah I think its quite an interesting topic for conversation ." looking at him " Don't you " she asked , expression so serious that Harry couldn't help it anymore and burst out laughing, a moment later she joined in.
" I'm Gracie Dawson, I'm new here" she said as an introduction. Harry nodded " I'm Harry Potter." he offered back.
Daxia let the book slam shut and dropped it to the floor finally looking up at him, and that only made Harry more nervous because Daxia was almost like Hermione in the matter of books and if she was willing to drop the book then whatever had upset her must be pretty serious. " Oh nothing!! everything's perfect. Why do you care anyway ?" she answered, which wasn't helpful at all.
" Oh I can't believe you did it Grace, the idiot actually believed you liked him" one of them said before bursting out in laughter again.
Whatever his friends thought it didn't matter because he intended to find out what was going on and soon.
He reached his hand out toward the snitch it sped up and changed direction making Harry and Jason quickly dive down and loop on themselves. It was back in Harry's sight as he gained distance. Harry looked behind to see where Jason was but couldn't see him anywhere. Harry's arm reached out again leaning closer and felt the wings through his fingers his palm closed around the golden ball; he had gotten it, he had won the game. A whistle blew as he held up the snitch towards Cotton and the teams.
"Hello, Harry," She muttered as their eyes met. "So nice to finally meet you in person, my name is Clara Bennett, I was in my final year at Hogwarts when you started." She said answering Harry's unspoken question.
Draco paced the foyer up and down, holding his glass of wine waiting for Blaise and Ginny to emerge from the fireplace. They were five minutes late, and he was starting to worry, they weren't going to show up.
The bedroom door opened and Harry gaped as he saw Draco Malfoy stood there with his arms folded and eyebrows raised. Harry swore and lifted up his blanket as he realised he was completely naked, Draco Malfoy had just seen him naked.
"Screw this," Harry said, and knocked back half of the glass and handed it to Ron. "I will be back in a sec."
When Harry and Ron had joined Hermione and Neville in the Great Hall for breakfast, they noticed Hermione did not look happy at all. Her natural untamed hair was looking even more untamed, and she had darker circles under her eyes.
Harry frowned curiously but nodded his understanding. He couldn't quite believe he had managed to spend over an hour alone with three Slytherins. He stood up with Teddy now fully asleep.
The woman cut the stuffed unicorn down and handed it to him; he squeezed it tightly as he turned around and showed a very amused Harry.
The three of them carried on into the ballroom; Harry is feeling a lot more anxious now, the only thing he liked about having a mask on was the fact he could blend in with everyone else once he was out of the eye of the cameras.
"Have you still got your undetectable extension charm on your bag, Hermione?" Harry asked as they walked passed the Owl Emporium window.
Harry reached an arm around to tear Draco’s hands away. He wanted to do it himself, wanted to undress him, to let Draco
"No, my dad says peas are the most overrated green vegetable, and it shouldn't need any more attention," Luna said seriously pushing her bowl away from her.
Draco had only just realised the room had gone completely silent, he turned his head to the side and saw four pairs of eyes staring at them, with curious looks on their faces.
"Dawlish is looking into it; he is under the impression that Robards has been up to some shady dealings."
The match was currently tied 40/40, and there was no sign of the snitch yet, Cotton was yelling at them all as he circled refereeing the game. Harry's team had been given four penalties in the first five minutes as team two kept fouling.
"He pays attention to me," Ginny shouted. "He listens to me; you are never here; you are always out till stupid o'clock in the morning drinking with Dean and Sea... and him."
"No, sir, we have been searching every day, high and low," Draco said, feeling relieved he hadn't been caught out.
"I was constantly struggling with my urges not to kiss my male friends when I got a teeny bit drunk; I didn't understand at the time that I was gay." He rubbed his face vigorously. "What you saw in the pensieve was a drunken closeted gay who had just come out of denial that his girlfriend had been cheating on him for months, I decided it was best to drink and spend time with Dean and Seamus than have to deal with it."
Draco was opening and closing drawers in Harry's kitchen. "Harry, do you have any Spello-tape?" Draco asked him impatiently.
Draco passed the plate smashing game after they had finished eating and stared at it longingly but knew inside that Harry was right and he had no chance of winning it. They got to the booth with a pond of floating yellow rubber ducks with metal hooks coming out of their heads. Underneath the ducks in the water were hundreds of little goldfish swimming in circles.
"I've not seen you in the office this week, mate where have you been?" Ron asked with sauce stains around his mouth; he wondered what Malfoy would say about that.
"He will have the same as me," Draco answered for him as he noticed he was looking for a menu. "That will be all, Rose."
"Ever since you got that dark mark Draco you have become a real bore, what do you say about giving me a dark mark on my neck or inner thigh," Pansy pushed, trailing her fingers up over his arm.
The Falcons start getting more aggressive against The Arrows, which sends Bludgers flying towards them more often, Draco kept trying to swear at the beaters as they flew past their box.
His smile vanished when he saw Harry pick it up and hold it in front of him. "Nope, this is not it," he said gleefully, which made Draco curl his hands into fists.
“But,” Malfoy began, but Harry grabbed hold of his sleeve and dragged him away from the booth. “I almost got one.”
Draco realised he had said the wrong thing and possibly ruined any chance of Harry understanding. "No, Harry, he sometimes gets Death Eaters sending him letters begging him for help, or threatening him for being a traitor, he is staying out of trouble, I swear."
Harry slumped back down on the chair staring at the empty fireplace as though waiting for Draco to come back and apologise then take him up to his room and give him the best fuck of his life, but he didn't return, and slowly Harry's eyes closed again.
"You want me to flirt," He turned his head to Zach, who too was drinking from the bowl. "With that?"
Draco searched his face looking for some tell for if he was lying, the rational side of him kept screaming he was overreacting but he kept hearing his fathers voice on the other side telling him that Harry was a spy.
"Nice to meet you too," Harry smiled nervously. He watched Cotton as he tapped out a few more people and then walked over to their peg and tapped out two of the seekers leaving Harry, Clara and Jason.
"Harry, Harry, come on, the boy who lived can't be that oblivious, can he?" Robards laughed malevolently.
It was late afternoon, and the sunlight that slated in through the window bathed the man he loved in soft light.
"Teddy isn't a Weasley; he is my cousin," Draco replied still not relaxing. "If I want to treat him, I should; it's partly my fault his broom broke in the first place."
He led the way out of the library, and through the manor to the east wing where he stood in front of a blank wall waiting for the familiar black door to appear.
"He is not my friend," Harry said greyly, grasping his hand onto the hip flask he had in his robes. Out the corner of his eye, he saw Robard smile as broad as the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland. He needed to get out of this lift.
They came up from under the table. "I'm sorry, did you say my name?" Harry asked dumbfoundedly. "You know who I am?"
"Seriously? I literally saw you naked last night," Draco smirked, but Harry still didn't move. "Fine," He closed his eyes and put both hands over his face like a child playing hide and seek.
"I hope you realise that cafe has been a staple in Diagon Alley for many years and has never closed."
"No, I stopped defending him years ago, I just think he acted the way he acted is because he believes the Aurors will blame the death eater vanishings on him."
It took him a good few minutes to find something suitable to wear to try out in; he wanted to make sure he looked professional but comfortable at the same time, it didn't help that most of his clothes needed washing. He found some sweats and a hoodie at the bottom of his wardrobe and quickly threw them on hoping he looked okay as he stared at himself in the mirror flattening his hair with his fingers.
He pulled his jumper back down and watched Harry sit up straight again taking calming breaths; his hair looked more messy than usual.
Harry was crowding him, filling his mouth, his head: musky, shower, sweet, sour tang of pre-ejaculate... Jesus. Harry's thighs were taut, and he was thrusting lightly, sweating with the effort of holding back. With his free hand, Draco reached out to find Harry's and closed it in his own thick, blonde hair.
His father dropped the newspaper in front of him. His face fell when he saw the large picture on the front cover, him and Harry leaving Gringotts Bank yesterday afternoon. The big, black, bold letters were saying Friend or Foe along the top.
"Stupid, Useless, Pathetic," Malfoy muttered angrily as he threw more balls towards the plates.  Harry saw him try to grab for his wand at one point, but he gave him a look that told him don't even try it.  His natural neat white-blonde hair had become ruffled as he had run his hands through it so many times trying to keep his cool and concentrate. The man behind the booth was getting a good laugh out of it and kept encouraging him to have another try, although he didn't have to try that hard Malfoy was determined to smash a plate.
They all sat down in the lightly lit room, Draco pulled down the glasses that were still on the top of his head. Pansy and Blaise sat hand in hand looking at him excitedly.
Harry shook his head, bemused. "That's probably not even in there; I don't know how this person got all this information about my life."
"Why is there a broken bowl of guacamole on the floor?" Ron asked with a handful of Doritos in his hand.
Harry and Ron stood either side of Hermione with their hands around the back of waist smiling at the photographers. They were running slightly late due to Ron not be able to decide what to wear, at least it wasn't the mess he wore to the Yule ball in their fourth year, Harry thought as he had rolled his eyes at the pile of robes piled up on Ron and Hermione's bed. In the end, Hermione chose him something to wear and told him to get a move on.
Hermione shook her head at him and returned the smile. "Well, I guess we will see you on the dance floor if we can find you that is."
Hermione kneeled down in front of him. "Draco?" She spoke softly to get his attention, he didn't look at her but nodded. "Can I call anyone for you?"
Blaise was off with his mystery girlfriend, he'd been writing to her over the summer, but she had a boyfriend that she hadn't talked to yet. Draco was happy for him as long as it wasn't a Hufflepuff or Loony Lovegood then he would have to disown him as a best friend.
He had however been curious to know why his father was in the ministry on Friday and was trying to work out the best approach to ask him.
It was a short letter, and at that moment he knew he had been caught, he was sure to be fired and or sent to Azkaban. Would Potter know? Would he hate him after they had only just started to become friendlier? He worried over in his head.
Harry felt stupid for not taking into account their history together and realised she had him beat. "Okay, fine, but you can't tell anybody else, not even Ron."
"I don't think I should be the only naked one here," Harry said getting up and closing the space between them.
"So how did you get involved?" Draco asked he felt like this was going to all backfire onto his hard work the past few years.
He felt him kiss back, and open his lips slightly, He kissed him with more passion and ran his free hand through Harry's hair grabbing it and leaned in more, so Harry was almost laying back in the seat.
Attendees of Harry Potters 20th birthday last night got more than they bargained for when Draco Malfoy got on one knee and proposed to Harry Potter, the reveal was said to be amazing after Harry had blown out his candles fireworks shot out and spelt out the words will you marry me? A source who attended the party had told me how Harry was so surprised and didn't hesitate to say yes. There wasn't a dry eye in the house as they embraced in a kiss. If you remembered last month, they announced they were moving in on Draco's birthday I wonder what they will announce next year? More updates as they come on all things Harry Potter.
The Great Hall was half empty when he eventually made it. He planted himself down on the bench in front of Tracy Davis, who was doing her homework and eating a giant sandwich. Goyle shifted further down the table when he caught Draco out the corner of his eye. Draco narrowed his eyes at him and quickly stilled when he saw Potter walking down the aisle heading towards him.
Harry found himself patting his fringe down on his scar. He figured that the witch was the old man's wife, the way she was tutting at him.
Draco struggled between her grasp, trying to break free. It irritated him when she did this, not because it was uncomfortable or mortally embarrassing, but because he knew he would end up relaxing into her and pouring out his heart and secrets.
"I made a deal with Pansy that we would give her the exclusive couple story, in exchange for all the favours she has done for you and me," Draco muttered sheepishly.
"Don't get Theo started again," Blaise groaned. "We had to suffer through his half-hour rant before you got here."
He could see her thinking it through in her head and then nodded to herself. "Fine, I will tell you, only because you deserve to know the truth and Harry should have done the right thing."
"I didn't work for you to begin with, and no not since you fired me in 06." Draco lifted up the corner of his mouth into another smirk; Harry wanted to kiss it.
"Oh, Draco, dear, Astoria is here, why don't you go have your picture taken together," His mother beamed delightedly.
"Then pay attention," He snapped and then continued. "Cotton has placed coloured pegs over there; I want you to stand behind the position you are trying out for, Red, keeper, Green, seeker, Yellow, beater and blue, chaser."
"Thank you," She smiled, patting him on the chest. "You really are a good guy; I hope Malfoy knows that too."
"Ron, what's your brother doing here?" Hermione whispered across the table while they were waiting for the chatter to die down before the sorting ceremony.
Harry stared at the parchment Draco was holding up; he found it hard to get his vision to focus, how much had drunk tonight? Draco's blonde hair was more untamed than usual he noted as he stood in the dimly lit kitchen. The smirk on his face was more prominent than before. "Reply in person?" Harry said repeating what Draco had said.
"It's okay; honestly, I have gone to visit them every year on my birthday since the end of the war."
"Yes," Malfoy said bitterly. "Blaise set us up, and I will never agree to a set up again if that's his standard."
Harry gulped, feeling their conversation had taken an unexpected turn. "Uh, I mean, Pav." He felt heat under his collar.
"He didn't; he had to ask me, he only seemed interested in going when he heard he could win prizes there."
"Get off me Weasley, I can walk by myself." Draco tried to yank himself away, but Ron was surprisingly strong.
Harry Potter exclusive: The boy who lived, 19 and former school enemy Ex death eater, Draco Malfoy, 19, made a public truce says a source that was in Lucinda's restaurant last night. They were told to be leaving the men's restroom full of smiles and had even sat at the same table. It was rumoured that Draco was to be a Secretary to Harry at the Ministry for Magic, only time will tell if these two have indeed settled their differences.
Harry turned around and looked at all the Weasleys around the table, it couldn't be a Weasley, could it? It would explain how they know so much about Harry he supposed.
"Harry," Draco whispered into Harry's ear in the early hours of the morning. He shook him lightly, hoping he would stir, but he was snoring so loudly, and in such a deep sleep it called for desperate measures. "OH MY GOD, HERMIONE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" He bellowed putting on a frightened voice of being caught in bed with Harry.
"Why don't you just do it anyway?" Draco suggested to him. "Or tell me who they are and I can ask my father if he has heard from them."
"Hey, what is that supposed to mean?" He asked angrily and then let go and smiled at someone who walked by.
The snake nodded vigorously, and Harry placed the mice on the table, letting go slowly just in case he made a grab for it, he did not.
I have just received trustworthy intel that Theodore Nott has been captured and taken straight to the Ministry holding cells.
Narcissa had been glaring at Harry ever since he had sat down; she had made it clear to both him and Draco that she wasn't going to accept her only son being gay, which apparently didn't bother Draco because he had been holding Harry's hand above the table, which really made her brows furrow.
What was he doing here? Draco asked himself as he stood at the bottom step of Harry Potters home. It was dark outside now, and he should be at home with his family, but instead, he stood outside of Harry Potters home holding a bag of clothes trying to pluck up the nerve to knock on the door and have a civil conversation with his school nemesis. Maybe it can wait till morning; he thought as he turned around to leave, then quickly changed his mind and turned back to the door. Well, this is just silly, he thought.
"Are they writing about you again?" Harry asked leaning his back against the kitchen surface holding a freshly made cup of coffee.
Daphne Greengrass and Tracy Davis from Slytherin, Susan Bones and Wayne Hopkins from Hufflepuff, Padma Patil and Terry Boot from Ravenclaw, Parvati Patil and Neville Longbottom from Gryffindor raised their hands. McGonagall gave a small and small nod writing down the names.
Hermione and Ron had been speaking in whispers now and then while Harry had been thinking about his...date? With Malfoy tomorrow. He was confused about the whole situation.
By this time, Harry was completely at his mercy. “More, Draco. Please,…” Harry’s voice hitched as Draco began to pick up his pace. “Fuck me. Ride me. Use me. I’m yours.” His words broke off in a cry as Draco changed his angle and rubbed right across his prostate. “Yes! Fuck me! Hard…!”
He interviewed with the daily prophet to plug his new Event Planning business which he already has been fully booked for the rest of the year. He managed to book Harry a private weekend away up north away from the madness of the wizarding world.
The atmosphere around the table had changed, Harry had been completely thrown off by Mrs Weasley's question to Ginny. Harry had forgotten entirely, with all the changes in his life that he was engaged to Ginny, and how their relationship had been recently, he wasn't sure if there would be a wedding. He had proposed to her on her 18th birthday and was completely in love with Ginny, but he had soon after regretted it.
Of course, Harry thought. They both met in Madam Malkins getting new robes which seemed too much of a coincidence.
"Are you sassing me?" Harry asked against the nape of Draco's neck. He grabbed hold of his wrists and brought them around the back of the chair; he pulled out his wand and rope shot out the end tying them together.
Draco smiled sheepishly, "Sorry, mother always said the key to making friends was through their stomach."
Astoria Greengrass was waiting for Draco when he Arrived in the Malfoy Manor fireplace; she had her arms folded and a stern look on her face that reminded him of Professor McGonagall. Astoria was Draco's girlfriend, a beautiful brunette with bright green eyes; she always looked graceful with little to no effort. She was also the last person Draco wanted to see right now.
Draco still had his wand raised in his hand; Harry helped him lower it to the ground. "What the fuck, Draco?"
"So Blaise how are things at Gringotts?" He asked with fake interest; he already knew how things were at Gringotts, Draco had friends everywhere.
"I don't know," Mrs Weasley said hesitantly, trying to think it through she did need child care. "I guess a few hours won't do any harm."
"Come on, Stobbs if you go any slower you will be going backwards." Cotton shouted at Katherine. "Potter, you are captain you should be doing this."
Harry watched his eleven-year-old self riding his Nimbus 2000 from his first ever Quidditch match on the front cover. "Unofficial," He corrected him. "I don't even know who J.K.R is or how he got the information for these books."
Harry turned his head towards him slightly. "Sometimes, I haven't been on a broom, in a while, I have been too busy even to attempt it."
Theo shook his head and smirked as Draco strode away, avoiding eye contact with anyone else in the library.
Ron came back and signalled with his hand that the coast was clear. Draco turned to fake Harry, "Hold still, Pertificus totalus," fake Harry was paralysed in the chair. "Ron, untie Harry, I will deal with Nott."
"Yeah, this Sunday, I told her it's a bit late to plan something now, but she thinks with all the progress he has made recently he will be cool with a party."
Harry let go of the buckle and Draco lunged for Robards. Blaise quickly intercepted and with his huge muscles grabbed hold of Draco and moved him out of the way. "No, this is not who you are," Blaise scowled and then turned around to Robards. "I think you should leave."
Harry let out a sharp intake of breath. "I agreed to come to this thing cause I had no choice and now I can't even sit with my friends? Ridiculous."
Robards smiled widely, showing his bright white teeth. "Oh," He chuckled menacingly, rubbing his hands together and then pulled open his desk drawer, taking out a hand full of pictures. "You didn't think the person who took those pictures only took those did you?"  He placed the photos flat on the desk spreading them out so Harry could see them all clearly.
The cafe was a small one hidden down an alley in Diagon Alley, most witches and wizards went to the more popular cafes and bars which was what attracted Draco to it in the first place. There was a young brunette witch that worked there that would always blush and be clumsy when she served Draco; it was still amusing for him to watch, he would sometimes play it up which made it worse.
"Fuck," Harry shouted and kicked his desk making it shift slightly. He checked all his drawers, knowing full well they weren't going to be there, he slumped into his chair and tried to work it out in his head. Was Robards covering up the Death Eater disappearances?
"Sorry," Harry said, frowning slightly. He felt his stomach tighten, had Draco's opinion on Harry changed now?
Draco looked behind her at the grandfather clock it was eight thirty-three. "I am sure you all haven't starved to death in my absence," Draco muttered brushing the soot off his tailored robes.
Harry's twentieth birthday had arrived, and Draco was a nervous wreck, even more so than usual, he had spent the last month organising a surprise birthday party for him, and it had to go perfectly, there wasn't to be a napkin out of place, he reminded himself. He had just got confirmation that the cake was being delivered to The Malfoy Manner at 4 pm, he just hoped none of the house elves got greedy.
Harry sat up straighter in his chair and smoothed out his suit jacket, Draco had wanted that colour but was now glad he didn't as he thought Potter looked absolutely breathtaking in it, though he would never say that out loud.
"I suppose you will just have to deal with it," Harry replied, trying to hide the sadness in his voice. He often heard off Teddy how boring he was, but it still hurt to hear it. He used to want to stay at his house all the time last year, but this year he would rather stay with Mrs Weasley or Andromeda.
"I did not think the world revolved around me," Harry replied through gritted teeth. "So drop it, or I will tell you some home truths."
Draco sighed. "My father thinks you would be trying to find out how I could afford a whole Quidditch team."
"I guess there are no feelings there, I mean I love her but more as a friend, I don't know why I am telling you this, I have never said it to anyone."
Draco didn't respond straight away; he looked as though he was trying to focus his eyes on Harry. "You lied to me," he repeated wobbling on his feet. Harry pulled a chair back and told him to sit down. "No, you lied to me; I will rather stand." He said, sounding like Teddy when he didn't get his way.
"Astoria," Draco quivered taking the glass from him. "She got so weak and so tired she wouldn't open her eyes, and then I felt her go."
Everyone turned their attention to Lucius. "You knew about this?" Narcissa snapped, narrowing her eyes.
Hermione had looked amazing in her long flowing, red ball gown; it hid her growing pregnancy bump really well, so it was impossible to tell she was pregnant.
"I understand that better than anyone, Harry," She replied with a tear in her eye as she went to grab his hand, but thought better of it. "I just think if you come back, you could help the eighth years settle back into school life with my new plan."
Draco hadn't changed his facial expression; he was still staring at the glass. Harry squirmed feeling the hand get a bit too close. "Merlin," He exhaled feeling hot under the collar.
"Yeah, it looks amazing; I am just curious to what your speech meant?" Harry asked furrowing his brows.
"Ronald," she said. "Harry and... Draco, are together now, whether we like it or not, so we have to show Harry we support him."
Hermione left first calling out The Burrow, then Ginny then finally Harry stepped inside taking one last look at his kitchen, hoping it was in the same condition when he got home.
Harry sat uncomfortably next to Draco in his office opposite Pansy Parkinson, who was sitting in Draco's large desk chair. Her eyes were narrowed in thought as she tapped her quill against her chin.
"I for one think it's amazing, Harry," Oliver said across the table. "You're not going to beat our team, but I am sure you will give it a good go."
He felt numb as the ground underneath disappeared, and he was once again spinning through the darkness.
Draco's grey eyes peered over the book; Harry could see he was smirking behind the book. "I am reading, this very boring and overly exaggerated autobiography."
"I know Harry just told me," Blaise replied, wiping the crumbs from the corner of his mouth with his finger.
He saw an empty chair next in between the brunette witch and Draco Malfoy. Eyes turned to look at him as he pulled the chair back and sat down, he was pretty sure at that moment he was standing naked.
Harry stood in the doorway of his messy bedroom holding out his wand, "Scourgify," he said pointing to his floor and watched as the clothes, plates, cutlery and cups vanished until there was an actual floor again. He began using different spells to clean his dirty and greasy windows until the sun shone through them, he took out all the clothes he owned and sorted them back into the wardrobe and drawers.
"Three days ago you and Ron were out chasing after Theodore Nott, you got hit and badly hurt we didn't know what spell had been cast until, well...now. Harry, you have lost 15 years of your memory."
Flashes from reporters' cameras blinded him as he neared the water fountain. "Mister Malfoy, can we ask you some questions?" A short male reporter asked waving a stubby hand.
Draco stared cautiously at it for a moment before he smirked and pushed himself away from the door with his leg. He accepted the present and opened it carefully as not to ruin the paper. A pleased smile appeared on his face as he took off the lid and saw the contents of the box. He took out two gold devices that Harry recognised as the trackers and then a stack of business cards the had a Private eye logo in black and white.
"I don't want you too," Harry shouted back just as loud as Draco was. "I want to be with a Man, not a Monster, which one are you?"
He was back at Hogwarts; in Professor Snape's Defence against the dark arts class, he was staring aimlessly at the board in front of him, he was confused, they were copying down ways to defeat A Malfoy. He was a Malfoy; Snape liked Draco he made sure he was his favourite. He raised his hand. "Do you need the toilet, Potter?" Professor Snape said in a drawl.
Harry gaped at Luna, then felt furious at Ginny and Blaise for even thinking that plan would work. Even though Harry had thought about Draco a few times like that, he felt it was still completely inappropriate to even try getting them together; he was his enemy, they despised each other in school they taunted each other at any chance they could. So why would they even think that them two getting together would be a good idea?
The Carnival had become even busier since they had been on the Ferris Wheel, there seemed to be teenagers everywhere acting like idiots. Draco felt uncomfortable now as he walked next to Harry carrying the unicorn.
"No, Draco, a get to know each other meal between adults, if you can call yourself that," Narcissa sassed.
Astoria took hold of Draco's hand, stopping it from moving, she was leaning in closer to him with her eyes closed; her lips were on his; she was kissing him.
"Yes, I am almost done, and then you can open whenever you want to," Danny replied with a handsome smile on his face, which, if he weren't in love with Harry he would have pounced on him.
Harry had a worrying thought as he sat at the kitchen table early Monday morning with his cup of tea. It was so worrying his face had paled as the realisation had come to him; He was going to be 25 on Sunday. It wasn't as though the year had gone quickly and he wasn't expecting it so soon; it was quite the opposite, the year had dragged, it felt as though his 24th  couldn't be over soon enough.
Everyone he had arrived with had seemed to have split off into different parts of the room, Fred and George were over by the live band most likely requesting songs or pulling pranks. Hermione and Ron had gone to talk to Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas, Ginny and Blaise were stood by the fountain of pumpkin juice, and Harry was standing by the doors with Ernie Macmillan, how did his life become so utterly dull?
Malfoy opened the pouch and pulled out a handful of galleons;  there must have been about forty of them in his hand.  "Woah, that's about £200 you don't need that much,"  Harry advised him, placing his hand between the goblins open hand, and Malfoys hand full of gold.
Blaise scratched the stubble on his chin. "And do your parents know you want to buy this cafe?" He asked.
They stood in front of Goblin who was busy sliding pound coins down a chute.  Malfoy cleared his throat to command the Goblins attention who looked at him irritated.
"Okay, but if he doesn't remember that will be okay too, cause I love him as he is." Hugo ran up to Harry and squeezed him hard.
Lucius leaned back in his chair deep in thought still with a smile on his face this confused Draco even more.
"I guess I panicked, I don't think we would be welcomed with open arms in public, do you? I mean my father, well he hates you...' Draco was hushed by Harry's lips on his.
A letter came flying back through the glass window, Malfoy must have caught on not to send them to Anabel. He opened it with excitement; he felt pretty rebellious sneaking letters to each other under the nose of the ministry.
"I wasn't going to come after you when I came out, until that day your husband paid me a visit and tried to use the cruciatus curse on me, and then I realised little Malfoy would do anything for Mr Potter."
"I didn't know how to feel about you and Mr Malfoy being together," Mr Weasley continued ignoring Harry's escape. "I know you two have a long history of hating each other; I didn't want him to end up having ulterior motives."
"Just think about it," Robards said standing up and fastening his robes. "You might change your mind after a good nights sleep."
"Ouch, Potter," He heard a man mumble and groan next to him. He turned his head to see sleepy grey eyes glaring at him and wearing what looks to be his round glasses.
"I really promise, you can sleepover anytime you want, we can fly our brooms around your grandma's on a Sunday."
The conversation he and Harry and this morning played through his mind, and he felt even worse, "why am I such a dick?" He sighed sinking into the sofa in the sitting room, "I just need to solve this case, then take Harry on a long vacation."
Harry also kept his promise to Mrs Weasley and has not missed a Sunday dinner since they had returned from America.
He Harry his hands over the pale soft form, caressing the compact and well-defined muscles. One hand snaked around the narrow waist to stroke the small of Harry’s back, gently pressing him forward. His other hand reached up and began to play with a pale pink nipple.
He walked down the stone stairs into the surprisingly large basement. He wasn't expecting there to be as much stuff down there as there turned out to be.
His mother would often purse her lips as to begin to speak, then lift up her own glass of wine and drink from it. His father, however, was actually, pleasantly calm, he had definitely made a potion.
He looked at the now brick wall next to the fireplace, thinking about how he trusted Draco to go down into his basement and get his potion. He has never let anyone down there apart from Ron and Hermione, who helped him organise it, so it didn't look like the room of requirement.
"Now, I will not be making the final decision on my own, the new manager is going to be joining me and observing everyone carefully," Cotton said shifting his eyes around the people that were still there, his eyes caught on to Harry's and widened.
"I'd like to see you try, Potter," Draco replied, tilting his head back, so it rested against Harry's stomach. "You haven't got the balls to arrest me."
Harry lay on the cold stone kitchen floor looking up at the ceiling, Morty was sprawled next to him resting his head on his stomach. He had been laid there for the past three hours since he had finished work, he didn't feel like he deserved comfort.
Malfoy ignored him and moved to the four poster bed getting on his hands and knees and looked underneath; Harry felt embarrassed for even asking, he thought he must have imagined it or maybe it was a mistake. His eyes widened as he watched Malfoy on the ground his shirt and waistcoat were riding up his torso as he crawled halfway under the bed, the rim of his boxers poked out his trouser band. He bit his lip.
The Sorting Hat's poem was a lot shorter than the one from his sixth year, and not as much doom and gloom, he spoke of the danger being gone, so it was time for some fun; it also reminded them to come together and not drift apart.
A weird feeling hit him on the left side as he came down the stairs with only a towel covering the lower half of his wet body. All his Auror training told him there was someone in his house, and where was his wand when he needed it. "Accio wand," He muttered under his breath. Moments later he felt the cold wood hit his fingertips as he tread quietly through his house.
"I think you are all being ridiculous," Harry began. "We have all been a family for most of our lives, and we are spending our time arguing over something that has been resolved. Ron what you did was an accident, but you should have told us then it wouldn't have escalated this far. I am lucky to have my memories back; we should be celebrating not try to kill each other..."
"Harry, you don't need to apologise," Seamus, said cutting him off. "We were both drunk, you maybe more than me, but I understood what you were going through at the time, we were together all the time, then it was just something that happened."
"I am not having this conversation with you right now," Lucius looked exhausted by the conversation but still had the energy to be a dick.
Draco scoffed and turned his back on them to face the cake again. It was too difficult to watch. He heard a gasp and then a moan. He squeezed his eyes shut trying to focus on the music playing; why did it have to be Celestina Warbeck?
"Have you seen a tall blonde haired man in here recently? Or Man with brown hair and glasses with an unusual scar on his forehead?" He heard Edwin say.
"I wore that on my birthday last year," Harry said quietly, he never wanted to wear that suit again.
If anyone could convince Harry it was a good idea to go tonight, it would be Hermione, and he was going to need all her hard stares and bossy attitude she could muster to convince him.
"This must be for you," Harry said stretching out the trophy in his hand the to the now paled Draco.
At 6 pm Harry went to Hermione and Ron's house. He left Morty at home this time he still didn't know why Morty was in such a bad mood and how he was feeding himself.
Draco walked through the kitchen and around the corner to where he saw Blaise sat on an armchair with Ginny on his lap. The twins Fred and George were writing on a large scroll of parchment in the corner; it looked like smoke was about to start coming from the ends of the quills.
"I understand that Draco, but I think it's best if Harry comes with you," Mr Weasley replied calmly.
"Draco, are you going to tell them who you picked as the seeker?" Astoria spoke, and Draco's stomach dropped.
"Do you need any money out of your vault?"  He asked Malfoy as they neared closer to the Muggle exchange desk.
"Do you mind telling me where we are going?" Harry asked following him down the stairs of the cottage.
"... It's bad enough you have to work with Potter, I don't know why you put up with it, I would have told Weasley to stick his job where the sun doesn't shine..." His father carried on in the background, but Draco wasn't paying attention to him, he just nodded and shook his head in response but thought about Harry and the lunch they had the previous day.
He looked a mess; he looked as Harry felt; his hair was ruffled; he looked like he had been sleeping rough for the past week. "What are you doing here?" He repeated moving closer to him and held the back of a chair for support; he also realised he was only in his boxers. "Have you been drinking?"
Bill flicked his wand, and the chalkboard and then desk moved out the way to make room for what was to be an exciting duel. They stood opposite ends of the classroom, facing each other after they had taken a bow. Malfoy stepped forward first waving his wand as red sparks from Stupefy were cast towards Bill, who had easily blocked it and sent a silent, Full Body-Bind back which took no effort on Malfoy's end to prevent.
The game was in full swing as the chaser on his team Angelina Johnson had the quaffle tightly in her grasp and was being followed closely by the other team's chaser Ben Forrester. She threw the quaffle towards the goal posts, and it rang through the middle loop scoring their team 10 points. Jimmy was on team two her hit a bludger towards team one's keeper as Ben went to throw the Quaffle into a loop, but the keeper dived and hit the Quaffle with his broom tail.
"Christmas day," She said sarcastically. "The Masquerade Ball on Saturday, the one we graciously volunteered to host, thanks to your father." She glared at Lucius.
He sat down in the small cafe down one of the alleys and was shortly greeted by his best friend, Ron Weasley. He hadn't thought about meeting him for lunch as they rarely got to see each other at work, Ron was usually out chasing after petty thieves.
Just as he was about to say something to Harry, a hand shot up next to him. "Who is the new manager?" Jimmy asked when Cotton allowed him to speak.
"No," Hermione answered. "If the younger students see we can put aside our differences and live together, then they will try doing the same."
"Yeah, I just don't want to have to face Robards today. I know he is going to pull me into the office," Harry replied giving a small shrug.
Harry woke up alone in his private hospital room; it was now filled with flowers, get well soon cards and balloons. He saw the daily prophet newspaper on the chair next to him opened up on the crosswords page with a black quill against the fold, he hadn't been alone.
Draco turned around, happy by the distraction. The little house elf --Juno he thought her name was-- handed him a letter.
Harry heard loud, choked sobs and whimpers behind him. An Auror released Draco's restraints, and instead of Narcissa putting up a fight to stay, she kept hold of her son's hand and left shakily with two of the Aurors.
"There is a cafe I go to for my lunch, and he is there all time, sometimes he is with his girlfriend."
"Come on, let's get this over with," His mother muttered to him as they walked down the carpet to stand in front of the backdrop. His father wore a black and silver half face mask that only showed the bottom half of his mouth, whereas Draco and his mother both wore eye masks; his being the emerald green he brought at Madam Malkins that matched Harry's and his mothers were black and silver to match her husbands.
The sound of Hermione and Mrs Weasley squealing broke the shocked silence, and then Ginny was attacked with hugs and kisses from her mother. "Oh Ginny, I knew it, I had a feeling, I am so proud! Head Girl! That's nearly the whole family now. Oh, Ginny, I just knew it."
Harry joined the rest of the team and took off into the air, it was usually a rush of joy Harry would get the first time he raised of the ground, but today he was miserable.
Mrs Weasley sat put in her place frowning at him she then turned her attention to fussing about Ron's uniform being scruffy. Harry sent silent thanks across the table to Oliver who smiled and nodded in return. They continued to eat their food trying to avoid taboo conversation, which was quite difficult where Mrs Weasley was concerned.
They rubbed their bodies together, erections hard and taut between them. Harry nibbled on Draco's ear, his lover gasping, and Draco cupped the peachy arse and squeezed, Harry, moaning in his ear. Harry poured all his love for his boyfriend into his kisses. Draco's body moved beneath him, passion building between them.
The length of Harry’s cock protruded in a tight bulge behind those trousers; it strained to be free, pushed hard against Draco’s ass. Harry groped for Draco’s hands and squeezed them. He lifted them back and slapped them against the wall. The shock of it stung Draco’s palms. He could feel the reverberation of the slap travel into his forearms, his elbows, ride high into his shoulders where Harry’s forehead lay pressed against him.
Draco pulled his wand out and pointed it at the gate casting a nonverbal spell to reveal any enchantments it may have on it. The gates illuminated a dark red colour and then broke open.  He waved his wand in front of the now open gates; there was a shimmering mist appearing which told him it was not going to be easy to get through.
When he finally entered the common room, he noticed how different it was from the Slytherins it was decorated with Silver and Gold Drapes, and it was a lot lighter as it wasn't in the dungeons under water. The sofas around the fireplace looked a lot comfier also; Potter and his Gryffindors were currently occupying them. The Ravenclaws were sat around the large table in the corner already studying, by the looks of it and there was only a couple of the Hufflepuff girls sat on the floor next to the bookcase drinking Firewhisky.
"It's nothing to do with Potter!" Draco snapped, rising to his feet. He closed his eyes and held the bridge of his nose trying to compose himself. "I'm sorry; I didn't mean to shout at you."
"Not with you in my room, it could be private," Draco replied thinking it was something from Borgin and Burkes.
Ron cleared his throat, "We need to get him out of here still, and there is a big guy in the kitchen knocked out."
Harry looked ahead and saw Theodore Nott running ahead. "I can see him," He shouted and ran after him to get closer. "Expelliarmus," He missed.
"Not that it is any of your business, but Potter and I were tying up loose ends in our case." Draco lied hoping to sound convincing.
Draco was sat in the kitchen of 12 Grimmauld Place surrounded by redheads; he had his mother's hand held tightly in his. Hermione had called a family meeting as soon as they had left the hospital, against Draco's wishes, but it was very difficult to argue with Granger.
Draco managed to wiggle himself free from her sharp fingernailed clutch. "I am fine, mother, I have just been with Blaise and at work."
"It was a last minute decision," Harry replied confidently, not wanting to feel intimidated by Mr Malfoy.
Harry sighed. "I will speak to him and see if I can bargain with him, he seems to want something, and I doubt he would be hanging this over our heads if he didn't want anything."
Draco shot him a glare, "You...Nevermind," he paused then took off his glasses. "No, actually I will say it, why shouldn't I get revenge on Ron, does he realise the damage he has caused this past couple of weeks?"
He filled his hands with the stuff, though he wasn’t sure how much he needed to use, and he started to work it into Draco’s ass. He avoided the puckered lips of Draco’s arsehole but knew that just lotion on him wasn’t going to be enough. He was going to need to lube inside Draco too. It was either lube it or leave it, and Harry didn’t really want to go this far, do this much, without at least getting what he really wanted.
"It's good, yeah, doing much better now, took twice as much this year, now more kids are going back to Hogwarts," George smiled. "Hoping to get Halloween orders filling up in the next couple of weeks."
The end of the day couldn't have come sooner when Cotton had told them to go hit the showers. Harry was relieved and was the first one off his broom. He sped across the pitch and under the tunnel into the changing rooms, on his way he saw Draco's office, the door was slightly ajar, so he glanced inside.
Teddy laughed and shook his head vigorously and his hair changed to pink. "No, no, no, don't be silly."
When they were halfway to Hogwarts, the food trolley finally arrived, and Draco's stomach was grumbling. "Anything to eat?" The Trolley woman asked.
“Great,” Draco replied in a distant voice. “Have you just come to bother me about chocolate frogs and bedroom organisation, or is there something you actually wanted?”
"Right, so Weasley, Zabini pair up," He called, banging one of the desks. "Next we have, Boot and Nott, Granger and Greengrass, Potter and Malfoy."
Draco painfully opened his eyes; he looked from the shocked crowd to Seamus with his mouth around Harry's cock and Harry looking mortified back to the crowd, where Mrs Weasley who was at the very front looking like she was about to faint. Ginny and Blaise were stood at separate ends red-faced.
"Well you were a Death Eater, they always refer to you this way what's different about today?" Harry asked cautiously but looked frightened when Draco's eyes darkened.
Harry was tied to a chair when the spell had worn off, he didn't know where he was, but it looked like a ballroom. There was another chair next to his, empty.
Harry rocked his hips, leaning forward and licking at Draco’s neck. Harry felt Draco grow even harder in his hand.
"Thank you for coming in at short notice, Harry," Kingsley said sitting down at his desk. "Happy birthday, by the way."
"Mr Weasley is a great a boss, I will have you know, he works hard and has built a strong team," Draco said defensively.
"Well, in that case, Draco is doing a good thing by refurbishing it, I have been in there nearly every day, it was so worn out," Harry had enough of her giving him a hard time and decided it was time to step in. He felt Draco squeeze his lap and saw a small smile out the corner of his eye.
The door jingled open as he walked inside announcing they had a customer, he heard Madam Malkin tell him she would be with him shortly as she was on her own today. Harry decided to have a browse around at the robes, he didn't want to dress to impress Ernie, but he did want something that looked good on him. The store was split into male and female sections he walked over to the men's section which was smaller than the female section. He avoided the school robes and went to the more high-end suits and robes hoping to see something that would flatter him.
"Good morning, Mr Potter, what are you doing all the way down here?" Robards said in a false happy tone.
The door of the cafe jingled open, and Draco turned his head quickly to see Harry Potter walking through the door, looking slightly wet. It was pouring down outside, and it was very common in this part of England apparently.
Harry frowned at him; he wondered why Malfoy was talking to him about Quidditch; maybe he was going to take his captaincy seriously. "Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw don't usually do their Tryouts till the week after, they have an extra two weeks till their first match," Harry whispered.
“Not scared, Potter, it’s just a stupid ride,”  Malfoy replied, eyeing it up and down and grimacing.
"I still think Malfoy is up to something," Harry said, dropping his book on the arm of the chair, it wasn't the first time he had said this, he had been saying it every day ever since he had seen him that night. It had been playing on his mind; he knew Malfoy was a Death Eater now, no one would believe him, even Dumbledore was shutting him down.
"Yes, I do," Draco replied in a bored tone now, it sounded like he had been having this conversation all week.
He looked at Draco, looked at Draco watching him fuck his own hand, and motioned for him to turn over. When he did, and that bare arse was in the air, Harry nearly fucked himself to the sight Then Draco propped it in the air, offered it to Harry, and Harry grabbed the lotion again.
"You just say, 'ask me no questions and I will tell you no lies', It's a safety precaution we thought was pretty clever," George said, taking the bottle from Harry and putting it back in the safe. "It should be ready by the first Hogsmeade visit."
He looked Ernie up and down, the blondish hair he was used to seeing was darker now due to the amount of the slickeazy hair potion he had probably applied to his head. He was wearing navy blue robes which were probably two sizes too big for him. He wore a gormless smile which made Harry want to punch him in the face.
They approached a large canopy that had a glittery black floor and about twenty different coloured small cars inside. There were a few people already lined up by the ticket booth waiting to have a go.
"I know a lot about you Harry, I told you before, I like to know who I am working with," Draco said matter of factly and then locked his fingers together and rested them under his chin leaning in towards Harry. "Anyway, how are you?"
After successfully putting his mother to bed next to his passed out father, he went to his closet and flourished through the hangers looking the perfect outfit for Harry to wear.
"Right, well Mr Malfoy if you go back into your dressing room, I will go find that material for the collar, Mr Potter you can go try that suit on in that dressing room," she pointed to the empty dressing room next Malfoy and hurried to the back of the shop.
"Yes, but we went through a whole war together; you would think that would make you realise we are ready for any problem."
His face reddened as he realised what he said and that he had probably upset Parvati, who has always been so kind to him.
"What if someone took the snake off the handle and then did something to the door knocker, cause they knew we were investigating."
Pansy let out a noise of frustration and strutted away like she was on a runway, almost banging into the place where Harry was hidden under his cloak.
"Yes, unfortunately," Draco replied bitterly cutting up his jacket and pouring the cheese from his chips on top. "It's like we are being punished for having feelings."
Draco cleared his throat and put on his best sincere smile. "No, of course not, I am just being silly." He leaned over and kissed him on the lips. "You deserve the award; you were so fucking sexy in that suit."
"Just sit down Potter, we aren't going to bite," Zabini said, but his smile deceived him. "We are just about to play exploding snap if you want in?"
They sat at the kitchen table eating Harry's famous bacon sandwiches. Morty rested his head on the surface eagerly waiting for bacon; Harry had finally realised Draco was the one that was supplying Morty his food.
Three days ago his biggest problems were a newspaper writing his age incorrectly which now seems irrelevant as his biggest challenge now was his husband doesn't remember they love each other.
The cafe door jingle open and a man with long brown hair tied in a ponytail walked inside. "Shit, get under the table," Draco whispered, slipping quickly underneath the square table, he yanked at the hem of Harry's trousers to come under also. "It's Edwin."
"You did the right thing mate," Ron said after he picked his jaw up. "You never know with Malfoy he says he has changed, but a Malfoy is a Malfoy."
Harry grabbed his Draco's chin and slowly turned it back toward him. Leaning back in he kissed him softly closing his eyes taking in every second of the kiss.
The last week of the summer trials was upon the Wizengamot, and it was the one Harry Potter was anxious to testify to. The Malfoy Family’s trial had been held off until this point, and it was the trial that was getting the most press. They were being called traitors and disgraces from both sides, which no one could disagree with, as they had indeed switched sides right before Voldemort’s eventual demise.
"She has been trying to help me," He said earnestly. "Both me and Ron, but I don't know; we spent so much time together during the last year, practically living on top of each other, she hasn't had much alone time with Ron. I thought maybe if you taught me, I might pick it up better."
There was a glistening light in the distance which he followed curiously. A cabinet filled with glass vials lit up in front of him next to a silver bowl filled with shimmering liquid. "How the fuck did Potter get a Pensieve?" He muttered to himself angrily.
He had spent the next few days cleaning and redecorating every room in his house trying to take his mind off of losing Ginny and Draco. He knew he never really had Draco to begin with, but they had just started to get on, he was worried that Draco would now kick him off the team, maybe it would be for the best if he left himself.
"For three weeks, I assumed the daily prophet would be all over my birthday meltdown." He shrugged again. "But when I got back there was no mention of me or my birthday."
They walked down the carriage, Ginny taking the lead looking in each window for an empty compartment. When they got to the last one, it was Malfoy's and his friends, who were either asleep or reading a book.
Draco looked at her pink cheeks then to the quill and parchment in her hand. "Not yet, I am meeting someone."
He proceeded to tell the Wizengamot about how Draco had not handed his true identity over to his Aunt Bellatrix and how he was lowering his wand on the Astronomy tower the night Dumbledore died.
"You were thinking about something; I could see it in your eyes," Draco smirked dipping his quill into a pot of ink and then continued writing his letter.
?" Harry asked again. Draco could see his eyes had turned dark, his face hard. The change was visible—evident when Harry pressed himself harder against Draco.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "What kind of questions?" Draco asked knowing full well from Harry that Fred and George liked to ask intrusive questions.
They spent the next half an hour in complete silence apart from the odd, no, yes and don't even think about it. Harry had only managed to mess up the potion once and finally began feeling more comfortable working with Draco; he was actually quite patient with him after the first mistake.
"No worries, just grabbing some bits," Harry told her, all the sneaking about made him feel like he should justify why he was entering his office.
Narcissa scoffed and shook her head. "He has been sent a rare plant so he is "experimenting" with it in his study."
"Shit, sorry," Malfoy said, closing the curtains again. "Make sure Weasley, takes his potion tonight and put silencing charms on his bed."
Harry looked for his wand; it was the other side of the kitchen, it was too late he hit the ground and was being dragged into the fireplace by Nott's heavy man.
"Ah fuck," Harry cried out when he stood on a fork on the floor, he picked it up and threw it against the wall near the bathroom door, "Stupid thing."
"Can we talk about this another time?" Harry asked not in the mood to discuss what happened without revealing the whole of his birthday party antics.
Harry had woken up to Morty hissing down his ear begging for food, and he wasn't in the mood to take orders from the snake. He looked at the clock on the bedside table it was only 7:20 he groaned and rolled over, it was his day off, he deserved his sleep. "Go find your own food," Harry muttered in Parseltongue to Morty and then closed his eyes again. Unfortunately, his order was ignored as the snake hissed to him again and wrapped his long body around his arm and squeezed tightly. "Morty, I have told you multiple times not to squeeze me." Morty squeezed tighter. "Fine, you win, I am up," Harry opened his eyes and sat up, and felt Morty unwrap himself from his arm.
Harry couldn't help it he burst out laughing, which luckily she saw the funny side of it too and laughed with him. "I am sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you," Harry said awkwardly.
"There you go again; why are you so angry?" Draco exhaled deeply before speaking again. "You know what, forget it, I thought we were becoming friends, but I guess I just imagined it."
All four tables rose, and chatter broke out again as everyone filed out of the Great Hall, leaving the Eighth Years alone with all the teachers watching them.
Draco looked around the room and saw an overly sized wooden chair; he felt like a child as he sat on it and his legs dangled over, not touching the ground.
"Enough," Mr Weasley shouted, slamming both hands on the desk. "I wasn't asking; I was telling, now if you will both stop glaring at each other and listen you can close the case by the end of the day."
Draco sat up too. “No, I want to leave, with you, we can go anywhere we want to go, another country away from the people that will judge us the most,” He paused. “Just you and me.”
"Right ladies and gentlemen, we won't get training done on the ground," Cotton had walked onto the pitch and was carrying his broom and an armband. "I am going to be looking out for a captain over the next few practices, so I want teamwork, leadership and accuracy."
"You deserve to be in a job that appreciates you and who better than yourself," Harry teased and was greeted with a warm embrace.
"What is it?" Draco asked, seeing a still image of colours orange, reds, yellows and bits of green; he couldn't really understand what the image was though.
"Yes, I will have the jacket potato with tuna and cheese, but no salad and a side of chips," Draco ordered not looking at the menu. "Also, cheese on the chips."
He decided to get out of bed, which caught the attention of Zabini, who just nodded his head at him.
"Isn't father helping you?" Draco asked and then realised how stupid the question was when he finished.
Harry opened the cupboard under the stairs and pulled out two broomsticks, one being the polished, jet black Firebolt and the other a standard knobbly broomstick, that reminded him of his first year at Hogwarts. He took the Firebolt from the displeased Harry.
Draco was slumped into the red leather chair sipping his fourth glass of wine that evening; he was alone in the study staring mindlessly at the bookcase in front of him, he had an argument with Astoria when he had gotten home from the Cafe that day. She was questioning him like she usually did when she had no idea where he was even though he only ever goes to the cafe or to the stadium.
He took Harry's hand and looked him in the eyes. "I need you to know if anything gets out of hand tonight, my feelings for you won't change, and if my parents don't like that, well I will move out and buy my own house."
They sat down on an empty picnic bench surrounded by Muggles eating together in groups; children were running in circles on the grass screaming and giggling.
Draco rubbed viciously at his forehead and took a deep breath. "Make it Thursday, and I will pay you an extra 100 Galleons."
"Yes, I wanted to put my money into something good. When I heard Appleby Arrows was going to be taken out of Quidditch altogether, I knew I had to buy it. I have always loved Quidditch since I was a boy, and if you didn't forget I was a seeker for my house, which contrary to what you believe I didn't buy my way on."
"I am going to put him to bed," He told them and then carried him to up the stairs to his bedroom. It was decorated with pale blue walls and white clouds to make it look like the sky; they had been enchanted to move around the room slowly. He watched him for a moment as he slept feeling the love he had for his Godson grow stronger, and feel emotional over the fact they both never had a chance to have a proper family. "Sweet dreams, Teddy."
"It's a little hard to concentrate with your... when your hands are..." He cleared his throat, suddenly electrically aware of his own nudity. Running a hand through his hair, he had to laugh.
"You're right I could have," Lucius smirked. He stepped inside carrying a neatly wrapped brown package.
"Yeah, could be worse, could be Malfoy," Ron laughed his eyes following Malfoy as he walked through the door. Harry uncrossed his legs and kicked Ron's shin. "Ouch. Sorry, didn't mean to offend your boyfriend."
The box jolted slightly as it began to move slowly again, but they didn't make any attempt to stop what they were doing as they were tongues deep into each other.
Harry felt the blood rise to his cheeks. Malfoy glanced at them stony-faced and padded upstairs. "Shut up, Roody."
Harry's lips curled up at the mention of it being his home. It was true, of course, and the thought of returning to Hogwarts,  free of any threat of Voldemort, was more appealing than he would have thought possible. Maybe he would finally get to have his first quiet year.
"Probably in the kitchens trying to pinch food," She sighed tapping him back towards the photographers.
It was a full house in the Burrow; Harry was in deep conversation with Charlie and Oliver Wood, who had been engaged for three years now and had yet to set a date. They were the first ones to know Harry was gay, though Harry hadn't come out officially or even accepted it for himself, they would always drop hints that they knew something into conversation with him. At first, he thought it odd, but then he soon realised what they were doing and would turn bright red when they would say something, they weren't malicious, he thinks they were just trying to let him know that they knew.
When they passed the war memorial, it turned into the statue of Harry as a baby with his parents. It had been decorated with birthday banners; That changed between "Happy Birthday and "Harry Potter."
"You don't understand," He cried. "I let her down, I was making out with you when she needed me most."
"I thought you were detaining me?" Draco replied, moving his lips down Harry's jawline to the nape of his neck, kissing, nipping, licking and biting.
Draco frowned but was feeling quite amused. Harry stepped forward, pulling out his own wand and muttered a spell under his breath, stepping back slightly. The mist crackled, and like putting parchment to flame, embers were burning away in pieces and falling slowly to the ground.
"Nope, it's my birthday present to you," He replied lowering his voice. Harry understood what was going on now, he was remembering, this was Draco's birthday in 2006.
"How long can we have fun for before something gets leaked before one of our friends lets it slip? There were at least thirty people here last night; it only takes one of them to say something."
"I am not embarrassed at all," Draco told her looking up from his plate that he had been counting the crumbs off. "I don't see why I should be embarrassed; I had a job to do, if The Prophet wants to spin their little story, let them, we have had far worse said about us than being associated with Harry Potter, don't forget what they said when you were sent to Azkaban for your invo..."
"This is incredible," Harry said as he walked over to the stiff looking blonde, and kissing him. "It's perfect."
Draco was asking questions and writing vigorously full of excitement not realising fifteen minutes had passed, and he hadn't heard a peep from the kitchen until Ron and Hermione came through the door.
He felt Harry's teeth bite his lip softly, then suck it gently. Draco stifled a moan as he felt a twitch in his pants. Harry's free hand was travelling up his jumper and stroking his chest.
"But why did it have to be Potter? I thought you would have at least gone for someone who wasn't the fucking chosen one."
Mrs Weasley let go one last time, and Ron and Hermione came over and gave him a group hug. "Happy Birthday," they said together, beaming at him.
"Fine, I had taken the gillyweed that Dobby had given me and then gills appeared, I swam through the black lake following the sound of the merpeople singing to the village. When I got there, I saw Ron and Hermione were tied up along with Cho and Fleurs sister who was in an enchanted sleep. I thought they were in danger and nobody was coming along to save them." Harry closed his eyes trying to remember what happened next. "I think Cedric came first and saved Cho and then Victor, who had half transfigured into a shark; he rescued Hermione which left me with Ron and Gabrielle. I waited as long as I could, but Fleur didn't come, so I took them both."
Harry flashed a brilliant smile. "That I can do. Take a seat, and I will cook you the best bacon sandwich this side of Godric's Hollow."
Harry picked up his pyjamas and started getting undressed, while Ron had stormed out the room to shower. Malfoy peeled back the side of his curtains, seemingly annoyed at the banging and storming around. Harry stood frozen in his boxers halfway putting his shirt on.
Watching Harry in his pleasure, how his fingers were playing with his nipple gave Draco an idea. He drew back from his lover, gently removing their hands from their cocks. Green eyes drifted open, dazed and confused, as he laid Harry back on the bed.
"You dare talk to me like that in my own house?" Lucius barked his wand hand was shaking, Draco couldn't tell if it was age or that he was being challenged by his own son.
"You know Potter well, yes?" The question spilt out of his mouth; he knew he should have carried on out of the door.
"She doesn't spend time with them cause she enjoys it, she is there for Blaise you know he sees them as a second family since he lost his."
Draco felt a sigh of relief fall over him but wondered why this was still an issue if there were no more photos. "Are there other copies out there?"
"Thank you," He replied, and she left the room, closing the office door behind her. Harry unfolded the letter and read the neatly written handwriting.
Harry had slumped into the kitchen table chair and took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. "Just been a long, odd day."
It only took one twitch of Draco—one large twitch of his hand—and Harry started bucking again. He rammed his cock as deep as it would go, as hard as he could, into Draco’s ass. When Draco screamed, Harry moaned. When Draco pushed, Harry pumped. And when Draco came on his hand, Harry came in Draco’s arse.
"Then what happened?" Ginny said urging him to continue as she paced back and forth in front of him.
Draco stood up quickly avoiding his mother's gaze and walked over to the fireplace staring into the flames. "What do you know?"
Draco waited in the common room for it to get closer to one am but the time was dragging, and the blowjob Pansy was giving him was doing nothing for him. He was surprised he managed to get hard enough her. He eventually faked an orgasm and pushed her off of him.
"We know that obviously, but there will be others like Potter that don't," Lucius grimaced when saying his name.
He felt a jolt behind him as a gold car bashed into him. He scowled at the male Muggle and turned his wheel and bashed into it as it went past. The rush was incredible; he thought as he felt the impact. He bashed into a silver vehicle next and then the blue one he was almost caught up to Potter he put his whole weight onto the pedal and was now right behind him.
Draco walked out of The Manor fireplace as quietly as possible. It was a little after one in the morning, and his Parents were usually asleep by now, and even though they would probably have not heard him, given the size of The Manor; the act of sneaking home in the middle of the night, after not telling them where he had been for the past few nights seemed like an appropriate thing to do. It seemed silly considering he had turned 25 last month and had been of age and free to do what he liked without his parent's permission for years.
"Fuck off," Draco yelled, grabbing one of the pillows under Harry's head and throwing it at the overly awake and annoying Blaise.
They were now walking into the Weasley house there was a sign on the door politely telling people to stick to the garden and the marquee. The inside looked the same as it had when he went to their house for dinner, with all its organised chaos.
"You were the one who brought him up," Draco snapped which made his mother let out somewhat of a snort. "Is there dessert coming or not?"
"Yeah," Annabel shrugged. "He said you were late handing them in so he would do it for you, which was..."
"Harry, it's good to see you," Mrs Weasley called pulling him out of the fireplace and into a loving hug.
"Well, I wasn't aware of a positioning opening up in The Ministere des Affaires Magiques; which if there were they would usually promote internally."
They turned around to see Harry standing there, awkwardly. “Look, Teddy, it’s your Godfather, Has he come to take you to Aunt Molly's? Has he?” Andromeda said in her best baby talk voice, which made Teddy smile and dribble.
He curled his fingers against the back of Harry's skull and angled his head so he could kiss the man in front of him.
Harry bent down and picked the nearest one up. “Did you know when he was stripped of his Chief Warlock position and kicked off the Wizengamot, the only thing he was worried about was being taken off the chocolate frog cards?”
"Of course you want children, everyone wants children, men tend to after they are born, but still, you can't deny your parents of grandchildren."
Draco stayed close by Harry as the ballroom erupted into chaos as witches and wizards were looking around for their friends and family to catch up after their meal. He brushed his fingers against Harry's a few times to let him know he was there and was so tempted to drag him away to his bedroom and have his way with him.
The crowd applauded, and there were flashes from the cameras again as Draco pulled out his wand and waved it at the blank space where the cafe name should be. The new letters began to form; there was the sound of gasps and ooh's as the new name "The Tea Dragon" had appeared in bold black lettering. Draco flicked his wand again and an image of a moving dragon, breathing fire appeared next to the sign which awarded him another round of applause.
Harry had spent the next day tidying up the study after Draco had trashed it looking for the tracker. Most of the stuff in the drawer Harry already knew what it was and where it came from, he thought Draco must have told him to move his junk somewhere else, and it ended up in the enchanted drawer.
Draco was still for a few minutes, almost statue-like, Harry observed how pale and gaunt he looked. He had dark circles under his eyes; he looked like he hadn't slept in months.
"She is trying to find a rule against Slughorns assignment," Ron told him, shaking his head and rolling his eyes. "I keep telling her he has been doing it for years."
"He probably has had too much to drink," Lucius piped in. "I hear that happens to people with traumatic pasts."
“Draco,” Harry said. “Oh—“ and he felt himself start to shudder. Felt his balls tighten. Felt his cock tighten. And he stilled.
"No," Harry replied with a hint of annoyance. "I am telling you, I don't need you as my secretary anymore, maybe you should take this box and make a career out of it." He took out a medium size neatly wrapped brown paper package from his drawer with a bow tied around it.
He repeated the process for all remaining printers and checked for back up devices to make sure there was no way they couldn't print any more papers until 'safe' to do so.
"Are you asking if finding out who cast a memory charm on Harry, is worth it?" Draco's hand tightened around the wand in his pocket.
Harry grabbed up his invisibility cloak and wand and left through the portrait hole, hardly making out a goodbye to Ron and Hermione.
Draco hadn't slept well last night; he had left Potter's house confused, angry and upset. He hadn't meant to make Harry angry he was only laughing with him, he had thought they had gotten closer over the past week, he didn't expect to have been thrown out of his house. He wasn't even that bothered that he had walked in on him naked, but choosing out a suit and its goodbye Malfoy.
"Um, no, practice ran pretty late, so I never got a chance to," she replied clearly lying which made Draco angry and upset for Harry.
He placed his hand on the glass, and it slid slowly open, he let go and took a cautious step back. The porcelain black cat on the shelf came to life as it noticed a disturbance and began to move off the shelf, Draco took his wand out and quickly stunned it back to a lifeless ornament.
Draco sat around the dining room table in The Malfoy Manor with his parents sat side by side still looking as happy as they always did. They had organised Christmas this year as Draco needed a break from planning anything, he was frankly sick of christmas this year as he had spent the whole of December planning clients work Christmas parties, Christmas weddings and even Hogwarts staff Christmas party.
"Are you into him?" Ron asked, but Harry could tell he wasn't on board with the idea of Harry and Malfoy being together.
"Excellent, we can discuss arrangements next time you and Blaise come around for couples night?" Draco suggested.
Harry heard him muttering in disgust and throwing things out the doors, landing on the floor, making a mess. There was a lot of swearing as well.
"So what it says about starting a family is true?" Draco's expression had softened to the Draco he loved and not the angry, hateful man that walked into the kitchen.
"Oh did I forget to tell you?" Draco said nonchalantly holding his hand in front of him and perusing his fingers. "We have to do an interview with Pansy Parkinson later today."
When Harry woke up the next day, he sent Malfoy's owl back with no note, though he felt like sending him a snarky reply.
"Harry and I are going to be figuring out how to take down Robards," Draco replied, shooting a sharp look at his father as it was his fault they were in this mess. "If you have any suggestions on how to get photo's back off him, please add your input."
Harry Potter exclusive: Last night Auror, Harry Potter, 19 and Ex-Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, 20, celebrated Draco's 20th birthday. It was said to be an all-out party with Harry's two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger-Weasley, Draco's lifelong best friend Blaise Zabini, his mother, Narcissa Malfoy, The Weasley family and few Hogwarts friends. A source that was at the party has confirmed the announcement of Draco and Harry are officially moving in together; there is no news as of yet if Harry is moving to the Malfoy Manor or If Draco is moving to the late Black home, I will keep you updated on all things Harry Potter.
"Oh good, you should definitely make the team, they would be crazy to turn Harry Potter down," Jimmy beamed.
"For example, Blaise and Ginny are throwing a house party at their home tomorrow night, and we have been invited, I want to go, and you are going to come also," Draco smirked at the outrage and protest that now appeared on Harry's face.
Harry and Draco looked at each other for a moment, and Harry let out a deep sigh of hesitation. "Something happened to me earlier," Harry began. "And I have my memories back."
"I wasn't looking for you; I was looking for, Weasley and then I saw that woman and thought you must be in."
"To Harry and Ron," Hermione raised her glass to toast her boyfriend and her best friend. "I'm so proud of you both."
"We can tell him another time," Hermione said then turned to Harry who hadn't been listening and was in a world of his own. "Thanks for dinner Harry."
Harry sighed. "Are you being serious? Shouldn't I being Head Auror have a decision in going out on the field?"
Footsteps approached somewhere behind, gripping his wand tightly he raised it in the direction of the noise.
"Fine, I should probably get down to see what the ministry wants anyway." Harry accepts the slightly awkward embrace from Draco as he leaves the room.
"A mother’s love saved me more than once," Harry continued. "There are many witches and wizards who aren't aware of this, but love is an old and powerful magic. That being said, I request that Narcissa Malfoy be placed under the supervision of her remaining sister, Andromeda Tonks."
"End whatever it is you have with Mr Malfoy, and I will make sure this picture never sees the light of day," Robards ordered with a venomous smile.
He held him close as he thrust in and out slowly then quickly, one hand on Harry's arse and the other gripped on Harry's cock moving both rhythmically together, Harry was moaning pleasurably on the brink of an orgasm.
He packed up the things in his office that seemed important and threw away everything else, he carefully placed the picture of him and Draco on top of the box and placed the resignation letter over it. Standing by the closed door, he took one last look at the office.
"I guess the whole paying someone to follow us and take pictures is a good place to start, and then there's the reason he gave for doing so is bothering me."
Harry Potter was dying. The heat in the office was killing him, it was the hottest day of the year so far, and he had to be stuck in the stuffiest, hottest office in the whole of the Auror department. He had cast as many cooling down spells as he could think of, but it was no use he was too hot. He had taken as many clothes off that he could without exposing too much flesh; he even had taken his shoes and socks off, luckily no-one could see under his desk unless they walked behind his chair.
Harry and Ron listened in awe as they followed behind Hermione as she told them her detailed plan. They made sure Mrs Weasley wasn't about as they went back through to the Leaky Cauldron. It wasn't as busy as they thought it was going to be, but everyone else seemed to be rushing in and out of every shop. Hermione, who was the oldest, took the lead and approached Tom the Barman.
The tables had been shrunk and pushed back to make room for the dance floor. The band was setting up; drinks were being re-filled. Draco hadn't been able to get over how incredible Harry looked, If it weren't for the red lightning bolt scar on his forehead he would have never have thought it was him.
"Most dark artefacts are old looking and can be useful common objects, like a mirror," Draco said, pointing to the marble dresser which had a hand-held antique silver mirror. He couldn't help but smile when he neared it. It was definitely the artefact, and he needed it.
"NO!" Harry shouted shoving the suit out of his view. "Put it back; I don't want your fashion help; just get out."
"He won't be when the Aurors raid his Manor," He looked at his pocket watch. "In thirty minutes, you better hope they don't find that door handle."
Hermione Granger rushed into the room with three other nurses, her bushy hair rounded the bed as she checked Astoria and confirmed to him that she had indeed passed away, he slumped backwards into the chair in as though she had taken a club and swung it right into his stomach. He head muffled voices around him as he stared at Astoria's body, his head nodded on its own accord to the questions he was being asked but didn't comprehend them.
Draco moved back down to Harry's cock and let the tip into his mouth, slowly teasing and licking it moving an inch in at a time. He took pleasure in hearing Harry moan for more. Harrys back arched as Draco took the whole of the shaft into his mouth sucking slowly as he felt the pressure building. The pace quickened as the cock pulsated, Harry moaned louder.
"You don't think I am an insufferable git anymore?" Harry repeated more loudly; his cheeks were reddening.
"Great, I will take the Firebolt, you can have the child's broom," Draco smirked heading out of the bedroom.
"I can't promise anything," Draco replied, and Harry gave him a  'don't you dare look' "Okay fine, I won't hurt Ron."
"No, don't I appreciate your concern, I am fine. Honestly, I just need some Murtlap essence," Harry groaned sitting down in the chair.
"Right, yeah. Well, I best be off, or Mrs Weasley's food will be going cold." Harry nodded and walked to the fireplace.
Draco raised his arms in surrender, and he knew the damage Pansy could and has caused to witches and wizards in power, and didn't want to be one of them. "Okay, but can we do it after my opening tomorrow and when Harry is here to speak for himself."
"Okay, I will probably never have to see Malfoy until the wedding, now can we drop Malfoy, altogether?"
He didn’t think he could stand it a minute longer. One more twitch of those hips and he’d come undone. Harry let go of Draco’s hands—not sorry that he may have hurt Draco, not sorry to let go, but eager to explore how far he could take this—before Draco stopped him; before he stopped himself.
Draco laughed darkly as he worked Harry's cock in his hands, getting used to the feel of it and feeling it pulsate as Harry moaned louder as he worked quicker.
Harry quickly pulled away. "I'm sorry, that was inap..." He was shushed when Draco's lips pressed against his again.
"I only wanted to impress you," Draco admitted feeling his cheeks flush, he was just glad it was dark.
"There are many speculations from my readers saying that you weren't meeting for part of your case, and you just wanted to meet up as friends, can you confirm or deny this?"
"I know, he tells me all the time too," Harry agreed stifling a yawn threading his fingers between Draco's
"Hello, Ginny, thanks for inviting me. I hope it's okay I brought Ernie with me?" Seamus said, smiling at everyone at the table and avoiding Harry's eye.
"Hey," He felt a hand grab hold of his as he entered the front room. Draco was beside him, stroking his thumb against the back of his hand. "Everything okay?" He asked, eyebrows knitted with concern.
"So what's going on with you and Ginny?" Ron asked Harry when Teddy had run off to hide and eat his cakes away from Mrs Weasley.
Kinglsey didn't seem shocked or surprised by what Harry had just told him which Harry couldn't tell if that was a good thing or not. "I have suspected something was going on, Arthur Weasley has been to me, he was worried about Draco, he said he had left rather spontaneously."
"Of course," Harry said, wanting to kick himself. He pulled Teddy out of  Narcissa's unwilling arms and covered him with his travelling cloak.
Harry was still laughing, and Draco couldn't help but smile, it was such a good feeling to see Potter full of life. "That was so fun," Harry said, holding his ribs.
There was floor to ceiling shelving around the whole room, covered in gold, silver, bronze and brass items of different shapes and sizes, glass cabinets with odd little knick-knacks. A bookcase was full of old dusty spell books and biographies most of which Draco already owned in his family library, but he couldn't see Harry reading them.
"Don't test me," Draco held his wand toward him careful not to let him grab it. "Just answer the question."
"He is in the kitchen I gave him some bacon, he seemed to like it yesterday," Malfoy shrugged. "But don't change the subject, you are not ill, so get up," He paused. "And get dressed, we have one more day to find this Artefact, and that's it case closed."
Harry looked at him for a moment, staring into his grey eyes looking for a sign of betrayal, but all he could see was a steady gaze. "I believe you; however, I don't agree with what you or your father has done."
"He was in the room of requirement Hermione, why else would he have been there if he wasn't plotting something?" Harry argued back.
He looked as harassed as he felt but was dressed rather smartly like he had put more than four minutes into what to wear.
"Harry was blackmailed into staying away from you," Hermione said quickly as if it would do less damage.
“I heard them talking about it at the drinks table at Neville's engagement party; they were annoyed because you hadn’t given them a chance to tell you yet.”
Narcissa snapped her head to Blaise. "I invited her as a guest," She began. "She is coming to the Ball this Saturday; she doesn't know many people, so I suggested coming over tonight to get to know you three."
An owl tapped the window making Harry get off the floor and let it in. It was The Daily Prophet, Harry paid the owl, and it flew away gracefully. To Harry's delight, there was no wanted picture with Draco's face on it, but there was a picture of Theodore Nott.
"As long as I win something I will be happy," He told him with a small smile. He handed the woman behind the counter a Muggle paper from his pouch, that seemed worthless, but was apparently valued more than the coins.
Mrs Weasley had cooked an incredible feast for everyone, she tried to get everyone together as often as possible but found it very difficult now everyone was out of school and making their own career choices. She was very much the same as she had always been, mothering and warm; there was however great concern in her eyes as she looked at Harry and Ginny. She must be clued in on the fact Ginny is always at home and never at Harry's anymore, he thought, trying to avoid her gaze.
"Ah, Mr Potter, I have been waiting for you, I was sure you would be here sooner," Kingsley ushered him to sit down.
"No, most of the time I buy them from people in Knockturn Alley, if they need a quick release of them, working so close to the Auror office had its advantages."
"When then, when will you have the conversation that you are embarrassed that your only son is gay and married to the man who defeated your hero The Dark Lord?"  Draco was shouting now, and Lucius was on his feet, both wands were out and pointed at each other.
Harry stared at the man in front of him in disbelief, "So you would risk our entire marriage for revenge?"
Harry moved next to Ron and Hermione, they were deep in talk and Ron had his hand on her small bump. "Hey," Harry smiled feebly.
Harry sat up and bent his leg to examine the jewellery clearer. The pose he unintentionally assumed made Draco’s cock hardened some more.
Harry had woken up from a dream about Malfoy they had been all over each other ripping each other's clothes off and kissing each other over the kitchen table while Morty was eating a bacon sandwich. Dream Harry had a tattoo of Draco on his chest and went bright red when Draco had laughed at it. And they were in the Dursleys closet making out they were far too big.
"No," Draco lied clenching his fists and digging his nails in, He was turned away from Harry so he didn't get the urge to change his mind. "I feel nothing for you, Potter, you were just an easy fuck to get me through the night."
The waitress led Draco and Narcissa to the table next to theirs; the tension between them all grew more intense.
Draco couldn’t go another day of sneaking around to try and see or speak to Harry, It was actually a bigger turn on for him, but it was a pain in the arse trying not to get caught by practically everyone that wants to keep them apart or give their friendship/relationship exposure.
He gave Ginny and Hermione a sarcastic thanks a lot look, which they didn't get the hint because they were beaming at each other, did they actually think this was a good idea, and Ginny thought we would be soul mates? He thought bitterly.
Spotted by Draco, Hermione and Ron glanced away, but Harry remained eyes locked carefully on the Blonde. He had whispered something into his mother's ear, and she had turned to look directly at their table.
"They are really well, thank you," she replied sitting in her chair at the desk. "So, why are you here, have you been sneaking in places you don't belong?" She teased.
"So do I, so it better stay that way, no spilling anything on it, if you have to eat, please wear a napkin," Draco ordered and saw that Harry rolled his eyes again. "Don't roll your eyes at me Potter, or you will suffer the consequences."
"Mr Malfoy doesn't need to come to every practice, Potter, he trusts me fine to run my own practices without having to be here all day." Cotton said after Harry had asked him. "But if you must know, he said he was taking the week off as a personal matter came up at home."
There was conversation around the table, as everyone was in disbelief and concern. Every time Draco heard that the last thing he remembered was the middle of January, it stung him hard as he hadn't become friends with Harry until the end of January.
"Are you sure, I am happy to help?" Harry wasn't the best cook, but maybe the part of him that was storing repressed memories could help.
Draco finished reading the letter and shoved it into his pocket not wanting his mother to see the contents. He made a quick decision not to let Harry know about the other photographs, but it worried him slightly that he had been followed all day, how many more pictures are out there?
Harry looked as though he was processing what he had said, and then moved his wand reluctantly away. Draco rubbed under his chin where the wand had left an indent.
"So, Draco," His mother said, leaning in and rested her chin on her clasped hands. "Your father showed me an interesting article this morning."
She didn't look convinced but smiled anyway. "Are you looking forward to your date with Ernie tonight?" She teased.
"Sometimes Harry; you can be so clueless," Hermione said shaking her head in frustration, to which Harry and Ron both looked at her confused.
Draco tried as hard as he could not to curse Blaise, but he managed a smile, albeit you couldn't tell it was a smile, but at least he tried.
"We are not together," Harry said. "I mean, I don't think we are... officially, we haven't talked about it."
Draco sat at the kitchen table and watched Harry light up the kitchen stove and then fumble through the cupboards looking for a frying pan. He couldn't help but eye him up and down as he moved through the kitchen opening drawers and then to the fridge to take out the bacon. He didn't know why it was such a turn on, but he couldn't help it.
"Mr Weasley has decided to put me on a shorter leash and wants me in the office more and wants me to tell him exactly where I am at all times of the working day, which is incredibly annoying and inconvenient," Draco said and let go of his hand when he was the waitress bringing a tray full of food. "Thank you."
"I don't know, Potter, I don't have a clock behind my eyelids," Draco mumbled again and then sighed."All I know is we have work in a few hours, and I would like a chance to sleep off this alcohol before then."
"This time last year," Draco continued. "I had met Harry for the first time since we had left school and we had been set up by our two friends Blaise and Ginny with the worst dates imaginable, no offence Ernie and Zacharias. Their plan had actually worked, and Harry and I had a weird connection that seemed to keep drawing us back to each other. Don't get me wrong there were a lot of lying and arguments, but last month on my birthday Harry got down on one knee and asked me to marry him."
Draco didn't know how he was going to get this done in less than a week. He stood in the middle of the empty cafe he had just brought staring at the walls, floors and furniture trying to assess what needed to be done. In his head he had a vision for the cafe, he wanted it to be like the diners he and Blaise ate in when they went to America.
They arrived at the venue which was somewhere near London it had protective charms cast upon it, so Muggles didn't accidentally stumble inside and see a bunch of witches and wizards. There were already about 50 people in the large hall, which had been decorated with floating flowers and balloons and a giant ice sculpture of a unicorn, which incredible. There were about 15 round tables in the middle of the room, covered with plates and goblets and magnificent flower arrangements that almost touched the ceiling.
It always seems to tie back to his birthday, what the fuck had happened that night? "So, you are not going to tell me? Even though we are practically brothers."
"Ok, let's fast forward to the 19th you were interviewed again when you announced your purchase of the cafe and you denied ever being friends with Mr Potter, can you expand on this a little more?"
Harry furrowed his brows in confusion. Were they suggesting it was a publicity stunt? Harry wondered, and if it was he was pissed off with Draco, was anything they shared real?
When the two teams had been formed, they were told to mount their brooms and get into position. Harry knew the best place for a seeker to hover as he could get a clear view of the area and find the snitch clearer. He was 50 feet in the air and felt at home again he forgot how much he missed being on a Quidditch pitch.  The snitch was finally released into the atmosphere and fluttered away somewhere out of sight of Harry and Jason who was on team two.
The room cheered as Harry walked with suspicion up the stairs and onto the stage. Draco's heart was beating harder than ever. "Keep it together, idiot," He said to himself.
"I am going to be back in a few months for Christmas, Mother," He said, pulling out of her grasp. "Just keep sending me sweets, since I am not allowed to visit Hogsmeade."
They arrived at the apparition point, they were outside a set of large black cast iron gates, beyond that was a huge mansion, not as big as his own but nearly. Draco could tell straight away it had something dark inside it, he had firsthand experience with the effects of a dark object used nearby.
Draco's looked up at the clock Mrs Weasley had given them as a moving in present, and Harry's face was pointed to lost whereas Draco's was at home. "Fuck," Draco shot up.
"You're one to talk," Draco finally said, albeit more in a mumbled slur, but he said something at least. He pointed his head at the kitchen table where there were five empty bottles of Firewhisky.
"Oh, and not a word of this conversation to anyone," Robards called to him as he slammed the door behind him.
"It's afternoon tea, as a welcome home," Draco said pointing to the welcome home sign that was clearly visible, he specifically positioned it to be that way.
"Open your books and get started," Slughorn said and sat himself down at his own desk looking pleased with himself.
Draco Malfoy stood next to Gregory Cotton with folded arms and a smirk on his face. Harry's jaw wouldn't close he was surprised a fly hadn't flown inside his mouth it had been open that wide. How the fuck did Malfoy become the new owner of a professional Quidditch team? Harry thought angrily. He wanted to stand up and walk out of the stadium no way could he try out in front of Malfoy. But something kept him sat down as much as he tried to force his legs to get up his responses said no.
"I can't," Draco frowned. "I am drunk, you are drunk, and as much as I want to, I won't cheat on Astoria,"
He groaned and rolled onto his back and splayed out over the bed. The tips of his fingers felt parchment. He grabbed to see what he had touched and saw it was a neatly written note. He slid on his glasses and read the letter.
Harry looked at him reluctantly; he wasn't prepared to go diving into someone else's memory. He let out a sigh then bent over the pensieve emerging his face inside.
Harry had noticed Draco been going hard circling The Daily Prophet, looking for any tiny detail that he could circle and criticise. "Careful you are going to break the quill, I got you that for Christmas, it was expensive," Harry warned watching him closely.
Draco watched him, grey eyes gone dark with desire as Harry writhed sensually on his lap. Grasping the narrow hips, he pulled Harry close and took his other nipple in his mouth, suckling and pulling. Harry let out a cry at a particular hard nip, shuddering in pleasure and pain. Unconsciously he arched back, pushing against Draco’s mouth, wanting more of the same pleasure.
Ron began to laugh again. "Mate, you won't believe it, but he ended up hooking up with Malfoy's date Zacharias Smith. Apparently, they were pissed off at Ginny and Blaise about something and started snogging each other's faces off on the dance floor."
He felt Malfoys fingers slide through his messy brown hair then quickly release and they both stepped back abruptly.
"I was just dropping off your suit," Draco replied, stepping into the room and slipping into the closest armchair.
Morty was still ignoring Harry; he hadn't acted like this since he had first taken him in when he didn't know Harry or trust him not to starve him.
Harry turned the tied up Draco around with the chair, so they were now facing each other. He had found himself enjoying being in charge and having Draco right where he wanted him. He pulled his own shirt up over his head and threw it towards the kitchen door.
"I didn't want your parents to fucking disown you, as much as I dislike them, I didn't want that for you."
Harry zoomed quickly around the pitch watching around for the snitch and tried to focus on every player at the same time feeling angrier by the second.
Mr Weasley stood up and shook Harry's hand before leaving the office. Harry sunk down into his chair and covered his face with frustration.
Draco left the room feeling the pull of Harry leaving. He just managed to glimpse Ginny and Blaise fumbling to sort themselves out.
Draco stopped spreading and froze. How had he known he had spent the day with  Potter? He thought and internally saying shit, shit, shit.
This was the first time Harry had ever shared his bed with a man, and now, here Draco was lying naked next to him and asking him to leave the country with him.
Draco nodded carefully and stuck a hand out for Harry to shake. "Malfoy Manor," He called clearly after they let go of each other.
“We need to move,” he said. His hand fell from the wall and snaked behind him, searching blindly to where Harry was pressed against him. He found Harry, found Harry’s cock. And then it was in his hand, and he loved the softness of it, loved how he could feel the veins pulse with energy.
"It's the best one we have ever written, thanks to Harry letting us borrow his Pensieve," Fred said appreciatively to Harry.
He opened up the letter and was appalled to see such scruffy sloppy handwriting, fortunately, it was still decipherable.
A few moments later, Ernie Macmillian followed by Seamus Finnigan entered the room. Harry felt his stomach drop; it felt like everyone was staring at him to get his reaction, even though they weren't he was just being paranoid.
"Ginny set my date up; I am pretty sure she did it on purpose, knowing I would hate it," Harry whispered unaware he was leaning in closer to him. "All they did tonight is giggle and whisper together; they think the whole idea is funny."
This got the reporters excited, and flashes from the camera resumed once more. "So do you confirm you are in a relationship with someone? We have your last relationship as with Ginny Weasley, the chaser on the Holyhead Harpies."
A female with shoulder length, mousy brown hair was sitting in Blaise's usual seat, next to Draco's empty one.
Draco sighed and walked over to the men's section flicking through the suits Harry had just been through, he pulled out an ice grey three-piece suit. "Try this is on."
"That is unfair Draco," Narcissa muttered. "I will hear no more talk of this matter, you have just got home, Draco has planned this whole meal and we are going to enjoy it."
Draco raised an eyebrow at his father ignoring the dramatic expressions his mother was doing out the corner of his eyes. "You did all this for me?" It came out quieter than he expected, but his father nodded and frowned.
"No, I just saw it come into my head when you said it," Harry opened his eyes. "It was always you for me too."
Draco had gone back to his old job with Mr Weasley at The Ministry part-time he still owned the diner, and it was thriving better than ever, but he had enough trust in the staff he had hired to be able to manage without him a few days a week while he continues to find dark artefacts.
Hermione looked happy and surprised at him "Oh Harry that is amazing news, I am so happy for you, isn't that great news Ron?"
Draco wiped his mouth on his napkin and dropped into his empty dessert bowl; His father had just finished his third glass of Firewhisky and his mother her "first" bottle of wine when really it was her third. Blaise and Ginny were now sat together holding hands and kissing, which his mother always hated, as it was poor dinner etiquette.
Harry thought to himself; jealousy came over him at the idea of Draco and Hermione. He shook the images out of his head.
"Harry has shown real leadership over the past few practices and is our best chance at winning the cup this season. On that note, our first match is against the Chudley Cannons November 4th, so we need to make sure everything is tight and polished."
Draco sat down on the bed next Blaise's and opened the bottle. "You're a close second, bring me chocolate, and you will overtake Blaise."
“What if they try and hex us in our sleep?” Ron panicked, ignoring Hermione’s Arithmancy comment. "I don't know about you, Harry, but I would like a decent amount of sleep at night."
"Can I help you?" Harry asked annoyed that he was getting so much enjoyment out of the fact he looked an utter mess.
He knew now that Ron knew very well who he was working with and just wanted Harry to say it, it wasn't like it was a big deal, why should it be? It's not like Harry fancied Malfoy, he didn't have to admit that he got slightly turned on when he saw Malfoy smirk.
"Now if I ask him another question, he can lie to me," George told them. "Fred, did you sleep with all the girls on the Gryffindor Quidditch team?"
Professor Weasley entered the classroom in his dark robes, wand in hand and pointing to the board. 'Nonverbal Magic' appeared, which made Harry groan internally; he still hadn't quite grasped it, he managed to do Levicorpous and weak shield charm, but he wasn't as advanced as Hermione was, she had been trying to teach him and Ron, but he could never get the focus right.
Mr Weasley passed him a piece of parchment and smiled more prominently. Malfoy started walking out the room, putting the parchment in his pocket.
Harry took it eyeing them suspiciously, he pulled back the brown wrappings and saw a book, Harry Potter Vol. 4.
Harry was being guided through a door as he felt the threshold beneath his feet. A few moments later the blindfold had vanished, and the muffliato lifted.
There was something odd about the front door; Harry thought as he was standing outside The Manor that he and Draco were investigating, there was undoubtedly a snake on the door handle last time he had come. He stared at the bare looking handle. Was there a snake? He thought or was he just imagining it, No, he couldn't've, he remembered thinking about Morty when he saw it.
"They always ask me odd questions, and I rather not re-live every second of my life with them," Harry said being backed against the cupboard under the stairs by Draco.
"I promise you, Harry. If I didn't think it would work, I wouldn't have suggested it. But I believe it will, and I need you to help me make it succeed. As your Head of House, I have watched you return year after year with that same sense of returning home written on your face. Hogwarts is your home. Wouldn't you like to return to it, one last time?"
Robards leaned forward, so he was face to face with Harry and pressed his lips against his. Harry froze, eyes wide open as the realisation had kicked in and he felt the dry, chapped lips on him. He pushed him off and stood up repulsed.
"Please, Mr Weasley I know I can find it," Draco pleaded, he wasn't ready to part from Harry just yet. "Just one more week."
The next few practices ran the same; Cotton had given each team different plays to try out and so far team one had won 7/10 games which is a good start, to begin with. Harry had already made friends with most of the team; he was unsure about Simmons though who seemed to just aim all his bludgers at him, he was also an ex-Slytherin which says a lot about him he thought judgmentally.
"What in Merlin's name is this?" Draco shouted angrily, his brows furrowed and was breathing hard. He hadn't felt this angry with his father in months.
Draco Malfoy strode with a happy step into the dining room where his parents were sitting eating breakfast; his father was engrossed in The Daily Prophet, and his mother was drinking her morning champagne and orange juice.
Harry shivered as he snapped back into his office, he was thrilled he actually remembered something, maybe he was going to be okay after all.
"I am sure, I know what I am doing, and Draco isn't that bad anymore, he is very professional and hard-working," Harry said truthfully.
Draco was not amused and kicked him hard under the table. "They were a different kind of friendship, not like Blaise he is more like a brother."
Draco rolled his eyes as her eyes began to well up. "Oh, don't be so dramatic mother, it's called having friends."
"Don't mind me, Mum. I only helped Harry defeat You-Know-Who," Ron said, scraping back his chair and angrily getting up. Hermione frowned at the empty chair and ran upstairs after him.
“Mm-hmm.” Harry kissed Draco again before letting go of his cock. He pressed up onto the balls of his feet, lifting his arse off of Draco’s lap just a bit. “Scoot down,” he stated.
The drawer had seemed tiny when he had looked in it, but Draco was practically diving inside of it, large things were getting flown across the room, a black leather briefcase almost hit Harry's head.  A few moments later Draco came up with a pleased face holding a gold device that had multiple coloured knobs and buttons.
When he finally decided to get up and dressed, he left the house for work he had stopped taking Morty with him; he decided he could trust him to be home alone, also the fact Morty would hardly speak to him now.
"I know how you feel, Astoria just sleeps in the library, I feel like I married Granger," Draco snorted.
Harry put a hand on his lap quickly. "Erm, yes, just last night catching up with me, had drinks with Dean and Seamus."
"What took you so long? You better not have touched anything," Harry groaned, looking paler than before.
"Money is something I have always understood, so no, I think I can work it out for myself,"  Malfoy replied, sounding his arrogant self again.
Theodore shrunk a tiny bit, and his shoulder-length greasy black hair turned short messy and brown, his cold brown eyes turned shiny green as he was now staring back at himself. "I didn't think it would work so well," Nott admitted.
"I don't want this to be awkward and ruin your night," A voice from the doorway said making Harry quickly turn his head to see the blonde hair and grey eyes stood cautiously against the closed door.
How did he not know? He thought, trying to remember if he did know and just forgot. "He works at the ministry? I have never seen him."
"First of all, I would like to thank everyone who turned up today, I know some of you never thought you would step foot in Malfoy Manor," there was a laugh as everyone listened to Draco begin his speech. "As most of you know Harry and I was not the best of friends in school, granted most of it was my fault, even got punched in the face by Hermione," everyone laughed again, and someone even cheered. "Anyway, I don't want to drone all night I just want to say to you Harry, the past seven months with you have been the best seven months of my life, and I hope you have a wonderful birthday."
Blaise shot up; Harry grabbed hold of the buckle on the back of Draco's waistcoat, Robards chuckled darkly.  "Temper, Mr Malfoy, you don't want to end up in Azkaban do you?" Robards asked holding his wand inside his robes.
They both groaned as Harry rocked his hips slowly forward and rearward, and Harry felt the pressure of Draco’s cock against his prostate radiate out into his torso.
"Oh, um, I fell asleep in the library, and Dobby woke me up, he was the one who gave me the gillyweed," Harry remembered and felt thankful to his old friend who always tried to help him.
"That won't be necessary, Harry," Kingsley said over the murmurs. "If I have to ask the courtroom to be quiet one more time, you will all be made to leave."
The waitress came back again with the three glasses and two plates of food hovering in front of her. They rested on the table, and she walked away after scoffing at Ron.
Draco thought about it for a moment; he knew he was going to win, that was obvious, he was on one of the fastest brooms in the world. He didn't want to win money or property that was pointless. The thing he valued most in the world was time; he was trying to make the most of the time he had while Harry went around like he didn't have enough time to do anything.
"Yes, of course, I will marry you," Harry nodded and helped Draco to stand up. Friends and family were cheering so loudly you would have thought they were at a Quidditch game. "I fucking love you."
About half an hour later Draco had managed to wake Harry up and get dressed, he didn't particularly like wearing the same clothes as the night before, especially when he had been drinking but he figured it would only be until he got home and washed.
Three hours after visiting his parents grave Harry had not expected to have been sat in the office of the Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. He had received an owl an hour after he had got home requesting to see him as soon as possible. Draco hadn't been pleased he had to leave him, but he told him he would go home and let his mother know he was still alive, but Harry assumed he was feeling a bit sentimental after seeing Harry's parents grave.
Ron drew out his wand and Draco did just as quick. "And there he is, The real Draco Malfoy," he turned his head slightly towards Harry. "You don't need  your memory to remember this is who Malfoy really is."
"So, do we start taking bets on how the family meal goes tomorrow?" Blaise asked rubbing his palms together excitedly. "10 Galleons, Harry ends up dangling upside down."
"It is out of my hands Harry; the board insisted it, we need permanence to avoid history repeating itself," he let out a sigh. "I'm sorry, you know if there were something I could do I would."
"It would be a bit sad me writing it about myself don't you think?" Draco grinned folding up the letter and taking their owl out of the cage and sending him out the window with the letter. "You need to go to work if you are going to get back in time."
"So you're a witch?" Draco asked, annoyed that he was wrong about her just thinking Harry was good looking.
And that was why they whispered and moaned and rubbed against each other, lost in each other's gorgeous eyes and satin skins. Love so sweet and gentle flowed between them, tiny stars prickling their vision.
They got outside where the sky was now darker, and the garden was lit up with strings of lights. There were guests outside kissing behind the marquee and a group of girls talking and giggling with Dean, Seamus and Neville.
"Because I know you, Draco, We may have spent the past few weeks in separate parts of the Manor, but I know who you are, I see the light in you, and there is more light than dark," She smiled at him. "Will you promise me something else?"
"You can get off now," Draco hissed, and Ron let go, he straightened out his suit and brushed off any soot.
Harry grabbed the end firmly and guided the tip into his mouth teasing it as he did, Draco moaned loudly as, he is dick was halfway inside muscles pulsating, Harry sucked it eagerly as it went deeper. "Fuck," Draco cried gripping Harry's body tightly nails digging in. Harry's arms were wrapped around his waist hand's grasping his clenched arse and guided his hips forward as Draco's dick slid in and out of Harry's mouth moving with pace quickly, then slowly. "I'm going to cum," Draco moaned pleasurably and gasped as the salty liquid left his cock and went into Harry's mouth.
"Yeah, it's his job, Dad's his boss; how did you not know this?" Ron looked at him incredulously then took a big mouthful of beans.
Draco had indeed found it, but couldn't tell them that, he wanted to spend as much time getting to know Harry as much as possible before they decided to give up the search. He also couldn't tell them he has found it because he is supposed to hand it into the department, he would be sent to Azkaban quicker than he could say, Salazar.
Draco's parents had been slumped in the corner of the ballroom most of the night drinking a lot of wine, he was pretty sure they were so drunk they wouldn't remember anything in the morning, which is what Harry was hoping and they would forget about Draco's idiotic idea of Sunday lunch. He had tried to back out of it, but again, Draco had dangled their deal over his head, if only he had brought Teddy a proper broom, he would have smoked Draco.
Neville had stood up, and everyone turned around to him and watched as he started his speech. "Thank you, everyone, for coming to our engagement party; it has been a great night so far, we hope everyone has been enjoying themselves and are not too drunk to get on the dance floor in a moment and dance like its 1999." Draco rolled his eyes as everyone laughed. "We have set our wedding date," Neville continued, "It will be January 5th, 2006, so save the date, and we hope you will all be there to share our special day."
Hermione and Ron had left, and it was just Harry and Draco alone, they had both sank onto the sofa together exhausted like they had both just been running. Draco rested his head on Harry's shoulder.
Draco pulled Harry down an empty corridor, between his office and Mr Weasleys there was a maintenance closet that nobody ever went into. He unlocked the door with his wand, and they quickly went inside, closing the door behind them.
Mr Weasley smiled uneasily and pulled up a chair in front of Harry. "I am sorry to drop in on you like this, Harry. I feel I owe you an apology."
He had been avoiding his parents all day; he didn't want a conversation about his recent purchase without witnesses present. He sighed with relief when he saw the green flames woosh inside the fireplace and Blaise stepped out in his dinner clothes, followed by Ginny in a beautiful red dress.
Narcissa let out a small sound of frustration and shifted uncomfortably in her seat. "Haven't you got anything to say?" She said to her husband who hadn't spoken on the subject.
"Come, let's go into the sitting room, Harry can be a bore by himself in here," Draco ushered them out of the kitchen to their rarely used sitting room.
Mr Weasley looked as though he was about to cry and leap over the desk and hug him, but fortunately, he cleared his throat and nodded. "I will be sad to see you go, Draco, if there were anything I could say to make you stay, you would tell me?"
He sighed and opened the door, pausing at the threshold. He watched as his father had his back to him, crushing up roots.
"Of course I will my Darling, just make sure you keep out of trouble and make sure you are nice to Potter," his Mother said, giving him another squeeze. "I don't want any letter's from any of the teachers."
"What is it dear?" Mrs Weasley asked her when she stared open-mouthed pointing between Harry and Draco.
"That is correct," Draco lied and looked at real Harry's eyebrows furrow in confusion. He took out his wand and put it against the real Harry's chest.  "Don't think you can fool me, Nott." He saw a wand slide into Harry's pocket and moved back.
"I don't know if you heard what Ron said downstairs, but he was just being an idiot, I told him to shut up."
He landed in Malfoy Manor; it was dark and cold. Draco was in the sitting room drinking a glass of wine and reading the daily prophet.
Later that evening Ron and Hermione were over at Harry's for dinner they had been sat in the sitting room after they had eaten and were drinking firewhiskey apart from Hermione who was still on the pumpkin juice.
"I think that's everyone," Slughorn said, closing the door and clapping his two chubby hands together. "We have touched on the subject of Polyjuice Potion before, and I have come up with an exciting project for you to do, to start the year off on a fun note."
The office had looked like it hadn't been used, it had a bookcase filled with folders that had been colour coded and there was a desk that had nothing on it at all and a desk chair that still had the plastic film over it, had he even sat in there? He wondered.
Draco took hold of Harry's hands. "Harry James Potter, today I stand here with you, sharing one of the biggest moments we will ever have or ever thought we would have. I have become a better man in the short time we have become friends, colleagues and more importantly, partners. I still have a lot of growing up to do, we both know that but I want to grow up with you, I want to be sat in Grimmauld Place in 50 years and still be sat next to you. So I Draco Lucius Malfoy promise to stick with you through sickness and health through thick and thin I will love, honour and obey you till death do us part."
“What about those who have already had their privileges taken from them?” He asked though he wasn’t asking to be arrogant, it seemed to be a real worry for him.
"How's the new book coming?" Draco asked Fred and George also known as J.K.R. After the successful sales of the last book, Fred and George had decided to buy Zonko's joke shop in Hogsmeade, they had been discussing it for years, but it had never come to fruition.
A small boy with dark brown hair and glasses stepped on the stage; Harry couldn't help but compare him to himself when he first sat down. Though this boy might have looked like Harry, he didn't look scared like Harry had done at the prospect of having to fight a dragon, no this boy had a smug look about him a look that reminded him of Draco Malfoy.
The dressing room curtains opened to Madam Malkin walking in, and the tape measure got to work quickly whizzing lengthways and widthways up and down his body, then the pins started darting about; he tried to stand as still as he could, telling his reflexes this was normal and not a danger to him.
Draco felt sweat behind his neck as their bodies were so close together heating up.  They slowed their kissing down as they thought they were nearing back to the bottom of the wheel. Draco gave him one final kiss and pulled himself off him breathing heavily.
Harry grinned at the neatly written words at the side of the paper, 'We were sat on tables next to each other: Fact check.'
"Robards destroyed them, we don't know if the person made copies, though," Harry said, filling up his glass with the bottle Hermione slid over to him.
Draco let go of his hand and stood up. "Right well I better go home before work," He announced stretching tiredly.
"No, she was no longer his type," Blaise smirked and shared another giggle with Ginny; Harry wanted to throw up in his mouth.
Draco's hand flexed quicker this time. "I am not sure; you will have to ask him that one," He replied with a forced laugh.
"Erm, I firstly want to thank you all for your patience while I have been refurbishing the cafe, I know many witches and wizards spent a lot of time in there, even if it's just for their lunch breaks," Draco looked at Harry again who was still smiling. "Before I reveal the new name of the cafe I would like to clear a few things up."
"It looks busier in there than usual, should we maybe split up?" Ron asked, hoping to be split up from his Mum and sister.
Harry straightened up an walked around the desk closing the gap between him and Malfoy. Next thing he knew he pressed his lips hard against Malfoys.
"What does your letter say, Gin?" Harry asked, noticing her face was paler than usual. They hadn't really spoken much since the end of the war, it got a bit awkward between them when neither of them knew if they were together or not.
"Oh, he is probably in the front room talking to Fred and George, he wants to invest in their new business venture," She pulled a face which told him she was not on board with the idea. "Anyway, come, Harry, we need to talk about that article."
"I like you, Harry," Robards said composing himself feeling slightly embarrassed from the rejection.
"You will love it," Draco replied, leaning over the bed to the floor, to pick up his boxers and trousers. He slid them on and fastened them up. "Have you got a shirt, you ripped mine remember?"
"You weren't the only one who lost 15 years that day, Harry" Draco gritted his teeth gripping his wand tighter, "I lost them too."
It was dark; he could just make out a shadowy figure near the fireplace crouched down to lift things up off the floor. "Lumos," Harry muttered lighting his wand up. The wand highlighted the intruder, and the white blonde hair revealed itself to him.
Hermione and Ron finally confessed to Harry that they were secretly seeing each other behind his back.
In the kitchen, Harry was sat nonchalantly reading the newspaper and eating his toast, this annoyed, Draco. He always hated that Harry didn't worry about things, he would be all "Voldemort is taking over the wizarding world let's go watch Quidditch, then I will effortlessly destroy him when the worst time comes." He shook what he had thought out of his head and sent a silent apology to the completely unaware Harry, after all, he was clueless about what was going on, he just thought they were going for a fancy meal.
"You two," She replied. "Do you remember, last year at Neville's engagement party, I said to Harry maybe it will be your engagement party next year. And Blaise you said to Draco you could have a joint one."
He was finally starting to feel as though the piece of soul that he had lost on his last birthday had slowly started to come back, but now it was back to square one.
He shook his head then stood up slowly. "I...need to go, I...can't...she," He sighed. "No." He felt Hermione grangers arms around him and her chin against his shoulder.
Harry laughed. "Awol, not awally, you wally; what I am trying to say is I have been a selfish Godfather."
At the same moment, the fireplace filled with green flames amitting two visitors; One being the greying Mrs Weasley and with her was the once blue, now red-haired Teddy, who was teary eyes and puffed in the face as if he had been having a tantrum.
Harry turned his head towards him, with a tear in his eye. "How amazing the world is, this is what we wake up to in the morning; this is what we go to sleep to."
The Manor had been fully converted to a completely different place it looked warm and inviting, whereas usually, it was cold and dim lit. There were purple carpets laid out through to the ballroom, and a backdrop with the daily prophet logo splashed across where every guest would get their photo taken.
Harry saw Ginny and Blaise smiling at him out the corner of his eye, he turned to face them and gave them an I am going to kill you both in a minute look.
"Oh come off it," Draco stood up startling Morty. "You weren't that bothered about me coming to your bedroom; you kicked me out after I picked out that suit. Why did it trigger you so much?"
Robards grinned, holding up the picture still. "Call it an incentive; I am sure Mr Malfoy wouldn't want to be outed to his parents through the daily prophet when he has worked so hard to rebuild their image."
"Very," Draco replied in all seriousness, trying to read Harry's mind. He wanted Harry to be ok with it and kiss him and tell him they can move on from this, but the hurt he had seen in Harry's eye's told him that it wasn't going to be something he can put in the glass cabinet and leave the room.
"Where're my glasses?" Harry asked, a few seconds later his vision became clear as Draco placed his round spectacles on his face. "Where's my wand?"
"Don't worry about it," Hermione whispered and grabbed his hand. "It should have broke when he died."
"Look I am sorry, let's not argue anymore, if you want me to return the broom I will, I just wanted to make up for my families shitty past and money is usually the first thing I turn to."
"Well, this whole situation is his fault, he hired someone to follow me," Draco said, trying to hide the fact he was actually feeling a lot of warmth for his father.
She dabbed at the corner of her eyes with a makeup wipe and turned back to her dressing table. "It's fine; just don't accuse me of not trying, when all I have done is try with you."
When Draco had chucked on his clothes, he and Harry left the cottage hand in hand, and they walked through the village of Godric's Hollow. They passed a row of cottages and Draco halted when he saw the ruin of Harry's parents house.
Anabel walked through the door without knocking as usual, and it pissed him off, he didn't know whether it was because of what was going on or that it was about time he stuck up for himself. He pointed at the door angrily. "Go out, close the door and knock and wait to be invited in from now on," He bellowed.
"Isn't he just fantastic?" She beamed at him. "He will make your cafe the best, you have ever seen, and I would love to do a piece on it, if I may?"
Harry's mind flickered to his lunch with Draco earlier, and how bizarre the whole conversation had been, he didn't fully understand why his father would think he was a spy or why Draco would get so touchy by it. He also felt weird about the fact there was a slight moment where Draco may have been flirting with him, it wasn't a bad weird either it was a weird he would usually feel when he thought about being in close proximity with Draco.
