“I demand you tell me what is going on this instant!”
“Reveal hasn’t even happened yet.”
“It’s about to end,” Draco said.
Harry swallowed a sigh.  “I needed a potion ID’ed.”
Rats were not Malfoy’s boggart. They were Wan’s, who was now standing where Malfoy should have been, and behind Wan was Bennet, who had started the exercise in the first place. “Do I have to go again?” Bennet asked, when the boggart began to change into her own gravestone.
“But you know where it is?” Draco said eagerly.  “Is it in the Caribbean?  I’ve heard it’s in the Caribbean.  Are you going to the Caribbean?  I want to go to the Caribbean.  Some of the spells are different in the Americas, you know, and they’ve got coconuts—”
“What?” Malfoy snapped.
“Right. It was . . .” Harry rubbed the back of his hand. “It was Malfoy. He was there—because he’s Level One again, obviously—but he was there, and he was standing by Teddy, and he just, sort of . . . touched Teddy’s shoulder.” Harry didn’t know why what had happened made him feel so uncomfortable; it wasn’t even a big thing. It was not a big thing. “And then someone asked me whether I’d really told Teddy I didn’t want him to be an Auror.”
“He wouldn’t dream of it,” Draco muttered.  “Come on.”
“Why wouldn’t I like green?  My eyes are green.”
“They come in shops?” Malfoy looked interested in this. “Of course, they do. By the dozen.”
.  He’s got freckles.  He’s not at all good-looking.”
“I know all kinds of spells,” Harry went on.
I’m going to be someone important.”
“Teddy is my friend,” Malfoy said simply.
“Yes.”  Draco sniffled.  “I suppose that—I suppose it turns out all right.  In the end.  But I can’t help . . . I’m so worried about it.”
“I’m not, then,” Harry said, trying not to sound disappointed.
“It was
Oh God.
“Do you know, so do I?” she said. “There are factions who think that Draco Malfoy joining the Auror Department would make the Auror Force more sympathetic toward neo-purists who dabble in dark arts. If that’s the case, at least Draco won’t be much help to them.”
Anger had staved it off for a good ten minutes, but now Harry could feel it: panic. It was beginning to crawl down his spine, which stiffened against it. Then it slid into his veins, causing his blood to pump harder, his limbs to grow hotter, his heart thumping so hard it contracted his lungs. He wasn’t going to be able to breathe. He wasn’t going to be able to breathe.
The crisp October turned over into a soggy November. The only bright side of Fudge being Minister was that it left his seat on the Board of Regents for the Academy vacant. Since the seat could only be filled by a vote from a plurality of the alumni, however, and the vote took a while to organize, a new board member would likely not be appointed until the end of spring term.
; that was what he needed.  Harry could get someone from St. Mungo’s, then Obliviate them.
“No, no. I know of him, just as I know about you. You should know, Harry, I saw about half the population of MACUSA on a regular basis when I lived in the US, especially under the current administration.” Milligan sounded as though she didn’t particularly approve of the current administration. “I didn’t treat Vinicius—obviously, I wouldn’t tell you if I had. But I thought you should be aware that the wizarding world isn’t all that large, even in the US.”
“What if I put my mouth on it right now?” Harry said, then licked Draco’s lips. “What if I put it in my mouth, took the hairband off, and you just—came inside? Right inside my mouth.”
“All right,” Harry said, swallowing another sigh and stepping back toward Malfoy. Harry’s hands settled on Malfoy’s shoulders, and Malfoy took a swift breath, but then made his shoulders drop down.
“So, we’re not even walking to our desks anymore?  Just float everything you need across the office, do you?” said a voice, before they’d got all the way there.
He was all right.
Malfoy wasn’t saying anything. Harry took another step closer to him.
“Has someone told you you can’t?”
“You hadn’t mentioned his Patronus changed.”
“Then you don’t want to go flying with me?” Draco said lightly.
They pushed through the cold blackness onto a street with row houses.  The street was neat and quiet with a little park on the other side, so Harry thought it was probably posh, even though the houses looked sort of rundown.  The sign on the street read Grimmauld Place.  “Can you see number twelve, Harry?” Draco said, still holding his hand.
“Malfoy is my student,” Harry said, because he didn’t like the way Shacklebolt had made this sound.
“Yes,” Draco hissed, thrusting his hips against Harry’s, so that Draco’s cloth-covered erection slid across Harry’s thigh. “Someone is.”
“You are, though. Bigger.”
“You mean possession,” Harry said. “If a ghost inhabits you.”
? Harry wanted to add.  Not sounding disappointed was proving difficult.
Kavika had been with her daughter in Beirut for most of the term so far. Kavika’s new granddaughter was having some health problems, so Harry understood why Kavika couldn’t be in England, but at one point, Harry had needed a session so badly he’d suggested going to see her. Apparition and Floo weren’t very helpful crossing water, and Portkeys cost a lot, but Harry had been desperate enough to use his Ministry connections. For instance, Kingsley had to have a Portkey, but Kavika had put her foot down.
He hadn’t known his Patronus would reveal he was in love with Harry Potter,
Draco asked, “Why would grown-up-me design something so appalling?”
“Okay, yeah.” Harry swallowed. “Have you—you haven’t heard anything from Cambridge, have you?”
“Um.” Harry licked his lips, and then Harry saw that Draco’s ears were pierced.  Several times.  One of them was, anyway; Harry couldn’t see Draco’s other ear with the way his head was angled.  Harry couldn’t see any earrings in the ear that was visible, just little holes.  Draco would have woken up with the holes; his older self didn’t necessarily have earrings sitting about waiting to be worn.  Harry had never noticed Draco having any piercings when Harry had first met him again at Slug and Jiggers, but Teddy had said Draco had had them.  Draco had
“I don’t know what you—”
“Brilliant,” Harry breathed. “Brilliant, Malfoy. It’s magnificent; now look in the trunk.”
“Who’s asking?” said the man.  “Are you a friend of Harry’s?”
“Are you.” It wasn’t really a question, and Harry sank back down into the chair behind his desk.
“I’ll do it,” Harry said, because even though desks were boring, it was a
Robards’s humour dropped away. “You will if I say you will.”
“I want to fuck you on your hands and knees,” Draco said. “I want to see the cunt I’m fucking while I fuck it.”
Usually a disruption charm was cast on a small object such as a quill or coin to create a Ward Bore. Once dropped within, the charm began its work, boring a small hole into the anti-Apparition ward. If the charm was strong enough, eventually the hole in the ward would grow large enough for a person to Apparate inside the protected area, but Apparition was also strong magic. The force of the Apparition usually collapsed the hole, thereby keeping everyone contained within the wards.
Underneath his skin was pale.  He’d got a bit of hair on his chest, just a light dusting of blond.  The scars across his torso were long and thin, raised white that looked almost silvery in the pale light of the room.  It was late afternoon, and the fire had gone out.  Harry’s heart ached at how beautiful Draco looked.  Even the scars were lovely.  Draco’s shirt was stripped to his waist, still covered in blood.
Harry knew what was going on. He had a suspicion of what was going on. He had a suspicion that Ron had a suspicion of
“I suppose,” Draco said airily.  “If you must.”
“Bye, Molly. I love you.” Banishing the flame, Harry got out. He needed out, outside, with the oxygen, and fresh air; he needed to be outside.
Malfoy still hadn’t turned.  Annoyed, Harry grabbed his shoulder to force him to do it, but as soon as Harry touched him, Malfoy jerked away, stumbling into a stack of the boxes on the floor.  In the process he’d turned around.
He was humiliated
“No,” Harry said. “I mean, I don’t believe in that.”
Malfoy tossed his head. “I’m always ready.”
“Don’t be a nit.  Swamp-things aren’t related at all.  Here.”  Draco handed the book over the side of the bed, so Harry had to grab it or leave Draco’s small hand holding an enormous tome.  “You can use my wand, too,” Draco said, handing that over the side once Harry had taken the book.  The wand was still emitting light, flashing in Harry’s eyes.
“No,” Kavika agreed, and at least that was reassuring. “You shouldn’t. What have you done about it?”
“It can fuck you whenever I want,” Draco said. “As hard as I want. As fast as I want it. You like the thought of being filled up and fucked with a toy. Don’t you, Harry?”
“Like that,” Harry said, straightening, pulling his head from the window. “That right there. I mean, aren’t you tired of having this conversation? Over and over?”
“Yes,” Harry said, “but it’s important.  Can we make them in the kitchen?”
“All right, Draco.”
“Not great,” Harry said.
“Are you watching me?”
Harry looked at her in utter puzzlement. “Nyala—he knows. Doesn’t he? He has to.”
“Now remind me of what I say next,” Kavika said softly.
“Can’t even cast a Patronus.” Malfoy tapped the blonde’s notebook as he passed her by. “Write that down. ‘The Death Eater who caused Dumbledore’s death doesn’t even have a happy thought to think.’ This is poetry, people. An elegy in verse.” Malfoy had reached Harry’s side, but still, no one was looking at him.
.”  Harry tapped again, but the cabinet still didn’t open.
“Right,” Rune said, both quickly and gently. “I had heard you don’t always follow politics assiduously.”
Andromeda turned to Draco, a smile at the side of her lips.  “You’ve got to admit he’s quite stubborn, if nothing else.”
“Malfoy has a problem with his ex-boyfriend dancing with people?” said Ron, asking the relevant questions.
An alpaca appeared in the room between them, standing on Sibanyoni’s carpet. Something about the alpaca made Harry feel afraid Sibanyoni had Summoned a real alpaca, which was worrisome, because what would the poor thing think? But the alpaca did not seem perturbed by its surroundings; it just stood there with its large, well lashed eyes and its crooked mouth, which was curled into an amusing expression.
“His mum does modelling,” Draco went on and, for the next fifteen minutes, proceeded to wax eloquent on the merits of Blaise Zabini.
“Harry.”  There was a long silence.  So long passed that Harry thought Draco might have fallen asleep, but then he said, “I’ll tell you a secret.”
“Maybe,” Harry said.  “But you don’t disappoint me.  Remember that, when you grow up.  You far surpass every expectation I ever had of you.”
“Okay,” Harry said slowly. “So now we’re making this about you? And the part where I told you there
; my dad wouldn’t—he wouldn’t do that!”
“If you’re going to ask about the cream,” Malfoy said, “it’s better to neutralize something like that completely rather than risk it getting spread somewhere else.  It’s all rather complicated for your tiny brain, Potter.  I’ll write up handling instructions for it, so you can take care of this and any other samples you encounter.”
“Go back to sleep,” Draco murmured.
a consolation.” Once more, Travers’s voice was full of feeling. “And it’s worked out, in the end.”
“Draco,” Harry said.
“Sweet Dreams?”
,” Draco said, sinking against the shelves.  “I’m not a poof.”  Then he was on the ground, knees up with his arms wrapped around them.  His wand was still clenched tightly in his hand.  Heloise fluffed her feathers, unsettled, then opened up her great wings to make the awkward flaps that closed the distance between her and Draco.
Harry’s heart dropped back from his throat into his chest, then continued a free fall into his stomach. Slowly, he turned around. “Vinicius.”
On the pale muscle of Malfoy’s forearm was some kind of mark, maybe a series of scratches. Harry couldn’t see it from across the room. When Malfoy spoke, his voice was calm and careless. “
This was the part of the meeting in which Penelope whirled on various faculty, her eyes flashing, demanding, “Are you
“Lucius is the worst,” Harry said immediately.
“How does she know where to go?” Harry asked.
“I don’t know.”
Draco sat up.  “You want that Mudblood chit.”
“Excellent.”  Draco put his arm out.  “Side-along?”
“So we’ll just pretend Draco Malfoy was never a Death Eater, won’t we?” said Penelope. “Just let bygones be bygones.”
Luckily, Draco appeared distracted by the ledger, wandering over to the window to read.  Taking out one of Draco’s graduated cylinders, Harry began getting ready to add the final ingredient to Draco’s cure—and his own.
“Yeah,” Harry said, because he hoped so.
“Oh. Good. I mean, mostly. I—talked to Teddy.”
Malfoy got his magic back on the same day his mum died.
Teddy looked affectionate, which on Teddy was generally just a small curve of his lips, but because it was on Teddy, that curve looked so happy and so good. “It’s okay, Harry.”
“This isn’t some students’ club from your Hogwarts days, is it?” Malfoy was saying. “I have a history of action, you know. They don’t write it this way in the histories, but I helped handle Dumbledore. I’m not interested in schoolboy mask-wearing.”
“The world is ending?” a non-magical man shouted in the orchard, breaking Harry’s concentration once again.
Back at the lab, Draco had already brewed several potions.  Draco must’ve stayed up most of the night to do it, as Harry was fairly certain they hadn’t been this far along when they’d stopped the night before.
“Yes,” Harry said. “Rune Photsi.”
“Good.  I didn’t excel at Muggle studies, but I didn’t think I had failed so dismally.”  Draco swung the door open further.  “I’ve made breakfast, if you’re hungry.”
Harry just gave him a look.
“Non-Magical Studies,” Harry wrote, then thought of all the courses at the Academy. Defensive Flying? Transportation. First Aid and Minor Magical Healing? Rune Photsi had mentioned how the magical world might improve non-magical medicine. Combat? Harry thought of non-magical guns. Maybe not the best idea. Maybe something more like History of Magic—Hogwarts courses. Harry took out another parchment, starting another list.
Harry followed him there as well.  “You think my frame of reference is skewed.”
“Cool.” Teddy picked up the guitar again.
“Your friend Ron Weasley is a genius at it,” Draco said, playing a card.  “Quite the best in our year.”
“That’s because the
“I didn’t,” Travers said, giving him an indulgent smile, “but it’s here, this Friday.”
Leaves. The distant murmur of students. Owls again. Harry concentrated, wondering if he could hear if Malfoy turned a page. He couldn’t, but when Harry waited, Malfoy eventually turned one page, then another, thoroughly engrossed.
“It’s natural sometimes,” Teddy said, changing his hair to green.
After the first few hours, the reports began to roll in from the more populated areas—Diagon was overrun, not by violence, just by the sheer
Standing in the shadows of the cool, empty stone cloister, Harry took a steadying breath, then another.
“But you were making the other one as well.”
Now was the part of the meeting when Harry left.
“Two days,” Draco said.
Draco spanked him again, hard, three times across one cheek, twice across the other, unpredictable, stinging. He stopped to spell Harry’s cock harder, but Harry was already aching, leaking at the tip, throbbing each time Draco spanked him, and then Draco spanked him again.
“Merlin’s toadstools,” Draco breathed.  “I’ve become a
All in all, it was a very good day. Harry never wanted it to end.
Ripping himself away from that heady warmth, Harry panted.  “You’re a Death Eater.”
Behind the door was a little kitchen with white cabinets and yellow tile.  Inset into one of the counters was a white sink, but Harry didn’t see any fridge or microwave.  In one corner was an old-fashioned cooker, and in the other corner was a little table with chairs and a window open beside it with cheerful-looking curtains.  Beyond that was another door—to the washroom, Harry supposed, or perhaps a bedroom.  In all it was a quaint little place, and Harry liked it immediately.  He’d still much rather stay here than Privet Drive, and Mister Malfoy was still much, much nicer.  Even if he did get angry.
“I would rather die.”
“Sure,” Teddy said. “If you are.”
“Not at all,” said Harry, trying to think of something else that would capture Malfoy’s attention—anything else.  His mind, however, was blank of ideas, which meant that the words from that awful letter surfaced in Harry’s mind.
Gradually, a form began to materialize. After another minute or so, the form became a boy—not older than Travers had been, when he was expelled, eighteen or nineteen. The form was translucent, like a ghost. Like a ghost, he wore clothes he must have died in: a long tunic, hose, no shoes. His hair fell to his shoulders, and about his head was a band of cloth.
“The fuck are you talking about, Potter.”  Draco stood up, his voice so flat that the words didn’t sound like a question.
he’s better-looking than Theo’s dad.  Theo’s probably just jealous.  He says blood purity doesn’t matter, but if that were true, I don’t see why he would . . .”
“Oh, right. The non-magicals.”
Harry waited, wanting to hear whether this thought made sense, wanting to hear that it was comprehensible, valid in some way, excusable, realistic, something. Milligan waited too. At last she said, “So, is Vinicius that person?”
Unsure whether to seriously consider this question, Harry gazed off into the space that Teddy and Nyala had last occupied, as though somehow, magically, the emptiness would tell him where they had gone. It actually could—there were certain tracking spells that Harry could employ—and yet, Teddy was nineteen. Old enough to do what he wanted, young enough to need to exert independence while doing it. “I don’t know what to do,” Harry heard himself say. “I can’t tell what he’s getting into.”
“I never had a mum before.”  For some reason, Harry wanted to explain—not to excuse his actions, but so that Draco would understand.  He wanted Draco to understand the way that Harry had acted toward him had nothing to do with Draco liking boys or ribbons or books; it had to do with the way that Draco had acted.  “I never had anybody who was kind to me,” Harry went on.  “Not really.  Ron was kind.  You were—Draco, you were cruel to him.”
“I never said it was.”
Draco was already leaving the kitchen, so Harry finished his breakfast in a flash, Scourgifying his plate so fast it left streaks of syrup still on it.  Putting it away anyway, Harry rushed out of the kitchen, through the sitting room, and clambered down the stairs.
Not finished with breakfast yet, Harry was still stuffing toast with jam in his mouth.  “Where?” he said, his mouth full of crust.
“I think at Hogwarts you say some of them aloud,” Draco said.  “You could be very cheeky when you wanted to be.”
“I don’t know why you said it.  I’m just trying to—I just—you said it, so I’m . . . .  I’ll fix it.  I can fix it, Harry.  You said you trusted me, that I was . . . .  I don’t need anyone’s help.”  The bags under Draco’s eyes made him look unhappy—rather desperately unhappy, and his mouth turned down.
“I can hold the book for you, Harry.”  His voice eagerly solicitous, Draco grabbed the book away.  “I’ll keep your place, so you can look at the letters.  That’s what I do for Vince.  I’m a good friend, aren’t I?”
“No,” Malfoy said. “I worked that out on my own. Father . . .” He trailed off. “Let’s say he wasn’t active enough for me.”
Harry stepped in front of Draco on instinct, Alby’s oily voice recalling enough instances of Draco getting called names that Harry instantly felt the urge to protect him.  “I’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry said.
Harry looked down at him, and he loved this too. He didn’t know why. Something about seeing Draco this mortified made him feel like he was falling in love all over again. “I think I’ve made it clear how much I like holding your dick,” Harry said finally.
“Usually you can’t shut me up,” Teddy said.
“What about my parents?” Harry said, louder, as the owl landed on Mister Malfoy’s shoulder once more.
Slowly, Malfoy got to his feet.  “Potter,” he said, his voice soft and warm.  “What the fuck is wrong with you?”
“Are we friends?”
Laughing at him, Gareth turned to go. “Close the door,” Harry told him, and Gareth left them alone.
Between his leg, his cock rose, the pulses of blood Draco was magically sending into it flooding his cock in time to Draco’s thrusts. Then Draco did that other spell, the one that would make Harry come even though he really shouldn’t, even though he felt like he really didn’t have any more come left to give.
Draco had written,
“I’m always trying to win.”  Draco tossed his head.  “You just don’t know me well enough.”
Draco’s hands were in his hair, drawing him back for teasing little kisses, petting him gently then scratching nails across Harry’s scalp so that he could feel it; he could really feel it. “Fuck,” Harry said again, and Draco murmured, “Shh. I’m here. I’m here for you, Harry. Undress me.”
“How?”
Harry still couldn’t help feeling amused.  “Let’s look at those memories from the Ward Record, shall we?” he asked, going back over to his Pensieve.
“I don’t know if the wards will admit me on my own,” Draco said, “but it should recognize you, even if you’re not the right age.”
“Why do you talk like this?” Harry blurted, unable to contain it.  “How come you’re always so—”
“Think of it, Harry,” Draco breathed, close to Harry’s ear, though fucking too hard to really stay there. “Think of something nice and thick in your mouth. Think of something hard brushing those lovely lips of yours. Think of something hard fucking against that lovely tongue.”
A knot of shallow dread tied itself in Harry’s throat, shutting him up. He
Harry had no idea what Draco meant, but he did what Draco said anyway, stepping into a long, dark hall.  Draco came in after him, shutting the door behind him and then lighting gas lamps in the entryway with his wand.  The lamps did little to dispel the gloom hanging in the house, which seemed full of rather more shadows than necessary.  Harry didn’t understand why he would live in such a dismal place, though it did seem as though it had once been rather grand.
“Love being taken from both ends, don’t you?” Gripping his hair, Draco forced Harry down farther on his cock. “Love being fucked. I bet I could get a whole group of men in here, and you would love it, wouldn’t you? You’d love bouncing on their big thick cocks. Big, strong wizard like you, taking it from every man in the room.”
“How do Snitches know where to fly?”
“Careful,” Harry said.  “I don’t want you to break your scabs.”
“She’s a Patronus,” Draco said.  “She can help protect me if there’s trouble.”
“I’ll keep that in mind.”
Frowning, Harry put his head over the side, almost wanting to put his glasses on so he could see Draco better.
The man’s mouth opened, then closed.  His face changed colour twice—first pink, then a sickish grey.  “Kidnapping?” he croaked.
Malfoy took another sharp breath.
“But why did you testify for
“Then what are you talking about?”
. Of course he was willing to do whatever it took, whatever was asked of him, because he was not the one in a position of power, because he was not the one who had learned everything he needed to know, because he was not the one who moved the pieces on the board. Shacklebolt was meant to be better than Dumbledore. He was meant to be
Malfoy beamed up at him.  “That’s nothing!”  Loosening the hold of his wand on the feather, Malfoy re-aimed.  As the feather floated lazily back to the table, Malfoy shouted at the table, “
“It just sort of sounded like you were going to talk about a sex dream. You had that sex dream voice.”
Draco had left the silver deer behind.
“No,” Harry gasped out. “No. Draco.”
Draco gave him a strange look.  “You’d thought I’d forget?  Also, I just got these memories; for me, it happened barely four days ago.”
“Therefore, you have to help me,” Mister Malfoy said.  “You have to tell me if you want or need anything.  Anything you want or need, I’ll give it to you.  Do you understand?”
“Oh!  I wonder if you have the—yes!  You have
Harry looked at him, the memory of a younger Malfoy still fresh on his mind. He had been better looking, then, his hair brighter, his sharp features softer, rather than hollowed-out and bony. Harry swallowed hard. “Okay,” he said, because he didn’t want to treat Malfoy differently on account of nightmares and Pensieves.
Harry opened his eyes, smiling. “And Baggot?”
Harry waited for more, but Draco was apparently done.  “Can I put those protection spells on you now?” Harry asked, after another moment.
Harry sighed. “I can’t force you to leave.”
Harry looked down at the guitar. “Okay, maybe I’m a little brutal.”
Draco had told him, and now Harry understood what it meant—only that couldn’t explain Nott.  Malfoy was too young to like Nott in that way.  Harry had been twenty and just stumbling out of a three-year relationship with Ginny when he realized he’d liked blokes; realizing he in fact preferred them had taken even longer.  No way did Malfoy know anything about that now.
“Him and his friends.”  Harry finally tried a sip of his milk.  It wasn’t that bad.  “They beat me up all the time.”
“Just do the bloody potion, will you?” Harry said, holding out the phial of Wood-Eye Lye.
Malfoy didn’t seem to care.  One of his hands slid up along Harry’s jaw, his temple, until Malfoy’s thumb was brushing Harry’s scar.  The other snaked inside of Harry’s robe, finding Harry’s waist, pulling him closer, pulling him up against Draco’s lean hard body.  Harry went; he’d go anywhere.  He’d do anything Malfoy wanted.
Andromeda moved the paper aside quickly, looking a bit alarmed.  “I believe he felt it too dangerous.  Come,” she said, standing and setting the paper aside.  “Let’s get that cereal.”
Harry looked over at Draco, whose head had turned on the couch to watch as Harry cleaned.  “I don’t know,” Harry said, finishing up the rinsing spells.
Alby gurgled.  “I—Mrs. Mulpepper!”
“I’ll keep that in mind.”
“Give it to me.”  Malfoy flung out his arm, hand open toward Harry, even though his body was still turned away.
“Why?” Harry asked, because he wanted to hear all about Draco’s dad.  Maybe he had been the brave wizard who had defeated the bad one—but if he had been Draco probably would’ve said.  Maybe Draco hadn’t wanted to brag.  Maybe—
“You want to know why I broke up with Rune? You want to know why I can’t have other romantic relationships? You want to know why my Pensieve is full of you and why I can’t sleep at night and why half of the time won’t come near you and why just a look from you, just a word, is something I live on for hours, days, weeks, why summer is torture and I don’t
“Yes.”  Harry put his glasses back on.  “I still like you.”
“No,” Harry agreed.  “He’s just a ponce.”
Harry didn’t tell Kavika.
“Hold still.”  Malfoy was looking at the pocket watch.  “I’m getting your blood pressure.”
“Stick it in.”
Harry looked down at it, feeling surprised enough that his blankness returned. “I told you to stop doing this.”
Malfoy still seemed tense.  “I suppose . . . I suppose . . .”  Then he was shrugging awkwardly, turning back to the lab bench, pressing on a balance scale and releasing it, just to see it pop up.  “I’ve got to be busy with my job and such, if I’m to be Minister for Magic.  No need to settle down right away.  I was always saying to Mother—do you know, Harfang Munter wasn’t married until he was nearly seventy.  He was too busy fighting duels and running Durmstrang and working on martial magic to bother with girls.  Gilderoy Lockhart isn’t married, and not because he couldn’t be.  He’s got more important things to do.”
“Poor slut,” Draco said at last, when he was finally slowing. “Accio green toy.”
Fairchild behaving in her capacity as a member of our law-abiding Force?” asked Pillwickle. “Or did she aid and abet a vigilante organization to monitor the wards and pursue criminals at their own discretion, rather than seek aid of law enforcement? And if I’m not mistaken, one of our other trainees joined in this criminal activity as well.” Pillwickle smirked at Harry. “Or did you come to plead the case of your favourite little trainee once more?”
Harry’s thumb brushed over the ink. Last term, figuring out how to remove Malfoy’s Dark Mark had occupied his time. He needed something else like that.
“Business?” Malfoy feigned shocked. “As though Lord Parkinson would ever! He’s a professional man of leisure.”
“He was,” Greengrass agreed pleasantly. “Recently Astoria’s began to find him . . . unreliable. Unpredictable. It’s a shame, really. One would think the union of Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Black would produce an extraordinary heir, but instead we are left with this . . . little scrap of nothing, really.”
“Well, I . . . and you . . .” Draco scrubbed his face.  “I hang about with you, so don’t I . . . don’t we . . . ?”
Harry glanced down at the vial. “When did this—”
“Here,” said Fairchild, raising her glass. “To Astoria.”
Kavika let the silence hold, a waiting thing that prowled about the room as Harry chased his thoughts, but then seemed at last to turn a circle on the floor between them and settle down to sleep. As if sensing the fact that Harry had mentally repeated their argument about it several times and had at last accepted once more the fact that he was allowed, indeed, to be anxious, Kavika said, “Bennet really worries you?”
Harry’s nose, which Malfoy had already broken once—long ago, in sixth year—closed.
“Everything all right?”  Harry realized he hadn’t wiped his hands when he’d run out of the kitchen.  “
“No,” Harry said, a little roughly.  “You’ve just . . . reminded me of you.  When you’re older.”
Harry knew that Draco could see his scar.  When Petunia had shaved his head, she’d left his fringe to cover it up because it was so horrible.  Harry had always found his scar rather cool.
For some reason, Harry could feel tears sting behind his eyes.  He wanted to say something—
“Harry,” Andromeda said.
“Then you’re not interested in marriage.”  Draco was looking at the cards.
“Harry,” Mister Malfoy said, sounding urgent.  “Can I—are you all right?”
“Let me do it with you.”  Harry waited for a moment to Malfoy to acquiesce, but then he saw that Malfoy wasn’t going to, and if Harry waited a second longer, Malfoy was going to put his nose up and insist he could do it by himself again.  “Like this.”  Harry had spent enough time with Teddy and Rose and Hugo that he knew how to do a spell with a child.  Leaning a little behind Draco’s back so he could reach, Harry curled his arm around Draco’s shoulders, lining up with Draco’s arm, then put his hand on Draco’s.  “Now we lift it up like this,” Harry said, raising his arm with Draco’s.  “
Harry wanted to say yes and be done with it, because he didn’t know how to describe the things he was feeling.  He tried anyway, because he was thinking of the boy who
“A Fiendfyre fighter.”
“So, we’ve met again,” Draco said, when Harry opened the door to the shop.
The sadness in Kavika’s voice made Harry’s gaze snap back to her.
Dark Arts,” Fudge said, pretty much as disingenuously as possible. “Wouldn’t being bad at Dark Arts make one spectacular at Light Arts?”
Malfoy headed toward the door, and Harry turned from him to attend the wards. He was just beginning the protection spells when Malfoy’s voice stopped him.
“Let’s move on to the next exercise,” Harry said to the class. He moved away, but when he looked again, Teddy still had on that little smile, and Malfoy was on his knees so that Teddy could reach him for the chokehold from behind.
After breakfast they worked on potion things in the laboratory.  Draco didn’t give Harry a book again, instead having Harry help with the indicator solutions.  They made thirteen of them, and five tested positive.  After the first successful one, Harry looked up at Draco and asked—trying to hide his disappointment—“Does this mean you can make a cure?”
“NDEs,” said Malfoy. “Neo-Death Eaters. What’s a Hearing Raid?”
“Stay behind me!” Draco said frantically, pushing Harry back.  Lunging forward, he shouted, “
Savage knew Harry would never willingly neglect a case—not when a brew was on the streets getting people killed.  Swallowing a sigh, Harry added the file to the growing stack on his desk.  That was how he became the go-to person for illegal potion cases, and how Draco Malfoy became the unofficial potions consultant for the entire Auror Department.
“Very good, Harry. You did so well, coming all over my hand. I’m so good at fucking you; I’m perfect at it. I could do it all day.” Then he whispered, “Tell me if you need it to stop, Harry,” and he picked up his wand again, and began the spell all over again, stroking blood back into Harry’s cock.
“G-get away from me,” Draco said feebly.
“Exactly.  Besides,” Draco added, another trace of a smile ghosting his cheeks, “I have no experience with breaking into the Ministry.  It will be great moral support to go with someone who’s done it before.”
“You can stop them!” Spragg said at the same time as Savage accused Penelope: “You’re the one who said we shouldn’t have Malfoy.”
“Sure,” Harry said again, expelling a breath.
“You’re not going to tell me you’re a Concealer so we can protect the precious non-magical people?”
“This so-called cure!”
Harry heard himself make a sound.
“It feels like I would be hurting myself!” Harry said, startling himself. “It feels like it would be unfair to me, to that person I was, who was hurt, to the person
“I’m saying ‘should’ is a word I don’t think applies when it comes to us and Draco Malfoy.” Ron gave him a melancholy smile. “We don’t owe him anything.”
“Malfoy—”
Harry had asked Kavika last year, after Hermione had told them why the European Union had to be involved in Reveal.
“Are you comfortable, Andromeda?” Malfoy said, hovering, even though he had cast maybe a dozen little breezes for her and filled her glass maybe fifty times, even when it didn’t need filling. Andromeda had eventually tucked it away behind some of the tulle, possibly afraid that Malfoy might make it overflow.
glass of milk,” was all Mister Malfoy said, and then, “It’s okay.  Potter, the books have stopped.”
Yin handed him the magic crystals. “You got that non-mag mind healer, right?” When Harry nodded, Yin went on, “Boy, wouldn’t I love to pick their brain. How do you even do mind-healing without Legilimens? Or even a Pensieve?”
“I’m trying,” Harry said.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, and Malfoy abruptly stopped. “I already said, I know you didn’t do it.”
When Harry cast his Patronus, a crowd roared its approval for the silver stag, then pressed in to ask him what it was, begging to see it again. “It’s a Patronus,” Harry told them. “I’ve sent it to see my friend and ask him how he is.”
sex?” asked Hermione. “Do we know that part?”
“In the morning,” Draco said, standing also and picking up the satchel he’d brought.
“Yours,” Harry said hoarsely.
Malfoy closed his eyes, his brow lined with frustration.  “Do it over there, Potter.”
“Right,” said Hermione. “Or he’s in love with you.”
“Yes, Potter.  We went to school together.”  Mister Malfoy’s mug made a harsh clack on the table.  Standing up, he said, “If you’re feeling quite better, I can run some diagnostics on you, and we can see about reversing that potion.”
Taking off his glasses, Harry slowly cleaned them. “All right, I’m not going to fight the Board.”
“You think I wouldn’t dance with you?”
The problem with some people being magical and some people not being magical was that it was a hard divide that was always going to exist, always going to separate people. The point of Reveal was to lessen that divide, but while it was happening everything felt so much worse. The Timothy Tree felt so far removed, something that couldn’t and would never care, and Harry wanted to be underneath it more than ever.
“He could be the supplier,” Draco said.  On Draco’s timeline, Alby had only just sacked Draco.  “It makes sense; he was always disappearing at weird times, but I never knew why.  I didn’t try to find out; I didn’t care—where are you going?”
The potion seeped into his hair.
“Oh shit,” Ron said, apparently just realizing that this may have been an issue.  “Did you tell him?”
“Haven’t you heard? I’m Harry Potter.”
“I just wanted to say, sir,” another initiate said, “I heard the admin had to send Draco Malfoy’s application up through the Board for approval, and I think it’s wrong they’ve done it. They should’ve sent him to prison, just like they should have the rest of his lot.”
The brew was called Dream Dram, and Harry had linked it to a string of Muggle deaths.  What he was trying to find out was what exactly the potion did, as arresting his current suspect without that detail was likely to backfire.  While Savage haggled about the bribe, Harry saw a man in back trying to slink off behind the shelves.
“Yes,” Harry said, taking his arm off Draco’s shoulders.
them? Potter, there’s not some secret cabal, covertly cheering me on, installing people like me in the Ministry. I’m here to
“It’s because old-me is a git.”  This would have been a point where Harry would push up his glasses; it felt strange to not have to do so any more.  “That’s what you’re saying, right?”
“Fuck.”  Draco put his forehead down on his knees.  Heloise flapped a bit, tapping his arm with her beak.
“Just for that, I’m going to dance with him.” Vinicius thrust his drink at Harry, who took it with some bemusement.
“Supper is very important!” Malfoy called after him, but he would come. All other things aside, Malfoy was still in love with him. Harry had heard it in Malfoy’s voice when he’d said Vinicius’s name, and perhaps what Harry had told Kavika had happened after all. Malfoy would do the right thing. Even if it was only because of his feelings for Harry, Harry wasn’t above taking advantage of them—not for something this important. Not if it meant catching Death Eaters who were still killing non-magical people.
The Invisibility Cloak slipped off as Harry crashed to the floor at Malfoy’s feet, still curled into his hiding position.
“Oh, you mean the impending travel crisis and economic meltdown when the non-mag world learns we can travel anywhere we want whenever we want—and, by the way, Summon most things we want?”
Mister Malfoy’s five-p eyes shone brighter in the firelight.  “And Harry,” he added softly, “you don’t have to hide things from me.  You don’t have to pretend to feel differently than you do.”
Malfoy shrugged again.  “I don’t suppose that matters.  I’m obviously my own person.  I bet I’ve done all sorts of things he wouldn’t expect.”  He pressed the scale again, absently watching it jump.  “What’s Dad up to, anyway?”  He whirled around.  “
“Wow. I don’t even really remember that. On his list of crimes.”
The next page of the ledger contained information about what the cure would do once administered.  Harry had hoped that once Draco drank the potion he would instantly age.  The reality appeared far more complicated.
“They’ve captured an innocent man,” Harry said. “What evidence do we need?”
“So do I.” Malfoy’s voice was raw, and Harry turned away.
“But it’s easier,” Harry said. “It’s easier to be with someone if they’ve been through—if they know about it. The wizarding world.”
“You know that I could,” Harry said.  He couldn’t take Draco with him—not because of protocol. Draco could be hurt.
Harry didn’t want to say anything about Vinicius, not anymore. Instead, he said, “Okay.”
The arm around Harry’s shoulders lifted, and Harry was certain he had said something wrong, but then Draco’s hand brushed in Harry’s hair.  It swept the fringe away from his brow in a gentle motion, and then the arm was back around Harry’s shoulders, warm and reassuring.  With his other hand, Draco turned the page.  “You’re missing the point of this,” Draco said.  “I didn’t want to show you my family history; I wanted to show you some of yours.”
Instead, a yellow-haired reporter asked Harry, “Do you think Lupin couldn’t handle it?”
“Merlin,” Draco breathed. “That dildo is still fucking you.” Then he came, just as he had said, all over Harry’s face, and Harry closed his eyes. He felt it splash on his eyelids, his forehead, across his cheek, Draco’s cock thrusting wildly on Harry’s face, Draco’s hands holding Harry’s head in place so he could get it on him. “Play with yourself,” Draco whispered, breathless.
“Maybe you were right.”  Harry pushed his glasses up.  “The Dursleys aren’t very nice at all.”
Eventually Draco came upstairs and asked Harry what he wanted for lunch.  He seemed to be startled when Harry asked for the chicken salad again.  It was good salad, even though Andromeda’s chicken and dumplings were better.  Harry would never tell anybody.  He’d defend Draco’s magic cooking to his grave.
The initiate was likely just eighteen, barely out of Hogwarts, stars still in his eyes over the thought of being taught by Harry Potter.

“The Regents,” Ron said. “When they didn’t get him passed.”
“You already
“I meant since—” Malfoy cut himself off, face contorting. He drew back. “I haven’t, since then. I’m not.”
“No.” Kavika smiled. “It’s good
“I do feel better.”
31 years
Harry had been a bit harassed by reporters when the article had come out about the potions accident, but Harry was used to that.  About Draco, Harry was more worried, since Draco was not prepared for being famous after the quiet life he had lived—but then again, it was Draco.  He’d said he’d always wanted to be important, and a part of Draco had probably meant it, despite all the other parts at war with himself.  Harry hoped that all of this meant that Draco could become closer to the person he wanted to be, a person he really was, instead of what his parents had hoped for him.  There was no way Draco would ever completely lose that initial conditioning, but he could still change.
Fairchild believed that first non-magborn witches and wizards should come out to their non-mag families and friends, which would ease the way for the broader revelation of the Wizarding World. Wan argued this would put non-magborn witches and wizards at risk—non-mags had armies, weapons, and reasons to fear magic. Achar argued that Reveal should begin with dropping wards in a single small wizarding town, such as Hogsmeade, again allowing a smaller reveal before wider exposure. The bald woman pointed out that the problem was the same: Hogsmeade would be vulnerable to non-mags who feared magic.
“We do.”  Harry swallowed.  “It . . . takes a long time.”
“Right.” Coming the rest of the way into the room, Malfoy Banished the outer robe he had worn for the ceremony. Underneath, he had on sleek trousers, a tailored coat. Banishing the coat as well, Malfoy revealed a silver waistcoat and a slate blue shirt. Pointing his wand at the cuff of his left arm, Malfoy cast another spell to roll up the sleeve.
“Scandalous, Harry! He’s your godson.”
“I know.” Malfoy took a step forward. “I know I did, but I’ve—”
But his hands weren’t on them any more; his upper body wasn’t on him, and Draco was rubbing Harry’s come on his own body, and the kisses were almost like—a distraction, as if Harry wouldn’t see that Draco was doing it. Pushing Draco off of him, Harry got Draco down on the mattress again, Draco blinking at him in startlement. “I’m going to lick it off you,” Harry said, then proceeded to do it.
Malfoy’s eyes followed Harry’s coffee for a moment, as though he found it interesting, and Harry remembered the way he used to be embarrassed for Malfoy, for the way Malfoy would look at him. Now Harry felt embarrassed for himself. He
“Marrying?” Harry said, because—was that really happening? Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass? When Malfoy’s Patronus was a stag? Harry felt sick again.
“Right,” Duggins said quickly. “Right. Just making sure I’m following.”
without anything to fasten it.  Holy fuck.
If Malfoy’s face had been a house with a door and a window open, it looked now as though another window was opening. “Tell me about them.”
Harry nearly gasped the word, because that low, pooling ache was filling his whole groin: “Cock.”
,” Draco said, and his nose hairs finally started ungrowing back into his nose.  “I must find a way to stop all this nonsense.
, Harry.”
Penelope whirled on him next. “We
Harry couldn’t help his smile. “You prefer the word cock?”
“So if someone began to dismantle them, you would know,” Harry said.
“Harry.” Draco’s voice was softly chiding as he reached for him. “I’ve dreamed of doing this with you in your bed for more than half my life. Do you think I care if it’s made?” Then Draco was kissing him again—one of those deep, clever kisses that made Harry feel like he wasn’t getting enough, like he was gasping along the surface when all he wanted to do was drown.
Harry took the water. Malfoy wasn’t looking at him, already casting another spell.
Another commotion filled the entrance, the sound of the heavy outside door, the swish of robes, the murmur as people began to comment on the new arrival. Harry’s head whipped around. There, just as beautiful, with his slim hips, bright eyes, and messy hair, stood Rune Photsi, and Harry’s heart jumped into his throat. Someone must have invited him. Had Malfoy known Rune would be here?
“Duds!” someone called from inside the flat.
“You have a flower-chair, Malfoy?” Andromeda said, her tone a little mocking.
“I didn’t mean to sleep in the bed.”
Draco’s eyes grew from five-p coins to fifty-p ones.
“We both did a lot of sneaking around,” Harry offered.
Harry bit his lip, trying to think about it, trying to remember. “I just don’t remember pain. I remember
“You saved me,” Luna said, turning on her raft of algae to face him. “You got me out, and I’m alive. But sometimes I think the only way out is to burn down the whole house.”
Malfoy grinned in triumph.
“You really loved Hogwarts, didn’t you?” Harry asked one day, as Teddy received his third owl.
“I have a desk?” Harry perked up.  Having a desk made him sound pretty important.
Was that even what stood in the way?
Done with the boots, Harry stood.  “I always wanted to build things.”
“So desperate,” Draco murmured.  His hand caressed the curve of Harry’s left buttock, warm and perfect, then disappeared. Then he slapped the flesh he’d just caressed.
“How do you know?” Alby demanded, slime still drooling out of his mouth.  “You can’t know with Death Eaters!  You just can’t—”
Magic flowed through Harry.  It poured out from Harry’s heart, filling up his fingertips as though they were sizzling.  The heat behind his eyes let him know what was happening.  He wasn’t angry.  He was going to cry.  “Draco,” he said, and even his voice sounded wet.
“Come on,” Harry said. “I want to see it.”
“Finite incantatem,” Harry said, pointing at himself, and then he could hear it: the buzz of the wireless, the babble of voices rising and falling, the click of dishware and glasses. Closing his eyes, Harry let it wash over him, a part of it and also outside of it, like Luna had said.
“No.”  Scowling, Malfoy drank his shot, and Harry had to turn away from the long pale line of Malfoy’s throat as he knocked it back.
Harry tucked in immediately.
For a moment, the view on the IC:WUT/UC didn’t change, showing the retreating Dementors, the gloriously large stag, the Aurors battling three NDEs each behind them. Then the view slowly, almost with effort, pulled down into the trunk. “Good,” Harry whispered. “That’s so good; drop the marble. Do it now.”
Abruptly, Harry let him go. Malfoy’s hand clapped down over the newly clear skin of his own arm. He was looking away, but he was swaying where he stood, and when Harry moved so he could see his face, his eyes were closed, and wet. “Are you all right?” Harry grabbed his shoulder to steady him again. “Malfoy?”
“It must have done,” Draco said.  “Upstairs, I think.”
“Very good.”  Draco beamed at him.  “Now I’ll read you the next part, and you’ll get the hang of it.”
“Do we call all organizations who seek to help magical and non-magical citizens alike terrorists?” Spragg wanted to know.
Malfoy whined again, but Harry had already cast the blood extraction spell, pulling out Voldemort’s blood and the old, dead blood of a younger Malfoy. Then there was only the scar. “Oh,” Malfoy said, jerking as Harry began to heal it.
“No one attacked me,” Harry affirmed, beginning to take another step forward.
“Shoulders. It helped to—feel what you meant.”
“Lee,” said Harry. “He has connections with the
The next day was a Sunday, which meant there would be no Academy classes, but Harry would see Malfoy at Rombe Pickle for a meeting of the Order of the Phoenix. The Order had grown since autumn, taking on more and more non-magical members—friends and family of non-mag-born magical people. By the time Malfoy rolled out of the Floo, the room was already packed, but Malfoy walked straight to Harry, a bundle of scrolls under his arms.
“Apology accepted,” Harry said, having a sip from his own pint.
Baggot. “It’s already been—”
“Yeah,” Harry said, and he kissed him again.  Draco was ready for it this time, opening his mouth, but Harry was shoving against him anyway, tipping Draco’s head back so Harry could kiss him more deeply.  Draco was letting him, bending almost backward, just like a girl in one of Petunia’s stupid movies.  Fuck.  Harry wanted to slam him down on the lab bench.
“Good. They’re fine.” Harry thought about this, the subjects they had still to cover, his star pupils, the trainees who were struggling. How it felt in class. “I worry about Bennet,” he heard himself say, without quite knowing he was going to.
Alby still had his hands on his throat, eyes darting about the room in panic.
“I would feel better about it.”
Malfoy waggled the broomstick. “Take it. We’re taking out the big boy spells, now.” Then he turned to the reporters. “Who wants to hear about who my father’s paying under the table to gin up support for a referendum on the Reveal vote?”
!” Malfoy shouted.
“I’m sorry.” Turning around to look at his desk, Harry found a quill. Pulling a fresh sheet of parchment toward him, he began to jot down notes. “And you tried scarring potions? Burn treatment potions?”
31 years
“I just figured I don’t—I don’t say it enough, that I love you.”
“Of course, you have. But when it mattered?” Malfoy arched a brow, and Harry thought off people he could have helped, and hadn’t. “If you say your own godfather, or Dumbledore, or any of those people,” Malfoy added, “I’ll call you a liar.”
His voice was still soft, but Harry figured he’d better do what Mister Malfoy said, so he went and sat at the table.
“What does that have to do with us?” Penelope threw up her hands. “Our job is to educate, not worry about what—”
“Are you all right?”
“Hullo, Malfoy.” Harry held out the champagne flute to Malfoy. “I thought you looked like you could use a drink.”
Usually Harry was happy to return to work, never feeling quite comfortable with nothing to do in the time between Teddy returned to Hogwarts and Academy starting its term. When Harry had first quit the Aurors, he had tried to take time off, but he had spent too much of that time alone with his thoughts.
Draco-in-Harry’s-body touched the hair on the side of his chin, as though he had forgot it was there.  “I asked you, once, but you . . . I thought it was because it looks . . . .  You started wearing it that way when you were around twenty-eight.”
“Why can’t you just look it up?” Petunia said.
“I thought so.” Malfoy’s voice was triumphant, but nothing like the softness of his voice when he had bested Harry in sparring. “I heard Goyle’s trunk hit you. And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back. You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I’ve got you here . . .”
In a flat in Cambridge, not so very far from the Higgledy Piggledy, Draco switched off the wireless.
At last, Harry pulled away. “What were you thinking?” he asked, before realizing Malfoy had said the exact same thing.
of that, in one fell swoop, and you can’t even—you can’t even do that? Just that?”
“We don’t want to be drastic, now,” Baggot said.
“Harry,” Draco whispered.  “I like how you are, too.”
This seemed like a pretty insensitive reaction, for which Harry found himself truly grateful.
27 years
“I told you supper is important.” Malfoy voice was prim. “You should listen to me.”
“Harry,” Draco whispered.  “Stop.”
“Nothing.” Malfoy stood, walking two paces to set the water on the desk and lay the chocolate next to it, the arrangement somehow precise. When he turned to Harry, he was still holding his arm, and he didn’t meet Harry’s eyes. “I should go to the pub. To the celebration. To my boyfriend,” he added, after a moment.
“Well,” Draco said, putting his nose up.  “I like dragons.  Not foxes.”
Tracing it with his finger, Draco sat like that a little while, reminding Harry of the way eleven-year-old Draco had sat with him on the sofa and poked his scar.  Maybe Draco was remembering as well.  When Draco spoke again, he’d obviously been thinking about what Harry had said.  His tone had completely changed. “You don’t know when people want you to touch them?”
Malfoy had looked at Harry’s scar.
“Why don’t you suggest something?” Harry said, trying not to feel impatient.
“Sorry.”  Tentatively, Harry touched Draco’s hair again.
“Oh, yes, Harry,” Draco said softly.  “Draco is a dragon.”  He moved his wand over the sky, connecting dots to draw a long worm-like shape with a box for a head.
He felt as though his insides were too big to contain the things he felt; he couldn’t bear this any longer. Pushing Draco off of him, Harry held him down, got on top. “I need to fuck you,” Harry said, hating how his voice sounded rough when he’d meant to say I love you. “I need to fuck you right now.”
They stood there.
, Harry wanted to tell him, but Malfoy was already grabbing his robe, rushing for his satchel, and it was a lie. Malfoy must have known that Harry thought Malfoy’s sultry teasing was a joke; he must have counted on Harry not to take it seriously. And of course, Malfoy hadn’t been able to cast a Patronus before now.
“You weren’t faking it.  You were never—”  Draco cut himself off again.
Harry picked up the cup. It smelled just like his favourite—better than his favourite. Malfoy had been right. La Reve with the oat milk did the best flat white. Sighing, Harry took off the lid, blew on the coffee, and sat down to drink it.
“Mum would know what it meant if she saw it long.”  Draco switched the slides again, still focused on the microscope.  “She was always keen like that.”
“I suppose I needed ingredients.”  Draco didn’t sound very interested, and Harry didn’t correct him.  “That book.”  Sounding troubled, Draco nodded again at the ledger.  “I use a lot of words, don’t I?”
expectations.”  Draco put his nose up, even though the rest of him was slumped against the side of the couch.
“You don’t think people can change, Harry?” Draco asked softly.
“But—but I was talking about—
“I never thought of you as deterministic,” Kavika said.
“I know I don’t have an appointment,” Harry said, before Malfoy could snap at him.  “I’ve got a bit of an emergency.”
“You never know, Potter,” Malfoy said lightly. “The vial might explode. The memory might prove me a serial killer.”
“I don’t think I can do that.”  Harry pressed his lips against Draco’s hair again.
“Yes.”  Draco seemed to be fiddling with the order of the books.
“It doesn’t bother me,” Harry said. “I meant—”
Malfoy nodded. “Rare, but it happens. If you bound someone to you and killed them to steal their life magic, their life magic would hold enough of their consciousness to fight against yours. The battle would rip apart a human person. If you bound a tree to you and killed it—trees aren’t sentient in the same way, but they’re still powerful. The stillness of them, the calm of them—it would crush you.”
“We’re done with the diagnostics for now,” Draco said, coming over toward the window.  “I got this for you.”  He handed over the book.
Then he was being pulled closer, and Harry knew it was Draco.  It was Draco’s strong arm going around him, Draco’s hard chest pressing against his face, Draco’s voice roughly saying, “Harry,” once more before the air popped again.  The street and the dancing taxi and the door with the address all swirled away, and there was only Draco.
The door opened, and all thoughts of yesterday having been imagined flew out of Harry’s head.  Draco stood there, looking extremely real, and Harry knew he couldn’t dream up anybody who looked quite like him.  “Did you sleep well, Harry?” Draco said.
“Sort of.”
“Er,” Harry said.  He looked down at the page.  “Queen Alisbah—”
“Exactly,” Hermione said. “If we do Reveal, it doesn’t just impact that UK. The Wizard World will be part of the EU.”
Pointing his wand, Harry casting a simple silence spell.  It didn’t stop Draco from staring at Alby, Draco’s eyes so big, his brows up, lips slightly parted, as if he still couldn’t quite believe what was going on.  Slowly, he turned to Harry, and Harry could tell that Draco had the same question.
Malfoy began to smile. “Why, Edgar, you sly dog. You’re of more consequence than I thought.”
“Funny story . . .” Mark went on to tell his story about meeting Fairchild, and Harry edged closer to Nyala, who had cast a Notice-Me-Not on herself as soon as Fairchild and Mark had appeared. It didn’t mean no one could see her, but the spectacle of the floating people was distracting enough that when Harry reinforced her Notice-Me-Not with his own, they were able to slip away.
says.’ Does all blood do that for you? Or just pure blood? Or is it bigot blood? Have you tried it with mine?”
“Are you sure? Do you need . . . a Weasley?”
He was like grown Malfoy in miniature, with his neat little trousers and his neat little dress shirt—his little
For a moment, Harry almost thought she might hug him, but instead she turned to lead him down the hall, leaving him to close the door as usual. “How is Laila?” Harry asked as he followed her down the softly lit corridor.
“Yes.” Ron smiled. “We’ve heard.”
Malfoy glared at him, and Harry wanted to roll his eyes.
Kavika swallowed before she spoke, and when she did her voice was thick, even rougher than usual. “Some would say there is no point. Not in trying to change them. Purist, blood supremacists, Old Blood families. That the idea of hoping they’ll change is a luxury of those in control. It’s a privilege of power.”
“Why must you?” Harry asked.
Harry rubbed the scar on the back of his hand.
The Fountain had been discovered before, but it was a protected under the U.S.’s Secret of Secrets Act, much like the U.K.’s It Was Lost for a Reason Statute.  Places like Atlantis, El Dorado, and Avalon were said to be protected under such laws, as well as naturally occurring magical things such as the tree of gold apples, the Fountain of Youth, and love springs.  People could know about them but should never be able to find them.  This would draw into question their existence, which would further protect the magic places.
“I wouldn’t go that far,” said Spragg.
“It’s an election year,” Hermione said. “A new Minister for Magic would appoint a different Head Auror.”
Malfoy grimaced.  “I’m trying to talk to you.”
“Oh,” Harry said.
“I was worried,” Harry said.
, the bureaucracy, and you see what people really are—but it’s not what they really are, because there can be hope. There can be change; it just—and with Reveal, there’s no way it can’t be worse; there’s no way it gets any—” Harry cut himself off.
Kavika’s face went softer, warm with something almost like pity and exactly like compassion. “Perhaps that’s why he concerns you so. If he who matters least can change, perhaps that matters most.”
Harry thought she hadn’t looked so bad, but he supposed Draco knew better than he did.  It seemed strange that Draco could have an awful family member and grow up to be so nice anyway, but Harry guessed Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were technically members of his family, so maybe it didn’t make much of a difference.
“I know. Teddy’s smart. He’s strong.” Harry rubbed the scar on his hand. “It’s his choice.”
The plant was some kind of bush.  Peeking through its leaves, Harry could make out the person who had opened the door.  He didn’t look like Dudley at all, for he was old like a grown-up, and his hair wasn’t nearly as blond as Dudley’s.  He was quite large, however—sort of like how Uncle Vernon would look, if Uncle Vernon looked a bit more like Aunt Petunia.
Draco shuddered. “Not yet. I didn’t want to—yet.”
“You think I’m dancing with you . . . to make a political point?”
to have sex with Nearly Headless Nick?”
“Voldemort wasn’t a political opponent,” Harry said.  “He was a megalomaniac who staged a coup and killed a lot of people in the process.”
He wasn’t even meant to be alive. He should have died in that forest; he should have died a thousand times. Sometimes, before his eleventh birthday, Harry used to think,
“I think you’re beautiful.”
“And how does that make you feel?”
“Just don’t eat too much,” Draco added.
“Just through there,” said Mister Malfoy, gesturing to the door behind them.
“I think I might be sort of messed up,” Harry said.
The faint smile came back.  “Yes.  You used to fly all the time for a sport we played in school.  It’s called Quidditch.  Even when you were very young you were quite good.  The best in our year, by far.”
The books were on fire.
“Show-off.”
Harry knew what she was trying to do, and it wasn’t going to work—but it was going to make him talk about Malfoy more, which maybe meant it was working after all. “It could, but it doesn’t. He was . . . flirting with me. A lot. Before then, I mean. I didn’t think he meant it.”
They went through the lab to the bedroom, where Harry reinforced the sagging bed with more enchantments to keep it a bunk bed.  He also Reducio’ed pyjamas for Draco, careful to avoid referencing the fact that the pyjamas in fact belonged to Draco’s older-self.  Younger-Draco had already mocked the size and furnishings of the bedroom, and Harry didn’t fancy Draco going through another breakdown when he learned how deeply he’d disappointed Lucius by living behind a shop.
“Well?” Malfoy said impatiently.
“I’ve got to go,” Harry said.
“I definitely don’t.”
“I said stay away!” Malfoy moved aside just as Harry was moving forward.
“You’re the one who wanted to talk.”
“Why!”  Draco stamped his foot.  He actually, literally, stamped his foot.  “What’s so special about Weasel?  What’s he got I haven’t got?”
Malfoy made a face. “How am I meant to improve?”
.”  He didn’t have to find a happy memory for the spell to work, since Draco was standing right there, the light from the book shining on his face and the wonder in his eyes so readily apparent.  The silver fox shot out the end of Harry’s wand and trotted over to Draco, who snapped the book closed in surprise.  Harry wasn’t surprised at all; his Patronus had been a fox since the day Narcissa died.
—” Draco looked away, his cheeks going pink.
Abel Alby, however, was the opposite of helpful.  Though he still fawned all over Harry, he actively tried to prevent Harry from dealing with Malfoy, obviously missing the pay-offs Savage used to give him in exchange for help with potions ID.  Furthermore, he was always saying awful things to Malfoy, things Harry tried not to listen to but couldn’t help but hear: Alby telling Malfoy what a waste of space he was, how no one wanted him.  Meanwhile Malfoy was constantly working in clothes that didn’t fit him, still too thin and not allowed use magic.
“That’s cool of you,” Teddy said, after a pause.
“How?”
“Only the most influential band in wizarding music of the nineties.”
“Yes,” Harry said immediately.
“The Order of the Phoenix,” said Savage. “Some of them were

“But what if they
to be killed. What do you think will happen, when we drop the wards? When we lift the Statute? They’ll be terrified of us, just as they always have been. What in the world makes you think that the kind of sentiment the Dark Lord stirred up against non-magicals won’t come back a thousand-fold when non-magicals start burning witches at the stake?”
Harry wanted to say.

though.  He was dead!  And who comes back on someone’s head!”
“Have you ever had a sleepover?”
Malfoy bit his lip.  “Mum says—she said I should wear a muted palette.”
“That’s all right,” Draco said, gently taking Harry’s hand and drying his thumb with a flannel.  “You did a good job.”
“Yes,” Harry said, even though he didn’t, really.  He was pretty excited about getting to stay with Mister Malfoy, though.  Maybe Mister Malfoy would never figure out the potion, and he could stay with him forever.
“Thank you, no,” Teddy said. “I’ve assignments to do.”
Harry stumbled back.
say it,” Draco said.
Hastily, Harry tried to straighten the sheets, fluffing the pillow.  He wondered if there was a bed-making spell, then wondered if all those things he remembered from yesterday were real at all.  Draco had made a magic
can do anything you want. You’re bloody—” Malfoy cut himself off again, making another gesture with his hand that seemed as though it was trying to describe everything that Harry was. “You can do anything you want,” he repeated, more softly.
“Prolong your life by binding something’s life magic to you and sacrificing it?” Malfoy asked. “Right, it doesn’t work. Flowers and insects, worms—their life magic is small, brief. Their magic will die out before you would. But if you bound a person’s life to you—or a tree—it could theoretically prolong your life, if it didn’t drive you mad.”
“Yes.”
“Draco,” Harry said.
His eyes were so wide they looked like mirrors, rimmed with red.
In response to demands of the press and large sector of the wizarding population, the Board had agreed to expel Travers for his harassment of Fairchild, but so far they had neglected to press any criminal charges. Fairchild herself had been looking into the possibility of doing so, but wizarding law surrounding crimes of Aurors was complicated, and currently the Auror Department was claiming that as a trainee, Travers should be considered an Auror for all intents and purposes.
“Did you go all the way back to London?” said Yin, aghast.
Malfoy ground his teeth.
Harry looked down at the cup in his hand. Sometimes, when he needed a quick Patronus, he thought of coffee. The cup was still warm.
“Sorry,” Malfoy said, then quickly added, “not very sorry. Fidgety. Need something to do with my hands. I was never like that, before sixth year.”
Rune’s face quickly brightened again as he described his idea: an international group that would focus on aid the wizarding world could bring to the non-magical world. “Of course, it’s contingent on the United Kingdom breaking the Statute, which it’s resolved to do. I recognize there are enough problems internally, trying to bring about the Deal, but in the last year, I’m sure you know Kingsley was more focused on the international issues.”
“We’ve got to go,” the man said, his voice low.  “
“She means you were always very brave and protective of your friends.”  Draco squeezed his hand.  “It’s not a bad thing.”
“Darling.”  Brushing Harry’s fringe aside, Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s scar.  Then he did it again, holding Harry and murmuring things, little things that Harry couldn’t hear, and yet the tone soothed him.  Draco’s hand in Harry’s hair soothed him; the warm hard length of Draco’s body soothed him.
Harry thought about escaping outside—the bright sunlight of August. The click of insects in the grass, the scent of sun on stones. The bright green rustle of leaves overhead, shifting to display splintering shadows. Malfoy under the Timothy Tree, steady and reassuring and so willing to search inside himself, to find himself, to be himself. Malfoy and Teddy under the Timothy Tree—Teddy, who had sorted through the options available to him, then made a new option for himself entirely.
Harry’s hands twitched. “I’m not telling you this—I’m not expecting anything in return,” he ended up saying. “I’m not—I’m just—you said I wasn’t being fair.” Harry locked his hands together in front of him. “I thought you deserved to know.”
“What’s here?” said Spragg. “You mean a purist culture that makes future Aurors think they can—”
“You needn’t worry about me,” Draco said, in that quiet way.  “I can—”
“I don’t.” Kavika cast the spell to heat the water again. “Not specifically. But you know I thought the Death Eaters should have received harsher punishment.”
“I know it hasn’t happened on
“That seems a little lacklustre.”
“What?” Harry paused for a moment in the wild incessant rocking of his arse down onto cock.
Draco’s head went back, and he laughed, but it was a kind, rich sound, which Harry found confusing but pleasant, nevertheless.  “I think we can both agree she looks exactly like a vulture,” Draco said, sounding amused.  “She was tyrannical, too.”
He did not, however, cross to the glass doors and the figure who had captured Harry’s interest. Instead, Malfoy moved to Pansy Parkinson, in whom Harry had exactly zero interest. “You’re looking radiant,” Malfoy told Parkinson, smiling in a way that was actually rather winning.
”  The tables and chairs and curtains stopped dancing.  The hot chocolate also stopped pouring, but that was mostly because it was all over the kitchen now.  Harry looked up at Mister Malfoy.  “Why aren’t you mad?” he heard himself say, even though he definitely hadn’t planned on it.
“No.  I’m fairly sure he doesn’t.”
“There’s no cause to be rude!” Whirling away, Spragg marched off down the hall.
“Dreams are weird,” said Yin. “People ascribe meaning to them, because they’re your brain trying to process things. But sometimes the way your brain needs to process is a way your waking self will never understand, so—you only have to take from them what you want to. Is there one in particular that bothers you?”
“Yes.”
,” Harry said. “They can’t change. They have to do things the way Old Blood families do them. They’re unable to act differently. Are they just . . . born that way?”
On the seventh day, Harry was alone once more in the evening, trying to decide whether he could go over there, after what he’d said, whether that would be allowed.  He was still dressed, mostly, but after he’d got home from work he’d taken off his boots and robe and belt and put on the dressing-gown Draco had given him.  It had grown with Harry’s body, just as Draco had said it would.  Then the doorbell rang.
“The Academy?” Nyala shook her head. “I came straight here.”
“Do you want me to tell you how hot you are? How much I want you?”
“It sounds rather like a ghoul.”
“And in-between birthdays,” Harry said.  “I want to remember them as well.”
“Oh, thanks for that! Sure!” One of the tears actually made it out, dropping from a lash.
“Of course not,” Mister Malfoy said, looking amused.  “You’re a perfect angel.”
“Draco.”  Harry didn’t know what else to say, and Draco was standing there, looking as though he was going to cry all over again.  “Can I,” Harry began, reaching out.  “Let me.”  Then Harry’s hand was on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco was letting him come closer, and Harry was hugging him.
“Um,” Harry said.  “Well, I haven’t got it.”
November came with grey, rain, and the Dementor lesson that Harry always taught in Level One ADADA.
Malfoy laughed even harder. “Our society is well rid of him.”
Harry was still confused.  “You thought they would disown you for that?”
“Oh!”  Hermione covered her mouth.
“It’s not what I meant to do.” Tugging Harry’s hand away, Draco put a bit of distance between them, then rolled over, facing Harry finally, putting his hand flat over the scar at the center of Harry’s chest. “I was going to make you feel good,” Draco went on. “I wanted to make you feel so good.”
Harry perked up a bit.  “You can tell?”
“Wizards do,” Draco said, sounding very relieved about it.
“My Patronus turned into a fox.”
“No, she . . .”  Harry looked down at his hands again.  “He did it to save me, so I could defeat Voldemort.”  Draco flinched at the name.  “But he did it because he loved my mum.”
“Why weren’t you always happy?”
“I’ll do it,” Draco breathed. “I think you need it. I think you get too distracted—you want to touch, when I think maybe you should just take a moment to lie back and be touched, let me do things to you. What do you think, Harry? Would you like that?”
Harry stumbled back another step.
“I’m not feeling well,” Harry said finally. “I think I need to go home.”
Draco’s nose pushed under Harry’s ear, Draco’s breath hot on Harry’s throat. “Has no one ever done that to you before?”
,” he repeated, missing again.  “
“I don’t know! You’re Harry Potter. Aren’t you like unto a god in some principalities?”
“Yes.”  Harry wet another flannel, then put it on Draco’s forehead, leaving it there while he pointed his wand at Draco and cleaned him up.  The Cure-All looked like it had helped; the wounds were still the same, but Draco’s colour was better, and he seemed to have a bit of more mobility as Harry cleaned him.  “I want to put this salve on you,” Harry said, when the cleaning was done.  “It has dittany and a localized anaesthetic.”
“Do you want to try something else?” Mister Malfoy asked.
“You know there’s a spell for that.” Malfoy turned back to him, is tone knowing, arrogant.
“I used to pet her all the time,” the man said.
“Play with yourself,” Draco said again. “Touch that big thick cock and come for me. Come for me covered in my come, while my toy fucks your pliant cunt. Do it because I told you to.”
“Except for mine,” Harry said.
The man nodded.
“I went to talk to the potions master at Hogwarts,” Harry said, trying to make his voice sound conciliatory.  “I asked her how long it would take for her to identify a useful ingredient in this potion.”
Malfoy blushed, but he didn’t look away. His eyes held Harry’s, steady and unnervingly silver in the low light.
“I guess not.”  Harry thought about it.  “Was she watching in—in the shower?”
Harry himself wanted to visit Kavika, but Kingsley was partially responsible for Harry’s current anxieties, and Harry wasn’t sure he wouldn’t blame him if he talked to Kavika about what was bothering him. He didn’t want to put her in the position of having to defend her husband.
“I’m what?” Malfoy demanded.  “I can handle it; I was handling it.  I’m not one of your little friends!  Go pick a fight with someone else.”
“Pfft,” Draco said, then added dreamily, “Zabini’s going to get a
Draco took his arm away from his eyes in time to see Harry spit on his own hand then bring it back down. “Oh my fuck,” Draco breathed, when Harry’s hand wrapped around it again. As if unable to help it, he arched into Harry’s hand. “Merlin. Fuck. Fuck.”
Harry’s hand squeezed. He bit Draco’s ear, like Draco had done to him. “Do you want me to get you a cock ring?”
“I’ll gather what we need,” Draco mumbled.
“Calling Muggles ‘Vulnerables’ is a slur,” said Savage.
“Yes,” Harry said.
The day after that, Cornelius Fudge stated that he would stand in the forthcoming election.
“Oh, yes,” Malfoy said.  “Especially in bogies.”
That was about the response that Harry could have expected from Malfoy, but it didn’t change the fact that he was really was sorry.  Harry spread his hands.  “You helped me, and you got sacked for it.  I’m sorry.  You deserved better.”
Malfoyish, demanding attention from the reporters, swaggering, bragging.
“He was,” Harry said.  “He’s nineteen today.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed.
“Get used to it,” Malfoy said. “Potter and I are always a show.”
“Come,” Draco said, heading off toward the stairs.  “We have to wait for your thumb to fade.”
“The way is revolution,” said the bald woman.
“Did he?” Andromeda turned another page.
Ron turned back to him. “You think him coming to the holiday party with Astoria means he’s not in love with you?”
“We’ve heard this argument from Revealers for years,” Carrow said. “Do you have any evidence to substantiate—”
“Oh,” said Malfoy. “Oops.”
Draco shook his head.  “Not anymore.”
“There’s no loop,” said Harry.
Kavika’s brows went up. “I’m the last person who would accuse your of being intimate with Draco,” she said, quite gently.
—” someone began to shout, then broke off.  A woman came in from the hall, lowering a wand.  She had long grey hair and a white nightgown that reached down to the floor.  She almost looked like something from a painting, despite having obviously just jumped out of bed—or maybe because she had just jumped out of bed.  Her hair was a trifle wild, her eyes blazing.  “Draco Malfoy,” she said, sounding dismayed.  “Just what do you think you’re doing?”
“You’re a Concealer, I’ll wager,” Penelope was saying, here, now, in the present. “With your sister on the Council pretending to be ‘neutral.’ I’ll bet she’s the reason Shacklebolt’s lost his coalition.”
How could he?  About a
hasn’t changed. He was always obsessed with me. Always. Why can’t he just . . . ?”
“You’ll remember it all.”
“I don’t know.” Harry looked away. “Maybe that’s not as important as—”
“We don’t sort that way,” said Zidwidley.  “You’ll have to find them yourself.”
A few weeks later, after ADADA, Harry asked Malfoy to stay behind again.
?  But what is the
“I don’t know.” Malfoy tilted his head. “Is reminding me of—all that—is that giving you pleasure?”
Meanwhile, Teddy was shaking his head. “Not that Order of the Phoenix.”
“I think I would—I would rather be alone.”
“It’s all right,” Ron said immediately.
“Foolish people do.”
“Oh.”  Harry felt slightly disappointed about this.  When Draco had said the brown-haired girl was his best friend, he had sort of thought he might grow up and have a girlfriend, but that hardly seemed plausible now that he thought about it.  He didn’t even really want a girlfriend—not right now, anyway.  Just the idea of one sounded nice.  A sudden thought struck him.  “Do I—”  He swallowed hard.  “
“Fuck!” Malfoy said, almost dropping the phials he was holding.
Alby glanced at Draco, who was hovering somewhere behind Harry.
“Wow, yeah, that was good,” said Yin, when Harry had finished. “But trust me, you’ve got nothing on my Nearly Headless Nick dream. Yours is like a picnic in the park in comparison.”
Harry went downstairs.
Harry glanced up, but Draco wasn’t looking at him.  “Probably Adrian Pucey,” Harry said, picking up a piece of tape.
Harry blinked in shock.  “You cheated!”
“A great deal of things.”
,” he said, and Harry’s heart stopped racing, but he felt a tingle on weird spots on his body.
Hermione pressed her lips together in the teasing, clever little smile she gave just to him and Ron. “Don’t want to talk about how Malfoy is in love with you?”
31 years
“Oh, no, it’s so much better being locked in prison with
Silence from behind him, then, “Is that all?”
hurt.”
“And Harry Potter always keeps his promises.” Malfoy had walked to the window again, drawn there as though he strongly identified with the garden’s weeds—which made sense. At the moment, Harry would be happy without either on his property. “Here’s a thought.” Suddenly Malfoy turned on his heel to face him. “Don’t.”
When Draco spoke again, his voice was soft.  “When you spend fifteen years of your life pretending you don’t want something—never even talking about it, never even allowing yourself to look . . . and suddenly everyone telling you that you couldn’t have it is gone, and you can not only look; you can touch—Potter.  Why
“Thank you, Heloise.  Go on.” Mister Malfoy said, shrugging his shoulder.  Heloise hopped off of it and flapped back into the building, practically bowling Harry over in the process.  “We’re going on a little trip,” Mister Malfoy said, turning back to Harry.
shoes.”
Harry could feel that his eyes were large, probably large enough to almost fit his too-big glasses.  He couldn’t stop staring at the owl.  It had magnificent eyebrows.  And it had been inside the building!  And it was sitting on the man’s shoulder, making the man look even more regal than before.  Harry looked back into the doorway from which the owl had flown.  “That was—where did it come from?”
Harry looked at the boots, then looked up at Mister Malfoy.  If Harry was wearing boots he’d be more successful if he tried to escape.  Even though he wasn’t sure he wanted to escape any longer, he supposed he might as well put them on, seeing as how they were now his size.  Also, they were utterly fantastic boots, and Harry had never had shoes that fit before.
“And Auror Potter isn’t?” said the glasses girl. “I heard he cast Crucio. In fact, I heard he cast a curse on Draco Malfoy that—”
older.  Coughing again, he tried to make his voice sound deeper.  “I’m—it’s your nephew.  Harry Potter.”
Mister Malfoy’s laughter faded, and for a second, he almost looked sad.  “Oh, Harry,” he said, and stopped.
“Don’t be Harry Potter. Just this once. Try it on. Just  . . . I’ve got it.” Malfoy snapped his fingers. “You could be a normal bloke! Don’t be a hero. Don’t keep your promises. Just sit back, faff about with a Fire Whiskey, go to bed early, and then maybe—next week, go back to being Harry Potter. Or don’t. Who knows? You could be happy being no one at all.”
31 years
Draco shifted uncomfortably.  “Let’s get to work, shall we?”
As he tried to pull off the confining cloak, Harry quickly took stock of his surroundings.  Books—old and new, leather-bound and gilt-edged—stuffed the bookshelves that lined almost every wall.  A large wingback armchair with a flower pattern on its upholstery sat before the fire, and a soft-looking green rug was laid out on the floor in front of it.  The wood floor shone in the firelight, which gave everything a warm, rosy glow.  In the ceiling were two windows, which showed that it was night.  At the far end of the room, near a wooden table with more books on it, was the door through which the man had gone.  On the side near Harry was another door.  There didn’t seem to be a telephone.

“Yes,” the man said slowly, brow furrowing.  “Like a magic . . . oh.”  Before, the man had seemed stricken, but now he seemed horrified, if his aghast expression was anything to go by.  “Potter, you . . .”
“I’ll work on it,” Harry said.
“Neither is Labour,” Savage had said.
Fuck, Draco was backing him up against Luna’s painting, and a part of Harry felt like he’d not even been kissed at all.  He hadn’t got enough kissing; Draco had been
“I forgot you went to Hogwarts.”
“Thank you,” said Travers, appearing truly touched. “It’s been truly devastating, having your life’s dream ruined for some graffiti.”
Apparition with Ward Bores had to be precise. If the Aurors didn’t Apparate to the exact location of the holes created by the Bores, they could splinch themselves within the Anti-Apparition wards, which would certainly compromise the mission. Therefore, in order to Apparate, the Aurors had to physically see the Ward Bores. That meant that Malfoy had to place the five Bores in such a way that he would be able to look at all five at once. Furthermore, each Ward Bore was a different colour, each colour assigned to a different Auror, so no two Aurors would Apparate to the same spot.
“Not particularly,” Harry said, because Minister Fudge and the lack of the Deal were all anyone was talking about these days. Then he realized he had done it as well; he had brought it up. He was being an arse again, and maybe he was torturing this poor therapist for being young and a little bit in awe of Harry Potter, which wasn’t fair. Finding someone not in awe of Harry Potter was rather difficult, and he tended not to hold it against people—particularly young people. The trainees got over it soon enough; so would Duggings. “It’s my godson,” Harry finally supplied.
“Oh God.”  Taking off his glasses, Harry rubbed his eyes.  Then his face.  His whole jaw itched, with the beard.  He should shave it off.  Fuck.  He did not want to go down this road.  He did not want to argue with Draco about every single thing that had happened at Hogwarts.  It would make them hate each other again.  It would destroy the distance they had come; it wasn’t fair.  Christ.  It wasn’t fair.
Harry concentrated on his hands instead—getting to touch Draco’s strong, lean back, his narrow waist, lean hips, his arse—
Teddy didn’t say anything, and Harry bit the inside of his cheek. Adebayo, Fairchild, and Mark were arguing about whether the people dropping the wards were really terrorists. One of the older Aurors and Adebayo’s girlfriend had gone up to the bar; the second Auror, Malfoy, and Rune were all talking about Fudge’s new efforts to completely obliterate any sort of Deal. Drawing his wand, Harry turned to fill up his glass of water, only to find his glass completely full, the water ice cold. Jerking his head up, Harry looked at Malfoy, who wasn’t paying any attention, all of his intense gazes and soft expressions just for Rune.
“You always want to help me,” Draco said.  “This time I’m asking.”
“Yes,” Harry said, realizing he must look like an idiot.  His muscles were stiff as he forced his arms down, but inside he felt shaky.
Animal sacrifice, on the other hand . . .
In the sitting room, only one chair sat by the fire—the floral, wingback one, but Mister Malfoy pointed his wand at it and it stretched, becoming wide enough for them both to sit.  Harry waited until Mister Malfoy sat down, then tentatively sat on the edge, still confused.  Aunt Petunia used to tell Dudley he would “ruin his dinner,” when he ate too many sweets, but Harry had never understood it.  Now he understood, not only having ruined his dinner but having ruined afters as well and having got sick on top of that, which was always a bad thing to do.  He didn’t understand why Mister Malfoy wasn’t angry with him.
“I’ve helped crack the case of the century, Abel Alby will get what’s coming to him, I’ve broken up with my boyfriend, I’ve got a million potions to brew and only this shop to do it in, and your Patronus keeps following me about mournfully like I’m a carcass she’d really like to gnaw on but doesn’t get to.  How do you think I’m doing?”
“Oh.” Harry thought about this, because of course, she was right. “He has. To an extent.”
“No.”
“Potions?”  Mrs. Mulpepper looked up at him, sniffling.  “ID?”  Her eyes widened.  “Oh, but Auror Potter, sir!
“I think he’ll feel pressured by this conversation,” said Hermione. “I think he’ll realize it’s wrong to leave his friends out of the loop.”
But it could be.
“Jesus,” Harry said, because it was just so hot. “Draco.” Then he opened his mouth, and took Draco down again.
“I don’t think it would be very edible,” said Teddy, “but sure.”
“Was that that famous Thai wizard?” Ron asked, after both Malfoy and Rune had swept off onto the dance floor. Ron had apparently finished romancing Greengrass, and had joined him by the canapés, holding five of them on the palm of his large hand and eating one after another. “Photsi? Someone?”
!”  The wand remained dark.
“Potions master!”  Malfoy’s nose snapped down.  “Like Severus?”
one, if they were talking fit. “Malfoy looks the same to me,” Harry said, spelling a little canapé off a nearby tray.
, Andromeda had said.  Draco was eleven, but maybe you could do it then as well.  Harry, having not had much experience with being a normal teenager, had had to take Andromeda at her word.
“And?”
Still thinking it sounded sad, Harry played another card.  It was a snap again, so he played another, which was also a snap, and then another.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco breathed.
, Malfoy had said. Arguably, Malfoy had been nicest of all to the Timothy Tree; that first year, when he had had no friends at the Academy, he had been with it all the time. Later, when he had friends at Academy and nowhere else, he had brought his friends to visit it.
“Of course not,” Malfoy said easily. “Throw it in my face any time you want. Rub it in. Want me to lie down? You can step on me too.”
“But what did you—”
When Harry moved, he could not tell whether they saw him. When he reached the door, he could not tell whether they tried to stop him. He did not feel as though he was there at all, winding down the stone steps, striding down the stone corridor, pushing on the wooden door, into the cool winter air, across the stone walkway of the cloisters, onto the dead grass.
“What if I want to dance with you?” Harry heard himself say.
“A Mudblood.”
The Dark Mark couldn’t be a Horcrux, however. For Voldemort to split his soul into that many pieces would have been impossible; he would have become too unstable. The binding spells wouldn’t be able to hold on to such small slivers. Harry thought of what he would do, if he was Voldemort.
“He actually told Hilda that he wants Ted’s Order of the Phoenix to bring down the entire Department.”
Harry stared at him.
“Er.  I’ll try not to.”
“So what? You’re just going to give up?”
“Could hold a grudge.  Who knows.”  Savage shrugged.  “Better check, just to be safe.”
“You’re a bit pathetic,” Draco said, pushing off the door frame.  “You know that?”  Turning, he walked back into the sitting-room.  Harry had been so distracted by the hair that he hadn’t noticed that Draco was wearing that stupid white pyjama top and Muggle jeans.  How did adult-Draco even have Muggle jeans?  Did twenty-year-old-Draco go out and
“Well.” Harry looked away. “When you put it like that.”
Academy,” said Savage, “which is why the idea of having a former
Harry picked up the strawberry he’d dropped and pointed his wand to the mess on the table.  “I can help with washing up.
Ron put his hand on Hermione’s shoulder. “It’s not giving up if you really want to quit. You don’t have to stay at the Academy if you’re not happy, Harry.”
“It would never bother me,” Ron said. “Who you wanted. After I was a prat about Gin. It bothered me that George would joke about it—as though people get to decide who they want.”
“Mm-hm.” Harry moaned messily around the cock, sucking noisily now.
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy said, sounding amused.  He was standing by a stool that was next to a table, so Harry went to sit on the stool.
“But . . .” Malfoy bit his lip.
“Is moving nicely genetic?” Teddy wanted to know, then turned to Nyala. “We were discussing Black family genes.”
The next morning, when Harry Apparated to the Academy just outside the Pallas Arch, a crowd was waiting—reporters with their magic microphones and Quick-Quotes quills at the ready. The echoing crack of his Apparition was immediately drowned by the cacophony of questions.
It felt like a punch to the gut.
“No,” Harry said. “You’re really not.”
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, then abruptly moved down the wall. “Right, I forget, I’m not a criminal mastermind, like some of us.” Malfoy’s things had been dropped in a pile on the floor, Harry saw now—his cloak and knapsack, and now Malfoy went about hanging them up. He must have dropped them as soon as he saw the writing, Harry realized.
“I—I get to have some?”
Harry waved his wand.
Harry opened the door and stepped out of Slug and Jiggers, slamming the door behind him.
Self-conscious, Harry put his hand to his shorn head.  He probably shouldn’t have done it like that.  He’d just wanted Malfoy to get what he needed.
is all he wanted to say, but of course that was a non sequitur. They were not talking about whether Milligan was the ideal therapist. Were they? “I don’t know,” Harry said at last. “I’m not—it doesn’t worry me. In particular.”
“That wasn’t the only reason,” Draco said quickly.  “He just—Father very much wanted me to—to grow up and have a wife.  In particular, I think he wanted—he wanted me to give him grandchildren and carry on the Malfoy name.”
Here, now, Leck Hall, Baggot was speaking. “Of course we’ll conduct an investigation. Obviously, it’s a bad thing. Sometimes bad things can’t be stopped. Sometimes, you have to work with what’s there.”
Harry was thirty-one.
“I said friend.”  Harry’s voice felt choked.  “Not—not boyfriend.”
“You don’t need them.” Malfoy’s hips were rolling, now, rutting against him in their clothes.
Malfoy hadn’t taken it seriously. He’d laughed at Cedric Diggory’s death. “I do these exercises,” Harry said.
“I said you might have been cross-referencing something,” Draco said.  “Some files that weren’t there.  It occurs to me—it
Harry recoiled, and Malfoy jerked back, as though he had felt hot coals, when all he had touched was air. “I don’t know you,” Harry said. “Malfoy, you’re just . . . in school you were this horrible person, but now—now, you’re a stranger. You’re a stranger to me, Malfoy. I don’t owe you anything.”
“It’s fine,” Harry said.  “Sorry I broke the jar.”
The black squeezed them into Andromeda’s house.  “There you are,” said Andromeda, coming from the hall into the sitting room.
“No,” Draco said, still holding Harry’s hair. “You’re pleasuring the toy, Harry. Make sure you’re a good little slut for it; give it what it needs. Any prick I give you, I want you to show it what a good slut you are.”
“He was,” Harry insisted.  “I mean, he wasn’t.  But he was—he wasn’t what you’d expect.”
“You have to be
“A JCB?”
Then Draco put his nose in the air and looked like
Harry hadn’t really noticed Draco’s voice changing.  Harry hadn’t pinpointed the age, but it had definitely changed.  It now had that timbre that made Harry feel as though something had been strummed inside him every time that Draco spoke.  “Then I started to think you did it because you wanted to help.  Because you’re a good person.”
Malfoy had been so bland, in fact, that Harry hadn’t really thought to dread him tonight, but now that Harry was here and turning back to watch Malfoy with the Greengrass girl, Harry realized that if Malfoy
“To Astoria.” Achar also raised her glass. “I think we can all agree she’s probably a terrorist.”
“No, he didn’t.”
“If it makes you uncomfortable, you’re free to tell him that,” Kavika said. “You don’t have to accept someone’s actions just because their intentions are good, Harry. Not everyone deserves the benefit of your doubt.”
“And how are you feeling about that these days?”
Panic bubbled up through the crowd, the question repeated and turned over, passed on to other non-magical people who began to join in, making the crowd larger and larger, and Harry began to see what Ron meant, about casting spells at non-magical people. He could silence them with a word, calm them with a wave of his wand. But would it be fair? Would it be just? Would it be right?
“See here,” the man said.  “You’re a wizard, aren’t you?  I can tell by those . . . clothes.”  He waved a hand.  “Is Harry all right?  Are things—happening again?”
“He—he did?” Draco took a quick sip of his tea.
“Now you’re getting it.”
a Revealer.”
Maybe he didn’t like Harry sleeping in his bed after all.
“And Lionel Greengrass had never said a word to you until tonight,” Nyala put in.
“Um.”  Malfoy was looking at Harry as though he’d grown a second head.  “I’ve already tested it,” he said at last.  “It’s perfect.”
“There’s more to a relationship than wanting.”
“You’re not . . .”  Harry worried his scone, crumbs dropping onto his plate.
in the Burrow on New Year’s Eve, which informed them all that Malfoy and Rune were
“Armen.  If you must know.”
“I can’t.”
Then at last, Harry’s trousers were down far enough. Draco rocked back on his heels, as though to assess a prize he had won, and hooked his fingers on the waistband of Harry’s pants. His eyes were huge, hopeful, flicking up to Harry and then back to the waiting cock, already wet at the tip and aching. At last, he popped Harry’s pants down, revealing Harry’s bare cock.
“It’s what you think about the dream that matters.”
“But they wouldn’t put Father in
“I don’t think that. You know I don’t.”
“Oh, I know,” said Penelope. “Can you believe Baggot? Spragg, you expect it, but you’d think a bloke Baggot’s age would know better.”
“To your house,” Draco said.
, when he’d explained how he’d let Harry sleep in his bed.
Draco must not have been as absorbed as Harry had supposed, because after a moment he closed his book and came over to the sofa.  “That book said it’d take a full twelve hours for that cure to mature,” Draco said, nodding at the ledger as he sat down on the sofa.  “I suppose that means we have to stay here.  You never said where here was.  It doesn’t belong to Severus, does it.”
Harry stood up. “You need to deal with it yourself, Malfoy. It’s your own problem.”
“Some. They’re—it’s better. But I still have nightmares, sometimes. I had them less. When I was—when I had a regular therapist.”
“Come on, Malfoy,” Harry said. “You knit?”
“No.” Snatching it away, Draco went on, “it’s going to fuck you. Meanwhile, you’ll go on sucking my cock. I want my come all over you, Harry. I want it all over your face.”
“What else would you be here for?”
had a blurb about Draco Malfoy publishing in
“Want my job?” Harry asked, once Malfoy was done with his demonstration.
What was different now was that Harry had once been hurt, but he had healed. Time had healed him. Ron and Hermione had healed him. Kavika and therapy had healed him. The Academy had healed him, and so had Draco Malfoy, in Malfoy’s own small way.
“You shouldn’t have to close your shop,” Harry said in a rush.
Harry practiced more of his magic.  They were in the sitting room, but since Harry had to move around to practice on different things, Draco hadn’t made the floral wingback chair into a sofa.  Eventually Harry got bored of practicing, even though it was fun.  He wanted to sit by Draco but didn’t want to bother him.  Those times Harry had fallen asleep, Draco had used his wand to carry Harry off to bed, but before that he must have fallen asleep beside Draco—against Draco, Harry realized, remembering the feel of Draco’s warm shoulder against his cheek.
Doctor Yin just shrugged. “Define ‘better’. Give more to charity? Say hi to strangers? Maybe being better is being kind to ourselves, feeling comfortable, allowing ourselves time and space to know who we really are.”
“You know what’s not alleged?” said Savage. “Draco Malfoy put up He Who Must Not Be Named in
As the driver backed away in horror from the dancing taxi, Harry ran toward the nearest building, looking for anywhere the number for the address might be posted.  The fawn, however, seemed to have disappeared.
It felt so warm and good that Harry wanted to get even closer, which was stupid.  It was so stupid, because Petunia was always cuddling Dudley, but that was because Dudley was a big baby.  Harry didn’t want to be a baby, so he stayed where he was.
“Do you want that, Harry? Do you want a nice, thick prick to suck on, fill that greedy mouth?” When Harry moaned again, Draco thrust particularly hard. “Use your words, darling.”
“Who made you the authority on relaxation?”
“You’re definitely in Slytherin,” Harry said, making his voice reassuring, now.  “The Hat said it almost before it went on your head.”
“I don’t think that would be a good idea.”
As such, Harry was reluctant to leave Draco with Andromeda, but the only alternatives Harry could see were to leave Draco alone or bring Draco with him to the warehouse.  Despite the Seeing-Eye Ball and various protections Harry could set up, bringing him would be potentially dangerous.  Then again, Dumbledore had sent Harry into dangerous situations all the time.  When Harry thought about what could happen to child-Draco, he wondered how Dumbledore could have done it.  Dumbledore must have had his reasons, and yet Harry felt certain adult-Draco would never do that.  Andromeda might have.  Hermione wouldn’t.  Draco had lost his mind over Harry riding a taxi, and Harry was beginning to suspect that Dumbledore wasn’t the best example for how a grown-up should act.
A gleam of triumph sparked in Malfoy’s eye. “I’m terribly witty, you see,” he went on. “Everyone wants to be my friend.”
All of his muscles were tensed in anticipatory dread, his bed drenched in sweat. He couldn’t seem to catch his breath. Gasping, he tried to throw the covers back, fighting with them, forgetting before he found his wand and Banished them. “Lumos,” he demanded, clapping his hand over his glasses, shoving them onto his face. “Accio glass. Aguamenti,” he added, once the glass was almost in his hand, and he could aim the water into it. He brought the glass up to his lips while his wand was still spurting. He should have cast Malfoy’s ice water spell.
Oh God, Harry thought, but his tongue was already darting out to gently swirl around the head. Oh God. His eyes rolling back in his skull, Harry closed them, working his tongue over the green dildo, then at last letting himself take the head of it in his mouth to suck.
“That’s where you’re wrong, Instructor Potter,” Malfoy said. “I
“I want,” Harry began, then started again. “I want it to be okay. That it’s comfortable. That I don’t need—more, that he doesn’t need more, that it’s not . . .” Harry ground his teeth. “It’s not painful. I’ve been in other relationships—they were painful. I fell in love before I knew what I was doing, before we really knew each other, or we grew up and . . . I just want it to be okay. That we’re like this.”
11 years
Using the stick—his wand, Harry guessed—Mister Malfoy opened cabinets, pointed at things in them, and made them float around the kitchen.  He got sugar, cocoa, and water into a pot and then the pot on the cooker, then started the cooker, only murmuring words now and then to make things go where he wanted.  Then he got milk out of a cabinet and a little bottle of something that looked like vanilla.
“Reveal will happen soon, and everything will change anyway.” Bickford’s voice was plaintive. “Can we not have just one thing remain the same?”
“Voldemort returned,” Harry said.  “Your father sided with him.”
“You think I thought you did this?” Harry asked.
“Do you have to know what ingredients were in the potion that fell on me?” Harry asked, after Draco had dried his thumb again.
The silence stretched out, and Harry noticed for himself what Draco had said about this part of Wiltshire—the way insects weren’t crawling in the grass.  Birds weren’t flying in the sky.  Nothing moved, except for the occasional lazy sway of grass in the wind, and Draco’s chest moving as he breathed.
he wants to help people—”
“If it is,” Harry said, “I don’t think Malfoy got it. He was terrible in hand-to-hand the first year he took it.”
Harry felt a swell in his chest, realizing with a start of surprise that the feeling was pride.  “How did you do that?”
“I know.  I’m sorry.  I’ll touch you now.”  Harry rubbed his back some more.
From the doorway, Malfoy snorted.
Malfoy had written.
Harry couldn’t hear anything from within the flat. The whole building was under a Silence Charm, wedged as it was on a non-magical street. The faint scent of cinnamon hadn’t been charmed away, wafting out to the street from somewhere within Malfoy’ flat.
Pink immediately bloomed in Malfoy’s cheeks, spreading like a stain down to his throat. He didn’t have good skin—sort of splotchy and spotted—and the bloom of colour only emphasized how pale he was. Malfoy tossed his head. “It already comes naturally.”
“Not silver, like yours?”
“Don’t touch me,” Malfoy said, whirling to jerk his arm out of Harry’s grasp.
“Put your hand on the badge, Malfoy.”
“Fuck.” Harry thrust back again. “Fuck me again. Put it in me again.”
“Yeah,” Harry panted, moving his head up and down so that Draco’s cock could slide up along his cheek. “Give it to me.”
“How did this become about Reveal?” Bickford sounded honestly confused.
“Anthony Goldstein.”  Harry picked up another piece of tape.
“Don’t tell Draco I told you.”  Andromeda smirked.  “Anyway, it had to come out somewhere, all of that emotion.  Where do you think she put it?  Certainly not her husband; she had to be perfect for him as well.  Twenty-three years of love, passion, affection, loneliness and heartache.  She put it all in him.”
“You knew them?”
“Because you didn’t sleep.” Harry heard his own voice rise and wasn’t even sure why.  “You stayed up all night working on some dumb potion to try and fix me!”
anything.
Smelling it so close, Harry eyed it hungrily, even while he was sucking on the dildo. Harry began to ease off of the dildo so he could switch to the real thing.
looking at it?”
The next morning, Harry didn’t find coffee waiting on his desk. Instead, he found a wooden box, finely carved, but simple, beautiful. In it were at least ten different phials in various shades of aqua and green, two packets of light blue powder, a box of tea bags, and a sachet with some herb Harry had never smelled before. Atop all these was folded parchment, which—when Harry unfolded it—turned out to be at least five pages of small, neat script.
.  You want to make people hate you.”
“He’s all right,” said Moskowitz.
Trying to figure it out hurt like a physical ache.  Harry wasn’t used to dealing with this kind of emotional turmoil; usually he could shut out people and things who made him feel this way—but not Malfoy.  Some nights, Harry still dreamed of the way Malfoy had kissed him.
, went Harry’s unhelpful brain.
Harry waited, hand holding Draco’s cock while Draco took long, steady breaths. Close up against him like this, Harry could smell him—some product Draco used in his hair that smelled clean, a trace of lemon, layered under the heavier scent of sweat and the mounting smell of sex. Harry could hear Draco’s heartbeat, and Harry thought he’d never done anything so intimate, holding Draco’s dick for him while Draco calmed himself so he wouldn’t come too fast.
“Do you want to suck it?”
“I found the person that worked for me,” Harry said. “I don’t fancy trying it all again.”
The Minister for Magic slowly turned to look at Greengrass, Kingsley’s default grace and sombre expression making Greengrass’s pretentions toward rationality look a little ridiculous. “I take it I don’t have your vote,” said Kingsley.
He waited.
“I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
“I think so.”  Harry frowned, thinking about his body.  He seemed to be all there.  “Does incorporeal just mean you can put your hand through it, or does it mean you can’t feel it at all?”  He was wondering whether air counted as incorporeal.
“Draco wants to make up for his past,” Andromeda said softly.
Ron’s little smile fell away.
Harry thought about this, then remembered what Draco had said about hexing Aunt Petunia.  “Would you hex Dudley?” Harry asked.
“I mean I was never allowed to,” Harry said.  “Am I allowed to have the bacon?”
“Have your lunch,” Harry said, then went down the stairs.
“Immensely,” Harry said, wishing he could think of things that would make Draco feel less restless and morose.  When Harry had been ten, Draco had thought of all sorts of things to keep him entertained—making the floor grow fur, flying the couch around.  Somehow Harry thought Draco wouldn’t appreciate those things.  He’d think that Harry was patronizing him.
“It’s when friends come over,” Harry said.  “And they stay the night.  Dudley had one once; it was awful.”
“Is that what Lupin’s Order of the Phoenix is doing? Remaking the Ministry?”
“Why?  You keep staring at me as though I ‘almost killed your best friend and got your two favourite professors killed, and kept calling your friend a Mudblood and had her tortured at my house’, so why do I need to look at you?  I know what you think.”  Draco glanced up at him from under his lashes—just like he used to do when he was eleven when he’d pretend he wasn’t looking, only this was different.  “Despite what you’ve told me.”
“Paint,” Harry said.  “I was over at your house last night.  Hermione said you had some.”
“Draco,” Harry said.
“That’s not how,” Harry said.
“Bernard, you nit,” Greengrass drawled. “
That morning he spent the morning time skimming through his notes about the Dark Mark. One of the only things he missed about being an Auror were the puzzles, for while Hermione had been better at solving them, Harry had exceled at pursuing them. He had difficulty letting go; it had led him down many dark paths as both a student of Hogwarts and an Auror in the Ministry, but that had not changed his essential nature. When presented with something that seemed wrong, Harry found that very few things could distract him until he set it right.
“He deserved it.”
Once they both got back into the sky, however, Draco didn’t seem to want to win very much.  Whenever he got in grabbing range of the Snitch he would shout out to Harry a spell he could use to stop him, or if Harry tried a spell and it didn’t work, Draco would stop to remind him how to do it.
March slid into April, the daffodils still blooming but bringing with them other flowers as well. Harry didn’t know which ones. He didn’t know his flowers very well; he just knew daffodils were generally yellow and now there were more colours and flowers in the trees, so that probably meant something. The days were longer and warmer, the May date of Reveal ever closer. Several stays had been issued over the past four years, but the Council was running out of options to get a Deal before May. The Fudge Ministry was no help on that score, sabotaging every attempt at negotiations with the non-magical world, as if to guarantee that if Reveal had to happen, it would happen in the worst way possible.
“She likes you,” Draco said softly, and Harry’s chest went tight.  Pointing his wand about the room, Draco extinguished the candles one by one.  At last the room was lit only by the fire in front of them and the soft glow of the Patronus, and then Draco pointed his wand at the ceiling.  “
Harry managed about two bites, then dropped his fork onto his plate.  It landed with a clatter.
Eye wide, Draco swallowed. “Give me another minute.”
“Then maybe you should—not,” Harry finally managed to say.
“You’ll see.  I’ll still like you.”
“No,” Harry said.  “That got him out.  You got to have Lucius seventh year and a bit after.  But there were trails eventually, and he got sentenced.”
Harry didn’t know what that was, the quality in some people that could make some people comfortable, then completely turn off others, the way it was different for different people, the way it could change and grow different for the same people. “Maybe I
“Yes,” Harry said, walking along-side Ron, who gave him a sidelong glance.
With a dramatic flourish, Malfoy produced a small scroll from a pocket in his robe.  The robe itself was a drab little thing, threadbare and grey, just like the shabby clothes Malfoy wore underneath it.
“I know what you meant.” Malfoy said it like a quip, but then didn’t follow up with anything else until they got to Crowley Stott, the Academy library.
“Astoria, Regina, and I.”
“Draco,” Harry said again.  He tried to peel Draco off of him, but again Draco must have misinterpreted the movement, because he pressed his face harder against Harry’s chest.  Remembering how Draco had held him after he thought Harry had been in danger, Harry put his arms around Draco.  It hadn’t really occurred to him at the time that Draco had done that because he had been terrified, and touching Harry had made him feel better.  “Muggles aren’t going to drop bombs on you,” Harry said.
The face—Harry’s grown-up face—went cold, the expression flat, nothing like Draco would ever do.  “Right,” Draco said, but he just sounded tired.
Harry was quite pleased to get back to Draco’s laboratory.  Over the last week it had begun to feel almost like a home to him, even though he knew he was not allowed to stay.  Draco said that it would take a while for him to finish everything, so Harry went to the bedroom to see if the bunk beds were still there.  Even though he now knew the stretching wasn’t good for the wood, he liked how Draco had made them for him.  The bedroom also had the dressing gown Draco had got for Harry.  Draco had said it would grow when Harry did, which Harry guessed would be happening soon.  Harry sort of wanted to wear the dressing gown when he got the cure, just so he would remind his older self how nice Draco had been, but that was probably weird, so Harry hung it back up after petting it for a moment.
“Some things are serious. I got one.” Ron had struggled with the gnome’s head, and Harry had gone over to help.
“It’s a mobile.”
Harry watched for the silver fox, but it never came.  Instead there was a silver deer—not even a grown-up one.  It had a little tail and spots on its back, just the like that deer in that cartoon movie.  It rushed at the black shadow, making it burst to pieces like shreds of fabric.
“I was just at the zoo, actually,” Harry said, shoving up his glasses.  “Before I was kidnapped.”
For lunch Harry asked for the mini-beef wellingtons again.  Draco made one but had chicken salad for himself.  As they ate, Draco saw Harry looking at it, and let Harry try it.  It was very good—much better than any salad Aunt Petunia had ever made.  When Draco saw that Harry keep looking at it, he made another one just for Harry, and didn’t make him finish the beef.  Harry sort of wanted to finish them both, but he remembered that time he got sick and decided to save the rest for later.
Harry nearly squeaked, the slap was so hard and unexpected. “Yes, I need—I need cock.”
“You won’t,” Draco said.  “You know what he did to me.”
Harry shouldn’t ask.  He knew he shouldn’t ask, because he didn’t need to know; he was getting to see a version of Malfoy with all of his defences down and personal questions were not fair.  Harry couldn’t help himself.  “If they’re your best friends, why don’t you spend time with them when you’re grown up?”
“It’s not funny,” Savage said, her face cold with fury.
could take the non-magicals to different people . . . but even if we
Once Sibanyoni had given him the address, Harry went home and wrote an owl to Marie Leblanc directly. Only after that did he discover his mistake, for now he had nothing to do: no tasks. No company. Nothing immediately pressing. No one who needed him. Nothing but an unsatisfactory session of therapy to reflect upon, and maybe he did feel more than relief that he and Vinicius had broken up. Perhaps he felt regret. Was this regret?
“Bonbons are a luxury item.”
“Captain Robards!”
Draco didn’t know about Janus Thickey, then.  Harry didn’t think Narcissa had been released before she died, which meant Draco had never kept her anywhere.  Harry remembered how much he’d let Draco assume when he’d been eleven, the problems it had caused, and yet Harry couldn’t seem to find it in himself to tell Draco the truth just now.  Anyway, Draco was still talking.
“Like, with customers?”
“Not yet.”
Harry went.
Moving toward the Timothy Tree, Harry took advantage of the fact that this also put space between him and Malfoy. “No harm in trying it, then,” Harry said, gesturing toward the Timothy Tree. “Do you want to say goodbye?”
sorry; would you like me to get on my knees?”
“But you said I’m thirty-one.”
“I haven’t answered your other question,” Harry said, turning to Carrow. “The reason I tried to kill myself. When you die once, you become obsessed with it. You wonder if you could survive it again. After all, you did the first time. What’s a little AK to the hero of the Wizarding World; am I right?”
“Oh, I’m good, thanks.” Malfoy always had this light, quick tone that made him sound as though he thought everything was a great big joke.
them! Which is not what Reveal is going to do!”
“Have some Magbrick,” Kavika said, holding out a handful.
“Uh-huh,” said Ron.
Harry nodded to show he knew what the word “novice” meant, even though he didn’t.  He hoped it meant someone who loved children.
“It won’t go straight,” Harry mumbled.
“What—?” said Mister Malfoy, letting go of Harry’s arm.
Harry took it, and they followed Andromeda through the sitting room and down a hall.  “Where is Draco going to sleep?” Harry asked as they walked through the wood-panelled corridor.  The house was nice but seemed sort of old.  “Are there bunk beds?”
Duggins made a sound like a swallowed cough, then straightened his shoulders. “Yes, I can understand feeling some . . . satisfaction with the outcome of the appointment—”
“Stop looking at me like that,” Draco said, sounding peevish.
It had kept happening: seeing Malfoy, remembering the dream. Then remembering that moment with Malfoy above him, besting him, smiling down at him. Then remembering the way dream-Malfoy had ground his hips against him, the way dream-Malfoy had held him pinned, then leaned down to trail his breath against . . . but that hadn’t happened in the dream, had it? Was Harry remembering the dream, or was he inventing more of it?
quill, ink, and parchment.”
“I know the words.  It’s just the—never mind,” Harry said, because he didn’t want to bother explaining.  He’d never been able to explain it well anyway; only Hermione had seemed to get what he was talking about, and that was fifth year.  She’d taught him the reading spell then, which had helped a lot.
“He does get one.”
Now Draco was talking about it, and Harry wondered whether having lost the war, lost his parents, and lost everything else, Draco felt he was finally allowed to be himself.  More had to be repressed in Draco than simply liking blokes, and Harry felt like maybe this had been the key all along; all of this had had to happen for Draco to finally grow up to be the person Harry had grown to love.  Holding onto Draco tighter, Harry touched Draco’s hair, those short hairs in back, and willed for him to be okay.
Hermione covered Harry’s hand with her own. “I’m sorry.”
“Because you’ve told me holidays are happy,” Harry said.  “I like hearing about you being happy.”
“Are you on the run?”  Harry persisted.  “Are you being hunted?”
“Yes.”  Draco’s arm curled around him, holding him warm and close.  “I’ll do it just like Father did.”
“Neutral?” Harry’s voice was sceptical. “Really?”
However, the fact that potions were being used as cover-up made it that much more difficult to get to the bottom of what was going on.  Even though Harry suspected Vance, Robards, and Savage, he couldn’t hold them all at once to question them; if Harry got to one of them, that one might warn the others.  Obliviating them might not even work if a potion had been developed that could resist Obliviation, and for once Harry couldn’t rely on other Aurors or anyone in the Ministry to help.  If there was a supplier behind it all, Harry had to find out who it was before trying to tell anyone else, or else Harry risked them getting away.
“Where?” Harry asked suspiciously.  Draco might be taking him to see Dudley again.  Or worse, maybe he had found Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.  For the first time, it occurred to Harry that they would be really old by now.  Or maybe dead.
Harry thought about Hermione at eleven, always quoting
Harry trailed uselessly behind him.  “Then . . . did something bad happen?  With fish and chips?”
Regina was Fairchild, but—“Astoria?”
“Oh, who?” Harry said, pretending he didn’t know. Ron got this bit of a dopey smile a lot of the time when Hermione was doing something he thought impressive—leading a committee hearing. Proposing legislation. Washing Hugo’s face. Eating beans on toast.
Then Draco slid it out, wet and good, sucking again once the cock was out of his throat and he could work the muscles there. He did it beautifully, like a fucking pro, and Harry felt his hips thrust, inadvertently. Draco popped off the cock.
Christ.
“There’s my good slut.” Draco’s hand wrapped in Harry’s hair, pushing down. The dildo was also moving down, and Harry chased it with his mouth until the dildo was on Draco’s upper thigh, almost directly parallel to Draco’s own dick. Harry had lost track of it during his orgasm, but Draco’s cock was fully hard again.
Draco took his arm off his eyes, but he turned to look at the cushions on the sofa, instead of at Harry.  “I work in a Muggle restaurant,” he said suddenly.  “All I’ve had is grease to eat for the past two years.”
“Fuck.” Harry jerked under him, because the thought of Draco playing with him was feeding directly into his thought that Draco could do whatever he pleased. “Yes,” Harry said. “Yes, you can—play with me. Play with me—all you—fucking—want.”
Before Harry could formulate a reply, Malfoy left the room, leaving Harry alone with his cool window and his thoughts.
“Malfoy hates me.”
“Er. I think that covers it.” Harry reached to touch his scar, instead finding the crystals in his lap. For some reason, he felt inspired to say, “I don’t always sleep so well.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked.
“Why shouldn’t you be?”
“He didn’t really hurt me,” Harry said, still a little surprised. “He wasn’t significant enough to hurt me.”
“No,” Harry said stubbornly.  “I’m still . . .”  Picking up his fork, he loaded it up and tried to eat the bite.  He honestly tried, but when it got to his lips, he just couldn’t do it.
Harry hurried toward the door, trying to hold his trousers on, glasses beginning to slip down his nose.
Smile fading, Draco went over to look at the book.  He flipped through it a bit, probably checking how much Harry hadn’t read.  “You didn’t find the other spells interesting?” Draco said, turning back to Harry.
“No,” Andromeda said.
“Are we really having this conversation again?” Now Povey, moaning a little.
At one point, Draco showed him how to do a spiral dive, which he said Harry had already mastered by first year.  They did it again and again together, and Harry loved it—the sensation of the wind whistling through his hair, the ground rushing up toward him, even the dizziness of the spin.  At last Draco said Harry should try it on his own, and that was when he fell.
Yin’s brows went up. “I don’t think anyone is good-looking.”
This seemed to snap Draco out of it, causing him to look down at Harry.  Petunia said that Dudley could be an astronaut, but Harry didn’t think Dudley could.  “No,” Draco said, smiling faintly.  “Not an astronaut.”
Mrs. Mulpepper’s eyes widened.  “Really?”
“Good boy. All right. Open your mouth, Harry, and suck my cock.” Then the hand was moving from Harry’s cheek to his hair, forcing Harry’s head back down, and Harry went willingly, opening his mouth and taking it. “Perfect slut,” Draco praised, changing his grip so that he could stroke Harry’s scalp. “Now we go again. Tap if you don’t like it, Harry.”
“What other matters?” Harry asked, before he could think.  When Draco just looked at him, Harry realized that whatever a proprietor was, it was Draco, and Draco hadn’t opened his shop because he’d been trying to fix Harry.  Maybe ‘tailored tinctures’ had been the name of it.  “But it doesn’t look like a shop,” Harry said.
“Does this mean . . . ?” Malfoy cut himself off.
Harry realized Draco must be a very powerful wizard.  Other people probably couldn’t even do  it.
“Well, I should be going, then,” Mister Malfoy said, gesturing at Harry behind his back.  “Thank you for your time, Mister Dursley.”
“Of course you—”  Cutting himself off, Draco looked down at him.  “Yes, Harry,” he said seriously.  “You had friends.  Those were your two best ones.”
“Was I drunk?”
him,” Harry said.  “He said—I wouldn’t . . . I’m not . . .”
Eventually Harry felt as if he was the correct temperature again. He could put his coat on. No one else came in to use the toilet.
“Vance shouldn’t even be looking at your cases,” Ron groused.
“Like on telly.”
“Don’t go to Robards,” Harry said, his hand on the knob of the door.  “If you do, I’ll know.”
Casting a quick healing spell on the scab, Harry got it closed up, then opened one of the jars he’d grabbed.  “This is a salve; let me put it on you; let me—”
“If you played with an advantage,” Draco went on, “we could be more even.  Let’s try it this way.  You can cast offensive spells on me, but I can’t on you.  I know plenty of good ones; I’ll teach them to you.”
“I’m a little relieved, I guess.” Sibanyoni’s had at least several cushions, all of which seemed quite well loved, and in these Harry found at least several threads to pick at, occupying his hands. “I think it felt like . . . work, to keep up with him. But I liked him. He was good. I don’t know.”
“No,” said Teddy.
February rolled into March, and they were experiencing a week that nearly felt like spring when Teddy stayed behind after Sorcery (Ritual, Soul, and Spiritual Magic) to ask about dark sigils. Harry didn’t have to think long to figure it out. “Malfoy didn’t tell you?” Harry asked. “I already told him I’d help him.”
“You can try to straighten it out if you want,” Harry said, after a long moment in which Draco’s hand didn’t return to his hair.  “I don’t mind it.”
Cambridge was living that one week in March that already felt like May, before the dreary rain and cold returned to remind them of April still to come. The sun had just risen in a gentle arrangement of pink and gold, and blue was slowly populating the sky when Harry Apparated to the Academy to find a dozen reporters outside the Pallas Arch. Unauthorized personnel were not allowed within the wards of the Academy grounds, but since Apparition was also disallowed, the reporters knew Harry would have to appear outside before going in.
Narcissa had died in March.  Narcissa’s death would have happened two-and-a-half months ago for Draco, unless the “traumatic event” had caused the cure to go wonky again and pulled Draco from unconsciousness.  Harry wished he could have been there when Draco had awakened; Draco wouldn’t have had to write a note and send Heloise.  He understood why Draco didn’t want him there, but still.
Harry tried to hide a smile.  “Very.”
Harry thought suddenly, overwhelmingly.
“Yes.” Sniffing, Malfoy turned away. “Father.”
“Perhaps the Muggle version is sanitized.”
“Wars end when we forgot they happened.” Teddy said it as easily as he said everything, the way one observes that the sky is grey, and it will rain.
“Magic, if it’s a gene, is definitely recessive,” Teddy told no one in particular.
“I just mean it would be weird,” Harry said, putting a card down.  “It would be weird if I was ten but had a wife.”
“You didn’t have any cake either?” Nyala looked horrified.
Then Malfoy’s hand covered Harry’s forehead, and Harry tried to jerk away.  Malfoy’s other hand latched onto Harry’s shoulder, Malfoy’s right hand still on Harry’s brow.  “My hands aren’t made of snakes, Potter,” Malfoy said.  “They’re just hands, despite common rumour.  I’m trying to get your temperature.”
“Who?”
Harry nodded, and Ron looked out over the green, toward where Rune and Malfoy stood laughing. “You could blame him if you want, Harry. It wouldn’t be wrong.”
“F—fuck,” Harry said, his hips lifting off the sheets. “Fuck, don’t—don’t stop. Keep—wow, keep doing it.”
“I thought . . .”  Thinking was difficult, with the way Draco’s teeth were teasing Harry’s ear.  “I thought—Slytherins couldn’t be relied upon to keep their promises.  That’s what you said.”
“Yes, I did.”  Harry walked away.
Harry willed the spell to work, wondering how wrong it would be to try some wordless, wandless magic, just to give the flames a bit of a nudge.  “Wow,” Harry said, when a few of the flames turned green.  “It’s just like Floo fire.”
“‘Didn’t occur to you!’” Andromeda scolded. “I’d been waiting for you to ask. We’re family!”
Malfoy didn’t look up at him, and Harry left him there, staring down at the bottle in his hands.
“Remember I said the solution has several steps?”  Draco glanced over, and Harry thought that he looked really tired.  “I’m writing every step down in this ledger to make sure everything is done properly.”
“It’s a wand,” Mister Malfoy said, still moving the stick.  “It helps direct magic.”
Harry went to go sit beside him anyway.
“What? Yes, I have. I have a happy memory right here, waiting to go.”
“We’ll always be your family,” Hermione said, her beautiful brown eyes bright.
“These bandages are disgusting,” Draco said, ripping them off.
to be, and that’s not who he is anymore.”
!” Harry said, aiming at some chocolate that had spattered on the wall.  It was much more fun than scrubbing or mopping, and Harry went on cleaning.  Even though Mister Malfoy hadn’t been mad, Harry wanted to fix his mistake, figuring it was only right.  Mister Malfoy had such a nice kitchen.
!” Harry said, causing water to rain down on the table.
“You’re a fucking pervert,” Draco said, throwing more things.  “I want to go home.”
On that morning, Harry didn’t see Malfoy until Combat I. As exams were in a month, they were mostly duelling these days, and everyone was on edge, hoping to get as much practice in as possible. Harry wasn’t early, banging in exactly at ten after his walk. Given that it was unexpectedly sunny, he was also overheated; he stripped down to his vest so they could get started straight away. Without thinking about it, Harry glanced at Malfoy, vaguely remembering a time when taking off his shirt had made Malfoy go stuttering and speechless.
Harry understood what Draco was saying now too—what he was really saying.
“He’s . . . his boggart. Is my Patronus.”
heart that’d break.”
“Do you really think Ron will want cucumber?”
“But we’re not friends.”
“You’re still here,” Draco pointed out after a moment.
“Except the Board gave him a suspension. A
“A façade,” said Sibanyoni, “of quiet mornings. A façade. Of coffee. The walls we build around our inner pain. Around our suffering. Harry Potter has known pain. Harry Potter has known death. Did you share your struggle with death, with pain?”
Harry opened his mouth to tear him down another notch, but then remembered Kavika’s calming techniques—listening, looking, smelling, seeing, feeling. Malfoy’s slim figure was standing quite still, but his chest was moving rapidly. Colour was high in his cheeks, contrasting sharply with his light hair. He was afraid, Harry realized, and the anger left him.
Harry tried to get out of the way, but the clothes were already shrinking.
While the faculty remained divided on how to handle the harassment of one of their trainees, Harry conducted an investigation of his own. Though the person leaving the purist messages hadn’t directly threatened her, Fairchild was understandably afraid to attend her classes at Academy. One day in March, Fairchild found her knapsack, which she had left in the cloakroom during a class, filled with mud. Harry had set up Seeing Eyes in the cloakroom, but apparently, he hadn’t got the angle right. The map Harry had made of Academy, which was modelled after the Marauders’ Map, didn’t keep a record of where people went, only showing people in present time.
“You think I’m focusing on Bennet instead of my—my own problems. But sometimes it benefits me. I don’t always want to think about—about . . .”
“That was decisive.”
Malfoy had seemed to revel in all the attention, allowing Harry to escape mostly forgot, except by Nyala Zabini, whom Harry didn’t mind. He had known her previously as Icarus, and she was Teddy’s best friend. “Teddy told me there’s hand-to-hand? In Combat?” she had asked, while Malfoy had regaled the rest of the trainees with vivid tales of causing non-mag men to faint dead away in his arms.
“Wow.” Harry took another bite. “Where?”
Apparently, this was how.
“They literally can’t be,” said Malfoy. “They’re living things. They die.”
“Merlin’s toadstools.  What do you even mean?”
“Because he was rich,” Draco said.
“Oh, Draco. He’s a matter of
“Yes, thank you,” Draco said coldly.  Turning to Harry, his expression softened.  “Are you ready, Harry?”
“Voldemort,” said Nyala.
Malfoy sobbed, and Harry didn’t know what to do.
“How about we go to the kitchen and see what we have.”  They went upstairs to the kitchen, where Harry began opening Draco’s cabinets.  He didn’t know how to make nice lunches like Draco had done for him, not ever having taken time to learn many domestic spells.  “You made a chicken salad, once,” he said, thinking that one couldn’t be too hard.  “Would you like that?”
“I know.” Malfoy looked disgusted, except Harry wasn’t quite clear on whether Harry was disgusted by Edgar Travers’s blood status, or by Pansy Parkinson’s revilement of it. “I’m shocked! Shocked to find a half-blood a
Ron looked about the hall, quiet and thoughtful. He was going to turn back to Harry and say something hopeful and reassuring. “I’m sick of it too,” Ron said instead.
“Afterwards,” Harry said, watching the elegant movements of her hands, but not really seeing them. “After my part of orientation, I mean. You know how they—the trainees always ask questions. They—they’re not trying to be offensive.”
“The magic—hums.  More.  When you—when you do it with me.  It’s like that when my Mum and Dad help me with my practice wand.”
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy began, then stopped.
“You tried to get me in detention!” Harry blurted.
“You . . . saw him?  H-how—how is he?”  Petunia’s voice had that sad quality again, but as usual, she was only ever thinking about Dudley.
Ron was beginning to look uncomfortable.  “I
“Yes,” Harry said. “Last year, my—what I said about the Auror Department upset him.” Realizing that this comment was predicated on Duggins having knowledge of that press conference, Harry didn’t wait for a question, explaining how last year after the incident with Travers’s hate speech, he had told the press blood prejudice was a problem on the Auror Force.
“Prejudice?” Gobsmacked, Harry stopped pacing. “Me? Against
“Because you’re having to—”
“Thirdly,” Draco repeated again, softening his grip on Harry’s hand.  “I became convinced that if you couldn’t—you couldn’t even comfort a boy who was crying his eyes out because he just lost his mum—if you really hated me that much, you would never feel anything different for me.  Before that, I’d thought—I’d thought maybe, just maybe, if I waited long enough and tried hard enough, maybe—in ten or twenty years or so—maybe you could come around enough to—to at least—at least kiss me.  Once.  God.”  Draco looked away.  “I was so pathetic.  That was as high as my aspirations went.  All I wanted was for you to kiss me.”
“Oh. Sure. You mean now.”
“A sex dream doesn’t mean you want anything,” said Yin. “It’s just a dream.”
Draco talked right over him.  “I’m like that, you see; I’m selfish.  I’m so selfish and cowardly; I’m cowardly—”
“Checking your blood.”  Mister Malfoy wrote something down on the parchment, then turned back to Harry, making another movement with his stick.  “
Malfoy’s eyes were nailing Harry to the spot, making him want to protest,
“No.”  Draco walked from the kitchen back to the sitting room, where books were still all over the place.
“You were worried?”  Harry looked up at him.  Draco was still looking into the fire.  “When you were a kid?”
“I’m not going to rank them by hotness,” Charlie said.
23 years
“What we should be past,” said Penelope, “is Draco Malfoy at Level One, when he has obviously proven himself
A few times Malfoy called by Floo with his potions ID, but the first time Malfoy visited Grimmauld Place, Harry was surprised.
Harry would have said it was impossible a moment ago, but Malfoy went a shade paler.
“It’s nothing,” Draco said, shoving the cloth and bundle of papers into the drawer and then snapping it shut with his wand.
Harry sort of wished he could put Vance under Veritaserum as well, only he didn’t have proper cause to suspect a fellow Auror when the witness who had testified against him had already been proven to be a liar.  Just in case, however, Harry went to ask Savage for some of that indicator solution the next day.  When she wasn’t at her desk, he opened the drawer where he’d seen she’d kept it and reached for the bottle.
!”  As Draco’s wand came hurtling into Harry’s hand, air whooshed from the direction of the bookcases into Harry’s wand, depriving the flames of oxygen.  The fires shrank, then died out, and Harry cast the spell to release the captured air back into the room.  Draco’s heart would break, Harry thought wildly, if the books got wet.
“That’s what they call him,” said Kavika. “In the moving pictures.”
Harry was always last to leave the Auror Office, and he thought there might have been poison in his tea.
“I tried to be.”
Draco nodded.  “I don’t suppose you’d appreciate me going there without your permission, but I need to check some things.”
“It means irrational.  Harry.”  Draco hesitated.  “When you first de-aged, and you thought I had kidnapped you—were you scared?”
The smile tugged up a little more.
The letter went on like this, and on, and on, each of the remedies listed in alphabetical order. Harry skipped through the pages to the end, wondering if Malfoy had written anything other than an instruction manual. The list ended on the fifth page, with only one paragraph above Malfoy’s large, swirly “D.M.”
me you didn’t.”
“Studying to be your job,” Harry told him. “Maybe you could have stayed in the safe space while the Aurors handle the—”
“Seriously, Malfoy.  What are you doing?  Besides brewing cures for vampirism?”
“Do you?” Harry said.  “Or are you thinking of the other Harry?  The one who’s twenty-five?”
I wonder if we could use their presses.”
Draco’s breath caught. “Yes.”
“We won’t need mercy,” said Harry. “The Force has been looking for Lestrange and Greyback since the war.”
“But your magic knew.”  Draco nodded across the room at Harry’s fox, who was snoozing in a ball and not paying them any mind.  “We’ve become good friends, your Patronus and I.  I think she’s in love with me.”
Teddy shrugged again. “He didn’t ask.”
After a few minutes, Malfoy returned with a tray with a bunch of little bottles on it.  “These are mainly diagnostic,” Malfoy said, setting the tray beside the chair.  Holding out a small bottle of bright orange liquid, he said, “Drink this.”
“I don’t need anyone taking care of me,” Harry said, practically leaping out of the chair.
item.  You see?  Not a necessity.  We can’t live without me being a shop-keep, or something of that sort.  But we can live without me shagging blokes.”
wearing anything with moving
Kavika always had beautifully ornate wizard robes, edged with intricate patterns of gold along all the swathes of complicated cloth, and Harry watched the rich fabric flow as she spelled the water into the ground beans. “Malfoy brings me coffees.”
“What brought you here.”
This was an obvious wrap-up to the conversation, but Malfoy still stood there, unmoving, and Harry felt a little awkward saying goodbye or leaving without a reply. Eventually, Malfoy stirred. “I haven’t asked you,” he said. “To remove the Mark.”
Lee had said.
“You’ve broken up with your boyfriend?”  Harry’s interest perked.  “Rohit?”
“I think not everyone does,” Teddy said. “And it reminds me that Draco’s also a person.”
Harry was sort of all right with that, though.  After all, Draco was a genius, and he was also a cheater at Quidditch.  Some things didn’t change.
Aurors had laughed. Ron had been furious. Harry had felt as though he wasn’t present, as though he was at a table of Death Eaters, Charity Burbage floating above them; as though he was at the kitchen table in Number Twelve. The Order of the Phoenix talked about fate, but they were not the ones to change it; they were not the ones to die. Harry was at a kitchen table in Privet Drive, but he was not the one to sit at it. Vernon and Petunia and Dudley sat; they ate, but he wasn’t meant to join them. He did not belong.
“I don’t feel responsible for everyone.”
“I’ve been in a
“You know what I mean.”
“Why don’t you think that?”
Harry’s throat felt thick.  “I never said you were.”
“Really?” Harry asked, annoyance having mostly worn off into amusement.  Draco was always saying he knew everything.
“Michael Corner.”
A few people were in the hall—two men and a woman standing in a huddle and talking, two women sitting by the fountain, eating what appeared to be lunch.  When Draco and Harry approached the gold gates, a little man popped out from behind a security stand.  “Haven’t been in in a while!” the man said, beaming.
“Expecto Patronum,” Malfoy said, almost carelessly, but it worked. It worked beautifully. The stag was as big and bright as the last time, forceful in its sudden brilliance. The Dementors fled, and Malfoy continued toward the door.
“Right,” said Savage. “What’s a little war and blood massacre between friends?”
“You got sacked because of me.”
“You were making me feel good,” Harry said.
Harry turned to the trainees, who were still bubbling with excitement. “Malfoy’s just given you a preview of the things you’ll learn next year if you pass your courses this year,” Harry told them.
“What’s a shroud?” asked another kid.
“Thanks,” Draco said, already sounding half-asleep.
Kavika just gave him her usual line. “Tell me more.”
At the end of the second month, a new brew called Ragerade came on the black market.  Ragerade could make you stronger, but also put you into a berserker rage for up to six hours.  Fights had already broken out on Diagon Alley, Gothat Way, and Havanold Avenue.  Those who drank the brew were worn-out after the rage and easily arrested, but the dealer for the potion remained elusive.  Aurors Vance and Kidder were assigned to the case, and they weren’t going to do anything about it.
Looking impatient, Mister Malfoy evidently decided to switch tacks.  “Even if you did switch places, do you really want to leave thirty-year-old you in the past?”
Malfoy closed his eyes again, screwing his face up. “Okay.”
“Yes,” Harry said, remembering how hard this had been for him to believe.  He wasn’t sure he’d ever believed it entirely; he’d just trusted Draco so completely that it hadn’t mattered.
by now and Harry wouldn’t have a fucking clue, except that hopefully he would have seen some evidence of it over the past three weeks.  But it was the fucking Black family, so who the fuck knew.
Draco was still sitting astride him, his mouth hovering by the corner of Harry’s lips. Harry shifted under him. “You.”
“Here?” Malfoy gestured to the door in front of them, the classroom Harry generally used for ADADA.
Gasping, Harry opened his eyes.
“Your turn,” said Harry.
Harry had been asked these questions before.  “I never get sick,” he added.  “I—it was an accident.”
Harry wanted to ask more questions, but the room was already swirling away.
Outside was raining, the last of April a chill mist that washed over Harry’s skin. He wanted it in his mouth. He wanted it all the way inside him, until his chest was full of cool gray nothing, soft and muted, nothing.
“Oh,” said Harry.
Harry looked at Draco, the downward twist to his mouth, the smudges still under his eyes.  Harry didn’t think Draco slept very much on the bunk beds, even though whenever Harry had checked in the middle of the night, Draco had been lying there.  He certainly didn’t snore.
Sighing, Harry put his glasses back on. “Spragg’s right. We know he’s right; they
Question were shouted all at once.
“What if you cheat?” Harry said, but handed them over anyway.
; I’ve sucked their cocks; I’ve smoked fags; I got piercings; I worked in a Muggle restaurant; I’m a shopkeeper’s assistant!  I’ve kept none of them!”
“I brought Teddy,” Malfoy said, beside him. “He’s waiting for her in the corridor. Do you need him?”
“You’ve got more important things to do,” Harry agreed, because it was true.  Malfoy was
“Yes.  I thought not.”
Setting the Wood-Eye Lye on the table in the centre of the room, Malfoy began pulling jars from the shelves.
“Try again,” Harry said, tightening the collar.
“I don’t want any,” Harry called, not even opening the door.  His finger was on the address, but there was nothing he could do with it.  If only he could get to London.
“It attacked me,” Malfoy said quickly.
Ron’s brow creased. “I have to find Hermione. Do you want to come with me?”
“She’s out today, mate,” said Gareth, while Malfoy slipped his hands in his pockets and swaggered inside.
“I like you, Harry,” Draco whispered.  “I like it when we read together like this.  Do you like it as well?”
Harry hitched a shoulder.  “No one ever wants to hear my jokes.  Mostly I have to say them in my head.”
.”  A feeble glow lit at the top of Malfoy’s wand.  “I got it!” Malfoy said, jumping a little against Harry.  He turned to look up at him.  “I got it!”  Malfoy’s eyes were shining.
“Oh.”  Draco took another sip, then set down the pint.  “You know Zabini, of course.”
“Right.”
Harry had no doubt, as Draco’s hand was already cupping the front of Harry’s trousers, massaging slightly, and Draco's tongue was doing things in Harry’s mouth Harry had previously considered filthy.
A moment later, Heloise came flapping down the stairs.  “Oh my days,” Draco breathed.  “An
Oh God.  A part of Harry wanted to laugh.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said.
“Fuck!” said Ron, who was the one left without a Ward Bore, but it was too late. Aurors were popping into the room; the witches and wizards gathered there were turning to them, and then—the view on the IC:WUT/UC was back to the Dementors, then moving—moving—moving—Malfoy had to be leaping
“Ha!” Malfoy barked out a wild laugh.  “Ha ha ha!  No, where is he really?”
“I know,” Harry said again. He knew it viscerally, like a truth branded on his soul. “Go ask him.”
“To sleep in,” Harry said.  “You can store other things in there.  I’ll keep it very clean.”
“Oh, Rune, please. I’ve come on invitation, actually, from former Minister Shacklebolt.”
“Come along,” Mister Malfoy said in that normal way, sweeping off toward the stairs.
Draco turned his head so that the weight of it rested on the side of his face, his hands still moving warmly on their cocks, Harry’s balls. “I wish I had another hand,” Draco said, “so I could touch you more.”
It wasn’t a visit anyway.  Harry had important things to discuss.
“I’ll just jot down my address on this note you were so kind as to send me,” Malfoy was saying, smiling like he thought this was all some kind of joke.  Producing a biro from a pocket—and it was strange to see Malfoy with a biro—he scribbled on the parchment.  “Then you may call on me to your heart’s content, and I shall provide my services to the best of my—”
This was an invitation, warmly and freely made. Recognizing it, Harry gave him half a smile. “If it’s still with Robards, I’m not sure I want to know.”
“What’s a Muggle?”
Dudley’s mouth fell open.  “I’m . . .”  He swallowed hard.  “Sorry.”
“Harry,” Draco said, twisting against him. He stared into Harry’s eyes, lips parted, breathing hard. “I love you. I love you, Harry.”
Harry had told him.
, Harry; are you sure you want to try—”
“I know,” said Teddy.
“Then it can’t be that bad.”
Draco,” Harry said, and Draco came flying over the table, right by the man’s head.
“I know what I said,” Harry said. “I was wrong.”
“I’m saying the Wizengamot is part of a system that is rigged,” Harry said.
good-looking—”
“Any human sacrifice is not acceptable!” Harry bit out.
“Heard what?”
When Harry and Malfoy arrived at the office, only a handful of Aurors were there, Robards among them. Robards wasn’t a secret neo-Death Eater, even if he was too conservative—but that didn’t mean no one on the Force was. They had to keep Malfoy’s information quiet if an Auror or two was to infiltrate the meeting this Friday and find out what was really going on.
Malfoy was making that up—but why would he? Harry had his own need to rub his scar pretty well under control; Malfoy wasn’t imitating him to identify with him. Was he? Fuck, Harry was paranoid. Putting the Veritascope in the drawer, he said, “I’m not changing your grade, Malfoy.”
“Easy to what, Harry?” Kavika asked, when Harry trailed off.
“Pardon?”
“And I’m the best trainee you’ve ever had.”
Draco moaned in absolute pleasure, and took it farther down. Then one of his hands was reaching for Harry’s, bringing Harry’s hand down onto Harry’s own cock, even as Draco sucked it.
“I asked if you thought you would want a wife when you were grown up.”
Harry thought about the little plastic soldier he had.  “I don’t need any toys,” he said quickly.  He was sad to give up the soldier, but he’d much prefer to live with Mister Malfoy.
Draco opened the door, looking gorgeous and miserable all at once.  His skin was pale, lips chapped, eye rimmed with red, as though he had been crying—but his size was good.  He was no longer gaunt at all, similar in shape to the Draco that Harry remembered, except that he wasn’t.  Harry knew what age this was.  “Your mum,” he said.
Draco climbed back on top of him, straddling him, then brought his wand back to Harry’s dick.
Harry just stared at him. He couldn’t feel anything in his body, nothing at all. “Why are you doing this? He’s meant to be your son-in-law.”
Draco began to spell their dishes clean, directing them to the basket.  “Then let’s go,” he said.  “Off to do the right thing.”
Malfoy’s expression hardened up, like melted water instantly freezing over.  “It’s my life’s ambition.  Working in a shop.”
“Mrs Tonks knows such fascinating people!” said the blonde, obviously excited by this.
.  You were right; it can be—fun.  But it’s not the be-all, end-all of my existence.  In fact, I’ve discovered, it’s farther down on the list than I thought.”
Malfoy perked up. “I pass my Defence exam?”
“What was that other thing you gave me?” Harry didn’t particularly want to take the milk, but Mister Malfoy didn’t seem angry.  Warily, Harry took the milk, still holding the phial in his other hand.  He looked down into it.  “Was it poison?”
For a moment, Harry seriously considered diving into the cupboard.  “Um.  Yes?” he said instead.
“I thought I read terribly,” Harry said, opening the book.
Malfoy jerked away from his touch. “Also, you’re bad at it.”
hurt. He was the one who hurt me, and my friends. He was cruel.”
Heloise was meant to find Dudley, and Mister Malfoy had said once she found Dudley they would visit him, but Dudley wasn’t in an estate.  He was at Number Four Privet Drive, and even if Mister Malfoy had let Harry pet an owl, nothing about this seemed right.
The shock that his Accidental Magic had almost done it—that it hadn’t done it—slammed Harry back into his body. He didn’t know where his mind had been, but now his head snapped around to find what had stopped the chandelier—instantly finding Hermione through the crowd, halfway across the room, hurrying toward him in concern but with her wand lifted up at the chandelier, still holding it aloft.
“He’s not going to be an Auror. He’s started . . .” Pulling the crystals apart, Harry let them snap together. “It’s an organization. Kind of. To work on non-mag and magical relations.”
“It’s you,” Draco panted, turning his red face toward Harry. His blond hair stood out against his deep flush; sweat was beginning at his temples. “It’s because it’s you; I’m not normally . . .”
Draco shuddered in a response. “This is stupid.”
The tone and the word choice made Harry want to flinch.  Instead, he held out the handkerchief.
Yin smiled, and they put their heads in the Pensieve.
“What is?”
“No,” Harry said. “Worse. She was with Teddy.”
“I suppose,” Draco said.  “Have you got spell books?”
Harry couldn’t think of a way to prevent the fawn from following him, but it wasn’t as though the Patronus would be able to stop him, as it was incorporeal.  Dumping out the satchel, Harry grabbed the papers with the warehouse address and shoved them in, then slung the bag over his shoulder.  Next, he rushed into the sitting room.  Draco had said wizards kept Floo powder on their chimney pieces.
Malfoy looked open and so honest. “I don’t know where she goes anymore,” Malfoy went on. “We used to tell each other everything, and now . . . since Fudge. She’s angry, and it’s my fault. After what happened. And it happened to me! I was the one her father cast out.”
Malfoy swiped the phials, hard enough to make them all rock violently, clinking together, but not quite hard enough to break them.  “You’re not going to be an adult on me, are you?  We’re the same age.  In fact, if I remember correctly, I think I’m probably older than you.”
“Yes,” Harry said, because his plan was to say yes to Malfoy whenever he possibly could.
Malfoy opened his eyes. “I’m not telling you my memory, Potter.”
“Draco and Astoria helped!” Nyala said, beaming.
“Are you all right?”
“I saw it,” said Adebayo, boggling at Malfoy a little, which Harry supposed was what Malfoy wanted.
“Nothing.”
This was boring. And a trifle embarrassing. Harry strained to see if he could see the figure he had seen earlier, when Parkinson said, “Because you’re a
get a piercing?”
“Yes,” Harry said.
“But that’s why you’re trying to make me old,” Harry said.  “You’re working so hard at it because you’re trying to do the right thing.”
“No.”
“The Ministry of Magic,” Draco said.  “It’s the wizarding government.”
Mister Malfoy looked up at him over his little white pitcher of milk.  “Why not?”
“No, I mean . . .” Harry tried to think about what he felt, the nausea that tightened his stomach when he thought about Malfoy, the cold sweat of dread combined with the flames up the side of his face. “I mean, it’s—it’s embarrassing. Malfoy feeling—that way. It’s . . . mortifying.”
Harry turned back to the cabinet.  “We’re having turkey sandwiches.”
Harry tried to process all of that.  “My aunt and uncle told me my parents died in a car crash.”
The Zabinis had a manor in Dorset. Like many such ancestral magical homes in the country, it had its own wards, which the Reveal referendum had stated the owners would be responsible for dismantling. The families that lived in such homes had for the most part been Concealers to begin with. As there was still some debate as to whether the referendum could really mandate ward drops on private property, many people assumed that most of these country homes would not be Revealed until later. A few rabid Revealers, however, had claimed that these Old Blood homes should be the very first magical spaces to be Revealed, so they could suffer at the hands of non-magicals who had been lied to, Obliviated, and kept in the dark for so long. Nyala had stationed herself there just to make sure nothing awful happened.
“George jokes about everything,” Harry had pointed out.
Malfoy’s worst fear was the fact that his Patronus would reveal his feelings for Harry; of course, he had shame. “What do you want?”
The room exploded, but Harry turned, then walked away. Outdoors was as he had imagined it, a slow, thick quality to the air that only came from excessive heat. Harry usually wore his robes while on campus, but now he Banished them, leaving him only in shirt sleeves and trousers. Taking off his shoes and socks, he walked across the green to the shade of the Timothy Tree, where it was significantly cooler.
Ron gave Harry an almost pitying look. “Then why’d he run from the room?”
“Mm-mm,” Harry said, trying to shake his head while still sucking on it.
Harry stared at him.
“Nothing,” Draco said, but then he went on.  “Your testimony.  It wasn’t . . . ?  Because?”
“Some of them didn’t have a choice.”
“How?” Astoria asked. “Illusion charms?”
“The first part is a potion that will make you grow up.  I think your adult self will know how to find the missing ingredient.  Once you get it, we’ll add it to a different potion.”
Malfoy’s eyes were lined in black.
Harry was about to feel pretty dejected about that, since Draco was right, after all, but then Harry processed Draco’s tone, and the way Draco was looking at him, grinning.  He was actually grinning, with teeth and everything.  “I’m
“But it
The shoulders went stiff.  “I work here,” Malfoy said, after a long moment.  His voice was tight but just as supercilious as it had always been.
“Yes.”
“Can I come over?”
Feeling himself blush, Harry shifted in his chair.  He bet all the girls found Draco very handsome too.
“I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like,” said Zabini.
Malfoy stopped, then came forward, standing on the edge of the kerb beside Harry. “Needed a breath of fresh air.” His eyes flicked down Harry’s throat, to the hand clasped around the locket against his chest, then quickly looked away.
Malfoy tossed his head. “Why not? You wanted it.”
“We learned about dark sigils early in the term.” Harry turned back to Malfoy. “You’ve taken that part twice now.”
” Parkinson sneered. “You know that Potter and Shackleshit and all his little Revealer friends are trying to suggest there’s blood supremacy in the Ministry, when we all
“I don’t hate you,” Malfoy snapped.  Head bowing, he went back to his moss.
“I must confess.” Locking his hands behind his back, Rune had on a boyish smile. “I asked for the invitation. I’m interested in the Order of the Phoenix.”
“Who?” Harry asked, thinking this sounded exciting.  “What did the person do to you?”
When Harry had met Draco again at Slug and Jiggers, he’d talked this way—not with the homophobic slurs, just with the bitingly sarcastic self-criticism.  Harry always used to think Draco was quoting the things he’d heard other people say, the things he thought other people thought of him.  Now Harry was fairly certain Draco had been saying the things he thought of himself—even the things that he knew weren’t true.  Draco thought that people should think those things.  He thought that he deserved it.
The stag was already whooshing away, leaving the room feeling quite dim.
“How sweet,” Draco said, “but it’s not what I said.” Setting the dildo on the bed, Draco picked up his wand again, and tapped the toy. It began to move. More precisely, it began to fuck, a forward thrusting motion across the bed, long firm strokes. “Do you want that in you?”
And that, rather than the kiss, felt good and special and extremely nice—that Draco would want to kiss him.  For no reason.  With what hadn’t seemed like a lot of thought behind it—just an absent gesture, and Harry wondered if that was what it was like to have parents.  Maybe that was what they did—kiss you just because they wanted to, and push you into bathrooms, and never answer questions or explain things fully.  But despite that, maybe they still said nice things, and held you, and gave you good food to eat and a bed to sleep in.  Maybe Draco was what having a dad was like.
“Is this because of that stupid kiss?”
“Malfoy.”
“How about the sitting room,” Mister Malfoy suggested.  “Would you like to sit by the fire?”
“I wasn’t under the apprehension that it was.”
“What?” the man said, sounding irritated.  “Potter, I’m trying to help you!”
“If young Master Malfoy had only left the tree alone,” said Bickford sadly. “How does it look, having dark magic on our grounds?”
“I’m not picking on you,” Harry said softly. “Trainees need to be able to cast one. It’s 101.”
“Of course. Yes. I applied.”
Ron had said once. In the middle of an intense political battle that would change the course of the entire magical world, not to mention the non-mag one, it was no wonder that everyone should become obsessed with what was happening with some rich pure-blood boy. Old Blood was the closest thing Wizarding Britain had to royalty, and who didn’t want to watch royalty get disowned and thrown from the palace because of where they happened to place their cock?
Fuck.  Harry had to be crazy.  Malfoy was just trying to figure how the potion might affect Harry.
“Harry?” Draco said, one minute later.
“I will if I want to.”
“At the Academy.” Harry pushed his skull harder against the tree. “Why did you decide to instruct and train, rather than just continue to be an Auror?”
was rude.”
“About the missing ingredient,” Draco said.  “We need to go to your house.”
“That’s not all.  This powder was crushed in the same Pensieve the first potion you brought me was brewed in—the one that influenced people’s dreams.”
“Let’s not jump to conclusions,” Penelope said. “There needs to be an investigation.”
Harry’s eyes went round.  “Wicked!  Did you ever touch one?”
“What does tyrannical mean?”
“Harry.”  Mister Malfoy hesitated again, and Harry tried to figure out what he had done wrong this time.  Whatever it was, Mister Malfoy seemed to forget about it, because he leaned in toward the fire to cast a spell on it that made some of the orange flames blue, and when he spoke to Harry his voice was much lighter.  “You needn’t call me sir,” he said.
The sneer fell away.  “Pardon?”
“So now, it wouldn’t be inappropriate to have this conversation.”
“Please,” Harry begged. “Touch me. Touch me."
Apparently, transfiguring marshmallows required bones, which sounded disgusting to Harry, but Andromeda had chicken in the refrigerator, which she said would do.  They took some of the meat off of the drumsticks so they could use the leg bones, and set them aside.  Harry recognized Andromeda was being very nice about all of this, which made him feel quite badly when he said he needed to go to the loo.
“You’re cute.”  Savage had sat on the edge of Proudfoot’s desk and turned to look at Proudfoot, the only other Auror who had worked there as long as she had.  “He’s cute.”
Only a Malfoy would say
“Yeah,” Harry said, pushing the bacon around his plate to get some jam on it.  “What, wizards don’t?”
Duggins nodded. “Many people are worried about the affiliations of loved ones just now, what side of Reveal they support.”
“What is Draco Malfoy good at?”
Harry wished he had more coffee.
“Shh,” Harry said.  “You have me.”
Kavika gave him a small smile, a twist of her dark red lips. “How is has he been in your classes?”
“I didn’t mean,” Mister Malfoy began, but stopped when Harry hesitated again.  “Go on,” Mister Malfoy said.  “You can have more later if you want some.”
on the Timothy Tree, where the rain puddled in a leaf loosed fat drops one by one onto a leaf below.
“Mm.” Malfoy licked his lips. “What about Reveal and all the non-magicals outside?”
“But Salazar put it there,” Harry pointed out.
“Cinderella is fantastic,” said Draco, which was even more disappointing, because Cinderella was dead boring.  The idea that you could find out you had a magic godparent had always seemed so utterly unrealistic that Harry thought it was stupid.  Draco went on, “I really like the part where the crows peck out the sisters’ eyes.”
Harry eyed her, realizing they were still in session and Kavika was still his therapist, even if they went to the same parties and had the same friends. “Not fond of crowds,” was all he said.
“Malfoy.” Harry stood up.
“Let me help you,” Harry begged, taking his hands away.
“I’m here,” Harry said, after a moment. “If you need me.”
Today, however, wasn’t a normal session, and he wasn’t sure what to expect. In a normal session, he would’ve probably talked about Orientation. It was always a bit rough, with the trainees’ questions—though this year, for the third time, Malfoy had been there. He’d left coffee on Harry’s desk before the day had started, and he had been wearing what appeared to be a woman’s blouse. This had managed to distract most of the trainees rather thoroughly, much to Harry’s convenience, and instead of trainees asking Harry whether he had PTSD and was a murderer, they wanted to know from Malfoy what it was like to be a gay disowned spy whose father owned a quarter of Diagon.
just leave.”
“And you do?”
“But you
Alby’s delighted demeanour dropped completely.  Turning to her, he said shrewdly, “It’ll cost you.”
“How can you not have had hot chocolate?” Mister Malfoy said, starting up the stairs again.
“Aunt Petunia made it,” Harry said.
“Don’t call her that,” Harry said, managing to keep his voice calm.
“I like it,” Harry said. He didn’t even want to kiss Draco at this point; he just wanted to be close. His nose was behind Draco’s ear, and Harry pressed inward, as though he could burrow farther against Draco’s neck. “I like it so much. Draco, you have no idea how much I want to make you come for me.”
Caffeine could make you jumpy, anxious. Caffeine addiction could make you jumpy and anxious if you
Harry wasn’t sure he was understanding correctly. He had never heard Pillwickle and Greengrass go against each other.
23 years
“Instructor Potter,” said Malfoy. “The specky one with the hair.”
,” he said, and put them back on.
“Whose?”  Harry thought about a sailor’s tattoo, which was a heart on the bicep with an arrow through it.  They generally said “Mom”, but he was sure that was an American thing.  “Was it your mum?”
, Instructor Potter.”
Harry gave her a sardonic look. “Guess.”
“Well, I . . .” Harry ran his fingers over the crystals. “Er, Malfoy, he gave me . . . some remedies? And those have been helping.”
“All right,” Harry agreed.  “I won’t.”
“But it’s not as though the Deal is to appease pure-bloods,” Harry said, struggling to understand. “It’s to protect the non-magical people, when the wards come down.”
“Weren’t you?”
A strange light was in Draco’s eyes, an almost manic energy.  He was still upset about his mum, Harry realized.  Draco was a little off, but it didn’t mean he wasn’t being sincere.
The hardness came back, like a shield. “Those rumours are a fantasy, cooked up by Reveal extremists who want to ruin our way of life.”
“Wood weakens if you stretch it,” Andromeda said, “but Teddy’s bed is sturdy.  It should work all right for a few nights.”
“He’s probably already Disapparated. Teddy, tell me what—”
“By having to hold my dick every other second because I want to come from your touch, just like a teenager?” Draco was facing him, but he still wouldn’t lift his eyes. His body was still flushed pink.
“So, there was a basilisk,” Harry began.
As soon as Harry heard, he put the potion from his latest case in his pocket and Apparated to Malfoy’s flat.
“Because you
“She’s not going to do that to me, is she?” Astoria asked, edging away.
“Oh hullo, Harry,” Bickford said. “We haven’t really begun—we’re awaiting our final member.”
Standing, Harry glanced at Malfoy, just because he couldn’t help it, but Malfoy was deep in a conversation with Nyala and Fairchild. Still, somehow not a single person brushed Harry as he headed for the door.
Harry understood what Draco had been hesitant about.  He could get the permission of a ten-year-old Harry, but he didn’t have the permission of the thirty-one-year-old Harry.  Maybe Draco thought old-him would be mad, and once again Harry thought old-him sounded a bit like an arse.  “But we’re being illegal anyway, right?” Harry said.  “Because we’re breaking in.”
Harry remembered that night, standing outside the Higgledy Piggledy with Malfoy. He remembered the way Malfoy had looked when Fudge had won—just as devastated as Harry had felt. Harry had never thought, not even in a million years, that he could operate on the same political spectrum as Malfoy, much less that he would find a kindred spirit in him.
Harry lay there for a moment a little bit stunned, because people didn’t do that to him—drag him around and climb on top of him. He was the Chosen One; his magic was powerful. He was over six feet tall and his shoulders had got broad; they couldn’t. But Draco was lithe and wiry and strong and here he was manhandling Harry, climbing on top of him and having his way with him, and Harry couldn’t remember the last time he wanted to be fucked this badly. Maybe he never had.
