“Y-yeah…” Harry managed. The pressure on his chest was easing up, but his heartbeat was still too fast for his liking and it still felt like he was chasing after a full breath.
Harry couldn’t help himself. He couldn’t be alone with his thoughts. The need to share or talk about it wasn’t even there; he just needed to be around people who were experiencing this much grief too.
Harry chuckled. “You’re asking if being emotionally vulnerable and sharing my issues with Draco Malfoy and nine strangers was that awkward?”
There was a tiny hitch in his breath as he applied it onto the toned curves of Potter’s shoulders. If Potter noticed, he didn’t say anything.
Draco laughed, making sure there was no hint of jealousy in his expression as he did. “Merlin, can you imagine what dating someone from the wizarding world would mean for you?”
Malfoy shrugged. “I overheard. The flashbacks. I get them too. All the time. Sometimes it’s when I’m using a particular spell or even when I’m just doing nothing. They’re terrible, aren’t they? Makes me want to avoid most of the places I’ve been in my life just because they might trigger them again. Sometimes you think they’re getting less intense and they start happening further apart, but out of nowhere, they get more vivid again. Bloody nightmare.”
“I wouldn’t stay up until midnight multiple times talking about my deepest fears and desires with a bloke if I thought he was ‘just fit.’ You are definitely in too deep, my friend.”
A picture frame on the end table caught Harry’s eye. It was a picture of the three of them with Ginny after her first professional Quidditch game. He remembered how he had felt watching her zoom through the pitch on her broom, her ponytail whipping behind her and the crowd going wild with her name in their mouths. He definitely had been in love with her then. “Yeah.”
way again. I reckon we’ve both outgrown whatever of our relationship is left to return to if I do get back together with her.” Then, Harry groaned. “You’re doing it again.”
Harry woke up breathing hard, hands grasping at his sheets. He sat up, throwing his blanket off the bed; it had felt like he was being suffocated by it.
Staying with his mother wasn’t his first choice when it came to living arrangements. Draco had moved into this house as soon as he got his first job at the Ministry. Living alone had been liberating.
Draco did. Bracing himself up with his hands on the mattress at either side of the man’s head, he started to roll his hips in a slow, even rhythm. He could feel him tighten around him, and Draco bowed his head, whispering curses between them.
Most days, Draco would come over to help with Teddy’s room. This, of course, meant working for 20 minutes maximum. Then, they would spend the next five hours eating takeaway while Potter made him watch his favorite Muggle films or having a beer at the kitchen table while they talked and argued over dumb things. They were especially unproductive whenever Teddy was staying over and demanded that they play with him at all times.
And in my defense, I had just finished a 12-hour shift and felt like throwing up from exhaustion. Didn’t exactly have a big appetite then.”
Draco scoffed. “I work at a hospital with kids who are discovering they can do magic for the first time, Potter. Pretty sure I can handle it.”
Harry laughed, getting down on one knee. “Hey Teddy,” he murmured, giving him a proper hug. “What are you up to?” he asked as he pulled away.
She looked baffled for a moment, then her eyebrows went up as she realized what he meant. “Oh. Well... It’s not
- my tumblr is ginnywcasleys! ty for those who take the time to message me on tumblr and remind me to update lol i need it and yall are heroes.
Draco wanted to think that fucking the man he was currently in bed with would lead to the epiphany that he didn’t actually fancy Potter. He just needed a good fuck after a month of not getting any, surely.
Potter looked up at him curiously, smirking slightly. “Merlin, I don’t know when I’ll start getting used to you doing that.”
Like his weird fascination with how attractive Bill and Charlie were in his teenage years. Or the way his 14-year-old self couldn’t get over how handsome Cedric Diggory was. He probably even had a tiny crush on the barista of the coffee shop he had frequented for the first few months he worked at the Ministry - the place hadn’t been on his way to work and the coffee was terrible.
His heartbeat started to pick up, and his ribs felt like closing in on him. Feeling dizzy, he sat down on the bottom step of the staircase.
He and his team had finally found the last of the Death Eaters who had managed to flee back in 1998. Dolohov.
who doesn’t keep his wand with him. So, I had to do the Apparating,” Draco replied, hugging her back.
She scooted closer to him, linking their arms together like she always did when she was comforting him. Harry rested his cheek on top of her head, once again realizing just how much he had been missing his friends all these months.
"I don't know, honestly - both? I want to talk to him, because I've been thinking a lot about everything, about he and I and where we were and where I'd want to be if we stay together - but I dread it too because what if he's found someone else? What if that's why he's been gone so bloody long?"
"Of course; far be it from me to stand in the way of justice." Draco shook his head, but followed along as Harry walked and talked.
He stopped as the man at the window turned and took a few steps toward him. "I live here - I kind of have access." Draco bit his lip and looked Harry in the eye. "Hello Harry."
Draco let go of Harry’s hand and moved it up to turn Harry’s face firmly to his. “I have been an unbelievable prat and things are going to change – I promise.”
Harry almost said that he'd figured he'd sown most of agricultural England inside Ginny Weasley already, but stopped himself at the last minute. He wasn't sure if that crossed the line of 'shop talk' or not. "Well, if you think it's the right thing to do, sir, I'll take the time. How much do I have?"
Outside the gates of the circus area, the cracks of Apparition were almost deafening as the audience members fled the scene in droves. In minutes, only the performers were left, staring at the wreckage of the tent, the scorched earth, and each other. Minerva was role-calling, moving amongst the stunned performers, ascertaining that everyone was present and accounted for. Harry was doing the same on a more informal scale, and was relieved when he saw two blond heads near the ticket booth.
"I would never try to force you, Harry." Kingsley was far too calm, given the game. "But you do have a lot of time accumulated, so I see no reason why a young, healthy …"
He'd sleep more, waking only to get dressed and go out on his increasingly fruitless search; he had to be careful of what he drank, lest he be too drunk to Apparate back to the City of Lights. And when he did get home?
Draco took a moment to let his eyes adjust to the lights and started moving purposefully through the crowd towards one of the bars; always a good vantage point. He ordered a vodka rocks and was gratified to see that the bottle of vodka was top shelf and new with his drink; a point to the Aussies of the world.
In a way, it felt good to get his worst fear out in the open; the one that invaded his dreams and made him wake with a sick and shaky stomach. Aaron had just looked at him and said simply. "If he has, Harry, then he is, without a doubt, the biggest fool the world has ever known."
Harry nodded and turned, leaving the tent and squinting in the late afternoon sun. He decided that Draco just needed a little exposure to the group, a little accommodating for a bit, and then he'd surely be fine. Much cheered, he headed back to the family tent, intent on showing his best face to the newcomers.
Draco came a moment before the words had a chance to register, but when they did register, he gaped, taking a second to comprehend. "Obviously," Draco answered, his voice curt, the hurt evident. "Sorry to keep you up."
>Dumbledore watched approvingly, having had a talk with Filch about the need for accurate counting down when firing boys out of cannons. So it was with great confidence that he introduced Harry, and as he waved his wand grandly as he got to three, the cannon went off, and Harry went hurtling through the air.
He listened to the refrigerator hum: to the heater clicking on and off: to the cars going by their townhouse. To the water dripping in the kitchen; they had a leaky faucet there, and Harry just hadn't fixed it yet. He listened to his own heart beating, the sound his silver lighter made when snapped open and closed, and to his own breathing. He thought about Draco; thought about how his voice had been shaking when he asked Harry not to go, not to leave him. He thought about how Draco had lain awake every night, waiting for him to come home, and then pretending to be asleep so that they wouldn't fight. He thought about the look in his eyes the day Harry hadn't responded to him in bed, the hurt when Harry had been so callous in asking if he'd come yet. He thought about Draco steadfastly not asking where he was going or who he was going with; he'd thought it was just thoughtlessness on the other man’s part, more not caring - but were the thoughts just so painful that he couldn't stand it?
“It doesn’t. Of course not. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t worthy or capable of redemption,” she said. “You know he’s an apprentice at St. Mungos now? That’s why he went back to get his N.E.W.T.s. He specializes in helping Muggle-born kids who get injured from their own magic acting up in dangerous ways before they turn 11. Treating them, orienting the parents and helping them understand, helping the kids cope with their new lives…”
Draco felt his cheeks flush. He hoped Potter would just assume it was from the Firewhiskey he’s been sipping. “Merlin, how much did Andromeda tell you about me?”
He walked into the room to see Malfoy doing the dishes. Harry leaned against the entryway of the kitchen, just watching him. His blond hair was slightly disheveled, a few strands falling to his face. The sleeves of his button-down shirt were rolled up to his elbows, and the topmost buttons were unfastened. Harry swallowed hard.
“I think that you’re capable of trusting people more than you’re aware of... And that more people are deserving of that trust than you believe.”
Draco felt awkward. He knew that Potter probably wanted him to get up and leave him alone. But, for some reason, he felt like he couldn’t just do that.
“Right. Yeah…” Draco took his wand out of his pocket and summoned a wine glass from the kitchen. He grabbed the bottle of wine on the coffee table and poured it into his glass.
“It’s… It’s alright, I guess,” Malfoy said, keeping his hands in his pockets and looking down. “I… I actually didn’t mind, which is… strange.”
“If you say so.” Draco took a sip, and his throat instantly felt like it was on fire, but the burn felt good.
“I am… I just... Had the urge to call you. And tell you I’m sorry that I haven’t reached out to you two in a while.”
“I’m still sorry for recommending you that group though,” Andromeda added. “I completely forgot that I heard about that particular one from Draco a few weeks back. Was it really that awkward?”
Draco looked away from Potter. He's only ever said it out loud to a few people: McGonagall, his mother, his supervisors at the hospital, Astoria. The thought that he, someone who was on the wrong side of the war, could be a teacher in charge of young people’s education did sound ridiculous. But it was real. And saying it out loud made it even more real, which was terrifying.
Draco looked up and saw Potter, who was walking over to him with a box full of books. He was wearing a white t-shirt that clung to his body, and his muscled arms were flexing from the weight he was carrying.
“You two would be good friends,” she clarified, her eyes not leaving the pages of her book. “And it would be good for Teddy.”
Malfoy sighed. “I hope so… You should take up McGonagall’s offer, Potter. Maybe no one will look my way if they’re too busy getting hyped up about the Boy Who Lived being their children’s professor,” he said, grinning.
Most of the time, it wasn’t so bad. Draco knew how to treat him like any other friend. But, sometimes, he would blush too hard when Potter was close. Sometimes, Potter would tease him about zoning out so much, because that was the excuse Draco used when he was caught staring. Sometimes, when he touched Potter, a friendly pat on the shoulder or an accidental graze of a hand, Draco would find himself lingering for a few seconds before he could stop himself.
“That’s the thing, though,” Harry replied, looking at the floor. “I feel guilty letting a new person into my life when I’ve been a terrible friend to the people who are already in it. Saying I want space because all this grief is catching up to me is one thing. But saying it and then making space for new people when I can’t even let the friends I already had back into my life is… I feel like I’m being hypocritical.”
harry and draco keep accidentally flirting with each other and still have the audacity to be surprised abt the events that follow
Harry’s favorite part was the wall where the mural of the Black family tree had been. He, together with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny, had spent an afternoon painting a beautiful maroon shade over it without any magic. Once it was dry, they covered the entire wall with framed photos of everyone in Harry’s life. A photo of Harry and Ginny laughing in a pub. Ron and Hermione beaming in front of the house they had just bought. Teddy and Victoire in tiny matching Weasley sweaters during Victoire’s first Christmas.
He and Andromeda had gotten close. They used to just talk in brief, polite exchanges whenever one of them would drop Teddy off, but in the past year, Andromeda had managed to get past his walls.
Harry sat on his bench and looked at the bike he had just finished working on. Between the thing being older than him and the fact he hasn’t been using magic, it was a nightmare to maintain. It didn’t matter, though. Harry liked having the bike.
As he sat down in the circle, he caught Malfoy’s eye and immediately felt guilty. It was the Sunday morning meeting, the one Harry said he’d stay clear of. He shot him an apologetic look.
Harry heard his fridge and cupboard open and close, and within seconds, a bag of crisps and two bottles of beer came zooming to them.
“Aw, really?” she cooed, placing a hand over her heart. “You know, I was pretty surprised when he befriended me in the first place. He never really opens up to anyone else. Well, until you obviously.”
Ginny chuckled and elbowed him softly. “That they want the boy who saved the wizarding world to join the Auror training program? Yeah, that’s mad.”
Harry had actually been excited about this mission. The idea of taking down the last of them had felt like closure, especially because it was the man who killed Lupin. But when it was time to capture him, when he found himself across Dolohov, Harry had felt like he was frozen to the floor, arms unable to move. The next thing he remembered was waking up to the hospital ceiling.
“Well, alright then.” He gave Harry an encouraging pat on the shoulder before leaving the room and shutting the door behind him.
He had told Ron, who had been eager to go home immediately and write Hermione about his first day, to go ahead right after the last orientation ended. Hermione had decided to go back to school to get her N.E.W.T.s, which came to no surprise to anyone. It was the only part of Auror training that Ron seemed to hate - being apart from her. Still, Harry watched his best friend gape in awe and excitement at everything their mentors said during the sessions.
o’clock in the bloody morning, and you barged into my flat yelling about a boy. I’m not exactly in a
Running his hands through his hair desperately, Harry shrugged. “We’re...We’re sort of friends now?”
the boys are still being stupid abt romantic relationships but who can blame them when they're traumatized and were made to believe they don't deserve love : (
Draco noticed that his voice was a bit deeper now. Or maybe it just sounded like it was because of how laidback it was. He was too used to Potter raising his voice, always on the offensive.
“She’s having it the night before her birthday since that’ll be a Friday.” Draco peered at him, noticing him wince a little at that. “Are you sure you’ll be okay? I know it’s more than a month from now, but... She invited a ton of people. It’ll be...a lot.”
dealt with it, as if healing just came automatically with time. I guess I was just…ignoring it all this time. So, I figured I’d actually… do something about it this time.”
- motorbike rides? kisses in the middle of the night? a promise of more the next time they meet? this is the chapter i imagined vividly for weeks before giving in and deciding to write this fic im ngl. love these dumb boys. took them a while but here we are :')
were so young. And Harry was starting to live a whole other part of life that his parents will never experience.
Draco figured that Potter must have been a little tipsy too if he was admitting that. “You’re the last person who owes the wizarding world anything.”
Malfoy glanced at Harry’s hand. With blood rushing to his face, Harry realized he was still holding the other boy by the arm.
Harry stood up a bit too quickly as if shaking off whatever he was starting to piece together. “Here!”
She shrugged as she started to put her dark brown hair up in a ponytail as she always did when it was nearly time for her to get back to her shift after a break. “You love me.”
“That’s true,” a young woman whose name Harry knew was Fatima piped up with a kind, empathetic expression. “For the first time since my boyfriend died, I’ve been spending time with our mutual friends. It’s a part of my life I thought was off-limits now, but every time I laugh with them, it feels like transforming that particular trace of him into something beautiful.”
of us had to have some semblance of discipline,” Draco replied, wiping sauce from his mouth with a paper napkin. “Besides, this is actually...not terrible.”
“Yes it was. When he was a child. Before Hogwarts. Before your father and Remus,” she replied. Harry knew she left out Peter on purpose. “I was like that too, then I met Ted and my other friends. We were lucky, Harry. We met good people who helped us grow into ourselves rather than just the people our family was making us become.”
- they're going THROUGH IT i know i know but dont worry ok hang in there they'll get there sooner than u think. on an unrelated note im having fun writing the next chapter :) :) :)
“Oh, er...He just sort of came into my life at the exact moment I realized I was ready to get better, I guess…” He took a deep breath, and before he could hesitate, he continued, baring himself a bit more. “And, well... He understood what it was like to emerge from a war feeling like nothing more than a shell made of everything the world was expecting us to be...So, he’s been really good at helping me through that...
Astoria put down her makeup, finally turning to him. “Well, if you don’t want to go for it, then there really is just one other option is there?”
Harry looked up at Malfoy who was only now wearing a crisp black shirt tucked neatly into his tapered trousers. He grinned at Harry, and Harry felt a strange tug in his chest.
Knowing Andromeda was safe filled Draco with relief. He hadn’t expected to get along with her. She was almost twice his age after all. But Draco never really had any family that he liked. “Who’s watching Teddy?”
“Thanks, Malfoy,” he muttered. “If you told me years ago that I’d end up trusting you this much, I would have laughed at your face.”
“We met in the support group two months ago, and Andromeda forced us to spend time together, is the short story,” Malfoy answered, shooting a sympathetic smile at Harry.
Thinking about what magical abilities Andromeda must have had to convince him to talk to a bunch of strangers about his dead parents, Harry let himself in.
It was Harry’s third meeting. He hadn’t planned on going today, but the moment Andromeda had picked Teddy up from his place and he was left with an empty house again, he felt the strong urge to go.
sorry for the wait! for what it's worth this chapter ended up like... twice as long as i had planned.
“Oh, I forgot to ask,” Potter started, mouth half-full of chow mein and finally meeting his eye. “Did you and Andromeda decide on the date for her party? I need to…er...you know, prepare to be around a huge group of wizards for the first time in a while.”
Most of Sirius’ belongings must have been at Harry’s grandparents’ house from when Sirius had run away from Grimmauld Place or the flat he had lived in with Remus before he was sent to Azkaban. Harry realized he didn’t know where either of those places were.
“Bit ironic, isn’t it?” Draco had meant it to be teasing, but as soon as he said it he was immediately scared that it sounded the tiniest bit bitter.
“Huh. You’re really changing that place for the better. And you’re just an apprentice. That’s some Hermione Granger-level stuff.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “I thought that just meant that you both met up once a month and wrote each other."
Potter straightened, eyes now alert. He pulled out a small, rectangular contraption with buttons on it. It was a mobile phone. Draco recognized it as soon as he got a clear view. More and more of his Muggle-born and Half-Blood patients were starting to have them.
), which had him up a bit past his bedtime, he was starting to get sleepy. He snuggled up to Harry’s chest and hummed contentedly. “Tell me more, okay?”
The wall was now filled with picture frames of different shapes and sizes, the photos showing just how full of love Teddy’s life was: Teddy and Harry posing in front of a huge sandcastle they had made together on a trip to the beach. Teddy and Andromeda sitting crossed-legged in the grass, the two of them laughing as his hair color switched with every sneeze. Teddy walking down Diagon Alley for the first time, gaping at the storefronts, one hand holding Ron’s and the other in Hermione’s.
Andromeda shook his head. “It was an anonymous donation. I think only Kingsley knew. Draco didn’t even want me to know, but I stumbled upon the papers when I was helping Narcissa clean up. ”
As he watched Potter grin and slowly get back up on his feet, the tiny bit of hope Draco now had - hope that maybe Potter could feel the same way - felt like subtle discomfort. Like a whisper at the back of his head begging him to stop this delusion. Like a slow, quiet ache.
Astoria glanced at him, a look of pity obvious in her face. “It’s alright, I suppose. I know it’s been stressing you out. For what it’s worth, though, I think he fancies you too.”
Harry walked back to him, handing the framed photograph over to let him take a better look at it. “You were saying?”
Harry felt his breath get stuck in his chest for a couple moments before speaking. “Didn’t know you’d be here.”
“Oh... Well, McGonagall wouldn’t let them touch you if she thought you were doing a great job, Malfoy.”
Laughing, Potter took a sip and set his drink down on the coffee table. “He’s asleep. He hasn’t woken up in the middle of the night since he was two. A glass won’t hurt.”
“Well,” Harry said, absentmindedly ruffling his hair, “If my godson is already going around calling you Uncle
Draco sighed. “Yeah, that’s… That’s what I wanted to talk about. There’s an alternate timetable for the group. I know it must be uncomfortable sharing all that when someone you know is in the room. Especially when that person is me.”
“There’s a reason it took us almost two weeks just to paint the walls,” Draco quipped without looking back, but he could hear Potter groan as soon as he said it.
Then, they locked eyes. And Draco wasn’t unsure anymore.The shock on the man’s face and the polite half-nod that Draco recognized from those awkward hallway encounters at the Ministry? Definitely Potter.
Teddy rolled off of Draco’s lap, landing on the sofa’s cushions. He started to bounce in place, grinning wide, and pointed at his godfather. “You didn’t tell me, ‘Arry!”
“Hey, Potter, where do you keep the-” Malfoy cut himself off, his eyes going wide. “You know, what? I’ll figure it out,” he stammered before turning around immediately and heading back up the steps.
It was his dad, flipping off the camera. Next to him was a red-headed girl who was hiding her face in with her hands but was visibly laughing, as if Sirius had just caught them doing something they shouldn’t have. They were sitting on the top step of the staircase that led to the Gryffindor boys’ dormitory.
person he knew...And...And he said that’s why he thinks you should rest now...and do what you want to do... Because you helped so many people already.”
They stayed quiet for a few moments, staring at the way the moonlight illuminates a patch of the floor. The constellations on the carpet glow.
It was simply just that Draco had realized that Potter was an attractive bloke. And that he was kind and funny. And that he made the people around him feel good. These shouldn’t be earth-shattering truths. Almost everyone who knew Harry Potter would describe him as that. Knowing all these things now shouldn’t be counted as having feelings for him, right?
Lucius Malfoy had gotten a life sentence to Azkaban immediately after the war. But moments ago were the trials of Draco Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy. The shock on the Wizengamot’s faces when Harry had started to testify in their defense was etched in his mind as he splashed cold water onto his face.
” he asked in a short exhale, eyes still fixed on his. The green lights going off in his head start to fade. He focused on the grey eyes in front of him.
“Nah. Only went out a few months. None of my relationships really lasted a significant amount of time. It’s either the angry letters from father in Azkaban get to me or the fact that I was a Death Eater starts to bother them. Not exactly the ideal bachelor.”
He hoped he wasn’t blushing. “You know, not the best movies to introduce to someone who's never seen one before, Potter. Those were chaotic.”
It was hard to see that the Malfoy who had made his life so much harder during the war was the same person who had just spent his night off cleaning up a room with him and making him believe things were going to be okay. Harry now realized how ridiculous it was that he was so pained about his dad and Sirius being complete tossers at the age of 15.
When Harry took note of how fast his heart was still beating, he had a suspicion it was for a different reason this time.
When Harry got back to Grimmauld Place, he went directly up to Teddy’s bedroom where he found his godson fast asleep and Malfoy sitting next to him, reading a paperback.
He took cautious steps toward the circle that was already formed in the middle of the room, which seemed to double as a dance studio.
Glancing at a clock on the wall, he wondered where Malfoy was. It was pretty early in the morning. The only reason Harry was awake was because he had been woken by a nightmare he couldn't even remember again. Still, Malfoy was usually on time.
” Harry snickered. “This was almost worse than when we were deciding what kind of blue to paint the walls.”
“I’m sorry, do I need to get my hearing checked? Because I thought you just said you’re friends with Draco
“The past few weeks have been pretty fun,” Potter said, his other hand tracing a constellation on the carpet.
Harry’s mind started to race at everything Hermione had just said. Everything she pointed out made sense. But it was still too scary to admit what that meant for him, even though he wasn’t completely sure he knew what that was. “Do I really seem better?”
“You pay me in alcohol,” Draco replied, pausing to twirl another forkful of pasta and raising it for emphasis, “And food. So, I’m not complaining.”
Maybe it was just that Harry hadn’t really made any new friends in the past few years. That was it, right?
As he swallowed a mouthful of the spaghetti bolognese Potter had whipped up for them he looked across the kitchen table and scrunched up his nose as if to say
Ignoring Potter’s protests, Draco repeatedly circled the tip of his wand over the wound, saying an incantation under his breath. The cut closed and dried slowly until all was left was a dark scar. With a last wave of his wand, the remaining blood slipped off Potter’s palm and disappeared in mid-air. “The scar should fade by tomorrow morning.”
Draco walked up the steps, wondering where Potter was. He had told Draco yesterday when they were watching a movie that he should come over because Teddy always asked for him now. Smiling at the thought of his nephew eagerly looking for him, he hastened his pace.
They continued to sort things into boxes in silence. Harry didn’t know what to say. It was a surprise, yeah. But it didn’t matter. Of course, it was easy for him to say. He didn’t know how much Malfoy trusted Harry to not be weird about this.
“… It’s the only room I haven’t cleaned out all these years. I haven’t even been in it alone since the war. It’s… hard.”
When they got to the fourth floor where Harry’s bedroom and Sirius’ old room are, Malfoy groaned. “I forgot how many floors this place has.”
She rolled her eyes fondly. “You were always a difficult customer, kid. Can’t you just point to something for once?”
“He’s still asleep in my room. Said he loved his new room but didn’t want to sleep in it until it was completely finished,” Harry said, laughing.
Regardless, there was still a strangeness to how close Harry felt to him. It was different from being around Ron and Hermione. The warmth and comfort of being with a friend were there, sure, but there was something else.
The moment he was alone in the room for the first time in years, Harry felt himself tense up a bit. He stood up, looking around at the room, and took a deep breath.
But even as he felt the pleasure start to mercilessly build up, legs shaking and moans escaping his mouth, his thoughts were still too entangled in visions of green eyes and brown skin and a sweet, lopsided grin.
” Malfoy grabbed his face with both hands gently, keeping his head still. And there they were. Those grey eyes. Soft, brown lashes. Worried crease in the brow. “Hey…You’re
Harry felt his anxiety ebb away as he tried not to laugh, handing the gift to Ron anyway. “They’re apology flowers! Besides, you two keep forgetting to replace the dead plant on your coffee table.”
“I told you. I’ve started talking to Narcissa again after Lucius passed away,” she said, nonchalantly.
Andromeda, in her apron, opened the door after a few knocks. She immediately frowned at his helmet hair.
Draco watched Potter roll his eyes and begin to push the wardrobe towards the other wall. He knew that he could help and get the job done with just a few flicks of a wand. But, as his gaze dragged along the flexed muscles of Potter’s arms and the sweat dripping down his neck, Draco figured he didn’t feel
Draco was about to ask what, exactly, were microwave meals, but decided he was more interested in the fond look on Potter’s face. “D’you miss them? The Weasleys?”
“I didn’t think you’d still be up,” Draco said as he walked into the kitchen to find his mother nursing a glass of wine at the kitchen island. She was in silk pyjamas, and her long blonde hair was neatly braided down her back. He was always stunned at how regal she looked, even now, in her sleepwear at midnight.
Malfoy gave him a look, and Harry instantly knew he should just give it a rest. How easily Malfoy read people - read
” she exclaimed, waving her arms in frustration. “Thought the promotion would mean I get more independence, but I can’t even get funding for the educational reforms and subsidies without sucking up to rich names who think they’re heroes for not being one of the families who were murdering people four years ago. Now, I have to plan a bloody fundraiser so that they can get drunk enough to care a bit more.”
, Draco Malfoy found himself in the parking lot of the community center. He was late. Really late. He should have been here half an hour ago.
Just the image of Potter straddling a motorbike with such ease was jarring for Draco. He couldn’t quite place why that was.
Harry leaned back on the bookshelf, crossing his arms. “How did you even find this place? The only wizards we get here are Mr. Thornton’s family friends and business partners.”
After dinner, Andromeda and Malfoy had transferred to her studio to plan for her 50th birthday that was coming in around a month. (Andromeda had looked pointedly at Harry when she said
“I… I don’t know. It’s a long story. But basically it kind of just reminds me that I’ve done some dumb mistakes in the past that have hurt people.”
Her face dropped, and she put her hands on her hips. Harry remembered liking her so much because she seemed like an older, kookier, Muggle version of Andromeda sometimes. “Oh, well that explains things... Well, I’m sorry to hear, kid! But, you know what they say, plenty of fish in the sea and all...Bet you're here for your new girl, eh?”
Harry touched the wood of the bedposts, feeling the few scratches on the surface underneath his fingers. “You would have loved Teddy... I mean, of course you would. He’s your best friend’s kid. And he looks more and more like him every day. Whenever I look at him and see Remus, I wonder if this is what you two felt when you first saw me, spitting image of my dad and all...
And either because he was hungry or because he had quickly learned these past few weeks that he was near incapable of saying no to the man, Draco sighed and turned around. “Okay, fine. We’re almost done anyway. And I suppose it
He took another look at Potter as he sipped the coffee.  Potter’s hair was the messiest it’s ever been, and his t-shirt was wrinkled. Draco’s eyes travelled south and saw that Potter’s pajamas that he changed into in between movies were riding really low, exposing a strip of dark skin and the contours of his abdomen. He took another long sip in a desperate attempt to hide his face, which he was sure was reddening.
Potter smiled, and it was enough for Draco to convince himself this wasn’t a completely terrible idea. “Great!”
“Yeah, but it’s her 50th birthday. And it’s the first time she’s been willing to celebrate her birthday since Tonks and Ted died… I want to be there for her.”
She nodded. “It does. But, I’ve grown quite a bit close to Draco. Got along with him more than I did with Narcissa when I first visited them all those months ago.”
He was about to get up and suggest that they should go help Ron because they had cooked so much food earlier, but Hermione spoke again.
Harry snorted as Malfoy picked the bottle. Malfoy made a face at him as he tapped their bottles with the tip of his wand to open them.
“For what it’s worth, if it was otherwise, you wouldn’t be doing all the good that you’re doing now.”
Trying to keep in a laugh so as not to wake Teddy, Harry reached over his godson to punch Malfoy in the shoulder. "Such a prick."
"Is he alright?" he asked as he approached the bed, taking a seat on Teddy’s other side. He pressed the back of his hand against Teddy’s forehead then his neck.
As he closed his window and leaned back in his chair, he spotted another letter on his desk, underneath his books. It was from Ron. He had received it in the morning when he was half-asleep.
Fortunately, Andromeda had said she didn’t mind him coming over for dinner. Actually, her exact words were
“Okay, now g-” Before Harry could finish, Teddy was already scrambling to pick up his dragons. He stood up, watching his godson run up the stairs in amusement, then he noticed that multiple voices were coming from the kitchen.
Harry cleared his throat, shuffling awkwardly in his seat. “Well, er… Okay. I’ve been… I made a new friend, actually. And it’s been helping me because this person went through a lot of the same things that I did.”
Potter held out his hand, palm-up, and Draco took it, examining the dark scar. It looked more faded now, but without the right potions on hand, it was still bound to hurt.
“I just... I just wanted...You know. To say that,” Harry stammered. What was going on? Why did Malfoy have this effect on him? What
“Oh, alright,” Potter said, looking disappointed. Or maybe Draco just wanted him to be disappointed and read it that way. He wasn’t sure. “Well, I’ll see you.”
“Brilliant!” Harry matched his enthusiasm, which wasn’t hard. Teddy’s joy was always some degree of contagious no matter what he was talking about. “How tall is it going to be? Dragons can fly pretty high.”
“It’s alright. You’re doing better than Malfoy. In the past month, he’s probably already told Teddy about each time I got in trouble back in school,” Harry said, starting to gather the loose blocks on the floor.
Harry pressed the button with the number eight on it and turned to Malfoy as the usual female voice said,
“Sorry I’m late, I-” He stopped, frowning at the room, taking a few cautious steps in. “Wasn’t this…”
“Yeah? For your dragons?” he guessed. It was his godson’s latest obsession. Months before, it had been Hippogriffs.
Potter smirked. “He’s actually good with Teddy. Didn’t even drop him the first time all of Teddy’s nails turned into claws.”
Before he could follow that train of thought, there was a thud of a closing door from down the hall.
The idea of spending more time with Potter should sound excruciating to him, but so far, it has felt… good. And he found himself thinking that he actually did want to keep doing it.
“That’s great, Harry. Letting yourself trust new people and expanding your support system is a great way to progress your healing journey.”
Harry grabbed his hand and was pulled up, ending up face to face to Malfoy. This close, in the moonlight, he noticed how Malfoy’s grey eyes somehow gleamed with warmth. Harry had always thought the color made the boy look more stoic and cold. It was different now.
"It's not nothing. That was...Er…It’s really cool of you,” Harry managed, not knowing how else to convey how in awe he is of every new thing he has learned about him these past few months without giving too much away.
“Y-yeah, yeah. Like you said. I’m clumsy,” he said, laughing a little but keeping his head down, eyes fixed on his food as they started to eat.
Draco didn’t really mind. He just knew that if he was going to keep hiding his feelings, which is definitely the plan, he had to pretend he did.
Leaning back and tucking his feet underneath him, Potter shook his head. “No, trust me. It’s me. I’ve been practically avoiding everyone for the better part of a year now. I hardly ever see Ron and Hermione anymore.”
People really do change. And grow. Maybe it was about time he gave the ones around him a true, genuine chance to get to know the person he was now. And trust that they’ve also changed enough to not see him as the savior he was at seventeen, even if they were there to experience that part of his life more intimately than anyone else.
“Of course we forgive you, mate. It’s just…” He sighed, crossing his arms and leaning back. “Look, I understand why all that happened. I do, alright? And I don't blame you for it. I know a lot of it was beyond your control. But...I guess understanding what you were going through and knowing that you weren't doing it intentionally didn't change the fact that...it hurt."
"Shut up you pervert – Harry's not interested." Ginny linked her arm possessively through Harry's, pushing her hand down into his pocket. She was now forced to actually dip her face into her popcorn – extra butter – to eat, since her hands were full.
"I had tea and scones with Father in our tent, yes. I did pass by the eating tent, but the smells made me wonder if someone was roasting a gross of newts."
He'd left work at noon, at his co-worker's urging; they hadn't exactly said he was useless, but close enough, and he had agreed. He'd come home, tried fruitlessly to nap, and finally gave up and turned to cooking. He'd made chocolate chip cookies, two loaves of bread and a pie before finally shutting off the cooker and going upstairs to shower. He looked at himself in the mirror and was surprised to see that he looked calm, cause he sure as hell didn't feel calm.
"No, no. That would be "Slurpy O'Slutivan." Charlie has the whole series." Harry looked up from where he was thumbing through the book. "Can we get down to business now?"
"I guess so." Harry stood up and brushed himself off, then took the camera from him with a small smile, untangling the strap and hanging it back around his neck.
Tonight's experience had not been as bad as he feared, however; the clowns were a bit less clownish than he had expected, the animals were magnificent, and the skits from the bit performers had been rather amusing. And to be honest, the Potter boy and the cannon had made him laugh excessively. He'd noted that Draco had nearly fallen over laughing and reflected that his son shared his same, slightly twisted sense of humor. It had also not escaped his notice that the Potter boy had been quite openly ogling his son, although Draco's nose had been quite firmly planted in the air, as usual. He had to admit that while Potter was not exactly what he had chosen, his father had been a pureblood and in this changing world, a half-blood was better than nothing. He would not encourage this, particularly, but neither would he discourage it. They were sixteen, after all, and nearly adults.
"I know the feeling - I'm going through that myself." Harry sighed and lit a cigarette, offering the pack to Draco, who took one as well.
Harry had dragged Draco to the center ring and still had his hand firmly on his arm. "Mr. Malfoy, I know you're upset and rightly so, but this has nothing to do with the circus. This is personal and engineered by one person, and I'm about to expose them."
Harry wondered briefly if this was a trick question. "Draco is gorgeous, Gin; what else should I have done?"
"Love you too, and thanks for the advice.” He walked in front of the fire and Hermione shrieked, "HARRY!" But before he could say anything else, Hermione was gone, and a naked, thoughtful Harry was left alone to ponder.
Draco watched Harry from the upper deck; he'd gotten lucky in figuring out where Harry would be tonight. He watched men rub against Harry, watched Harry let them, watched him throw back his head and laugh. He'd never seen Harry dance before – not willingly anyway, and 4th year didn't count – and he was amazed at the other man's fluid grace. But hell, Potter was amazing in bed, so it figured the moves might translate to the dance floor, given that this type of dancing was merely vertical fucking after all.
The next day was an 'in-between' day; a day for the performers to rest, try out any new tricks or routines, or just socialize. While Harry loved the show nights, he also liked these days, as it allowed him to check in with everyone, hear the gossip, smooth any ruffled feathers; he was good at that, and Dumbledore encouraged it because no one ever got angry with Harry.
Black Camelot. Harry was pretty sure he'd never heard the name before. He tried to envision what a black Camelot would be, and could only imagine an inky murk spreading over the Round Table as Arthur and his knights slowly sank into the floor - damn his classical education.
The amount would have made even Draco blanch in any other circumstances; if this was routine for Pansy, he hoped Nott kept making money and invested it wisely, or his wife's expensive tastes were gonna land him in debtor's prison. But he handed the man his Gringott's card and added a large tip to the amount, signing off and leaving the salon, Blaise beside him, close, a silent show of support.
The edge of the spot was curling up, and he carefully tried to peel the spot away; a small bit came up, and it had small specks of something familiar and white in it. Harry held it up, then carefully wrapped it in his handkerchief. It went under his bed with the dirt clod and he was left with much to think of as he extinguished the light in his tent that evening - but not before reviewing some very important reading material.
"How did you, of all people, ever wind up in a Muggle glam band?" Harry's voice was raspy, as though he didn't use it much. "No one except your psychotic mentor hated Muggles more than you."
Draco, for his part, supposed that now Potter knew who he was, he'd make some grand gesture of burning any and all fan boy merchandise he'd collected in the course of his apparent obsession. Yet here he was, not moving, and turning his head just barely to watch the pale gray smoke of Draco's cigarette rise in a thin column towards the streetlight and disappear.
Many considered the Malfoys pompous and entitled, and many more regarded them with deep suspicion – no two men could be that pretty. It just was not natural to be that blond, that grey-eyed, have noses that straight or lips that pouty. It had to be a glamour, and if there was anything the family looked down on, it was artifice. In the family's opinion, if you were pretty, you were lucky and if you were ugly? You dealt with it and moved on. That was the way it was done.
loved. The schoolboy crush had never faded, never gone stale or sour, never even flagged in its intensity.
"Mmmhmm – he caught himself a diplomat from Johannesburg, this time, quite a lovely man. I wouldn't have minded a crack at him, myself." She inspected her nails and sighed, presumably over lost opportunities.
For a brief moment, even in his drunken state, Draco hoped Harry would ask him to come home with him, but then if Harry asked Aaron to come home with him, it wouldn't be him and - shit. The full on bloody irony of this situation was unreal.
Draco wrinkled his nose.“Hmmm, that my husband chose this day to be a prat to me when I come home, tired and wanting nothing more than to be cuddled and…”
In the main area, Ginny was being held between two Ministry Aurors as her sentence was read. As Dumbledore finished speaking, a roar of laughter went up. Even the Weasleys were laughing; some behind hands and some openly.
Against his better judgment, Harry stood and walked over to the table where he and Draco generally dumped their pockets when they came in the door. Draco's mobile lay on top of his wallet. Harry picked it up and looked at it, lying in his palm.
"Same here.” Harry looked at him again. "I'm sorry to stare, but you remind me of someone. I'm not sure what it is about you, but you do."
"Sir, some people just can't get it up." The clerk could have been reciting Keats. "Again, if that is your situation, we do have specialists that can aid you in your quest for release."
Harry arose at half four, after a genuinely lovely nap. He freshened up, changed his shirt, realized his underwear was still disreputable, and solved the issue neatly by going commando – with any luck, he wouldn't be wearing pants soon anyway.
With some creative cussing, an obscene gesture or two, Harry figured out how to download the songs and listen to them on his laptop, and once he heard that voice, he forgot about the telly, the crackers, the cigarettes – but not the scotch. Not even Milo's voice wafting from the speakers was enough to make him forgo his Dewar's.
A round moon face, made even odder-looking by thick-lensed glasses peered out of the tent flap. "Always in motion, is the future, and even the wisest cannot tell. Also, you have frosting hanging out of your nose."
Harry ran his comb through his hair one last time; it was almost behaving, but not quite. He gave up and shook his head till it was its Hogwarts-era unruly self again and called it good.
Besides, it looked like he himself might be busy with a certain redhead – strawberry blond, rather – member of the Winged Weasleys whom had pleasantly surprised him, being more competent than he had thought. Nowhere near he and Draco, mind, but not bad.
The old whore had apparently decided that ripped stockings were not deal-breaker, as she had the same pair on as the night before. In fact, the entire outfit was the same, and sniffing her, Harry suspected that she'd not moved from this spot since their conversation yesterday.
"You choose to fixate on the oddest things, Malfoy, seriously." Nevertheless, Harry arched his head into Draco's hand, encouraging him to pet him; Draco smirked and twisted his fingers into it, then yawned.
Draco nodded back and made his way back to the loo, shutting himself in a stall and trying to control himself.
When the light finally came back on, Harry had dozed off on the pavement in front of her window, and the older whore had threatened two muggers and a pickpocket with an STD that would cause their cock to rot off if they touched him; she had grown rather fond of Harry.
"All right, settle down," he called, adjusting his glasses on his nose and setting the bag down beside him as he stood in front of the crowd.
"Not really. It's a stress-free life, and after the rather tumultuous adolescence I had, stress-free sounds pretty damn good to me. And you haven't answered my question, either. How did such a Muggle-hater wind up fronting a band full of them and being worshiped by thousands more?"
Ginny glanced at me then looked down before she replied and said “Yes Neville, I would love to, let's go!” She stood up and took a hold of Nevilles hand catching him off guard, but he was definitely pleased.
I started walking around, not really sure where I was heading I just knew I needed space. I had hurt one of my best friends, got beaten up by another, and still haven’t  had a moment alone with Draco.
I followed Ron and Ginny through the corridors but the hidden passageway they found was one the Marauders had discovered and was caved in. I was now more irritable.
We sat in silence for a bit while we each worked on our respective lessons. I was revising my potions essay, though I knew no matter what I did Snape would be displeased.
“I’ll stay behind and help you,” Hermione chimed in, taking some of the pressure off of me. “We all know you’ll need my advice and for me to read over them, and I’d like to have it done before midnight, Prefect duties are exhausting me you know.” She said with a smirk as she squeezed my hand under the table.
I slept for a few hours. When I woke up I saw Hermione sitting in the corner, Luna holding her in her arms. Someone was holding my hand but I couldn’t figure out who it was until he spoke.
I stood in Dumbledore’s office, I had completely trashed the place. Sirius was gone. I had nothing left. I felt nothing but anger and rage. I needed vengeance. Dumbledore entered his office, taking note of the damage I had caused. I didn’t hear or process a word he had said to me. Before I knew it I was being shuffled into the infirmary and Madam Pomfrey was giving me a dreamless sleeping draught. I chugged it and crawled into bed. I wanted to forget everything.
I turned and walked the other way. I headed for the courtyard. As I stepped outside of the school I immediately saw a group of Slytherins.  I started to turn to walk away when I heard
I went back to the common room, my head spinning, he was so close, we were so close, there were no snide comments, no attempting to kill each other. But he was gone before I could say anything, or do anything besides stare at his gorgeous gray eyes.
The spot Luna picked was perfect. We were under an oak tree that had a great view of the giant squid and the forbidden forest.
“I was thinking of staying here and catching up on Homework, with quidditch and Umbridge on my tail, I have been slacking off,” I said.
He walked up to me, and kissed me passionately in front of everyone. As we kissed I felt all my broken pieces start to glue back together.
I was sitting on my favorite chair by the fireplace staring at my charms book when Ginny and Neville walked in, still holding hands and looking rather cozy.
Just then Neville walked in, “Oh uh hi Ginny, I um...I was wondering if you’d like to go to Hogsmeade with me today?” he said stuttering, as he finished he held his breath waiting for a response.
I got out of bed— put on clothes, then slowly made my way down to breakfast. I took my normal seat between Ron and Hermione, Ginny sat across from me and kept glancing at me and blushing. I knew I had to tell her I didn’t feel the same. I had to tell her that my heart and soul were both spoken for, even if the person they belonged to never felt the same.
Yet here I was staring at the boy who had tortured my being since we met in Diagon alley. I was in love with him,
When I came out of my zone, I noticed that it was dark, and storming, I was soaked in sweat and from the rain. I landed back on the pitch. Hermione was standing inside the locker room. I walked over to her as she handed me a warm towel.
I turned to see Draco standing just inches from me. He slid his hand in mine for just a moment. I felt sparks shoot through my body. We locked eyes for a minute until we heard Crabbe and Goyle starting to descend the hill. Draco let go of my hand and sprinted away from me before they could see us together.
I started to walk back to the castle when my scar felt like it was going to burst open. I fell to my knees as I entered Voldemort's mind. There was Sirius and he was being tortured. They were in the department of mysteries and I had to get there. I had to save him.
I was picking up speed, flying faster than I ever flew. I started doing dives and loop - de - loops.
I sighed and started to walk down the hill. She was right, I needed to tell him. What’s the worst that could happen?
I don’t know how long it was before Fred and George pulled him off of me. I was pretty bloody and bruised, I grabbed my bag and walked out of the common room.
I had to have you on his wall. You’re his family too,” he said, taking the photograph from Malfoy’s hands and hanging it up on the wall. It sat between a picture of Andromeda beaming at the camera with a newborn Teddy in her arms and one of Teddy with gold face paint, on Harry’s shoulders at a Quidditch game.
He opened his mouth to speak, but before he could even think to panic about what he should say, Ron was already out of his chair, murmuring an
Potter snickered and put down the box he was carrying to take the container from Draco. “Sorry ‘bout that.” He looked down at the container. “This is a bit heavy. This feels like too much food.”
Harry’s hands were still fidgeting, and he could still feel the dread at the pit of his stomach. But this was normal. This was manageable. “A bit, yeah.”
They sat there, not saying anything for a few minutes. Harry traced the wood grain pattern of the kitchen table, hyperaware of the relentless thrumming of his nerves. Hermione had gotten her book back from him, but it just laid open before her. He knew she was stealing apprehensive glances at him every seven seconds.
Most of the pictures he had seen of his parents together were from after he was born. They looked barely seventeen in this photo and were wearing their Hogwarts robes. Harry liked the thought of them being another typical, nauseating pair of lovesick kids in school.
The lift doors opened again, revealing a group of Ministry workers waiting outside. He felt uncomfortable as he noticed many of their faces light up at the sight of him.
“I don’t know why you’re freaking out about this again, though,” she mumbled. Draco was staring at the ceiling, but he could tell she was turning to face her mirror again from the rustling of her dress. “Didn’t you already have this epiphany and fucked some random bloke the other night because of it?”
Harry laughed. “Er, no. I just need a potted plant that says ‘I’m Sorry for a Being a Bad Friend I’ll Try to Make Things Better and Besides I’m a Good Enough Friend to Notice That The Potted Plant On Your Coffee Table Has Been Dead for Three Weeks So Please Forgive Me.’”
“It’s called grief, sweetheart,” Andromeda had told him matter-of-factly. “You’re finally letting yourself mourn.”
“What about it?” It came out in a snap, and he immediately felt guilty. But it didn’t seem to faze her.
“Thanks.” Draco could feel a flurry in his chest that he didn’t quite understand at the moment. “Still, though. I can’t really blame everyone for still hating me.”
But Harry figured that was too much. And too real. And that it wasn’t even something he’d say aloud to himself. So, instead, he rolled his eyes, and said, “Sort of.”
Draco chuckled nervously. “Of course… Er, have you written McGonagall like I told you?” he asked, desperate to change the subject.
Their friendship was new and strange. He was his nephew’s godfather. Fancying him sounded like too much trouble for Draco.
Harry laughed as Astoria was roped into describing every dragon she saw during her visits to her sister.
“Claws,” he repeated as if he didn’t understand what Draco could possibly be confused about. “He still can’t control his powers. Stuff like that happens every few months or so and goes away fairly quickly. Feeding him that night he had fangs for an hour was a bloody nightmare.”
Harry closed his eyes, resting them a bit, as he laid his head on one of Teddy’s pillows. “Next time, Teddy. To be honest, I thought your Uncle Draco had told you already. He likes telling you about how much I got in trouble, doesn’t he?” he said, chuckling.
Draco just realized then that Potter wasn’t wearing his glasses. He always forgot how much more vivid the green in his eyes looked when he didn’t have them on. Draco flashed him a quick smile before forcing his attention back to the paste he was applying. “You’re welcome.”
“So, I figured that hiding from the world was the only way to not feel that pressure. But getting to know him just...proved me wrong. Showed me we could still live lives outside these roles forced on us and outside all that tragedy and loss without shutting everyone out…”
Walking to lift, he spotted Draco Malfoy waiting by it. He considered just turning back, but Malfoy spun around and noticed him before he could decide to. Figuring it was too late, he kept walking towards him.
Ignoring Malfoy’s comment, he grabbed the receipt from Malfoy’s hand before tossing it in the dustbin.
“Oh…” Malfoy picked up a scarf from a pile and started to play with the tassels, looking unsure of what to do. “Well… Yeah. I am.”
“You’re friends with that girl who does administrative work for the Wizengamot, right?” Harry asked.
“Come on, Malfoy. Let’s go see if your nephew is already high on all that sugar you just offered him.”
Draco got up and walked over to open it. There were different labelled vials and jars filled with various liquids, powders, and gels sitting on the shelves. After going through a few, he settled for a jar of paste-like substance that he used at the hospital for injuries like this.
Harry settled his sleeping godson onto the couch and covered him with a blanket before responding to Ginny. Andromeda had left him with Harry at Grimmauld Place earlier that day. Harry had been spending time with him every couple of days since he quit. He was the only one he couldn’t bear to stay away from.
Draco is having A Crisis about a certain crush that was definitely more complicated than all the ones he has had before. Harry feels strange about his new friendship with Draco, but slowly realizes it's actually what he needs to take the baby steps towards healing.
“Potter isn’t even sure he’s going to try for the job next year,” Draco said, feeling the burn in his cheeks as he returned his attention to the potion he was starting. “And even if he was, he is
Shrugging, she looked back and forth between the boys. “I mean, we were already okay. We just haven’t really been actually talking about this.”
Harry rediscovers his love for magic. Draco rediscovers his fear of accepting things he's always wanted. They both get help about it.
Harry stood there for a few moments, making peace with the quiet and the fact that there was no one there to answer. Then, he walked to the door.
Harry winced, remembering that Narcissa must have practically grown up here with her being cousins with Sirius. “W-what? No. That’s not what I meant. I- I just mean that-”
“I can still smell the food we made...That and the awfully strong cologne you’re wearing that gives away how pretentious you are.”
Harry nodded, his eyes lingering on Malfoy’s exposed collarbone for a beat too long. “Why aren’t you just using magic?”
Harry walked over to the kitchen table, grabbing a biscuit from an opened tin next to two empty wine glasses. “Remind me to make you wash my dishes whenever you’re over,” Harry said before popping the biscuit into his mouth.
Draco froze halfway into bringing a forkful of pasta to his mouth again. He put it down, keeping his eyes on his plate. “Oh, you know, I just...didn’t realize how tired I was.”
“She wouldn’t just take any teacher who’s willing to stay either. Not like she’d be settling for you,” Malfoy added. “The lot you were teaching - the D.A., right? - held their own so well during the battle because of you. You completed the Auror program. And that’s not mentioning that you saved the wizarding world. Trust me, Potter, if you ask she’ll give that position to you.”
Harry sighed and closed the door before jogging down the stairs and into his study. He sat at his desk, fumbling with Ron’s letter again. It was late, and he needed to be up early for work tomorrow morning, but he couldn’t help it.
Harry felt exposed by how much he was saying. But it also felt good to be really letting them in this time. So, he lets himself continue.
Harry dropped the pictures he had in his hands as he felt his skin grow cold. Not a lot of people knew or noticed. Just Andromeda, Ron, and Hermione. “What? No, I…”
Probably sensing the confusion raging in Harry’s head, Andromeda sighed. “Look, Harry. Every one of us who grew up with those kinds of parents are the same. Me, Sirius, Regulus… Draco… We were all just little kids who were physically and emotionally abused until we were completely brainwashed to hate Muggle-borns. And that isn’t acceptable, of course. That’s why I’m finding it hard to completely make amends with my sister. She was complicit in all those crimes despite being an adult who was expected to think for herself.
“Me too, kid,” Draco said, opening his arms. Teddy instantly jumped onto Draco’s chest, hugging him. Draco squeezed him back.  Draco hadn’t seen Teddy for a couple of weeks and was only starting to realize now how much he had missed the kid.
From where she was curled up on the sofa, she started kicking him lightly. “I’ve caught you and Ginny making out in every room of this house, so you’re not one to talk!”
“You aren’t being hypocritical,” Jasmine assured. “After going through traumatic events like loss, distancing yourself from people who were there to witness you at your lowest is completely normal.”
“I get that sometimes,” Draco offered. Did it sound helpful? Draco didn’t know how to do this. It came naturally to him with patients at the hospital. But sitting in the dark with Harry Potter was not his territory.
Teddy scrunched up his face. “I don’t know yet... But I still have lots of blocks! And I want to make a second castle! Will you help me?”
“And I don’t know about the specifics of what you’re talking about… But holding yourself accountable for your mistakes and vowing not to repeat them doesn’t mean you have to torture yourself with them” Draco said. “No one can heal that way.”
“Just need to fill the walls with pictures and the wardrobe with his clothes…” Potter said, taking a swig from his bottle. “Oh, and toys and books…”
Draco didn’t know why he was telling him all this, but he remained quiet, waiting for him to speak again. He watched Potter’s eyes fixating on the shard, which was still lying on the step below them.
It felt like there was just an unspoken agreement hanging in the air between them to just keep doing what they were doing, to keep seeing each other as much as they had been. Harry wasn’t about to complain.
He had actively avoided thinking about Malfoy in those 20 minutes. And avoided trying to figure out why he was feeling irritated. So, by the time he saw Malfoy reach the fourth floor where Harry was sitting cross-legged in front of Teddy’s room and fidgeting with the mirror in his pocket, he had mostly convinced himself that he was overthinking it. Mostly.
“It’s fine.” Potter put his hands over his shoulders to grab the back of his shirt before pulling it off. “I wanted to change before working on the room again anyway.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “My first day of work, he apologized to me for, you know, being a racist prick to me for seven bloody years. Of course, I just told him to leave me alone, but...Well, he sort of started to really show up whenever I needed him to in the few months we worked together at the Ministry.”
Ron no longer looked angry. His expression was mostly blank, but Harry caught the look in his eye. He knew Ron was back to just being worried again, pushing all that bitterness down. Harry tried not to drown in the guilt of it too much before he’d even be able to speak. Which was hard.
Draco spun around too fast for his liking, stumbling a little. He hoped Potter didn’t notice. “Yeah?”
Ignoring his protests, Harry added, "You never told me, by the way. About how much you've been helping Hermione."
“Oh, Merlin, no. There was just a dragon pox outbreak in a nearby town that week,” he replied before sipping at his drink and looking Potter in the eye as he relaxed. “I usually don’t even have to work the full eight hours most days because I’m technically just the Potions apprentice. I just stay a little longer if there’s anything the kids’ need.”
“Yes,” Malfoy replied almost immediately. “People are still wary about the teaching post. So, they’ve just been getting retired Aurors to teach the subject every other year or so. McGonagall wants someone who actually really wants to teach, though, you know? Someone who can stay for a long time and really get to know the students. That could be you.”
“And, now, well... He’s sort of my contact at St. Mungos for the policies we’ve been drafting for Muggle-born healthcare. A lot of our official partner Healers are Pureblood higher-ups that never interact with patients. So, I reached out to Draco. We barely talk, really, but he gives me the info I need whenever I ask... All his notes from working with the kids and their families, lists of nurses who actually got to know patients, contact details of Muggle-born Healers who had the time to help us out…”
“Is that why you’ve kept me around for this long?” Malfoy asked, chuckling and walking over to sit on the bed.
“Of course it doesn’t mean that,” he said, with a reassuring tone in his voice that sounded so foreign to Harry. “Death is just… It’s strange that way. We’re people, and we’re conditioned to feel sad when it happens. Because it’s still a loss, isn’t it? For many people, it’s because they lost a loved one or a hero. But sometimes it happens to people we hate too. Maybe because we feel a different loss.”
“That’s great, dear,” she cooed. “I didn’t catch you this morning. Did you fall asleep studying your books at Astoria’s again?”
Hermione shrugged it off. “And I forgive you. I know Ron does too. But...Ron was devastated all those months, but I don’t think he ever allowed himself to feel the anger too. He hates being angry with you...So, when Draco said…”
He walked up to the building, glancing at his watch between strides as if that would make him any less late. Just as he was about to jog up the stairs leading up to the entrance, he looked up and noticed Harry Potter sitting on the topmost step.
Draco snorted. “Fair.” He tried, but he couldn’t look away from him. Their faces were so close, and his hand was still massaging the paste onto Potter’s upper arm. It was too much, but he couldn’t stop.
Astoria, who was sitting on the other side of the brewing table Draco was working on, shrieked in joy and threw her arms up. “
He was trying to listen to Ron, but he couldn’t hear anything clearly but the sound of his rapid breathing as he stared at the floor. They were sitting on a bench outside the training room, and Harry couldn’t bring himself to go back in to redo his turn.
“You’re not usually a people person. Astoria’s your best friend, and you don’t spend nearly as much time with
...” Harry added in a singsong manner. “And I think you two could work so much better if you two were friends....”
Harry couldn’t help but snort, earning him a trademark Draco Malfoy sneer. “I can’t imagine you liking that.”
“What part of what I’m saying isn’t fair? You could barely even look him in the eye when we worked on the same floor as him. Suddenly, what, you’re best mates?”
If Harry had not grown more attuned to the little tells, Malfoy’s discomfort would have been hard to notice. But Harry did know him well enough by now and caught every slight tremble of the lip before a fake smile and subtle way his hands shook every now and then.
Draco looked around Andromeda’s house as he hung up his coat. He’d been here many times before, but it suddenly felt different with Potter there.
When he reached the source of the sound, an open room, Draco could swear he was going to die right then and there.
“A couple of days ago, after you…” Harry trailed off, gesturing vaguely to the arm Malfoy had healed. He cleared his throat. “You and Teddy fell asleep on the couch watching cartoons after dinner, remember?”
Potter followed and closed the door behind him. He took off his coat and hung it on the rack by the door. “I’ll just go check if Teddy’s asleep first before getting us something to drink.”
He made his voice cold, thick with hurt though it was. "No. And if you're never going to fucking let this go, Harry, then why come home at all? For more barbs? More snide comments? You must have had time to think up new ones; I'm surprised you haven't owled me with them, or are you saving them up to welcome me home with?" Inside his stomach twisted and he felt sick.
"So, today is the big day," said Pansy, eyeing Draco as they sat on the black leather couch in his private office. He nodded; his stomach was full of butterflies and he thought he'd probably gone to the loo seven times in the last hour alone. "I suppose asking you how you feel would be rather stupid of me."
Draco was sitting this one out; he still thought Potter was insane, but if his theory was correct, then he would be targeted again tonight and after having all his possessions torched and being nearly crushed to death in the past two weeks alone, he was at least willing to listen to whatever hair-brained scheme the other boy came up with - within reason. Even if it meant dressing Harry up as him, complete with casually disheveled blond wig, no glasses, and a suit so tight that everyone could tell Potter's religion. And even better? He hadn't bothered to tell Lucius about the substitution. After catching his father in flagrante delicto with a bloody
She looked at him oddly, since it was October, but then spotted a friend and moved over to speak with her, turning to point at Harry and roll her eyes. That type of reaction, at least, Harry was used to.
Harry sighed "Maybe a little of both? We all deserve a second chance, I guess, and although this isn't a life I think he would have chosen, he seems content enough." Harry rubbed the back of his neck. "I took pictures," he added. "Pictures of her, of him, to find out why I was off, to figure out why I felt something I couldn't explain. Now I know. I know where I saw that smile, all those years ago. The one time I ever saw a real smile from him, that day in the robe shop."
Black Camelot was playing tonight at Underworld, and he had a front row seat, although he'd been advised by the nice woman on the phone that the area in front of the seats would most likely become a sort of mosh pit. Harry didn't care, and was prepared to slam with the best of them. All he cared about was seeing Milo, as up close and personal as possible.
"For now." The clerk handed him his key. "We do try and present a distinctly Muggle façade, so if you'd keep the Apparating, spell casting, charming, hexing, cursing or Unforgivables to a minimum, Management would appreciate it."
No. No, he couldn't think like that. He and Aaron had talked a lot - he really was remarkably similar to Draco, or how Draco would be if he was more open, less guarded, more available. He was like Draco 4.0. He mentally rolled his eyes at his own innate idiocy.
"Your opinion is noted, Hagrid," Dumbledore answered, craning his neck to see over the Three-Horned Man. Each horn played a range of notes and all three formed a harmony that was rather pleasant overall. "But I trust that you have worked your considerable magic and soothed the savage breast, as it were."
"I just wander around, usually," Harry replied, fighting back images of Draco in spandex. "I like to check in on people, see what's new, hear the gossip, see what's new with the animals. I keep busy."
"Harry, love, Draco's path was set from the moment he was born to those hideous parents of his. Your taking his hand like this, or not, didn't make him what he was. Similarly, saying no that first night is not going to set his life down a path to destruction. Honey, you may be the Boy Who Lived, but you're not the Almighty. Draco got a second chance, and now it's all up to him. In his life, Harry Potter doesn't exist."
“Well, maybe if you didn’t keep injuring yourself…” He couldn’t help it. As he spread the paste down Potter’s arms, he met his gaze again. Potter was smiling at him, eyes bright and crinkled at the corners.
“We see enough of each other at work.” Which was right, but he knew his mother had a point. He’d seen Potter five times this week. In between pretending that they were going to work on Teddy’s room and going to support group meetings together, they haven’t really been apart that much since the first time he came over.
The oven timer went off, and his friends stopped rambling. Ron got up. “Finally! I’ll go set the table and prepare the food.”
“I did an extra shift at the hospital.” Malfoy looked like he was trying to act composed, standing straight and his expression indifferent. Would have succeeded too if he didn’t go red as soon as Harry said anything.
As he sat in his study and finished penning a reply to Malfoy’s letter, he found that he was actually looking forward to hanging out with him again. He didn’t know what had compelled him to invite him over. Harry hasn’t had anyone over other than Andromeda for a while.
Teddy gasped as he looked up and noticed Draco in the doorway, hopping off his godfather. “UNCLE DWACO!”
“I love how everyone hates the bike but is somehow alright with the idea that I was on a broom, a hundred feet off the ground, at eleven years old.”
“Yeah, yeah,” waving her hand in dismissal of Draco’s attempt to be modest. “I just forget how advanced the things you deal with are. I mean, the older trainee Healers told me your apprenticeship was supposed to just involve following a bunch of instructions from pages Healers tell you to look up. And you’re here creating your own potions and improving the ones they’ve been using for years. That’s bloody impressive.”
“Well, there you go,” the man said. “When my wife died, I isolated everyone in my life. Then I met a friend in a group like this one who helped me process all those feelings of grief and trauma. It eventually helped me let my walls down again... So, you’re not being hypocritical. Your instincts are just leading you to people who can best help you heal at the moment. Whether you know it or not, you’re choosing to form bonds with people who can change you for the better and help you get ready to make space for the people you’ve been meaning to let into your life again.”
