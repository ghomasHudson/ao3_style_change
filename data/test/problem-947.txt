“And yet, that’s exactly what you did” he say hardly “what did you expect would happen? That I would laugh about it and tell the story to my grand-children?”
“You did always have a flair for the dramatic”
“Well, it goes like this…”
“Yes” answered the pale blond evenly. “Over here, in the Kitchen”
, he told himself. His stare snapped back to the next target of his ministrations. Harry’s shaft was tensed and fully erect, twitching desperately for attention. A few drops of precome had dripped from the tip and crowned it with pearly beads. Draco got closer, feathering the throbbing flesh with his breath. Harry’s whole body tensed and he involuntarily clenched his fists. With a wolfish smile, the Slytherin started brushing the hot shaft with his tongue, caressing the inside of Harry’s thighs and letting Harry’s spicy taste roll on his tongue. A stifled, desperate sound came from the ex-Auror’s gritted teeth. Draco suddenly engulfed him in a wet-hot mouth, revelling in the soft skin sliding inside effortlessly and the strangled cries the young man above him was letting out. Harry was clutching the wooden pillar of his bed in a death grip, hanging on for dear life.
“Sorry” said Harry sheepishly, all anger turning in a black simmering pool in the pit of his stomach.
“Ok, I’ll leave the subject of your torrid affair out of our little chats from now on, I wouldn’t want to rub salt in your tragic wounds”
The spiky-haired Auror appeared a minute later, stricken and sullied by what looked like ash.
Draco delicately brushed the wound with his pale index, trying to be as gentle as possible. But Harry was obviously very used to it, he didn’t even flinch. The only sign of suffering was the erratic and occasional twitch of his chest and upper arms muscles.
“… I played for the team?” provided Malfoy snarkily. “Well, I didn’t think you would know. Strangely enough, I try to keep this kind of information private.”
“Yes, I did… I’m not particularly proud of it” he added quickly, shooting a side tentative look at Hermione. “But I’ll admit it felt brilliant” he scoffed. Hermione hid her smile in her pint, her brows creased in a half-hearted stern demonstration.
Harry didn’t answer, wand at the ready, not buying this affable masquerade. Something was off, he could feel it in his guts. Then all thoughts melted away in horror at the sight of Draco pinned to the wall, unconscious, covered in blood and indescribable wounds. His stomach churned as bile burnt the back of is throat.
He finally found his wand on the floor, near the door. It must have rolled off the bed. Then he saw the hole in the wall outside the bedroom and everything came back at once.
“It’s alright. It’s not an easy position to be in, and believe me, I can relate.”
Draco knew only very few Dark Wizards were able to cast the spell as you needed some good in you to project the pure energy to repel evil. In his quest to redeem himself, discovering that there was indeed some good left in him was like a ray of light in a storm: rare and precious.
A sated silence filled with the cracks of the burning wood stretched for a few moments.
“Believe me, it’s not that bad. I’m okay.” he said stubbornly while rubbing the old scar on his hand ‘
“There you are!” she exclaimed happily. “I tried to ask Algernon where you two went but I think I need to work on my Parseltongue.”
Impulsively, he took the pale fist in his hand and Malfoy froze. His skin was soft and cold, Harry squeezed the cold flesh sympathetically and placed their linked hands on the ground between them. His thumb was rubbing soothing circles on the back of his hand distractedly.
“Yeah…” “You know… I’m starting to wonder if it’s as personal as Catesby’s letting on…”
Hermione sighed and laid back in her chair.
“My turn” he says simply and finishes to undress himself. Harry’s eyes map his body with unabashed want. But his face darkens when they fixate on the diagonal scar that goes from throat to hip. Draco remembers when Jean flinched at the sight last time. He had attributed it to horror, he was used to it, but now he understands better the afflicted look on her face.
“Waow. Okay. That was unexpected.” He paused. “Now that I think about it… I did get some very disturbing dreams a couple of times…”
He grinned again with his large, self-satisifed grin and that was the exact moment Harry lost it. He knew. The bastard knew what Malfoy was up to. And it was obvious he was delighted to brush off the accusations without even pretending he didn’t care about any of it.
Sándor chuckled and shook his head.
Suddenly, Malfoy shifted and the Gryffindor felt his warm weight on his thighs. The blond was straddling him and the thought made his cock twitch. He realized he was already hard, painfully so, the hard length strained against the rough fabric of his jeans.
“Don’t move” ordered the pale blond, entirely focussed on how to proceed. Harry nodded and let his head fall back to give him a better access. He was slightly trembling, probably due to exhaustion and blood loss.
“Yes?” the blond tenses.
Having made a decision grounds him somehow though. He cancels the spells concealing his eyes and scar, goes back to the bedroom and transfigures his clothes back to their original state. It’s lucky he wasn’t wearing Hermione’s clothes last night.
“Mr Potter, I’m begging you now, please save Draco. You already saved my life and I know I cannot ask more but I’ll do anything you want” she begged him and the desperate plea in her blue eyes wrenched at Harry’s guts.
“You want more, Draco?” he rasped.
“Well, he did look pretty mad at you…” agreed Hermione carefully.
“Draco, it’s not what I meant, you’re so-” but Harry couldn’t find what Draco was and he let out a frustrated grunt. “You stay here, I’ll go”
“Well, you were the one who gave me the idea, actually. And I had the foolishness of mentioning it in front of Hermione. It took some convincing from her but one does not say no to that woman indefinitely. She seems hell-bent in making something out of me” he joked but his tentative at lightening the mood was met by nothing but a polite tight smile from Harry.
“ ‘Okay’?” Draco scrunches is nose at the word “Yeah, you could say that I suppose” Draco laughs lightly.
, he mused while thoughtfully eating the rest of his sandwich. He caught an exchange of worried glances between the freckled redhead and the bushy brunette and pretended to be absorbed in a hospital leaflet about Dragon pox.
“So, what you’re telling me is that Draco Malfoy is currently residing in his family home and his life threatened by his own father? Have you gone mad, Auror Potter?” smirked Catesby, obviously loving it.
“I’m not so sure about that…”
“Go ahead, I didn’t have much hope left about it.”
“Molly made it for you” she said maliciously and Draco almost choked on his second bite. He coughed and hiccupped until Ron magically appeared in his sight and dislodged the offending parcel of food for his throat with vigorous and over enthusiastic claps on the back.
“But at least he was actually good at teaching! After all he had first-hand knowledge about the Dark Arts, you have to give him that…” answered Draco with an amused smirk, his arms crossed. Harry knew he was winding him up on purpose but he couldn’t resist.
“But it would be different, now! No more Catesby! No more stupid shift and teapot cases!” he paused and seemed to realize something “It weirds you out, doesn’t it?”
In a fluid and sneaky move, he rolled the blond on his back and slipped inside his parted legs. Harry shut up the scandalised Slytherin with a dirty, messy kiss.
A faint sound reached his ears.
“Nothing per se, Malfoys don’t get their hands dirty in this trivial manner. I undoubtedly enjoyed the show, though” answered the pale man, his long white-hair glowing gold with the light cast by the eight fires.
“I couldn’t stop thinking about you fucking me” Potter says roughly, and the Slytherin’s breath hitches. Potter, having finally managed to unbutton his robes, now turns his attention on his belt.
Harry stood there, panting and quivering under the hot water, steam swirling all around him. He let his head meet the hard surface in front of him with a loud thump, resting his forehead on the tepid tiles. Harry sighed and a wave of despair mixed with panic surged inside him. He watched all traces of his shameful release disappear down the drain and felt sick, sullied, twisted. What was he thinking? How would Draco feel if he knew?
*       *       *
But now, the phone was part of another pleasant ritual between him and a certain Slytherin who had the gift of contacting him on the worst possible timing. Like right now for instance.
Draco didn’t reply, his throat constricted by raw emotion. With a sympathetic pressure on his shoulder, Harry let him sort his thoughts and got back to the kitchen. Draco listened to the sound of his deep reassuring voice purring pleasantly with Luna’s in the other room, trying to reconcile himself with the idea he now seemed to have… friends.
With a reassuring squeeze of the hand and a tight smile for his mother, he followed the messy-haired wizard.
“Still, I don’t picture you in Ravenclaw, you’re a bit of an incarnation of chaos if I’m being honest” he teases gently and smirks.
“Erm… Yes, thanks” he rose a doubtful gaze to her than looked at Ron who was deeply absorbed in the examination of his wand.
*       *       *
“Of for Merlin’s sake please tell him to stop. After that fiasco, I think what I need is a break from dating right now.”
“Tell me how to get to him” said the young Auror, fire in his eyes.
“The way his father treated him. His
“Harry….”
“Do you want me?” asked the pale blond in a breath. His eyes were liquid silver and more alive than Harry had ever seen them.
. “…already am. I’ve been there for a long time. Years actually.”
“You don’t have to prepare for anything. I won’t change my mind just because it gets complicated. You have my word.”
“Stop giving me orders, I’m not one of your brainless lovesick groupies, Golden Boy” he stepped in the room defiantly, provocation flashing in the silver irises.
“I don’t care, don’t you understand? It’s my mother and she’s in danger because of me! I can’t let her like that! But you can’t understand that, can you?” the cruel tone sliced through Harry like a hot blade and hurt registered for a second on his face. But a cold expression quickly replaced it, his stare was iron steel, dangerous. For a fraction of second, Draco thought he was going to punch him.
Hermione doesn’t answer but her rosy cheeks are enough. Ron, in a rare and unsettling physical display of sympathy, hugs him and Harry knows in this very instant that he is indeed utterly doomed.
“I love you, my son, more than anything in the world. And I’m proud of you. I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you from him.”
Draco’s face drains from all colour, hurt paints his features and his eyes shut tightly. When he opens them again, they are hollow, empty. It’s like seeing him slip in the void inside and Harry wants to die on the spot for what he did to him.
“May I come in?” asked the blond warily. The ex-Auror just shrugged and let the door open behind him. He stepped in the kitchen and put the kettle on the fire, then proceeded to remove his gloves, scarf and coat. He nonchalantly tossed the lot on a chair, revealing a tattered Quidditch outfit. Draco was standing in the room, nonplussed with this detached and quiet Harry.
“Harry…” started Draco but the dark-haired man cut him off.
Since they had amicably decided that getting back together would be a very bad idea after the War, he had nearly had a heart attack, then quickly body-bound the girl and questioned her. He is an Auror after all.
“Sirius… no, please…” Harry whimpered lowly. Sudden quivers agitated his body and his face constricted in pain. His breathing hitched and went frantic.
Yeah, Harry could see that going just perfectly well.
Both scared and curious, the pale blond crept out of the room and down the huge stairs of the house. He finally heard a clanking noise and someone… hissing? It came from a door on the left that was opened. Draco took a careful peak inside and his heart missed a beat.
“I… I fucked up. Extensively. I was worried about my mother and he wouldn’t let me go so I… tricked him…” he trailed off. “And now he probably wants me dead” he added darkly.
“Actually, that’s a good plan” said Harry, still panting “I think you would make a good load of money” He laughed and took a street accent “A pretty and expensive thing like yeh, yeh would make millions!”
Harry was half-convinced he had lost consciousness for a moment when he realized Malfoy was gingerly caressing his bare back, brushing the nape of his neck and delicately carding his fingers in the jet-black hair.
“Come on, move.”
“That doesn’t sound right” said Luna thoughtfully, sharing a long look with Hermione.
The tall blond drew out a dusty old bottle and uncorked it unceremoniously with his teeth, tossing the cork with a shake of his head making his hair glint siler before gulping down the amber liquid desperately. Harry could see his Adam apple bobbing up and down rapidly, the white skin glowing under the moonlight seeping through the tiny window.
, Harry had forgotten four-pints-Ron is chatty-Ron. It’s still better than six-pints-Ron, though. Harry shudders at the memory of a sappy Ron crying on his shoulder and telling Harry insistently how much he loves him and “Harmyionnne” in long, inflamed speeches with unnecessary and highly disturbing metaphors.
“That was just amazing” he sighed contentedly.
“Exceptionally well, actually” smiled Harry “Hadn’t sleep that well in months! Maybe I should give up the bed and just sleep on that couch” he mused.
“Hum, I… was attacked by a guy. He was running an underground network of trafficked potions and drugs. We went in with a team. I got isolated running after the guy. We fought. Unregistered Animagus, turns out. I thought I had him, next thing I know, I was wrestling with a lynx. I neutralized him quickly enough but not before earning this pretty souvenir from our little friend.”
“Luna’s the one who gave
*       *       *
The Hungarian were good, skilled and obviously trained for combat but the combination of surprise with the well-coordinated group slowly took over and they started to retreat.
“Hum… Promise me not to freak out, okay?” he pleaded. Ron and Hermione looked at him with obvious puzzlement.
Draco let go of his shaft, gripping the Auror’s hips and with a grunt, he started to thrust inside the hot channel, faster and harder at every back and forth. Harry was reduced to a hot, whimpering mess, an incoherent jumble of obscene words tumbling from his mouth in a rapid pace, urging Draco to go deeper, faster, harder, now, pleading, begging, hanging on the sofa with whitened knuckles.
, Draco kept telling himself. It was a perfectly natural reaction to be turned on by an attractive half-naked sweaty man, and there was nothing more to it. After all, he was only human and the close proximity plus the fact that Harry was the only man he had seen for the past weeks probably explained his dreams. Not to mention how fit the git had gotten since school. Back at Hogwarts, he hadn’t exactly been hard on the eyes either but this was something else. Draco shook himself,
She hugged the trembling blond and whispered in his ear “
“Who is it, then?”
“I don’t remember you or your name, so you were definitely not in Slytherin, though you’re certainly cunning enough for that”
“Draco?” said Harry with a hesitant voice. “Draco? Are you there?”
Draco suddenly stopped and lifted the spell, the silvery glowing thread vanished and Harry whimpered with pleasure.
“I couldn’t, even if my life depended on it” Harry answered breathlessly. “Do you have any idea how hard I had to restrain myself not to jump you in a corridor all these weeks? I should get a medal for this...” His low voice was like grovel and went directly to Draco’s cock, which throbbed.
Once again, Draco seems to read his mood. He shuffles closer and takes him in his arms.
Since they didn’t see each other very often, Dudley had come up with this idea to remain in contact. At first, Harry had had a hard time learning how to use it but he had to admit it was quicker and simpler than owls. His cousin sent him efficient and concise texts from time to time to let him know what was new in his life -he had gotten married and his wife was expecting at the moment- and Harry made a point of always answering with what he could tell Dudley of his daily
Harry didn’t answer. He understood perfectly well what Draco felt. He suddenly felt ashamed of himself and hoped Draco’s mother wouldn’t suffer from his foolishness. The Auror knew she was the only one that had been there for the pale blond.
?” asked Draco “Is that what you called it?”
Unable to stop himself, he peeked discreetly at the scene. Harry was lazily spread on his belly, propped up on his elbows and holding the snake who listened attentively with his scaled head risen at eye-level. The fire cast dancing lights on is profile and made his glasses shine. The Auror was smiling affectionately and moving his lips slowly, giving out a nonchalant stream of modulated and entrancing hissing sounds.
“… this is why, keeping in mind the reputation and interests of the Bureau, I decided to assign you new partners so that you could share your experience and excellent results with others members of the force. To share the shine of glory, so to speak.” Catesby paused and an impish smile dripping with sarcasm stretched his lips.
“I know perfectly well that I’m not up to your aristocratic standards, you blue-blooded git!” teased Harry “And I think I’d look ridiculous in one of your usual outfits anyway”
Harry chuckled, embarrassed.
Then Draco’s hips lifted from the mattress with a throaty sound, silently begging him to move.
“Look Ron, I need a break from the job right now. I haven’t been happy for a long time doing it and it would be no good to just come back and pretend that I do.”
He hadn’t told Draco much about what happened with his boss but the fair-haired young man knew enough to fill in the blanks. Obviously, things weren’t all rosy between the Head Auror and the Chosen One. And it apparently resulted in ghastly double-triple shifts, overtime, and a lot of time spent at Ron and Hermione’s.
“You want me, inside you, Potter? Right now?” Draco teased him while his other hand seized the leaking cock.
Malfoy stood besides his mother, his silhouette like a dark shadow in the stone halls of the Wizengamot. His pale face and platinum hair contrasted wildly with the crisp and black three-pieces muggle suit he was wearing. His back was stiff and his jaw clenched, he was obviously ready for anything coming his way. Except for a confident Potter suddenly showing up and asking for a word in private. Bewilderment flashed in his flint-grey eyes for a second, mirroring the alarm in Narcissa’s pale blue irises.
“Fuck!” gasps Draco, slipping his hands in the unruly jet-black mane. Bloody Hell, who would’ve thought the Saviour of the Wizarding World would be this good at sucking cock? After an embarrassingly short amount of time, Draco exclaims:
When Draco entered the shabby pub, he scanned the room carefully, looking for anything suspicious, eyes narrowed. His heart missed a bit when icy-blue eyes locked with his. She was standing there, a few metres away from him, inconspicuously dressed in plain and old black robes, a dark shawl covering her head.
“No, I’m the one who should be sorry, this was highly unprofessional, my apologies” this impressive façade of his is back, only displaying a neutral apologetic expression and Harry wants to scream, because it’s the kind Malfoy wears with Potter every time they cross paths and this is wrong too. Because now Malfoy is Draco and Harry doesn’t want this cold-polite-not-really-there ersatz of the blond.
Harry nodded darkly.
“Potter, what are you doing here?” Draco asks again. Despite what he did to him and the seething anger (and the pain but Draco won’t admit it under Crucio) that has been burning inside him for weeks, Draco’s starting to worry. After all, the git’s sanity has always been questionable at best and with everything that happened since he was a teenager, he’s fairly entitled to flip the lid at any given moment. Shame it has to be on his office’s doorstep.
“Great!” answered Hermione, sounding considerably relieved. She led the way to a little Muggle pub nearby, constantly blabbing on about the weather, George’s last prank, how the pub was nice and cozy and everything else except from their last discussion. Ron and Harry followed in careful silence and avoided each other’s gazes.
But Malfoy just shakes his head with a light smile and holds his hand.
“We should go back” he said blankly, looking at the floor, his lips a thin line.
Later, Harry wakes up curled up on the armchair like a child. Someone covered him with a blanket and a fuzzy thing aches inside him at the thought. He cannot recall the last time he received this type of attention. When he looks around him, the wine still buzzing pleasantly in his head, his eyes fall on Draco. The blond is fast asleep on the armchair he transfigured in some kind of a comfortable looking chaise longue. His white hair is fanning around his head in a golden halo glowing with the dying lights from the fire, his patrician features more serene than Harry ever saw them. He’s lying on his side, one of his hands hanging over the edge of the piece of furniture in a loose and carefree position. His waistcoat is nowhere to be seen and the white shirt, now irrevocably wrinkled, hugs his lean frame and back muscles closely. The fuzzy things inside Harry’s chest melts, aches and tightens all at once in a painful yet warm sort of way.
“We’re not sure yet but it involves retaliation”
Ron and Harry shook their heads.
He falls on his knees between Draco’s parted legs and kisses him hard and messy. The fire catches in Draco who channels all the fear of those dreadful nights he spends waiting into it. The result is as violent and hungry as Fiendfyre.
“You did what???” exclaimed Draco, bewilderment painting his pure features.
“It’s complicated” he sighs “turns out it was actually never that simple to begin with, even back then” he says cryptically and smiles another of his fake smile Harry wants to wipe with… something he doesn’t want to think about right now. Draco’s expression turns mischievous and he adds:
“Yeah, you could say that.”
“Erm… It’s a long story. You probably know that I was raised by muggles. Well, they hated my parents, they hated magic and they hated me. I learned I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday and before that, I was kinda treated like their servant. I had to cook for them, clean, tidy, etc.”
“Draco” she murmured “Are you alright?”
“So, what did Healer McFinley say?” asked Hermione brightly, patting the chair beside her in the hideous cafeteria that smelled of lavender and looked as if it had been moulded in pastel-coloured plastic. The overall effect was weirdly soothing and Draco fell in the designated seat with a yawn.
“Yes! Yes! Oh, God yes” he exclaimed wantonly as he came, coating Harry’s stomach with tight ropes of come. His internal muscles constricted almost painfully and Harry came too, erratically bucking while riding out his orgasm, waves of pure ecstasy exploding in his skull and a low, broken cry tumbling out of his mouth. After what felt like an eternity had passed, Draco flopped down on his back beside Harry, breathing heavily. Harry wasn’t sure he hadn’t momentarily passed out back there but he didn’t care. A warm and fuzzy feeling of satiety and contentedness settled over him like a fluffy blanket. Wandlessly, he bid the sheets to retract then cover them because he didn’t trust his limbs at this point.
Draco’s heart missed a beat.
Narcissa clenched her delicate jaw and caressed her son’s cheek with the pad of her thumb. He looked at her, his grey eyes widening when he understood.
Kingsley informed him that he made it look like Harry had been assigned to an urgent undercover mission, warranting the transfer of a new recruit from Wales to handle his paperwork and low-level duties. It was suspicious but Kingsley had firmly impressed upon Robards that any indiscretion regarding Harry’s absence would likely put his mission in jeopardy. His “replacement” was presented as a political move to appease high-level officials. Sure, it was clever and explained everything but Harry was already sick of getting a preferential treatment and he doesn’t relish the idea of all his colleagues taking him for the daughter of some well-connected bigwig with deep pockets.
“Well, if I’m not retiring, I need to sort this mess then” Ron sighed dispiritedly.
“It’s not, I’m offering a way out.”
“Yeah, you’re sorry, I got that” he paused. “Well, I’m glad you’re okay.”
“Merlin Harry, I don’t even know what to say…”
The moment seemed frozen in time and Draco couldn’t detach his stare from the Auror’s face, his mesmerizing almond-shaped green eyes with dark, long eyelashes, straight nose and fleshy lips. So inviting… So close… His brains screamed to fuck off but he couldn’t quite grasp why anymore, his mind clouded by the wine and the intoxicating presence of the Auror.
Harry answered way too quickly and enthusiastically for his own taste.
” dreamt Al.
Then when he felt Harry was about to explode, the white-blond stopped and stood again, peppering Harry’s unresponsive face with light kisses. He looked already so far gone with his lust-blown deep-green irises, his swollen parted lips and flushed cheeks that Draco had to use all the restraint he could muster not to ravish him here and now.
Draco’s hips were crashing on Harry’s flesh mercilessly, he was losing himself in the sensations that exploded in his body. He had never felt so alive, his skin and nerves ablaze and on the verge of snapping, he wouldn’t last very long now.
Catesby paled and threatened him with his index, a heinous rictus plastered on his face.
The months after the War were hectic. When Harry gave him his life back at the trials, he ran away from his mother’s emptiness, from his father’s toxicity, from the dark memories now embedded in the stones that had cradled his childhood and above all, from the all-consuming guilt choking him. He hid in Muggle London, free for the first time of his life to be anyone he wanted to be. He replaced his poisonous education with what he saw with his own eyes. There, he also lost himself in dim lighting; in loud music he didn’t understand but made him feel more alive than he had ever been; in cheap alcohol that didn’t smoke or fizzed or tickled; against the press of warm bodies who couldn't get enough of his pale flesh. He welcomed the burn then; looked for it, longed for it. He just wanted to feel, just feel and stop thinking. Stop thinking about the damage he had done and the feelings welling up inside him for the one person he could never have.
“That’s the spirit” scoffed Malfoy with a wry and tired smile.
His best friend explored the other practical aspects of his condition as thoroughly as the rest. Harry and her had “the talk” —one of the most awkward experiences of his life, and that meant topping Cho Chang at Madam Pudifoot’s and Moaning Myrtle in the bathroom in fourth year for fuck’s sake— so now Harry considers himself fully briefed on periods, PMS, hormonal spikes and other things of the like he never suspected existed. He firmly drew the line to the sex though; it hardly seems likely he will pop that cherry anytime soon.
“Merlin, I don’t need that right now… I-I’ll write her something.” he said grudgingly.
The fair-haired wizard snorted cynically and didn’t answer. After a few flourishes, Draco was done. He paused, looked critically at his work and said.
“Oh Merlin” says Potter reverently when he slides in and seats himself fully in the quivering hot channel. His arms wrap around Draco and he kisses him softly, almost tenderly, resting on his elbows and trembling between his legs. Draco revels in the sensation of being full and stretched wide open with that familiar mixture of burn and pleasure.
Somehow, what happened in the living room before seemed too private to be shared with him, even if Harry was inextricably linked with it.
“Good Grief…” Draco shook his head and laughed in disbelief. A fricking Polyjuice potion at twelve. The nerve and stubbornness of the guy apparently had no limits whatsoever.
that had no effect either.
A rush of cold dread crept inside Draco’s chest.
Draco was speechless. The Golden Boy of the Wizarding World, raised like a slave?
“I made you dinner.” he frowned “I tried to anyway.”
He took his wand and put it on the bed next to him then laid down too and covered the bronze body with his own, relishing in the contact of Harry’s burning skin. The Gryffindor arched his back and their cocks slided against each other in a delicious friction that got them both breathless. Draco then straddled him and firmly grabbed the two hard lengths in his left hand, starting to stroke them together. Harry trashed under him and buried his face in the pillow, his hands clutching the sheets and his body arching again. Draco’s breath hitched. He reached for his wand. With a quick spell he slicked his hands with a translucent and odourless substance. Still rubbing at both cocks, he started playing with his own entrance, teasing the palpitating flesh. He inserted one, then two fingers and scissored inside the tight channel. It didn’t take long, he was way too turned on by the writhing Gryffindor who completely unravelled under his touch.
“Well, not right now! Though I suspect I’ll be up for round two quite shortly” he says lightly. When he sees Harry’s expectant face, he takes pity on him and adds softly:
“Draco? Do you…?”
“And what was your great plan to win me over, you stubborn Gryffindor git?” said Draco bitterly.
Then she was off. Harry blushed furiously and caught sight of Draco. The bastard smirked at him superiorly before Ron pushed him away excitedly towards the other side of the room to fill his glass with one the disgustingly strong cocktails he was known for.
“I’m here to offer you a way out.”
“Neville” Ron suddenly bellowed when the sand-haired wizard appeared in the crowd.
” Advised Al.
“I promise I’ll try” he laughed under her dubious stare. “By the way, you look great in that blue thing” added Harry, eyeing appraisingly the beautiful dress.
“W-What?” asks Potter, obviously in a state of deep confusion. Potter’s t-shirt has a hem so tired his collarbones show. It’s a distracting sight.
Harry’s shoulder line went stiff, his profile as sharp as broken silex.
, it’s clearly not all bad. He feels the same sensation of being filled but that’s about it for the resemblance. After a few back and forth motions, Draco hits a spot somewhere and Harry cries out in pleasure.
“Hah” exclaimed Harry and pushed back to get him deeper inside him.
“I’ll have to cut the shirt in order to clean the cut” warned Draco.
Harry entered the kitchen but didn’t see him, focused on his apologies and the removal of a big and heavy dark trench coat.
“Of course you speak French… Blasted blue-blooded Slytherin...” he mumbled as Draco laughed.
“You drove me crazy with your fucking suit and your teasing little looks…” he trailed off, momentarily rendered speechless by the decadent sight of the tousled wizard, his black shirt, silky dark tie and waistcoat open, revealing the lean pale torso covered in golden lights by the fire. Harry growled and resumed his frantic rambling and ministrations. Draco hissed in approval when the rough hand slipped in his smart black trousers and caressed his hard, leaking cock.
in Azkaban.” Harry said with an even tone.
Harry could feel him tremble beside him, hands clenched in fists. He didn’t know what to say. There was nothing more to say.
Another surprising comfort is his time with Malfoy. The tall blond has become ‘Draco’ at some point and every Wednesday and Friday, he finds himself counting the hours until their allotted time slots.
He still feels like he’s wearing someone else’s body and it still feels wrong, especially his voice. Sometimes he forgets and catches a glimpse of his feminine body in a window or a mirror and it hits him again. He doesn’t feel like he could ever get used to it but he’s not freaking out anymore. And it is nice to be able to go wherever he wants without being mobbed, leery stares or not.
” said Al with a very satisfied and provocative tone. Harry laughed frankly this time.
It was very strange for Harry to see Draco sodding Malfoy sitting casually on the carpet, sipping whisky with him and wearing his own clothes. The dark-haired man took a closer look at his unlikely guest. He was thinner than what he remembered from school but taller. His face was strained and his aristocratic features were marked. The fire cast golden shimmering lights on his white-blond hair and pale skin, accentuating his long pointy face, straight nose and proud cheekbones. His unrefined clothes made him look like a teenager, far from the sophisticated outfits Draco always sported.
“Yes.” Draco sighs “If you want to call it that”
“Potter, control yourself or I swear to God I’ll fire you, no matter how many times you lived! Do I make myself clear??”
Catesby crossed and uncrossed his legs, seemingly lost in his thoughts.
Harry’s blood boiled in his veins, his fingers clutched his wand until his knuckles went white. His magic whirled ominously around him.
“Dunno. May be genetics, though. Sirius told me my Dad was even a worse lightweight than I am. Apparently, he once snogged Lupin and declared his undying love for teapots before crashing from the table he was standing on. Everyone thought he had broken his neck. Turns out he had just zonked out and started snoring.” Harry smiled fondly and let himself fall on the couch. “So, consider yourself lucky I’m not that bad.”
“Draco Malfoy, you’ll be the death of me” he declared gravely between to scratchy inhalations “but I’ll definitely die a happy man.”
“Alive.” Answered Draco darkly. “Free.”
Hermione has clearly gotten use to Harry’s tantrum over the four hectic years they had after the end of the war and picked up a thing or two along the way. When Harry finally stops to get some air into his lungs she stands smartly and raises a brow at him, her face grim and determined.
“Maybe I was in the younger years and you don’t remember me” says Harry innocently.
“Come on, Al is harmless, I swear.”
“Hello, Harry!” said Luna happily. She sounded delighted. “What’s up?”
with dragons. I could talk about dragons for hours on end. And because of my name, I thought it was completely natural for me to seek the company of dragons, that they would somehow recognize me as one of their own” his face then closed. “Of course, my father quickly disabused me of that idea. It wasn’t befitted to a Malfoy, ergo it wasn’t what I was supposed to dream about.”
“Well, I’m sorry too but before engaging in sappy effusions, could you call off you beast? I can’t feel my legs anymore.” said the Slytherin moodily.
Draco didn’t know what strange compulsion made him push the Gryffindor. He had felt his magic flaring all around the house like a furious hurricane and couldn’t help his awe before the raw strength and power that rolled off the Auror in fiery waves. Even Voldemort’s aura hadn’t felt this violent, this intense. The Dark Lord signature had been painfully powerful, potent and inescapable but … cold, dead somehow. This was something else. It was like his flesh was being stripped off his bone by the sheer intensity of the magic barely kept under control. The aura was magnetizing, irresistible, the raging storm of magic was dangerously entrancing.
“What?” the Slytherin arched a white-blond brow poshly.
The refined glassy object looked out of place in this magical old home and Harry had struggled with the spells to make it work around magic.
Harry didn’t come home that night. He walked for what felt like hours in the cold London streets, his face and fingers numb with the cold. Then, he collapsed on his office chair and stole a few hours of sleep until Ron entered the room and woke him up. After an awkward start, they just ignored each other and focused on their respective paperwork. Harry buried himself in his reports until seven o’clock when he rose up and went home without a word. He had had the distinctive impression Ron was about to say something before he paused at the door but nothing happened.
It was bad enough to be in the Gryffindor’s debt but if he was starting to lust after him like a clueless love-struck Hufflepuff, it was bad. Epically, bang-you-head-on-the-walls, obliviate-yourself, voluntarily-cuddle-with-a-dragon bad.
Without knowing what he was doing, he started grinding his hips roughly against the blond’s, panting uncontrollably, desperately looking for something to release the tension that was driving him insane. He left Draco’s mouth, and attacked his neck, gritting his teeth against the soft skin and sucking the flesh hard, filled with a savage pleasure when he felt his pulse jump under his touch.
“He’s your own son…” said the Auror in disgust, appalled and speechless.
The vapors of Firewhisky had dissipated in the cold hours of the night, when they laid in a tangle of damp limbs on the rug transfigurated into a thin mattress, covered by their cloaks. Despite the welcome blankness in his head and the calm seeping through his bones with the even breathing of the boy snuggled against him, Harry didn’t fall asleep. He studied the sharp beauty of the man he had just given himself to.
“Mmmh… I like it when you get bossy like that…” said Harry shamelessly and stepped back, slowly stripping off his clothes, piece by piece, locking his feral green stare with Draco’s.
Harry lowered his head and looked at Draco’s work in progress.
“Where did you get your hands on Slytherin Quidditch robes anyway?”
“You do?” Harry frowned.
“Bastard” said Harry lowly. When he raised his stare, he saw Draco was looking at him with a flickering smile and warm grey eyes. “Well he is” mumbled Harry while getting back to chopping his onions, feeling weirdly vulnerable.
When Harry was buried to the hilt into the hot channel, the Slytherin paused and rested his head on Harry’s tanned shoulder, unmoving, his flesh quivering around the hard shaft.
“You don’t have to say anything, I just… wanted to tell you earlier, okay? And when we were… when I just… well I don’t want you to feel obligated or anything, alright? I just… couldn’t keep it in…”
“But now, they will kill you too and I can’t, I BLOODY CAN’T HAVE THE BLOOD OF SOMEONE ELSE ON MY HANDS!!!! DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT??? BUT NOW IT’S TOO LATE!!! YOU HAD TO PLAY THE HERO AND JUST SAVE THE DAY, DIDN’T YOU??? I DIDN’T WANT TO BE SAVED, HARRY!!!”
“Are you sure you don’t want to come back, mate?” he whispered, for no apparent reason “I’m sure Kingsley would give you the position in a heartbeat! Or at least your own team, you know” he mumbled.
“Genius” said the redhead delightedly.
Bitterness filled him once more.
“All of them I think, and probably several times each” answered Hermione earnestly.
“I figured you needed a drink” said a deep voice behind him, making him start.
Draco put a cup of his lilac mixture on the table beside his elbow and Harry eyed it dubiously.
“Er… thanks I guess?”
They seemed to deflate with relief and collapsed against the armchair, one on each of his sides while Southwell kept busy on his wounds.
“Are you alright?” she asked with a knowing gleam in her warm chestnut irises.
“Potter, you’re absolutely barmy” said Draco, slowly shaking his head in disbelief, pale as death. He didn’t think his shock over the verdict could get worse. Of course Potter had to prove him wrong. By asking him out, apparently. What a fucking weird day.
“Well, aren’t you resourceful…” he says admiringly and Potter smiles. It’s such an easy, open smile that Draco almost looses it here and there.
“Hello, Narcissa” said the man pleasantly, head nodding in a formal greeting.
“Oh God... God, Draco you feel so good…” he moved tentatively and let out another low howl, his hands clasping his hips hard enough to bruise the marmoreal skin.
“You probably need it more than I do” he said simply “and that’s bloody saying something” he muttered.
“I’ll take your word for it. And thanks for that disgusting picture that I will never be able to forget”
“Anyway, once we know how many of them we’re talking about, we split up and move in. I want discretion, I want stealth and I want efficiency. Try to neutralize and incapacitate as much as you can, we’re gonna need a shitload of statements to get Catesby’s ass in Azkaban” Ron advised carefully, holding everyone’s gaze intently to impress upon them the importance of that idea.
“Gryffindor? No, you couldn’t think so poorly of Potter if you were” he muses aloud, missing the panicked glance Harry throws him and how he freezes suddenly.
“I know perfectly well what’s happening in that dirty one-tracked little mind of yours and it’s a big fat ‘no’.”
“And did you hear me complain?” Harry chuckles “I was just worried I would be bad at it and just blow it”
Ron appeared at his side and propped him up on an armchair, looking anxious, his cheek smeared with dried blood.
“Hmmm? Oh yeah, right” answers Draco distractedly, not even looking at his hand.
“That’s not what I meant. We hate the bugger and he hates our guts, there’s no denying that. But think about it just a moment. He wanted us out of the field, he messed with our cases and reassigned us. What if he’s trying to cover something up?”
“Yeah well, let’s say the last couple of years gave me... perspective”
“Just Accio the damn thing, for Merlin’s sake!” snapped Draco.
“Well, to be fair, you’re kind off… you know” Ron points out hesitantly, avoiding Harry’s stare.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence…” says Harry bleakly, feeling a tad indignant. He’s a bloody Auror for fuck’s sake, he can take care of himself, thank you very much. But the prospect of hiding out in the dingy house with Kreattur’s weekly visits as sole company is daunting enough for him to keep his mouth shut.
As soon as the Aurors blasted the venerable wooden doors open, a chaos of flying hexes and shouted counter-curses settled over the stone castle.
Then all lights went out and Draco started, terror filling him instantly. He gripped his wand as his chest constricted in a tight and icy ball. But then Luna started singing and Draco saw the flickering light of dozens of candles casting quivering shadows on a huge cake floating above Harry’s arms. Ron and Hermione were singing too now and Draco realized it was a birthday song.
“I thought you didn’t want to do it again right now?” answers Harry, his voice dropping low and making interesting things happen to his crotch.
Harry complied obediently. His head was starting to spin and he was pleasantly buzzing with warmth and drowsiness.
“It’s not mine”
“Tsk tsk…” answered Harry wickedly “Really Draco… I thought
“I might be persuaded” Draco says breathlessly in a pitiful attempt at nonchalance. A feral glint flares in the vibrant green orbs, fanning a similar blaze in his loins. The white-blond man somehow finds it in him to smirk seductively and apparently snap the last strain of self-control Potter possessed in the process –then again, the Golden Boy was never greatly endowed in this regard.
Harry woke up with a delicious warm and firm body pressed against his. He breathed in a faceful of lemon-scented white hair contentedly. With a burst of happiness he realized the agitation from earlier hadn’t been a dream. The Gryffindor felt a definite flush creeping on his cheeks at the memory and arousal pooled in his loins. His breathing picked up a notch.
have a death wish.”
“I will, see you later” he kissed her on the lips and hugged her briefly before turning away.
listen! You have no idea what you’ve done!!! They will eventually find me and kill me but I don’t care, I’ve been prepared for this for years! Why do you think I was going along with it? I wasn’t supposed to make it anyway!”
“Very good, Potter, look how docile you are…” Draco said seductively “I think you deserve a treat, don’t you?”
“Potter, I’m not the kind of person who runs after a shag… or two, for that matter”
The tall blond then visibly deflates and leans on a table weakly. Harry breathes an internal sigh of relief. In a gesture of helplessness, Draco rakes a hand through the white hair and smear blood in the silvery strands.
“Isn’t this personal enough for you?”
Harry took it and sniffed at the content, just Firewhisky it seemed. He hesitated a moment and frowned.
“I’m no animal, I’ll let you have proper goodbyes” he rose to his feet in an elegant gesture and whispered an ‘Enervate’ to the sleeping form of Narcissa as Draco’s stomach churned. What the fuck did that mean?
Draco’s running a hand through his white hair and worrying his lips, enraptured in his conjectures. He makes a striking picture with his eternal waistcoat and white shirt ensemble, his silky fringe falling over his lashes, looming over the impossibly intent storm-grey eyes. Warmth pools inside him and washes over Harry’s whole body imperiously. The collar of his own shirt seems suddenly too tight and Harry has to refrain himself from loosening it. He tries to get air in his lungs properly and concentrates on the depressing sky in the tall magic windows.
“Yeah, that sounds great, thanks.” he paused, embarrassed “Would you know, erm... where my clothes are by any chance?”
He inelegantly slumped back in his chair under Draco’s amused gaze and closed his eyes. Harry was swimming pleasantly in a pool of muted fatigue and cheerful satiety.
“All Aurors look exhausted, it’s part of the job description” he chuckled but the bushy brunette’s worried look didn’t falter.
“Mother, what..?”
The Auror was rummaging through one of the upper cabinets in the kitchen, his muggle t-shirt revealing a patch of tanned lower back. Two duffle bags were resting on the kitchen table.
“We’re trying to find him Mrs Malfoy and we hoped you could tell us what you know.”
“Bye, Ferret-face”
In desperation —and because she has figured out something was wrong the first second she saw him— Harry tells everything to Hermione. He braces himself for an excruciating lecture but it never comes. Hermione is clearly not happy with him but Harry suspects he looks so wretched she doesn’t really have it in her to give him the thorough and crucifying dressing-down he deserves. It may come later though, Harry muses.
“Merlin pants!” exclaimed Hermione suddenly.
“Harry, just-”
is in your house? Harry have you gone bloody MAD??? Did he imperio you?”
“I can imagine.”
They stood up and started dressing again with slow, languid movements. Malfoy’s grey eyes were slightly unfocused, as if he couldn’t believe he was really awake. He was buttoning the shirt Harry had summoned back and repaired when the morning light tinged his hair golden and made his skin gleam like pearly-white velvet.
The elegant tinsel and frosty silver wreaths were classy but in a homey kind of way. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had had a Christmas tree and wreaths in the house and the memory of Draco’s concentrated frown as he conjured and put up shiny lights everywhere put a goofy, uncontrollable grin on his face for hours on end, especially when he recalled how they ended up tangling a light garland irreparably in their haste with one memorable and athletic fuck.
“Draco… Oh God Draco, you’re so fucking tight…” he said in a broken husky voice.
Harry pet an impatient snake who had the munchies then gave him a piece of meat after what, Al went on his way to a nap in a warm nook somewhere in the house.
“You’re too much of a Gryffindor to use this against me, no matter how much you hate me” said Malfoy gloomily.
He sniggered lightly, delighted with his witticism and the chained form of Draco pinned to the wall with twisted iron-wrought bars piercing his shoulders like a collected insect. The white-blond young man was barely breathing and shuddering all over.
“Don’t worry, it’s not poisoned. Mum would never sanction any waste of food, even for a git like you” he chuckled.
“Oh God, Draco I’m so sorry! I’m… Merlin, what is wrong with me?” he said in a rush. He closed his eyes tightly and pinched the base of his nose with a guilty look.
“I understand why you did it” said finally Draco “I just wish you hadn’t.”
“You git, why do you always have to go and get yourself hurt, you’re a bloody moron, I tell you what, as soon as…” Harry drifted off for a minute, lulled by the steady flow of insults coming out of his friend’s mouth and Hermione’s tender caress in his hair. He smiled painfully, his severed lip crackling and oozing more drops of tepid blood.
But Narcissa cut him off and cupped his jaw like before, locking her blue irises with his intently.
In a second, Harry was on him and about to hit him again but this time, Draco was faster. His fist painfully smashed Harry’s nose with a sickening crack. Blood started flowing down but Harry didn’t seem to notice. The Gryffindor clutched Draco’s front and crashed him oh the wall, his face so close his hot breath was brushing Draco’s face. His eyes were a blazing whirl of raw emotion. The blond fisted Harry’s hair and crashed their mouth together in a punishing kiss, clinking their teeth together and biting Harry’s lips. The Auror’s taste was making his head spin, mixed with the coppery taste of blood.
The blond buried his nose inside Harry’s neck, breathing him in and trying to reign in the wave of emotion that swelled in his chest and threatened to choke him. A moment later, Harry’s breathing deepened, he was already drifting.
“You… you’re gay?” Harry stammered.
“I just
” observed the snake.
But the worst is the guilt. He constantly replays Draco’s wrecked expression in his head, torturing himself at night until the wee hours of the morning.
“Not really, the ability of a quick wandless healing charm is straight up handy for an Auror” Harry answers slowly “though I can make exceptions for special cases” he adds boldly before he chickens out. His pulse is through the roof and he can feel the warmth radiating from Draco’s skin, carrying his sharp, tangy scent.
“No, not this time…” he whispers back and snuggles closer to him, hiding his bleak thoughts. He lets Draco soothe him with the soft rhythm of his breathing and the gentle caresses on his back.
But Draco kisses him again and his brain shuts down. He is semi-conscious of the spells Draco uses to protect themselves but plunges again in something close to a trance when Draco’s fingers work him open, keeping him on the edge of coming for what feels like hours, his mouth still capturing Harry’s in a sultry dance.
“Erm..” says Harry very eloquently, swallowing hard.
“Things are great actually. I… We are recruiting several new consultants and… I should tell you that I offered a job to Draco”
“And… do you…” he falters and averts his eyes “would you… like to do it again…?”
“Ron and Hermione, then Catesby” he repeated to himself and went for the Floo powder.
“Mate…” tried Ron half-heartedly. Harry could tell how angry he was too.
“Oh give me a break with these bollocks” Harry groans before he can stop himself. He freezes.
Harry felt something suspiciously close to a frozen stone falling into his guts. He looked up from his drink, saw Hermione’s anxious eyes and steeled himself, trying to school his features.
“Bloody hell.”
“Ah, poor old Lucius. Not very lucky on the family front, is he?
“Draco” answered Harry with a fake even tone.
Neville was running frantically, scrambling down the corners of the white slippery corridors and avoiding nurses and patients as best as he could. Luna’s owl had been clear this was an emergency and he dreaded to imagine which one of his friends would be lying, mortally wounded, in a white-linen bed
“Come on Luna” he muttered through his clenched teeth “Pick-up, pick-up, pick-”
He lets his breath ghost on the throbbing flesh and lets the tip of his cock enter his mouth but is careful not to let it touch any inch of his inside mouth, making Harry writhe and pant desperately on the sheets. Magic crackles on his skin but he reins it in.
Grey eyes locked on green ones and soothed the swirling ghosts inside.
“God, yes” he hissed wantonly. But he had to be strong he had to- for Heavens’ sake where did Harry learned
“Do what?” Harry croaked.
“Beg me” commanded the pale blond.
“Erm… I’m sorry. This is a bad time, I-I’ll come back” he stutters and his voice is so wrong.
“Here we go again” muttered Harry in a low voice, rolling his eyes. He got up and disappeared in the kitchen, listening to the ramblings of his friends through the opened window.
“Yeah, well I had to try it” said Harry sheepishly, he took a sip of his wine.
“Not exactly” he answered cryptically while holding her gaze. But some form of understanding seemed to pass between them.
Draco’s question snapped him out of his reverie.
“How did you…? Your clothes…?” stuttered the Auror.
The following morning, Draco woke up with a foul taste in his mouth and the sensation someone was drilling through his head with a blunt skewer.
“How many rules did you break at school anyway, for Merlin’s sake???” Said Draco to steer clear of those treacherous waters.
“Fuck this” he said and marched on Catesby’s desk like a madman.
It was still early and the room was filled with a grey, tentative light that barely drew the contours of the furniture.
“Yep”
“Erm, nothing, I just dropped something, go back to sleep, I’ll handle it” Harry seemed calm but something in his voice was off. Draco pushed the door a little further and asked:
“What? No, Draco, that’s not-” Harry starts desperately.
“Luna, I’m sorry but this is very important. Did Draco contact you in the last 24 hours?”
“Yes, of course I know that” he smiled warmly.
“We want in.” she said firmly.
“Ron, you sneaky son of a bitch”
Harry released his hair and arse and used clutched his shoulders from underneath so he could fuck him harder still and prevent Draco from slipping up the bed under his forceful thrusts.
“What?”
“Do I have a choice?”
“Not exactly… Harry was always the instigator he has some kind of instinct… It’s sometimes uncanny how he can be exactly right… I would only supply the how now and again or try to clean their mess” she said with an affectionate gaze at Ron who smiled lovingly and took her hand. They shared a look so deep and intimate that Draco felt suddenly left out and dreadfully alone.
Harry nodded with relief. They remained silent for a while.
Harry’ wandless surge of magic lashed out and hit Draco, yanking out the metal bars that held him to the wall and delicately levitating him on one of the sofas. Harrys gaze remained on the Death-Eather, shooting a quick glance at Draco. His body was limp but the bluish pulse under his opalescent skin told him he was alive.
He was about to add another cutting remark but lost all coherent thought when the dark-haired man tugged at his shirt and hot hands wandered on the pale skin underneath.
” asked the sleepy reptile hopefully, his tiny snout rising to face Harry’s heavy eyes.
“But let’s not get ourselves down, shall we? Now that the fault has been established, I’ll just have to cleanse the Malfoy name from all this… unpleasantness.”
He touched his forehead and Draco’s last conscious thought was how hot the tanned skin was against his, then everything went black.
His eyes take in the purple marks on his neck and he feels sick. Merlin, what in hell did he do? What did he do to Draco?
“You didn’t realize what you were signing up for, did you? Starting to regret already?” said the blond caustically.
“God, how could I be so stupid…” Draco chuckles darkly, raking his hand in his hair like he did the day before.
Harry clenches his fists, his mails leaving angry red indents in the skin of his palms.
The white-blond young man chanted a long spell that enveloped the Gryffindor in a soft yellow light and soothed his stiff muscles almost instantly. It was as if he had stepped in a warm and smooth liquid. Harry moaned wantonly with relief.
“Anything you’d like to say, Auror Potter?”
sodding
“Why the fuck is the Golden Boy of Wizarding Britain still a virgin at 24?” he asks aloud in serious disbelief.
“I suspect you’re here to take us back to Lucius?” she added in an icy-cold voice.
“Oh, you do…?” purred the fair-haired man while feasting his eyes on the wide expense of golden skin, taut muscle and hard, throbbing flesh. Harry obviously did, his shaft already hard and twitching between his legs.
Trying to focus on anything else than his state of undress, Draco took in the smooth bronze skin outlined in gold by the early sun, the scars shattered everywhere on his back, some old and silvery-white, some new and angry-red. The broad shoulders tensed and Draco could see his breathing was uneven, erratic little cloud of white smoke getting out of his mouth and ascending in the shy golden light.
“Draco… You feel so good, so fucking good…” moans the Auror and he looks so far gone and so beautiful like that, his brows knitted in ecstasy and his lips parted again, cheeks flushed. He must have lost his glasses at some point and when he opens his eyes, a sea of verdant green takes Draco away as he jabs one more time into him.
A pause stretched between them.
“Who is that civilian?”
Hermione shot him such a stern look that he started laughing.
“Draco?”
He chuckles while his eyes narrow and takes a step closer, sending thrills of apprehension and something else that isn’t entirely unpleasant down Harry’s spine.
They were in the living room with a crackling fire. Harry was slumped on the couch and the pale blond was curled up in an old armchair with a tattered book.
In the few months that follow, Draco has learned that dating Harry Potter comes with long waiting hours, cancelled dates and a sometimes sombre Harry slouched with the weight of the day. But he doesn’t care about it. It feels so right he feels it in his very bones. And it turns into mind-blowing apology-sex (finally a type of apology Harry excels in) later so it’s worth it.
With a violence that takes him completely by surprise, Harry wishes it was him and not Jean lying here with Draco; him that Draco watches with this softness and this thing that makes his insides turn into mush every time he gets a glimpse of it.
“How very Gryffindor of you” murmured Draco and Harry didn’t know how to take this.
Honestly, it’s a miracle he can even conjure up a sentence this long with Potter so hell-bent on making him go round the twist.
” laughed Harry. The snake coiled around his wrists and his snout bumped his nose gently.
“Blergh, if I picture it I may vomit. No offence but I’m afraid I’m as gay as the proverbial goose” he giggled. Malfoy giggled. Harry frowned, this night was getting impossibly weirder.
“We may have sneaked in the Slytherin common room…” answered Hermione, a rosy blush creeping on her cheeks though Harry was persuaded it had more to do with the white wine than the actual embarrassment. “Well Ron and Harry did anyway, I had… a last minute technical difficulty...” Harry smiled at the memory.
Harry wrapped his strong hand around his cock and started stroking himself, his eyes not leaving the white-blond for a second. The sight of Harry pleasuring himself was indecently mesmerizing. Draco unclothed himself with a provocative glint in his silvery pools. He stood in front of the sofa and said authoritatively:
“There must be a way to find him” growled Harry, slamming his fist on the table. He couldn’t bear to stay here and do nothing while Draco was probably being atrociously tortured. Or worse, but this, Harry refused to think about.
“It is” Harry agreed. But he didn’t push it. A pause stretched out between them and Harry gulped at his scotch.
Harry hold the pencil and Draco grabbed it, momentarily brushing their fingers. For a fraction of second, their eyes met as well, then they started spinning.
“They’re still giving you a hard time at work?” she asked anxiously.
“So… Now that you’re a free man and all, would you like to have a coffee with me sometime?” asked Potter after he caught him at the end of the trial, a goofy grin painted over his straight features.
“Yes”
“… but there’s something about you, Jean… and it’s driving me mad” he whispers. He releases Harry’s arm but doesn’t let go of him, instead Draco starts tracing his fingers on his arm, then shoulder and back.
“DRACO! Don’t you dare-”
The tall blond craned his neck, trying and failing to see who was talking. He concentrated but couldn’t recognize the voice and the light but lingering accent. European, but from where? He could only see a huge dark form, moving around his field of vision, accompanied by the soft rustle of fabric.
“Don’t freak out like that Potter, Christ, I’m only joking” Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“We broke up at the end of sixth year. I couldn’t afford the luxury of having anyone they could use against me. And I’m not sure I’m up to pick up where we left off anyway. I know she probably is but it’s not the same anymore.”
“I’m not! I just didn’t think…”
“How could I let pass the opportunity? I never saw a Pure-Blood Wedding Party.” he said with a light tone and took a sip in his own glass. The Gryffindor reminded him so strongly of Dumbledore at this moment, babbling airily as if it was perfectly natural for him to be here, that a shiver ran down his spine.
“He would never abandon his mother when she’s in danger” said Harry forcefully. The dark-haired wizard turned his blazing green eyes on his best friend and said implacably:
When he feels Harry’s distraught enough, he turns his mouth on the hard cock looming in his field of vision, lapping at it and curving his tongue and lips around it. He takes him deeper and deeper, welcoming the burning scratch on his throat.
Malfoy shrugged and didn’t answer.
Draco wrapped his legs around him, already high on a rush of pleasure, intoxicated by Harry’s smell, feel and sounds.
“Adorjan, isn’t he awfully quiet, suddenly?” asked Lucius pleasantly to the short, stocky wizard holding a glinting serrated knife. “We wouldn’t want him to get bored or lose consciousness and miss the show, now would we?”
“We’ll find him” she said resolutely, her vibrant tone strong enough to imprint her will on the fabric of fate. Or so she hoped.
Draco struggled against his binds frantically but they held on. Narcissa turned away and faced Sándor, her proud face and stature radiating with grim determination.
Then Draco’s mask slips once more and reveals the pain and betrayal swirling inside.
“What happened? I heard shattered glass...”
Harry didn’t answer.
“So, eh mate, have you tried it? Ron asks with a distinct slur and a conspiratorial glint in his eyes Harry doesn’t quite like the look of.
“Yeah, of course, sorry. I just can’t believe you’re here, today on top of everything…”
“I’m tired of running” he said with a note of finality. “There’s a cell in Azkaban with my name on it and I fully intend to take possession of it and die there pathetically in the next six months”
Harry couldn’t bear the sight of him, belittled, reduced to nothing, crushed under his father words. He wanted to reach out, wanted to tell him he was wrong, that he was fierce and had a greatness nobody could dim. But instead, he watched powerlessly as he slowly slipped in unconsciousness. In a desperate effort, Harry twisted his fingers severely in his leg wound, biting his lips hard enough to severe the skin in order to stifle his scream of pain. The disgusting pain mixed with adrenaline immediately woke him up and the fog around his brain cleared momentarily.
Draco freezes at his words.
“Remember lads, this is a rescue mission. Any questions? Ok great, gear up then, we’re taking off in five.”
“Yes, I told you I’m trying to make things right. I reckon It’s important I talk to them too.” said Draco decidedly.
Malfoy raised a brow quizzically.
“You’re bloody insufferable!” Draco shouted vehemently, his eyes shining bright in the mid-morning light.
father. No wonder he acted the way he did when he was young. It’s terrible. It’s abusive and twisted and… barbaric!” she said in a disgusted tone.
“You want me now?” His voice is like gravel.
“Bye, Weaselby” answered Draco pleasantly.
“I take it he did work for your side in the end” he said softly, his eyes betraying something raw.
“I’m what?” asks Harry with a dark tone, his temper flaring.
“Yeah, I thought it would annoy him the most. I considered pink robes but this is probably worse.”
She threw a critical look at Harry’s state then schooled her features in a professional blank mask.
“I… did a bit of thinking last night, that’s all.”
“Huh, maybe?” said Harry sheepishly.
The Slytherin opened his mouth and answered in kind, sliding his tongue against Harry in a maddening pattern that was setting him on fire, it was nothing like kissing Cho or Ginny. Gosh it was a million times more intense.
The blond turned his head and faced him, his silvery eyes flaring with something raw and implacable. His lips were stretched with a cynical smile.
“I don’t want to talk to you”
“I mean, let’s face it he
“Thanks I guess…?” Draco ignores him.
“Bollocks” he says out loud petulantly. But he’s starting to get curious. It would be stupid not to at least try it, right? Anyway, if Parson’s words are anything to go by, he should be stuck with a vagina for several weeks at the least and he can’t just not wank for the whole time now, can he?
“... I think Molly is this close to come barging in Grimmault Place. If you miss another Sunday brunch at the Burrow…”
“I did but he… He tricked me. He shut me down and then he bailed.”
“Is it some kind of magical experiment?” asked the pale-blond warily.
“I’m not sure it’s- ”
A shy ray of light was filtrating under the door of his room. Draco got out of his bed in his pyjama bottoms, still sleepy but damn curious. He opened the door a little and spied through the crack. The light was coming from the bathroom. Through the door slightly ajar, Draco could see frantic movement and hear a steady stream of low imprecations. He recognized Harry’s voice and wondered what he was doing. Struggling with something apparently.
“You’re very welcome. I must say I didn’t realize how much I had missed Quidditch up until then.”
When he opened the door though, all traces of mirth left his face. A House elf was looking at him in wild terror, his big blue eyes and huge ears protruding from his stricken face. He was also wounded, purple bruises marring his waxy flesh.
“What are you doing here?” asked Malfoy warily.
“That’s none of your business!” exclaimed Harry angrily and looked away.
“I understand why you did it, Harry. You were right.”
“Mmmmh” confirmed Harry lasciviously in a deep vibrant tone, his eyes roaming hungrily on the slender body.
“Catesby wants to see you” she said apologetically, pulled a dramatic face and disappeared. Ron sighed and removed his feet from his desk, Harry groaned and stopped playing with his wand and paperclips. They both got up and braced themselves for an unpleasant chat with their Boss.
Then the blade went back to work and the screams resumed.
Draco was distracted from his gloomy thoughts when Harry moved. Draco reflected it was probably the longest time he had seen the Gryffindor stay still.
“And I insulted the only person that was ever nice to you.” said Draco bitterly “No wonder you turned me down when I offered to be your friend.”
fall apart” he murmurs in his ear and starts to undulate his body on him like an ophidian succubus.
He snuck a glimpse at the beautifully dishevelled blond, thrashing, arching and clutching the headboard as if his life depended on it. Draco’s head had fallen back in the cushions and his body was flushed and covered in goose bumps. His gorgeous cock was fully erect and shining with precome.
“Yes, he does” said Hermione softly. She hesitated and asked cautiously, dropping her voice “Did you see him lately?”
Harry wandlessly cleans it and casts a healing spell, and hears Draco’s sharp intake of breath. He doesn’t meet the grey eyes he senses on his face where heat blooms under his skin.
As his trouble grew stronger and stronger, Draco rose up to his feet and excused himself for the night before his body engaged in more visible demonstrations of its stimulation.
Harry’s drunk, drugged, under a spell, it doesn’t matter. He doesn’t know and doesn’t care, he just wants. Every fibre of his being is filled with want and need.
“Hey, not fair! I don’t practice alone, you know!” he slurred indignantly.
“Draco, what about the gues- Oh god” he moaned desperately as Draco’s mouth closed hungrily around his cock.
He shook it like in a dream and felt the warm, rough skin wrapped around his. A small smile blossomed on his face and mirrored Harry’s.
“So this is the part where I owe you my life, again.”
“I said, fuck off!!!” shouted Harry roughly. When no answer came, he sighed and let his head fall on his palms. He fisted his hands in his hair, pulling so hard tears filled his eyes with the pain. His breathing was still a mess and he could feel his magical core all over the place, like it was about to explode. The pain pulsating in his hands was like a distant noise buzzing near his conscience.
Trouble is, it works both ways. Harry is trying to be careful but he knows it is only a matter of time before he blows it. And what is he going to do if he does, he has no idea. Probably get away quickly before being permanently injured. Harry studiously avoids any personal subject but sometimes he can’t help it. Like this time for instance.
At the precise moment he opens his mouth, Potter covers it with his own. He’s obviously as turned on as Draco is and asks:
“Yes, they fucking do” said Harry in his deep raspy voice then started is wet exploration of the perfect pale body, forgetting his inexperience and self-consciousness.
Ron’s words come back to him in the intimacy of his own dark bedroom.
“That man is an animal.”
“Who are you and what did you do with Draco Malfoy?” Joked Harry, he was already getting merry with the alcohol.
“No!”
Fortunately, the whistle of the kettle went at his rescue and freed him from the cool and indecipherable green gaze. Harry poured the boiling water into cups, added milk and sugar to one of them and held it to Draco. He took the other one and sat at the end of the table, raising his cup and sipping from it, staring at Draco calmly and expectantly. His calm demeanour was utterly unnerving and Draco bristled, anger coiling around his spine.
“Don’t you fall down and ruin my work, you twat.”
“Do you have any healing balm?” He asked, finally getting a hold of himself.
“Fuck…” finally says Draco. Harry doesn’t answer, just hugs him tighter and manoeuvres him on his side. He wraps himself around him from behind, burying his face in Draco’s hair. Draco relaxes, letting the drowsy post-orgasmic glow settle around him.
“You’re not setting a foot out of this house, you’ll get yourself killed!” growled Harry.
“Yes please, Harry” she answered pleasantly “I caught Harry in a deep conversation with a little adder at my housewarming party once. -She’s very friendly now by the way-”
With Hermione’s spells they determined a force of approximately 25 hostiles. Ron set up teams and a signal for the send off.
, like a chant or a prayer, and there was no way to tell if he was saying that out loud or not but the hell if he cared. The pain was gone, the hollow-numb-coldness inside him was gone, he was alive, more alive than he had ever been and the only thing that mattered was the taut body against his and the rush in all his senses.
“Well, I’m not exactly popular at the moment if you hadn’t noticed” he said stiffly.
“And you were the one teasing Jean about ‘unrequited love making people bitter’ or whatever, I can’t believe it!”
“Then again, she’s your mother, so I don’t expect you to agree. That and the fact you’d rather take it up the arse than be a man” added the man with clear disgust.
“Harry… It’s like Umbridge all over again, she was torturing you and you didn’t even tell us…”
Malfoy slided down the wall to sit besides Harry. He looked a bit wobbly and Harry couldn't blame him. He was starting to feel the alcohol suffuse his tired body with calm and a pleasant bubbly warmth.
“Ngghhh… Draaaco” he moans wantonly when his face brushes the twitching leaking mess that is his cock.
Thought Harry. He hadn’t laughed like that in ages.
“I normally don’t… go for women…” he starts and Harry’s heart sinks, humiliation and disappointment stinging more than he could imagine it would. He steps back and starts to stammer an apology but Draco grabs his arms and stops him. His touch burns him through the thin layer of clothes. The grey eyes search his and pierce through him again with that same impossible intensity.
“Harry…”
Harry is pissed. Magic-out-of-control-whirling-around-him pissed. First and foremost, he’s pissed at himself. Why did he have to go to the Department of Mysteries and get himself blasted with an unknown curse? Why did he? He could just have waited for the bloody report on the bloody cursed object he had found on the bloody scene of the bloody —quite literally unfortunately— murder he was investigating.
“I think I’ll miss him too” Harry blurted out. He realized with great surprise that he meant it. He was still in shock about the revelations of Dumbledore’s pensine and couldn’t quite grasp that Snape had been protecting him all these years but little by little, it all started to fall into place in his head.
“Shut up and kiss me again”
is sorted out.
“I’m sorry.” said Harry in a whisper.
“Thanks” Draco exhaled a shuddering breath and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, it was to catch the hurt and betrayal in the deep green eyes and he knew instantly what the Gryffindor was thinking about.
“It’s from a muggle book Harry never bothered to read” she said, shooting the Gryffindor an unimpressed look.
, thinks Draco darkly.
“Maybe I should be the one to relieve you of the problem and get away from here”
Draco is rendered speechless for a moment as the sheer realization sinks in. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to this. How could he ever get used to this? He frees Harry from his restraints and rocks harder, already close, so fucking close… He arches his back when Harry grips his hips and thrusts in him hard, slamming in him again and again. His strong hands slip and touch him everywhere. One strokes his cock but Draco bats it away.
” Harry explained clumsily.
“You should seriously consider becoming a healer, Draco. You’re really good at this kind of stuff.”
“Come on, trust me. We can handle them.”
“What? Why?”
” approved the snake, slowly uncoiling.
“Evans!” he exclaims victoriously at the first name that goes through his head.
He didn’t have much time to muse on his thought because everyone started screaming the countdown, he looked around frantically and started when a warm and soft hand slipped in his and pressed it. Harry looked at his left and locked his green eyes on the silvery pools full of promises of many many years of playful arguments, stupid fights, mind-blowing sex and much more. Harry cupped Draco’s jaw and kissed the full lips, sealing the pact with a stupid smile.
“I’ve come to terms with it” Malfoy paused and said in a voice so low Harry wasn’t sure he heard it “I got it coming anyway”
“Its Cordon Bleu with salad and onion soup” Draco said almost shyly. When he saw Harry’s gaping mouth he added quickly “It’s French”.
“What is he saying?” asked Draco, curiosity taking the best of him.
A wild smile stretched his lips as the wind prickled on his skin, roared in his ears and whistled through his robes. He let the world turn in an indistinct blur around him and completely threw himself in the game. Each move, each figure was answered in kind by the skilled player at his side. Draco had never truly appreciated how great a flyer Harry truly was. It had been a source of burning jealousy, dismissal and loathing at school but now that the anger and hate was gone, Draco marvelled at the way the young man seemed to elude the physical constraints and fuse with his broom to engage in breath-taking motions/manoeuvres.
“Yup, that’s it, I’m dying today.”
Then Draco just cannot wait a second more; he sinks on Harry’s shaft with a sigh of relief.
“Much better” Hermione smiled wickedly.
“Of course, only Potter would speak Parseltongue yet have a Gryffindor coloured snake” growled Draco. He had been sitting for hours, afraid of the tiniest movement. After watching him for the longest fifteen minutes of his life, the snake had coiled around himself on his lap and fallen asleep.
Luna laughed too and Ron sighed dramatically. “And so began the long list of Harry’s-obsessed-with-Draco-sodding-Malfoy moments.”
“Don’t tell me Smith is your new roommate!” said Ron, horrified.
“You scaly little rascal! I’ll turn you into a handbag, or even better, slippers!” hissed the tall blond acrimoniously, carrying a squirming snake out of his room.
“Did I finally manage to shut up Mr Snarky-comeback?” laughed Harry.
“I swear, I had no idea the spell would do this.” Harry said with a tortured look. Somehow, it seemed important that Draco knew that.
“Then he took me on Sirius’ flying motorbike, brought me to Diagon Alley and helped me get all the things I would need for Hogwarts. He also gave me Hedwig as a birthday gift. And there, I met you.” Harry turned his head and looked at him.
“Look Hermione, I have to go, catch you later?”
“You have no idea what you look like, do you?” he said at last, voice hoarse.
“You’re going to walk out this door, train to be a Healer and leave me alone.” His impossibly green eyes locked his with a fierceness that made the white-blond shiver. Then he turned around and cleaned the table with a flick of his wand.
“Did you have a thing for the Golden Boy?” Draco teases him gently “That’s why you’re crossed at him! Unrequited love will do that to you, I suppose?”
“Let me do this? You’re certainly not one to tell me what to do or not, Potter!” hissed Draco and Harry flinched at the use of his surname and the spiteful tone.
When he reached the dark wooden door, Harry almost hesitated, an irrational mixture of hope and dread seized him as he wrapped his hands around the doorknob. He braced himself and pushed the door but nothing was out of the ordinary. The house was as dull and uninviting than he had left it earlier.
The young woman who looks back in the mirror still looks a lot like him but after Hermione’s clever alterations, you really need to know it’s Harry. His eyes are blue for one and Hermione transfigured his old glasses in stylish rectangular black frames that make him look smart and bookish rather than like a 1970’s historian. The scar on his forehead is gone and he has mixed feelings about it.
“You’re such a Gryffindor” scoffed Malfoy.
“What do you want now, Potter?” he spits out his name like it’s an insult and Harry flinches at the venom in his tone “You had your fun, you humiliated me, now you can go back to your Gryffindor friends and gloat or go to the papers for all I care”
As New Year’s eves go, the party was an unmitigated success. At 12, Grimmault Place, every guest was laughing, chatting and drinking. The house had been scrubbed up and decorated for the occasion and Harry had to admit it looked much more welcoming with a certain Slytherin’s touch.
“Maybe” says Harry warily.
Translation for “Maudits français, comme tu dis!” : "Those bloody french indeed!"
“See Hermione, lately I caught up with him through the phone Duddley gave me and I know we hated each other at school but he really changed and he was in deep, deep shit so I just…”
“What is it?”
“Bite me, I don’t answer to swines like you” said Harry fiercely and stormed out of the office, closely followed by a crimson Ron.
“Draco, what is it, where are we…?”
“Not enough cock, you see.”
As he closed in to have a better view of the wound, Draco was engulfed in the heady scent of the Auror, a mixture of blood, sweat, pine needles and a spicy component Draco couldn’t quite place.
“I know you were forced into it. You were only trying to save your family. I saw you lower your wand on the Astronomy tower that night.”
His best friend looked at him intensely, frowning, and took a moment and a big sip of Gin before answering, as if bracing himself.
“I’m starting to think Skeeter was right, you
“Merlin, you do loathe him, don’t you?”
“I’ll leave you a moment” he added simply and stepped away from them, probably in another room nearby.
“Draco, what happened between you two?”
Heat coils around his spine and pools in his loins at the words.
“It’s a bloody miracle you lived to this day…”
“It’s ok, I understand.” He paused, deep in thought. “I’ll try to completely ward-off the back garden, I know it’s not much but at least you’ll see some actual light.”
“Is it…?” she asked feebly.
“Yes” said Harry in a breath, closing his eyes and tilting his head back, giving access to Draco’s ravenous mouth that sucked and bruised the golden flesh messily. He slipped one finger inside Harry, opening him up slowly. The ring of muscle clenched around his finger as his slave quivered and moaned throatily.
“I don’t give a fuck what you told me”
“Anyway” said Hermione, shooting a disapproving look to Ron.
Draco laves his sensitive spots with a devilish tongue, coaxing helpless sounds from the Auror as he makes his way from his neck to his nipples, hipbone, navel and the inside of his thighs. He grazes his way up the muscle and Harry quivers with want.
“No, Draco I… I didn’t plan on… I just couldn’t stop myself… I’ve fallen in love in you.” He says miserably and falls silent.
“Let me take care of you” Draco soothes, panting “let me… I’ll make it good for you, I’ll make it so good you’re going to scream my name…”
Draco seems to shake himself and his cheeks sport the faintest blush. He clears his throat.
“This and that, a lot of things actually” said Draco lightly. But Harry wasn’t fooled by his casual tone. He raised one of his eyebrows while drinking his tea silently and said amusedly:
“Tell me about it, I’m not sure I properly see colours right now” answered Draco.
“Is that a yes, then?” Potter asked again carefully. He was obviously feeling very self-conscious, and Draco felt something churn pleasantly in his chest.
He cups Draco’s nape and tugs gently, leading him to kneel on the rug over him. Harry lays back on it and gets rid of his clothes with a silent wandless spell. As always, desire flares inside Draco at the display of raw power. It gets overwhelming when he sets his hungry grey eyes on the strong body offered to him. The fireplace is casting dancing lights on Harry, highlighting the bronze and defining the muscles with neat shadows pooling in the hollows. He’s bruised and the scars shine silver gold everywhere but he’s never been more beautiful with that frantic need burning in the bright viridian orbs.
Harry sits on the bed and takes him into a tight hug, his breathing erratic and sticky with their mixed sweat and Draco’s come.
to wind him up, like he
“You look like a walking corpse” observed the pale blond.
Harry nods, not really trusting his voice at the moment. His apprehension comes back. It cannot be that far from bottoming though, he reasons, but it’s not like he did that many times. Apart from a bit of playing with toys, no one ever breached him. Then again he never breached anyone either. Draco must have picked up on the turn in his thoughts because he says:
They stay like this for a while, silent, listening to each other’s hearts beating steadily.
“Look, Harry, I’m-” said Draco, his voice muffled by the door.
Harry wrapped his strong arms around Draco’s torso and lifted him up like he weighed nothing in a cloud of spicy-woody scent. They looked at each other awkwardly, disturbingly close. There was nothing but a thin layer of fabric between them and Draco felt the warmth and firmness of the Auror’s body. Then Harry cleared his throat and averted his eyes. “Good to go?” he asked lightly and let him go progressively, still holding his arm.
” soothed Harry.
When Draco woke up, he was in a bed that wasn’t his in a room he didn’t know. He had a familiar feeling about the old decoration and the engraved four-poster bed but didn’t have a clue about where he was. His head was throbbing with a bad headache and he was feeling weak and dizzy.
“You know what, with you being you, I’m actually quite relieved to know you’re dating a Healer now” she said with rosy cheeks.
“I don’t.” He smiled simply.
Narcissa clenched her delicate jaw and caressed her son’s cheek with the pad of her thumb. He looked at her, his grey eyes widening when he understood.
” confirmed Harry with a short barking laugh.
“What happened?” he asked “Luna called me, said it was urgent, what…?” his words faltered when his blue eyes fell on the face of Narcissa Malfoy, looking paler than death.
Still standing on his elbows, Harry curved his left hand under the blond’s arse and slipped his right forearm beneath his shoulder, threading his finger in the white-gold strands.
But even Hermione comes short on the solution/miraculous ideas/last resorts front and that’s when Harry starts to give up. He mourns the time he used to spend with Draco, the easy banter, the teasing. He misses his cutting tongue and his humour; the way he lits up every time he talks about one of his projects; the way he gets passionate and makes long and fierce monologues to defend a movie he liked; the way his lips twitch when Harry says something funny but he pretends to be unimpressed to rile him up; the way they work together and complement each other; and the list goes on, painfully so.
He bowed his head, filled with powerful emotions: shame, guilt, self-loathing.
“Supposedly” said Catesby superiorly with a wide grin making his perfect teeth glint.
Raising his wand, Harry wordlessly performed an impressive range of inquisitive and revealing spells, quickly imitated by Ron and Hermione.
“Tough shit” answered Harry, warmth creeping in his body. They remained silent for a while, lost in their drunken thoughts.
“He found another way to link himself to Briccius. You know what that means”
“Pretty much, yeah.”
“Nice to meet you and thank you for offering to help me on this project. See, I’ve been thinking about making artefacts that could help Aurors on the line of duty but I need help with the practicalities. I don’t want them to become a liability if there was something impractical in the design.”
“Yeah because being recruited by the elite task force of the Ministry and becoming one of the best Aurors of the country without even graduating proves how slow and dense you actually are” teased Draco.
On Friday, Hermione showed up around seven when Harry was about to call it a day and head home, staring at his parchments fixedly and trying to think about anything else than the fact that Friday was usually their outing night when Ron and Harry weren’t working overtime or stupid shifts.
“I’m glad the week is over… I don’t think I could have stood Fitzwilliam’s one second more before biting his head off…” Harry grumbles darkly. “I mean what’s with the constant ogling? Has he never seen a girl or what? Merlin that guy is slimy…”
It’s still a shock when he gets in the office and Draco greets him with a small but friendly smile though. But Harry is enjoying working with him on those crazy devices, testing them out and burning the furniture like two weird versions of Seamus Finnigan: one female and clueless, one posh and way too clever for it’s own good.
Draco let tout the breath he had been holding during the whole of his panicked introspection and firmly pushed all sweaty related thoughts at the back of his mind.
*       *       *
Then he saw a cloaked body with golden strands of silky hair fanning out around the head and all strategy flew out of his head.
He felt his own climax rise and rise and rise as the tight ring constricted erratically around his hard flesh.
The firecall ended and Harry stayed in the same sitting position, lost in his thoughts. He finally sighed, rubbed his eyes and stood.
“I’m not one of your fan girls, Harry. It’s you I want, not the Chosen One, just you” he murmured feverishly. “I know you have a darkness in you, I know about the nightmares, the scars. I know you did things that still haunt you. But I don’t care. I want you, I want every piece, every crack, every scar. You see, I’m scarred too, I’m broken too. So I know what it’s like.”
