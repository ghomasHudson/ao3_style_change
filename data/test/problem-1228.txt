''Hey Malfoy!'' Harry called as he caught up to him in an empty hall. Draco stopped dead in his tracks, frozen in fear as Harry walked up behind him. He reached out and grasped the blondes shoulder, turning him to face him before pushing him up against the wall. ''Kept it to ourselves, did we? Didn't turn running to old Snape, did we?'' He smirked into Draco's face.
Pansy knew him too well and she loves to gossip but not about him while Blaise is the type of person who is quiet and loves to observe his surroundings and people.
As days went by, Draco was giving less and less attention to Jamie like he used to. It’s not because he loves him less than before, the twins grabbed his attention all the time by crying out loud. When he succeeded in making the twins stop crying, it was already late at night.
Harry came up to Draco and curled his body around him, protecting him, simultaneously licking his fur, cleaning the dirt on his white fur when he tackled him to the ground just now. It’s his fault and him being a good Alpha and a good husband, he would gladly lick every single surface of Draco.
When the number hits one in his head, he taps her shoulder twice and once she turns her head around, he shoved the skull in her face.
Finally, after a few second, father’s gaze went back to the reports in his hands. Draco crossed his arms together and rests his back against the couch, he don’t realised that he accidentally close his eyes when he heard a called from a stern voice.
He knows he shouldn’t because scared that it will get Draco pregnant but time like this makes his brain go fuzzy and he can’t think straight. He vanished his cum inside Draco as quickly as he could when he felt it trickle down to his cock that was still inside of Draco and out of his hole.
‘When I heard from Narcissa that he dropped you off at her without a second thought, I was furious with him that I wish he was the one that was killed instead of her. The more you grow up, the more you resembled him. I tried to hate you because of him but how could I hate you when there’s a part of her in you too.’
Dobby is unusually house-elf, he was the one who always get punished the most between all of the house-elves in the manor. Where most of the house-elves did everything to please their master, Dobby don’t like it. He wants to break free, he wants to become his own person and have a job that got paid.

Harry was starting to wonder if he could get away with leaving Pansy for a few minutes to go and get the map and try to find them when Hermione walked down the staircase.
“Yeah, but you were Gryffindor enough to do it in the first place.” Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out one of his Chocolate Frogs, handing it to Neville.
“You will come to practice with the team. You will do what I ask without complaint or question, but as far as alternate?” Flint smiled. “Let’s call you more of a water boy.”
Fudge shifted in his seat, looking like someone had just tried to shove raw asparagus stalks up his arse.
Goyle had been sentenced too, as well as a couple of fourth years who Harry assumed had dates with upper years, and a girl in the year above him named Cordelia. Harry had seen her in the library studying fiercely, like her hair was about to be set alight if she didn’t finish reading or writing what was in front of her in that moment. Harry had witnessed her shake down seventh years for books, but even she fell in line when Pansy started barking orders.
Draco’s stomach lurched. What had Harry told them? Did he already mention that he wanted another partner? Had he told people what had happened at dinner? Did he think that Draco truly hadn’t given up his former views after all and thought that the higher ups deserved to know?
But Harry wouldn’t. No, he would cherish it if he got the opportunity. He would, he promised himself.
“I agree,” said Blaise and Millicent gave him an “I told you so” look. “Unless,” said Blaise. “It was something really worth it.”
Draco walked on as if he hadn’t heard his name come out of Potter’s loud, though, very delectable mouth.
Hermione laughed trying to pretend like it was no big deal. “It’s nothing. She just looks at me funny.”
“Yeah,” said Goyle defending him. “It’s why he always beheads them before he does anything else if they’re used in Potions.”
“Because I’ve been on call for four days straight,” Harry defended himself, though they both already knew the truth, Draco just liked to give Harry a hard time. Harry knew that he no longer meant it, and that they worked together better than any other aurors in the field. It was nice now that Harry understood his humor and that they were not just partners, but that they were now friends
Harry huffed, feeling all sorts of wobbly as Ely showed him the other side of his politician’s persona, the one who gets the information they want at any cost.
Harry thought he heard Flint utter, “That’s what I’m afraid of.” But what he clearly heard was a dejected Flint telling Snape that he would do as he asked.
It’s handle glittered as he picked it up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.
They tried to remain quiet, but Scabbers wasn’t having any of it. “I can’t hold him….Scabbers, shut up, everyone’ll hear us….”
Guys this is a short update because I needed to slightly rewrite the second task. But the good news is that there will be two updates for next week to make up for my lack of direction. I do hope you like this chapter though. Finally some Drarry interaction, and there will be more next week of course.
“Don’t blame me for that. It wasn’t my fault that my incompetent partner landed us both in an Elmer’s lock. We were glued to each other for two days Gra….Weasley. Two days.”
Hermione scanned the forest, but Fred, George, Millicent, and Ginny were nowhere to be found. The forest was packed with other people, just not the people that they were looking for. They encountered a group of teenagers arguing in what Harry thought was French. Hermione mentioned that they must be students from Beauxbatons, another wizarding school.
Just as Harry was about to comment, Snape brushed into the room his midnight black robes swirling behind him.
Thankfully someone thought to cast a warming charm over the platform that they were on. The way Malfoy looked you would have thought they did it just for him.
“Aw,” said Dumbledore as the odd looking man, clunked his way into the Great Hall. “May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher? Everyone, Professor Moody.”
The next day at an unreasonably early hour, Remus, Sirius, and Harry headed to the Ministry. Harry had heard from Ron in a short letter telling him that they would be there after the hearing, but he hadn’t heart from any of his Slytherin cohorts. Millicent, may or may not have heard, the Ministry it seemed was trying to keep things underwraps, no doubt for a bigger splash when his guilty verdict was announced in the Prophet. Merlin, how he hated that rag. They should add the outdated copies hoarded in Grimmauld Place to a bonfire at his celebration party.
“I can do this. I can do this. I can do this,” she chanted. She steeled herself with a look in their direction and dropped into the blackness.
Ron had another reaction. He quit his job as an auror and went to work at the joke shop with George. He said that he was getting to old for all the running around they had to do, but late one night, Draco heard Ron confess to Harry that he just couldn’t bear to see any more blood.
He looked at Remus and the two had a quick unspoken conversation before Remus spoke, “So, what’s your plan?”
“Harry,” whispered Warrington, “take my body back, take it back, show them all. And…and tell Ely, that he’s the exact opposite of what I hate the most. Please, Potter, please,”
Unfortunately, not everyone was as entranced. Draco was halfway across the yard about to pass Dumbledore’s tomb so he could get to the gate and apparate the heck out of there when he heard, “Malfoy!”
There were days when it felt like Harry was his, today was one of those days. They were on a stakeout, seventy-two hours without sleep or normal wizarding comforts, when their relief had finally showed up. To far to apparate and too covert a mission to register a portkey they had taken refuge in one of the ministry approved safe houses until they could rest up, eat something substantial and take a blessed, blessed shower. They dragged themselves into the one room safe house, and Harry fell to his knees in relief.
He walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a crescendo inside him. Then he entered the enclosure.
“Oi, Potter!” a voice said and the lights flicked back on. Goyle through back his hood, holding onto his eye. Pansy Parkinson was laughing hysterically in the corner and Millicent was finally able to pull herself out of Crabbe’s hold on her.
Pansy looked horrified as she watched the scene across the side of the water, but Harry had been so sure. Was so sure that the Patronus that he had seen had somehow been cast by his father. He had thought it was a miracle or an apparition, but….but then.
“Harry Potter will do the task!” squealed the elf. “Dobby knew Harry Potter had not found the right book so Dobby did it for him.”
“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.”
“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the library. He said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on.”
Pansy waited beside Harry barely making a sound. Pansy shuddered beside him as the sky started to darken.
“I shoulda known there was something’ fishy goin’ on then. He loved that motorbike, what was he givin’ it ter me for? Why wouldn’ he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he’d bin the Potter’s Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter o’ hours before the Ministry was after him.”
“Do you think, Professor, that when I can cast a Patronus properly, I mean, that I won’t be able to hear them anymore?”
“Show me, Draco, please. Just fucking show me.” He pulled, grabbing ahold of Draco’s sweatpants. His shirt had rolled up during their scuffle. Realizing this, Draco reached to pull it back down, but as the waistband of his pants fell just a little lower he felt Harry’s frantic movements stop and heard him suck in a breath. Draco reached slowly to move his clothes back to where they belonged, but knowing it was too late. Draco scrambled to his feet, face hot, sweat down his back over the mark he had fought for two years to convince himself didn’t exist.
“The Goblet of Fire is an extremely rare and powerful magical object and only someone of great power and knowledge could have hoodwinked it. Barty, Ludo, you two are in charge of the tournament and this decision will have to be up to you,” said Dumbledore.
Harry also had to bite his tongue at Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon agreeing to take him back next summer as long as he stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas and Easter.
Sirius stuttered. “I had to get out.” Then he seemed to straighten. “And now, now I can get my revenge.”
“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting—it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”
“It’s back,” he said softly. “They will all have noticed it…and now, we shall see…now we shall know….”
No, Harry thought instantly. If there was one thing he had learned so far about being Slytherin was that any sign of weakness would be pounced on, and he didn’t need to give anyone any more reason to look at him. He was going to duel Malfoy and Neville was going to be his second. Next, they had to talk to Ron.
Okay, now Draco’s body was demanding an answer because even his ears had heard Harry say, “Wrestle me to the bed.” Not for it.
They found Mr. Weasley sitting at the bar, reading the Daily Prophet, Sirius Black’s photo on the cover.
“He’s already killed a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street. Do you really think he’d not be able to do it again?”
Harry had been wondering the same thing. It made sense as to why Black had automatically went to the tower in search of Harry, but why had he left witnesses?
Harry felt a thump to his back. Malfoy had bumped into him then sneered, scrunching his pointy face until he caught sight of Millicent.
Professor Snape's office was nowhere Harry wanted to be. With the jars of disgusting and vile potions ingredients and the general damp smell to the air it was nothing like the common room with it's plush furniture, ornate golden details, or the fire that was constantly blazing.
Thanks for reading. I don't own H.P. obviously. I just love them all. Comment, please. I love to hear what you guys think. Follow me on Tumblr at inkdrinkershadowsinger. Thanks a million. And Jo, if you're reading this, call me. I have an idea.
“It’s okay, Rose,” he told her, looking to Hermione for a cloth, but Harry was already there. Harry handed him a wet towel from the diaper bag and wiped Rose’s face and also dapped at Draco’s shoulder.
Millicent, Hermione, Ron, the twins, Neville, Blaise, and begrudging looking Goyle trotted into the room even as Madam Pomfrey touted, “Only five minutes.”
“From your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore. “What happened between you and Quirrell is a complete secret so of course the whole school knows. I believe Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it.”
“Where are we?” she whispered when she realized that Harry was prepared to get bitten then to be heard by anyone.
Murray laughed manically as Draco felt the other man grab at his feet. Draco kicked wildly. This wasn’t happening, this wasn’t happening. He screamed then, desperate for anyone to hear him, to help him. He screamed for the one person who has always been there. “Harry!” Draco screamed. “Harry, please!”
The day I left, my parents told me that Mrs. Tizzy would be retiring. I nodded, assuming that meant that Mrs. Tizzy would be sent to our winter estate or something to do light labor instead of the steady work that she was doing then.
Now Harry cackled. Madam Pince gave them a sharp look. They both had to put their hands over their mouth as they spotted Pansy eyeing Hermione through the stacks like an overeager crush.
Draco sat at the table numbly, staring at his empty plate when Harry Potter's voice cut through the din, his laugh ringing clear. Draco looked up and over towards the Gryffindor table to where Harry sat with his friends; the mud-blood and blood traitor. He was curious over what had him laughing so hard when he noticed Harry look over at him, grin, and give a little wave before laughing even harder. Heat flooded his face as he promptly stood, silencing his friend’s conversations.
"What? But... but how? I don’t remember that ever happening! How… how could I ever do that? Why?” Harry whitened in shock and horror at Draco’s words. He scrambled back in his memory, but that evening was so blurred that he barely remembered anything, which is why he thought they had fought. He could remember faintly Draco confessing his feelings, some yelling, and his leaving the room.
“What the hell Vincent?!” Draco cried out, startled at the loud noise and the overbearing presence of the larger boy at his back, as he whipped around to have his back to the hall door, looking wildly around himself. Blaise and Vincent looked on with shock written clearly across their faces at the smaller blonde in front of them.
Draco, panicking and attempting to break free from Harry's strong hold on him, bit down on Harry's tongue causing him to pull away quickly and free the blondes wrists at the same time.
The walk seemed to go on forever along the way, his footfalls unsteady, and he nearly tripped himself several times as they made their way in complete silence. On entering the hospital wing, Harry only became aware as he hurt Madame Pomfrey rushing around a lone bed, frantically waving her wand and uttering spells beneath her breathe along side Snape and Dumbledore.
“How can I?! You are treating me as a pariah and I have no idea why! I have been thinking and thinking over in my mind what besides the normal to have you hate me so much! What is your problem?” Harry loudly blurted out with a confounded look on his face. “I know we must have had a fight when you came to confess your feelings to me, but I don’t remember doing anything to deserve this treatment! I thought you loved me!”

Harry felt the tears that threatened to fall as he looked down at Draco’s hand, his thumb unconsciously brushing across the others knuckles, as the events of the evening ran over and over in his mind. He didn’t even try to stop them as he relived everything that Draco hurled at him before jumping and the fall. He started to lightly chew on his lower lip while he was thinking.
“Hello Mr. Malfoy. How can I help you today?” The kind, larger woman smiled at him, but he could tell she was running her eyes over his body looking for injury or illness. She stopped when she reached his face. “Appears as though you have a pretty bad headache there Mr. Malfoy.” She tsked and took him by the chin and gently turn his head side to side ensuring there was no injury that needed to be dealt with that could be causing the headache. “The pain reducing potions I have require that I give all students who require them a quick physical to ensure that there will be no ill effects.”
''I wasn't out with Pansy last night.'' He looked up and glared at Blaise who grinned down at him. ''Where did you get that idea?''
“Harry, I have a confession to make, and please before you make any comments, please just hear me out.” He stared at Harry’s profile, watching at the other boy turned to face him, indicating he was listening. “I am being fully candid and honest with you, but if you don’t believe me, you can just ignore and forget everything and just walk out of here unhindered okay?” Harry nodded in agreeance to the blonde’s words, listening carefully and respectfully to him.
"Well? What is it? Do you really want me to go that rough on you?" Draco's eyes grew even wider in his terror.
“I only reacted to you like that because you treated me even worse than ever! I assumed we fought, and I said or did something that pissed you off. I don’t really have any memories of that night, I was drinking prior to going to see you, and maybe I drank too much and hurt you, but I’d never do something like that. Not to you, not to anyone. You’ve got to believe me!” He plead inching closer to Draco, his hands raised palms up in submission.
Draco blinked in the brilliant light suddenly appearing in his sight as he winced from the pain of laying prone on his back. As he squinted, he noticed the worried face of Professor Dumbledore looking down at him holding his wand up with the tip lit up, causing him to flinch back from him with a moan of pain.
''What’s wrong? Tell me Draco!'' He tightened his hold on the panicking blonde as he noticed tears building up in his eyes. Blaise relaxed his hold on him, pulling the smaller boy up into his lap holding him tightly as Draco’s control over himself released into trembling, heart breaking sobs.
"You little bastard!" Harry raged before reaching out and grabbing Draco by the hair and slapping him hard enough to split his lip. "You really are a snake, aren't you?!" Slamming Draco in to the wall, Harry let him slide to the floor.
''What the bloody hell? Where did she get that idea from?'' He rubbed his face before standing up to grab clean clothes before crawling back onto his bed, closing the curtains to dress. Sitting on the bed, he unbuttoned and pulled his shirt off, gently touching the bruises on his arms from his encounter with Potter. He could feel tears building up, but he blinked them away, not allowing them to appear as he refused to appear weak. He quickly peeled off the rest of his clothes, pulling the clean ones on before opening the curtains and stepping out into the room where Blaise stood waiting for him.
''Draco, what’s wrong?'' Pansy's concerned filled voice barely reached his ears when he turned and rushed out of the hall towards the potions class in the dungeons. He didn't take notice when Harry Potter got up from his table and followed him out.
At that moment, as it hit Harry that Draco was gone, he groaned loudly before folding over himself as the tears started to fall down his face. This was all his fault. All of it. His heart ached painfully, and he hugged himself tightly. Draco was gone and it was all his fault. There was nothing he could do to change that.
He could hear Blaise and Gregory whisper worriedly across the chamber from him. He couldn't hear what was being said, but he knew that he was the center of their discussion. Moaning softly, he pulled the pillow over his head, trying to block out their voices as he closed his eyes and fell into a fitful sleep.
"Urm, should I let the whore cum this way?" Harry asked while giving Draco's nipples a hard twist and grinning down at his flushed, tear streaked face, terror clearly visible. "Ah, my bitch likes this does he?" Harry asked him, raising one his eyebrows. "Tell me...Do you like it?" Harry asked again as he continued his slow torture of Draco's body.
"You. Have. To. Keep. Still. Draco." Harry growled out in a gruff, deep voice as he bit down on his collarbone causing a sharp, almost sensual pain, causing him to blush uncontrollably. Harry noticing this, grinning down at his reddening face and started to play with the nipples with his long fingers causing him to groan as the sensation was being to register sharp and clear in his groin region.
'' 'Morning Draco! What were you doing last night?'' She pulled him to a stop before moving around him to stand in front of him, putting her face up close to his. ''I missed you.'' She added coyly, smiling seductively up at him.
Exhausted, he pulled himself out of his bed with a splitting headache. I need to see Madame Pomfrey for something to kill this headache off. Grumbling, he straightened his clothing and left the dormitory for the hospital wing to see about getting a pain reducing potion.
Draco’s heart was racing as his breath came in short gasps, his face draining of blood. His eyes were wild and looking around him frantically, before he shoved his way past Blaise and ran out of the dorm, and deeper into the dungeons. He ignored as the other two called his name and tried to follow him, but he raced even faster to get away from them.
"Did that hurt?" After blinking for a few minutes, Harry slapped him hard. "Wake up! Did that hurt?"
He carefully peeled off his long-sleeved shirt before kicking his pajama bottoms and pants off, tossing the lot to the side. He worked quickly to unwrap his arm, wrapping the dirty dressing in toilet paper and throwing them in the trash bin. Running his fingers over the cuts, he smiled softly to himself before turning the taps on and stepping under the running water.
It felt like a dream. The angry words that he hurled at Harry, the look of hurt and confusion written clear across his face before he jumped off the tower. The fall itself was not in of itself terrifying although he supposed it should be. He felt almost a relief that his pain and all of this would be behind him as the hard ground drew closer and closer before he felt unbelievable pain which sent him blissfully into the darkness.
I’m sorry this chapter is so late. I’m dealing with severe and crippling depression and I’ve just recently been discharged after being hospitalized for over a month. I’m sorry. I will try better in the future.
Harry abruptly got up and stumbled his way out of the hospital wing and ran through the corridors filled with mingling students, his tears blinding him. He left the castle and ran to the edge of the lake where he collapsed on his knees sobbing. He took out his wand, whispering a spell to himself and sliced both of his wrists open.
“No. That can’t be!” Draco cried horrified. He took one look at the woman before pushing himself off the bed and running out of the infirmary, ignoring the cries of the woman behind him.
"No... Harry! Don't do this! Please...please Harry! Let me go. I won't talk about this to anyone! I promise!" His begs fell on deaf ears as Harry's grin only grew bigger.
He found himself in the Room of Requirement, it was dressed as it had been when he first went to make his confession to Harry. He sat down into one of the comfortable arm chairs angled facing each other in front of a merrily burning fire, looking at his watch in nervousness. His fingers fiddled with the helm of his cloak as he bounced his leg in anxiety. This was it, he was going to make his confession, Harry would laugh, and they’d go back to hating each other in peace. Or if things went right, they’d be together fighting in this coming war.
“Draco… Draco look at me.” Draco turned his gaze back to Harry’s. “Look, I can see what you are thinking. No matter what may have occurred between us, you said you were pregnant. You don’t want to do this to the baby Draco.” Harry backed away a few steps and spoke softer and lower in tone.
His mind was a blank as he was gently grasped by warm hands that helped get him to his feet, steadying him as they led him out of the gathering crowd to follow the path that Draco was taken on, not conscious of the fact that he too was being led to the hospital wing as well.
''You can let me go now. Please.'' Blaise released the blonde only to catch notice of his reddened face as he moved to sit beside him, watching as he pulled his knees up to his chest. They sat in awkward silence until Blaise cleared his throat softly.
“Mr. Malfoy, can you lay back? I need to perform a more in-depth examination of your abdomen to be on the safe side.” She said as she helped him to lay back. She murmured some more, moving her wand in circles above his abdomen. She started to frown as she did so. “Interesting. Very interesting.” She flicked her wand and put it away as he sat up on the edge of the bed.
Draco sat up and shook his head at him. ''I honestly don't know why I am dating her.'' He muttered as Vincent and Gregory noisily left the room.
“Just stop and sit still.” Harry said sternly, looking at the small blonde, trembling against him. “Obviously you can’t look after yourself, so just let me do it.” He finished washing Draco’s face gentle before releasing his hold on him, getting to his feet. “We might as well go have our talk now. You came to tea quite late, and when I left there was barely anyone left who would see us.” He held his hand out for Draco to take, which he did, letting the Raven pull him to his feet gently.
Draco stirred quietly under his covers in the dark that the heavy bed curtains drowned his bed in. He was not awake, but he was not quite asleep either. Like flashes of lightening, he relived the rape, over and over, feeling Harry’s breath on his body, the hard touches that felt like they were scorching him with their heat, and the pain. Oh god. The pain. Jumping through his body like a freight train, giving no reprieve, no end to his suffering. He tossed himself to his side, curling into himself as he murmured under his breath things he never could say in his waking hours. That’s how he found himself when he woke a few hours later, exhausted and covered in sweat, achy and trembling. Groaning softly to himself, he peeked through his bed curtains to find that the others will still all nestled in their beds sleeping or hiding in them. Who knew as their bed curtains were still drawn against the bright morning. Either way, he would have uninterrupted access to the shower. He slipped from beneath his sheets, stopping only to grab fresh school robes and to slip into the shared bathroom.
“Okay, Mama.” his eyes never once leave his brother, Draco’s hand went to Jamie’s messy hair, caressing it fondly, “Mama loves you Jamie, all three of you,”, declared Draco to his son so he knows that although Draco gave birth to two more children, he still loves Jamie as the first day he hold him in his arms.
They were still chatting when they walked off the train, Cassie was already walking ahead of them with Daphne Greengrass.
When all of them are sitting down, Pansy announced that they were going to play Truth or Dare. Before they started, Draco spoke up, ‘You know what, I’m getting tired now’, as he fake his yawned and ready to stand up.
“Yes I know Rissa, it’s like birthing a demon’s spawn, you’ve been spitting the accusation since we started dating,” he finished her sentence.
With James on his arms, he walked slowly and carefully to the couch to take a rest since his son has drained his energy on finding him and making dinner for his family.
Draco did warned her about being friends with Granger but she ignored his warning. It’s not that he doesn’t want Cassie to be friend with Granger, it just he doesn’t want to listen to Father’s wrath about blood purity, he was sick listening to the same thing over and over since he could remembered.
He examine some object with interest but nothing caught his eyes like the Hand of Glory does, it was a brilliant invention that only the holder could see through the darkness.
“I want you to scream for me”, whispered Harry into his ear. Harry’s fingers are moving furiously inside of him as he added the third and the fourth finger. His hole wrapped perfectly around his Harry’s fingers.
‘You know what Draco, the thing I said in the dormitory was true. I regretted being your best friend’, he glared at him but Draco ignored him and addressed Cassie.
Draco avoided the question by concentrating on his wand movement, but Harry did not, he stopped in his tracks on whatever he was doing, he didn’t like the question one bit. People shouldn’t assume that, to Harry, it was a sensitive topic because nobody should picture Draco with anyone else but him, but nobody knows that Draco already helped someone to warm their bed every night and it is his bed, The Chosen One in every way possible.
When Draco’s lips on his, the flames in him ignite, the burst of love he had for Draco kept on expanding as the year went by and he knows it was never going to die between them.
Jamie was hugging him tightly, not wanting to let him go, hiding his face on his chest. He rubbed his son’s back, waiting for the right moment to ask him.
“When I call your name, you will be put on the hat  and sit on the stool to be sorted”, she said. ‘Abbott, Hannah!’
Their cock are brushing against each other, Harry sank one finger inside his tight hole, feeling the cold lube he wasn’t aware of, Draco’s hand brushed through Harry’s messy black hair, curling his fingers tightly and moaned his husband’s name, burying his face on Harry’s soft but messy curly hair.
Draco sits beside the black haired boy while Cassie sits beside the Ginger head. All of them were silent until Cassie started the conversation. While Cassie was talking, Draco noticed that the ginger head was glancing at them weirdly, the boy pursed his lips.
‘ PANSY! BLAISE! DO SOMETHING, I’M UNDER PRESSURE RIGHT NOW’, shouted him at them when he saw they stood at the door, wide eyes looking at the hideous troll.
‘But Sirius Black was in Gryffindor and you two have a lot in common, and I can see your recklessness too, so much like your father’, the hat chuckled and shook himself around his head. The hat then continued.
He turns his back on them and walks away, eyes are blurry with tears that he can’t hold on to it anymore. Finally, when he was out of the manor and apparate to his house. When he entered, he was whimpering. His mothers portrait of course hears it.
‘What was that for?’, he asked her but her attention was towards the Gryffindor. She was helping Longbottom from Crabbe and Goyle.
‘Potter, did you know our lovely Draco right her-’, Draco cuts her off by shoving food in her mouth, stood up and addressed to them that he are going to Potion. Without waiting for a reply, he quickly walked away and out of the Great Hall to the empty Potion Classroom since some students are still in the Great Hall.
Harry was taking his paternity leave for a month to help his husband. Harry informed Draco that he might extend his leave for another month and Draco was fucking grateful for that.
He gave a tiny cry as he sucked on his nipple, both Draco and Harry were looking down on their son in their arms, Draco bent his head and gave tiny kisses on the baby’s head.
‘ What is she doing with her?!’’, said Draco bitterly. He had no problem with students from Gryffindor excluding Weasley and Potter since Sirius was a Gryffindor but he do have problem with Granger. She’s a nuisance, always one step ahead of him and he didn’t like it one bit.
He coughed, ‘You look quite nice today, Professor. Where do you buy those magnificent looking cloaks?’.
‘I’m not mad at you, just at Nott’, she sighs heavily, arms crossed each other. The winter air hits them as they were walking outside. She was breathing heavily as her mouth and nose producing a small, misty cloud from her breath.
He rushed inside the building, greeted his co-workers and went inside the staff’s room to change into his suitable waiter’s attire, dropping his bag in the locker.
‘Charming Mr Goldstein, hope they share the same sentiment’, said Slughorn. He turned his attention back to the class and address that they are going to brew a love potion. The sounds of loud squealed from the girls rang through the class but Slughorn waves them off saying that the love potion is not a strong love potion because it will last for five minutes in case anyone trying to spike other’s drinks. Besides, no one would have to taste the Amortentia.
“You shouldn’t joke like that. Neville is already afraid and you make him even more terrified”, said Potter after ten minutes of walking silently beside each other with Fang sniffling the ground.
While Draco is sleeping, he accio his phone and levitate it over their body, taking multiple of pictures with the same position; Draco’s on top of him while his hands explore his Baby’s body, coming down to his round arse, squeezing the flesh until soft whimpered coming out of his baby’s mouth.
As he drank the potion, he body felt better and his head felt lighter than before. His eyes aren’t puffy and blurry anymore. He handed the empty vial back to Severus.
“As I was saying-”, he tuned out the conversation, suddenly his head got a big whacked from Cassie’s strong palm. “Ouch- what was that for?”, asked Draco as he rubbed the area that got hurt.
Severus examined him and nodded her head at Professor McGonagall, she then walked back and out of the classroom with Potter leaving him with Severus and he never left alone with him, always Cassie by his side.
While waiting for the train to reach the destination, they talked about what house they would be in, Draco sits back and just committed to their conversation, he too would make a joke about something that they were talking about.
“Harry James Potter! Stop this! I’m trying to read!” he whispers harshly, he feels a prickle of tears slowly falling down to his cheek. He was frustrated! Why can’t his boyfriend understand that he has to understand each topic?
‘I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy’, said Longbottom stammering his words, he had the audacity trying to defend himself but stammered at his words, Draco had to laugh because it was too funny. Both Crabbe and Goyle was laughing with him too.
He run where his leg bring him without using his brain, he runs until he came to a stop at an empty corridor. A corridor where there’s no left or right exit so the only way he could walk away is to walk back from where he came.
Harry was driving the car he just bought weeks ago with his own salary money from being a national football player in the Arsenal FC - he might add, with one hand on the steering wheel, showing off his muscular toned arm. Eyes never stray away from the road.
He held Draco for the last time and looked down at his angelic face, the baby that was made by love, a love between two merely powerful pureblood family names, his intelligent baby.
Draco realised it was Filch but he couldn't contain his laughter so he had to sniff his laugh. ‘He called his bloody cat my sweet’, as he held up his hand to his mouth, hoping the sound of his laughter won’t be too loud. ‘The cat was anything but sweet, that’s a demonic red eyed cat’, he muffled his laugh.
Draco was still persistent and played with him until Jamie all of a sudden, stood up and walked away from him to his Grandma Molly. As he watched him go, he let out a tired huff and rubbed his eyes. At the corner of his eyes, he saw that Teddy was confused at their interaction but he kept his quiet by leaving him alone with Victoire trailing behind him, walking out of the house.
“Alright - alright Jamie,” said Draco giving into his son’s demand and place the fruits inside the trolley, they continue on walking around and picked more fruits and vegetables. As they walked, they could hear whispered of ‘is that Harry Potter?’ or ‘Oh Merlin, he’s so hot’ by some girls at the age of twenty.
Father discussed about him joining the Quidditch team this year but Draco answered confidently that if Cassie are not in the team, he don’t want to be in the team.
As they saw Weasley and Potter went off, they followed them quickly, a few steps behind them so they won’t be discovered. As they were following them, they saw Severus crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.
Before Potter get the chance to speak, Slughorn clapped his hand to mark the end of the lesson. Draco packed his bag quickly as Slughorn’s voice rang through his ears, ‘Before you leave, please write a two rolls of parchment of the Amortentia and hand in before the next lesson. Thank you and you may leave the class now’, said Slughron as he walked to the front of the classroom.
Draco nodded his head as he felt Harry’s hand went from his nipples, slides down to his arse cheeks, his rough hands are peeling his arse while his mouth are trailing kisses and leaving bruises on his neck.
He breathed harshly in Draco’s ear, murmuring dirty words. His fingers came up to Draco’s perky tits, pinching the soft flesh.
Draco complied and moved Jamie to the side so he could slide in into the bed, Jamie then moved his little body closer to him and he tugged the blanket on them.
“Jamie, you have to wear this clothes. It looks handsome on you.”, begged Draco softly when Jamie refused to wear the clothes he has chosen for him to go out to the grocery shop.
Bingo, so Hagrid the oaf has a dragon egg on his hut, what an easy guess. It seems that Potter has sense his presence and that is why he told them to shut up but failed miserably because he had heard enough.
Wait, now he was confused, aren’t Quirrell fainted at the Hall half a minutes ago, how can he just woke up without feeling disorientated? Maybe they bring him to Hospital Wing, but Hospital Wing was miles away. It’s either he’s faking about it and there’s a hidden agenda.
Draco moaned into the kiss, his hand rested on his husband’s chest indicating that they should stop before it gets too intense. Harry got the memo and broke the kiss although he don’t want to, Draco then helped Harry taking his auror robe off of him and hang it on the coat stands. Draco took his hand and lead him to the kitchen.
Quirrell doesn’t even answered his question, he was avoiding it but Draco are going to let it slide, for now.
“Do you want it?” asked Draco examining the fruit and look back at his son, “Yes Mama yes! Jamie want dagon fud.”
So, he really can’t even give Jamie full of his attention even with the help of Harry with the twins. Since then, Jamie has been giving them the cold shoulder at him and Harry - mostly at Draco. He sometimes doesn’t want to listen to them, he becomes extremely stubborn than usual.
When Draco looked around, he saw he was one of the few that succeed, he smirked at his success. Potter’s broom jumped into his hand at once and he had the expression of shock, probably because it was his first try, Weasley’s broom hit him on the head, well deserved. He snorted at Weasley’s failure.
“I didn’t think you knew anything about Astronomy,” looking at his husband, impressed shown on his face, his Harry rolls his eyes at him and Draco went back to look at his son.
Bryan kept on pestering him, trying to coax the truth out of Draco, asking him multiple times who was the person that got to shag Draco Malfoy, he says that whoever that is, is the lucky guy since most of the people tried but failed miserably.
He heard Severus took a deep breath as his hand kept on running his back, up and down. Finally, after a few second of waiting for the word to come out of his mouth, he spoke.
“You smoke?” With the cigarette on her waiting hand, she took it and put it between her lips waiting for Celestial to help her light it up.
‘What should I do now?’, asked Potter after he was done dropping the egg into the boiling cauldron. The heat of the room made Draco rolled up his sleeve, the arm where he was not branded with the dark mark. Potter’s hair are messier than usual, he just realized that Potter took of his school robe showing his broad shoulder and built body that made his stomach has butterflies.
“Please move baby.”, begged Draco seconds later when he was comfortable , he tugged Harry’s body closer to him. Harry’s mouth went back to attack his neck as his body move continuously forward and backward.
This old man really loves people’s misery because he don’t have any great life but he did succeeded in making his body paralyze and his legs glued to the ground. Even Longbottom was holding on to Potter tightly.
Draco never felt this feelings before because Father was not the type of person that shown emotion, he was a cold heartless man so he doesn’t think that he needs a father figure who shown emotion but he do now after what had the mirror show him.
“Hi Harry,” greeted Hermione from the door, walking slowly, she too was pregnant and her due date was in four more months, Ronald was beside him, guiding her to them.
Cassie walks inside and sits beside him at the edge of the bed, her presence brings him comfort. They sat there silently for a while. She then handed him the photograph of his family.
Before this Jamie was crying soundlessly, trying to not make any noise but right now, it was a full blown tantrum of anger, he was trying to let out his displeasement. He was punching him so he could get away from Draco, lightly since he was still a toddler and not much energy and strength he possessed.
“Nothing great about you I realised,” she lied and then she realised her mistake because she just sounds out-right cruel.
“What I mean is that you and Malfoy are always together nowadays so it was kinda weird not seeing her with you.”
“No, Mama -wuww you more”, assured Jamie but the way he hold on to his father like a lifeline says otherwise. With Jamie on Harry’s arms, he walks towards him on the couch, bend down and kiss his temple lovingly.
‘What’s the point of having a friend like Weasley anyways, it will bring you nowhere, he’s not that smart, kept on following Potter around like a dog and think everyone is better than him just because he befriended the boy who lived’.
One finger turns into more, he goes from slow and steady, carefully fingering Draco opened to his cock, to furiously jabbing four fingers inside.
Draco crawled into the bed and drew the curtain around him, putting Silencio so no one’s going to know what he's going to do. He called for Dobby quietly but harshly for the second time when the elf doesn’t appear.
They were silent for a while, content with everything, “Look at me, Draco,” ordered Harry as he put the tip of his finger under his chin, pushing it upward.
‘How about we just go back to the common room and sleep on our comfy bed?’, interfered Longbottom, looking scared but he was determined to get the word out of his quivered mouth.
He knew if he did tell Professor McGonagall, Potter will be one of them and it can’t be Weasley because he had a dragon bite infection so his arms must be weak, if he have to guess then it’s going to be Granger. So two people carrying the dragon? Are they strong enough for two?
He felt the cold liquid of the lube. Harry probably wordlessly and wandlessly spell his fingers with lube or reached for their bedside table for the table before waking him up but either way, he knows their are getting an action today.
The Malfoy’s are still the pureblood purist the Wizarding World known as, still looking down at their inferior but that doesn't affect Draco's personality at all. He respects all people and the house elves, He is friends with a house elf named Dobby, Dobby and he loves to play together when he was little but when Father found out, he was furious.
He slumped down in the middle of the room, tears streaming down his face. He tried to search for an answer.
Again with the damn marks, he tried his best, he doesn’t succeed, that doesn’t mean he’s a failure. He did better than Cassie so why must he brings his marks up for the conversation, it was unnecessary.
“The one that scared of Draco Malfoy wouldn’t want to kiss her”, said Draco while he was thinking about the faceless stranger that are going to kiss his sister one day, he shakes his head at the thought of it.
Harry introduced their new babies to his best friends while Draco just lay on the bed looking at him, grateful for having Harry in his life, when he was a kid, he never thought that he could have a family he loved very dearly from heart because father would always tells him that marriage is an obligation to the Pureblood custom but once in Eighth Year, Harry was trying to court him with the help of Hermione and Ron, he threw his so called ‘obligation’ to the window.
“Oh nothing,” he got back up. “Where are you going?” grabbing his hand, trying to force him back down beside him. He do wanted to, he wanted Harry’s body on top of him because he craved sex but they didn’t have the time to do more thing than kissing.
“You look like a cute angry white kitten. I love you,” pinching his pale cheeks and taking the food out from the picnic basket.
“How’s my husband and my babies are doing today?”, asked Harry as he set Jamie back on Draco’s lap, and strip out of his auror robe.
“Only work a quarter time job when I’m not busy with uni work, helping Mother here and there. Tell me when you guys are ready to order,” eyes scanning through the family until it rests on his old time crush who was looking at him stunned for some reason.
By the end of their sex activity, Draco was tired and sweaty. His brain was fried from the intense love making. Harry’s sticky cum are leaking out of his hole and he loves it.
It has been four weeks since the start of the school year, lessons have been interesting especially Transfiguration, Astronomy, Potion and Charms. His least favourite subject is Defence Against The Dark Arts, Professors Quirrell stutters makes him want to jump off the Astronomy Tower but he can’t because he is just a first year.
He scrolled through her Instagram account without a word, his big finger swiftly tapped on Draco’s account which he was delighted when he could see his feed full of photos of Draco smiling, doing some action and a few pictures of him with his friends group.
‘Okay okay you want a perfect tik tok video? I gave you one!’, because he had given up, right now he just want to lay his head on Harry’s shoulder or just be with him in general.
Harry used his unoccupied hand and squashed Draco’s cheeks with his index finger and thumb, turning his face to look at him. He wants to come while looking at his precious baby angel.
“But I don’t think you are a Malfoy, you are confused about yourself,” continued her again. What does she mean he’s confused? “Your head is full of Whackspurt, it makes people’s brains become unfocused and confused,” she explained her theory as one hand up in the air, waving it on the thin air as if she’s trying to chase out the Whackspurt.
Thanks for reading until the end. I read The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and let me tell, it's devastating.
“Mrs Malfoy, our relationship has nothing to do with your so-called ideology. There is nothing wrong when two women are in a relationship or two men perhaps. You should be happy that your daughter is happy. Isn't that what this war is about? To realise our mistakes.”
“I’m- fuck Harry- I’m gonna cum”, whimpered Draco beneath him, he was fucking Draco so hard like there is no tomorrow. He pushed himself into Draco frantically, the creaking sound of the bed made as he kept on fucking him hard.
Why does everyone have an emergency today? First, Mother and now Anne? At least Mother has told him that she has entrusted the chef to close the restaurant so he can go home exactly when his work hour is done.
‘ This way!’ Potter mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armour. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Draco who looked over at Cassie and their eyes meet, she gesture her hand, pointed her finger to him and moved her finger to her neck, gesturing her finger movement into a slit motion and mouthed, ‘You are dead’
His eyes were met with the messy black hair boy he last saw in the robe shop. There is a boy with ginger haired with him.
“Draco, Come! I have business elsewhere after this, I do not want to waste more of my time today”, called father. He place his hand back down and walked away from the odd cabinet.
Professor McGonagall face was red with fury, lips turning white as she pressed her bottom and upper lips tightly. He can feel it, they are going to feel the wrath of Professor McGonagall . Severus was looking at Cassie and him up and down, searching for any injury.
“Harry Potter”, murmured Dobby, Draco almost didn’t hear what Dobby said but he heard ‘Potter’ so he knows what he is saying.
He starts the engine and Draco took over the radio because Harry has a bad music taste and Harry doesn’t actually care about it anyways, Harry took a hold of the steering wheel with one hand, showing off his muscular arm as he clenched his hand purposely because he knows Draco are watching him with lust while his other hand are closing the car door.
What’s the point of being one of the most famous restaurants when you couldn’t even afford a lot of waiters? Actually she can but there’s more customers today than before. Let’s just hope that his mother didn’t hear his internal monologue.
I don't know if I like this Chapter or not but I hope you enjoy it. At first I want to write until Draco's sorting ceremony and skip the 1/2/3/4 until the end of 5th year where Sirius fell into the veil and continue on 6th year but I decided that I'm gonna write through the year, so this fic might take a while, but let me know what you think about it because your comments brings me comfort, so yeah love you guys and thank you for reading. And one more think, I'm gonna post the 4 chapter in two or three weeks from now because I haven't finish the 5th, sorry for the inconvenience.
“It’s because I said so, do not ever question me!”, with the last comment, he stood up and walked away.
The party was held till Midnight, Draco and Cassie were both tired and out of their mind so when the last family left, they ran towards their respectful room and changed into their silk sleepwear.
“Back off with the threat for a while. You can kick me or slam the door in my face or even do any physical harm you can think of but right now, my priority is you so what do you need?” asked Harry as he pushed the door wide open.
“I’m close Harry.”, said Draco when he can feel the intensity on his cock. He knew he was going to come undone- as he spread his legs wider on the ground.
“Just let me get your number, you are fucking pretty - Besides, it’s not like your husband is the Boy-Who-Lived anyways,” pushing the stranger to give his number to him.
At last, he finally spoke, “ Remus, I- I- can't be James and Lily's secret keepers, there will be too many trouble, The Death Eater killed my wife for it, I - I- just can't, I'm sorry,” he was stuttering while wiped the tears off his face.
“Yeah, definitely angel like you”, teased Harry sarcastically. Draco was pinching Jamie soft chubby cheeks while he was playing with Draco’s long platinum blonde hair.
He scoffed at the girl’s behaviour, “I mean kissing an older student would be cool but kissing your sister is even better,” Draco nodded his head along to whatever Blaise was was saying but when he heard that Blaise would like to kiss his sister, he had to draw a line over there.
“Aren’t the both of you a pumpkin pie”, mocked Cassie as she was looking down at the camera in her hand, the photo she just took of him and Dobby. She showed her great picture taking skill to him. He regrets teaching her how to work the camera.
Potter released their entwined hands and clutched his forehead. Oh dear Merlin, he don’t want to die young, he still have some achievement he wanted to achieve.
When he realized something, his eyes were wide open with the realization, his mouth was hanging open, he looked down at the newspaper and showed it to his sister, her sister's mouth too was open wide as if trying to suck up the information.
“Miss Potter - let me speak,” and Iris was so against it, she stood her ground because she didn't want her girlfriend to be sad.
He only took a few breaths and started to scream again until he heard his phone had an incoming message for him.
His husband’s sperm was so powerful that not just they are going to welcome twins into the world but even his son looked exactly like him with the same messy hair, same facial feature but with Draco’s grey eyes and that’s the advantage of being the ‘The Boy Who-Lived Twice’ but he hopes Jamie got his eyesight from him because Harry’s eyesight are horrendous.
He could scared her off by jumping from her behind but father told them to touch nothing the shop, what if father saw what’s in his hand is an item he told him not to touch, what would father do to him.
Harry chuckled at it as his mouth was still firmly attached on his nipple. He don’t know when he loss his consciousness but save to say that they had a blissful night.
Draco’s cheeks flushed as he heard the word that came out of his mouth, he nodded his head frantically. Draco stand on his tippy toe and brushed Harry’s fringe aside, kissing the lightning bolt shaped scar he had on his forehead since he was one.
Harry broke the kiss and went down on him. Leaving bruises on the way until he reached his breast. He gave his nipples full attention by licking the nubs attentively, Draco was groaning beneath him.
Fucking him multiple times on that same spot. His hand came down to Draco’s cock, jerking it when he felt his own waves of pleasure are coming.
“Because she might have actually save me from Lucius Malfoy’s wrath”, answered Draco as he was looking at her sister, he gave her the finger as her sister was looking at him snickering and smirking at his misfortune on finding the useless books.
“I thought we were supposed to look at the stars,” he chuckled but moaned seconds later when Harry continued abusing his hole.
He didn't know what was happening around him as his eyes tightly shut and his ears couldn’t pick up the conversation that was going around him but he felt Harry’s soft lips kiss his temple while he was in Harry’s arms, words of reassurance from Harry is the only thing he could hear.
After all, he was the boy who lived who defeated Lord Voldemort 17 years ago, without him the Wizarding World is doomed. Before Draco was born, he was the one to guarantee that the Malfoys didn’t get sent to Azkaban for joining the dark side.
He don’t know what to say since he was never been alone with Potter before so this is something new.
Before she gets to blow her whistle, the Longbottom kid pushes off hard. ‘Come back, boy!’ she shouted, but Longbottom was rising higher and higher - twelve feet - twenty feet, at this point, he felt that Madam Hooch was useless. What is the point of being a Quidditch teacher when she can’t use her brain to mount her broom and save the boy.
Draco are on his knees, shoved his camera in his pocket, cupping Potter’s face as to look at him, the cloaked figure are coming nearer as the second passed.
Sounding annoyed at Harry’s antics trying and succeeding in scaring them as he is speaking with Harry through his mind using the bond they shared since their mating day.
“You guys look good together,” said her hairdresser suddenly, with the scissor in her hand, going through her hair. “Uhm.. what?” The hairdresser pulled her out from admiring Celestial who was reading the magazine in her hand soundlessly.
Draco needs to concentrate his mind so he lets Jamie do whatever he wants as long as he was seated in the trolley.
Blaise were kissing someone in the corner of the room but he didn’t who did he kissed but one thing he knows is that it was a man kissing Blaise.
He let him adjust as he waited for him, his hands spreading on Harry’s chest while he held on to Draco’s lean waist. His knees were supporting himself against the green ground as Harry’s cock in him.
Turning his body to the side, he lay down Adrian in the middle, Jamie coming closer and laying himself down, carefully snuggling his little brother.
“Oh and if you decide to stay the night, you can stay in the room in front of Celestial’s, I know what it feels like to be a teenager,” and with a wink, she walks out of the room, pulling her husband who disapproves of the whole idea of them.
Although he was away from Hogwarts, he still can’t forget about the mirror, the image that the mirror provided for him. It was too precious to let the image go away from his mind.
‘Your Mother was a noble woman, she had her own ideology that made her disagree with your grandfather that made your grandfather fuming at her, and his last straw was when she told she wanted to marry to Sirius Black’, Draco waited for the long paused before Severus continued.
‘You are friend with Granger now? A Gryffindor?’, asked Draco, quirking his eyebrow. Pansy and Blaise both had walked to their respective dorm, probably to curse at their pillow over how reckless he is.
Tormenting Potter and Weasley was a fun ride, he loves it when Weasley all riled-up. He knows that joking about his family will make Weasley furious. So he loves to remind him that his family is poor. That’s what he got when someone dared to shame the Malfoy’s, not that he cares about Father but he cared deeply about Mother and his mom because both of them are Malfoy, either by blood and by marriage.
Harry opened the door to his room, Jamie’s room are decorated with red coloured wall on Harry insistent because Harry said that he can tell that Jamie are going to be a Gryffindor and Draco scoffed at the idea. His room is quite big and he has a twin size bed because no child of his will suffer from discomfort of a small bed.
“We don’t want Madam Pomfrey to know about your dragon bite, right? It would really be a shame for the gamekeeper to lose his job, his only job.”, said Draco evilly, waiting for Weasley to give in.
There is no way in hell he was obsessed and he refused to ever write them a letter for the rest of the summer after the bookstore incident, of course.
He saw the cloaked figure reached the unicorn, it lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and began to drink its blood.
With Jamie over two years and a half, he was really excited awaiting for his little brothers arrival to the world. He would always kiss his mama’s stomach goodnight and Draco’s cold heart melts every time at it. Harry sometimes teased him that his Slytherin Prince’s cold heart had expired.
He heard a low growl from his left, he frantically turned his head to the direction when suddenly he was being attacked by his right side, his attacker pushed him to the ground and as Draco was trying to take a chunk out of his attacker’s flesh.
“HARRY IT HURTS HARRY!” shouted Draco at his husband, changing his position on the bed, his legs are cramping, he felt nausea wash over him. The healer told him that his cervix was at 7 cm .
He took Harry’s arm, closing his fingers making it into a fist with only his pointer finger standing tall, he pointed it to the sky, slowly tracing one of the stars and then connected it to another star until it formed one complete constellation.
‘Hey, it’s not my fault you held out your hand for me to shake it when you met me the first time’, said Draco as he held out his hand to help him up.
He was bored out of his mind. He just can't wait for the party to end. He heard the doorbells ringing and the house elf opened the gate for them. Most families look at the house elf with disdain, as if they were the most disgusted creature ever and he sneered although no one could see his face.
They chatted for hours until they didn’t realize that train came to a stop, Draco and his friends were excited because they were told that Hogwarts was beautiful not by their parents but by
‘Do you see Cassie after the Longbottom incident?’ whispered Draco into his ear, Blaise shook his head no. They kept on walking until they came to a stop in front of the trophy room. Draco pushed the door lightly, the creaking sounds of the door’s making it stop whatever was happening inside the room.
“If I didn’t know better, Draco - I say you were trying to implant the house idea to our son’s head,” lifting the corner of his mouth up and raising his eyebrow.
‘I don’t have to prove myself to twat like you too’, he said while waving them off to walk away but Potter called out to him, ‘Then it’s true then, you are a coward, if you don’t prove it’, said Potter.
Life goes on, The Marauders helped him taking care of Draco although he tries to reject it many times because he doesn't want to burden his friends even more, especially Lily and James. They have so much going on with You-Know-Who and hiding from the dark side. Peter has been distant lately and never once they saw a smile on his face these days.
He brought his hand to his cock and jerked it, dribble of his cum are leaking out of him, he can feel it, his balls are tighten and a few second later, he come on his stomach while Harry was still fucking him harder and harsher.
Ten years old Draco was celebrating his birthday in the hall of the Manor. The hall was decorated with balloons and colourful banners. On the table, there is a cake. Mother invites a lot of people from the pureblood families, he was wearing a fancy suit that makes him uncomfortable but for the sake of his mothers happiness, he didn’t complain.
Professor McGonagall was explaining to the first year about the houses in Hogwarts, all the first year listened attentively except for Draco because he was halfway done with reading
The sound of Harry’s footstep indicates that he was done packing all of the essentials for the babies, he gave a quick thank to mother, carrying Draco in bridal style and disapparate both of them out of the house, leaving Jamie and mother behind.
“Uh Oh, that’s not how you should talk to someone who will tell Madam Pomfrey right away about the dragon bite.”, said Draco as he was blackmailing him, after a few minutes of thinking, he finally gave a loud sighed.
“James Sirius Potter! If you don’t come out right this instant, I am going to send you straight to grandfather Lucius’s house!” hoping that Jamie take the bait and just come out already.
“Did you do anything to Harry Potter”, asked Draco suddenly, he don’t know why he did but he knows Dobby looked up to Potter fiercely, he felt a little jealousy in him because Dobby is his friend and not Potter but he didn’t say it out loud.
He was not done yet so with him still inside of Draco, he gripped Draco’s legs with his big strong arms, he dragged Draco’s legs and throw them over his huge wide shoulders.
So, what the poltergeist was saying was true, Potter was nowhere could be found, did he have something that could make his body disappeared? Draco haven’t even master his disillusionment charm.
“But we have a fucking deal, don’t tell Hagrid on anyone.”, stated Weasley, bargaining the book for the big oaf’s job.
He was laughing so hard that he had to clutch his stomach as he bend his body forward. He almost fall to the ground himself for laughing too hard himself.
Deep in her thoughts, her legs involuntarily bring her to the Astronomy Tower. As she climbed up the stairs, there’s someone already there.
He was rubbing his eyes, trying to force himself to stay awake when a familiar fingers caressing his hair, pushing his fringe away from his eyes. He doesn’t look away from his book with his boyfriend’s action.
‘No, Draco let me kick his Gryffindor’s arse,’ said Blaise while trying to pull his arm away from Draco but he held his arm tightly. He looked back and saw that Potter looked at him with despair in his eyes and he doesn’t know why.
Father’s study room provide a couch for them to sit while there is a big cushion facing the couch. The room was surrounded with shelves full of books, on the wall, there is a hanging of their family portrait taken from three year ago before they went to Hogwarts.
“Bet you loves that, didn’t you, Potter,” he said looking purely amused and his signature smirk came crawling to his face. “Famous Harry Potter- can’t even go to a bookstore without making the front page.”, he teased him as he lifts the corner of his mouth, half smiling.
‘I DON’T BELIEVE YOU- I’M GOING TO CALL FOR FILCH SO YOU HAVE FEW SECONDS TO RUN- BYE’, waved Peeves as he floated away to find Filch.
So the only thing Draco could think of is grabbing his hand, holding onto his hand as tightly as he could so Potter wouldn’t be stupid and advance forward.
Thousands of questions running through his head without an answer as he laid on the cold floor, hugging himself to sleep. He didn’t have the strength to walk back to his common room and let his friends see him like this, an emotional wreck.
“Me out of the blue trying to talk to you? Trying to be near you?”, answered Harry as he brought their intertwined hand to his mouth, kissing Draco’s knuckles again and again.
They have been together for two years now, they’ve been through all high and low together. Harry was always there when Draco needed him, never once he wasn’t there.
It took them an hour and a half to sort through their wands, Draco bought a wand made out of hawthorn wood and has unicorn hair core, 10 inches while Cassie’s wand were made out of ash wood and has phoenix feather core, 12 inches, they were fascinated by their wand.
Draco was sick of it not going to lie so when September first came, he fisted his hand up in the air. Happy to get away from the big manor, it is quite lonely there when the people he could communicate with are Mother and Cassie - sometimes if he’s in a good mood, Father.
Shaking his numb arm, he shifted Addie and slowly rocked him, singing a French lullaby his mother used to sing to him when he was young and a stubborn toddler as his mother always said.
Blaise brings his hand to his face and rubs it rapidly hoping his sleepiness will go away. ‘ Why do I agree with this nonsense, Draco’, said Draco. ‘Sometimes, I wish I could knock some sense into you’, he continued as he rubbed his face continuously.
“Let me think about. Who knows? Maybe I might be in the bad mood on that day and the only thing that could cheer me up is you guys.”, smiled Draco wickedly. Before he gets to hear Weasley’s dull protest, he walked away from him with his book tucked under his arm.
As they were walking out of the house, Draco asked Harry if they are going to apparate to the grocery shop or Harry driving them there. “Driving is better, Jamie are going to get apparation sick since he was not use to it. Besides, he could watch the scenery on the way,” said Harry.
“Master and Mistress are waiting for Miss Celestial in the study room,” bowed the elf who greets them on the front door of the manor, bowing as low as he can get. Celestial swallowed nervously while nodding her head in acknowledgement, Stocky then apparates away to continue his work.
He was scared because he heard that the second pregnancy was worse than the first especially if they’re expecting twins.
Draco murmured his thanks as he scrunched his face in pain, holding his abdomen with his other hand, he flicked his wand and cast the Patronus charm, a dragon came bursting out of his hand, flying as it flapped its big wings around him.
The responsibility of the pack has been on his shoulders since he can remember when his parents were killed by Draco’s former pack. They met when Draco accidentally crossed their territory, running away from Riddle's pack when he was only sixteen.
Her comments make Iris laugh but the only reply she can give her is, “I see what I can do,” not in the ‘I see what I can do to break them up’ but in a ‘I see what I can do about the situation’ type of way.
Draco looked at his son and looked back at the stranger, “It seems that that’s the way of my son telling you to back off and if you don’t mind - fuck off,” emphasized at his profanity.
But now, he literally will do everything in his power to ensure that Draco is his until the end, nothing could separate them. Not even Draco’s pureblood parents.
‘Jeez, sorry you don’t have to be mean and Stop calling me Draco Black, I live with the Malfoy and they are my family,’ he rolls his eyes at the sorting hat.
“Harry, are we there yet?” asked Draco for the thousand times of excitement. He wondered where the place was and what the occasion was for.
He recorded the whole thing on his camera, the humiliation and he recorded Cassie’s face because why not. Before they walked to Hogsmeade to ride the Hogwarts train, he dragged his friends to the front of the castle, took a few group photos as he recorded the whole process of them trying to be ready for the camera.
“Though if his school marks don’t pick up,” said father, more coldly still, “ that may indeed be all he is fit for.”
“I know why you are trying to stress yourself out. Who gives a shit what your devil of a father might say. I know for damn sure that Narcissa would be proud of you no matter what marks you get. Stop trying to prove to him,” he emphasized each word so that it could get through his head.
“Does this one of the reason why you disappeared at night?”, asked Draco after thinking for a long time. When Dobby didn’t answered him, he turned his head to look at him, Dobby was nodding his head furiously.
“I’m going to take a shower first”, informed Harry to Draco, he nodded his head, opened his eyes as he watched his husband walked out of the room and quietly closing the door behind him after giving him a loving smile directed at them.
“But the problem is, I don’t want that. I don’t you to stay away from me. I tried so fucking hard to get your attention but you just kept on avoiding me and when I can’t take it anymore, I know I had to do something.”
‘But maybe next year, I might’, he gave a wide smile to him. Professor Flitwick nodded his way and he left them. As he was walking halfway away from them, he remembered that he had a question for him, he called and rushed towards him. He waved Crabbed and Goyle off as he told them to not follow him and just go the Hall by themselves.
Who is he kidding? He hates pickles since he can remember, his parents know this knowledge. Even his siblings are giving him a slight knowing smirk while looking at him from the corner of their eyes. He acted like he saw nothing, took out his phone and went into Instagram, attempting to search for Draco’s Instagram account.
He pushed again for the so many fucking times, and finally, it only took seven minutes to push the placenta out of him.
“Hello, Draco dear. How are you doing today? How are you feeling? We’ve been missing you here, Dahlia kept on asking if you are going to visit anytime soon and -,” her sentence got cut off by his own son telling her to calm down and relax.
He did brought his camera with him because he wanted to capture his first experience getting a detention.
Draco looked back at his husband, “It seem like your son only want my attention only to himself”, Harry was looking at them, amused shown on his face.
He walked towards where the bag was laid, took the bag in his with a big protest from Weasley, he can’t do anything because his body was hurting and walked back to his original position.
When the boy introduces his name, both Cassie and Draco look at each other and have a silent conversation in their brain. Cassie tilted his head towards Harry and nodded at Draco as she remembered about the conversation between them and their father.
He admitted that he was shocked when Harry bravely asked him for his number on that day when the Potters had dinner at his Mother’s restaurant.
“Don’t you want to take a break? You have been working for a week and I know for sure the whole week we haven’t been seeing each other, you must be engaging with books all the time.”
Draco knows Pansy and he knows that she going to blackmail him by telling Potter his crush on him and Draco was not ready for the world to know it. ‘You will not!’, shouted Draco.
Pansy pressed the button again and timer went on, she did a ‘basic frat boy’ movement when trying to be flirty and when the girl’s voice came up, Draco walked into the frame, confident that before but still awkward. When they were done. Pansy looked through the video again and was not impressed.
Jamie stopped crying and he looked up into his father’s emerald eyes, waiting for an answer. “Because he loves you so much that he’s sad that you are not talking to him,” continued Harry, picking Jamie up into his arms.
She loves those moments because they both are kinky bastards and proud of it. The way her back arched as he pounded her from the back, both of his hands were occupied with choking and pulling her to him.
The ‘ding’ of sound of the lift chimed in while they were laughing about something and the door of the lift opened, Harry pulled him in.
The boy’s voice rang through and Pansy did silly movement and when it was his turn to jump in, he walked into the video awkwardly.
Cassie who just now was cheerful turns cold, “What’s wrong with being a Malfoy,” she said. Her voice from cheerful turns slightly threatening.
Before Sirius walked out of the hall, he came closer to the sleeping baby and whisper for the last time, “My little dragon, I love you so much, you will always be in my thoughts and I hope you will understand why I did it, I hope when you grew up, you can forgive me for leaving you but I know this is for the best, they will take good care of you,” he kissed Draco for the last time on the forehead and on both of his cheeks.
“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!”, said an annoying voice he would love if her mouth just seal shut. He looked down at her and said, “Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” taunted Draco at the girl. She must be a Weasley since she got a red hair. The girl went scarlet as his brother and Granger fought their way over, both of them are clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books.
The next day later, when he comes down for breakfast, father acts like yesterday incident never happened and Draco acts like it never bothers him, but deep down inside of him, it took a great deal to not make it an issue.
They ended the video call after like ten minutes of talking since Mrs Potter’s screen break is over, she’s going to have to continue with her acting. Draco heard that her upcoming new movie is a horror film which is a new excitement for her since it was her first time acting in a horror film, safe to say that he was quite proud of her as if she was his mother.
She rubbed her chin with her index and thumb as she was thinking, she then looked him in the eyes with the mischief on her eyes, “What’s on your mind dear brother of mine?”
When he opened the door, he was greeted by children his age, Father always told Cassie and him to have some allies not friends because to Father, friends will bring them nothing, Draco did make a few allies and some friends, his sister and him both share the same companions.
“Then continue whatever you’re doing and don’t punish yourself anymore. Although I don’t want to be known as one of your master, I gave you my blessing to warn the Great Harry Potter”, said Draco with a hint of sarcasm at the end.
When Harry had asked —no, begged, more like— her to talk about her hopes for after the war was over, needing to hear that Hermione Granger, the smartest witch of her age, the one who planned everything, had some sort of plan for After. That she believed in an After. He prompted her, asking about what job she wanted, what she wanted to name her children, if any. What she hoped for in a husband. "Girly" things, Ron would have said, Harry had thought. He didn't care if they were "girly"; he cared if home and family and happiness and love were possibly tangible, a real desire that someone else shared.
"A sense of humor," Hermione began haltingly, a fierce blush painting her cheekbones. She'd looked away then, looking into the fire with a wistful look making her eyes seem a bit sad. "Mutual support towards our goals, trust, love, dare I say."
"They don't remember me, Harry," Hermione's whole body shuddered with the fierce sobs working their way through her body. Harry merely held her as tightly as he could, stroking his fingers carefully through Hermione's thick hair. "They don't remember their own daughter."
Hermione had leaned back from the fire, looking a bit stricken, crossing her arms and staring into it, biting her bottom lip. Classic "Debating Hermione"; Harry knew she was weighing pros and cons inside her head as she took a deep breath.
"You care for him," Hermione murmured and Harry nodded uneasily, his blush still readily apparent. "I'm glad you finally figured it all out."
She'd simply nodding, seemingly understanding his predicament and she'd started talking. About anything and everything. About Transfiguration, about how much she adored it. Hermione had confided in him that she'd always wanted to become an Animagus, and he'd given her the best smile he could offer then, because he agreed — he still did. She talked about how enthralled she'd been as a tiny first-year, learning magic for the first time, how she wanted to devour anything and everything to fit in. She talked about her thoughts on the Death Eaters, their children, how she thought maybe Draco Malfoy wasn't so bad underneath it all, probably just scorned by Harry's refusal as a child, feeling so long ago, and it compounded year after year as Harry had seemingly gained power and recognition and fame and sometimes even respect, things Malfoy probably had longed for his whole life. Harry had nodded along, a welcome distraction from Sirius, about the life he could have had with his godfather.
“We don’t even know who we are. We spent our whole adolescence as warriors. How are we supposed to know?” Hermione sighed, playing with the excess cloth of her long-sleeved tee-shirt, her wrists knobby and skin looking corpse-like.
He was an only child, the son of an aristocrat, and was considered a "freak of nature". These three facts culminated in a childhood absent of friendships typical of a young child, as well as difficulty even making friends, let alone keeping them, for the rest of his life.
"You're hoping Draco Malfoy is going to be there," Hermione noted casually. Harry, who was going to take a sip of his own tea, nearly spat it out, cheeks instantaneously flushing.
“You will release him. You will pardon him. Draco Malfoy is not a Death Eater, even if he may carry the Dark Mark,” Hermione spoke succinctly, leaving no room for argument. “He saved our lives. The Light would not have been able to defeat Voldemort without the efforts of Draco Malfoy. Check his pocket. A member of Dumbledore’s Army always has their Galleon.”
"Harry?" Hermione tentatively knocked on the door before it creaked open. Harry could hear bundles being deposited on the toilet lid and realized he forgot to collect his own clothing from his own bottomless backpack. "I'll be out here when you're ready to talk."
Father had never allowed him to accompany him to any of the Ministry galas the rich and powerful Lucius Malfoy was invited to. Mother had never had very many friends aside from Father's Ministry contacts' wives, and they hardly thought to bring their precious heirs to socialize with an "inbred, loony" child such as Draco.
"No, not really," Harry murmured, smoothing down her coils and resting his cheek against her head. "But it'll be alright."
Harry couldn't really find anything else to do except hold on to Hermione as she cried herself hoarse, her hands tightened in the Weasley sweater he'd worn holes into.
"Let's go to Hogwarts," Hermione whispered, still staring blankly into the fire. "Let's go tomorrow."
