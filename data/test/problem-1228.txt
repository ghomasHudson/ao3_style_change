“Probably because his name isn’t James, is it Harry?” Granger glared at the cat.
”Gang?” She asks, just as Draco, his mother and the two boys walk into the room.
"There's the bastard! He killed Marcus!" Someone shouted from the back.
"You're an idiot." Draco chuckled, finding himself speechless for the first time in his life.
"Holy shit, what for?"
”Well, I’m not as gullible as they are, so get back to bed. Working yourself to death isn’t going to make this cold go away anytime soon.” His voice was firm, and I did as told. He tucked me in, pressing a kiss to my forehead, before pulling away. I let out a gentle whine as he did. “Get some rest, I’ll be back later.” As he closed the door softly behind him, I felt my eyes fall and I drifted into sleep.
I spent the rest of the day not locking myself in my room, but instead going around the estate and talking to all the members. It felt like it had been a while since I had properly caught up with everyone.
The last gift was not like the others. He unfolded it slowly, holding it out at arm's length to inspect it.
?" Ginerva gestured toward Draco, before sending him a look of disgust. Draco didn't know whether to be pissed off or a little proud that she still hated him. "You prefer living with him than your own girlfriend?" Harry had his head in his hands at this point and Draco could see him mumbling replies. Ginerva stood abruptly and stalked over the counter, leaning across slightly to begin her verbal assault on Draco. Jen and Draco both took a step away quickly.
"You remember when I turned up on your doorstep on Christmas eve?"
"Ok, what do you want them to say?" Blaise asked as the men were entering the room. Blaise and I were stood behind a one-way mirror.
“Terribly sorry to say but I don’t think you’ll be taking home the grand prize this evening. Perhaps another time? Great, this was lovely. Ta-ta now!” He bid goodbye, almost forcing the couple out of his home.
He explained how he finished school but didn’t go to University. How, at the end of school, he was lonely. Most of his friends had gone off to do their own thing and his father had passed. He worked as a barista, learning the ins and outs of the cafe business for a couple years, before going to Uni and earning a degree in business management. He worked throughout all of it, saving up moment where he could, eventually able to buy this place, which had just been an empty shell of a place at the time.
Heading downstairs to see who was at the door, I find the dark skinned Officer Zabini stood before a blushing Longbottom, and an annoyed looking Malfoy behind the other officer.
“You have your own café, things turned out for you, didn’t they?”
Draco rushed through his chores, emptying the register, mopping the floor and some minor tasks in the office - without the use of his chair. Once done, he grabbed his jacket and the heavy set of padlocks.
“Pardon?”
“Sorry, I didn’t get your name,” Draco apologised as he sat opposite her, holding an americano.
”Alright. The room’s been sorted?”
“That doesn’t justify the fact that everyone I loved abandoned me!”
“Would I live there?”
”F- for you, daddy.” I moan at the contact. He leans down, pressing kisses to the insides of my thighs, before taking my clit gently between his teeth. At the pressure, I squeeze my eyes shut, letting out a loud and sharp gasp. He lets go, instead taking it into his mouth and sucking on it, circling his tongue around it.
Once the two were done with their coffees, Draco, after speaking to Jen who insisted it was ‘completely fine’, clocked out half an hour early and took Millie to see James.
"The fat bastard who looks like a pig fucked another pig but somehow ended up with a pig-human mutant baby?"
He shook his head. "It's not." I stepped back, before laying on his bed, my back to the headboard. I patted the space next to me. He hesitated, going to pick up his sweater off the floor.
James meowed quietly, almost sadly, in understanding. At least, Draco liked to think it was in understanding.
When I woke the next day, I wasn’t feeling as bright or as energetic as I had the day before. My throat was dry and sore, like I’d been deepthroating a cactus, and my nose was blocked. My ears were too and all the will to move my muscles had left me.
”He came with me. Draco invited me over for dinner and Teddy came along to distract Scorp. I assume Scorp would have been very nosy otherwise.” I answer.
“There’s a shower through that door,” was all he said, pointing to my right. “Take as long as you need.” The look in his eyes had changed, but I ignored it, knowing that all he sees is a victim, someone he should feel sorry for. Someone who’s broken and ruined.
Because Draco had been the first to say I love you, the first to propose, the first to everything. Every holiday celebration, Draco got there first. And if Harry was being honest with himself - which was a rare feat - Draco had been the first to his heart.
“A friend of mine was shot recently, and the detectives got a new lead on the case, so he came to let me know.”
“You know what would happen if I saw you there again. Under arrest or not.”
"They're all druggies or drug dealers, only out for themselves. Oh, you expect me to believe that you're actually in a
"Me too baby. You're doing so good. You're so perfect." With this and the added stimulation, I feel my orgasm rush through me, my back arching in immense pleasure.
"But when I ask you for a drink I have to make it myself?" She raised an eyebrow. "Ten quid says you're in love with him."
He headed down to the lower floor of his flat, making sure James was with him - not that he offered much in the way of protection - and buzzed his guest in, waiting a few seconds for them to begin knocking at his other front door.
The first gift was a muggle book set.
“How does pale skin, sandy hair, hazel eyes and an Irish accent sound to you?” I lean on the doorframe.
"Why don't you take a seat?" Scorpius is sat, smirking, at the island, a mug between his hands.
"Harry! Harry!" I opened my eyes to see Blaise crouching to be at my eye level.
"Officer Malfoy," He began, face as emotionless as ever.
"You think you're so bloody important, running this fantasy gang because your family left you some money. You think that Draco loves you, huh? Running around, prancing about, pretending to be a boy so you can act like this fucking fairy faggot who managed to make a straight man suck your cock! Well you're nothing! You're not the king of some gang, you're just a fucking slag, prancing around, hoping to get someone to fuck your arsehole so you don't get stuck with a kid."
“Do I have to be a member?” I shake my head.
"You're an idiot," was all Draco mumbled in reply. He went to head further into his house, but stopped for a second, turning to to Harry. "I'll run you a bath, just leave your clothes by the door."
"What was that for?" Comes the sleep-ridden yet familiar voice of Harry, who stands in doorway, making his presence known.
I suck in a breath when I see what he’s packing. I doubt that thing can fit in my mouth, let alone my ass. I look up to him as I gently kitten lick the tip. His head tips back slightly and a groan falls out of his mouth.
”I don’t have time to shower. And he already knows we’re fucking.” I shrug. I don’t have time to see Draco’s facial expression, as he quickly picks me up and hauls me over his shoulder. “Put me down! I can shower by myself!” I try wiggling to escape, but he tightens his grip. I huff. “Please daddy?” He barely holds back a groan.
”You like that, baby?”
"Then grab a cold drink and go have a break by the fan in the corner." Draco turned to them, leaning against the counter. They both hesitated. "Seriously. Have a break, five, ten minutes."
"Baby, can I hug you?" I asked quietly. He nodded. I wrapped my arms around him, slightly higher than I normally did so I wasn't putting pressure on the bruises on his torso. "Harry, I haven't felt about someone the way I feel about you in a very long time. Trust me when I say that I want you. I would never want to leave you."
She smiled. “I understand. We don’t have to use your birth name for this case. Neither in court. I remember when my daughter was first going by her chosen name, and her birth name was still on her driving license and all her legal documents. It sucks, when you haven’t changed your name legally. But here we can use your preferred name and pronouns.”
He pulled back from the hug a little to look at me.
“Hi, what can I get for you?” He greeted, treating her as he would any other customer.
"He doesn't love you. You mean nothing to him! He's only with you because he can fuck you for free and not worry about having some kid because you're so caught up in the fucking idea that you're a guy! You're a girl! God gave you a vagina and a sweet pair of tits for a reason!" I tried to scream in my mouth, but barely any noise came out. His hand holding my wrists moved away but his hand stayed on my mouth. As soon as I tried to attack him, it went back. "Listen here, slut. You'll do as I say or I'll have every one of your pathetic gang shot. You included. And then I'll shoot Draco and his kid. And then every one of those other fucking gang members in this shithole, alright?" I blinked rapidly to stop the tears as his words cut me deeper and deeper, but I nodded slowly. Fuck, if anything happened to them I would never forgive myself. "Good girl." If only he would just kill me instead.
“It was my boyfriend. He was technically still working, but something important came up and he had to tell me about it. It’s uh, something really important to me.”
"I can't be with you anymore, Gin. Every day since we got together after the war, you put me on some pedestal. Like I'm some hero who can handle everything that comes his way. You forced me into a career which has almost killed me several times. You don't care when I'm not okay, if I'm ill or injured or just not having a good day. I try to talk to you about things and you brush it off like ignoring problems will fix them."
"Well maybe they'd let me in out of the cold for a bit, a hot drink perhaps. It was worth a try even if they say no. Why are you being nice to me?"
He pulled out after a minute, letting go of me as he tucked himself away and redressed.
”Draco and Harry are in a relationship which encorporates BDSM themes, such as the use of punishments when the sub goes against a rule by the Dom. One of which would be making the sub sleep in a separate room or denying them... sexual pleasure and instead having them watch as the Dom brings himself to release. A lot of subs find pleasure in doing acts for the Dom or  generally being near them can bring them a sense of calm.” I’m blushing like mad and rest my head in my hands.
I opened my eyes. Still in the alley. As his hand pulled my boxers down and reached along my crotch, I couldn't help the sob that escaped me, my vision now blurry with tears.
“So where’ve you been, Harry?” Dean asks, trying to distract himself from the very high and horny Irish bloke beside him.
"He?"
”Scorp? What the hell are you doing in here?” I head back into the garage and see Draco with the kid from earlier.
“I uh... fuck yeah ok.” I run a hand through my hair in frustration. “I’ll be there as soon as I can. Don’t know when that’ll be but I’ll see you later.”
"You don't want to miss this, princess." He grinned as he pulled his cock out. I almost vomited as sobs tried to rack through my body.
“You didn’t answer my question. If it helps, I’m clean but I’ll use a condom if you want.”
“You’re just a plain old cat, aren’t you?” Draco sighed. James chirped. “Sorry, not plain. You’re an interesting cat, then. Just not a wizard in disguise, right?” Draco chuckled, scratching under James’ chin, earning him that loud purr again.
“If you’re here any time soon then trust me, I’ll make you learn how to follow orders quick enough.”
"Green," He said softly, letting a tear escape despite the small smile on his face.
My mind blanked and my heart stopped in my chest as I lept away from the table, away from his hand. Everyone was silent, the noise of my chair falling the only sound in the room. They were all looking at me, a matching expression of concern on their faces.
“Thank you for doing this. It takes a lot to come forward and to have to recount those horrific details. Many people say it’s like having it done to you all over again, and I agree wholly. But if it helps to get this person off the streets and to keep others safer, then perhaps it must be done. I’ll be seeing you around, Harry.” With that, she left, Blaise entering after she does.
“Remus and Sirius had an on again off again relationship during their life. Idiots in love. Didn’t know how to handle it.” Teddy nods slowly, before throwing his arms around me wishing me goodbye and heading back upstairs. Andromeda appeared in his place, a stern look on his face.
"What am I supposed to do with this?" Harry called, turning around for his eyes to follow Draco. Draco yelled back something about a heated rail in the bathroom, to which Harry rolled his eyes because of course Draco Malfoy has a heated towel rail.
hope you enjoyed!! i don’t know when i’ll be able to get the next chapter out, hopefully soon as i know where i’m going with this atm! i also want to try to update some of my other fics too once i’ve finish my uni work!
"Sure. I'm just gonna step out for a bit, think this all over. Lock up when you leave."
”So why are you calling? Is everything OK?”
A few hours later, the two entered Draco's café just before the busy lunch rush. Harry situated himself in a window seat, tucked away in the corner, as Draco got ready for the busy shift ahead.
Draco practically scooped James up, pressing a kiss to the top of James' head as the kitten let out a meow of surprise. He rolled onto his back, putting the kitten down on his stomach.
"Red," He said, and I watched as a tear gathered in his eye.
“Thanks, ‘Mione. And don’t worry about Malfoy. He’s...” I trail off, looking for the right word to use.
Harry woke before Draco. The rising sun streaming warm light through the gap in the curtains, a carpet of snow on the world outside just visible. He looked to the man sleeping soundly next to him, a calm expression on his face which was, frankly, a rare sight on him.
"James!" He called, letting the kitten know he was home, just as he always did. He fixed himself a cup of tea quickly, not knowing how long the power would last.
“The detective will just be a minute,” he said as he left, but he paused before he opened the door, and turned around. “It’s a female detective. I’m not going to tell Draco. I’ll be waiting for you when you’re done. I’ll make sure he’s out on patrol.”
"All the way." My voice doesn't sound firm, but I'm sure I want him tonight.
“He’s here, don’t worry Harry.” She smiled gently. “His boss is a little angry with him, but he’s adamant about having the day off work. You know how love makes men act.” She finished, shaking her head gently with a smile. “But that’s neither here nor there, Harry. You need to be in bed, getting better. Here, have this,” Shen set the tray down on my bedside table. Unsure, I got back in bed and took a steaming bowl from her. “It’s chicken noodle soup, great for colds. Dad used to swear by it,” She smiled sadly.
"Who is that?" Jen asked, trying to get a good look at the scene without trying to seem obvious. Draco wracked his brain, realising a second too late who it was.
Seconds after the door shut behind her, Harry burst into tears, his shoulders heaving. Draco rushed to his side, hugging him to his chest tightly and letting Harry cry as he needed. He rubbed soft circles onto Harry's back and whispered soft 'its okay's and 'I'm here's that he never thought he would say. He comforted Harry as he would for a nightmare.
”I’d tell whoever was my second in command, or Luna, down some meds and get back into the action. I’d just blame the cough on smoking or something. Worked every time.” I shrugged, before yawning.
"Oh, Merlin, sorry Jamesie," Draco sat up quickly, "I didn't give you dinner." James meowed again as Draco went to leave the room, and again louder just before he did. "What?"
As soon as I was in the cell I was pinning him to the wall with my arm, pressing down firmly on his windpipe.
"Well... I was once the son of leading Death Eater Lucius Malfoy. I was the boy who let the Death Eaters in Hogwarts. Now I run a coffee shop."
“Sorry. It’s his heritage. He deserved to know.”
"You're just like him," Draco muttered, a small smile playing with the ends of his lips.
”No, definitely not. Why, you on shark week?” He stops laughing when Neville slaps his arm. “Alright, Alright. He hasn’t told me this one for sure, but I reckon he has a bit of a daddy kink. As in, he likes to be called it, not calling others it.”
"Yeah, ran into my cafe when I was closing up last night. He seems to trust me, but that's probably just because I fed him." The vet nodded and began to examine the cat as best it could. "It's injured, on it's back leg." Draco mentioned before shutting up. The vet was quick to bandage the wound, before she scanned for a chip.
I was brought out of my thoughts when a hand clapped my shoulder.
Sorry I haven’t posted recently. Had to take some time for myself. Hopefully there’ll be an update soon and thanks for your support. If you enjoy my writing and want you support me further, consider buyig me a ko-fi:
"I can't really say. Made some promises and I'm not willing to break them given the person I promised." Why was Blaise acting so weird? He was completely off today. In fact, he'd been a bit out of it when we'd hung out the other day. I knew he wasn't going to tell, being such a good secret keeper as I'd come to know over the many years we'd been friends. Instead, I headed to the desk and spoke to the receptionist, Blaise staying where he was, almost out of fear.
“Hey guys.” I greet the couple, squeezing past them to grab two mugs of coffee.
“Harry, you alright in there?” Neville shouted.
”What did you mean, ‘again’?”
“Yeah, like spying on you,” she rolled her eyes.
After cake and wine, and a few hours of peaceful conversation, Draco was finally alone again in his apartment.
“No.” Pansy corrected, coming to stand opposite him again, wand in hand and hair now a mess. “I want to turn an animagus back into a human. Don’t you think it’s weird?”
James meowed again, almost fed up with the wizard, hitting the clock harder making it tumble to the floor. Both James and Draco watched it fall, James not moving a muscle.
”I had a lot of films to catch up on when I got here.” I answer. I step aside and let Draco talk to his cousin. Teddy brings him into a very tight hug, and as the head catch up I can’t help but notice how good Draco is with him. Once they’re done, Draco am done I grab one of his bags each and I lead us over to house 3.
”Don’t be mad.” I whisper, to sure what else to say.
Once he finishes spanking me, I’m lost in a haze of pleasure, pain and lust, and I can feel my crotch is dripping wet right now. Draco’s fingers glide about on my asscheeks, before he pushes my legs apart slightly.
I’m sitting at my desk, sorting out paperwork for Teddy, who would be moving into the neighbourhood soon. Andromeda had sent over his papers, signing me over as his legal guardian. Bitch.
I cut him off by standing up quickly. His eyes widened in fear.
"Trust me, I didn't expect it either. My coworkers insisted that I get one. It's not like I've any friends to hang out with, anyways," he added the last part in a mumble, but the cat still heard and pawed at his leg gently. "I don't even know what to watch. One part of me thinks 'everything' because I've never bloody used one of these things before and another part of me thinks 'nothing', because it all looks like shit."
“You coming, James?” He asked one evening, standing at the bottom of the stairs, ready to head to bed. It’d been a long and busy day and Draco was exhausted.
"Those are nice," Harry muttered after a while, Draco still softly drying his hair. He felt Draco stop, probably to have a peek at the TV screen.
There’s a knock at my door. It’s short but demanding, and something in me doesn’t hesitate, and I quickly answer it.
Draco couldn't stop himself from reaching a hand up and tangling his fingers in Harry's hair. The man above him leaned into the touch, just as James would have, his green eyes fluttering closed for a second.
Draco made a mental note to see about having more air conditioning units installed because if his employees couldn't stand the heat, the customers definitely wouldn't.
“Harry, please. Did something happen? Did Draco do this?” He shouted through my door. “Please Harry, we haven’t seen you all day. We’re worried.”
“What’s it to you?” I cross my arms, getting defensive.
”Uh, Yeah. Last night, actually.” I blush.
"Harry!" Charlie smiled when he saw me. The rest of the Weasleys, plus Luna and 'Mione, were all busy talking. "Long time no see, bud!"
”Mother, this is James. I adopted him, kind of.”
"Daddy you're too big." I pout, but he knows I'm not being mean.
“And then you stole
”Nothing you say here will leave this room.” I take a deep breath.
Red and blue lights flash throughout the room and, thinking it’ lighting effects, everyone cheers and begins to dance with more rigour, but the noise of the front door crashing in sends the people into drunken panic. I laugh and continue dancing. No one can harm the Griffin King.
“So you’ve taken a fancy to Officer Malfoy, huh?” A voice with a slight Irish twang drags me out of my thoughts and I turn to the person who spoke. He seemed to be my age and about my height, with sandy hair and pale skin.
"Couldn't sleep last night. Nightmares. The usual," I shrugged. She frowned for a second, knowing I hadn't had nightmares in years.
“Finally, the bunnies leave their burrow.” Weasley grins, earning a chuckle from the others.
”Anything that you want to say to me can be said in front of Neville.” He gives me a pointed look. I sigh before replying.
”Men get pleasure from it.” Seamus leaned against Dean. “See, with a woman, their g-spot is up their, you know. Men have it up the ass. You fuck that and you’re both having a good time. We can have a good time if you want.” How Thomas put up with the Irish lad, I don’t know, but he rolled his eyes and pushed the kid away from him. “But imagine, you’re butt fuckin’ a guy and he’s screaming yer name because he actually enjoys it!” Dean got up, leaving the room and the conversation with his hands held up in frustration. Seamus followed, loudly giving us all an example. “Oh Dean! Oh fuck Dean! Right there baby!” He shouted, following Dean to wherever he had gone.
“You can’t let him see me like this.” I begged him.
Spurred on by his praise, I slip him cock back into mouth, and begin sliding him in and out of my mouth, going as far back as I am without gagging. Each time I pull back, I hollow my cheeks and revel in the groans leaving Draco’s mouth as I do. I lose myself bobbing up and down on his dick, letting it settle deeper into my mouth and feeling myself getting wet. I accidentally let my teeth drag against him and stop sucking when he lets out a hiss.
He sighed, heading over to the bag.
“So you openly admit to being one?” He hums.
“We think his name is James, so there’s that. No one’s come forward yet, so I think I might keep him. And his leg’s much better now, thank you. Didn’t have to use the cone, though.” He shrugged.
”Fuck, Harry.” He groans, riding through his climax. I can only moan as he continues to pound my sensitive hole until he stops shooting. He leans down to kiss me gently, before slipping out of me. “You’re so good, baby. You’re perfect. I’m so glad I met you.” He whispers. I slip my arms around his neck and press my lips to his in reply. I look deep into his eyes, which are filled with such fondness and kindness, before I press my forehead to him.
"Happy birthday, Draco." Pansy smirked. She obviously knew how much he would have hated this. That's the only reason why she ever did the things she does. To spite others. He followed he with his eyes as she walked into his lounge, placing a large bag on the table.
When Draco did wake up, it wasn't long before the black ball of fur curled up next to him was awake too, excitedly mewing at the man.
My stomach growled loudly, demanding food, just as Teddy walked in. He eyed my outfit before looking at the clothes on the side.
"Blaise!" He cried, seeing his friend stood at his door.
“It’s your café, Draco,” they laughed. “You’re allowed to go for a break. I’ll be fine here, it’s quiet.”
“I’d say having someone balls deep in me would be fairly intimate.” I counter, making Neville laugh. He walks past us with a nod, heading to his room. No doubt to start on his share of the marijuana. I wouldn’t blame him. A stable source with high quality products for a good price. I treat my gang, what can I say.
Compared to the cafe downstairs, the floorspace of his house was nothing, with a kitchen and lounge on the first floor, and bedroom and bathroom on the floor above. But Draco managed, because he had worked hard for it, and he was glad he had something to show for it.
I woke to the sun high in the sky, signaling that I had been in bed for half the day. I sighed in frustration, pushing the covers back and swinging my legs over the side of the bed.
”Alright. You know where I am if you need me, right?” He nods.
“Fuck.” I mutter under my breath. I turn my music down but don’t lower my speed, instead turning off down a road into a housing estate where I know I can lose them. I zig zag down streets upon streets of houses, my engine roaring loudly through the small town I’ve ducked into. By now I was going to be back way too late and I was too far from home to get there quick enough. Still, I’d rather be late home than caught by the pigs.
“Well... I woke up and had a shower. Then I had breakfast with Hermione and Neville - he’s made us pancakes. Not that you need to know that...”
"You should be glad I don't just slam into you straight away. Or would you prefer that?" I shake my head quickly. He lets the rest of him slip in slowly - too slowly - and eventually he's fully seated inside of me, his hips against mine. The huge intrustion feels odd, and I worry that it's too big. But it's too late for that, and I try to get over the pain and discomfort quickly. I let him know I'm OK and he begins to pull back out of me, leaving just the tip inside. The emptiness feels weird, but I don't say anything as he pushes into me again, quicker this time but still fairly slow. I let out a slow groan as he fills me again, and as he begins to slowly fuck me I rock my hips against him. I soon realise that he's going too slow for my taste, and decide to let him know.
“Who was at the door?” She asked earnestly.
Draco read the letter twice over, before letting the owl fly home.
Was he scared of me?
"Scorp not here?" I asked when I noticed it was just Teddy in the room.
“We’re adults. We’re just not 40 years old, grandpa.” I smile slyly, adding a few years to what he looked like.
”I’m terribly sorry Millie, would you mind if I stole Draco away from you?”
"Stop stroking me, tosser. I'm not a bloody dog." He muttered as he sat up. "Good morning," he added, almost an afterthought.
With a final, almost yelled, meow, James woke up, almost flinching at Draco’s touch before realising where he was.
After she left, Draco sat down on the stairs next to James, resting his head in his hands. James perched up, his front paws on Draco’s leg.
“I’ll be using a very different type of handcuffs. That’s a promise.” His voice is low and his eyes darken slightly.
"Mr Jospeh, I can go and get someone if you like. We can have an officer sit here to calm you, or we can call home if you like?" She seemed honest. I shrugged. "I'll go and get an officer," She smiled gently. "You can relax for now," She gestured to my feet. I removed them from the stirrups and laid back, trying not to close my eyes. Trying not to sense my body.
”It still hurts.” I sighed, rubbing my lower back gently.
”Hit a pothole and the fuel pipe got burst. Reckless driving in my opinion. Doesn’t deserve this beauty.”
"He asked me-" Blaise started to say, but I didn't let him finish as I raced up the stairs. I walked through the bullpen with purpose, the detectives around me giving me odd looks. I headed straight to the holding cell to see Goyle sat, leaning against the wall. He looked up, and smirked when he saw me, looking pleased with himself.
I knocked gently on Harry's door, before opening it.
Draco wished he hoped the cat would find his owner soon, but he couldn't. Seeing the thing curl up into a tight little ball on his pillow that night made him wish he could keep it, even just for a little longer.
“Being an absolute cockslut doesn’t make me any less manly.”
“You bet.” I laugh.
"I would too if you proposed with a silver ring," Draco rolled his eyes, not that Harry could see. Harry was grateful that the blond hadn't bothered to inquire with the 'why' which most people followed his statement with. "There, all done." He pulled back, towel in hand, just as a ping came from the kitchen behind them. Draco leaned forward and dropped the towel in Harry's lap, leaving to man on the floor for the kitchen.
That's it.
”I made tea.” I smile, bringing the mug back to my lips to take a sip. He kisses my forehead.
"Apparently he was found beaten to death. Mostly head and torso wounds, I think a fractured leg as well. For some reason they think it was you who did it."
“He’s got a point.” Draco turns to me. “Next time you’ll have to be as loud as Longbottom there’s, right baby boy?”
“Fantastic. Thanks Luna, you’re a saint.” She says goodbye in her light, dreamy voice before heading back to her office. “Ok. Clothes.”
A knock sounded gently at the door.
"Didn't picture you as a fan of Wilde," Draco muttered.
speak like that to these people. Police officers are supposed to support the community and enforce the law, arresting and convicting when there's evidence to prove it. But you," he shoved her back further, "come in here, accusing them of being drug dealers and of murdering others. You come here, calling them scum and pushing an interrogation too far. The nature of Harry's relationship has no bearing on your investigation into Marcus' murder, a
Draco began steaming some milk and, hoping she wouldn't hear him, muttered to himself, "I am."
When I wake a couple hours later, I can hear a phone ringing from downstairs. I slip out of bed quickly, the cold air hitting me sharply, and run to answer it, still naked from last night.
“Hello again, you!” Narcissa smiled slightly, giving James a quick stroke. “I hope my son is treating you properly,” she added, giving Draco side-eye.
"Please, daddy." This assures him, and he flips me over before he moves himself down my body, his head near my crotch. I'm surprised, however, when his tongue begins to press against my asshole rather than my clit, but nevertheless it has a moan tumbling out of my mouth and into the pillow I'm pressed against. He lifts my ass up slightly, before speaking again.
“And I’m King of the Griffins. I’ll have every fucking gang in Britain on your ass before you can make the call. Don’t forget the power I hold. There’s more of us than there is you. We’ll fuck your life over before you tuck yourself into your prissy bed tonight, got it? Don’t think for a fucking second you can get away with shit just because you’re a police officer. Hurt him and we’ll come right back at you.” I glare at him for a second, giving him a final shove before I step back. Zabini looks shaken, and quickly leaves to find Longbottom. I turn to face Draco, who’s staring at me with wide eyes.
”So Scorpius is - what, dating?” Scorp nods and Teddy buries his head in his hands. “Scorpius is dating his father’s cousin’s son.” Astoria clarifies.
I cum on his fingers with a loud moan, throwing my head back. As I come down from my high, I realise what I’ve done, and, becoming slightly embarrassed for reasons not known to me, I bury my head into Malfoy’s chest. I feel him pull his hand from my boxers, and I look up to see him licking my cum from his hand. He zips my trousers back up and holds me against him as I regain my strength.
“Let’s leave the two lovebirds alone.” Granger suggests, pulling Weasley out the room with her. Malfoy takes a step closer to me, towering over my small frame.
”Hey, I was drunk and high. Still am a bit.” His grip tightens and I yowl in pain. “Please daddy that hurts.” Slips out of my lips before I can stop myself.
Draco looked intensely at the cat, who tilted his head in return.
"Time to go home, kitten." He coaxed the cat awake, softly stroking its back as it shifted slightly, before those bright green eyes peered up at him. It chirped at him, sitting up on his chair. He picked it up with one hand, trying his best to make sure it felt safe in his grip, and left the cafe. He locked the door behind him and then dutifully pulled down the shutters, securing them to the floor with the padlocks to ensure the glass windows and door didn't get a brick through them during the night. He had worked too hard for this place for that to happen.
Draco didn't, pointing to the floor in front of where he sat. Harry sat down, scared of what might happen if he didn't, his legs crossed and his back to the sofa.
"Mr Malfoy, you said you owned a cafe...?"
“You’re not from the Griffins, are you?” He asks.
"Harry, what's going on?" He asked as I let him into the room. I locked the door and he sat by me on the floor.
“These your owners, James?”
“Hey Draco.” Nervousness comes over me, as if I’m meeting him for the first time. Which is strange, considering how bold I became when I was pulled over. He steps into my room, closing the door behind him.
I left Nev alone, before sending Blaise the pictures and a quick explanation.
"I didn't really get over them, at least not in the conventional way. Just found a bigger fish to fry."
"But nothing. You're an idiot, you know." He went to leave the room.
”Hello?” I ask as I pick it up.
"It gets a bit lonely in the flat, is all."
When Draco finally appears in the doorway, his shirt is slightly unbuttoned and he’s pulling his trousers off. He closes the door behind him softly, not wanting to draw attention from our guests, and he throws his trousers onto the floor before pulling his shirt off.
“He has black fur and green eyes, which is pretty common for a cat. Also, I seem to recall Harry being a human male during our school years, not a cat.”
“Even when it comes to dicks, it seems.” Granger raises her eyebrows but we know she’s poking fun.
"You don't, Gin. You really don't."
Draco and I change into more appropriate clothing for his mother’s and ex-wife’s arrival - that being said, almost anything is more appropriate than a thong and shirt when meeting your boyfriend’s mother. Draco had dressed somewhat formally, with a button up shirt and black chinos, hair carefully styled, whereas I had thrown my trousers on, stolen one of his hoodies and ran a comb through my hair.
Next was a bottle of 2000 Malbec from France. She gave him a smirk. He hadn't had a good bottle of wine in years and she'd somehow known his favourite.
"So..." Harry picks up the conversation, "you want me to go?" He nods his head towards the paper. Draco scoffs, almost choking on his drink.
“I’ll go and have these sent to the lab. You’ll be taken into questioning in a second. Unfortunately, even if you do know who the officer is, we still need the DNA evidence to be able to prosecute. But please know that it’s not because we’re trying to push you away. I’ll leave you alone now, I’m sure Officer Zabini can take you to the interview room.” With that, she took the evidence and left the room.
I’m not prepared enough for when he brings his hand sharply on my left cheek, the sharp sting sending pain shooting through me.
"Feels polite. God knows what you and Luna might be getting up to in here," I chuckled. She slapped me on the arm.
Draco raised an eyebrow, looking to James who had come to sit by his feet.
The table had been cleared, and I took Charlie aside for a moment after everyone had stopped looking at me. He went to talk but I shushed him.
"So, Tyler Jospeh, am I correct?" The doctor reentered, a small smile on her face. I nodded. "I'm Dr. Rosenthal, and I'll be examining you today. I understand this is a very invasive procedure, and I am sorry for an discomfort you may feel. This does however lead to a much higher chance of discovering your assailant, especially when it can be so painful to recall the events so soon after it all happening." Yeah, like fifteen minutes ago. "I'll be swabbing the inside of your vagina for any remaining semen, and then I'll also search for any hair samples that have been left. Are you ok for us to proceed now?" I nodded, and slotted my feet where I was told. I grabbed the bed as hard as I could when I felt a pair of tweezers around my crotch. She pulled out after a minute.
Draco was just sweeping the floor when he heard something. A scared meowing, something pawing at the glass door of his cafe. Leaning his broom - his muggle, cleaning broom he was sad to say - against the counter, he plucked his keys from his pocket and unlocked the door. As he did, a small, black kitten ran in from the dark night outside, sheltering under a nearby table. Draco stared in awe at the gall of the thing.
"Like that baby? Yeah? You like it when I slam into your tight ass, huh? You like being filled with my cock?"
I grabbed a bowl from a cupboard, hoping she hadn't noticed the sleeves from the jacket slip down a little, and sat down to eat.
"You OK?"
“What if ‘Mione and Ron come looking for me again? Or Ginny?”
“I DEMAND to speak with another officer THIS INSTANT! I don’t give a FUCK what you think about people like me but I REFUSE to answer ANY MORE of your questions your fucking ARSEWIPE!” Spit flies from my mouth and the door opens quickly. I look up to see my saviour, Blondie, looking on concerned.
He brushed away a couple hairs which had fallen onto Draco's face, the man's eyes fluttering open as he did. The calm expression left his face for an angry one, one which Harry knew to not believe.
"Potter, how do you know where I live?"
”Yep. Finished her earlier. Just had to do some other checks for damages but she’s ready to go. Excuse me while I go let the owner know.” The kid nods, and mills about the garage while I head into the office to make a phone call. As I put down the phone, I hear someone else enter the garage.
“Look, I’m fine. I was just trying to hurry home so you lot didn’t have to go out scouting for me. Now hurry up yourself. We’ve got a good amount of weed here and I’m dying for a blunt.”
"You." I whispered. He smirked, and immediately his lips latched onto my clit, unlocking a series of loud moans from me. His tongue played with me expertly, bringing me closer and closer to climax. "Daddy I'm close."  At this, he moved up my body, much to my disappointment with the caesure of his actions, and pressed his lips in the middle of my chest. I let out a whimper before he looked to the bedside table in search of something. I felt his body weight shift as he quickly took his trousers off, before leaning over me to grab a bottle. The cap clicked loudly and it wasn't long before I felt two fingers pressing at my hole, the lube cold against my hot skin. Draco worked quickly, costing my insides with the liquid and scissoring me open. I mewled when his fingers left me, but then I felt something much larger pressing at my asshole. Draco buried himself to the hilt, letting out a loud groan as he did.
”I’ll be OK for now, but thanks Harry. Thanks for everything.”
”Oh, I’ve seen him around before,” she shrugged, going to sit down in the lounge.
"I got over it, though. Plus, being a muggle vet is almost magic in itself. So many injured animals and not long after they're healthy again. I think you lot don't appreciate muggle medicine enough."
”Did you steal that from Lilo and Stitch?” I shrug.
“My Dad was in a gang?” Teddy looked shocked. I smiled.
"Who's your friend?" Jen asked over the noise of the milk steamer.
(See the end of the chapter for
Next chapter will be up in a couple hours. Been a hot minute since my last upload but my exam went well and I’m in a good mood. Quite a bit of smut next chapter lads so make sure you stick around! (And you can bet your sweet little asses that Scorp and Teddy become a thing)
“Sorry. He needs to know. No one’s forcing him, either. At least respect the decision he makes.” She shakes her head slightly in disbelief, but doesn’t say anything further. I head up to Teddy’s room, finding him sat in his bed scrolling through his phone.
“Don’t worry, James,” Draco sighed, scratching the kitten behind his ear. “Stay a cat as long as you like,” he chuckled.
”Sure thing, Daddy.” I tack onto the end, making him let out a small growl-like noise.
”Actually, before I go.” Scorpius walks back in and I can sense Draco rolling his eyes. “Who’s the cute kid with the blue hair?” I smile.
"Anyway, we don't when Teddy's around, we don't want to scar him."
”Seamus’ll mellow out with some weed, it’s chill.” Weasley reasssures her.
"Could I get Blaise's number? Draco's phone must have died." Lying was turning out to be one of my strengths, I'll have to add that to my CV.
”May I ask who your boyfriend is? Just in case we need to bring him in for further questioning.” She smiles.
"Oh, I'm not." He laughed lightly in response. "I always wake early, even on days off."
“Now I know you’re not that stupid. You’re an animagus. Just turn back into James if they come knocking and I’ll deal with them. Merlin, it’s surprising you’ve lasted this long in the real world.”
Three.
Draco looked down to his mug for a moment, trying to work out if it would be worth trying to muggle-ify his story.
I might have gone and accidentally written the next chapter completely, so hopefully I can get an update for this in a couple days. Hope you enjoyed, loves x
"No. I just gave him some E. We were dancing and then we got busted."
"Please... let me GO!" I gasp. He only laughs at this.
”Harry, they think you killed someone. They guy you were dancing with last night. He was the leader of the Serpents.” She answers.
"Take down a serial killer as a teenager and now you sell flowers."
"Yep," he answered, "one sec" he added under his breath. He sat up and got out of the tub a little too quickly. Glasses still sitting on the counter and rendered almost blind, Harry's foot caught on the side of the bathtub and he was sent flying, or would have been at least if it weren't for the pair of arms which wrapped around him, saving him from the impending crash.
”My father?
"Who's your friend?" Melissa whispered a couple hours later. Jen had headed home once the lunch rush was over, meaning that the café was quiet.
"I think she was called His Right Hand." George answered, smirking. I made an unimpressed expression towards the both of them.
"Uh-huh." I can barely talk. With Draco pounding into me as hard as he is, my thought process is all of nothing and my speech capabilites have gone to shit. He moves a hand to play with my clit and I immediately feel myself nearing climax. "Please." I gasp. "Please daddy I'm so close."
“Officer Goyle, I think Officer Crabbe was looking for you.” Blondie ignores my existence, but thankfully ‘Goyle’ gets up and leaves. Blondie takes his place. He studies me for a second, and I realise now I must look like shit. I’d gone straight from working in the garage to the deal, so my face was still dirty. Blondie sees the card on the table – my driving license – and picks it up.
After a little while, there came a sharp knock at the door.
”So like barely related at all?” He confirms, and I nod to him. “Sweet.”
“Yes, but I’d also like to think of myself as a bit of a size queen, so we’ll have to see what happens when you take those pants off.” I quirk my eyebrow. “I’ll see you around.” I bid him farewell and, after giving my ass small squeeze, he heads out the door. I don’t wait to watch him drive off, simply slamming the door and heading into the lounge to see my friends.
“Hey Jamesie,” Draco smiled, crouching down to scratch the kitten behind its ears. James purred heavily in response, but stopped immediately when he saw Millie.
Despite my best efforts, Neville still saw them and swore loudly. I hid in my room, locking the door.
"You hurt Harry, and now you have to deal with me." I shouted in his face.
“I won’t lie, the thought of seeing you pregnant if kind of hot, but we met yesterday so I doubt you want to go that far too quickly. Don’t worry, I don’t plan on knocking you up anytime soon.” I think for a minute, the silence unfortunately allowing us to hear another moan from upstairs.
“Whole house could hear you.” I grimace. He blushes a bright red, burying his head into Blaise’s shoulder.
i don’t know how to summarise but i am
"Officer Zabini is fine," I tried to smile back. Blaise was looking at me with a face full of emotions. The doctor returned to her station between my legs, and Blaise made his way to my side.
Draco wanted to be furious at her for getting him something that meant a lot to him, even something as simple as chocolates. He only glared at her as she continued to smirk knowingly.
I hear footsteps approaching, but don't bother looking as I knew the alley wasn't completely abandoned.
“Is that a threat, Officer?”
The softest of meows came from behind him. He whipped around, seeing a pair of green eyes hiding under his bed.
It’s been just under a week since I last saw Draco and, not to sound like a horny teen, but I was getting more antsy as days went by without him touching me as intimately as he had. As it turns out, however, good things do come to those who wait. And boy, do they come.
"Colour?"
I’m at the garage, working on a car, when I hear footsteps on the concrete floor.
"Merlin's sake, Potter," Draco chided, but there was no real bite to his tone. "Saviour of the wizarding world and yet can't come to reasonable conclusions. It really is a miracle." He added under his breath as he tidied up their breakfast things.
”Yeah, Harry’s in a gang.” Teddy grins. “And I am too!”
“Gran won’t let me dye my hair again. It’s been a whole month! I’m getting bored with blue.” He frowns, before sending a glare through the walls to where the kitchen is.
"Well he included 'virgin' in it but that might be a bit specific." I looked to the line up, seeing him as number 4. I know he was just looking at the reflection, but it was almost as if he was looking right at me, like he knew I was there. I had to sit down. Blaise gave me a worried look, but continued with it, asking each one to step forward and say the phrase. I tried to block it out, covering my ears when I knew he was next, but I still heard it, and it still made me gag. Within moments I was back there, back in the alley, him close to me, trying to convince me Draco didnt love me, that I was a girl, a 'perfect little virgin princess'. Suddenly I could feel his hands on me, feel him inside me, and I shouted and screamed to get him off me.
”No, why would I have? They don’t want it. What, have you?”
Oh god, I missed Draco so much. But as much as I wanted to be in his arms, I didn't want him to see me like this.
"You mean you want me to practice?" He raises an eyebrow, but takes the spliff from me regardless and has another go. I wait patiently, watching him intently as he successfully takes a drag, calmly blowing the smoke out though his nose without choking on it. He takes another drag, and then another before I have to take it off him.
She shrugged, storming into the kitchen to search in there, leaving Draco standing, confused.
"Am I? Or did I just give her what she needed?"
Draco was sat on the sofa deep in thought when Harry reentered the living room, now donning a pair of emerald green, tailor-made pyjamas, probably silk. Both the trousers and the top were too long for Harry, meaning he'd had to roll up the sleeves and the legs.
"If you'll have me, then yeah you do."
As much as he hated it, he welcomed Ginerva into his home. And Harry's home too, really. He sat in the armchair, Harry sitting on the end of the sofa closest to him, and Ginerva perched on the opposite end, still furious.
"Right, now get your ass in the shower." He got up and grabbed my hand, pulling me up before heading to the door.
”I hope Dean’s going to be OK.” Granger mumbles.
I looked away for a second, then met his gaze with a soft sigh. “Fine.” I muttered.
”Drink this and then strip.” I quickly drink the cold water, not realising how parched my throat was. Handing the empty glass back to him, I begin to take my clothes off, chucking them into a pile by the locked door. I hesitate when I go to pull my trousers down, but Draco clears his throat impatiently and I shove them off. “Maybe leave those on for now.” He looks at the pair of panties that I’m wearing with a smirk, before picking up my clothes.
My eyes gazed over his body before I saw the bruises. First I saw the ones on his neck, clear marks where Goyle's fingers had pressed harshly against Harry's throat. Then the ones on his waist and hips, much larger. His wrists, too, were bruised. The bruises were clearly beginning to fade but were still a hue of purple which was sharp against Harry's skin.
Millie was great. She brought out a sense of humour in Draco that he didn’t even know he had. They shared stories from their respective jobs, like how she’d had to remove a magnet from a hamster on more than one occasion, or some of the atrocious coffee orders Draco had taken, despite the café being very clearly not a Starbucks.
”Officer Malfoy. Tall, blond.” Blaise explains from the corner. She nods, and send a smile my way.
"What are you doing to him? Got him under some kind of spell or feeding him some kind of potion? Pulled some dark magic from your sleeves, hmm? Couldn't get enough when you were a Death Eater?"
”Earlier? Like when I was fingering you in the alley? Or the kitchen? Or when you were sucking me off? It was a bit hard to drop into conversation.”
“No please, as much detail as possible!” She smiled gently, encouragingly.
”The Griffins don’t really have a hierarchy. And I don’t want them fucking up a deal.” I shout in reply. “They don’t need to know about my extras, anyway.” I pat my pocket and the guy raises an eyebrow. I pull out the clear bag that contains the pills I got from my last deal before taking out a couple. I offer him one and he shrugs, taking one. We place them on our tongues before swallowing them, chasing them with a drink. “Shouldn’t be long.” I shout with a wink.
"Good luck kid." Zabini smiled, gesturing to where Draco was leaning against his car, looking extremely displeased. As Zabini headed inside the house, Draco began walking over, authority in his step. I held in my breath, waiting to see what would happen, as he strode past me into the household, leaving the door open. I followed him in up to my room, where he slammed the door behind me. My heart was pounding in my chest, threatening to break my ribs if it beat any harder. Draco looked angry, and stared me down, making me feel like I was tiny.
He tripped up on something and realised, as he landed in the snow, that he couldn't feel his hands nor his feet, and he was losing faith in his arms and legs. He wasn't religious but he prayed for the safety of his extremities regardless.
There was a knock at the front door, and when I went to open it I wasn't surprised to see him stood there.
"It was just Cho from the Serpents. She wanted somewhere to stay for a couple weeks until everything calmed down. Said she feeling scared."
June 5th.
Goyle leaned in, pressing wet, sloppy kisses to my cheek and neck.
"Obviously the first time." Although it wasn't obvious at all. "Technically our first Christmas together."
“Oh,” she seemed saddened.
”Yeah, but if you could hear yourself when you say it, and I mean hear it like I do, you would pretty much cum. Trust me. It’s the hottest thing to come out of your mouth.” I take a couple steps forward so I’m almost touching him and look up to him through hooded eyelids.
"Perhaps you could tell him it's a girl who's been assaulted. He obviously knows - Well that's a lie. I'm a guy but he still believes I'm a girl, so maybe that might help throw him off a bit."
“Oh no. Police officer though.”
”Teddy pushed him onto the floor.” I close the cupboard door a bit too harshly. Silence falls between us, and we hear jostling from the lounge. Draco places a finger against his lips to tell me to keep quiet, and we slowly walk to the lounge. From where we stand in the doorway, I can see the two boys on the two seater sofa together.
Draco stood up from the sofa, holding a hand out to Harry. He tentatively took it, to which Draco smiled and rolled his eyes.
"What was that?" My boyfriend asked.
“It’s- its the morning after pill.” He stated quietly. I nodded once, taking the medication before letting him lead me to a small room, with a table, two chairs either side and a mirror on one wall, which was clearly one way.
For my lovely readers, I decided to actually update. Seeing as it's my birthday, all of my current unfinished works have a new chapter. I know that's not how birthdays work, but your support, be it kudos or comments or bookmarks, mean a lot to me. I wanted to thank you, across all my current works, with some long awaited updates. Hope you enjoy x
"He can't know." I hushed back, tears forming at my eyes. "Please.”
"Really?" I asked, exasperated. "Because I haven't seen my boyfriend for days and I've been missing him to no end, and now I've heard he's been hurt and I want to be there to support him." I paused. "Because I wasn't there to protect you when you needed me most, and now I don't want to leave your side. I want you, Harry. Nothing has changed that, nothing ever will."
”Fine.” I whisper. “You were right.” He grabs my hand and pulls me close, before pressing his lips to mine. I kiss him back with vigor and wrap my arms around his neck. I jump and wrap my legs around his waist, his hands grabbing my thighs. He pushes me against the wall making a thud as his tongue enter s myth mouth. I feel myself get aroused and I can feel him straining against his trousers. I pull back and look into his eyes, which are clouded with lust.
"Draco? What a unique name. I think Narcissa's boy has the same name." Molly wondered aloud. "But he must be twice your age, I doubt it's him."
”Just stab me with the” - cough - “magic juice and you can” - cough - “get to work!”
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell.” He whispers in my ear, his hand momentarily landing on my hip. “Remember, I better not see you in here again.”
”Why don’t you give it a try, Dean? Just once. And if you don’t like it, we can get you a restraining order for Seamus.” He offered, ever the negotiator.
"Yeah, I am."
He nodded, smiling. He liked that his employees felt they could come to him when they needed something. He liked that, unlike earlier in life, he was in a position to actually help people.
”Hey. I’m Harry. I’d shake your hand but they’re bit oily.” I grin. The boy is taller than me, but clearly younger, if only by a couple years. He has bright blond hair that reminds me of Draco, but his eyes are a dark brown.
"It was awful, you came down with a cold and didn't get me a present."
”Thanks for arresting me, daddy.” I giggle, before a yawn escapes my lips. He chuckles and pulls back, before throwing the bed covers over me.
”Yeah but when Seamus wants something he rarely gives up. Trust me.” I gave Draco a look which told him to explain. “We’ve had him in the station before, he had a thing for me. Guess it stopped when you came into the picture.”
"I did have to," she rolled her eyes, picking the robe up and bringing it around his shoulders and fastening the silver clasps which, upon further inspection, had engravings of a stag on one and a doe on the other.
"Harry, right? I'm Cho, I'm from the Serpents." She held a hand out to me quickly, and I shook it, unused to such formality.
"I wasn't expecting anyone at all, today." Draco admitted. "Please, come in."
Harry opened his mouth to say something more, but the words failed him and he headed back to his seat in the corner. Draco turned to begin on the drink when he saw Melissa starting at him deadpan.
”Did you ever... return the feeling?”
"I... own a pharmacy."
“Mr Joseph, hello, I’m detective Marcel. I’ll be interviewing you about the events of earlier.” She spoke with a tone that made it clear she was in charge of the room, but it was interlaced with the warmth of a mother. I felt a little more comfortable. She sat down, placing a notepad and tape recorder on the table. “I’ll be recording this for future reference, and in case it needs to be used in court.” She jotted down a few things at the top of her page, before beginning the questions.
I spend a few minutes trying to work the coffee pot, but when I fail I instead fill the kettle and set about making a pot of tea. As it boils, I tidy away dishes off of the draining board and empty the dishwasher, and find myself giving the kitchen a general once over. Once the kettle has boiled and the tea has steeped, I lean against the spotless countertop sipping my mug of hot tea. I hear movement from upstairs.
Draco gets jealous easily.
"Sounds good. We'll have two officers waiting outside the door to cuff him and take him to get DNA samples. But you can leave as soon as you identify him."
“Your own café? Very muggle,” Blaise chuckled. “Well, I’m not really busy at the moment, my better half’s up at Hogwarts though so it gets lonely.”
It took a while trying to position myself in ways to take good pictures, but also trying to keep myself calm and not alert my housemates. The bruises were now deep hues of purple, extremely clear to see.
“Hi Astoria. Wonderful to see you too.” Draco smiles as she pecks him on the cheek. What surprises me is how close he is with his ex-wife. I assume either they split on good terms or keep up the act for Scorp, but I suspect the former.
"I will throw you back on that bed if you're not careful." Is all he says, but he's smiling. He grabs my hand and drags me out of the room. I'm cautious, checking to make sure no one is around as we walk down the landing.
She agreed to help, leading them into the cafe office to start on the poster. Within a couple hours, the pair of them had done several laps of the neighbourhood, posting the fliers wherever they could.
When I wake the next morning, sunlight is streaming in gently through the windows and the plug has stopped moving about. I sit up in bed, letting a soft yawn slip through my lips. The event starts of last night rush to my head and I feel a blush settle on my cheeks. Speaking of, I can feel a slight soreness on my asscheeks from daddy’s spanking. Not knowing the time, I decide to get up. I pad downstairs in my panties and hoodie, my feet gentle on the hardwood flooring. I don’t hear any noise coming from the kitchen so I assume Draco is still asleep.
"This is why I hate dealing with gangs." I heard the female officer mutter. Both mine and Draco's heads whipped to look at her.
“She hates the gang.” I shrug.
”Sorry, gang? And who’s the blue haired kid?” Astoria repeats, confused.
“That’s the name he has when he arrived at the adoption shelter,” Granger lied easily. But Draco wasn’t born yesterday.
Draco searched quickly around the lounge, heading to his bedroom when there was no sign of the kitten.
“That’s what you think.” He mutters under his breath. “I’ll be your heir. I mean, I would want to if it was forced on me. Griffin King? Sounds dope. But I won’t move in. Not yet. Can I join before I move in?”
"What do you think, James?" She asked proudly as she stood back. James meowed in approval, jumping up into the coffee table so he was in view of his owner.
I shrugged it off. "That's alright Molly. Often bullies project their own problems onto others," I shot back, glaring at the twins. They looked proud of me, Fred nodding as George gave me a thumbs up.
"Will I have to testify?" I didn't look at him when I asked.
”Didn’t say you were.”
“Ah, Fantastic. Such a sweetheart isn’t he?” She comments. “Now, is there’s anyone else who can confirm you were at his house last night?”
"Ok it's still sharp but... it's kinder. Your jaw has softened a little, your eyes are a lot nicer. Experienced, wise."
“I found a charm. I knew it existed somewhere. All I need to do is find James. I haven’t practised but I know the wand movement, which is where the magic comes from.”
"I'm so close, baby." He says, following it with another moan. I try to reply, but I can only whimper. He leans back, using the new angle to thrust deeper into me, yet more erratically as we both edge closer to climax.
"I wasn't going to."
"Oh, I'd forgotten..." Draco muttered. James went to sit on Draco's lap, peering at him in the gap between his torso and the clock, which he was holding still. He placed the clock down beside him, carefully watching James. "You're certainly more clever than I gave you credit for."
The cat looked at him with wide eyes, as if begging for help and he couldn't help but comply.
”Yes, mother.” I grinned. She went to swat me, but I ducked out of her reach, making sure not to spill the soup.
“Draco and I are fucking, I guess. Or will be, sometime. And Zabini and Neville are definitely fucking. Malfoy and Zabini are police officers, if you couldn’t tell.”
”Look, Draco and I are going on a date on Friday, and I wanted to do something special for him, but I don’t know what he’s into. I thought you might know?”
"Yes, Gin. I have. So many times. But you keep ignoring me and keep pushing me away. I tried to love you, so many times I tried. I can't. I can't try anymore."
Jen didn't buy it.
Harry was silent.
"Frankly, Potter, I've had a long day and am far too tired to begin to discuss this with you." He spoke, managing to keep his voice calm despite the circumstances. Draco pushed past Harry, laying down on his bed gracefully.
”I hope you aren’t going to start complaining, baby boy. I might have to set some rules in place.” I frown, but perhaps the idea of rule said and... punishments won’t be a bad one. I feel him move from behind me to reach for the bottle on the cabinet, but when he kneels back behind my ass he doesn’t do anything for a second or so. I lift my butt into the air, wiggling it.
"Because they're scum." She spits. "They contribute nothing to society, they go around causing harm to others and damage to properties, disrupting people's lives. You're just blinded by your dick because you get to fuck the tranny." Not even a second later and Draco has sent a forceful fist into her jaw, leaving a large red mark on the skin and causing her lips to swell.
”Draco messaged me last night when you were there. It’s not concrete proof you were there’s, but he hadn’t no reason to lie about your location.” The police officer looks down at her notepad.
When I get home, I shower and dress quickly, slipping on the thong underneath my jeans. I take a minute to see how they look. Luna was right, it does match my eyes. Teddy, who readily agreed to come with me to meet Scorpius, and I were both surprised when the doorbell rang at exactly seven. I ran downstairs, out of breath when I opened the door to see a very smart looking Draco.
In all of this confusion, I find myself gazing at Draco, and suddenly I am aware of the throbbing in my crotch. Thanks to the testosterone, as well as making my clit strangely big, it also hugely increased my libido. And now I was horny. While surrounded by Draco’s family. Crap.
“You were. And how many spanks do you think you deserve for that?”
”Then let me worry about you.” He raised an eyebrow.
”Big age difference then, huh. What do your folks think of the age difference?”
"Your mug, you twit."
”Boyfriend’s place. Had a date. Stayed for coffee. Lots of coffee.” I send a wink their way before trying to find everyone else, a fairly easy task since the other three of my housemates were all in the kitchen.
“I’ve let everyone know about their... shares.” She begins, being careful with her wording thanks to our guest. “They’ll be over today sometime. We’ve all got ours and Luna already stopped by with Ginny.”
“He doesn’t have to.” Granger frowns. “But if you want to, we’re all ears.” She adds, turning to face me.
Draco explained his situation, with Melissa pausing him every few seconds to stroke the cat, who seemed to be loving the attention.
“It’s... Sorry. I’ve never really told anyone before. Like I said, a bit lonely.”
“Hey Teddy. How’s my favourite godson doing?” I ask cheerily, closing the door behind me.
“He deserves to,” he replied. “It will break his heart but he loves you more than anything.”
“Pans... how long has it been? Seriously. Six, seven years?”
“It’s entirely possible,” the redhead shrugged.
The needle quickly but gently sank into my skin, and the familiar tingle danced in the area as Draco pushed the syringe down. Once done, he stuck a small plaster over the area and tidied the stuff up.
“Trying to get home quickly. Friends get worried and I can’t have them prowling the streets for me late at night again. You lot have had ‘em in for it.” Blondie looks in thought for a second and then speaks.
"Ok, Tyler, I'm going to go in with the swab now. If you begin to feel nervous, I want you to concentrate on keeping your breathing steady. Officer Zabini is here if you need him, OK? Anything you say here won't leave this room. You can trust us." As she leant in, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up to Blaise. His eyes said everything. I shook my head at him.
It was past midnight.
”It’s alright for you to say that. You’re gay! Of course you think it’s good.”
”Leave some for me.” Blondie speaks up, making ‘Cissy’ and Astoria back off.
"If I was a stranger I'd trust your face."
"What're you doing?"
Melissa heard, earning him a slap on the arm.
"He's in the line-up thinking he's filling in. Obviously, the other four men who'll also be there are actors." He briefed me as we drove there. "Most times we get each person to step forward and say something, so maybe think of something he said, but that could also be used in any other assault. Sorry, that's worded weirdly," he backtracked. "Don't let it be specific to you."
"Christ, you ok? You look awful. Not to be rude."
After being called to dinner, Teddy spends most of it asking me about the Griffins. He tries on multiple occasions to get me to tell him about the crimes we commit, but I knew Andromeda would throw me out if I told him.
Draco and I share a shower, touching each other intimately but non-sexually, soft kisses here and there as he massages my scalp. He lets me take control when I clean myself out, slightly annoyed I had done this before his cum dried in me, and he watched with a small chuckle at my annoyed expression.
"Fuck, baby. I'll never get used to this." He bends over me, kissing me roughly. Without waiting long, he began thrusting hard into me. Each thrust brings a moan from my lips, and if that wasn't enough, one of his hands slides down to my crotch and begins to play with me. Unable to think about anything other than the ecstasy I felt, I ran my ahnds through his hair, gripping it sharply to hold myself in reality. Draco lets out a deep groan, before pulling my bottom lip between his teeth.
"Can't a guy come see his favourite godson?"
"She enjoyed it, every last second of it."
“Draco, you fingered me twice. You’re hardly my husband.” I speak, not caring if either Teddy or Andromeda can hear me.
”I’ll fuck you right here on the landing if you call me that again.” He says, punctuating the sentence by smacking my ass. I yelp, and don’t complain further as he sets me down in the bathroom, locking the door behind us. We undress and jump in, and I let out soft moans as he massages my scalp and gently washes me. It was strange having someone wash me, but fuck if I didn’t love seeing him get hard again.
"Miss Potter," a horrible voice growls as a hand grabs my neck, squeezing tightly and pushing me against the fence. I'm forced to look at my attacker, seeing the fat fuck Goyle glaring at me like I'm a piece of shit on his shoe. My hand flies to his hand, trying to pull it away from my neck as I gasp for air.
She went to reply but they were interrupted by a loud mew and James began to paw at Draco’s ankle.
“Well, a kiss is more intimate, isn’t it?” Neville’s voice was quiet.
"Roughed him up a little. Got him right in the nuts." Zabini gave me a look. "Low blow, yeah, I get it. Bloody deserved it though. Snape told me to take the day off though, to go see Harry. I'll see you tomorrow."
“I suggest you learn the difference between sex and gender. But I’m a dude with a dick.”
Draco turns to face me, slipping his arms around my waist and letting his hands rest on my ass.
"Happy birthday!" She smiled, leaning up to press a kiss to his cheek.
He thanked her, but before he left the room to pay, she stopped him.
When I arrived, I didn't bother knocking, but Ron was quick in trying to stop me from seeing Harry.
"Don't apologise. I can't get into it, but it's not your fault. You didn't know - no one does - so don't feel guilty."
"Cor blimey, Harry!" Charlie cried, grabbing my leg in jest.
"Ron," I said, as calmly as I could. "I know what happened. Let me see my boyfriend." He stepped aside, and I took a few deep breaths as I climbed the stairs, knowing my blood pressure was probably through the roof.
Draco was not childlike in the way he unwrapped the gifts. He was meticulous, unfolding paper and carefully removing tape like it was an exam.
"Love you too, James," Draco replied, watching the kitten closely.
"Before you ask, no, he hasn't jumped me. Hasn't even tried to kiss me." 'Not properly, anyway' Draco could tell Harry wanted to add.
"Who killed Marcus?" Someone shouted. Others murmered in agreement. This time Draco stepped forward to answer.
"Such a perfect ass, baby. Can't wait to be inside it." This send a wave of warmth through me, and I spread my legs further. His head dives between them again, licking my hole before his tongue dives into it. I can't tell how long he spends down there but it has a chain of moans and happy sighs falling from my mouth before he finally pulls back. He grabs a pillow, propping it under my hips before he reaches into a drawer and pulls out a bottle - lube. I hear the cap flip open and it's a couple seconds before a cold, slick finger is pressing at my hole. I press against it, quietly moaning Draco's name as it slips in. His lips press against the small of my back as he waits for me to get used to the intrustion. "You're doing so well for me baby. So good." Another kiss and I wiggle my ass, getting him to move his finger. He pushes it in and out a few times, curling it as well, before a second lube-covered finger presses into me. This time he doesn't wait before he begins to scissor the digits, stretching my hole a little further each time. I shove my face into the mattress so the rest of the household can't hear the loud moan I let out. This annoys Draco.
“They wouldn’t care. They know what it’s like to have their closest friends turn their back on them. Griffins are loyal. Plus it’s not weak to take a dick up the ass. That’s the manliest shit ever. Having someone shove a whole cock up there. It ain’t easy.”
He let the cat down onto the bed before slipping under the covers himself, smiling gently as it moved to lay at the top end of the bed.
”Uh, Packer?” I explain, embarrassed.
”Hey Dean. Seamus? I didn’t expect to see you here.” The Irish boy looks up at me with a wonky smile.
"You're only going to get undressed anyway. It's a shower. You get naked and then you get wet."
"I don't think I'll enquire into that."
“James?” Draco called entering the flat, like he was coming home to a spouse. The kitten came bounding down the stairs, the pat pat pats of his paws on the carpet warming Draco inside-out.
Warning for blatant transphobia from Goyle (who’s surprised)(not me)(also he’s back)
“It’s my right to decide whether or not I tell him. And if he never finds out, then I can pretend like it never happened, he won’t look at me like I’m a piece of shit and everything will be normal.” Blaise was silent for a minute.
Once I’m out of the bathroom, towel around my waist, I sneak a peak downstairs to see who’s at the door. Seeing a familiar crop of bright blond hair alongside a short crop of dark brown hair, I frown and head back to my room to dress.
"Please, continue." Draco shrugged, leaning back in his chair.
"Happy birthday Draco!" Melissa yelled as he opened the door. "Sorry, your other front door was left open." She took a minute to glance as his appearance before she stepped inside. "Nice tat. Why're you dressed like a wizard?" She giggled, heading on inside. Behind where she had been stood was Millie, who was now staring at his Dark Mark.
"Old."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Say another fucking word about the gangs or Harry and it'll be your murder that's being investigated." He hisses, before throwing her to the floor. "Come back here again and I'll turn my eye to whatever these kids do to you." He walked back over to me, placing a protective arm around my waist and pulling me close to him. "Sorry, that got a bit out of hand, but the way she spoke about you made me see red." He said quietly to me.
“If you want. We have a few houses, plenty of room. I understand if you don’t want to move out.”
Our two favourite boys getting it on. Just how it should be. And also some family. Not in the sex. But in the chapter. You know what I mean. Start reading you horndog!
Draco could only watch Ginerva Weasley began interrogating Harry, her voice becoming louder with each question. Draco was glad they were the only people in the café, otherwise he'd have had to step in after question number three.
"No, you wanted to get married. Started planning for a wedding when I hadn't even proposed. I wasn't planning on proposing either, given your attitude towards me.
His and Jen's eyes followed the redhead's almost predatory walk to where Harry was sitting. Harry looked up when his name was called and panic set in on his face loudly. He looked over to Draco who smiled reassuringly. It was really all he could do given the subtle yet angry expression on the visitor's face.
“Harry. No offence, cuz I know you’re into that kind of shit, but I ain’t one for giving or taking it up the ass. Unless it’s a woman. A female woman. I’m not gay!” His voice getting louder as I close the door to my room behind me. He wouldn’t have to worry for a while. The only way to contact Seamus was to go through the police station, aka Draco, and who knew when he would next arrive. Well, whenever I saw Draco next, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on what he was packing.
Draco lay on his side so James could curl up next to him as he talked.
“Cheers. You still by yourself?”
He does as I say, stepping on the pedal and rushing us back home.
“Oh, Ok. I’ll leave you be.” His voice was... off. Like he knew something had happened. Of course he would, he’s smart and pays attention.
"Don't worry James," he shouted from where he stood, a light laugh in his voice, as the meowing continued. He spelled the small cuts closed, running his finger lightly over the small scars. They'd disappear in a day. "James?" He called once it went silent.
Unfortunately his guest was a bitch and stuck their foot into the door before it could close. It opened back up, revealing his ex-best friend.
The redhead held out one of the flyers. “We’re here for our cat.”
”Daddy wait!” Draco leans back into the room curiously. “Can I borrow a hoodie, daddy?” I ask, gesturing to my mostly naked body. He rolls his eyes before disappearing for a second, returning with a light grey hoodie. I slip it on quickly, pulling the sleeves over my hands and immediately being surrounded by his scent. I lean up on my tip toes and press a kiss to his cheek. “Goodnight Daddy.” I say gently.
“The Griffins? I think my cousin mentioned them before. Do they do a lot of crimes?”
No update for a couple of days sorry, but I've been through and edited pretty much all the mistakes I could see so hopefully it's at least better to read.
"Ok."
"Green," He spoke softly. I leant down, pressing a gentle kiss to his lips. He took a second to return it. As much as I had missed him, I didn't press further. I waited for him to pull away. When he did, I moved my thumb across to his cheek, gently rubbing a small circle but not applying any pressure.
Eventually Harry relaxed and Draco carried him up to their bed, tucking him in a little as Harry slept off what he had just been through. Draco didn't truly understand what exactly Harry had been through, but he had been carrying it for years, and Draco understood the toll that has on a person.
“You’re 19. You’re kids to us.”
“Enough about me. Tell me about yourself.”
“Harry?” Draco asks cautiously.
"If you say so..." she trailed off. Perhaps I wasn't as seamless as I had hoped. "While you're here, I was wondering if you wanted to come to dinner with the family tomorrow? Charlie's back in town, so's Percy by some wild luck, so mum's having a big lunch. Invited Ron and I obviously, and she wanted to extend an invitation to you too. She knows you're busy with everything but she hasn't seen you in years."
James meowed a reply, before nuzzling his nose against Draco's cheek.
“Can I ask for your name, your real one?” She asked calmly.
I shook my head, "I've been avoiding him. He's had the past couple days off and I've managed to keep him away. And don't even bother telling me he deserves to know, because I heard it all from Blaise."
No. No. Not when. If. I’m only getting done for speeding. I can pay the fine easy. They won’t search my car for drugs. I’m fine.
Draco looked quickly to his coworker, Jen.
“Don’t worry about him. And yes, the duffel bag at the end of my bed. I’ve already had some, so my share will be smaller than usual.”
“Ask your father. He’s a big fan.” I can barely handle my anger. I thought getting done for speeding was way simpler than this? Douchebag throws a pink card onto the table and it slides to me. I take one glance and look away.
“Gender?”
“So, name?” He asks, putting the license away in his pocket.
“You sure about that?”
"Morning to you too, daddy." I walk past him, pecking his cheek on the way, and head into the kitchen to get a drink and some painkillers. I pour a coffee from the pot in the corner of the room, taking a sip as I look out the window above the sink. I jump when someone speaks to me.
”I’m not gay.” Teddy argues.
Also Draco’s POV? Was that fun?
The door opened, revealing a bright looking Luna carrying a tray.
”How is it better than with a woman? Women are so soft are supple and they just...” Dean sighed.
"It's off James, I think. It's hard to interpret his meowing sometimes." Melissa admitted with a light chuckle.
"Did Draco do this?" He asked after a moment, voice unsteady. "Because if he'll did, then he'll bloody pay for it!"
substance into yourself, I do, yeah. Sorry for worrying about my own boyfriend.” His tone softened me, in some way I hadn’t never felt before. He was worried about me, genuinely. Perhaps in a way no one had ever been worried about me before. I stopped being a brat.
By some miracle of Merlin and Morgana, Draco actually slept in that morning. Something which has only happened once in his life, on a day which sleeping in was certainly not an option. It may or may not have been on the day of his final, and main, exam at University, the exam which was make or break on his entire future.
The cat mewed at him loudly, its bright green eyes taking in him as he did, it. Draco smiled a little when it moved forward towards him, obviously feeling safer, but he noticed the small limp it had as it walked.
The rest of the day passed peacefully. Draco worked, he worried, and worked some more. As he was sweeping the floor of the empty café in the dark evening, a knock on the glass door brought him out of his thoughts. He looked up to see Harry waiting outside with a smile. He motioned to come in, the door still open, and Harry hurried in with a look in his eye Draco was fond of.
He threw Harry a glare, who quickly retreated to his own side of the bed. Relaxing a little, Draco rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling as Harry rustled the bed sheets, finding a comfortable spot.
"Oh," was all he said. 'DNA' pretty much gave it away without me having to retell the details. "Does Draco know?"
“You want to turn my cat inside out?”
Unfortunately, I don’t get out as quickly as I had hoped. I’m hauled into the holding cell by Officer Dickwipe with all the drunks until I can be picked up. While I wait, I take every chance I can to steal a glance at Blondie. His towering frame and icy gaze has me hooked, not to mention the thought of what’s under his uniform. Fuck, if I could get him alone for a few minutes-
"Baby you're so perfect." He whispers, holding me close to him as he pulls the covers over us. Despite the cum seeping out of my ass, I fall asleep quickly in Draco's arms.
”You actually think I’m going to go to work? How have you survived this long?”
"I just want to say it first one day, alright? Can I at least have that?" Harry cried, but, much like Draco, he could never be angry at the other.
Draco led his mother up to his flat, neither of them talking on the way. He didn’t even need to call for the cat when he entered, James instead bounding up to him regardless, brushing up against his legs and purring to his owner.
Sorry I’ve been gone for so long, also no smut this chapter (I really want to get some in soon though I promise!!). Enjoy loves xx
“You’ve upset him now,” Pansy tutted with a smirk.
"You won't. Because how many times have I told you simple things about me, and how many times have you ignored that? Do you not understand? I wasn't happy being with you. Yes, I was wrong to run off. But I'm so much happier with Draco than I ever was with you. Please just accept that whatever we had is over."
”He stole my towel and shut me out my room, alright? That’s all that happened.”
