Draco was still hanging onto Harry’s every word. “Yeah.”
Obviously, everyone in their life has felt guilt. It was a silly thing to ask, and much
He shouldn’t have been so occupied by the fact that his Transfigurations exam was in Slughorn’s room, but he unfortunately was.
He remembered how they both hadn’t had as bad of dreams when they slept next to each other. How Harry’s presence was so much more than comforting.
Then came the discussion of taking up occupancy in the middle of one of the corridors. Potter had said they could take pillows and blankets from either of their common rooms and make a little spot to sleep anywhere in the castle. Draco had almost slapped him due to creating such a stupid idea. He was not going to sleep on the fucking ground. But then he had remembered their new found truce, and restrained the urge. Not that he would have slapped him or hurt him anyway, he was trying to be a better person, and that would have taken him back
Blaise and Pansy’s faces were lit up like a Christmas tree, and their smiles nearly took up their entire face. They knew damn well this is what he’d always wanted in life, had wanted since he had heard of the great hero Harry Potter at the age of three. Draco’s face was failing to conceal boredom; he couldn’t help but smile at all the attention he was receiving. It was all quite overwhelming, when he really thought about it, but the sheer ridiculousness and surprise of the situation canceled all of his anxieties out.
If he could choose what activities he would do on his birthday, he would choose spending the day with Harry and only Harry. They would go out to lunch together- somewhere casual, and then go out to dinner together- somewhere fancy. They would spend the day walking around London, maybe going to the park, and finding random activities to fill the day.
Radio. Not a radish. Draco ought to remember that. “Cool,” Draco said nonchalantly, but on the inside, he was jumping with glee.
“What was that? Draco-”
She lightly touched his chest and Draco groaned in agony from the contact. She jerked her hand back, realizing she had just hurt him.
The portraits on the walls were blurry as Draco ran by them. Everything was ten times more blurry than usual.
“Fine. Whatever. But if you waste our day because you don’t want to offer up a secret of yours, I will be
His forearm
Harry’s face fell drastically. “What are you talking about?”
The ground was so cold, the world so wet and gloomy, thunder and lightning creating a horrifying show all around them.
He was working with a certified moron.
I love Draco and Harry so much. Even though they're both dumbasses. Say 'I' if you agree.
Potter sighed and rubbed at his eyes under his glasses.
“I’m doing okay, Headmistress.”
Draco shook his head morosely and Potter glowered deeply.
“So, I guess we just walk in,” Potter said.
Granger, with her hair a frizzy mess, tied up in a knot on the top of her head, looking worriedly around the room. He thought that she was trying to look for him, that maybe someone had tipped her off that he was very badly injured in this room. But she didn’t seem to see him, and instead she said to herself, “Where is my bloody quill?”
“Do you know what happened to him?”
When they had left the Room of Requirement that morning, Potter suggested they should check their common rooms to see if anyone was awake. Draco knew Potter was being far too optimistic, but he told him yes, to ease Potter’s mind a bit. He was also trying to be nice. That was what nice people did, right? They sometimes agreed to other people’s suggestions, even when they were stupid.
“Sorry!” They said, backing away and picking up a book they had dropped.
Elizabeth straightened up and then started to laugh. “Draco, you
Harry cupped his cheek. “Draco, I would never, ever run away again.”
He needed Harry. He wondered why he wasn’t here in place of Pansy- not that he didn’t want Pansy’s company.
“We’ve written a couple letters to each other. He didn’t come back for this year though, since Vincent’s death hit him pretty hard.” Draco had also been overcome with a large amount of grief over his old friend’s death, but he had accepted the fact that he was gone by now. He hadn’t really been Draco's friend by the end of seventh year, he had been more of a henchman, but Draco was still upset he was gone.
Maybe Draco had been wrong, maybe Potter didn’t feel what Draco thought he felt. Maybe.
For a second, he thought this was death. He thought he was dead. But he already knew what death felt like, it felt lonely and distant, it felt loveless and uncertain; it felt like a world where Harry Potter would never forgive him, where he would always be the villain in Harry’s eyes.
“You’re here.”
Draco spoke up for the first time since entering, directing his eyes at Theo. “Don’t speak to me again,” he said, his voice monotone. Theo didn’t respond, but Draco assumed he got the message. He wanted to bring up something about how Theo and his group quite literally assaulted him after therapy group weeks ago--mostly to see how angry Blaise could get--but he decided against it. Besides, he could bring it up another time when he wanted Blaise to punch Theo. (Which happened a lot.)
Draco wanted to be left alone so he could perish in peace. He didn’t want Harry, of all people, seeing him in agony from foolishly running into a wall. He was pretty sure his nose was bleeding, and when he looked at his fingers that had been clutching it before Harry had fallen on top of him, they came back stained a dark red, and he groaned even more.
“I sort of look at it like this: there will always be some sort of crisis going on in our lives. Whether we like it or not. Sure, I might be scared about the future and not knowing exactly what will happen, but that’s just a part of life, I think. You just have to- live on.”
Draco thought that was a very wise thing to say. He ought to remember what Potter had said so he could think back on it and use it when times got dark, and he felt something terrible was bound to come out of the genuine good moments.
Drys gave him a pitiful smile, contradicting everything Draco had believed. Alec gave a loud groan. It was
Draco nodded his head, and then realized Harry probably couldn’t see him, so he said: “Yes.”
Blaise wiped away the hint of blood that dotted his hands and glared down at Theo.
He tried to conjure up his knowledge of all the places Harry liked to go to be alone. He wouldn’t be in the Room of Requirement, obviously, and he wouldn’t have gone back outside, so those options were crossed off his mental list. He could have gone to the Garden of Mystics, but Draco doubted he would choose to go somewhere so obvious; somewhere where Draco would find him easily.
...I'll keep coming back to you.
“Harry of course not! I didn’t even consider it! I could never hurt you!”
Unlike the room he was currently standing in, which was full of life and color, lots of decorations and family photographs littered about the place. It had a homey feel that Draco had never experienced before while living at the Manor.
More secrets. Misplaced trust.
He knelt down in front of Harry, taking Harry’s right arm and holding it out in front of him. There were words on the back of his hand, but Draco couldn’t quite make them out.
His eyes scanned around the room, he observed how happy everyone was, smiling and laughing with their friends. It was like no war had taken place there at all. During the summer, Draco knew that a huge team of wizards had come to help return Hogwarts back to its former glory. They had done an excellent job. It looked like it had always looked before. However, the feeling was just wrong. Like something had been sucked out of the atmosphere. He hoped he wasn’t the only one who felt that feeling. He couldn’t tell if he was the only one, since everyone seemed to be content with their lives by the look of light on their faces.
Cool breezes brushed past them as they all ate and chatted and laughed, and the beginning of summer had officially begun. Draco was nineteen now. A student who had passed all of his NEWTs, and had only one more day of classes to go to. He had a boyfriend. Two best friends. Multiple acquaintances and a world full of people who, despite recent
He slowly opened his eyes, not wanting to see Potter’s reaction, but also curious as to how he would react, at the same time.
“The other Death Eaters, you mean,” Draco said in a flat tone.
“I know. I was going to McGonagall’s office, remember?” Draco lifted one of his eyebrows.
but now you want to stop and do-” Draco gestured at Drys’s pointed wand- “whatever it is you’re about to cast over me, and you’re making time for a bloody duel. What happened to the urgency, Drys?”
“Yes, go have a marvelous time with the devil himself and his little sidekick. I’ll probably still be up by the time you get back.”
“Yeah, Yeah,” Potter sighed and grabbed a new book from the pile.
Draco flipped through the book, hoping one of the pages would provide them with some sort of answer, but they were all a blank slate.
In all honesty, every moment with Harry was extraordinary. All because Harry was simply Harry. The most extraordinary person. The person who Draco loved. The person who Draco had loved for so many years, throughout the worst times of his life, even if he had only realized it a couple days ago.
“I made a terrible, terrible mistake, Professors,” Draco said. The only reason he had admitted that out loud, was because he deeply felt he
“I think this is all my fault. Why else would all this be happening? Someone’s trying to get revenge on me for killing Voldemort. The same guy in your vision-thing is most definitely the same guy who cast the sleeping curse, and put up a ward so we can’t leave or contact anyone. This is probably his sick idea of getting back at me. So, I’m sorry you were dragged into this mess with me.”
The world was spinning, everything moving uncontrollably fast, while also slow. The ringing in Draco’s ears intensified greatly, and the sting that constantly emanated from his left forearm increased.
becoming way too cluttered with question after question regarding the whole curse, and newly added on to the list, magical wards encasing them.
“Don’t think like that. Our good luck streak can still continue, this is just a little bump in the road,” Potter said softly, like he was speaking to a child.
He didn’t want to have to choose, but this really was it. Harry would die either way, because of him. There truly was no other option.
Draco didn’t even bother trying to grab the book from Harry. He was sore in many different places and his vision was coming back to him slowly, he didn’t want another altercation that would result in himself surely getting hurt again. Harry seemed fine. His apparent head injury he’d had just a few minutes ago was long gone, and he was peering down at
“Anything in particular that you’re thinking about?”
“Mhm.” No, he wouldn’t.
“Leaving Hogwarts in a couple of days?”
“Yeah, okay.”
The new found confidence in him allowed himself to apologize to a number of people; including most Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and teachers and ghosts in general.
“Thank you.”
. Somehow I had fended him off, and I can’t even begin to think what I did to make that happen.”
“What are your plans for after Hogwarts?” Harry asked, shifting to look at Draco.
Harry leaned forward on his elbows. “But Draco, you’re alive. And you saved
“Draco.”
Weasley, who was facing Harry, which meant he was also facing Draco’s direction, started to say something, when he obviously realized they were being overheard and watched.
“Sorry, Pans, I just don’t really feel like talking about it.”
He didn’t mind Blaise, really. He was an alright bloke. They never really spoke to each other, they seemed to only be around the other when Pansy was there.
He and Harry stood there for what felt like ten minutes, keeping a close eye out for any changes, and from what they could observe, nothing happened.
“Yeah, let’s not get into that.”
Potter frowned. “Wait, aren’t you still injured?”
“No,” he answered honestly. He finally moved his head to look at Harry. “Do you?”
of steps.
It was all just so strange, everything that had occurred within the past 24 hours. First his Mark had awoken, then the weird dream-like-vision, and then finally everyone in Hogwarts mysteriously falling under some kind of sleeping spell. Now that Draco thought about it all together, it seemed silly
Now, combine Fridays and Kaspian and you have
This time when Draco tried to sit up all the way, he was successful. Pansy was still rubbing his arm and his mother clearly wanted to embrace Draco in some way, but didn’t want to disrupt Pansy at the same time.
“Then why the fuck would I want you to wake everyone up? Just to be subjected to some dark wizard’s rule.”
He did not want to die this way. He survived the fucking Dark Lord, he could survive a couple of grief stricken teenagers. That was, if he could find his stupid wand in time to save himself…
“That’s a nice thought, isn’t it? I hope you end up being right,” Potter mused while tapping his foot against the leg of the table.
His mind was racing with only one thought.
“I know the Curse was horrible, and what Drys did was wrong, no matter the intentions. And what he did revolved around my family and I, he wanted me to suffer, no matter the outcome; and he got his wish, but...” he positioned his head so that he could look directly at Harry, and Harry followed suit. “What he didn’t realize, what he didn’t plan, was that I would come out of it all with this.” He took a breath. “Everything that’s happened has led me to you.”
Drys’s plan was a trap in and of itself. There was no right, good, or better choice.
“Well, yes. You falling on top of me didn’t really change that fact,” Draco huffed.
Although, Draco would try his hardest to succeed, given that Harry’s life was on the line along with hundreds of others.
What was also surprising was that they were talking; like actually having a real-people-conversation without the extreme awkwardness. It was good. Really fucking good.
“I slept in your bed. That’s weird.”
“Why certainly, Mrs. Malfoy. You can stay for as long as you like,” McGonagall said politely as she sat down in her chair. Draco followed suit, and carefully lowered himself into the seat opposite McGonagall.
“What’s this, you actually being helpful now?”
“Wow. This is really nice, and not at all what I was expecting,” Potter said as he walked farther in, closing the door behind him and admiring every aspect of what the Room of Requirement had created.
Draco took a deep breath. He knew he didn’t have to push himself, but he wanted to. He trusted Harry with his life, so why not entrust him with seeing his messed up body?
He did however, have one accomplishment in his pitiful life, and that was befriending Harry Potter. He was actually really good friends with Harry, and he felt having Harry in his life was the most important thing he could ask for. Having Harry in his life was the only present he needed.
It was not fine.
, and lived.
“I guess it’s my turn to tell you my reason for returning.” Harry brushed crumbs off of his trousers. “The world felt off, after the war. I was living with the Weasleys and they were great and all, very loving and sweet, but the atmosphere in the house was wrong. I thought it was because of Fred’s death, and I think that was a part of it, but I knew it was something else. I reckoned I needed a change of scenery, you know? I didn’t get out of the Burrow that much over the summer, and mostly stayed in bed. I knew something was wrong with me, and I figured returning to Hogwarts would fix whatever was wrong with me.”
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but they continued to kiss and kiss and kiss and Draco was content.
Next update *some time in the near future*
Draco considered their options for a moment. “I guess you can start working on defensive spells again. We really don’t have anything else to do until twelve tonight.”
She listened patiently while Draco continued talking.
He honestly couldn’t recount what Potter had exactly said, he’d been too preoccupied thinking of the fact that his mother was safe, that Potter was there, that Draco probably wouldn’t be going back to Azkaban,
. Which, in the cloaked man’s mind, was to betray Harry even more than Draco already had.
Another person had officially seen his mark of loyalty to the most evil of wizards. Fucking fantastic. At this point, he wished he would have just been left to die rather than know that one third of the “Golden Trio” had seen his Dark Mark.
“That’s good.”
The topics talked about in sessions were also non-beneficial to him. They were topics that only the “good” side could relate to. None of them had ever done terrible, terrible deeds. Well, except Pansy, who apparently wanted to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord to save her own skin. But that wasn’t even nearly as bad as the things Draco had done.
“Hey.” Harry’s voice was strained. It almost hurt to hear him talk.
Draco really was tired, and was at least somewhat glad they didn’t have to wait until twelve anymore to stir the stupid potion for fifteen minutes. Draco could go instantly to bed, curled up in Harry’s warm blankets that smelled of Harry’s soap, and fall asleep with the knowledge of someone right next to him, caring for him and protecting him.
It's not incredibly graphic, but it is there and may be triggering.
His father was awake; not subject to the sleeping curse. Which meant other people were awake too.
“It’s… something,” Draco managed. “You know I told you I didn’t want a party?”
“Hello,” Drys said in a calm tone, “how may I help you tonight?”
then I’ll kill him right here.”
He still had his endurance, surprisingly, and his legs carried him far and his mind filled with serenity. He ran for who knows how long, and walked along the edge of the Forbidden Forest for double that time, before he made his way up to the castle. It was dark out. Luckily, he hadn’t missed any classes.
many lives, not just mine. You’re a bloody hero-”
“Brilliant observation,” Draco honked as he gripped his nose firmly.
“Well, there could still be someone else. Everyplace was locked. Someone could very well be inside enjoying the peace and quiet without even knowing there’s a crisis going on.”
Draco had never kissed anyone as lovingly as he was kissing Harry, and he was scared he was doing something wrong. Harry was basically in control, Draco thought he was parting his lips fine, but Harry was most certainly better. Harry’s tongue grazed his teeth and his lips, and Draco tried to do the same to Harry, but he failed miserably, and let Harry do what he was good at.
Draco was mortified to learn that fact, and wished Potter hadn’t just ruined his all time favorite Quidditch team. “Yeah, well. Looks like Weasley is going to have to pick a new team to root for then.”
The world was extremely fuzzy when Draco attempted to open his eyes again. He didn’t know how long he’d been laying on the cold floor, but it seemed like a good amount of time had passed.
to read about and know the truth. There was no more hiding it. He’d be recognized everywhere he went for the rest of his life.
“Our Garden? Or Hogwarts?”
Potter took a step closer to Draco and tilted his head to the side. “Why?”
The two of them had spent a good amount of time in that room together, Draco stirring the potion while Harry sat on the nearest table and talked to him about anything. He figured it was a good, and sentimental, place to look.
“Maybe, you came in late today, just so you could work with
“That’s what I’m trying to say. There is literally no one else around. You're the first person I’ve seen up and awake.”
Finally, pulling apart, Harry said, “You’re just mad that I found it before you.”
It had been two days since Draco had come to his horrible realization, and he’d made sure not to act any differently around Harry.
He had always been scared of her. She was a powerful woman. He knew she didn’t like him very much, which made sense, he had been a down right pain in the arse during his younger years at Hogwarts. But, he was very grateful she let him return this year to Hogwarts. He could very well be at the manor right now, finishing out his probation there.
“So, throughout summer, autumn, and winter, I experimented on Snape’s book, figuring out how it worked. It was tricky, and well protected, I’ll tell you that, but nothing that was too tough for me to figure out in the end.”
“Thank you, Harry.” He felt a hint of tears forming in his eyes. He didn’t even think crying was possible again, considering how much he’d cried earlier. “Thank you, so much.”
“I had thought the tie belonged to Theo, you see. I thought Theo was a part of the Figure’s plan somehow, and I thought he had possibly done something to hurt you. But, it was Alec all along. After he took you out and brought you to Drys, he was going to do the same to me. But, I heard him under whatever fancy untraceable Disillusionment Charms he placed, and I wanted to find out who was making the noises.
Draco let out a short, non-comical laugh. “But I don’t want him to wait. He’s suffering. All this avoidance is making him miserable. I know I should tell him how I feel, or at least why I’ve been avoiding him, but I can’t. I just can’t.”
done?
charm, only to see that he had a minute to spare before class started. He would never make it on time. He was on the seventh floor. Transfigurations was far from where he was now.
His mother was still under house arrest, of course, too. But, given the recent circumstances, they allowed her out of the Manor to see Draco as long as she always had an Auror around to watch her.
“I’m sorry,” Potter finally said. “I hadn’t meant to leave you-” Draco scoffed- “I thought you would have been sleeping longer, so I got up to go and take a little walk outside and clear my head. I planned on being back before you woke, but that obviously didn’t happen. I’m sorry that I scared you.” Potter looked quite sheepish by the time he finished speaking.
He threw back the covers, not caring how messy his bed looked, and made a cool and collected stride to Harry’s bed, carefully trying to not trip over anything in the dark and make a fool of himself. It wasn’t like Harry could really see him, especially without glasses, but the thought was humiliating enough.
After a moment, McGonagall let out a sigh. “Mr. Malfoy, as much as you might try to hide it, I can tell you are in pain. If you do not feel comfortable talking with me, which I completely understand, would you be open to the idea of private counseling sessions with Elizabeth? You wouldn’t have to attend the group sessions anymore, of course.”
It was probably the most comfort he had ever received in his life, and he was glad it was Harry who was comforting him.
, as he sat in the snow. Potter continued to stand over him, but wasn’t looking down at Draco.
After a while Jorah Davis and his Ravenclaw boyfriend, Sam, joined their group. He held polite conversation with them, nursing his Fire Whiskey after he abandoned his Butterbeer.
A lot had changed. Now, even though being alone with Harry was all Draco had thought about in the Hospital Wing, it was just
Draco hoped she wouldn’t hug him, just because of the fact that he knew if she did his whole body would hurt, and Narcissa seemed to read his mind. Instead of going in for a hug, she reached down to brush the hair back out of his eyes. Just like she’d always done when he was little.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. He was most likely waiting for Draco to say something.
Nothing happened. Draco was truly starting to think Harry had died.
trying.
Harry was right there, in front of the doors leading to the Great Hall.
The possibility of
“Please,” he breathed.
He tried not to watch Harry’s eyes following him as he walked over to his bed, pulling on his shoes and gathering up his wand and a couple of books into his bag. He felt extremely self-conscious, and knew Harry was probably judging him severely, but he pulled himself together, trying to remind himself what Harry thought of his outfit did not matter.
Harry just so you could have his
He reluctantly took the potion from her and eyed it nervously. It had a greenish glow to it, and smelled foul.
“Come on, Malfoy. You know I’m right. I don’t want to be with you anymore than you do with me, but Hogsmeade seems like the best bet to find answers.”
No one knew all the true details save for a small group of people, but he was expecting some type of article soon about the truth, based on what the Aurors had seen in the Pensieve. Everyone knew that Aurors couldn’t keep their bloody mouths shut.
“Yeah,” Draco said as he made his way slowly towards the fireplace.
lowered his mental shields last night before he slept. He remembered feeling flustered and detesting the world, so he had slipped out of his own wards before he slept.
“I guess so.”
Draco looked back at Alec again. Alec reminded Draco so much of himself, trying to impress his father, thinking he was working for a cause that would benefit the world.
He was about to continue on his way towards the bathroom to get ready when he remembered his vision, along with the horrid offer. “Before I forget,” Draco said, “I had another vision.”
“That sounds like an excellent plan.”
Harry reached for the book in Draco’s hands, attempting to pull it away from him, but Draco jumped up and out of his seat. He vaguely heard the crash of the chair he’d been sitting in hitting the ground as he backed away from Harry, the book still tightly held against his chest.
“I’m not scared,” Draco confirmed.
. But maybe it had been a part of his dream? He pulled up his sleeve to check once again, and much to his dismay, it was still moving, the color a deep black. His breath caught in his throat, and his mind instantly thought of sixth and seventh year when the Mark moved constantly, and burned terribly when the Dark Lord summoned him. He still couldn’t believe that the horrid tattoo was moving again. It was the worst sight Draco could ever lay his eyes upon.
“You were just saving Malfoy’s arse, once again. Malfoy was definitely the one who knocked over that jar, and you were just covering for him. You knew he would get yelled at by Slughorn if you told him the truth.”
“You know you forgot to return the Bloodroot vial, right?” Draco lifted an eyebrow.
Attached to the exam was a note from his Transfigurations teacher, Professor Wynn, writing to Slughorn because Draco had apparently gotten a perfect grade on the written exam, but Wynn was reluctant to give him an O. “
feel like talking about things.”
“Ugh!” Potter shouted, and Draco snickered. Potter moved to walk besides Draco, with enough distance between them that they wouldn’t accidentally touch each other.
“This?”
She’d been planning this for months now, and even though throughout all those months, Draco had begged for her not to throw a huge party, she knew Draco would love it and have a bloody brilliant time. She was absolutely sure of it.
“None of your business, Malfoy.”
“I just needed to tell you some things, about what exactly went down with Drys, and what he had said.”
“Oh,” Harry said.
“I know. We finally have a solution to this whole mess. That is, if the potion works.” Draco continued to read the ingredients over and over.
His silent tears turned into shaky sobs, and Harry pulled him close. He pulled Draco so close and held him so tight, that Draco cried some more just because of the sheer closeness. Something he had wanted for so long was this nearness, and he hated that he got it now, all because he was crying. It felt wrong. Forced.
about your mid-life crisis, Potter, I have more important business to attend to.” He almost forgot about his trip to McGonagall’s office in the midst of wondering why the halls were strangely empty and running into Potter. He was about to continue on his way when Potter spoke again, even more urgently this time.
“But I don’t know if they’re somehow suppressed, or whatever, since I’m now having these visions when I sleep. I haven’t had a nightmare in a while to be honest.”
awake because everyone hated him and would surely blame whatever happened to Hogwarts’ occupants on him.
They were walking back to the Room of Requirement when the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm started burning and moving like crazy. Luckily, they had been about a minute away from the Room, so Draco sped up his pace the rest of the way, Harry trailing behind in confusion.
But the definition of good was so loose; so flexible and ever-changing. Drys had the idea that he was doing good, and maybe he really was. Harry, on the other hand, was
“Yeah, you know, together.”
Slughorn had a response all written out too, lying on his desk. Draco picked it up and skimmed it over, basically learning that Slughorn thought he should be given a Poor grade for his work.
His heart rate increased dramatically, and Draco wondered if Harry could hear the insane rhythm. “Only if you want to be friends, I guess.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed. The word felt so intimate, so personal, and he, Draco Malfoy, got to say it. He thought that there wasn’t a word that existed in any language that sounded as perfect as
“You were the one who agreed to meet me. You could have easily said no,” she countered.
Draco shrugged.
Draco stuck his nose up in the air, turning his head away; however, it was just for show. He wasn’t really upset with Harry. He wanted to annoy him in a good-natured way. “It’s none of your business.”
But, he was beyond appreciative.
Draco nudged Harry with his elbow that was hidden under the blankets. “I promise I’m fine, you git. At least for now.”
Before they had both taken showers and gotten dressed for the day ahead, Draco had made sure to relay every last detail he could remember about his vision to Potter. However, he left out one small detail. The part about the figure’s offer to him.
She nodded her head and her face looked extremely sympathetic, like she understood what he was going through.
His dad’s body was somewhere amongst those wretched sods.
would find out about them sooner rather than later, too. They both didn’t mind, but they also knew it would result in Draco’s social status decreasing dramatically, along with Harry’s. Anyone with eyes could see how their relationship had changed; first starting out with avoidance since the Curse ended, and then about a month later changing to the two of them hanging out whenever possible. The
It was a slow kiss, sparks flying between them and eating Draco alive. It was perfect. Harry’s lips perfectly parted his own, soft and delicate. He tasted like treacle tart and all things sweet.
“Harry,” Draco croaked, “I- I just. Can you please stop?” The last part came out as inaudible, and sure enough, Harry leaned in closer to hear Draco more clearly.
book. No wonder it hadn’t worked when they’d tested it out on Theo.
everything really is.”
“Ugh! I just-” Something exploded.
Potter’s lashes fluttered and his forehead creased. “I haven’t had one in a while either.”
“Draco! I think I found it!”
Potter then looked back at Draco, and he seemed confused as to why Draco hadn’t retorted something snarky and rude.
“See you later?” Harry asked.
“Unlikely,” Draco challenged.
She planned parties for Wizards and Muggles alike, but of course when Muggles were involved she never let them see her using magic to do all the setting up.
Draco picked at his food, but eventually ate it. His appetite had improved, but the food tasted dull and lifeless.
“Draco?” Pansy’s voice rang through the night.
He set his mouth in a firm, straight line. He wasn’t going to respond back.
“Whatever you choose, just know it will be the right decision.”
While Potter was talking, the class had erupted into fits of laughter. Apparently it was absolutely
,” Draco stated.
The only parts that were pretty much crystal clear in Harry’s memories was the moment when Drys had cast Avada Kedavra, and Draco had ran in front of Drys, blocking the deadly curse from hitting Harry, and throwing the deadly Bloodroot potion at Drys instead.
“I love gifts,” Draco responded.
Draco was still making his way towards the Defense classroom when he felt a hand wrap around his wrist. His
which meant that he had to answer the original question.
“Malfoy-”
“I can cast my own spells, thanks,” Draco scowled.
Draco wasn’t sure what to do. His hands floated awkwardly behind Harry’s back, unsure as to whether he should embrace Harry in front of their friends, and quite possibly people who had stopped to witness the encounter.
- once more, but he continued to stand a safe distance from him, nodding in approval and matching the grin on Harry’s face with his own small smile.
“I just don’t like hearing the Dark Lord’s name, okay?”
“So, I’m guessing revealing one secret gets us all three questions?” Potter asked.
how to have a conversation with the other. They usually only ever insulted each other or had quick, unimportant discussions, like on Thursday when Potter had rescued Draco from that broom closet, or Potions class on Friday. Conversations about the whole sleeping curse didn’t really count. It was basically forced conversation. But now…
It dawned on him, that the only other person in the castle who even had the slightest possibility of being awake, was the same person who he and Harry had given the Restorative Potion to. The same person who they’d used as an unwilling test subject. The same person who hated Draco’s guts.
“No it wasn’t,” Draco said evenly. Potter finished wiping away his tears and turned to look at Draco. “That was quite noble of you to share that. Especially to share that with me.”
“There’s only one way to find out. We have to talk to the man who wrote the book.”
Draco rested his forehead against one hand, catching a glimpse of his own owl and waiting for it to fly over to him.
Draco knew for absolute certainty that he’d found what he was looking for. What he’d wanted all along. He’d found home, and Harry had found it too.
“Hey.” Harry nudged Draco. “You look sad.”
“You’re going to have to come with me,” the Death Eater said, then turned around to look at his comrades. “Find the woman and boy.”
When class officially ended, Draco rushed out as fast as he could. Potter had tried to say something to him, but Draco didn’t want to hear it. He knew he couldn’t avoid Potter’s apologies or whatever he felt the need to say to Draco forever, they had DADA. next together, where Potter would inevitably carry out his quest to try to speak to Draco. Luckily, Pansy was in that class, so it would be much harder to get Draco alone to talk to him. Though, Draco supposed Potter didn’t need to speak to him alone, and would probably stalk right up to where Pansy and him sat and say what he wanted to say.
He did. Oh Merlin he did.
Everyone watched in awe as she strode through the room, right up to the Aurors. She began whispering rapidly to them, her eyes dark and her lips firm.
“Yeah.” Draco had thought of his mother almost constantly. He hoped she was alright.
That’s when Draco realized Potter was in his class. Shouldn’t he already be down there? What was he doing all the way up here? Draco's mouth moved before his brain could even comprehend he was speaking.
“Maybe not,” she said thoughtfully. “But, how I see it, what truly matters, is how you use that past, and shape it into a better tomorrow-” Draco looked up at that. It sounded like something Harry had said to him- “And might I add, you have a very handsome young man looking out for you.”
Harry didn’t respond, instead he walked over to the door Draco had made appear. Draco followed after him, and they stood side by side staring at the intricate wood-work on the door.
a mountain of crumbs fall onto the polished floor.
“Touched a nerve there, Malfoy?”
Beside him, lying in bed, Harry shifted in his sleep, his body now facing Draco’s. Draco brought his hand out from under the duvet, and was about to brush away the fringe that rested against Harry’s brow bone when Harry’s eyes opened a bit, slowly blinking against the darkness, and Draco supposed, his blindness.
and he once again wished to have Harry by his side to make everything bearable again.
“Are we going to stay friends after this is all over?” Draco spoke rapidly.
“Draco, what? What is it? Am I doing something wrong?” Harry pleaded, needing to know the answer to his question.
“Of course you have favorite Latin quotes.” Harry laughed.
Harry shook his head back and forth in disbelief. “This doesn’t make sense. It should have worked. You’re an excellent potioneer, Draco. I know you brewed it right. It must have been the book's fault.”
He thought he heard Harry shout, “Draco!” as he ran face first into a stone wall. He instinctively held out both hands as he met the wall, dropping the book he so desperately wanted to protect, and fell backwards. His back hit the floor along with his head, and he groaned in pain, clutching his nose that had banged into the stone.
It was a different sort of silence than the one Potter had given him that morning, when he was mad at Draco for wasting their Thursday.
Except, when he got to the place where he

a good person. A good person who was placed in a horrible, terrifying situation.”
Seeing as he really didn’t have any theory of where Harry could have gone, he figured he would start at the bottom of the school and work his way up. He could cast
Draco was slightly leaning against Harry’s chest, but Harry was still holding back for the strangest reason. “You can hold me,” Draco said, and quickly added, “If you want, that is.”
Drys gave an evil smile. “Fine. They’re your people.”
Draco sat in Potions with his head down on the table. He was so tired, he had barely gotten any sleep the night before.
.” Potter pointed at the smoke.
“So I’ve noticed.”
Speaking of the killing curse- Madame Pomfrey, the Aurors, the Minister, and literally anyone who’d visited Draco, wasn’t able to figure out how Draco had survived it. He was officially the second person in history to have been hit with
He turned away from Harry as he said: “Goodnight.” He hoped since he wasn’t facing Harry, he wouldn’t be able to hear Draco speak, but, nonetheless, Harry told him goodnight back, tugging on the covers a little.
The same feeling he’d had when running through the halls, Harry chasing after him, encased him, and he felt pure happiness and youth again. Harry was letting out a couple of, “Woohoos,” and Draco split into laughter as they continued to slide.
to grab onto his left wrist, hadn’t he?
, Potter can we go to class? I can’t get in trouble.”
“But, if you really mean it, I’ll go. I’ll give you some space, and I won’t come back. It’s up to you.” Harry dropped Draco’s hand, and his hand felt so cold; it wasn’t due to the freezing temperature outside. Harry started to rise up from his seated position next to Draco, but he caught Harry’s arm before Harry could get far.
Potter laughed again. This time Draco was sure he hadn’t said anything funny. “Simple. Yeah. Well, we better get going, then. It would be great if we could find some counter spell or potion sooner rather than later.”
“They are,” Harry agreed.
.” Potter got up from his seat, and started browsing the shelves, looking for what Draco hoped was a book that could break whatever enchantment Snape placed on his mysterious book.
“I guess you're right.” Draco said.
He didn’t want them to hear the things that were said related to the Dark Mark. He didn’t want them to see him gripping his arm in pain. The Mark was still and would always be a sensitive subject.
It took a couple of seconds for Harry’s words to register inside his brain, but then he realized Harry was talking about what Draco had said about Kaspian.
“Ugh. Okay, fine. Well, I’m sure you’ve seen
Draco shook his head. To his horror, he felt tears stinging his eyes. Harry’s kindness and humanity was messing up Draco in a way like never before. He hated it. He hated showing so much vulnerability in front of Harry.
articles regarding him and Harry, were still willing to watch him grow as a person.
“So I wanted to thank you, sincerely. I didn’t know you were so insightful.” A small smile played on Harry’s lips.
Who was he kidding? She definitely did. She was Hermione Granger.
A new life was waiting for Draco outside of Hogwarts, holding endless possibilities. Harry was going to be with him through it all. Despite all his doubts and worries, he couldn’t hold back his feelings of excitement for what was to come with his boyfriend by his side.
Once Harry’s shirt was fully off, Draco got the opportunity to kiss every inch of his upper half, and made sure that he’d leave marks. His neck was the prime target, where Draco pressed open mouthed, hot kisses on his adams apple, under Harry’s ears, and above his collar bone. Every once in a while he’d lift his head to look at Harry, and it was clear the other man was in pure euphoria, which made Draco grin at the thought that
The duel Draco thought of to stall Drys from killing Harry, because Drys had Harry’s blood and no use for him anymore.
He’d been blindly following the Figure’s advice. He hadn’t realized until just now, but the Figure had specifically told him not to send out more letters, or else it would end badly for him. Why hadn’t he just went with his gut and done the
, she invited his crush: Harry Potter.
although Draco usually associated that movement when a person wanted to call a dog. Draco thought back to what the Figure had said not that long ago when Draco had asked what he had done to Harry.
Pomfrey didn’t stir one bit. She almost looked frozen, except for her light breathing. He knew something was definitely wrong. He wanted to reach out and shake her awake, but he obviously couldn’t do that. Instead he left her room hurriedly, leaving the door open behind him. He had to get help from someone. She was probably ill and needed medical assistance. He imagined it must be quite hard to get help though when the one person who was trained in tending to people who were sick, was sick herself.
Harry blushed and turned his head slightly away from Draco. “Thank you. For doing that.”
Draco grit his teeth, and felt for his wand under his robes. Luckily, if he had to, he could hex Theo’s balls off now.
life, I want you to be a part of it. Sure, that might make my life a little less normal, and people might talk, but what I’ve said to you before is true: I care about you, and I’ll stick by your side.”
Draco closed his eyes, and wished that when he opened them, they would be gone, that it would all be just a hallucination. When he opened them, however, they were all still there, and looked absolutely out for blood.
“He’s seventeen. He would be going into his seventh year at Durmstrang,” Drys said.
Like Potter had said at Hogsmeade, he needed to do something to actually show he had changed. He knew he couldn’t keep staying silent, he needed to speak up more and join an important cause. Maybe he could somehow join the Muggle Studies class, even if it was mid-January.
His head still resting on the pillow, he turned towards the door where McGonagall and Madame Pomfrey stood speaking to each other in hushed voices. Maybe McGonagall just came in to talk to Pomfrey, and would leave soon…
now. And best of all, he felt he could finally enjoy his new life at Hogwarts, finally embrace the fact that he was given a second chance by the entire school, something he had wanted for so very long.
“It’s alright, Draco,” Harry said, the pads of his fingers still gently touching his cheeks. “I don’t care, you know. I don’t care about the Mark; you’re so much more than it, and it certainly doesn’t define you--I’d know.”
A soft shuffling of feet coming from outside the closet broke Draco out of his thoughts.
his sleeve wouldn’t ride up because there were others in the room. Which was partly true. But, he knew, deep down, that he didn’t need to wear cufflinks, that he’d be perfectly fine without them, especially with the bandage wrap. And if he could resist the Pull of a dark wizard’s powerful magic, he could do this.
Draco realized he had had a conversation with Potter. A real conversation that didn’t have anything to do with the sleeping curse or being rude to one another. They had talked about their friends, and had very lightly broached the untouchable topic of the war, without getting into a huge argument.
In a split second decision, Draco knew exactly what he had to do.
. “Nothing. I’m-” He winced- “Fine.”
He had never gotten a clear look at who the family had been that day, only having been told they were filthy Muggle-borns.
“Alright, just take a seat you two. Malfoy, be more aware of your surroundings next time, yeah?”
“I’m shocked,” Draco deadpanned. Harry didn’t respond, but he did chuckle, and Draco had an inkling he possibly had found Ursa Minor, just by the way he was staring serenely at the sky, the stars winking at him. “You know I used to loathe my name,” Draco said.
did I find a Slytherin tie in the dungeons, and
They continued to stare at each other in silence. He was unhappy that they had gone back not knowing what to say to each other.
“I won’t see you again until the spring holidays,” she said. “That is, unless some unexpected event pops up that involves you.” She looked at him pointedly, but it was obvious she was joking. Sort of.
. You’re crazy if you even thought I’d ever consider it! If you so badly want his blood, then
“What are you thinking now?” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear, sleepily.
Draco let his left hand release from Harry’s hair, the other still touching Harry’s cheek while his thumb brushed over his soft skin, and courageously brought it down to Harry’s groin, his eyes asking for approval from Harry, and Harry nodding eagerly whilst still kissing Draco passionately.
Draco scoffed, but continued to smile at her.
“You’re right. How could I not have thought to look in potions?” Draco was seriously angry with himself. If he had been in the right headspace, they might have already been able to have the cure ready to use.
“It’s just difficult to say goodbye after all these years you know? And now we have to worry about what lays ahead of us…” He wasn’t even sure what he wanted to do with his life. He’d only recently decided he wasn’t going to be living at Malfoy Manor anymore, the house that his mother didn’t sell, and the one where he didn’t want sold, either. But just because he didn’t want to see it lost to his family forever, didn’t mean he was going to live there after everything.
keeping a secret, but that didn’t matter.
Draco, still clutching his arm, peered around the forest, knowing that he was obviously missing something. All he could see was trees without their leaves, and darkness, mixed with rain and fog. Although, things were moving. But he knew that they couldn’t have been the Death Eaters Drys had mentioned,
“Do you- uh want to… doyouwanttosleepnexttome?”
since it seemed the most effective and worthwhile trying to master.
Narcissa opened her door, and handed the driver a generous amount of money, before indicating for Draco to get out of the cab. Draco was instantly confused, but he hesitantly did what his mother wanted.
“Yeah, do that one,” Draco said as his attention moved completely to the sparkly light pink book that had actual
!” To which Draco had instantaneously flushed and told her to shush or people might overhear and get the wrong idea. Draco had been looking at Potter because he was angry at him, and rightfully so. He most certainly wasn’t looking at his arse. What the fuck Pansy?
He wanted to thank Pansy for being an amazing friend. She had stuck with him throughout eighth year when no one else would. She deserved a hug and an ‘I love you.’
Draco’s stomach growled loudly, and he automatically cast a
“This- I- I don’t know what to think of this.” Potter said. Draco nodded his head.
Draco threw himself down next to Harry, who had just gotten over a coughing fit. He instantly put up an umbrella charm around Harry, something he should've done a lot sooner.
Harry was okay, not that Draco cared. A couple of Death Eaters were holding him captive, and when they were done with Hogwarts, Harry would be kept in the Manor’s dungeon.
did nothing wrong.”
The figure knew his name. He knew Draco had sent a letter to his father. He probably knew many other facts about Draco’s life too. He had to treat the figure’s message like it was completely true, or else he or Harry might have to pay the consequences for their ignorance. Well, it was mostly Draco who would have to pay, since he was the one specifically getting the dreams; the one who got a
“Alright. But if something happens to me or you while we’re split up, I’m going to blame it
“Promise.”
“No, I’m fine. Let’s get it over with.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
For better or worse, Draco came to a conclusion.
“Mhm.” Draco closed the book on dragons, and reached for a book on fairies.
Alec made a sound coming from somewhere behind Draco.
“Wait, we don’t even know the password.” Draco added glumly as he was about to try and surpass the gargoyle. Besides the fact that they quite literally couldn’t get into the office without a passcode, he knew he was stalling. He was terrified to see his former headmaster’s portrait hanging in the room.
Harry’s piercing stare was almost too much. It made Draco want to reveal every last one of his secrets right then and there.
Potter finally broke the silence. “Book, please reveal to us some sort of counter-curse that will safely return people who are in a cursed state, back to their normal non-cursed selves.”
He’d been told he was on probation for two years, with a possibility for revaluation for a shorter time period if he abided by his probation requirements.
“This looks promising,” Draco said, showing Harry the page he was looking at. It was a spell that could reveal hidden passageways, and knowing Hogwarts, there was certainly an abundance that they could possibly find.
Draco focused on Harry’s arm, his eyes steady on the entire line of the cut. “
He ran over to Pansy’s dozing body, and started shaking her frantically. She had to wake up. But after a while of poking her shoulder and saying her name over and over again, he knew it was hopeless. She was subject to the same kind of curse that everyone else was under.
and Draco almost wet his pants. Almost.
“Together.” Draco nodded.
Harry bent down to pick a flower, and Draco honestly didn’t feel like stopping him. “Harry, what on Earth are you doing?”
Please leave comments to tell me what you thought of this chapter! It was such a pain, while also fun, to write.
Without Harry, he felt like the way he’d felt before the whole curse had started: terribly empty, alone, and like no one loved him. He felt like there was no reason to fight for another tomorrow, and how was he supposed to look out for Harry, and for Hogwarts, when he couldn’t look out for himself?
“I have to say, I’m quite impressed. I didn’t think you had it in you.” Draco said, impressed.
Harry bit down on his lip. “Sounds about right, yeah.”
Harry was eyeing the piece of parchment like it was the Dark Mark itself. Draco honestly thought it was the next best thing, considering it held vital information on the Mark, information Draco hadn’t shared when he’d gotten the letter. He took out the other letter too, the one he had originally written, and handed both to Harry, telling him to read the less crumpled and ruined one first.
Despite it all, Draco let out a laugh. “Merlin. You just have to be so perfect, don’t you?”
Draco nodded. “Yep.”
Please tell me what you thought of the first chapter, since this is my first time writing a fic I want to know if I'm doing anything horribly wrong haha.
Leave.” It was a halfhearted attempt at an excuse, he knew that Harry knew something bigger was going on. As much as Draco believed Harry was undeniably daft, Harry wasn’t so daft as to not see Draco’s fear and restlessness as he ran into the bathroom, an obvious cue something was wrong.
“So, Draco Malfoy, tell me,” Harry took a bite out of a large piece of treacle tart. “Why did you return to Hogwarts for eighth year?”
“You have to promise something, though,” Draco said, “Promise you won’t try and say ‘I’m sorry’ every single second. And promise you won’t run away,” he added on softly. “Promise once you see me, you-- you won’t regret everything.”
Instantly, a thought filled his head:
“Harry.” Draco shook his head in disbelief. “You really make me feel like I’m not good enough.” Harry clearly couldn’t think of a response to that, so Draco went on, relieving Harry the trouble of (possibly) starting another gooey, sappy speech. “You’re just so sensible. I wish I could be like you even on your worst days. You seem to have an answer for literally every question in the universe there is.”
“The Room of Requirement. We can have our own two beds, and it will provide us with a bathroom, food and everything if we desire it. It’s perfect. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before.”
Harry Potter was lying next to him. Luckily, he was still asleep. But that didn’t stop Draco’s heart from pounding brutally inside his chest. He did not want to believe he had fallen asleep in another bloke's bed, but the proof that he actually
Draco saw a couple of heads nodding along to what Elizabeth was saying. He didn’t know what to think of her words. Sophrosyne sounded fake. It probably was. It was likely Elizabeth had just made up that word. Draco would know, he was good with words. He spent a lot of time reading challenging passages when he was younger, broadening his mind to new and complex words, and he’d never heard of sophrosyne. It was a nice thing to think about, though. Finding inner peace and one’s true self.
“Don’t. Don’t finish that sentence. I’m not in the mood to talk about anything else you feel the need to apologize for. You say sorry
McGonagall’s eyes widened in surprise. He didn’t blame her reaction. He wasn’t well known for agreeing or opening up on any terms.
“Are you up for another dance?” Draco asked Harry, his voice raspy from singing for about thirty minutes straight.
“No we aren’t.”
“I’ll go first,” Potter volunteered. Thank Merlin he offered to go first, since Draco was still having trouble thinking of something to share. “I’m not sure if I should repeat something I already told the book or if I have to say something new, but I’d rather be safe, so I guess I’ll come up with a new secret.”
“You’ll be able to soon, Draco,” Pansy said. “I know you, and I know you’ll come around.”
A group of First Years had found him after all the Sixth Years had left, all bloody and leaning against a wall for support. They had had no idea who he was. They simply had asked if he was okay (he obviously hadn’t been), and had retrieved his wand for him, since it had rolled far out of his reach down the hall. They had watched in awe as he’d healed himself and cleaned up the blood, and as he’d been ready to leave to go back to his dorm, they had wished him a good night. That memory was probably one of his most cherished.
The Garden of Mystics was exactly how they had left it, not that it came as a surprise to either of them.
Draco thought that Drys was sharing extremely personal information, but Drys didn’t seem to mind, keeping up his spell casting and talking at the same time.
“Okay, it wasn’t
After a couple of hushed whispers and staring, Slughorn and every other student went back to worrying about their own potions. That was, except for Kaspian, who strode over to Draco’s table.
Fresh air hit him as he made it out into the alleyway, the smell of alcohol gone and replaced by rotting trash. He slumped down against the walls and raked his hands against his face, breathing in and out slowly. He was so fucked up. He wanted Harry so, so badly, and yet he couldn’t bring himself to even hold a conversation with him.
to make a target’s shoes stick to the ground,
Draco scoffed and closed the book that had been open in front of him. “Where are you going?”
“You know, I feel I deserve all the hate,” Draco said, wanting to pour out all of his feelings to Harry. Wanting Harry to see his vulnerable side. “But at the same time, I want people to love and admire me again. Isn’t that a strange coincidence?”
They walked next to each other, elbows sometimes bumping, towards the stairs. When they got to the top of the set of stairs, Harry opened the book again, pointing to a spell inside of it.
Last time he checked, there had only been three.
Draco described his run to the Forbidden Forest and his worries that the Figure had hurt Harry when he saw Harry’s still figure lying on the ground. The awe as the Figure’s true persona was revealed, as well as Drys’ son as his accomplice. The terror that gripped him as he was forced to make a choice.
. His magic was pulling on me, and then It had been like a string was cut between the two of us. He couldn’t control me no matter what spells he cast, even variations of
“Incredibly soppy, Draco. I’m sure Parkinson would love to have heard you say that. She would bully you for years about it, I bet.”
Potter picked it up, and started flipping it over- front and back- countless times before handing it over to Draco. Draco opened the inside of the book to the back of the cover page, to see if someone had written anything in it, and was delightfully surprised to find someone had.
“Oh! I know!” Potter announced.
“Then when, Draco?” Harry asked. He didn’t sound angry. Just sad.
“You’ve said that at least a million times now, Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes and continued looking at his designated shelf. At this point he thought it was simply just gone. And that they’d wasted their time looking.
McGonagall picked up on what he was looking at and shook her head. “Stop bothering him, you two,” she said to the portraits. “If you can’t
Draco’s heart stopped. He was sure she was talking about the quill he had gone to pick up before he was attacked. He had dropped it somewhere during the mess with Smith, and had absolutely no clue where it might have gone. His eyesight was still a little blurry, and it was slowly getting better, but he still couldn’t move very much.
care for him. But, he knew that he needed an ally right now. Potter was the only option.
want to do after we leave Hogwarts,” Draco insisted.
“Both. Both of them, very, very much,” Draco said.
He was going to use the spell the book had given, Obice Confractus, to charm a single letter, allowing it passage through the ward, messaging his father in Azkaban, asking if Lucius’ Mark had started moving too.
to Potter. Potter was the noble hero whose job was to be kind to everyone, even if that included, well, a person like Draco.
“I won’t leave without telling you again. I promise, Draco,” Potter said with what seemed like absolute clarity.
“Draco,” she said, “you’re here.”
by Sunday, or everyone he cared about would die, and everyone who was asleep would stay asleep forever. He had counted on breaking the sleeping curse so the Figure couldn’t use that as leverage over himself anymore, and Draco would have warned McGonagall about everything, and she’d had made everything alright.
When she noticed that Draco was looking, she gave him a warm smile. “Keep this bandage wrap on for one more day, and then take it off at precisely six in the afternoon. Everything should be back to normal by then,” she said sweetly.
“Why are you crying, Draco?” Harry asked sympathetically.
“Can I talk to you about something kind of personal?” Draco asked carefully half way through their session.
He turned his attention towards one of the couches in the back corner of the common room where a girl was lying. He could make out the short, black hair of his only friend from anywhere. It was Pansy. Something sparked inside of Draco, a sharp fear and heartache for the girl who constantly chose to hang out with him.
Somehow, someway, even though the world was crumbling away, turning to dust, everything felt right. Everything was so right, Draco wanted it to never stop.
He was thrown into multiple visions, playing out different scenarios based on his decisions. The one that obviously seemed the best was the one where Draco accepted the Pull. Accepted to turn to Drys and not have to feel the pain as Harry died, and as the Purebloods in Hogwarts died. At the end of every scenario, though, he would die.
“But since Potter is with me, he can ask it three questions too, right? I can ask three and he can ask three.”
Draco hesitated. “Yeah.”
Pansy’s loud gum smacking noise brought Draco out of his thoughts.
There was no point.
Everything was hazy, but he now remembered what happened at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. He remembered Drys, Alec, and all the Death Eaters. He remembered Harry, and how he had hurt him. Harry had almost died due to
It had been late at night, and Draco had been walking around the corridors by himself, because he just needed to clear his head, and the group of Sixth Years appeared out of nowhere. They had apparently been a part of a group of students Draco had reluctantly tortured during his Seventh Year, and were looking for revenge. He thought he maybe remembered their faces, but Seventh Year was honestly a massive blur for him. He tried to forget as much as possible, but somethings could never be forgotten.
“You’ll be the death of me, Harry Potter,” Draco quipped, but found the statement to be filled with some truth.
Madame Pomfrey stepped into the room, coming out of her office, and made her way over to Draco, who was currently playing Exploding Snaps for the fiftieth time that week, with Pansy and his mum.
“Well, then you should know I also have nightmares,” Draco responded.
This time, instead of getting the entirety of their backs covered in snow, they sat in the snow, getting only their arse and legs wet. It wasn’t exactly pleasant, but Harry for sure made it bearable.
Harry started to take small steps toward Hogwarts’ entrance. Draco panicked and rushed in front of him, blocking his way.
So that was where one started after surviving death.
miserable. He felt like an idiot for having taken so fucking long to figure it out.
It was written in his father’s handwriting, no doubt, and his father had done exactly what Draco had asked him to write. A simple yes or no response regarding whether or not Lucius’ Mark had started moving again.
One: The Dark Mark hadn’t hurt at all ever since he had climbed into Harry’s bed.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed and his face scrunched as he listened to Draco explain what he should have told Harry the day it happened. Harry was most certainly not pitying Draco anymore.
Draco had fallen right into Drys’ trap…
“There’s something else carved into the door,” Draco observed. It was near the design of the waterfall. Having said that, when Draco saw what other words were carved, his stomach dropped.
They made their way towards the dungeons, and Draco wondered what would happen to the stairs they had turned into a slide, along with the wall that now had a chunk of stone carved out of it.

“I felt so awful, though, Harry. It didn’t take a genius to realize you were so
“The Draco constellation?”
It was still so awkward, and the worst part was that Draco knew it was his own fault. Harry looked like he was full to bursting with words, but seemed shy to speak up because of Draco being so obviously not in the talkative mood. It was hard to answer
Lucius was there in the first place because Draco had killed his own dad, and Draco would have been right alongside him were it not for the fact that he (somehow) was able to resist whatever curse Drys had been trying to put him under to control him; make him a part of Drys’ little Death Eater crew.
be dead. He just
He was too afraid to meet Harry’s eyes at the moment, so he picked up the second to last item. It was the necklace with the red gem attached. Draco’s hand instinctively flew to his throat, where he’d just always thought it would be. But now that the necklace was in his palm, the weightlessness he’d just noticed around his throat felt bare and cold.
“If you would hold out your own wand, Mr. Malfoy. I need it to undo the spell,” McGonagall said, leaning forward in her seat to be able to reach Draco’s wand.
“Potter, please. Let’s just- find another way.”
But since it was the two of them running, the moment certainly didn’t feel idiotic or foolish, it felt
he gestured between the two of them-- “mean we’re friends again?”
Like he did most days, Draco splashed water on his face, turning the faucet to the coldest temperature possible, hoping the cold water would distract him from the pain.
The clanging of all the different kitchen ingredients filled the silence, and the demanding little voices of the elves interrupted any thought that started to form in his head; Draco wondered if he would be allowed to ask them to quiet down…
Draco would brew the potion correctly. He was sure of it. And then Harry would never need to find out about the horrible offer and what Draco was supposed to do, since everyone would be awake, and there wouldn’t be a sword hanging over Draco’s head anymore. There wasn’t anyone whose potion skills could even compare to Draco’s. Except Severus Snape, perhaps, but that was a different story.
“Okay.” Harry smiled and gripped his hand tight.
In the distance he heard Harry casting away, making noises of joy whenever he did something correct, and immense groaning when he couldn’t get a spell to work. He snickered to himself, shaking his head at how much fucking
“How? Why? How long has this been going on?” Harry asked, his voice strained.
Draco almost recoiled. He wondered why Harry was allowing Draco to hold him the way that he was, when Harry was still angry at him. He started to move his arms back to his side, when Harry grabbed his wrist, a silent plead not to be left alone. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry even tighter.
“That’s understandable.” Harry said. “But didn’t you worry about, you know, people at Hogwarts-”
Harry started. “What?”
“It’s perfect,” Draco responded.
“No one’s awake, except you and Potter, I gather.”
Nothing happened.
Potter turned to face Draco, and made his way towards him.
She tilted her head a bit. “I see.”
He pushed away the covers of his bed, and immediately went to the bathroom, where he splashed cold water all over his face, trying to remember and forget everything he had been told.
“I have to fix this on my own,” Draco blurted out. This time, he
“Good work today, you know, with brewing the potion.”
“Hey,” Harry spoke softly. “Don’t cry. It’s alright.”
book with mild interest.
Draco couldn’t blame him, the Garden of Mystics was the most stunning place he had ever seen. That said a lot, since he liked to believe his own garden back at the Manor was lovely, but the Garden of Mystics undoubtedly out-shined any other location by far.
Once he started crying, he found he couldn’t stop. So, he stopped trying to prevent the tears, and he let everything become blurry and disoriented, he let his carefully shelved thoughts run free.
“When you’re well rested enough, Mr. Malfoy, we would like for you to consider our request.”
“You had no right to enter the Garden,” Drys snapped. It was weird to think about The Figure as
“May I sit next to you?” Harry asked.
“Please don’t let me fall,” he’d said one night.
Draco hoped beyond hope that what Potter said was true.
section of the library, and already knew it would be another dead end. But he had to do something. He couldn’t just sit around and wait for someone to save them. As Potter had said last night, they were on their own. Well, they were on their own together.
Draco grimaced and turned his direction towards Pansy. When he reached her, she sent a vicious glare to all the eyes turnt their way. That scared the Slytherins away, thank Merlin.
Harry would die. That was for sure. But Draco could either watch Harry die while being immune to pain, because he had accepted the pull of the Mark and was completely under Drys’ thrall, or he would be
He realized, that Harry was lying on the ground, and blood was spurting out of his arm. Harry was lying on the ground, with his eyes closed, and his breaths coming up slower and slower each time.
“Do what?”
“Is something wrong?”
- apparently heard what they were talking about, and his head snapped their way.
He wanted to see his father one last time before he left the world. He wanted to tell Lucius how much he loved him, despite everything.
“Let’s just… get the map sometime from your dorm. It could come in handy,” Draco opted to say.
Drys stepped forward, and Alec stepped back. “I’ll explain everything, young Malfoy,” Drys said, “however, before I do, you have to tell me, did you contemplate my offer? You had a week to think about it, which is a good amount of time.”
Nope. Professor McGonagall was walking over to Draco’s bed in the middle of the room, while Pomfrey went into her office.
“I trust you. Or, I’m beginning to learn to trust you. I would like to believe you wouldn’t lie to me, especially when we’re the only two people around,” Potter said.
“Didn’t you say Alec’s family was fine? When we were walking back from Hogsmeade you said…”
A group of black clad people came through the front door, holding on tightly to Olive and Alec. Olive had tears streaming down her face, while Alec wore a horrified expression, his eyes pleading for help. A Death Eater handed their leader Olive and Alec’s wands.
“And how has your health been?”
“Sadly, no. I wasn’t able to break out the Death Eater’s currently rotting in Azkaban
Harry went on, “I realize you don’t have to tell me every aspect of your life. I would be completely hypocritical, since I obviously don’t tell you every aspect of mine, but I do want you to know you can talk to me. I’ll be here for you.”
“Granger, no, please wait,” He cut her off. His voice sounded hoarse, and it took a lot of energy out of him to speak. “I- I can’t- I don’t want-” He looked down at his arm that was still clutched against his chest, Granger followed his line of sight. “I’ll be fine. I already feel a lot better. I’ll just go back to my dorm and ask Pansy to heal the rest of my injuries.”
He’d just come from the library, completing more research. He was entirely drained. That meant he hadn’t been noticing where he was heading; his mind telling him it was time to go down to Slytherin and catch up with Pansy and Blaise before he slept long and hard and didn’t wake up the next day until after noon, because it was luckily a Saturday. His feet, however, had been taking him in a complete opposite direction.
Draco groaned and, somehow, shifted even closer into Harry’s side so that there really was no space between their bodies, hesitantly resting his head against Harry’s neck.
He took a quick glance around, wondering where the current of air was coming from, but found no windows. The place was also immensely bright, filled with sunlight, which didn’t make any sense, since how could light get through when the room was all brick, mossy walls; no skylights or windows or anything that could provide light. It was also late at night, which made it obvious someone would have had to cast a spell that created sunlight.
Which translated to “Fun Spells to Cast.”
Of course the one day where he got himself trapped is the day of an important exam.
She was still stroking his hair as he fell asleep.
It made sense, but it also didn’t. He now knew why his Mark had pulsed and ached and burned for two weeks; because it was calling out to its new master, wanting Draco to accept the pull and give in. His Mark definitely was much worse outside surrounded by Death Eaters and Drys, but he still wasn’t giving in, like giving in was the harder option, not easier. How could that be?
Draco stood up, pocketing his wand and taking one last look at the Garden. “Yep. Now c’mon, we don’t want to miss the time stamp.”
Potter apparently had a nightmare that very night though, while Draco had slept soundly. He hadn’t woken Draco up, and Potter never exactly told him he’d had one, but Draco assumed as much due to Potter’s shaky and closed off composure as he got ready for the day.
“Harry! I need you, please!
SMALL SPOILER: Draco and Harry go to Hogsmeade next chapter
It also amazed Draco that Drys had found a way to break the three question rule; something Snape had meticulously created to stop power hungry wizards from holding a key to all known information, and using it to fulfill whatever plan they had in mind.
savior, hurt more than he would have liked to admit.
“Uh, no? I barely ever pay attention in group therapy, it’s boring and irrelevant to me. Honestly one of the perks of this curse is that I didn’t have to go to therapy for two weeks. Amazing.”
“I’ll worry about that when the time comes!”
Snape was right, he only needed a counter-curse for two things. He wouldn’t need more than three, but he was still a bit irritated at the limitations. “You’re right. I’m sorry,” He said. “Thank you for your answers.”
Making Draco aware of what he was doing at the moment, Drys sent another spell his way, breaking Draco’s ward. He hastily put it up again, but he knew it wouldn’t last for too long. He already felt his magic and energy depleting bit by bit.
“This brings us onto our next topic of discussion. Survivor’s guilt.” There was a collective intake of breaths from the circle of chairs. “You all survived. You are all here. Everyone thinks they could’ve done things differently if given the chance, but no one can change the past. Not even in a world full of magic.”
However, Draco was brought back to real life when his robes were completely off, only leaving his long sleeved shirt as the barrier against his naked skin. Harry didn’t seem to sense Draco’s change in mood, and was in the process of flipping them over so that Harry was lying on top of Draco, when he finally looked down into Draco’s eyes and stopped.
Pansy must have thought. Draco thought it too, for a good while.
“Now wasn’t that quite the show,” drawled a voice. “I had hoped you would have done the job yourself, Draco. Would have saved me a hell of a lot of energy and magic, but oh well.”
,” Draco said impatiently.
“Did you see the look on his face!”
“Malfoy-”
Potter made a pointed gesture to Draco’s wand, which was still clutched tightly in his right hand.
personal stuff here, too.”
It wasn’t a proper duel. They didn’t start the proper way and do the proper set up, but Draco presumed that was because he couldn’t
” Draco said, and he knew he was pouting. However, he couldn’t bring himself to care. He enjoyed these little jabs he and Harry threw at each other. It brought back that little tugging of his heart and pit in his stomach feeling that he loathed but loved simultaneously.
And then there was Harry.
outed Draco and Harry, the amount of backlash they’d been receiving was excessive. Some people began to doubt all that was said about Draco being a hero. That led to Draco being skeptical about what life would be like for himself outside of Hogwarts. Would he find a job? Would he find a job that accepted all parts of him? He couldn’t tell.
Harry shrugged. “I feel like spending six years in Gryffindor made me more… well, Gryffindor. But at heart I’m a Slytherin.”
He now laid in bed, and found himself staring at Potter’s shoulders rising and falling, not for the first time.
“No. No, it should have
“Hmm, and he didn’t say anything to you?”
Things were messy, between him and Harry--not always perfect. They still had some aspects to mend and some subjects to talk through. They still had plenty of trauma to heal and sleepless nights that left them dead on their feet. They were still early on in their relationship.
Draco didn’t have to move his head to know that Harry was back to staring at the ceiling.
Draco reached the blank stretch of wall in the dungeons and rested against it for a second, relieving his aching chest of more walking.
“It’s me, Potter,” Draco responded. He crossed his arms over his chest, glaring at Potter. He was still mad at him, and he had specifically told Potter
It would require a
There was only one way to find out what would happen.
Harry then noticed Draco’s left forearm, covered in a magi-bandage wrap, and looked at Draco with terror.
“You always had a good relationship with him. I think he’ll tell you more if it’s just you in the room with him.”
? You said, ‘Give me the knotgrass.’ You didn’t ask very nicely.”
“You did not just ask that question. ‘How are they.’ Seriously? You cannot be the same Malfoy that I have known for the past eight years.”
“You made me realize a lot of things during the Curse,” Harry said.
Potter made an inaudible noise, and Draco somehow knew the git was smiling, just like he was.
It was worrisome that once everything was back to normal at Hogwarts, Draco’s feelings
This time around, this kiss was anything but delicate. It was filled with so much want; all that frustration of being apart from each other for so long put into the kiss.
“Wow. They’re beautiful.” Potter remarked as he bent down to pluck one.
The weather outside was odd. The sky showed no signs of clouds, and the starry night sky was more than visible, the stars glowing serenely. Yet, there was snow falling, however barely hitting the ground, the wind carrying the flakes through the air.
Harry stopped moving for a second, and then recomposed himself and stood up, holding out a hand for Draco to take.
He currently didn’t know where he was, or how he could form coherent thoughts, but he knew he heard voices, and sometimes he could see certain faces in the darkness.
“Together?” Draco repeated.
They walked side by side, passing multiple students and professors who gave them weird looks. Draco wanted to look down at his shoes, to hide from everyone’s gazes, but he didn’t dare to act on that urge in the presence of Harry.
Harry took a deep breath. “I have this map. It shows all of Hogwarts, along with all its occupants and where they are every second of the day.”
Draco could hear voices, coming from somewhere. He couldn’t open his eyes, and even if he could, he wouldn’t want to. He wished he would be overtaken by darkness again, he felt oddly comforted by the feeling of nothingness.
“What?”
Draco begged. He was willing to drop on his knees and grovel at Harry’s feet if it would cure their relationship.
But, every moment had to stop at some point. That was a part of life. No one could live in one moment forever, sadly. It was comforting to know, though, that if he were ever given the opportunity to live in one memory forever, it would undoubtedly be the one Draco was still experiencing.
Harry was his present, and his future, and he wouldn’t dare change that for the world.
“Good evening.”
Harry?”
It was only until the owl gave a loud
The next day, a slow and boring Tuesday, Draco had Potions with Harry. Which was fine; Draco got to work with Blaise and therefore got to block out Harry, focusing solely on his studies and ensuring the best possible score on his Potions NEWT.
“Theodore Nott.”
Now that Harry was right in front of him, eyes gleaming and face blushed, Draco was speechless. Honestly, there was just too much to say, and Draco couldn’t possibly know where to start.
He felt like he had just run a race. He felt tired, sweaty, and he was breathing ridiculously hard, all at the same time.
bloody annoying. I can’t stand him.” Potter looked seriously ticked off at the moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
. A book that Draco really had no reason to hide, other than to piss Harry off. He then remembered it was because of the stupid cloud of smoke Harry had created.
was the thing doing the ‘Pulling’. And, Merlin forbid, she have him roll up his sleeve and show her the damn thing, self inflicted scars and all.
Potter was so fucking insistent with everything. Why out of all people in Hogwarts did Draco have to be stuck with the most annoying, insistent ponce? But Draco knew he had to say something, or at least something a lot more than “Nothing” and “I’m fine.” He settled with telling Potter something a bit personal, even though it was a lie, but he knew Potter would believe it and it would get him off his back. “Okay, the truth is, being in the Room of Requirement is a bit… much. I’m sort of having, I don’t know, flashbacks? To all the times I’ve been in here,” Draco said.
Draco didn’t respond, and Harry didn’t say anything else. The silence was comfortable, although he longed for the warmth of Harry at his side.
The next time he woke up, the sun was setting and there were a crowd of people in the room.
He turned around to ensure that his trunk was locked, and caught a glimpse of his bedside table, where he kept his cufflinks.
“Well you aren’t an expert at potions, so,” Draco mused.
“I like to think of us as two sides of the same coin.”
He spent the week in the hospital.
Drys twirled his wand in his hand. “I’ve told you. I’m an expert at creating and experimenting with spells. Snape’s book was a great help, too.”
They were still ignoring the Hippogriff in the room: tomorrow the potion would be ready. Draco supposed he could lightly bring up the subject while they were both in a good mood, but that right there was the problem. They were both in a good mood. Draco didn’t want to ruin that. Harry had thoughtfully planned out this night in the Garden, and he supposed if Harry was ready to bring up the Restorative Potion, they would talk about it then.
“So, how did you find out about these spells that work on a radio?” Draco asked, stopping himself from thinking about their almost kiss.
“I don’t really know what to think anymore. I mean, I trust your word, if in your ‘visions’ there really was some guy telling you something awful would happen Sunday, then yeah, maybe tomorrow is going to be… not so great,” Harry spoke so seriously, it made Draco snort. “But, the future isn’t certain, there could be a million possibilities for tomorrow.”
“Of course I am.” His voice was filled with understanding.
at him. Actually fucking smiled. Draco didn’t smile back. Yes, he was trying to be nicer to Potter, but that did not include smiling at the git. It never would include smiling at the git.
He then saw his father, who was sitting in a cell in Azkaban. Lucius was so far from the man he once was, but as Draco and Narcissa stood before him, Draco knew that Lucius was satisfied. Draco told his father how much he loved him.
The next second was a blur. Harry was crashing into him, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and pulling him in tight for a hug. His face was buried into Draco’s neck, and it sounded like Harry was mumbling words.
Secrets & trust.
Once the vial was completely emptied, Draco took another look at Harry, who pulled him into a bone crushing hug. Draco melted into the warm embrace, and took a deep breath, letting all his worries flood out of him as Harry wrapped his arms tighter around his waist. After what felt like an hour, which in reality was only really thirty seconds, they both let go of each other and stood to watch Theo’s body.
He felt so light, running through the empty halls of Hogwarts, being chased by Harry Potter. He heard Harry’s laugh, and then he started laughing too, just because of the sheer ridiculousness of the situation.
“I trusted you, Alec! I thought we were friends!” Harry half-shouted. “Seems like I put my trust in two people who didn’t deserve it.”
Draco had not been expecting that. Holy Shit. Just because he had-- what? Killed a man? Gotten rid of all the Death Eaters? He could now be a more normal wizard? It was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous, but Draco was ever so grateful. He felt like he could hug McGonagall and whatever Ministry workers had made this possible. He felt less like a war criminal than he had a minute ago.
His first instinct was to run off with a little
As if right on cue, his arm gave a painful jolt, and he instantly gasped aloud.
He opened the window and prayed to Merlin that what he was about to do would work.
Harry had been avoiding eye contact for a while, and so had Draco, but now their eyes met. Harry’s gaze was unwavering and truthfully very frightening. Draco could now clearly see the man who had defeated You-Know-Who.
They were pretty sure the
“Harry, is that really you?” Draco asked, hope flooding throughout his body.
One of the members of Smith’s group had done this. He was positive. Who else would have known Draco was in this exact room at this exact time? Unless Smith or the others had told someone outside of their little group from that night. But it didn’t really matter who had done it.
Harry was as intent as ever as he listened to Draco.
There were students who had parents who worked in the Ministry, of course. And everyone knew that Ministry workers, especially Aurors, couldn’t keep their bloody mouths shut. All it took was for one Auror who had looked into Draco’s Pensieve to tell one other person, and the chain reaction began.
Was Draco so daft not to realize, he had done the same thing too? Was he so daft not to realize that when Harry was with him, when Harry was by his side, the emptiness inside of him was filled?
They hadn’t been prepared for the snow, only heading out in their winter coats; no Gryffindor or Slytherin styled accessories.
Ever since coming to the Earth-shattering revelation that Draco was in love, the revelation that had hit him about an hour ago, everything was upside down, and Draco didn’t know whether anything could ever be right side up again. The real question was, did he want everything to go back to normal now? Now that he’d found
“Well, that’s partially true,” the Figure said. He snapped his fingers in the direction of the castle with a bored look in his eyes.
“But,
“It’s really you! You’re awake!” Pansy exclaimed, her eyes growing wider.
Moving his hand to pinch the bridge of his nose in exasperation, Draco breathed out, “I can assure you, Harry,
“It wasn’t that big of a deal,” Draco lied, half embarrassed.
Draco snorted. “Only because you can’t actually cast them properly. Otherwise I think they’d be quite
“So, what should we do when we’re back inside?” Potter asked as they turned themselves around and started making their way back to Hogwarts.
Harry had nothing else to say, and instead headed over to a small elf who was ordering others around.
“Yeah,” Draco said. He didn’t have much else to say, and he felt silly with his short response. What he
The pages were blank.
Draco walked back to the Slytherin common room with Pansy by his side, who was chattering on and on about different kinds of spell work. He pretended he was paying attention, and nodded his head enthusiastically when she turned to look at him when she stopped talking to take a breath.
“Er- yeah, yeah,” Harry said, picking up his bag.
It made him put things in perspective, honestly. What Harry thought of his Muggle attire did not matter in the grand scheme of things. And besides, what he was wearing now was much more comfortable than his heavy robes. The Room had even provided him with a jumper that was tight around the cuffs; he didn’t need to wear cuff-links or magic his sleeves at all, which he was grateful about.
Olive. Hide. Run. Go.”
The front entrance doors to Hogwarts loomed upon him, and he pushed open the door. One last time he glanced around behind him, and waited a couple minutes for a git with messy black hair and big green eyes to show up, with no luck.
“I’m not exactly sure what heroes do. But I know what I want to do. And I’m not changing my decision.”
She straightened out, finally pulling away from Draco, but leaving her hand on his shoulder. “I know darling, I am truly amazing, no need to remind me. Actually, I love being reminded, keep the praises coming.”
The rest of the walk to Hogsmeade was uneventful and full of horrifically awkward silence. A couple times Potter made a noise that indicated he was trying to start a conversation, but he never actually spoke words. Draco wanted to pull his hair out, the tension between them was so uncomfortable. It was like they didn’t actually
Harry opened and closed his mouth several times. “I’m sorry- about-”
Draco ignored her. “It’s about something that happened to me during the Sleeping Curse. Something, or a couple things for that matter, I’ve been trying to work out for a while.”
Kaspian seemed to be paired up with a girl who was in Ravenclaw. Draco was surprised he didn’t wait up for Potter to show so he could be partners with him.
Harry widened his eyes. “Wanna bet?”
Harry had said to him, when really it was the opposite. Draco couldn’t live in a world without Harry Potter.
filled to the brim with restlessness and confusion.
Draco panicked, trying to remember all of the healing spells he knew.
He wished Pansy had for once done as he’d requested, and let him have a simple birthday.
The rest of the session his classmates took turns sharing why they felt guilty, and they all undertook the job of telling each other why it was okay to feel that way. Elizabeth looked content sitting in her chair, watching everyone say kind words to each other. Almost everyone, that was. Draco did not participate, and neither did Potter. They both kept their mouths shut the entire time. Even Pansy said something, when Theo talked about his mother, she offered comforting words to him.
Harry had always been going on about all the different spells Alec had taught him, like the one with the radio and the one with the photographs. He used to feel jealous of Alec, having spent so much time with Harry, but now he felt anger towards him, knowing that all along Alec had been working on some evil plan with his father.
Of course, he’d been wrong.
“I feel like I haven’t done shit the past two weeks. You’re the one who brewed the Restorative Potion, which is ultimately going to save everyone. I haven’t done anything to thank you for brewing the potion while I sat on my arse staring at you.” Harry blushed. He hadn’t wanted to share the last part, that was for sure.
” Draco yelled while shaking. It was a bit rich telling someone else they’d lied when
What Draco didn’t tell Harry, and what he would never tell anyone, is that while he’d fallen in love with Harry, he’d fallen in love with himself, too. He realized that self-loathing wasn’t so prominent anymore inside him, and that even though there was still a lot of work to be done, he accepted himself; his body, his past, and his present. For when he’d looked into the slightly shattered mirror, on the verge of death that day with Drys, he’d finally been able to open his eyes wide enough to see the truth: he forgave himself.
She punched his arm, and Draco let out a sharp gasp. “Hey!” he said, “I was just hospitalized! Go easy on me!”
His mother went next, and she had been sentenced to a year and a half of house arrest and five months of community service when she was allowed to step foot outside the manor’s grounds. Potter had shown up then, and had given testimony on his mother’s behalf. He had told the Wizengamot that Narcissa had lied directly to the Dark Lord. Apparently, when she was asked if Potter had been alive after the Dark Lord tried to kill him, his mother had said Potter was in fact dead, when he
The only way Draco could explain to Harry why he hadn’t written a letter for help, was to tell him about the Figure’s offer. So that’s what he did.
So here they were today.
“Alec’s family was close friends with Remus Lupin. I’m sure you remember him.”
Draco looked over to Drys, still standing next to Alec with a look of displeasure.
“They’ve been alright, I guess.”
As he was about to slip into his Slytherin green covers, he thought he heard Harry whisper his name. However, he was tired, and most certainly imagining it. Harry was mad at him and wouldn’t be calling him
He could feel his hands starting to shake, and he was starting to breathe much faster than usual.
“There is a catch however,” Snape drawled. Draco groaned, because of course there was. “The book only provides you with information that is already out in the world. It cannot create a counter-spell or new kind of charm, it can only find you what already exists.”
“I know.” Draco smiled, and then turned his head to look at Harry. “Have I ever told you thank you?”
His arm was sending bolts of pain throughout his body, and it took a large amount of energy out of him to not cut off the dreadful tattoo, and if that wouldn’t work, yank off his entire arm.
“You go ahead and have fun with your new friends. I’m not going. That’s that. Besides, I’d have to ask McGonagall if I could leave the grounds of Hogwarts.”
“It’s a very nice necklace,” Draco responded. “Very, uh... shiny.” He tucked it away.
“So you’re not mad at me?”
think that? Draco basically thought the same thing; that someone was trying to get back at
“We became incredibly close, and we would always be on the lookout for new books and spells and our minds would be racing, trying to figure out how to build off of what was already there.
“I just-” Harry was back to standing at Draco’s side, except this time, their eyes were locked and Harry was closer than ever. Was this the moment where they would kiss? Draco wasn’t prepared for a kiss. Not yet at least. He wished Harry would have given him some warning or… “I thought this would look pretty in your hair.”
“And thank you for agreeing to confess a secret. That must’ve been hard. But we got the cure now, and it will all pay off in the end,” Potter whispered into the darkness.
Potter contemplated what he was going to say, and eventually came up with the world’s most boring answer. “I had a very good breakfast today with lots of treacle tart. My bad thing is I ate too much of it.” That earned him lots of snickers. Not the accusing kind, the kind that Draco would’ve got if he’d voiced that answer, but the friendly, kind-hearted laughs.
“Why aren’t you sleeping?” Harry asked, and finished with a large yawn.
“So, you think that maybe the sleeping spell wasn’t an accident after all? That this is all connected somehow?” Draco asked.
Drys narrowed his eyes. “You know, I actually did believe you’d do as I asked. You are a Death Eater, after all. I’m honestly quite surprised you’re blatantly refusing.”
“I thought
. He deserved to have some fun at that age.
“You don’t see it? Look harder. It’s all around us I promise.”
“No,” Draco breathed. He wished it were him lying in the rain, possibly dying from the cold, the rain beating down, and enduring whatever the Figure had done to him. He deserved it more than Harry. Harry had done nothing wrong.
But Harry surprised him, not for the first time. “How could I forget? You told me about this type of flower the first day of all this. The day I woke up and no one else was awake, no one else responsive or moving.” Harry was now standing next to Draco, their bodies touching. “That was, everyone but you.”
“You really believe that, huh. Normal,” she deadpanned. “If you take one glance around, you’ll realize how far from
Harry glanced down at himself. “I don’t think I can run. I think something happened to my leg. And I’m sure I’ll just break into a coughing fit if I overestimate my running or even walking abilities. Also, Alec is probably going to be watching me like a hawk while you and Drys are occupied.”
The rest of the session was pretty dull. They hadn’t made much progress, which Draco pointed out, to which Elizabeth had pointed out ‘you made progress by showing up, Draco, and talking to me, even if it was just a little bit.’
“Yeah that sounds good,” Draco agreed as he continued to look down at the bubbling potion. “I’ve heard of plenty of counter-curses to barrier spells, however I don’t know them by name, but I know they exist, so we should be set. Maybe we can even get the counter-curse today and be able to get help from the Ministry by nightfall.” Draco knew he sounded sickeningly optimistic, but it was not that hard to believe. Spells to break wards did exist, and since the book provided them with what he hoped was the correct kind of Restorative Potion, he hoped it would do the same for an anti-barrier spell, or potion.
The leader gestured at Drys. “Take him to the dungeons.” He then gestured at Alec. “Kill the boy.”
and all the articles about me becoming an Auror.”
Hearing Pansy talk, Madame Pomfrey spun around and started to complete his vital check. His mother joined Pansy, looking down at him with worry, but also pride. Somehow she made it work.
“I wanted to save myself too, you know. I didn’t want to die,” he added in hastily.
All in all, Draco preferred the second scenario to the first. He liked the idea of not feeling anything as he spent his last day in the world.
keeping enemies away,
another presence, there was no one. Nothing in sight except for the stone walls and the dusty floors and-
And Draco? None of what he was, or was doing, or
No. Fucking. Way.
. Who used to be just Potter to him.
Harry’s mouth fell open at the realization. “Fuck! I knew I was forgetting something.” He ran a hand through his hair, and Draco had the urge to pat it down, even though he had to admit, when Harry’s hair was extra messy, Harry was extra attractive. If that was even possible. “I’ll go run down to Potions again and-”
He was about to act on his intention when Harry stirred slightly, and Draco was afraid he’d wake up. But Harry kept on sleeping, and Draco could see that his nightmare had passed, by his movements turning from shaky to subdued.
“You know what I think, though?”
This was confirmed when Wynn looked directly into Draco’s eyes, and murmured something under his breath before speaking.
“What what?”
Potter slowly blinked at him and openly gaped. It was like Potter was seeing Draco for the first time in a long while.
He also knew Lucius had disobeyed his own rule. Draco had been witness innumerable times to Lucius bowing his head to the Dark Lord, not meeting his master’s eyes; to Lucius very obviously not being in control of the situation that was set in front of him.
. He had never even thought of that. Sure, he didn’t use slurs or insult people of Muggle heritage anymore, but that didn’t show people he didn’t believe in the Pureblood supremacy crap anymore. He could have very much still agreed with everything the Dark Lord stood for, since he never voiced anything otherwise to the public. The thought made him sick.
The last time they had used the exact corridor Draco was standing in was Saturday morning. Yesterday. Saturday morning, the hall had been filled with light seeping through one of the only windows in the walls, the sun filling the water of the Great lake, making the hall visible enough.
“I love you too,” he said softly, a single tear sliding down his cheek. “I love you so much, Draco Malfoy.” He cupped Draco’s cheek. “Don’t you ever leave me again, for what we found is something made of pure magic, and I won’t let that bond sever.”
“Sir, is it okay if I joined Ron and Hermione?” Potter asked as he walked farther into the room.
“Potter. What the fuck? Isn’t it obvious I don’t want to talk about this. Shut
thing instead? Not following orders from another dark wizard again. He still had time to send a distress letter, he guessed, but he wasn’t sure when it would arrive at the Ministry, and he didn’t have Snape’s book with him. Harry had it.
He more or less knew he shouldn’t have bolted away from Harry. They were supposed to stick together, never be apart, and he’d carelessly broken that rule. But a part of him was sure Harry would chase after him, and he’d been right. He was glad he’d been right because the prospect of running through empty corridors was sort of frightening. Also, the walk back to the library would have surely been a walk of shame, knowing he’d been a complete idiot running through Hogwarts alone.
a book that could tell if you were really telling your deepest secret? He and Potter would most likely find a spell that could just open the damn book and tell them what counter-curse is needed to break the sleeping spell without having to expose a secret at all. And on top of that, they could break the barrier spell too.
Attached to the parchment Azkaban had surely provided, there was another letter there; Draco’s letter, the one he had originally written and sent his father. He quickly stuffed the letter he had written into his pocket, and quickly unfolded the response he had received. All that was written in sloppy cursive was one word:
But it was. The pain worsened every second and he had to strongly suppress himself from ripping his arm off right in front of Potter. His mind kept circling around the thought that the Dark Lord was back and enraged beyond belief.
“Maybe that was too much Calder-” A girl's voice.
“Uh-”
Draco blanched. “You wanted to do something nice? For me?”
“What are you apologizing for this time, Potter?” Draco sighed as he went to grab something to eat from the tray laid out on the couch. He weirdly had an appetite now; after all of his school days of finding the idea of eating sickening, all it took for him to eat was apparently being trapped in a castle with no one else other than Harry Potter. Ugh.
Draco didn’t have a response ready. Harry frowned, apparently slightly regretting his words.
“Draco,” someone whispered. He knew it to be Pansy right away.
“C’mon, we should try out some more spells.” Draco tapped the book, still in Harry’s hand.
Draco finally turned his head to look at Alec, who was standing over Harry. Harry looked like he wanted to go to sleep, but at the same time he also wanted to listen to what Drys had to say.
In all honesty, Draco just didn’t feel like dancing. He supposed he could tell Harry his reason, even though Harry probably wouldn’t believe him. But Harry had said he wouldn’t intrude and try to force answers out of Draco anymore, as long as Draco wasn’t holding back any crucial information regarding the curse. (Which he was.)
He rushed inside, slamming the door against the wall, and froze. Madame Pomfrey was lying down in her bed, not moving at all except for the small rise and fall of her chest. So she overslept. Draco felt like an idiot. He had barged into a ladies room, which was completely inappropriate. Nothing was wrong with Pomfrey, besides the fact that she was clearly extremely tired. He glanced at the muggle clock placed on her nightstand, and it read twelve o’clock.
Draco studied Potter. He was chewing on his bottom lip, and his black hair was falling into his eyes. He acted like it didn’t annoy him, and just let the strands hang there. Draco subconsciously pushed his own hair out of the way, even though it wasn’t even close to covering his eyes like Potter’s hair was.
Draco wanted to apologize and do whatever he could to make things right for Drys. But what would apologizing do? It certainly wouldn’t change the past. It wouldn’t have changed what he had participated in and what he had firmly believed in.
New discoveries.
“Draco, you look dead,” Pansy stated firmly across from him.
“We can finish this chat at another time. We need to start brewing the cure. Like now,” Draco said hastily as he gathered up his belongings, getting ready to make the trip to the potions classroom.
“I’m a terrible person.”
Draco groaned. The thought of Harry, barely able to walk, let alone carry another person’s weight, hike up to Hogwarts in the middle of a harsh rain storm was absolutely dreadful. Especially after witnessing Drys’ death, and what Harry surely thought was Draco’s death.
Alec was reluctant to answer, but he nodded his head anyway.
When he reached the smokey area, he waved away as much of the fumes as he could, and stared down at the floor. He heard a faint gasp coming from beside him, which could only be Potter, and he knew exactly what he was gasping at.
He walked in deeper, and came across a slightly broken body length mirror. There was one piece that was missing in the top right corner. He stuck out his hand to touch the area that was missing, when he
He realized just then that Snape was
“Please don’t get mad. Or do get mad. You most certainly have the right too. But, okay, while you were sleeping…” Harry paused, not meeting Draco’s eyes. “God, you’re going to hate me so much.” Harry put his head in his hands.
. Just- uh.”
He also guessed Potter wouldn’t have wanted to join his search reading book after book in the library. He didn’t seem like the studious type. Draco wanted to be
"YOU ARE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO SUFFER!" Drys shouted, shaking with rage. "You and your father are the ones who've ruined my life. Having Alec complete the job would mean I wouldn't get the chance to see you in complete and utter agony. Even if you weren't aware of it yourself."
She brought him some toast and butter, along with an apple. Draco mentally thanked her for not trying to force him to eat a large meal. He slowly took bites of his food, resisting the urge to gag. This year it had been even harder than previous years for him to eat, and he didn’t exactly know the reason why. The Dark Lord was gone. He should be scarfing down food, something he hadn’t done since Fifth year.
He wondered, not for the first time, if this had all been strategically planned by the cloaked man. The answer to that question: probably.
He closed his eyes, envisioning whatever would come to mind first.
“It’s just, I know we’re not exactly friends. But if there’s something else Snape said, or you had another one of your visions, or you found- I don’t know, a secret room somewhere that could possibly help us out, you’d tell me, right?” Potter looked directly at him. His eyes huge behind his glasses and his eyebrows furrowed.
So much for earning Potter’s trust.
“Okay,” Draco said.
Draco, uncorked vial of Bloodroot Potion in his hand, threw the contents of the vial onto Drys.
“But on top of that, what friend of Potter’s would want to hurt him? What friend of Potter’s wouldn’t stop trying to find an escape, and contact the Ministry once I had entered their head? I needed someone close to Potter like you, Draco. Someone who would think of their own gain first, and someone who was close to Potter in a way that wasn’t friendship. You were the perfect candidate. And, if you weren’t close enough to him, you would surely be after two weeks.”
Harry set down his sandwich. “It was really no problem. I just noticed how stressed you were, and-” He shrugged, picking up his sandwich again.
5) His father. (Though that one was quite complicated).
Before he left the room, Draco made sure to discreetly catch Blaise’s attention and give him a small smile and nod, to which Blaise gave a wry grin in return.
Harry’s hand was gripping Draco’s hair tightly while his lips kept pulling and sucking on Draco’s bottom lip.
Draco desperately needed to talk to Harry. Harry made situations better. Harry helped him forget. Harry kept him calm and brought light into his life.
Draco found it hard to imagine how exactly his life got like this. Having someone to really hold on to after such a huge ordeal. After basically conquering death.
Draco’s face fell. “We’re not really on speaking terms right now.”
“No you ponce! I just mean that I shouted multiple times to get her attention and she didn’t move one bit. I thought she was sick. I was just on my way to get McGonagall when I noticed there was literally no one else around. Well, I guess except for you.”
“No!” Draco said a little more harshly than intended. He supposed he was just agitated. He really wanted to test the potion out as soon as possible so the Figure wouldn't have leverage over him any longer. “Sorry. I just mean- we’ll return it later. It’s not important. We should test out the Restorative Potion.”
“I’m glad I don’t. Although, my younger self would beg to differ.”
Harry smiled weakly. “I know you will.”
Harry placed his hands behind the back of his head, creating a makeshift pillow against the hard stone of the fountain. “Merlin, I cannot explain to you how much I hate the fucking
One of the main reasons he wanted to go to the Great Hall was to see Harry. He was extremely nervous to set eyes on him, but he had to talk to him. About the two weeks, about all the things he’d done wrong, about the fight with Drys,
Of course, it had to be Potter. Draco recognized that voice anywhere.
The gem that usually pressed against his chest wasn’t there, and he hoped someone had taken it to a safe location. He wanted his wand; he wanted to feel the familiar wood, and magic coursing through his fingers.
“Well,” Harry said, positively uneasy to be retelling the story, but also not the type of person to back down. “You, uh, fell on top of me. Your body was limp, and your heartbeat stopped. It was… terrifying. Before you interfered, I could tell that Drys had had the killing curse on the tip of his tongue, and I was ready to meet my end. But, you just showed up out of nowhere, right as the curse left his lips. I saw Drys being splashed by some liquid, and then you fell on me, green light filling up every inch of the forest.”
“You’re right.”
to mess with Harry’s feelings, since the prat was so soft and kind, and the type of secret Draco was hiding would offset all of that. It would offset whatever emotions Harry felt towards Draco, and Draco was too selfish to ruin it by explaining to Harry he’d been lying to him for the past two weeks.
“Okay, sure, yeah.”
He could barely look anyone in the eye anymore, because he was officially a murderer. A cold blooded killer. Someone who he had thought he would never turn into.
He rummaged through his trouser pocket and took out both letters. He opened the letter that had one simple word:
. I haven’t forgotten, believe me.” Harry licked his lips
to obtain the envelope and seal.
Nothing.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was Madame Pomfrey, hurrying toward him, wand and potion bottle in hand. There were also three Aurors. One of the three was the man who had originally been standing in the room when Draco first woke up. Then there was a woman with black hair and an emotionless expression, and standing next to the woman was a short man with an unkind smile.
The lyrics danced around in Draco’s head, and although he had absolutely no clue what the lyrics meant, he found the song incredibly enjoyable. However, he would
“Please don’t kill Harry. Kill me instead! Just leave him alone!”
“That is not my book,” Snape simply said.
However, through all of the craziness in his recent life, all the good that came, he still couldn't get past the dark thoughts, haunting him every second of the day.
Blaise reached across the table to pat him lightly on the shoulder. “You really need to work things out with Potter, mate.”
“Thanks for doing this,” Harry murmured.
that deep, but the blade could’ve been enchanted or some bullshit, causing more harm than Draco could physically see.
.” The urge to argue against what Harry said was incredibly hard to ignore.
“Harry I’m so sorry! I never wanted this to happen!” Draco was practically screaming now.
4) The scars on his face and chest.
It was then that Draco realized more than half of the Great Hall’s occupants were watching him. Not watching him in disgust or anything related, but the way they constantly looked at Harry; with admiration and awe.
“What? Of course we are! That’s what friendship is, Draco. I’m not just going to abandon you.”
They had guessed that they needed to make their way to Slughorn’s room when Snape’s book started ominously glowing. It had made sense, since last Friday night they had finished brewing the Restorative Potion around ten, which now made it exactly seven days since when they had started the potion. It was finally time to test it out, and see if it worked, returning everyone back to their normal state.
Draco was utterly confused. What the fuck was going on?
As they walked in, the door automatically closed behind them, and Draco was hit with an overwhelming, but most certainly welcome, breeze of fresh, cool air.
“I’m not trying to! It’s just- we hadn’t even said aloud if we were friends or not yet, and a part of me thought we weren’t; that you were only being kind so we could get through these weeks together. And when we became friends, I was too frightened to tell you about the secrets I’d been keeping, because I didn’t want to mess our friendship up! Yes, I know it’s stupid, but I’m stupid, and I don’t think clearly.”
“What are you-” Draco stopped himself as he saw a glint of something shiny and translucent in front of him, slightly reflecting in the wand light. He looked up to stare at the sky, and saw that the shiny-translucent thing was quite literally all around them, encasing them, just like Potter had said. It was like a huge spherical ward that went up miles high, and stretched width-wise miles long.
Draco thought miserably,
the fuck are you doing all of this? You people love to talk in riddles, huh? Just get to the point already!”
They both stepped into the room
. He didn’t even want to think of the fact that she had to look at it.
sort of looks they’d present. Pansy told him that the whole school knew of the sleeping curse. The whole Wizarding World knew, basically. All the details they knew, though, were that Harry and Draco had been the only ones awake during the crisis, and had somehow woken everyone up.
“Yes!” Potter somewhat squealed.
But the other half felt relieved and was rejoicing.
He really didn’t want to have to stand in front of McGonagall and bloody well
“Uh, thanks, but no thanks. I have to work on homework.” He knew that she could see right through the lie, it was a Friday night, he had the whole weekend to work on homework. But, she didn’t comment on it, instead she offered a good night to him and grabbed her own bag, leaving the room behind two Ravenclaws.
“Yeah, yeah you’re right. Let’s get going.”
To no one's surprise, Draco was reading a random book in the library, while Harry was off practicing new defensive spells.
They weren’t wrong.
Draco couldn’t imagine his life without Harry in it either. He hoped Harry knew that.
“No. The real answer, Potter.”
Draco shook his head and swallowed, eyes once again reaching everywhere except Dumbledore’s face.
He steadied himself, and took one last glance down at the page in front of him before casting, “
Harry’s body was; abs and dark hair at his navel and just
He could defeat anything with Harry by his side, he’d told himself. But when Harry was gone, what was he to do?
“Can we take another one?” Draco asked, excited beyond belief.
“See you next Thursday!” Elizabeth said as he was leaving.
“I got this. It’s probably just the wind. Besides, you went off without me when you ran to Slughorn’s classroom to retrieve the vial with the Restorative Potion. I think it’s my turn to run off without you,” Draco reasoned. Harry was about to retort back some snarky comment, no doubt, so Draco cut in: “
They moved their bodies in unison, sliding down right next to each other. Draco ended up a little ways in front of Harry, but they were still pretty close.
Draco wanted to shout at Harry and tell him oh how incredibly wrong he was. Harry didn’t know about the offer where Draco was supposed to hand over Harry’s
The walk to the unknown location to which Harry was leading Draco to was unbearably quiet. They both didn’t have a clue as to what to say to each other now that their reunion was over.
Even though he had specifically told himself he wouldn’t let himself fall to the ground, he fell to the ground. He hit his head painfully on the brick wall behind him, which made the excruciating pain that was already starting to overtake his whole body, so much worse.
things he had done over two weeks that would be acceptable to arrest him for.
“That is the real answer, Malfoy. I still dislike you. I still want to see for myself that you’ve changed. But, I’m trying to be nicer since we are stuck with each other.” Potter was wandering around the room, brushing his hand over pieces of furniture. His other hand was sticking some sort of biscuit into his mouth, and Draco could just
He wasn’t sure why the figure needed Harry’s blood, but it most certainly was going to be used for something evil, since why else would anyone need the
Theo now hated Draco for being a Death Eater. He had openly voiced to him how disgusting and vile Draco was, and how he’d made Slytherin’s reputation even worse than it already was.
leave Hogwarts’ grounds. He would be breaking a part of his probation, and that might make the scenario where he’s beside his father’s cell, quite real. The problem at hand was extenuating, and the Aurors might go easy on him because he was trying to save Hogwarts, and he bloody well wasn’t able to ask for permission, but he didn’t know for sure that they would let him off the hook.
At first, the whole situation was terribly awkward. There was a huge gap between the two of them, and neither of them seemed to want to close the space. Draco debated on taking the risk and closing the space between them, but Harry got to it first, and their chests were touching. The closeness was intoxicating, however, in the best way possible.
He was more than content, he was in love, he was really in love with Harry, and Harry was maybe in love with him.
That made Draco contemplate Potter’s offer. He knew no one who wasn’t invited to the castle by the Headmistress herself couldn’t enter Hogwarts’ grounds. But, Potter could very well be slaughtered out in the open in Hogsmeade. There weren’t protective wards around the village like Hogwarts, and if Potter died, and the curse broke, everyone would think he had killed Potter of course. If he was lucky he would be sent to Azkaban right next to his father’s cell. If he wasn’t lucky, well… he didn’t want to think about that.
, Pansy was something else.
He looked up at her, and she looked down at him; her eyes big and wet. She was staring at him in pure amazement.
Draco was wide-eyed as he looked from Snape to the book still clutched in his hand. “How does it know how many people are around it though? This doesn’t make sense. Why can’t you have just made it easy.”
“I could never!” Draco said. Harry dropped his hands to give Draco a pointed look. “I could never
On Thursday, he set out to talk to Elizabeth about his questions.
So, he worked steadily with Blaise by his side and tried to ignore any distractions. All of his classmates and teachers gave him a wide berth in general, they tried not to go near him or acknowledge him, which was a much different kind of berth from the one before the Curse. Draco conceded that it was because what happened with Harry and him was mysterious, and the full story wasn’t out yet. They couldn’t be so sure of what would happen around Draco. The only logical solution, according to his classmates, was to avoid him like the plague.
to be with him. No if, buts, or maybes. Harry had kissed Draco, Harry had wanted to kiss Draco a second time in the kitchens, Harry had danced with him and laughed with him and smiled at him and only him because, despite everything, Harry had feelings for Draco.
Harry’s wand, and shook his head in self-deprecation. “And to finish what you were saying, I had originally wanted to offer up Kaspian, but I knew you wouldn’t have been pleased.” Draco’s fingertips felt the wood of Harry’s wand, and snatched it quickly, not wanting to touch any cobwebs.
“I was. But, as a child, my… friends, used to make fun of me. But, now that I think back to it, it was so stupid, because like, I know plenty of people who have

“Ready to go?” Harry asked as Draco finished pulling his bag over his shoulder with one hand.
“The thought of fighting

Now, he tried to surround himself with the warmth and happiness he got when thinking of that memory. It helped keep himself calm and grounded when he thought of joyful moments.
Taking Draco’s sleeved left arm, Harry kissed his wrist gently. “I love you.”
“You know what, Draco? I’ll let you choose,” Drys said, “you can be under my control, but fully aware of everything going on around you, and have no power to stop any of it; having to stand there and watch Harry die while you
“Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen to me while I’m gone, it will take a minute, promise,” Harry said, already starting his run back towards Slughorn’s room.
They had already ruled out the option of them both sleeping in either Gryffindor or Slytherin together. All of the beds were occupied by their roommates, leaving only one bed open; Draco’s bed and Potter’s bed. They were most certainly not going to sleep together in one bed. They had both silently agreed on that fact. They had talked about transfiguring a bed out of some other piece of furniture in one of their common rooms, but they both weren’t the best at transfiguration, and they weren’t able to agree on which common room they should occupy.
Harry put on his glasses. “Were you laying in my bed?”
And Draco? Draco was gripping the sheets on the bed and willing himself not to start sobbing. He was trying to repress his memories spent in Azkaban, but it was hardly working.
It was that thought, the thought of Harry Potter and his stupid green eyes and messy black hair, the thought that they could maybe have a future together if Draco put in so much more effort than he had before, that made him drop his Professor’s letters and his exam paper, and wipe away the doubt that was threatening to hold him captive.
Harry continued, “I don’t really use it anymore, though. It’s back in my room in Gryffindor tower.”
Draco loved Harry so much, he had willingly sacrificed his own life for Harry’s. Harry loved Draco just as much in return, and that love had saved Draco’s life. The mixture of their feelings and Draco’s action moments before
Not like they had done anything… dirty, or whatever. But, resting your head on another man’s shoulder while whispering, “You’re the best part of me,” would come off as completely weird if the other man was straight.
He took a deep breath. “I know this might sound silly or dumb, but I wish for you to hear me out. It took me too long to realize you were genuine when you told me you wanted to be my friend. That you wanted to be my friend even after the Curse, despite all the hate you would get for it. I thought what was best for you, and for me, was to stay apart from each other, because surely, nothing good would come from the opposite.
“I know.”
Of course no one had been awake. Every single person had been in the same spot as the last time Draco had gone to his common room.
“Oh. Okay,” Draco said. So they hadn’t seen their kiss, or anything remotely intimate, Draco thought- which was the only good news he’d heard so far.
“Oh,” Draco managed to choke out. So Harry
“To rid the world of Purebloods and Death Eaters once and for all,” Drys spat out.
Draco wasn’t exactly sure if Potter had really said anything, or if it was his mind making stuff up. They’d never said goodnight to each other before. What had changed?

“So, let’s go around and share one good thing that happened this week, and one not so good thing,” She said.
to them. Potter was now the only exception besides Pansy that he talked to on a regular basis. And he didn’t
Harry sat there, staring into the fire, his back to Draco.
After Blaise had punched Theo, he became a part of Draco and Pansy’s little group. Draco had another friend.
“Says the stalker; the stalker who apparently knew I was
“You didn’t need to ask.”
“Hopefully nothing of the sort happens again.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter.”
But now that there were people filling the hallways to the brim again, he felt like he wasn’t allowed to look at people. He didn’t want Harry to know that, though.
“I’m not answering your stupid question until you answer mine. What’s in the woods?”
The Figure’s outside appearance didn’t look any different than he had the other times Draco had seen him; the hooded cloak and scary composure hadn’t changed at all.
“We hope we aren’t intruding,” Pansy added.
“No, dear,” She said with sad eyes.
creating a cloud of smoke,
Arteries were usually deep, though, and the cut didn’t
Something unexpected happens to Draco... something he thought he'd never have to deal with again.
“What are you talking about?” Potter asked.
Harry looked like he was about to cry, but he didn’t. Draco was hanging onto Harry’s every word, and knew he probably looked like a dog begging for food, but he was too engaged in Harry’s story. He could honestly make a very clear picture in his mind of Harry lying in bed all summer, moping and being miserable. It’s what Draco did all summer, while he waited for September first.
that might be a little bit too dark, even for him, but the thought did bring a small smile to his face.
“It’s getting dark out, you wanna go soon?” Harry asked, coming up behind Draco.
He pressed on. “I’m not sure if there’s a blatant way of telling you why I’ve been avoiding you, but I’ll try my best to explain.”
“Fuck!” Potter shouted as his head went into his hands. Draco was surprised at the outburst, he was upset with the situation too, but was he screaming? No. “Why can’t I just have a normal school year? Just once! It’s all I ask.” Potter spoke from behind his hands.
“Draco? What are you doing?” Harry said as he blinked a couple times, clearly not believing his own eyes.
As he neared the hallway that split into two directions, one towards the Great Hall and one towards McGonagall’s office, he noticed that there really was no one else around. It was a Sunday afternoon, students should have been wandering around the halls at their leisure, especially around noon, which meant it was lunch time.
In that moment, Draco realized two things.
people, and no longer hide in the shadows anymore. I think that’s one of the first things I’m going to do when the sleeping curse is lifted; apologize to everyone and just make it clear I’m a different man.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You already know the answer to that.”
Potter continued to act strange and closed-off around Draco as they had brewed the Restorative Potion together. Well, Draco did all of the actual work, and Potter handed Draco the ingredients he needed, much like he did the previous Friday in Potions class.
“But- your face- I-”
Draco blanched. “What?” He hadn’t been expecting that response from Harry.
(Spoiler, but not really: Next chapter is the last chapter of normalcy before everyone falls under the sleeping curse)
“Stay right here, I’ll go grab the correct vial.” Draco gave Harry an exasperated look that he hoped told him,
He hadn’t been sure, before, that Harry liked him, or even loved him, for that matter. But surely, Harry felt whole when he was with Draco. Harry always laughed when he was with Draco. He laughed, he smiled, he danced, he ran through the halls of Hogwarts when he was with Draco.
“You know, I wouldn’t be surprised if some dark wizard was out to destroy us all again.”
Harry peered at Draco with almost fully closed eyes, and then brought up a hand to touch Draco’s face, almost as if he was making sure it was really Draco before him.
There was no way Draco would ever give up, but he really didn’t have a clue where Harry could be. It seemed like the easiest and obvious solution, to give up, but Draco knew what taking the easy path ensued, and it wasn’t something he wanted to take again.
“Do you want me to take your shirt off?” Harry asked as his eyes raked over Draco’s face.
“Hmmm, Touché.”
His feet reluctantly started moving, and before he knew it he was doing a weird jog-like-run thing, trying his best to catch up to Potter. He cast a
Draco was standing side by side with Drys as they walked into Hogwarts together, the other Death Eaters following them. He was then a witness to all of the Death Eaters and Drys murdering the Pureblood students and teachers. He didn’t feel anything as he watched Pansy die, along with Blaise, Theo, and countless others.
“Of course.”
Draco was suddenly filled with a load of endearment for Potter. Pansy was the only other person who had ever said similar words to him, and it meant a lot coming from Potter, of all people. Someone who he would have never thought in a million years would know he was gay.
He was startled when he felt a cold hand touch his elbow. He could feel how cold Potter’s palm was even through his shirt material, and he vaguely wondered how long he’d been out in the snow.
“You don’t even know the half of it.”
She looked like she was about to say something else, but Professor Wynn had started levitating the exam sheets to everyone, so she promptly shut her mouth.
“You’re still bleeding,” Harry commented, picking up his wand that had fallen onto the floor right next to his glasses that thankfully weren’t broken.
“It’s okay to be scared,” Potter sympathized.
“I’m gay.”
didn’t feel like arguing with Harry. He figured they’d argue later once they discussed everything that had been filling up Draco’s head for the past however many days.
Draco was about to snap at the moron who hadn’t been paying attention, because certainly it wasn’t his own fault, when he recognized who said moron was.
But, Harry wasn’t with him, and Harry didn’t know Draco had sent a letter to his father.
Potter was rocking back and forth slightly on his feet, wringing his hands at his sides. He was glancing all around them like there was something that was obviously there, that Draco could not see. Draco squinted in front of him, trying his hardest to see what Potter apparently saw, but he just continued to look out at the plain fields of grass, with outlines of trees in the distance, no interesting objects in sight.
Yesterday, Harry had told Draco that
Of course, the Aurors had to check if there were any dangerous charms on letters sent into Azkaban, but that didn’t affect Draco’s plan in the least. The only charm he would be placing on his letter was Obice Confractus, and that was hardly a dangerous spell.
book that only contained the spells I had come up with; not nearly as much information included that would help me with my task.
Groaning at his words, Draco picked up a piece of toast and nodded to his owl as it dropped a letter in front of him and a couple copies of the
It made sense, Draco presumed. Their transfigurations professor practically worshipped Potter, and not the normal amount either. Though everyone else in Hogwarts and in the Wizarding World worshipped Potter an unhealthy amount too.
or else he would combust. Harry’s top lip brushed across Draco’s, warm and somehow familiar, smelling of peppermint. It was the best feeling in the universe. Draco readied himself to close the gap with his own lips…
Draco told himself that he hadn’t given into the urge to
His chance to do so came unexpectedly.
Harry was looking directly at him, his eyes taking in all of Draco’s body. Draco didn’t feel exposed or vulnerable one bit; he felt alive. Harry’s mouth then opened wide in disbelief, and Draco grinned.
Draco swung his legs over the side of the bed, and was immediately met with a sharp burst of pain coming from his chest. So his wounds weren’t fully healed yet. But Pomfrey wouldn’t mind if the reason he got out of bed was to check on her well-being, right?
“No.”
Draco explained every detail of how he had done it. He explained how he used the spell to break magical wards, Obice Confractus, out of Snape’s book, and how he’d assumed the spell would allow the passage of only small objects through the ward, rather than human bodies, or breaking the ward as a whole.
“So you’re telling me, we had a map to this entire school, a map that would let us see if anyone else was moving around, and instead we traveled the school daily, checking for people?” Draco was incredulous.
He wanted to rip both of his Professors letters in half, along with his exam. He wanted to sit against a wall and wrap his arms around his legs, while he tried to disappear from existence. He wanted life to not be so fucking hard and awful all the time. He wanted to be good.
“Hmmm.” Potter looked skeptical. Like he didn't believe a word Draco was saying.
So he kept his eyes straight ahead of him, trying his best to ignore all the looks. He wanted to hold Harry’s hand, to intertwine their fingers and cling to him like Harry was his only source of oxygen. Maybe Harry was thinking the same thing.
been perfect. The thing between him and Harry made it far from that. Although, granted, some aspects of his new found life were pretty nice.
“This. All of this. Everything.”
Drys hissed out, “you have two options here. I will only say this
“Sometimes we just have to accept that good things happen; no strings attached,” Potter shrugged slightly.
“So I’m guessing our secrets weren’t deep enough, or whatever,” Potter offered up.
After a lot of thinking, he figured that the charm the book had given to break through magical barriers had worked, just wasn’t strong enough to break through such a huge ward, like Potter had said. He guessed a small object could possibly go through the ward, they hadn’t tested it out with rocks like they usually did, but he hoped he would be correct.
Harry shook his head. ”Nope.”
Even when the curse was broken, Draco figured no one else would come in here; he doubted anyone even knew this room existed. The Garden didn’t look like it had been visited in many years, maybe even a decade or so.
“Malfoy. What were you doing in there?”
“Oh.” Harry removed himself and stood up. “Sorry.”
Draco wasn’t exactly sure if Harry was now casting defensive spells because he believed something horrible would happen tomorrow that they needed to prepare for, or if he just simply hated sitting around. He took a wild guess, and came to the conclusion that Harry just hated sitting around, from what he’d observed the past two weeks. And, Friday night, Harry had specifically told him he didn’t think Sunday was an omen of death. Draco really hoped Harry was right.
The Eighth Years were allowed to leave Hogwarts and go down to Hogsmeade whenever they liked, as long as they got back before curfew. He knew they’d gone down a lot and threw parties almost every Thursday, but he never knew where exactly the parties were thrown until now. Pansy never asked him to go with her before today. He’d never said anything about it to her.
“Po- Harry. What?”
Variations of the phrase,
Ever since that night in the Room of Requirement, Harry and Draco had slept there together every night. Eventually, Draco had had to tell Pansy and Blaise where he went off to every night, to which Pansy had laughed in his face upon finding out it was to go snuggle up next to Potter.
Theo was like an annoying, prickly thorn, stuck in his robes, that was always just
When Draco had used the term ‘Dark Lord,’ Harry gave him an exasperated look, and Draco was certain Harry was going to scold him, but instead, he looked sorry, and he snuggled up closer to Draco, like he finally understood why it was so incredibly hard for him say You Know Who’s real name.
He didn’t know why his brain filled up with stupid thoughts like those. It was a waste of space. But he couldn’t keep them from coming. He was filled up with way too much hope.
“I hardly think that if I pushed you into the water fountain, you would die. You’re being just a tad overdramatic, you git.” Draco nudged his shoulder to Harry’s.
“Maybe
He rubbed her back carefully, hearing her sobs and feeling wet, gross substances on his neck. He felt her whole body shaking.
“Yeah. Snape.” Potter turned to face Draco straight on. “Look at the cover, it says ‘The Hearts’ Deepest Secret Will Uncover More Than What You Seek.’” His finger pointed to the words as he said them aloud.
“In theory, yes. I wouldn’t understand why it would just be my father and I affected by it. But, you really don’t think He’s back again, do you?”
“How did you not die? When you were a baby? The Dark Lord hit you with the Killing Curse, and you survived.”
Draco was pretty sure that book did
So we're getting close (kind of) to the climax of the story. The events that happen in the next chapters are literally what I built this story around and even though it's taken me forever to get to this point, I'm finally here and ready to make this story all come together!
to stop resisting the pull of the Mark, and let all of your worries and emotions wash away; watching Harry die while not having to suffer. Of course, the outcome of these two options will still be the same; I’ll have to turn you over to the Ministry and blame every death on you, but wouldn’t you rather give in for the last day of your life? Wouldn’t you rather not suffer while you watch Harry Potter die?”
“Okay, I meant how did you get trapped in there? Why didn’t you just
all those things- lead to love?
“Alright,” Draco said.
hand- pressed up against his chest. He then realized there were another pair of legs tangled slightly in his.
“One last thing,” Draco said, “why wake everyone up from the curse in the first place? Surely, it would be much easier to leave everyone in an unconscious state, so no one can stop whatever evil plan you’ve concocted.”
that was the case before, especially after he received the letter from his father, but now that he had confirmation from the man who’d cursed everyone himself, Draco wanted to scream. He really
But what was he doing instead of patrolling? He was sitting at the top of the Astronomy Tower. Moping in misery.
“Hey. Draco. Don’t speak of yourself like that. You’re not a monster.”
“Together,” Draco agreed.
After a bit of light talking regarding what she had seen in the Pensieve, Draco stood to leave, but wasn’t actually planning on leaving quite yet.
“Oh, okay.”
Although, he supposed there had been articles on all the Death Eater deaths, along with the imprisonment of Alec Kaspian. It must be common knowledge that Draco was now the only living Death Eater; that, of all other things, might inspire questions amongst people. Alec was also a close friend of Harry, which was suspicious, too.
Potter nodded in agreement. “I guess we weren’t able to find this antidote because we’d been looking in curses and charms, not potions.”
It would always be there.
He wanted to hit himself now. What if someone really had entered his mind while he slept last night? What if it was the cloaked figure he saw in his dream? What about the message the figure was trying to convey?
“Mother,” Draco said as she let go. “What are you still doing here?”
Draco was going to protest. But, he knew that he honestly loved saying
“Soooooo,” Pansy said with a mischievous smile.
as he went along to detect a human presence.
Granger frowned down at him. She was still on her knees beside him and he was still laying on his back, his head lifted up a bit.
“How much did you see?” Draco asked worriedly. What if Harry had given them all of his memories over the past two weeks? What if they all saw them kiss?
Drys had been completely disintegrated due to the contents of the potion Draco had soaked him with, so that was the end of that with the Aurors. All of the Death Eaters’ bodies were taken care of.
“Uh.” Draco thought Potter knew about his probation requirements. He didn’t really want to recount them, but he supposed he had no other choice. “I can’t. Learn the defensive spells that is.”
“Why don’t you just use silencing charms?” Draco asked Potter.
“Look, I know you’re just trying to be nice, and I appreciate it, but I know I’m not welcome here. You may welcome me, but literally no one else does.” He knew he shouldn’t be talking the way he was to her, but he felt the need to stress the fact that
And that was all.
“When did you write this?” Harry asked, annoyance and pain seeping into his voice. “When did you get the response? And how on Earth did you surpass the ward that's keeping us locked in?”
himself on the spot.
, the most depressing thought, Harry didn’t care enough to go running after Draco this time. Maybe he finally saw right through Draco’s lies, and didn’t care if Draco got hurt or kidnapped.
Draco’s head snapped up to look at Harry. “What are you doing here?” Draco asked, even though it was a foolish question.
Except, for Draco, his life was far from the one before the Curse. His life
“Wait, before we go, shouldn’t we get changed?”
He was prepared for Snape to mock him and tell him how un-Malfoy like he was acting, as he no doubt looked like a toddler on the verge of a tantrum, all of the anger and shame of the mishaps of the day ready to burst out of him, but Snape had this expression that conveyed that Draco was more than allowed to be upset at the moment, and Dumbledore- like always- wore an expression that made it seem like he just knew
” She sputtered. She was now kneeling beside him and looked positively frightened from what he could tell.
Potter looked annoyed at Draco’s lame attempt for an excuse. “Pleaseee, Malfoy. Books aren’t going to get you anywhere. Trust me.” Potter said in the most whiny voice humanly possible. Draco was glad to know Potter was still immensely immature.
And, now that Draco thought about it, Drys’ whole plan really did revolve around Draco. He wanted to make the Malfoy’s suffer for what they had done to Drys’ family. He wanted to make sure that no matter the outcome, at least someone in the Malfoy family would lose. He’d strategically planned it out, that whatever reality took course, he’d at least partially get his way, one way or another.
The kitchen was filled with bustling House Elves, running around frantically and carrying trays of food. Their squeaky voices were arguing over one another.
The Death Eater’s looked around at each other, contemplating what they should do. “How old is he?”
“Are you sure you want to eat in the Great Hall today, Draco?” Pansy asked from beside him. “I’m sure we can find somewhere else to get food.”
“Nothing.”
Draco glanced skeptically down at the book, faced with the reality of not wanting to have to reveal something so confidential, but wanting to earn Potter’s trust back at the same time.
Reunions and whatnot.
“That sounds like the words of a man who’s been defeated.”
He thought about how his life aside from Harry was so much better than before. How he finally had the confidence to walk up to both Granger and Weasley and apologize to them both. How he’d talked McGonagall into letting him take Muggle Studies even though it was already halfway through the year.
“Afraid it’s me, Potter. Though I wouldn’t expect you to notice I’ve changed.” Draco felt a snowflake fall directly on the tip of his nose.
The slide felt like it could continue on forever, and Draco wished it would’ve. However, he soon saw the end, and braced himself for landing, Harry now several feet behind him.
Once again, Potter made many sounds that designated he was trying to start up conversation, but came up short every time.
, I tell you.”
She continued to ask him dull questions about his week for a while. Draco answered in one word sentences, and she didn’t seem to mind. He didn’t exactly trust her, he barely trusted anyone for that matter, and yet he was about to bring up something extremely personal. He needed some answers, though, and even if Elizabeth couldn’t give him those answers, she could possibly prompt new thoughts in his head.
“No, I really did knock it over.” Potter’s voice sounded stiff and guarded.
“Look, I know your profession has nothing to do with curses, but just, do you have any guesses? I don’t really have anyone else to talk to about this.”
“Yes.” Potter didn’t sound quite sure though.
was really the ultimate liar there.
“It’s really nothing- I just- I wanted you to have this.” Harry held out his hand, the chain and red diamond shaped piece gleaming up at him. “I found this gem at one of my lowest points last summer. I picked it up from outside the Weasley’s and kept it in my pocket until I found this chain lying around. So, then I turned it into a sort of necklace, so I would never be without it. It’s been a reminder to me after all this time, there’s always something new, awaiting to be discovered, even in the darkest of times.”
not moving at all. He crashed to the ground right in front of him. Harry, who wasn’t moving. Harry who
“Thanks for helping me today,” Potter said as they made their way to the seventh floor.
Draco couldn’t get over the sweet taste of Harry, and he knew if he was able to, he would kiss Harry for the rest of his life.
“Should we… open it?”
“I am afraid all magic has its limits. And when I created the book in my youth, I could not figure out the spell to make the questions infinite. So, the limit is only three.”
He then shook his head and faced forward again, continuing the walk to transfigurations with Draco following close behind, fingernails digging into his palms.
The sides of his vision grew blurry, and with that came the shortness of breath, and the shaky, sweaty feeling. He hated Aurors and he hated Azkaban. He’d said to himself he’d never do anything that would lead to him stepping foot in that wretched place again. He wanted to know what had happened, and why he was thrown into a situation that involved fucking Aurors.
Draco hated that Mark with all his being. He hated it so much, he had tried multiple times, to no avail, to remove it. He had tried burning it, cutting it, using magic on it, but nothing worked.
“I have my reasons.”
Draco took a deep breath.
. Maybe I can help.”
Draco desperately wanted to turn back time, to when they were eleven years old. He wanted to have a redo with Harry. Because maybe, just maybe, if they had been friends from the start, Draco could have learned from Harry’s wise words, and changed for the better at a young age, and not have had to deal with the horrors of being on the Dark Lord’s side.
“I don’t think anyone’s noticed, truthfully.”
“Spit it out, Potter, what?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ve known latin probably since I was ten. I also know french.”
“But I am, Harry! You don’t even know half of it.” He was back to scratching his forearm. “I can’t do this anymore,” Draco breathed.
“But-”
The moment Draco stood up, though, Harry’s face dropped.
And it hurt terribly. Luckily, he kept it at bay, and they had lovely conversations. Draco knew the thought would haunt him later. But for now, he wasn’t going to dwell on it.
Draco blinked, immediately wondering if Harry could hear his thoughts. “Yes?”
“I’m just trying to be nice-”
“What’s wrong? Is something wrong?” Draco asked, worried. “Do you- do you regret last night?”
Harry’s breaths became fewer and fewer.
He made sure she was in her room, which was directly attached to the Hospital Wing, before he looked at his arm again. He could tell that the cut from before was almost perfectly healed, leaving only the smallest scar. There were other small scars around the same area too, ones that he inflicted on himself. The Mark itself was still moving, and Draco was terrified out of his mind.
Draco unlocked the bathroom door, trying to reign in his shaky breaths before attempting to fall back asleep. First thing when they woke up, Draco would tell Harry he had had another vision, circling around the details of his offer.
Pansy was standing in front of him, and she looked plastered. He could tell from the way she was swaying profusely.
Pansy continued menacingly, “If that fucker has done something to hurt you, Draco, I swear…”
“Did you harm yourself?” he asked, beyond worried as he looked down at it.
“I don’t care, truly. Fuck everyone else, they can say and think all the shit they want about you or me.”
He was done picking the easy choice.
Draco had no clue what to do with himself ever since he’d come to the realization that he fancied Harry. Granted, it was a lot to take in, especially when he had a million other things to deal with.
Last night? From the large windows in the room, Draco could obviously see it was dark out, which meant it was Saturday night, and he’d been sleeping all day. What a bloody waste of a day. He could have been doing way more interesting activities were he not attacked… like reading, or studying…
“I just wanted to ask if you wanted to go to the library instead of hang around here,” Pansy said coolly.
be there, whilst talking and listening to his friends, including Alec.
Draco had already reluctantly told her almost all of the details about the two weeks, and the final battle with Drys. He conveniently left out the part where Drys dying had caused all the Death Eaters to die. The part where he had killed his father. The part where he had avoided death by the Mark. Although, of course she knew about the killing curse hitting him, and him not dying.
A line of tension that had been between them was cut. A line of tension that Draco hadn’t even known had been there in the first place. Probably building and building ever since they had first met. Probably waiting for them to finally become actual friends; two people that understand and accept each other. (To some extent, at least.)
Soo turns out there is still another chapter before the epilogue! So yeah, one more chapter where everything is officially tied up which will be pretty long and thennn the epilogue. Just a heads up, it will probably take me a while to write the last chapter. I might post the last real chapter and the epilogue together, but who knows!
Snape was squinting at the book still held in Draco’s hand. “Draco, come closer,” Snape said.
He didn’t want to hear that answer, but deep down he’d known what Drys would say.
Kaspian didn’t respond. Busted. Draco suppressed a snicker.
Draco, still holding onto his recklessness from the night, moved closer to Harry and draped his arm around him. Looking up to see Harry’s expression, Draco saw that he was smiling fondly, still tired yet glad to cuddle.
Their plates cleared and the atmosphere turned to a unique sense of relaxation: a feeling only acquired after you shared a brilliant meal that stuffed you full, with a more than brilliant person.
An unwilling test subject.
Even if he did have his wand, he still couldn’t bring himself to cast anything.
“I’m doing fine,” He said. He wanted to add, “Thank you for saving my life,” but he couldn’t seem to move his mouth to get the sentence out. It was also nice to know Granger had come to check up on him, he wanted to thank her for taking time out of her night to see him, but once again, he couldn’t seem to form the words.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Harry said. “Merlin, isn’t this whole thing weird?”
Like actually said, ‘Draco Malfoy.’”
“Malfoy? Is that really you? Or am I imagining things?” Potter asked as he glanced around the halls like he was looking for something.
He’d find another time to explain everything he was hiding, whenever that would be, but for now, he just had to hope and wish that Sunday wouldn’t be as bad as he thought, and that the visions meant nothing. They could possibly find another way to break the sleeping curse.
Potter groaned. “Those defensive spells are
“You know how you asked me about how I survived
He thought he was content with just the touch of lips; they were Harry’s lips, for Salazar’s sake. But when Harry’s tongue slowly found its way into Draco’s mouth,
But that one look from Harry shattered his entire world, that one revelation that came with it. Harry loved him. Harry
“I felt so much relief because I’d found out I hadn’t been alone, but when I had thought about it some more, the relief inside me went away; I was so upset that out of everyone in the castle, it had to have been you. But, it turned out okay, in the end. And I'm glad it was you, I'm glad I got to know you better the past two weeks and I'm glad we got to look past all of our past prejudices, and form… a- a friendship.”
in extremely good shape, so it made sense. He probably took the time to exercise; Draco wished he could ask him if that were true or not.
“You know you didn’t have to do that,” Draco said.
Technically, he wasn’t stealing the book. He’d return it to the tabletop when he was done, but he had to find out more about his Mark.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but found he had no comebacks; he was a Death Eater.
Potter had waited outside the wall that led to Slytherin, and when Draco had come out, Potter had
“I know we’re not… friends, or whatever. You don’t need to protect me.”
Automatically, Draco’s hand shot to the gem hanging around his neck, and realized it wasn’t concealed by his robes as he’d thought it had been.
Draco should have known.
Draco had yet another question. His mind kept coming up with more and more inquiries as seconds ticked by. “What if the whole Wizarding World is under this spell? The Ministry. The Aurors. Literally every head wizard. We’d truly be on our own.”
“Harry, I am one hundred percent positive.” Draco started to pour some of the green bubbling liquid into a small vial. “But, just in case something does go wrong for some reason, and when people come and find us, noticing Theo is… dead, or something, we’ll just say we had nothing to do with it, alright?”
“Right. Okay, yeah good plan. Let’s meet back up here when we’re done, yeah?”
You just- you just left me. Without a word.” Draco’s breaths came up fast and he was shaking slightly. He knew he shouldn’t be yelling and shouldn’t have punched Potter, even if it was half-hearted, but he was furious and could not calm down. He needed to take it out on the only other person around.
“We should get something to eat.” Potter stated. A light dusting of snow had started, covering Potter’s hat and shoulders with white flakes. They both noticeably shivered against the cold. “We should also get warm for a bit.”
everyone. Are you sure you’re making the right choice? Are you sure you're doing what heroes do?”
place, not a worse one.”
done? Nothing. He hasn’t so much as said a word to anyone but Pansy, for the most part, since the end of the war. Draco was starting to think there was something seriously wrong with him. Not that he hadn’t noticed that before, but now, with Harry’s help, things were starting to become so much more clear.
Dumbledore’s voice broke through Draco’s thoughts. “Draco,” he said, “May I ask, where’s Harry?”
Potter looked like he was going to say something to him, but he continued to keep his mouth shut. Draco wondered if it had anything to do with the other day when he’d told Potter never to speak to him again. At the moment, Draco didn’t know exactly where he stood with Potter. He supposed they were still enemies. Not the kind that hexed and shouted insults at each other anymore, but the kind that avoided each other whenever possible, and hated being in the other’s presence. It wasn’t like he hated Potter the way he did Theo or Kaspian, Potter had saved him from the Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement, and from Azkaban; he was sort of in Potter’s debt. But those two things did not make him
“Do you think you’re going to go?” Pansy asked lightly.
“That day, after our therapy session,” Draco said to Alec, “you- you were the one to- to-” Draco took a deep breath- “you were the one who cut my Mark.”
Harry had stolen the blankets some time during the night, and he was wrapped up all cozily in them, his leg and arm splayed on Draco in an uncomfortable position. Draco found he was freezing, and mentally berated Harry.
The fact that it was only Draco and Harry awake in the castle, so that Draco could bring the figure Harry's blood without any interference. Perhaps the figure wanted Draco to get close to Harry, earn his trust, and then betray him. Like any loyal Death Eater would.
“There’s a party in Hogsmeade tonight, if you’d like to come,” Harry said to Draco. But it was obvious the invitation was also extended to Blaise.
So that’s what Olive did, running up the stairs and coming back down with a boy Draco’s age, and going into a room which Draco presumed was the kitchen.
The snow piled over the grass was thick, but he trudged through it, heading in the direction of the pavilion. Once he made the walk to his destination, he plopped down on one of the steps leading up to the raised seating area. He felt like he didn’t deserve the comfort of a bench right now. He deserved to have the snow slapping his face, freezing his nose and cheeks, and certainly ruining his hair.
He hitched up his bag onto his shoulder and stared at Harry for a few seconds, trying to figure out what to say. “Well, uh, bye,” he said at last. Embarrassing.
But no matter how many comments they endured, how many disapproving looks were shot at them, Draco knew that it was better than hiding; better than having to pretend he wasn’t stupidly in love with Harry.
“And I guess what I’m trying to say,” Draco added on, “What I’m trying to say is that you’ve been a constant in my life, despite all odds, and recently I got to know you on a whole new level.”
“I did some research in the library for the past couple weeks, wanting to find answers to some questions I had regarding what happened during the Curse. I had pulled away from Drys’ thrall at the edge of the forest that day, and I came to learn that due to adrenaline, and the-- the need for saving you, keeping you safe, I broke it.” Harry waited for Draco to continue, playing with the blankets on the bed. “And when I thought I was surely going to die, that everything would end up going terribly wrong, I created these visions in my head. They represented something about me or what was important to me, and do you know what I saw? I saw you and me, dancing together in the Garden.”
. He stopped his mind from conjuring dirty thoughts on the situation, and focused on trying to comfort the boy who was trembling and mouthing unreadable words.
“I’m beginning to think I absolutely am not capable of casting this charm,” Potter said as he sat down on the chair he had been trying to disintegrate, pushing away a lock of hair from his forehead.
Draco was out of the hospital bed before he could answer his own question, grabbing his wand, and ignoring the pain in his chest. He walked carefully to Madame Pomfrey’s office and knocked lightly on the door. Nothing. He knocked a little harder, and still nothing. No noises or movements to indicate there was a living being on the other side of the door.
Not that Draco had a crush. But, even if he did he would never talk about it to Pansy. Though she did know he was gay. She knew ever since Sixth Year, when she had kissed him for the first time, and he visibly recoiled and had said how disgusting the experience was.
“Ugh. Okay, whatever. Let’s do this.”
He’d decided as they’d made their morning rounds to the Slytherin and Gryffindor common rooms that he would give in and tell the book a meaningful secret. He didn’t know what secret he would tell, but he told himself he’d figure it out when the time came. He’d wanted to tell Potter his decision right then as he made it, but couldn’t seem to form the right words. So here they were now, about an hour into their research session, finally confessing he was ready to tell a secret.
While pondering his lifestyle choices over the last week, he realized he hadn’t been paying attention to where he was heading. He was running straight towards a wall at full momentum, with absolutely no way of stopping in time to avoid a crash.
“Hey, Draco, Happy Birthday,” Blaise said as he stepped closer to Draco, patting him on the back.
Maybe that was why Draco was being arrested, because in the end Theo had been killed by the potion Draco had brewed.
The irony was sometimes too hard to believe.
Draco found he had started to cry. He tried to conceal his tears from Harry, but it was too late, Harry already saw.
A group of people stepped into the room. About six students. He recognized Zacharias Smith, who was leading the group, Theo, Calder Robins, and Justin Finch-Fletchley who were standing directly behind Smith, and towards the back of the group was a girl in Ravenclaw named Mandy Brocklehurst, and of course, Alec Kaspian.
The only real reason Draco felt like he had to stop Drys at this point was because he had to save Harry from being killed, along with a large number of people. Harry’s friends included, along with Pansy and his own parents. Although, if his father was already taken in by the pull of the Mark, wouldn’t he just die when Drys died too? Would Draco die if Drys died? Even if he was currently, ‘resisting’?
He set down the new bandage on the side table, he didn’t feel like putting it on his arm, even though Pomfrey told him to. He felt like he was betraying her trust, but it was such a trivial thing to do at the moment, he was sure she would forgive him if he knew what he was going through.
The rest of the night, Draco called out suggestions to Potter that he thought might help him cast the spell correctly. Potter practiced the spell on several chairs, and had no such luck disintegrating any of them. Draco hoped he would have had more luck had
It was becoming so tiring, staring at a spot on the map, that Draco heavily considered trudging over to Slytherin and shaking Theo until he woke. In hindsight, it was a good plan.
"To the stars through difficulties."
So he started from the moment he and Harry parted ways on that eventful Sunday morning.
He sat on the ground for a minute, collecting his breath and thoughts, before he managed to stand up and speed walk down different corridors he didn’t recognize. His right foot was now throbbing, but he didn’t seem to notice it as much as he noticed his forearm stinging, and the ringing that was attempting to swallow him whole.
“Watch where you're going next time, will you?” Draco said, attempting to sit up straight and failing.
“Tomorrow, yeah.”
Draco nor Potter said anything else, so Draco got up to search the shelves.
He snatched it from her hand and didn’t even have to look at the seal to know who it was from.
“And how is that…”
“You love it,” Draco responded, and Harry brought their mouths together again, this time letting their tongues push against each other. Harry let his tongue run over Draco’s teeth and when Draco moaned, Harry laughed, which made Draco bite down on Harry’s tongue, earning a pained ‘fuck’, before they were back to snogging again.
“Malfoy? It’s been like, three minutes, are you-”
It was the middle of the night when Draco sprung awake from his vision-dream. He still wasn’t sure what to call it exactly, but that didn’t matter.
“Yeah,” Draco responded, just as shocked at what was happening before their eyes. What he and Potter shared
His cheeks were hot and his breathing was ragged by the end. He thought he would combust from embarrassment or whatever right then and there. Half of himself was yelling at him, screaming at him, saying
“Adults suck,” Harry mentioned solemnly.
He carefully approached the tie like it might bite him, and looked up and down the hall, squinting to look for some other piece of clothing or artifact, with no luck. He knew where he was at, it was an adjoining corridor that led to Slughorn’s room. He and Harry had used it countless times. And out of all the times they had used it, there had never been a Slytherin tie there.
“Yes?”
Maybe life was programmed for him to always end up in wrong situations, faced with obstacles that pointed to evil, even if right away it was not always visible.
“See, you
if the whole McGonagall thing is the reason why you don’t want to go, I’ll ask her for you.
Draco ripped open the letter, only to see a neatly printed paragraph that could only be in his mother’s hand writing. This was the second time Narcissa had written to him since school started. Once before Christmas break, and now, in the middle of January. He began to read it.
just a kid. Everyone deserves a redemption. Everyone deserves a happy ending. Especially you.”
But, now, thanks to Harry, he’d been broken.
Potter looked astonished. “Wow, your secret certainly beats mine.”
Draco told Potter to start with
The door flew open, to reveal an uncomfortable looking Potter. He looked like he always did. Messy, ink black hair. Green eyes that stared directly into your soul. Tired, dark circles under those eyes. The same that Draco had under his eyes. Potter did look nice though. He had grown a lot during the time when the Wizarding World was under siege of the Dark Lord. His shoulders were more broad, and he had gotten even taller. Not as tall as Draco though.
They arrived at the Slytherin common room and flopped down on one of the couches. Draco took out his homework for potions and started to work on it while Pansy took out a magazine and flipped through the pages, only stopping to look at the fit models. He really did wonder why Pansy still hung out with him, when she could choose to spend her time with Theo, or Blaise who she so desperately loved, and yet she chose his company to theirs. The thought made his insides all warm. Even though she was annoying most of the time, and got on his nerves frequently, he was glad they were friends.
He heard what was probably Robins muttering something to Theo, and then heard the door to the bathroom open and close.
actually grateful for the offer of help, but he knew that he had to make things right between him and Harry by himself. There was no other way.
“I’m- I’m not done,” Draco said reluctantly.
