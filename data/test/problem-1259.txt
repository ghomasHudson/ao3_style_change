“As Albus had dated the girl previously, he presumed she knew some of his ‘secrets’. However, he told us he hadn’t been worried about the threat.”
Lily looks at him carefully. “So, it’s happening, then?” Harry detects a mixture of dread and panic in her eyes.
They are alone once more. They look at each other, but neither of them speaks. Harry knows what the reserve in Draco’s grey eyes means: they have a lot of talking to be done. Apologies, forgiveness, acceptance – and Harry knows it will not be uncomplicated, and that it will be bloody frustrating, and dreadful, and it might not even work out between them. But at the same time, he thinks…that it if he does not see it through, he will regret it for the rest of his life.
Malfoy suddenly chuckles. Harry lifts his brows at him, feeling a tinge of irritation, but quickly realising the man is not amused by what Harry had said, but by something else.
Potter looks stunned, unable to form words. Draco wonders if there are other things the boy is keeping from his father. He would quite like to point it out, out of spite, as he has always somewhat envied the relationship between Potter and Albus – like it wasn’t enough that Draco has already felt jealous of the bespectacled wonder since the day they met – envied Potter’s good terms with Scorpius, and how the two of them seemed to interact effortlessly, compared with Draco and Scorpius.
“What do you mean? Why couldn’t we take our girls home before the inspection is done?” Mrs Scott asks sharply, or, jumps at Harry in the hallway, as soon as the Head Auror steps outside from the classroom. Mr and Mrs Westen too step closer to him, both looking bewildered.
“Constant vigilance,” Harry warns his Aurors a moment before they are whisked away from their Headquarters.
Albus does the eye-thing again with Rose at the Ravenclaw table; who has evidently done a similar check-up with her own house table as she gives Albus a worried shake of her head. There’s something Albus cannot identify in her expression. She seems…more than worried. Terrified, even. He knows Rose is not easily shocked. Albus has an uncomfortable thought that perhaps Rose…knows who it is.
And then there’s Albus. Harry sighs wearily. Albus’s version actually sounded like it could’ve been the truth, but then again, there is history between him and the victim, there is the party… and then there had been that rather shocking reveal about how other people – witches, mainly – see him, and treat him.
something to confess. Him being private about his life has now spurred you on, and you’re certain he is hiding something!” Ginny rants.
Harry taps the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row, with the rhythm of ‘Helga Hufflepuff’, as McGonagall instructed to his Aurors, when Harry had been visiting the crime scene.
Albus lets out a snarl of exasperation, feels his cheeks flush red, feels the tightness in his chest wavering, but he doesn’t give his brother the satisfaction of knowing exactly what the hell is going on in Albus’s head – even though, he kind of gives it as he turns his back to James, and starts scrubbing the bedpans with a furious determination, in order to finish as soon as possible, so that he will be released and so that he doesn’t have to see James’s irritating face again.
Harry knew he had hurt Draco by refusing to run away with him. Was that what Blaise was trying to push him towards? Was it as simple as wanting his friend to be happy?
A hot wash of shame flooded Harry then. "Yes, sir," he said. He had not addressed Sirius as 'sir' for years, not since he was a child being disciplined.
Harry never backed down from a dare. He reached for Draco's hips, pulling him closer. He feasted his eyes on Draco's body and he remembered the thrill of lust he had felt before at the mere idea of performing this most intimate act. His lips darted out to moisten his mouth. Draco removed his glasses, his hand caressing Harry's face gently before pulling him forward. Harry opened his mouth, eager.
His interest began after school, after the war, when the frantic pairing-up amongst those few who survived had finally slowed down. There had been a firecall not too dissimilar to this morning’s: Pansy hissing gossip and Draco distracted by the remnants of booze and sex coursing through his system.
Harry hated it but he could see the sense. He had missed a full day already but went back the next to attend meetings and committees. Lucius Malfoy behaved as though precisely nothing had changed, as he always had and most likely always would.
Sirius took Harry to a gentleman's club for brandy, cigars and cards. Sirius had taught Harry himself, though Harry had never developed quite the same love of such games. Sirius was winning a game of whist and Harry had declined the invitation to join as one of the four; instead he wandered around, saying hello to old school mates and guests he'd met at the Bones' party. He accepted a large drink and nursed it quietly.
"I do," Draco said. "It would please me as well. Mother is annoyed at me for deserting her which means in turn that Father will be no pleasing company."
Ginny, Sirius, better judgement – all thoughts of anything but this moment flew from Harry's head. "Yes," he breathed and Malfoy smiled.
Harry came right down Draco’s throat with a shout. Draco managed to pull back just as Harry’s legs gave out from under him with the force of his orgasm and he slid down the wall to the floor.
Draco's gasps started to come out more like a word. Harry redoubled his efforts, thrusting higher now, hitting that perfect place inside of Draco with every motion.
“It means I can use the overruling of that objection as the basis for an appeal, if it comes to that.”
Sirius had chosen someone kind, even on his worst days.  Harry had chosen someone who could be devastatingly petulant and selfish, and it had never felt like a choice at all. He knew that Draco loved him, knew it down to his bones, but was Draco a person given to self-sacrifice?
“The nays have it. The bill must be reworded before it can be considered further. Let us break here for today and begin discussion of the next agenda item on our return.”
"Of course," Harry said, smiling. "It would be a pleasure. A change, certainly, to spend time with a baby girl."
Days passed. Harry received another letter, delivered by the same owl. It, too, he threw in the fire. He was half-afraid that Malfoy would do something overdramatic and ridiculous like send him a howler, but nothing else came.
Harry twisted his gloves between his fingers. "Recently I have found myself having feelings I fear may not be my own."
After dinner, after the celebration and the fireplace and the snide remarks on his time in London from Percy and Audrey, after the drinks and the jokes and the games of Chess and Snap, after all of that, Harry had lain awake for hours. There was insufficient space at the Burrow, so he and Sirius had returned to Grimmauld Place to sleep. Ginny was to stay at her childhood home that night and they would meet tomorrow.
"Indeed, yes," Sirius said. "I should write to him to finalise the details." He clapped Harry on the shoulder. "But not this evening. This evening, I think you and I should attend the opera!"
Now, Harry looked at him. He was still beautiful, in plum purple robes today. His nearness still sent white hot sparks through Harry's blood. But the shame and the self-loathing, the way he had felt so heartsick after their last encounter made it easy to say, "My wife needed me."
Now, though, with shock and the loss ringing through his head, his perspective had changed. "Do you know, I think if I ever saw Draco again
“To annoy you, of course, dear Draco,” Blaise drawled. “It is the central preoccupation of my life.”
Blaise reached out a hand to stroke Draco’s cheek. “Of course you are, Draco,” he said softly. “Who could resist your full charm?”
important to you." His tone grew more and more vicious as he dressed. "So go back and drool over your children and wrap yourself up in your wife and perhaps indulge in some furtive stroking of your arbor vitae if you can face your sodomite self for long enough!"
Draco's hips jerked forward in response and Harry found himself suddenly gagging as Draco's cock went deeper into his throat than he had anticipated. He pulled his mouth away, coughing slightly, and felt Draco pull away.
And it was. Ron and Hermione, George and Angelina, Percy and Audrey, Bill and Fleur: the only one missing was Charlie, who made it back from Romania so rarely, and of course Fred, whose loss in the war was a scar in the family that never fully healed.
"Harry, thank Merlin," Sirius said, throwing off his hat for Dobby to catch. "Where on earth were you? I looked everywhere before I came."
"You seem happy today, Harry," Ginny remarked on the last Sunday in May. "You seem calmer than you have in a long time."
"Oh yes," Sirius said, his face twisting again. "But she was his wife and Remus would not betray her.  He liked her very much as my niece, learned to love her as his wife.  Her death in the war was very hard for him.  The deaths of my parents and brother," Sirius' lips pulled back into a snarl, "were less hard for me."
Draco’s mouth was flapping a little, he knew it, but as quick as he could usually think up a flippant response, just at that moment nothing was coming to mind.
“Oh, well, if it’s just him,” Gabrielle said, her accent abruptly much more comprehensible. “What do you want, Malfoy?”
Harry rubbed his face. "I do not know, Hermione. I know our separation is making her unhappy but I cannot guarantee that things would improve between the two of us were I to return to her. She is no longer the girl I married."
Harry exchanged a wry look with Ernie as he pulled on his gloves. He was almost out of the room when Lucius appeared before him, striking like a snake. “Mister Potter,” he said, emphasising both syllables of
"And did you see that Starfish and Stick!" Ginny was saying. "Hopkirk was in such an amazing position, perfectly balanced in the air…"
Draco shook. “I don’t… I can’t do that, Harry. I worked so hard to be who I am. I can’t let him turn me back into that eleven-year-old who did everything he said to the point of committing our lives to the service of a madman.”
The last sight Harry had before he stepped through the portal to whatever it was that would take him to his hell was of Draco’s face, tear-stained and crumpled as the crowd turned on him, swallowing him up.
"Thank you for taking such good care of me," Ginny whispered to him softly one morning, sending him spiralling into shame all over again, wondering what she would say if she knew what he had done, how he had betrayed her.
"What the devil were you even hunting in May?" Harry wondered once Sirius had related his companion's numerous annoying habits.
Sirius snorted. "You know how tough those things' hides are. Spells simply bounced off it; it was lucky neither of us was hit by a ricochet and killed!"
He was English and proud of it but not blind to the faults of the Empire, and determined to make at least his small corner of it better. That was what he had fought the war for, to stand up to injustice. Somehow he had forgotten how much purpose such action had given him; he would not forget again.
Ron squeezed Harry’s shoulder. Solid as a rock, the best friend he’d ever had. “We never wanted to be anywhere else, mate. How did you forget?”
"Your godson," Malfoy repeated, his tone mocking the very concept. "Yes, your godson and ten years younger than you and yet you look at him as though you'd die for a chance to tear his very clothes from his body!"
“Yeah,” Draco said. After all, it had been, and if Potter had given him that, the least Draco could do was give Potter’s self-esteem a little shine.
“The question before the committee is as follows: Should the bill be presented in its current form to the Wizengamot for debate? Ayes to the right, nays to the left.”
Harry laughed. "Ah, well. In truth I should be paying more attention to politics, the Wizengamot and what not."
In the small space of the carriage, Harry found himself uncertain again. Malfoy sprawled on the seat opposite him with a smirk playing around his mouth. He seemed disinclined to offer conversation and so Harry spent the journey alternating between staring at him and desperately fidgeting with his hands to keep himself from doing something unpardonable. His skin crawled with the tension and he closed his eyes a moment and thought about raising his wand and Apparating back to Ginny.
“That may have been how it started. It does not surprise me, knowing him as I do. But it became far more than that. And I think you know it.”
A sound outside the cell made Harry’s head turn. Fawley had heard it too, whatever it was, as he stood at once. “Show yourself!” he said sharply, his wand out.
Draco laughed a little at that, and bent to nuzzle Blaise’s groin through his trousers. Blaise let his head fall back, his hand in Draco’s blond hair.
Harry caught Ron's eye and for a moment they agreed perfectly: Hermione without a cause was a Hermione neither could imagine.
"Meaning yes." Harry could hardly be surprised if Draco had learned some of his tells in his turn. Draco examined his cuff at length and Harry had to fight the urge to say something that would no doubt come out all wrong.
The image his mind produced at such a thought was sufficiently graphic that he jerked his hand away from the picture, taking deep breaths to calm his pulse. He glanced again at the ever-smirking face on the family tree and knew what it was Lord Draco had caused him to feel. The idea was at once grotesquely alien and horrifyingly familiar: something dark and immoral beckoned and told him it already knew his name.
"I don't need to hear what you thought," Harry snapped. He grabbed a team shot of the Harpies, and did the same for Puddlemere United. "Just these, thank you."
Harry reached through the bars and Padfoot ran across to greet him, licking his hand and letting Harry pet him and hold him close.
Pansy had actually come over that time so they could read it together and howl. Draco had some of his favourite excerpts memorised. Oh, there were inanities such as,
Draco’s rentboys, Harry thought, sickened. In their place. In their home. And it all pointed to Harry being the one frequenting them.
Harry flushed as Malfoy pulled away from him; the boys tittered. Malfoy's eyes glittered in triumph even as he turned to Filch, a bag of coins appearing from nowhere. "A room, Bertram for me and, oh, let's say, Kirke for my friend here. He has a taste for blond boys it seems."
Draco met his gaze, and gave an insouciant shrug. "I was delayed at the gaming tables. It was a winning streak, after all, and the allowance Father permits me would never enable the purchase of a robe such as this. Feel," he said, reaching for Harry's hands, "the lapels are velvet."
Pansy reached out to pat his hand. “I think you’d best just tell her,” she said, her tone a little too sardonic for Draco’s taste and he reached up to catch her hand just a shade too firmly in response.
, over and over again though he could not have said who he was thanking at the time; it certainly wouldn't have been Potter.
“I did not realise,” said Harry, “how far from myself I had grown until I came back to myself armed with new knowledge.”
Charlie's arms were full of Lily, but he didn't pause a moment. "I'll just keep this one a while," he said, ignoring the tension in that kind way he had of pretending oblivion.
Diggory met his gaze at last and sighed. “Well and so, young Potter. We had quite the lively discussion over the relevant laws and statutes and have concluded that the appropriate punishment for you will be two years in Azkaban.”
Harry was an invert. It made no sense – he loved Ginny, had loved her desperately in the beginning though it had since faded to a pleasurable sense of companionship. She understood him. She was beautiful. And yet, since she had begun to bear his children, he had sought the joys of the marital bed less and less frequently. He had been frustrated with himself and at the growing distance between them, not understanding where it had come from and now he could remember only the relief he had felt during their courtship, the joy of knowing that he was to be part of her family and create their own in turn.
Teddy shook his head. "Sorry, Uncle Harry, I don't remember receiving it – how rude of me not to reply!"
Draco kept looking at him as he licked the hand Harry was not holding and reached to stroke himself to completion as Harry watched, dumb. It took him mere moments and then his body was spasming and arching, clasping at Harry's who could hardly bear the new onslaught of sensation and cried out again with the shock of renewed pleasure on his over-sensitised flesh.
Draco stood alone. "You have never managed to love me, Father, and now at last I give up trying to make you."
Lucius got to make his opening remarks first. He stood slowly, his catlike grace reminding Harry of Draco so strongly that he had to close his eyes against it for a moment. “Wizards and witches of the Wizengamot,” he began. “The case I will make here today is quite simple. Harry Potter solicited other young men into acts of gross indecency. Some may say this is wildly out of character for a man so renowned for his heroics and indeed, it may at first appear so. But Harry Potter used his fame and the rumours of his abilities to both encourage and even extort indecencies, as you will hear from our witnesses.
"Sirius would think it all a great adventure, surely?" Teddy said, raising himself up on his elbows. They were in the garden, enjoying the sunlight, dressed all in white. Teddy never liked formal clothes and his straw hat had already been discarded.
He had been awake but in a kind of trance, deep inside his own thoughts and pain when the call came: "Potter! You've a visitor."
Lucius frowned but it seemed as though he would accept the gentle rebuke, until Draco muttered, "It would make it so much easier to disinherit me if you'd had that spare."
The boy tilted his head to one side. "For a discerning customer, we have certain choice images that might not be appropriate for just anyone, if you take my meaning."
Draco had been slowly relaxing into his chair but all at once the tension leapt back into his frame. "She is well, thank you my lord," Harry said.
"Remus didn't know what had happened at first," Sirius went on.  "He was frantic but he didn't know what avenue to follow. He was certain I was not dead but could not locate me – he told me once he had never been that afraid in his life."
Remus's face filled with regret. "I cared deeply for her," he said. "I left her because I was selfish. I had committed the act, I had made a decision and now I feared to face the consequences."
"She is no longer able to be," Hermione said. "She is a mother now, she cannot engage in Quidditch games with the same recklessness."
Harry could hardly say that he was surprised to discover that Nott, too, was like them. He had already had unarticulated suspicions about Zabini. It made sense that people with any such secret in common would band together. Who else could understand?
“It means they are prepared to make some exceptions for you, which we can definitely use to advantage,” she explained to Harry on one of their regular meetings. Harry would be taken from his cell to another, where he spoke with Hermione across a table. His cell was often in disarray when he returned having been either searched or cleaned, he wasn’t sure which.
Harry might have felt worse about Ginny's disappointment had he not been anxious to return to town and to Draco.
Harry's arms gave out at last and he collapsed, clinging to Draco whose body still shook, his panting breath hot on Harry's cheek.
Teddy looked at him then, his face very near. Harry pulled his hand away, pretending that he had not felt a sudden rush of heat.
Harry flushed again as a boy he could only assume was Kirke stepped forward with a sly smile. Another titter ran around the room. Harry felt himself flush.
With his hand covered in his own come, Draco brought it to Harry's face, painting a line along his cheekbone. "You understand now?"
There was only one other door, with six different shapes carved out of the centre. Draco eyed the plum, and inserted it into the corresponding slot. The door opened at once, sliding back to reveal a room in the Moroccan style, covered in low sofas and ornate rugs.
“That was the first shock of the evening,” he said. The hangover had largely abated but Harry found himself ravenous. He could hardly go to breakfast looking as he did, though; nor could they discuss such a delicate subject where there was an opportunity of being heard.
With that in his thoughts and Draco in his arms it was impossible to say anything other than, "I will, if you ask it. But Draco, are you sure this is a good idea?"
At ten minutes before nine o'clock, Harry adjusted the gas lamps to a lower level, to set a pleasing glow to the room. He smiled to himself and sat on the living area's couch, his robe discarded to reveal his shirt and waistcoat.
Playing host here in Harry’s space was not exactly helping. Harry gritted out, “Would you please give us a moment, Malfoy?”
Albus’s father shakes his head at her. “Ginny.” Albus knows there’s a warning in his tone, but he couldn’t care less.
Harry accompanies James to the familiar, seventh-years’ dormitory – which is in quite a mess, and definitely had not been that bad during Harry’s time, he notes – and he watches as James walks up to his trunk, situated at the foot of the middle bed on the left side of the room.
– and that is really the only term for the bloke, Harry thinks; a bloke who is in his early thirties – Mark. Mark is a French Wizarding Genealogist. Harry had to look that up from the Ministry library, since he wasn’t aware wizards had such professions. Apparently, Wizarding Genealogists trace and keep records of a family lineage in the Ministry of Magic Records Room. Only, Mark is employed by the British Ministry of Magic, keeping records of the British wizards and witches who have French ancestry. Harry remains that that is the most boring job he has ever heard of.
Voices carry over to him from the distance. Someone is moving in the corridor, walking closer to him.
Harry nods at the incoming witches and wizards and waits patiently for ten minutes, until all fourteen Aurors he summoned have arrived. A silver otter floats through the back wall before he has a chance to say anything.
Draco gives him a curt nod. “I will analyse her blood for potions and poisons, examine the wound more closely and do some diagnostic spells before I’m ready.”
“Perhaps one of mine could join each house?” Harry asks and glances at the Aurors before giving McGonagall a questioning look.
Harry gives her a nod, “A good idea. Ron could perhaps keep an eye out in Hogsmeade until we get there.” He then pauses as he remembers Ginny. “Ginny. I need to inform her,” Harry says, desperately trying to keep his thoughts together.
Zachary, Julian, Cory and Cecil had all been curious to hear why Albus had landed himself into a detention, astonished that their usually calm and collected friend had lost his temper in the most Gryffindorish way. However, after they had heard that Albus had been brawling with his brother, their initial surprise had diminished somewhat. Albus’s friends know quite well that if there is someone Albus has ever lost his temper at, it is his brother.
He lets out a small huff of annoyance; as if it hadn’t been enough that he went and fell for one of the mindless girls that only seek his company because of his looks, but then James had to cock things up even further.
Before Harry had left the pub in the morning, he had gone to knock on Malfoy’s door. The blonde had looked quite bleary eyed, even though he had obviously been awake long enough to change into his day robes and smooth down his hair. Harry had apologised for what had happened the previous night, told him that it will not happen again, promising to keep himself in check. Malfoy had merely nodded and stared at him blankly, and Harry had bristled inwardly at his indifferent response. Harry had then asked, again, if he could be present during Scorpius’s questioning, which Quinn would be performing once more. Malfoy had agreed and then excused himself, closing the door to Harry’s face.
that someone, a very skilful witch or a wizard, had somehow managed to alter the wards momentarily, and put them back up. However, as the magic would’ve left a trace, and there would’ve been another magical signature, Harry thinks it is highly unlikely to have happened. And in addition, an outsider would’ve likely been seen by one of the hundreds of students.
Albus swallows hard, and looks away from Rose, trying not to think how many times Scorpius has given him the same gesture, and how many times Albus has thought nothing of it.
It is not long until Albus’s mum arrives, giving him a tight hug and telling him he has nothing to worry about. Albus doesn’t know how much his parents have discussed what Albus told his father before breakfast – if anything – but Albus sure as hell is not going to say anything now.
He can only hope it will not affect the inspection in any way. He thinks Malfoy is controlling himself quite well nowadays, but Harry still fears that what happened between them, destroyed the little improvement that Harry thinks has happened to their professional relationship during the past two days.
I lied before. And now…they think someone told me to say you were there,” she says quietly, not looking at Albus.
They briefly go through each of the questionings again, go through the wand inspections, along with every possible oddness Prone has seen in the Marauder’s Map, but Harry feels that there’s nothing new. He tells his Aurors, that most of them will be leaving the school the next morning – all but Fungbury and Berrycloth; who will be stationed in the village, as well as Keir and Quinn; who will be stationed in the school.
Harry gives him an agreeing nod. “That is right,” he says and clears his throat. “We simply need to know everything that happened on the train, to help us find out if there was someone who was involved in Miss Travers’s death,” Harry explains coolly.
McGonagall nods in agreement. “That would make me more at ease, if it is possible in a situation like this.”
Draco then explains the results of the post-mortem-scan that had been performed to Travers’s body. He tells the others, that no other magical signatures had been detected, except her own. The scan confirmed the cause of death; blow to the head, resulting a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury. The scan hadn’t really revealed information they hadn’t been already aware of; the morgue confirmed that the sedative levels were high, and based on the laboratory examination of a sample of Travers’s blood, the sedative was most likely Calming Draught.
The word was so coarse, nothing Harry would ever expect to hear from someone of Draco's class. It aroused him even as it shocked him and he wondered what Draco could read in his face.
Draco sighed. “This seduction was in fact the result of a very complicated scheme. I had to fight off numerous suitors for your favour.”
"That will do very well," Draco said, over emphasising the L sounds which had the effect of making his tongue curve over his front teeth. Harry's face flashed hot and Draco's eyes glittered.
The letter crumpled in his hand. He had left Ginny behind but he could never sever the ties between them. Draco had the right of it. Harry wondered if this was a sign, if now, having indulged his desire he could return, refreshed to his life as it had been.
which the dressmaker had apparently insisted would be hugely popular very soon and Harry suspected that would be the case if Ginny wore it; they were still famous, after all.
Harry hoped to find Sirius at home, but he had given no warning of his coming and he wondered if he would be an imposition even as the door creaked open. Kreacher stood there, his spine curved, his body taut.
living with the scars of Azkaban too deep. I had struggled and avoided but it was only until there was you, a purpose, that I really worked with the healers to overcome it. You spent years with those Muggles monsters because of me, because of my choices. Remus and Tonks lived in a barely stable marriage for years. Arguably it is my fault your parents died.”
A gentle hand on his arm made Harry look up, startled. "Are you determined to alienate all those who care for you?"
"Unnatural," Draco said scornfully. "Perversion, they say. Perversion is all that's worth living for."
Lucius waved the hand holding his cane. “Yes, yes, you undoubtedly hold views on such things, however, the point remains: they are reliant on salaried income. The Wizard Wheezes no doubt fund a great deal of the family lifestyle – trade, indeed – but Weasley Senior relies on his Ministry salary. As does his son in the Minister’s office. Another is an Auror.”
if that will prove it to you. He treats people like we’re nothing because he thinks he’s better than us. I never solicited a man! He came to me!”
Harry acquiesced, and was sent on his way. That afternoon was one of the dullest of Harry's life as he was reintroduced to the goblin responsible for keeping the books on his fortune, Snem. Snem talked him through his holdings in a near-monotone, all the while behaving as though the very idea of explaining himself in this way was insulting, and Harry forced himself to pay attention. It might seem as though the estate ran itself, but there were rents to collect, staff to pay, upkeep to be considered, and Harry had made only one annual tour in the last ten years.
Ginny shifted slightly, holding out her hand to touch their daughter's delicate fingers. "I had some ideas," she whispered. "But now I see her, none of them are quite right. What is your opinion?"
He went to the breakfast room to eat and moved into the hotel foyer thereafter with the intention of taking another walk.
"We can all agree on that point," Lady Longbottom said acidly. "However, as adequate definitions can never be agreed due to the honourable gentleman's continually questioning the bias of healers who make recommendations to this committee, I would suggest that the quandary is of his own making."
His guards were named Fawley and Smith. Neither of them seemed to know how to talk to him. He’d tried to make conversation before but Fawley was awestruck by the Great War Hero and Smith seemed unable to reconcile the charges with the history he knew.
So Harry did, starting with his confusion and desire, through his affair, his certainty that it was love, of a kind stronger and more passionate than any he had known before. The great love of his life, he told her bitterly. “I found that I could not control myself around him – and most times, I did not even care to. I felt free letting all the cares of the world float away.”
Harry swallowed hard. Somehow he knew exactly what Draco was about to ask, why he was suddenly 'Potter' again. His heart sank. "You want me to get you a renter?"
Mindlessly, Harry pushed Draco back onto the dining table. Draco laughed a little. "We'll make something of you yet, Potter!" he said before Harry's teeth closed on his shoulder and he elicited a deep, throaty moan.
But something had held him back and now he was right back where he had been, agonising and impotent. Harry was so sick of himself.
Draco tipped Harry's chin up and studied his face. "You really mean that," he said in a tone of mild surprise. "Don't you."
Harry's whole skin felt skin flushed and damp with sweat as Draco finally broke eye contact to swallow him down to the root. Harry could do nothing but throw back his head with a choked, broken-off cry, his hands opening and closing reflexively before he gave in and buried them in Draco's hair, thrusting into Draco's throat until he was coming. Draco gave a moan of appreciation as the hot flood filled his mouth and Harry opened his eyes again to watch Draco lick him clean, his eyes on Harry's face again, his own hand stroking himself to completion.
Draco rolled his eyes. "He tells me not to be idle but everything which might occupy my mind is deemed unworthy of a Malfoy. I am good with potions, and I have done some research into blending certain exotic ingredients more effectively, but it came to nothing in the end. And so, having failed, I was not permitted to continue."
"Nor I," Harry said with a laugh. "Though in turn I am rather surprised that Hermione is not more involved."
Sirius nodded. He looked so tired, Harry registered. Perhaps this had been weighing on him every bit as heavily as it had been on Harry himself.
Sirius left him and Harry was glad of it. His head was still swimming with the strange things Madam Pomfrey had said – something about water breaking early but labour not beginning, something that had soaked the bed sheets with blood and caused his brave, strong Ginny to scream in agony, something that had probably been caused by the carriage journey she had not wanted to take. Harry slumped backwards against the banister. Ginny had been suffering and she had told him she had been suffering and Harry had ignored her. Harry had resented her.  Harry had gone to a bawd house with a lust for a man spiralling through him while his wife and third child nearly died.
"Absolutely," Narcissa said. "Children are so important to one's happiness. Which is why we're so pleased to celebrate your birthday, Draco dearest."
Harry shuddered slightly as Malfoy stroked his chest with one hand and his hip with the other. Long, deft fingers slid up his cravat to stroke the line of his jaw and Harry couldn't move. Malfoy's hand curled under the bottom of Harry's jacket to slip beneath the waistcoat and caress the soft skin with nothing between them there save the thin cotton of Harry's shirt.
Harry would go alone, stare at the Eagle stone and listen to the local guide tell him of the legends. The Brahn Seer, a local clairvoyant, had made a prophecy about what would happen should the stone fall and Harry found himself almost wishing that it would, that the lovely valley would be destroyed by flooding just so he could go home.
Broken, desperate sounds were pouring from Draco's throat. Normally, Harry loved doing this, but just then it wasn't enough. He tore his mouth away.
Harry thought of the terrible night before, the violence and the passion, the turmoil and the thrill. How far he’d come – or perhaps sunk. But here was where he stood and this was where he would draw the line. Besides, “Would you even want me if I were?”
nothing but stare at the closest living man he had ever had to a father, and wonder what Sirius must think of him now.
That night Harry woke after a mere two hours of sleep, driven to waking by rich, strange dreams. He had been lying next to Ginny in that hotel they had visited after they were married, laughing and touching in the first discovery of the marriage bed. Harry had felt so in love then, so happy. But in the dream he looked up as he ran his hands over his wife's skin to find Malfoy watching from the corner. When his eyes met Harry's he ran his tongue over his lower lip and smiled, contemptuous and arrogant.
Ron and Hermione stayed for four days. Most of Hermione's time was spent with Ginny, whom Ron had visited briefly. Despite the affection between brother and sister, Ron was not terribly good with women at times like these and was extremely relieved to leave Ginny to his wife and spend the days in the drawing room with Harry. Dinner each evening was a livelier affair than Harry had enjoyed for many weeks, and that evening Ginny even managed a glimmer of her old vivacity.
He could go no further down this road. He could tell himself that he had never seriously considered supporting Lucius but he would always know there had been a moment, more than one, in which he had all but resigned himself to it as an inevitability.
Lucius’s face twisted and he looked at Harry with pure hatred in his eyes. “Very well,” he spat. “Very well. I would like to enter this into evidence.”
"I know we spoke only this morning Harry," Remus said, "but I hoped you would join me for luncheon."
It shouldn’t have mattered, not after everything. But Blaise had shown it to him to sew discord – why? To hurt him, or Draco? Or to warn him? As though further warnings were necessary.
Harry flinched from that a little; Ron didn't notice, intent on staring at his brothers' mulled wine glasses.
Harry's cock had been soft but at this it began to harden again, and became full almost at once when Draco looked up at him with heavy-lidded eyes and pressed his lips to it. Harry groaned as Draco first licked the tip: the sound seemed to electrify Draco, who opened his mouth and took Harry in deep. The tip of his cock was against the palate of Draco's mouth, his tongue flattened beneath and Draco pulled back slightly only to surge forward with more determination. Harry could not keep silent at this; his breathing increased and he began to grunt as Draco continued to look at him and suck on his phallus.
Draco had, of course, considered that it might be far simpler to kill himself rather than go through all of this for the chance of bringing Harry back. Life, after all, was far from infinite and they had both lived through the consequences of one man trying to make it so.
Harry's eyebrows raised themselves. "I've heard many good things about her, to be certain, but she is still young, as you say."
"You loved her," Hermione said, perhaps trying to remind him. "But it is not just Ginny you have cut off, you know. You have not made time for Ron and I, nor have you visited Molly and Arthur here."
All three stood and bowed. Lucius exited on one side of the courtroom, Harry and Hermione to another followed by the ubiquitous guards.
Harry thought himself unnoticed until, during a particularly lovely aria, Malfoy shifted in his seat and looked over at him. That ever-present smirk was on his lips and he raised his eyebrow just enough that Harry registered the change.
Draco arrived promptly, a rare occurrence indeed. He smirked at Kreacher and moved to kiss Harry the moment he saw him, uncaring of the servant's eyes.
Malfoy flinched away as though Harry had tried to strike him. "Merlin's beard, you really are here." He looked a little nauseous at the realisation, and took a step back from Harry. "Why?"
"Oh! No, do not hide your face from me," Draco said, reaching out to tip Harry's face back up. "I would see you."
On his return to the hotel, he lingered in the outer room and forced himself to think through everything that had happened in the last month: he had been blackmailed, Draco had been first violent, then withdrawn and now all but silent, Lucius had threatened him and carried out the threats… It was too much.
Once Malfoy had Harry's upper half naked at last he slid his hands over Harry's shoulders, down his back. Harry moved closer, pressing the length of his body against Malfoy's for the first time.
Harry frowns at Ginny, and then stares at both Albus and Quinn in bewilderment, wondering, what in Merlin is going on, knowing, that there is possibly no way either of the boys could have been able to lie under Veritaserum.
“What on earth are you wearing?” Draco asks before he can stop himself, as he stares at Potter’s attire; a pair of loose trousers and a hoodie – hardly something one wears outside during the winter.
“Malfoy,” Harry says, surprised to see the man still there. Harry blinks at him. “You’re still here.”
Albus curses inwardly, hating himself a little for being so jealous, for feeling so betrayed, that he has become a shitty friend to Scorpius. He forces all the miserable and confusing thoughts into the darkest corner of his mind, wills himself to stay blank before he faces the greyness of Scorpius’s gaze.
he had done all the necessary detection spells to make sure the train was indeed empty and trap-free, before he approached the scene.
James straightens up, and then turns, watching Harry with a hesitant look. “I’m sorry, dad,” is what James has decided to start with, and Harry groans inwardly, already knowing it is nothing good.
“So, you think one of us did it, then?” James asks, narrowing his eyes at their father, looking somewhat offended.
Their group is completed when Zachary sits down on Cory’s other side. They quickly start exchanging their holiday stories, and Albus tells the others about their Christmas.
Albus lets out a weary sigh, feeling edgy. The bloody waiting is killing him. He needs to see his friend and ask what happened. He needs to talk to his father, so that he can ask if Scorpius is in trouble. He wants to walk up to the Scott sisters and Westen and demand from them if any of them lied to the Aurors, and put Scorpius in this mess in the first place.
But now, his friend is not even pretending to listen to his classmates, and lets his gaze trail over the Great Hall; with worry and annoyance mixing in his features.
James stops in his tracks, and turns around in the middle of the stairs. “Hey Al,” he says easily. “What’s up?”
As Keir starts to summarise his interviews; the Head Girl and six Prefects – including two more of Potter’s nieces – Draco is somewhat amazed Potter hasn’t brought up the book yet, as it does concern one of his nieces. He watches Potter carefully as Keir goes through the information he received – nearly all of them
“Only hours after her death, there was an unusually high dose of sedatives in Miss Travers’s bloodstream.” Harry explains wearily. “We received a confirmation later, that the potions cabinet at Miss Travers’s home was missing vials of Calming Draught. Three to be exact.”
Lily turns to Harry, and levels him with a serious look, making Harry nearly stumble backwards. She looks so like her mother, looking straight through Harry, in a way that is almost scary. “I knew about you and mum. Before today.”
“Sir,” Parkinson says as soon as Harry is closer to him. The two students give them hesitant looks and slowly take their leave. After they are outside hearing distance, Parkinson continues, “Nothing out of ordinary here. All students under fifteen have been asked to go to their dormitories. Smith is currently with Slughorn, in the middle of his fourth Prefect interview,” Parkinson tells Harry promptly.
Draco hums thoughtfully as he inspects the girl more closely, waving his wand slowly over her frame, performing more diagnostic charms. “Yes, I know.” He doesn’t see Potter, since he has his back on him, but practically hears the way Potter rolls his eyes at him.
Harry is alone, his mind reeling. He knows he can’t think of what is happening between his sons and Scorpius, since he has a murder investigation going on. He knows he needs to focus and make himself ready to question the handful of students still, before he can think of other things.
Rose nods. “I did. I picked up a book from my trunk, and went to bring it to her, to her compartment.”
Quinn nods at him. “Why did it take so long for you to get back at her?” Quinn asks carefully, and glances at Harry. “Albus and Miss Travers did break up at the end of September?”
They both become silent, and Albus kind of regrets what he said, as he glances at Quinn – who looks like he has never been this embarrassed.
They all watch Albus carefully, but Albus merely shrugs. “It was fine. Nothing special. I’ll be back in a bit.” He grunts, and then turns around, disappearing into the hall leading to the dormitories, and finally, stepping into the fifth-year-boys dormitory.
“I dunno…” He mutters, slumping into a chair in front of Moonstone’s desk, feeling like a seventh-year student again.
Harry shakes his head in exasperation, shoves Ron lightly, feeling a bit better. Soon, Hermione and Rose join them, and it is time for Rose’s questioning.
come forward. And questioning everyone who saw Travers yesterday, could take days – there could be hundreds of people who saw even a glimpse of her. Albus starts to fill his plate, still somewhat bothered by the questioning looming ahead and what he already endured with his father.
The woman gives Potter a sharp nod. Draco takes note that everyone else watches the situation intently.
Air leaves Harry’s lungs, and he swallows hard, his head still spinning. He feels relieved that his children are alive, but terrified as well, since someone – a girl from an old Death Eater family was found dead. He knows it could get ugly. “What do we know?” Harry asks simply, gritting his teeth, forcing himself to calm down, and to do his job.
“You organised a party, where you apparently had a dispute with the girl who was possibly killed on your train ride back to school?” Their father continues starkly, his eyes blazing.
lied to me! They went behind my back! Can’t that be enough, dad?!” He yells, storming away from the room.
Malfoy watches back unblinkingly, and after a moment Harry wants to look away from the intense pair of grey eyes – eyes that have been haunting his dreams during his weakest moments. But he forces himself to hold Malfoy’s gaze, forces himself to focus in present. He has a job to do. A possible murder to solve.
What was he talking about with Travers? Albus is willing to bet his Firebolt that it did not concern him the slightest...
have an argument with Miss Travers, possibly around the time of her death. What was that about? And Albus – he
Auror Berrycloth walks in, followed by three Aurors Draco doesn’t know by name; a woman in her forties and two men, who both seem younger than the woman and Berrycloth. They all greet Potter and then eye Draco curiously, before Potter makes the slightly clumsy introductions; Aurors Bones, Smith and Keir.
“Hi, Mr Malfoy,” Albus says politely, nodding at the man who in appearance is almost as much alike with his son, as Albus is with his father.
“You’re gonna be okay, dad, right?” She asks, her gaze on the frozen field, as their walk slows down into a stop.
“Don’t worry about it, Harry.” Hermione says softly, stroking his hair with gentle fingers, allowing Harry to lean his head against her shoulder. “It happened a long time ago. They knew you were having problems for a while, and Ginny asked them not to say anything to you. I believe it wasn’t discussed afterwards, and certainly not after Ginny started dating Mark.”
Harry looks at Ginny, who seems somewhat hurt by Albus’s rejection. Harry wants to give her a smile, to assure her that their son will be all right, but how can he, if he’s not sure of it himself. Because what Harry sees now, with Albus sitting there, facing away from his parents, his back in a tight curve, breathing unsteadily against his hands, well, Harry thinks that Albus might think of Scorpius as more than a friend, after all.
Scorpius’s father looks at Albus’s mother. “Potter,” he says, his voice blank and face expressionless. He then turns to his son, his features softer. “Let’s go. I’ll take you to your common room.”
He doesn’t move an inch, Harry notes and swallows hard. “Kissing you,” He murmurs, moving himself closer.
Both Scorpius and Albus watch carefully Harry’s every move. Harry cannot confirm it, he knows, since the information cannot be passed on from the Head Auror to his son and friends – it needs to come from the Headmistress, or from the Heads of House.
“Not really. She dated my brother a while back, and dumped him in front of everyone after getting what she wanted,” James says indifferently.
So, this is the deal...This story will be told from Harry's, Draco's and Albus's pov (yeah, I know...couldn't just leave it to two? :D).
Harry sighs inwardly. He hates not knowing what he is up against. “We don’t know yet. Keep your head down and assume the worst,” he says with a grim smile.
Harry chews the inside of his cheek. “But it might,” he says slowly, and then lets out a weary sigh.
Albus doesn’t spare a glance at the three Hufflepuffs, and instead makes his way towards Scorpius’s father, making Scorpius follow him, since there is no way the blonde Slytherin would go to stand with the Scotts and Westen – or alone.
Moonstone hums, looking thoughtful. “Not…outstanding, but good enough. Her grades were decent, and had she kept those up during her final year, she probably wouldn’t have had any problems receiving the entry-level position in the Ministry she was aiming for.”
Albus watches his brother silently for a moment. “Does Scorpius know that?” He finally asks, feeling the odd sensation gripping his chest again. He thinks it might be a form of protectiveness towards his best friend. Yes, that must be it, Albus decides, as he lifts his brows at James.
Zachary gives his friends an indifferent shrug. “I could hardly miss it,” he says airily, his eyes glinting slyly, “…not with Thomas holding it so preciously up…”
Harry could barely contain himself as he wrote a letter, impersonal as one might direct to any acquaintance, advising Draco of his return to London and inviting him to dine that night at Grimmauld Place, as Sirius was away and Harry would want for company. It had been too long and though Hedwig hooted somewhat reproachfully at him, Harry sent her off to deliver the message.
Draco continued not to speak for the rest of the day. After they returned to their shared suite, he went to lie down and simply stayed there. He would not respond when Harry spoke to him, nor was he stirred by offers of food or alcohol.
"What would you like to do this evening?" Harry said, trying to make up for his departure. "Anything at all."
"Master Draco sent me," Goyle said as Kreacher muttered his way back to the kitchens. "I’ve got your owl, just let him go a minute ago. He says not to send him owls, it draws too much attention."
Ginny opened her mouth to say something but Lucius got there first. "I believe you are acquainted with my son, Draco."
Harry exhaled. "Do you know I have been so troubled of late that I have barely given the matter any thought for weeks?"
Harry tried to imagine himself, all in white, in a room with Lord and Lady Malfoy and their ilk, all the purebloods raising their eyebrows at his half-blood self. So many people with such vile beliefs, all in a room to reassure one another that the world hadn't changed at all. A networking opportunity that some would give their teeth for, to be certain, but a prospect that filled Harry with dread.
The huge white marquee had been beautifully decorated. Delicate golden chairs formed clusters around the refreshment tables while gardenias hung from the poles keeping the structure upright, filling the air with rich, sweet scent. Guests would enter to the sight of the whole Potter family, plus Sirius as honorary patriarch and host, and proceed down to where the festivities might begin.
, he realised even as he said it, just as he had known he wanted Malfoy before he had been able to accept it. He had known where he was and he had not wanted to face it.
Kreacher bowed again; like the muttering it was a habit they had never quite managed to break him of. "Yes, Master Potter."
“Pardon me, sir, but… Sometimes the bedsheets were stained in peculiar ways and it became necessary for me to call the attention of the laundress to the matter.”
“You already chose love over duty and denying it is wasting time! Do you not remember the axiom that discretion is the better part of valour? Of course you don’t, you’re a bloody Gryffindor,” Blaise answered himself. “Potter, you have raised the ire of one of the highest in the land. The Sacred Twenty-Eight will all support Lucius because they cannot afford to have any of the lines go extinct: Draco must marry and produce an heir. It is his fate no matter how he chafes against it and you are in the way. If you let this go on it will be a death knell for all of us.”
“It is proof positive of Mr Potter’s nature, and I ask that the court see it. I had hoped to avoid this as it will hurt someone dear to me, but I see now that without it, no action can be taken.”
But on this night, Harry was already overwrought and furious and frightened. The previous day’s image of a duel with Lucius Malfoy shot into his mind and without another thought Harry pulled his wand from his sleeve. How simple to be merely a man with a wand in one’s hand.
Harry swallowed hard and turned his face away, forcing himself to do something other than drink in the angles of Draco's face, tired and drawn but still achingly precious. "I should return to my family," he said. "I should go and never look for you again, never touch you again."
"She's been good as gold," Hermione said, smiling at her husband in a brittle way that did nothing to hide her discomfort; other than her teenage infatuation with him, Hermione had never hidden much from Ron.
“Well said, Draco,” said a voice from behind Harry, who closed his eyes against the inevitable. Naturally, Lucius would see fit to interrupt their lunch.
He wanted everything all at once, couldn’t separate it all out. Wanted Potter to touch him everywhere. Sounds were pouring out of his mouth, moans and grunts that would have embarrassed him, but they were evoking a whine from Potter, who gasped and grabbed Draco’s head, pulling their mouth back into alignment until he could kiss him utterly insensate.
It was so far from what he had expected her to say that Harry almost started. "What a marvellous idea!" he said. Ginny listened to the matches on the wizarding wireless but they had not been to a game together in years. Perhaps this was a sign that she felt better able to ask him for what she needed now. Perhaps they could both be themselves. "I will see if there will be space in the box tonight."
The words curled around Harry in unmistakable invitation, the heat of Malfoy's breath on his face turning Harry hot all over. He looked up to see gleaming grey eyes, challenging and defiant, daring him to action.
“Do shut up, Pans,” Draco said, thinking quickly. It was nine in the morning, and a Thursday. Potter would definitely be in his office until around five.  Assuming that none of the other three would be well enough informed to go down there during working hours, he should have enough time to turn each of them in a different direction and claim Potter for his own before any of them realised what had happened.
Harry had faced death and hiding and torture and torment but all of that had been for a discernible greater good. What was this all for? The sake of a man who barely looked his way any more?
"It is my home, elf, that is hardly necessary," Lucius snapped. He took in the scene before him: Harry and Draco sitting next to one another at a small round table, Harry tracing the lines of the marquetry with his fingers. "I realise I instructed you to befriend Harry Potter, Draco, but you appear to have taken that instruction more to heart than I could have anticipated."
"All right," Harry responded softly. Ron stood there, solid as a rock, as he ever had been, Harry's best friend.
When they were finally called back through, Harry felt as though his every nerve had been shredded. Hermione looked no better.
Harry took this in for a moment. “I do not like that you tried to deceive me. But I shall think on what you said.”
No one spoke for a while until Narcissa shifted in her chair and offered, "At one time, Draco was taking an interest in that young man, is it not so?"
"I will see what I can do," Remus promised. "And perhaps you could come to us some time over the summer?"
"Malfoy," Harry rapped out when it seemed that Malfoy was going to go to his bedroom without registering his presence.
So Malfoy had simply used an enchanted quill to forge Teddy's handwriting. That explained it. Another shameful secret could perhaps remain buried.
Harry let his hands drift up to sit on Draco's wrists as Draco touched him. Then at once he had both those wrists pinned down on the bed above Draco's head for the sheer pleasure of denying them both what they wanted.
Scorpius frowns at him. “What did you do?” He asks mutedly, his eyes flickering to the almost healed cut on Albus’s lip and back to meet Albus’s steely gaze.
Malfoy lets out an irritated huff. “Such a charming wizard you are, Potter, I might even swoon,” He mutters dryly, but at the same time, he brings his hand to squeeze Harry’s cock through the fabric of his robes, so Harry shrugs off the comment, and instead shivers with desire.
Potter finishes the update of the situation, at times murmuring to Granger quiet enough so that Draco doesn’t actually hear what they say.
Albus takes in a deep breath. “Look, dad. It was months ago. I haven’t even talked to her that much since then –” He says, but is interrupted by his father.
“Hermione!” Harry exclaims with surprise. And then, as Harry sees his friend’s expression, dread fills his chest. Something has happened. “Hermione, what is it?” Harry asks hurriedly, taking long, quick steps towards her.
The gargoyle leaps away, revealing the familiar circling stairs Harry hasn’t seen in such a long time. The stairs take them upstairs, and after knocking to the door and hearing a quiet ‘
Draco quickly checks the others; Keir still looks grumpy, Bones’s expression is as blank as it has been since she walked into the room, Smith looks like he has a permanent grimace on his face, and Berrycloth seems like he is somewhat worried.
Hermione worries her lip before she shakes her head. “We don’t know what you are up against. Harry –” She says and gives him a frightened look. “What if –”
“Did you know…?” Malfoy asks then, finally looking at Harry, “Did you know that my son was being bullied during his first year? That people were saying that – that Astoria –” Malfoy’s voice cracks, and he looks away again.
Harry is quiet for a moment, trying to think if any of the students could’ve done it. Of course, it is possible. It
Albus glances around the room, at the four-posters decorated with green silk hangings, and sees no sign of Zabini, but sees Scorpius, slumped on his bed, leaning his head against the headboard, while reading a book.
Quinn nods. “Yes. Mr Malfoy and Miss Travers did have, what Miss Scott – a fifth-year Hufflepuff prefect – did describe as an ‘intense argument’,” Quinn says apologetically. “Scott heard Mr Malfoy pleading Miss Travers not to reveal something as they were speaking in the train corridor. She heard him tell Miss Travers that it would cost him dearly if she did.”
The children had taken it as well as one would, when hearing that their parents were going to split up – even though Harry suspected that both James and Albus already knew. Harry and Ginny had assured James, Albus and Lily that they would still be in their lives, and that their love for their children had not changed. But that their love for each other had changed, into a different sort of love.
Malfoy gives him mild sneer. “Quite fascinating, your kissing methods – I actually can’t feel a thi –”
The Fat Lady gives him a grim nod and opens, giving him permission to enter the Gryffindor common room – his home for seven years.
But he is not there, now. Albus moves his focus to Scorpius and his classmates. “We need to do something,” Albus states, chewing the inside of his cheek, watching his friends with what Scorpius has identified as ‘the reckless Gryffindor gaze’ – and teased Albus mercilessly about it, telling his friend that it must run in the family.
“I understand your worry,” he says, and as one of them looks like they have a couple of things to point out to him, he quickly continues, “I really do – you must know my three children are here as well –” Which seems to make the effect Harry was hoping for, “but, we strongly believe this to be an individual incident, and in order to close this case, we need all witnesses present, and available,” He says with a calming, but authoritative voice. “The Minister has approved this arrangement, and in return, we will do everything in our powers to solve this incident, and have your children’s lives back to normal again.”
Scott takes in a shaky breath. “You wanted to come here, and I – I thought that…after the questioning, what I did…that you’d be grateful…”
He glances over his shoulder to the door in the exact moment as two men appear at the doorframe. The other one lets out a disbelieving scoff.
The fifth-year Ravenclaw had stayed in a compartment with her cousins for most of the train ride. She had met Travers at the luggage department, after which, she had lent her book to her.
The Headmistress stands up and gestures for them to move forward. “Good morning, Mr Malfoy. Mr Potter. Cassius,” She says and flicks her wand to conjure a set of straight-backed chairs – similar to the ones already occupied – in front of her desk. “Please, sit down.”
So, it had begun as a game to Draco. The signs had been there, now that Harry cared to remember. "Isn't he the one…?" Nott had said and Draco had stopped him with "Not finished yet." Harry hadn’t understood at the time but he did now.
