He wished he was in his stark black robes with his slicked-back hair, and not mostly naked with tousled locks and bare feet. It was so much easier to feel confident and sure when he looked the part. Instead, he threw on his snidest smile, rolled his eyes, and responded.
“I—” Draco started. He could do this. He could state his needs to the people he trusted. “I want to ask you a question. It’s personal.”
“Which leads us into the final element of power play. I will admit, this is going to be a large focus of our sessions here.”
“What the fuck, Potter?” Malfoy’s swotty voice filled the line.
Draco couldn’t sleep, though. Instead, he tossed and turned, wondering what the next day of hell would bring.
“So you can have some romantic time!” Luna added cheerfully.
A younger Harry would have instantly assumed that these were from a past lover, one whose memory had somehow infiltrated their home. A jealous rage and an angry floo call would have followed, leading to accusations that were unfounded and unjust.
“We can’t do this,” he said, his eyes on the grass at his feet. So green. He wanted to see green again but shook his head instead.
“It’s not”
Harry took the opportunity to survey the man in front of him. He hadn’t actually
“Yes, Sir,” Harry said, trying not to clench in anticipation. He heard the air shift before feeling the crack of leather spread across his arse. Harry let out a groan, trying to keep his feet planted on the floor so he didn’t risk rutting greedily into his Master’s thighs.
That instead of moaning ‘Malfoy’ in the stall next to him, Harry was there, pressing him into the shower wall, as he tugged and twisted Draco in his calloused palm.
Would I have been able to come to you
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t - “
Potter, who was currently showering, probably naked. Potter, who was moaning his name.
Harry’s forearms throbbed in pain as the blindfold was Vanished away. He blinked into the dim light of the room before answering.
That Harry was gripping him as sturdy and strong as he would the tip of his broom. That he was licking his lips and looking intensely at Draco as he pulled upward along his needy length.
She audibly sighed, then looked at Draco. “Probably like flying.”
“You and your lion pack,” Draco sighed from the other end of the line. “Never could leave each other alone.”
is that Theodore keeps his eyes trained to the floor. This helps in twofold. The first is that he is more focused on my commands, therefore falling a bit easier into his role during play. The second is that his eyes are too captivating for me to stare at for too long, and keep my composure. You have the most gorgeous eyes, don’t you, love?”
“You are in control, but you are not in charge,” Neville said during their last session of the week. “At best, you are planting the seeds, but your partner is watering the earth. You are nurturing the plant together, every stem, every leaf. Your actions affect each other, and how healthy your flower will grow.”
He didn’t give it back right away, though. Instead, Potter stood over Draco’s bed, holding his wand and holding his gaze. “After I died, I told myself I wasn’t going to live in fear ever again.”
Just as he walked through the threshold of steam from the bathroom into his hallway, Draco heard a hard knock at his front door. His towel was secure but his head was still pounding. It was probably just the post dropping off the paper if his bird didn’t do her morning duty, though, so instead of pulling on a shirt, or at least a set of pants, Draco strutted confidently to the door and swung it wide open, expecting no more than a knotted Prophet in his entry.
“I don’t want your girlfriend’s seconds,” was the best Draco could come up with amidst the turmoil of thoughts tumbling through his mind.
Draco shook his head again.
Draco began to tug at his own length in time with Theo, imagining what it would feel like if someone was moving like that on his own length, slipping in and out of warmth and tightness, using his cock to chase their own pleasure.
, he wanted to turn Potter around and press his bare chest to the tree, to get on his knees and open him up with his tongue. He wanted to fill Potter, to fuck him hard, to tug on that ridiculous mess he called hair and then leave him, knotted to the root, waiting, wanting, begging for release. Begging for Draco.
“That’s my good boy,” Neville praised as he lifted his hips, pumping himself eagerly into Theo. “Daddy’s going to come too, fill you up.”
He couldn’t wait to see Draco in nothing but these stockings, laced with green to perfectly match his lover’s eyes.
“N-no,” Draco stuttered, and Harry could see that his fingers were back to gripping silverware.
“You can tell time, mummy must be so proud of you,” Draco smirked.
“You’ll see,” Potter grinned mischievously, holding out his hand again. This time Draco took it, not worrying about the blush rising across his cheeks as he followed Potter down a winding dirt path.
In a panic, Draco slammed the door and grabbed the parchment from the top of his desk. A simple spell illuminated the last lettering scribbled across its pages, and Draco cringed as he read the next part of the letter he had scrolled.
“I have it in my trunk,” he finally said, his voice still sounding giddy. “I’ll give it to you later, roomie.”
“Why, Draco. Why did I safeword in there?”
“Oh, man,” Ron continued in between mouthfuls. “His captain, Alders, apparently hooked up with Malfoy over summer hols.” Ron paused, blessedly chewing and swallowing, before speaking again. “Guess it didn’t work out, and the prick told the whole team what Malfoy’s like in bed.”
His stomach tightened. While he might have seen Ron more recently than he would have preferred (He had made the mistake of popping by Pansy’s flat once, right as they were dropping off the children for babysitting) he hadn’t seen much else of his graduating class. What if he ran into someone who still hated him? Or who had lost someone in the war?
And if he was a good boy, that release might just be granted.
“Not yet.” Draco paused before releasing his grip. “If only we had...oh gosh, what’s it called again? Oh, right. Magic.”
------
One was already on, the steam billowing above the stall, the mirrors already foggy. He huffed, annoyed that he wouldn’t have the space to himself as he wanked and washed, and haphazardly threw his towel onto the sink before tugging off his clothes.
Despite being blindfolded, Harry closed his eyes and let his Master’s words sink in. It had taken so long for them to get to this place. To overcome their past and whittle down the snark and bite until they were left with their raw and open desires, not just for this lifestyle, but for each other.
“Yes,” was all Draco could muster, his eyes cast downward to avoid Neville’s angry glare.
“My mother?” he asked, his shock apparent in his voice.
“Hey!”
They ended up on a grassy knoll with a scattering of fully mature trees. As they walked through a containment charm, Draco was surprised to feel the air shift from a muggy heat to a calming breeze.
Potter let out a noise that almost sounded like a mewl, and Draco finally dipped his fingers under the hem of his green shirt, gripping at his hips while his other hand pushed Potter further against the tree. Potter was caught, tethered between Draco and the hearty bark, and when Draco manoeuvered his hips, he felt the hard neediness of Potter against his thigh.
“Doesn’t like getting spanked?” Neville inferred before shaking his head and folding his list back into his pocket. “It’s important that we are very clear on what we want and need, and what we can give, without judgement.”
“Myself!” Draco said. “Sometimes, when I’m feeling…” he threw his hand up in the air and flicked his wrist, “you know, a bit podgy or pale or...old...” Draco made a face of disgust. “I like to wear something that makes me feel pretty.”
“Yes, fuck, please,” Harry cried. Every touch, every sensation was spreading over him like wildfire, so strong he could barely breathe, but he also felt more alive than ever.
Not when the Dark Lord wanted a piece of me
Draco narrowed his eyes once more at Potter, before lifting his chin and marching out the door.
Draco took a very cold shower, and by the time he was finished, Potter was gone from their room.
“Your owl was clear, your intentions are not.” Malfoy said with a sneer, before turning to order a drink from the bartender.
Draco finds that calling Harry outside of the club suits him just fine.
After class, Draco made his way to Pansy’s front stoop.
Pansy was right. They knew so much about each other; if there was anyone in the world he could ask, that he knew would give him an honest answer, it was Pansy.
Draco smirked before sitting down at her dining room table. He crossed his arms and sighed loudly.
His first instinct was to spit a scathing retort, glare at Longbottom until he backed down. But Draco took a breath instead, reminding himself that Neville was helping him, teaching him. That he was on his side.
His body tingled as he heard Potter’s gasp of awareness right before Draco swallowed it, bringing their lips together into a breathtaking kiss.
“Want to fly?”
He nodded, encouraging her to keep going.
: the sounds you can make when you finger all of the holes!”
Instead, he pressed his chest into Potter’s own. He knew Potter wouldn’t move, wouldn’t back down from a threat, not when it was Draco Malfoy trying to force him into a corner. He wasn’t scared, no. Potter was never scared.
Letter. What letter? Had he written a letter? When would he have had time to touch quill to parchment? He couldn’t remember much of the night before, but surely he’d remember correspondence, especially to his... old nemesis. It would explain the ink stains, though. And the empty perch. And the bottle of scotch that was just slightly (significantly) lower than he expected.
One of Neville’s burly hands made its way to Theo’s backside, and while his cock was filling Theo’s hole completely, Neville began to tease his rim, adding to his pleasure. Draco tightened his grip around his cock even more, as he felt his bollocks tighten in anticipation.
“Think you can redeem yourself for your slip-up last week by pretending to be kind, do you?” Malfoy continued, barely pausing. “I played a shite game and everyone knows it! Coach benched me for the next two weeks, and I don’t need you fucking with my head in the meantime!”
“Thanks for the letter,” Potter said quickly as they crawled into their respective beds. Draco couldn’t even mutter a response before Potter flicked off the light with some silver thing in his hand, rolled over and began to snore.
He could feel the class turn on him, all eyes focused like he had just been scratched by a Hippogriff. Ignoring Longbottom’s death glare, Draco sneered towards the other end of the line.
“Yes,” Draco said through a grimace.
When Draco looked back, Potter’s eyes had diverted to the ground.
“Sub what?”
Neville shrugged. “I do have good ideas occasionally.”
Harry wanted to groan, his cock hard and nestled between his Master’s thighs, but he bit his lip to stop it, not wanting to make any noise and risk his chance at pleasure. Instead, he closed his eyes again, focusing on breathing through his nose as he felt Sir’s hands rubbing up and down his skin.
Draco spent the night tossing and turning, images of Neville’s shop filled with flowers, of the club, shelves filled with toys, of the man, spread and pink-cheeked and moaning.
And maybe picture Potter on his cock again.
“Let’s go to the phones, shall we? You’re on with
“Does…” Draco’s mind rushed with thoughts. He cleared his throat and tried again. “Does that mean, if our greens don’t match up, we should not…” Draco hated that he was questioning this. He hated that he didn’t just know the answer to everything.
Sometimes he’d pull himself off right there, watching the flames dissipate, or he’d wait until he was in the shower, hot water coursing down his skin while his hand pumped along his length. He’d dress, head to work and try not to think of those stockings again.
“How’s that working for you?”
“And I suppose you like being alone?”
“They don’t know you, do they? That their perfect little saviour is a slut for dirty cock.”
, he knew he could go to his Master and ask. He’d be rewarded, most of the time.
Malfoy in months, apart from catching the occasional match in person. Same blond hair, same fierce grey eyes. He looked shorter though. Hunched. As if he was trying to hide in the background, merge into the blur of the crowd.
Draco had never considered himself lucky. Lucky people don’t end up with the Mark on their arm, and scars etched across their chest, and carry a name like Malfoy. So he certainly wouldn’t be lucky enough to find what Neville and Theo had.
“Oh, like you’ve got anything better, Malfoy,” Potter snapped, his green eyes piercing into Draco’s own.
It might not be possible, but Draco pushed those depressing thoughts out of his mind and focused on Neville’s teachings.
“Not sure yet. Stay tuned to
“Great.” Neville gestured encouragingly. “So, Harry, what would you say to praise your Submissive?”
Potter chuckled. “Yes, I’ve heard that.”
“Oh yes, a slight trickle was expected over Devonshire today, perhaps that is what you mean?”
“What does that mean?”
Draco has a breakdown, and a break-through
In fact, teasing Malfoy had become such a tradition on
“Draco, so nice of you to join us!” Pansy gave him a warm smile before facing the rest of the room once more. “Everyone in a circle, let’s play!”
OKAY we are so close to the finale, and I want to just give all of you a big thank you for reading along on this journey!
Even though he was still positioned, his back straight and his arse resting on his heels, Draco could see the slightest tilt of Theo’s body as he leaned into Neville’s touch.
Harry bit his lip. He was kind of thirsty, after talking on the show all day. A drink wouldn’t kill him.
The first swat happened quickly, as did the second and third, and soon Harry could only concentrate on the force, the brisk sting, and the loud clap of noise filling the room. His Master’s hand continued to fly, hard and fast across his bare buttocks, and by the time his ten spankings were distributed, Harry could barely hold back the whines erupting from his throat.
The slaps of his Master’s belt kept raining down on him, one after the other, until pain flared across Harry’s backside, heating his skin until every touch felt like exquisite fire.
“She’s not.” Harry said, taking in a deep breath. “She’s Neville’s actually.”
The wanting was sometimes enough
Like a snitch fluttering just out of grasp
“I’m sorry.”
Draco had followed Potter into the showers, mumbling about studying the next night, no time for parties, but he couldn’t look away from the long expanse of skin above Potter’s knotted towel, the glisten of spunk splattered across his tanned and toned skin. He watched as Potter wandered into the closest shower stall, throwing a wink back at Draco before pulling the curtain taut.
As everyone around him watched, Neville stood and gently flipped Theo so his back was now resting on the soft mattress instead of his chest. Draco could see how swollen Neville’s lips were, how his chest was heaving as he continued to twist and position Theo until his body lay parallel with the bedframe and his head dropped off the edge of the bed.
Draco opened his mouth, ready to apologise for his tardiness and his clothing choices and the empty table in front of them. He braced himself for the shattering of glass, or the splintering of wood exposing his anxiety that was surely to come.
a bit of wandering around a BDSM club. No scenes in this one, but there is talk of toys and safewords. A brief mention of some past trauma with Draco dearest (vanishing cabinet talk)
“What?” Harry blurted. “You’re going to make me wait until Christmas?”
Understanding intentions and motivation was something Draco knew he was skilled at. As a Slytherin, he knew how to be cunning, how to poke, and prod, and manipulate someone's weakness to get what he wanted.
- UPDATE: Hi all! I know, I haven't posted in a few weeks! I am working on the final six so I can make sure they're as great as you deserve them to be. I'll start posting again on Sept 1, and I appreciate all of your patience until then!
“And it feels good?”
Harry released his grip on Draco, and let his eyes wander down his husband’s frame. “Do you mean…” he let his words trail off as he admired Draco’s figure. He looked the same as always, tailored trousers, crisp white button down shirt, tie folded into an Eldridge knot and secured tightly around his neck. “Are you wearing them? Right now?”
“You Slytherins and your self-preservation. If you just ask, you would know.”
“To get away from me,” Draco responded blandly.
“I bet you would,” Ron chuckled. “The heat between you two could burn the whole Network down; I’m surprised you haven’t fucked through the phone yet.”
“And what an impressive four minutes it was,” Harry grinned in response. “Do tell us, how did you break this record?”
“Do you know why I stopped you?”
“Harry,” Neville called out suddenly. Draco’s heart skipped a beat. Now Potter on his knees was something he was eager to imagine. He could feel his cock fattening with even the thought of it.
His Master shifted in his chair, and Harry could hear the light clink of his buckle. “Now ask me for my belt.”
Huge thank you to EvA-Eleanor and Malenkayacherepakha for your consistent cheering and betaing!!! All the hearts, friends!
“Yes, oh goodness, yes.” She gave his hands a squeeze. “I can see her in your eyes. And your skin! I was always jealous of Cissy’s porcelain skin. Do tell her I say hello, won’t you?”
“Sounds pleasurable,” Draco said, lips pursed.
“I searched the kitchen this morning.”
Draco knew his story already, of course. Theo’s father gave his own a run for his Galleons. He’d find Mr. Nott in the study with his own Aunt Bellatrix, plotting and targeting their efforts on pleasing the Dark Lord. They didn’t go as far as actually housing the no-nose git, for Mr. Nott was thrown in Azkaban during their Fifth year, but he probably would have volunteered right along with Lucius.
“Thanks for the drink,” Malfoy said, slamming his glass on the counter. “Now, do kindly fuck off.”
The wall exposed what could have been any ordinary bedroom. Theo sat on a long wooden bench at the edge of what appeared to be quite a comfy bed. His black shirt was unbuttoned, rolled up to the elbows and revealing toned arms Draco had certainly not noticed in school. His chest was defined, soft dips of muscle stretched across his stomach, the tiny buds of his nipples already peaked. Around his neck hung the loose metal chain Draco had glimpsed earlier, and he arched his throat as he leaned his head back.
“Nervous, baby boy?” Longbottom asked, peering down at the man at his feet.
This time she raised an eyebrow.
He couldn’t budge; he felt frozen to the spot as he watched Potter walk slowly towards him, full smile and a twinkle in his eye.
It was perfect, making him feel exactly how he had in his dreams. Empowered. Strong. Confident.
Your hand finally reaching out
“Makes you want to fly, right?” Potter’s face was so close as he continued to whisper, even though the bird was long gone from their tree. His face was flushed, and it reminded Draco of the last time he saw Potter fly, before the war and the scars across his chest. Before everything went to shit.
Another breath. Then
during sex?
(See the end of the chapter for
At his last lesson, Neville spent the majority of the time explaining how different postures and rituals were useful to prepare his Submissive for a scene, and how even a different facial expression or breathing pattern could evoke different emotions of power, authority, and control while in play.
Draco huffed. “Oh yes, it must have been so hard to be so adored.”
“Why?” Neville asked the expected question so gently, his voice full of curiosity instead of judgement. When Draco didn’t answer, he continued. “Does inflicting pain still make you feel uncomfortable?”
Surely it was someone else.
His hands were moving on instinct, Draco’s mind only focused on the sounds of spraying water and Harry’s voice, guttural, desperate. What would he do if he knew Draco was there, so close and desperate as well, as one hand tugged rapidly around his need, the other one finding its way to his bollocks, palming them in a fierce grip.
“She nurtures you, so you can fully bloom,” Draco said, more to himself than anything else.
“It’s not the lack of fanny.”
“What would the Wizarding World think if they knew, hmm Potter? That you were filthy, spending your nights in a kinky, kinky club.” He stared into the soft glint of Potter’s eyes, noting the same far-away expression he had seen in Pansy just that afternoon.
The stockings weren’t in the drawer; they weren’t in the next drawer below, or behind the dresser, or under the bed or in the wardrobe. They weren’t in the bathroom cabinet or between the cushions of the couch or in the spice drawer. And they certainly weren’t in the bookshelf or shoved between his Order of Merlin, First Class award and Draco’s Lead Master of Potions Certificate.
him and his errant magic.
Instead of nodding again in agreement, Theo remained still, his eyes never leaving the concrete.
“Enjoy your morning wank, Potter?” Draco leered as he washed his hands in the sink directly next to his nemesis. “I know I sure did.”
“Doesn’t sound like me.”
“That information will make Zabini happy.”
Quickly Vanishing the evidence, Draco was about to drag himself into a much needed shower when an owl began to peck at his toes.
Everything in play seemed so safe, so consensual that it was putting Draco’s fears at ease. There were so many ways a Submissive could be hurt, but so many more that they could be safe, if Draco focused, if he learned and practiced.
Draco wanted to press the issue, especially because of Longbottom’s horrendous diversion, but was thwarted by birthday wishes.
“You’ve never been on a broom, Pans.”
As if the thought of Draco seeing him never even crossed his daft mind.
Draco could feel each fresh drop of rain running down his cheeks as he continued to hover over Potter. “Were you just scared, Potter? That I’d beat you, be a better Dominant, Neville’s star pupil?” Potter inhaled as the rain started to fall in earnest. “Scared he’d like me better than you?”
Neville nodded in understanding. “My checklist was practically shredded to bits by the time I was done, so many erasure charms it was impossible to see the words at the end.” He pulled out his wand and leaned forward, tapping Draco’s sheet with the tip. Instantly, the parchment was duplicated, a copy appearing in Neville’s hand.
Still, he couldn’t pull his eyes away, or his hand away from his cock as he watched a couple so deeply in love as they made love in front of him. Neville’s hand had found their way from holding Theo’s to teasing his hole, and Draco rubbed the tip of his cock with his thumb to tease himself as well.
Draco felt his cheeks redden. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Goodnight, Malfoy.”
Harry pulled the platter close to himself, out of Ron’s reach. “No food for arseholes who kinkshame.”
Maybe if you hadn’t split me in half
Fuck Potter.
“Noted,” she continued without a pause. “So a Gryffindor thing?”
“Please, Sir, please spank me with your belt,” Harry said in a rush, rolling his hips in his eagerness. He wished he could see it, see his Master’s suspenders and trousers, and his thin black belt with the gold buckle as he folded it in half for Harry’s punishment.
I'm also posting this on Sunday so I can post chapter 24 tomorrow. That way this chap isn't floating out there for too long without its conclusion.
“Oh, honey,” Pansy smirked, “everyone wants to know what we get up to. We had quite an audience. I’m surprised you didn’t see the group.”
The teachers had trouble making eye contact with the three of them as well. Only McGonagall seemed to stomach it, giving Draco a half-smile before giving them new room assignments.
“Why not?”
“That, Draco, is something I’m all too familiar with.”
“And yet my desk is still intact. As is the glass in my picture frames.”
Neville and Draco both nodded in unison as Andy bustled away, chasing after a lanky boy with electric blue hair.
“Not Krum, you daft prick.” Malfoy sighed, and Harry could practically feel the pain through the phone. “You don’t give a shite; why am I even talking to you about this?”
When he looked back into the room, Neville had stood and hooked his trousers over his hips. He pulled his wand out of his pocket and Accioed over a thick blanket, wrapping Theo up in it, before placing a soft, tender kiss on his forehead and leaving the room.
for the Witch who cares what she’s riding
Harry looked at the phones, delight running across his skin as he saw the little light signalling a waiting call. “It looks like we might have some Malfoy fans calling in, so let’s go to the phones!” He pressed the little button, opening the connection. “You’re on with Potter, how are you Pottering on today?”
“Feel pain,” Draco said flatly.
“Whatever, Potter. Goodnight.”
Even twenty years after they left Hogwarts, Draco and Harry could be seen playing pick-up games of Quidditch, chasing the Snitch, and snogging in the fields. He was grateful for every moment that led to that year, no matter how horrible, because it brought them together.
“Was looking for my tie,” Harry said weakly, hoping Draco wouldn’t ask too much more.
Draco and Neville talk more about BDSM, and he gets some introspection from Pansy.
Draco felt his fingers curl into a fist. He hated having to be so raw and so open, especially when they had just shared such a tender moment. “It’s not just a club to me, Potter. It’s a lifestyle that makes me happy, and I can’t force someone to be a part of it if they don’t want to be.”
His hand found its way to Potter’s hip, where it lingered, gripping the soft cotton of his thin shirt. He could feel the warm hardness of Potter’s muscles right below, his hips jutting out, seeking friction as Draco slipped his tongue into Potter’s mouth.
Disappeared with no trace
“So she’s hit you?”
Neville shrugged noncommittally just as Theo walked towards him. A smile broke across Neville’s face as he tugged Theo into a big hug.
Potter slipped his tongue into Draco’s mouth, pleading with Draco to react, to respond. His hand moved from Draco’s cheek to his hip, pulling him close to his body, and Draco couldn’t help it. He melted into the heat, into the touch, and just as he was about to relax into the moment, Potter withdrew.
“And the
“I think our audience would listen to you talk about your latest poo, if I’m being honest,” Lee had chuckled. “They haven’t heard from you since the war. Everyone’s curious what you’ve been up to.”
Theo’s arse clenched tightly as he undulated on Neville’s hard length, his hands reaching up to balance himself on Neville’s firm chest.
“You play beautifully,” Harry said, wincing as he heard the words leave his mouth. “I mean, you’re way better than you were in school.”
Neville shook his head. “That’s true, but you were also sending Harry into subspace in the middle of a crowded classroom.”
Ginny nodded. “I realize now I shouldn’t have outed Malfoy like that.”
“It’s not like you didn’t notice me before. We were practically enemies before Sorting even happened.” Potter’s hair was curled at the nape of his neck, and Draco wondered how they’d look cured around his finger. If they’d bounce back if he tugged.
“Scotch,” Draco responded, sinking in his seat.
Master’s palm met his tender arse again in a breathtaking
“You want this?” Sir asked, adding pressure to his touch. “Me inside of you?”
He does recover, and is much better at the end of the chapter. Neville helps.
“A vibrator?”
Dinner.
“What about it?”
that control. And he couldn’t ask Potter to give up his own control, to force him into an arrangement he didn’t want, didn’t need.
“Now, every Dom is different. Some might want their Subs to stand, others might want a combination where they knot their wrists above their head. Whatever it is, basic positions can be varied and helpful.”
Draco relaxed his hand from Potter’s grip.
“But you marked Impact Play in yellow.”
A thunderous applause to my cheerleader, Thunder_of_Dragons on this. And all my love to EvA and Malenkayacherepakha for your betaness and amazing input to this story. I would have not been able to write this chapter without you.
BIG thanks to Thunder_of_Dragons and Eva_Eleanor who alphaed and betaed this chap (and this story, can you all believe its almost over???), and Malenkayacherepakha who britpicked (incredible friend, you are). Also thanks to TheeStarryknight for betaing and squeeing all over these chapters for me!
He woke up hard and shaking. At some point during the night, he must have shucked his joggers, choosing instead to passively pull his cock out from their cotton confines and into the silk of his palm. His hand was already tugging along his length, and, dropping his head back into the safety of his pillows, Draco muttered a spell to lubricate the path of pleasure.
, and who played with
“I do actually,” he started, cocking his head slightly to the left. He was surprised no one had stopped him yet, especially Longbottom who was surely brooding right over his shoulder.
Then Draco blamed it on the smell of Potter’s shampoo. It reminded him of home, the smell of citrus and honeysuckle. Draco’s own lavender-scented potions had muddled his nose from years of use, and he hardly smelled anything as he poured it into his palm and worked it into his hair. But Potter’s sharp floral and lime always made their way to Draco, cutting through the spray of water and other surrounding smells.
“I don’t want any Weasleys, Merlin’s beard.”
Once Neville left, Pansy patted the space next to her on the couch. “Now, what’s your Scarhead problem?” she asked with a grin.
Yet we circled each other
It felt softer than he had expected. The skin surrounding the lightning bolt felt so soft instead of calloused, like the edges of his own scars inflicted by Sectumsempra. It made something in him snap; a bitterness that he hadn’t expected, knowing that Potter’s branding was even better than Draco’s own.
And yet, he found himself, trembling hands, whispering
“Because we can-”
Potter’s hand felt loose in his own, and Draco became distinctly aware that Potter was backing away, his face fully red and his eyes staring at anything but Draco’s own, and what if he thought that — no, Draco couldn’t let him think that this wasn’t what he wanted.
“Aren’t you going to follow?” Draco asked. His drink was almost empty, and he wondered if he should order another one.
Draco and Harry continue their date.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco grinned, before taking his hand and lifting it over his head, pushing until his body pushed up against the rough bark of the tree. He leaned forward, finally,
If just one thing had been different,
“Thanks for your wand, by the way.”
“Yeah, erm, fine.” Harry nodded his head more times than was necessary, before leaning forward and kissing Draco on the lips. “Have fun at work, yeah?”
“We hate each other.”
I started this story as a challenge to myself, to see if I could write 50k. I now know I can (whew) but I also know that it's not my preference. I get burned out around the 15k mark. This is all to say, most of the next parts of this fic will be shorter ficlets, mostly PWP w feelings. Thank you for reading along, and I hope you continue to do so.
Okay. I want to preface the next few chapters. There's a lot of hot steaminess, and there's a lot of unsafe practices. Moreso in the next chapter, but please note that chap 22-23 are full of things Daddy Dom Neville Longbottom would not be thrilled with. If you want to find those items out before reading, please skip to the end notes. If not, read ahead.
“Oh, fuck, gonna come all over your gorgeous face, Malfoy,” Harry cried, and Draco finally let himself crest, coming hard and fast, coating his chest with drips of his pleasure.
“Are you going to go?”
“You’d...you want to play Quidditch with me?”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief when he heard the Floo crackle and simmer, and immediately ripped the drawer from its pulls and emptied it on the floor.
How would it feel to have that control, to be able to set his own pace and have someone open up to him like that? Would he ever feel so comfortable with someone else to ask for such a sacrifice? Or would he have to find both: someone he loved and someone that categorized themselves as a Submissive to unveil this type of beautiful relationship for himself?
But Potter had looked at him as well. Which meant…
“And that’s all the time we have today thanks for joining tune in next time, bye!” Harry rushed his exit before hissing into the mic. “What the fuck is wrong with you? I was being nice!”
He heard the pulse of the shower turn off, the sound of cotton dragging over wet skin. The sound of a shower curtain being yanked backward as Harry made his way to the sinks.
Draco coughed awkwardly.
Before sitting, Draco pulled a neatly folded parchment from his pocket. “I filled this out, but if I could get a fresh one, I’d like to clean it up.”
Severus didn't know what to say nor feel. He was shocked that James Potter was able to apologize to him. Then he heard Lily's voice,
With bated breath, Draco hoped.
As they approached the Great Hall, they found Harry and Neville waiting for them both.
Narcissa Malfoy loved hearing her son talk. She loved hearing his thoughts, no matter how heretical they were. She loved how his howlite eyes sparkle with life, how he looked for all the angles and the in-betweens of everything.
The man spoke again, "Is that so? Then why is it that I can feel someone in that cupboard? Open it."
Harry went back inside to cook lunch when Dudley came home. He knew to make his favorites. Dudley would throw a tantrum if his favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich were not at the table along with his favorite glass of chocolate milk. He made Aunt Petunia's favorite salad, crisp vegetables, and ripe tomatoes from her garden. He also started dinner for the Dursely's. Pasta with a side of salad, along with corn and bread. These were the food Harry knew he would never be able to eat. When Harry finished, Aunt Petunia ushered him into his cupboard.
The man wore all black. He had a long face as well as long hair. His nose seemed crooked. His face seemed to be in a frown. He looked upset. Harry didn't like that fact and he quickly shifted his eyes down.
Harry looked around his "home" a small, dim place, with a single light bulb for a light and a small, dirty mattress as his bed. A small bucket on the front of his bed was his toilet. Cobwebs with small spiders were everywhere, yet Harry didn't mind their presence. This was his "home". Not what out there beyond his cupboard. His uncle made sure he would remember that.
Harry thought and felt bad for Mr. Snape. The man looked like he was ready to faint.
"I want to go into Hufflepuff. I know that people want me in Gryffindor, but it just doesn't feel right, being a Gryffindor." Both Hermione and Neville looked at Harry with sympathy on their faces.
It was Draco Lucius Malfoy's first goal.
"Yes, I can. Smart boy. Now, I can see how much you wish to be in Ravenclaw. Why is that?" Draco knew he had to justify himself - less the Sorting Hat puts him in Slytherin. He held in a shudder.
He looked at the peacocks once more. He knew how beautiful, elegant, and how graceful they were. Draco also knew how vicious they could be. He had seen them attacking a house elf that was supposed to kill it. Yes, they were magnificent, but they were deadly. That would be the Malfoy Draco would strive to be. To be elegant on the outside, but aim for the kill when ready. To be like the white peacocks he hated. To be the Malfoy
"I understand, I want to be Gryffindor like my parents, but my Gran doesn't think I'll fit in." Their sympathetic faces went from Harry to Neville. Draco felt bad for the boy. Expectations, most of the time, ruin children. So he, as a child of many expectations spoke up.
But, when Mr. Snape was in a good mood, Harry loved to spend time with him. Mr. Snape allowed Harry to watch him brew potions and even let Harry help with brewing them. Sometimes, Mr. Snape would tell him stories of his mother. Once Harry asked about his father and Mr. Snape made an ugly face at the question, so Harry never bought it up again. Harry wondered why Mr. Snape made such a face, but Harry wouldn't push the man. Other times, Mr. Snape would give him lectures and talks about what Hogwarts would be like and how Harry should perform in the school.
So that's that ^^. I want to apologize for not updating. I hit a major writing block for this one and didn't have that much motivation to write. I'm sorry for letting you guys down TT-TT. I've been having family problems along with my writer's block too, but I managed to write this chapter for you all. I hope you enjoy it!
But most of all Draco Lucius Malfoy loved the white peacocks that lived on the manor's grounds. Oh, those white, pristine, beautiful peacocks. They were everything a Malfoy was to be, his father had told him once.
"Come, we should go to Madam Malkin's to get your school robes. That usually takes the longest." Harry nodded and released Mr. Snape from his hug. He was excited to get school robes.
"Thanks, Mr. Diggory!" Cedric seemed confused at first, but then he realized the reason as to why Harry addressed him through last name.
Now, this became Draco's greatest dream.
"Morning, Hermione. What are you reading?" Hermione's head snapped to Draco's, and she grinned.
Harry awoke to feel excited and nervous. It made his stomach churn at the thought of finally going out for the first time. He contemplated lying to Mr. Snape that he wasn't feeling well so he wouldn't have to go; unfortunately, he had to. And so, Harry rose from his bed, fixing it, and headed towards the loo.
"I will ask one more time, where is Harry Potter?" By then he heard Aunt Petunia's swift steps walking to the door. He wondered who this man was to make Aunt Petunia go to the door. Most of the time people left when they encountered his angry Uncle. Harry didn't hear what happened next sadly. He was too busy pondering and was still ecstatic of having a name.
"That will be; 2 galleons and 15 sickles, Mr. Malfoy." Lucius barely spared the cashier a glance and took the money needed to pay. Once he received the books, he shrunk them and put them into his cloak's pocket.
"We must. School begins in one week and you need to go out and meet people. I plan to disguise us with a glamor so that we won't be crowded with people who will recognize you." Harry sighed in relief. He didn't want people flocking towards him at all. Harry hated the attention and hated being the Boy-Who-Lived. He didn't even remember beating the Dark Lord so how can he be called a hero? Harry didn't understand.
Draco knew that he would have to act as the perfect pureblood heir and he hated it. He hated that he would have strut and act like a prejudiced arse too many people. Then again, that's what they expect from a Malfoy. But still, Draco hated it. He wanted to be like the white peacocks, admirable to everyone but deadly to those who provoke it. He didn't want people to fear or even hate him because of his name. More so, due to what his father had done in the War.
"I see. Well, then first things first. Griphook! Take Mr. Potter and Mr. Snape into the Will Room. The wills of one Lily Potter and James Potter have not been read." Behind the head goblin, another showed up,
Severus Snape waited in the Great Hall. He was anxious as to where Harry and his godson would be. He knew that they would defy all expectations set amongst them by the British Wizarding World. Severus was excited to see the change that would come fort because of them.
"Hermione! Wait up!" Draco yelled as he and Harry ran to catch up to the girl.
Harry found himself amazed. All of a sudden Mr. Snape pulled out an object that looked similar to a twig and changed Dudley's hand-me-downs into clothes that are clean and seem like they fit him!
Severus' world came crashing down.
"Draco? I am finished. You are dismissed. It is not worth talking to a boy who does not wish to listen." Draco felt his ears flush, but he muttered an apology to his father and quickly went back to the library. He wanted to see if there were books on Harry Potter. How he wanted to know more about the boy.
Hermione and Draco went back to their Housemates, who stood waiting for them with various expressions on their faces. Neither Hermione nor Draco cared for what they thought. House divisions will never break their friendship, and that is how it will be for the rest of their lives.
"Mother, Father, good morning." Both his parents accepted his greeting by inclining their heads. The Malfoys soon went outside their mansion and apparated to King's Cross Station, where they would wait for his godfather and Harry to arrive. Draco knew that his godfather couldn't be seen unless he wanted to ruin his reputation. But his godfather would never do that; so he would drop off Harry at the Muggle side of Platform 9 3/4, and Harry would meet the Malfoys on the other side.
It was already 9:15 and Draco and his family had just come to the Alley. Draco tried to find Flourish and Blotts over the many heads of witches and wizards taller than him. Draco sulked as he couldn't see, his height being short compared to those who were at the Alley. Draco's hand was holding his father's cloak. He wasn't allowed to clench his father nor his mother's hand, for it was improper for a pureblood like him. Draco trailed behind his parents, his eyes taking all the sights around him. He listened to the children and their parents, happy and yelling. Deep down, Draco wished that his family could be like that. He knew that it would never happen. As purebloods, they weren't able to as pureblood customs denied them this. But Draco could still hope and dream, even if they would never come true.
This is the first memory that Harry will ever remember.
"You never told the boy his name. So I am right to assume that he knows nothing." That same soft tone now sounded tense, Harry knew this man was trying to be angry. Harry shuffled his feet nervously. The man still kept his eyes on Harry. It was true though. Harry knew nothing, he was never allowed to ask questions nor go to school. The man's eyes narrowed even further.
Harry was dreading what Mr. Snape would give them. He hoped that the work wouldn't be too much either.
"In the event of our deaths, we wish for you to know that we changed our Secret Keeper. We knew that many people would think that Sirius was the Secret Keeper, but it was a lie, a farse. Peter, our good friend was our Secret Keeper. Dumbledore knew and cast the spell. So please, if we die, let them know that it was Peter, our Secret Keeper."
Does anybody know how to contact the other prefects and tell them that we have their missing housemates?" Everybody shook their heads.
See you all in the next chapter!
Severus ate as he watched the boy. It was then he decided that he will take care of the boy and protest if anyone would say otherwise. Lily's son does not deserve to be raised by selfish witches and wizards. To be raised and become James Potter. Severus scowled at his spoon. He vowed that as long as lived, Harry James Potter will never be like his father.
"What are you four doing? It's breakfast so let's eat." With a laugh, Draco dug into his food, grateful that he somewhat has another friend. Although it would be nice to have a friend that isn't a Hufflepuff.
"Yes, I do. But this must go to the Ministry first correct?" Griphook nodded in response whereas Harry, well the boy looked at him with a new set of tears in Lily's eyes. Suddenly, Harry launched off his chair and hugged Severus as if he were to disappear at any moment.
Draco's father decided to do the unshrinking.
"I'm glad to know you all. Harry was telling us about you three, and I wanted to see it for myself. Take care of Harry alright?" Cedric gave them a soft smile, and Draco was glad that the boy did not have anything against him.
Severus Snape took Harry James Potter into Gringotts. They had come at 8:30 and there were barely any people in Diagon Alley, a fact which greatly relieved Severus. Severus looked down at his... ward. Yes, ward was an appropriate method term to call Harry. Harry looked nervous and frightened. Severus felt the need to comfort his ward.
Harry slept with a happy smile on his face. Perhaps, Halloween wasn't so bad.
"I'll file your request to adopt Harry Potter and send a copy of the will to the Ministry." Severus was thankful. The last week of August was already so busy, him having to go to the Ministry to formally adopt Harry made the week more stressful. Severus inclined his head in thanks while his arms were wrapped around Harry's lithe frame.
Harry will be a fierce but loving Hufflepuff. After all, they are very loyal folks who protect and love those they call theirs.
"HOLY CRICKET! I didn't realize it! I read all about you though..." Harry gave a weak chuckle at Hermione.
- The-Songbird-Who-Wrote
The Potions Classroom was a room with dim light, but enough light to read the blackboard in front of the class. There were cauldrons in front of each stool. The front of the classroom held a podium, and behind it were shelves full of potion ingredients. The smell was musky, but not musky enough to make Harry uncomfortable. In all, Harry truly liked the Potions classroom. Sadly, the tables were split into two, meaning that Harry, Hermione, and Draco were to split up. Harry looked at his two friends and sighed.
Harry realized that some of the screams were his own. Suddenly a big boom resounded in the Great Hall.
See you all soon!
"This will now be your room, Harry. You are responsible to keep it clean and tidy." Harry was shocked. His room. A room. He never had a room before. Rooms were only for normal people and not for freaks like him. But Harry remembered that Mr. Snape did not think of him as a freak. But Mr. Snape did something that wasn't normal too, so did that mean Mr. Snape was a freak?
“Absolutely not!”
Eighth year turned out to be not all bad. He finally found all of his classes and found his way under his roommate’s sheets. Being on Potter, erm, Harry’s arm had really helped his other schoolmates soften towards him and the other Slytherins. Plus, they were able to play quite a bit of Quidditch in between all of the official school matches.
“But surely-”
Harry heard his Master sit in the wooden chair right behind him. Harry could practically picture him there, trousered legs spread, a crisp white shirt bound tightly across his chest, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. All held together by thin, black suspenders for Harry to grip or hook himself onto.
Merlin and Morgana, what the fuck had he done?
“Prim, proper little Potter,” Draco started with a bite, still surprised that no one had stopped him, especially their cardigan-loving instructor. “The whole world thinks they know you, don’t they? Perfect Potter and his perfect scar.” Draco paused, and on instinct, lifted his thumb to rub along the raised skin on Potter’s forehead.
Draco and Neville head to a party.
“Is that the spot?” Neville groaned after slipping two fingers inside and hearing Theo’s guttural moan around his cock. Theo couldn’t make any more noise as Neville slid his entire length deep into Theo’s throat and held. And held.
“Oh,” Pansy repeated, but didn’t follow up with any work gossip, her focus no longer on trivial things, and only on the dark-haired git, three booths in and clanking a glass with someone undoubtedly charming and attractive and
Draco slumped into the closest chair, trying to process that his flat was vacant of family. That his father and mother had chosen to leave in the brief time he was away, and whether they’d be returning in four more Sundays or not.
“Yet Cannons seeker and fellow Gryffindor, Oliver Wood, caught it with ease.”
What battles you were forced to fight
“You mean a good wallop?” the older man interjected with a laugh. Draco’s mind wandered to earlier, when Pansy suggested Ron could use a strong paddling.
“Because I didn’t mind it, Draco.”
“Oh, it is,” Neville grinned. “So pleasurable that all Theo wants to do is come.” He picked up another egg, this one larger but still slim. It buzzed between his fingers, even louder than the last one. “Until all he can focus on is the sound of my voice, the sensations, and the urges to come.”
He tossed the card into the bin, refusing to tell his listeners just
“Really, Potter? That’s the best you can do?”
“This morning? See, I knew she was your girlfriend.”
Great success required great determination, though, and Draco was grateful for his station, no matter how simple the task. A former Death Eater couldn’t laugh in the face of opportunity, not when the evidence was still so clearly stained on his forearm.
“No shame,” Ron grinned in response. “Just thought you’d like to know how much you have in common.”
“Exactly, thank you Pansy. At least someone’s looking out for my well-being.”
“When I came out, she asked me to do what every other Parkinson before me had done; keep my bitch out of my marital bed. She still expected me to marry, to breed, to produce more purebloods, to deny my truth.”
“I didn’t see much of anyone, ‘cept Longbottom.”
Merlin, did the writers even pay attention to what they were making him say?
“You fu-”
“Why what?” Theo asked, his voice muffled as his mouth was pressed tightly into Neville’s chest.
Draco couldn’t dwell on his own embarrassment for too long; as quickly as he had glanced around at his surroundings, Neville had pushed Theo onto the bed so his chest was pressed against the mattress and his legs were spread apart. His pants lay in a heap on the floor along with his shirt and Neville’s clothing, and despite being bared for anyone in the club to see, they both looked comfortable, warm. Safe.
“You’re still on air, Potter!”
“You’d like it if I lost to your girlfriend, wouldn’t you?”
“If I want to comfort my bear here, knowing how much he’s eager to please, I might say something like ‘My darling bear, you’ve been such a good boy’.” Neville paused, and gave Theo a quick kiss on his cheek after his praise. “Most submissives will crave this type of compliment in some form or another, so let’s delve into that for a moment, shall we?”
- playing without discussing limits and boundaries (and safewords!) properly
“Great,” Neville nodded with confidence. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to tend to Harry for a bit. See you tomorrow.”
“Clubs to attend?” Pansy raised her eyebrows.
Draco nodded, but that feeling of flying kept creeping into his mind. “And if my flower needs something I’m not sure I can provide?”
Draco gave a slight nod in confirmation.
Even through Draco’s trousers, Harry could tell the moment his hands reached the top of the fishnet stockings. He felt the ridge of lace, and with the pads of his fingers, Harry traced out the tiny green bow, the same one he’d stared at so many mornings in the drawer.
“Harry, make sure to tell Draco that winning against him was easier than a slice of tart, and that the Snitch is that little gold ball in the sky, not Coach Krum’s arse.” Harry blinked. He should have probably read the cue card off the air before doing it live. “Well, I’m sure Malfoy knows what a Snitch looks like, Ginny, but thank you for that insight.” He took in a breath, and continued. “But I’m sure we would all agree that Viktor’s arse is also quite a sight and worth more than 150 measly points.”
“That’s it!” Lee had responded cheerfully. “The people want to hear from you.”
Harry closed his eyes, trying to fight the sudden wave of anger that was brewing in his belly. “What if we practiced?” he suggested. “I’ve got this big garden, and the only one who uses it is Neville, and it’s not like I do anything outside of the show except focus on Quidditch and the dust gathering on my windowsill.”
Draco didn’t have time to react; he was still just realising that Potter was standing directly to Longbottom’s right and then Pansy called out and then...wait…
Another note: I spent a year writing this little version of drarry (& Theville and Ginsy), and I don't plan to stop now that we're just getting to the GOOD STUFF so please subscribe to the series, or to me! And continue on this BDSM journey with the boys as they discover their likes, dislikes, wants and needs. And keep those boundaries and communication streams strong. I'm so proud of their growth, y'all. So proud.
“Sounds like drunk you,” Potter answered, before letting his gaze leave the crumpled parchment to drag down the half-naked body in front of him. “You don’t look drunk now, though.”
“Which is basically foreplay for you two,” Ron said with a sly grin. “The least you can do is ask him for a drink, or a cigarette after.”
Pansy’s eyes lit up. “Good to know I still have my charm.”
“No.”
It felt so good on his long-neglected cock that Harry continued to rut against his Master’s leg. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he was fully aware he was breaking the rules, but he couldn’t focus on that.
“And what? Lose my spot completely? I’m lucky a team picked up an ex-Death Eater at all.”
Sharing a dormitory? All of them?
It had been years. Half a decade since-
“Malfoy.”
He’d never actually admitted out loud, or even to himself that his glances had favoured one gender over another. But Pansy was his best friend, and bisexual to boot. If anyone could understand, it would be her.
“Over my thigh, Potter,” Sir growled, and Harry’s cock twitched eagerly. He knew what was coming. Now that he was giving that directive, Harry couldn’t wait until his whole body was alight with his Master’s touch.
(See the end of the chapter for
They all moaned loudly, Neville and Theo, Draco and the rest of the voyeurs, when Theo was fully seated in Neville’s lap. Draco, who had originally watched to stave his own curiosity, had never thought that he’d
“You’re drinking tea while I sit naked on hard, cold, metal?”
He needed to find Pansy. And fast.
Pansy threw up her hands. “No Weasleys, got it! Because of their lack of vagina? Gin excluded, of course, but her snatch is well tended to.”
He never did, but the thought raced through his mind every fucking morning.
He always seemed to end up next to Potter, though. Near the sinks, by the toilets, in the shower stall directly to the right of the Chosen One.
“I know.” She pointed to a letter on the table. “I’m sending him an apology owl, too.”
That was a concept he was unfamiliar with.
“Possibly.” Neville shrugged with ease. “We’ll delve into the second form of play a bit later, how funishment and punishment work in this type of relationship.
“Heart rates up, quite a bit of sweating; what would you call that, Potter?”
“No--wait---what?” Draco stuttered. “Santa’s stockings are in December.”
Harry practically spun in his chair before pulling out the card Lee had handed him before the show. “Ah, and I see this week’s sponsor is
The glimpse, that one day
, the Wireless Network’s Chosen production, and if they don’t make me say that again, I might continue to show up for this gig.” Harry grimaced, reading the notes on his cue card for another promotion.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You Gryffindors and your blatant joy. Yes, he invited me to spend time with my own cousin, if you must know.”
Pansy laughed. “You’ve been spending too much time with Neville, darling. Now, finish that scotch. Bottle’s ruined now that you took a swig out of it.”
“Oh, did you?” Ginny gave him a grin. “And what are you going to do with this information?”
Admitting what he wanted was always hard for Harry. In the cupboard, his desires were discarded like yesterday’s breakfast, and during the war, well, thinking about his needs had just seemed... selfish. Now, however, he had someone that cared if he was happy and would move mountains to make it so.
“And now?” Draco asked, curiosity overruling a snarky response.
But that was it, the only reminder of the war. The castle looked fine, every stone tucked back into place, every torch happily lit. It was as if nothing happened.
“And even if I was staring at Krum’s arse, that doesn’t mean anything. You and your homophobia-”
The rest of the session was spent delving into the trunk, pulling out vibrators and plugs, ball gags and various restraints, including rope, silk, and cold metal chaining.
Draco’s stomach turned a bit. “Yes.”
Exhaling, Draco shifted so he was staring at Neville again.
“Then who the fuck are you wearing them for?” Harry felt the need to roar, but tampered his volume at the last moment.
“Since everyone loved Medusa, I thought we’d play another one,” Pansy called out, and why she was the ringleader for their sexcapades, Draco didn’t know. She gave Draco a quick wink before announcing, “We’re going to play Spin the Bottle!”
Harry had to close his eyes to stem off the rush of heat that coursed through his body. The thought of his husband, all donned up in black, or white, or the softest velvet blue crush, had him so aroused he could barely think straight.
"Want to spank a ginger yourself?” Pansy asked, raising one of her perfectly drawn eyebrows, trying to guess what was on Draco's list. “Or want a ginger to spank you? I’m not lending Ginny out, mind, but next time Charlie’s in town…”
Neville shook his head. “Not without my permission.” Neville tapped Draco’s sheet on the wall, pointing at
“Loves you so much!” Neville interrupted with a laugh. He placed a kiss on Theo’s forehead before releasing him, slinking an arm around his waist as he did so.
“Class tomorrow, same time. You can make it, yes?”
He used a Close Shave spell and a hair emulsifying charm and all the other bits of magic that would possibly delay the inevitable conversation. Begrudgingly, he settled in front of his Floo and called for his closest friend, who he was learning more about every day.
“Language!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“The third practice is all about insight. Knowing your partner in play. Where they come from, what they want to achieve.
So he had washed himself, scrubbing his own potion into his locks and tried not to imagine what the boy next to him was doing. What he was wiping off of his own chest, maybe with his fingers, maybe bringing each one to his lips to lick them clean before letting the runnels of water wipe off the remnants of desire.
He wondered for a moment if Potter would wear joggers on their date as well, or maybe he’d trade them out for tight jeans or black trousers. Or maybe…
“Oli, yes, Neville, we know,” Ginny rolled her eyes but gave Neville a reassuring smile. “Maybe in a minute. Draco, didn’t you have an emergency? Of the…” Her voice trailed off as she raised her eyebrows at Draco.
“Happy Birthday to you…”
“...Birthday to you!”
Draco ended up doing none of that, and instead tiptoed into the closest empty stall, the one that just so happened to share a tiled wall with Potter. He leaned against the other side, tucking his feet back as far as possible and hoping that they wouldn’t be visible should Potter glance towards the floor.
It wasn’t. It couldn’t be.
“And?”
He felt
Neville stopped every few feet to direct people towards the cake stand. “Yeah. Harry’s been helping Andy since he got out of Auror training, and after a while I started to help, too.”
By the time they arrived, the party was in full swing. Despite the dark clouds gathering in the sky, Aunt Andromeda had chosen to host the party outside, clearly to accommodate the masses of witches and wizards that were in attendance.
“Hold yourself up, Potter.” His voice filled Harry’s ears as his thigh was lifted and his knee was bent. He walked his hands in front of the chair as his legs were spread to each side of his Master’s hips.
Just when he had built up the courage to ask, he felt his Master’s hands on his thigh.
“Kiss me,” Draco said, his voice surprisingly strong considering how hard his heart was beating.
He wasn’t the only one. A few other voyeurs had pulled out their own pricks, or had their own hands stuffed under denim or cotton or velour. Even though this was his first experience at the club like this, Draco suddenly felt like he was a part of something. Like he belonged. Not a Death Eater, or even a virgin. Included, just as any other clubgoer on a Saturday night, watching two men make love in a glass room.
He had no choice but to exhale harshly when Neville grabbed his wrist, holding it upward, his thumb pressed tightly to the base.
“Good, so far. I’ve been able to choose for the first time in my life. What I do, who I room with…” he paused, giving Draco a quick wink. “Who I kiss.”
“It was a storm, Potter, and you know it. Could barely see my hands, let alone the Snitch!”
“Where are they?” Harry asked, his voice rough. “Just tell me and I’ll Accio-”
Draco unrolled the parchment, his heart beating in his chest. Was it from his mother? Apologizing for their sudden departure? Was it from his boss, asking him that his potion was a catastrophe and he shouldn’t return to work?
Draco felt his body tense. He had taken a chance on this whole thing, thinking that some semblance of this would somehow help his outbursts, but Draco wasn’t sure he was ready for an example. Especially considering the submissive was in fact his childhood friend.
After work, Draco headed to Hawes & Curtis right outside of Diagon Alley. Pansy had recommended it when he owled, even giving him the name of someone to ask for.
Theo nodded, barely holding himself up as Neville thrust into him. Neville groaned as he came, his cock buried deep into Theo.
- not a lot of talking (who's surprised, these boys barely talk)
He opened his mouth to ask his burning question, but then remembered Potter’s request that they stay quiet. Thinking quickly, Draco leaned forward, towards Potter’s ear, and whispered his ask instead.
“I’d lick every inch of you while you continued your little show, until you were panting and practically crying out my name.”
His mind was racing while his feet remained rooted to the cold tile of the bathroom floor. Should he say something? Should he walk right back out and pretend that he never entered the loo at all? Or should he peel away the thin shower curtain, march into the stall, and coat Potter’s chest with the same filth that covered him the night before?
“Would you let me help you?” Harry tilted his head so his lips rested right against the sensitive tendons in Draco’s neck. “Thread the ribbon through each hook and knot it so securely right...here?” He grazed the small of Draco’s back with his knuckles and felt him shiver.
“And now I have to go and explain my...excuse me? You’re sorry?”
Like his hearing. He was positioned on the floor, his knees pressed uncomfortably against the hard concrete as he waited for the barely audible turn of the doorknob and the very distinct tap of his Master’s shoes as he walked toward his prey.
After the war, he had come to the realization that he was quite good at convincing himself of half-truths and straight lies. Sometimes it was easier than facing reality, that your dreams of the future were just that. Foolish dreams.
His backside was covered by his pants, the same ones Harry had seen day in and day out, a stark masculine contrast to the otherwise feminine look. Before Harry could comment on it, however, he saw the fabric slowly transform into a black lace thong, complete with a final green bow right at the cleft of Draco’s arse.
Much too soon, Harry heard the belt clamour to the concrete floor. Part of him wanted to ask for more, his backside sensitive but still itching for touch.
“Well, can you ask him?” Ginny said.
“Excuse me?”
But it didn’t feel anything like usual. Draco couldn’t recognize the familiar touch of his own slender fingers as they wrapped around his cock. He couldn’t feel the twist of his wrist as it pulled along his length.
Pansy looked at Draco, surprised. “She’s spanked me, flogged me, sent me into such a deep Subspace it took almost thirty minutes for me to come back to her, but I wouldn’t call that ‘hitting.’”
Thanks to Malenkayacherepakha, EvAEleanor and Thunder of Dragons for your patience throughout this whole story. I would have given up way before this without you all.
Thestrals they could all see.
He rolled his hips again, letting Draco know just how much the thought of helping him look pretty was turning him on. Dragging his fingers to either side of Draco’s slender hips, Harry gripped him there before running his palms down Draco’s legs.
“Happy Birthday to you…” the crowd around him began to belt out in unison.
Or if those fingers, the ones that Draco had stared at as they wrapped around the thick handle of a broom, and stirred cauldron ingredients with such delicacy, were somewhere else. Clasped around something harder. Something longer. Something thicker.
“Impact Play is a large part of this lifestyle for a reason,” Neville began to explain, picking up the tiniest sphere and holding it out in his palm. “It’s utilized as a stimulator for your body to produce endorphins.”
Daddy dom Neville and Theo in this chap, y'all! Full penetration, a bit of choking, and a good time had by all. Enjoy!!! Let me know what you think about our Daddy Neville, and his precious baby boy!
“That’s it, baby,” Neville murmured as Theo rode up and down on his cock. His hands were still gripping Theo’s hips, helping him grind. “Make yourself feel good, I’ve got you.”
The sweets trolley didn’t stop by their door.
Theo nodded once, and then sat back on his heels, his hands unclasping behind his back until his palms rested flat on his thighs. His stare remained focused on the floor throughout, and Draco cocked his head, wondering if that was a requirement of a Submissive.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine, but pull out the good stuff.”
“Care to explain this letter, Malfoy?”
“Because!” Draco pushed himself away from the tree. “You left the club, and I kept going.”
“Wood.”
“Among other things,” Neville laughed. “In all seriousness, though, this checklist is vital to clubs like ours. Every person that plays has one that states their limits and boundaries. It keeps us and our Submissives safe.”
Draco crawled out of bed and stood, so he and Potter were chest to chest.
The sound rose above the shower spray, curling around Draco as he padded to his own stall. It came out like a moan, desperate, needy and as hot as the water that was producing all that steam.
“Practice has been a little...tense.” Draco swallowed, and his stare drifted to the ground. “He barely lets me practice, and the others on my team think...well, I can’t imagine what they think. Most won’t even look me in the eye.”
“I can read very well, thanks,” Potter said. “Your handwriting is not as delicate as I remember, though. Guessing you were drunk when you wrote it.”
Draco recovers from last nights club visit, and chats with a friend.
He stood and opened the window, allowing the bird in. The owl didn’t waste time, dropping the letter on his oak table top before flying back into the dark evening sky.
His focus was entirely on his Master’s fingers as they delved into his entrance and the merciful friction that came with his thrusts. He was so close, his mouth opening and closing as he attempted to ask his Master for permission to fulfill his powerful need.
At that, he finally wrapped a towel around his waist and walked confidently out.
“I wished I wasn’t for a long time.”
Draco shuddered.
Draco considered the gentle touch on his shoulder, the kind, sincere look in Neville’s eyes. At that moment, he knew he trusted Neville, trusted that Neville would keep him safe. He slowly felt himself smile. “Yes, that would be great.”
He thought about Theo, the metal chain that was twisted to add pressure to his throat, that was tugged to guide him to new positions. His mind easily slipped to Potter in the tub, but this time his hands weren’t just gripping the edge. They were knotted there with silky green ribbon, twisting up from his wrists to clutch along the muscles in his biceps, holding him still, holding him steady.
“He’s a treasured hero,” Pansy shrugged. “During the day, at least.”
A challenge. Draco rolled back his shoulders and walked steadily across the room, passing Abbott, and annoying Melody, and the other guy until he stood directly in front of the Chosen One himself.
“Do we?” Potter said with a small smile. “You gave me your wand. You wanted me to defeat Voldemort.”
Alexsander met him at the door, escorting him inside and handing him a lowball of brandy. “Ms Parkinson speaks highly of her friend,” he smiled. “She insists we take excellent care of you or face detestable punishment.”
“Correct.” There was a pause, and Harry panicked, thinking their play might be over due to his indiscretion. However, much to his delight, only a moment later, he heard the delicious sounds of a belt being untethered from its loops.
“Ask? No, I can’t bloody ask.”
Draco wanted to nod, to agree, but he couldn’t. He had so many faults and so little greatness.
Not that Potter wanted any of that. Draco tried to remind himself, but his fantasies continued throughout the week.
“That’s a good boy,” Neville whispered, as he threaded his fingers through Theo’s outstretched hands. “Taking Daddy’s cock so well.”
“And then he just hung up,” Harry said, telling Ron about his most recent show over a plate of biryani. Harry had cooked it, which made it rather more edible than Ginny’s curry.
“As if I wasn’t already under enough scrutiny, you had to go and accuse me of not knowing the difference between a Snitch and a-”
Despite Draco’s several recent visits to the club, he had yet to see anything close to penetrative sex. He knew the mechanics, of course, but had only tentatively stroked his own opening. Which he was unable to see, unless he had magicked some mirrors. That thought hadn’t occurred to him until he was staring at his friend’s puckered entrance.
He wouldn’t, of course. He wasn’t allowed to touch himself without permission. But he could still
The warm water felt delicious on his back and his neck, working out the kinks that had formed by sleeping at such an uncomfortable angle. He let the waterfall pelt against his scalp, drip down his chest, cling to the hairs on his thighs. Once he finally felt clean and warm, he stepped out of the suds and wrapped a fluffy towel low around his waist.
“Not Ron, no, no one is coming.” Harry took a deep breath, and forced himself to speak slowly. “Where...are the stockings?”
“Great to see you!” Longbottom clapped and walked over to Draco, “I’m so glad you made it!” He pulled Draco’s hand into his own, rough and calloused from days spent in the dirt.
Most of that time was utilized to discuss what the goings on were in the garden out behind Grimmauld Place. He, Ron, Hermione, and Neville had all moved in there together after the war. None of them had wanted to be by themselves, and all of them realized the benefit of sharing a whole lot of house at no added expense.. Neville had quickly taken over the garden, and now Harry often enjoyed sipping his English Breakfast and peering out the window at what plant was trying to eat Neville alive.
Draco could barely hear Pansy’s voice over the pounding in his ears. He had been kissed. Potter had just kissed him. In front of everyone. With tongue.
I never had courage in my convictions anyway
Even though he wanted Potter, he
Harry wouldn’t. Instead, he let his fingers dance across Draco’s chest, still covered in clean, starchy fabric. “Do you ever wear a brassiere?” he asked, rolling his hips against Draco’s firm arse.
“I’d feed you my cock, Potter, until you wouldn’t even be able to make any noise, until the only thing you could do was grunt, or pant, or gag, and you’d love it, wouldn’t you? You’d love to swallow my cock like it was sweet Treacle Tart, like it was the best thing you’d ever had pulsing down your throat.”
“Yes, Sir.”
“Malfoy.”
“No,” Draco said. “No, we can’t.”
“So what did you think? Did Neville give you the checklist for you to highlight what you want?" Pansy grinned. "I had a lot of fun filling that one out."
I didn’t recognize you, I couldn’t
“Not my girlfriend, but yep, sure would. Goodnight, Malfoy.”
I discovered that day
The Snidget’s body was almost comically round, its feathers shimmering brightly in the artificial sun. Attached to its large body was a long, skinny beak, right below tiny eyes that surveyed the trees around it.
Draco dropped his gaze to his black shined shoes. “My apologies.”
“This is a family show!”
“Is that what you’re calling it?” Harry smiled mischievously.
However his birthday came and went. There was a party, bigger than Harry had ever wanted, with people he considered his family flying in from all over the continent. He was happy to see them, happy to ring in his fortieth, thankful to have Neville at his side celebrating as well, taking half of the attention and cutting half of the cake.
Harry checked the next morning, both confused and surprised to see the stockings still in their hiding place in the back of the drawer, untouched as far as he knew.
Harry had shrugged noncommittally, but after Hermione had badgered him for another evening about him moping around the house and collecting dust, Harry had agreed. Henceforth,
(See the end of the chapter for
He flipped it over so that Draco could see his checklist, and instead of the scratches and checks, each option was coded a colour: red, yellow and green. “This copy stays with Oli at the front,” Neville said before turning the paper to face himself, “and I’ll pull it before each one of our sessions. Any change you make on your sheet will adjust on this one.”
“And trying to talk about Shrivelfigs.”
To keep me warm while you were wild
“Except with you, it usually is.”
“No, although don’t remind me, I have to see them this weekend.”
Draco has a quick chat with his friends, and then turns into a bit of a voyeur.
Everyone said you were the One
Had he really drunk-owled Potter? Surely, he wasn’t that idiotic.
Harry/Draco/Neville (triad fluff):
He went by Pansy’s room and found a similar note pinned to the frame. Zabini’s room was also empty, and while there was no note, Draco had a suspicion that the entirety of his dormitory was in the same place.
He didn’t even try to hide back his laughter. “Glad I never took up the saxophone, eh?” Harry continued. “We have a special guest in studio with us today! Everyone give it up for this week’s star Quidditch seeker, Draco Malfoy, who not only absolutely eviscerated the Kenmare Kestrels, but also broke a decade-long record by catching the Snitch in only five minutes!”
He glanced towards the bathroom door and was satisfied to see it still shut and the water still running. With deft fingers, he yanked out several of the old ratty shirts, winter jumpers, and discarded ties in a fury, searching desperately for the stockings he knew lived there.
A branch snapped in the distance, and Draco gasped as the beast spread its feathers and took off into the sky, a golden ball disappearing in almost an instant. It was beautiful, stunning, and for a moment, Draco wondered what it’d be like to be up on a broom, chasing the bird all over a pitch.
Maybe he’d soon find out what that looked like.
Harry watched Draco as his breathing evened out. Harry gave his friend a gentle smile and went back to reading. Mr. Snape had put extra notes with Harry into his book to help him understand the reasons as to the order of the potion and the necessity of certain ingredients, even up to explanations as to why potions were stirred the way they were. Harry was thankful for the pointers and notes because he would surely fail the class, and he would disappoint Mr. Snape.
Draco flopped dramatically back onto his back and sighed.
Potter continued undeterred “I don’t how you feel but I’m sick of fighting.”  It felt like he was trying to slap the air with the force he used to raise his hand. “Truce?”
Draco’s body began pulsating.  He felt like a hunted animal being trapped.  He turned away from Harry in an attempt to keep calm.  There was a faint snap as he turned towards the hearth.  In his attempt to roll over, his body weight had broken the quill beneath him.  With that, the floodgates opened.
Draco figured he was a ruddy pink mess and that somehow made him angrier.  His mind was going a kilometer a minute.  He felt like he was going mad, like that disowned cousin of Mother’s, the dog bloke.
A younger Draco would have skipped with joy at the thought of Harry Potter calling him by first name.  However, that person felt long gone. He hadn’t had control over his life since fifth year so he was going to damn well control what he was called.
“Other Weasley, Granger.”
The majority of the opening feast was a blur of the same false, overtly saccharine drivel about unity and picking up the pieces that the pretentious pricks in the Wizengamot spewed after his and his mother’s trials. Draco lazily swirled the pumpkin juice in his goblet to keep himself entertained.  He just wanted the ceremonial bullshit to be over with so he could retire to his room and get drunk in the safety of his canopied bed.
Her voice was small and delicate as she murmured, “It will be alright dear. We will figure something out, just like we have been.”
There was a beat of uncomfortable silence as the two men faced each other for the first time since the trials.
His hands were shaky as he remembered the last time he had been on this train. He'd cast Petrificus Totalus on Potter and kicked him in the face. The last time on the train his mark was fresh, his task given, and the lives of his parents, and in retrospect his own, at risk. All the power he had been raised to believe was his was gone. It was nothing more than a toxic vapor still permeating around him, no matter how much he wished it would dissipate.
Draco cut delicately into his sausage.  He took a small bite and followed up with a quick sip of tea as the familiar garish scarlet flash swept past his peripheral.  He exhaled an annoyed breath out of his nose and rolled his eyes.  He rolled his neck and shoulders as he prepared for the daily onslaught of howlers.
Draco’s chest tugged as the two former headmasters left the canvas of the painting.
He picked at the wax seal with trembling fingers, barely taking note of the hefty weight of the scroll. He felt like he was going to be sick as he slowly unfurled the tea(?), coffee(?) stained parchment.  Draco couldn’t help but take a moment to roll his eyes.  Potter’s handwriting was as messy as the parchment his letter was written on.
The awkward silence was palpable.
Fuck, he had said too much.
Draco’s eyes blinked rapidly as he tried to make sense of what the ever-loving fuck was happening. “…Ah.”
A younger Draco would have shouted from the rooftops that Harry Potter had accepted his hand in friendship.  Now, the closest thing he could say he felt was indigestion.
Draco’s fingers drummed anxiously against his thighs underneath the table. He brought a shaky hand back to grasp the handle of his tea cup. He took a deep breath as wild nest of black curls shot up and P—Harry’s eyes met his.
Draco shot up with a gasp and cast a wordless, wandless Alohomora before running to the coach car’s toilets.  He barely had time to slam the door closed before retching into porcelain bowl.  He was too distressed to even care how undignified and unhygienic it was to rest his forehead on the cool rim of the seat.  He laid there for a few moments as his stomach settled and the burn of stomach acid eased.
Draco ignored the crack in his voice as he responded, “That’s quite alright. I’ll be fine on my own, thanks.”
“Yes.”  If he was going to be forced to live with his childhood nemesis/git who saved his life when probably shouldn’t have, it would be smart to actually
He cleared his throat before giving Potter an unnaturally polite wave. “See you at the castle I suppose.”
He looked back at the bag before stuffing it back into his robes with a frantic shake of his head.  He forced his attention outside as he watched the scenery change from cityscape to countryside.
His pride returned with a vengeance.  When had he
going back to Hogwarts if it was the last thing he’d do. He held his spoon tightly in his grasp as his mind swelled with growing fury.
Draco muttered a quiet “fucking hell” to himself when another garish ginger head popped up along with Granger’s bushy brunette halo of hair.
This was real.  He was actually going back to Hogwarts.
All eighth year students were notified beforehand that they would be housed in a separate area of the castle with a separate common room due to “special circumstances.” Draco wanted to scoff.  How was anyone going to get past the war if everyone simply pussyfooted around it?  It was all bollocks.
The sandwiches tasted of nothing and he kept his focus on the swirl of his tea as he stirred it with his spoon absentmindedly.  It was mere weeks before students were to return to Hogwarts.  He quirked his eyebrow in thought.  Perhaps it wasn’t too late to find a tutor.  Perhaps he would have to do what he secretly wished for when everything came crashing down after the trials.  Perhaps it would be for the best if he studied for his N.E.W.T.S on his own in the safety of the Manor.
Shaky hands ran through silk hair as the fire in his body began to cease.  Dread filled in the craters left behind from his rage.  He forced himself to look P—Harry in the eye.  Their relationship had the strength of tissue paper. His stomach was in throat but he couldn’t deny the thrill that perhaps a fight would finally set the world right again, that there was still a hint of the normalcy he desperately craved.
It wasn’t easy of course.  For all intents and purposes, Draco was very much glad that the Dark L—that Voldemort was dead.  However, in a dark way, he was thankful he was forced to live under his sadistic rule for so long.  After the atrocities he was forced to witness and participate in, being called scum or a traitor was nothing.  There were still time where it took every nerve in his being to stop from collapsing in on himself, but he refused Wizarding Britain the satisfaction of watching him crumble.
“Shit! Sorry!” Harry’s apology rumbled against his chest.”  The man’s dark arms flew off him in a flash.  He took a step back and bashfully rubbed his hand against the back of his neck. “I kind of learned how to comfort people from Mol—Mrs. Weasley… and Ron. And, well, that’s how they do it.  Sorry about that. Again.”
He prayed to the gods that Harry would go by unnoticed but of course now, the bastard chose to not be oblivious. “Good morning, Draco! How are you feeling today?”
“Careful Malfoy.”
He worried at his lip before grabbing his wand to transfigure a few squares of toilet tissue into a small length of muslin.  He wet the fabric under the cool running water until it was fully saturated.  He took a deep calming breath before leaving the small bathroom.
Platform 9 ¾ was its usual claustrophobic hub as Draco maneuvered his trunk through the maze of bodies and luggage.  He took brief comfort in the familiar chaos.  For the first time in months, perhaps even years, something felt normal.
He was busy dabbing the wet cloth onto his forehead when he collided with a tiny body.  The banshee like wail coming from the little girl he had bumped into almost made him drop it onto the floor. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose as every single compartment door in the car slid open at the commotion.
He couldn’t control the reactions of other nor their mistreatment of him, so instead, Draco found other outlets for his rage.  He focused his anger on how dry and hot the air in the eighth year dorms were compared to the comfortable cool humid air of the dungeons, or how the clocks in the classrooms were too loud when he couldn’t get the tables right near the doors.  He hated when his quill dipped unevenly into his inkwell and left various shades of dark gray instead of the pitch black it should be, he hated when he woke up late and couldn’t shower first.
If Draco would have told his younger self that he would one day be rooming Harry Potter, there is no doubt that he would be gloating and writing an excited letter home.  Now, if he had also told him that it came at the cost of being stuck with not only a Weasley, but also a Longbottom, the excited letter home would have a much different tone. Exhausted from the ceremony and the current reality, it seemed they had all mutually agreed to not discuss the proverbial snake in the room, which Draco was grateful.
Draco worried his lip and sighed.
They sat in tense silence.
Draco’s eyes bore into the mottled emerald velvet of his bed curtains. Sleep evaded him. The scene from breakfast replayed in his head.  He still didn’t know what was worse, the words themselves, Potter’s reaction, or that there were times where he agreed with the sentiment.
“—No! You don’t get to tell me I didn’t deserve to die! It would have been a hell of a lot easier if you just let me burn, you fucking ingrate!” Draco’s whole body pulsed with adrenaline at the confession.  Angry tears pricked at his vision. “But of course that wasn’t all.  You needed to march in in all your fucking golden glory and testify on my behalf when you bloody well should’ve just left me to rot in Azkaban with my father and all the other Death Eater riffraff. Now I have to learn how to be a better person when I only know how to be fucking miserable or the annoying pretentious brat from first year and I hate it Potter, I fucking
“Weasley.”
Oh no.
“…I feel like shit Potter.”
A deep sigh of relief swept through the parlour.
With another huff, he slithered a hand into the inner pocket of his robes.  He plucked out the small emerald drawstring bag Blaise had given him the last time he visited before Draco’s return to Hogwarts.  He rolled the soft velvet parcel between his fingertips.  In probably the kindest act of friendship shared between the two in years, the dark skinned man had given him a bag full of shrunken calming draughts, sleeping potions, as well as a shrunken bottle of firewhiskey in case of emergency.  It was taking all of Draco’s will not to rip into the alcohol before the train had even left the station.
However, the feeling quickly vanished when he became aware of the wave of hushed insults and frantic whispers that trailed behind him as he made his way to the train.  He tugged gently at the silver chain fastener of his charcoal travel cloak to alleviate the growing choking feeling wrapping around his throat.  He blamed the growing heat on the train’s billowing engine and the hot humid air created by sobbing parents and first-years.
They shared another silent conversation before Potter patted the taller’s shoulder.  “I’ll see you and ‘Mione at the table alright?”
Draco’s lips parted but no sound came out.
“I would like to offer you the same.”
She arched a knowing brow. “Take your morning classes off.  I will notify your professors.”
Draco opened his mouth the clear his throat to announce his presence but it was like his vocal chords had locked.  The two best friends shared a look that made him uncomfortable.  It reminded him of his own friends that weren’t there.
He cursed under his breath as the bright morning chatter in Great Hall dulled in volume.  It was October now.  One would think the other students would be used to it by now.  Hell if he, the bloody target of the ire, could become numb to it, they fucking well could as well, the vultures.
“And Mister Malfoy?” Draco swore he could smell the rubber soles of his shoes burning as he halted all movement.  He quickly adjusted the knot of the tie, trying to alleviate the choking sensation at his throat. “Do take a biscuit. I insist.”
The letter and his wand fell to the floor. His mouth was agape.
The fire crackled harshly. Draco, still groggy from a Fiendfyre dream, shot up in panic and backhanded his inkwell into the stone wall. The piercing shatter of glass brought him back to life.  It was only then that he realized that the essay was due the
Draco couldn’t help the dry humorless laugh that escaped his mouth.
Draco knew that eighth year wasn’t going to be easy.  He would be naïve to think otherwise.  Hell, it was a fight to even let him return to Hogwarts at all.  It took weekly, sometimes twice a week, meetings through the entire summer with so many Wizengamot members that they all blurred together into one middle aged, grey haired wizard just to even get his foot in the door.  But of course, for a former Death Eater, that wasn’t enough.  He had to write individual letters to every person he and his family had hurt during the war as well as send them a small parcel of Galleons as war reparations.  Knowing his father’s previous crimes against the Ministry, business partners he had turned his back on and vice versa, and any half-blood wizard that set foot in his direction, meant that the Malfoy family fortune had been slashed by half and then some.
He didn’t like the reflective, almost soft, look in Potter’s eyes when he responded with a quick “y-yeah.”
Draco sensed movement and nervously cleared his throat as Snape and Dumbledore reappeared in their portraits. “Will that be all?”
Potter’s mouth opened and shut before he responded.  “I get that, it’s just—I don’t know.  I’m just tired of fighting.”
Just when the morning couldn’t get any worse, he heard a door creak open.  His mouth puckered out of existence when he heard the sound Harry’s over exuberant footsteps.  Of course, the Golden Git trotted around like an excited labrador. No. Harry was much too short, his trot was more akin to a corgi.
Draco finally boiled over on a quaint Sunday morning, the fucking audacity.  It was a somber game of duck, duck, goose on who in their room would awake in a cold sweat from nightmares.  Unfortunately, he’d been the goose that morning.  Since sleep was out of the question, he sat on the way too firm sofa in the common room attempting to work on his charms essay, which he thought in a panic was due the next morning.
Draco fought back a panicked gulp.  Their tone was icy enough to give him hypothermia.  He cleared his throat and forced out the most neutral, unbothered tone he could manage.  “As fun as this,” Draco gestured to the four Gryffindors with a lazy tilt of his wrist, “reunion, was, I really must be going.”
“Sorry Mother.”
“T-thank you, Headmistress.” Draco clutched his bag tightly and turned to leave.
Boy Weasley and Granger stood frozen and horrified as if they had seen a ghost while Girl Weasley’s brown eyes glowed amber with anger as she wailed, “Harry, are you out of your fucking mind!?”
Longbottom in the eight or so hours they’d been housed together was quite alright, unexpectedly so.  Their only interaction had been a curt nod in the morning when Draco was on his way to the loo while Longbottom was leaving to head to the Great Hall for breakfast.
They were complete opposites. Where Potter was short and broad, he was tall and slim. Where he was pale and cool, Potter was dark and olive.  Draco had come in traditional wizarding robes while Potter turned up in muggle attire. Potter seemed to have also grown out his hair, the dark curly nest placed messily atop his hair in a small bun, while he had cut his own as short as possible, only leaving enough length on the top to have small layers of wispy fringe to frame and soften his angular face.
Draco’s vocal chords relocked.  He stood frozen, staring at the tan palm of Potter’s scarred hand.  What in Salazar’s name was going on? Time slowed down and it felt like he was swimming through mud as he tentatively raised his cold clammy hand to meet Potter’s.  He didn’t trust his voice so he only nodded as their hands made contact.
“Right, understandable.”  Potter brushed sheepishly at the back of his neck. “How is she? Your mum?”
A lump formed in Draco’s throat as he gingerly unwrapped his wand from the rolled up parchment.  His eyes were misty, as if being reunited with a long lost friend.  His lips stretched out in a thin hopeful smile as his unrolled the rest of the letter.
Draco couldn’t hold back his irritated scoff. How dare he ask for a wee moment of The Saviour’s time?  It’s not like a letter would take more than an hour or so to draft up, the bastard.  He let out an undignified huff and carried on, merely skimming the drivel of his letter in search of the important bits.
“Careful darling, an aristocratic pucker doesn’t suit you,” was a phrase Draco heard many times during his childhood.  It was his mother’s polite high society way of saying “stop being a little shit before I give you something to cry about” in front of company, mainly his father’s business partners.  He’d still have the chip on his shoulder no doubt, which would be soothed with gifts afterwards, but he at least knew to stew in silence instead.  That had become Draco’s coping mechanism.
Draco would be daft to think that Potter wouldn’t have been at least slightly aware that he would be one of, if not the only returning Slytherin eighth year student.  Blaise, ever the pragmatist, began planning his escape to Italy during the holidays during sixth year.  His relationship with Theo became distant throughout the war, but he heard through gossip that he was already preparing for his N.E.W.T.S and looking to take them at the end of December if approved by the Ministry, the lucky bastard. Pansy refused to return stating that there were too many bad memories and fear of retaliation as were many of the other students and looked to transfer to different schools within Europe. His heart still ached at the mixture of fear and pain in her eyes when she floo-called him about it. Crabbe, well, he didn’t like to dwell on him for long.  Goyle—Greg didn’t even respond to his owl until earlier that morning stating he wasn’t ready to talk to him yet because Vincent’s death still hurt too much.
Draco’s fingers began to tremble and his lip quivered as Dumbledore entered the frame of Snape’s portrait. His eyes stung when the man gave him a gentle acknowledging nod of his head.
Casting wordless wandless defense spells had become just as routine as combing his hair before breakfast.  If he wasted energy going after every person who tried to hex him, he would flunk out of Hogwarts.  Was it a petulant boil on his arse? Of course.  Was it fair? Draco couldn’t answer.
“Fine. Considering the circumstances.”
Draco could only offer a terse “thank you, Headmistress,” in response.
Draco scowled. Maybe this was the prick’s plan all along.
Draco’s stomach rose to his throat as the little bird landed gracefully on the edge of Potter’s goblet. He thought he was going to be sick as Potter unfolded the parcel with confusion.
He fought back a scoff and brought his cup back to his lips. They fell back to silence.
Raging, echoing shouts of him being a coward or Death Eater scum were as mundane to him now as the scrape of a butter knife against toast, the clinking of dishes against the mahogany tables.
It took all of his determination to swallow without choking or gagging.  His tightly fisted hand began to shake under the table and ice trickled through his veins. The only sound in the hall was the gentle clink of his fork landing on his plate.
He turned on his side with a huff. There was no point dwelling on the past.  No time turner would magically fix their tumultuous past nor erase his part in the war. He would have to fix things the traditional way by starting anew and trying to become a better person and he fucking hated it.
The childhood enemies stood in silence once more.
With a disgusted, sigh he got up, flushed, and moved to wash his hands and rinse his mouth at the sink.  He grimaced in the mirror at his reflection.  The fluorescent light did him no favours. His sweaty temples and bloodshot eyes were too viscerally similar to the time Potter cast Sectumsempra and nearly killed him.  He fought back another retch and looked at the faint bit of scar peeking out of his button down.  What in Merlin’s name was Potter thinking?  This was never going to work.
Wizarding society saw him as a pariah who should be exiled to the Manor forever he figured, but Draco would be damned if he didn’t look presentable and, dare he say it, attractive and trendy in spite.  However, he couldn’t deny his own insecurity at the change. He had been growing his hair all summer and thought about keeping it long for his return to Hogwarts until his mother stated he looked like a younger version of his father.  As a child, and even well into his early teens, he would have preened at the comment.  But now, it was… complicated.
“Yes, I’m bloody well sure,” Draco growled through clenched teeth.  Biting threads of sarcasm wove through his tone as he ungracefully scrambled up from the floor to face the other man. “I’m just fucking
“Draco, wait!”
His back arched like a distressed cat at the familiar voice. Every nerve in his body was telling him to crawl into the compartment or to bolt.  He took a moment to collect himself before turning around to face his current(?) former(?) rival. Draco bit the inside of lip and did his best to keep his tone neutral.  “Potter.”
However, the flame of his anger quickly flickered away when his traitorous brain reminded him of his arms wrapped painfully tight around the smaller boy’s waist as he flew them to safety on his broom, the heat of the Fiendfyre brushing dangerously close to their legs. The ringing of his frightened screams was violent and shrill in his head.
let that prick win?  He wasn’t going to quit now, after everything he’d given up so far.  Come hell or high water, he
of all places, you know.”
Potter nodded his head. “Malfoy.”
The graying witch’s expelled a gentle breath and pushed up her glasses.  “Mr. Malfoy, it has come to my attention that you have been receiving harassment for some time.”
“Yeah…” Weasley shifted on his feet and scratched at his cheek.  “Maybe he’s changed, I don’t know.  I just don’t want to see this blow up your face mate.”
” His index finger trembled as pointed sharply at the bespectacled git. “I had finally accepted my fate that I wasn’t going to make it through, but oh no, the fucking
Indignation forced Draco’s voice out of his pursed lips.  “I can assure you I won’t be blowing up anything, Weasley.”  The two men jumped at his presence, which gave him an immature yet gleeful satisfaction.
Draco froze as he felt the witch’s searching gaze on him. He finished breakfast in a daze.  He waited for the majority of hall to clearly before grabbing his bag and heading to class.
Potter’s eyes swirled with something deathly close to sympathy or perhaps pity.
The next morning at breakfast, Draco massaged his temples with his fingertips. He’d been up all night drafting his letter to Potter. He might be out of his element, but he would be damned if his letter was half the mess Potter’s was. He took a strong gulp of tea before folding the small piece of parchment in an origami crane. Before bravery could escape him, he sent it fluttering delicately across the Great Hall and waited with baited breath.
“Draco, y—“
Considering their thorny past as teacher and student as well as his crimes of repairing the Vanishing Cabinet and allowing the Death Eaters entry on school grounds, Draco was quite shocked at the speed at which Headmistress McGonagall responded and sent her letter to the Ministry.
Oh yes, of course. The ickle golden children of the war didn’t have to worry their pretty little heads over such things. Only the rabble had to fend for himself. Lovely.
“If you gentlemen wouldn’t mind...” McGonagall turned to give the two men a firm look.
Draco’s body tensed as tentative footsteps brought Harry closer.  “Do you… do you want to talk about it?”
Harry’s voice cracked. “Anyways I—“
The wounds of the war were still fresh. He would be a bloody pillock, to think that everything would be water under the bridge.  People died, people were left hollow shells of their formal selves. He was the only available target, his own losses be damned. Besides, the Ministry and Wizarding Britain at large were foaming at the mouth for the opportunity to condemn him, to prove that he truly was his father’s son.  It was in his best interest lay low and not take the bait no matter how hard his jaw clenched in frustration.
to have a conversation.  Plus, his parents would be appalled at his diminished social skills.  “Mother is… not a big fan of crowds at the moment.”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!”
Timid fingers curled around the top of the sofa as Harry peered over the edge to look at the blond. He bit nervously at his lip before he pressed on.  “A—Are you sure?”
Draco raised his hand in protest. “Malfoy.”
Weasley sighed. “Alright.” The redhead gave Draco a trepidatious once-over before leaving the room.
This was it.
An awkward cough broke him out of his thoughts.
“That crazy fucking bastard…”
, Potter. There’s nothing to talk about. Just happy to be back
Monday.  His hand now throbbed for no damn reason. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and melted onto the floor with the grace of a flobberworm.
With a shuddering breath he darted from the study and ran to the garden, desperate for air.
And just like that, uncertainty began to roll back in like fog.
Harry was cut off as Longbottom walked down the steps into the common room.  He gave the two a brief once-over.  “Everything alright?”
Brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant.
, nothing angered him more than the incessant squeaking of snow caked shoes echoing through the castle because clearly 90% of the school had grown up in a bloody stable. In many ways, he often felt like a tea kettle waiting to boil.
The only other saving grace was that the numbers from the houses of those returning back for their eighth year were so askew, it was mathematically impossible to have one Slytherin, one Gryffindor, one Hufflepuff, and one Ravenclaw per room.  If Draco had been stuck with both Weasley and that prick Zacharias Smith, he would’ve began spouting pure-blood ideology solely to get expelled.
He turned his ire towards Harry.  “And
He owed Potter his life, that fucking arsehole.
He cast another Colloportus and drew the blinds shut.  He laid down and covered his face with his transfigured compress and prayed to any available god to let him sleep the rest of the way.
Draco quickened his pace and practically threw his trunk into the luggage compartment.  He just wanted to get through the crowds and into the train as soon as possible.
Oh Gods no.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes as every head in the Great Hall turned and waited with baited breath to see what would happen. He’d clearly forgotten that the only thing faster than a golden snitch was the speed at which gossip traveled on the Hogwarts Express.  He might’ve made grave mistakes the past few years but it’s not like he was going to murder a child in bloodlust, despite Wizarding Britain’s views of his family name.  He raised his goblet at the girl and gave her a nod of sheer indifference before returning his gaze to the head table and waited for the sea of onlookers to turn back away.
McGonagall’s letter went over well and Draco felt his stomach weigh heavy as he waited for Potter to respond, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Sure, the Wizarding Golden Boy, or whatever new rubbish name The Daily Prophet had given him for the week, had testified in his defense, but that was only because he was a righteous git, the poster boy for good.  Seven years of animosity would be harder to cast aside.  There were no Wizengamot laws on the books for schoolboy rivalry.  Even that was putting it lightly.  Schoolboy rivalry was reserved for scuffles and insults, not attempted murder and being on opposite sides of a war.
November was quickly turning to December. And, while not returning home was a given because he’d received notice from the Ministry cockblocking his plans for a normal Christmas despite Mother turning in the correct paper work
“So,” Draco took solace in the small crack in Potter’s voice, “did you come alone?”
had to turn his attention on his enemy and be the fucking bigger person and save me!”
For a while he let himself fall into a false sense of security, allowing himself to watch out the window with a childlike wonder he hadn’t felt since first year.  A smile was slowing forming on his face but it quickly faltered as he brought himself back to reality.
“—Mornin’ Harry, Malfoy.”
Since his trials, Draco had fully become aware and finally accepted that he was a coward.  However, cowardice was no match for the stubborn pure-blood pride instilled in him since birth.  As much as he wanted to run or simply disappear to the Manor indefinitely, he already came this far and he would be damned if he proved his naysayers right.  With a long swig of his father’s aged fire whiskey and a sigh, he let his remaining dignity and will seep onto the parchment as he began to write.
All too soon, the piercing shriek of the Hogwarts Express’ whistle echoed through the station.  Draco’s grip tightened on the bag as he lurched forward in his seat as the train began to move.  He fought back bile.
When that wasn’t enough, the Wizengamot proposed, passive aggressively demanded, selling the majority of their property which was to be invested into various charities to “allow the wizarding world to heal from the atrocities of this heinous war” or however the pompous majority leader had put it.  It left him and his mother the Manor and enough money for him to grovel and/or provide sexual favors for any measly job he could find for a year, maybe two if they budgeted well.
Draco froze so fast at shout of his given name, he had to reach out to grab the handle of the door as to not fall off the platform and onto the tracks.
“Yeah…”
Draco halted his pacing when the fire crackled loudly, the amber flame lapping violently against the ornate fire screen located on the hearth.  He stood frozen in place, fighting to keep his breath even.  He swallowed thickly as the fire subsided and forced himself to release the tension from his white-knuckled fists.   He shut his eyes tightly and took a deep breath as he heard the gentle cooing of his mother calling him for tea.
got tortured because I was “going soft” with my punishments.  He took a large menacing step forward and framed the space in front of him with shaking fists “and ah, the Astronomy Tower.  Such a calming place to sit and think, and oh, I don’t know, bloody well
“Neville,” Potter answered gruffly.
He had to admit she was right. Even now, flying was still so exhilarating, but it was partly because of the underlying fear, kicking off the mound, feeling your lungs tighten as your body began to rise.
“Really?” Potter raised an eyebrow, before adjusting the parchment to eye level. “Let’s read it out loud, shall we?”
“Longer arms, Potter. You know Wood has those long arms!”
“Well, thank you, I guess,” Malfoy paused. “I was better last season.”
, that is. He knew the story, of course, how Bragge offered Galleons to the Quidditch player that could catch the golden bird, and he was pleasantly surprised how closely the tiny creature resembled the snitch they used now.
“Merlin, yell it louder, I don’t think they heard you in Hogsmeade,” Malfoy snarled, but his feet stilled. He paused, before cocking his head to the right. “You know about Alders, though.”
Kiss? Tongue? Potter?
“Maybe,” Potter shrugged, before folding the parchment into a tight square and tucking it into his pocket. “Or maybe I just know you.”
Harry had rubbed the back of his neck subconsciously. “Not much, if I’m being frank.”
Draco's trying to overcome some deep-rooted thinking, so there's a bit of a shaming vibe. Please note that Draco is working on it!
: the drink that tingles as it slides down your throat!” Harry grimaced. He really needed to talk to Lee about these promotions.
Free to watch Potter eagerly snatch the golden snitch right out of the corner of the field.
Pansy took a breath. “The first few smacks always hurt. Sometimes, they’re quick, louder than you expect, but it always has a sting.” She paused, looking at Draco for confirmation he was following.
“Yeah,” Harry couldn’t help but agree. “Why do you think that is?”
“And then what?” Harry could feel his cock fattening as Malfoy squirmed in his lap.
Potter bending over to pick up a quill, or a book, or one of Draco’s origami cranes that had drifted to the floor. That smile he wore when he saw his friends; the smile he flashed when he asked Draco to the zoo. That fucking smile that warmed something up inside of him.
"Why?" The man said with his soft voice. Harry liked the man's soft voice. It called out to him like a lullaby. Harry sighed softly, "Because I'm a freak, and freaks aren't allowed to eat at the table." The man took a sharp breath. Harry did not dare to look at the man. He was afraid of he would see.
Griphook came back with a blank scroll. James knew that it would transcribe all that they would say and will open the moment their son would be willing to hear them.

Lucius wondered where he went wrong. Was it due to letting his son spend most of his day in the library? Was it due to him conceding to his wife, Narcissa, when it came to raising their son? Was he too lenient when he taught his son the traditions that all purebloods hailed from and passed down to the next generation?
"Mother, may I ask something? It's about what Father told me earlier." Narcissa Malfoy looked at her only son. Draco looked similar to Lucius, but his gentle features come from the Black line, where Narcissa hailed from. Narcissa smiled at her son beckoning him over to her.
In the next chapter, we will find out the reason why Draco's attitude changed, warning it will be sad, meaning that you may want tissues by the end of it. The next chapter will also be the conclusion of the Christmas holidays, and we will get an inside view of Dumbledore and his odd actions. Again, I appreciate all reviews, and I will see you all soon!!
, his mind whispered to him, did not ask anything. Severus knew that he would be too hungry to ask. He'll answer Harry's questions tomorrow.
Harry resisted the urge to whimper. It would do him no good in this situation. But how did the man knew what Harry was thinking? Was he a mind-reader? Harry snorted in his head. That was impossible. Mind-readers don't exist. Those are dreams and wishes. Those never come true.
- The-Songbird-Who-Wrote
The end of the feast was approaching and all students had to leave for their dorms. Since their housemates stood, Hermione stood and looked at Draco. He looked at her back and stood as well. Their prefect, Allison Gloris had lined them up so that she can take them back to Ravenclaw dorm.
Oh yes, Lucius was going to enjoy this a lot.
And so he asked him, "Sir, what did you almost call me? And if I may please know your name?" Harry was taught to be polite. It was one of the few things taught to him. The man seemed to be somewhat shocked. Harry assumed that being as he didn't speak as much.
My friendship with Harry is coming along nicely and will continue to be that way. I do hope that you enjoy your day, Mother, Father. I will write to you soon.
Severus found Harry still seated when he came back.
During dinner, as Harry was to serve the chicken he had cooked, he again was tripped by his cousin, almost sending the chicken to the floor. Thankfully, Harry made sure that the chicken would fall.
"A stamp." The eagle knocker gave a coo of approval, and the door opened.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderhead as I usually have to teach." Professor Snape was looking at them with contempt in his eyes.
Draco Lucius Malfoy, to Lucius Malfoy, would disappoint all those around him and soon be branded as a blood traitor. Inwardly, Lucius hoped that he would be able to banish Draco should it ever come to that, especially before others would find out. His son would also not be good to serve his lord. His lord would kill Draco. But Lucius still hoped that he will be able to shape Draco to be able to serve the Dark Lord when he returned. Lucius still hoped that Draco would be worthy of the name he carries.
Harry once more looked at the man. He seemed to be shaking out of anger. But why was he angry? Harry understood why he denied these things. He was a freak and never belonged. He didn't deserve many things. Yet why did this man seem so angry after finding this out?
Whew, and done! Sorry for posting a few minutes late, I was formatting again TT~TT. But I hoped that you enjoyed the reconciliation between father and son, even though it was somewhat forced.
Draco sighed and closed the book. He looked out the window and once more stared at the white peacocks. He started to despise them. They were everything a Malfoy should be but wasn't. Not yet though. Someday, Draco hoped that he would be worthy of his, worthy like the white peacocks outside.
White tapped the barrel to the rhythm of their house founder, Helga Hufflepuff, causing the barrels to move aside, exposing the tunnel that leads into the Hufflepuff Sett. After the last first-year Hufflepuff went in, White turned to look at the remaining first years.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry and Mr. Snape sat down as Griphook left the room for a bit, muttering under his breath about 'finding that will'. Harry wondered what the will would say. Yes, he was nervous, scared, excited, and angry. These emotions clashed in Harry's heart and mind. Harry was so swept up in them that he almost didn't see Griphook coming in.
"Malfoy, Draco!" Severus saw his godson exhale and stepped up to the Sorting Hat. It took a while as Draco just sat there. Severus did not know what was going on as Draco was not facing him. He was worried.
"We should go visit, Neville." It was Draco who suggested this. Harry was glad for Draco. Draco was able to make more friends who didn't want to use him for his fame nor money.
, it's interesting. Who knew that magic has many theories to it. Shall we go down for breakfast?" Draco smiled at her and shook his head. Hermione cocked her head in confusion.
"Take this to my parents, boy. Thank you." With an affectionate nip to Draco's ear, Regal flapped his wings and flew out of sight. Draco turned to Hermione, who hugged him.
"Mr. Snape, thank you for helping me realize that I'm not a freak. Thank you for giving me a new home too. Have a good night, sir." Severus just stared as Harry walked into his room climbing onto his bed. Severus knew he was smiling, but he would never admit it to anyone who asked.

Draco was pleased when he heard what Harry said. He was glad that his best friend knew and understood him so well. He was also glad that the Weasley git finally left. Draco was very tempted to give him a good hex before arriving at Hogwarts. Draco gave Harry a weary smile and sat down with him. Draco was hardly paying attention to what Harry was saying. He was too focused on Harry was talking so animatedly. Before, Harry would barely talk and animate his speech. Now, he would do it a lot especially when talking to Draco and it made him happy. This is a side of Harry that'll only I'll see, Draco thought smiling at Harry. Harry smiled back and continued to talk.
Author's Note: Thank you for reading this short, this was to explain what else was said in the will. I hope that it cleared up any questions you may have on what the will also stated. As for Sirius, well you'll see what happens to our favorite Padfoot. I'll hopefully publish Chapter 4 the next day or maybe the day after tomorrow. It's a long chapter. Thank you again and see you all soon!!
Sev, he will move on, now that he has Lily, but he will still love and remember her through Harry, so by talking to Harry about Lily, he is slowly moving on.
"I heard that Harry Potter was on the train. I was wondering - WAIT A MINUTE, BLIMEY YOUR HARRY POTTER!!" Harry did not like this boy. This boy had entered rudely without knocking and then yelled out Harry's presence to the whole train.
- Father
- Draco
"Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Longbottom, and Ms. Granger! Explain what you three are doing since you should have been in your common rooms a while back!" Professor McGonagall stated with a stern look on her face. With her was Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, Professor Snape, and Headmaster Dumbledore. Harry unconsciously took a step back the moment he laid his eyes on the Headmaster.
Author's Note:
A four-year-old Draco Lucius Malfoy, his howlite eyes were twinkling with curiosity. He loved to explore the manor he lived in. He loved to read all the books in the library as well. He loved spending time with his mother. He loved learning with his father.
Draco went to his mother after his father dismissed him. He found Narcissa Malfoy at the gardens as she admired the white roses that grew there.
"Harry, we love you so much. We leave you everything in our vaults so that when the day comes, it will aid you in many ways. We will always be by your side. You do us proud. From your mom and dad."
"Really? You think so, Mr. Malfoy." Well, at least he remembers pureblood customs, Draco thought satisfied, though, Hermione looked confused at this.
"These owls, were they addressed to Harry?" Severus was genuinely confused if these owls were addressed to Harry, then why did he not receive them?
They suddenly appeared in front of a black house. It seemed dead and dull looking on the outside. It seemed scary for Harry. His awe for how they traveled did not overwhelm his urge to be sick. He felt sick and wanted to throw up. But Harry knew that there would be nothing to throw up. He hadn't eaten for two days.
"Hello, my name is Cedric Diggory. What's yours?" Draco heard the boy, Cedric, talking to Neville. Neville gave him a shy smile and shook Cedric's hand.
Silently, the two friends headed to the owlery, where Draco's owl, Regal was waiting for them. Regal gave Draco a hoot and coo, causing Draco to smile at his pet. He took a piece of parchment, provided by the owlery, and a quill from his pocket and began to construct his letter. Words flowed from Draco, and he did not want to re-look his letter, fearing that he would chicken out or write another letter. With a finished signature, he tied the parchment around Regal's leg.
But Draco would not follow this. He wouldn't. Not while he was alive. He would rather die than serve the Dark Lord. But his parents didn't have to know that. That will be his little secret, revealed until the time is right.
Harry felt the train move after almost thirty minutes of reading and waiting. He heard Draco groan from across from him. Draco moved around the seat before he relaxed and slept well. Harry stifled a laugh. His friend reminded Harry of a cat. Harry decided to read One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi since Mr. Snape had told Harry that Herbology and Potions were connected as by knowing the properties of plants and their classifications, Harry would be able to understand Potions better. Mr. Snape had mentioned that if Harry was able to understand, then Harry could even create his own potions. This excited Harry. He wanted to try making his own potions.
"Why address each other through your last names?" Now, this is one of Draco's expertise, pureblood manners - drilled into him by his mother. For once, Draco was glad for the lessons and hoped that Merlin forgive him for all the times he cursed his mother in his mind.
Severus stared at the boy. It seemed as if Harry was debating something in his mind. Suddenly, Harry turned to him and hugged him. The last person to have hugged him was Lily. Lily, oh how he missed her. Severus didn't know how to react so he lamely put his arm around Harry as well.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was furious. He knew what Severus had done. Harry James Potter was to be his pawn to defeat Tom Riddle. Harry was supposed to be influenced, to be in Gryffindor, where he will rely on him, the great Dumbledore, for comfort and mentorship. Yet, he had slipped to Severus that the boy had not responded to his acceptance letter and wanted someone to check why. He hadn't expected Severus to volunteer, more so, to take the boy away and change him.
"Come, we should head to Diagon Alley. The quicker we get our business done there, the sooner we can come back." Harry agreed. He didn't want to stay in a crowded place more than necessary. Mr. Snape abruptly turned and flicked his wand towards Harry. Harry then felt magic wash over him. Mr. Snape must have cast the glamor on me, Harry thought as he saw the man's appearance change before his eyes. Mr. Snape's face became leaner and more defined. His hair became auburn with his onyx eyes becoming brown as well. Mr. Snape resembled an everyday wizard allowing Harry to think that he appeared similar to the man. He followed Mr. Snape outside their home and grasped his arm.
"Well, Draco is my best friend, and I don't want to go with you because of what you think; and no, you cannot see my scar. Now, leave." Weasley scowled at him, and Harry could care less.
Ever since Mr. Snape bought him to his home, Harry never ventured outside. He didn't know what to expect should he ever venture outside. Even if Mr. Snape left to go to Hogwarts for the Headmaster's sake, Harry stayed home and waited for the man. Then again, Harry was never allowed to go more than the backyard of the Dursley's. This would be Harry's first time going out. He wondered what to wear and how to act. Harry felt a bit better with the knowledge that he was to be glamoured but was nervous. He washed his plate and started to read Mr. Snape's copy of Edgar Allen Poe's
Lucius felt the many eyes on him. He remembered the harsh voice of his father, Abraxas Malfoy, drilling him into the perfect pureblood face, one of cold indifference. He knew that many people would talk and whisper the moment he and his family left the store. Behind him, he could feel Draco's disappointment in being unable to purchase more books. Lucius too mourned the loss. He would have been happy to buy his son more books specialized in the Dark Arts.
"Professor Sprout, may I say and talk to Professor Snape for a bit?" Professor Snape looked a bit shocked but the shine of relief in his eyes made Harry smile. Professor Sprout nodded at them and she went in with White.
I have made friends with Neville Longbottom and Hermione Granger, yes, Father, a muggle-born, and no, I will not stop being friends with her. Hermione is a fine witch who shows remarkable abilities that would make our ancestors proud, despite her blood status. Neville, on the other hand, is a shy boy, but with proper guidance, shall become a formidable wizard.
"Hello, congratulations on making it into Hufflepuff. My name's Cedric Diggory. I'm a third year. Ask away if you need help alright?" Harry nodded and shook Cedric's hand. He liked the boy already.
See you all soon!!
Harry loved staying with Mr. Snape. Within three weeks, Mr. Snape made Harry feel at home. Mr. Snape always took care of Harry's wounds and made sure he ate well. One of the first things that the man do was replace all of Harry's clothes. He took Harry's measurements and sent them out via his owl, Atrum. Days later, Harry had a new wardrobe that fit him comfortably and filled with Muggle and Wizarding clothes. Mr. Snape also taught Harry how to read and write, pleasing Harry immensely. Harry's favorite books to read were Mr. Snape's books on Potions and Dark Arts. It didn't seem age-appropriate for Harry to read, but Harry didn't care; he loved reading from Mr. Snape's library.
Upon arrival at said store, Harry and Mr. Snape went in. Oh, how Harry was excited to get his new school robes.
"Severus, pleasant to meet you here. Now do drop the glamors. It's unbecoming of a fine wizard such as yourself."
Severus finished his meal, feeling quite full. He rose to get healing salves and nutrient potions for the boy. The boy will have to take many potions and have salves applied many times to make sure that the physical signs of his abuse will be gone. But the mental and emotional signs will be there for a long while. But Severus was more than ready to combat that.
Harry didn't want to go into the house. But it seemed that he had no choice as the man walked to the house, not caring if Harry followed or not. Harry quickly ran after him.
- Father
"identify yourselves, please." James nodded. It was time.
"The owls were formally sent to Albus Dumbledore. He is the boy's magical guardian. Has Albus Dumbledore not send you these letters? He told us that Harry was placed in a secret location and that all letters addressed to Harry Potter were to go to him." The head goblin voice now had a hint of barely concealed anger. The goblin's lips started to form a snarl. Severus likewise wanted to snarl.
Author's Note: SURPRISE! I updated a new intermission chapter. I hope this clears up what has been going on with the Malfoys. I'll hopefully update again soon, but I'll see you all soon!
"Of course. Enjoy your nap, Draco." Draco smiled at Harry and slowly dozed off, listening to happy screams and yells of the outside and inside of the train.
"Alright. Thank you, Mother. Excuse me, I'll be in the library if you or Father will be looking for me." Draco stood and kissed his mother on the cheek.
"Mr. Snape? May I call you that?" At Severus's nod, Harry continued, "How did you know that I was at the Dursley's?" Severus pursed his lips and thought for a moment.
A cool, rich, baritone voice spoke out. "Where is Harry Potter?" Harry... the name that the woman yelled in his dreams! Did that mean his name was Harry and not Freak? Harry was ecstatic. He had a name! He had to return his attention to what was going on. He didn't want to miss what the man was going to say.
James and Lily Potter stepped into Gringotts, heading straight to the head goblin.
"Well, everyone else gets in. Harry, I'll stay outside with you and your friends until the professors come to us." White said as he ushered the Hufflepuffs to the common room - after he made sure that Harry's friends had turned away and covered their ears.
- The-Songbird-Who-Wrote
Two days after the argument, they had all gone to Diagon Alley to purchase their school supplies and finished the day by going to Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour.
For Harry, he was glad that he had, most if not all, of his classes with Ravenclaw, meaning that Hermione and Draco were always with him. Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said for Neville. Harry felt sad as he wanted to have classes with the nice boy.
"Show me the boy. Now." Harry shivered under the weight of those words. He felt that the man was strong. He didn't want to make him angry. He sounded much scarier than Uncle Vernon.
"Do follow me, please. I will show you both the Will Room. Inside, I will read to you the will of Lily and James Potter." Severus was nervous. He didn't know what to expect. The last time he heard Lily's voice, was when he called her a filthy mudblood. Her melodious voice was hurt and filled with grief. She then ignored him until her unfortunate demise. Severus did not know what to expect, but he numbly followed Griphook to the Will Room.
He closed his eyes as his mind filled with images of Potter; wet and wild, coming out of the Black Lake; leaving the Quidditch locker room showers with just a thin towel around his waist, chest glistening with water.
“So it doesn’t bother you that Nott—” Draco paused, wincing, before slapping his hands together.
Fuck.
Draco stood stunned, as he watched Potter walk away. He couldn’t help but notice the cling of his wet shirt to the ridges of his back, the hard angles of his sides. How the water pelted against his arse, accentuating each plump mound as his hips swayed back and forth.
“Tonight we’re playing Medusa,” she said to a room full of his classmates. “The rules are simple; I count, and on three you stare at the person you most desire to kiss. If your eyes are locked, you’re frozen until your lips touch.” She grinned devilishly, before adding, “Only use of your tongue can release you.”
Then, he usually spent the rest of his air time analyzing the past few Quidditch games, giving props to his favourite players (like Wood and Ginny), and, of course, heckling those who consistently fell behind—in other words, Malfoy.
How could Potter want this?
It didn’t take him long to decide on which option to take. He only paused briefly, staring at his stomach covered in spunk. His wand was in his hand; it would only take a moment, one quick cleansing charm and another one to dampen his hair and make it look like he had been showering all along, minding his own business. Instead, he knotted his towel around his waist, and with his best Malfoy glare, he sauntered out of the stall.
He felt the hitch of Potter’s breath before he even felt the puff of hot air across his cheek. Draco grinned, viciously, knowing he’d won. Feeling a way he hadn’t in quite some time.
“Yes, Daddy,”
Harry raised his eyebrows. At least Draco was admitting the existence of said stockings. “I know,” he answered. “I looked everywhere.”
“Okay, moving on.” Harry shifted in his chair, getting closer to the mic. “This is normally when I mess with Malfoy, I know, but I think we can all agree that he played a fantastic match against the Falmouth Falcons.” Harry had enjoyed listening to the game earlier in the week, trying to ignore how his pulse quickened when Malfoy’s name was mentioned. “That last dive was outright daring, and had the wind been in his favour, he surely would have caught the Snitch.”
Neville wrapped his arms tightly around Theo’s back, and pulled him close to his chest. They lay like that for a while, Neville cradling Theo, rubbing his hands up and down his sated skin, whispering things to each other Draco couldn’t hear. Even though Draco had just seen so much of both of those men, he had to look away. Their moment was too precious, too private that Draco felt guilty watching it.
Instead of a paper, he was greeted with a sloppy bit of parchment and two green eyes staring at him hard through thin wire glasses.
Draco nodded with a quick, “Thank you,” before heading down the now familiar hallway.
A fluffy chapter, with Luna and Rolf and Ginny and Pansy and Draco and Harry and Teddy! We're at the zoo, y'all!
“But his sense of style is preposterous.”
Without waiting for a response, Draco calmly strutted towards the door. Just as he was about to exit, he paused, turned his head and said over his shoulder, “Party should be interesting tonight. See you there.”
The sounds were still escaping the stall, moans and huffs of breath as the shower cascaded down. Draco wondered if the water was hitting Potter’s shoulders, running down his bare back, collecting in large droplets at the base of his spine. He thought about his hands, if his fingers were tracing circles around his nipples, if they were taunting and pinching his sweet nubs.
He twisted the bottle with his wrist and it spun, and it spun…
His mind had short-circuited when he realised what Potter had all over his bare chest.
His Sir wore that outfit every time they played, and it had built such an effect on Harry that now when he saw black suspenders, he’d get so hard he’d want to find an empty cubicle and wank himself raw.
“Words, bear,” Neville said, and Draco heard the difference; Neville was commanding him, his voice stern and direct as it filled the room.
That’s how Potter found him; hovering outside the doorframe, unable to go in.
“Pull your cock out,” Malfoy groaned into his ear before sticking his tongue out to barely graze the lobe. “Suck on it until you got hard.”
Today’s sponsor is
“Really, Pansy?” Draco inquired as he entered the room.
“What?” Draco whispered, telling himself it was just to hear Potter’s question and not to feel the heat of him against his skin one more time.
Neville’s smiling face greeted him. “How do you feel?” he asked, his voice full of concern.
“Potter, then.”
Play didn’t necessarily mean sex. That’s what Pansy and Neville had both told him on numerous occasions. But if they were going to play, and that play involved sex, well… Draco wasn’t sure if he wanted to watch. After all, he knew the people in that room. It wasn’t the same as flipping through Quidditch Monthly or delving into his fantasies. This was live, in front of him, and with people he’d have to look in the eyes afterwards.
When they had first started playing, Harry had found the waiting to be the hardest part. He was a man of action, jumping into situations without thinking. Now, though, he relished the silence, the calm before the storm. The way his Master’s eyes felt trailing over his flesh, deciding which part to explore first.
Neville situated himself between Theo’s open thighs and kissed the nape of his neck, the knot between his shoulders. He worked his way down Theo’s spine, whispering words that Draco couldn’t decipher in between his kisses. He wasn’t even sure Theo could hear them; his eyes were closed, relaxed, almost as if he were asleep and not about to have intercourse with a bloody Gryffindor.
“She loves when you cry?”
Nights were usually the worst, but the days were fine. Good. No, his days were great.
