“This is bloody brilliant…” he whispered as he clasped the watch onto his wrist and smiled as the words whirled around until four words came to the forefront of the face and glimmered a soft green. “Family, friends, celebration, eat. Smart little watch, you are.”
There was a long silence after the Potions Professor’s speech in which both teens waited for the inevitable talk about the details of sex. When it had grown too long, Harry decided to brave a question.
Remus slowly opened the bedroom door, afraid of waking Severus, should his husband be asleep. The potions professor was awake, however, lying with his back against their headboard, a creased piece of parchment clutched in his hands.
Harry felt tears burning behind his eyes and tried to blink them away, but it was no use; hot tears slid down his cheeks as he buried himself against Sirius’ chest once more, gripping the man’s robes tightly in his fists.
“Are you calling me old, Lupin?”
.” Moving towards the linen closet where they kept extra sheets and towels, Severus pulled out a black sheet, and then carefully lifted Harry into his arms, wrapping the material around him. When he walked out of the bathroom, Remus was checking on Draco, making sure he was still asleep.
“Severus, the boy refuses to tell me where he’s been, and who he’s been with. I figured I would let you try to get him to speak before taking drastic measures. I’ll give him time to rest and get over the shock, but I will need to know at some point,” Dumbledore said as he swept his long beard over his shoulder.
Severus pulled the door all the way open and gestured for his son and godson to enter the spacious room. “Of course. Remus is in the shower, but I’ll let him know you’re here.”
Draco snorted and finally looked up at Harry, who had a rogue grin on his face that made Draco’s heart race. “You fiend! I really doubt they would agree with that statement.”
Draco smirked, and Harry could almost see the mischief reflected in his slate grey eyes. So what if it made his heart speed up and his breath catch; he liked Draco this way.
Harry grimaced as he twirled his wand in his hand, trying to keep himself busy so he didn’t focus on where his father was at that very moment. “That’s disturbing. The Malfoys
“...Harry, are you there?”
Harry’s eyes widened as he looked up into Remus’ lined and scarred face. He shook his head rigorously, pushing the cloak back towards Remus. “No, Remus, you should have it, not me! I…I can pick something else of his or something, but his cloak should be yours. It’s obviously important to you, I couldn’t…”
“Gee, Potter, why don’t you just broadcast that to
Severus closed his eyes and took a deep breath, which didn’t help him feel any less like he was drowning in mixed emotions. It was true, he had been avoiding Remus; hell, even Harry had seen it. It was stupid really, the reasons he had for why. He didn’t know how to explain, nor did he really want to. However, he wasn’t quite ready to let the man go like he so desperately begged to be.
“A man by the name of Alan Arlington, who worked for the Daily Prophet, and two Hogwarts students; Michael Corner and Lavender Brown.”
Standing against the dark sky with its scythe still held at an angle, as if it had been used to trap a person before, stood the marble and stone version of Death that had haunted Harry’s nightmares for years. Carved into the stone was the name of the Dark Lord’s father, his death and birth date forgotten. However, there was an epitaph under the name that Dumbledore had not been aware of before.
Dumbledore frowned at his Potions Professor, feeling the waves of undulated anger flowing steadily from the man. “I checked him over myself. He has a fair bit of bruising and some minor cuts, but he was otherwise unscathed. I healed the few bruises bad enough to warrant healing before I started to try and speak with him. I am no fool, Severus. How could you ever think I would not take the safety of one of my students seriously?”
Harry was shocked to see a few mentions of his name in the article as well, a small narrative about the happenings at the Ministry the previous year, and Fudge’s lack of acknowledgment or action concerning Voldemort.
“Good evening, Minerva. Ron and I were hoping to gain passage to the second floor girl’s lavatory,” Remus explained with a warm smile.
“Thank you, Dad. I’ll try to head the Advanced group, if you really think I can do it.”
“I’ll be back after classes tomorrow, promise. I won’t be able to eat with you, but I’ll drop by for a bit. Goodnight.” Ignoring the burning stare of Snape and the slight panic he felt in his gut, Harry leaned over and kissed Draco firmly on the lips, lingering as Draco cupped his cheek and kissed him back.
a Slytherin. I imagine Harry was mortified at the very idea?” Severus asked in amusement, despite his embarrassment.
Tonks nodded slowly, wondering how the Head Auror could have gotten himself in such a mess. “Should we take it up with Kingsley, you think?”
Harry laughed and shook his head exasperatedly at the Slytherin. It was strange, feeling so very comfortable when this close to someone who had once been his worst enemy. He felt extremely blessed to have Draco beside him, and he hugged the blonde closer as the night wore on.
His breathing was heavy and his heart was still lodged in his throat as he lay exhausted on the steps. In all his years at Hogwarts, he had never known the staircases to change so suddenly. He had not been that lost in his thoughts, had he? Looking down at his raw and bloodied fingers, Harry decided that his own carelessness could not be all to blame for the scary experience.
Severus took the seat across from Harry and cracked open the ancient book. A little puff of dust rose, even though it had been opened recently. “It is not beyond you, Harry; you just have to think a little deeper. It is important for you to understand, especially as you’ll be the one entering Draco’s mind if we try this. I can help you through it; just give me some time to figure it out myself. In the meantime, try to continue making sense of Ms. Granger’s notes. I’m sure those will make more sense to you than this archaic book will.”
The four Heads of House and Hagrid were seated in front of the great oak desk in the Headmaster’s office. A tense silence had stolen the air after Dumbledore had shouted for them to all cease their shouting and complaints at once. He knew without a doubt that this could go on no longer, but the alternative was nearly as insane at letting the mayhem ensue.
“That was uncalled for, Dora. What is happening with Mr. Malfoy, how did he even know where Headquarters is?” Remus asked with a frown. He was trying himself not to notice Severus’ half-nakedness, but he couldn’t deny it; Snape was very well built for a wizard who hid his physique under many layers of robes and cloaks.
Draco scoffed at the rolled parchment as he watched Snape leave the kitchen with a familiar billow of his long robes. He slumped down into a seat beside Harry and slammed the parchment onto the table, hoping to crinkle it. The parchment stayed prim and stiff however, due to a common charm to keep post safe during its journey. “I can’t believe he’s giving the internship to Warrington. He told me he wouldn’t fill it until after I graduated.”
appreciate his alarm spell going off at seven in the morning. He considered cancelling it and going back to sleep, but that was out of the question when you shared living space with none other than one of your Professors. With a heavy sigh and a groan of exhaustion, Harry rolled out of bed, and promptly squeaked in fright as Snape stepped in front of him.
“Je t'aime mon fils. Je suis tellement fier de toi.”
“I have found it, Harry. The next Horcrux has been located,” Dumbledore said quietly, his good hand crossed over his blackened hand, almost as if he were trying to conceal it, even though the young Gryffindor had seen it many a time before.
“The bedroom I woke up in that first time was where I stayed. I wasn’t allowed out of the room, but one of the house elves was ordered to watch after me and make sure I was comfortable at all times. I had plenty of food, he didn’t lay a single hand on me, and the only time he used magic on me was that first night when he captured me. He really only wanted to know who killed his wife, and who attacked his son,” said Tonks, shrugging as if she didn’t quite understand it either.
A large canopy had been set up, squaring off a large part of the backyard. There were no seats or elaborate pedestals from which to make speeches, just a quaint black casket set upon a high altar, pleasant blue and white flowers surrounding it. Underneath a tarp, hidden behind the altar was a deep hole, dug by hand as was a tradition in the Weasley family and most Pure-blooded Wizard families who didn’t use mausoleums to house their deceased.
“What is the meaning of this, Ms. Parkinson? Threatening to use Unforgivables on a fellow student; are you trying to get yourself expelled?” Severus asked in a low hiss, annoyed to see Remus fawning over Harry’s bruised neck as if it was a life threatening injury.
The stairs leading to the second floor were hanging lopsided and blown to pieces. The second floor had been completely obliterated and the first floor was buried under the rubble.
Harry choked down a sob as he felt the stinging in his eyes turn to wetness on his cheeks. He turned and buried his face in Remus’ dressing gown, leaning heavily against his chest. All the pent up emotions had finally broken through and he could no longer keep them in. If this is what it felt like to hold in emotions for so long and finally release them, Harry couldn’t even imagine the type of breakdown Snape would have if he allowed himself to feel his emotions and outwardly express them.
“You can and will, Potter, or it’ll be fifty more points,” the Potions Master snapped, getting extremely tired of the attitudes he was encountering. Why had he agreed to do this in two different classes for the foreseeable future?
“It’s not nearly as great as your gift,” Harry said with a shrug as he handed the ball-shaped package to his boyfriend.
There was a long pause as they simply stared at each other. After what felt like years, the blonde haired man bent down and pulled his wand out of what looked like an ankle holster, holding it out to Harry, handle first. “I Vow to bring no harm to anyone residing in Hogwarts castle; staff, student, or otherwise.”
,” Molly wailed, her tears pouring once more as the twins crowded around her, trying to pull her away and out of the room.
“Thank you, Dobby.”
about this?" Draco asked with a bewildered expression. He'd tried to listen in, but of course the room had been charmed silent.
“I’m sorry Professor, but I have a horrible headache, can I –” Draco began, but was cut off by a sharp gesture from the Potions Master.
Harry frowned as he thought on that for a little while.
“Dad said to get inside, and I am, so stop!”
Severus moved forward with the Veritaserum and instead of allowing the rat-like man to feed himself the potion, which was still possible because his bonds were not all that tight on his arms, he took no chances and placed the lip of the glass vial to the dry and cracked lips of the Death Eater. He tipped the vial forward as the man, willingly or not, was compelled to part his lips and allow the potion to be poured across his parched tongue and slide down his throat. He swallowed every last drop, and the familiar vacant expression spread across his face.
“An Unspeakable heard about the potion, and got suspicious and reported it to Human Resources, including paperwork. We think it was someone who was helping, but got scared when they realized what this potion could do. We know every move of the experiment now, and it’s not been cleared to leave the room it was developed in. We’re positive You-Know-Who wasn’t expecting that one,” Emmeline explained. She pulled her wand as the sound of a slamming door up ahead caught them off guard.
Ron blanched and nearly tripped over his own feet as he stared, wide eyed and disparaging at the tall man beside him. “Er, to be honest, I’ve not really thought of that yet. I mean, sure I love her and I’d love to marry her, but we’re only seventeen, sir. I think we’ve got a bit more growing up to do.”
“I have the syringe, everything is going to plan. Once you’re ready, you send a Killing Curse at that monster and I’ll do the rest. I’m so proud of you, Harry. It’s almost over.”
“Dear Merlin, Harry. I think I understand now why Dumbledore wanted to keep this limited to very few people. That magic is some of the darkest magic there is. I haven’t even heard of it actually being used in several centuries,” Severus said, still reeling from what his son had confided in him about the Dark Lord’s seeming immortality.
Dumbledore gave a nod, as if this confirmed his suspicions. “Unsurprising, I must say, as Horcruxes are very dark magic. So dark, in fact, that all books pertaining to how they are made, kept, and destroyed were ordered to be destroyed a few centuries previous. However, a few of them survived the purge. The practice is now almost unheard of, but unfortunately for us, the information has fallen into the wrong hands.”
“There’s been a mass break-out from Azkaban. Most, if not all, of Voldemort’s followers are on the loose, including Lucius Malfoy. He might well be making his way towards Hogwarts as we speak. I think it would be best if we informed Draco,” said Remus, his expression grim and worried. He hated being the bearer of bad news, especially news as bad as this.
“I’ve always liked jigsaw puzzles!” George exclaimed, sharing a mischievous grin with his twin.
There was a pause as the three men among the living came up short. They hadn’t really discussed how and what they were going to tell Sirius once he got there. They had expected more confusion, fear and outrage, not this calm, understanding echo of Sirius.
“I’m sorry I’ve been berating you about remembering stuff or not. I sometimes forget how hard this is for you, and I selfishly just want you to remember me, or anything for that matter. I know you don’t mean to snap at me or lose your temper like you do; it’s part of the healing process, and something you can’t really control.”
Harry pulled the cup of tea that he was about to sip from away from his lips, groaning audibly. He had just finished an essay for Charms and was hoping to be able to relax for a bit before heading to bed. Apparently it was not his night for relaxing. “Do you mean viewing it in a pensieve or just Legilimizing me?”
“Sorry I’m late, Professor. I had to get this signed by the Headmaster before I could attend classes again,” Draco said quietly as Severus read the scroll then handed it back to the Slytherin.
“Well that isn’t Harry’s fault! He didn’t know he was limiting the Oath with the way he worded it, and besides, I was the one who asked him to explain,” Draco shot back, not quite sure why he was defending Potter in all of this.
“You’re not horrible at all.” Remus reached out a hand and gently placed it on top of Severus’, his calloused palm meeting a smooth, surprisingly delicate hand. He knew he probably shouldn’t have done it; he’d heard Severus’ objections loud and clear, but he just needed to feel something –
Molly smiled warmly at Severus, scooting forward so that she was sitting on the very edge of the couch. “Do not think I don’t know what you are thinking, Severus. Harry is obviously having some trouble coming to terms with the decision he has already made, but is unwilling to admit it to himself. As much as you will probably wish to deny it, I know you’ve grown to care for him.”
Severus gave Harry a strange look, feeling sympathetic as the teen looked so defeated and tired. He supposed the break up was punishment on its own, so he’d let Harry’s day of ditching go. He hadn’t intended for the boys to actually split up, and he had a feeling it would be only very temporary while Draco tried to deal with the ramifications of regaining such a heinous memory. His annoyance with Harry suddenly felt very fresh, but he didn’t have the heart to berate the boy now.
After Madam Pomfrey was satisfied that Remus was stable, she allowed the Potions Master and young Gryffindor to approach once more. “He’ll be just fine, but he still needs his rest! You two look as though you could use a hot meal and a good night’s sleep as well. You all push yourselves too far!”
“I would debate the truthfulness of that statement,” said Draco, chuckling when Harry blushed beside him, his own grin taking over his face.
“I’ll go with him, Harry, but I don’t think it would be a good idea for you to leave headquarters,” Remus said, cutting Harry’s protests off with a firm look. “We’ll need a plan. After we finally destroy the Horcruxes, Voldemort will be next. Since it’s you that he’s after, you’ll need to be the most prepared. Get the Order together; Moody and Kingsley specifically will be helpful with planning.”
that came with it. “Ok, go on.”
“We’ve messed with the idea a little, yes. Now that we know the baby is a girl, we can start trying to pick out a name. Do you have name ideas?”
gone all the way yet?”
“What is the memory of? Can you tell me, Draco? You see, the only way to stop you from reliving it every night is for you to bring it forward so that I can remove it. Can you do that for me?”
Lucius turned halfway and sent a Killing curse at Avery, who was too slow to block it through his laughter, and fell to the dry earth with a dull
Harry blushed furiously as he tried to ignore Hermione’s question altogether. He jumped as she snatched his essay right out of his hand and glared pointedly at him. He heaved a great sigh and prepared himself for the worst. On second thought, Harry decided this was a discussion better finished outside of the library, in case Hermione decided to start shrieking at the top of her lungs. She’d never forgive him if he got her banned from the library.
“Thanks, Weasley. Er...Pansy?” Draco asked, his pale and perfectly manicured eyebrow rising almost into his sleek hair. Even with the tent modified, it was still an awfully cramped space for two people, let alone five.
Remus looked nervous as he watched his husband kneel in the centre of the hotel room. The Dark Mark had gone from a rusty colour to pitch black, something Remus had only seen when Voldemort had used the Mark to summon his followers. “It’s feeding off of your Mark, Severus. That can’t be good.”
Draco pulled away and pressed a finger to Harry’s lips, feeling his warm breath waft over his fingers as the Gryffindor took deep breaths and exhaled haltingly.
“Sorry, but suggesting that
“Let’s take daddy home for one last Christmas with all of us together,” Ginny whispered, sniffing as tears streaked down her cheeks once more.
Harry quickly made his escape, just as the hot tears finally spilled over onto his cheeks. He had no idea it would hurt this much, disappointing his father. He had intended to speak with Draco that morning as well, but he didn’t have the heart or energy to search him out and receive the same cold-shoulder and rejection. He just couldn’t take seeing the pain in Draco’s eyes. He felt so misunderstood, and desperately wished Remus was home. The werewolf would have seen things more logically, further removed from the situation to analyse it fairly. He would have pulled Severus around, but Remus was not there. He was searching for Tonks on a most likely bogus trail, manipulated into service like always. Harry had no desire to eat either, so he found a secluded classroom, locked the door, and slumped to the floor as he cried out his frustration, anger, hurt, and the injustice of it all.
Scotland; he doesn’t make foolish mistakes. I bet he’s in there chatting the werewolf up, the sneaky bastard.”
“Yes, but not much. Remus said the counter-curse hasn’t been used yet because the Healer’s are trying to clear the infection out of Severus’ wounds before they try closing them. He said he’ll let you know as soon as anything changes. He also said that you all should head back to Headquarters because it’s safer and there’s no reason to stick around at Hogwarts. Besides, the rest of the group don’t look all that comfortable sleeping in various chairs or on the sofas out there,” Tonks said, thrusting her thumb over her shoulder to indicate the rest of the search party that had refused to leave and stayed in the dungeons that night as well.
They were halfway through breakfast when Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody came in, both looking stern and worn out. They gratefully accepted plates of food from Molly and sat down to eat. After everyone was finished with their breakfast, they all turned expectantly towards the Minister and Head Auror.
The cauldron-turned-bathtub that Harry had laid in was on its side, the ice crystals scattered about. The black sheet, however, was gone. And so was Harry.
Remus sighed as he snuffed out the candle on his bedside table and turned on his side to face his bond mate. “Why don’t you just sleep on it and we’ll figure this out in the morning, yes?”
“Well, Severus is just worried about you, is all. He’s right though, Harry. If you keep having that dream, you need to tell him right away,” Draco encouraged his boyfriend, turning his attention over to his potions book.
“These schedules were made with your O.W.L. results in mind. If you have any discrepancies with these classes, please come see me immediately after breakfast so we can get it figured out. I will tell you all now; if you did not reach the required grade in your O.W.L.s for a certain class, there is nothing I can personally do to get you into said class. If it is that important, you need to speak directly to the Professor of the class and get signed approval for a schedule change. Have a good day.”
Harry walked down the couple of steps until he was level with Draco. He tilted the other teen’s chin up until he could look into his eyes, seeing all of the pain and anger he felt himself reflected in them.
Harry sighed gustily as he smiled at both of his friends, feeling guilty for ever doubting them before, even if he had good reason to doubt Ron in particular. “You guys are both right. I guess I’m just worried about losing him again. I thought I was going to die the first time, I couldn’t handle a second time.”
Hearing his first name from the aristocrat revealed to Remus just how worried the man really was. Perhaps he had underestimated the man’s capacity to be human. His guilt for leaving Draco with the man lessened considerably. “It’s Harry, he’s...he’s gone,” he croaked, unable to say the word.
S~S~S~S
Severus quickened his pace, surpassing Harry, who was losing steam after running for so long. Remus was right on Severus’ heels, grasping Harry’s arm reassuringly as he hurried the Gryffindor on towards the Headmaster’s office.
“I’m so sorry I ever risked our friendship, Harry. You’re my rock; I dunno what I’d do without you. Next time I’m being a prat, just whack me a good one, yeah? I could use a good knocking around or two,” Ron said with a sheepish smile as he threw his arm around Harry’s shoulder and leaned comfortably against him. It felt like old times, like when neither of them had to care what the other was thinking by being so comfortably close together. Harry was glad they had gotten back to that comfort level at last. After all, Ron was practically a brother to him.
S~S~S~S
“Alright, I’ll take Draco to search the castle,” said Remus. He was surprised by the amount of relief shining in his bond mate’s eyes. He pulled the Potions Master close, kissing him firmly on the lips. “Be careful, Severus. I’ll not lose you, too.”
Remus shook his head quickly, cutting Snape off. “No, you’re right – I can’t fully protect Harry, and that is why I depended on you to do it for me when I could not. You did not let me, or him, down, and I should be very grateful for that, not arguing with you about Harry’s self confidence and keeping the Prophecy inside his own mind. I should know that you’d never put him in harm’s way. I’m sorry for doubting you.”
Harry leaned forward and dipped his quill into his ink, giving Hermione a pointed look. “Yes, he promised, and I don’t plan on letting my father in on that, so hush up about it.”
“No one can leave or enter this office until I remove the warding. What did Dumbledore want to talk to you about, Harry?”
Harry was nervous but very determined. His main concern was that he didn’t know exactly what he was looking for. He was depending heavily on his ability to sense the darkness of the Horcrux to help locate it, but he feared if he took too long, Borgin would get suspicious. Remus would be there to help distract Borgin from Harry’s searching, but Harry was so used to everything going wrong, he couldn’t help but doubt that things wouldn’t go as planned.
“Would you like to see the headstone by yourself first?” Severus asked suddenly, causing Harry to start from the unexpected baritone of his father’s voice interrupting the sound of nature all around him.
you’re ready.”
Harry politely accepted the tea and cookies, pushing down the slight worry that it was contaminated in any way. He took a deep drink of his tea and grateful bite of a biscuit before realizing what Dumbledore had even said. “Good news, sir?”
Harry pulled Draco aside after breakfast and led him into the drawing room while all of the members who were part of the mission began to arrive for their final orders. Everyone would leave at different times and enter Diagon Alley in shifts so that there was not a huge influx of shoppers, drawing attention to the Order members.
“I can’t…Harry, I can’t leave you. Please, we can both fit under the cloak. I can protect you,” Draco whispered as Harry gripped his shoulders before pulling him into an embrace.
Harry’s smile widened as Dumbledore instructed them to take each other’s left hands, feeling Severus’ larger hand squeeze his reassuringly as Dumbledore moved his wand in a wide arch over them, reciting a long phrase of Latin. Harry felt a tingle start from the fingertips of the hand holding the Potions Master’s, which travelled up his arms and spread throughout his chest. When he looked up into Severus’ eyes, he knew the older man had felt the same strange sensation. When the spell was over, Severus stood first, helping Harry up by the hand.
Draco rolled his eyes as he relaxed his wand and prepared to go into lecture mode again. “Memory links are trails of memories leading from one to another, or many others. A lot of your memories are interlinked, having some sort of relation to each other in one way or another. Even simple thoughts like what you’ll be having for dinner may lead back to a very important memory if you happened to have been eating dinner during that memory, or thinking of it even. My point is, I can follow one memory on to many others using the links and trails connected to said memory. That’s why constant blocks are essential; even the most mundane thoughts can lead to important memories, such as the one I just saw.”
“If it will weaken, disarm, or stop your opponent from attacking, then it qualifies. For example, if I were to send a burning hex at you, what would you respond with? Remember, offensive spells only,” Severus said, fixing his son with an intense look. He hoped that Harry would be able to give a sufficient answer, or else they all might perish for his ignorance.
“Not necessarily, but it’s worth a shot to try and find out,” Hermione said with an apologetic shrug. She knew Harry hated the creatures, but if it resulted in another Horcrux, then she was sure Harry would be willing to brave another experience with the soul-sucking guards of Azkaban.
“Have you eaten anything today?” Severus cut Harry off before he could ask to go to bed again. He was fairly sure the Gryffindor hadn’t eaten anything since the single slice of toast this morning, and he wasn’t about to let the boy starve himself.
Draco sighed as he leaned against Harry, who held the blonde teen close. “I guess I don’t like the idea of any of this. Are you sure you’re ready, Harry?”
“Really, Severus, there’s nothing more to be done,” Albus said quietly, even as he complied and rolled up the sleeve of his sparkling emerald robes. The black decay had spread from just above his wrist, to nearly past his crinkled elbow. Severus sucked in a deep breath as he trailed his wand along the length of the cursed appendage, his frown becoming more prominent as the results turned grimmer.
“What was left to Harry? Merlin knows what that man might try to pull, even from the grave,” Severus said with an exasperated sigh. He turned to look down the hall towards his son’s bedroom. The door was closed, despite his rule against it whilst Draco was with him. He’d forgive his son this time.
Draco pulled Harry even closer to him, feeling the Gryffindor shake and jump quite violently as the door slammed. “It’s alright, Harry. They’re a married couple, or at least as good as; fights like this are common. My parents used to fight over the stupidest things, but they always got on again after they both had time to cool off.”
one who was fully willing?”
“Dad, did you lose yours to a girl or a boy?” Harry asked, getting used to the fact that the blush on his cheeks would be a permanent fixture during this conversation.
“I really would prefer to think them innocent little angels who never think of such things as sex,” Remus said quietly with a reluctant grin.
“Calm yourself, child. You won’t be losing anyone, no one is going anywhere. Come sit down for a few minutes; you’ve been through a lot today,” Severus said in a quiet voice, leading Harry over to the sofa and pulling him down with him as he sat down. He bundled the Gryffindor close to him, gently running a hand through his messy hair. Severus looked up at Remus, who was making sure Hermione was calm and ok.
“The diary,” Hermione whispered, smiling grimly as Harry grinned at her.
“It’s awfully chilly out here for a session of inner reflection, don’t you think?”
Severus smiled down at his son, giving his shoulder one last squeeze as he released him. “I love you too. Goodnight.”
Pansy had a hard time keeping the sneer off her face as she nodded succinctly, then entered the Slytherin common room. The wall slid shut behind her, leaving Severus to stare at the wall. When had his Slytherins started to think it was alright to insult him? And why on earth wouldn’t the common room open to the appropriate password? It was time to talk to Dumbledore.
“To begin, Professor Lupin and I will be assessing your skills and separating you into different groups based on age, experience, and magical ability. To be sorted into a certain group does not mean you are unskilled or stupid, it simply means there is room for improvement. A first year cannot be expected to have the skills of a seventh year, and some of the older students may need some review with Defence. Surmise it to say that you’ve all been extremely lacking in Defence over the years due to incompetent instructors. Professor Lupin and myself are determined to get you all up to par with where you need to be in Defence, for your benefit in grades as well as survival.”
“How about a ‘thank you’ card? Without this adoption, you’ve no idea the danger I would be in. I want to get him something special, but what? I’ve no idea what a son buys their father...I’ve never had one to buy for before,” Harry said, feeling a strange warmth spread throughout his body at the idea of having parents to buy gifts for. Of course, he had to buy something for Remus, too!
Severus turned and raised an eyebrow at the bushy haired girl, properly hiding his quickened heart rate by masking his features. Clearly the girl had made some sort of breakthrough. “Yes, Ms. Granger?”
Hermione was giving him a calculating look, making Harry feel like a particularly challenging arithmancy problem. Her frown did not change as she drummed her finger thoughtfully on the table. “If you’ve already made up your mind, Harry, why are you getting Mrs. Weasley’s hopes up, just to shoot them down again?”
S~S~S~S
When Severus and Remus entered the basement kitchen together, a newly acquired syringe in Remus’ hand, courtesy of the Hogwarts matron, they both paused in the doorway to take in the scene in front of them.
They shared a quick kiss before lowering both of their wands as one to touch the surface of the pensieve, the jerking behind their navels pulling them down into a room that was at once familiar to Remus; Harry’s nursery in Potter Cottage.
“Thank you, Poppy,” Severus said as he looked over her shoulder towards Harry, who was already getting comfortable in his hospital bed so that he could sleep. He walked over to Harry’s bedside, waiting until Pomfrey was in her office to speak. “Would you like me to give you some Dreamless Sleep? You look like you could use some rest.”
“He was looking for a Horcrux. He wouldn’t tell me where he was going, and he refused to take me along, even though he had promised to take me before.”
“Draco, I wish you would just talk to me. I can’t explain myself if you won’t allow me to speak.”
Harry was sitting at the kitchen table in the basement, his hands wrapped around a cup of tea as Draco rubbed his back and murmured to him that he was sure Remus would be back soon to tell Harry how Severus was doing, despite it already being nearly midnight.
“Goodnight, Professor.”
After all the wizards cracker had been pulled, nearly everyone at the table was covered in confetti, or was sporting some type of festive body part. Hagrid’s snow white beard and hair looked quite fitting underneath his Father Christmas’ hat. Professor McGonagall, however, was not very pleased with her blinking red nose. Severus was grumbling as he tried to remove the giant angel wings from his back. They actually looked quite stunning on him. Hermione giggled as Harry cracked a joke about the angel of death. Severus cuffed him on the back of the head.
“What are you laughing at?” Harry asked grumpily, digging through his trunk for a clean set of robes and his tie. He jumped as he felt two arms wrap around his bare waist, but smiled as he stood up straight and felt Draco’s some-what pointy chin lean on his bare shoulder.
“You assume correctly. We have a job that needs doing, and once that job is done, you must go back. Do you understand?” Severus asked, hoping the man wouldn’t become insufferable and refuse to go back willingly. He was a little shocked as Sirius nodded with a sad smile.
care that you’re still so upset about his passing. This isn’t about
Severus frowned as the tip of his wand suddenly glowed bright red. “My spell has indicated that you might have some internal bleeding. I need to check for tenderness in your abdomen. Just relax, alright?”
Still clutching the ring so tightly that it was painful, Lucius quickly stood and rushed from the room, heading towards his personal study. When he reached the room, he went straight to the portrait of his great grandfather, and pried the frame from the wall. A safe was built into the wall; a
Severus saw his son’s reaction to the scars now littering his person and gave a sad smile. “They are permanent, though the Healers say they will begin to fade over time. They’re cursed scars, so even dittany could not remove them, not after so long without any treatment. But it’s alright; now Remus and I have one more thing in common.”
Severus sighed heavily as he pinched the bridge of his nose. He had indeed given it thought, if only a fleeting one, and he still didn’t know exactly what to do. “I have, Minerva, but I am torn. I know Harry will be loath to stay at Headquarters again, but Spinner’s End is simply not large enough to accommodate my growing family. We really have nowhere else to go, besides just staying in the castle, but I am reluctant to even do that.”
“I’d be very willing to give you an internship, Harry, but I thought you were planning to apply for Auror training directly after Hogwarts?” Remus said as he flipped open the
Harry scoffed and bent down over his trunk, rummaging to find a pair of clean socks. “Yeah, fine, we’ll call it that for now,” he grumbled under his breath trying his best to ignore Snape, who was still standing behind him, but now with his arms crossed over his chest.
“Draco?”
On one side of the crowd of seats sat all of the Hogwarts students and staff, the other half occupied by witches and wizards from all over the world. It seemed as though every witch and wizard in Europe had come to pay their respects to Albus Dumbledore.
“I solemnly swear I am up to no good,” Remus muttered as he touched his wand to the yellowing parchment. He watched impatiently as the ink spread and flowed, creating a detailed map of Hogwarts castle and it’s grounds.
“Doesn’t make him any less of a bastard,” Harry commented, snuggling into Draco’s embrace as the blonde wrapped his arms around him.
“You’ve got the whole world looking for you, it seems,” Lucius Malfoy drawled as he pulled a few twigs and leaves from his hair in a careless manner. He had made it through the forest much more gracefully than Harry had managed.
The fear of forgetting something or saying the wrong thing stilted his quill before he could even write the words. What did one say to the people they loved in this situation? Did he need to write to everyone he knew? Would those left without a personal letter feel betrayed and resent him after he was gone?
“I know, Dad. I just…I don’t think I can really process everything completely right now. I’m so tired. I just want this to be over already.”
“I know, Harry! Call him Moony! I’m sure you’ll never hear your dad calling him that, at least. It also shows that connection between Sirius, your birth father and Professor Lupin. He’s not just your dad because he’s bonded to Professor Snape, but because he’s always been a part of your life.”
Severus’ jaw dropped, feeling the blood rush simultaneously from his face and to his cheeks in a rare blush. He quickly schooled his features, though he knew it was too late. “I...You’ve no idea what you’re talking about, Potter,” he spat, trying to keep his slight panic at being found out from his tone. He was only partially successful.
“Dumbledore knows a special kind of Legilimency that is less invasive than normal Legilimency. It requires a willing participant, so someone will need to convince Draco that Dumbledore is trying to help him to get him to agree. If it works, Albus may be able to uncover the lost memories himself, or at the least find out why they’re being suppressed. Another idea of his was to slowly incorporate memories from those who know him to try and trigger a release, but that may not be suitable, as not very many people would be willing to offer memories – ”
Remus were considered his parents. He wasn’t sure exactly why it was so important that it be
“He thinks just because he’s taken our leader, that he’s won. He’s gravely mistaken,” Severus snapped. He stood up and moved to his liquor cabinet, where he poured three generous glasses of fire-whiskey and passed them to his husband and now-boss.
“Tom, what a surprise! Only gone one day and back for more!” Headmaster Dippet said with a smile that was much colder than Dumbledore’s, but not unfriendly. He seemed more sprightly than Dumbledore as well, and Harry vaguely wondered how the man had died when he was clearly much younger than Dumbledore was now.
Neville was staring at Harry, his mouth gaping and showing off his slightly chewed banana. He blinked and few times and shook himself out of his stupor before glancing around in a paranoid way as if he expected Snape to swoop down upon them. “Wow, Harry. When I heard you had a crazy summer that is
“Potter, Weasley! What are you waiting for?” Severus snapped as he walked past their group while monitoring the rest of the students starting their own duels. He was lucky they had extended the Defence classroom for practical lessons.
Harry instinctively reached up and rubbed a finger across the raised skin of the jagged scar marring his forehead. “My scar?”
There was a long silence as Harry thought very hard about what he would prefer himself if he were to end up in such a situation. He’d never want to live such a miserable life, he knew, but would Arthur feel the same way? Not knowing who he or his family were, not being able to communicate anything, being completely dependent on other people for even the simplest things...Arthur deserved so much more than that. And if set free to move on to whatever came next after death, he wouldn’t have to suffer anymore.
“You’re so strong; I don’t even understand how you’ve managed to stay above it all. I miss him too, and I keep thinking of the last thing I ever said to him. I feel so horrible that I never got to apologize or set things straight. I did the same with Professor Dumbledore. I guess I should have learned my lesson about sticking my foot in,” Harry admitted, feeling a slight bit of pressure lift from his shoulders as he finally got that off of his chest.
“I’m sorry for the way I acted yesterday. I’m still kind of confused about some things, but now that I’ve had some time to think and sort my thoughts, I feel much better. Before, it felt like I was sharing my body with a whole different person. I could remember everything, yes, but it didn’t feel as though I’d lived through those experiences. I was just a bystander, looking on as somebody else with my face and my body lived it all.
Harry sighed and nodded as they approached the entrance to their quarters. Maybe he had overreacted, but he still thought it was really unfair that Remus was being shunned because of his condition and his sexuality. Life had just dealt him a shit hand, he supposed.
“Harry! It’s wonderful to see – Professor Snape? Malfoy?
“Harry...
my fault. I don’t think it’s wrong to keep a secret for someone you love. How could Draco ever trust me again if I
“Shh, Hermione…”
“I guess I should start there. Ron...Draco and I are...dating. I’m gay. So really, there’s no need to think that any of those rumours are true. I love Hermione like a sister, she’s my best friend, but she’s a
S~S~S~S
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you,” Harry said in earnest, leaning heavily against his father’s side and savouring his warm embrace. It wasn’t often he got to just sit and talk to his father, and it was nice to feel this closeness.
“I know my apology can never undo the pain I have caused you, but I hope it will help begin to build a sort of bridge. Merlin knows how, but you’ve become my son’s very world, and it would be ill advised of me to continue to treat you as I have in the past. If you are so very important to my son, then you are important to myself as well.”
Harry was shaking, not at all comforted by what Remus had said. In fact, it only confirmed his fears that he may never see Severus again. “Is he going to die, Remus?” Harry whispered, letting the tears stream down his face as he leaned back against Draco, who had wrapped his arms around Harry from the other side.
“I wouldn’t read too much into it, Harry. I mean, if he really wanted to do something to you, I think knocking your glasses off wouldn’t be the road he’d take. It was probably honestly just an accident,” Draco reassured the Gryffindor in a whisper as Professor McGonagall’s lecture started to wind down.
Harry nodded, happy that he finally had someone agree with him. “No news still?”
Harry felt his heart do a little leap at that notion of reversing his mistake. He knew Hermione wouldn’t be able to resist doing research, even if it was to benefit Malfoy. “There aren’t very many books here in the Black library that don’t bite or turn you to stone if you open them,” Harry pointed out, picking up a blueberry muffin and taking a large bite out of it.
The door banged open once more just as Dumbledore was about to speak, causing them all to jump. Hagrid came bustling through the doorway, ducking down to avoid hitting his head. “Headmaster Dumbledore, sir! Jus’ had three students bring me ther injured owls, said the Owlery’s been blocked off, it ‘as!”
Before Harry could get a word in, the Headmaster stood up at the Head table, gaining everyone’s attention. The Great Hall fell silent as he patiently waited to speak.
you,” Severus hissed, sliding his wand out of his sleeve very slowly.
“What about cooperation with the Ministry? Sure we have the Minister and a few Aurors, but there are other important people in the Ministry we could use on our side. Though Mr. Malfoy may have his contacts, I have my own, and they’re
“Then take my hand, and whatever you do, don’t let go. There’s no saying what could happen after this...it might even hurt a bit, and I’m sorry for that. It could hurt me too. Make sure your mind is completely clear before giving me a signal so I know to continue. Ready?”
Draco shrugged as he leaned back against the wall, his arms crossed over his chest. It was still awfully chilly, despite his warming charm. “Yeah, I’ve heard of you. In fact, I probably know much more about you than others who’ve seen you.”
charm. The Dark Lord has known where you reside all along, it was never a matter of finding you; it was a matter of
Harry cringed as a shiver ran down his spine. It sounded almost like what he went through every time he was near a Dementor. “That’s horrible...Is there a counter-curse?”
old enough to start a family; you lot are still babies yourselves!”
Severus walked directly passed Granger and opened the door to his office, pointing sharply towards the door. “In.”
They returned to their positions lying side by side on Draco’s bed, and after a short snogging session, fell asleep in each other’s arms. A little while later, when Severus and Remus came to check on the two boys, they couldn’t help but smile at the way they were wrapped around each other, fully clothed, even down to their very shoes.
Remus would accompany Harry into Borgin and Burkes, both Polyjuiced into nondescript Muggles, just to make sure Borgin didn’t recognize the disguises. Ron, Hermione, Severus and Lucius would be using Notice-Me-Not charms and repelling charms to help keep other shoppers from entering Borgin and Burkes.
“Night, Remus.” Harry pulled off his trainers and socks, laying them beside the bed and pulling his tee shirt off over his head. As he lay his head down on his pillows, he couldn’t help but feel he had torn some sort of hole in the patched up relationship between Snape and Remus, and it made him feel horrible.
“Professor, what about international cooperation? The war might be here in the U.K. but there are definitely people around the world being affected by You-Know-Who. Bill and I know quite a few ourselves, seeing as we lived elsewhere for many years,” Charlie pointed out, his older brother nodding in agreement beside him.
Draco finished up his essay, using a spell to dry the ink quickly before rolling it up. He looked at the clock and realized it was much too late to take the essay to Professor McGonagall, so he stashed it away in his book bag for the time being.
“I dunno, do I? I’d like to believe it, but then again...it seems nearly impossible. I love my father, but he is not exactly what you’d call a good person,” Draco said sardonically, wiping a bit of egg off of Harry’s face.
S~S~S~S
“Well, that’s just awkward on a whole new level,” Draco answered, confusing both Harry and Severus in one go. They both cocked an eye brow at him simultaneously, the look so familiar and similar it made Draco chuckle. Harry was obviously spending a lot of time with the Potions Master.
Draco squeezed his eyes closed against the image of Harry’s concerned face coming closer to him. Even after everything he had said to the Gryffindor, and the sickening memory that Harry had been witness to, he was still capable of compassion for Draco. He let out a shuddering breath as he opened his eyes and found Harry much closer to him than before, looking like he wanted to reach out, but he was hesitating.
They were greeted with Aurora’s glowing face, as well as a pink glowing abdomen, both of them slightly worried about the ecstatic look on her face. She looked slightly crazed, if not extremely happy.
Hermione sighed. She felt like maybe she was out of her depth with this one, but maybe she could help at least a little.
Lucius just shook his head in bemusement. Without warning, he wrapped Draco in a tight hug and kissed the top of the teen’s head, which wasn’t very easy to do as the boy was nearly as tall as he was now. “I’ll see you soon where we agreed to meet, alright?”
“I need to get a book from the library, I’ll just work there,” Harry said, waving Snape off and ignoring his demands to come back. He made his way quickly to the library and found an empty table in the far back corner. Throwing his bag heavily onto the table, Harry pulled out the chair and slumped into it, not bothering to get his work out at all. He leaned his head on his arms over the table, resting his eyes for a bit to help gather his thoughts, and fell asleep.
“Harry, you have to tell him – ”
Severus moved around the room, the Dark Mark still exposed. He could feel the torrents of dark magic getting stronger as he moved, an unpleasant tingle prickling at the skin imprinted with Voldemort’s mark. “This is precisely what I meant by ‘payment’. The magic that’s protecting the Horcrux senses the Dark Lord’s magical signature from the Mark. It’s calling to it.”
a bit, Nev.”
Harry burst out into laughter, some more of his nerves leaving him as he doubled over, causing Draco to pick up his infectious laughter. They crumpled onto the sofa together, giggling uncontrollably, with kisses interspersed. This was how Severus and Remus found them ten minutes later.
“You’re ok, right? You’re not hurt?” Harry asked for the tenth time after they finished eating and sat down around the coffee table together.
“Don’t we all? I can honestly say I’ve never been glad to feel helpless. Besides, you’re not helpless, you’re scared; there is a difference,” Remus said quietly as he held Severus close to him. It was strange how it didn’t
It only took Ron a few seconds of awkward shuffling before he was grabbing Harry up into a bear hug, his gangly arms wrapping around the shorter teen, making him feel safe and loved. “Please come back in one piece. I couldn’t bear it if something happens to you, so you better be back, and you better be ok.”
Severus picked one of the bags up off the floor and held it out to Draco. It was full of new clothes and a nice pair of boots. Draco had been wearing some of Harry’s clothes, resized to fit his taller frame and leaner body. “It’s not very much, but I figured you could use some clothes of your own before school started up again.”
“Is that the proper way to invoke a Life Debt?” Hermione asked, her expression just as disapproving as Remus’, though there was a hint of curiosity, as was always the case with Hermione.
, don’t you know.
S~S~S~S
Harry nodded sadly, taking another sip of his tea. He felt guilty that he had immediately thought of the Weasleys even before Remus, but he chalked it up to his subconscious knowing better than to consider the werewolf. It was unfair, it really was. If the laws were different, Harry would definitely have gone to Remus above all the others, including the Weasleys.
After dinner as they sat in the drawing room, Harry shared his thoughts with Draco, who became immediately angry. Harry had to stop him from finding Ron and going off on him.
“It was purely by accident that I heard about your sexual preferences. Gossip, even among adults, is unfortunately quite carrying. Professor Grubbly-Plank didn’t seem to mind outing you to the staff,” Remus remarked with a snort. He’d always thought that old woman was quite a hoot.
“A letter came for you just now. The owl ended up in our quarters for some reason. I think it’s from your father but I’m not sure. It won’t give the letter to anyone but you, so Sev told me to come wake you.”
to cover what mood his godson was in. “Engagement? What do you mean?”
Severus shifted in his sleep, feeling a warm hand tracing his cheek. He clenched his eyes closed against a bright beam of light trying to break through his eyelids. He was determined not to wake up; at least not until he felt a pair of soft lips press against his own. His eyes slid open as the kiss was broken, spotting Remus in the faint wand light trained on him. He glanced around and saw that he had fallen asleep beside Harry’s bed in the infirmary.
“Why not? He’s letting you live with him, and he’s already vowed to protect you anyways. In fact, I think he’s a much better choice than Remus or the Weasleys,” said Draco in a matter of fact voice that set Harry’s skin on edge.
There wasn’t time to both protect herself and Charlie. She could get one spell off before MacNair struck again, and she knew what she needed to do. Tonks heard Charlie scream her name as she pointed her wand at him and cast a shield spell, leaving herself in the open. Before Charlie could reach his wand and before she could cast another spell, Tonks was hit from behind by a spell from MacNair.
Remus sighed heavily as he pulled Harry closer, relaxing into the sofa. This was going to take a bit to explain. “Harry, after your parents were killed and Sirius was arrested for supposedly killing Peter, I was literally alone. I had been staying with Sirius in his flat, and after his arrest, it was taken by the Ministry. I had nowhere to go, and I wasn’t willing to take the hand-outs that people like Dumbledore offered me. I was alone, grieving the loss of everyone important in my life, and devastated that my affliction meant that there was no way for me to take custody of you. I felt useless; I hated myself for being what I am. I was extremely depressed. I ended up on the streets, using every last knut I had to drink myself into a stupor. I was not in a good place. I felt I had nothing left to live for.
“Fawkes must have burned recently,” Harry said in a conversational tone as he took the seat in front of Dumbledore’s large oak desk. He tried to avoid the man’s piercing gaze by focusing on the tiny version of the magnificent bird.
Ron nodded fervently as Hermione wiped at her teary eyes. “Of course, mate. Sorry that you have to spend your birthday alone – or, er, with whoever it is you’re staying with. We’ll eat some cake for you!”
“So I have a list here of all the potions that need to be administered regularly. There is a very specific schedule that must be followed, so pay close attention to the times that these need to be given at. A diagnostic spell needs to be performed every three hours until nine in the evening, starting again at seven in the morning. A cleaning and refreshening charm needs to be used daily, even twice or three times if you feel it’s necessary. Bed linens to be changed every three days, and he needs to be half-elevated for at least six hours a day. Leg stretches and rotating of joints and neck needs to be performed twice a day, once in the morning, once in the evening. His feeding schedule is underneath his potion regimen schedule. He takes different nutrients at different times, so make sure you pay attention to which nutrient potion you administer in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
“I’ll make sure this scum makes it directly to the Ministry. You all go on back to Headquarters. You’ve been away from the protection for too long already,” said Lucius, training his wand on Wormtail once more. He muttered a spell that sounded nothing like Latin and gave a horrible smirk. “That’ll keep you from transforming –
“Yes, Harry. The Dark Lord killed Albus.”
Harry blinked up at Molly, feeling the ache in his chest loosen just a little at the sound of her motherly voice. It seemed that whenever everything else in the world seemed hopeless, Molly would always be the constant in his life, offering him an anchor on which to cling when he felt like he had nothing else.
“I gathered as much. Well, clue me in, then. Also, I’m going to go ahead and just assume that this is a temporary invitation back to the living, right?” Sirius asked as he nonchalantly threw his arms behind his head and kicked his feet up onto the table, his easy slouch and soft grin enough to take the edge off Harry’s anxiety and Remus’ grief.
The late Headmaster sighed sadly, fixing Harry with such a sorrowful look that he felt his eyes begin to sting with tears. “I had hoped to be the one to tell you, my boy. I had always had plans to let you know, but I tried for a very long time to figure out just how to do so. How do you tell someone they must die, lest the whole world come to ruin under a madman’s reign? I was foolish; I waited too long, just like with the Prophecy.”
“Utterly ridiculous. We could be Snapes with these locks.”
Tonks reached out a hand and grasped Harry’s shoulder gently, surprised to feel the boy trembling. Since when had Harry grown to care for someone like Snape? From what she had heard from various Order members, Harry and Snape had been at each other’s throats from the day the boy had stepped foot into Hogwarts. “Snape is a smart and manipulative man, Harry. I’m sure he will find a way out of all of this, you’ll see. But Harry, I don’t see why you’re so concerned. In my opinion, Snape is just reaping what he sowed,” she said, flipping her shoulder-length blonde hair out of her face. She had never really been a huge fan of Severus Snape, not that many people were, but being an Auror also brain washed her to believe that, once a Dark Wizard, always a Dark Wizard.
He opened the window of his study and leaned out, whistling into the darkness. It took a few minutes, but a large eagle owl came flying out of the forest which lay beyond the Manor and flew to window, landing heavily on his outstretched arm. He attached the letter and whispered to the owl, “Take this to my son.”
“Dad, what is this about? Getting my cloak, I mean,” Harry asked tentatively, still unsure of just where he stood with his father at this point. The man had been
“I will take whatever you are willing to give, and I offer myself completely in return,” Severus whispered, holding tightly to the man in his arms. When Remus had first come on to him, Severus never thought it could have worked because of their past, and like he had told Remus before, he had been afraid to let himself fall in love. But as Severus stood there, holding the man he loved in his arms as he cried, he couldn’t imagine his life without Remus in it from then on.
“Where were you kept? A cell, the basement?” Harry asked curiously.
S~S~S~S
Severus cast another detection spell, and this time it latched onto something. He shared a look with his husband before they both followed the faint blue line of the detection spell down the corridor.
Harry felt his stomach churn at the worried tone of his father’s voice. Upon realizing that the last Horcrux was sure to be found tonight, Harry knew that he would have to put the plan he had come up with into effect. The panic that tried to consume him was lingering under the surface of his carefully constructed façade. He could not give himself away and alert anyone to his inner turmoil if his plan were to work. It was just that he had thought he’d have a little more time; time to kiss Draco, laugh with Ron and Hermione, play chess with Severus, learn French from Remus, and of course, meet his baby sister. The pang of deep sadness he felt at the thought of never knowing the little girl Remus and Severus would raise nearly gave the game away, but he held himself in check.
Hermione jumped quite violently as someone sat down in the seat beside her, dropping a book down on the table. She looked over, a glare already in place, and saw Draco, who looked paler than she had ever seen him before.
“I know I have to be the one to defeat Voldemort, sir, so how do his plans to essentially take over the world not concern me?”
Hermione sat up straighter, looking ready to take in information like a sponge does water. “Why not your parents, or even Dumbledore himself? Wouldn’t they be of more help?”
“What we’re trying to say is that you shouldn’t worry about being in danger, but be prepared for some kind of attempt on your father’s part. It is simply a warning to be cautious, that’s all. We don’t mean to worry or frighten you,” Remus said reassuringly, glad when Severus reached up to grasp his hand appreciatively.
“Silence, Yaxley. I am well aware of what the Order of the Phoenix thinks they’ve gained by taking Malfoy in. It is no concern of mine; he knows nothing I care about.”
“Yeah, I’m ok. I just...I miss Ron. I miss us, all three of us, sitting around and talking or playing chess or doing homework. Everything is so different now. Don’t get me wrong, I like living with Severus and Remus, I do. I just miss how things used to be.” Harry shrugged, as if this wasn’t anything of importance, but Hermione knew better.
“Mr. Potter, you were only twelve and you were prepared to die?” Lucius asked, despite his decision to stay out of the conversation. He couldn’t fathom a twelve year old being able to accept his own death.
Draco shook his head and lifted a hand as if to stall his godfather. “No, I want to do this on my own. My father needs to understand how serious I am about Harry, and I don’t need a protector.”
“I’ve spoken with Molly and she agreed it would probably be best for their family to move back in for the summer as well. Being as close with you as they are, they are most certainly targets themselves. Grimmauld Place will keep them safe. Ms. Granger, however, will need to speak with her parents about joining us. The girl is hardly ever home to begin with; her parents might be a little reluctant to let her go. They’re home has been warded to the best of our abilities as well, so they do have some protection,” Severus explained to his son, who looked a little worried.
“Forgive me, Severus, but my reflexes are not what they used to be. I fear I would be more harmful than helpful with the search out on the grounds,” Albus said quietly, flicking his sleeve back so that his black and decaying hand was more visible. The black now stretched halfway up his pallid arm.
An ink drop dripped from his quill, making a perfectly round bubble of blackest ink. As Harry stared at the droplet of ink, it began to spread and dry, the parchment soaking it up like dry earth does rain. Another drop formed at the tip of his quill, and yet the words would not come.
S~S~S~S
“Remus...” Severus whispered, afraid to open the box, but beyond excited for what it could possibly mean.
As they passed the display of Quality Quidditch Supplies, Draco let out a deep sigh, frowning into his cup of cocoa.
“Oh Harry,
Hermione had four different aged and torn Daily Prophets strewn across one of the long tables in the library, a spell essentially highlighting important information she had discovered. What surprised Harry, though, was the stone pensieve that was so achingly familiar sitting innocently besides the Prophets.
Harry was waiting for the signal from his father, who he could see dueling with numerous Death Eaters about twenty feet away. He had torn off his Death Eater mask, no longer hiding his face. He wanted to lure Voldemort as close to Harry as they needed before the final steps of the plan went into play.
“That was so…so
The Order was not affording this right to only other Order, however. If they came across a Death Eater who was clearly dead, they would also shield the corpse. This had been a debate with many in the Order that Harry had firmly and staunchly won. Yes, they were Death Eaters, they were on the wrong side of the war, but they were also still fathers, sons, husbands – they still had loved ones who would claim their bodies when this was over, and Harry thought it was cruel to protect their own fallen, but not the others.
Harry was looking down at his schedule with a little less distaste than he would originally have upon seeing double Advanced Potions twice a week, of course with the Slytherins. Transfiguration, Charms, Astronomy, and Herbology along with the rigorous Potions classes wasn’t exactly the worst schedule, but he would definitely be busy.
Harry took a deep breath and wrapped the cloak closer around his still smaller-than-average frame and slipped out of Snape’s quarters, carefully closing the door behind him, which sealed into the wall once more. Harry groaned slightly as he realized he was going to have to use a locating charm again to find the door; all the dungeon walls looked the same, and he could never remember which one was really the door.
Draco found Harry curled up on their bed, shaking with sobs as he clutched desperately at a pillow. The blonde climbed onto the bed and pulled Harry into his arms, smoothing down his ruffled hair and whispering that things would be ok, that he’d see his father soon. But he didn’t know that. He couldn’t be sure anything would be ok, and with a sharp pang in his heart, he strongly doubted Harry would ever see Severus alive again.
“Last year in the Ministry, I was an unstable, desperate man. The Dark Lord had promised that, should we fail to retrieve the prophecy, we would pay dearly. I knew the worst thing I could lose was my family, so I did everything I could to succeed. I had convinced myself that the lives of six teenagers were not as important as the lives of my wife and son. My sister-in-law, Bellatrix, had already gone round the twist quite a few times by then, and her malice was completely genuine. I will admit I was shocked when she killed her own cousin, a pure blooded and powerful Wizard.
back to his father, who had a smug smile on his face. He sipped his tea leisurely as Draco scowled at Harry from his spot beside him on the sofa.
“I didn’t know anything about this, actually. And I’m not saying it because anyone told me to, I’m saying it because I know what’s like to be hunted and hurt by these people, and I don’t want to see any of the rest of you go through that.” Harry let his words set in as Jenicka and her friends stared at him open-mouthed. “See you in class, Ron.”
Harry smiled widely at his two friends, glad to have them close again. “I haven’t written back because Hedwig is on strike apparently, and the school owls were still off on their own summer holidays. No, I haven’t been in trouble. Draco is in a coma, and my skin is still intact. Now can we please go sit down?” Harry asked exasperatedly as he nodded towards the Great Hall, where students were flooding in after the carriage rides from the Hogsmead train station.
“You’re bloody gorgeous when you’re pissed off,” Draco said quietly, the smirk taking over his face even as Harry blushed a bright crimson and tried to look away. “Oh you’re going to play coy now, are you? Remember, I have
“I’m...fine, I guess. I’m just really confused. I do remember everything, but the memories are sort of clashing. It’s hard to remember hating you in the past, and loving you now. I need to time to...adjust, I guess. I’m sorry, Harry, I know that’s the last thing you want to here after all the things we’ve been going through, but I really need to sort things out for myself. I’m not breaking up with you; I just need some space for right now, alright?” Draco asked, feeling his chest constrict as the Gryffindor tried to blink his tears away, but was unsuccessful.
“We’ve found out where the potion is being developed. You-Know-Who is a fool, because although the potion is complete, it hasn’t been released yet. We have to hurry, before Moreau figures out we’re onto him,” Dedalus whispered as he used the spell to locate the correct door. He moved through the confusing Department like it was no more confusing than his own home. Tonks
With another flick of his wand, the flames were gone, and the wardrobe stood as it had before, no damage to it whatsoever. The doors were rattling faintly, and Tom was staring at it in fear.
” A strong gust of wind redirected the curse back at Ron, who ducked just in time and let the curse hit a bookshelf behind him, which promptly exploded all over the place.
There was a shield in place in Harry’s mind, but having been distracted by his headache he didn’t pull the block up in time. He watched in rapidly developing horror as Draco watched and heard every word of the Prophecy from Dumbledore on that fateful night of the Ministry fiasco. Too panicked to concentrate enough, Harry couldn’t push Draco out in time before the spell was broken. It was too late though; Draco had stayed just long enough to hear the full Prophecy.
“The stone came from the west tower,” Harry informed the Professor before jumping on his broom once more, and taking off around the side of the castle, towards the offending tower. As he streaked through the sky, he saw the blue glow of a Patronus being sent off towards the Professor’s camps, and sped as quickly to the ground as he could as he saw two shapes near the base of the tower; one kneeling, the other lying down. There were bits of stone littered around the two Professors, and Harry felt his heart stop as he landed and saw his father lying unconscious on the ground, blood coming from his head and his leg crushed under a large bit of stone. Remus was kneeling beside him, murmuring to himself as he checked his husband’s vitals and tried to think of the best way to remove the stone from the man’s leg without aggravating the injury. His neck cricked as he heard Harry land and watched him rush to the Potions Master’s side.
“What the hell was that all about?” Draco asked in a huff, making Hermione giggle from beside him. He glared at her, too.
S~S~S~S
night,” Draco said, sending an apologetic look to Harry, who shrugged with a sad smile.
“You’ll see,” Draco hedged. They walked across the grounds, past Hagrid’s hut and pumpkin patch, past the greenhouses, and over a steep slope just behind the castle.
After ten minutes of silence, a faint popping noise was heard as a tall man in a patched up tweed suit Apparated a few feet from Albus and Severus.
“I do think you are advanced enough, Harry. You have proved it time and again in your Defence classes and life experiences. No other sixteen-year-old boy has duelled and won more fights with Death Eaters and Voldemort himself than you,” Severus said, the pride in his voice shocking even himself.
. That is likely why his moods shift as quickly as they do; he is so afraid of disappointing you that he shields his insecurity by turning it into anger. He doesn’t even know who you are, Harry, but he knows he wants you in his life, and that having you walk out of it would tear him apart. Call it careful observation, but I can clearly see you’ve got him hooked.” Severus noted Harry’s blush as the Gryffindor still tried to avoid direct eye contact.
“What’s this, Hermione?” Ron asked as he pointed to a column in the diagram labelled ‘Wool’s Orphanage – blanket(?)’
Severus rolled his eyes, a genuine smile on his face. He was about to respond when he finally realized there were other people in the library. “We have an audience, Remus,” he said in a stage whisper.
Harry turned so that he was facing Snape, his knees still pulled firmly up to his chest. This was the hardest part – the part where he left himself open, vulnerable. This is where he trusted Snape more than he ever had before. He glanced up at last and met the deep, dark eyes of his Professor. They seemed a little brighter than usual, which nearly shocked Harry into silence.
Severus thought for a moment. Harry would probably being stay here for a few more days at the least, which means they would need sustenance, and calling Dobby to help them every time they needed a meal prepared just wasn’t very convenient. “Bring the materials here, and while you’re at it, bring enough food for about two weeks. It would not be very convenient nor safe to keep calling you here.”
, there’s no way I could ever be neutral. He’s a bloody hypocrite as well,” Draco snapped, glaring at nothing in particular at the memory.
“Come Harry, we must be quick with this information, especially if Severus is none the wiser yet.” Remus glanced around nervously before leaning close to Harry’s ear and whispering, “Lucius Malfoy was probably one of the escaped Death Eaters, Harry. He’s probably making a hasty line towards Hogwarts to get to Draco.”
“The right.”
Harry sighed, not wanting to explain that to his boyfriend. He was terrified that Draco would think he was insane and leave him when he found out the truth. “I just had a nightmare last night. Last year...it’s really complicated, Draco.”
“I guess I can try to be happy for you, but you can’t expect me to get all buddy-buddy with Malfoy, or think of Snape as anything but the dungeon bat.”
“Thank you, Sirius,” was all Remus could get out before the lump in his throat cut off all other hope of speech and he turned abruptly in his seat, fighting back tears of mingled grief and relief.
“Harry, are you alright?”
Sirius and Harry were still wrapped around one another in a hug, soft murmuring coming from Sirius as he ran a hand through the teen’s hair affectionately. They heard a soft sniffle as Harry nodded against his godfather’s chest in answer to whatever Sirius had said.
Harry sighed as he looked up from the stack of parchments and shook his head. “I...I don’t know, it’s all so...complicated. I don’t think I’m going to be very much help, sir; this is all beyond me.”
Severus gently brushed Remus’ hair out of his eyes, placing another chaste kiss on the man’s lips. “You won’t. Keep Draco in the castle, even if you have to tie him down.”
Hermione laughed even harder as she pulled out her wand and aimed it at Harry’s clothing, giving it a complicated twirl that turned his dressing gown into a simple black shirt, and his sleep pants into jeans. “Next time, put some clothes on. I’m sure Dumbledore wouldn’t appreciate you streaking across the castle again.”
“Would you mind, Hermione? I should go check on Severus, before the idiot does something stupid,” Remus asked, rubbing his face roughly to try and inspire some sanity back into the situation.
“You don’t remember anything from the past few months, do you?” Harry croaked, feeling his heart drop down to his toes. It was like losing Draco all over again, and he wasn’t sure if he could handle that again.
charm, and it is indeed on the map and well known as the Weasley residence. If Voldemort plans to go after Harry again, I believe the first place he would look is the Burrow. Grimmauld Place is not ideal because there would be no one there to help make sure Harry is safe. Though you are sometimes summoned to Voldemort, you are usually home during the summer. This cottage is unplottable, unknown to anyone expect three other Order members, myself, and now Harry, and is under many wards and the
The last week of term before Christmas break flew by, at least for Harry. His exams were fairly easy, and he was sure he had done well in all his classes. He was growing ever more nervous for the interview with the Casewitch from Wizarding Family Services, which was in just another week’s time. Not knowing what was to be asked scared him more than anything. How was he supposed to prepare himself if he had no idea what to expect?
“Why...We should have
Harry shrugged and set his book aside, not catching the undercurrents travelling thickly across the room. “Yeah sure, why not.”
“Dobby!”
Harry waited as Draco said goodnight to his father, then joined him, Severus, and Remus as they made their way back to the castle and down into the dungeons. Harry felt himself relax considerably as Draco took his hand and walked closely beside him.
“Those of us who truly care about you as a person do not expect you to defeat him singlehandedly. We’re trying to do everything we can to help you, Harry, but you’re blocking us at every angle. Do you remember when you broke the wards around the Quidditch pitch to break up the stone that was heading towards the Professors? You thought you were doing the right thing then, too, but you put all of your classmates in danger in order to try to save the Professors. You can’t save the world alone, and we don’t expect you to. You have to learn to let people help you,” Remus said earnestly. When would Harry ever learn that he wasn’t in this alone?
“So we’re all going to stay at Hogwarts after this year?”
“Thanks, Neville!”
Harry took a deep breath, willing his cheeks to stop burning as he looked up at met the Potions Master’s eyes. “Would...would it be alright if I called you dad after the adoption goes through?” he asked once more, gulping loudly. He was prepared for Snape to scoff at him and refuse, but he needed to ask, if only for his own peace of mind.
Severus hid his satisfied smirk behind his tea cup. He knew he’d be able to persuade his godson, even if it was by guilt. “I’ve been teaching Harry Occlumency on and off for two years now and he is almost ready to be classified as proficient. I was hoping to keep tutoring him to strengthen his shields, but I’m just not in any sort of condition to go delving into other’s minds. This is what I need from you Draco; help Harry strengthen his shields since I cannot.”
“These wards are very important, and so a very limited amount of people are aware of them. Therefore, it would be better if we performed the bonding between Harry and Severus now, in private, rather than make it a public affair. Are we all agreeable to this?” The Headmaster asked with a warm smile, his sleeves rolled up as he twirled his wand happily in his one healthy hand.
There was a long silence, broken by the scrapping of Harry’s empty tea cup being placed on the coffee table. “Please don’t call me that,” Harry whispered, gaining a very sad look from Molly and a blush from Arthur. He glanced at Snape and was surprised to find a reproving frown on the man’s face.
The room broke out in sounds of approval and delight, a few of the professors standing to congratulate Severus with a hand shake or a slap on the back. The noise suddenly went quiet as the Headmaster entered the staff room, his icy blue eyes meeting Severus’ from across the room.
Dumbledore suddenly appeared and looked around to assess the damage before spotting Draco lying on the ground and Snape advancing on Harry, who was being held protectively against Remus’ chest. “Severus, the boy needs the hospital. I will deal with Harry,” the old man instructed in a too calm voice.
Remus looked over at Snape, who had been watching to whole scene from the other side of the room. He met the man’s black eyes and read what the man could never admit; he cared about Harry, and he was worried. Remus took a deep breath before mouthing the words ‘Thank you’ at Snape, who nodded slowly, his expression no longer guarded.
Well, that did make more sense than completely halting thought altogether, but it didn’t change the fact that Harry still had no idea how to go about doing that.”I’m not sure I understand, sir. What am I suppose to occupy my mind with if not thought?” Harry asked. He really did want to learn Occlumency, but Snape was going to have to learn how to be a better instructor if they were to get anything done within the century.
“You’re much feistier, I must say. Less dumb bravery and more spice. It must be my son’s influence on you,” said Lucius, a cross between a smile and sneer gracing his aristocratic face. He reached into his robes slowly, lifting the edge to show Harry that he wasn’t reaching for a wand, but something that looked like a packet of parchment. It unfurled as he held it out, and Harry blushed as he recognized the issue of the
“Of course it will be your serum, Severus. However, I do not think you should be there. There are too many emotional strings between the two of you, and I cannot risk the interrogation going astray because of your presence.”
“He said he trusts my abilities and has every faith in me. I was quite surprised by it as well but...I agreed to do it.” Harry chuckled as Ron pumped his fist into the air in celebration, causing Hermione to roll her eyes.
“I will try to do better, Albus, but I swear on the life of my son that if
be careful. Stay out of the thick of it as much as you can, and don’t act the hero, you hear me?”
“I love you too, Moony. Have you and Dad thought of baby names yet?”
“Snape has always hated me. This summer, something changed between us – shifted. He respected me and I him. I think we finally understood each other for once, and I went and bollixed it all up. I could have killed Draco...Whatever understanding we had before is gone now, and I don’t think I can fix it again.” Harry looked up at Remus, his eyes red-rimmed and haunted looking. “Why do I care so damn much, and why does it hurt so bad?”
Harry reached under the tree and pulled out a gift that looked to be the shape and size of a book. He handed it to Remus and smiled shyly, but offered no explanation until Remus had carefully torn away the paper to reveal a beautiful glittering picture frame, sans picture, that had the word ‘family’ engraved on it in ornate letters.
“Very well, take as much time as you need. This is not something to enter into lightly, so be absolutely sure you’re positive about whomever you choose. I can arrange for Molly and Arthur to come and speak to you if you’d prefer that over sending owls back and forth.” Severus felt a twinge of jealously run up his spine, hating that he was allowing these feelings any room at all. He would assist Harry in making the best choice possible; he would not be biased by his growing affection for the boy he once loathed.
“Sorry, Poppy. We were having an Occlumency lesson and his shields broke down. I was ejected quite roughly from his psyche before he passed out cold. I think he may have hit his head when he fell as well. His pulse is much too quick. I’m not sure what happened,” Severus tried to explain, hating how his voice sounded so worried even to his own ears.
Harry shivered and pulled the sheet tighter around himself, still struggling to regain his warmth after being caked in ice for hours. He offered a weak smile, reaching a hand out towards his parents. His arm was covered in dried blood as well, but the wound from the blade was curiously healed. “It’s me, Moony. I suppose I have a lot of explaining to do.”
“You’ll catch your death out here,” Severus said quietly, coming to stand beside the werewolf looking out over the ramparts of the castle. It was a long way down from there.
morning to get in his face about it? Obviously, the sudden attack by Parkinson, Crabbe, and Goyle must have something to do with it, but what exactly? Snape had seemed...a little concerned? Nah, he must be imagining things due to sleep deprivation.
After the room had cleared, Severus stepped towards Remus, who shook his head emphatically and aimed a cleaning spell at the Potions Master’s robes. He looked up into Severus’ eyes, but there was nothing there but despair and an emptiness that terrified him.
S~S~S~S
Harry tried to stop thinking of anything but that forest clearing. He added in some low flying sparrows and a soft level of birdsong into the scene that Snape had woven for him. He imagined himself wandering around the clearing, the wind blowing in his hair and the dry leaves tickling his arms as they floated on by. It was a pleasant temperature and a wonderful thought to get lost in. He hadn’t even realized that Snape had placed a hand on each of his temples and was now seeing the same scene that Harry currently was.
Severus thought for a moment before nodding. “That would be fine, I guess. Who would have thought
“Then we have something in common, Potter, because I think you've been completely unfair to Draco. Go back to bed so I can speak with Draco in peace.”
“Well, actually, I do have one, but without inside help there’d really be no way to pull it off.”
Remus chuckled and nodded as he stood up and quickly made his way down the hall into their shared bedroom. He went straight to the nightstand and opened the door, ruffling around in the random stuff before finding the tarnished and worn pocket watch. He quickly stuffed it in a pocket, and walked back out to the sitting room, which still lacked Draco and Severus. He walked over to Harry and held out the watch, making sure Harry quickly stashed it away in his jacket pocket.
Severus quirked an eyebrow as he reentered the room and heard Harry speaking to his jewelry. “Were you just conversing with your watch, Harry?” he asked, a scalding cup of tea balanced in his hand.
Remus could tell nothing was going to be found out if Severus and Tonks continued to communicate, so he took the burden on himself. “Dora, has Dumbledore spoken with the boy yet?”
Severus pulled his wand slowly as he tried to recover from the shock. He became aware of his jaw hanging open and quickly shut it as he took a tentative step forward. He needed to find Harry, make sure he was ok, and get him out of there as soon as possible. Severus felt distinctly confused as he moved around what used to be the front door of the house. He had not been summoned to any meetings recently, and had heard no news of a planned attack on the Potter boy from the Dark Lord or any of his other minions. Being one of His closest inner-circle followers, it was strange that he had not been informed of this attack. Something boded ill about his being unawares, and he proceeded with great caution.
“So, have you gotten over all of your misgivings about this little party Molly is insisting on?” Remus asked as he sat down beside Harry and across from Ron. He shifted a few of the stacks of notes, looking at how far the boys had gotten through them. The book on Soul Magic hadn’t really made any more sense to him than it had to Harry or Ron, and he was curious to know if they’d found anything useful.
Hermione frowned, her bushy curls crackling with the flames. “I’m guessing you can’t tell us exactly where you are, either? We don’t even know who answered the floo, as they fled the room before we could see.”
he still want to be an Auror? At this point, he was basically an unofficial Auror with the biggest and most difficult task to complete; kill off Voldemort. Would his passion for hunting out Dark Wizards fade after he succeeded in getting rid of Voldemort, or would it become his new hobby? He wasn’t sure of any of the answers, but he knew he had to find out soon. Harry was pulled out of his reverie as Snape laid an official looking envelope with the Hogwarts crest on the table between them.
“Would you just shut
“Draco wanted to apologize to you both, but he wanted to do it separately. But that’s a good thing, because I need your help with something,” Harry said quickly, his voice much quieter than he normally spoke.
Severus couldn’t help but let a little smile sit on his lips as he watched Harry look around, amazed at all he could see. “No problem, Harry, no problem at all.”
Draco immediately began pulling the clothes out, examining the nice button down shirts and simple trousers as well as the soft cloak and emerald green robes. He studied the boots and ran a hand over the leather appreciatively as he smiled at his godfather. “Thanks, Sev. I was getting pretty sick of wearing Harry’s clothes. Boy dresses like the heathen he is.”
Hermione sighed exasperatedly as she set aside her quill and turned to face Draco properly. She’d been pretty worried about Harry all day, but seeing as how he ditched all of his classes, she figured he wanted to be alone, so she hadn’t gone searching for him like she so wanted to.
It took a second for Harry to realize that Ron had spoken in Parseltongue, as the language was indistinguishable from English to Harry. Not for the first time, he wondered what it sounded like to those who couldn’t speak or understand the language. “Well you still shouldn’t go alone.”
“I love you,” Harry whispered, hugging each of his parents in turn once more, feeling a lump rise in his throat. He wished they would leave quickly, before he had a chance to fall apart and change his mind.
“Harry, how did this come about, exactly? He’s only been awake for what, two and a half weeks?” Hermione asked, her brow creased in confusion.
Harry felt his stomach drop and his pulse speed up as he tried not to show his panic outwardly. This was one topic Harry knew he should definitely not talk to Draco about without Snape’s express permission, but he couldn’t exactly refuse to answer without making Draco suspicious, and if he lied about it now, Draco would be hurt and angry with Harry when he finally did learn the truth. He was torn.
“We were just talking about you, actually,” said Remus, gauging the Slytherin’s reaction as he bypassed the coffee and went for the tea instead, much like Remus himself.
“It’s nothing, Dad. Just forget it,” Harry said quietly, burying his nose in the Daily Prophet, though he didn’t take in a single word of it. He never paid any mind to the rubbish they posted anyways.
Severus shook his head firmly, his hand still resting lightly on Harry’s arm. “Harry, they are not your crimes to apologize for. By the time Lily had stopped speaking to me, I was so steeped in the Dark Arts that I believed calling her a Mudblood was ok. I’m glad she disassociated with me when she did, or else I might have hurt her worse. I am not proud of my youth, and I am not innocent of paying your father and Black back for everything they did to me. You are not your father, or your godfather, and it has taken me this long to realize and admit that. Now you need to come to terms with it as well.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dumbledore’s blue eyes no longer held any trace of their twinkle as he sat up straight and watched Harry pace. “When do you suppose I should have brought it up? Perhaps after I first suspected, when Ginny Weasley was recovering in hospital your second year? Or maybe in your third year, when you were worried sick that an escaped mass murderer was out to kill you? Oh, but there was always your fourth year, when you were forced to compete in a competition with students much older and cleverer than yourself, and then watched the Dark Lord rise once more and kill Cedric Diggory. Perhaps last year would have been best, after you lost your godfather, got your friends injured and almost killed, and learned for the first time that it was you, Harry, who had to be the one to kill Voldemort in the end? Tell me, when would you have preferred I let you know my unconfirmed suspicions that Voldemort was essentially immortal?”
“Harry? Is everything alright?”
you, he’s just upset and extremely stubborn, not to mention thick-headed. He can’t get over his prejudices, no matter how much anybody tries to convince him that Professor Snape and Draco aren’t evil reincarnate. Ginny doesn’t hate you either; she’s just hurt because she thinks you’ve chosen Draco over her. She still has feelings for you, you know,” Hermione explained, even as she scribbled away without pause on her own Charms essay. Her skills for multitasking were definitely enviable.
Hey readers, old and new!
Harry gulped and looked away from the searching blue eyes, feeling his stomach churn in panic. Dumbledore was acting very strange, and it was making Harry distinctly uncomfortable. “I...I dunno, sir. Professor Snape had it at first, but he didn’t tell me what he did with it, out of protection from Voldemort seeing where it was if he invaded my mind again.”
“Hold on just a few minutes, Draco. There is no way in Salazar’s name that I am leaving my quarters in my night clothes,” Severus said with a slight smirk. He and Remus went to go change their clothes as Harry pulled Draco into his room, changing his own clothes as well.
“Indeed they are, my boy. After Tom was denied the Defence position the first time, he surprised all by wasting his talents to work for Borgin and Burke’s down Knockturn Alley. He worked as a buyer, convincing people to part with their beloved dark artefacts and bringing them back to the shop. He worked there for almost a year before completely disappearing. No one knows where Tom was at the time, but when he re-emerged, he had already begun to demand he be addressed as Lord Voldemort.”
Harry scoffed as he glared at Draco, his arms crossed over his chest. “Oh, that’s such bollocks! Chatting him up? Snape’s the straightest man on the planet! No, I take that back, Snape is asexual; it just doesn’t happen to him.”
need to know that!”
“This is really it. The war, it’s starting again,” said Ron. His face was drawn and tired, and he pulled Hermione close as she shuddered.
It felt like a weight had lifted off his shoulders as he listened to Snape’s slow, deep voice reassure him. He wondered what would have happened if his mother would have swayed Snape from the Dark Arts instead of leaving him behind for James. Would he possibly have Snape as a father and not James? Or were Snape and Lily destined not to end up together? “Things might have been really different if you’d stayed friends with my mum. You loved her, I know you did,” Harry said softly, now avoiding Snape’s eyes.
They both laughed as they continued on their journey down to the dungeons, feeling much more light-hearted now than they had at the beginning of the evening. Not even the imminent danger of Snape’s death glare and scathing remarks could take away Harry’s good mood.
Harry hadn’t realized he was crying so hard until Severus – his
Harry shrugged and nodded, blinking a few times before catching Draco’s eyes. He felt the first signs of Draco’s presence and used the same way of focusing his magic through his eyes as he did before. Suddenly, he was watching a memory that was not only
“Hmm,” was all Severus offered in regard to that bit of drama. Maybe the article was worth a read after all if it included Harry as well. “And your other piece of evening post, who was that missive from?” he asked solicitously.
“Pensieve memories of the meetings and raids. Because I wasn’t actually giving him the specific information, it wasn’t technically breaking any of the oaths or vows. I was having a hard time separating the memories out, though, because I’m not a very good Occlumens. Once I finally got all of them separated and into vials for Malfoy, I had already been there for more than a week. After that, it took him another week to watch them all, and then give them back to me. Once I had them all back, he began to try to question me without breaking any of the vows or oaths. We actually had fun trying to figure out ways to ask and answer the questions,” Tonks said with a smirk as she sipped at the cup of tea that Remus had passed her.
“Yes, Severus, but they’re both fine. Ms. Granger is, however, traumatised after having to befoul the castle and blast a wall open to save her significant other from a very horrible death indeed. We are supposed to be protecting these children, Albus, keeping them out of harm’s way! We cannot focus on the war outside of these walls if we cannot control the one taking place within them.”
As Draco made to leave, a strange gurgling from the pipes gave him pause. He stood and listened for a moment before deciding it was nothing of concern. He realized this was a mistake when he turned his back, and seconds later became drenched in less than sanitary water.
“Single, married, divorced, widowed – I guess single is my only option, then. They frown upon single parent adoptions, though,” said Severus as he checked the box next to ‘single’ with his quill. He’d just gotten back from flooing over to the Department of Children Services and Adoptions to get an application for adopting Harry. Remus had met up with him for a bit of tea and was helping to fill out the application.
“He’s not my friend,” both Harry and Ron snapped at the same time, glaring at each other. Hermione bit her lip in worry and annoyance as she looked between her two best friends, feeling extremely torn over whom to side with, if anyone at all.
of them – as long as I’m around. You do realize what this really means, right?”
The teens were all lost in thought for a while, trying to come up with more ideas. It seemed near impossible, trying to figure out what these things could be and where they could be. Harry was surprised Hermione had come up with as much as she had. Sure she was a genius, but this was far beyond any Charms test or difficult potion to brew.
“What the hell, Draco? You didn’t need to punch him! He was leaving; there was no need!” Harry hissed, not wanting to attract the attention of any of the adults and explain exactly why Ron was sporting a fat lip now.
“Is he awake? Mum’s going ballistic at Headquarters; someone needs to go give her a Calming Draught.”
“I can’t find Harry. He was in his room all night, and now he’s not there,” Severus said, trying not to panic as he thought of all the places his son could be. What worried him the most was the fact that he had not witnessed his son leaving his room or their quarters. Had he been that engrossed in grading, or was it something else entirely?
“Have you talked to him about it, Harry? Maybe it’s not just Remus’ absence that’s bothering him.”
is my home.”
“To be honest, sir, in a real fight, you wouldn’t give your foe time to prepare for attack; you’d just attack.”
“I want to ask you not because you’re a last resort, but because I know you’ll do everything in your power to protect me and take care of me, and not just because you’ve taken a vow to do so. I’m asking you to adopt me because I think you need me as much as I need you, and it’s nice to feel needed.” Harry practically held his breath, wanting to turn away and squeeze his eyes closed as he waited for Snape’s answer. Surely it would be easier to take if he didn’t have to look the man in the eye when he said –
“Well, that might be because it’s a controversial and not widely accepted theory on Occlumency and Legilimency. Most people think it’s circumstantial, really, but I’ve had it done to me enough times by my father to firmly believe that it’s fact. He would always use that to catch me in a lie by using trails from my projected memories to find out the truth. Not until I learned to constantly shield was I able to lie to him without him knowing,” Draco explained, shivering at the memory of his father manipulating his mind constantly to find out the truth.
“Albus has appointed you as Deputy Headmaster, since I now have the position of Headmistress. For the time being, I will continue to do both jobs because there is not enough time to train you in all of the duties. This summer we will remedy that.”
“I see. Well, Mr. Weasley, I think a detention is in order, which you will serve with me. That will also be twenty points from Gryffindor, and you will apologize to Professor Lupin –
“I love you too.” Severus watched as Remus left the Headmaster’s office, hopefully heading down to the dungeons to collect Draco, where he was supposed to be.
‘Transfiguration- Exceeds Expectations
Scowling, Draco pushed himself away from the wall and approached the transparent young woman, who had floated down to his level. “‘Dear Harry’ is just fine, and yes, I know him
“You will take a dose of Dreamless Sleep tonight. If you have the dream again, it will be painfully obvious that it is not, in fact, a dream at all, and then we will have much bigger problems to deal with. Do you understand?”
“Of course, but I’m ready. We need to find these things, Draco, before it’s too late. Voldemort has been too quiet lately, and that makes me more nervous than anything. What I’m most worried about is everyone else. I was ready to agree with Molly and insist that you, Ron and Hermione stayed here. I’m terrified something is going to happen to one of you. Remus and I will be under Polyjuice, but the rest of you are just using Notice-Me-Not charms. It doesn’t feel like enough. But I’m so scared what happened to you last time will happen again – ”
“Concerning our relationship, he hasn’t had much time to get used to it, nor has he seen us interact with each other very much. He knows that you say you love me, and I love you, but he’s yet to really witness that love. He’ll know one way or the other, that this isn’t just some passing phase. Forever, and I meant it,” Harry said firmly, leaning down to kiss Draco tenderly on the lips, his fingers sliding through silky blonde hair.
“I will do all of those things,” Peter croaked, his fingers clenching involuntarily around Harry’s smaller, youthful fingers. His regret and remorse for all of the pain he had caused this poor child surged through him, and he met the greenest eyes he had ever seen aside from Lily’s. “I’m so sorry…”
“How can they possibly ask you to leave three days before term is to start again? You have classes to teach, students to watch over! Dumbledore is cracked, Remus! Why do you just go along with everything he asks of you? Grow a spine, Lupin, and tell him
“Yes, the diary from the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore destroyed another one as well. So technically, there’s four more besides the piece still residing in Voldemort himself. Not quite as daunting as six, but still a little crazy,” Harry said with a weak laugh.
Up two flights of stairs, Harry pulled out the map and did a quick check once more. He didn’t see anything out of the ordinary, so he folded it up and kept on his way. He finally reached the infirmary and carefully opened the tall doors, hoping the hinges did not squeak, which was quite common in the old school. He let out a relieved breath as he made it through the door without a peep.
Footsteps circled around Severus as he kneeled and trembled. It had already been fifteen minutes and, from his welcome and current position, it was clear that his cover was blown and he was not safe – at all. He hoped in the back of his mind that Dumbledore had received his message and sent someone to watch over Harry, not really sparing a thought for the possibility of some sort of rescue mission for himself; he knew it was over, and he just wanted to know that Harry was safe still.
“When Severus adopted Harry, I was quite upset that I could not offer to be his guardian because of my condition. Severus and I had been dating since the summer, and…and Severus asked me to marry him. That way, the warding included me as a guardian to Harry because we were all bonded to each other.”
“It’ll be alright, Harry. No matter what happens, you’ll always have people to talk to and rely on. If we do stay at Grimmauld Place, we’ll just have to make some new, better memories to replace the old ones, ok?” Draco said with a grin, pulling Harry close for a quick snog before they entered the Potion Master’s dungeon quarters.
“How was your day? Any luck with the levitation spell?” Harry asked as two house elves popped into the infirmary with plates of food. Harry sat his plate down beside Draco’s on the little spindly table where they had eaten together for the last week.
Draco’s eyebrow rose slowly, his expression clearly stating that he thought Severus had gone insane. He shook his head once more, than looked up at Severus as if in recognition. “I’m only eight, Sev.”
“I love you.”
“Ron!” Hermione admonished as Harry took hold of Draco’s arm to prevent him from pulling his wand.
“Take him out of here,” Severus choked out, referring to the blonde still clawing desperately at Remus’ arms. The werewolf looked up into his husband’s eyes, which were haunted and dead looking.
Remus sat up and graciously took the tea and potion smiling warmly at the Potions Master. “Thank you, Severus. How long have I been out?” he asked as he took a cautious sip of the warm tea.
Harry shrugged as he rubbed his tired eyes. “I have no idea, really. Maybe it tried to go to you, but the wards on your rooms stopped it. There’s the owl,” he said, pointing needlessly to the large eagle owl still perched on Severus’ armchair.
“Not technically, but it’s close enough. Hence why we are reluctant to try without knowing for sure if it’s going to work,” Lucius explained, glaring at the offending griffin statuette in the centre of the table they had all gathered around in the library.
Remus watched as the dark haired man stood up and pulled on his dressing gown, closing the door a little too firmly on his way out. He was positive the man would be entering their son’s bedroom to look over the Gryffindor, and his heart ached with the knowledge of it.
Harry sat heavily on the recently dust covered sofa and patted the seat next to him for Remus to take. “How did they get the hairs for the Polyjuice potion?” Harry thought to ask. He had gone along with the Polyjuice plan quickly and gladly, as long as it kept his father safe, but he never really thought about how they were going to turn themselves into lesser Death Eaters.
Harry nodded, even though he knew Sirius couldn’t see him. He felt when his godfather moved away, missing his presence immediately. Harry was alone now, and Voldemort was not far. He was getting too close to Severus for Harry’s liking, so he quickly pulled back his hood, took a deep breath, and yelled.
Harry shrugged as he looked over at the Headmaster, setting his cloak back on the coffee table. “I’m not so sure I’ll be needing a broom anymore; I don’t see myself playing Quidditch this year, Professor.”
Remus held him close and sighed contently before releasing the young Gryffindor. “You’re very welcome, Harry.”
Hermione’s eyes were wide and disbelieving as she stared at Harry after Snape had moved away to berate a Slytherin about a melted cauldron. When the bell rang shortly after, Hermione quickly caught up with Harry. “That was…well, it was
“Are you alright, Remus?”
It was Molly’s turn to choke up as she pat Harry gently on the cheek, sniffling into a handkerchief she pulled from an apron pocket. “I love you too, Harry dear. I could not have asked for a better surrogate son.”
“You know, I never did get to do any holiday shopping. I wonder if Sev would let us go to Hogsmeade to grab a few things,” Draco said thoughtfully as he placed his favourite wool jumper on a hanger in the wardrobe. Hmm...he actually remembered he had a favourite jumper. Well, that was a new one.
“I did not think it was important for you to know, Harry. What with the weight of the Prophecy, I believed you already had too much on your shoulders as it was. I did not want to add the stress of this as well. You’re just a boy, Harry – ”
The hearth in the drawing room was still unlit when Severus entered, carefully closing the door behind him. Remus was sitting on the edge of one of the sofas, his face in his hands. He looked up at Severus as the man walked over and sat down beside him, wanting very much to embrace him, but somehow knowing he needed a little space right then.
“No talking. You have fifteen minutes to complete the quiz. If anybody needs more time than that, you clearly didn’t revise enough. There will be a potion to brew after the quiz, so I suggest you get it out of the way as quickly as possible. As this is a double period, you will have an hour and forty-five minutes to work on your potions. You will need it, as we’re beginning time-release potions this week. Next week, we will begin on long-term potions, which will be projects that will count for thirty percent of your grades. Get to work.”
“Ok, I can do that. How are we going to explain everything to him? He’ll want to know everything that’s happened since he went through that stupid arch.”
Merlin, he already sounded like he was Harry’s father, not to mention acted like it, too. Buying the boy clothes, making sure he looked decent for the company arriving soon, and admonishing him for the length of his shower time? It was absurd and yet, Severus knew he would learn to miss it if Harry did decide to ask the Weasleys to adopt him, and not himself. What was he even thinking;
Remus nodded solemnly, grasping Severus’ hand in his own. “I know. I promise.” Remus looked over and saw Draco, who looked extremely uncomfortable. He could see it in the teen’s eyes; this Draco was someone different, someone who didn’t quite fit in anymore. This was a combination of the old Draco and the new Draco, and he wasn’t sure how to act or think.
Harry didn’t get a chance to respond before Ron and Hermione left the room, leaving him with a ball of self-loathing and guilt in the pit of his stomach. Perhaps Ron was right; how would he feel if the situation were reversed? He needed to find Draco.
“I love you too.”
He took a quick meal in the kitchens, a little lost in his own home without the help of his house elves. He had no idea where the creatures had gone, but he hoped they had fled to safety rather than being killed in much the same fashion his wife had been. The food he was chewing tasted like ash, and he only forced himself to swallow it out of necessity for his health and energy. The pepper-up potion he had taken after his shower would not hold him over forever.
“Call him whatever you feel comfortable calling him. I don’t think that it offends Professor Lupin that you don’t call him ‘Dad’. You might want to discuss it with him, Harry. Maybe he prefers for you to just call him Remus,” Hermione said, matter of fact as she flipped through her Transfiguration book for the sixth time that lunch period.
“But they do. Kids at school, especially Slytherins, think I’m this big show off when I learn difficult spells ten times faster than everyone except Hermione. Draco does too, and he even knows
“I do. It…was a curse of his own creation, actually. I’m not sure how other Death Eaters got a hold of it, but I can guess. I don’t know the counter curse, though, and I’m fairly sure Severus is the only one who does,” Remus explained, feeling completely useless. If only they could figure out a way to wake Severus up long enough to ask him what the counter curse was.
Remus moved forward and touched the tip of his wand to Albus’ and Severus’ linked hands, waiting for Albus to initiate the Vow.
“Go to Dumbledore, tell him I’ve brought Severus back to the cottage and am treating him now.”
Severus frowned as he moved forward and lifted Harry’s chin, forcing him to meet his eyes. “We will help you with this, Harry, I promise, but it will take time to figure out. I’m just as anxious to get it done as well, but rushing will only increase the chances of failure. Be patient and diligent; it will pay off in the end.”
