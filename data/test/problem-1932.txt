His mumbled words cause Andrea’s eyes to widen, a hand shooting to her mouth. I am shocked as well by the blankness he talks about this as if it’s as normal as the weather. Meanwhile Draco is fiddling with the holdings of his sling. He manages to get it open enough to wriggle his left arm out of it. A short look at the thick scars peaking from under his sleeve garners a sigh then he transfers the tool into his left hand. The right one reaches down to Shenan’s feet. She starts to lift the hoof he is aiming for on her own and he praises her softly for it. She snorts as he grabs the hoof and starts to clean it in slow, halting motions.
I chuckle, “You switched from supporting me during the war to fighting for the rights of death eaters. Am I supposed to feel offended?”
Ten minutes later we are sitting on the sofa with tea in front of us and Teddy cuddled into my chest.
“I guess so, but I would like to have the charges told me directly as is my right,” he responds calmly.
“At least he screamed this time. He made his panic air instead of swallowing it down. Should we count this as a victory?” she wearily tries to see the positive side.
“You should maybe look into getting him proper riding lessons instead of the therapy?” Andrea says, “Or maybe in addition might be better for now.”
He huffs, but nonetheless goes back to brushing the horse’s fur. I smile at the picture. Still he shies and moves away to another spot of the horse every time Andrea comes close to him. She finishes soon and lets him continue touching the palomino while she puts the cloth and belt from last time back on Shenan. Draco gives a disgruntled noise as I pull him away from the horse after a motion from Andrea. Hermione follows us as we make our way to the riding hall. The therapist puts the rope on again as well as she leads Shenan behind us. Draco reaches out to one or two other horse noses along the way.
“It’s just since I can’t ask Dumbledore anymore who Spy A is, I wanted to find whoever is behind the second handwriting who continued the reports after the headmaster’s death.”
“…you never expected Draco Malfoy to do anything by hand, especially something where he could get dirty, right?” he refuses to make eye contact, but I can see the self-deprecating smile on his lips.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” I grumble but look down at the questions written out on the paper, “Alright, uhm…”
“No, of course not,” she soothes, “What I meant to say is that his body is going to heal, yes, but the risk is high that his mind never will. He is operating on little more than instincts and muscle memory right now. The rest of his mind has shut down after all the trauma he went through.”
It’s the trials. The biggest clean-up after the second wizarding war has been done and now they are dealing with the remaining death eaters. Quite a number of them died during the final battle, some committed suicide in their holding cells to avoid Azkaban and luckily less than we feared could escape the country. I was asked to watch the proceedings as I know the most about the Dark Lord and his organisation (at least according to them, I would think higher members of the Order of the Phoenix would have been better). So now I am witnessing my 14th trial since the beginning of it all. Up until now every person put to trial has received a relatively just punishment. The court is now sentencing a young woman who I forgot the name of to seven years in Azkaban in the top layer (the easiest confinement; no dementors, no dark hallways, acceptable food and so on). Thought so, from her testament under Veritaserum it became clear that she was a minor pawn who did little more than legwork and has never killed anyone. I yawn while she is led out of the room.
After a fast shower and changing into better clothes I hurriedly apparate to the Weasley family home. Since I want to ask them about my new findings too I have some report sheets with me.
“Trauma patients? That’s a difficult subject, Potter. It depends on the situation and the person. There is no single solution for that. But yes, the basic rules count for both situations. Nonetheless you would have to be more specific. But why are you asking?” his eyes narrow at me, “Is there something else behind it?”
I blush. Do you need to point that out? There is some little thing nagging on my conscience at those words, but I ignore it. I never slept with anyone. Also something flashes through your eyes. I can’t tell what it is but it seems nearly like hurt or plain annoyance.
The closer I got, the more relief loosens the pressure on my chest. The white comes from a long shock of white-blond hair hanging from the head of a person huddled against the wall. He is sunken down, curling in on himself. Thin legs in black pants and expensive looking shoes are pulled as close to his chest as they will go, bony arms covered by a black cloak are wrapped tightly around them. His head has fallen forward and his hair spilled from the tie, which means it’s falling around him like a light curtain. I am not seeing his face, but I am still pretty sure it’s him.
I thank all of you for your comments, especially bafflinghaze and Kkmonkey, and apologize for not replying to any of them but my life has been a chaos recently and I'm not used to replying to comments.
Apparently pushing the sad thoughts aside, determination comes back to her face and she shoots up, “We have to get Draco out of there. Immediately. He shouldn’t be in there one second longer, especially since he doesn’t deserve it to begin with.”
Draco seems to have calmed down at least a bit, so he is starting to pull away again. I hold him for a moment longer, just for my peace of mind before releasing him. He sits straight immediately, but still as far away from the rest of the café as possible. At least his hands aren’t shaking anymore, they are clenched in his lap though, hard enough for his knuckles to turn white. I run a hand through my hair and grab the forgotten menu from the table.
“Never?” childish eyes look up at me and my throat closes up and I can’t do anything more than nod. When he sees that he launches himself at me, wrapping his functioning arm around me and pressing his still bony body against me, “Please make him stop hurting me. Please, mother.”
Home again I pull the drawing out of my pocket. I am staring at it for a bit until I set it on the fireplace mantle, sticking it next to a photo of Draco I found somewhere I can’t remember anymore. It’s his drawing after all.
The moment is strange, but not in a bad sense. It’s like a huge breath leaves Draco and his whole posture relaxes but gains in inner strength at the same time. His right hand reaches out and strokes the white mane, a hum starting in the back of his throat. His usually shaky hand becomes stronger, gripping the leather secured around the horse. The left arm is still unresponsive and his legs more or less just hanging down, but it’s a step forward nonetheless. Andrea gives me a bright smile from besides Shenan’s head, holding the lead she attached to the horse’s bridle.
I smile but don’t really dare come closer, lest I interrupt his peace. For a few minutes he busies himself with the two horses nudging at him from left and right. Then, just as I take a step closer a soft whinny from the other side of the stable seems to draw his attention. At first he stiffens whether from me approaching or the unexpected sound, but then he looks in the direction of the noise and spots Shenan, the horse he rode during his first therapy session. His face brightens slightly and he takes another step.
I startle when a soft hand lands on my shoulder, “I am very glad that he has a friend like you,” she chuckles, “Even if you were never friends before.”
He blinks in this manner of his, signifying yes. I smile softly, tenseness leaving me and slumping down. To my surprise I feel a cold hand on my neck once again. I twitch a moment, then my smile widens and I cover the pale hand to warm it up.
If it’s possible he tenses even further, “Because I did not have a choice,” he forces out as hard, grey eyes meet mine.
“No, you didn’t,” I repeat, lifting a hand to lay it on his shoulder only to have him flinch away from it, “I was there, Malfoy. You couldn’t kill him. Snape did it.”
It takes me several more weeks and some training to go outside until I trust that Draco will make it through a visit to a normal stable with all the people without having some kind of relapse. I still chose a time when I hope that there will be comparatively few people around. During preparing the blonde is excited because he thinks we are going to Shenan. Nonetheless he is only in some kind of half-clear state, behaving like he is back to before Hogwarts. It makes for a strange mixture between his haughty manner, an ingrained fear and childishness.
“Nothing is going to happen to Draco. He’s going to be fine. We are all going to be fine,” she says as she pulls me in to hold me close.
With the upmost care I slowly reach down to his thighs, a new bowl of water next to me. He twitches but barely moves otherwise. Careful, as not to startle him any more than necessary I start to wash his legs and feet, but always staying an inch away from the upper end of his thighs. Turning him around won’t be easy, so instead I lift his legs up to wash the underside of them. His eyes are worryingly empty again once I am finished with that, but I still have to wash the rest of him. With hesitation and minimal movements, I clean his pelvis area I just hope he will be well enough to wash himself soon, this is embarrassing as hell!
I am making this quick, cause I have exam season right now and I don't really have time to post. That also means there might be no chapters during the next weeks.
“Let’s just say that he did some things that weren’t entirely right when he was younger. But he was forced to do it and that included being forced to have a tattoo made on his left arm. We assume that’s the reason he refuses to move it. He doesn’t even like people touching it.”
Also, I have never actually seen horse therapy and I don't know much more about it than reading some articles in riding magazines, so I am essentially still making this up.
To my utter surprise and kind of relief the shock of losing his grip seems to have cleared his mind for a moment as in the middle of falling he curls himself in, protecting his head. He doesn’t manage to stop or avoid landing on the ground, but he does it as safely as possible without using any magic. I breathe out as I reach the fence, to see him sitting back upright again. He is covered in grass and scowling at the stains, but seems unharmed. Before I can say something though one of the two new horses noses at him. The dapple-grey mare pushes her snout into his neck, causing him to giggle.
My face falls as he still doesn’t show much of a reaction but after some seconds of silence his face twists. It is that crooked smile again. There is no happiness in his face, just empty. Again tears tug at the back of my eyes. I reach out my hand and stroke his cheek softly.
“Yeah, well,” my fingers start to fiddle with the books and papers in my hand, “I know someone who has gone through a heavy trauma. He is basically apathetic right now. I am trying to help him, but I am afraid that I don’t know enough to properly care for him,” I softly admit.
“I… You…” I stumble over my words. Unfortunately I totally trust him to just walk off and try to find the right room, getting into all kinds of trouble on the way, more likely to hurt himself than if I show him and let him have his way until Andrea finally arrives. I can see no other humans in the stable and the patient I saw earlier is going to be in one of the riding halls for some time yet. So I just hope it’s going to be alright.
She squirms, “As much as we ranted about it, Draco’s life was by far not as perfect as we always thought. He may have been a rich kid who got whatever he wanted as long as it could be bought with money, but there is far much more behind his childhood than we ever knew. Anyone ever knew.”
My eyes never leave him while I slowly make my way down to the sidewalk. I pass the charms, making myself visible to everyone there. I halt and glance up at my companion. Since I can look past the charms, I can see him standing there on the steps. His eyes are wide and he is staring at the street behind me, cars moving past. For a moment I frown, maybe taking him out onto a muggle street wasn’t such a good idea. Did he ever encounter cars before?
“You do?” I ask eagerly, showing that kind of interest in anything for the first time since the end of the war.
She smiles back, though a sad look lingers on Draco, “Hello Harry. Yeah, I felt like I needed to come. Besides I brought you two lunch,” she lifts the basket she is holding, “I am sure you didn’t find time to prepare food yet.”
She smiles at me, “No, that is somewhere between the one we’ve been using before and a real saddle. He seems to have made progress since last time and since he expressed the wish to go faster before, I thought we might give it a try. The stirrups should give him the needed hold for that.”
The blonde doesn’t show any reaction and the guard sighs. I gape pained, “Does he not even notice you are there?”
I shake my head, “He’s just tired. It’s late for him and remaining clear always draws too much of his energy. He will be fine tomorrow.”
His eyes widen impossibly and every last one of his muscles tenses. Then suddenly he slumps over and a hollow chuckle sounds from his chest.
“Okay,” she shrugs, “Pretty well, considering the panic attack he had yesterday. He woke up screaming shortly after you left but I managed to calm him down. With Dragon’s help that is.”
So right now I am standing in the middle of a horse stable in a small town about an hour outside of London. From what I found on the internet (it’s a muggle business after all) this is a very good therapy stable despite being relatively small. Though if this wasn’t for Draco I would never be here. All my memories with horses usually include either thestrals or Duddley pushing me off or into one. Yeah, well I have to get past that. Nonetheless I sigh when a curious snout carefully nudges me from the side. Throwing a wary look at the light furred horse I rub it’s nose and hope the owner comes soon.
“I’m sorry, I couldn’t get you out of there earlier. You never deserved that. You sacrificed everything and had to pay even more. It’s not fair,” I lean forward a bit, “But now you’re free. You are never going back to Azkaban again. I will take care of you, I promise. I will make sure you can become a normal person again. Just give me a sign you’re still in there.”
Eventually though, after minutes of rubbing his arms and cuddling into his stuffed toy, he relaxes slowly again. His legs uncurl and fall back down, basically landing on my lap. His posture calms as well, a soft breath leaving him. I smile and take his hand to me, massaging it. His grey eyes connect with my gaze too. The panic is still caught in the deep orbs but it is starting to fade thankfully.
I hum in agreement and reach for the bottle, but am stopped by the girl’s hand on my arm, “No Harry. You had enough for now. I understand that you are angry about what happened to Malfoy, but drinking won’t help. You should rather think of a plan on how to get him out again. Or at least lighten his punishment.”
With a protesting crunch it finally gives way and slides to me. Apparently it got somehow stuck to it’s place on the floor. It doesn’t look much different than the others. A brown cardboard box with a lid with quite a number of dents and a thin dust covering. I chuckle when I spot the word ‘sweets’ written in Dumbledore’s curvy handwriting across the front. Still there is something different about this box. I frown but when I try to lift the lid it doesn’t really budge. I grumble. Running a spell over the box, it glows blue to my surprise, revealing a magical seal over it. That causes me to pull a face. Was Dumbledore so adamant at hiding his sweets that he would seal them? Really? I would say no, but by now I would believe nearly everything when it comes to that old cot. Focusing for a moment I concentrate my magic in my wand and mumble a few incantations meant to break seals which Hermione taught me. Giving way under my force the ban breaks.
Why is that? Do you know the answer? Would you tell me if you did? I hope you return soon so you can tell me. You know, I even went to ask Snape what happened to you, but he only threw me a look that held so much disgust that it nearly had me recoiling. But I want to see you again. I want to know what is up with you. I need to see you.
We ran another diagnostic spell over Draco because we knew that a clear diagnosis would be required. Hermione helped me put it in a way that muggles would accept with official doctor’s signature and so on. I see Andrea carefully studying the sheet, her forehead creasing. Eventually she looks up at me, a pained expression hiding in the back of her eyes.
“Draco?” I groan, as I immediately force myself upright, looking around the room for the blonde, but only seeing Hermione squatting in front of me.
“We went out to a muggle café and he was fine with it. In fact, he was the one who wanted to leave the house. It went alright the first few times, but recently…” I sigh, “Maybe we were moving too fast and now he’s having a setback.”
“He hadn’t,” she stands up to hug me tightly, “He was forced to study hard from an age on where children usually don’t even visit kindergarten yet. When he made a mistake, he was punished. That punishment could be nearly anything. It started with things like no cookies or room arrest in his young years. Over the time he got older his father became more brutal. Hitting him and after Voldemort came back, Lucius was allowed to live out his full sadistic nature I guess.”
A bit tentatively I stroke the top of the animal’s head. She purrs but somehow it doesn’t feel right. So I shake my head slightly.
“We are going to help you. Don’t worry. One day you will be the same annoying Draco Malfoy again, you will see,” I pat his now cleaned back (the only part of his body that is not covered in dirt).
He does his best to make his voice sound demanding, trying to recreate his old masks, but I can still hear the tremor in it, no matter how much he attempts to hide it. At his request I turn around in my chair. He is standing in the doorway, one arm poised in his side, pretending to be a mixture between bored and annoyed. But his left hand is clenching in the leg of his pants, clearly showing how uneasy he is. Fixing him with my eyes I think his request over. With taking him to the new stable I am trying to get him used to new environments with more people again. But we were only there this one time, three days ago. Not to mention he barely got in contact with any humans this time, only horses.
I don’t say anything though, because it would just cause him to snap at me. Not to mention he seems better than I expected, even from what I can see behind his covers, so I don’t want to disturb him, afraid me addressing him might break his concentration. Instead I turn and walk down the street. I match my pace to his slow one, making sure to always keep him in my peripheral vision.
“How much did they take? How much has Draco left?” I remember that the Malfoys used to be rich, “And who is supposed to organise it as long as he’s not capable of it yet?”
“He has to make his steps on his own. If you support him on every step he takes, he will never make progress,” she says softly.
That smile was so familiar but not from you. Talking about it, I don’t remember ever seeing you smiling genuinely. It’s sad if I think about it. I would have loved to see you smile. A real smile that is. Were you ever truly happy? Your childhood was, wasn’t it? I always thought you were a rich, spoiled child. But after finding out about how much you hid behind masks, I really don’t know what to believe about you anymore. Will I ever know the truth? I want to, but you would never tell me. What is your story, Draco Malfoy? Your childhood, what you really felt and thought during Hogwarts, why you disappeared and what happened to you afterwards. Your true story. I want to meet you so badly.
“No, please!” he suddenly screams and I jerk my hand back, “Please no punishment! I’m sorry! I will be better, I promise! I will pay better attention.”
Ignoring his lack of reaction, the small boy grips Draco’s unresponsive left hand, not paying any attention to the mess of scars and faded Dark Mark on the pale skin visible where his sleeve has slipped back. He grins up at the blonde, “Draco play.”
I have a hard time keeping my magic in check, “But there were wards around the Manor. No one should have been able to get close to it.”
“Beating you is really not worth my time,” you say haughtily, “You always just had luck on your side. Now do me a favour and go back to your loser friends, you are giving me a headache.”
I really don’t know how it came from making out in front of the lake to hot steaming sex in my prefect room. Do you know that you were the first male I slept with? I tried it twice with a girl before that, but it never felt right. All the rumours about me sleeping around are lies, made up to keep my reputation up. But it was the best I ever had. I don’t know how it felt to you, but afterwards you laid down with me and held me in your arms. I was so happy that just for a moment we could be what I always wanted, friends and later on, more than friends.
“Sure,” the girl smiles tensely, grabs the mentioned item and approaches us cautiously with it. Once again caught up in the horse, Draco barely notices her. It allows her to position the steps close to his feet. I murmur my thanks and put it in the correct place. Next I nudge the blonde again.
I blush but don’t even really try to deny it. Instead I step around the armchair Draco is sitting in. I kneel in front of him. My eyes fix on his face, his own grey orbs vague and unfocused, while I take his hands in mine.
But his mind is immediately distracted when the first fence comes up on our right. Draco gives a careful smile and pushes away from my hold. I let him go as he walks over to lean on the wooden bar. A young-looking brown horse, only barely having outgrown his foal age, trots over curiously and noses at his hand. He tries to stroke the horse’s snout but the animal shies away, so Draco simply extends his hand instead. The little stallion snorts and cautiously sniffs at the pale fingers. In the end curiosity wins over wariness again though and the white-tipped nose is pushed against the blonde’s chest. Draco laughs and strokes the thin neck.
And so, I retell the whole story. From how pained he looked in sixth year over whenever I would see him in a vision, he would do nothing that could be considered bad. That he saved my life at Malfoy Manor by not identifying me. What I will only later realise is that he could have ended the war at this point, with the dark side winning, should he have chosen to identify me. But he didn’t and I am not drawing that conclusion yet. So I continue on over our escape from the Manor and how he didn’t fire any curse at me in the Room of Requirement even though he had more than enough time to do so with my back turned to him. He didn’t even fight in the final battle. I saw him walk away from the fight after all.
For a moment he tilts his head in a confused or nervous gesture then blinks in a way that I have come to associate with his way of saying ‘yes’ to something. I smile. A small step, but it’s moving forward nonetheless. So I place the croissant back on the plate.
Eating breakfast works better today with him more alert and at least a little bit more active. He can make it clear what he wants to eat with lightly shaking his head or doing a single nod when I try to give him certain foods. I smile and tell him stories while eating. After I have gotten him to drink a whole cup of tea, I decide to try something.
“Let me see,” she types on her computer, then nods, “Yeah, Thursday at seven o’clock in the evening. Does that fit for you?”
After filling out the forms with my address, contacts and some more details about Draco, she smiles at me.
“I know you know that,” Andrea laughs, “But you don’t have the balance to control a horse completely on your own yet. And with only one hand you can’t properly hold the reins either.”
Unfortunately not everything goes perfect as Draco proves to me on the afternoon two days after Dragon’s arrival. I have just brought him back to the living room from a nap after lunch. Hermione and I have been trying to establish a clear daily routine for him to make him feel safer. The nap is part of that. After seating him in his usual chair, I leave for the kitchen to prepare some tea. Only to be startled out of my peace when a loud crash sounds from the other direction. It is followed by a surprised hiss and something that sounds like a squeak. Immediately I am on full alert.
“The basics are still simply pureblood upbringing,” the woman shrugs sadly, “The rigorous training and punishment if you did something wrong, it’s simple upbringing in pureblood society. Granted abuse was always frowned upon but an occasional beating if you did something severely wrong wasn’t as uncommon as you might wish. I am sure though Lucius pushed it far past anything socially acceptable even for a strict pureblood family,” she purses her lips sadly, tears threatening her eyes, “That boy really got nothing but bad luck in his life, didn’t he?” after a careful agreement from me the hint of a smile makes it back on her face, “But at least now he has you.”
“Good morning Draco,” I say softly, “It’s time to get up. You have to eat something before I leave again.”
I lean over and both our eyes run over line after line of injuries. It’s horrifying, seeing the amount of his pain.
My face pulls into a grimace, “A dog scared him. He spent half of the evening panicking. And once I got him calm enough it was late anyway, so I studied.”
I nod and heft Draco more securely at my side. Saying goodbye to Andrea, I lead a nearly sleeping blonde out through the stable. When we step out of the front door, he finally falls asleep completely. But since we’re out of sight of any muggles I can simply use a lightening charm to make him easy to carry for me. I disapparate, landing at home directly in his bedroom. I clean him up magically before changing and settling him in his bed. Dragon comes strolling in through the door and when sees the blonde jumps up on the bed and rolls himself in next to his head, purring lowly. I smile a last time before leaving him be for the night.
He groans and twists violently to the other side, biting his lip in what I guess is an effort to remain silent.
“Too often he doesn’t,” the man answers sadly, “On his good days he is alert enough to recognise his own name. But on the bad days… A bomb could go off next to his face and he probably wouldn’t even notice it.”
You nod but somehow keep silent. Strange, I would have suspected a snide remark now. If it were anyone but you I would suspect they were hiding something. But you are just like that aren’t you? You have probably lived your whole life behind a mask and with more secrets than I can imagine. I sincerely do not envy you. I think that sounds lonely. Will you ever know that I want to know all of that about you? That I want to relieve any loneliness you feel? No, you don’t. And you never will because you would never accept it and you have that brunette woman now.
She smiles at me thankfully and leads me towards the tower in which the headmaster’s office resides, making small-talk while on the way. To my surprise this tower seems to have sustained little to no damage during the battle. But she explains that there are stronger wards around it which kept it from being accidently damaged. Stopping halfway up the spiralling staircase (which hasn’t been repaired to move again yet) to the old office, she opens an unsuspicious wooden door which I never noticed before even though I went up there quite a number of times. When she steps aside, I want to enter.
I am chuckling over the number of different biscuits he ordered when I suddenly stop. I have just turned to the next page and find myself in front of something entirely different. That is not a sweets bill. And neither are the next pages as far as I can see. This is handwritten (by Dumbledore) and speaks a very different tone as the amusing bills before. It looks nearly like a diary.
Instinctively I feel Draco push against me, towards the animals once again. I smile sadly at the woman.
He stares at me for a few more seconds before he turns and disappears around the corner. I run my fingers through my hair as I walk out after him, heading in the direction of the entrance. After slipping on a jacket and shoes I don’t have to wait long until soft footsteps down the stairs announce Draco’s arrival. I guess he really is eager to get outside. Nonetheless he is also undoubtedly nervous. His left hand clenches in the material of the coat he is wearing and his movements have become slow and somehow clumsy for the first time in months. I watch him worriedly.
Our walk is slow again, but he seems to have gained at least a little bit of strength from the first proper food in what I guess are months for him. Entering the bath, he twitches as the heat hits him. He is used to cold these days, so I run my hands down his back.
“I think those prisoners on the lowest layers are treated way too awfully. Every person, criminal or not, deserves to be treated at least human. They aren’t. He thinks the same,” she smiles.
His glare worsens, “Oh yes, poor saint Potter. Always such a bad life and everybody else has it so much better.”
He is making progress but it is only a tiny piece of all we have to achieve. He has still not made a single sound apart from a few whimpers, groans and sighs. His left hand hasn’t made more than a few twitches, it’s immobile no matter what I try. But I wouldn’t dare to push him again. I know that to cure him we still have a few episodes like that ahead of us, but he desperately doesn’t need me triggering even more than strictly necessary. And I don’t want to see that again either.
Only a friend, bullshit! I glare heavily down into my glass of firewhiskey. The sounds of the pub ring around me but all I can think about is that you married Lou. She was not just your friend. Your lover, maybe your fiancée.
I nod, “The horses keep him clear as long as no one interferes with him,” I look at her unsurely, “I hope it’s okay. I know he isn’t really well enough for that yet and that you as his therapist would stop him, but…” I turn my gaze back on him, “He was there and he,” I snort, “he used to be an extremely stubborn person, so he wouldn’t let himself be deterred. So I thought it might be better to let him have his way but under supervision than go off on his own and get hurt in the process.”
“Yeah, maybe,” she smiles down at the little cat, who is purring as the girl rubs his back, “So you wanna take him straight to Draco?”
Ron, with blood covering half of his head, skull cracked open. Hermione’s eyes are vacant, burn marks of a death spell at her temple. Teddy’s small body twisted and pale. Sirius looks like when I saw him fall through the veil, seemingly floating in the air. A crushed figure is laying next to a dead George with slit wrists.
I nod and sit him down on the other end of the table away from Hermione. She watches us softly as I summon him a full plate of warm potato soup. He gives me a careful smile back before focusing down to his meal. I stroke my hand through his soft hair while I stand next to him for a few seconds to make sure he is alright. But he doesn’t seem to remember or care about his clear time this afternoon, so I leave him alone to sit next to my friend again.
“I understand that. However what I have to ask is not something you might want to discuss out on the street,” he tries to be polite.
“You always have a choice with me,” I try to reassure him, but all he does is raise his head completely. I stand up again, only to notice that he’s not following me. Worry shoots through me again, “Aren’t you coming?”
We stay silent after that and just watch Draco interact with the horse. He is leaning against her, using her as his support, not yet strong enough to stand on his own that long. His right hand is running all over the shining fur and through the white mane. His left arm is still immobile, so we put it in a sling so it won’t get in his way. Shenan in turn has her head turned to him, carefully nudging and prodding at this new human. Her nose carefully explores the thin figure and to my surprise Draco shies little to not at all away from the animal’s touch.
It takes me a moment of confusion until I realise that he probably thinks I am referring to Bellatrix. A shudder runs down my back. The last thing I need right now is her.
“I mean it’s not like he is dangerous,” I frown, “If it’s allowed I would like to bring him out of there.”
“Yes,” I sigh, tightening my right arm around his waist. A moment later we are gone, only to reappear at the top step of Grimmauld Place. He slumps against me and I’m not sure whether he is still with me or not. However I want to get him inside first, so I lift him to settle his head on my shoulder. He is still incredibly light, mostly skin and bones as he is. As much as Hermione and I have tried, it’s difficult to get flesh back on his bones. He has always been more the skinny type, but his body still hasn’t recovered from his time in Azkaban. It does worry me, but from the last scan we did, I could find nothing to cause this. Subsequently all we can do for now is feed him as much as we can, which isn’t much unfortunately because he only eats small portions.
“It was a long time ago,” she rubs her wet eyes, “Well, unless you count from far away at Hogwarts or the trials. Or in the Prophet,” conjuring up a tissue, she cleans her face, “I think he wasn’t much older than Teddy is now. A toddler still. Narzissa snuck out of the Manor to visit Ted and I with her small child,” she clears her throat again, “He was such a sweet child back then. Always smiling. Seeing him today, like that, it is…”
Blinking once, grey eyes focus slowly back on me and he tilts his head curiously. His right hand stretches out and pats the bed. After a few moments of confusion he starts to make distressed noises. It takes even longer for me to realise that he is looking for his stuffed dragon.
So yes, I will be continuing this series. It's not abandoned, I'm just not feeling great right now, so updates are a bit slow. I'm sorry.
“All of your generation has been through enough,” Andromeda frowns, “No one should force children to fight in a war.”
‘Ah, Voldemort,’ I sigh. To no one’s surprise this or some variation of that time is the most common subject in his nightmares. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he refused. His childish self didn’t understand, only that he was terrified, and when he was clear, he simply told me to go away. Therapy would technically be a good option, but he can’t even remain clear yet, so I have to postpone that.
Unfortunately his ill-fated adventure seems to have earned Draco a cold. Not that it stops him from doing anything. It’s not too bad, but with the hit his immune system has to take, so does his mental state. During the day when he is clear he tries to pretend to be as well as ever, apart from a runny nose and a slight cough. The night is another case. Somehow he seems to be even worse at night. He screams himself awake with nightmares several times and hasn’t been clear during the night since he evening he got out.
Also I wrote these early chapters when I was only starting, so there might be numerous grammar mistakes. I have never had a beta and english is not my native language.
His legs look as awful as the rest of his body does. Bruised, scarred and white skin on bones. And my suspicion strengthens, judging by the reddish-brown substance, which I guess is blood, still clinging to the inside of his upper thighs. I can’t help but shudder, trying to hide it from my sensitive charge, but he apathetically sets foot in front of foot and follows me to the tub. I stop him in front of it, but before I can get him into the half-high water, he twitches and shies away from it. I softly stroke his back.
I sigh, “Not really good. Most of the time he doesn’t react to anything. He hasn’t said a word or really moved on his own. We will talk later, okay?” I look at her for a second, “First it’s important he eats something.”
The judge glares angrily and after asking whether there is anything else and a short discussion with his fellow councilmen he turns back to the bored looking Draco, “The court will now announce their decision.”
But on the other hand my loud arrival (banging the door too) has called my two best friends out. The two have not been at the trials, instead helping with either rebuilding or family matters. We agreed to meet up in the evenings so they have been waiting for me in the house I inherited from Sirius. It takes no less time than for me to take off my coat and throwing it over a hook to the side, for both Hermione and Ron to storm into the corridor.
He snorts, turning his head away, and tries to dislodge my hand but he is still too weak to manage it, “Recover? For what? The world hates me. If I went out there they would rather stuff me back into Azkaban, than listen to what I have to say. I remember that my father is dead and mother is gone as well. There is no one who would care if I vanished. They would celebrate it.”
I scramble up, “There is a reason I am so concerned. There is something not right with that arm of his.”
“Draco?” I ask, only to receive a grunt in response. With a slight smile I amend, “Malfoy. I am going to put my hand on your shoulder, alright? It’s just me.”
I nod in his direction, stopping anyway, “Yes, thank you for the concern. I am just tired. Didn’t get any sleep last night.”
“Yeah, thank you, Lena,” I nod as she types her number into the phone I am still carrying despite living in the wizarding world.
Her face has gone sad, “That sounds bad, Harry,” her face wanders up to the sleeping boy, “But he seems okay now, right?”
“I never murdered,” Draco insists, his voice and gaze strong, even though he is now hiding his left arm in his robe.
Two weeks later there is no solution in sight yet. Granted none of us has had much time to look into it because we are still working on rebuilding everything. My favourite place is still Hogwarts despite the memories of the final battle now connected to it. I am clearing some hallway from rubble when professor McGonnagall approaches me.
It’s around eleven on a workday, so there aren’t many people out on the street much to my relief. Whenever someone approaches us on the sidewalk, I make sure to walk directly next to Draco, as to shield him from the strangers. He tenses every time someone passes us and on occasion tries to back towards the houses on the other side. He has less problems with the cars, unless they make any loud, abnormal noises, like a honk or the squealing of brakes. My guess would be because there is no way he can connect a muggle car to any kind of bad memory, but people are a different matter.
But while I feel like I am floating on a cloud since I heard him speak for the first time, I can’t help but notice how my friend is watching him with worried eyes.
“Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore mostly,” he stumbles over the names, “After that Remus Lupin. Why is that important?”
“They did get the alarm. But whoever was responsible for keeping track of it ignored it and let the intruders do as they pleased. The suspicion is that they were working together with the group that attacked.”
“Did Dragon scare you, Draco?” I smile softly. To my surprise it earns me a huff and I laugh in happiness, “I am taking that as a no even though it was the reason. Don’t worry,” I rub the back of his hand again, “Completely normal. After months without any social contact it’s not surprising that suddenly having another living being apart from me here might startle you,” he sags into the cushioning of his chair and turns his gaze away. I shake my head amusedly then tug on his arm, “Come on. That was enough excitement for today. How about we get you back to your own room?” he stares at me, “Without any pesky cats trying to get your attention, right?” I tease him but he only tilts his head.
“Not here,” she mumbles, squeezing my shoulder, “Let him sleep in peace. We can go through this and discuss it back in the living room.”
“I have papers here that tell of the existence of another spy in Voldemort’s ranks, nearly as high as Snape himself,” I say handing the papers over, “I found them in Hogwarts. The spy is only ever referred to as ‘A’. Here is Draco’s original birth certificate. His third name is Abraxas.”
“I tried, but before the trials there was too much of a chaos and now… I asked, only to have them say that as the criminal he is I can’t be allowed to talk to him until he is in safe confinement.”
“You can just call to ask for advice,” he shrugs while he scribbles something on a piece of paper, “Here. But don’t forget that tomorrow is another mandatory lesson,” he smirks, “Maybe you will be a bit more attentive then.”
“I know,” he snorts, “But it sounds prettier when they announce it during a competition, than just ‘Kari’.”
Hurriedly I come to my feet and approach him, “No, of course not,” I glare at him, “You are not a prisoner here,” I repeat again. Grabbing his face carefully, I force him to look directly at me, “You are recovering and when you are stable enough I will take you to whatever place you want. But until then, I will not have you relapsing as long as I can stop it.”
But that earns me a shocked squeak loud enough to startle me completely awake. Next to follow is a crash and the sound of someone scrambling away. My eyes fly completely open, but everything is still foggy. Damnit, my glasses must have fallen off at some point. Hurriedly I summon them and put them on. My brain immediately deduces that no, there is no danger. Just a scared Draco in the corner. I curse softly.
Hermione laughs lowly and comes up next to us. I grin back at her over the other man’s shoulder. Slowly we make our way downstairs to the front door. Draco gives off an impatient air but he accepts my lead. I am happy to see how much he trusts me by now.
“Yes, uhm,” I clear my throat and push the curious horse away, “My name is Harry Potter. I called last week.”
“No!” I glare at him and can’t overlook how he startles at my loud voice, so I soften, “No, you didn’t.”
“Alright,” I say as I stand up while he focuses on the book, “I will leave you be for now. Rest up. I will get you for dinner,” I stroke his hair a last time before I finally leave the room.
I snort, “Who wouldn’t be,” I smile as my eyes focus on the boy now alternating between eating spoonfulls of soup and stroking Dragon, “If, and that’s a big if, he would love me back, not just out of some kind of mislead gratitude. I don’t know,” I shrug, “I was raised in the muggle world, I’m not sure what possibilities same-sex-couples have in the wizarding world… But an official partnership? Maybe even adoption, I always wanted children, though I’m not sure anyone would allow Draco to adopt a child.”
I smile soothingly, “No, don’t worry. I just got held up in Hogwarts. I wanted to finish something before I left.”
He turns around instead of answering and with surprising strength manages to pull my tired body along with him. I end up half on top of him, half spooning his back. This time my huff is in annoyance. I try to lift myself up, but only manage to get off Draco’s body and change to completely spooning him. I groan.
He nods and turns away from me, collecting Dragon, who has jumped on the couch next to my head, with his working arm. I let my eyes follow him fondly
“Yes, Mr. Potter. Of course,” she nods, “I’m sorry. There is always so much during the day it must have gotten lost,” I just wave it off and she smiles brighter, petting the light horse which had been nudging me before, “So what can I do for you?”
So I'm posting now because I just got out of surgery for getting a tooth implant and need to distract myself from the pain.
Not to mention I probably lost some data because my backup of the old one didn't work properly. At least my stories were saved on a seperate USB-stick, so they were safe ;)
“No, I don’t think he ever did. It was his mask,” she says sadly, “The bitchy, spoiled rich kid who was above everyone and treated them awfully. Just like he is treated at his own home.”
“Listen closely and never speak to anyone about this,” he repeats, the importance clear in his voice as are the nerves, “You know that the dark lord uses our dungeons to keep some of his prisoners. But they are not taken care of well enough. If they continue like that the prisoners will die. I do not know whether they want that or are just careless. But I do not want my family punished because the death eaters in charge did not feed the prisoners enough. Neither do I need any unnecessary deaths. That’s why I need you to bring them additional food. Not too much so it won’t be obvious they are getting fed by someone else but enough they stay healthy. Also give them blankets and things like that should they need them. And under no circumstances are you allowed to let yourself be seen while doing this. No one can know of this. Am I making myself clear?”
‘Ah, he’s clear,’ I think, shaking my head to settle from the sudden shift position, “You had a nightmare last night,” I start.
A short time later we have apparated on the grounds of the therapy stable. Draco is pulling forwards as soon as the smell of the horses hits his nose. He huffs when I regulate him down to a slower pace. Hermione grins at me. I smile back as I stop him in front of the door to let the girl open it. To my surprise though as soon as the wood swings open and he has made sure that no one is too close or in his line of sight, he actually tries to push off of me. I want to catch him, but he sways to the left side and would have crushed me against the frame of the stable door if I had not let him go.
“No, I’m afraid there isn’t,” she sighs, “All you can do is help him through it as good as you can and hope he recovers well enough to go back into society.”
“Yes, you said you are not allowed to say. I don’t need you to give me a name either. All I need is a yes or a no,” I take a deep breath, “The one who ordered you to do it was Draco, am I correct?”
“No, I would never do that. I am simply interested. I was the one who made sure he didn’t go to Azkaban. Did he never speak about me?” I try to soothe him.
“Alright,” she nods, “How about we go to riding hall. We have a smaller one where no one else will bother us. A horse is already waiting there.”
Careful grey eyes peek at me through pale fingers. I smile, “That’s right. No danger here, I promise,” I stretch out my left hand, palm up. I stay like that, murmuring calming words and holding out my hand. Eventually he slowly takes his hand from in front of his face. He lowers it towards my palm, but twitching away shortly before contact. I patiently keep on offering my palm and at the third try he finally lays his hand on mine. I smile brightly at his still worried expression.
“Draco?” I ask, trying to get his attention, “Hey Draco, look at me,” when I see his eyes turn to me, I smile at him in an attempt to calm him, “Everything is okay. Calm down. Now, what is with Teddy?”
The mare herself looks almost confused for a moment before nudging him again. He smiles at her again, boyish and careful, but still more sincere than I have ever seen. The pale hand grips the grey mane and he lets her help himself to his feet as she raises her head back up. He rises with her until he is standing straight again. Once again I can just shake my head, fascinated at how different he is the moment he can feel horse fur under his fingers.
She smiles her dreamy smile, “I didn’t think you would. You fight for their rights and just punishments just like we do.”
After another bow the small creature disapparates and Draco turns around, his hands land on the desk. His head is down, hair hiding his eyes and he supports himself on his arms. He seems exhausted and the rings under his eyes speak a clear language. Then the picture freezes. Tilly’s memory is over. I look to the girl next to me who has a hand over her mouth. I tug at her sleeve and we both flow back out of the memory.
“No, really,” my friend presses, “Just let us through please. The horses should calm him down again.”
“Master Potter,” the elf hurriedly bows deeply, “Of course. Matty welcomes you at Malfoy Manor. I am sorry but none of the masters is here currently.”
“That only works so far. I have been drinking coffee, potions and using those spells. But I’ve had less than twenty hours sleep in the last two weeks.”
“He was, but we agreed it might be better if he didn’t come to Grimmauld Place with me. You know, just in case Draco was up. Even if he’s better, introducing new people into what he considers a safe environment might not be a good idea. Especially not Ron,” she explains.
My lips purse and I lower my head, “Yeah that. I guess I pushed that aside,” running a hand through my hair, my gaze fixes on the peaceful figure, “Isn’t there a way to take these memories?”
So I glare as I stomp down to the front door. Scowl clear on my face, I open it. The man in front of it is wearing the ministry garb too, but luckily it’s a different one from last time. I would have cursed that jerk into next week. Instead the guy bows his head politely, despite being clearly startled.
“What do you mean? We were supposed to meet at Diagon Alley for lunch today, but you missed it. We were worried about you,” she crosses her arms.
As I open the door, suddenly a smile comes to my face. The scene that presents itself to me is actually nicely peaceful. Draco is sitting on the floor, the sun shining through the big windows highlighting his hair and skin, giving it a more golden tone than he usually has. There is a calm expression on his face, a few stray strands of hair falling in over his cheeks. He is humming lowly to himself, his one moving hand alternatively stroking Dragon who is laying in his lap and pointing at the pictures of horses in the book in front of him. The cat is purring and occasionally licking the still unresponsive left hand positioned next to him.
Andrea shakes her head, “They are only warming up. He doesn’t need the reins yet and if he’s as good as you say, technically he doesn’t need them at all.”
“Sorry, little one, if he startled you too. Draco has a lot of difficulties and sometimes he just reacts negatively to any other presence,” I bring the animal up in front of my face, “And that’s why you have to be careful with him, understood?” As if he is reacting to my words, Dragon mews and his small tongue flicks out to run over my nose. I chuckle, “I take that as a yes. So how about we find you something to play with?”
After close to fifteen minutes of peace Andrea next to me straightens, “Alright. I think we can try riding now. You coming?”
Once again, I have to mention that I have no medical knowledge whatsoever. So anything I write is made up, I have no idea whether it would actually happen like that. But let's just say this is a magical universe, anything can happen.
But nonetheless he is standing straight, ignoring each insult or other exclamation thrown at him. I scowl at watching the masses curse Draco for things he hasn’t done. Most of those accusations should be directed at Lucius, but since he is dead his son has to take up the role of scapegoat. But he doesn’t so much as twitch, just walks on with an expressionless face. But I still notice the exhaustion and probably physical pain in his posture. He moves too stiffly, his skin is way too pale (making him looking worryingly like a ghost; causing a shiver to run down my spine as it reminds me of our encounter in the toilet in sixth year), there are rings under his eyes and his hair is unkempt and dried out. To the public he might look as impeccable like always, but to me who has known him for seven years he looks awful. Especially when I have seen those silver eyes glint at me aggressively so many times and now they are cold and empty. By now he has reached the chair, sitting down with his usual grace and crossing his shackled arms. He looks more bored than anything.
“Uh, I have some questions,” I start, “You said that some techniques can be applied differently as well. I wanted to know how far that works for trauma patients. Some of the symptoms are the same basically.”
It’s a woman. She looks a bit younger than us, one or two years probably. She is beautiful too. Long brown hair in one braid that sways behind her back, ending above the waist. She has a soft, angular face with smooth, slightly tanned skin. Then I look at her eyes. They are glinting happily, green with blue. But green. Like Orion’s. Is she his mother? But why would he say that he doesn’t know her? Maybe you are ashamed because you were still underage when you got her pregnant, judging by Orion’s age. You were sixteen and she what? Fifteen, probably. I don’t want to know.
They exchange another look, but both shake their heads, “No, not as far as I can remember. What are you talking about?”
“Alright. He was charged with murder but you insisted that he couldn’t kill anyone. Do you have proof?”
His nod is slow and careful but in the end he agrees. Nonetheless as soon as that is cleared, he clutches Dragon to his chest and is gone from the room with a last wary look to the fire. I run a hand through my hair before returning to the fire.
When I turn back to Draco, I look just in time to see him climbing over the fence. I take a hurried step towards him.
I am still laughing as I pick myself up from the floor. I can hear him curse at me under his breath a I leave the room. Even if he pushed me out of the bed, it’s significantly lifted my mood for the rest of the day.
I tense in my seat, waiting for Draco’s reaction. To my surprise though he only stares in curiosity at the small human. Apparently not showing any adverse reaction is enough for the toddler as he starts to drag the much taller man down the hallway, happily babbling about what they are going to play. Draco is simply staring down at him, allowing him to lead on.
And it is the right thing to do, I can see it. The dragon helps to stabilize Draco in the real world. Yes, he is still mostly apathetic, but at least he starts to communicate simple things like yes or no and when he wants something. Well, sometimes he does that, I can see the neglect and abuse he suffered in many of his actions. Also the way he clings to that little toy turns from endearing to painful after a certain time. There are times when he looks like he thinks that little inanimate thing is the only being that cares about him.
But before I can retort, Ron and Hermione barge in and pull me away, saying I have been spending far too much time working lately. So half an hour later we are all three sitting in Ron’s old room, chatting like old times. I have just explained my findings. Hermione smiles while the red head frowns.
“I get it and I won’t stop you,” she grips my hands to keep me from pulling away, “But once we have assessed the damage and gotten him stable again, you take a weekend of free time, am I making myself clear? Visit Andromeda, spend time with Teddy or visit some interesting site, preferably on the other side of the world. Take your mind off Draco for a few days and then you can come back to him. It will be easier for you to help him as well without looking like you’ve been to hell and back. Not to mention a clear head.”
“It’s fine,” she waves it off, “I will give Shenan time to calm down and clean her up myself. You take Draco home.”
The move down takes surprisingly long until the doors finally glide open. We are at the lowest point of the whole prison now. There is no further down. And my breath catches in my chest as I look into the hallway. It is impossibly dark here, the only light the guard’s wand and the occasional small torch. The place smells something awful I don’t even want to try to identify. It is cold and the walls are damp. I have seen places I would never want to be at again, but this is the least pleasant one I ever visited. Michael throws us a sad look then steps out of the elevator. The cells here aren’t much better. Not much more than an animal’s cage. Most have a cot of stones in it, a blanket and something which I guess is a chamber pot, but that’s all. Behind me Hermione draws in a shocked breath and my fists clench. The prisoners here are barely recognisable as human beings. Ghosts would be a better description for them. Skin on bones, deathly pale, bruised all over, haunted eyes empty. Some of them just sit apathetically in their cells, others display all kinds of crazy behaviour. Hermione jumps harshly when a dark-haired witch throws herself against the bars, hissing and spitting. Then Michael stops in front of one of the cells.
He continues to glare but he doesn’t exactly have a choice, so I settle on his left side and put his arm around me, carefully avoiding touching the lower part of his arm. It causes him to twitch away, but he doesn’t have enough control over that limb at the moment to completely take it away and he needs his working right arm to get up. My own arms go around his torso, touch as light as possible. With his teeth clenched and shaking limbs he forces his legs underneath himself. His leg muscles are clearly failing him however when he tries to stand, so I pull upwards. When he finally makes it upright, his legs are shaking badly and he only stands with my help. He is also breathing hard, right hand clenched.
I nod, but the smile never leaves my face, “I know. Believe me I didn’t forget that. But we have to be happy about the small steps he takes. And that is one of those steps. There is a difference between an unmoving toy and an actual animal. So I will stick to that for today and think about his next breakdown after I woke him up tomorrow.”
I feed Draco some more food, something more substantial than empty bread. Until he does that little head shaking motion again. I worry that he eats so little, but Hermione reassures me that this is normal since his stomach is far smaller than usual after years of malnourishment. The blonde seems to be nodding off while sitting up, so I slowly lead him back to his room. Hermione and I have to talk anyway. He doesn’t react, just like always, only falls into the covers, empty grey eyes slipping close. When I turn around, I nearly jump when my friend is standing in the doorway.
The cat only purrs and pushes against my hand. I take it as an agreement and walk to the stairs. The girl follows me, furball still in her arms. I motion her to wait for a moment in once we reach the door to the living room and enter first. Draco is sitting slumped in his chair as usual. His long blond hair is combed and pulled back, fresh but simple clothes hanging off his still bony figure. He doesn’t really react when I enter, just keeps running his fingers over the stuffed dragon still in his lap. I kneel in front of him as I do often to be in his line of sight.
Another water exchange later I am carefully working on his face. That proves to be a slight problem as he refuses to close his eyes. So I take to carefully working around them, shielding them. Eventually though I softly push my hands over his eyelids, forcing them closed. And I am somehow relieved to not have to see that dull grey staring at me anymore. Once his whole face and head (apart from the hair of course) are clean I breathe a sigh in relief. Now he looks at least a little bit more like the Malfoy I remember. When I stroke his now clean cheek, he looks up at me, giving me another crooked smile.
“No, I only met him in Hogwarts for the first time,” I shrug, caught up in what I remember reading in Narzissa’s diary, “And by then he already went through enough to be bitter and a carbon copy of his father.”
“I am sorry,” I immediately relent, “Thank you for telling me. I hope I didn’t take up too much of your time. I will give you an excuse slip for the next lesson.”
“Could you make yourself useful for once, Potty,” he hisses, certainly there again, “And open the door for me. I don’t have a free hand and I’m not sure I can pick the saddle up again if I put it down.”
“Better than expected, I guess,” I answer with a scowl on my forehead, “I mean, he’s still responsive. Granted he lost some things but all in all I think it could have been worse.”
“Hello Draco,” she says lowly, bowing her head, trying to make herself look even less like a threat, “My name is Andrea. I won’t harm you. I just want to help you.”
“Your friend? No, not since the last time he was here with you,” she shakes her head, “Something wrong with him?” she asks as she hurries over to me.
“Maybe,” she muses, “Maybe not. No one can say how well someone can heal from mental illnesses or trauma.”
I nod, still not quite sure but I trust Hermione, so I focus back on the blonde who is sitting in a purposefully uncaring and bored position on his chair, but I can see that he is extremely tense. I try to catch the woman’s gaze, but she only nods for me to go on.
She also makes no move to hold out a hand or something which seems to calm the blonde, despite the fact that he keeps looking at the horses from the corners of his eyes every second. I have long vanished his stuffed toy or it would have fallen into the dirt when he reached for the horse. He still only uses one hand after all.
I huff from my position in front of the blond, trying to force his arms into a jacket, “It’s not funny, ‘Mione. It’s like trying to tame a toddler, except he’s taller than me and throwing fully fledged magic around.”
Nonetheless I get the impression that his eyes look a tiny bit less fogged over when I put him in bed the same evening. Progress, I hope, as I stroke his hair a last time and leave the room to fall onto my own mattress and drop off before I even pull off my clothes.
He just stares at me with that empty gaze, so I only shake my head, “You want something else?” I ask, holding out a biscuit to him. He makes a motion that could be understood as a headshake, so I put the food down. Only to notice that his eyes seem to constantly wander to the small jar of jam on the tray next to me. I grin and pick it up, “Jam? You want some of that?” another small spark shoots through his eyes and I take that as ‘yes’. I chuckle and scoop some onto my finger, “Here you go.”
Would you, as readers, prefer I upload these few chapters, but remain finished or just never upload at all?
On our way out of the room, he suddenly reaches out to a book. My balance is nearly upset by his action so he manages to knock the thing over. It tumbles open and reveals the pictures of horses inside. He gives a sound somewhere between a laugh and a squeak. As urgent as he is capable of, he pulls downwards. He manages to touch one of the animals, humming excitedly. His fingers tap against it. I chuckle.
Only to nearly crash into Professor McGonagall once I come out, “Slow down, Mr. Potter,” she frowns, catching herself on the railing, “I was just about to get you. Everyone else is leaving. Is everything alright?”
Hermione arrives at six, while Draco is back inside, dozing in the living room chair with a sleeping cat on his lap. We give him about twenty minutes more before I urge him up and into the front hallway. Getting shoes and a jacket on him is not as easy as usual. He already knows that putting these on means going out the front and he doesn’t like that, so he gives meagre resistance. We disapparate from the steps to keep his interaction with the evening bustle of the streets to a minimum.
“Tilly is honoured by young master’s words,” she squeaks happily, “Now what does young master wish Tilly to do?”
He snorts, but hurriedly changes the subject, “But you still haven’t told me what happened since my trial. Stop avoiding the question.”
“You can ask whatever you want, Draco,” I repeat a line I have said too many time in the last months, “As long as it’s possible I will do it.”
Suddenly a soft hand on my clenched fists makes me look up, only to meet Luna’s clear orbs, “You have to get him out of there,” she says with an unknown urgency, “Azkaban is harrowing and soul-destroying enough for a stable person, but someone as imbalanced as Draco…”
“Okay, I get it,” she waves her hand, “You’re right. These moments give you hope. And me too, if I’m honest. But still, Harry. Even if you manage to pull him out of there you will still put him through quite a lot. When he comes back and regains his memories, he is going to go through all that pain again. And the aftermath of it. Are you prepared to help him through that?”
I leave him alone for a few minutes, only watching him while Hermione walks away down the hall. Eventually I notice him speaking to Shenan again. At first I dismiss it as his usual childish mumbling until I listen a bit more closely.
When that question causes Dragon to meow even louder, worry creeps into my chest. Draco didn’t respond to me calling out but that’s normal. Seeing an agitated cat without any blonde human is far less usual though. I stand up straight again, calling out Draco’s name. Worry rising, I feel out for the diagnostic spells I put up around him, but I can’t feel them. Once again that doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad since he has come into the habit of disabling them with his own magic when he is clear. He clearly doesn’t want to be under constant surveillance.
“I just wondered, I know the Order had spies in Voldemort’s ranks, but what happened to those people?”
He only blinks at me, not showing any other reaction. Nodding, I lean forward and help him sit up slightly, propped against the headboard. Then I pull the stuffed animal out from behind my back. He doesn’t turn his head towards me but blinks again. I lay the dragon in his arms.
He snorts and turns away. I watch him walk away and start to follow him at a distance. Looking at him, I once again realise how far he has come. His movements aren’t as elegant and confident as they used to be, but he is walking on his own without stumbling or swaying, strong and straight. He still needs to build his muscles back up, but that’s it. His physical recovery is going extremely well, I’m not so sure about his mind yet. He stops at the door and opens it, taking a look inside. He nods and steps through. I follow him once again to make sure nothing happens. Inside are countless saddles and bridles on rows on the wall. Among them are the girths Andrea used for Draco up until now.
Hermione smiles and carefully lays a hand on my arm, “And you are right in your opinion. I agree with you. Whoever this is should be honoured and not imprisoned. But what will you do if you come to know his identity only to find out that he died in the final battle.”
I shake my head, both to get some of the water off and to try to get those pictures out of my mind, not that that works. I doubt the look on Draco’s face and those screams are going to leave me any time soon. I cringe when I can’t help but wonder how much of what Voldemort said was true and what my mind just made up to torture me. I hope it was mostly the latter.
“I am really sorry. I’m new,” the stranger explains, “I still have to learn to contain myself all the time to not scare any of the patients.”
“No,” he answers to my surprise, “I am well aware of the consequences but that is something I will not allow.”
“Yes, I came, Teddy,” I smile, ruffling his strands while still holding him a bit away from me to save myself from an aching scalp, “Sorry for not visiting for so long. I still missed you.”
When he hasn’t so much as twitched after two minutes, I start to get worried, “We can stop this if it’s still too much, Malfoy,” I say carefully, “If you can’t go out on the streets yet, that’s completely fine, we will just try again some other time.”
“Please don’t hit me!” I hear Draco whimper and my heart clenches, his voice sounds so incredibly young.
“Yeah, the scars are mostly old. From a time when he was still free. None of Voldemort’s followers would have destroyed the dark mark. However someone who didn’t take it out of free will and hates the belief attached to it, would maybe do something like that,” I explain, stroking the shredded skin.
The next day I take off from my work at Hogwarts, it’s a Sunday anyway. Instead I pour over the papers I got about Spy A. There are quite a lot for the last year of the war. Sometimes there are breaks but after such a hole there is always a whole lot of information. And it is fascinating. Whoever reported that really must have been close to the source, voluntarily or not. Positioning of many death eaters. Planned attacks. What exactly Voldemort knows and what he doesn’t.
“Hm, I guess it’s a big step,” she agrees, “But maybe it would be the right thing for you? From your stories I always had the impression that you were never completely happy with your girlfriends.”
He has rings under his eyes now from sleeping badly. I have heard him scream himself awake enough nights. Trying to comfort him after a nightmare is futile however when he’s not in a haze and only earned me scratches and a bruise. I’m not much better, his yells and the alarms from the diagnostic charms around Draco ripping me awake several times every night.
I hate Online-University. This really sucks. (And it's only been a few days) Not helped by the fact that it's a huge chaos at my university.
“It’s alright, Draco,” I try to sooth him, “No one is going to hurt you. We are just going to meet some new horses, how does that sound?”
“No offence, mate,” Ron suddenly speaks up again, “But I don’t really get why you care so much. It’s still Malfoy, the bastard who tormented us for the most part of our years at Hogwarts.”
Immediately I sit straight. I didn’t know that was on our schedule today. Maybe I should have taken a look at it before I came. But at least that new announcement forces my attention back on the lesson. And I stay focused on it for the rest of the day. I listen attentively and it is easier to understand it like that than by reading those complicated books Hermione brought and probably only she understands. Even though our teacher mostly talks about psychological disorders and it’s little more than an overview, but he also says that a lot of the basic methods can be applied to different types of situations.
Later that day, when I am about to walk to the kitchen to decide what to make for lunch, I suddenly feel a careful prodding at my front wards. I sigh, running a hand through my chaotic hair, and glare towards the entrance. Well, at least this one is polite enough. Let’s just hope that Draco doesn’t hear our visitor. He’s still incredibly skittish with new persons.
Since I was not in a good place when I first posted this chapter on fanfiction.net, I won't repeat the author note I wrote there.
“It did?” he seems confused, “Shit, my memories are all jumbled up. What happened?” I open my mouth, unsure what to say for a moment which earns me a sharp look, “The truth, Potter.”
I shake my head. My guess would be that he is using a bit of wandless magic, which is not something I can say aloud in front of a muggle. But that means that he has enough power, when he is able to control it, to push past the spell we put on him every time we come here. On the other hand, and that is the more chilling part, this can’t be the first time he did this with just one hand because I don’t think he could do that on unconscious magic alone. Or could he? I don’t know enough about magical and especially pureblood children to judge that. Another question to ask Hermione when I find the time.
He glares at me, “Azkaban. They put me there…” he stops, “No, I was at the Manor and father…” once again he shakes his head, “That’s not right either. A palomino horse…” he chokes, arms wrapping around himself, “No, shit, why I can’t I remember?”
My eyes soften, “Looking for you, of course. Like I said I was worried. Are you…” I hesitate, “Would you come back with me please?”
And this time it works as he grips his right hand in the white fur and the cat immediately changes to a calming purr. I leave him to return to the sofa as my close presence only seems to make him tenser. Instead I collect the broken mug, staring at the innocuous shards which have caused such a reaction from Draco. From what it sounded like this was an earlier memory, from his childhood rather than any time that he could have already known me. Nonetheless just after his panic he seemed to have had a moment of clarity in which he had access to all of his memories. I rub a hand over my face, watching him slowly relax with Dragon in his arms. I want to pull him into an embrace but the risk of triggering a new panic attack is too high right now. So I busy myself with cleaning up the room while keeping an eye on the blonde.
“I should have changed to the ‘light side’,” he says the words with disdain, “before they could brand me.”
It takes me several minutes until I am calm enough to lean against the cold tiles. My breathing is still ragged and tears are still running down my cheeks.
I still can’t help but feel a twinge in my heart when I see her. Is that jealousy? Possibly. Because you two seem so happy. And I am currently pretty annoyed at my own wife and all you feel when you see me is anger and disgust. Instinctively I move towards you and whoever the woman at your side is.
I come out on the hill not far from the Burrow. The small house Luna and her father rebuilt from the rubble of the last one after it was blown up during our visit there is in front of me. You see her influence clearly on the outside. The same tree is still beside the entrance and the house is coloured brightly. I smile and do the last steps to the front door. After ringing the bell I hear soft steps from the inside. A moment later the door opens and Luna’s dreamy face appears, pale hair floating around her form. She smiles at me.
“Tracking spells don’t work,” she repeats my words, “But when you said Draco was gone, I grabbed this,” she pulls out a strange device made out of swirling rings and a face of glass.
The next morning I am awoke by sunlight streaming in. I groan as I can see it shine behind my eyelids. What time is it? Due to Draco’s uneasy sleep I haven’t slept in during the past weeks. I am pretty sure there are no lessons today either, so I just bury my face into whatever softness seems to be in front of my face. Only for that softness to move. I frown, is that Dragon? But I thought he fled the bed after Draco’s second nightmare? With another deep yawn I force my eyes to blink open.
“Well, you are surely a difficult customer,” she smirks, “Maybe there is not the right cat for you here,” then she bites her lip, “But I have one last idea. Give me a second and wait here.”
“Fine, do it. He’s sleeping by now and all that is going to happen is that a sheet of paper will appear, right?” I reluctantly agree.
Hermione leaves two hours later because she has a date with Ron. I read for another hour before the letters start to blur in front of my eyes. I groan as I rub a hand over my face and put the tome aside. Stretching up, I feel my joints cracking. Grey eyes flash through my mind and my shoulders immediately sag. Of course my next move is to check up on him and I shuffle out of the door. When I arrive in front of his room, I have to take a deep breath before I manage to enter. The door creaks a bit when it swings open. My eyes land on the pale, unmoving figure on the bed.
His eyelids are half-closed and he is not properly looking at me. So he does not react to me either. I sigh and run a hand over his hair. I stand back up and turn to my friend, sad eyes meeting hers.
My head shoots up as I discover a curious Dragon poking his nose at the toddler. Andromeda smiles, despite the cautious look on her face. Teddy on the other hand seems wholly unperturbed, reaching chubby hands towards the small white cat. Dragon looks suspicious but doesn’t try to scratch. Fascinated by the picture of the small child and the cat neither of us notices his near silent footsteps until it’s too late.
“Yes,” she glares back, “And I was never planning to. I managed to get the judges to agree to accept a written statement from him. He doesn’t need to be present for that. All he has to do is give it here at home and someone, either me or you, can read it out in court. Draco wouldn’t have to leave the house for it. They even gave me a list of questions to ask him so they would get what they need,” her fingers twitch nervously again, “Do you think he can do that?”
I sigh and run a hand through my hair, “No, Malfoy. Don’t twist my words. I am not keeping you prisoner. You know your mental state is not stable enough to go out into a hospital in full work. The only times you are properly calm are here and with horses. We can’t drag a horse through St. Mungos obviously. I really don’t want to risk you suffering a relapse just because you were too stubborn to wait until you are ready.”
She sighs, some tears escaping those huge pools. Then she puts one of her long fingers to her forehead. Like a wizard would do with a wand she draws out a silver string. I conjure up a vial and she puts it in there. My hand is nearly shaking with eagerness. Finally I have found the last piece to free Draco, something I have been working towards for two years now. I thank her again then turn to leave, the now corked vial tight in my grip. Even though I hear McGonagall shouting after me, I really have no time for that now. So I hurry out of the castle. As soon as I reach the outside of the barrier I disapparate. Back in my house the next thing I do is firecall Hermione over. She stumbles out of the flames shortly after.
“Thank you. Now let’s change the topic. You spoke up for him at his first trial. You said he saved you, correct?”
When I reread this chapter for posting it again here on AO3 I noticed some issues because I was a bit frazzled at the time I originally wrote it. I tried to correct them, but didn't quite manage.
He jumps to his feet the second he sees me. His usually unresponsive left arm is holding Dragon against his chest while the right searches for his missing wand. Grey eyes narrow at me as he stands defensively.
He nods, making more notes on his board. Since he stays silent for a longer time I raise a brow, “Was that all?”
“Yes, like Draco,” she muses, surprising me with her use of his given name, “I am still waiting for the permission to visit him in his cell.”
“I’m sorry!” he stumbles away from me, tripping over a book laying on the ground. His right hand shoots up to cover his head in defence, “Please not, father.”
“No problem honestly. I understand your desire to help him and he needs it. Besides Mrs Weasley nearly forced me to come here no matter what Ron protested after I told her about it. She nearly came herself but since we found out that Draco has an aversion against the colour red we decided it’s better that she stays away,” she nods to me.
“Yes,” he says slowly, “I think I remember. You…” he stares at me confused and mistrusting, “You spoke up for me. Why?”
It’s been five weeks since Draco started horse therapy and he is getting better each time. You can really see how well he takes to this kind of therapy, muggle or not. Andrea also says that she has seldom seen a patient react this good. He is also making progress. For one he has learned to walk a good distance with just one hand on the horse’s neck and no other support. He’s still not speaking, only making noises. But Hermione explains that his memories probably reach up until infant age, which would make sense that he can’t speak then. And why he is still mostly calm. Both Hermione and the books say that once more of his memories come back and he starts to remember all the crap he went through when he got older, he will become a scared wreck once again. Looking forward to happy times, are we? So I will enjoy his childish behaviour for now.
“I know,” I bow my head, “And I am feeling really sorry for it. But it just bugged me that he apparently couldn’t move his left arm. I didn’t want it to be something physical and go overlooked. I didn’t want him to be in unnecessary pain.”
Also I am german, so terms like 'apparate' and 'splinching' are derived from the german words for it, because I have never read the books in english. If anyone can tell me the english words, I would be very thankful.
I cringe when she latches onto my arm. Even after five months in school which I spent trying to get away from her, she still hasn’t caught on to the fact that I don’t want anything from her. With a scowl I pry her away from myself again. She giggles.
“Sounds good to me,” I nod, “Search some old toy for Draco, get a cat and look into horse therapy in the muggle world,” I can’t help but chuckle, “Seems like a start to me.”
“We should also bind his magic for the time being,” I hear Hermione’s voice from behind me, “I mean, usually that’s not advised because it can hinder a patient’s development, but we are going to a muggle place. The humans and especially the horses have no experience with magic and we really don’t need him scaring any of them since he can’t control it.”
“Hello, Harry,” she says as she arrives in front of us, “And you are?” she turns to Hermione, gauging the other boy out of the corner of her eyes.
I sigh, throw a concerned look at the blonde which is met with a glare, before reading it out reluctantly, “Why did you take the Dark Mark?”
Dinner passes in a nice atmosphere as it usually does even though the missing of one family member is sorely felt. While Hermione and Ron sneak off to have some alone time after the table is cleared and the other brothers are ordered to wash the dishes, I settle with Mr and Mrs Weasley in the living room. Fits me perfectly since I wanted to ask them anyway.
“Mr. Potter, stop spacing out and pay attention, would you?” Professor McGonagall shouts at me from the front.
Yes, the Ministry does care so little about Draco's case that they don't inform their employees that Harry has already been questioned and Draco can't speak.
He doesn’t answer, barely reacts to my question but I didn’t expect differently. So I step forward and carefully help him to manoeuvre himself out of bed and onto his own feet. He complies but his own actions are smaller than they were before. Of course, it had to have some kind of set-back. Nothing would have been too perfect after all. Nonetheless I am glad he’s still mostly the same. Lifting him on his feet, I carefully start to lead him to the living room. He seats himself in his chair and presses the dragon he brought with him against his chest. The cat at least is still somewhere else in the house. As good as he is, I don’t need him possibly startling Draco further.
“Draco?” I call out carefully once I’m close enough. He twitches but doesn’t raise his head, “Draco. Can you look at me? Are you alright?”
“Dragon?” I kneel down to pet him, my cup of coffee floating in the air, “What are you doing out here alone?” he only meows, getting on his hind legs to kneed me with his front paws, “What is it?” he only meows louder, causing me to frown at his unusual behaviour, “Is something wrong?” I look up for the blonde usually not far from the cat, “Where is Draco?”
Anyway, life is chaotic right now and staying at home is doing me no favours, so I struggle with writing at the moment. That's how I ended up with this filler chapter. Next one is going to actually continue the main story, I promise (once I figure out how to).
“That’s the right mind-set,” she smiles, “You will see he will be healed one day and then you can keep him at your side forever. To live out the life you both wanted.”
As soon as that’s done, I am out on the street. I look left and right, biting my lip. Since I have no idea where Draco could have gone, I decide to start with our café. When I rip the door open, Lena looks up with wide eyes, clearly startled.
Hermione nods and follows me silently. She makes careful conversation while the leaves brew. My hands are still wavery but we both let it go for now. My own last appointment at a therapist is long overdue as well, but I really don’t want to go. Despite the fact that I am a healer in training and know that I should go. Let’s just forget that for now…
I sigh, does he have to see the worst in everything I say? “That’s not true as I already told you. My professors don’t even know that you live here.”
“I am sorry, but I will still have to take your wands. I believe you would not do anything however it is unfortunately protocol here.”
“I know,” I repeat her earlier answer, giddiness now gone from my tone, “Believe me I know. It’s actually sad seeing him like that once you sit back to think a bit about it. I meant it when I said I wanted a normal life for him. So what is it that you want to tell me?”
“He would huddle in the corner and freeze or at worst scream,” I sigh, “His reaction is flight not fight. The worst he can do is scare Teddy by screaming his ears off because he accidently hit him with something.”
It earns me a sigh while the doors swing closed behind us, “Is this about Malfoy again? I was informed that you tried everything you can to get him out of there. And while I agree with you that his punishment was way too harsh for the little crimes he committed, you could never bring forth a good enough reason so the council would believe me. I cannot rile them up against me that much.”
“If he doesn’t love you after everything you are doing for him now, he’s a stupid idiot,” she laughs and I join in after a moment.
Yeah, that everything stays the way it is. That we keep on shouting insults at each other. That we stay enemies. No one will ever know. And our son will never know his father. Severus and I will be the only ones to know his true parentage. So keep on insulting me, it’s better than trying to befriend me, it’s never gonna work. Actually this argument started because you asked why I stopped with Quidditch. Do you really care? It’s too dangerous with a child in my belly. That would have been the honest answer, but all I said was that it’s not your business. We are enemies and will stay that way forever.
“You won, I had nothing to do with it,” he shakes his head, “But it’s unimportant. I doubt I am fresh out of Azkaban, so there was more time in between my release and now. So what else did I lose?”
In the morning I am woken by something prodding me and soft curious noises. My brain is slow to register and so it takes me some time until I manage to get my eyes open. Because I am still half-asleep the only thing that really registers in my brain is pale skin and white blond hair. Mind still in protective mode, it snaps back to the time of the war, when this hair colour could only mean one thing. That danger is here. Instinctively my hand goes to my wand, it flying into my fingers.
Then she literally flees the room. I stare after her for a second until I hear a door slam open and then retching. Apparently she really got sick. Not that I can blame her. To think that Draco was hiding something like that even when we were still in school. Since she is gone, I pull the list to me to read it over on my own. A few minutes later she returns, looking pale, and falls back into the cushions next to me. I give her a short nod and she picks up the second list, the one about Draco’s mental troubles. While I finish and put away the first parchment, she only seems to turn whiter as she reads the shorter list. When she is finished, she just buries her face in her hands.
I am currently trying to change something in my study plan, but it proves more than difficult. When I call, no one picks up and my E-Mails are always answered with 'that's not our responsibility'. That is so frustrating...
Short notes: I have no knowledge of medicine or horse therapy, so this is all made up. Second, since english is not my fist language, I do not know all the riding specific words and had to use what I thought might work.
like I said at the end of the last chapter, I am really sorry for taking so long to post these chapters.
But suddenly my calm is broken as the fireplace flares up in angry green flames. And to my surprise a flustered Luna tumbles out. In her haste she has to catch herself on the sofa in front of the fireplace. Hurriedly I stand up and help her steady herself. Wide eyes under a chaotic blond mane stare at me.
We say our goodbyes and I leave the room. When I step out onto the street outside of the stable, I have a careful smile on my face. I have a good feeling about this. With a bit of luck this will be as big a help for Draco as we hoped. Keeping that thought in the forefront of my mind I apparate back to Grimmauld Place where Hermione is watching over Draco.
“Sure. Even if I did, I would just spend all my time worrying about him either way,” I snort, “Not to mention I want to be there when he becomes conscious again after today’s event to see how bad he really is.”
One last thing. You idiot! Bastard! How could you hide that from me? I am standing in front of your grave, ranting. Why did you do that?
“You want me to read it to you?” I ask, we have done that a number of times before, but usually with more distance between us.
“Well,” I squirm, “You weren’t in a good state when we got you out of there. Neither physically nor mentally. You were… I have no idea how to describe it, but it was like you weren’t there, just a shell walking around. It took us months to even get you to speak. You have been out of Azkaban for many months now.”
“It’s unfair,” I correct, “Draco didn’t even commit most of the things they charged him with. And there was no way he could have defended himself either. I am sure the decision was set before he even stepped into the courtroom.”
Suddenly all tension drains from him and my hands shoot out to catch him if he should collapse but he bats me aside, “I should have done more.”
“Sorry,” I say once again, rubbing the back of my neck, “But I’ve been busy. Hermione couldn’t take care of Draco and he doesn’t trust anyone else but me or her. Not to mention that I still have to prepare for the exams.”
“Didn’t you listen? Voldemort would have killed my parents if I tried anything like that. My father isn’t a good man and it would have been his own fault, but my mother didn’t deserve that.”
“Lunging really?” his voice sounds as haughty as I have known it to be in our first school years, but his eyes aren’t entirely clear, “I know how to ride.”
It takes me still more coaxing and he nearly focuses away again when the horse whinnies in complaint. Eventually though he turns to me, silver eyes landing on Andrea and he immediately stiffens. But she only smiles patiently.
Later I am sitting in the great hall, on the teacher’s table of course, watching over the children happily talking with their friends. Suddenly it goes silent when the door smashes open and the new transfiguration teacher marches through with a group of first years on her heels. Immediately I spot the blond head. The boy who was with you is walking in the middle of the group, looking nervous and talking with a small raven. Carefully I lean over to McGonagall, who is the headmistress now.
He looks at me but doesn’t react any further than that. So I sigh and pull him back on his feet. A quick wordless spell and the bathtub some rooms over starts to fill on it’s own. Until I get Draco there it should be about half-full. I don’t want to put more in it, since he still can’t really sit up straight on his own and I sincerely don’t want to risk him drowning.
And there goes the problem. Because I don’t love her. At least not in the way she wants it. She is like a sister to me and even Ron has accepted that by now. I know it felt like I loved her in 6th year, but back then it was probably just the most straightforward way, so I loved her. But now that I am free of Voldemort and for the first time can live just like I want without him looming over me, I feel only like a sister for her. If she would just comprehend that…
“I don’t know. I came home from looking for his horse and the house was empty. Tracking spells don’t work and he got rid of the diagnostic spells I put on him,” I explain hurriedly.
“Sorry,” I rub the back of my neck, “He’s often tired after staying clear for longer periods of time.”
He shrugs, but I can see he is relaxing just a bit, “You have done a lot for me even when I didn’t want it. I don’t like owing people.”
“Here, you have to eat that,” I lean forward, nearly touching his lips with the food, “Open up, Draco,” I say with a pained chuckle, “I never thought I would ever feed you. Eat it, please,” I urge.
“I can’t thank you enough for going through all this trouble. I know Draco was a git during school and you never liked him,” I smile at her.
She gives him a short smile, which he ignores, before she turns to me, “Keep an eye on him and ask him the rest of the questions when you think it’s the right time. It would be good if you could do it within the week though.”
“That’s for sure,” I snort, “He should have known that I have an unstable person here. Not to mention that common decency dictates to wait for someone to come to the door to begin with.”
“Yes, he didn’t recognise me at all,” her hands clench as well and her eyes turn wet, “He doesn’t seem to recognise anything. He just stared into nothing. There was no life in his eyes at all. When I came to his cell I greeted him more than loud enough. But all he did was turn his head in my direction and give a small bow. The smile he gave me was as if he was completely elsewhere. Not that I have ever seen him smile at all. I tried to talk to him but he didn’t react. My words didn’t even seem to register in his brain. He barely recognised his name. It’s like his complete soul is gone. The only time he even said anything was when he muttered a ‘Bye’ when I left. Most of the time he didn’t even seem to register that someone was there to begin with.”
“What?” my eyes shoot to her, “You want to visit Malfoy in Azkaban?” I look at her in surprise. Why would she do that? He was one of the people who held her captive in Malfoy Manor after all.
He’s beautiful, you know. I named him Orion James Malfoy. Obviously I couldn’t give him your family name. He has my hair colour and face but your eyes, nose and smile. And I can never get his hair straight. No need to question where that comes from either. Lou knows you’re his father. She figured it out by herself and I needed someone else to trust in after Sev died during the final battle. She’s still living with us.
“That’s not even the worst of it,” she grouses and I feel like someone is trying to crash my chest, “It’s not the outside that worries me. It’s true he looks awful when you see him. But what really worries me is his mental health.”
I can’t finish the sentence though because at this moment I feel a weight dropping on my thigh. Startled I nearly jump, but soon I realise that it’s not more than Draco who has put his head there, Dragon crawling over the bright locks and padding over onto my leg. The cat meows as if trying to break me out of my gloomy mood. I smile sadly and use one hand to caress the boy’s head and the other to scratch the cat behind his ears.
I look up at her with slightly tired eyes, “I’m okay, ‘Mione. It just…” I rub my hand over my face, “I fucked up.”
My throat feels like someone is squeezing it and I hastily summon myself something to drink as well, “Oh god. I didn’t know he became that bad.”
I don’t know what I expected to find, but truth is that I don’t find anything. If Draco is hiding something (which I am sure he is) then he is hiding it extremely well. Granted with Voldemort in the house he had to become pretty good at keep anything indiscriminating out of sight. I found little more than more school stuff and some unfinished sketches. So he did indeed do the drawings himself. But if I wanted to find some confirmation about whether he is Spy A I come up completely empty. I also run spells over the room to find any magic seals. I found one or two but I didn’t manage to break any. And I am not so desperate to bring a professional in here. Besides the fact that it would be a huge invasion into Draco’s private sphere which I do not want. So with a last sigh, I turn back to the door. In a last thought I carefully pry the drawing of the Quidditch player from the wall and stuff it in my pocket.
But before either of us can say anything more, a shrill cry sounds through the air. Andromeda grimaces, “Teddy is up,” not that it gets more than a chuckle from me, “I will get him.”
The bowl returns and I continue on the washing with his front. I carefully run the cloth over the more than pronounced ribs. I shudder at every knob on them that portrays one time the bone was broken. He has stopped splashing, arms just hanging limply in the water. But he is watching me, grey eyes vaguely focused on me.
“I agree but even I couldn’t stop it,” I nod, “I just wondered why you would want to see him after your imprisonment in Malfoy Manor.”
“The war ended but they wanted to make your family pay. However you were the only Malfoy they could judge so they loaded it all on you,” I start.
“I know, Mr. Potter. Thank you, I really appreciate the help,” she says before walking down the stairs again.
Yes, potions was always your best subject. The only one where you could beat even Hermione (and me any time). And over the years I saw that it was not only Snape’s favouritism. Just in the last months before you disappeared in sixth year you suddenly seemed to want to keep away from the cauldrons. I am glad you can do something you enjoy now despite your bad past. But to be honest I am more interested in your private life even though the thought of you having a wife still sends a painful stab through me. I don’t understand it but I want to know. Maybe my (I hope) old crush rearing it’s head? Doesn’t matter I am married to Ginny now…
Orion came to me yesterday. He handed me a letter. I am well over 100 now so I guess he wanted me to see it before I died. It was the last thing you wrote apparently before you left this world. He seemed ashamed when he gave it to me because the letter said to never tell me. But according to him he felt that I had a right to know.
“I have a special order for you, Tilly,” he seems nervous, is wringing his hands, “But first you have to swear to me that you will never speak of this order to anyone. Should someone ever catch you, you must never tell anyone that it was me who gave you that order. Am I understood?”
I nod, standing up, “You will be alright here on your own for a moment, right?” I ask, only receiving an annoyed glare in return. I sigh, but the way his hands clench tighter doesn’t go unnoticed. I refrain from mentioning it though and head over to the counter. Placing our orders and insisting to let me collect it myself, I keep my eyes on Draco. Nothing happens though. He sits tense and ramrod straight in the corner of our booth. He looks slightly out of place with his strained posture and somewhat fancy coat in the middle of the simple, yet cosy muggle café.
“I guess you are really better today,” I grin as I hold out another croissant to him, which he takes tentatively, “But I am afraid that we won’t be that lucky that this is a constant improvement. Nonetheless we can work on that.”
She nods back before an annoyed customer calls and she has to return to work. I just got back outside when hurried steps announce someone’s approach. When I spin around in the vain hope that it might be Draco, I discover it’s Hermione running towards me.
Tears fall from my eyes and my body starts to shake as my gaze wanders over all the other figures laying all around the clearing. All of them are dead! Everyone I cared about! Why?! What happened? I defeated Voldemort didn’t I?
She groans in response, “Still slow. It’s incredible how incompetent the Ministry pretends to be. I have brought numerous proofs that it’s only fair to pardon Draco, but nonetheless they still clamp up as soon as anyone says ‘Malfoy’. I have resorted to only referring to him by his given name or as Draco Black. I know Lucius did a lot of bad things but blaming a child for their parent’s sins is wrong.”
And getting proof is an entirely difficult matter. Those who could tell me are dead. I asked Snape’s as well as Dumbledore’s portrait but I got the same answer from both of them. ‘I am only a portrait, I don’t know everything the original knew.’ Tilly won’t tell me anything either. The only possibility would be to take memories forcefully but that’s against the law and I would never do anything like that. Also to get into the Manor would involve weeks of waiting again to get the permission. It would be easier to talk to Malfoy directly. But to get permission to speak with him in his cell in Azkaban is even more difficult and I don’t think even Luna has managed to get through yet. Not that I think he would just tell me.
I nod embarrassed, she only laughs again and stands up, “Well then. Maybe you should just try. And I could have something that would perhaps help you. But it might shock you too.”
“Nice to see you too, ‘Mione,” I chuckle, only to suppress another yawn, “I slept godawful last night.”
I step closer, purposefully making my feet loud on the concrete, and squat down in front of him, “Draco. It’s me. I’m going to put a hand on your arm, okay?”
“Well, yes it is,” she bites her lower lip, “In one way sure. His motion, mental capabilities and even character traits are coming back,” now she darts a nervous look at the man in question, “But the problem is that his memories are returning as well,” I see her swallow and I feel the dread closing around my chest, “And that means years of abuse, prison, Voldemort, torture and Merlin only knows what he saw in all the time he was forced to be a Death Eater.”
But his balance isn’t working properly yet, so he loses control over his limbs and stumbles. His shoulder painfully hits the wall, but he doesn’t make a sound as he slides down to the ground, curling in on himself. He is shaking and maybe even crying, but when I move to calm him, he lashes out, hitting in my direction.
With a spell to help me, it’s easy to get Draco inside to the living room. His head is still hanging down so I can’t see his face or how clear he is by the time I carefully drop him on the couch. He takes a shuddering breath as soon as let him go. At least he seems to be mostly aware yet though. His left arm is unmovable though, which worries me. But before I can say anything, a small meow behind me startles me. I don’t flinch but forget what I want to tell him, so I just watch Dragon bound past me to jump on Draco’s lap.
His head snaps around at my voice, eyes wide from being startled. His unbound hand misgrips and flails in the air. Since I can’t use magic out here in the open, all I can do is watch in slow motion how he falls forward off the wooden bar.
So now I am sitting in the lecture hall, twirling a quill around my fingers. As interesting as I find healing, I have difficulties focusing today, grey eyes flitting through my mind again and again.
“It never was,” I answer, “That was also why he refused Veritaserum at the trials. For one reason or another he did not want this to come out.”
While we were talking Draco has led Shenan into the hall and is now walking along the wall with her at his side. To my surprise he is not even holding the reins, only loosely slung over one arm while he is fiddling with the helmet with both hands, left fingers stiff and slow. The mare is contentedly following his lead even though he’s not touching her. Andrea smiles in wonderment as she watches him. Eventually he manages to put the helmet on, staring at the dirty thing with disdain. A wave of his hand over the black plastic has it clean in an instant. I freeze for a moment before darting nervous eyes to the muggle woman, but luckily she doesn’t seem to have noticed Draco using magic.
I nod in understanding while the guard puts all three wands into a box and seals it. Waving at us, he walks on through the door on the other side of the room. We follow him through a corridor of bright cells. A proper bed and furniture. That’s the top layer. More like a more confined version of house arrest than an actual prison. The prisoners inside look up as we pass, apparently hoping for some kind of visitor for them. Some sneer or grin at me but all stay calmly in their cells. We pass many faces I have seen at the trials. At the end of the hallway Michael leads us into an elevator, clearly only for visitors. He presses the lowest button and I swallow.
“Ginny,” I groan, taking a step away, “I have told you before that I am not in the mood for your games.”
Her eyes widen, “As believable as that makes it, only knowing that his third name starts with an A doesn’t prove that it actually is Malfoy.”
“Well, you can be sure I was,” I rub his shoulder and to my surprise feel him relax, “Without you many people would be dead and we might have lost the war.”
“Is it protocol to not even listen to the accused’s side of the story? To throw an 18 year old into the lowest level of Azkaban?” I growl, “Seriously? Do I have to explain this to every single one of you bastards?”
Only to do a step back instead. The chamber which is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside is literally stuffed with papers, folders and boxes with more files. In the front and the middle of the (barely noticeable) walkways are free sheets, thrown around randomly and folders which look like they have been just left in there without looking. Boxes with more papers are everywhere and the shelves are stuffed as well. I gulp.
I groan. Stubborn, proud Malfoy. No matter what kind of embarrassing secrets he’s keeping he should just accept it, but no, he has to be difficult. He turns his chances of getting away from here with little punishment into non-existent. Not that he is the first death eater to refuse it, but still. They will use this to pin as much on him as they can, so he will never see the sun in his life. The judge smirks.
He gives me another unintelligible sound, but doesn’t twitch when my palm makes contact with his coat. I start rubbing calming circles. They do little to actually relax him but at least it doesn’t get worse.
“And that’s all from his time in Azkaban? He was there for only two years after all,” he fidgets with the clipboard in his hands.
He just shifts his hold, then tugs carefully at them and gives some signal that is invisible to a non-rider like me. Shenan stops immediately and shakes her head contentedly. The woman in the middle gets another haughty look. She laughs instead.
I breathe a sigh in relief when I see that Draco is laying on his side in the bed, his right hand out and moving his stuffed dragon around. While at it he is doing the soft humming I heard earlier. I am not completely sure what to think of this picture. On one hand it is a very peaceful picture and is proof that he is making progress if slowly, but on the other hand seeing him reduced to the level of a small child, even though he’s over twenty, is sad. It makes me wanna curse the ministry bastards even more.
But he follows her nonetheless when she leads Shenan out of the door, though he is more likely following the horse not her. He keeps a proper distance to the mare’s rear but he can’t manage to catch up with her yet because his walking is still slow. Inside the riding hall, Andrea hands Draco the long rope she has attached to one of the bridle’s rings. His hand reaches out to take it but looks ready to pull back the moment the woman so much as twitches the wrong way.
Nonetheless it’s progress so I am humming lowly as I walk down the hallway. I come past Draco’s room and out of habit throw a look through the partially open door. I grind to a halt immediately though.
“Because it’s a valid question,” she grimaces, “Not to mention I think they need to hear his honest answer to that.”
“Draco isn’t so well today, little one. I’m sorry,” I turn to my patient, “Stay there, Dragon. I will take Draco back to bed and you can cuddle with him again tomorrow.”
“Man seriously, you are going to empty Azkaban of prisoners if you continue like that,” Ron sighs, causing Hermione to giggle and me to glare at him.
When I wake back up, six hours later, we have moved and I have stretched out along the couch. To my surprise I discover Draco laying half on top of me, sleeping peacefully nonetheless. His right hand is curled into my shirt and it seems as if he is using me as a replacement for his stuffed dragon. Not that that changes anything about the soft, warm feeling spreading through my chest at feeling the other man so close while still calm and peaceful. So I just stroke his head and let him sleep on, my arms wrapped around him.
I smile as I carefully approach him a few minutes after he has regained control over his right arm and is stroking Shenan’s head. His eyes land in my direction but he doesn’t move from his position next to the animal. He doesn’t even twitch when I settle on her other side. My staring at him is interrupted by an amused chuckle next to me though.
“Why are you so grumpy? I thought you would be happy to see me,” she smiles, trying to press herself against my body.
“What?” she looks back at me in surprise, not the response she expected to the diary, “That one you talked about? Not that I know of. Why do you ask?”
“You really couldn’t,” I sooth him as I kneel before him when he sits down on his bed, “You kept Luna and Ollivander alive and risked your life to get information to the Order.”
“What do you mean?” immediately I am down at his level again, eyes scanning his form for injuries, “Are you hurt? Did you fall?”
“Yeah, I understand what you mean,” I kneel down in front of his chair and take up a croissant to hand it to him, “Here Draco. Eat.”
“No, my father might have told Voldemort and my mother’s occlumency shields weren’t strong enough to hide it properly,” he still seems comparatively calm, “Too much of a risk.”
“Of course you did, silly boy. You fell for my trick,” he smirks evilly, then bows down and picks up a figure in front of him, who I couldn’t identify because they were laying with their back to me.
When I open my eyes again we find ourselves in the impersonal room I visited back at the Manor. It didn’t look much different when Draco still lived in it. Seems kind of lonely. When Hermione lands next to me, I exchange a look with her, only to see her frown at the room. When I turn my eyes back to front, I see the figure I have been searching for. Draco is standing there, pale like a ghost but with a determined glint in his eyes which I have seldom seen on him. Tilly is standing in front of him, looking apprehensively up at her master.
“Tilly has understood,” she nods eagerly, “No matter what should happen, Tilly must never tell anyone that it was young master who gave that order.”
The moment the spell hits him, his whole figure crumbles. Every muscle goes lax and he falls into the armchair. I can shoot forward just in time to keep him from falling straight off the chair too and land on the ground. I sigh in relief when I feel his shallow but steady breathing on my arm.
I repeat this process more times than I can count. I have to wash the cloth every few inches of skin. It’s unbelievable how dirty he is. That is far below any human living conditions. It wrings a pained and sarcastic snort out of me though when I compare him to how he acted back at Hogwarts. Always looking perfect, not a hair out of place (well, the first years at least). I was sure he spent longer in front of the bathroom mirror each day than our whole boys’ dorm together. Not one bit of that is left in him now. His skin is covered in layers of dirt. His hair hangs below his shoulder blades, stringy and tangled. The once so shining platinum blonde is a dirty grey now. I sigh as I push the greasy locks over his shoulder to start on his upper back. Once I have cleared away the dirt, I spot a whole network of scars, so many finer ones but also huge cuts. I shudder and supress another sob. He rips me out of my sad thoughts as he makes some kind of squealing sound as he splashes up more water with his right hand, effectively raining water over both of us. I sigh and run my hand over his head.
Of course he only stares at me in response. I can see the snout of the little dragon poking out under the blanket by his chest. He still has it pressed against his chest. I smile a little bit at that. Nonetheless I bend down and carefully straighten him up. With slow movements I animate him to help me lift him out of bed and onto his own feet. After wrapping a warm sleeping robe around him, I try to guide him to the door. Still I notice that he is even more reluctant than usual and his free right arm twitches back towards the bed unsurely. That’s when I notice that the dragon is still laying in the blankets. I give another sad smile and wandlessly summon the stuffed toy. As soon as it lands in my hand I press it back in his. His face twitches in what is his version of thanks, then he lets me lead him into the living room and his usual chair. There he presses animal back against his chest.
“I’m sorry for pushing you this morning,” I mumble, “After hours of reading through medical terms that go over my head… Anyway, what all those books said is that especially at the beginning you should give the patient time to adjust,” my head falls onto the mattress next to him, “I promise when you wake up, I will be more careful. But for now, just sleep.”
“Works similar to a muggle tracker. The muggle version would need a specific sender it can find, but with this thing we can set it on a magic signature. It’s far from precise and can only tell us if we’re in a certain radius of the signature. It’s better than nothing certainly. Of course you can block that with spells too, but I don’t think he considers it,” she smiles at me, “I had recorded Draco’s signature. It’s already inputted.”
“I know, I was just worried,” I sigh, tuck Draco’s arm back against his body and stroke his hair a last time before standing up.
Both of us startle badly and shoot around to see a pale Draco in the doorway. He is leaning against the frame, using his right hand to support his body against the wood. He has dressed himself in a white dress shirt, even though it looks a bit wrinkled, just like his pressed pants. His eyes are tired over the dark circles. His first steps into the room are wobbly and he takes the much longer route around the massive table just to not pass too close to where we are sitting.
“I fell,” he glares over my shoulder, “The concrete broke open over there,” he nods at a hole in the pathway I didn’t even notice when I ran up to him, “The impact of my face to the floor stopped my panic at least enough so I could drag myself here.”
Suddenly the only other patient still here, a disabled girl down the hallway squeals loudly in happiness. Of course that startles Draco badly. He jumps, causing Shenan to throw her head up as well. He gives a short yell, before clear grey eyes fog over again. His head drops down as does his left arm, returning to unusable. I sigh and run a hand through my hair.
“It’s not fair. He didn’t deserve that!” I growl, shoving past them to get to the firewhiskey in the living room cabinet.
“I agree with you,” she says softly, “But maybe soon something will happen that will finally open the possibility to free him.”
“I am fine, Potter. And don’t call me by my first name,” he snaps back, eyes fixed past me on the front door.
“Alright then,” I say to the empty room, “Let’s see how fast I can bring this mountain of paper down.”
I look around and spot the requested item a few feet away from me, the label reading ‘Shenan’ clearly. I grab it and try to hand it over to him. His right hand clenches more in the light hair and he presses his left arm against his chest. He either doesn’t want me to touch it or doesn’t want to touch me with it. So I squat down in front of him, making sure to move slowly and not startle him. He watches me warily but doesn’t move away. Shenan whinnies comfortingly and nudges her nose into his neck, but his eyes are fixed on me. Carefully I position the box by his feet and retreat again, stepping back to allow him room.
I smile back carefully, “None taken. And no, it’s not for me. It’s a… friend of mine. But he,” I clear my throat uncomfortably, “He‘s not in any state to come here on his own.”
“Well, I’m simply different than you,” he mumbles lowly, making it difficult for me to understand him.
So instead she steps next to me with a sigh. Shenan’s gallop is calm and slow. He lets the reins go and for a moment I think that his strength ran out but then I realise it was on purpose. It takes two rounds of gallop before I suddenly see his eyes flicker. And he seems to notice it too as he carefully slows the horse down without ever recollecting the reins. She slows to a trot and then a walk, whinnying softly. He strokes her neck for a moment, teeth gritted. I can basically see him fighting with himself and his tiredness. I also see the moment he loses the fight as the light goes out of his eyes and he slumps in the saddle, nearly loosing balance to the side as well. I stabilise him with a nonverbal spell because neither of us is close enough to catch him.
“She isn’t aggressive,” he shakes her head, “As long as no one comes close to her she doesn’t care. We bought her cheap because she was supposed to be slaughtered. But she is too fine a horse for that. We can’t ride her, but we can still breed with her. This stable is also part of an organisation saving young horses from getting sold to the slaughterhouses. Also she’s not part of the horses for students. She just lives out here and usually she stays far away from human contact.”
Also this is totally not how I planned this chapter to go. Originally they were supposed to walk to the café, have a calm, peaceful conversation about horses or Quidditch or some other safe topic and then return home. Instead the scene took on a whole different turn on it’s own. Now somewhere halfway through the conversation, we veer off deep into angst and sadness territory. The reason for that was probably that I was watching the end (episode 24) of the anime Assassination Classroom while I was writing this. I hate sad endings T.T
But you. You are mentally healthy and you are part of the Malfoy family. The judge wants to sentence you to Azkaban. Bullshit in my opinion. You were only sixteen when you disappeared and all the big events happened afterwards. You have never done anything wrong. Granted I was shocked when you revealed that you had the dark mark on your left arm. But during questioning under Veritaserum you said you were forced to do so by your father. The judge didn’t believe you, what an idiot, you are not capable to lie while under Veritaserum. But in the end, they believed me luckily when I spoke up for you. For once I am glad for my influence as the saviour of the wizarding world. It still took some convincing but in the end you were let go free. Thank god.
“You have to understand. The judges are biased. All they hear is the name ‘Malfoy’, they think deatheater and the last thing they want is to do him any good. They were disgruntled enough that he won’t come to court, but relented when I handed them a censored version of the list of his problems. Every step towards justice for him is a fight and the more he cooperates, the easier it will be,” she seems just as desperate.
He doesn’t look up, doesn’t shake off my touch, but he shakes his head, “No, I won’t. You’re not the only one who has been reading up on my condition. Even… “ he chokes and I can hear how his throat is closed up. I don’t speak just let him talk, the slightest bit worried about what he is going to say, “Even if… I recover. Which… which I still… doubt,” it is obviously difficult for him to say what he means, “I won’t – “ he chokes again, “I will never recover all of my memories. It’s impossible.”
She approaches me, a thick book in her hands and then holds it out to me, tapping on the page, “This is a diagnose spell. I want to run this over Draco. To see what he has. There are two I want to use. One is for physical stuff, but it also lists the scars and alike. The second is for mental health.”
Nonetheless my whole body tingles with the itch to assure myself that Draco is still safe in his own room. So as soon as I am sure that I won’t fall if I let go of the sink, I hurry out of the bathroom.
“And I am supposed to believe you?” he snorts, doing his best to regain his old haughty behaviour, but his whole form is tensed to run.
“I agree,” I smile as I watch Draco eat the bread, until he does the little food hiding thing again. I chuckle tiredly, “And that’s something he learned in prison too. Always keep food stores. I will have to watch out that my house doesn’t start to smell of rotten food soon.”
“You didn’t pay much attention did you?” she sighs and stands up, “You thought about Draco the whole time am I right?”
“There is no denying you are a Death Eater, boy,” the judge spits, reminding me uncomfortably of uncle Vernon, “In fact, as a Malfoy you belonged to you-know-who’s inner circle. And you want to tell me that you never killed anyone?”
First I hand them the new stuff for the Order I found in the chamber today. Except that about Spy A. Arthur nods thankfully. Then I draw a breath.
“I went to school with him and I haven’t seen him for a long time. I just want to know what he has been up to these days.”
It takes me a long time to work his hair straight. Combing, wetting it, washing the dirt out and get at least a bit of shine back in it. He relaxes into my touches as far as he is able to do that. A soft sound leaves his throat, reminding me of a croon as I work the last of the shampoo out of his hair. I washed it four times by now and it is slowly returning to a nice mane, if you are not looking at the haggard ends. It loses the grey, but still doesn’t regain the slight golden sheen it had in our younger years anymore. It looks still way too white for my liking, but there is little I can do about that now. Since I am not good with cutting hair I will wait until Hermione returns and let her do it. I sigh as I pull the now wet strands into a lose bun to keep them out of my way. Rubbing sweat from my forehead, I note contently that he is now completely clean again from the hips upwards. I have also washed his upper body with more than one different product, all for sensitive skin after all his time in Azkaban.
His head shoots up in surprise then he nods again, “Yes, for now that’s enough. Thank you for your time, Mr Potter.”
The girl and I give our greetings back, but the blonde only buries himself in the horse’s neck in distrust. The woman smiles at him anyway, carefully approaching further.
“This morning he seemed pretty well. I mean he could show me yes and no. He even recognised his own name. He was much more aware than usual, so I tried to get further,” I burry my face in my arms, “I wanted to find out why he doesn’t move his left arm. If it was a physical reason, we could have fixed it. But when I tried to reach for his left arm, he twitched. It looked like he wanted to get away. I thought he was just ashamed and I made it clear to him that it didn’t matter. I thought he understood so I pushed further to see whether there was something wrong with his arm. And apparently…” I swallow, “I pushed him too far. He freaked out completely. He was shaking like a leaf, white and sweating. His face was so empty, the eyes so haunted. It looked so sad, so painful,” I shudder unconsciously, “And you know what the worst thing was? He should have been screaming his lungs out with the panic attack he was having. But through all of it, he did not make any sound. Not a single sound. It was seriously creepy.”
I live a happy life afterwards. I will never be able to forget that one night we shared while you will never remember it. Lou is always there when I need her. I can even face you without having to fight the wish to run. We actually have another child, despite the fact we only sleep with each other two times in all our lives. A sweet little girl, Orion loves her to bits. He becomes an incredibly strong wizard, an auror, and his sister a healer. Lou and I are so proud of them. Despite the fact that we are married, we would still never call us lovers, but we are happy with each other. She dies two years before me. I am over seventy now and so are you. I have written a letter to Orion in which I am telling him the whole story. He will get it once I passed. Fascinating you will live longer than me, but don’t worry he won’t come to you.
She nods, face thoughtful though, “I agree. This is a great start and I don’t want to worry you. However don’t be too careless. Like his condition, the way he reacts to Dragon could change within the span of hours. He’s not stable enough yet to hold a mood.”
“You didn’t, but you forget I grew up in a pureblood household too. The pressuring and punishments were a daily occurrence, more for the boys than the girls, but still. Add to that Lucius’ sadistic tendencies…” she shakes her head, “I don’t want to imagine.”
I smirk, “Yeah,” bending down I lift the little bundle of fur out of his cage, “Hermione meet Dragon.”
Unfortunately before I can say anything more the door behind me creaks open. As it catches Andromeda’s attention, the flames brighten once again. I don’t even have time to look around before a scared screech sounds from the door. Immediately I am on my feet to see Draco cowering against to the doorframe, his hand gripping the cat in his arms so hard, it causes the animal to screech in protest at the nails digging into his flesh. Hearing Dragon’s sound, Draco lessens his grip and pulls the small body in front of his face, palm flattening so that he doesn’t hurt the cat any further.
“But yes he told me that you saved him. I hope you don’t expect a thank you from me now for that. It was before the time I can remember,” he continues and does a good impression of your sneer.
“That’s a risk we will have to take, I’m afraid,” she chances a look at me, “I’m not sure we will ever get justice for him if he doesn’t give his statement now. You don’t have to ask all of the questions at the same time, you can split them up. Pick a time when he seems alright and ask the first few. When you notice it is getting too much for him or he’s having some kind of flashback, stop and try again when he’s feeling better.”
Life has caught up with me again. The school year finished with me not finding so much of a scrap of new information. Hermione and I tried every last loophole to get Draco out of prison but no chance.
“No one to interfere?” he frowns, “How does that work? I know his problems are more psychological but what exactly do you mean?”
“Yes, a start is better than nothing,” she smiles at me but I only drop my head into my hands. So she lays a hand on mine, “He is going to get better, I promise Harry. We are going to help him. Don’t give up hope.”
He doesn’t respond, so I repeat my question. When he continues to remain silent, I carefully nudge his face from where it’s buried in my stomach. Only to discover his grey eyes closed. His face is still pulled in a frown and he is not sleeping completely peacefully, but he is asleep. I am very tempted to bury my face in my hands. It’s not the first time one of his alarms ended with him falling asleep again after talking to me for a few seconds. Sometimes he can’t even remember that in the morning, but I certainly wakes me up every time. Luckily I have adapted to sleeping for a few hours only from my days on the run.
This chapter is also as far as I ever uploaded on fanfiction.net. I have more already wrtten chapters on my computer, but for whatever reasons I could never motivate myself to update them there. Not sure if I'm ever going to do that. I will probably just continue here.
“So what?” he glares but I can see his fingers dig deeply into his thin arms until they are creating red dents in the white skin, “Am I supposed to drop to the floor in gratitude in front of you now?” his lips pull into an aggressive, hateful smile, “Or maybe present my ass? Is that the way you want me to show my gratitude? The guards certainly seemed to enjoy it.”
She throws me another concerned look, but nods and unrolls the first parchment, “Okay, this is just for the physical injuries, but it also dates them by month.”
Even though I think to have the puzzle completed, finding proof turns out to be near impossible. No matter how many times I apply for permission to visit Draco in Azkaban it is refused each and every time. Not even playing the ‘Saviour Card’ (as Hermione calls it), no matter how much I hate to do it, helps. I have been to the Manor again, but there are more sections sealed than open and another search of Draco’s room brought nothing new. The seals I found last time have disappeared too, but Hermione told me of magic seals that only work if they are continuously infused by their creator’s magic, otherwise they self-destroy and take whatever was sealed inside with them.
Seeing as he is about to break down, I instinctively wrap my own arms around him. For a moment he fights me. Then he drops and I already want to sigh that his mind is lost again, but then his left hand clenches into his shirt.
She shrugs again, “I don’t know. At the moment there is little to nothing to take care of. They pay for Narcissa’s care but apart from that there wasn’t anything else to the Malfoy name. I may have gotten the admission to return part of the properties that now belong to Draco, but that doesn’t mean that the Ministry is actually doing so. They used the money they took from former Death Eater families to give sanctions, gifts and those kind of things to war heroes. The same with the properties. They were given as presents to fighters of the light side whether they were really deserving of them or not.”
My smile nearly falls at seeing manila folder after folder again in the box. But with the knowledge (or maybe rather hope) that I found something important or at least interesting I grab the first folder (nicely labelled with a roman number one) with as much eagerness as I can muster. And at the start it really is what I would have suspected. Bills for sweets. A huge order of lemon drops. A bill for jellybeans, toffees and fruit candy. And so on.
Because of that I am understandably tired when I drag myself out of bed early the next morning. My first action is to get coffee. Normally I prefer tea but right now I am too tired to carry on without the bitter beverage. After taking a shower I set to prepare breakfast for myself and something simple for Draco. Hermione comes through the floo, yawning as well, just as I am finished wolfing down my own food.
Second, these chapters were written years ago and now reading through them again to find mistakes I missed last time, I am not as happy with how I wrote it, but it's too late to make major changes. But it's only a few chapters before I like my own story again.
Lou has experienced sexual abuse from a young age, so she is very sensitive when it comes to someone touching her. But apart from that she’s the best person I could imagine. And Orion loves her like a mother already. He even asked when I would marry her, so he could have a mommy.
“I found a section in this book which describes nearly perfectly Draco’s situation. Not the background or the trauma itself but his condition now,” she clears her throat, “Anyway, it mentions over and over again that you should give the patient something to hold onto. Something physical. They advise is to use something from the childhood for example.”
“A potion could negatively affect his healing process and it feels wrong to put him under with a spell just so I can sleep for a few hours,” I grumble into my pillow.
I know I'm one week late, but I've either been actually busy or falling into holes which meant I was in no mood to do anything, updating included. Since I've been repeatedly told not to apologize for having a life, I won't even though I want to.
He nods, tapping the paper again. I give him a smile and stroke his hair. Then I take up the book. In all honesty it’s nothing special. A muggle book about horses. What types races there are, how to tend to them, famous horses in history and so on. I think I have read it for him about three times already but it’s his favourite after all. So I lay it on my lap while Dragon wriggles on the blonde’s to get more comfortable. Draco strokes the white fur and I start to read out loud.
Stepping out of the front door still has him tensing and trying to pull away and return to the safety of the house and Dragon. But in the end he lets me pull him along even if he is clearly reluctant. He doesn’t protest apparating but when we appear in an unfamiliar setting, his muscles immediately tense in preparation to run away. I hold him tight without hurting him as he stares at me with wide grey eyes.
Ginny and I are starting to drift apart as well. I try my best, but it just doesn’t feel as right as it did once. She is still fawning over me and I am getting annoyed by it. As soon as all of our children are at Hogwarts I spend as much time there as I can. She is angry because of that, but to hold up our marriage we stay put.
I hope you liked the first part of 'The unknown spy'. If you want to continue reading you can go to fanfiction.net and read it there if you want. Otherwise I will try to start the next part soon, but I need to come up with a title and work my way through tagging first.
She smiles, “I understand you, but pushing him into anything is only going to get you negative results. It is highly likely that the reason he doesn’t move his left arm is psychological and has nothing to do with pain. Why are you even so concerned? I am sure once he gets better, he will be able to move both his arms again.”
Unfortunately this single occurrence turns out to be more of a set-back than I originally suspected. As well as Draco took to the cat the first days after his arrival, after being scared by the little animal once he starts to develop a tendency to act twitchy around Dragon. Luckily the cat is persistent and patient and manages most of the times to eventually climb on the blonde’s lap and be petted. Every time he manages that, Draco too becomes calmer for the rest of the day.
“And now to the second part of today’s lecture. The reason this is a mandatory one. Because today we start with the subject of psychological illnesses,” the voice of our teacher rips me out of my musings.
“I’m not. I’m well aware that the world is not fair. We’ve all lived through too much to believe that.”
“Please Draco. I need to know why you can’t or won’t move your left arm. There has to be a reason for it. If it really doesn’t hurt, then that can’t be it. You don’t have to be ashamed of anything, I promise,” I plead with him, but he just shakes his head again.
“The cane?” I state with confusion and dread at the realisation that that fancy walking cane Lucius was carrying around was not just used for hiding his wand. Swallowing past the bile in my throat, my eyes land on the old umbrella again. The thing is broken, part of the colourful screen torn off. With a lot of imagination or maybe a panic-clouded mind, it could be mistaken for the walking cane of Lucius Malfoy. When Dragon knocked it over it must have somehow triggered a flashback of when his father tried to hit him with it. I sigh a heavy breath.
“And even if I am,” you blush, “At least I am not sleeping with everything on two legs in the vicinity.”
“I know,” I sigh, but before I lose myself in thoughts about Malfoy again, I focus back on the actual reason for my visit here, “Since we are already on the subject of Malfoy Manor, I want to ask something.”
I yawn and let her pull me onto my feet. She pushes me into the bathroom and tells me to clean up. I stare at the picture in the mirror with annoyance. My glasses are askew on my face, my hair even more chaotic than usual and my right cheek is red with the pattern of the carpet imprinted on it. My eyes have deep circles underneath them and I sigh as I splash my face with cold water.
My first instinct is to run outside but I don’t think I will get far completely on my own. I need someone to help me. A trace spell still comes up empty. Draco used to be a very good wizard and when he’s clear, he has nearly all of his abilities. His control is a bit wonky, but he can perform any simpler spells he remembers, including blocking spells, so he can’t be tracked. Hermione is the obvious choice for help. For a moment I think of running to the fireplace but instead I summon a Patronus to send it off to my friend.
Who is he? He looks a lot like you, you know. Is he your son? That would fit, but isn’t he a bit old? If he’s eleven years… If I would count back wouldn’t that be still in our school time? I doubt that. So your cousin or something like that? I never knew there were more Malfoys.
Running through the woods. Where am I? After a moment I recognise the Forbidden Forest. I swallow. Nothing good comes from there, especially when it’s as dark as it is right now. And I am correct when I hear a cackle from behind me.
I just smile and lean back into my armchair, taking a sip from my tea. After a few moments of silence her brow furrows though.
Eventually we reach his room again. I lower him on the bed and he lays down on his own. His apathy is starting to wear off, slowly though. He is mostly only reacting to himself unfortunately. Outside influences like other people or his environment are still basically non-existent to him. Well, like I told Hermione, every step forward, no matter how small, is progress.
I rub the back of my neck, “On our first meeting you reminded me of my cousin, who…” I bite my lip for a moment thinking about how to word it, “wasn’t nice to me. I had only just learned about the wizarding world and was overwhelmed. So I saw Dudley in you and wanted nothing to do with you,” a self-deprecating smile comes to my face, “But by now I’ve learned not to judge a book by it’s cover. It was a Gryffindor who betrayed my parents and I know two Slytherins who risked their lives for the light side. But at eleven I couldn’t really see past black and white.”
He is standing with his back to me, bare-chested, in front of the full-length mirror in the room. The shirt I helped him put on this morning is hanging from his left hand while the right seems to be exploring his scarred skin. He looks a lot better than he did when he first came here but it’s still no comparison to when he used to take care of himself either yet. He is still overly thin despite our attempts to get some meat back on him. The muscles he used to have due to Quidditch have disappeared, leaving a fragile looking man in their wake. His skin is also nearly white, since he still spends most of his time inside. From where I am standing I can see all the scars on his back. I looked up ways to remove them but it will take time or possibly never disappear completely.
I stroke his head a last time before I try to stand up to get away from him. Only to fail. Draco’s hand is clutched in my shirt and he is holding me too tightly. I smile softly and shake my head. Carefully I try to detach his hand. Only for it to barely work. His grip is tight, the hand clutching like a vice.
I swallow as the possible implication of what she just said sinks in, “A walking cane?...Please don’t tell me his father beat him with that cane of his?”
“That was two years ago, Ginny. I changed a lot. The war changed everyone. You are like a sister to me, Gin. I said that before. A sister not a lover,” I explain exasperatedly.
“I guess?” I am not entirely sure what I am supposed to say to this and I’m sure you can hear it in my voice.
She shrugs, “I wouldn’t say so. He’s unresponsive as always. I haven’t really spent enough time with him to judge that.”
I glare at him, “But he is also a boy who has been forced into his role as much as I have. I am pretty sure neither his father nor Voldemort ever asked whether he really wanted to be a death eater. I can understand him in that,” I shake my head, “Besides the fact that the court was simply not just. I can’t let it stand like that. If we start with isolating and being unfair to the death eaters now, we are not much better than them, who did the same thing to muggleborns.”
