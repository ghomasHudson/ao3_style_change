Harry glanced over at his best friend, not surprised to find Ron's face once again as red as his hair.
“She's right. You can't go. That's suicide and he won't spare anyone if you sacrifice yourself.” Draco agreed.
“I want to visit Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing that sign at the wedding. Maybe he knows more about it.”
“Yes, I am. Those bloody reporters pissed me off. Pretty much everything pisses me off right now. And you know what happens when I get angry.”
“Maybe he just hasn’t realized it yet.” Daphne mused. “Lavender also said he’s pretty dense when it concerns relationships. He and Ron always needed Hermione Granger to help them analyse their feelings. Yes, that must be it. He just doesn’t know that he’s in love with you.”
The blond shrugged and gestured to the other armchair. “Why don't you take a seat? Have a drink. I've only got hot chocolate and pumpkin juice, but I could call an elf if you want something else.”
Harry could only watch the exchange silently, still too shocked by all these unexpected events and Wormtail's gruesome death to really comprehend what was happening. Thundering footsteps were drawing nearer and then a group of Death Eaters appeared at the other end of the hall, lead by an all-too-familiar, dark-haired woman.
But it was already too late. As soon as Harry had spoken the name, there were cracks of apparition all around them. Draco heard Hermione yelling something that sounded like a jinx and raised his own wand, only to realize that it was no use. They were surrounded by hulking figures and heavily outnumbered. He counted at least seven people. It was too dark to make out more than their silhouettes. His heart sank.
“No, he didn’t. He wanted to, but since he decided to forego his NEWTs he really has no reason to be here, so McGonagall wouldn’t allow it.”
Harry feared he might have to come to terms with the fact that he was stuck with Malfoy for good. "Can you tell me anything else?"
He began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Draco felt about ready to start sobbing, too. He was no fan of the old elf by far, but he pitied him nonetheless. Kreacher had obviously adored Regulus. And then he’d been forced to watch him die and he hadn’t even been able to carry out his last orders...
Katie was taken to St. Mungos the next day. The news of the attack spread quickly, but no-one knew that she hadn't been the target, save for the teachers and those who had witnessed the whole thing. Dumbledore dismissed Harry's concerns about Nott as well, when the dark-haired boy voiced them during their next meeting. He merely told Harry that he would handle things and asked him to concentrate on school and the upcoming war with Voldemort instead.
Yes, he needed to calm down. Harry needed him to be strong. And Remus needed him to explain what had happened.
Once they reached the exit, Harry hung back. Hermione gave him a knowing look and ushered the others back towards the castle. He mouthed "Thank you" in her direction, before heading to the changing rooms. Once there he ducked into a hidden corner, where he wouldn't immediately be spotted, but could keep an eye on the doors to the changing rooms.
When the other two boys just gave him blank looks he reminded: “Christmas lunch. Don't tell me you forgot that mum invited you all.”
The blond was still a little doubtful, but Potter made himself comfortable on the edge of the mattress and gave him an expectant look.
He sat there for a long time, staring at the neatly written lines. He had no idea who might have sent him that letter. But the sender had been right about one thing - Harry did understand. He understood about the ghosts of the past haunting you and he understood about regrets. He regretted so many things. After what felt like hours he finally got up and threw the letter into the trash bin. A few minutes later he fished it out again and hid it away in a drawer instead.
Harry pressed his mouth to the Snitch and they all waited expectantly. At first it looked like nothing would happen. But then writing appeared on the smooth, golden surface. Five tiny words: I open at the close.
Harry felt relieved to hear that. In his opinion Dumbledore was incredibly selfish to ask that of Snape.
Was this what love felt like? This happy feeling from just being close to the other boy. Missing him when they were apart, even if it was just for a few hours. Getting jealous when some girl tried to flirt with the Gryfffindor, even though Harry usually not even noticed the flirting. The worry he felt when he woke at night with a pounding heart, feeling a fear that wasn't his own and knowing that Harry'd had another nightmare.
"And... that's bad?" Harry asked. He'd obviously learned nothing during Care of Magical Creatures. Not that Draco could blame him, given Hagrid's rather ... unique way of teaching.
Potter stopped right next to their table, staring down at him. Draco felt himself blushing, remembering all the things Potter had overheard a few days ago. When he'd been spying on him. Rage replaced his embarrassment. But before he could tell Potter off, Astoria beat him to it.
Harry was glad that he didn't appear disgusted at finding them in bed together. The situation was awkward enough without his best mate throwing a fit. Well, he was having a laughing fit, which was at least better than shouting. Only Draco obviously didn't think so.
Sirius shrugged. “Might as well. He’s not going to be dumb enough to try to escape.” He trained his wand on Mundungus and the rope fell away.
“Well, Moony figured it was high time I gave you the Talk. But judging from the sounds I heard coming from my little cousins room last night, I guess I'm a little late for that.”
Harry felt unable to move. Numbly he allowed Draco to pull his shirt off. He shuddered when he felt the blond's lips against his naked skin.
The Gryffindor wondered if he would continue to be surprised by this strange, honest version of Malfoy. Had the boy always been like that? Had he really never known the true Draco?
At his words, Remus face appeared at his shoulder, giving Harry a smile. "Do you want to talk about the nightmare?" he inquired.
Sleep actually sounded like a pretty brilliant idea. “I’ll do that.” Draco agreed. “I just need to use the loo first.” He swung his legs out of bed, but as soon as he was on his feet, he had to clutch the bedpost for support as a wave of dizziness washed over him.
Ron was officially dating Lavender Brown since that fateful party in the Gryffindor common room. Which meant that the red-head now spent pretty much all of his free time lip-locked with her. Harry shuddered whenever he heard the girl's high pitched voice shouting: “Won-Won!”. It made him glad that he'd never gotten that far with Cho. And while he was happy to get more time alone with Draco, he still missed hanging out with his best mate.
“Don't worry, Pansy. Madam Pomfrey will have you cured in no time.” he promised in a gentle tone. She blinked at him, looking unsure and wary. “You'll be fine in a few hours. It was only meant as a warning, after all. But if you don't stop with your ridiculous antics, I won't be so nice next time. You really should know better than to mess with me.” he finished gravelly.
“If I'd known that Ginny was hoping I'd fall in love with her, I would have talked to her sooner. I just thought she had gotten over that stupid crush she had on me.” Harry muttered.
They finally reached the village, where Daphne dragged them into Gladrags. She and Lavender spent an awfully long time browsing through the shop and trying on different robes, but didn't buy anything in the end. At least Hannah found a new winter coat and Neville bought a hat. Next stop was Scrivenshafts, where Lavender took ages to pick a new quill.
“A hundred percent sure. It was most likely the real Horcrux. Sirius also found out that his brother wrote the note. He must’ve stolen the Horcrux and hidden it at Grimmauld Place.”
“I know what you mean. Of course we believe what we’ve been taught all our lives. Usually you don’t question your parents. You look up to them. Unless something happens that makes you question them. And then it still takes time to realize that maybe what you’ve been taught was wrong.”
Rookwood laughed and eased up for a moment. “Having enough already? We're only getting started. I can't wait to try some other things on you.” he taunted. Without warning he aimed another curse at Harry and suddenly the boy's skin felt like it was on fire. He whimpered in pain and tried to crawl away, but it was no use. The Death Eater only laughed and hit him with another curse that made his muscles seize up. Neither of them noticed when another person arrived on the scene.
"Yes. Bellatrix will most likely be with her. Draco said she's following his mother around. Probably to make sure she doesn't run off. He thinks she could be using polyjuice."
“It would make sense. And remember what Lovegood said about the invisibility cloak. I never really thought about it, but Harry's cloak is really special.”
“Because we couldn't. We ran right into a group of snatchers. They're everywhere. Gangs trying to round up Muggle-borns and blood-traitors. There's a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured.” she explained. “We look like we might be school-age, so they thought we were Muggle-borns in hiding. Luckily they weren't the brightest.”
“Stop being pessimistic. He's with Dumbledore. He would never let anything bad happen to Harry. And they're just going to get the Horcrux. They're not going into battle or something like that.”
"I did some research, like you asked. There really isn't much to be found about Horcruxes in most books. Which is a good thing, if you ask me. Because Draco was right about the Black library being very extensive. Especially where the dark arts are concerned."
"The piece of Voldemort's soul that has been living within you has been destroyed. You are no longer a Horcrux." Snape confirmed, before turning to Draco: "And you are no longer a death eater. Your allegiance has been broken."
Harry glanced down at his own lap (thankfully still covered by the blanket) and blushed again. Draco didn’t have to be a Legilimens to know what he was thinking. Trying to diffuse the awkward tension between them he quipped: “Actually… being cuddled by you was nicer than when Pansy did it. She’d always tickle me when I finally woke up, trying to get me to smile.”
“I'll think positive once we're safely back on the ground.” the blond grumbled. Harry grinned and said nothing.
“Well, Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted him on his side.” Harry remembered. “Maybe he wants him out of the way now.”
He hesitated, wondering how much he should tell her. Pansy was his best friend. They never had any secrets. And he didn’t want to start now. But it wasn’t exactly his secret to tell…
Averting his eyes again he started explaining: "He set me two tasks. I think he doesn't expect me to succeed. He wants to watch me fail. As punishment for my father."
“You can't tell me you never looked at a bloke and thought he's fit. Or that he has a nice smile or something like that.” Lavender had said. And he'd immediately thought of Draco. Of his smile, his effortless grace and enthusiasm.
Once again they struggled to their feet and looked around. The cellar they had just escaped from belonged to an old, rather decrepit looking house. All around they could only see grassy, sloping hills, with a few trees scattered here and there. There was no sign of another building.
But what exactly did that mean? They had become friends. Close friends. There was no doubt about that. But could it really be more than that? Could he really have fallen in love with the blond without even realizing it? Lavender had told him that she and Daphne had started out as friends, too. Daphne...
“Yeah. She ordered me to tell Harry to stop beating himself up over  it. She knows you too well, mate.”
In the end Harry turned to the only person he could think of asking. The only person who even believed him.
Then they had their first DADA lesson with Snape. Draco wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or annoyed at the fact that Snape still seemed to favour him. The Potions master was his godfather after all and even though he'd stopped acknowledging that fact once Draco had started at Hogwarts, he'd always been there for the blond when he'd needed it. On the other hand, Harry didn't trust Snape and Draco himself wasn't too sure which side the man was actually spying for now.
Immediately there were two or three house elves bustling around them, asking if they needed anything. Now that his stomach had settled, Harry felt that he could use something to eat. "Do you have any treacle tart left? And maybe some chocolate cake for him?"
“She did what? So that's why they attacked me... They kept saying stuff like that, but...” Draco trailed off when Madam Pomfrey returned, immediately rounding on Harry.
“For a lot of things.” Daphne said. She finally looked at him, her voice getting stronger. “For not sticking up for you at the beginning of term. For abandoning you. For listening to my parents and following their orders, like a good little pureblood princess!”
Draco finally came out of his trance. He moved a little to the side and stared speechlessly at his parents, facing off against each other. He had never seen his mother like this. She stood tall and proud, her face set in determination, her blonde hair falling around her like a halo. She looked like an avenging angel. Her voice was cold as ice.
Draco and Blaise had been tasked with getting food. They had been on their way back from the kitchens, after asking the elves to deliver all of Ron's favourite food, when they had run into a weeping Hermione. The sight alone had made Draco's blood run cold. Because Hermione was tough and it took a lot to make her tear up. It had gotten even worse when she had thrown herself into his arms and told them among sobs and hiccups that Ron had been poisoned.
Daphne smiled and bent down to kiss his cheek. When she straightened up again, Draco saw Harry standing in the doorway, staring at them. The Gryffindor looked pale. Draco hadn’t even heard him come in.
"Okay then. I'll ask her out to Hogsmeade next weekend." the red-head decided. "If that's okay with you, that is."
“Yeah. You’re all out doing something productive. I bet even Ron and Hermione are. And all I can do is sit here and wait until I finally turn seventeen.”
And just like that the fight drained out of Harry. He stared at Draco like he was seeing him for the first time. The Slytherin couldn't tell if he was angry or not. He was getting nervous and started babbling.
“Of course we believe you, Harry.” she assured. “And we're really sorry for the way we reacted yesterday. It was just … unexpected.”
Malfoy grinned. “No? That's a pity. You'll never find out what I'm doing then. And you won't be able to stop me. Can you really live with that? I could be up to something nefarious.”
During meals they sat at their respective house tables and while most of the Slytherins still acted like Draco didn't even exist, at least a few of the first years were starting to warm up to him. They sat closer to him now and had no problem making eye contact. Some of them even talked to him. They were too young to really know him, so he suspected that they felt since he was friends with the Saviour, he couldn't be that bad.
“Because of the sword. It was supposed to be locked in her vault at Gringotts. That’s why she tortured Hermione. To find out if we’d broken into her vault. And if we took anything else.”
“Just shut up and... get on with it.” the younger boy snapped. He felt wrong-footed and incredibly self-conscious. What the hell had he been thinking, agreeing to this?
Sirius, still laughing rather maniacally, led the way back to the hallway, where his Patronus chased away the next group of Dementors.
Deciding that Harry was right and that Ron really deserved some payback, Draco smirked at his boyfriend, before leaning in to press a chaste kiss to his lips. The red-head's exaggerated gagging noises made both of them laugh.
At first there had been quite a few comments directed his way and the whispering behind his back, already bad thanks to his new reputation as the Chosen One, had gotten louder and more frequent. By now it was old news and most of the speculation had died down somewhat, but whenever they were seen together it still caused a bit of a stir.
And then there was one of the things they had overheard in front of Dumbledore's office that day. Back then he hadn't given it much thought, too worried about his mother and too caught up in Sirius' tale. But later he'd remembered and now he just couldn't get the thought out of his head. So he decided to talk to Harry about it.
“You kept it?” Sirius asked in obvious surprise. Harry had finally told him all about what had happened in the cave a few weeks ago.
“What are you doing in here? Didn't you cause enough trouble out in the corridor? Come in here to continue? Or are you here to take a look at your handiwork?”
But what if the blond was doing something dangerous? Harry was sure that he was the one behind that necklace and Katie had almost gotten killed. What if it got worse next time? Wasn't it Harry's duty to stop him? No matter the cost? Especially since no-one wanted to believe him that the blond was up to something.
Draco was very quiet, despite the successful meeting. He had earlier overheard Luna chatting to Harry about last year's DA meetings and now couldn't get something the girl had said out of his head. It was stupid and yet...
The dark-haired boy smiled at the assurance and bid them goodnight. It still took him some time to fall asleep again. When he finally did, he dreamed of two naked bodies, entwined on white sheets, blond hair and pale skin in the moonlight. This time he woke with a raging hard-on and a strange sense of longing. Making sure that the silencing spell was still in place, he quickly took care of the problem, before getting up to join the others for breakfast.
“My brother was an important member of the wizengamot. People listened to him. He could’ve gotten you a trial. I’m pretty sure he could’ve gotten you out of Azkaban, if he’d tried. If he'd spoken up. But he never seemed interested in helping you, did he?”
Hey everyone, I'm back with the new chapter. Hope you'll like it. I'm also introducing two original characters this time, who might make a few more appearances in the future.
Harry wanted to protest. He wanted to continue. To try again right now. But he knew that Draco was right. He did feel exhausted. “Okay, tomorrow then.” he acquiesced.
Sirius clearly itched to do something. He kept telling them that the plan was good enough and urging them to just put it into action already. Harry unfortunately agreed with him. Thankfully Remus kept a level head and insisted that they needed more time to prepare. He was also doing a pretty good job of keeping his boyfriend in line. Draco only wished his methods wouldn’t involve things like blowjobs in the kitchen. It really wasn’t funny anymore how often he’d walked in on the two men. And while he wasn't as much of a prude as Ron, who turned the most interesting shades of red whenever he caught them in the act, Draco still had no desire to see that much of his cousin, thank you very much.
Luckily he didn't have to wait long until Malfoy returned. He looked at the armchair and frowned when he didn't see the tiny dog. Harry decided to run towards him and announce his presence with a bark. An action which he instantly regretted. He'd forgotten how stupid his dog-voice sounded. At least it had the desired effect and Malfoy looked down on him with a smile.
Of course he hadn't told Draco that. Somehow he felt that it was still too early for that kind of confession. But for once he was actually sure of his own feelings. This was love. And he was also pretty sure that his feelings were returned. The fact that Draco was so open with him now, that he was growing bolder, was proof of that.
“Let's just put that back where it belongs and then you can tell me all about the fight with Nott, okay?”
“Why does everyone think I should have known? It's not like you snog in the common room or anything.” he pointed out.
Draco and Sirius exchanged a surprised look. The blond wondered why someone would try to steal the sword of Gryffindor. There were only a handful of people who knew that it could destroy Horcruxes. And only one girl at Hogwarts who knew that Dumbledore had wanted Harry to have it.
Time seemed to accelerate after lunch and suddenly Harry found himself walking down to dinner, with no clear recollection of what he'd been doing all afternoon. He picked at his food while Ron rambled about Lavender and their plans for the evening. When the dinner plates vanished he looked over at the Slytherin table, just in time to see Malfoy get up. His eyes tracked the blond as he left the great hall without a backwards glance.
With a sigh he got out of bed, careful not to wake Draco. After putting on his glasses and slippers he padded over to the window and looked out into the night. His thoughts drifted to Luna, in the hands of the death eaters. He hoped she was faring okay. Knowing Luna she was probably driving them mad with her talk of Nargles. The thought brought a small smile to his face, but it fell quickly. What if they were hurting her? And how many more of his friends had been captured? Or worse.
So.... what do you think? Did the reunion go too smoothly? I think it did. Then again, they had to put aside their differences quickly, since Voldemort's on the move and all that...
The Slytherin had seldom been so glad when lessons were done for the day. They returned to their dorm to pack their books away and he pulled out ink and parchment to get started on some homework. But he hadn't gotten far when Harry stepped up behind him.
Seconds later a blanket was draped over his shoulders and he heard the blond muttering something about tea. He cuddled into the warmth, thankful for the comfort it provided and concentrated on keeping his breathing steady. By the time Andromeda pressed a steaming mug of tea into his hands the shivers had mostly subsided.
“Well, then I guess we can add another person to your friends-list. How many does that make it now? Four?” Draco quipped, laughing when Harry gaped at him.
“There! That must be it.” he whispered excitedly, climbing over a small mound of coins to reach it. The cup looked exactly like the one Harry had described to him. The one he'd seen in that memory of Voldemort. And it felt … weird. He couldn't really describe it, but he had no doubt that dark magic was involved. They had found what they'd come for.
“Good. The dark lord will not spare anyone. We’re on the brink of battle. The final battle, which will decide this war.”
Harry sighed. “He already knew all that.” he told them. “That book Remus mentioned ... Dumbledore has a copy in his office. It used to be in the restricted section, until he took it out and hid it. He reckons that Voldemort must have found it before he did.”
This appeased them a little, but Ron and Hermione both remained wary. Harry quickly told them about his earlier conversation with Sirius and finally confessed what Draco had been tasked to do.
“You sent the flowers?” He'd meant it as a statement, but it came out as a question instead. His voice barely more than a whisper.
“No, I can't. But your mum is smart. And brave. She wouldn't have done what she did if she thought it could get her into trouble.”
Hermione and Blaise had both started working for the Ministry of Magic right after graduation. Hermione was trying to reform the Magical Beasts department (and driving her co-workers insane, Harry suspected), while Blaise had a comfortable job at the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Ron and Neville had joined the Aurors, while Ginny and Millicent had found their calling in professional Quidditch. Ginny was currently a reserve chaser for the Holyhead Harpies. Millicent had just been promoted from reserve beater to the main team of the Appleby Arrows.
Remus hesitated only briefly. “Yes, I suppose we should. I mean, Dumbledore never questioned Snape’s loyalty. This would at least explain why.”
Draco felt Harry’s hand close around his, just as Kreacher grabbed his master. With a crack the room around them vanished. The last thing he saw was his mother’s face. There was a bloody gash on her forehead, but she was smiling.
It all sounded simple enough. And yet Draco couldn't shake the fear that something was bound to go horribly wrong.
"I'm not your bloody house-elf. You don't get to order me around." Ron shot back, losing the battle with his temper.
The blond swallowed hard and turned to leave, but Potter caught his arm and pulled him further into the shop instead, before rounding on the owner.
“I have. I wasn't sure at first, but talking about everything really helps. And I started a diary.” Harry hesitated slightly, before adding: “I'm also working on my control. Draco's a great help with that.” Then he waited for their reaction, concentrating on his breathing like the blond had shown him. Just in case they reacted badly.
Draco froze. He recognized Nott’s voice immediately. But how was that possible? Nott should have been evacuated with the other students. Why was he still at Hogwarts? And how had he managed to follow them in here?
"I'm sorry, okay? I didn't tell you, because I didn't want to bother you with my problems and make you my accomplice on top of that. And I only told Potter, because he'd already promised to help. I knew he'd expect something in return."
“There’s also the fact that my mother trusts Snape. And I trust my mother’s judgement.” Draco declared.
He started carding his fingers through the dark strands of Harry’s hair, surprised how silky it felt. Slowly the tension drained out of the other boy’s body and he relaxed, putting his weight more fully on Draco. The Slytherin didn’t mind. He continued to hold him and pet his hair until his breathing evened out and he fell asleep.
Then there was a loud bang and Alecto collapsed to the ground. Luna had stunned her. Draco quickly pulled her and Harry back under the cloak, since the noise had woken the sleeping Ravenclaws, who were coming down and crowding around Alecto.
“Through the tunnel, of course. It leads directly to the Hog's Head. We just apparated into the inn and then walked through the tunnel.” Luna explained calmly. “Though I think Aberforth wasn't too happy to see us.”
Well, now he knew. Oh, turning himself into an animal had worked splendidly. Turning back into a human – not so much. He had tried countless times. With no result. The thing Sirius had warned him about had happened. And because he hadn't listened, there was no-one here to turn him back with a spell. He was stuck.
Unfortunately Draco couldn't really share his positive way of thinking. Now that there was nothing distracting him any longer, the worry for his mother had returned. What if Bellatrix noticed her betrayal? What if his father found out? She was already in enough danger just staying at Malfoy Manor with her husband and a bunch of Death Eaters. But now that she had stolen the key from Bellatrix and by doing so helped the Order to steal from Voldemort himself, that danger had increased tenfold.
Still, it was getting tiresome and Harry was getting worried, so the blond decided to put an end to her childish games. Friday at dinner Pansy suddenly gasped and slid off her seat. When she tried to get up again, she found that her limbs wouldn't cooperate and started to panic.
Harry had thought it would take Kreacher only hours to find Mundungus, but he didn’t hear anything from the old elf for the rest of the day, nor on the next day. And that made him anxious. Once again he was forced to sit around and wait. He did his best not to take his frustration out on Draco this time, but it wasn't easy.
"And not even the worst of it. Because to create a Horcrux a wizard first has to deliberately commit murder. This act, said to be one of supreme evil, would result in the murderer metaphysically damaging their own soul. That damage would then be used by casting a spell, which would rip the damaged portion of the soul and encase it in an object."
His dare completed he finally returned to the eighth year dorm, where he was met with smattering applause and a few jeers. But something wasn’t right and it didn’t take him long to figure out what.
The man snorted. “Circumstance my ass. His bloody family has always been in league with dark wizards.” he claimed.
Harry sighed in resignation. They didn't talk as they left the room and headed down to the dungeons. The younger boy had no idea what to make of Draco's behaviour. One minute the blond was completely open with him, only to pull away and become distant in the next. It was confusing as hell and had him feeling off-balance.
Blaise on the other hand launched into another tirade about clingy girls and told Ron he was doing it all wrong. “You need to set boundaries. She's going to think she owns you, if you let her get away with it.”
Draco stared at her for a moment, taken aback by the sheer absurdity of the statement. But he couldn't help a grin from spreading across his lips.
Once the group was complete they hid in an abandoned theatre and waited for the first Ministry employees to show up. Only minutes later a small witch named Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office, rounded the corner. Sirius stunned her and dragged her into the empty theatre, taking off her ID and the tokens now needed to enter the Ministry and ripping out a few of her hairs, so Hermione could polyjuice into her.
Draco didn't seem to have an answer and Harry found himself speaking up without really meaning to: "Hogwarts."
"I didn't think… It's…" he stuttered, before shaking his head at himself. "Everyone just sees you as the brave hero. The Chosen One. I guess it's easy to forget that you're only human, too."
Draco took a seat at the end of the table, unsurprised that the other Slytherins kept their distance. He had known that this year was going to be a difficult one. His encounter with Blaise on the train had shown him just how difficult. But he was determined to make it through. He had no other choice, really, since it was part of his parole. But he would have come back anyway, he thought.
“I know it's stupid, okay? Story of my life. Every stupid thing I've ever done, I did just to make you notice me.” the blond claimed, blushing slightly.
Finally satisfied with his appearance, Draco grabbed his broom and followed Harry out of the changing room. Still laughing and joking with each other, they made their way up to the castle, completely oblivious to the ginger haired girl watching them from the shadows.
Draco shuddered. He knew that voice all too well. His first instinct was to turn around and run and it took all of his willpower not to give into that urge. He took a deep breath and forced himself to creep forward instead.
Hey everyone! I'm back with the next chapter. Sorry about the cliffhanger last time. I just couldn't resist. And a big thanks to everyone who took the time to leave a comment.
Harry soon lost track of time. He had no idea how much time had gone by since their escape from Malfoy Manor (for that was where he'd been imprisoned, of course), when they finally settled on a plan. The snow had melted, given way to fresh grass and spring seemed to be lurking just around the corner.
“Mr. Lovegood probably doesn’t even know what it is.” Draco chimed in. “He most likely thinks it means something different. They’re a bit strange, the Lovegoods.”
The way she put it, it sounded so easy. It was anything but easy. This bond had been forced onto them and he had no idea how Potter felt about the whole thing. What if he made a fool of himself? What if Potter told his little friends that Draco had hit on him? Weasley would never let him live it down. And Draco wouldn't be able to take that kind of humiliation.
Malfoy looked relieved. Probably not used to anyone getting his weird way of thinking, Harry suspected.
Harry hurried downstairs and breathed a small sigh of relief when he finally found the blond sitting at a small table with a large book and what looked like a mug of hot chocolate. The dark-haired boy took a seat across from him and asked one of the elves, who had started fawning over him as soon as he entered, to bring him some hot chocolate as well.
He quietly made his way to the front door and went out without hesitation. It was very dark outside and he had to take a moment to orientate himself. Once he was sure he was going in the right direction, he had to fight his way through patches of vines and overgrown bushes. He scratched his arm on a thorny bush and nearly fell twice when his foot snagged on a root. And he could see nothing but bushes, weeds and what looked like it might once have been a sun-chair. Cursing silently he was just about to turn around and head back inside when he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. There it was – the strange glint that had drawn him out here.
He hadn't eaten anything since breakfast, too busy with the preparations for his first transformation. Now it was way past dinner-time. Once again he tried to shut off his racing thoughts. Tried to stay calm and find his centre as Sirius had explained, so he could change back. But it was no use. It just didn't work.
Crabbe and Goyle still couldn't look him in the eyes, but had started staring at him when they thought he didn't notice. Pansy Parkinson on the other hand tried to harass Draco whenever she could, but so far all her attempts had failed miserably.
How could he have been so stupid? It all made sense. Draco suddenly being nice and even acting civil towards Ron. All those little touches and shy smiles. Only to lure Harry into thinking he'd actually have a chance and laugh in his face later.
Harry watched him as he left the room. Then he leaned back in the armchair and thought back to their talk. It had been their first, real conversation as far as he could remember and he was surprised how well they'd gotten along. Maybe they could really leave the past behind and move on.
“Good. Well, I'd love to hear all the gory details about your duel with Nott, but Mione promised to help me with my Potions homework.”
Harry lay awake the night before, thinking of all the things that could go wrong. Before he'd broken into the Minstry with Ron and Hermione he'd felt determined and almost excited. This time there was only anxiety and nagging doubts.
Harry went to stand beside Sirius. “He’s right. You-know-who is on his way here. We know a way to defeat him, once and for all. But in order to do that, we need to find something. Something that’s hidden here at Hogwarts. It probably belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone ever seen something with her eagle on it, maybe? Or do you know of anything that used to belong to her?”
The dark-haired boy agreed reluctantly. They packed their things and left the library, heading for the stairs.
Harry hesitated. He knew that Draco wouldn't want anyone to know about his break-down. And he didn't want to betray his trust. Especially now, when they were slowly starting to make some progress.
Harry hesitated. “Because I feel like I'm intruding on their happiness.” he finally confessed. “Sometimes I get the feeling that wherever I look lately, all I see are happy couples. It makes me feel...”
Yes, he had. But Harry was fairly sure that it wouldn't have worked. Even back then, Draco couldn't have hated him that much. An what he'd done was worse. He had scarred Draco for life. The blond would always be reminded of that day, whenever he looked into a mirror without his shirt on.
Draco barely slept that night. And not only because of Harry's nightmares, which seemed to be especially bad. The Gryffindor refused to talk about them, but Draco could already guess what they were about. So he sat with Harry and murmured soothing nonsense until the younger boy fell asleep again. And all the while he kept wondering if his brilliant idea had really been so brilliant after all.
There was a flurry of movement. The Gryffindors stood to join Draco and shield Harry. Then the Ravenclaws followed. And the Hufflepuffs. And after that even some Slytherins. Harry felt a rush of gratitude.
Harry didn't really know what to do now. Well, he knew what he wanted to do. Curl up against Draco and cuddle for a while, preferably until they both fell asleep. But they couldn't spend the night here. They both had to get back to their respective dorm rooms. And he had no idea if Draco even wanted to cuddle with him.
Okay, so I write a short chapter that ends with a cliffhanger and I get six (or was it seven?) reviews. And then I write a long chapter with no cliffhanger and I only get one. You do know what you're telling me with that, right?
"And you're supposed to be dying of Spattergroit!" she reminded. "If anyone should stay back it's Harry."
Hermione got to her feet. “That’s my clue. I asked Ginny to give me a warning when your mum comes up. See you tomorrow.” She slipped out of the door and tip-toed downstairs.
“I know I'm the prettiest thing in this house, but surely you didn't come here just to stare at me.” Draco drawled, obviously annoyed by Harry's continued silence.
"Yeah, we already knew that. Okay, let's head down to the courtrooms. She's most likely wearing it."
Draco saw Remus shaking his head in dismay, but had no chance to worry about that now. They needed to get out of here. The spectacle Sirius was making was sure to draw attention very quickly. And if they were caught... he didn't even want to imagine it. Harry, ever the stupid Gryffindor, quickly followed his godfather's lead. He conjured his own Patronus and yelled.
Instead of heeding the quiet command, Harry slowly moved closer. He couldn't tell why, but for some reason he was sure that the blond wouldn't attack him.
The Gryffindor was starting to wonder if he'd somehow given himself away. If maybe Malfoy knew that he was there, waiting for him. The blond knew about his cloak, after all. But even if he realized that Harry was there, he couldn't know where exactly. So Harry decided that he just had to wait. Sooner or later Malfoy would slip. He would let his guard down long enough for the Gryffindor to make a move. It was only a matter of time.
"What would you know about hairstyling, with that rats nest on your head?" Draco joked with a smirk.
“I bet you sleep naked, right? You like to feel those expensive sheets against your skin. Like a caress…” the younger wizard went on undaunted.
“I know. Believe me, Harry. If there’s anyone who knows what it feels like, it’s me. I’ve been there. I know how frustrated you are. But it can’t be helped. Right now you’ve still got the trace. With the way old Voldy and his cronies have been undermining the Ministry it would only be a matter of hours until they catch you. And we can’t let that happen.”
The words made the blond smile. Mostly because they were true and he was quite proud of his boyfriend for figuring that out. But even that couldn't stop him from worrying.
Finally Harry got up as well, mumbled an excuse to Ron and made his way to Gryffindor tower like a sleepwalker. He grabbed his invisibility cloak, hesitated a moment and then spelled the curtains of his four-poster shut. His room-mates wouldn't come back any time soon. Maybe they'd think he'd already gone to bed when they returned. Taking a deep breath he headed to the seventh floor.
"Yeah. Feels both shorter and longer somehow." Draco mused, cursing himself for how stupid that sounded. He was starting to pick up Harry's annoying habit of saying whatever came to mind, without properly thinking about it first.
It was clear to see that Malfoy didn't believe that, but instead of voicing his doubts he sat down in his desk chair so he was facing the younger boy.
Draco flinched, but forced himself to meet his father’s eyes defiantly. “And I hope you’ll get what you deserve!” he spat.
“It's a long story.” Harry said with a sigh and then motioned for her and Ron to follow him to the room he shared with the red-head, already fed up with the curious stares of their classmates.
Harry and Draco's first date turned out really nice. They bought some sweets from Honeydukes, browsed through Tomes and Scrolls and then went to the Three Broomsticks for a butterbeer, after making a quick stop at Scrivenshaft's to get Draco a new quill. They talked and bickered and had a lot of fun.
It felt nice, being able to talk about anything and share his life with someone like that, even if it was also a bit scary sometimes. They were only sixteen, after all and yet this already felt like forever. Pansy had started calling him love-struck and Draco couldn't help but wonder if he was. In love. With Harry Potter.
She sounded sincere and he had to admit that he missed having a female friend he could talk to. Luna was great, but so different from Pansy. Daphne was a lot more like her. As long as she didn’t start meddling too much he wouldn’t mind spending more time with her.
But Harry never heard what Xeno Lovegood was in Hermione's opinion. Because suddenly pain flared in his head, worse than ever before and he found himself standing in a dimly lit room, with a shaking goblin kneeling at his feet.
Harry just nodded, still not quite able to process it all. He kept hoping to wake up and find that it had really just been a nightmare. It would probably take a few more days for him to come to terms with everything.
"Does it have something to do with the fact that we found a bunch of clothes and your glasses out in the garden?" Remus chimed in again.
When they reached the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors, he got another surprise. The goblins at the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, clutching long, thin golden rods.
They put on warm coats, gloves and hats, grabbed their brooms and made their way down to the pitch. Harry grinned at him and took off. After casting an additional warming charm, Draco followed him. For a while they just raced around the pitch and the surrounding area, chasing each other. Up and down, left then right, daring each other to fly higher, lower, faster. The blond laughed in pure delight. He loved Quidditch, but this was even better. Just the exhilaration of flight, without direct competition for once.
Both boys turned in surprise, to find the goblin watching them. He looked fully alert and pretty pissed. The Imperius curse must have worn off as well.
Harry's heart sped up at hearing those words. "Do you actually mean that? Because I never know where I stand with you. You get close only to pull away again. It's confusing the hell out of me."
Suddenly he remembered the strange feeling in his chest the first time he'd seen her with Draco in their room. The feeling that had only intensified when she had kissed the blond's cheek. The same feeling he used to get whenever Draco mentioned Pansy. At least until he'd learned that she was dating that French bloke. And suddenly he recognized that feeling for what it was. Jealousy. Oh fuck!
Harry hated all those houses, but had to agree with Draco that they were their best chance of hiding from the Death Eaters. No-one ever dared to approach a house that had been raided. Not even Voldemort's followers themselves. And having a roof over their heads was a lot better than camping in the woods, like he'd done with Ron and Hermione, now that the weather had turned cold and snow covered the grounds.
Sorry for the cliffhanger last time. I just couldn't resist. But since I'm only a bit evil, I'm already posting the next chapter. Which is also the last chapter. Wow. Only the epilogue left now. And I'm really curious how you like my version of events...
“Of course it is. It was my idea after all.” Draco bragged and Harry laughed, feeling lighter already.
“I'm impressed as well.” Harry assured and Draco's blush darkened. They stared at each other, smiling slightly.
“Well, once the locket was destroyed, we thought that our best bet of finding you would be to continue the search for Horcruxes.” Ron answered. “Hermione had found a weird symbol in the book from Dumbledore and I remembered that I'd seen it before. Once on a grave in Godric's Hollow and also at Bill's wedding. Xeno Lovegood had worn it as a pendant.”
At two minutes past four his floo chimed and Harry whirled to face the fireplace, his heart hammering like he'd run a marathon. And then a slender, blond boy stepped out of the green flames and looked at him cautiously. Harry felt relief flooding his body and grinned.
When they finally reached the seventh floor, Harry was nowhere to be seen. But Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna were waiting by the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and his trolls.
"Yeah. Whenever you're ready, I guess." Harry added. It was probably a good thing if he had less time to fret about it.
They were called eighth years and thanks to the fact that they were all technically adults, they had certain privileges. Like rooming apart from the rest of the houses. They had been given their own common room, which was nice, since it meant less people who would stare at Harry.
Upon finding his sister stunned, Amycus yelled in fear and started flinging insults at McGonagall. When he spat at her, Harry couldn't take it any longer. He burst out from beneath the cloak, raised his wand and used the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus, who was raised into the air and smashed into a bookcase.
He watched the sorting with no real interest. The kids who got sorted into Slytherin looked unsure and wary as they made their way to the table amidst muted clapping. Taking their cue from the older students they too kept their distance from Draco. They were ducking their heads, as if to hide. His house had lost its pride, the blond realized. And it was at least partly his fault.
With a scream of pure rage Ron swung the sword. Again there was a sound like a scream, a big bang and the smoke figure vanished. The locket had been shattered to pieces. Ron stood there, panting and trembling. The sword fell out of his hands and clattered to the ground. Suddenly Hermione let out a choked sob and threw herself into his arms.
Harry finally steered them into a compartment that was empty save for two very familiar people. Neville Longbottom smiled upon seeing Harry, but when he spied Draco he gave a startled yelp and toppled out of his seat. Draco tried to turn his snicker into a cough, but he was pretty sure that Harry wasn't fooled. Luna Lovegood only looked up from her magazine with a dreamy smile. She was wearing psychedelic looking spectacles, which gave her the look of a demented owl.
But before the panic could overwhelm him, there was suddenly another presence. It brushed along his mind, soft like the wings of a butterfly. It felt warm and … safe. Harry tried to reach for that presence and felt it surround him, chasing away the cold. His fear lessened. He started to relax again, happy to sink into the darkness, now that he was no longer alone.
Tonks cackled maniacally and Remus felt goosebumps rising on his skin. If he didn't know better he'd really believe it was Bellatrix Lestrange standing there.
"He doesn't have fleas." the blond protested, patting Harry's head. Harry was too busy scowling at Zabini to really notice.
Then one day Harry got dragged to Neville's room, only to find Dean and Seamus waiting there for them. Neville proceeded to lock the door and scold all three of them for behaving like a bunch of idiots and could they please get their heads out of their arses and make up already, because they were driving him insane.
“Now go deeper. Try to feel your magic. It’s in your blood. It flows through your veins. Can you feel it?”
Harry actually found himself smiling. "Guess it's a good thing I've got a sneaky Slytherin on my side now, huh?"
The next day found Harry stumbling through a park he didn't recognize. He was still a tiny dog. He was hungry and tired, having spent most of the previous night and this morning walking around aimlessly. He'd managed to doze a little, but had been too scared to even attempt sleeping. And he'd cut his left front-paw on a shard of glass earlier, when he'd been running away from a viscous, huge dog.
Harry stared at the hairband again, only now fully realizing that this was the horcrux that had been inside him before. Suddenly it didn’t seem so funny anymore. He looked around at the others. Most of them were looking at him expectantly. Only Draco was staring at the hairband with a strange expression.
“I also talked to him about continuing the DA.” Harry changed the subject. “At first he wasn't too thrilled at the idea. He thought it would put too much pressure on me.”
"Yes, he will. Madam Pomfrey said there will be no side effects." the Gryffindor girl assured. She looked visibly relieved.
For a second the younger boy just stared at him. Then he heaved a huge sigh and closed the distance between them in two quick strides. Draco somehow expected him to smash their lips together in a rush. Instead Harry gently cupped his cheek, leaned in slowly and brushed his lips against the blond's. It was just a feather light touch at first, as if he was afraid of rejection. When Draco made no move to pull away he increased the pressure.
Her warning delivered she went to fetch Hermione, Pansy, Ron, Crabbe and Goyle, who crowded around the beds with varying expressions of relief.
Harry really hoped that Draco was finally done fighting him. He remembered holding Draco and offering comfort. Remembered how the blond had clung to him and how he'd thought that the Slytherin looked beautiful, even when he was crying. And he had to admit that Sirius was right. He did have a crush on Draco. Maybe it was even more than that.
The blond snorted. “You'll forgive me for finding that hard to believe. Since it looks like you've been lying in wait here.”
Hermione smiled at the praise. Despite the fact that she’d been called the brightest witch of her age many times now, McGonagall’s words still meant a lot to her.
The rest of his words was drowned out by a crack and Sirius and Remus appeared just at the edge of the protective wards.
Draco took a deep breath and set off towards Gringotts. Harry quickly followed him. They hadn't made it more than a few steps though, when they heard someone calling Lucius' name. A tall, thin wizard with grey hair and a long nose came striding towards them.
“The dark lord is furious. Bellatrix admitted that her vault might have been invaded. He killed a couple of goblins, tortured Greyback and your father… I have never seen him in such a rage. He ordered all of his followers to ready themselves for a fight and wait for his command. He has now gone to check something. I could hear him muttering about needing to make sure the others were still safe. I do not know what he meant. But I know that he will check Hogwarts last. He warned Severus that you might try to infiltrate the castle.”
The excited muttering of the other patrons made him look towards the door. Just in time to see Harry Potter stalking towards him. The younger man looked ridiculously out of place in his faded jeans and old trainers. But there was an intensity in his gaze that drew Draco in.
“It was a nice gesture.” Remus said, making both boys look at him. “And I’m sure Kreacher appreciates it. But we still need to find the real Horcrux. And I guess that means we have to track down Mundungus. Which will be no easy feat. He knows how to hide.”
“I, Harry James Potter, commit myself to you, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, to learn and grow with, to explore and adventure with, to respect you in everything as an equal partner, in the foreknowledge of joy and pain, strength and weariness, direction and doubt, for all the risings and settings of the sun.”
Suddenly her voice was drowned out by the strange ringing in his ears. Her mouth snapped shut and she stared at him in shock. Only then did Harry realize that it was happening again. His magic was rising around him in waves, ready to lash out. He fought for control, tried to push it back down, but his powers wouldn't respond. His breath was coming in short, painful gasps. Panic was overwhelming him as he realized that he would hurt Ron and Hermione if he didn't get away from them right now.
The use of his given name finally did the trick. His eyes snapped open and he jerked upright, panting like he'd run a marathon. His eyes darted around in fright.
Hermione was the first to comply. The three boys followed her lead. The figures came closer. Draco saw someone snatching up their wands, while another guy pointed a lit wand at them. He heard Hermione stammering out a fake name and couldn’t hold back a gasp when he got a good look at Harry’s face. It was shiny-pink, puffy and so swollen that his features looked completely distorted. He remembered Hermione’s shout earlier and realized that she hadn’t been trying to defend them. She had hit Harry with a stinging hex, so he wouldn’t be as easily recognizable. He admired her quick thinking. Hopefully it would buy them enough time to get out of this.
Draco grinned at the empty threat, but decided to change the subject nonetheless. As much fun as it still was to rile Harry up, he wanted to talk about something important here and it wouldn't do to start an argument. Not right now.
“What offer?” Hermione wanted to know. She felt completely out of the loop. And she didn’t like that feeling at all.
Draco only looked up when he heard someone shouting. Neville, who obviously hadn’t realized that the person in Hagrid’s arms was not the real Harry, had tried to charge at Voldemort. Of course Millicent wasn’t far behind. And of course they had both been disarmed long before reaching their goal. While one of the death eaters held Millie back, Voldemort summoned the Sorting Hat, of all stupid things and forced it on Neville’s head.
“I found out that there was a student newspaper for a couple of years. The Hogwarts Howler. I contacted one of the students who ran it and she had actually kept a few issues. She sent me copies of what she could find on Sirius and your parents.” Draco explained. “The family and children pictures are from the Black family archives and most of the other ones are from Andromeda.”
The fact that they now knew who had the locket was only a tiny progress. The stint at Hogwarts had done nothing to hurt Umbridge’s career. Quite the contrary. She had actually risen in favour it seemed. And as a high ranking Ministry official she was way out of their reach. They had no idea where she lived and also no way to find out. Which left them with only one option. They had to catch her at work. And that meant entering the Ministry itself.
Okay, put like that it sounded logical enough. Harry could most likely see his defences beginning to crack, because he went in for the kill: “We would be able to spend more time together. Planning the meetings and stuff. Just the two of us.”
Of course Hermione voiced her doubts. As did Remus. But Harry and Sirius wouldn’t be deterred. In Draco’s opinion there were still way too many things that could go wrong. Way too much that relied on chance. But he was slowly learning to pick his battles, so he kept quiet. And unfortunately he had to agree that there were things they wouldn't be able to plan for, no matter how long they'd wait. After a lengthy discussion Sirius and Harry finally got their way. Everyone agreed to infiltrate the Ministry the next day.
It hurt, despite the preparation. Harry hissed, but forced himself to hold still and allow the intrusion. Draco only stopped once he was fully sheathed, giving them both time to get used to the feeling. The pain slowly ebbed away, replaced by a strange feeling of being full. The blond pulled out a little, before thrusting back in experimentally.
Sorry to have kept you guys waiting again. But I was faster than last time. So that's progress I guess. I hope you like the new chapter. There's at least a bit more action and I tried not to copy too much from the book.
“Man, I'm starving. Where's the lunch trolley? And where's Harry?” the red-head asked and Draco shook his head with a smile. Ron would forget anything for food.
Harry was fidgeting now, clearly nervous. Draco couldn't do more than stare at him, which only seemed to make his anxiety worse.
Snape swept out of the room without sparing them another glance. McGonagall gave Harry a tight smile and followed the potions master, leaving the two boys alone.
Great. So pretty much anyone in his house had known that he was bent. And Pansy had scared them all into keeping their mouths shut. That definitely sounded like his best friend and he felt a wave of gratitude towards her. Wizarding society didn’t really mind same-sex relationships. Even purebloods believed in the age-old practice of turning a blind eye. But it was a different matter if you were the only heir of an old pureblood family. And quite another matter for a female member of the sacred 28.
“The Ministry took Malfoy Manor for war reparations. Andromeda has been kind enough to let mother and me move in here.”
“I wasn't!” Harry insisted fiercely, before pausing to give him a speculative look. Draco didn't like that look at all. It was way too Slytherin.
He nodded without taking his eyes off the letter. It was the one Hermione had given to Andromeda, so she could pass it on to him. He'd carried it around ever since, but always put off reading it, a little afraid of what she'd written.
Draco frowned, wondering who would send him flowers. On Valentine's Day no less. He was a little  scared that it might be meant as a joke.
“I don't have time for this nonsense! Come on, Millicent!” he ordered, before addressing the little girl again: “And if you ever want help with your homework again, you'll better keep your mouth shut.”
As it turned out, caution wasn't necessary, as luck was once again on their side. The dragon chose exactly that moment to break through the floor of the main hall. Wizards, witches and goblins alike screamed and ran for cover. No-one noticed the three of them dashing through the chaos and out through the front gate.
He got into a carriage with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna and Neville, forcing himself to appear more calm and confident than he felt. Now that they were almost there he was getting nervous. But he simply smiled at Harry when they reached the Great Hall, finally parting ways. Draco headed for the Slytherin table, while Luna joined her fellow Ravenclaws and the others headed towards the Gryffindor side. And still people were openly staring and the whispers only got louder.
“Of course not.” Draco huffed. “Stir clockwise, not counter-clockwise. When we were listening in front of Dumbledore's office the other day, Sirius and Remus talked about a prophecy, remember?”
"Well, Weasley is his best friend. Merlin knows why. But I'd say the fact that he made you study with his best friend shows that he's starting to trust you. It's a little like meeting the family, isn't it?" she mused.
“Yeah, I thought that, too. Guess we were both wrong.” Draco said bitterly, turning around and continuing down the hallway.
Because you're not the git I thought you were. Because you're actually quite sweet and very nice to look at and I'd really love to get to know you better.
Giddy relief spread through Draco. "No. I mean, yes. I mean I … I'd like that. And I don't have plans yet."
“Yeah, it is.” the red-head agreed. “I can't believe that...” he shook his head. “...that all of it really happened. But I guess it's like that for everyone. Lessons have been cancelled for today. The common room is packed and there are a lot of rumours going around. Seamus claims they're going to close the school.”
“Yeah, maybe.” the younger boy agreed, remembering his talk with Sirius and Remus. He wasn't sure how he felt about that prospect, though.
“I guess we should head back. We need to get up early tomorrow.” Harry agreed, getting up reluctantly.
Remus tried unsuccessfully to stifle a smile. “Well, this was a very eventful night. I suggest we go back to bed and try to get some more sleep. What do you say?”
The blond cast a quick look around, obviously checking that they were alone. Then he whispered: “Like this.” and leaned over to kiss Harry.
Millie grinned mischievously, but before she could reply their attention was drawn back to the pitch, where Harry was loudly threatening to curse the rejected beaters. “I really don't envy him.” the girl repeated. “Is Weasley really trying out as keeper again?” she asked then.
With no classes to attend and no homework to do, he spent his days surrounded by his friends. The weather was so beautiful, it felt almost like it was mocking them. It could have been a great time, if not for the dark shadow hanging over them. Sometimes he still felt like it had all been a bad dream. Like Dumbledore had to be sitting at the teacher's table, alive and well. Other times the reality was all too clear and he found himself mourning the old headmaster, despite the doubts he'd had about him.
In Draco's opinion, Luna's commentary was pretty much the only good thing about the match. She seemed completely uninterested in what was going on on the pitch and instead pointed out interestingly shaped clouds to the crowd. McGonagall was fast losing patience with her, barking the current score into her megaphone every now and then with a dark look, to the amusement of the crowd.
He couldn’t move. He tried to shift his weight, but his limbs wouldn’t cooperate. He tried opening his eyes, but that didn’t work either. With a start he realized that he couldn’t even feel his body anymore. He started to panic. It felt like he was floating alone in the darkness, leaving himself behind. And he was scared, so scared.
“It's not wasting time when we take five minutes to ensure we don't get caught right upon setting foot into Hogsmeade!”
Harry couldn't really pin-point the first time it happened. Nightmares were a regular occurrence after the war and he was used to his magic lashing out while he was asleep, so he didn't think anything by it when he woke up to find his bedroom in disarray. Merely shrugged it off and took some precautions for the next time. He also didn't really notice any other incidents, though in hindsight he was sure that there must have been quite a few. Maybe he had deliberately overlooked them.
“Stop being so damn pessimistic. Harry will be perfectly safe with us. And it shouldn’t even take long.”
His eyes roamed over the headstone again. He suddenly felt sad that Harry had never really gotten to know his parents. That he had never gotten to know Harry's parents. He wondered what kind of people they might have been. Brave like their son, there was no doubt about that. And Lily Potter must have been very smart. Brilliant at potions. He'd heard Slughorn gushing about her often enough.
He could see that Harry didn’t want to let him go off on his own. Hell, he didn’t want to let Harry out of his sight either. But they had to think rationally. It made much more sense to split up.
“Yeah, I’m fine.” he lied, sitting up and forcing a smile onto his face. He didn’t want to talk about what had happened. Didn’t want anyone to know what he’d seen. And Draco already looked worried and tired enough. “How long was I out?”
So Draco tried again, with the same result. This was getting very frustrating. He already regretted asking Harry for help.
“Alright.” Remus gave in, reaching up to slip the chain around his neck. Harry hadn’t even known that the others had started wearing the horcrux again. He saw Remus pluck a faded pink hairband from around the locket and couldn’t help but grin. Knowing that a piece of Voldemort’s soul was caught inside an old hairband was sort of funny. He imagined Voldemort’s face if he ever found out and had to supress a chuckle. Remus put the hairband on the coffee table and kept the locket in his hand for now.
There was only one more horcrux to find and destroy. Then only the snake would be left. And Voldemort himself. For the first time in months things were starting to look up. Instead of moping around, like they had done during the past couple of days, they all felt the need to do something today. Remus and Hermione ended up in the library again, doing research on Rowena Ravenclaw, in the hope of finding out what exactly Voldemort might have used as the last horcrux. The other four discussed possible hiding places.
Andromeda apologised profusely and asked if he would be kind enough to share his room with Harry. They could put a camp bed in, which would undoubtedly make things a bit cramped, but was still the best possible option. She didn’t want the poor boy to sleep on the couch or, even worse, spend Christmas all alone in that dreadful old house he’d inherited from his godfather.
When he got home he found his mother and aunt sitting in the living room, listening to the wireless. His mother asked about Pansy, so he told her a little about his visit, before bidding both women goodnight. Harry was lying on the camp bed, reading a Quidditch magazine when Draco entered his bedroom.
"Would it be stupid if I said I'm happy about the bond?" he whispered. "I mean… I know it was forced upon us. We had no choice. And we have no idea who did that or why. But… I guess I'm just happy with the way things turned out and I don't know if we'd ever gotten to know each other like this if it wouldn't have been for this bond."
“No, really. I saw something glinting when I looked out the window. So I went down and there it was.”
“Don't look at me like that! I didn't do that. One moment I'm walking back from Hogsmeade, minding my own business and the next I get attacked from behind. And then I wake up here, chained to you.”
Draco opened the door and stepped inside. The younger boy followed with some trepidation. A part of him was suddenly scared of finding out. Once inside the room he stopped dead in his tracks and stared in awe. He'd never seen this version of the room of requirement before. It was huge and filled  to the ceiling with mountains of junk. Harry saw teetering piles of broken and damaged furniture, thousands of books, bottles, hats, jewels, cloaks, several rusty swords and even a heavy, blood-stained axe.
“Yeah. I didn’t want to say anything in front of Draco, because he agrees with Hermione. But I couldn’t really get it out of my head.”
So he spent a nice afternoon with Malfoy, running around the garden, tumbling through the grass or just sitting in the shade of a tree. He'd never seen the blond so carefree and happy. He'd also never expected that Malfoy was the type who would play silly games with a dog.
“I know that. But the potion won't help you in the long run. It's not fixing anything. It just represses the nightmares. You'll have to face your demons sooner or later.”
“It’s gone.” Sirius assured. “Well, not gone exactly. We’ve still got no means to destroy the bloody thing. But it’s out of Harry, at least. Remus put it into one of Hermione’s old hairbands. Ridiculous, don’t you think? He said he wanted something mundane, to spite old snakeface. I tried setting it on fire or cutting it to pieces, but it didn’t work. So we wrapped it around the locket for the time being. Best to keep those things together.”
As the guests started leaving, he found himself standing at the side with Draco, Ron and Hermione. Soon the Hogwarts Express would take them home. And Harry knew that for him it would be the last time. He would not return. He'd made a decision. No-one else was going to die trying to protect him.
Harry stared at the dark, damp wall in front of him. He had no idea how long he'd been staring at it already. How long he'd been here. It was always dark down here, wherever here actually was.
The quiet command made nervous anticipation flutter in his stomach. Harry complied wordlessly, kicking off his old trainers and scooting up, until he was lying with his head on the pillow. Malfoy pulled off his own shoes, before crawling in next to him. And then they were kissing again, hot and open-mouthed and Harry was shocked to realize that his jeans were getting too tight.
Suddenly the hand around his cock tightened almost painfully, he heard Draco gasp and felt his cock jerking against his back. Harry braced his hands against the tiles as his own orgasm ripped through him, leaving him feeling weak in the knees.
The blond thanked him quietly, but then reminded him that he had to practice harder, since they were trying to stop those visions. Harry was getting tired of the reminder. Tired of the lessons themselves. Of Draco invading his mind and seeing flashes of his childhood.
“You forced us to leave our home. Our friends. We were proud of you, but you … you used your powers against us.”
The four Ravenclaws took a table together and Blaise automatically headed for the table that Nott and Pansy had already claimed as theirs. Draco shot him an apologetic look, before joining Harry, Ron and Hermione. This got him a few incredulous stares and a dark look from the lone Hufflepuff boy, who was now forced to join the other three Slytherins.
Sorry, but I just couldn't make it that easy on them. But things will get better soon, I promise. The story is getting close to being finished. There will be only about two or three more chapters, I think.
“Not at all. How can you even think that, Harry? My offer was genuine and if you had wanted me to do it, I would have. But as I understood it the memory part goes both ways and I wouldn’t want to burden you with my dark past. I can also understand that there are things in your past you wouldn’t want me to know. We all have our personal demons and sharing those is hard. Even with the people we trust.”
“I will not tolerate prejudice of any kind.” she warned. “If you attack another student – be it with words or actions – there will be consequences.”
He shrugged. “We'll ask the room to turn into whatever Nott asks for.” he said, like it was obvious.
Harry nodded dumbly and allowed the other boy to help him to his feet, ignoring his protesting muscles.
The discussion obviously over, Draco went back to his book. Harry watched him for a moment, though he couldn’t tell why. He just liked watching the blond read for some reason. He always seemed so engrossed in his books. Finally he shook his head and focused his gaze back on his Charms homework. It was due tomorrow and he wasn’t even halfway finished.
He only wished he knew who had sent them those books. He thought he would like to thank them. Even if this bond had turned his life upside down. At least it had done so in a good way. And it had only been three month so far. Three month to the day since the bond had been formed.
“No! Don’t try to make excuses for him!” Harry yelled. “Don’t you dare! I’m sick and tired of people telling me to just believe in Dumbledore. Believe in his grand plans. His fucking plan is for me to get killed! I trusted him! I thought he actually cared about me. But all this time I was … I was just…”
Of course Hermione didn't let him get away with that. "Is it the bond? Are there any new side effects? Did you see Madam Pomfrey?"
“Alright, I guess it's better if you come with us. But if it comes to a fight I want you to run away and lock yourselves in a room. Understood?” The werewolf looked at them intently. Draco nodded. There was no way he was going to duel a bunch of Death Eaters. He wasn't suicidal.
The dark-haired boy took another step back, feeling overwhelmed. He was happy to see them. He really was. They were his best friends and he had missed them. But they had deserted him when he would have needed them most and their betrayal still stung. He didn't even know what he was feeling right now.
"Sure you're not." Remus said, patting Sirius’ knee, before turning back to the younger man. "So what happened, Harry?"
Well, he had gone to bed, but sleep had eluded him. Dean's words about phone sex had echoed in his head and so, following a strange impulse, he'd grabbed his cell-phone. And before he’d been able to talk himself out of it, he had dialled Draco’s number. Never in a million years had he thought the blond would actually go for it.
“Makes sense.” Harry had to agree. “I guess that means we're going to see each other more often from now on, huh?”
So the trio hurried along the street and rounded the corner. They stopped beside a shop window a good distance away from Gringotts.
The only question was where to go from there. Harry was the Gryffindor. The reckless, brave one. Draco was a calculating Slytherin. And there were still so many variables. So many things he might have misunderstood. Could he really risk it?
He had no idea why he told Malfoy of all people. Then again, the Slytherin wasn't the same git he used to be any longer. The war had changed all of them. And he had just admitted something very personal as well.
Draco wrote back immediately, assuring her that he didn’t mind sharing his room with Harry, since he was used to it by now. And he meant it. Even if it would have been nice to have a room to himself again. He couldn’t escape thoughts of Harry anyway. So it wouldn’t make much of a difference.
Harry had heard enough. “Shut up, Ron! You don't get to come here and start sprouting accusations. Draco helped me. He risked his life for me, while you were sitting safely at home. He was there for me, after you had left. You just left. I could have been dead for all you knew!”
Later that day Remus managed to tune into a programme called “Potterwatch” on the wireless. It was hosted by the Weasley twins and their friend Lee Jordan. They used code-names and you needed a changing password to tune in. Today they were also joined by Kingsley Shacklebolt, who gave a short report about the latest death eater attacks and assured people that Harry was not simply in hiding, but working to bring down you-know-who. Hearing the twins joking around and Kingsley proclaiming his faith in them put the group into an even better mood.
Harry just nodded, a little comforted by the fact that his godfather would be close by. He made his way through the portrait hole, ignoring the weepy fat Lady, who swung open without even asking for a password. The common room was surprisingly empty, but when he entered his dorm he nearly ran into Seamus, who had obviously been pacing by the door.
Draco (for he would always be Draco now and no longer Malfoy, at least in Harry's head) was sitting up as well. He looked sleepy and rumpled and Harry felt that strange fluttering in his stomach again. For a moment they just stared at each other, obviously both a little uncertain. Then Draco turned away and grabbed his wand to cast a tempus.
“I know it’s strange. That he trusted me with this, considering our past. But … it’s like something happened in that moment, when I helped him. Something changed between us.”
“Scare me? I nearly hexed you on sight. Not a good time to go around apparating into people’s homes without warning!”
With Lavender out of the picture, Hermione and Ron made up in no time, settling back into their usual friendship. Though Harry couldn't help but notice the lingering tension and awkward moments between them. Sometimes one of them would say something, pay the other a compliment or something like that and they'd both blush and very pointedly not look at each other. Or their hands would touch accidentally and they'd get all nervous and awkward. It was starting to grate on Harry's nerves.
“Oh, sure. In that case we should give you some privacy, huh? Come on, Draco. Daphne and Luna are saving us seats. We'll be in the second to last carriage, Harry. Come join us when you're done here.”
They all echoed Remus’ words, before disapparating in pairs. Harry looked around as soon as he landed. Draco’s aim had been perfect. They were standing in the backyard he remembered from his vision, right next to the old gardener’s hut. Hermione and Ron joined them seconds later. It was early afternoon, but the sun was already low in the sky. Harry shivered in the cold February air as he took in his surroundings.
“Exactly. And since goblin-made items only imbibe what makes them stronger, the sword imbibed the Basilisk venom, when you used it to kill the beast. Therefore it can now be used to destroy a Horcrux.” the old headmaster confirmed.
Draco was already lying in bed when Harry finally entered their room. He didn’t seem to be sleeping, but he didn’t acknowledge the other boy either.
Harry felt a plan beginning to form. If they could rescue Draco's mother, then maybe he could get the blond to switch sides. It was clear that Draco didn't want to work for Voldemort. He had been forced into his service. And he had asked Harry to help him.
Draco inclined his head and looked around nervously. The shadows were lengthening and it was rapidly getting darker.
Dropping the basilisk fangs, Hermione flung her arms around his neck and kissed him. The red-head dropped his share of fangs and responded enthusiastically.
Hermione had dumped the locket on the table before joining Ron upstairs. Remus waved is wand over it and mumbled an incantation. Harry shivered. He didn’t understand the words, but they sounded menacing somehow. As they watched a greenish glow surrounded the locket. It lasted only a few seconds, before vanishing again.
The thoughts kept going round and round in his head and he had no idea how he even made it through lessons on Thursday and Friday. He thought about asking Ron or Hermione for help, but quickly dismissed that idea. They would be shocked that he was even considering it. If they believed him at all. And despite him acting oddly, his two best friends were too preoccupied with their own lives to notice anything amiss.
After a moment Draco struggled to his feet and looked around. Goyle was still unconscious. There was no sign of Nott or Crabbe.
They fell asleep cuddled against each other, like they often did now. The next morning they went about their routine like always. Harry was happy to ignore his nightmare and the question of what to do next and was surprised when Draco spoke up after breakfast.
“At least I decide what to do with my life myself, instead of letting my father order me around. And I think being friends with Harry is a lot better than serving your psychotic master. How does it feel to be the lapdog of a madman, Nott?” Draco countered.
After a moment's hesitation he finally peered around the corner. Once again luck was on his side (thanks to the Felix Felicis, he realized belatedly). His father was standing only a few feet away, but he had his back to Draco and seemed completely focused on the girl lying on the floor in front of him.
“Finally! You will wait outside. You!” she pointed at Remus: “Guard him. And you...” she turned to Sirius, “follow me.”
“But he is in love with you. I'm sure of it. And he'd realise it if you were to court him a little more openly.”
“I can’t, Malfoy. They’re already speculating why I was seen at St. Mungo’s. I don't want a repeat of fifth year.”
"And then she punched him in the face." Seamus announced with a nearly manic grin, proving him right. "She's got an impressive punch, for such a tiny lass."
“Good. Now focus on your body. Feel every part of it. From your toes up your legs … your stomach … your back … chest … your arms down to your fingertips … and up to your head.”
“No, buts. With all the shit that happened in fifth year you had every right to be pissed at the world. Everyone gets angry sometimes. And everyone does stupid things sometimes. I mean, look at me. Look at how I treated you and Hermione for years. And I don’t have the excuse that there are dark lord bits in me.”
He dodged a group of giggling fourth year girls and ducked behind Honeydukes. This was getting really tiresome. He was just contemplating going back to the castle, when a young boy rounded the corner and stopped dead upon seeing him. By the looks of it he could only be a first year and Harry wondered what he was even doing here.
Hermione yet again didn’t know what to say. She was convinced that it was way too soon. But she could hardly say that. At least not without angering Harry. Oh Merlin, Ron was going to have a fit when she told him. And Molly would start fretting even worse.
Draco sometimes wondered if he was really the only one who still had a hard time adjusting. The only one who still felt the effects of the war so strongly. The only one who still battled his memories and frequent nightmares. Well, the only one besides Harry, of course.
“Did you see the Prophet?” the blond asked. “One would think they'd come up with something a little more creative than 'Harry Potter seen shopping with former Death Eater'.”
The loud voice made Harry jump. He blinked at the fuzzy outline of his godfather, who was clapping loudly and making cat-calls.
The blond believed him. His cousin was possibly even more reckless than Harry. And that was really saying something. He also seemed to have the same outrageous luck. Maybe it was a Gryffindor thing.
Harry's face darkened in anger. “Because it's her bloody fault! She told Dean that you put me under the Imperius curse!”
“Well, think back, have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?” Harry joked, causing Draco to chuckle.
The sound of someone clearing their throat drew their attention to the teacher's table, where McGonagall had gotten up. She waited until everyone had fallen silent.
Next was Reg Cattermole, a lanky guy from Magical Maintenance. Hermione, posing as Mafalda, slipped him a puking pastille and convinced him to go to St. Mungo's, which he did only reluctantly. He had only just disapparated when his colleague Bernie Pillsworth appeared. He was slipped another puking pastille and sent off to St. Mungo's as well, in the hope that the healers would think it was a bug going around at the department.
Harry smiled, but he couldn't quite push his fear aside. He'd slept poorly for weeks, haunted by the faces of those who had died for him. He didn't want to experience that again. But he also knew that Malfoy was right. He couldn't take Dreamless Sleep forever.
“I don't care what my idiot of a father thinks. I made a choice. I chose the other side. And now get out of my way before I hex you.” he punctuated his words by pulling out his wand and pointing it at the other boy.
But Harry had to admit that it had been more fun with Ron around. Draco was almost as dedicated to studying as Hermione and Millicent was usually very quiet, while the red-head always joked around. Now they only had Luna to lighten up the atmosphere.
Harry got a few more visions of Voldemort punishing Death Eaters, before the blond thief seemed to catch his attention again. At least the visions were good for one thing. The Gryffindor could assure Draco that his mother wasn't blamed for his actions.
This time when he got back to their room, Harry was sitting on his bed, staring off into space. Draco hated seeing him like this and vowed to do his best to help him through this day.
Draco’s attention was still on the portrait. After a couple of minutes Ariana reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, walking back towards them. But she wasn’t alone. There was someone with her now. They all watched in stunned silence as the two figures approached. When they finally reached the front of the painting, it swung open like a door and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his clothes ripped, clambered Neville.
In the end Draco had come up with the idea of getting married at Hogwarts. And Harry had agreed immediately. The castle had been home to them for so many years. So much had happened here. It was such a central part of their lives. And McGonagall had been more than happy to agree, as long as they chose a date during the summer holidays. Which really wasn’t a problem. They’d both wanted a summer wedding anyway.
“We should go to Hogsmeade tomorrow. Get some Christmas shopping done, before the rush sets in.” Draco mused.
And at least mother approved of his bond with Potter. "He's a nice young man." she'd said, when they had talked via the two-way-mirror on Sunday, "and I'm happy as long as you are happy, darling."
“I'll make sure you'll still get good grades. You'll just have to work harder for it.” Draco promised, before finally asking what had been on his mind since he'd first caught sight of the book. “Why didn't you tell me?” He couldn't quite manage to keep the hurt out of his voice. He'd thought they wouldn't keep secrets like this from each other. He'd thought they were closer than that.
He only looked away when Neville took a seat next to him. The other Gryffindor was pretty much the only one who still sat with him. Harry didn’t know where Neville stood with Dean and Seamus, but he frequently saw the three of them together. So he figured that Neville had obviously decided to stay out of their quarrel, or whatever this was.
Eventually he did fall asleep, but it didn't take long for the nightmares to come. It never did, these days. But instead of images of Voldemort or his dying parents, Harry now saw Ron and Hermione...
Draco caught Harry's eyes across the Hall and they shared a smile. People were still staring openly at both of them. According to Millicent the fact that they had been seen together yesterday had only fuelled the rumours.
Remus sighed. “I guess so. As Sirius said, we can apparate right into the pub. Aberforth should be able to tell us whether or not it’s safe to walk up to the castle. Maybe he even knows a safe way in. If not, we’re at least close enough to look for a better way.”
“Would he?” Aberforth challenged. “I’m not so sure. I think the fact that Sirius was in Azkaban fit quite nicely with his plans. If he’d been released he would have gotten custody for Potter here. Sirius was one of the few people who ever dared to challenge my brother. Who didn’t blindly follow his orders. If Potter had grown up with him, then he might have doubted Albus as well. But with Sirius in Azkaban, my brother had the perfect excuse for sending Potter to live with his muggle relatives, where he could keep an eye on him. And once Potter came to Hogwarts, Albus could start moulding him the way he wanted.”
The pub was crowded and noisy as always, but the Ravenclaw somehow managed to secure them a little table in a quiet corner. Draco ended up sitting between her and Harry. He didn’t know whether they had staged it like that so he would feel safer or so he couldn’t flee. Though, knowing those two it was probably the former.
He scooted closer and hesitantly applied the dittany to the blisters marring Draco's pale back. It felt strange, touching the blond so intimately. Even more so since they were both only wearing boxers. He was all too aware that they had kissed only a little while ago.
Ginny started fidgeting, still not looking directly at him. “Because I had to. Not because I really meant it.” she admitted, provoking yet another snort. Big surprise there.
With shaking fingers Harry pointed his wand at the crate and it slid silently to the side. Shrugging off the cloak he approached the dying man, a trembling Draco at his side. When Snape caught sight of him, his eyes widened.
"I can't be sure yet. It's a very complex subject and I don't know what kind of bond was used on you. There are about 20 different spells known today and some historians believe there might be quite a few more, which were simply forgotten. Can you believe that?"
His two friends didn't answer. They looked uneasy for some reason. Ron was fiddling with his napkin, while Hermione stared at the far wall, biting her lip.
Practice went okay enough. Dennis worked together really well with Ginny and Demelza. Ginny still flinched whenever Harry so much as looked at her. They hadn't really spoken to each other after the incident, as Hermione had started calling the attack on Draco. Harry usually only barked orders towards her during practice and otherwise ignored her.
“That was the stupidest, single most dangerous and reckless thing I've ever done in my life! I can't believe I agreed to that foolhardy plan of yours!” Draco shouted.
They ended up sitting there long past curfew and Harry missed the whole party, but he didn't much care. Ron really was a fool. And if things had been bad before, how much worse would they get now?
The whole thing was still very vivid in his mind two days later, when he went to Diagon Alley to buy his school supplies. The list had finally arrived that morning and Draco thought it best to get it over with quickly.
For once the old elf obeyed immediately. He froze and Harry let go of him cautiously. Kreacher didn’t move. He lay on the cold stone floor and continued to weep.
“She helped me, you know? Out in the forest. She protected me. She even lied to Voldemort. I probably wouldn't have beat him, if she hadn't helped me. And that's what I'm going to tell the Aurors and the Wizengamot and... everyone.”
Somehow the fighters were forced back into Hogwarts. Draco fought like a man possessed. His heart was thundering in his ears and one thought kept repeating in his head.
His visions of Voldemort had mostly stopped as well. Whenever the evil wizard's emotions were too strong, they would still get through Harry's defences. Like that one time, when he stole Dumbledore's wand from his tomb and felt completely elated about it. But Harry was getting better. At least Draco thought so.
The blond nodded. "A little while ago I overheard mother talking to Bellatrix. At the time the conversation didn't make sense and I chalked it up to Bellatrix just being crazy, but… She said something about a cup. And that she would not fail the Dark Lord like my father had done. She would protect hers."
"I had planned on running away, you know? I just couldn't take it any longer. Mother … she told me to run, when I had the chance. To save myself. She assured me that she would manage. I .. hadn't really thought it through yet. What I would do. Where I would go. But when I learned that you had been caught, I knew that I couldn't waste any more time. I knew that I only had that one chance to get us both out."
She got up and went to the door. “Thank you for telling me your suspicions. I will discuss this matter with the headmaster, once he returns from his trip. But now I need to check on Miss Bell. Good day to you all.” She held open her office door, so they had no choice but to leave.
“It was Ron, all Ron's idea.” Hermione gushed breathlessly. “Wasn't it absolutely brilliant?” “Something to get rid of Horcruxes.” Ron explained and Harry finally recognized those strange objects as curved fangs, torn from the skull of a dead basilisk.
She made a distressed noise, but Harry ignored her and went on: “They locked me in a cell in Malfoy Manor. And then... Draco came to save me. He helped me escape.” He decided against telling them about Rookwood and the torture, not wanting to relive those horrible moments. “We've been on the run together ever since.”
Draco makes his first appearance in this chapter. It's still from Harry's POV, but I think the next one will be from Draco's.
“Will understand. It’s not over, yet. The fight is going to continue soon. We need a break, so we can do what needs to be done when the time comes.”
They both got ready in record time and headed to the living room together. Andromeda tried to get them to eat breakfast first, but Narcissa laughed and said: “Oh, let the boys have their fun, Andi. You know they won’t be able to sit still until they’ve opened their presents.”
They ended up spending another night at the destroyed cottage, before moving on to the next house the Death Eaters had recently raided and the next one after that. There was no shortage of them, as it turned out and they were also quite easy to locate. Draco had found an old wizard wireless in the ruins of the cottage. They just listened to the reports about Death Eater raids and missing or murdered people, before deciding on their next hiding place.
Luckily Ron and Hermione chose that moment to return and tell them that they would arrive in about ten minutes. While shrugging into their Hogwarts robes, Harry and Draco filled them in about Nott.
Ron fumbled for something to say, unable to look at her. Harry tried to make a shooing motion without Hermione noticing, but his friend didn't seem to get the hint.
“Due to these tragic circumstances, all lessons are suspended and examinations postponed.” McGonagall continued. “Professor Dumbledore requested to be buried here at Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic has kindly granted his wish. You will be allowed to stay at the castle and attend the funeral, as long as your parents agree. Once professor Dumbledore has been laid to rest, the Hogwarts Express will take you home.”
Deciding to ponder that fact later he hurried down the stairs, only slowing his steps once he reached the door to the bathroom. He could hear sobs and the voice of Myrtle, crooning softly. Taking another deep breath he pushed the door open and stepped cautiously inside.
"Erumpent Horns are Class B Tradeable Material! They can explode at the slightest touch." Hermione explained.
There was Nagini, suspended in the air in some sort of enchanted, starry sphere. Harry wondered what kind of spell might penetrate that magical barrier. He wouldn't be able to try out more than one. Cloak or not, once he shot a spell at the snake, he'd give away his position.
The blond led him through what appeared to be alleyways, bordered by all the stuff people must have hidden here for centuries. Finally they stopped in front of a large cupboard.
Draco had never had many friends in his life. Crabbe and Goyle had mostly been his lackeys, following him around and obeying his orders because their fathers had expected it of them. Then there was Blaise of course, but as Harry had pointed out, a true friend wouldn't abandon him to save his own reputation. So that left Pansy as his only real friend. He still missed her terribly, but she was doing well in Beauxbatons. She sounded happy in her letters and Draco was glad for her.
Only when Harry took his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze, did he lift his head again. To find most of the others smiling at them. No-one seemed to mind. Well, no-one but Ginny (who was once again glaring daggers at him) and maybe Fleur (who looked slightly put out). Mrs. Weasley assured them that they looked very lovely together, while they had to endure jibes from the twins and their older brother Bill. Draco was pretty sure that Sirius was only keeping his mouth shut because he had received some sort of warning from Remus.
Great. Just what he wanted. Regular sessions with a mind healer. If the Daily Prophet caught wind of that they'd have a field day. Finally they'd get proof that he was the nutcase they had made him out to be back in fifth year.
So here comes the last part. A big thank you for all your kind and encouraging words. I loved reading all of your comments. And there were some interesting guesses on who's behind the bond. You were all wrong, though. But a few of you already guessed why Harry's scar split open.
Their parents were notified of their actions, which prompted quite a few howlers in the following days. Ginny alone received two and was nearly in tears when Mrs. Weasley's magnified voice echoed through the Great Hall at breakfast, berating her for her thoughtless actions and ordering her to apologize to poor Draco.
Taking a walk with Luna was still better than sitting around on his bed and brooding. She seemed to be the only one aside from Harry and a few Slytherin first years who didn't mind being seen with him and he found that he quite enjoyed talking to her. She was a bit like her father's magazine, he mused. If you looked past the weirdness, there was a sharp mind and interesting opinions.
“I am trying! Do you think I want you to prod around in my mind? Do you think I want you of all people to see my embarrassing childhood memories?” he yelled.
“I really don’t know what the fuss is about. Those two were clearly made for each other.” Lavender chimed in.
Hermione's timetable was so full that Harry could only properly talk to her in the evenings. She refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, so Harry mostly joined her in the library. Sometimes Draco and Millicent were there as well. And Luna, who tended to show up unexpectedly. The three girls had formed an unlikely friendship and could now often be seen studying together.
“Don’t you dare breathe a word about this, Blaise!” Draco hissed. “I know enough of your dirty little secrets to make your life hell!”
Remus stifled a sigh. “I know you, Padfoot. You never stick to the basics. I can vividly remember Harry's reaction, after you gave him the Talk. He couldn't look at us for days. And Draco's still a bit skittish. Especially around you.” Hopefully Sirius' stupid little stunt hadn't destroyed the progress they had made with the shy blond.
Once again thanks for all the lovely and encouraging comments. I actually managed to get a longer chapter done this time. Hope you like it.
Draco nodded. “Yes, there was. And that connection sort of dampened Harry’s powers. So when the dark lord died, he finally got access to his full magical strength. But the thing is, he’s got trouble controlling it. His powers react to his mood. Which means that they tend to get out of control when he gets angry.”
‘Kendra Dumbledore, and her daughter Ariana. Where your treasure is, there will your heart also be.’
All too soon they found themselves back in the stone passageway from where they had started. Sirius was sad to leave the brooms behind, while his boyfriend looked happy to get his feet back on the ground. Remus opened the door leading to the main hall, peeking out cautiously.
Harry led them back into the protective circle without really thinking about it. Hermione's shocked cry made him whirl around, ready to face an intruder. Instead he saw his friends pointing their wands at Draco and he inwardly cursed himself for not mentioning the blond before.
Thankfully Draco and his mother appeared only minutes later, accompanied by Moody and Tonks and he breathed a sigh of relief that everything had worked out so far. The atmosphere was tense at first, but everyone seemed willing enough to get along. Narcissa gave up all the information on Voldemort she had and seemed resigned when Dumbledore reminded her that there was nothing he could do for her husband, who was still in his cell in Azkaban.
"Yes. Even if we had no say in the matter, I think whoever did this actually did us a favour. Somehow it almost feels… fated, you know? That after years of fighting we should … end up here. With each other."
He turned around to find Crabbe and Goyle standing there, wands pointed straight at him. He couldn't hear the others.
It looked as if Sirius hadn’t even heard him. He continued to shoot curses and hexes at the snake with a look of fierce determination. One of those hexes made the snake float up towards the ceiling. Sirius dove underneath it, executed a perfect somersault across the dirty bed and landed next to Draco on the floor. Without pausing a beat he grabbed Draco’s elbow, yelled “Hold on!” and everything went dark.
Her friend screamed too, seizing her ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Hermione and Millicent rushed to help her, but before they could grab her she fell down. Ron managed to catch her, but now she was writhing and still hadn't stopped screaming. It was horrible.
Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins as Draco joined him. Some toppled over, but others took their place and kept advancing. There were just too many. The dragon was roaring in the background, obviously afraid of all the noise.
After a while Harry cleared his throat and very politely asked Kreacher to sit up. Hermione would no doubt have been very proud of him, had she been here. Then he finally took off the fake Horcrux and gave it to Kreacher, stating that Regulus would have wanted him to have it. But being presented with a family heirloom of his own was seemingly too much for the old elf, for he burst into tears again.
"We sealed it. I don't think it can be broken." Draco murmured, glancing at him. "And even if it could, they couldn't force us to break it."
“Open the vault.” Draco ordered and Bogrod pressed his palm against the door, which melted away to reveal a cave-like opening crammed with coins and goblets, armour, skins of strange creatures, potions in jewelled flasks and a skull wearing a crown. Harry was strongly reminded of the room of requirement.
Once again Potter was greeted with a wide smile. But when the man behind the counter spied Draco, the smile quickly turned into a glare.
This time the dark-haired boy agreed and they made their way to the kitchens, luckily without encountering anyone. The house elves were happy to see them and quickly produced a tray of sandwiches and some tea for the two boys, as well as a generous helping of treacle tart for Harry.
The next few minutes passed in silence, with Harry wolfing down his food, while Draco ate with a lot less appetite.
Professor McGonagall was crouched over someone on the floor. Draco could only make out red hair and lots of blood and felt like he might be sick. Ron was next to his head of house, looking deathly pale and close to panicking. A few feet to the left Millicent was trying to shield Neville's prone form from stray hexes.
“No buts, you bull-headed Gryffindor! We’re not rushing into this without thinking it through first.”
Nott was a few paces ahead of them. Draco saw him veer off to the right and grab a heavy-looking broomstick from one of the piles. He mounted and swooped away. Draco’s eyes zeroed in on the two brooms still lying there. Probably the only chance of escape they had.
Okay, what do you think? Was that last bit too unlike Harry? Crawling into Draco's bed? I wasn't sure, but I really wanted the boys to cuddle.
The injured were being treated by Madam Pomfrey and her helpers on the platform. The dead were lying in a row in the middle of the hall. Draco saw Mad-Eye Moody and a sixth year Slytherin girl he knew from the DA meetings among them. And the little Gryffindor, who had loved to bother people with his camera. He quickly averted his eyes, afraid of seeing anyone else he knew.
The Gryffindor girl squealed and pulled him into a hug. Daphne gave a huge sigh. “Oh finally! I thought you'd never realize it!”
In the end Remus did the only thing he could. He gave in. There was just no arguing with Sirius once he'd set his mind on something. The only thing he could do was try to keep him out of trouble. Just like old times.
Harry grabbed his hand and the blond flinched slightly. Reluctantly he looked at the other boy, surprised at the sincerity on his face.
“I think he needs some time to himself.” the werewolf said quietly. “It’s a lot to take in and I know that he likes to pretend otherwise, but he did care for his brother.”
"You should bring him hot chocolate. That always cheers me up when I'm sick." the little boy next to her piped up.
They had to break the kiss again, due to lack of air. Draco buried his head in Harry's neck, mouthing at the sensitive skin he found there, while they rocked their hips together, their gasps and breathy moans filling the air. Harry's hands had stilled their aimless wandering and were clutching the Slytherin's shoulders for support instead, as their pace increased.
“Of course we know that you'd never hurt us intentionally.” the girl hurried to assure. “But you said you couldn't control it. Harry, that's not normal. I think you should see a healer.”
“What … what are you doing here?” Harry asked, trying in vain not to stare too openly at the tempting vision before him.
Before he could panic there was another loud crack and Dobby appeared with Ron, who was carrying an unconscious Hermione. She looked horribly pale, had various cuts and scratches all over her face and blood was dripping from her arm. Ron looked pretty scratched up as well. They had both been very close when the chandelier had come down.
“Yes, you were.” she agreed readily. “But … since Harry believes that you've changed, I'm willing to give you a chance. So I accept your apology.”
"Potter wouldn't want to intrude on his friends. So it's the perfect opportunity for you to ask him out." Pansy reasoned.
He flinched when he heard Hermione screaming in pain again. Ron continued running around in panic, hitting the bare stones with his fists. Bellatrix was yelling at Hermione, asking about the sword again and again.
Harry could actually picture that look quite clearly. Obviously so could the others. Draco chuckled and Daphne started giggling as well. The Gryffindor couldn't help but laugh along.
Harry kept insisting that Hogwarts would be their best bet, but Remus pointed out that hiding a horcrux in a place like Hogwarts would’ve been impossible. The risk of it being discovered was just too high. The others agreed. After some grumbling from Harry and a few more discussions, they turned their sights to other places that might hold a meaning for Voldemort. In the end they settled on three possible spots.
Being on the run with Draco was a lot different from the time Harry had spent on the run with Ron and Hermione. They were his best friends and he had known them for years. He was used to spending a lot of time with them, used to their reactions and their ways of thinking.
“Yeah, they're fine. We all stayed with Bill and Fleur, until everyone had recovered. And now they're at auntie Muriel's, with the rest of my family. She has a big house and it's protected by the fidelius charm. Dad is secret keeper.” Ron reassured him. “We had to leave the sword behind, though. And we had this really weird chat with Ollivander. You-know-who had asked him all kinds of questions about a special wand. The death-stick, or whatever. Ollivander said that Gregorovich was supposed to have it...”
“It drove her mad. Sometimes she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and harmless. My father went after the bastards that did it and they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d done it, because then they would’ve locked Ariana up in St. Mungos for the rest of her life. We had to keep her safe and quiet. So we moved and put about that she was ill.”
Harry was distinctly aware of how close they were standing. Of the heat radiating off Draco's body. Of those expressive grey eyes boring into his. Had Draco's eyes always been that grey? Like storm clouds. Harry liked storms. He felt strangely breathless, staring into those storm-grey eyes.
Harry stopped when he reached his bellybutton, suddenly nervous again. He felt Draco’s hand in his hair, gently caressing his scalp and dared to look up at him. His breath caught in his throat at the sight. Draco’s hair was a dishevelled mess and sweat dotted his forehead. His lips were kiss-swollen, his pupils so wide his eyes looked nearly black. His chest was rising and falling with each rapid breath. Harry was sure he’d never seen anything more beautiful.
Harry could picture it quite clearly. Teenage Aberforth, standing up to his famous older brother. It must’ve taken a lot of courage.
But Remus nodded. “Once or twice I had to clamp my hand over his mouth to shut him up at the last second.”
Harry yipped again, trying to get the message across that he needed to use the bathroom. Now.  Malfoy simply smiled again. He was really rather good-looking, Harry had to admit. Especially when he smiled. Too bad that he had more urgent matters on his mind right now. He ran to the door with another yip.
Draco was about to ask why Harry needed cheering up, when he remembered the date. Tomorrow was Halloween. The day the dark lord had murdered Harry's parents. Which explained why the Gryffindor had been so subdued today. And it would only get worse tomorrow.
And it had been good to get it off his chest. To finally share his burden with someone. But he didn't say that aloud. No need to aggravate Pansy even more. Especially since his words seemed to have mollified her somewhat.
He didn’t spare a glance for his surroundings or the people standing around in varying degrees of shock. He only had eyes for Harry, who had backed up against the wall of the cramped living room. He was deathly pale and gasping as if he couldn’t get air into his lungs. His eyes were wide with panic. And all around him his wild magic was pulsing in angry dark waves, ready to lash out.
He was giving Harry that strange look again. The one that made him nervous, because he had no idea how to interpret it.
They left the castle and walked along the lake. It had gotten cold already, but today the sun was shining and there was only a light breeze.
“Dumbledore must have known that his will would be examined and that they wouldn’t give Harry the sword.” he reasoned.
"Oh yes, very fitting." Parkinson said unconvincingly, before quickly changing the subject. "So, do you think dear Astoria was pissed enough to write you off?"
He hadn't said a word about Weasley's old, worn robes or his many siblings. He hadn't even snapped at the red-head when he'd stared at Draco the whole time. Lucius would be so very disappointed with him.
Fleur was one of the rare exceptions. She obviously hadn't gotten a hand-knitted jumper, which made Draco feel a lot more accepted. He hugged Mrs. Weasley back when he found himself enveloped in her arms yet again and thanked her for the gift.
They crept a few steps further and then Draco heard it, too. Loud voices, yells and bangs and the unmistakable sounds of people fighting.
Not willing to run around the castle, looking for the blond git, he fetched the Marauders Map, which reminded him that he really should contact Sirius and tell him what had happened. Later, he decided, staring at the map until he spied the tiny dot labelled Draco Malfoy. He was in the kitchens. Well, not that surprising, considering that he'd missed lunch and dinner.
“Okay, I'm not even sure if Hermione bought that stupid excuse, but I sure as hell didn't. So what are you really planning?”
A knock at the door made all of them jump. Professor Slughorn came bustling in without waiting for an invitation. He was closely followed by professor Flitwick, professor Sprout and Hagrid. All four of them looked stricken. Hagrid was dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief.
Where was he right now? What dangers would he have to face? The Slytherin couldn't shake the fear that something would go terribly wrong. Ron tried to distract him, but gave up after a while and went to join Neville and Millicent at the other end of the corridor.
He had failed. Voldemort would win and it was only his fault. Because he'd been stupid. So incredibly stupid. He'd given in to the urge to see where he'd come from, like a lost little boy. And by doing so he'd run right into Voldemort's trap.
They both grabbed fresh pyjamas and crept out into the hallway, trying to be quiet so they wouldn’t wake Ron and Hermione. Once inside the bathroom, Draco threw a locking and silencing spell at the door. Harry tried not to think too much by it. Tried not to feel pressured. This had been his idea after all. He peeled off his sweaty clothes, staring at the wall so he wouldn’t be tempted to look at his boyfriend, who was stripping as well.
Yes, he'd acted like a total brat that day, all-knowing and aloof, when in reality he'd been a nervous wreck. It had been the first time he'd tried to make a friend and he had gone about it all wrong.
Before the Slytherin could respond to that, Snape swept onto the scene. The onlooking students shut up immediately. Some of them tried to sneak away. Others were suddenly very interested in the pattern on the floor. The Potions master took in Nott's predicament with a stony expression. He waved his wand and the boy dropped down to the ground in a heap.
After a moment the blond nodded and they both got up. "You're not planning on dragging me to your common room, are you?"
“It was nice talking to you, Draco. I know we’ve never really been friends, but I was hoping to change that.”
After brushing his teeth and changing into pyjamas, Harry stood in front of his bed contemplatively for a long moment. In the end he turned away and padded over to Draco's room. The blond was still awake and looked almost relieved to see him.
Once again a massive thank you to everyone who took the time to leave a comment. You made me very happy.
But it never came. Harry was inspecting the Dark Mark like he had the Celtic knot. He didn't seem shocked or appalled. Only curious.
“I regret what must happen.” Voldemort said, though he didn't sound like he regretted anything. “You have been a good and faithful servant. But the elder wand cannot serve me properly, because I am not its rightful master. You killed Dumbledore. While you live, Severus, the wand cannot truly be mine.”
Harry was in a corner, looking at Bathilda questioningly. “What is it?” he asked. She made a weird, hissing sound and Harry turned towards the table to his right.
His own mood had taken a definite upturn as well. Aside from a small group of fans, people had finally started to realize that he was just a normal person and he didn't get bothered as much any more. The hostility towards Slytherins and Draco in particular had lessened as well. While he still spent a lot of time with the blond, they also regularly ventured out into the common room now. Harry got to spend time with Dean and Seamus again and Draco had struck up a friendship with Terry Boot. Last weekend there had even been an impromptu eighth year Quidditch match.
At first everyone had just sat around, listened to some music and snacked on the food Goldstein had provided. A few people had even started dancing or playing games as the evening progressed. Harry and Draco had mostly sat on a couch and watched the others, with the blond providing a quiet and very funny commentary.
Harry squeezed his hand encouragingly. "Usually this room is filled with mountains of junk. Books, trinkets… everything you can imagine. And.. there's also a vanishing cabinet. Similar to the one at Borgin and Burkes." He took a steadying breath, before continuing: "They're connected, usually. But the one here is broken. I… He wants me to fix it. So he and his death eaters … so they can use it. As passage into the school."
The dove vanished and they sat there, staring at the empty space where it had been. Then Harry jumped to his feet.
"I thought..." Harry mumbled thickly, unable to put into words just what he'd been thinking. He didn't need to.
At least the window offered little resistance and they were able to get it open quickly. Climbing out proved tricky though, since there was almost no room to manoeuvre and their joined wrists hindered their movements.
And yes, he did know that. He'd always known that about Harry. Brave and reckless till the end. And even if he could change his boyfriend, would he really want to? Wasn't that recklessness part of Harry's personality? Part of what had made him fall for the younger boy in the first place?
They looked at each other and dissolved into laughter, though it was short lived. Already Granger was frowning at Draco again. But it was Weasley, who spoke up:
Draco scowled at her. "It wasn't a date. We studied together, like always." His scowl deepened. "Only that tonight Potter insisted on studying in the library. And Weasley was there. Sitting at a table with us."
After lunch he headed to the library with Blaise to get started on his Arithmancy homework, before it was time for this afternoon's double Potions. Only a dozen people were progressing to NEWT level and he was surprised to find Harry and Ron among them. Slughorn's expectations obviously weren't as high as Snapes.
A sound like a cannon blast echoed through the silent hall, as the two curses collided in the middle. The elder wand was ripped from Voldemort's hand and sailed through the air. With the skill of a born seeker Harry caught it. The Dark Lord fell backwards as his curse rebounded, arms splayed wide. He hit the ground with a dull thud and moved no more.
“Do that. Hermione knows what I thought of that present.” he claimed, though he wasn’t really sure. He’d never had the guts to tell her.
After what felt like an eternity Remus returned with Ron and Hermione in tow. Hermione still looked a bit pale and Harry felt guilty when he realized that he hadn’t given any thought to her injuries.
A scream of rage left his lips and his wand slashed through the air, slaying the goblin and every Death Eater who didn't manage to run away fast enough.
Remus joined the hug as well and then Ron and Hermione were there, both of them crying. Draco was so fixed on his friends that he didn’t notice much of what was going on around them. A few people nearby had already noticed that Harry was alive and well, but most still seemed to believe he was dead.
“I virtually lived in this room all last year. I know how to get in. All we had to do was wait outside. You ran right into our trap.“
He nodded curtly and allowed her to tag along, while Blaise decided to look for Parvati, in case she needed someone to comfort her. Hermione and Neville headed back to Gryffindor tower to assure everyone that Harry wasn't too badly hurt.
Harry was still lying on the floor, clutching his forehead, his face contorted with pain. “He’s coming!” he gasped, staring at Draco in wide-eyed fear. It took the Slytherin only a second to understand.
Now Weasley looked like he'd swallowed his tongue. Draco tried to turn his chuckle into a cough,  with limited success.
Andromeda had already placed the promised camp bed in Draco’s room. It wasn’t as cramped as he’d thought it would be. In fact, his room appeared bigger than he remembered it. The blond suspected that his mother had added some extension charms to make it more comfortable for them.
“I sent for her. With this.” Neville explained, holding up a golden coin. “These have been great, Hermione. The Carrows never figured out how we were communicating. And now that you guys are here… I thought we’re going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows. Right? So I sent for them. For all of them.”
“But then one night I had a horrible nightmare. It was about Greyback. I woke up screaming and Daphne rushed over to comfort me. I was so out of it that I let her. The next day I was convinced that she would mock me. Instead she told me about her own nightmares and we started talking. I realized that she wasn't at all what I'd expected. She was smart and funny and very kind. So once I finally got over my stupid prejudices we quickly became friends. And then it just evolved into more.”
On the other hand she couldn’t deny that he was obviously good for her friend. Harry had sounded happy in his last letters. And like he was really getting better. She’d been worried about him. The nightmares, the break-up with Ginny, the problems with his magic … All of those were things she hadn’t known how to fix. And instead of trying her best and offering support, she had taken off to Australia with Ron. She had run away. And she wasn’t proud of it.
Hermione was currently staying with the Weasleys. She had altered her parents’ memories and sent them to Australia to stay with extended family for their own safety. And Ron was supposedly dying of Spattergroit, though only his father and the twins were in on that plan. Mrs. Weasley already suspected that they were up to something and kept watching her youngest son like a hawk. Harry and Draco hadn’t gotten much chance to talk to him alone during their few, brief visits to the Burrow.
"Just be glad he's grateful for once." the blond chimed in with a smile. "As am I. We owe you a lot."
Slowly the panic was receding. Draco let go of his wrists, but didn't move away. He was sitting so close that Harry could make out his features despite not wearing his glasses.
The blond rolled his eyes. “It was very enlightening.” And had led to a completely absurd discussion with Potter, which had lasted for over an hour. Draco couldn't even remember what exactly they'd been discussing. Only that it had been fun.
But he never got the chance, because after breakfast Harry suddenly announced: “I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.”
Then Draco grumbled something along the lines of: “too bloody early...” and sat up as well, finally drawing Ron's attention away from the chain. The blond promptly blushed when he noticed that they weren't alone, which caused Ron to start laughing almost hysterically.
Harry took a deep breath, calming down a little. “Okay. And Sirius and Remus are going to head back there as well, right?” he checked.
“And of course I'm going to continue studying on my own and I'll sit my NEWTs with you in June. McGonagall already gave me her okay.” Hermione chimed in again.
The important thing was that he could actually rely on Harry. He could trust him. And Harry trusted him in return. The nightmares were slowly becoming fewer, but there were still enough nights where one of them would wake the other with his screams. They had gotten used to comforting each other by now. Harry had even started talking about his nightmares, albeit reluctantly and without going into detail. Draco had learned not to push.
Draco blinked, trying to make sense of the garbled mess. Potter hadn't meant to spy on him? And he thought Draco was ... sweet? And he'd kissed him. In public.
They left the room and slowly made their way downstairs. The question of where the wedding would take place had been cause for a lot of heated discussions. Narcissa had, of course, suggested the manor, while Molly had insisted on the Burrow. Blaise had brought up the idea of renting a French Chateau, while Luna had let them know that it would be best to hold the ceremony in a meadow of wildflowers, since it would keep away the Nargles. Sirius had even offered Grimmauld Place (though Harry was pretty sure that had been a joke).
