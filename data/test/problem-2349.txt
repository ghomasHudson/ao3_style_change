“No… you might actually be onto something there, Potter.”
“Have you found anything worthwhile yet?” Fletcher appeared at his shoulder, peering down at the bark in his hands. She frowned. “What’s that?”
The sofa curled around his frame, though it could equally be trying to swallow Draco into its depths, never to be seen again. He dragged the nearby blanket over his legs; it did nothing to solve the cold that sat forever in his chest, pressing on his lungs and his heart. The fire was dwindling, offering no solace, but it provided enough light for Draco to prop his book on his knees and read.
in from Central London. Why the flying f-f-flobberworm didn’t you pick us up from the Ministry headquarters?”
It was simple enough to organise. Draco began levitating the food into their newly allotted space, three items at a time, and Potter appeared a few moments later. He dove into each of his bags and physically placed them inside the cupboards, leaving a large bag of chocolate on the counter for Fletcher’s sake.
.” Ares uttered, before skipping in the vague direction of the voice.
Draco topped up the warming charm as they watched and waited for the day to close. The group roasted a hare across the fire as the sunlight dwindled, ripping into it with their fingers once it was cooked. They paid no attention to three shadows slipping past, out of sight and earshot.
Potter was looking at him curiously and Draco almost didn’t want to move under that gaze. It seemed to be doused in intrigue and surprise, as though Potter had always known who Draco was and this had changed his perspective. Guiltily, Draco thought he didn’t mind that – proving him wrong.
He blinked.
“Well, lovelies,” The nurse clapped her hands together. “If that’s all for today, then I’ll escort you to the exit. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further queries or requests.”
Was he supposed to feel a fire of burning desire in his core? It had never felt like this before, so utterly exposed and protected. Harry’s lips were wide apart, offering everything he needed. Draco bit Harry’s bottom lip, propelled further when Harry released a tiny gasp, his fingers grabbling for Draco’s neck. The touch was hot against his skin, lighting alive every nerve.
“Perfect. Any music preferences?”
That was the most triumphant statement he had made since the War. Life was continuing, whether Draco was tagging along or not. And for the first time in years, he felt like he might stop getting dragged along without a choice in the matter.
Two quiet knocks were repeated on the door. Draco stared at the door, wide awake but reluctant. Would Harry be the same? Would
Draco slumped onto the edge of the minibus, teetering between the inside and out. His brow was furrowed as he weighed the likely options. Knowing Potter’s saviour complex wasn’t something that could possibly have been resolved in a short five years, it was a highly likely option that he was planning something stupid. It was more likely that Potter was already knee-deep in his self-inflicted trouble.
Grudgingly obedient, Draco yanked the belt across his body and crossed his arms.
“What was that?” Potter must have sensed it too, his fingers moved to his wand. “Malfoy, Juniper?”
“I’m fine. There are a few final guests to attend to, and then, I’ll grab a drink.” Draco replied, swaying into Harry’s body a fraction as he looked around the room.
“I think it’s about time you let somebody in, Draco,” Potter said and Draco rapidly looked away, glaring at his feet. His jaw tightened. Who was Harry Potter to tell him what he should do? “It doesn’t have to be me. But you should talk to someone.”
Then, it was a short wait. They sat in the provided chairs, gazes gliding around the room absentmindedly. Potter’s fingers were drumming against his thigh. Draco tried not to focus on the steady rhythm of the movement, forcing his eyes away, only for them to return.
He was roped in for a few more unusual cases, the kind that the Ministry’s bone headed Aurors couldn’t wrap their simple minds around, and he set a standard. Draco became the department’s first official consultant, his work primarily based at home where he could remain within the legality of his house arrest for the remainder of his probation. Once the term had ended, he was thrust into an office of Death Eater hating colleagues. But at least he was on the payroll and could begin refilling his sparce vault at Gringotts…
So, lockdown life got in the way and then I binged "The Bold Type" on Netflix, but I eventually finalised this chapter. I'm also toying with a theme to stick into the fic when I do a huge edit at the end, but I don't know if I can pull it off. It revolves around this one line that stuck with me: "Did anyone have Potter and Malfoy become cordial colleagues on their post-war bingo cards?", but we'll see!
The bedframe released a heavy groan when Harry clambered onto his knees at the far end of the bed, his (once again) overgrown hair draped across his forehead, eyes locked on Draco. In a gradual, casual crawl, Harry made his way towards Draco. His gaze was heavy, piercing and emerald. Draco’s mouth ran dry.
It took a small transfiguration of the sofa, another glass of water on the coffee table and the removal of Draco’s wine bottle. Potter was climbing into bed when Draco left the room, not looking back. He certainly didn’t look back to see Potter’s drowsy face as it settled against a cushion, gaze drifting slowly across the ceiling, nor to catch the small flick of Potter’s wand as the lights flickered off.
“She and I are not that different.” Potter lifted his head an inch, enough to find Draco’s gaze and hold it for a moment too long. “I suppose I have a history with obsession too.”
They were drawing closer. Harry’s hand was curling around to Draco’s back now, his body marginally closer. And Draco woke up each time far closer to Harry than when sleep had beckoned.
“But—”
Pansy would never let him live this down if she found out.
She nodded firmly, patting her bag. “Yep, the photos are here, and we’ll know if they step even an inch outside of the law… I hope.”
Harry led him to a pair of chairs near the altar, Narcissa's portrait peering from nearby.
Apparently,
“Alright.”
So, he waited for his colleagues to return. They did, miraculously not having procured another form of transport, and carried armfuls of packaged food. Potter struggled to pull the door open, but once he did, the pile was deposited next to Draco.
“You have an interesting taste in sleepwear,” Draco said, cutting him off with perfected ease.
“Don’t be a fool, Fletcher. We were talking about work.” Draco answered, flipping the page. “Need I remind you that this is a
“Is your mother well?” Potter asked.
“Go home.”
As he curled up in his dorm, hundreds of metres above where he used to sleep, he thought he could still hear the gossiping.
Better yet, the space wasn’t solely his – it was
Through a hazy gaze, Potter drew away and shrugged.
“Are you my fucking careers advisor, Potter? I can take care of myself.”
And then, Potter said, “Did you really call yourself David Brent? Like from
“This is a work trip, not a holiday, Malfoy.” Potter answered firmly instead, and that was it. No hint of annoyance, only firmness.
we even taking this thing? Wizards are capable of much faster transportation, you must know. Unless you take the blasted Tube to work every day too.” Draco rooted his argument to another pet peeve of his: the London Underground, crammed with sweaty muggles and Fletcher, on occasion.
The pub was sufficiently nice. It was styled in the same old-fashioned style that was notorious in London’s pubs, it was stocked with wooden panelling, armchairs and rickety stools galore and a fireplace tucked in the far wall. Draco had been in a lot of pubs since he left home and this certainly wasn’t the worst. From what he could tell, there was a basic level of sanitation and particularly low quantities of dust gathering in the shadows. He still couldn’t trust the food that came from the concealed kitchens, on silver trays to hide the poor attempts at plating, but it would do.
3. I do not support JKR nor her transphobic views and I stand with the trans community. This hadn't been mentioned on any of my other works, it was about time it was.
The last of the groceries were slotted into place and the cupboards closed softly, leaving Potter and Draco stood in the kitchen, hands on hips, with nothing left to move.
A smile came to settle on Griffin’s face, one of blissful innocence. Once a couple of minutes had passed, cars chasing lorries, the expression was mirrored on Potter.
The victim of his natural gaze was leant against the kitchen counter, his own china cup clutched between two palms, lips pouted as he cooled the contents with gentle breaths. He looked tired, sleepless even.
Mr Griffin was in no state to answer any ground-breaking questions. He deserved the peace and care that this institution could provide him without three nosy investigators forcing themselves where they weren’t welcome. And as much as Draco wanted to solve the case and move on to another challenge, this wasn’t the time to push. Griffin’s mind wasn’t for excavating.
“If you don’t mind,” Draco said, rising to his feet and hooking Harry’s hand in his. “We have somewhere to be.”
That were not addressed to the person who uttered a quiet response, their words whispered across the dark room,
If possible, Harry pressed even closer.
“Right then, just you and me.” Potter looked at Draco, his chin lifting a fraction to peer up at him. “Unless you have plans too?”
“Maybe I am.” Potter replied quickly. “Is that problem?”
Potter rolled his eyes, but neither stopped to discuss anything more. They continued to walk, dropping into almost silence, their boots stomping through the frosty mud. They certainly weren't heading in a conventional direction and much to Draco’s displeasure, Potter seemed to be leading them to the castle boundaries. Potter paused on the threshold of the Forbidden Forest and looked across at Draco.
It was curious though, Griffin’s behaviour. Had it existed before the cult? Or was the cult responsible for the damage to his mind? The latter seemed most likely, on the wide spectrum of possibilities.
He would do fine. Not as well as the three of them combined, but then again, Draco and Fletcher’s collective intelligence wasn’t something that could be contended. Potter could handle a few questions. Surely, he’d had more difficult interviews, the Auror programme interview certainly not being one of them – one pro of almost single-handedly saving thousands of lives from ruin and being a privileged prick.
promotion.”
He stood there a moment longer, then he took off in a sprint, dragging Draco by the hand. Harry ducked into every room, just quick enough to catch the house pulling away the white sheets in the dining room and the reception and the kitchen. But by the time, he had released a whining Draco to run up the stairs into the first bedroom, the house had outpaced him.
Sleep came a little quicker, once his toes had warmed and the night’s events stopped rolling through Draco’s mind on a loop. It stuttered on Potter’s laugh each time, the reel getting lodged. Somewhere through the fifth loop, Draco drifted away.
Draco was staring. “A—a cupboard?”
The elders of the camp were spread around the area, lying on the ground with their eyes to the sky. Life looked uninteresting from Draco’s perspective, but there were smiles on their lips and a dazzled look in their eyes. Joy was an integral part of daily life to these people, it seemed - nothing malicious or cruel.
“I see.”
Potter didn’t seem to particularly care who saw them, he appeared to have no qualms about his reputation. Saying that, Draco noticed that he also waited until everybody had fallen asleep to tiptoe down the stairs and join Draco on the couch. Each time, he settled into Draco with a sheepish grin. For some reason, neither of them found the need to say much at all.
Draco had enough to care about. He visited his mother in the evenings, resisting the temptation to wrap her frail body in his arms and never let go. Pansy met him for lunch on Wednesday, flashing a shiny engagement ring that had been slipped onto her finger on Sunday by the most successful bachelor in her own miniature dating show.
, without all the shields and defences.”
“Is that all I am to the great Harry Potter?” Draco mused through his smile, spinning Harry back around in his arms so they were resting chest to back once more. “A reliable, first-class booty call?”
Christmas didn’t carry its festive mood to Malfoy Manor this year. It didn’t usually.
“Ok, I’ve got it,” Potter said, lifting his head from the map and grabbing Draco’s forearm. “Ready?”
They head back down to the Ministry then the office, in silence. Draco sensed it wasn’t awkward nor was the air electrified with tension; it was simply quiet. He forced himself to keep his gaze ahead after it dropped too many times to watch the way their feet stepped in synchronism. His derby shoes and Potter’s boots.
Draco tossed and turned until he fell asleep despite the abusive thoughts. Fletcher, too, followed into the pits of sleep. Leaving only Potter.
“-Mrs Malfoy was found at her home in Marceilles at 4 pm this afternoon and is suspected to have passed of natural causes. You will be contacted to arrange transport and any necessary burial of the body.” It paused, as though for effect, before the voice issued its final statement, “The Ministry offers its condolences.”
Potter didn’t pay notice to the indirect insult, but there was no doubt he already knew about Draco’s dislike of him and his office fanbase. He nodded lightly.
“What a relief,” Draco remarked sarcastically, wasting no time as he leaned in for another kiss.
Then, they sipped the steaming coffees over their work, legs stretched out so far that they almost met in the middle. The heat warmed Draco from inside out.
“I know the perfect place,” Draco murmured against his ear, as Harry’s body moved to press against his side. “Nothing but the best for the Chosen One.”
Fletcher snorted and then, as though he had been waiting for their return, Potter caught their eyes.
“I suppose I can rearrange my busy schedule if necessary.” He answered, staring Potter down with a displeased frown.
Less than four months to go. He’d be leaving his home for good and moving on. Would anybody be coming with him?
The atmosphere was stilted as he entered, although there seemed to be no correlation or causation. The beginning of the week was always rough. Fletcher offered a tired smile as she slumped behind her desk and began flipping through her files. Worker after worker piled in, the last stumbling through the door twenty minutes late with a small coffee stain on their sleeve.
Narcissa’s death had made Page 3 for a day, before dropping off the public’s radar. The funeral itself wasn’t even publicised, not that anybody was eager to attend the memorial of a deceased Death Eater. Granger and Weasley showed up regardless, acting out their short display of sympathy. Harry sat with them for the duration since their relationship was still somewhat secret, at least from the press.
“The war.” Potter’s expression toughened.
“You went
“What is this place?” Draco asked hesitantly, still eyeing the back of the vehicle as the engine jumped to life again.
They parked up a further ten miles down the road and Fletcher set up the concealment charms and warding as Potter stretched the interior of the van.
Harry positively beamed. “I’ll meet you in the common room in ten.” He shuffled to the edge of the bed, reaching forward to drag open the curtain.
True to his word, Potter dedicated the entire waking morning to research. They perched around the two desks, having transfigured the sofa into an additional chair, and pored over the texts Fletcher had brought. She seemed to have borrowed half of the Ministry’s archive. The texts ranged from case files on previous dark groups (Malfoy claimed the Death Eater file) to the largest encyclopaedia of ancient runes to a selection of muggle books on the psychology of criminals.
Granger was watching Draco as he entered the Great Hall for breakfast the following morning. Pansy was at his side complaining, about exams, with the same intensity as fifth year. Suddenly, Harry was walking towards them, ignoring Granger as she called after him.
Draco watched. He noticed the small wrinkles that appeared in Potter’s forehead as he drove the toy around tight corners. He saw the simple connection he had made with Griffin. A smile was tempted onto Draco’s lips.
There were hands on him, arms around him maybe, someone’s skin against his, but he paid no attention. Instead, sobs racked his body, tears cascading down his cheeks. The pain consumed his body in a cascade of grief. He could feel nothing, except everything.
“Potter—”
“Earth to Draco?” Fletcher tugged on his elbow as they left the office and walked down the long corridor. They’d redecorated this summer, swapping the neutral colours for some appalling spiral wallpaper – Michaels in Muggle relations probably suggested it,
There was a burst of colour as a green orb shot into the room, skidding seamlessly through the wall and halting in the centre of the room. It interrupted whatever thought Harry was dictating, instead he pulled out his wand without a second thought and demonstratively pointed it at the automated piece of magic. It fizzed and spun irregular circles in its place, morphing in and out of the shape of a raven, dysfunctional.
Potter waved a long strip of paper. “Expenses are covered by the department, remember?”
been slowly easing into the mindset that another day of work was almost over, and his bed was beckoning his lethargic limbs. Who knew you could exert so much energy sat at a desk all day? But now, Potter and he were sprinting to the Atrium, and Draco’s legs ached.
“What? No, I—"
Draco lifted his gaze from his lap into the honest, green eyes of Harry. “But—“
This was it, Draco’s opportunity to slither away from unwanted socialising with Harry Potter. He didn’t want to be any friendlier than they already were, it was
The interior was much nicer than the outside, Draco decided, as he settled into a leather seat and laid his bag at his feet. There was a long, smooth platform of grey plastic opposite him, which connected to the large window that he could stare out.
Harry's gaze followed his, widening as though he’d forgotten the clusters of lovestruck fans that had been watching them fly for the past hour. He swallowed heavily, turning back to Draco. “Let’s go, they’ve had their fair share of my private life for a century.”
And then, they were leaving.
He had perhaps thirty guests on the guest list. Less than fifteen had shown; his own father stuck in Azkaban to weep his sorrow alone.
Prior to Harry’s moment of ingenuity, they’d never had much trouble spending hours upon hours there, but now, Harry didn’t have to mutter little white lies of comfort while the cold stone wore down his skin.
Fletcher herself clambered into bed and cocooned her body within the duvet, only a nose left in the open for oxygen. Draco made dinner against his body’s pleas. It took tremendous strength to lift a single arm and stirred the pot intermittently, but he managed it.
But the magic they’d picked up at the crime scene had been far too old, it had woven with the natural magic of the forest and become indistinct. Draco couldn’t line it up enough with the wisps of magic that drifted their way – it was strong but not dark, and there was something underlining its strength but Draco couldn’t quite place it.
He couldn’t quite shake it.
On Friday morning, they met at one of the Ministry’s stations in – what Draco had recently understood to be colloquially known as – zone four of London, specifically in the south-west, between Twickenham and Richmond.
They trundled along slowly, constrained by what seemed to be limits on their speed – signposted in big red circles or a particularly strange symbol in black and white that had Potter sharply speeding up.
“It’s the centaurs you need to watch out for, not me,” Potter smirked. “Watch your step.”
“Not that I can see,” Fletcher frowned, tipping to her furthest reach. “Do you reckon it’ll be a triangle-shaped area again?”
Potter’s problems were his own, after all. And he meant nothing to Draco.
One of the beds hadn’t been slept in when he woke.
“Yes, that’s right. Are you both well?” Shacklebolt asked with genuineness stained in his kind eyes. And Draco hadn’t met him until long after the war, but he could tell they had always been that way –
Then, it was the two of them.
Draco tore his gaze away. “Don’t look at me like you’re so much better than—”
He grabbed his wand as he swung himself off the sofa and tentatively stepped towards the door, reaching for the handle. Preparatory inhale. Then, he yanked the door open.
The sun shone on Potter’s back as he knelt down to the floor, picked up a toy vehicle – one of those lorries that had been miniaturised to fit inside a palm – and he offered it out to Griffin. There was notable hesitance. Then, a hand reaching out to grab it, a large palm engulfing the small toy.
Draco scoffed with a laugh, “Potter,
Potter’s hand was still holding his wrist. It was warm. Draco stared at it and nodded.
The world blurred as an unbearable pain tore through Draco’s heart.
Regardless, he unscrewed the cap and took an experimental swig of the liquid. If he died, he died a mortal as all wizards ought to. The Dark Lord had been so scared of death, he had refused to accept the simplicity of it. Draco would welcome it with open arms, instead.
Draco was gone by 3 am, slipping into his bedsheets with the intention to garner a few hours of sleep (despite Weasley’s incessant snoring). Potter wasn’t in the common room when he walked through in the morning.
It was all over the school by lunch. For that reason, amongst many of his usual reasons, Draco avoided the Great Hall. He endured his classes. They were manageable, despite the whispering and Granger’s gaze on his back.
“This is going to be an utter trainwreck,” Draco said as they pushed through the office door.
But a call drifted through the trees, coming from the camp area. A woman’s voice; it shouted Ares’ name multiple times. The tone was playful, almost that of a mother fetching a mischievous child – Draco had heard that plenty growing up. Regardless, the owner was nowhere to be seen and Draco wasn’t going to risk this case.
The portrait entrance creaked open and a pair of low voices carried themselves through to the common room. The bodies accompanying them appeared a moment later. It was Granger and Parvati, talking in hushed tones and both clutching textbooks to their chests. They looked exhausted and didn’t notice Draco. That is, until Granger sent Parvati on without her, stopping to pick up a stray cushion from the floor.
He’d ask and Potter would just shrug, “I live.”
“I don’t think it’s worth coming back to observe the group next week,” Potter said into the air, tipping his head up slightly to catch Draco’s eyes and then down to Fletcher. “Are all the necessary spells in place, Juniper? And you’ve taken the photos of all the suspects?”
“I’m aware, Juniper.”
Draco’s body remained stiff for a further eleven minutes, not daring to move and face the wrath of a sleepy Potter. Eventually, once the breathing had settled to a calm, steady pace, Draco relaxed a fraction. He stared at the pages of his book, begging the words to give him some sort of explanation to this strange phenomenon. They didn’t. They simply sat there patiently until Draco blinked a few times in quick succession and began reading again, wholly aware of the man settled against his side.
“Draco, look, I don’t know if this is going to work, but you have to stop fighting it,” Harry was saying, “Because I want it to work. I want you mentioned on every page of my bloody biography. And for some unknown reason, maybe by the hand of a muggle’s god,
When he clambered back into the minibus, Fletcher was still sleeping soundly.
“Clearly,” Replied Draco, badly concealing a matching grin. It broke through a little, a flash of teeth, then it vanished. “Let’s go, before I receive twenty hexes to my back.”
In old times, magic of this kind was used to create specific shapes and generate natural wards. So, the odds were that the two trees they’d found were part of a larger geometric shape – the more lines, the greater the strength of magic… in theory.
So, instead, he muttered a half-hearted “Fuck off, Fletcher,” and watched the wicked grin that grew upon her lips, tying her cheeks together.
Potter took an awkward sip of his tea and looked anywhere but his two colleagues. “I see.”
Potter cleared his throat, drawing the attention inadvertently. “Yes, Juniper. Overtime will be paid; Kingsley is handling it.”
The voice that emerged was fierce and confident, a powerful lull falling around them.  The birds seemed to stop singing outside. That wasn’t why Draco paused, rather it was that the voice had a hint of sympathy.
It was peculiar, this silence between him and Potter as they shared a confined space. The only other instance that matched these circumstances was those late nights they both sometimes spent in the office, poring over their individual work at the opposite ends of the room. Neither ever spoke. Draco nearly always left first, prioritising his sleep over whatever overtime wage he might be paid at the end of the month.
“No, nothing that will hold up in a trial.” He glanced back at the group. They looked harmless enough, many of the members were too young to know any complex magic, and they probably couldn’t fight off an Auror and two relatively experienced wizards. “Why don’t we take them in for questioning?”
Potter looked like he had a twig up his arse the entire evening regardless. He occupied the same position as the night prior and stared into the mid-distance, barely blinking behind those ridiculous glasses.
Draco supposed swearing wasn’t upmost professionalism, not least at an Auror.
Did Potter not attend the trials? Did he ignore every copy of the fucking Daily Prophet that unveiled the darkest truths of the wrong side? The Death Eaters, the innocent civilians, the people who made awful mistakes – they didn’t get to decide what was kept in the shadows. They still didn’t.
is important to you at Hogwarts, Draco – before it’s too late.”
The moonlight played a trick on Draco’s vision, faking a small lift of Potter’s lips.
It was only when Fletcher caught up to him in the Ministry hallway the next morning that Draco spoke another word.
“We need to track them first,” Draco remarked, chewing the edge of his quill. “Ideally, a trip to the crime scene would be more productive than anything we can achieve in this office.”
“Ron was driving me up the walls with his endless Chudley Cannons talk.” He said, dragging Draco down with him into the alcove.
In a complicated, disorganised mess of paperwork, the property had been passed to James Potter following the death of his parents in 1979, then to Sirius Black, then somehow to Remus Lupin. And in and amongst the aftermath of the first wizarding war, then the complications of Sirius’s incarceration, and the spark of a second war that followed, the legal administration failed to inform a single person of their sudden ownership of the house.
“And his childlike behaviour?” Draco pushed.
“That’s good. It feels like everybody in the damn office is thrilled to be there so—” Draco stopped himself from correcting that statement to
It looked a little different now. Draco noticed that the air was completely still here, he lifted his eyes and noticed that nothing was moving. The forest was cowering away from the clearing, creating a sturdy barricade of branches and leaves. In an instant of realisation, Draco recognised that chilling feeling he felt. Dark magic. The Killing Curse. He shivered.
CW: Implied insomnia
“No, really. It was inappropriate, I should have…” Potter trailed off, his eyes catching Draco’s. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, I like your flat, it’s beautiful in the morning light – or maybe any light... I guess I didn’t really pay attention to much more than the bottom of your toilet last night.”
The cult was nameless as far as they knew. The department had managed to pick up some malicious whispers and chatter over the past few months, mere suggestions offered by other case suspects they’d brought in for questioning, who were desperate for an inch of leeway. There was nothing significant to evidence the rumours, the chatter was merely static on an undercurrent of the overall black market.
The intention was to be soothing, he supposed, but something was holding him back: the screaming voice trying to flag how utterly foreign this situation was.
“Will you sleep, Potter?”
Potter nodded and indicated to a sign that flew past in a blink. “I’m going to stop at the petrol station.”
But she sounded happy and Draco knew she wasn’t often happy while she worked. He wouldn’t take that away from her, no matter how much Potter agitated his very being.
“It’s forgotten, Malfoy.” Potter said abruptly.
about it.
“Wizards don’t either.” Potter said, his shoulder pressed to Draco’s.
Harry rolled his eyes, but smiled nonetheless. “I wonder how quickly this house will rejuvenate itself for me.”
Winter was creeping closer. Draco clung to the bright, vibrant colours of autumn. He didn’t want the trees to dissolve into their skeletal corpses of rough bark and pointy branches. He didn’t like winter. It used to be his favourite season but nowadays, the sharp air punctured his lungs and left Draco numb. Last year’s winter had been long enough to last a lifetime. So, he would far prefer rain: the sporadic, living, passionate rainfalls that washed away his thoughts.
“You will not use me as such, Potter,” Draco replied firmly, propping his book at a sharper angle on his legs. Draco eyed Potter and jerked his body as close to the edge of the sofa as possible. It was helpless though, the saggy sofa was determined to slump them together.
“Seriously…? Harry!” Draco wanted to lecture him, tell him why they shouldn’t be sharing the same sofa, the same oxygen, not like this, inches from one another. Perhaps he should insist upon distance, he could hardly confess that he wished to hold Harry close and protect him. No, he couldn’t say that. Instead, Draco figured he could make Harry proud. “I took your advice. I saw my therapist today. She rents a tiny office in Hogsmeade twice a month to talk with me, she’s quite remarkable.”
Draco blinked at Potter, who seemed determined to whisk them out of the door as fast as possible, and nodded. “Ok. Let’s go.”
And Harry folded his arms. He didn’t resist as Draco’s fingers curled around his forearm and pulled him gently. He let himself be led to Draco’s bed and complied without a word when Draco lifted the crumpled duvet, clambering in.
“Are we finished for today, Harry?” Fletcher asked, pulling a chocolate bar out of her pocket and taking a large bite. “I’m starved.”
“Exactly,” Potter followed Draco’s gaze. “Why are they travelling at all?”
If nothing else, it was an ignorant bliss. They blocked out the world and its people, settling for each other’s company and touch and enlightened conversation.
The sound bounced through the forest, breaking the peace, and the two suspects whipped their heads up in search of the source. Draco froze out of instinct, despite the protection of the cloak. It took ten long seconds for them to turn away and continue their potentially illegal activities.
He was striding down the long, dusty corridor, a picture of pure elegance and grace. And as he caught Harry peeking from their alcove, he smiled. An automatic smile, a small lift of his lips that grew into a toothy grin, out of his control. The kind of smile that made his face lose the years of trauma, the kind that felt like home. It
He said nothing in return. He caught Potter’s eyes four hours later in class, looking worse for wear with two hours’ sleep under his belt, and his lips must’ve curved into some poor attempt at a smile because Potter was smiling back at him. Then, Granger nudged him and he was gone. Draco was left to stare at his back for the rest of the lesson.
“Yeah.”
“This-“ Draco made a vague gesture between their bodies, “-isn’t normal! Everybody else in the whole damned world seems to realise that.”
Draco sat up, propping the pillow behind his back as he rubbed his eyes and blinked into the morning light.
Draco gave up at around 11 pm and got ready for bed in the adjoining bathroom where the front seats had been. He slipped into the far bed, reading a few chapters of his novel until Fletcher joined him in the neighbouring bed, still nibbling on some crumbly snack. The lights were dimmed by Potter, but he didn’t move – remaining on the couch, fidgeting, and staring into oblivion.
Draco had assigned no value to the cards ten months prior, especially since it was Sybil Trelawney’s hands that placed them down. He had sneered to himself, casting some look of disdain from the table to Theo.
on their post-war bingo cards?
“I can research it once we get back to the Ministry.” Draco offered.
Harry’s eyes narrowed slightly, swinging to the faces beyond the pair of them. He turned and led the way into the slightly darker corridor.
That gaze – Despite everything they’d been through, Draco felt that he’d never grow to regret what came next, no matter how unprepared he was. Maybe, sometime in the not-so-distant future, Harry would piss him off and be bloody righteous and so fucking Gryffindor. But Draco wouldn’t regret choosing to smile at Harry and striding forward. His broom fell to the ground and Harry’s eyes widened.
“This is a recon mission, Malfoy. We are not risking the entire investigation.” Potter hissed, a hand on Draco’s shoulder to pull him sharply back against something hard, against Potter’s chest. “And we are definitely
I am concerned that you pose a threat to the welfare of somebody else.” She stated it all matter-of-factly. She did not drawl, she spoke with eloquence, Draco liked her already. “Now, Draco, where would you like to begin?”
“Talking solves nothing. Don’t be naïve.” Draco spat back. “It doesn’t turn back the fucking time.”
He left half an hour later, once he’d finished several chapters and Potter was fast asleep, his fringe splayed messily against his forehead. The floorboards creaked under Draco’s weight but Potter didn’t stir. As Draco slipped under his covers, he wondered whether Potter stayed there the entire night. Nobody could blame him; Weasley’s snoring was shaking the tower tonight.
They trudged back to the roadside, managing to locate the minibus after wandering down the road for half a mile. Fletcher and Potter chatted lightly about their other work cases as they walked, but Draco dragged behind, kicking at the gravel below his feet.
So, it was back to Malfoy, right, obviously.
The clasp on the front door lifted itself free and the tired wood swung itself open with a heavy creak as he neared.
It had been more than six months since Draco had found somewhere safe to sleep. Even still, he never slept well. But he nodded again and watched Potter leave. Always leaving. Why did everyone have to leave?
“I’m going to… use the toilet facilities.” Draco mumbled, noticing a distant throb in his crotch as he scrambled to his feet.
The bedroom was sparkling; the pillows on the four-poster bed were freshly fluffed, the curtains pinned back to reveal the shining sun in the sky, the desk polished with a notebook and pen placed for use in the centre. Harry raced into the bathroom and the other three bedrooms, but the house had outsmarted him by now. It almost beamed at him, every part standing tall on its toes, its brick chest puffed out. He paused in each of the last two bedrooms.
Greeting them politely, the receptionists took their information and signatures, then delved into a long debriefing. They rattled through their list of pre-determined discussion points, shifting from the topic of appropriate behaviour to sensitive questions to confidentiality. Notably, they had a strict policy against extracting memories for criminal investigations. Draco paid keen attention, hopeful to avoid any unintentional trouble, but Potter’s mind seemed distant as though he’d heard it all before.
“Macmillan knows not to come back for a few hours,” Draco said nonchalantly, wandering to his bed, lifting his loose shirt over his head. Harry was peeling off his robes behind him, they were dropping to the floor. “We’re in the clear until dinner.”
“Besides, if you’re concerned for his health, you can rest assured that I take great care of him. And we sleep better than ever,” Draco answered with a smirk. “Right, Harry?”
“Don’t be a prat, Draco.” He said in a whisper.
He’d managed to avoid spilling the detailed facts of last weekend’s work trips, which his mother considered personal enough to share (she was an avid fan of Fletcher), but Draco suspected he would not escape his mother’s carefully posed questions this time around. Perhaps, he would bring her some of that chocolate Fletcher adored. A simple bribe was never below a Malfoy.
Harry walked across the stony driveway. The house shook itself off with each step that brought him closer. It straightened up from its hunched posture, its weeds shrinking back between the paving stones and the crack in the upper window sealing itself.
Well, Draco thought, if he was going to bear the consequences, he should take full advantages of the perks. His reputation would be boosted (his father would be bloody ecstatic to hear so), maybe fewer people would spit on the ground he walked from now onwards, and… and he still had Harry. If there was anything that would draw Harry closer to him, it was others’ criticism – he was a stubborn idiot like that. Harry would defy their expectations; Draco fucking loved the sound of that. Him and Harry, side by side, sticking their middle fingers up at the rest of the world. Draco smiled to himself.
, then...” Draco said, his words igniting a flutter of the curtains as they dusted themselves. “...
But Fletcher shook her head. “Are you driving back, Harry? I’ll join you.”
Just Potter and him in one another’s arms.
His only other social commitment consisted of Greg fire-calling him on Thursday evening while Draco leant against the mantle, listening and smiling at the correct prompts.
Draco hummed in faux agreement. His attention was primarily fixed on Potter and Griffin.
Draco watched them with an unimpressed expression. What even was this place? Some kind of refuelling station, he could guess. Muggles clearly weren’t that smart if they couldn’t invent a piece of transport technology that didn’t require a fuel source yet.
The morning’s mood was established as a result of her words.
“Don’t look at me like that, Malfoy.” He said. Draco slightly corrected his expression; he couldn’t help it. The Forbidden Forest wasn’t exactly notorious for being a tourist hotspot, and nobody could blame him for imagining with horror what exactly Potter intended to
Draco set off in the opposite direction to Potter. He would take the longest detour to class if he must. There was a gaze on his back. Draco ignored it.
He was quickly swatted in the arm and hushed as Potter indicated towards the two suspects. They’d straightened up, stood together, admiring their handy work. Their heads tipped to the side as they stared at it. Then, the two subjects were gone.
“Too late,” Potter said. He was probably smiling. He did ridiculous things like that: smiling at inappropriate times, acting all high and mighty, saving the world. “I’m not taking it back.”
Potter and Fletcher were probably laughing at his ridiculous behaviour as he walked. He was the sore thumb out of the trio, after all – oh
Potter glared over his shoulder.
A weird clunk noise knocked through the car and Draco gripped the seat, looking quickly around to find the source. He could see Potter at the rear of the vehicle, staring meaningfully at the side of the minibus, and there was some sort of whoosh from whatever he was playing at. Perhaps, he was feeding the vehicle explosives and it would spontaneously combust before they even reached Devon. Perhaps, it was harmless.
, and he refuses to divulge even the tiniest of secrets.”
A faraway thought drew closer to the forefront of his mind, some obvious truth he didn’t even want to contemplate. So, he remained thoughtless as he trudged back to the observation spot, thankful for once that he wasn’t wearing robes. It was easier to move through the terrain without them, plus he saved several sickles on dry cleaning.
Tonight was no different, except for one meaningful disruption that left Draco wondering if Potter would ever come find him again.
He made a mental note of the artists mentioned, vowing to give them a try later. Fletcher would be proud; she might even try to drag him to a few concerts. She did attend those rather frequently, rocking up to the office the next morning, a grin stretched across her worn-out face. Perhaps, Draco did already have a brilliant tour guide, if he’d only ask.
Those sparkling emerald eyes waited expectantly; they offered a sense of safety and trust. It may all be a deception, but they were patient.
The ancient armchair by the common room exit was slouching under Harry’s weight, Draco noticed. He noticed a lot of other things too as he emerged from the stairwell: the way Harry’s flying kit clung to every muscle and dip, his casual smile as he chatted to a nearby Ravenclaw, the way nobody watched Draco as he walked – not until he stopped dead in front of Harry. That caught a significant amount of attention, several people not so subtly brandishing their wands in preparation for a confrontation. Instead, Harry grinned at him.
Draco found himself wishing his imagination hadn’t stretched so far when something in his chest sunk.
“I’m not sure my answer will satisfy you,” Draco replied swiftly. He tugged the blanket up to his chin as he spoke, shuffling beneath it so that his limbs lay strictly separate from Harry’s because he could already feel the heat flooding out of Harry. It was too tempting for a man like Draco, far too tempting.
“Ready?”
Potter nodded and smiled for a split second.
The van creaked, wind whipping by the windows, as Draco padded across the room. It somehow didn’t take much thought to open the door and peer outside.
“I see. Well, she’d— right.” Draco stared at the mud around her boots, feeling a flush of heat rise to his cheeks. “Fletcher! Did you correct the spell?”
So, they packed up, leaving the area as untouched as possible. Slipping further into the wood and a few hundred metres into the woods, they apparated back to the minibus. It was Draco this time, who grabbed Fletcher’s wrist and tentative clutched Potter’s elbow.
Potter shrugged. “It’s good to talk about it. I see no reason not to tell you. The days get a little easier when you talk about the hard times.”
“Mr Draco Malfoy. This is an announcement from the Ministry of Magic.” Harry’s tight grip on his wand eased a fraction as his eyes slid between the green patronus and Draco. “Narcissa Malfoy has died-“
An hour after midnight, Draco kicked away the covers and lingered on the edge of his bed. The room hung in a calm quiet; Fletcher’s voice had settled to gentle murmurs and Potter wasn’t there. Draco’s heart raced for the shortest of moments and letting his sleepy mind guide the way, he slipped his boots on and headed for the door.
“Bullshit.” Draco retorted.
He read until the floorboards behind him creaked. Draco twisted quickly, grabbling for his wand. Potter looked at him with his head tilted to the side, a curious expression on his face. And Draco froze, his wand pointing at Potter.
“I wasn’t—Potter?”
Potter and Fletcher snapped their heads in his direction, the same question of their lips.
Fletcher was frozen, her shoulder hunched as she fought a shiver. “I haven’t felt magic like that since the–since the…”
It was almost two in the morning and Draco had accepted that he wouldn’t see Harry; not only was Draco not going to the common room but Harry hadn’t come to find him either.
,” Draco answered quietly. He knew that Harry wouldn’t hear it in his sleepy state, but maybe it would plant the seed in his subconscious. “I want to get out of this bed.”
And before they knew it, Potter had been hanging around so long that Draco had begun to drop his t’s and brew enough for two cups of tea in the morning - all unbeknownst to himself.
Draco shook away the grip and pushed off, folding his arms. “Fine. You’re the boss.”
The occasional bickering became gentle arguments - self-righteous stubbornness leading the way - then fully-fledged fights. Doors slammed and red faces, hurtful words and lost meanings.
Draco wanted Harry.
“Indeed.” Draco adjusted his crouched position slightly so he could stare better around the boulder and yanked his wand out from where it was lodged between their bodies. “I’ll see if I can match their magical signature to the remains that we found a few miles away.”
Potter and him. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
Now, Harry Potter had sauntered back into Draco’s life and seated himself at the core, kicking his dirty boots off and making himself at home (not so metaphorically as one would hope).
“Splendid,” He drawled in response, veering toward the case 341 office. “And you, Juniper?”
Fletcher rolled her eyes in muted agreement. She had been uttering quiet noises of complaint about the department’s severe case of favouritism and unconcealed bias since she was transferred in a year ago. And thank Merlin she was, Draco clung to her sarcasm as a lifeline during the work week.
The three of them rolled onto their knees to peer down at the camp. Two of the elder members were huddled around a tree on the far perimeter, wands in their hands as they traced symbols in the air. If Draco squinted hard enough, he could almost see the blurry outline of the runes in the bark.
Draco took his time to analyse the lazy smile on the man’s face, categorising it as unthreatening, before carefully uttering his lie.
With a small scowl, Harry tossed him a look. Although, it was too shrouded in lust to be convincing. The grip on his hand tightened.
“Nothing of interest. It seemed like he could remember segments of living in the woods, but nothing more.” Potter scratched his neck. “He doesn’t know why he left, he only remembers the hospital.”
He discretely stuck up his middle finger at her smug face as he slipped out of bed. Her grin only widened.
Why did he need this uncontrollable flurry of emotions that breezed from his heart to his lungs to his stomach? Why couldn’t the butterflies emigrate elsewhere? They didn’t belong here, not least in Draco’s stomach.
There was no trace of them. There was still an imprint in the grass, and the patches of bare soil where Fletcher had ripped all life out with her fingers, plus the small puddle of tea Potter had spilt earlier.
So, as the light was fed through the dimmed minibus windows the next morning, Draco stirred, thankful for the calm awakening. He rolled onto his side, gradually noting where he was, who he was with, and it all felt simply uninteresting.
His mother's portrait looked across at him, a perfectly straight face watching as he held Harry Potter close. She wouldn't approve, Draco hadn't given her the opportunity before she passed, but he swore there was a sparkle in her eye.
They were sleepy and not as bright as usual, but they had a slight twinkle.
“Your mum lied; I suppose you know that by now.” Potter continued after a moment. “She saved my life, I owe that much to her. Everything could have been, er, very different. After all, I can only survive death so many times.”
They locked eyes once as they both navigated across the busy train platform at Kings Cross. Draco looked away at the same time as Potter, dropping the gaze of which nobody else knew the significance. Nobody knew that Potter spoke to Draco as his equal, nobody would possibly imagine their saviour making small talk with a former Death Eater. Draco turned and made the journey home alone.
entailed visits to Teddy and dinner at Granger’s and Weasley’s flat, and avoiding the Prophet’s latest X-ray cameras. It involved taking Draco on day trips to France, to Japan, to any country that proclaimed him to be the miraculous saviour he was and therefore gifted free entry whenever he pleased. Living meant spending hours with Draco, around him, pressed against him, savouring the taste of him with fluttering eyelids. As though it was the first time, perhaps it was the last.
“Do either of you recognise them?” Potter asked, his grubby fingers reaching out to borrow the strips from Fletcher and stared down at them. He didn’t take Ancient Runes though; he wouldn’t have a clue.
like Draco and his type, who were destined to prove their worth for the rest of time…
After a deep inhale, Harry lifted his eyes.
“We’d better head back to London – Kingsley is expecting a briefing at 9am.” Potter said, as they reached the minibus, and yanked the back doors open. He pulled out a plastic water bottle and held it out. “Here, I arranged a portkey. It leaves in ten minutes and drops you behind the Costa Coffee down the road from the Ministry.”
” He faltered, his voice breaking as it stumbled on his words. “I’m sorry...!”
“You noticed that too, huh?”
’ in that annoying tone of yours.”
Draco was left behind.
“I don’t quite believe that yet,” Draco whispered back, his touch slipping beneath Harry’s jumper in sought of hot skin. He smiled against Harry’s lips, “I’m going to lock you into a miserable marriage before they do.”
His tone wasn’t challenging. The words were posed as a straight-forward question that hoped for a straight-forward answer. Draco reached for the necklace that was buried beneath his clothes, the one belonging to his mother. He thought of her kindness, how it still existed for him. She could never be a monster in his eyes, and he never in hers. They still had love. So, people like him?
He folded his arms sceptically and turned to watch the dark trees fly past. Draco was too tired to skirt around the topic and far too reluctant to answer.
“I’m asking exactly the question I asked.” Potter repeated wearily, his neutral expression unchanged. “Do you like your job? Genuinely.”
“I see the department still worships the sun that shines out of Potter’s arse,” Draco answered instead of igniting a normal conversation with a co-worker.
Now was the perfect opportunity…
Enough information had been gathered to suggest the group practiced dark magic, following what muggles called black magic rituals, and rumours suggested it was
When Draco returned his gaze, inevitably, to Potter, his eyes were closed and his glasses had been discarded. Potter was tucked into the cushions and he was breathing steadily. He looked more at peace than Draco had ever seen. He had seen Potter angry and stupidly happy and on the brink of death. Peace suited him.
Potter was playing a game. He wouldn’t drag Draco any further into it.
The sly bastard opened his eyes and tilted his head to look up at Draco. Merlin, he looked ethereal. The fire was casting shades of orange and amber and gold across his complexion; it lit his freckles alive. Draco couldn’t turn away.
The moon was nestled among the peaks of the trees when Draco climbed into bed. The lights went out and Fletcher was muttering in her sleep, and Draco tossed and turned. He slipped to the edge of consciousness and back again, sleep never entirely within reach even as the moon rose to its full height in the sky.
Swallowing heavily, Fletcher looked over her shoulder and saw Potter, his tired eyes blinking at them. An apology was on the tip of her tongue, then Potter moved, lowering himself back behind the desk, and began reading once again.
Three tarot cards had been laid before him, once.
“I’m glad you’re here with me.”
It was nothing more than an alcove in a dingy corridor of many. Carved out between three slabs of stone. There was a window high above, and a ceiling far out of reach, three walls and a heightened horizontal slab to sit upon. All of it was stone, the very essence of the Hogwarts architecture. That was this little escape in its entirety.
“Are you a…” The man looked around carefully. “
The recipient of his incoming apology minutely tilted his head in Draco’s direction and that was enough. It was easier if Draco couldn’t see Potter’s eyes anyway.
“Will you join us?” Harry said once he reached them and Pansy looked behind them. Her expression returned in confusion once she realised Potter meant the pair of them. “Draco? You too, Pansy, of course – if you like.”
“Ernie spends every Saturday morning by the lake, Draco. He’s not here.” Harry told him with an amused smile, shaking Draco’s hand away. “How is it that I know your roommate’s habits better than you do?”
“—We’ve already discussed this, Potter,” Draco interrupted when Potter began repeating a redundant point he’d made ten minutes prior. “It’s unlikely that there is some evil mastermind at the centre of this group. This could be a large group of highly competent wizards, as the complex charms imply. We shouldn’t dismiss them as a gang of deluded followers with a psychotic leader.”
So he’d sworn off relationships, convinced himself he had no desire for them and was better off on his own. Which wasn’t an easy feit when Harry seemed to have stumbled into his life—quite literally, Harry finally introduced himself to Draco at the bar after accidentally bumping into him—and the poor git wouldn’t leave, despite Draco’s attempts to scare him off.
That’s inevitable.”
He ran down the street in the pouring rain, frantically searching for the mop of hair that his fingers always found their way into. Around him people stared, but he didn’t care. Nor did he care that his expensive outfit was getting soaked.
Draco cupped his face, cradling it in his hands as he brushed their noses together affectionately. “You are the
“That’s a good boy,” Draco praised, low and silky smooth. He circled him slowly, brushing fingers through his hair and gripping randomly, making Harry gasp.
Now it was Harry’s turn to be irritated, “The inevitable? Draco—you and me,
Draco. The good with the bad.
As he pressed their foreheads together their surroundings faded and they didn’t take notice of anything but the two of them stood there in the rain, passersby diverting their eyes from what seemed like a private moment.
know you and I don’t want anyone else. I’m not settling by being with you Draco…” he cupped his cheeks and pressed their foreheads together, Draco unable to resist leaning into the tender embrace. “That would be my life
Harry gently pressed a finger under Draco’s chin and tilted his head up, needing to see his face,
He could still remember the way Harry smiled bashfully like he was confident with his choice—he’d seen the mug at a thrift store and thought Draco would appreciate it—right up until presenting it to him, that was.
Judging by the small micro-expressions and winces that were betraying Potter’s true reaction, he wasn’t experiencing any success. Griffin was now toying with the frayed edges of his t-shirt as Potter talked, eyes in his lap, his mind elsewhere. There was an occasional nod, or perhaps a shake of his head. He seemed too anxious for a single answer to be worthwhile their time.
the work week regardless), but then Fletcher shook her head at Potter in response. Draco aggressively folded his arms, swallowing the outburst that could cost him a job when it was directed at Harry Potter.
Harry thrust his hands out of the blanket, they stretched into the air perpendicular to his body, and wiggled his fingers – a silent demand. Draco rolled his eyes, conceding, and lifted Harry to a seated position.
Granger’s eyes landed on him from the moment she walked into the common room, Weasley on her tail. She looked intimidating enough to make Draco shift in his seat and shuffle further into the corner of the sofa as Granger made a beeline to him, pausing momentarily to greet their schoolmates but never shifting her gaze.
Potter eased the minibus into each lane, moving with more speed once they’d earned a place in the inner lane, before he moved back to their original position on the far right, and seemed unperturbed about the steady stream of vehicles around them. Draco stared in muted awe at the large containers on wheels that trundled down at some significant speed besides them; sometimes as they passed by, their entire world dimmed for a handful of second before the sun emerged once more from behind the metal giants.
Perhaps, he spent a marginally longer time contemplating how Potter kept in such good shape. From the short glances he tossed in the man’s direction, Draco noted the muscular thighs that filled the denim fabric. Auror work didn’t require that much physical activity, not anymore; most of the miserable creatures spent their time completing paperwork and attending coffee catch ups with ‘important Ministry liaisons’. Potter was in the same boat. So, perhaps he was a runner. No, Draco decided – Potter’s arms were too defined. They, too, bulged against the sleeves of his shirt. It must be some sort of conditioning training, he’d heard muggle gymnasiums were effective for this sort of thing. That was where the 2002 winner of the
“Shut the fuck up, Malfoy.” Potter almost rose from his seat,
Harry reached to touch the doorframe, fidgeting fingers following the cut of the wood. It softened at his touch.
“You were wrong.” Draco folded his arms, rolling his eyes. His expression was slipping though, as Harry smiled, clearly not buying his act. “You don’t know me as well as you think you do.”
Potter actually beamed at him, the brightest grin Draco had seen all day – although, the stink of his breath left much to be desired – then he retched. The dry cough of air brushed Draco’s arm and he pulled away in time for Potter to grab a nearby plant pot and throw up. He had to look away, the sound was enough as Potter vomited a little longer.
He climbed quickly out of the vehicle, dropping to his unsteady feet. Solid ground, thank Salazar. Draco could kiss it: gravel, chippings, and all.
“Well, Kingsley reckons he’s still popular enough to get voted in,” Potter said, fumbling with the napkin in front of him. “I think he could be the change the Ministry needs, don’t you?”
Draco raised his complaints once they’d found one another at the minibus. The sun was setting once again and it was simple reminder of another day passing and nothing to show for it.
“Hermione caught me, this morning, leaving your room,” Harry said awkwardly, his hand rising to rub at his neck. His bicep tensed as he did so, and Draco noted how attractive that single move was. Harry as a whole was ridiculously attractive. “Thought you should know-- I, er, know how you might feel about that.”
Draco repeated.
The glass was empty within ten minutes and another was poured, swirled, and drank. Draco slid into his bed sheets a little later, sufficiently numb, avoiding the prospect of the upcoming week. Sleep came in waves of distorted dreams and broken hearts.
“I’m only saying… I’d wager that Saviour title gives you certain privileges, slacking on the job for instance. Kingsley loves to use you as his little useless, shining poster boy.”
“No!” Draco strode across the room and knocked the pan out of Fletcher’s clutches. “I can cook tonight.”
Prompted by another shout from Fletcher inside the van, Draco turned away and headed for the front seat. Potter’s seat dipped beside him and Fletcher was buckled in behind them, some muggle magazine gripping her attention.
Draco nodded slowly, a frown pushing through. “I wasn’t sure it would do anything, but I can already feel… a change – that must count for something.”
Potter’s eyes flicked between them as Fletcher subsequently suggested a light-hearted bet instead. Draco would get his precious fancy dinner and Fletcher would be given a single secret if he failed in his task – in his
He woke at dawn, the light streaming in from the tall windows, pushing past Draco’s eyelids to rouse him. Draco shuffled, trying to evade the inevitable call of consciousness. He gave up after another minute and peeled his eyes open. Everything was glowing a soft shade of yellow. Draco blinked. He looked across the couch and immediately caught Potter’s eyes.
“No harm in turning up early, let’s head in,” Potter said, striding forward and upward, his arms swinging with dramatic flair.
Potter meant nothing to him.
? We can help each other.”
“Hang on,” He replied, yanking the map out of his pocket and flipping it open. Upon the image of Great Britain, a cluster of red dots blinked in the south of Devon, except for the missing two. In their place, red dots flashed somewhere between Manchester and Nottingham. “They’re in the Peak District? Somewhere in the north.”
Potter lifted his arm, extending a finger to point at the spot. “That’s where I died.”
There was that smile again. “Well, not quite
“Yes,” He answered easily, glancing over his shoulder for the nurse, and dropped his voice to whisper, “The curse they placed upon Mr Griffin, assuming it was the cult, we can figure it out now.”
Fletcher and he shared an uncertain look before they followed Potter’s lead.
That was the last he heard from Potter that night.
Not even Draco, in his efforts to punish himself for his past mistakes when other people stopped, put himself through the draining cruelty of working overtime more than twice a week. He left at 5 pm on the dot every other day, catching up with Fletcher as they left for the apparition point together, and didn’t cast a glance at Potter.
The glares followed him silently as Harry and him made their way to the stairs, climbing until they reached Draco’s room. The door opened with a familiar creak, Harry falling backwards onto it as it closed behind them.
“Draco?” He said softly and Draco didn’t know how he’d lasted two weeks without the sound of Potter’s voice. He had taken his glasses off, his gaze fixed on Draco’s arm. “You’d make an excellent pillow.”
Then, Potter unveiled himself, his ridiculous invisibility cloak falling to the floor. Draco rolled his eyes, because Potter was juggling four shopping bags and a further crate of some sort of orange juice in his arms.
Pansy shifted in her seat, uncomfortable. “What on earth were you thinking, Draco?”
“Juniper?” Draco’s exchange of sarcastic looks with his favourite colleague was cut off as Potter approached her, a wave of admirers physically restraining themselves from following. “Kingsley wants a word on Case 341.”
Draco wasn’t scared of a ridiculous muggle invention. So, he squeezed the pump until it refused to inject any more fuel and plugged it clumsily back onto the column, staring wide-eyed at the three other pumps that resided there. Closing the compartment was far more difficult to figure out. After eventually screwing the interior cap back into place, or so Draco hoped, he slapped the exterior flap shut. If all went well, the vehicle wouldn’t combust halfway home.
They split for classes with the rest of the school, Draco walking ahead with Pansy. He felt a hand squeeze his shoulder but by the time he turned, Potter was veering in a different direction with Hermione on his arm.
She accompanied him to Kings Cross at the end of the holidays, stopping at the entrance to kiss his cheeks and pull him into her arms. She smiled apologetically as he headed in alone, looking back. Pansy filled in for her absence, slipping into stride beside him.
“You two have a strange friendship…” Potter said, swinging his attention back to the camp. He didn’t look back when Fletcher and Draco began swatting one another, all in jest of course – aside from the one slap that would most certainly bruise on Draco’s arm.
Potter was on his feet, his wand pointed at Draco. There was a fire burning in his eyes. “Give me one good reason why you deserve the redemption I gave you?”
There was a residue of magic that floated around the property; it must be the kind that recycled itself over and over in a desperate wait for the rightful owners to return. Harry was hardly the person the magic was expecting but it greeted him like an old friend. As he stared up at the property, a large gust of wind blew through the courtyard. It propped up tired tree spines, cleared the excess moss from the house’s exterior and rattled the windows in greeting.
“Harry?”
“Have you checked whether ley lines cross under the forests?” Potter asked, his voice so close that a breath seemed to graze Draco’s cheek. That wasn’t the only thing that made him pause.
Fortunately, the window into the room was discrete enough that the interviewee wouldn’t notice them peering through. So, Draco stood there, Fletcher on his left, and they watched as Potter tentatively greeted Arthur Griffin, offering a kind smile.
Potter shook his head slowly.
He shrugged. “A minibus. Ready to go?”
“Excuse me?” Draco swung his eyes to Potter. He didn’t know what Potter’s intentions were, he didn’t have a clue, and that terrified him.
“Juniper…” Potter looked up from his own bowl. “I really don’t give a shit about your language.”
Draco smirked, “I’ve been waiting for this.”
She Disapparated with a crack.
Fletcher shrugged and gave in. “All right, it was only a suggestion…”
Fletcher’s case was admittedly helped by the innocence she expressed while she slept. But Draco had been known to fall for her devilishly laid schemes before. He never fully understood why she hadn’t been sorted in Slytherin, she’d have been an excellent mentor.
Then, the guests offered their goodbyes and condolences, walking the long circuit around Narcissa’s various portraits and keepsakes to Draco. He received each with a strong handshake or gentle bow. He would not cave.
“Morning,” He offered as a greeting, eyes flickering up at Draco then falling.
Draco cleared his throat. His father would disapprove of the desperation in his voice.
Draco wasn’t ready to admit it quite yet, the happy realisation that sat upon his chest and his heart. Yet, he knew.
, and blinked. “—nice that there’s one person who’s only mildly happy to work there.”
“I’m Ares.” The man shook his hand giddily, the years on his worn face draining away. “Hello,
“These runes were on the tree. Do you recognise the script?” Draco asked, handing over the evidence. “It’s rather strange for them to be carved into a single tree. Magic rituals typically involve a specifically outlined area, where the incantation takes place.”
“Reckon that’s them?”
“It’s nothing,” Draco replied swiftly. He lifted the blanket off himself and rose to a stand, bare feet against freezing stone. Harry rolled his head back, slipping to the edge of sleep once more. “I’m going to my room.”
“Sorry I’m late! Traffic was a nightmare getting out of central London!”
Potter strode at the other side, peering through the woods, while Draco and Fletcher walked together, elbowing each other into passing bushes each time the opportunity arose.
There wasn’t much chance to protest once they reached the riverbank, Potter grabbed their forearms and side-apparated them back to the minibus.
He pushed the portkey back to Potter’s chest and shook his head. “I’ll… I will accompany you in the minibus.”
“Thanks, Juniper. Did you buy any snacks? I’d kill for a chocolate bar right now.” Potter said, meeting Draco’s eyes at precisely the inappropriate time and yanking his gaze away.
They apparated to the stream – thankfully, it was Fletcher who took initiative and side-alonged both of them. Draco couldn’t bear Potter’s touch today. His face was warm enough as it was without the hot touch. Fletcher’s hand was deathly cold.
“Thanks, Harry
Potter smiled slightly, lifting the left side of his lips upwards. Draco smiled slightly in return. Then, Potter was gone, the door sliding closed behind him. The carriage was buzzing with noise and Pansy was prodding him on the shoulder, presumably to show him the latest line of ballgowns as though Draco held the mildest of interests, but he was preoccupied with a stark thought.
Then, Potter smiled that stupid smile and the day began again.
Draco looked back, finding friendliness where it had never existed a few weeks ago, and felt his lips twitch upwards.
Either way, the man - the wizarding world’s saviour - had all but moved in during the workweek.
Obviously, Draco tactically wormed his way out of answering for two reasons. Firstly, Potter didn’t have the right to such an admission and, secondly, Draco would have to confess the truth to himself before he could even try.
“Last chance,” Harry hummed and the blanket was lifting itself off the back of the couch, unfolding itself in the air. Draco cast a short glance at it and laid beside Harry in time for the blanket to cover them both. Harry wiggled in place, his shoulder sinking into the cushions. “So, how was your day?”
of sitting beside the Great Harry Potter, Draco noticed he had gained a significant social advantage when far fewer glares were tossed in his direction. The gazes shifted, instead, to Potter warily or with delight.
Well, Fletcher and Draco met on time, standing like idiots outside the building, Potter was nowhere to be seen.
The war had created fucked up versions of everybody.
By the time that the sun hung low in the sky, the three of them agreed to give up for the day. It was growing dark and with limited visibility, Potter explained, they were open to attack. It was too risky. Potter said that a lot – always going on about risk, as though he didn’t spend an entire war making stupidly risky decisions that relied entirely on luck being on his side. It had been, of course. Because he was Harry fucking Potter, the boy extraordinaire.
1. The case revolves around a group of dangerous individuals, labelled as a cult. This also involves individuals who suffer from a neurological disorder, which affects their intellectual functioning. Note that there are no graphic descriptions, but please be warned if this may affect you.
.” Said Harry.
Potter appeared another ten minutes later, evidently having attending that briefing with Kingsley. Dark rings hung below his eyes as he hesitated in the doorway, clearly taking the time to fix a bright smile to his lips, before he stepped through, rowdily greeting some of his closer co-workers.
Potter nodded but turned back to the forest. And it wasn’t Draco’s business, it wasn’t in Draco’s capacity to care, so he left.
With quiet steps, Draco walked closer until his chest met Harry’s back and he could wrap his arms around Harry’s shoulders. And as the garden sprung into its full glory, a small water fountain uncovering itself in the very rear, Harry fell back into Draco’s hold. A small set of quidditch hoops were uncloaked, looking worse for wear. Harry seemed to falter, before his chest resumed its normal rise and fall.
“I’m never going to be this perfect partner that you expect, that the whole fucking world expects. I’m a bloody Malfoy, and you! You’re the golden boy.” Draco yelled, “That’s our destiny, not some star-crossed love bound to fail! When this is all over, I won’t be any more than a page in the record-breaking, sold-out biography of the Boy Who Lived.”
Harry, his head tilted back to rest against Draco’s collarbone, was alternating between watching Draco’s face, his sharp jawline and high cheekbones and pouted lips and shining eyes, to examining Draco’s body, with all its curves and skinny ankles and gentle creases. Because in moments like these, it was all Harry’s brain could do not to chant a lovesick chorus of
Potter joined him on the couch that night. His hair was messy and rugged and he had tired eyes. His jawline was sharp and his cheeks were soft, which Draco learnt as Potter laid down and rested his head on Draco’s thigh. Once again, Draco didn’t move a muscle. He stared down at the man resting on him.
The minutes ticked by, morphing into an hour and then another. They stopped at another ‘services’ for a toilet trip, but Draco stayed put. The last thing he needed was to spend a minute too long in the toilet and discover they’d left him behind. He could perfectly imagine Potter’s gleeful expression as they left him in the dust.
So, he emerged from the bathroom and waited for them to eat, to change, and get a move on. He slipped a banana and an apple, that Potter had acquired from a questionable source, into his pocket as they left to continue their investigation.
She dropped him off at 10 am, leaving him to stare up at a quaint building. The stairs were a steep climb and the reception was unimpressive and rickety, only a high, circular desk separating him from an ancient witch hunched on a stool. Her glasses were perched on the very tip of her nose, her wrinkles extended from the corner of her eyes to every inch of her face and her hair sat on the top of her head in a messy slob. He introduced himself and signed a disclaimer at her command, thanking her politely as he strode two paces to the trio of seats opposite. They all sank willingly at his presence.
His hand fell back to his side as he heard footsteps draw closer outside, crunching through the gravel. The steps paused at the open door, before tentatively walking across the threshold, heels knocking floorboards.
Potter enlarged the map and they both squinted at it, trying to memorise the exact location – give or take 150 yards. As per his previous suggestion, Draco strained his mind trying to recall whether any ley lines ran through the Peak District. It was a large enough area; it was entirely possible. The Dartmoor forest likely overlapped with the St Michael’s line or at least was positioned within a close enough distance to fit into this working theory. Draco had no idea whether Hargate Forest fit.
He followed as they entered a grand pub, three stories high, old brickwork outlining its name. Although, Draco didn’t pay much attention, too distracted by Potter flagging down a drifting waiter to notice the refined details of the establishment. He swung a cursory glance around as they were seated at a plain square table near the back, propped beside a framed map of London.
Draco brushed off the dirt pressed into the fabric of his clothes, lifted his chin high and returned to his life for the evening.
Potter pulled out the printed photos of the cult members, laying them out of the floor between them, and asked another question. He had a kind look in his eyes, a patience that Draco was coming to recognise. Then a flash of disappointment as Griffin shook his head quickly.
(See the end of the chapter for
They reached a clearing after a few minutes, Draco hot on Potter’s heels – so much so that he almost crashed into Potter, slamming on the brakes. Potter looked around until his gaze settled on a particular, uninteresting spot of the ground. It was no different than the rest of this miserable forest. Although, it was particularly chilly here.
Fletcher pulled the side door open with a clunk and hurried inside.
“How big of a promotion?” Draco answered with a question. He didn’t pay much mind to the department’s rumour mill, but he usually didn’t miss the larger, more notable whispers.
“Take your time. Your mother insisted on a full two hours, she was quite particular, I recall.” Ms Bixley encouraged him forward with a brief lift of her eyebrows. It reminded Draco of Potter. “I’d suggest starting with whatever comes to mind.”
Not much better, albeit less sarcastic.
” Draco began, clearing his throat midway. “It was all nonsense, of course. I wanted to ensure this wouldn’t cause any trouble, um, going forward with this case…”
“Is it my turn now?” Potter said, his voice hoarse and rough and nothing like Draco had heard before. It was unfamiliar and familiar, carving out the words as though they were always fated to be spoke.
can be hidden from the eyes of the media and the courts when you contribute to the deaths of thousands of people.” He said, folding his arms and staring out of the window. Perhaps the darkness would calm him.
Potter sighed and fully turned so that he faced Draco, his knees tucked beneath his chin and his eyes bright despite the darkness. Forever bright. He took a moment to think and nothing filled the space between them. Draco looked into those eyes and didn’t think twice before imitating Potter’s position.
“Oh no. I’m sitting in the front. I don’t trust you to operate this ghastly machine without supervision.”
, but I don’t have a schoolgirl crush on her.” Fletcher argued back, her eyebrows knitted together. “You don’t know shit, Draco – oh, sorry, Harry. I’ll watch my language.”
They walked the corridor without a word, lost in their own thoughts. Fletcher, the Ravenclaw of the pair, was undoubtedly already running through the case facts in her mind – slotting the puzzle pieces together as though it was a two by two jigsaw. Draco, meanwhile, was forecasting everything that would push Potter’s and his strained civility to its limitations. Seeing each other before the first coffee of the day, for instance, could derail the previous five years of seemingly neutral ground they’d found.
It turned to chuckling as a pair of second-years scurried past clutching textbooks and sharing high-pitched giggles. Harry Potter and his ex-Death Eater boyfriend was hardly new gossip but the mention of sex might be enough to put them over the edge. Rita Skeeter’s unpaid intern would be banging at his dorm door before he knew it.
Draco folded his arms, shifting against the seatbelt. “You didn’t answer my question.”
It had been followed by the flipping of the
Draco blinked. “You can’t always get what you want.” He said simply, calmly, and rolled his eyes. He was rather sick of people thinking they could find the
“Sleep, Potter,” Draco said in warning, though Harry was uninfluenced by the most venomous of looks. Draco realised he’d probably been on the other end of worse, far worse.
Although, as Draco watched the pair of them walk a few feet closer to the camp, his eyes came to settle on Potter’s arse and he didn’t particularly mind.
“I’d wager so.” Said Draco, returning his answer in a low whisper too. “But why here? What’s so special about these two forests?”
They Disapparated together with a quiet crack.
Potter stood up, brushing his jeans quickly as he did. He rested against the trunk, if only for a second,  long enough for Draco’s gaze to skip up his toned body and settle on his glasses.
and they didn’t belong in that dynamic. Draco shouldn’t be seen by others as a friend to Potter.
Harry’s lungs filled with oxygen as he gasped, quietly and sharply. The air turned his surprise into salty tears that welled in his eyes.
“Morning, Miss Fletcher, Mr Malfoy. Come in, come in.”
He didn’t like exposing his back to it. He felt vulnerable and he couldn’t bear it: the familiar feeling of fear that nestled into his heart. He moved away, stepping out of the clearing by a foot’s length. The heavy weight lifted.
“No, I don’t.”
“Nobody is emotionally stable anymore, Draco, haven’t you noticed?” Said Harry sharply. He inhaled and raked a hand through his hair, Draco’s eyes following the movement. “It’s not – well – I’m not trying to change you. I… I only want to
And Draco reluctantly agreed. He had so many questions, too many trains of thought chugging in different directions, not enough time. Without staying late in the office, he’d never work through all of them. But tonight was not the time for wild theorising.
“You can’t change my mind, Hermione. I will continue to choose to be with Draco,” Harry said firmly. “I’m an adult capable of making responsible decisions in his own love-life, remember?”
“Yeah.” Fletcher shivered a fraction, tugging her jacket tighter.
“Before that! And afterwards, as a matter of fact.” She pushed, eyes shining. “You care about Harry. Don’t try to deny it!”
Since Hogwarts - since he met Potter - he’d always exaggerated the truth, twisted reality to his satisfaction. He’d lied before then, of course, he was a Slytherin at heart, but it really started to get out of control when he was trying to bend Potter to his wishes. Back then, in their innocence, it had involved nothing more than humiliation and short-lasting pain, when Draco wanted to be better than him: faster, smarter, happier.
Potter nodded. “Let me know if she needs anything, I can arrange it.”
“Potter,” Draco said, clearing his throat and busying himself with a cup of tea of his own, “I see you survived the night.”
Then, he held on a little tighter, tying together the lust and the like. These came hand in hand with Potter. The sexiness of his saunter and the sparkle of his hungover grin. Another pair to match the world’s natural formation of pairs: lovers, hands, twins, disasters.
He dismissed the fact they were leaving a day early, that he’d miss another two days of work. This
Although, the trees did indeed mark out an obvious shape, as he’d suspected. An equilateral triangle. Perhaps the group didn’t have as much magical ability as Draco had feared.
And after all the time they spent scouring three miles of forest, they found nothing.
Draco still solved the case in a third of the usual time.
Draco quietly prepared the van’s concealment, watching Fletcher munch on her snacks out of the corner of his eye. It took another five minutes to complete the charm and locate any blind spots he’d missed. Potter finished at a similar time, vanishing through the back of the minibus, and shouting through, his voice distant.
Draco knew it was unnatural that they were colleagues, bound by labour contracts to slave away at desks in the same room.
’, that they’ll learn why we must talk about the war and our losses and our weaknesses. I think I agree with her.”
Nothing had changed. The group members were either sleeping or gathered tamely around the fire.
Draco stared at her. Then, he changed the subject. But nothing could stop the train of thought chugging around the back of his mind.
“That’s rather difficult when the saviour of the Wizarding World is so bloody demanding!” Draco whispered back, although he was settling into the situation and made a point of propping up his book on the side cushion.
“Right, Malfoy, because I was under the impression that all dark wizards were deluded followers.” Potter responded quickly, fixing him with an irritated and pointed look.
“Sir.” Draco stood, and bowed his head. Fletcher imitated him, on his tail as they left the room.
? Draco knew how to play the innocent fool, he knew how to feign disinterest. It would be no trouble acting as though nothing had happened. Even still, he had an uncomfortable feeling settling in his stomach. Because Harry made him want to be 99.8% honest, which was an accomplishment for almost any Slytherin.
Draco looked at them hesitantly, he followed the wrinkles and lines with his gaze and then, he slid his hands into Harry’s. He let himself be pulled to his feet. The floor was cold but he followed Harry to the couch. Harry laid down the length as he usually did, tugging on the cushion to act as a makeshift pillow, and patted the strip of sofa that was free. It was tempting, staring down at Harry’s slender body and his wayward hair which perfectly orbited his gorgeous face - anything was tempting when Harry Potter so much as asked.
Perhaps he owed an apology to Sybil Trelawney.
A few nights later, once Pansy had given up on questioning his sanity, Draco continued a routine of his.
Draco never trusted anything Potter touched to be harmless. He had a long list of references to back him up.
A twig snapped behind him and he startled as Potter threw himself bedside Draco, peering around the other side of the boulder.
“My mother will hold you to that promise.” Draco pushed away the amusement that was tugging at the tips of his lips. “This is your last chance to back out.”
“The shops were open,” Potter shrugged under all that weight.
“Here we are,” Potter remarked as he rolled to a stop in a roadside parking bay. He pulled a long lever upwards and the engine fizzed off.
“I… Well, I…” Draco paused and inhaled. He would not waste his mother’s money, the little that she had left. “I had apologised to everybody but
“I’ll explain later,” Fletcher brushed off the question and slung an arm around Draco’s waist, rocking him side to side as they walked. “So, how are you?”
They ate between sentences, Potter gulping down his entire pie in a few bites, scoffing the chips with a guzzle of ketchup and mayonnaise. None of it stopped him nattering, but Draco was surprised to see he had enough table manners not to talk with his mouth full. One of many things to change since their adolescence.
unideal situations.”
“You don’t need to-” Potter was interrupted.
“My name is Margaret Bixley. During our sessions, I will not judge, criticise nor will I reveal any of the information disclosed to the outside world. Everything you say remains in these four walls
isn’t it? You never know what might happen! You’re not awful-looking either, my love.”
Bit by bit they widened their scope with no luck. The group had left almost no trace. There was not a single magical signature that lingered, and their attempted tracking spells couldn’t cling onto the residual for long enough to settle onto a single direction. So, the three of them slumped against a tree stump at midday for a spot of lunch.
Harry hovered over the spread of his body for a moment, lingering, creating a moment of suspense in the air between their almost-bare bodies. His hands were planted on either side of Draco's shoulders. Then he dropped with an
Draco would argue back, he really would, but it would get nasty and Potter was right there, staring at him in a different light. He suddenly wanted to slap the words back into Fletcher’s mouth; it was her fault Potter was looking at Draco like he
Fletcher nodded, but Draco scowled to himself. This would be a much easier technique if they flew…on brooms, in that flying car Weasley had hijacked in second year, even on a stupid hippogriff! But Draco didn’t kick up a fuss under Fletcher’s watchful gaze and stomped off in his designated direction, kicking a few extra tree roots when their inconvenient positioning pissed him off.
Draco scoffed, following Potter’s footsteps with care. “On your collectable card? That’s incredibly reassuring, thank you, Potter.”
“I’m everything they said I would be! How can you stand it? The hatred, the ego, the-“
“Fine.”
“There’s actually a great pub around the corner, do you fancy grabbing a bite to eat?” Potter asked.
They spent far too long browsing the menu. Suspiciously so for Potter who had been adamant on the risotto the entire walk over, less so for Draco who was trying to minimise any small talk they’d inevitably become engaged in. His eyes slipped over the choices of wine another five times before the waiter appeared, notebook in hand, unconvincing smile fixed in place.
That came out relatively articulately; he almost sounded like his father. Or perhaps, he really didn’t.
As a matter of fact, if it wasn’t for Draco catching Fletcher’s equally unimpressed look from across the office in moments like these, he might have lost the will to continue a long time ago. He was a consultant, for Merlin’s sake; he was
Draco’s gaze shot up, away from Potter's thigh and towards his small smile. “Of course not.”
Instead of giving into Draco’s touch in an exposed corridor, Harry turned in his hold. His fingers slipped under Draco’s shirt easily, finding the matching tattoo embedded in Draco’s hip and leaning down to press a long kiss to it. If only to return the favour. If only to watch the way Draco arched towards him, his entire body stretching as his head tipped towards the ceiling with a blissfully sinful moan.
“Are you going to sleep tonight?” Draco asked for some unknown reason.
“I really like you, Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled, finding his fidgeting hands and interlocking their fingers. “If you gave us a real chance, I think you might really like me too.”
He leaned closer, peering into Draco’s face. Draco looked back at him, taking in the messy hair and bright eyes and gentle wrinkles on his face, and didn’t say anything. He could shrug and leave. He could shove Harry away. He wasn’t going to do either.
Draco snorted. He hadn’t had the honour to hear Fletcher’s muttered cursing in her sleep, but she’d told him countless embarrassing stories over their lunchtime coffees.
“My mother pays you so that I can talk about the past,” Draco said, his cheeks flushing a subtle shade of pink. “We are going off-topic.”
The three of them were in the centre of nature, not another person to be seen, and Draco felt like he could breathe.
“Potter?” Draco whispered. His book had fallen into the side of the sofa, sinking into the crevasse with no hope of rescue. It was one of his favourites, but he let it fall. Potter wasn’t reacting. “Hey, Potter! Hey.
Fletcher pulled a chair up next to Potter, and Draco subsequently beside her. The room filled up around them, co-workers taking their seats in a large circle (another of the Ministry’s many post-war initiatives, inspired by the infamous legend of King Arthur). Shacklebolt appeared one minute late, a number of files tucked beneath his arm as he swept in and took the only seat reserved at the head of the room.
“Can I use your shower, Malfoy?” Potter asked after a long sip of tea.
A house that should never have been forgotten was revealing its beauty. Harry was here to make it home once again.
It was those glasses, they were unsuited to the new mature face that their precious saviour had grown into sometime after the war - somewhere in the space of time between saving Draco from an excruciating existence behind cold, unforgiving bars and Draco’s recruitment at the Ministry. Potter really ought to invest in another pair of glasses; maybe then he wouldn’t remind Draco so much of the war-torn kid he saw lying in Hagrid’s arms. Maybe then, he wouldn’t look so chillingly young after all these years.
Potter stayed, and turned up to work the very next day, rings under his eyes and marginally late as he always was. He never failed in this routine. Draco looked across at him now, for a moment, to see the fatigue lining Potter’s features and wondered if every night was spent in that mildly dusty office with no company.
He climbed back into the minibus, carrying the bags over to the kitchen. A flick of his wand lit a couple of lamps, enough to illuminate the kitchen, and another tugged the limited number of cupboards open.
that ability.
“Liar,” Draco muttered under his breath as he pulled his arms tighter against his chest and slumped a little further against his window.
and brought along one of those extendable tents that the vendors in Diagon Alley seemed so persistent to sell to him. ‘The Saviour used our most popular extendable tent in the fight against You Know Who!’ they shouted at Draco as he passed through weekly, ‘Get your highly reviewed tent from Milligan’s, endorsed by the Boy Who Lived himself! Half price for a limited time only!’.
Draco swallowed, seeking the implied meaning behind those chosen words. He failed.
Draco carefully headed back to their spot, remaining hidden in the shadows and edging from one to another. He saw nobody else as he did. The two group members had merely strayed, it seemed.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Are you not going home?”
Potter had taken up residence of the second chair behind the till, left his shoes under the table, and allowed an easy yet tired grin to slip between his shallow dimples. There was something about him - the sparkling eyes, grumbled complaints, the padding of his feet as they followed Draco’s own around the store - that convinced Draco that Potter wasn't the worst company an ex-Death Eater-turned-librarian-slash-bookseller could have.
The first week was a nightmare.
Draco blinked away the fatigue that was provoking his thoughtless actions. “Fine. Second door on the left, although I’m sure you remember that much from last night.”
They found Potter sprawled in there, petting a small tawny owl as it nuzzled into his shoulder. The remarkably domesticated owl pattered its claws in quick succession upon seeing the pair and offered a soft hoot in greeting.
They had forecasted a turbulent love, one that would drown them both and yet offer moments of salvation. A connection that was once in a lifetime.
He looked helpless here, slumped on the floor, hair stuck to his forehead, the toilet seat at his fingers rather than the world. His skin was sickly pale and he was shaking a little bit. Enough to bring Draco’s fingers to his back as he dry-coughed into the bowl.
They watched quietly for a further six minutes as the two cult members completed the carvings and double-checked their work.
Potter appeared at his side. “Your turn.”
house before!”
“God, yeah. Look, I’m sor—I mean, I shouldn’t have turned up here.” Potter said quickly, a hand moving to rub his neck. “Although, I appreciate that you didn’t turn me away when I needed… help.”
Granted, Draco was an idiot for the many, many mistakes he’d made in the past, but Fletcher really took the biscuit. She conveyed a silent apology in the moments that Draco allowed her to catch his gaze. Through the feigned solemness, he still caught sight of a small smile tugging at her lips.
“—come get you…?” When Potter didn’t move, shaking feebly in his crouched position, Draco rolled his eyes. “For Merlin’s sake, let’s get you to a bathroom.”
Draco glanced up from his book and shrugged, “Is that so? I didn’t hear a pause in your endless muttering.”
“Harry.” A voice said gently.
“I don’t know who that is.”
Fletcher dropped a number of silver and gold coins into Potter’s open palm, followed by a white strip of paper with ink printed into it.
Draco tried to concentrate on rifling through his mind, stretching for the mental case file that floated out of his grasp. Something was happening, surely. A niggling feeling in his chest told him that much.
The man was far more senior in age, a head full of thin, greying hair that sat without style or effort, and his body language indicated he was anxious, Draco could tell by the way he kept glancing over his shoulder in anticipation. Perhaps, it was fear. Either way, Mr Griffin was slim, his skin worryingly pale, his face taut and pulled tight. He was dressed in a set of red pyjamas, small images of what appeared to be trains printed from top to bottom, and he was playing with a pair of toy cars on the floor, cross-legged. He was the picture of childlike innocence.
“Are we really, Draco?”
And so, Draco was left with no other choice, not even a blatant excuse coming to mind, and they walked down to the end of the corridor as a three, a natural silence befalling them. Fletcher opened the door as Potter petted the owl a final time and released it down the corridor, trusting it to find its way back to wherever it came from. It soared over disgruntled heads, solemn Monday morning grimaces, its wings flapping.
He hadn’t lied to himself over that one simple fact for years. Perhaps, he’d been brainwashed by the hordes of magazines and newspapers that plastered Potter’s face on every edition, always the same few images (from the single photoshoot Potter had probably been coerced into a couple of years ago) or a grainy picture of Potter leaving a restaurant, or a pub, his hand up to block the lens. The entire country had been convinced he was a perfect person, an incredibly accomplished wizard for his age.
“It seems,” Fletcher piped up, looking between the men, “That it could be a single individual rather than an entire group.”
“I’m already obligated to her, I reckon I can handle a promise,” Potter replied, taking a long sip of his beer, his eyes gazing over the top.
“What the fuck are you doing, Potter?” He hissed, disregarding the fact that nobody could hear them in here.
“No, you don’t,” Harry mumbled. His fingers slid beneath Draco’s shirt, skimming the cold skin and lighting it up. Draco shifted his body automatically, remaining on his back but moving ever so slightly closer to Harry. “Stay with me, please, for a little while. Let’s not leave yet.”
Without another word, Draco was led deeper and deeper into the forest. Distant noises rippled from all angles and amongst the creaking of trees swaying in the breeze. They towered over Draco, sneering at his weak body, at his stumbling. Their roots carried out their bidding, springing up from the ground. Draco raced to catch up from Potter, who walked through the forest as effortlessly as he did everything nowadays.
Draco rolled his eyes and pivoted on the spot, casting a glare at the identical paths that led away from here. “Obviously not.”
Lunch was an interesting and silent ordeal. It involved Draco and Fletcher playing an unfriendly match of tossing glares at each other, punctuated with wary glances at Potter’s expressionless face. In a matter of seconds, in the length of a short conversation, the ease and light contentment Draco had come to expect in the presence of these two particular colleagues had been lost.
There was a short silence, as Shacklebolt mulled over his thoughts and pushed off his desk to pace up and down the width of his office.
He wasn’t sure he liked his own place. In all honesty, Draco had been lucky to find this apartment, the looming shadow of his crimes severely diminishing the options available, but when he had money – if he ever gathered enough money – and a redeemed social status, he would move. He would find a place that truly spoke to him.
Draco looked up from his wine, seeking the implication before he could help himself, but Potter looked earnest,
They were swiftly led and dumped on the doorstep, the nurse waving a little too energetically to be genuine. A small series of steps further and they stood in the shadows of the neighbouring alleyway, hidden from the eyes of passers-by.
. And so, Draco followed his father’s lead and holed up in his own room for most of the day. His gift had been requested by himself in the days prior so there was no remarkable excitement there.
One day turned into a weekend, spiralling into a week bedridden, open-mouthed kisses on firm thighs, until it had been a month, dancing around each other in playful circles, the rest of the world delightfully oblivious.
That, Draco admitted, was a relatively reasonable explanation. They could have, still, stayed at a hotel or found their own accommodations perhaps. Draco himself had been eyeing up a particularly well-rated hotel in the area. The department was covering expenses after all. But it was unfortunately Potter’s call at the end of the day.
“Any volunteers to cook dinner?” Potter asked from over his shoulder as he unpacked a number of files onto the desks.
From the magical signatures they could detect, Draco and Fletcher had managed to pin down each individual’s age to a small range. Besides a couple of nineteen-year olds, the rest were easily in their twenties, thirties, and forties. Yet, when the sun dropped low enough for the routine afternoon nap, the younger (at heart) individuals crawled towards their senior counterparts so they could be wrapped within their arms and held for the duration. There was a form of dependence that Draco couldn’t ignore.
But Potter was climbing back into the driver’s seat before long, wiping his hands on the denim jeans to which he seemed to be emotionally attached.
A cup of tea and an apple later, they were back to venturing through the forest. Fletcher’s theory hadn’t held true yet, but they followed the narrow river that weaved through the land regardless.
“Where did they go? Potter?” Draco turned quickly towards his colleague, likely with a frantic look etched on his face.
“Perhaps not… Potter!” Draco shouted through the woods and the Auror appeared from behind a distant tree with a deep-set frown. “We’ve found something.”
“The crime scene is this way,” Potter said, extending his arm to point across the road with a frown. “Coming, Malfoy?”
Draco almost smiled.
Potter said, “Grab on,” and lifted his arm, offering it out.
“One second.” Harry shoved the rest of the bar into his mouth, cramming it to the brim and chewed in the most undignified way. He nodded and his voice came through muffled as he said, “Ok, let’s go. Three hours remaining.”
As it came to be, they grew to understand each other, to accept what couldn’t be changed and quietly apologise under flaring sunsets.
Potter looked back, eyes widening a fraction. But Fletcher nodded encouragingly, passing her detailed list of questions through the door, and he turned to continue.
So, Draco stumbled down the stairs to the common room a few minutes later than usual. Potter was already there, wrapped in a warm bubble, smiling into the blanket. Draco lowered himself onto his side of the couch. He made a point of opening his book, even though the words all merged into another and taunted him in gibberish.
Pansy narrowed her eyes at him as they entered Potions. She elbowed him as Draco slid onto his usual seat and began purposefully avoiding her pointed glances.
“Did he remember Ares?”
Scratch out Draco’s earlier statement. This might be catastrophic.
Harry picked up his broom that must’ve been thrust to the grass at some point and grasped Draco’s hand with the other, lacing their fingers together.
The stone at his feet seemed to suddenly tilt forward, tossing him forward and through the entrance until he stood in a cosy entryway. There was another door to his left and carpets led the way down a wide corridor towards a strip of light through an ajar door. Stairs sloped upwards on the left and there was a hush of stillness as Harry’s eyes fell upon the frames that rested along the slanted wall.
There Draco went again, lying about the inconvenience.
“I heard my name!” Fletcher said groggily, sitting up with a severe case of bedhead, and scanned the room slowly. “Morning…”
“Hi, Potter,” Draco kissed Harry’s skin, the space between the nook of his neck and the protruding bone of his left shoulder, ever so delicately. “You’re early for once.”
Draco found green eyes. They stared back at him.
“Why would I care about that useless halfwit? He probably can’t even distinguish a standard Chardonnay from a Sauvignon Blanc.” Draco rolled his eyes, although the thought snagged on his mind. It propelled him forward. “I’d bet a few thousand gallons that Potter’s a
“I’ll take your review into consideration.” He said, rotating to face his window.
“You recorded the entire thing, right?” Fletcher held out her hand, palm facing up, to Potter and waggled her fingers.
“Draco.”
“Do we know whether they’re living in the forest?” Draco asked, drawing a line across his parchment to begin a new section of notes. “If not, these wizards and witches could be within wizarding society, or indeed the Ministry.”
Right, yes. Draco shouldn’t have thought any different.
Potter didn’t say anything the following night either, or the night after or the night after that. He didn’t seem to bother trying to communicate with Draco anymore. He acknowledged Draco’s existence in class and caught his eye every once in a while, but nothing more. Words were becoming an unfamiliar terrain between the pair. Draco wouldn’t even mind if it was his surname that was said, anything to resolve this uncomfortable limbo. He didn’t say anything either. Although, one night, he fetched Potter’s blanket on his way to the couch and left it at the other side of the sofa.
Potter who remained on the sofa, lost to the world.
Unfortunately, Potter didn’t receive the memo. He wandered in a few minutes later, clutching a cupcake, and sat down at the desk opposite. He ate through a smile, eyes to the ceiling.
His wish came true when Shacklebolt concluded the meeting early with a weary, “Any questions?” On this fateful Monday morning, nobody did, and Draco was gone before Fletcher could even turn to look for him.
to be mine, and I, yours. Suck it up.”
But this is what their adequate salaries were designated for: reading, researching, advising and never, ever, getting their hands dirty again.
have for such childish clothes? Draco would rather a slow and painful death than give up his silky, black pyjama sets. Perhaps Potter ought to invest in a pair... His mouth ran dry at the thought of Harry wearing them, the hems riding up to reveal soft, pale skin and—
If only they’d attended the crime scene in the first few days following the incident. Why hadn’t they attended the crime scene earlier?
As they explored each other’s bodies in the back room, Draco walking Potter against an overflowing bookshelf, the world seemed to still. He found the dips in Potter’s hips and the Adam’s apple in his throat and the sharp inhales when his hands dropped much lower. There, bodies pressed against pointy book spines, came the moment from all the modern fiction stories he’d been reading - a wash of emotion, an animalistic need to please, coated in a chant of
“This doesn’t mean anything,” Draco said, promptly following Potter as he set off in a slow walk upon the response. He caught up in a manner of seconds. “I’m simply curious.”
Then, Harry disappeared through the same entrance that they’d entered. Draco grabbed the air where he’d been a moment before. His dejected hand flew to his lips, tracing the imprint of pink lips on his. He caught his breath.
“Weasley is highly predictable, I wouldn’t be surprised if he got her a tacky necklace and an exam planner,” Draco said, watching the quidditch field as it drew closer and closer.
And then they were off.
“You…what?” Draco uttered, barely above a mutter.
Potter noticed. He raised an eyebrow. “Ron snores,” he said.
“You’re a star, Juniper. Thanks.”
“Why?” When no response came, he found Potter’s gaze jumping between the grey concrete ahead and Draco. Shadows slipped over Potter’s face, arching his brow then his lips, painting his features in darkness. “Well?”
“Mr Malfoy?”
Draco saw clearly through it all, he saw Potter’s flaws, and Potter was still hot.
“No, our police agent specifically noted that there were multiple magical signatures.” Potter said, dragging his hands down his face. “They couldn’t be sure, but there were at least ten or fifteen. This could be a mere branch of the larger organisation too.”
“Yes,” Draco said, discarding his tea and straightening out his tie. “I’m coming.”
A table between them, Potter’s eyes on Draco, a scar that no longer drew his gaze upward.
“Do I get anything in return?” Draco pushed.
reason). He stepped forward, his fingers lifting to cup Draco’s jaw and trace the bags beneath his eyes. “You look exhausted during our classes.”
“Do you like your job, Malfoy?”
His wand fell limp in his hand, and he exhaled.
“These runes – Draco and I have found them on two trees in the area.” Fletcher explained, her fingers tracing the symbols. “There must be more somewhere. It would suggest the group had prepared some sort of ancient warding system, maybe to hide them from passers-by.”
“Oh Lord, don’t use my first name,” She narrowed her eyes momentarily to ensure Draco captured her aggression.
Potter sighed. “Will we ever?”
Harry stirred.
As Draco changed into his flying gear (pretty darn fast, urgently tugging the tight fabrics until they melded to his body), he mulled over Harry’s suggestion.
“Hey, don’t you dare assume-“
Draco disappeared to grab a glass of water, as Potter spread his forearms across the toilet seat and laid against it.
He didn’t seem to consider that they could travel back separately, now that there weren’t any reasons to stick together, no convenient cloaks or mysterious suspects. Then again, Potter didn’t think things through; he lived in a world of impulsive decisions. Draco was willing to let him as he grabbed Potter’s arm and stepped into his world for a moment, the world that was thrilling and unexpected and submerged them in darkness.
Draco woke at sunrise and Harry stirred in the subsequent minutes. His hand was on Draco’s hip, his touch warm and solid and light. It was everything that Draco had never known. He daren’t move, not until Harry opened his eyes blearily and found Draco looking back at him.
Harry had said, “But I’d like to think I was right.”
“Does this mean I can make weekend plans going forth?” Draco asked lightly, he might have even described it as a teasing tone.
“Hey, Juniper. Can you go pay?” Potter asked, holding a few flaps of thin paper over his shoulder. “It’s pump number five. You can grab some snacks if you like. Oh, and remember to grab the receipt!”
Draco shook his head mutely.
Stay safe,
Fletcher was relentless, nudging him eagerly. She had a grand conspiracy concocting inside her overactive imagination. Those were excellent for solving cases, but Draco had heard her track record for fucking up her personal life with false deductions. He would prefer not to be on the receiving end. Those situations often became… messy.
“Certainly more than I used to.” He answered, wary of where his words may land him. Potter’s perception of him seemed to be continuously fluctuating, and Draco was the only one who could steer it vaguely in the right direction.
They strode through the forest again, in the same silence, and Draco had the same unnerved feeling as before. He kept his eyes strictly on the ground, avoiding the forest’s attempts to bring him to his knees. Potter said nothing. They reached the castle grounds in half the time.
“Hey, stop –Macmillan will see you!” Draco hissed urgently, grabbing Harry’s wrist to hold him in place, and he froze, listening to any signs of life.
Unexpectedly, Potter chuckled under his breath and looked towards the minibus, as though to search for a familiar mane of hair. Fletcher didn’t emerge with a crazy grin, but Draco almost expected her to. He wouldn’t mind her arms wrapping around him, despite any protests he might feign, and Fletcher squeezing him tight, exactly how he hugged his mother. Was that a sign of love?
“Are we expected to pay you back for your troubles?” Draco asked quietly, a snarky tone underlining his words.
The wizard and witch were almost two-hundred yards to the south, split between two different trees, carrying out the same tasks as before. From the shadows, Potter and Draco observed in silence.
The liquid tasted good as it washed down Draco’s throat and soothed his itchy throat. A fruity flavour swirled around his taste buds for a moment before he took another swig and turned back to Potter with a nod of approval. There certainly wasn’t an overwhelming taste of any popular poisons at least.
Perhaps, he should tackle his little lying issue.
“I want you, Harry,” Draco uttered quietly. He was a step away from Harry’s innocently unsuspecting expression when he repeated it more firmly. “I want you, Harry Potter. And I’ll be damned if I don’t get you.”
Now, it was a different story. Or rather a realisation of Trelawney’s prophecy.
“I’m here, I’ve got you, okay? Let it all out.” Came the distant voice and warm touch, “You can hold onto me.”
Draco graciously accepted the tea without a word.
The darkness flocked the streets after half an hour of driving, except for the tall lamps that dangled above and the almost-blinding lights that shone out of other vehicles. Fletcher hadn’t made an awful choice with the music, likely taking Draco’s preferences into consideration when she chose the radio station, even if it kept repeating its name. BBC Radio 2 was hardly the worst, it didn’t have any excessively loud or inappropriate music for a Sunday evening and maintained the calm atmosphere he’d been seeking. So, Draco didn’t voice any complaints.
“Good.” She replied, sticking her tongue out at Draco before she disappeared back into the pages of her obsession.
On Thursday night, Potter beat him to the couch. It was two days until the Christmas holidays and Draco had admittedly fallen asleep in his bed for a few hours, who could blame him after an entire day of NEWTs preparation? He’d risen earlier in the morning too, in order to squeeze in a couple of extra hours in the library. Pansy had met him there, looking equally worse for wear, and they’d crawled through the regret and the textbooks until Breakfast.
Draco fell back into his own.
Draco didn’t say anything as they took the next exit off the road and slowed to a crawl, slotting into a space beside a tall column of coloured advertisements and warnings. The door creaked open and Potter dropped to the floor. With his hand still on the door, he looked over his shoulder and asked another question.
“Just give me another hour of peace. All right?” Potter’s voice was faint, weary and got lost on its way to Draco.
, occasionally followed with a harmonious encore of
It was slower, unapologetic, not so frantic. He’d have plenty of time to kiss Harry. So, he pulled their bodies closer together, pressing into Harry’s mouth with patience and expertise, craving the moment he’d get to unravel Harry into less than the panting mess he was already. He drew away gently.
The sunlight being fed through the tiny window up above illuminated Draco’s pale skin, offering glimmers of canary yellow against white: short-lived flickers of colour that danced up Draco’s body before vanishing into the grey abyss of stone.
He pressed against Draco until he could practically feel the soul mark against his body, and he guided one of Draco’s lazy hands to his own forearm, where sure enough his skin was ignited by a grazing touch.
They watched as the two people did indeed carve into the bark of another two trees, after standing around for a while and completing measurement spells to ensure they formed a perfect equilateral triangle. The moment they finished the final rune on the third tree, the atmosphere changed.
and that was hardly any use in a world where plenty of Dark Lord supporters were still hiding in the shadows.
“150 to be safe?” Potter looked up at his hesitance, waiting for a response.
If it wasn’t for his bitter case of pride, Draco would thank Potter himself for exiling him from the office. There were too many adoring gazes for a Tuesday afternoon and Draco’s patience had already been reduced to the strength of a Phoenix feather when the new mail owl had knocked his coffee mug over three times (in the span of ten minutes!). The blasted things had only returned as a temporary measure during the Ministry reformation, but it looked like they were sticking around for a while longer.
Fletcher and Draco shared a brief, amused look and followed. The office was shiny and well-polished, only the carpet muddy from the many pairs of boots that must have stomped through. There were a set of chairs by the door, a stack of typical magazines piled on the adjacent table, and a large desk at the opposite end of the room. Two women were sat behind it, flicking their wands to sort the mail and files from one pile to another.
Harry found him by the exit once Granger and Weasley had made their swift exit. He took Draco by the elbow, a subtle touch that rooted him to the earth.
Perhaps it was symbolic, the exact positioning of his soul mark. His left arm was where the black ink was engraved into Harry’s core, slap bang in the centre of his forearm - mirroring the unnatural mark that was carved into Draco’s own left arm, the one they tended not to talk about.
“At least the sex will be brilliant,” Harry grinned.
“I thought you were supposed to be the connoisseur of small talk, Draco – coming from an
The wards hummed in a sudden alert, whispering its message down Harry’s spine. He blinked and loosened the wards, changing the property's access settings with a distracted jerk of his wand.
“Here you go.” Fletcher passed over something wrapped in coloured plastic and nudged Draco with another. “I wasn’t sure what you’d like, so I went with the safe bet.”
The air was amicable, much alike a departmental trip to the pub – not that Draco ever attended those events, so it wasn’t a fair comparison – but they cleared away the mess once they’d eaten and settled in their own individual areas with far more contentment then he’d expected. Fletcher and he wrote up their notes in comfortable silence besides one another, leaning across their desks to examine the runic symbols and correctly copy them down. Potter was on the couch, his boots abandoned and his socked feet kicked over the arm, reading through a file at a slow pace. Although, he frequently took breaks to stare blankly into the flame of the nearest lamp.
“Hey, Potter – don’t ignore—"
Fletcher rose from her chair and nodded. “Sure, I’ll head to his office now.”
“What did she do during the war?” asked Potter, “What side—er, where was she?”
And Potter became something else in Draco's eyes - more than the annoying boy he once knew, yet not quite a man - and the world continued spinning.
” He hissed under his breath, before snapping, “Shut the fuck up, Fletcher. Put your childish delusions to bed and focus on your job.”
It wasn’t an overcomplicated case, although cults were never simple. They were interwoven with complex theologies and ties of loyalty. They could be dark, they could be harmless. The Dartmoor Forest case seemed to be anything but.
The hours ticked by and Potter grew restless. He was acting like an agitated fool, as though he had to be moving at all times. Draco held his tongue for the sake of the case, although he noticed Fletcher was eyeing the fidgeting too.
Shockingly, there was nothing for two miles and Draco’s heart sunk, realising perhaps they should have headed upstream instead. There was no point turning back now.
Fletcher and Draco were well-acquainted with the gruelling task of trawling through dozens and dozens of books in sought of a single scrap of information; they’d spent many a long night searching for a hint of a lead in ancient texts, only for it to be a dead end.
Malfoy not so discretely yanked the belt and inelegantly smashed it against the red mechanism until he heard a click.
Fletcher fell asleep around about the time they passed Yeovil, her copy of the magazine slumped against her chest. She looked innocent, like that. Hardly capable of a complex deterioration curse. Then again, Draco supposed even the Dark Lord would look harmless when he slept – did the creature even sleep? For a long year, it seemed like he never stopped to rest, never needed rest, not until the last hours of his second life.
Another week passed. Potter even slept here on the weekends. And those muggle pyjamas seemed to be a favourite of his, too often matched with a hideous pair of woolly socks. They certainly made it easier for Potter to sneak up on Draco before he slung himself over the back of the sofa. Not to mention, Potter was appearing earlier and earlier too.
Draco stood on the roadside, clutching his bag in one hand and the portkey in the other. He watched as Potter sloppily pulled out into the road, lugging the big car out of the big dip he’d parked in. Dust was sprayed up at Draco as they left, the mechanical contraption was all he could see of his co-workers as they grew into a tiny dot in the distance.
“Yes?”
“This is a surprise. Saint Potter offering his unskilled help...” Draco responded, yet there was no bite in his tired tone. He exhaled heavily and gestured to the small dining area, “You can set the table.”
Green eyes moved to meet his and Draco cleared his throat, looking away.
It was an ordinary week. The Tuesday Blues hit the office hard, but the intern brought a cake to lift the mood. Draco didn’t steal a slice until everybody else had left for the day. Perhaps the cleaning lady had caught him with an inelegant mouthful of the crumbly cake in the moments after, but it was surprisingly good and he didn’t care.
(See the end of the chapter for
Nowadays, the criminals were beginning to outsmart his quick-thinking. That was where Fletcher came in handy. She was as sharp as Draco, equally critical, and perhaps more analytical too. She was the fourth consultant that Draco had seen float in and out of her position since he began, but she was the current record holder – none of her predecessors had lasted half as long.
Fletcher and Draco carried out some diagnostic spells, trying to analyse the exact magic used. Little success. The only category they could place the magic remnants under was
Fletcher took that moment to smirk, tipping her head in Draco’s direction. He narrowed his eyes, not grasping her implication, but raised an eyebrow challengingly anyway.
Potter retched again, his fingers squeezing the edge of the circular pot rim.
He quickly followed behind Fletcher as they crossed the road and ambled into the thick forest that met them on the road’s edge. Potter trudged straight into it as though it was his day job – actually, Draco supposed it was. Unless the Aurors were privileged to be under Draco’s guidance, they often wandered into the unknown and got themselves hurt. Potter seemed to have the worst track record of them all.
Fletcher caught his eye and sniggered, but Potter only rolled his eyes, not rising to the dangling bait.
“We should visit the crime scene. The police have removed all their evidence and it’s no longer under observation. So, we should go and scope out the place.” Potter said, shedding his outer robes on his chair before he settled into it, kicking his legs onto the corner of his desk.
Draco said nothing. He didn’t move his gaze from the spot on the ground that oozed dark magic. It was stained with the imprint of death. He didn’t want to be here. He didn’t know how Potter could stand it.
Perhaps, he did catch Potter’s voice calling out two words, “Goodnight, Draco.”
It was Fletcher who drew the short straw and it was safe to say, when they settled down to eat half an hour later, that she was potentially the best cook out of a bad bunch. Draco chewed through the slightly uncooked pasta and smiled half-heartedly at Fletcher’s expectant look.
It was a simple enough ordeal to order a glass of house wine - red, obviously - and the haddock. Potter ducked out of the risotto, instead opting for steak pie and a pint of beer. The menus were taken.
Draco huffed and returned to the tree trunk he’d been examining. There were runes carved into the bottom, looped in circles around the tree, and they looked familiar. He couldn’t quite place them, they drifted meaninglessly around his mind, seeking their rightful home.
The emotions from the conversation before died in a quick descent. Although, Harry was saying something, what it was Draco could not be certain.
Draco had to stop himself from laughing and instead, shoved a mouthful of dry pasta into his mouth to chew through the amusement. Potter looked on the edge of laughter himself, a small smile playing on his lips as he shifted his food around the bowl.
Fletcher shared an unimpressed look with Draco, one that had brimming on the surface. Neither of them ever had much opportunity to swipe at Potter’s ego in the office, given he was almost always surrounded by a wall of adoring fans (known as passive-aggressive colleagues to them). Perhaps Fletcher wouldn’t dare, not to his face, but Draco had years of high-school bullying under his belt and nothing left to lose.
He did.
Draco looked at Harry, his face not far from his own. There was something simultaneously charming and surreal about this situation. Harry’s eyes were bright in this lightless box, and Draco smiled at him. “I suppose I can live with that.”
Onto the carpet, the two men sunk. Potter chose another car, it was a bold shade of red and had a marked stripe of white across its front – very fitting. He paused, looking down at the toy. Griffin nudged his lorry against Potter’s, a symbol of friendship, and then, they were pushing them alongside one another. The pair created a small racetrack around their bodies, the toys pushed enthusiastically around it.
“Do you sleep, Potter?” Draco drawled, relishing in the way Potter’s head whipped around at the unexpected sound.
“It’s hard to ignore a man dead on his feet,” He responded, letting his gaze settle for a moment too long on Potter.
trip? You were rather adamant that was made clear last week.”
“I’m certain you’ve spent it on worse.” Draco rolled his eyes. “But no, you have an Auror’s salary, you can afford a meal for two.”
There was something about Potter’s sleep schedule that bothered him. To be fair, if their accompanying Auror was severely sleep-deprived, they did face a much higher likelihood of being violently murdered. Draco was only bothered about the brutal torture that might precede their unfortunate deaths.
“Mhm,” Harry replied, snuggling against Draco, settling between his legs. He yawned. “Something along those lines, I’m sure the Hogwarts rumour mill can answer that question for you.”
They did check the carvings. Draco took another sample from the eastern point of the triangle, probably breaking whatever incantation they had tied into the bark, but it didn’t prove itself immediately dangerous. The pattern of runes looked identical to the previous samples, no surprise there.
“Do you not like your name?” Potter asked, his stance shifting into a something subtly more nervous.
Draco the bully from school had become Draco the agitator, Draco the gaslighter. His temper was far better managed than his younger years, but Harry’s temperament was excellent in comparison. He’d become far more level-headed since the war’s end, his temper gone, perhaps hidden beneath the trauma and grief. Either way, he rarely yelled, now the victim of Draco’s one-sided provocations. It was the way of things, soon to change but not yet.
Fletcher hopped out of the office when she heard them coming, then produced a cocky lean against the door frame as a sly smirk slipped onto her lips.
Harry grabbed his hand and tugged on it. They were in the middle of a corridor, the odd student pacing towards them, in broad daylight. Draco tried to yank his hand away.
Harry shoved him in the shoulder with a sharp laugh, “Shut up.”
undeserving of you, even as a friend.”
Draco shook his head. “It’s nothing. He’s nothing.”
“Why are you telling me this?” Draco asked quietly, he stared at his lap, turning Potter’s revelation over and over in his mind. Potter was supposed to have the perfect childhood, he lived with family and family wasn’t supposed to abuse a child. He was the chosen one. He was potentially one of the most famous wizards in history and those filthy muggles did what to him?
Draco smiled along with the story, stomaching his dinner during the distraction.
“You’ve never told me a secret either!” Draco blurted, a little childishly, a little pink in the cheeks.
His brow was furrowed in concentration, so Draco didn’t say a word a further; he’d rather Potter get the charm spot on, so that the interior didn’t collapse inwards during the night, than provide a snarky comment.
Harry would stay until gone 4 am and Draco read until he woke and dragged Draco up the stairs by the wrist.
But I'm doing my best to get the next updates out as soon as possible. I appreciate there may be small errors, despite my vigorous editing, but thank you for sticking this out so far!
Potter’s head popped around the door, a subtle source of warmth returned, originating somewhere in Draco’s chest.
It was dark. Perhaps that was the reason Fletcher had decided it was an appropriate time for a momentary break. So, they dug into their dinner, chewing slowly through overcooked rice and semi-raw vegetables as the group below dug into what seemed to be a squirrel. Draco amended his observation as a few more small mammals were pulled into sight. It appeared they were digging into a squirrel, several pigeons, and the half-scavenged leg of a deer (presumably).
It was a long day.
It was only when Fletcher had wandered ahead, mentioning something about a faulty charm, that Draco realised he was alone with Potter. Just two men sat side by side under a large oak tree, toying with the idea of being colleagues.
There was no shaking Harry though, he clung on insistently and pulled Draco into an alcove. He raised his eyebrows and pushed a low brick. They were swung into a dark passageway and Draco finally wrenched his hand out of Harry’s death grip.
“The house seems to know me. How does it know me?” Harry utters in response. He huffs as Draco opens his mouth to answer. “Don’t say ‘
Moments passed in the quiet, until eventually, Harry spoke.
“Sorry, Draco. A few of the subjects wandered over.” Fletcher’s apology was lightly dipped in sincerity.
Shacklebolt looked depleted at best. He seemed more worn-out each day that passed, his half-hearted smile diminishing from each departmental meeting to the next. Draco couldn’t bring himself to care too much though, it was the Head Auror’s fault for the huge workload he deposited upon himself. It seemed to only ever be Potter who too noticed the man’s exhaustion.
The chances of this interview providing any evidence or leads were slimming.
“Are you heading to the meeting?” Potter asked, standing up as Draco reached the door.
Draco rubbed Potter’s back.
Fletcher caught his eyes and smirked. “You’ve never asked, sweetheart.”
“And you think that’s unfair?” Potter said, a bitter tone underlining the words.
Potter’s chest heaved as he retched again, audibly swallowing the rising contents of his stomach. They made it to the bathroom after a few more pushes, and Draco lowered him onto the cold, tiled floor, besides the toilet. His heavy body sunk against the solid surface, his biceps tensing beneath Draco’s touch, and he heaved a gasp.
“I’m just going to pop into the services.” Potter said into the air sometime after they’d passed a town called Andover.
Pansy relaxed her shoulders and with the perfected charisma of a pure-blood daughter, she smiled. “We’d be delighted. Right, Draco?”
However, with her somewhat natural charm, she’d tempted Potter into some light chatting. They talked in quiet voices, discussing some other unsolved case that neither had wrapped their heads around yet. Fletcher was still laid-back about her theories, suggesting she hadn’t yet grasped the case.
“So, you just need to hold this,” Potter said, lifting some sort of nozzle off the wall and plugged it into the compartment. He grabbed Draco’s wrist and tugged until Draco took hold of the blasted thing. “And squeeze. It’ll stop automatically. Just put it back on the wall when it’s finished. All right?”
Harry smiled a little. It wasn’t a full-blown grin as Draco wished for, only halfway there. “Not quite. It was actually very sentimental. Hermione, er, was rather embarrassed when he opened her gifts.” Harry paused. “But of course, she remembered to get me a gift, unlike Ron.”
