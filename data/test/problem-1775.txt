“It’s like the last seven years never existed.”  Theo stated.
“That man was insufferable, but brilliant.”  Harry muttered as he looked at Draco.
Remus walked over to Harry and gave him a hug.  “I know, cub.  It’s alright.  I think you’ll have more questions when a relationship happens.  Your dad left me with a journal.  Details of what he went through and what most of the men in your family went through.  His line overruled the wolf so none of your children will have it, this we do know.  I’m not the first wolf to mate with a Potter.”
“For Dark Arts, couldn’t I just observe and help Papa?  I mean, we could just say I killed Voldemort and already learned the stuff needed so I could just help where needed.  I could stay out of the way at the front where shields are in place from the castle anyway.”
Draco let Harry lead him into the bathroom.  They never really say the words that Harry just spoke and it was nice to hear, but they both knew.  They knew how much feeling was behind everything they did, everything that was said, every gesture toward the other.  Harry started the water while Draco set the towels on the rack for them to grab when they were finished.  Draco stepped behind Harry and took a cloth.  Without words, the pale young man washed his lover, using skill and learned ability to clean the mess they made off his lover’s body.  He, of course, used extra care on Harry’s sensitive areas.  After he was finished with the body, he took the shampoo and washed the hair he loved to run his fingers through.
Draco saw the worry and concern in eyes of his beloved and sighed.
Darkness, all around him.  Harry kept trying to find his way through it, but it seemed useless.  He couldn’t see, couldn’t feel him.  He had lost him somehow.  Everywhere he turned.  Draco was there one minute and gone the next, all that remained was the darkness.
“You know, I’m part owner.  Maybe I can help him.”
A few hours later, there was a knock on the door.  Draco got up first, making sure Harry was covered.  He pulled on his pants and then opened the door to see Theo.  Draco stepped into the hallway and shut the door, raising a brow in question.
He took a deep breath and nodded, lifting his beloved in his arms.  He carried him out of the room, Theo and Pansy with him while Ron and Hermione went to get his parents.  Draco quickly followed through the door and Theo got the nurse as Pansy held the door for him.  He carefully laid the boy in his arms in a bed and then sat in the chair next to him, seeing a letter in his hand.  He noticed his mother’s handwriting and put it in his pocket before taking Harry’s hand in his.  Pomfrey quickly came over and started working on Harry as someone else brought in Lavender Brown.  The blonde could feel the anger, knowing that bitch had something to do with Harry being hurt made his blood boil.
Everyone else in the room held their breath while they waited on the answer.  Harry could see the concern in his father and nodded.
Harry sat up at that, almost hitting Draco.  He turned and silently said sorry.  Remus then looked at his son and moved forward a bid.  “Harry I need you to concentrate.  The connection can work both ways.  You need to let him know we know and will get him out as soon as we can.  Blimpy find the elves in the kitchen and see which ones are feeding James, please.  We need to know what magic was used.”
“Just in time.  My Moony said we could research here today.”
A knock on the door halted whatever came next as Draco moved off the younger man and the door opened.  They both smiled as Sirius’ head popped into the room, smiling at the boys.
“Harry.”
Harry chuckled.  “Yes,  I agree.  They still have a few days left.  At least you know Sirius doesn’t hate you.”
“I haven’t gotten to tell you yet.  Today, love.”  Hermione explained, silently signaling they had ears listening.
No one said anything, but they knew by the tone in the blonde’s voice, he and his beloved were done with the rumors...the lies.  Draco stared with the mask his father instilled in him and waited.  He knew who would say something, knew that bloody bint wanted to sink her teeth into the chosen one, and knew she couldn’t get them there.  Ron and Hermione stayed still, letting Draco control the situation.  They were quite aware of the rumors and what Lavender and her buddies were saying about Harry.  They also knew Draco wouldn’t really hurt them, mostly because Harry doesn’t want them hurt.  He just wanted the rumors to stop.  Harry, well, he knew Draco was just as fed up and he was.  They just wanted to be happy, which they were.  Harry was hoping tonight would make them extremely happy when they left this morning.  He also knew they’d need to talk about it. For them to move to the next level, Harry was going to have to top till they wanted the risk of a baby. Draco didn’t have good experiences with being on bottom.
“I will as well.” Draco commented.
Harry smiled.  “I haven’t showered, but you can go first.”
Draco pulled the savior to him, touching their lips together one more time before they separated to look through the journal in front of them.  They sat the new book between them where they both could see it and Draco explained how to use it.
“Why Draco Malfoy, have you missed me?”
“Yes.  When the Healer told Lucius and I about it, Lucius made me give it to him.  I didn’t want him to have it.  I saw what it did to Sirius and had suspicions in school about the three of them.  When Sirius let me in on just how close the three of them were and how it affected you, I wasn’t too shocked, Harry.  I am also saddened that my son had that choice taken from him.  I always regretted it, but more after I saw with my own eyes how my cousin felt while he was telling me about you and your fathers.”
Harry walked over to his boyfriend and looked in.  The bathroom was nice.  It had a seperate bath and shower, both looking like three or four could fit at once.  The savior blushed at the thought and turned back to their room.
“That what you want, love.  Want me touching you?”
“Just worried.”  he whispered, not knowing if Draco actually heard him.
Harry felt the sting of the words and turned, not wanting to hear more.  He found himself in an empty corridor and let his legs slide slowly under him, sitting on the floor.  He leaned his head on the wall and sighed.  Did he really look like a puppy?  He didn’t think he did, but is that how he was looked at.  The defect was actually starting to balance out, he was learning who he was now.  Most of all, he was happy.  He had a boyfriend who looked beyond what he did and saw who he was.  That was something he always wanted.
“Please, Draco, please.”  Harry whispered against the lips of his boyfriend.
They both nodded. "Lily found a book about the Potter's in the small library here. Your line has bearers in it. The line makes it so when a Potter hits puberty, two sets of organs are formed. The birth canal just doesn't show up till the act is made and it results in a pregnancy. James confronted his father, who had always told him his mother died in birth and his Uncle John helped raised him. Your grandfather carried James. They explained that James had to keep this a secret because they were very powerful if the bearer was born. We then explained the marks and Charlus was very understanding. John told us that I, as Remus, had chosen Sirius while Moony chose James. It was rare for the wolf and the human to have a different mate, but it did happen. Especially if one was a bearer."
It had been a week since the conversation between the Malfoys and the Lupin-Black-Potter family.  One week that felt like a lifetime.  Severus’ notes were taking a lot out of Draco, and Harry as well.  They couldn’t figure out what he had written.  Draco had expressed apologies more than once and Harry always waved it off like nothing.  He knew it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park, so to speak, and told Draco as much.  This morning, Harry woke to someone arguing with Remus in the kitchen.  Harry couldn’t make out who it was, or what was said.  He just knew it wasn’t Sirius, as the other voice was female.  He got up and pulled his pajamas up before heading out to see what was going on in the living room.
Harry woke up to the warmth associated with Draco and smiled.  Oh how he loved the boy he was wrapped in.  He looked down and noticed their hands had both landed on his stomach, holding their baby as they slept. A baby, he knew it was coming.  He was also scared of what his reaction would be at hearing the news.  The amount of joy and happiness that filled him yesterday was overflowing and he couldn’t contain it.  That was till the blood last night.  He was so freaking scared of what happened, that he was still trying to wrap his head around it.  He looked back to the wall and sighed.  His dad, thank Merlin, James knew what to do and how to help.  He would always be grateful to him for that.
Mendlshank shook his head and pulled out a very thick file.
“How can I help...Mr. Potter, back so soon?”
kind of want to know it’s not just because I can give powerful babies.  It’s going to be hard enough with killing Voldemort.”
“To promote house unity, you will be made an example of.  You will be sharing a room with people from a different house, well the boys.  As only three girls came back, you will all be in one room.  The faculty know Harry and Draco are together, and through some things they can tell if they wish, will be in a room together.  Neville, you and Dean will actually be sharing as there are more of your house.  We also put Ron and Semus with Theo.  We hope you all can get passed prejudice and war.  Everyone lost something, whether 18 years ago or two, please remember that.”
“That is what you have always said, Narcissa.  Everything pertaining to that man; it was don’t worry Lucius, there’s nothing to worry about Lucius, and so on.  For Harry bleeding Potter and the mutts to come to my home, without me knowing, to have a meeting with my wife and my son; that’s not for worry either?”
Harry,
Everyone turned around to see Lavender standing in the archway to the dorm rooms.  Draco kept his fingers in his boyfriend’s hair and simply raised his left eyebrow in question, not giving her the satisfaction of answering her.  The rest of the room looked from the boys at the end of the couch to the girl on the other side of the room.  They had all heard her talking about the two, knew she was going to be on the receiving end of one, if not both of them.  Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter alone were powerful, put them together and they were unstoppable.  Pansy and Theo knew the rumors were false; they didn’t know what had made the relationship escalate as fast as it did, but they knew when Harry trusted them enough, Draco would tell them.
Remus took deep breaths as they reached the porch of the manor that his son was currently in.  He had no clue how to explain what was going on, what his son was feeling.  All he knew was with the way Harry was raised, with that bastard’s abuse, it may be a lot different than James.  The wolf felt his mate take his hand and squeezed it to let him know he was alright.  Sirius was going to get very upset when Remus explained what happened to the boys not to mention Lucius and Narcissa.  Letting out one more breath, he raised his hand to the snake door knocker and moved it so the tenants would know they had another guest, well guests.
“The dreams. We figured it out.  Talked with the mutts this morning.  Your theory is probably spot on.”  Draco informed them.
Remus smiled, sitting across from him after leaving a warming charm on Sirius' plate.
“Gin told us what mum said Harry.  How’re you?”  Ron asked as they all sat.
Harry sighed.  “Blaming you and Sirius is wrong though.  I heard her say that.”
“I apologize.”
“I’ve been having dreams where someone is asking me to find Padfoot and Moony.  The voice says he’s in the lost room.  Do you know the lost room?”
He was going to have to ask Narcissa Malfoy for Snape’s journals.  He was going to have to let her know he needed them.  The biggest thing, though...he was going to have to ask Draco to help with them.  If anyone knew how to decipher Snape’s words, it was his godson.  Severus had taught Draco everything he knew.  He got out of the tub and dried off before putting on the shorts and walking back to his room.  Grabbing a pair of jeans, he pulled them on and then called for Slinky.
“Mother had this one in her safe.  I guess the house elf forgot this one.  Severus left a way for me to read his notes.  I know it was for me; he taught me this code when he started teaching me potions.”
They all watched as the girl stupidly walked further into the room, heading to the boys no one wanted on their bad side.  Draco let go of Harry and when he made to get up, Harry stopped him.  Everyone watched as the Slytherin and the Gryffindor debated silently.  They watched a smile, something they never seen before, grace the blonde’s face as he sat down.  Harry turned to the witch.
Moony chuckled a bit.  “I agree and she’ll drag Ron with her.”
“Harry’s my partner in potions and Theo isn’t in there because he doesn’t need it.  He actually has a free period.  We could ask him if he’s willing to polyjuice.  That way Harry gets notes and no one knows he’s not there.  Also, Theo’s at about the same level as Harry so it wouldn’t be questioned.  He has a few weeks before he absolutely can’t be there anyway.  He could sit outside in his cloak so he’s still near me.”  Draco asked.
Harry smiled, leaning in to kiss his boyfriend.  “I was thinking the same and had a conversation with papa.”
“The bed was cold.”  he whispered, their blanket wrapped around him.
“We need to talk, Padfoot.”
Harry’s back arched as one finger slowly turned in to two fingers, fucking himself and asking for more.  Once Draco got three fingers in, Harry started going wild as his prostate was being petted.  The passion, the arousal, the sensation of his lover was almost just enough, but something was missing.
The older two got up and nodded in answer, Remus walking closer to his cub.
“Whatever it is, it’s ok.”  he whispered.
Both men laughed as Draco helped Harry out of the bed.  He watched as Harry grabbed a pair of jeans and then made his way to his own shower.  Draco took his towel and wiped off what he could after taking off the slacks.  He put the piece of soiled clothing into their hamper and then pulled out another pair, slipping his legs through.  He had just finished with a light button up shirt when Harry came back in.  They were getting better at not having to see each other all the time, which was helping them both.  Harry no longer freaked out when Draco was in another room, and Draco no longer felt he had to put Harry in the room with him.
“Please let them know we’re here, I know it’s early.”  Harry stated to the little girl in the painting, usually they just went in but if it was really early, they didn’t want to scare James.  A few moments of waiting had the frame opening and Sirius letting them in.
Sirius kept his eye on Harry, and Harry furrowed his brow.  He knew there was a meaning in that, but didn’t quite know what it meant.
“I got pregnant on the first heat after we were all eighteen.  I miscarried because we didn’t know and I got into a duel with some death eaters.  Wolves are most fertile during heats and can get pregnant outside of them.  I’m so sorry boys.”  James stated.
Harry stopped Ginny from getting up by holding his hand out.  He then looked at the woman he held as a second mother and everyone could feel the tension.  Harry’s guardians knew this could be bad, but it was Harry’s fight and they had already warned the red head about it.  Harry stood up and looked the woman in the eye.
Remus smiled.  “There’s James, and a bit of me.  Your father was so loyal, so kind, and knew exactly who to trust with what.  When Lily brought Severus, he was the only one to see how much he’d help.  It took Sirius longer than I to see it, but I always knew there was more to Snape then he wanted us to see.”
Harry felt Draco tense and then realized what he said and closed his eyes.  He turned his face into the blonde’s neck and let the other calm him.  They weren't supposed to say anything till the ministry found out.  They were also waiting till James had a bit more time to catch up to time, so to speak.
“Sorry.”  the blond whispered, lightening the tightness of his arms for Harry to move.
“I love you and will love our baby.  Harry Potter, the boy-with-no-luck.”
“Love you too.”  Harry whispered back.
Green eyes closed and a sigh left the slightly younger one as the arousal slowly took over the heat his skin felt.  Turning his head, lips found the lips he loved kissing and sighed as the more dominant of the two deepened the kiss.  Harry’s hand raised and cupped the back of Draco’s neck, holding him in place.
Narcissa nodded.  “Pipper…”
Ron glanced at the slytherin’s and then back to the man he would kill for.
Harry nodded, pulling back from Sirius. "So am I like dad?"
Harry nodded.  “True.  Are the Slytherins going to give you a hard time?”
They all watched as the elf closed his eyes and stood silently.  No one said anything, and tried not to breathe too loudly encase they disturb the creature.  They watched as the elf opened his eyes and turned to Remus and Sirius.
He nodded and she squealed, giving him a hug.
Ron sighed.  “I know.  I’m supposed to talk him into it.  He’ll want to see everyone and so will probably go.  We will need to be careful though.  Mum doesn’t think he’s a bearer and will stress him.  James will need to be there so he can read the signs.  He knows what to look for better than we do.  Sirius won’t go, he’ll hex mum, and Remus will go because Harry wants to.”
Harry subtly nodded.  “Since the pub I know.  Probably Skeeter’s lacky.”
“That what we thought, I’ve been digging since Remus is resting for next week.  One of our order members, Gideon Prewett went missing.  He was Molly’s brother, Fabian died, but Gideon was in St. Mungos and then disappeared the same night.  We’re thinking Albus took him.”
Remus looked at his mate, who nodded, and then back to his son and Ron.
“You’re welcome, Moony.  We have been invited to the Malfoy’s for tea.”
Draco laughed and leaned down to kiss his beloved.  Harry’s hand grabbed the back of the blonde’s neck, holding him in place.  Harry moved and sat up, sitting on the other's lap and sighing as he felt Draco’s hardness against his.  It felt like it had been forever since they snogged, like really snogged.  Draco moaned and held onto Harry’s hip, pulling him as close as he could for friction they both needed.  A moan left the younger one as he started a pace to match the push and pull of Draco.  When air was needed, Draco kissed his way down Harry’s jaw, causing a moan from the boy on him.  Harry moved his head to give his lover better access.  “Oh sweet Merlin.” was moaned as Draco bit and sucked on his left pulse point.
“Baby?”
The scene made Draco smile, and miss Pansy and Theo.  He really needed to owl them, it’s been too long with too much going on.  Ron nodded at him when he was noticed and Hermione smiled.  Harry turned and held out his hand, signaling Draco to come forward.  They both knew Sirius and Remus were somewhere and were giving their cub time with the guests before coming in.
Harry took the hand on his cheek in his hand and held it.
The blonde looked at the boy in his arms and kissed his forehead.
They watched as Sirius left and then went to find their rooms. Hermione, Lavender, and Pansy found their room first and left the boys till the morning.  Harry and Draco found their room, leaving the others to find their own.  Walking in, Draco started open doors, while Harry waved his wand to put their bed together.
The old Dark Arts teacher and his beloved’s godfather kept this from him, knowing how much he would have needed it.  Draco also understood why they did that.  Voldemort, hell even Lucius before taking that vow, probably would’ve loved “loving” a bearer.  Knowing James Potter was kept safe because of Dumbledore was new, but Draco also understood that.  Feeling movement within his arms took Draco out of his musings and to pull his head back just a tad.
Everyone finally looked at Draco, and Harry could see how much confusion was in the face of the young man.  He glanced at Remus, who smiled encouragingly, and then back to Draco.
Harry turned and looked at him, wanting to see the reaction.  “That we should try.  That we just let us be in the moment.  That we let instinct overplay the mind.  That we relax.  It makes sense, doesn’t it?”
“And I you.”
“Finally, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, your tongue will not be able to confess and your magic will turn on you should you attempt to gossip, talk, or bring harm to Remus Lupin’s son, Harry Potter.  Do you swear it.”
The older two looked at Harry, Sirius, of course, not knowing why they had come early.  Harry kept his eyes on the matriarch of the family, hoping to avoid Draco a bit longer.
“What happened?  I heard some kids talking about him being in the infirmary.”  She asked.
Harry laughed as Remus hit his godfather behind the head.  Sirius huffed and then they went to the floo, using it to get to the Malfoys.
He stood, waiting for her.  The young man and his companions watched as the woman took in what Harry had told her.  Harry could feel his resolve breaking, but refused to let the woman see it.  She stepped closer and looked into his eyes, for what he wasn’t sure.
Harry leaned back and they gave him some space. He looked out the window, now that the story was finished, he thought about the whole thing. His mother, wasn't his mother. James Potter carried him. Remus sired him. He knew he wasn't a werewolf though, he didn't change. He did always have the sense of things though. He watched as a shadow passed the window and the color of his eyes showed in his reflection. He looked back at the men, who were trying to give him space and just watched. James Potter had brown eyes, Remus had hazel, more amber when closer to the moon. What did he have? If not green then what?
Draco shrugged.  “I don’t know, love.  We could ask my mother.  I’m sure the wealthy had ways to hide it.”
Smiling, Harry reaches in and pulls out the eggs and potatoes to get started, letting the meat continue to thaw before it’s needed.  Deciding on making some omelets, he reaches back in for the other things he wants to add, picking up some ham as well, before shutting it.  He sits everything on the counter and then grabs a skillet out of the cabinet.  Turning on the stove, Harry sets about making breakfast the muggle way.
“Rolf needed to come home, his grandfather isn’t doing well.  It’s good to see you, though.”
Harry blushed a bit and nodded.  “We’re getting to know each other, yes.  Nothing else though.  I know what you want to happen, Sirius.  I don’t want to rush him, or me for that matter.”
Harry smiled, not having thought of that.  “Do you think he’d get Minerva to let us share?  I don’t know if we could be apart, even if in the same building.”
“Alright, we should get dressed before I change my mind.”
Remus pulled out his wand and waved it at the door, shutting it and locking it.
“As for homes, you have the main manor in Surrey.  You have a cottage in a small community where the Peverell family started, and a summer home in Athens.  You also own a piece of the school due to the Gryffindor and Slytherin lines, so about a third as they had many descendants and only three in account for today through all the founders.  Anything else you wish to know, Mr. Potter?"
He then went into what he heard.  It was like second year all over again.  Harry just wanted to be normal.  Sometimes being a Potter sucked, but what was he to do.  At least he had his friends.
“No.  Draco please.  I was just worried I had changed more than I thought.  Prongs helped though.  He said the things I do with you, the things everyone gets to see, he did with papa and Lily.”  Harry whispered back.
A bit of time with James and Sirius and a bit of Lavender spreading rumors.
They nodded at him, and the other two boys mouths dropped in surprise.
"Please just be quiet till I get this out. I thought James would be here to help with it and he's not. I don't really know how to start. Padfoot suggested our third year." Remus spoke softly.
“Padfoot, what did I tell you about cooking?  I swear, you and James could burn the house down.  I can remember Lily yelling at you both constantly.”
“Albus Dumbledore...he...Annaleise?”
“One, Severus was gay.  That’s why you didn’t need to worry, that’s why he didn’t have an heir, that’s why I insisted he make Draco his hair, and we, his godfather.  There wasn’t going to be another choice.  Second, not everything is about you, Lucius Malfoy.  This is about our son, Harry Potter, and the notes that actually needed to be given back to him.  If you so much as touch, or influence, a hair on Draco’s head in anyway, you will be in your own wing.  I mean it.  I love you, always have.  I have followed you blindly and it almost cost us everything, including our son.  I will not stand for it anymore.  Either you learn to deal with the changes in Draco, or not.  But I will not listen to your nonsense anymore.”
Waking up as he had the last couple days put a smile on Draco’s face.  He rolled over and kissed the forehead of the man in bed with him before getting up to shower before Hermione got there.  The witch was staying at the house her parents owned here as they were staying in Australia, but wanted her to have the house in Wales.  They had been spending the last few days going over the notes already deciphered as well as figuring out the contraceptive.  Hermione, as well as Draco, knew Harry needed to know that information first.  The blonde also agreed with Harry and wasn’t ready to have a baby should they reach that level of intimacy soon.  Not that Draco thought they would, and not just because of his experiences.
“I’ll try, just hurry please.”  Harry whispered back.
He’s teaching, isn’t he?”
Harry nodded and gave a small smile to Sirius.  Sirius nodded and mentioned Slinky had made breakfast.
Sirius made to get up and Harry grabbed his arm. Sirius looked at him as he got up and Harry let him go. "I'll ask Remus, dad, father?"
“I don’t think I want to do that anymore.  Besides, I think I want to be the teacher, the “mother” so to speak when that time comes.”
She nodded and he watched as she swished her wand, running tests to see how he was after the episode.  Draco silently walked out and sat next to Harry as she was finishing up and James sat up in his bed.
“Give me a moment and I’ll go, Poppy.”
Draco nodded, silently telling him to continue.
“Then it doesn’t make sense.”
She smiled. “Yes, however, you should eat here so people wont bug you at breakfast.”
“What we are about to tell you is to stay in this family.  Your son and ours are special, and will be part of something bigger than you and me and the war.  Harry has to be hidden.  The only people who know alive are those in this room, bar you.  Severus trusted your wife and your son, but not you.  Harry needs your help, Lucius.  Are you willing to by oath to give it?”
“You alright, cub?”
Harry watched as the dog than got up and put his dish in the sink.  He watched as he pulled Remus to him as the wolf entered the kitchen and gave him a kiss before walking by.  Harry smiled as the soft blush his father had on his cheeks and realized Sirius was right.  He needed to talk to Draco, and soon.  With Draco’s new found confidence to do what he wants, Harry knew he’d probably find someone soon if he didn’t.  The blonde knew how good looking he was and Harry didn’t want to lose a chance to be happy.  He watched his friends almost lose that chance while on the run the last year.  He saw what Ron’s separation did to Hermione when she tried to hide it.  Harry didn’t want that.
“Later, Draco.”  Theo whispered, putting his hand on his friend’s shoulder.
Harry smiled and nodded.
Draco jumped up and ran to him with a smirk.  “I believe we already did that, more than once.”
Remus looked back to his son and smiled.  “Let’s eat.  Then we can try to find a solution to this dream, son.”
Draco got up and then helped Harry up as well.  “I say, of course, but I don’t share you.  You’re mine and I’m very possessive of my things.”
When they walked in, everyone got quiet, making Harry hide a bit.  The four walked slowly into the room, knowing all eyes were watching Harry.  Hermione, smiled at Harry and Ron and then set in the floor, Ron taking the chair she was in front of.  Harry watched the two, knowing they knew what was being said and was grateful.  Draco took a seat on the couch next to the chair Ron sat in, letting Harry set next to Hermione.
Remus looked at Narcissa, taking his eyes off the boys.  They were still huddled, not really noticing anyone else but the other.  The wolf shook his head.
Draco smiled.  “Yes, you should talk to him during our free period.”
Harry sighed as Draco flipped him over and proceeded to kiss down Harry’s chest, taking his pricking into his mouth.
“Was I a bearer?”
Draco smirked, they all saw it.  “Theo is straight, Zambini.  I cannot change that fact.  There is no need for you to know who I’m with.  What I want to know is why you’re here, at the school.”
Sirius saw the way Harry looked and felt for his godson. It was going to be hard, which he told Harry. He also let his godson know that he didn't know the Slytherin, and most in their society had to hide their sexuality. With Harry being a bearer, if Draco did lean his way, an heir wouldn't be an issue and maybe they both could be happy. Harry took that in and could see what Sirius was talking about. Hermione had explained how wizarding society worked. He also figured Draco had an arranged marriage.
Harry opened his eyes to see Remus and now Sirius in the room with him.  “What happened?”
“Love...Harry, look at me.”
"Second year was when they found out about me, my lycanthrophy. Third year was when my wolf hit puberty, I guess that's the easiest way to say it. I hit that twice, which sucks both times by the way. Anyways, I saw James and Sirius about three days before the train back to school. One night we were in James' room at this cottage, the one you picked actually. Well I bit both of them. Now, before you ask, it wasn't a full moon and we didn't understand it. Lily was already real close to us, even if we tell it differently.
Draco nodded.  “Alright.  Maybe with some space or I’m going to kiss you again.”
“Hey, you guys ready?”  he asked as he stepped into the room.
Harry sighed, “Better.  Why didn’t you tell me about the heat?  I don’t get it.  I should’ve known it.”
Harry felt like a weight was lifted as he got up to hug his parents.
School starts, plots thickens...
“That’s actually, not a bad idea, cub.  The students wouldn’t question it because you taught some of them in your fifth year as well.”  Remus commented.
“I love you no matter what, ok?”  he whispered, his hands on Harry’s shoulder.
“What are you thinking?”  Draco whispered.
After Harry sent a message with one of the elves within the cottage, there were only two, letting Draco know they would be there, he went to the local market. The older two stayed behind, but Harry needed clothes as he wasn’t going to show up wearing clothing from the 70s, especially to the Malfoys.  While in the small wizarding town, he ducked his head and sent an owl to the Weasley’s letting them know he was alright.  Walking down the street, he found a quaint little clothing store and walked in.  A little old woman was standing behind the counter and smiled at him.
“Harry and I are going to the village for lunch.  You are all welcome to join us.  Y’know, get out of the house for a bit.”
“No, I can’t do that to you.  We barely have been past snogging and now we have to share a room.  That’s not right, Draco.”  He whispered it, but they all heard him.
Harry nodded.  “You?”
“What answers a question?”
“What time is it, Sirius?”  Draco asked as they sat on the loveseat.
Everyone looked at Harry and he sighed.  “Papa and Padfoot are going to the ministry tomorrow and will not be here for classes.  Sirius only has one class till after lunch anyway and was going to see if Draco could oversee the one first year class at 10. Minerva approved it.  Papa asked me to do an answer type class about the war and things we did to defeat Voldemort so they could go.  Prongs is coming out of hiding.”
“This is true.  I just hope he doesn’t get hurt.  People are going to find out he’s more different eventually.”  Pansy commented.
Remus watched the whole exchange and when Harry popped way, he lost it.  He got up, not noticing Sirius watching him.  He walked over to Molly and stopped.
“Miss Narcissa says Master Harry can come now if yous wish, sirs.  Her and Draco will bes in her parlor as to not scares you with memories.  The floo is Narcissa Malfoy’s study, Master Harry.”
Draco smiled a lazy smile and kissed him back.
Draco looked up at him and sighed.  “What love, tell me.”
Draco smiled, opening his eyes to see green staring at him.  “Good nap?”
“Draco, he needs the infirmary.”  He heard from someone, sounded like Pansy.
“I guess.  Just worried.  The bump is fine though.”  he whispered back, smiling as he touched his stomach.
“He can figure that out for himself, Molly.  He’s an adult, he’s done more than you or I could in a million lifetimes.”
All three jumped at being addressed.  They looked at Draco, who looked a bit lost.  He looked at each of them in turn and then back to Harry.
“I assure you, he isn’t.  We have journals, family ones, even ones from Severus, that say otherwise.  His grandfather hid the secret to keep his father from being used by Dumbledore and the rising dark lord, surely you can understand that.  I love this man and we are trying to figure this out.  You have triggered parts of this with your hurtful words and I refuse to listen to your bigotry any longer.  You will accept him or not, but get out.”
Harry smiled and nodded.  “Yes, just thinking, Moony.  I should get the things together.  Can we use the library today or do you need it still?”
Draco nodded and gave Harry a small kiss.  “Thank you for telling me.  I think we should make a rule or two.  The dominant part of me is reaching out to the part Wea-Ron’s mum opened.  What do you think?”
“It’s alright.  Guys really.”
“I love you too, Draco.”
“Can you sense James Potter in this castle?”  Remus asked the elf, knowing as head elf, he’d be able to sense all members of the Potter family.
Everyone waited while the nurse ended her exam.
“You ok?”  He whispered, looking into the green eyes of the man in his arms.
“I know, but Hermione’s right.  A clinic like that would be beneficial to our world.  I could help back it and I’m sure one of my many properties has abandoned buildings that were used for business.”
“Muggles are weird.”
“Love looks good on you Draco.  You think Pansy will agree to try it with me?”
He slowly crept out of the bed, not wanting to wake Draco and made his way to the bathroom.  He did his business and looked at his reflection.  He raised his tee shirt and touched his stomach.  It was still flat, but he noticed the tough parts where the baby was growing.  He smiled and continued to caress the lower part of his abdomen, whispering his thoughts to the baby.  “You dad and I love you already, little one.  No one is going to hurt you, we won’t let them.  You have so many people who are going to give you love like you will never know.  I will be better than Lily’s family were to me, I promise you.”
Draco smiled and ran his fingers down Harry’s jaw.  “I have questions as well.  Why didn’t they ask us about anything?  Why not tell about the heat just encase?  As for the baby, I still stand where I did when we started Severus’ notes, Harry.  I would be honored to have a baby with you.”
He whispered the last part, but the blonde heard him and nodded.
No one saw it come, but should’ve as Blaise was on the wall, held by magic.  There was a shield between Harry and everyone as he approached the man.  No one knows what was said, but Blaise’s eyes showed anger as Harry held him there.  Everyone watched as Harry kept the man on the wall and continued to whisper to him when they heard a crack.  Blaise had disappeared and Harry was smiling.
“It’s alright.  We’re at an impasse with the notes anyway.  How about we spend time with our families and meet in two days to relook.  Maybe it’ll clear our heads.”  Harry commented looking up at the man holding him.
The others nodded, and Remus sit tea in front of all of them.  They drank quietly, taking in their visit and their day.  After a while, all three men got up to head to their respective rooms and let sleep claim them.
He grabbed a pair of jeans, slipped them on, and then pulled a white tee over his head.  Getting on the ground of his closet, “there you are”  he whispered as he grabbed his trainers, putting them on his feet.  As he walked into the living room to leave with the two marauders, he heard Sirius mumbling about having to see Mrs. Weasley.  Harry couldn’t blame him as he was just as worried about the visit.  Molly will once again ask about Harry and tell him it’s his duty to continue the line.
The other two smiled and Ginny hugged him again.
“Harry call Blimpy.”
“That’s the portrait he’s behind.  The lover’s.  It’s the only room rumored to have the things Harry explained in the dreams.  Before the portrait was put there, it was used for punishments.  They put the lover’s there to hide what was inside.  If they used it for “Moony time” as Sirius called, it would make sense.  It had things to help with the wolf if needed.”
Draco closed his eyes and sighed, hating Molly Weasley right about now.  He opened them to see Harry.  “I will dress while you’re in the bath and be right outside the door when you’re finished.”
“I love you.”  He whispered, kissing the man before him.
The group then went into what the other’s were planning on for after Hogwarts and Sirius let the “cat out of the bag” so to speak about Remus also having a Healer’s license.
“Oh.”
Harry turned to Molly, who was at the backdoor, and nodded.  He got up and went into the kitchen to help bring out some bowls of food.  Some of the others followed him.  As he was putting the last bowl on the table, Molly pulled him over.
"How can I be friends with someone I'm attracted to, Sirius?"
Sirius and Remus smiled, leaning against each other.  The twins laughed out loud, and Neville even had a smirk on his face.  The others nodded and George let out a breath, letting the small group know Molly wasn’t going to like the fact Harry wouldn’t be family.  Fred on the other hand, mentioned Charlie, causing their young friend to blush a bit and his companions to chuckle.
There are some breaks in this chapter as I don't know how to do italics.  If anyone knows, please tell me so I can re-edit this chapter and future ones as well!
She turned back to her cousin and smiled.  “Do you think my sister would be willing?”
The black man looked at Harry, confusion in his eyes. "Harry, what they have…"
“Alright, I get that.  But with the defect, I should’ve been informed.  I’m Harry Potter, things that should not happen tend to happen.”
Harry opened the door to see his friends huddled around what looked to be a map, of what he wasn’t sure.  They both looked up and smiled.
“Tell him we’ll see him when he gets back and we love him.”  She whispered.
“I didn’t take the potion, Draco.  Dumbledore didn’t know about my dad.  Sirius and Remus are the only ones alive that did know.  Pettigrew didn’t know, so that meant Voldemort didn’t know.  My grandfather was scared Dumbledore would use my dad for power in the first war that was just beginning, I read that in his journal.  Remus had two mates because Sirius had the potion, my father didn’t.  I need the books because I’m scared if I let myself have what I want I can’t prevent it till I don’t want to prevent it from happening. There’s also notes to reverse the potion, so I’m told.”
Harry nodded and then started to make his way to his own family. He wanted to give the Weasley's time to celebrate the fact Fred didn't die, not that it wasn't close. Pomfrey almost couldn't save him. He nods to the red heads, Hermione standing with them as he passes. When he gets to the two men that weren't blood, but may as well be, they both pulled him into their embrace. All three men started crying for the joy of having the others with them. Harry didn't know about Sirius until the battle when the three of them showed up and told Neville to alert the order. He squeezed Sirius and Sirius wrapped both arms around their cub, just happy to be there. Harry could feel himself break, finally able to breathe and let go of the pain, the stress of the last year.
Harry sat back a bit to get comfortable and nodded.  “Yea, I think Padfoot would like it.  Don’t you want to know if it’s possible?”
“You too, Papa, Sirius.”  Harry explained.
Draco gave the boy one last kiss and then Harry watched as he went into the green flames, disappearing out of sight.
They watched the boy walk further into the room and closer to the blonde.
Narcissa
“Would anyone like to address anything?  It got strangely quiet when we entered.”  Draco drawled, letting his fingers run through Harry’s head.
They both turned and smiled.
“I heard a rumor that the old cottage had people in it last night.  What can I do for you Mr. Potter?”
“I is being Slinky, Master Harry, sirs.  I’s new here.  Blimpy brought me as my mistress died, Master Harry.”
Everyone looked at Sirius and the werewolf, wondering if the dog was onto something.  Remus furrowed his brow to think on what his mate was thinking.  It made sense because of the messages from the two kids.  Sirius was right, they called it the lost room and they never told anyone what room it was.
Harry’s eyes got wide as he heard Draco.  The blond was right, he can’t stay there.  Not with the memories it held.  Draco sighed and looked at his parents.  They both nodded, knowing what their son knew.  Draco was right, Harry couldn’t stay there.  Hell, they both knew Draco was itching to leave, which is why Narcissa was gutting the house and redoing all of it.
He watched a sigh leave her and a small smile.  Two of the people in the room still didn’t know the kinship their friend had with the Dumbledore, but the little girl looked very happy the older boy was going to be fine.
They watched Hermione’s eyes light up.  “That’s a brilliant idea, Sirius.  Remus, could you imagine.  We should do it.  We could use our knowledge and skills on creatures and open to their needs as well.  St.  Mungos does tend to throw out those they don’t think are worthy of their care.  We could…”
“So you and Ginny looked to be doing better.  But Harry, I’m over that.  I’m sorry it took a few weeks.  I did invite Luna, she’s a sweet girl and I do remember you mentioning blondes.”
“Morning, cub.  How are you this morning?”  he asked, sitting the meat on the tray so it would burn while he finished.
“Good thing Ron’s just as good at strategy.”  Harry stated.
Draco stayed, knowing Harry would need him, as he watched father and son reunite finally.
“It isn’t Harry.  The journals don’t say how not to get pregnant because there isn’t a way around it other than you topping.  It sucks, but there you have it.  The wolf wouldn’t let James and so I had to try real hard not to get him pregnant sooner.  You were not planned, not while Voldemort was as large as he was at the time, but you were welcomed.  You were, are, loved every bit of every day since we knew about you.  Severus was working on some things to help with it after learning our biggest secret.  We don’t know if he managed anything though, he was never able to let us see his notes.”
“Yes, Master Harry.”  the small elf asked, popping in.
Remus nodded and they went back to their other conversations.  Everyone ate, talked, laughed, and was just...happy.  Happy they all survived.  Arthur did let everyone know that Kingsley decided to do a big memorial service next week, wanting to let everyone have enough rest and to grieve over those they lost.  He also let it slip that the new minister would probably try to get Harry to say something.  Harry told him that there wasn’t any way he was speaking, he didn’t want to.  He didn’t defeat the bastard on his own, just finished it.
"Your mother knew. She took care of you like you were her own, but it was James that saved you that night. James' blood. Charlus told us not to let anyone know because people, especially Albus, would want a bearer. They are rare and more powerful than anything. After school, the four of us moved to Godric's Hollow. Peter told us he couldn't because of his mother. James and Lily were using her as, oh what's it called?"
“Breakfast.  Narcissa wants you home after you eat.”
“So, why did I react like that?”
“I get it.  Those that matter, they already know and are fine with it.  They understand it, love.  Those that don’t matter, well...fuck them.  As for rooms...maybe your papa can help.
“Let’s go see Prongs.  He’s finishing up a session and I know he’d like to see you.  We’ve all been busy.”
“All three of you,
Draco chuckled as he closed the door to shower.  Harry watch the door close and then pulled out some lounge pants and a tee, glad it was the weekend.  He wanted to ask James about what he did to Blaise and how it would affect him.  He hoped he didn’t hurt the little one before with whatever magic he used.   He was slipping on his shoes when Draco came out and found a clean pair of pants, slipping them on.  The blonde pulled a jumper out and pulled it over his head before sitting to put his shoes on.  Harry smiled as a hand was held out and he took it, letting the other one lead him down the corridors to his parent’s living quarters for some questions and answers about things only they could help with.
Harry was also the reason.  His abuse was quite different than Draco’s and longer.  Draco, of course, had all the information after Harry’s magic lashed out at him during a snog session that went too far.  Harry was saddened that they couldn’t be as physical as he wanted, and he really wanted to be.  Their connection though, had a way of letting the other know when not to push.  The darker man smiled as his pale counterpart opened his eyes.  The blond smiled and leaned closer to kiss his boyfriend.  Harry welcomed the kiss and pushed to deepen it, Draco letting him.  Draco pushed back and Harry laid on his back as they moved.  Draco hovered a tad over the man under him as hands begin to wonder.
“What’s going on?  We wanted to know what Harry wanted to discuss, he was supposed to be getting Draco.”  Hermione stated.
Harry glanced at Draco, seeing the same confusion he felt reflecting back in those grey eyes.
Sirius looked at his mate, Harry looking at his other dad.  Both men were confused, Remus could tell so he decided to elaborate.
Draco and Harry both breathed sighs of relief.  Now that he knew things were in place, plans being made, Harry felt a bit more secure on the outcomes of this surprise heat.  Now he just hoped he and Draco could survive whatever comes at them and still be happy on the other side, only the future weeks would know that for sure.
“I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”
“Harry, we’re leaving.”
He smiles and looks at the elf that made her presence known.  “I’ll be fine, what’s your name?”
“We think your body has a natural contraceptive.  It’s why Severus was using James’ blood in his work.  His body never developed a fetus from the times I couldn’t let him go, not
Sirius just nods and makes his way to the fireplace, mumbling about the situation.  Remus knew he could blow up before this was done and over with.  Draco had some things to prove to Harry’s family, and Remus was sure he’d be able to.  While Sirius was supportive, he was more overprotective than Remus had ever dared to be.  He left the boys to it and followed his mate, turning for the kitchen for breakfast.
There was no asking in the statement and Sirius knew it.  He also knew that Remus knew where Harry was, and it wasn’t the cottage.  They had only seen this situation once, well Harry’s reaction, and it was on James.  It was also something that Remus and he were going to have to tell the Malfoys, well Draco.  Remus would be better at it.
Questions and answers went back a forth, both about Harry and Draco as well as the trip the Gryffindor’s went on.  Harry was happy his friends found and healed the Granger’s without any lasting effects to the brain.  Hermione was upset about the process for Harry and Draco, more because of Molly Weasley.
“Just hot.”  Harry whispered back, trying to pay attention to the lecture.
“Don’t you fucking dare stop that.”
“All returning seventh years that should’ve graduated already will be in one dorm.  This is because there’s only about 10 of you guys.  Also more boys than girls.  Hermione will be sharing with Pansy and Lavender.  The eight boys will have one person in the bedroom with them.  Your godfather and I told a small amount of this summer to Minerva, who’s agreed to let you two be roomies.  You will have to be careful when boundaries are pushed because she is planning on watching you two more than the others returning.”
“This is true, Moony.  I would also back it, of course.  I can also brew so I can help.”  Sirius added.
Harry turned his head and looked at the door, now empty, and then back at the man he was still wrapped in.
Draco smiled and nodded.  “Alright, thank you, Harry.  So Friends?”
“You ready?”  Harry asked, putting his cup down and facing Draco.
They both laid down and just rested.  Draco didn’t fall asleep as Harry’s heat wouldn’t let him, but eventually they both wore out and sleep finally came to both of them.
Draco nodded and watched the door close.  He turned back to Theo, who was smiling.
“Yes, cub.  Don’t let her get to you today.  Harry, Gin and Neville, George, the rest...well, they know you and Ginny aren’t going to happen.  Let them handle Molly, alright?  You just have fun.”  Remus commented to his son.
He; however, was hoping Harry would tell him on his own.  Having reached the bath, Draco quickly turned on the water, letting it heat up he used the toilet and brushed his teeth.  A sigh left his lips as the water started to wake him the second he entered the tub.  The blonde twisted his body a bit, letting the muscles stretch as he started to lather his skin.  Taking the shampoo he was sharing with the others in the house, Draco quickly washed his hair and then turned the water off.  Grabbing the towel off the hook, he wrapped it around his waist, stepping out of the tub.  He smiled into the mirror as he dried off and slipped his black slacks up.  For him, they were more comfortable when studying potions.  He never figured out why, but the jeans tended to bunch and make his legs cramp up after a bit.  He walked out, having forgotten his shirt and made his way back to the room he shared with Harry.
Sirius nodded.  “Then I’m fine with it.”
“What do you want?”  Harry whispered, looking at the man laid out bare before him.
Draco smiled and kissed the hand he was holding before answering his boyfriend.
Sirius smiled.  “I’m not sure how many.  Charlus stayed here because he didn’t like all the flash the Potter Manor holds.  Godric’s Hollow was one and that’s one of the reason’s we hid you there.  It already had the magic of the family in it’s walls.  Also how it still stands.  We can go to Gringotts to see if you want.”
“Is it Draco?”  Remus whispered, letting out a sigh when Harry shook his head no.
Harry nodded.  “Yes.  And not just because of my feelings.  Besides, Hermione would be the only other who would probably be able to do this, and I don’t want to ask her.  I know she’d come back to help me, but she’s helped enough.  She needs to do what she’s doing for herself, and her parents.  I couldn’t ask her to abandon it.”
“Padfoot.”  Harry stated as he waved his wand to stop everything, the smoke clearing out.  After the smoke cleared, Harry laughed.  Sirius was covered in soot and coughing.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Thanks, Gin.  How’ve you been?  Haven’t gotten to talk to you for a while.”
“We are still getting to know each other, Draco.  If I didn’t need help with notes I didn’t know about till this morning, you wouldn’t know yet either.  Friends is a good way to start, but I don’t think I’d be opposed to anything else either.”
“What did you do to him?”
Remus stood in the doorway and watched the two young men sleeping in the floor.  It had been about three days since they had a break in the notes from the late Potions Master and the wolf knew his son was getting a bit overwhelmed with everything Severus had researched.  He had heard them talking, just last night about the effects of the contraceptive and the only way to really see if it would work.  He also knew they only spoke of it twice because of the blossoming relationship.  He had yet to tell Sirius that his cousin and godson were starting to push the boundary of friendship into something better, something each of them needed.  While Sirius was happy for Harry, he was also worried.  Worried that Draco would use him due to Lucius’ teachings when growing into the man that was currently laying next to their cub.
Draco nodded and turned to Remus.  “So with what the muggles did to Harry, he’s going to be more submissive.  Will he not be Harry?”
Both young men turned to see Remus standing with Narcissa.  Harry nodded and looked back at Draco.
Harry sighed.  “Maybe in time.  I don’t want to answer questions I don’t have answers to yet.”
He knew what it took his mate not to touch that woman.  He was also walking away, gleefully, since he wasn’t going to have to come to this blasted place anymore.
Harry sighed.  “I need you to decipher them.  Hermione’s out of the country with Ron, but I would have asked for you to help anyway.  Severus taught you everything, and I really need to know what’s in his notes and if you think it can be accomplished.”
Sirius sighed.  “That’s all any of us can do, really.  I swear, Moony, one wrong comment and I may hex the bitch.”
Harry shook his head.  “No, thank you Mandlshank.  However, I would like to see if one of the vaults has any journals on the history of our line?  There are some things I’m curious on.”
“Alright.  Who are you?”
Harry kiss his cheek and smiled.  “You wouldn’t be you if you didn’t, love.”
Harry watched as Draco thought on his suggestion, hoping he’d listen to what Harry was trying to say.  Harry watched as Draco smiled, just a small smile, and kissed Harry’s lips.
“What did she do?  Draco, what’s wrong?”  He whispered.
“Don’t know.”  Draco whispered as he led James to their room.
“Whatever you’re comfortable with, cub.”
He could hear that over and over, but Draco never came.  Never held him.  Never even stood where he could see him.  Harry was getting really worried and then a scream…
Harry blushed a bit and the woman got to work on Draco first.  They spent a few hours at the store, making sure the lady got everything that was needed.  She let them know that the robes would be ready in about three days.  Both men paid for the items and then headed home to enjoy a relaxing evening with their friends and family, Lucius and Narcissa included.
“Sirius thinks we should tell the Malfoy’s about James carrying you.  He thinks it’ll help Lucius with Draco’s contract.  Narcissa has told him that she doesn’t want Draco unhappy and married to someone he doesn’t want to be married to.  What do you think?”
