Harry has barely eaten, too anxious- or excited? He can't tell. He’s too busy watching Draco, watching how Draco slowly lowered his hand and placed it on top of Harry’s that sat on the table, watching how he doesn’t flinch away when Harry decides to hold his hand. How could this day get any better?
"Weasley, Ron!"  Ron slipped past his fellow students, making his way through the crowd. He climbed up the stairs, his knees feeling weak, he was anxious. He couldn't give a reason as to why he was anxious because there really wasn't a real reason for him to be, he knew his destiny already. He sat down as he did his gaze fell upon his siblings, all seated at the Gryffindor table, their fiery red hair against the Gryffindor robes. It looked like it was meant to be, his destiny was planned out for him and it made him mad.
Harry woke up to the feeling of sun violently in his eyes, a feeling all too familiar as he slept in a room who’s windows have no curtains. He reaches for his glasses and grabs them, clumsily slipping them onto his face.
Before Ron could open the other, smaller present his parents and brothers walked into the room, all of them having eyes on the green presents. Ron grabbed the pile that was for his family and handed each of them out ever so happily. "They're from the Malfoy's,  I got this pretty scarf. " Ginny added.
Harry reaches over to take Draco’s hand in his,  giving it a tight squeeze before asking him a question that's been on his mind for the past week. “ What now?”
“ I wouldn’t go up there, it’s James’ little lair. Last time I ventured up there well… I saw things I wish I didn't. Downstairs, on the other hand, is just my office, I… I have something down there I want to show you tomorrow. Your rooms are done, I left a set of pyjamas on the bed for you to use if you want to, feel free to transfigure them and uh, yeah. My room is just down from yours so if you need anything…”
“I’m an Alchemist, I mostly brew potions for health, that sort of thing. Ironic given this virus that’s going around. I was too busy brewing a lust potion… What about you? “ Harry’s eyebrows arch and he sits down, crossing his legs over one another. He’d used a few lust potions recently before he and Ginny divorced. Now there isn’t a need.
Softness is weakness, plain and simple. Though you should have her tell the story of my first bit of accidental magic. I feel as though you would find it incredibly humorous.
They had the locket now. Though they had escaped the cave and the army of infiri relatively unharmed, Harry was shaken. The potion, the pale hands, the freezing water-- Dumbledore Apperated them back to the top of the Astronomy Tower, and they were safe. Dumbledore ordered Harry to head to bed but once the boy was downstairs and in the shadows, he found himself frozen, unable to move or make a sound. Dumbledore cast a quick Notice-Me-Not spell over Harry as thundering footsteps rang out from the staircase.
"Bonjour! Did you find something?" He pecked his wife on the lips, a quick and casual kiss, and approached Draco. He hadn't spoken much to Remy at Sunday dinner, feeling overwhelmed as he was.
Something was wrong, here. Something was very wrong. Was this a dragon that had been raised on a foreign reserve? Or maybe on one of those ranches that he and Charlie hated because they skirted the law? Yes, technically they were legal, but only barely, seeing as the point of half of those ranches was to create half-breeds, or new breeds in general. It almost had Harry convinced that that old man had been
“Yes, I noticed,” he said quietly. Derrick’s eyes were a dark brown, like his father’s. Definitely not Harry’s jade green. Huh. Looking down to the little girl that was in his wife’s lap, Draco did his best to smile. “And… who’s this?” The little girl was grinning and laughing and already reaching for the plates and spoons. She had dark, straight hair pulled back into pigtails, and lighter skin than her father, though she did have freckles splattered across her face and arms. She was an adorable little thing, really. Derrick chuckled and put the little plastic baby spoon into her hand. “This is our daughter Morrigan, she’s two and a half.”
"Huh-ho, damn, jump back, kitty's got claws," she joked, curling her fingers to make a little claw in his direction.
Harry spent the night out in the waiting room, long after the receptionist had left and security had asked him to leave. He hadn’t left, curled up in a ball on the worn leather sofa, and security had left him alone. He needed to know Draco was alive and doing alright, even if that meant waiting until normal visiting hours opened at 10am. “Mr. Potter?” Jolting at hearing his name called, Harry looked up to the healer that was standing next to the sofa. “You… ought to come with us.”
“Well, see, we kinda weren't going to tell him until after they'd accepted and gotten over here. Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, yeah?”
“You don’t have your license to Apparate?” She turned to look at him just as the train rushed into the station, moving her halo of bushy hair with the wind from it.
She opened the door and they both stepped inside to find the room empty. Harry looked around, spying the perfectly made bed. “...where is he?”
Oh, what a nice little cafe. And a magical one, at that. It was a clear day, and Draco decided that having his lunch outdoors would be a nice treat. The café appeared to be a self-seating place, so Draco chose a table and sat down facing the street. It was a relatively nice day, for it being the end of winter. He decided he rather liked this cafe, and he'd have to visit it more often. Seeing a waiter come near him, Draco smiled and let the French roll off his tongue easily. "Hello, a pleasure."
“But, have you seen a dragon around here recently?” Legends wouldn't help him if he couldn't find the beast.
a production!" She grinned and pulled him close, giving him four kisses, two on each cheek. "Oh I am so glad you are here, Draco."
"Only a little bit. And it's okay, it's your first time." The train came to a stop and the doors opened, letting a few people off, and a few people on.
For now, I’ve bought myself an over-the-counter bottle, but soon I will be brewing my own, a practice which in Britain is frowned upon. Yet another reason to stay away.
“Of course, my love. I’ll bring you lunch and dinner as well. We’ve got to keep your strength up. Stay safe.” She was so kind… He would love to stay here indefinitely. She so reminded him of his mother. Oh his mother… He knew she would be worried. Certainly both her and Harry knew what tonight was. But he didn’t want to put either of them through this. They would insist on  being at his side, which meant they would have to watch, and… He couldn’t do that to them.
"I believe she got my work address, that would've been the easiest for her to find. Charmed Artifacts and Antiquities Department of le Ministère de la magie pour la France," she explained with a smile. "Of course, at the time, I didn't have great-grand-babies, and my husband was still alive. I only do consulting work for them now."
-also they don't treat him like a celebrity? cos they don't know the stuff he's done? and he likes how normal they're treating him?
Karamo sat back at his desk, amazed at the heartfelt and heavy letter in his hand. There was so much information to sort through… but he knew what he had to do first.
Dinner with Narcissa Malfoy… does one dress up for it? Robes, or would nice Muggle clothes do? Christ— Harry would be getting an earful from Draco right now… He'd ask Blaise or Pansy, but they'd just take the piss or give bad advice on purpose. Harry could already hear Hermione’s voice in his head. ‘
Setting down his cooking supplies Harry turned round properly towards her, frowning. “All due respect, Mrs. Malfoy, you allowed your own son to be branded by a murderer and a tyrant. I really don’t know if you have any room to talk.”
Welp! Hope you're on the edge of your seat! From here on out, it's all chaos. Abandon canon, all ye who enter here!
When he arrived, he was told by a nice nurse that he was too early for visiting hours. He simply smiled at him and prepared to spend 30 minutes in an uncomfortable hospital waiting room, but could see the moment the hospital staff realized exactly who he was.
“Great aunt, that’d be…” Harry thought it over, trying to put the pieces together in his head. “His grand-dad’s sister?”
“Heh, yeah. Most of the time, my aunt just didn’t want to cook, so she taught me to cook when I was little, except if something big was happening. Then she would just make sure I stayed out of the way.”
Draco! Thinking about this, and about you, definitely set me up to take the pictures I've sent along with this letter.
I’ll bet wandless magic gets you hot under the collar, doesn’t it love? I think we’ll have to thoroughly test that. And dammit, you send me the most gorgeous smelling, softest jumper in existence and then tell me I can’t bloody come until your next letter! Eh, either way, I had a good few snuggles with it in my wolf form.
It should be noted that we had correctly guessed who our opposite partner was before the reveal! Keep an eye open, because we're not done with this story! We've discussed what was happening outside their letters quite a bit in conversations and a lot went on there that we didn't add to this exchange. So we're RPing an accompanying fic. If ya love it, scream in the comments with us! ~M
Harry decided to approach the dragon. He was a magizoologist for Merlin’s sake, this was his job. He carefully moved closer to where the dragon had fallen, holding his hands up in a classic I’m-not-going-to-hurt-you gesture. It wouldn’t have mattered what he was doing, because the dragon was no longer looking in his direction. Instead, the dragon had turned his head towards the ground and looked like it was trying to burrow under.
The dragon was staring at Harry now, seemingly hanging on his every word. Harry knew that he had the dragon now, that it wouldn’t be long before he would be able to get close enough to heal his wounds. Just a few more minutes should do it…
"So that at least one of us could be the prepared one?" Draco was smirking back at him like this was all some silly kids' game.
Harry reached into his pack and started to pull out a nice healing salve that he’d brought with him. It healed just about anything, above or below the surface. He didn’t see much wrong on the surface, so maybe the poor thing just twisted a wing. “Normally, he’s constantly working. I heard there’s been a bet going around recently of what his longest shift’s been. Highest number so far is 78 hours, the lowest is 15. Tells you what we all think of him, doesn’t it?”
“Still is a bit tricky I suppose, when I see him around the Ministry. It’s not like I have to pretend to hate him any more, everyone’s over that now, but Merlin, I can’t have him knowing I’ve got a little thing for him, he’d never let me live it down.”
“I hadn’t known he ran, but it makes sense, of course.” Harry let her out of the hug and took his seat again, snuggling himself into the squashed teal armchair he’d claimed as his own. He picked up his mug of tea and held it close.
I'd like to see your face for our first time. I'd move you to our bed and spread you out over the sheets. I'd kiss your cheek as I push in, I want to hear all your sweet sounds. I'd just hold myself there, pushed deep inside you, try to memorize the feeling, even as you work your hips to try and get me to move. I don't know yet how I'd fuck you, Draco. Slow and steady? Every thrust deep and purposeful? Fast and hard and filthy? I'll decide in the heat of the moment I suppose. I'll make sure you're more than ready to take it, and I promise I'll more than satisfy you, my love.
“Me- No, no, I- I have no need for anything such as that,” he quickly told them, shaking his head before sipping on his wine to hide his blush.
“Right.” They seemed to appraise each other for another minute. Sebastien took off his jacket— my, that was a lot of tattoos. “What’s for dinner, then?”
“Oh… Well- Well, it’s really nothing all that exciting. If you’ve heard one Auror case, you’ve heard them all, really-” He didn’t want to talk about his cases… the last one had gone so terribly and it was too fresh in his mind. “So much of it is paperwork—”
He glanced between the toddler munching on his lunch and his cousin standing at the counter. "...whatever your accident was, I hope you're healing well, Valerie."
They'd finished up a long, arduous case and, to celebrate, they'd had dinner at Harry's. He had cooked, Draco brought wine, there was some whiskey with dessert… and Harry had kissed him. In fact, it had been a bit more than kissing. Harry had loved the feel of Draco under his hands, just as he loved Draco's hands on him. Harry had thought they might head to bed… but Draco had pulled back, muttered some half-apology, and was through Harry's Floo before he'd even known what was going on.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. What— what a sweet picture. He cleared his throat as he felt tears well up. He caught Narcissa’s eye and she nodded. “I know… he’s gorgeous, isn’t he?”
When he got down to the kitchen, he bowed his head. “I wanted to thank you. Again. For… everything.” She approached him, wiping her hands on her apron.
these days!” He turned the corner and grinned when he saw her, halfway through someone’s new Christmas sweater. She let the magic needles take over and pulled him into a tight hug.
“Hi Molly, it’s just me,” he called back, brushing a bit of soot from his tee shirt. Luckily, his hair was still alright. “Are you busy?”
Fucking Merlin, you’ve got a mouth on you, don’t you? Well, hand in this case. I’d much rather it were on me, right now. How about this. Once you get this letter, go back to your bed, go on and strip. You want to be good for me, don’t you? Go on, tease yourself a bit. Twist your nipple. Pretend it’s me doing it. I’d drag a hand down your side, then just barely let my fingertips brush your cock. Only barely, though, can’t be too quick about it, after all. It’s always so much better when we draw it out, isn’t it?
It got pretty-- erm, steamy. I got so hot and bothered my bloody glasses fogged up at the thought of my mouth on your cock, or yours on my hole. I have to wonder, because ever since I've been able to achieve the Animagus shift, I've been more randy than a, well, a dog. Maybe my wolf needs its mate, hm?
Harry winced. "You're practically having pudding in your tea, Draco." Disgusting. Painfully endearing. "Are you done with your sugar?"
“Yes I did. We had a good talk about it, too,” Gabriel mused, leaning over to kiss his husband’s freckled cheek. “But in the end, I just did what felt right. Besides, Uncle Alistair took his wife’s family name.”
The room transformed before Draco's very eyes. Vincent and Gregory were lost-- already gone-- and the Room of Lost Things became a simple stone dungeon. Anything that was on fire in the Room of Lost Things came there, complete with the diadem of Ravenclaw. Draco watched as the 5th piece of Voldemort's soul was destroyed.
My potion is actually going rather well. It's still in one of the brewing stages, now. Have they registered me, yet? I keep looking over my shoulder expecting an owl with a letter reprimanding me for not following procedure, and for leaving the country.
“Just like my son. He puts off Sunday dinners til the last moment. There’s a lot of… interaction, one might say. He’s better off in small groups or pairs. I wonder if you’re the same way.” Right, then. Draco was officially uncomfortable with these people who seemed to know him like the back of their hand after only having met him once. What was with that? There was no possible way he was so easy to read.
Thinking back to previous scared animals that he’d helped, Harry sat himself down at the edge of the clearing, just inside the tree line. The dragon needed to get used to him, to realise that he wasn’t a threat. Harry placed his wand on the ground beside him, just slightly too far away to be able to grab it quickly, a clear sign of peaceful intent that the dragon should be able to interpret.
She sat him down on the couch across from her. “I’m well, dear, but as I said, it’s been very quiet. The kind of life you live, raising seven little ones, you’re not accustomed to the quiet, even if it has been a few years.”
Husband and wife faced each other, pointedly not looking at the body of their son, now lying still as a statue on the long mahogany table. “Untraceable international portkey,” Lucius rasped, raising a hand to rub over his stubbled chin. “It will be delivered by Floo in the next 15 minutes, according to Kershaw. Portkey takes us to Concord, we Apperate to Amherst.” To the secret family estate in New Hampshire. It had been a wedding present from a well-off uncle of Lucius’ mother and therefore did not bear the Malfoy name-- it would be untraceable, should the Dark Lord or Dumbledore come looking for them. It would be their safe haven. They would bury their son there.
"He's just finishing one up back there, go on ahead. This one was a fainter." Oh… Draco had nearly passed out while taking the Mark… He wasn’t sure why someone would do that to themselves, especially voluntarily and for the art. Valerie tapped his shoulder and broke the trance.
"The Mandrake leaf, generously supplied to you by Professor Longbottom, is the first step to seeing and therefore tapping into your magical core. Some say it causes hallucinations for Muggles or those with weak cores. You have nothing to worry about on that front." Harry gulped.
(P.S. I know France probably has excellent chocolate, but this was Remus’ favorite kind… maybe you'll like it too?)
"You can still like something and find it interesting even if you don't necessarily have a need for it," Sapphire assured him with a tilt of her head.
“Oh, Harry. Everything you’ve been through, but you still refuse to open your mind.” Open his… That sounded like something Trelawney would have said.
It was a tactic that had worked well for him before. It seemed as though dragons found his voice soothing, and at times he’d even had the feeling that they could understand him.
Percy Weasley caught the minister with a nasty hex and grinned. “Hello minister, did I mention I'm resigning?” The twins laughed-- and Draco used all his concentration to push Fred Weasley out of the way of Dolohov's killing curse. The green curse scorched the ground where he stood only moments before.
Harry was stunned for a moment. Had Draco’s mother actually… kissed his head? Cupped his face? He wasn’t entirely sure what to make of it. (He hadn’t thought she’d actually liked him very much. More like tolerated him for Draco’s sake.) “I’ll do my best. I want him home, too.”
“Leesy!” Narcissa called, voice a touch strangled. The crack of a house elf echoed through the entrance hall on the tail end of its name.
“Potter! Please tell me you didn't get a snitch tattooed recently!” Draco pleaded, face and neck quickly pinking.
"Oui, perfect, I am starved. I've been repairing an antique since five this morning. Only two cups of coffee, can you believe it? It's a very bad habit, I know, but this watch is amazing. 1847, Draco! 1847 this watch was made."
The Holyhead Harpies haven’t been doing poorly this year, though I can’t wait to see how they fare against the Quaffle Punchers. They’ve been having a spectacular season, you know. I am surprised that you never went professional. The call and allure of crime-stopping and Dark wizard-chasing was too much for you, was it?
“It’s, um… I’m not planning on courting a girl, Molly… I want to court a man.” Molly’s knitting paused before she was back to it.
“Believe me, I have a few words of my own for him. Thanks for the tea, Narcissa… I’ll tell you if I find him. Send me an owl if he shows up here first? Just to ease my mind, you know?”
was a total disaster, and we were incredibly underprepared for when things went wrong… I had no idea it was a full moon…
Harry shook his head. “No, I figured I’d try here first. And you needed to know. I… I don’t know if Draco would want me to tell Blaise and Pansy. He’d want to do that himself.”
Now that the students have left for the summer, Draco fully allowed himself to wander the halls, to float more than a few inches off the floor and get used to his new baseline for normal. Myrtle wasn't much for roaming the halls-- she much prefered to travel via pipe, which Draco couldn't bring himself to try-- so he wandered alone.
He thought about it, nodding along. “Yeah, I can smell most everyone else’s fine, but not mine. I don’t think Draco can really feel his own magic all that well, either.”
As soon as Harry started moving, the dragon made a high-pitched screech and moved its injured wing down, trapping Harry under it. Harry immediately froze and did his best to control his breathing, afraid that the smallest movement would set the dragon off again.
We had a lot of fun writing this! For a majority of the exchange, neither of us knew who the other was, but we still were able to write this amazing fic, and now we get to share it with everyone else! We hope you guys enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it. ~Kas
Harry let out a little sigh of relief and shrugged a bit. “I’m not sure yet… He’s got good taste, and I want him to like it, so I’m asking around… for inspiration, I guess.”
. Not to mention that Draco had absolutely atoned for his sins with how many cases they'd solved with his quick thinking. Some people just couldn't
-this makes explaining a few things kinda difficult, but it also leads to some funny bits of Harry trying to cover up the magic in his life from 5 well-meaning gay guys
She took hold of his hand and pulled him up into the train. "Hey, it's alright. Just surprised Derrick didn't also mention that I didn't have it, too." She squeezed his hand. "I'm okay, really." The train sped out of the station, and Draco lurched to catch his footing.
He positioned the wine bottle carefully on his desk, away from his letters and Blaise's bird. Wand in hand, he very carefully pictured Blaise's kitchen in his mind and waved his wand. The bottle disappeared.
Soft light filtered into the entry hall of Chateau Malfoy. It was beautiful in the Loire Valley this time of year, but neither Lucius nor Narcissa noticed. They were still in a daze, despite the body of their son levitating about two feet from the carpeted stone floor. They could not grieve yet-- they had plans to make, as quickly as could be made. They could not return to their home in Wiltshire, and it was risky to stay at the Chateau for too long. France was simply too close to the action, to the danger. They would have to move.
Searching desperately for something, anything to say, Harry found himself saying to the dragon, “You know who I bet would love to see you?”
If it means so much to you, then I suppose I can send you a little present. Just do try not to get your spunk all over it, yes? That’s an
"It is not something that comes naturally to most. Someone who is particularly sensitive to magic might catch a whiff or two, if they have not honed in on the skill."
“Yeah. We all got busy. I know. What about you, with Auror business?” Right, could not really talk about that, could he?
“My… magical core?” Alright, Harry would be the first to admit he hardly knew what that was. He might have remembered it being mentioned at Hogwarts once or twice.
consisted of creating child soldiers and allowing practically four graduating years of students to be killed.”
They were outside, perhaps in the Black Manor gardens. It looked like summer. A little boy dashed into the frame, holding up a frog to Andromeda, who was behind the camera. His huge grin was missing a tooth or two and his dark hair was an absolute mess. His eyes were alight with mischief and joy, and that’s when it clicked for Harry.
He headed home, mind already turning back to the topic of the research paper he was currently working on, a dissertation on the social behaviour of fire dwelling salamanders.
Remus Lupin and Draco's cousin sat near the end of the hall, sharing a blanket and looking a bit worse for wear-- she'd have a scar or two to match his, no doubt.
Softness is weakness, plain and simple. Though you should have her tell the story of my first bit of accidental magic. I feel as though you would find it incredibly humorous.
Every ghost that called Hogwarts home was gathered in the 6th floor toilets, talking quietly to each other. Each one of them had felt a pull in their chests they couldn’t ignore, a pull that summoned them to the tiled room. It looked more like a cathedral in this moment, so filled with people in fine silver garments.
“This is… For what it's worth, I am deeply sorry for what you are about to see.” Was that a hitch in her voice? The married couple shared a look and a sinking feeling settled in both their stomachs. They ascended the stairs and opened the door.
Just because I'm not well-versed in BDSM doesn't mean I'm not a Gryffindor. I was a bit busy fighting a war and catching bad guys and not realizing the two of us were dating to experiment much. Please forgive me, darling. I'll definitely take those books from Pansy.
"There were articles written about you, since your war. Your tragic story, your trial— oh we were so pleased when you were acquitted. And then your sparkling Auror career, paired with Harry Potter no less!"
Gin has invited us to the Harpies/Quaffle Punchers game, and she's bet that the Harpies will win, by at least 160 points. Send your reply to the bet in your next letter to Luna, will you?
“Perhaps she ought to sample other bottles, if you get my meaning. Plenty of lovely men and women in Paris, you know.”
“You’re getting a few new little ones, don’t worry… and most of us aren’t very far.” He felt bad… she was probably as lonely as him and Narcissa. Probably even more so.
She approached him and wrapped her arm around his waist, resting her other hand on his arm. She held him close and looked into the mirror with him. "Yes, you are. You are our boy, just like Gabriel, Sebastien, and Derrick. You're our family." He watched as his eyes glistened in the mirror, hand still resting on the pendant. If only Harry could see him now. Crying like a child at the slightest provocation. Git would probably be sniffling and dabbing at his eyes with the edge of his sleeve.
I am curious to say, how has your animagus training been coming along? Have you discovered what your form will be, yet? I’m ashamed to say I don’t know much of that branch of magic. You don’t get to choose what you become, do you? I have to say, I would be beside myself with laughter if you were to become a cat. Or, say — a peacock? They were just so awfully fond of you at the Manor, chasing you whenever you stepped foot in the yard.
“You- You know my Auntie Droma?” How on Earth- They were supposed to be Malfoys! How on Earth did they know Andromeda
“A… Abraxas?” Draco stared at him, and… Now that he was looking, he could see a few of the Malfoy features. “He’s my grandfather. We lost him to-”
Narcissa nodded along as she picked up her spoon and took a small sip of her own soup. “Oh, I’m certain you eat just as much as he does." Harry copied her motions, ladling a bit of soup into his mouth. In all honesty, he had to suppress a groan of delight.
"I think it would be good for you and Mr. Malfoy, as well as the student body. The Gryffindor-Slytherin relations are still nonexistent." Ah, now it was all making sense.
“Just window shopping today, I suppose. What have you got?” She raised a sculpted eyebrow at him and smirked.
[[Two pictures are enclosed within this letter. They both show Draco from a side view, the man on all fours on his bed, with a larger toy seeming to fuck him soundly, not that there’s sound to the pictures. The second picture, however, shows him cumming spectacularly across the bed sheets as his front half falls down onto the bed, the dildo still continuing its motions.]]
At least she seemed to take delight in the mix-up. “I do. Tristan’s dad. He didn’t stick around long after the announcement came.”
I am glad that Teddy seems enthusiastic about staying with us, though. However, I do require one condition. I get final say on what colors his room is painted. If I have to look at the walls of that room every day, I will
“Alright.” Why couldn’t they just Apparate? This family was just confusing sometimes. The only reason they couldn’t Apparate would be…
Harry hurried down the hill, trying to keep himself on his toes. It wouldn’t be easy for a dragon to sneak up on him, especially in a forest full of branches to crack and leaves to rustle, but stranger things had happened in his life. Hearing a low, crooning sound, he froze and looked over his shoulder. Nothing that he could see. In fact, it sounded like it came from in front of him, just behind the cropping of bushes. Taking his wand out, he pointed it at the bushes and cast, “
“You know? It’s funny… I’m trying to imagine my life without him in it… and I can’t seem to do it. I definitely don’t think I could continue being an Auror if he wasn’t my partner.” And already Harry knew that Draco probably couldn’t return to the force. As understanding and accommodating as Robards and Ron were… plenty of people would raise issues with a werewolf in the Aurors, even with all the progressive creatures’ rights bills that Hermione was putting up in the Wizengamot.
Narcissa laughed. “Oh, he does do a bit of that, yes. But you know he means well.” Well… Sometimes, yeah. How often did Draco make an insult into some roundabout compliment? Left-handed compliments were deeply embedded in upper class British society, and apparently that weren't for Muggles and magical aristocrats alike.
Draco allowed himself to be pulled away, now faced with another person, definitely a Malfoy, and someone else that looked to be Irish, if he had to put a guess, especially going by the red hair and freckles.
She smiled, rubbing his arm. “I saw it, Harry.” He still didn’t understand what that was supposed to mean. She ‘saw’ it.
Harry was up bright and early the next morning, used to waking up before the sun to study the various creatures that constituted his work. He wanted to have a chance to go over the case file from the Ministry once more before heading to the hospital. He stopped by his favourite pastry shop near St.Mungo’s and picked up a chocolate croissant.
And thank you for the teaching compliment. I'll admit, I'm a bit nervous about having to give tests and assign more work besides just "practice when you can". But we'll be alright.
-he's got ptsd, amongst other things, and has kind of become a recluse in the past few years, but wants to look/feel/live good for the reunion
He didn't tell Ron or Hermione about the incident-- he didn't want Ron's heavy claps on the back for humbling Malfoy, nor Hermione's commentary on the legality of non-sanctioned dueling on the grounds. Besides, he figured Snape would be docking dozens of  points from Gryffindor soon enough for it, and Harry would explain himself then.
“Mr. Weasley, you have a guest here,” the nurse announced, knocking lightly and then pushing the door open.
“Yeah. I can go for lavender. How’s… You know. Life?” She smiled her sweet serene smile and conjured the cup he always seemed to use when he was over at their flat. She poured the tea and hummed a bit to herself, wiping her hands on her multicolored apron.
“I try to regret as few things in my life as possible, Potter, but leaving you in that house with those people is one of my biggest regrets. The other is that I allowed Sirius Black to be put in Azkaban and did not look for the truth.” She replaced her spectacles and looked at him. “You are probably very tired of apologies by now, but humor me with this last one. I know Albus’ ultimate goal was to win the war… but I apologize for not trying harder to make sure you and your loved ones were protected.”
Three… Potter was currently pacing in the hall outside, requesting a room to find a horcrux. The room and indeed the castle itself told Draco so, as if it were asking Draco's final permission to allow Potter in. After all, the castle had witnessed his death. It had been the only witness, really.
The file was relatively short on details, providing Harry with only the bare bones of the case, and it soon became clear that the first step in his investigation would involve speaking to Charlie. As an experienced dragonologist, Charlie would be able to provide Harry with specific information about the dragon that would hopefully speed up the early stages of his investigation. Harry decided to give Charlie a little more time to recover from the attack before bombarding him with questions, but resolved to head back to the hospital in the morning.
“No, no, it is all in the past, I suppose.” He sighed and looked at Draco again. “But what are you doing in Paris? Here on a holiday? You
“Oh, darling.” That was a little nice, he guessed. She was rubbing at his arm, apparently trying to comfort him? He didn’t really think he needed comforting, but the thought was nice.
“I see. Hopefully we will be more careful, then.” She put her letter aside and folded her hands atop the desk. “Well, Potter, as I’m sure you’ve read, arguably the most important part of the Animagus process is finding the animal that resides inside you, that resonates with your soul and your magical core.”
” Brushing them to the side nearly silently, he heard a thick crack and the same sound as before followed immediately after.
“Maybe he doesn’t… but he’d miss you every day, and he’d be heartbroken for a long time. Just because we’re grown up doesn’t mean we don’t need someone to love us.” Now it was Narcissa pulling him close and… And did she just…?
I think you would've liked wearing my Quidditch jersey, even if we hadn't gotten together. Maybe you'd have come by the locker rooms and asked for a signature, and we could've had a nice shag in the showers. You'd have been screaming my name at one point or another, darling.
Draco found himself laughing with him. “I think that sounds lovely.” They continued their meal in silence for a bit, enjoying the early spring sunlight and watching the people go by. Draco was on his second glass of chilled Pinot gris when Sapphire cleared her throat and caught his attention.
to register with the Ministry. They'll blacklist me. You really think they'll be perfectly fine with allowing a werewolf to be an Auror? At best I'll be moved to desk duty until they eventually push me to quit. I understand that your friends have been actively working against the werewolf legislation, but we still have quite a long way to go. I'll most likely be sacked, and no job will take me after that. Ex-Death Eater
“No, he doesn’t, and I would advise against going after him. You know how he is, dear. The second you find him, he’ll run farther and faster.”
But Draco had saved a good number of lives that afternoon… Fred Weasley and his twin brother were quietly talking, away from their family, each asking the other what exactly he had seen; who had cast that killing curse?
Hogwarts was already at war, the sounds and explosions of duels rang through the grounds. For now, the wards held, but it wouldn't be for long. And then the school would be swarming with Death Eaters.
I'm sure I can convince Teddy that pastels are better for walls, and the bright colors can stay in his hair. I think the purple and turquoise will be nice. He'll need a room similar in Hogwarts, too, you know. I'll leave the decorating of our quarters to you, so long as everything isn't emerald green. Pastels for us, too? And of course you're a cuddler… the thought of snuggling you and Teddy by the fire warms my heart. Oh Draco, can you imagine our first Christmas with him as our son? I imagine we'll end up spoiling him, won't we?
Thankfully, it seemed Draco didn’t much have to worry about meeting many other ‘family’ as they seemed to be out of town. Of course, dinner and dessert didn’t let Gwen forget what she’d told him earlier. Cake and dessert wine all consumed, Draco suddenly realized that he wouldn’t be leaving with everyone else that night. He’d return to the hotel in the morning to gather his things and check out… to move into his great-aunt’s spare room. Unable to help it, Draco found himself fidgeting, hearing his father’s voice in his head telling him it was most undignified, but not finding it within himself to care much. This was all a bit much. That, and imagining his father made him think of what he’d do if he ever found out about his rogue, casual army of cousins. Maybe he’d die of a heart attack. Or a stroke. “Draco, dear? Are you alright?”
She lets you call her “Aunt Andy”? Mother lets you call her that? I still have to call her “Aunt Andromeda”! Of all the indignities! Apparently you get to be a real part of the family, don’t you. And I’m not even there for it. Of all the wrongs of the world…
That… does sound bloody wonderful, but you know how dangerous it would be, and not just because of my new condition. You know that the Wizarding World of Britain at large would still rather see me in Azkaban, exiled completely, or dead. And you’re the Savior of the Wizarding World. You don’t think we wouldn’t get any backlash from something like that? People hearing that I was up for Auror training was bad enough. We’d be having to check for letter curses for weeks.
She folded her hands in her lap and was silent for a minute. “...blood wards, of the kind Dumbledore described to you, do not work. Your mother’s sister would have needed to agree to them, as well as offer her own blood and magic, neither of which she did, I assume.” She looked up at Harry, calm as anything. “Do you know how magical godparents are officially chosen?”
“No, no, Harry, it’s fine, I’m just with a friend,” she called back, pausing in her tapping the magicked ink into Draco’s skin. “Do you mind if he keeps us company? Might be a good distraction for when I work closer to your spine…” She lowered her voice, so Harry couldn’t hear.
“Ah… that’s Devin for you, I suppose. I’m sure they’re all very different from any family or friends that you have back home, yes?”
The thought of Harry dragging him off for that… was agony. Though Granger and her colleagues were working towards drastic reform towards the rights and treatment of creatures, he would most likely be captured and branded before the week was out. Draco shook his head. He needed to get himself out of this room. Maybe go shopping. Shopping might help make him feel better. Maybe get him back to his old self. After all, he hadn't packed very much, he could afford to go on a bit of a spree. He'd need more parchment soon and it would be wise to pick up more ink-- and that wasn't even the most fun bit of shopping.
What would my mother think? I could hardly handle the transformation, I don’t want to put that on her, having to witness it. I’m completely trapped. I want to come home.
“Hmm, yes. Imagine if they tried to use alliteration.” The older ghost chuckles quietly. “Your name doesn't really lend itself well to that.”
There are SO many ways I could do this, but I've narrowed it down to 3 choices for you all to vote on!
Letter written, he set it on the table. “Be a pet and take that back to him once you’re rested, yes?” He smoothed down the owl’s feathers as he smiled to himself. The owl nibbled at Draco's fingers a bit and blinked one eye, then the other. Curious little bird, Blaise's owl. He'd have to sort out the wine, perhaps a timed, unmanned portkey? He didn't want it to discolor, and he didn't want to tire out the poor bird. Perhaps, if he focused hard enough, he may be able to Banish it to Blaise’s flat? Well. Nothing for it but to try.
Narcissa smiled as she held out a vial. “It’s already set, dear. Let’s go, then.” They watched as the silver strands pooled and curled around each other in the vial, and they went upstairs to where Narcissa's pensieve was set up. She poured it into the shallow bowl and took Harry's hand in her own, giving it a comforting squeeze. They both bent down and were submerged in the memory.
“That sounds nice,” he said, relaxing into the touch. It was… nice. Warm. Not shocking like the cheek kisses. He quite liked that.
"Draco, lovely to see you." She gently held his shoulders and greeting him with cheek kisses. Draco begrudgingly smiled at the greeting that was starting to grow on him.
Draco gave himself a few moments, and once he was certain his cheeks were no longer splotchy and his eyes no longer red, he strode back out to the main room- “Sorry, sorry, I know I’m late, Floo networks were all backed… up…”
Neville looked up from where it looked like he was replanting some devil’s snare. “Harry, what’re you doing here?”
“Of course, Mr. Potter. I’ll see you next week for your lesson. And do mention my offer to Mr. Malfoy as soon as possible.”
He wandered downstairs to find the bell for his Floo ringing madly. "Request to Floo from Narcissa Black, at Malfoy Manor," the tinny feminine voice announced, when Harry got close enough. "Request granted, Master Potter?"
“But it’s not a part of my… of my courting Draco, is it? It seems a bit… specific to our situation.”
“Draco Malfoy,” he said. Certainly he could be safe, here. The Parisians wouldn’t know his name. “I’m afraid I haven’t heard of your nephew.”
The wards easily allowed them onto the grounds. They picked a place under the apple tree on the edge of the gardens, a nice distance away from the manicured back lawn of the estate. A few flicks of her wand and Narcissa dug a grave and lowered the body and so buried her baby boy. A headstone was erected in pale and perfect marble. ‘Draco Lucius Malfoy. Born June 5, 1980, Died May 8, 1997. Beloved son.’
Please, disregard my last letter. I wrote that the morning after the full moon. I wasn’t in my right mind. And please —  forget I said anything about your —
Harry was grateful when the Floo let him through and he stepped out, right in front of McGonagall. "Mr. Potter. What an unexpected surprise."
Sapphire took another sip of her wine. “Has she mentioned anything about possible moon sensitivity? He’s growing up quickly, you know.”
I've been telling you for ages now, you berk, that she'd adore you, and of course, it takes me being bitten and running away that gets you to see that. Ever the dramatic one, you are.
“I’m sorry, Harry. You’re right, about most things, and my goal was not to start a fight with you. Though, I must commend you for not backing down.” She turned him so that he’d face her. “You are so very
That had Harry frowning. "I got a letter from someone claiming to be Draco's great aunt from his dad's side." Narcissa’s features sharpened and she held out her hand, silently demanding to see the letter, which Harry immediately gave her.
“I don’t see why not. If he’s there, you’ll have confirmation he’s fine. If he’s not there, you have good reason to worry. If you see him, be sure to send him my way, yes? I have words for him.”
"Oh-" She paused, taking a moment or two to blow on her nails, pausing for time. "Right. He must be worried for you, if you left that quickly."
“Lunch, please!” He grabbed two handfuls of Gwen’s skirt and held on tight, looking up at her with a smile and bright eyes.
“You’re still going on about that? You’ve really got to leave some things in the past. We get it. You’re the Boy Who Lived Twice,” Draco teased him, leaning over to pick up the file. “Interesting, though I don’t see why they’re sending us.”
Please, don’t compare me to my father, I’ve had plenty enough of that for my lifetime. As I’m sure you have, as well.
“I think Ron was disappointed that we weren’t going to be Aurors together like he wanted us to be, but I think I’m glad. I like taking care of animals like you, you know. You’re a lot less complicated than people.” Alright, he had the collar, now he just had to put it on.
Later that night, after spending more time with ‘the family’ and exploring their personal library, Draco went back into his bedroom for the night and saw the shirt still lying there on his bed.
"First, I have to get him back… and when I do, I'm going to make sure he knows exactly how I feel, so he doesn't have to be afraid of us being together."
"We are surrounded by our own magic at all times, we become a bit blind to it. Nose-blind, if you will." She smiled at him, dark eyes sparkling. "Go ahead, Potter. Leaf in your mouth at your leisure."
"Aha, but I did get your number, didn't I?" He leaned in again and kissed her cheek. As he did so, little miss Morrigan, who had alfredo sauce around her mouth and on her hands, basically latched herself onto the front of her father's shirt.
“Underground train system? You Brits have one in London, I think you call it “The Tube.” What a silly name.”
“Well, my mother is a Malfoy. Or, well, was. She was disowned long before you or I were born.” He tilted his head a bit and focused on Draco’s face. “Abraxas was my uncle, though I never met him.”
“What? No- No, in my third year. I watched Lupin transform. He forgot it was the full moon…” Harry waved his hand, not entirely sure how to finish. She stared at him for a few moments, as if not entirely sure what to say.
"Absolutely. I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to achieve your Animagus form. However, this process requires immense amounts of concentration, self-reflection, and meditation. And you and I both know, Potter, that you are not the most patient of men."
Harry watched him, and saw how he kept rolling his shoulders, like his shoulders were in pain, or… Or the point where his wing connected to his back. “Hey, are you okay? You were hurt earlier-” Harry had started to walk towards Draco, hands out towards him to try to help, but Draco snapped around to glare viciously at him, and Harry was scared he may still get hit with a fireball.
He can't help but chuckle, because the definitely sounded like Draco. "He must make me sound like some kind of barbarian, huh? Not everyone can be as graceful. Really, I'm just a bit clumsy and headstrong, that's all." He paused for a moment. "I can be gentle."
Meanwhile, I have to add that Minerva is thrilled we're seriously considering her offer. She might've mentioned the positive potential of the heads of Gryffindor and Slytherin in a romantic relationship. How she figured us out, I'll never know. She's also requested you start to think of her as Minerva as well. (I think she's already decided we'll soon be part of the staff. That's fine by me, I hope it is with you!)
“Sport shoes? Casual, not made of high quality leather, relatively cheap and easy to replace?” Draco shook his head, and Bas nodded, looking over at his sister. “Converse.”
"No no, don't take offense, it's only a joke. Gisele has told us multiple times that it will never, ever happen. The going joke is even Sebastien will marry before she does."
"I know, dear. Draco has always had an inclination for elaborate and fanciful exaggeration." He did, didn't he? It seemed like Draco just loved to blow everything out of proportion. He had to wonder why that was.
The thought of Bellatrix as a young child threw him for a loop, as did the thought of Andy and Narcissa even younger than her. He led her into the cozy breakfast nook where their tea was set-up. "Do you have any pictures? Of anything from when you were a little girl?" The underlying question is
“Also… I was briefly engaged to Alphard Black before I was disowned and eloped with my late-husband.”
“Yeah, sure mate, what do you need? I mean- I can be your best man if you want, I just thought you’d get Ron-”
Like hell I'm leaving you alone! This is as much my fault as anything. I was stupid, and leapt without looking, as per fucking usual. I didn't protect you like I should've and now you've run off to France of all places! I don't bloody want a new partner, I want you back. You're practically the only one that can handle me…
The Dark Lord had seized control of the Manor over the past summer, nearly a year under his control now. Lucius was forced to play host to at least a dozen of Voldemort's elite and most trusted followers, feeding them, housing them, all while under constant ridicule and surveillance of the evil madman.
Harry ran his hands through his hair— messing it up even more than normal. “Have I told you your son is infuriating? No, I won’t go after him. Besides, I’d probably end up lost in the French countryside, and where would we be then?”
Draco Malfoy, I should’ve known you were a size queen. Those pictures, you naughty thing, you. Did you charm it to fuck you into a second orgasm? Til you had tears in those gorgeous eyes and you were begging for mercy? Well it filled you up nicely, that much was obvious. I have a feeling I’ll be able to keep up with you, though.
“Hiya, Nev. What have you got growing here?” He stood next to his friend and put his hands on his hips, looking over the garden.
“A pair of robes, huh?” Well… he supposed that did give him an idea. Gods, Draco would look so good in midnight blue, especially up against his pale skin. And Harry would have such a good time helping him
A cousin on each side of him, they left the shop after Bas’ client had settled up. “Okay, first things first, Val. Start from the bottom, or the top?” Bas arched an eyebrow and fully took in his cousin. “You have good taste, but… this is something you’d wear on a date.”
“Mm, yes she reached out to me a few years ago, I forget why or even how she found me. She mentioned that her sister, your mother, had married my nephew, and I replied that I knew. I consider her a friend, though we’ve never met in person. Nearly, oh… must be almost a decade now. Long before her daughter got married and had little Teddy.”
Albus bit his lip and stroked his beard, closing his eyes for a minute to think. Even in death, it seemed that Draco Malfoy would ruin his plans. “Heal his wounds, Poppy. We cannot deliver him to his parents in this state.”
"I was endearing as hell," he said, like it was a known fact. "I picked them up-- most of them, and I paid for my strawberries, my ego only
“In the kitchen, Harry!” Ah, how was he not surprised? The two of them spent more time in the kitchen nowadays than any other room in the house, Harry suspected. They were both still in pajamas and bathrobes, tea and the beginnings of a glorious brunch spread out over the table. Hermione sighed, looking to him. “Tell Ronald he’s being ridiculous and that I don’t have to eat if I don’t feel hungry.”
Death Eaters. A dozen of them. Some Harry recognized-- Bellatrix, Greyback, Dolohov. Snape led them up the stairs and Harry wanted to scream, but Dumbledore's spells kept him silent.
The small house elf, apparently named Mimsy, appeared then with two steaming bowls of what Harry immediately recognized as French onion soup-- one of his favorites. How had she known? Had Draco actually mentioned Harry's favorite
"Ah, Draco!" October called, waving to him. "Good to see you again!" A glass of fruity, citrusy white wine floated over to him. "Give this a try, would you? Tell me what you think." He carefully took the glass and, glancing at those watching him, he took a sip. At first, his lips puckered, but at the underlying sweetness, he was forced to take another sip to try to chase that taste.
Harry woke to an unfamiliar owl tapping at his window. He scanned the letter for charms and hexes and, finding none, untied the letter and allowed the owl to rest. The post mark indicated the letter was from France… but this was not Draco’s handwriting.
I am curious to say, how has your animagus training been coming along? Have you discovered what your form will be, yet? I’m ashamed to say I don’t know much of that branch of magic. You don’t get to choose what you become, do you? I have to say, I would be beside myself with laughter if you were to become a cat. Or, say — a peacock? They were just so awfully fond of you at the Manor, chasing you whenever you stepped foot in the yard.
Draco doesn’t respond, instead of kicking off his shoes ( which, for a reason Harry can’t understand, he wears inside.) and slides behind Harry, laying down behind him in the bed.
“Oh, well, I did the quidditch thing for a while… wrote some books… worked for the Ministry for a bit. I’m kind of retired. “
A sinking feeling overwhelms him as he drawls behind his friends, his mind going on a small, dreadful adventure as usual. Where could Draco have gone? Did he find his Slytherin friends and abandon him just like that? Is he nothing to Draco? Will things go back to the horrible way they were?
Whatever the case, Harry is now allowed to use magic and with that magic, he’ll protect himself- if one thing's for certain, he’s the best wizard under this roof.
It was  5 am on Christmas morning and Ron was kneeling by the tree next to his sister, sorting out which presents were his whilst his parents made their way downstairs. It was easy to tell which were his thanks to the giant Rs that were printed onto the brown wrapping paper his family would recycle each year. There were always a lot of presents because of his large amount of relatives but this year it seemed like there were more than usual.
Before Harry knows it he has two sets of arms wrapped around him, and another set snatching his cart from his hands. Hermione, Ron and Mrs Weasley.
“ I’ve always thought you were very handsome, like an elf or a fairy. Angelic, you know? Flawless in every way, perfect pointed features that make you look masculine but pretty. You’re perfect.”  Harry slowly leans back, away from Draco’s chest to look up at him. Draco’s usually pale, colourless skin is glowing pink and it makes Harry’s heart flutter. He wants to kiss him.
“Yeah, I want to hear more about all of this Draco Malfoy roommate business. You were being pretty vague,”
"Abbott, Hannah!" Ron watched as the blonde haired girl anxiously stepped out from the crowd of fellow first years and made her way to the front of the room, climbing the few stairs that led to the stage that professor McGonagall was stood on. Infront of her was a simple wood chair, in her hands was a hat. The hat looked to be older than the teacher herself,  and the teacher was,,, well, 'mature' for certain. Hannah took a seat in the wooden chair and McGonagall lowered the hat onto the blonde's head. The hat only touched her before it belted out, with no doubt in its tone "hufflepuff!"
“That can’t include  us, surely?” Draco said, placing his cup down on the nearest surface, staring at the television which had since faded to black, the phone number on the screen in a bold Arial font.
Draco laughs, quietly as to not hurt Harry’s ears. “I wrongfully assumed the same as you. The boy who lived, famous, handsome, humble? That didn’t make sense to me. I thought I'd impress you, but I've never been a good judge of character. I learnt about you growing up as all kids did, father didn’t speak about you in such a good light as you could imagine but regardless I wanted to be your friend.”
Harry finally moves, his lips  parting as if he were speaking but not a sound leaving them until finally, “ Dumbledore is gay?” Is that allowed? Harry knows all too well Muggles opinions on gay people and had assumed they’re quite the same for wizards.
“ As of 4 pm, this day,  The United Kingdom is under compulsory quarantine. Under no circumstances are you to leave your home for the next fourteen days, a government-issued military patrol will be guarding all areas constantly and if you are caught breaking your quarantine you will face jail time. Thank you, stay safe and God bless the queen. “
The explosion caused the power to short circuit and lights to flicker, both Dudley and Petunia scream in fright. Harry doesn’t flinch, nor does Draco who now has a smile planted on his face, very pleased by the screams of the Dursley family.
Even now when Harry closes his eyes he can see Draco’s face dropping when his sentence was read out in the courtroom. Draco didn’t cry, he didn’t speak, he nodded as if he agreed with his sentence. The idea that Draco believed he deserved to go to Azkaban still makes Harry feel Nauseous.
In perfect timing  Petunia and Vernon descended the staircase beside them, dressed as if they were about to head out for a dinner date… at 3 am.
about how to treat curly hair, how he should use all of these conditioners and creams. He’d been doing so ever since and found that his hair was neater than ever; curly, but neat.
Harry sits down beside Draco in the seat that'd been empty nearly his whole life,  only remembering brief occasions when Dudley was forced to sit next to him on account of Aunt Marge visiting. Dudley would always complain every moment up until Marge visited and then continued to afterwards until he was gifted something in return, usually a video game or something of the sort.
They were walking into the restaurant now, Draco this time holding the door for Harry and then an elderly woman who took up the opportunity before finally managing to enter the establishment himself.
Vernon was about to refute  but Albus pushed through his inquiries to continue speaking “-We’ll  give you £250 for each week upfront just to cover his food costs.” Vernon's expression quickly changed from one of anger to curiosity.
He continues walking, eyeing some questionable art and a few pictures of Harry’s children, a stand out being Albus’ 12th birthday- In it sits Albus and Draco’s son Scorpius, sitting so close to one another that they’re sitting on each other. Very cute.
“The end of last summer? You don’t know? Well… I guess you wouldn’t. Huh. Well,  accidentally blew up my Aunt. I ran away from home and the ministry paid for a room. “ Harry smiles at the memory. At the time it was scary, he thought he was going to be expelled from Hogwarts and have to spend the rest of his days as a troglodyte. Thankfully that wasn’t the case.
Both Harry and Draco simply go back to eating while the rest of the family flee, leaving the kitchen and then finally out the front door with a bang, but not a word. If Harry had known it’d be that easy to get rid of the Dursley’s he’d have done it much sooner.
Mourning he and Draco’s whirlwind romance, that had apparently ended right then and there. The train is about to leave the platform and Draco isn’t anywhere in sight. Harry can see Draco waltzing off the train in the classy way he does, snickering at Harry and throwing him an insult, pretending as if nothing ever happened.  The thought feels so real he has to convince himself it is just that- a thought.
“Sorry, uh, didn't think you’d still be in here. You’re always downstairs. “ Harry walks over to his wardrobe, finding himself something to wear. He figured he’d dress nicer than usual today, partially to impress Draco and also because they were heading to Diagon Alley.
"NO ONE TOLD YOU ANYTHING! NO ONE. HARRY THEY, WE- MOST WIZARDS HAVE YEARS OF PREPARATION! THEY KNOW WHATS-" Sirius's banshee screeches were cut off into a low whisper. "Dear Godric, I'm so sorry, Harry, we were supposed to tell you everything. If I wouldn't have gone after Peter. We shouldn't have assumed Dumbledore told you about any of it. With my Banshee blood and James's Vampiric blood, that could be a nasty mix for inheritances. But why didn't Dumbledore tell you, as a magical guardian, it's his job to instruct you and prepare you for your sixteenth?" Sirius trailed off thoughtfully.
Turning to the door, Harry steeled himself for whatever was about to happen. The niggling sensation from this morning hadn't dissipated, and Harry had the feeling he was about to find out why. He opened the door and entered into a small, stone room with a large desk in the middle of the chamber. There were no windows in the room resulting in the chamber being dark and damp, lit only by four candles floating above the desk. Harry sat in the chair closest to the door, opposite an old goblin, and cleared his throat to get the goblin's attention.
"We know something happened, Harry. You disappeared for a week, no note, no nothing, then show up here looking like you've seen a bogart. With the addition of someone simultaneously kicking Hedwig," Remus stated, seeing the mulish look on Harry's face, "Now spill."
As Harry walked back to his room in the Leaky Cauldron, He was thankful he didn't have to take the Night Bus back to Surrey. His feet dragged behind him, and at one point, he stumbled into a lady coming out of Flourish and Blotts and knocked her books over. It must have been mid-afternoon, but the sun didn't seem to wake Harry up at all. He ended up at his door with no memory of how he got there. He blinked stupidly at the door before reaching for his key. Unlocking the door and stepping inside, Harry quickly changed into his night clothing. He climbed into the large, soft bed, content that he could finally fall asleep. Before he fell deep into unconsciousness, Harry remembered he forgot to ask about the creature inheritance and made a note to ask about it in their next meeting.
"Hey, I hope you don't mind, but I have to grab my schoolbooks," Draco stated, already walking downstairs. Harry decided that he should follow the blond boy, as he needed to get his books and would probably not be allowed out after he went to number 12.
The Night Bus seamed to sway side to side with the fast movement of the driver, Ernie, if Harry remembered correctly. Before they reached Diagon Alley and the bus almost hit an old lady and several animals. As a result, Harry was extremely thankful to leave the bus when they reached the alley. As Harry entered the Leaky Cauldron, he didn't receive a second glance from any of the patrons and quickly reserved a room for the entirety of August. He had a whole month to do whatever he wanted! As he walked up to his room, Harry imagined all the things he could do here. Maybe he could get his vision fixed or study for potions and prove Snape wrong about his skills in the class. Harry's thoughts slipped to his slimy professor as he started to unpack his trunk.
“ahh, that’s rather unexpected, usually a family’s inheritance is a deeply personal matter, your magical garden should have explained it before your 16
Harry was looking down at Sia, talking to her in quiet tones about books and school. He was on his way to pick up his school texts and other writings on pureblood culture when he literally ran into someone. He hit a solid chest of a towering man and fell backward, hitting the pavement below him, with a hard thud. He looked up to see who he ran into. The man was at least a foot taller than Harry, well built, and as pale as a ghost. Harry trailed his eyes along the other boy's body until he reached the smirking face of Draco Malfoy.
As Harry walked through the main room of the Leaky Caldron, he grabbed an apple as it was still too early for ice-cream. There was only one man that Harry thought looked somewhat familiar from his Third year spent in the alley. The man didn’t spare him a second glance as Harry moved passed him to the doorway. When he entered the alley, Harry noticed that it seemed a lot different then yesterday. While still bright and cheerful, there were less people, the atmosphere was more reserved, and it seemed less hopeful. Harry thought that it was probably the combination of war and the early hour. It was around Five in the morning after all. Harry quickly made his way to Florean Fotescue’s and ordered a large, Black coffee. He didn’t like sugar with it, when he was living with the Dursleys Harry would steel small amounts of coffee after Vernon’s morning cup but couldn’t risk the sugar. He supposed he probably developed a taste for black coffee as a result, but whenever he had coffee at Hogwarts Ron would give him a funny look, so Harry mostly just had hot chocolate instead.
"Harry… what creature inheritance did you receive?" Remus asked lightly, looking at Harry's hair, "You look terrific, don't get me wrong, but the hair… it is a particular creature that hasn't been seen in a pureblood family in centuries. And for some reason, I doubt that it's a coincidence. It's never a coincidence with you though, is it?"
"Oh, and this one on our Culture and political duties of an heir, oh here, this one will help as well." Draco continued to pull book after booking off the shelf to place in Harry's arms, explaining how they helped him and what they were about. By the time Draco stopped ransacking the shelves, Harry had a pile of about 20 books, only slipping in a couple about his creature inheritances.
Harry woke up with a start as his alarm clock blared. He quickly shut it off before the noise could wake the Dursleys. He looked around his room, fishing in the back of his mind for something. There was a niggling sensation in the back of his head that something wasn't right. He swung his feet onto the cold floor and gasped. While Harry always had dark skin, the colour on his legs was a dark, healthy, golden brown. Harry quickly and quietly made his way to the bathroom down the hall to make sure nothing else had changed. He almost fainted when he saw his reflection. He looked nothing like he did before. He looked good. His eyes had changed from dull emerald green to a colour reminiscent of the Killing Curse. His almond-shaped eyes were framed with long, full eyelashes and thick eyebrows. His bone structure seemed to have changed, as well. His face had always been somewhat crooked as a result of one of Vernon's beatings when Harry was three. But now his face was almost symmetrical. His hair fell in small ringlets around his face as its usual mess, but now where once was a solid black blob, contained blood-red highlights. His skin looked healthier as well, and he looked like he had gained a couple of centimetres overnight. Although he was still skinny, it looked more like a result of a food shortage then his average weight.
"Harry," Sirius gently shook the young boy out of his thoughts, "you need to tell us what you were doing. We're your guardians, your family. We care about you and want to make sure you're safe. But we can't do that if you aren't honest with us." Sirius stated with a calm voice, but Harry could tell something was wrong. Did Remus get hurt last night? Was everyone okay?
Ragnok nodded, “of course lord Potter, I will send the bill to you in a couple weeks, when the Warding is done. Then of course we have a list of businesses and investments you currently have.”
"Hello, what can I do for you today, sir?" the Storekeeper stated happily from behind a glass case containing an arrangement of necklaces.
"oh, of course, Mr. Potter, Grimhook and I have decided that it would be in the banks best interest if we were to finish the business dealings tomorrow, while still dealing with the issue of lordships today."
"Harry, hush pup, why don't you start with what you found out?" Remus soothed gently. Harry nodded in agreement, taking a deep breath to settle himself.
"Now we have to remove all the spells on your person, and brew the antidote, Siriu- " Harry cut the older man off again, "no, no, there already removed, that's part of why it took so long. The first night in the Alley, I had to get all these removed. The goblins checked to make sure I was not in danger of harming myself or others and that I was stable. But I felt like I was going to pass out. Like my magic had been drained but also was bursting out of it seems. I couldn't finish the meeting. So, we had to schedule a second one for the next day."
"Harry, after their first-year students are supposed to get their letters in the second week of the Holidays," Remus stated quietly, a look of rage contorting his face.
"Well, I can show you around the Alley if you want, there should be a couple Books in Flourish and Blotts about Wizarding Britain's culture and such. We can even get ice-cream if you like, Florean Fotescue's has any flavour you could imagine." Draco stated hesitantly
"Yes, I quite agree. What do I need to do to accept my lordships?" Harry stated. Today did not go the way he thought it would.
Harrycrept down the stairs and passed the large portrait of Marge. When he was at Hogwarts, she had a heart attack, no wonder with the way she ate and drank. Harry was just surprised Vernon hadn't gone with her. But he was on a diet with his while of the sun in Harry's third year. A pity, really. Harry desperately wished what Sirius told him about the trace was right as he whispered "alohomora" to unlock the door. He then quickly shrunk his trunk and broom to quietly carry them upstairs and pack the rest of his books.
birthday. But I suppose with the blocks on your magic and inheritance this was not able to happen. I can explain the basics, but I cannot explain your situation individually, you will have books in your family vaults for that” Ragnok sighed, “Many years before the first wizarding war, Wizards and Witches were quit excepting of Dark Creatures. Many families believed mating with these creatures would help to make the blood line more magically strong. As these beings were magically powerful, they mixed with the Wizards magic to form a bond with the family. as a result, the family line caries behavers and powers down from there ancestors. These can mix together and overlap; however, each family is quite distinct. But if you want to learn more about your particular heritage you will need to explore the inheritance books in your vaults, after this meeting is done, I can retrieve each book. I can also gather some on werewolf inheritances, they’re rare but Gringotts has some records that I can give you.” Harry nodded in agreement, he needed to know more about who he was before going back to Hogwarts.
“Of course, lord Potter, most of these properties and the family lines have house elves to keep the land in pristine condition. However, given your… particular position, Gringotts could set up stronger wards around the grounds, if you give us a building or such you wish to inhabit.”
"Ahh, siblings can be quite troublesome" Violet agreed, "We have an opening right now, as hardly no one wants an appointment this early in the morning. If you follow me, I'll show you to the stylist that will take care of you today." Ironwood seemed to be upset to be in the shop at this hour, but lead Harry over to a small, dark-skinned woman who smiled kindly at him. "This is Vale Nettle; she will be cutting your hair today. Vale, this is… Sorry, sir, I didn't ketch your name".
"ah Mr. Potter, it is quite easy, as the inheritance test already proved you have qualified for each position, you are to place the family ring on each finger, starting with your left hand to your right hand. You will go in order from Most Ancient and Noble to the Potter line as listed on your test." The goblin Stated as he pulled nine boxes out of a desk drawer with the houses' crests on them.
"Fine, I'll tell you. But you have to swear a wizard's oath not to tell anyone or otherwise communicate what I am about to tell you with anyone other than myself." Harry demanded as he rose a challenging eyebrow.
Harry shook his head to dislodge these thoughts, he needed to study for the History of Magic O.W.L and he only has six hours till his meeting with Ragnok. Harry still had most of the study materials in his trunk, luckily, he hadn’t gotten to cleaning out his trunk in a while. He turned back to the bed, where is trunk was laying at its base, and opened the lid to rummage around where he could remember throwing his books. Pulling out his old History of Magic books and the study guide Hermione had forced Ron and him to follow, he placed the papers and notes in his bookbag to study at Florean Fotescue’s Ice-Cream Parlour. In the Morning the ice-cream store served coffee, hot chocolate, and, of course, ice-cream. He also heard the store never closed, so there wouldn’t be a lot of people there and he could fuel up on coffee for the long day ahead of him.
"ah, Mr. Potter, it seems that you require a mirror," Ragnok stated blandly while he handed Harry a summonedhand mirror. Harry looked mostly the same from this morning, before he placed the glamor. But now there was a long scar, opposite that of the lightning bolt, that ran through his eyebrow to his upper lip. It looked like a clean-cut and mostly healed. However, the lightning bolt scar was still raised and red, looking freshly burned into his skin. It also seemed that he grew a couple more centimetres and was probably the average size for a fifteen-year-old male. Although still short, he must have gained several centimetres today.
"As I said before, Harry is asleep, and I'm hesitant to wake. Children should be asleep this early in the morning. Besides Sirius and I already talked to him about his Disappearance act. But you are welcome to come in for a glass of tea." Remus stated calmly.
"No, you don't pup, you could use the extra food. You better be halfway through your second muffin by the time I bring Remus down. Then you're going to tell us exactly what you were up to. No, if, buts, or ands, mister, there was no way business with the goblins required you to leave your relatives." He added seeing Harry about to object and left the room to get Remus.
“Thank you,” Harry squinted at the name tag on the desk, barely able to make out the name, “Nagknus, may your gold flow and your riches multiply.” He then hurried to Ragnok’s office; he was excited to look at the snakes in the alley. He knocked on the old door.
"I, Sirius Orion Lupin-Black, swear on my magic to abstain from any communication involving the subject Hadrian Potter unless given permission to do so," Sirius responded immediately and looked at Remus expectantly.
"That's such a good idea, but I think if you go to Hogwarts, we just determined your future house." Draco teased.
Harry knew that that fiasco could have gone horribly had the Headmaster not shown up in time to dual Bellatrix Lestrange and save Sirius. Harry could have become genuinely alone. Siri had claimed in the aftermath that he wouldn't have blamed Harry if he died and that he was acting just like his father. Although, Harry suspected that didn't comfort him as much as Sirius thought it would.
"Ahh, I don't think I have seen you around here. My name is tom, let me know if you need anything" the barman called from behind the counter as Harry made his way through the crowded room.
Harry hadn't been this mad since his inheritance test, granted that wasn't that long ago. Why did she come so early in the morning, it didn't seem that urgent? Harry really hoped that she didn't wake Remus with this nonsense. How dare that woman talk to Remus like that. How dare she talk about him like that? His Responsibilities? Dumbledore's orders? What a joke. Harry had always thought she was the mother he would never have. But perhaps the potions blinded him to her real personality.
"May your gold flow and your riches multiply, Head Goblin Grimhook. It is lovely to make your acquaintance, even under these circumstances. I am going to take up all nine lordships, regardless of the price or completion of today's events." Harry stated, while looking Grimhook in the eye.
"did you at least get to choose your classes for this year, there your NEWTs classes after all. If Dumbledore fucked this up to, Godric have mercy on him…" Remus started,
Then the letter ripped itself to shreds and set itself on fire in the still silence of the room. Harry was in shock, it never occurred to him to let Sirius know that he was okay or what he was doing. Now that he looked back, Harry couldn’t imagine what it would look like to Sirius. Merlin, Sirius probably thought Harry had ran away from everyone. Harry Quickly penned a letter to his godparent, letting him know that he left to do some business with Gringotts, that he had to take the History of Magic test and needed to spend a few days in Diagon alley but would be at Grimuld Place in a few days. He felt guilty about making the old man worry. He truly didn’t think to let anyone know where he was.
Harry also usually concealed his clothing. While he still looked like a too skinny child in his father's clothing, the original appearance of his muggle and casual wear was so much worse. Harry picked out the nicest shirt in the trunk and his only pair of jeans without holes in the knees.  But the top of his button-up shirt hung below his collar bone, exposing a myriad of scars marring his dark skin. The long sleeves were fraying, and large holes allowed his elbows to poke through when he moved the wrong way. The shirt also fell far past his knees and could be considered an uglier dress than a dress shirt. It must have belonged to Vernon not so long ago. There were no liner rips across the back of the shirt like most of his clothing. However, instead of the clean white, it had been when in Vernon's possession, the shirt now looked like it had a permeant colour of dirt and grass stains. The jeans also had a muddy green combination. However, the lower trouser legs seemed to have a completely different colour than the waistline. The trousers also had holes were his knees were, and Harry had to roll the legs and waist several times before the jeans wouldn't drag behind him when he walked. The belt loops had come off some time ago as well. But all of his other trousers had ripped down the side, which exposed the majority of his legs.
The 5th anniversary of QoW was fast approaching and Harry and Draco had sat in on each others’ tattoo appointments more often than not since Draco's dragon. Draco had been there for Harry's twinkling sirius star, as well as the phase-shifting moon. Harry had sat in on Draco's constellation on his other shoulder, as well as the runes across his ribs.
"Oh." Although, he was suddenly having doubts about this whole animagus thing. He wasn't much a fan of hallucinations, really. Not that he knew anyone that was.
But there are two photos of Harry wanking himself off, head tipped back, lips open in a soft but silent pant, hair a wild mess. The final picture shows Harry cumming over his own chest and abs. These are definitely not teasing photos. These mean business.]]
He nods and offers his arm to her with a smile, like he's seen Draco do at the occasional Ministry gala. "Fantastic idea, Mrs. Malfoy." Apparently that was the right move, because she was smiling at him and taking his arm, leading them to the dining room. There was a big, long table where in their hayday the Malfoys probably entertained a hundred guests. As it was, the only places set were at the head of the table, and just beside it.
"Those damn-- and you're sure you want that bedroom?" She nodded and he sighed. "Alright, okay. We'll take care of the pixies."
"How could I forget?" He grinned up at Draco and took another sip of his coffee. "I have the most meticulous and prepared partner in the DMLE. That might be why they gave you to me in the first place."
is because Vernon feared your magic, as did Petunia. They punished you for doing magic, but I believe they punished you for a number of other things, so you did not come to believe that your magic was bad or evil and should be suppressed.”
He shrank and stowed his Firebolt before entering the local pub, The Frog & Peach. It seemed like a mash-up of the Burrow and the Hog's Head; warm and old and wild, which matched most of the pub's patrons as well. In fact, a good number of them nearly looked creature-like in their wildness. Perhaps he'd come to the right place to ask after a rare and dangerous beast.
I think… something soft. A nice soft leather or maybe even dragonhide… Something you would wear often and for long periods, if you wanted. I'm tempted to put jewels in as well… but maybe just a polished silver clasp? Who's to say?
“Enough! Don’t scare the boy off, now!” October boomed, the rest of the family quieting. He grinned at Draco and pulled out the chair beside him, so that he would be at the right of the head of the table, where a matronly woman sat, a baby on her lap and a smile on her face. Oh… was this..?
Harry then turned to get dressed in his single pair of casual robes as not many people would be out this early on a Saturday. He places his wand in the red and gold wand holder attached to his thigh. Harry then shrunk and cleaned Hedwig's cage to store it with his other belongings. Harry placed his firebolt in a small storage compartment in is trunk rapped with one of Dudley's old shirts so it wouldn't be damaged. After everything was packed away, Harry cleaned to the bedroom to make it look he was never there. Then he took out his money pouch and shrunk the trunk and place both items in his back pocket.
Knocking on the door was one of the most frightening things Harry has ever done, including battling Voldemort. He felt as though he waited an eternity before the door swung open. Sirius stood there, looking his usual dishevelled self. But there was a frantic look in his eyes. It seemed to take in the surroundings before locking on Harry. His hair looked like he hadn't washed it properly in months, looking reminiscent of his time on the run or Snape's usual style. He wore a wrinkled pair of muggle joggers and a jumper that looked like it was meant for a much larger man. Similar to Harry's old dress shirt stuffed at the bottom of his trunk, but not as long or dress like.
"I"M GOING TO KILL THAT CONNIVING SON OF A BITCH! HOW DARE HE MESS WITH MY GODSON", Sirius screeched, shocking Harry out of his thoughts.
The corn snake nodded in approval. Harry hurriedly waved over the shop worker to gather all the necessary items: a large snake sanctuary, wooden logs, appropriate heating charms, self-filling water bowls and pools, bedding, and lighting charms that mimicked the sun. While Sia hissing demands over Harrys shoulder.
"Sirius, inside voice," Remus chided absentmindedly. Glaring down at the parchment, like it personally offended him.
The next chapter will be a tad long then the others so it might be published a little late. But no later then Tuesday. Thanks everyone for reading!
"Oh, thank Merlin, that would be amazing. I'm going to be completely honest here I have been completely lost for the past couple minutes. This Alley is so confusing." Harry gushed, a little too relieved. However, Draco didn't seem to notice to busy laughing at Hadrian's ability to navigate a straight line.
Ragnok stared in shock of only a second, “that’s rather unexpected… However, are there any other questions you wish to ask?”
Setting up his study area in the very back corner of the shop, Harry noticed there wasn’t anyone else there, just as he predicted. Harry took a sip of coffee then set the old, damaged wristwatch timer for 11:45, to give him time to pack up and run to Gringotts. The Watch used to be Dudley’s, but as always, it was broken within a few days of him receiving it. But, Harry had fixed it up so he could know when to start cooking if he was working in the garden. He turned back to his History notes, Harry whished he was studying History for fun instead of potions when he was at his relatives.
"I don't think either of them knew. My mothers' parents were expecting a child, but the baby didn't survive. I think they decided to adopt it immediately after. There were no magical records of the adoption. So, unless Dumbledore dug into muggle records, he wouldn't know."
Harry paid for his giant pile of books and put them all in his bottomless bag he bought that morning. Malfoy had shown him all new stores he never knew existed, including a jewellery shop. Ever since he got Sia, Harry wanted to keep her safe from the other lions he shared a dorm with. No doubt Ron would flip out if he ever saw the small snake wrapped around Harry's forearm. But Draco mentioned that this store sold charmed items that could protect the wearer. Of course, he would have to convince Sia to wear the thing, which wouldn't be easy. As he entire the shop, Harry coaxed Sia on to his shoulder.
Harry looked in the mirror for a long time. He didn't want to glamour his hair, but then Dumbledore would realize something had changed and look for more discrepancies. He supposed his unglamoured face was different enough from his public persona that hardly anyone would recognise him. However, he would have to glamour his lightning scar and the clothing. The scar was one of his most identifiable features, and the clothes made him look like a small rat. Harry changed the shirt to be a smaller, white dress shirt with no holes. He also shrunk the jeans and corrected the colour. He then put his hair up with one of aunt Petunia's hair ties to hide the uneven cut. While it still looked terrible, his hair didn't look like ruminates from a fight with a chainsaw and an angry pixy. Harry allowed Sia to rest on his shoulders. He was planning to fix his hair before clothes shopping, so he didn't look completely lost, so she would have to move in a bit. Harry schooled his expression as he walked down the stairs, he was incredibly worried that someone would recognize him. Then Dumbledore would find out Harry broke the binding.
"Can we see what you look like?" asked Sirius gently. Harry nodded; he had already shared enough incriminating information so there wasn’t much more to hold against him. He stood up slowly and removed the glamour. Harry closed his eyes and took off his (fake) glasses, not wanting to see their reaction. He heard their gasp of shock. Harry was not ashamed of his new look, he loved the red strands of hair that connected him to his mother, but he knew he looked different and was afraid of how his godparents would react. Harry's eyes shot open at the feeling of a hand, caressing the long scare near his eyes. Sirius was standing in front of him, smiling slightly. Padfoot's eyes widened in shock as Harry opened his eyes, revealing killing curse green instead of the deep emerald.
"I thought you said you weren't going to Hogwarts, Hadrian? Is your uncle making you follow the curriculum by yourself? Cause then you should come to Hogwarts anyway the teachers explain the texts really well.” Draco spoke, startling Harry out of his depressive thoughts of the rest of the summer.
After hours of talking, Sirius had led Harry to his bedroom for the next few weeks. It was a different one then he had used last time. Ron and the Weasleys were not projected to stay here this summer. So, Sirius and Remus had set up a room just for Harry. The room was large, with a canopy bed set in the middle of the floor. Harry had felt touched that the men had set this up for him, there was even a couple quidditch magazines set on a side table and a new perch for Hedwig. Remus had set up a space for Sia as well. He never had his own space. In the cupboard he had to store the cleaning supplies and other things, the bedroom he was allowed to stay in was always Dudley's second bedroom. At Hogwarts, he shared a room with the other Gryffindor boys in his year. So, when Harry's head hit the pillow, he was out like a light despite sleeping in a new place.
“Speaking of wives,  who are you seeing now since  Ginny called for a divorce? I can’t see the famous Harry Potter being a bachelor for too long. What’s her name? How many years younger is she?” Draco’s face curls into a cunning smirk, his elbow propped up on the couch’s arm, chin in his hand.
. “And you, Granger. Harry informed me you have a preference for lemon flavouring but sadly the trolley witch hadn’t had any so I settled for grape. “ Hermione graciously takes hers, a kind smile flashed towards Draco and as he looked away she gave Harry an eyebrow raise, expressing how impressed she is.
“Sirius. They didn’t want him to find me and at the time he was hiding in muggle London, the Minister came and everything.”
Suddenly Harry hears the compartment door slide open and he looks up from the ground, his eyes landing on a pair of icy silver eyes.
On hearing his name get mentioned along with St. Mungo’s Harry quickly realized that whoever it was beyond the door are in fact wizards,  but why are they here? What are they talking about?
Finally, they were lead into the Slytherin common room. The room was dark, the furniture is mostly black with green velvet or silk finishings. The windows opened up to the lake, under the lake. All you could see was murky water and dim light shining in through the water and windows. The group were told that the occasional mermaid would swim past, maybe even look in through the windows. That gave Ron the creeps.
"This simply can't be, it must be a mistake-" Arthur blurted out before the twins cut him off. "The sorting hat doesn't make mistakes. "
His thoughts are cut short when he feels someone grab his hand, that someone being Draco himself. He smiles up at him and Draco smiles back, they stay there a moment before Draco speaks “I’ll be right back.”
“ Dumbledore?” Harry said, genuinely sounding surprised because, well, he is. Albus looked disgruntled, hair messy, robes a little dirty, but that charming smile on his face hadn’t faded at all. “Harry. This is Kingsley Shacklebolt.” Albus motioned between the pair and Kinsgley held out a hand to shake as Harry jumped to his feet and took it. “ It’s lovely to meet you, Harry.”
There they sat, Harry, Draco and James. They were eating dinner, the room lit by the decorative light above, the sky outside dark. It was sort of awkward, Harry and Draco would share romantic glances at one another before quickly looking away like shy schoolgirls, scared James would catch them. James, on the other hand, was distracted, trying to figure out a way to bring up the yelling he heard earlier- he was sure it had to have come from a Howler, right? No real woman can make that sort of noise.
Harry nodded obediently, standing, waiting for Draco to stand. He quickly realized that Draco simply couldn’t stand by himself and rushed by his side to help him up, ignoring the fact that Draco flinched as his touch as if he found Harry to be disgusting- or terrifying.
In between trips out, Harry spent a lot of his time writing to both Ron and Hermione. Previously, Vernon had made it very clear that Harry wasn’t allowed to owl anyone and if Vernon had it his way poor Hedwig wouldn’t ever be allowed of her cage.
Draco Malfoy is no longer the boy Harry dreads to see, but the boy Harry loves to hold and things couldn't be any better.
This gave Harry all the time he needed to calm down and regather his thoughts, Draco had only been by his side for a day and Harry had himself believing it’d been years, all leading up to a romantic climax. He knows it’s stupid and that it’s all in his head, but he’s never been able to control his thoughts, especially when a lot of them aren’t his, to begin with.
Ron's eyes scanned the room, a few of the older students were talking, catching up after not seeing each other for a few months. He overheard a girl talk about her vacation to Egypt, he wished he could go visit Egypt. Or anywhere. His eyes landed on a giant, grand chair that sat in the middle of the room. The chair had a very tall black, lined with beautiful green velvet and carved ever so intricately. Ron made a beeline towards that chair, throwing himself into it.   It was so comfortable, it felt as if the chair hugged him, welcoming him into the house.
Ron wanted to be unique, he wanted to be the first Weasley to be placed in a different house, he wanted independence. He was sick and tired of being seen as just another red-haired, poor Weasley. He was his own person, he was Ron Billius Weasley, not just  ' a Weasley' but it was hard to have an identity when nothing about you, at least from the outside, was any different to everyone else.
“Now? Well, I think we should do as we please and deal with every obstacle as it comes our way. I’m sure there will be a lot of them. “
he listened. Didn't think he'd file for a divorce, though, purebloods usually are against that stuff. ”
Draco clears his throat and replies, speaking rather matter-of-factly. “Well. You have no flaws, physically gorgeous, of course, but you’re also the perfect person on the inside. Selfless, brave, committed, a hero. You’re willing to do anything for anyone, I mean, you even took
“What would you like to do?” Harry suddenly realized he doesn’t know anything about Draco’s interests. He knows he likes Quidditch, or at least he assumes he does but then again a small part of him reminds him that Draco likely only got into the sport to compete with him.
Draco has proven time and time again that he’s a selfish, prude, evil person who’d manipulate anyone and do anything to get his way, and everyone knows his way is the Dark Lord’s. Harry of all people knew this better than anyone else, remembering the very first day they’d ever met as if it were only mere weeks ago, Draco was even horrible back then.
Ron begins to conjure up something to say but Hermione intervenes “Grand! Oh, I missed you, Harry. How have
“Let me heal you so you can get yourself out of the tub. “ Harry slowly made his way closer to the bath, not being able to see through his foggy glasses.  He blows the steam out of his face and wipes his glasses clean, there sitting before him was Draco Malfoy.
“Harry, you ignorant git. I’ve always fancied you, surely you’ve realized that by now? Must I spell everything out for you? Well, I've come to terms with my feelings as of late but they’ve always been there. Lurking. And I feel, no, I know you feel the same. So I kissed you.”
am talking to Harry. Go away. “ And then Ron’s head vanishes from the flames with a little puff of smoke.
The front of the tag confirmed his suspicions, they were for him, flipping the tag over he soon learnt that the present he was holding was from none other than Lucius Malfoy. He gently placed the parcel down and picked up the other present,  this wasn't hard like the other which lead Ron to believe it was something soft like a sweater. Every year his mother would give him a sweater for Christmas, he was used to that sort of gift.
Harry hadn’t even noticed McGonagall had left the room until he spotted her walking downstairs and then approaching the pair. “ Harry, could you please escort Draco to your bedroom? You’ll find I've made a few adjustments to it so it’ll fit the pair of you.”
Harry scans his friends' faces, Hermione looks rather happy with her lollipop and, to be fair, Ron does too. The only difference is that Ron has this expression on his face, an expression Harry can’t read.
‘ I’d hoped the pair of you could have met at a better time but the situation is rather urgent. I need to ask a favour of you and your aunt and uncle- could you please fetch them for me?”
Ron sat there for the rest of the night whilst his parents argued about which of their bloodlines caused him to end up in the Slytherin house. It was kind of ironic, really. His parents and many other Gryffindor families claimed to dislike Slytherins because of their bloodline biases, yet his family were doing the same thing just for a different reason.
But he doesn’t, Draco pushes Harry aside and sits back against the opposite wall of the tiny little plastic box they’d found themselves in.
"Malfoy, Draco!" The cocky blonde haired, blue eyed boy made his way to the front of the group, making sure to barge into Ron as he made his way past, flashing the other an annoying, cocky smile. He sat down, not a sign of nerves on that boys face. The hat once again didn't take a long time at all,  the hat bellowing "Slytherin!" Before it was even placed on the boy's head. Ron almost admired Draco, the way Draco was so comfortable being himself, so cocky. Ron wished he could be like the other, he wished he was confident.
Harry slips off his shoes and climbs up the tunnel slide, the same way Draco did, slipping a few times on his journey up the red slide. “Draco?”
They decided to eat at Florean Fortescue’s, sharing a very large Sunday between them both. Florean was very happy to see Harry and very surprised to see Draco, referring to him as “Mr Malfoy” which Harry thought was rather funny.
Another head appears in the fireplace, this one belonging to Ron Weasley, “Ginny is a great mom, you git. What? You think she can’t look after her kids?”
“No? It’s worse than I thought… Well,” Draco cleared his throat, one arm crossed over, the other positioned in front of him, finger running over his bottom lip to think. “ Dumbledore and Grindelwald met when they were younger, around our age.  No one knows the details because, as you could imagine, Dumbledore doesn’t bring it up much. They grew apart as you could imagine and in the end, Dumbledore was the one to give Gellert his sentence. He’s still in prison now.”
Harry wakes in the morning to find Draco sleeping in his arms, startled at first he remembers the night prior clearly. It’s strange, how things have changed so drastically within the past few weeks but he couldn’t be happier- he’d even almost forgotten about the dark lord. Almost.
He and his three elder brothers caught the train back to London and their father picked them up from the train station, during the ride Ron realized that his parents didn't know he had been placed into Slytherin and the anxiety over the situation slapped him in the face. He wasn't sure how his parents would react, would they hate him? They did have a record of not being too fond of Slytherins, would they treat him the same? Ron didn't understand why his parents hated Slytherins so much, after spending the past months with them, being one of them, he found them to be very nice people.
"Why do I feel like I'm going to regret this. Very well then," the werewolf sighed, "I, Remus John Lupin-Black, swear on my magic to abstain from any communication involving the subject Hadrian Potter, unless given permission to do so." Remus repeated dutifully, making Harry smile widely. He could trust them, and if he couldn't-While they'd lose their magic. Not exactly a win-win situation and more a lose-lose catastrophe, but they would think twice before giving his information to the aged headmaster.
Harry blinked at the parchment. "Um Mr. Ragnok, is there a possibility to ask you a couple of questions about the results?"
Harry blinked slowly at the letter. If he left for the wizarding bank today, he wouldn't be allowed to return to the Dursleys, although that wasn't a bad thing. However, Dumbledore stressed the importance of saying with his relatives for the entirety of this summer. On the other hand, if he didn't go, he would lose any money in Gringotts and the Potter lordship. Harry reasoned he didn't have a choice and had to disobey Dumbledore in this situation.  After all, he had a duty to the Potter house, and no one else was eligible to take up the mantle, besides muggles or Harry would have gone to his magical relatives.
"Sorry, Molly, but Harry is going to stay here with us. For the rest of the summer. I sent a letter to his relatives, letting them know that he is safe and whatnot."
Harry had just finished the test. The administrators told him that he should get his results back in a couple hours by owl. Unfortunately, he hadn’t seen Hedwig since the day prior. During the Holidays the snowy owl was the only friend he had and right now the only being he trusted completely. Ron and Hermione could know what Dumbledore was up to, and so could Remus and Sirius. Harry sat on his bed and put his head in his hands. There was a very probable chance everyone Harry thought he could trust lied to him. But Harry didn’t want to think about that, instead he moved to deciding his class registration. While he didn’t have his results back yet, he could decide his other classes. Harry thought he should at least take a lot of classes because he had no clue what he wanted to do. So, he came up with a rough list that was dependent upon his scores.
"Here, I know most people expect to go to Flourish and Blotts down the alley, but this book shop has a larger selection of books and is targeted at travellers and newcomers, so it's perfect for you," Draco stated while opening the door for the dark-haired teen. Harry mumbled a brief thanks before stepping into the shop. There must have been an expansion charm placed in the bookstore as it looked 10x larger than its outside appearance. Books lined every available surface. There was a staircase leading down to another section that was also filled with books.
“Here you go Lad, you have quit peculiar eyes, very much resistant to change, still fixable though, just finish this potion, the effects should be immediate, I have your glasses right here,” he said as he handed the potion and glasses over to Harry. The potion tasted like a bitter mix between slugs and sick, absolutely disgusting, but he supposed the medical potions weren’t made to taste good. As soon as the last drop of potion hit the back of his throat, Harry’s vision started to clear. Everything came into much finer detail then his glasses ever managed. He could make out the wrinkles on the old Wizards face instead of the white and gray smudge he saw before. Harry smiled brightly and slipped on his glasses. He payed Mr. Ovira and left the store. Harry had already wasted to much time. He needed to finish studying; Harry may not know what he wanted to do in the future, but he knew that his choices were already limited as a result of his choices in third year.
"Padfoot, let's let Harry explain what happened. For some reason, I think I know where this is going, and there will be plenty of ranting to be done after we have all the information," Remus berated.
"Yes, I think this one would work great," Harry told the clerk, who rushed to bag up the items and sent Harry on his way.
Last year had gotten bad. He still had scars on his back that dully ached when playing quidditch or when in the garden. No matter what he did, Harry never could forget the look on Vernon's face after the dementor attack. He was almost purple with rage. That night was the worst Harry had ever had. At least when Voldemort returned, Harry managed to escape relatively unharmed. But that night, Harry had felt excruciating, rhythmic, endless pain. The blood on his back seemed to be a never-ending stream of red running down his spine. His face swelled to the size of a watermelon, and Harry looked more like a blueberry than a person. After that night, He was banned from doing any outside work, and Vernon replaced the bars on the window. Harry had spent the rest of the two weeks locked in his room, starving and buried in his school texts.
"Well, I'm trying to convince my uncle to attend, but he is rather hesitant. See, he was never able to teach me how an heir to a family line was supposed to act in Britain. But from what he told me so far, it's fairly different than how we were supposed to act in South America. I am not an heir to the Fawley line, but I was always interested in the politics of our culture and politics. And I have a terrible sense of direction. My uncle is probably afraid that I'll get lost in Hogwarts. The war is just a little bit of an extra reason to keep me out." Harry joked.
This place was nice, small but very homely. It reminded Harry of a muggle barber shop he had been in when Vernon had to get his hair cut and didn’t trust Harry by himself after his first letter for Hogwarts arrived. he wondered if there was a magical hair place around here. Harry loved the new highlights in his hair, but he hadn’t had a proper haircut in a couple years. He saw a couple muggle boys with his completion having relatively styled hair. True his current dreadlocks would never be as styles as aunt Petunia wished, but maybe he could give it the more intentional look.
Harry gathered his notes and shoved them haphazardly into his book bag. He had a bad feeling that keeping Ragnok waiting would not end well for him. He rushed through the alley, pushing through crowds of people, as it had grown much busier in the last six hours. It also seemed like there were more Hogwarts students milling around, harry round recognized a third year Slytherin and a couple fifth year Hufflepuffs in the pet shop next to him. Perhaps Harry should get a snake? Before Hogwarts, Harry used to talk to snakes for hours while in the garden. They were very honest beings, however, extremely defensive. But they were very nice to talk to once you gained their trust, they were quite friendly.
Harry set down his cup of coffee as he heard the two men coming down the stairs. From the sound of it, Sirius must have been dragging Mooney down. Harry hoped that he didn't wake either man, as the full moon negatively affected Remus. Even though Snape gave the werewolf the Wolfsbane potion, full moons could be extremely taxing for the older man. As Sirius and Remus entered the room and stat on the sofa, Harry smiled brightly at them. He had been worried when Sirius and Remus moved into the house. He knew they got along quite well, were married even, but isolation wasn't right for anyone. Much less if one was a slightly deranged run-away prisoner and the other was a chocolate addicted werewolf forced to spend full moons in a small room.
Harry was surprisingly good at potions. It was very similar to baking and cooking. The subject also reminded Harry of muggle chemistry, one of his favourite subjects in primary school. But he never seemed to do well in class. Slytherins kept sabotaging his attempts to make a decent potion, and he always got confused when Snape wrote something different on the board than what was in his texts. Although Snape just seemed to have it out for Harry in general, even if he understands the hatred of James Potter, it was just lousy teaching to hate a child for who their parents were.
"Ahh, thank you, I must not have been paying attention." Harry intone belatedly, realising he was being rude by just staring at his rival.
The thin banned was a shiny silver, engraved with snakes and roses. In the middle, there was a green rectangle with the words' Si Numquam, Semper Prospera' (If you never give up, you will always succeed) written in gold lettering.
Harry hardly debated what he was going to tell them. Last night, after mulling it over, he had decided what to say to them. However, he had to research and practice specific spells to make sure everything would be fine. After all, if Dumbledore found the spells were broken, he could reinstitute them, kidnap Him, or something way worse. Harry quietly looked around the room, pretending to mull it over, while he was actually wandlessly placing protection, eavesdropping spells, and finding any unwanted charms that could threaten his secrets and redirect them to a different part of the house. He didn't want to break them encase Dumbledore, or someone noticed that their magic had been tampered with.
" Sia, she fits the description to a T" Harry replied, allowing Sia to slighter out of his sleeve and onto the coffee table.
"a snake? What's their name? OHHHH, can I give a suggestion? What about Snakespear?" Sirius perked up.
"Oh please, you two pamper the boy, he needs a firm hand. A motherly hand. You know I support your relationship with Sirius, but Harry needs a woman's touch. Men were never meant to raise children. So, Remus. Go. Get. Harry", Molly screeched in a perfect imitation of an eagle owl.
year they would learn human transfiguration, which could permanently harm or kill the person that was transfigured. But Harry had never heard of anyone getting permanently injured in her class, perhaps, that’s why she had the lower stipulation.
After Harry finished the small bowl of soup and placing a couple of Knuts on the table, he rushed to the back of the building to where the entrance to the alley was concealed. Every time the doorway was opened, its amazed Harry. Although walking through the street blinded Harry with different colours and lights. The alley was always a loud, joyous place. Even amid war, the alley seemed to be a beacon of hope and happiness. The bank, however, seemed to be in a constant state of melancholy. The chilling words above the doorway and the ridged guards standing next to the bank only added to the air of gloominess surrounding the bank. The lobby of Gringotts was filled with the scratching of quills and the looming echo of footsteps.
Harry shook his head slightly to dislodge these thoughts. It was only an hour to midnight, and he had an early morning. Every morning was early, and every night was late. The first weeks of the Summer holidays always determined Harry's schedule for the rest of the time with his relatives. Wake up at 5, sneak into the kitchen for a small, unnoticeable amount of food, clean the bottom floor of the house, make breakfast, clean the bedrooms while the Dursleys are eating, do yard work, make lunch, clean the bathrooms, steal an apple from the tree in Mis. Figs garden, continue yard work, make dinner, clean the kitchen, wait for Vernon to stop yelling at him, clean the cars, clean the gardening tools, do the dishes, go to his room, and study from the books he stole from his old home, and repeat. Very steady, monotonous work. But Harry could be thankful Vernon hadn't hit him yet.
"Of course, everything is okay" Molly snapped. "We're here to see Harry. He disappeared for a week, Lupin. The boy needs some discipline. How can the boy leave his responsibilities and disregard Dumbledore's orders? Go wake him. I need to talk to him", the women ordered.
"Hadrian James Potter get your arse in here right this second," Sirius hissed lowly. Harry stepped into the house quickly, hunching his shoulders slightly. The older man seemed to eye Harry quizzically before nodding and encasing him in the tightest hug the boy had ever experienced. "Oh, Merlin Harry, I was so worried. Dumbledore just sent a letter that you'd run off and no one could find you. Never do that to me again. You hear me, young man? Never again." Sirius whispered into Harry's Hair.
"It's okay girl, we'll get out of here soon," Harry muttered lightly, "we'll get out of here as soon as we can. I don't know how or when, but we'll leave and never come back. Then you'll get to spread your wings as far as you want, perhaps we'll even get an owlery for you and any other visitors." The beautiful owl hooted and bowed her head under her wing. Harry smiled slightly at Hedwig and placed his book in the space between the floorboards. He collected his potion notes and clipped them to the book with a paperclip he found while cleaning the kitchen his first week here. Then placed the bedsheet over the small book collection to protect the books from mice or spiders and replace the floorboard to cover the area.
"Of course, Mr. Potter, may I see the test in order to explain the premise better?" asked the goblin a bit too kindly. But Harry passed over the parchment and waited for Ragnok to read his results. At first, his white eyebrows shot up in surprise. Then his face quickly drained of colour as he finished reading the test. "Mr. Potter, I must apologize, but I cannot do business with you until these blocks and potions are removed as there are affecting your mental state, and I fear you are unable to make appropriate decisions at this time. However, I can remove the spells and potions from your system, but I will need to contact Grimhook."
