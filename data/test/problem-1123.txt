Draco stepped back from Harry, falling onto the ground next to him. His head going straight into his knees as he began crying into them. Harry realized what was happening at that moment. Draco, was going through the same post-war issues as he was. If not even worse than Harry’s. Harry sat up, looking at the crying blonde and moved closer, resting a hand on the boys shoulder.
“Malfoy.” Harry stated once they were all alone. Draco looked at the ground, working up the courage to say something.
“You know, I have a secret. One that I haven’t told you.” Draco said quietly in Harry’s ear as they moved across the floor.
“Harry James Potter! Where have you been?” She pulled out of the hug. “Why do you still look like your 17 years old?” Harry looked confused.
It ended up being 7 books, all explaining his time at Hogwarts. From his story of  the issues with Voldemort every year to Harry’s and Draco’s relationship.
Harry cleared his throat. “You look amazing as well, Draco.” Draco smiled the smile Harry loved as he took a step towards Harry.
“Harry.” She answered in a small hesitant voice. Harry stood there for a long moment, the tension high in the air. Harry couldn’t stand the tension and so he walked forward, pulling her into a long lasting, tight hug. His next words he said carefully, since these would be his last.
Draco let go of Harry’s hand, and brought him into a tight hug. Even the warm embrace of the boys body next to his could make this moment better. It did help though that they got this moment. And that they had a week before Draco was to be dropped off to Azkaban and not seen again for 15 years.
“How was that? You know for your first time?” Draco asked after minutes of calming down and pulling out, spelling them both clean wandlessly. Harry looked over and Draco, still in a daze.
“Maybe I do. But right now, we both need to get to potions. You know how much Snape hates me being late. I would rather not be late anymore.”
“Mr. Malfoy, you do understand that when Harry said they use them to travel everywhere in these things, and this is a non-magic trip, it means that you will be riding in one again, correct?” Draco looked up at this and tried to hide the hated for this trip and that statement but he didn’t say anything back.
“Please... please Draco... fuck me...” the boy begged Draco. Hearing Harry beg to he fucked was the greatest thing he had heard the boy say. And he had to do as Harry asked.
“Potter... please tell me I’m dreaming...” Malfoy said next to him. Harry shook his head. “Your not dreaming Malfoy.”
After detention was over, Neville, Hermione and Harry walked through the castle with a very quiet Draco. They were about to split off, when Draco stopped Harry.
His normal, was trying to convince himself that the next day would be better. His normal, was waking up every morning, trying to find reason to be getting up again, just to fake a smile and force a laugh. His normal, was trying to figure out what his purpose was. Because day after day the last two months, he had come to a realization that his life is nothing but normal. His life is an agonizing pain that never ends.
“I’m sorry for calling you selfish Potter.” Draco said, breaking the silence. Harry kept Draco in his arms but pulled back enough to look at Draco. “Draco, you weren’t wrong. I was selfish. To leave everyone behind the way I was doing it. It was wrong of me to do something like that. And if you wouldn’t have stopped me, I would be down there, dead. If anything, I should be thank you. You made me see reason when I stopped seeing it along time ago.”
“Yes, they do. And they edit it with special effects on computers to make it look more realistic.” This lead to a full string of questions, all of which answers only resulted in more questions.
Harry was indeed a Parseltongue and Draco was completely shocked the his best friend, hid something like that from him.
“Merlin, your so tight...” he whispered at the boy who had closed his eyes to rid the pain. Harry stayed this way for a moment. “Your so... big... Merlin your so fucking big Draco.” Draco wanted to start moving at these words, fuck him hard and fast, but he waited. Until Harry opened his eyes. “Move Draco... please move...” he urged him. Draco didn’t need to be told twice.
“Things have changed since the war. I’m not the person people think I am. I don’t want to worshipped by the wizard world. I finally have a chance to discover me. Things that I’ve always wondered about by never gave much thought to.”
In front of him, on his knees was no doubt Harry Potter with a lump on his head that made him appear disfigured. He couldn't focus on Harry's appearance. Someone could come in and Crucio him over and over again until he was just a breathing, mindless body that they would float over the table like some kind of constellation prize and Draco could care less.
“I think that we should do that again. Like all the time.” Harry said with a small laugh. Draco grinned and chuckled along side Harry’s laugh.
Dracos body felt frozen. Time itself felt frozen. Was Harry Potter actually asking to go out in public and do something together? It didn’t seem very believable. How could it? Harry Potter wouldn’t want to go out with someone like Draco Malfoy. No even in the muggle world. And Draco was sure that Harry wasn’t gay so it wasn’t going in that direction either.
The best part of it all, was his eyes though. The boys grey eyes glimmered perfectly in the light that shone around them. And those eyes were staring straight back at him. He couldn’t look away. He couldn’t find the strength to look anywhere but those eyes.
“Okay, so we have 3 hours together. I told Pansy and Blaise to go ahead to Hogsmeade so I can do, quote on quote, ‘homework’.” Draco explains the moment he walks in. He makes his way to the couch, leans down and pecks Harry’s lips before falling down next to Harry.
Harry frowned. “I know this. But remember, we’ll get through this, and when we do, you and me won’t be a secret anymore. I am going to shout it out to the world that your mine. We’re going to do all the things we have talked about. Get married, have children. They’re going to have your hair and my eyes, and I’m going to love them to death. We will get through this, okay?”
The thoughts of Harry rescuing him for a sentence of Azkaban was the only thing that kept him strong, as he pictured the life they always talked about. The kids they would have. How much he wanted that.
His Melody, his beautiful sound that had became a part of Draco Malfoy was now playing not only his melody. It was as they described it all those years ago. A beautiful symphony that's sound made him want to cry tears of happiness. And from the look on Harry's face, he heard it to.
“Potter.” Harry waved off Hermione and Neville, who walked away cautiously, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
“Hermione?” He said, standing up, looking at the girl who seemed shocked to even hear Harry’s voice. He hadn’t spoken to her since she asked him if he had everything for their year at Hogwarts earlier that morning.
He didn’t have time to answer any of his questions, because before he could think more about it and make a decision, Harry had moved forward, put a hand on Dracos cheek and met his lips with a soft, drunken kiss. It seemed very hesitant at first, since Draco was stunned at the sudden contact, but once Draco had realized what was happening, he kissed the boy back feverishly, all his questions left behind, no longer mattering.
“No matter what, I will fight for you when this all over. Got it? I’m not giving up on you.” They lay there in each other’s embrace until they both had to leave.
“By the way, our song is beautiful." He said softly and for a moment in the middle of all the chaos, Draco got a small part of his dream to come true. Harry wouldn't hate him and that, even with the thought of facing Azkaban for the rest of eternity, was enough to motivate him to get through this.
“Harry,” Draco started but didn’t finished. Nothing he was going to say was going to bring harry out of this trance.
Why couldn’t he look at them without feeling guilty for being the reason any of these people were there anyways?
Draco made his way from the bots chest down to the navel area, where Harry’s cock was standing there, waiting for Draco. He looked up at Harry. Harry was staring down at Draco with so much anticipation, it was driving Draco insane. He didn’t take long to grab the boys cock in his hand, stroking it a few times, seeing the boy moan and move his hips to thrust into it. Draco smirked at how sexy it was.
He dealt with it through the cursed amulet, and the poisoned wine. Now he was staring at the boy he loved, not able to move because of the spell Dumbledore threw at him, as he watched him disarm him.
Finally his legs moved and he feel to the ground next to the lifeless body, hugging the boy to his chest, not caring that he clothes were being stained by the dead boys body. Tears feel from his eyes as he sobbed, letting out pleads for Draco to stay with him.
Word got around the school quickly that Sirius Black, the one who was in Azkaban for getting his parents murdered, and was now after Harry, had broken into the castle a second time. Only this time, he had been in his room, sleeping. That thought, terrified Draco.
"Draco! It's you! Thank Merlin it's you!" He rushed o we to the boy only to be held back inched away from him by the chains. Harry looked at Draco hopelessly.
The look on Harry’s face looked like he was about to cry and Draco walked to the boy, pulling him into a comforting hug. As always, the boy leaned into the touch and relaxed almost instantly. It made Draco feel good about himself that Harry could be so relaxed and calm around him. It meant that he trusted Harry, and that was enough to make Draco smile stupidly for days.
"Please... Harry... help me..." Harry couldn't move. No mater what he told his legs to do, they stayed locked in place as he watched the boy begging for help. Begging for Harry to help him. Begging for Harry not to let him die. And there was nothing Harry could do but watch the life slowly fade out of his eyes until there wasn't anything left there.
They made it to the dinning room and the doors were thrown open in front of him with a flick of a wand. Time seemed to freeze the moment it did.
Knowing that it will never be that same, that you had lost the one thing that you loved the most, more than anything in the entire world.
That’s how Harry felt when he heard those words. Those words that brought his whole world crumbling apart.
The walk down to the dungeons was worse than the walk to the dinning hall and he didn't think that would have been possible. The Weasley was just angrily walking the way that Draco directed. Harry on the other hand, had a look of confusion and shock on his face.
Harry woke with a start. This time he wasn't in the cupboard under that stairs. No, this time, he was in a bathroom. There was water all around him and there was a sound of painful cry's from somewhere in the bathroom. He cautiously stood up, following rather noise until he got to a very familiar looking bathroom and stopped in complete utter horror.
"Finally going to finish off the job?" He asked the one that had long blonde hair poking out. He knew who it was. The Malfoy took of the mask and Harry's heart stopped. It wasn't Lucius. It was Draco.
“I know your not, Harry. You will figure this out, okay? And if you ever need me, remember our signal.”
He couldn't tell anyone how long he had been there hugging the body. Only that when he looked up once more, he was wiping his tearful eyes with his now blood stained sleeve. They were in the Wizengamot court room. Draco wasn't dead anymore. He was sitting him a chair in the center of the room. Everyone they knew was watching Draco as he sat there.
“You know, after dinner each night, we are free to do whatever we want. And we’re both old enough to go out. We could go out... to a muggle place... like a bar.”
“It’s okay Harry. Just relax okay? I’m going to make this amazing for you. I promise you, I know how to make you feel good.” Harry nodded and Draco moved up to kiss Harry, distracting him as he placed one finger in softly. Harry’s gasped at the intrusion and Draco waited for Harry to adjust to the finger before he began moving it in and out of Harry.
He watched Draco untie the robe and slid it down to the floor. Harry shook his head when he saw Draco was wearing something so thin he could make out his skin, something transparent that he could see silk panties.
There was no answer for a while. Draco did not force anything out of him. He just wanted to let things out for a bit before this escalate to something even more confounding. Things aren’t the same like before but it don’t mean things can
They stare at one another, calculating and unblinking. It felt like that night again as the Great Hall felt constricting and lacks enough air for breathing.
“Oh, come on! I can see the gears in your head turning. Potions here, questions there. I mean, are you two really that thick?” Ginny asked.
“This is the best way to ensure my safety, sugar! Hold me” he demanded like some clingy alpha in tow.
Harry walked behind him and bent down to his knees. Draco was aware Harry laid the handcuffs and blindfold on either side of him.
Then he buffered. Roaring Lions. His lips parted as one by one, motorbikes came swarming in. Neville handed him another white rose before taking his place beside Theo.
The two were sleeping peacefully. They are cuddled close and tight to one another. It was such a sight as Neville signed with his index finger to keep quiet as Ginny ushered them away soundlessly.
When he was laying in the guest room, staring at the ceiling above him. He thought about things. Things that he didn’t think about when he’s in the Malfoy Manor. For a little while, it convinced him that maybe he should return this day to settle the unseen yet also, expectedly, foreseen situation. If you could even call it that.
She nearly let out a keening noise. Nearly gave all of herself away. This was far too intimate for the public dance floor. Too many eyes, too many onlookers. But fuck, she didn’t care anymore.
“Lie down here. This would just take for two minutes to make sure you’re healthy and to check on your little beanie” Andy smiled at them.
His mind thrummed and a tingling feeling settling on his nape. He tried to distract himself with other things, talking to Susan every now and then until they were done eating.
, please” he mewled and squealing when Harry suddenly yanked his jeans open and sliding them down to his legs. His eyes rolled back when Harry enveloped his cock with his hand, slowly pumping his palm up and down.
He closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against hers, needing her to cum already as he began to feel that pleasurable feeling in his balls, the tightening, and the faltering of his pace. He needed to cum but would not.
“Blimey, I’m burned out” Seamus complained in the background, “What ye mates say ‘bout some alcohol, ey?”
He smiled and settled down on the bed as he looked at the innocent coat laying on the chair at the corner.
Her eyes rolled at the back of her head when his fingers dipped in her sternum. His lips hovering at her throat and leaving feathery kisses. He sticked his tongue out and lick a wet striped at the side of her neck before giving it a bite.
McGonagall raised a hand, cutting him off. She inhaled sharply, her eyes sharpened for a second before she let them soften into that of her Gryffindor motherly tenderness, “Things are well, Potter. Perhaps it wasn’t the potion. Perhaps it is just you worrying”
“What can I do for you, Mr. Malfoy?” Harry asked, clasping his hands together and fixing him a gentle gaze, goodness still written all over his face.
The way his cheeks would redden when he’s caught staring, the appreciation he feels when Harry’s lips tug upwards then reddening in return.
His parents have lived through the ages of being known as the loveliest couple so they expected Harry to settle down as well with a nice omega and good number of children but where’s the fun in settling down when it’s not your soulmate?
It didn’t take long until they arrived at the bar Draco used to visit almost every night. The bouncer who recognized him immediately let them in and he squealed at the excitement surging inside him.
She took the trouble out of him as she patted his arms carefully, “What did I say? Hogwarts always know what to do”
Harry raised an eyebrow at him and shook his head, “It’s for me to handle. Don’t worry yourself about it”
He used to look so healthy. What monsters did he have to face? More cruel than her own? Traumatizing like Harry’s?
Harry grunted as he stared at the sweaty back, the way her back would move as if it was creating abstract illusions that makes him want to kiss her all over. Feel her skin over his skin and smell the scent that caged him like no other.
“Kiss you” he pecked his nape, “Taste you” his tongue darted out to lick his cheek, “And fill you so full of me” his pulled his fingers out, smearing saliva on his chin and jaw.
After the dinner, it was even more of a surprise when Harry had offered a dance with no music. But to them, as they were dancing in the heart of the living room, alone, they were thoroughly enjoying their own rhythmic pattern. Nothing choreographed but enough to lift a loving smile on both of their faces.
When evening came around, he was even more agitated than usual. He tried calling Blaise who never answered then dialed Hermione’s phone who was out of reach. He didn’t have all of their phone numbers and sure as hell they don’t have any social media. Pansy and Ron’s phones were turned off and after hundred of missed calls, Harry’s phone died down.
Harry smiled, warm breath hitting him on the face as he leaned more, their noses almost touching, “You blew me a kiss”
He ran his free hand up and down his legs, feeling the way his muscles relaxed under his palms and slowly, his breathing returned to normal.
Dracy gently laid the picture beside her and reached out. Merlin. This wasn’t supposed to be their morning. The morning that should happen is them angry from last night’s mess.
His mouth water at the sight of it before he tentatively lick a stripe up from the balls to the mushroom head, “There’s only one lesson for you, daddy” he murmured.
Harry was patient to walk in her pace considering the huge baby bump on her and the way she can literally feel her milk at the bra she’s wearing. Maybe it would’ve been better if she asked to go back and Harry can just help her out a bit?
Harry shook his head before he smirked, “Baby” he called out, feeling Draco shivered and eventually, mewled. Now that sounded lecherous.
“I would wish to watch you dance to another song but I’ve seen it well enough and wouldn’t want to spoil the possibilities for a next time” the implications, the implications made arousal find their way in his nether regions.
He wanted things, things he craves but he was full of hesitations. Hesitations caused by the potion. Mainly by the pearl dust because he didn't want to do things the pearl dust 'might' be pushing them to do.
She rested her cheek on top of his head and bit her bottom lips, fighting for her tears. She couldn’t let herself fall because this time, she should be the wall Harry needs.
“What now?” he asked, careful to control how he acts. He cannot impulsively and recklessly act in front of the Alpha who has all the qualities to fuck an omega’s brain out.
Up from their spot, they can see thousand miles. The Black lake, Quidditch pitch, the Forbidden Forest. It offer a  lot of perspective, one Harry might need.
Harry sighed when Draco is no longer on view. He palmed his face and sighed for several times. It would be better if he’s just guarding some kid who’s known for troubles like pranks, not following bed time, and whatnot.
“Ye know we can bet on friendly Quidditch match with the Hufflepuffs. Just some warm up game before yer next match with the Slytherins next week” Seamus broke the silence, wiggling his eyebrows at Harry.
He has a lot of questions. He wanted to talk about last night with him but he just had to have emergency when Draco needed his time.
His fingers slid up to Draco’s arms, feeling the soft skin. He can feel his cock reacting to what he is doing and the way Draco tensed up and noticed the way his head tilted to the side where it nearly rested on Harry’s hand on the wall.
Harry tossed his boxers on the floor and pumped his cock for a few times, whispering another lubrication charm and guiding it to Draco’s hole, “Going to warm me all night, princess. Is that alright?”
He knelt just in front of him and gently lifted his chin to look at him, Harry gasped when saw shining streaks of tears running down his chin.
He stayed inside the cabinet to what felt like hours, ignoring the noises he heard that came after a while of waiting. The grumbles and shouts and the ringing of emergency alarms blaring all around the house.
The laptop loaded up fast and he rejoiced when he finally saw the wallscreen, files displayed on the desktop with names he can understand and some were numbers he cannot really decipher.
Ron had owled him for the progress of what he asked him to do and Harry was informed that the Daily Prophet is subjected to take a month suspension, signed and agreed by Kingsley. He also stated that Hermione initiated to take another week of his workload to make sure he spend some time with her.
Is Draco not obvious enough that he is Harry’s baby?! Isn’t it obvious enough that he will claw whoever flirts with his daddy? Isn’t it obvious that he’s the one who he sleeps in his bed and did people forget that he is still a cunning Slytherin?
“Relax, father. I’ll get what you want in no time” Draco mumbled over the phone, keeping his father updated to what’s happening. But making sure to leave the physical touches out of the way, he doesn’t need to know his tactics to get some important stuff.
“And I’m sure you do engage in some leisure time” Draco stated, left hand finding it’s way under the table, palm rolling against Harry’s knee.
“It’s not a problem. It’s an issue. That minister betrayed us and wanted to get something from us in exchange of keeping our secret” Lucius answered.
“W-what happened?” he wasn’t sure if he wants to know but Harry always came back without a bruise before. Why now? Was it really about what Fred said?
Harry made sure to locked the whole place before turning his head to see Draco biting his bottom lip. "I want ride...that" he pointed at Harry's motor.
It wasn’t the fact that someone who races with gravity and challenges death itself that unnerves Draco Malfoy. It wasn’t that this someone has been trying his best to worm his way in.
Draco began to read as Harry fumbled with his quill, grunting as he look at the parchment laid out in front of him. His to-do list full in display.
It turns out her heat was the ticket to have Harry beside her. His touch that never left her side since then. Those unrelenting hands wandering around her body, feeling her, caressing her sensually, kissing her shoulder, her breasts, her lips, her cheeks, and everywhere it could reach.
Draco gasped. He temporarily forgot the anger he should be having. That came out of the blue. He was shocked hearing Harry refer to himself as his daddy.
After their visit to St. Mungos, Andy let them use her floo and Harry took him in an unfamiliar place. It looked new.
The silence that followed once more was predictable for a reaction. But the nonchalant expression on their faces threw Harry off a bit. He always hated being left alone in the dark, he had to know something or he will lose his shit.
He got away with it for about a month, telling the others he just needed time. He was really good at putting on a smile and making himself look like it was all fine on the outside. Because as he told his friends and close ones; he just needed time.
“Draco, look are me.” Draco looked at Harry, the grey eyes that Harry was beginning to love staring back at his green ones.
They were able to get out 2 books a year, and by the end of the last book was finished, everyone was talking about it them. And everyone knew that Draco Malfoy was actually innocent.
A surge of relief shot through his body as he saw the boy was no longer dead. He stood up immediately, his goal to embrace the boy. To hold him and cry into his shoulders. To tell him how sorry he was for something... his brain couldn't comprehend why he was sorry, only that he was.
With one last look over the common room, only a few students in the room still, he left the room, to do his last final walk through the halls. He walked out of the door to the halls and put his invisible cloak on. He didn’t want to be seen and stopped. He knew that someone was bound to ask the question of why he was walking around at such a late hour of the night.
Harry only nodded his head, allowing Draco to lead him into the kitchen. Dinner was quickly started and while they waited for it to be finished in the oven, they sat in each other’s arms.
“Malfoy, it was a war for Merlins sake. A war that no one wanted to fight in. A war, that he were both forced into. Hermione? She was there because she wanted to be. Ron? He was there because he wanted to be. You and me, we were forced into it. And it’s not right that the two people that know exactly what it was like shouldn’t be close. Am I wrong?”
Hands grabbed his wrist as he went to dart forward though. He looked back, seeing both Hermione and Ron holding him down.
He knew the few places he had wanted to go before he left this world. One, was the old potions classroom. The one he had hated for so long, but it was also the one place the man he had respected in the end, had spent all his time. Severus Snape, the man who had tormented him every single day, but in the end, he was a good man.
He walked into the giant hole in the wall of the great hall and looked around at everyone. He saw the bodies of Lupin and Tonks. His mind went to their tiny little baby Teddy. Teddy would never have the chance to know his parents. He would never have the chance to grownup with a loving mother and a loving father.
"Thank you Draco." Draco didn't have to turn around to see that Harry's green eyes were glowing with emotion. He didn't turn around immediately but smiled to himself, glad no one could see it for the moment.
"We have all been talking and we came up with a decision. You being death everywhere you go. No one is happy when your around. All you do is bring drama and unhappiness. And I never forgave you for killing my son." Harry stared at them all with his mouth open wide, trying to think of something to say. The beg then to stay with him.
"Ron," he said through the tears. His heart hurt. He didn't know how much more he could take of this.
A spell rang through the air, a light came flying at Harry before he was hit with said spell and that was the last thing he remembered before the world grew black.
“I think we should go and find everyone Malfoy. We should be looked at after being hit with something. Besides, everyone should be looking for us. It has to been a few hours with how bright it is.”
Harry immediately decided that the best course of action was to lay down on the bed that was his and because there was literally nothing to do, he spent about ten minutes trying to decide if he wanted to talk to Draco. Every minute he would turn, look at Draco for a long moment, looking like he was trying to figure something out, and then look away.
It official began, when Harry’s name pulled front eh goblet. Ron had abandoned him, Hermione refusing to pick a side, stayed with Ron a lot, and Draco acted strange.
He placed his wand on the ground, he didn’t need it where he was going. He would never need it again. He stood up, his mind completely content with what was about to happen, and he took his small walk to the edge, more than ready to give into death. He wasn’t scared. In fact, he was perfect fine. He had died before. Death wasn’t scary. It was peaceful. It was as if the world was no longer on his shoulders. And that was what he longer for. It was what he craved more than anything in the world. It was what he was ready to face. He closed his eyes, ready to take his last step of the edge.
He continued being dragged off, until they got to a dark space that eventually Harry could place together as a forest. Voldemort was there. And next to him stood Draco. The look on Dracos face paralyzed him in place. Draco shouldn't look like that. Something was wrong. Why did Draco look like he hated him?
The ride to the castle, was exactly how he would want his last trip to be. The glow of the castle off in the distance, slowly get closer and closer was why he had done this. Hogwarts has always been his home. No matter how crazy his life was there, he always come back to the school with the sense of calmness. He could picture that first night his first year, when the lights had Illuminated off the lake in dancing, shimmering beauty. He remembered the feeling and even now, in the final hours of his life, he looked back at how excited and nervous he had been. He was envious of the innocence of that younger boy.
And that wasn’t even the worst of it! When they came back for their eighth year, they all got put in the eighth year dormitories, all being paired with one other student. Draco had been paired with the boy. And it was an absolutely nightmare. The boy had no boundaries when it came to dressing in front of the very gay, Draco. It was absolutely torture.
“Harry,” he grabbed the mans chin, and pulled it up to look at him. Their eyes meet, both glazed over from the tears. “My love, we still have one week together before I have to leave. We were granted this small little moment to say our goodbyes, so how about we enjoy it. We can start by eating dinner, and then we can go get ready for bed. Okay?”
Draco looked down at the floor, trying to collect his thoughts, Harry not knowing what he would hear from him. But Draco finally broke the silence after what felt like forever to Harry.
“Rose, you better have a good reason to be interrupting my class.” Even the voice sounded like her. She turned and face the girl who was now known as Rose. Harry’s heart stopped.
“Malfoy,” Harry spoke softly, “I’m sorry. I had no idea it was so bad for you. I mean, I should have known. I should have known we were going through this stuff.” Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes red and puffy, tears staining his face.
“No matter what, you come to me if you ever feel like you did tonight. And one day, after I’ve had a child, and I’ve fulfilled what the family needs, I will give it all up if I meant that I could do this with you everyday. For now, we need to keep it quiet though. Okay?”
With that, he leaned forward, meeting Draco’s lips in a soft kiss. Draco was completely taken aback, but once he realized what was happening, he kissed Harry back. And they didn’t pull away from each other until they both were out of breath.
Listening to Draco go on and on about how he was going to tell his father about this, and how he shouldn’t even be here, was the last thing Harry wanted to do. It was like the boy never shut up about anything.
Draco glared at Harry. “Did you just compare me to a muggle?” He crossed his arms and Harry laughed at this.
The sorting hat ceremony was great to watch. The little 11 years olds all walking up with nervousness as they got sorted into their respective houses. He remembered all those years back, sitting up there on that same stole, the sorting hat telling him he would be great in slytherin. His thoughts went back to those of Draco Malfoy and the question he had always asked himself. What if Harry and Draco had been in the same house? Would they have gotten close? Would they have been friends? Could Harry have saved the boy from becoming a death eater?
Who would want to be denied their soulmate? Especially when the thought of being loved endlessly was something any sane person would hope for in their lives.
That was until around Easter time, nearly 9 months after Draco had let the death eaters into the school and Albus Dumbledore had been killed, there was a knock at his bedroom door.
“I didn’t stop talking to you because your name was pulled out of the Goblet. Not like Weasley did. I didn’t make the buttons to humiliate you either. I did them because...” Draco paused and stop moving.
“Yes. Ron and Hermione already lectured me about it. But in my defense I didn’t even know I was doing it. I thought every wizard could talk to snakes. I’ve been doing it since I was a child.” Draco stared at him in disbelief, but he knew that Harry wasn’t lying. Harry was an awful liar.
He moved his moth down, letting his tongue come out to like the tip of Harry’s cock, swirling it around as Harry gasped, his body doing anything to move. Draco placed his mouth over the cock, holding Harry’s hips down, so he didn’t trust into his mouth, and began bobbing his head up and down, taking in all of Harry. The moans thats escape Harry’s throat drive Draco move faster.
"Mate, why are you talking to him? I would rather be locked up than look at this low life wizard." Draco ignored the comment and so did Harry. Harry shook his head.
That is how it’s been for the first 3 months of school since they have been back. Today though, it was about to get worse.
The train was a rather quiet one, as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger sat in their compartment, making their way to their eighth and final year of Hogwarts. If you asked Harry, he didn’t want to be here. After the war, Harry feel into a deep depression that unfortunately, he still wasn’t out of. But there was only so long that he could sit in the Grimmauld Place, getting drunk on some cheap muggle brand whiskey, and drink his pain and sorrows away, day after day.
They had made a good distance away from the commotion of the dinning room when Harry stopped walking.
“I’m very happy your think so. You were the only one I could invite out to do something like this. Hermione and Ron... they don’t understand it really. After the war, I was going through a really hard time. I mean who wouldn’t be. I literally died and came back to life. And all the people that died along side me in the war... Malfoy, I have nightmares about it. And they will never understand why getting drunk to avoid the nightmares helps me. They don’t understand why I suddenly don’t want to be a Auror. Or why I want nothing to do with Ginny, the girl whose clearly in love with the image of me and not me as a person.”
Their kiss grew more intimate in time, both of them exploring each other’s mouths, each of them getting lost in the feeling of the other until they were both completely breathless and needed to pull away from air. Harry couldn’t get the smile off his face, his hair a bigger mess than usually from the hands that had been tangled in his hair. Draco looked the same way, hair in a mess.
Before he had a chance to say no, his head moved as if it wasn’t his own, nodding in agreement. That smile on Harry’s face grew as the boy looked quite excited and relieved.
The girl, shocked at first, ended up hugging back, melting into Harry arms. “Harry, I love you too. I’m always here for you, okay? Things will get better.” The words sent an avalanche of emotions through him, emotions that he pushed back the best he could. She pulled away from Harry. “Goodnight Harry. I will see in the morning.” Harry watched at she walked up the stairs, watching his friend leave the room for the very last time.
He didn’t know how long he had been in there. Only that he didn’t care to look to see who was calling his name. Only that the name echoed of in the distance. Or was it even his name? He didn’t know anymore. He didn’t know why he was here looking at the boy withering away in the corner.
And still, to this day, it’s said that they can be found together in their little abandoned classroom. Only this time, not in secret.
“I don’t remember much anymore. But this boy... if I look away... he will disappear. I-I saw him. He was in... in a bathroom. And he was almost dead. And... I couldn’t save him from the room with all the people. They took him here. And then I got put here because... I killed all the people I cared about. And now... all that matters is this boy. If I look away, he might die. Or maybe I will die. He told me to give up. That it didn’t matter anymore. I should give up. But this boy needs me.”
He shook his head, refusing to say more after. His knees wobbled as hands cupped his cheeks and tilting them up to stare at him. It bore to him like daggers but were not close to anything painful.
“Guess a little visit to Diagon Alley could start up a fire, huh?” he said, voice cold and is at all. . . dangerous.
Harry sighed as he finished up his warding process. Inspecting the whole place, he made sure everything is in its place and secured.
“Ssh. Calm down” Harry run a hand up and down her back comfortably, massaging her tensed shoulder right after as he leaned and peck a kiss on her cheek. He didn’t pull back as he look at the side of her beautiful face, “I’m sorry. I’m just worried and want to make sure the baby is alright. If you’re scared, be scared in my arms”
“I do. You’re stunning, beautiful, cheeky and all but young” Harry confessed, noticing the way Draco tried to bite back a smile.
As Harry lifted his lips to let out a coy smirk, Dracy raised an eyebrow. She judged the meaning but did not dare question it. She watch the man lift his glass to take a sip of his branded whiskey, neat.
He began to wander along the apartment. It was a simple one, nice and homey. All supplies provided with foods and all. Furniture complete and wide array of DVDs and music player like it was the 80’s. There was this authentic style of older generation which surprisingly pleased him.
Little gasps and pants rang out of her lips as Harry pushed in inch by inch, spreading her wide and he swore out loud when she clenched around him.
“Alpha” she whimpered, her head kept turning left and right and for a few while, she would try to turn her head to look at the man who’s taking her from behind.
He melt on his arms when his captor lifted him up easily, making his way towards the cabin. He was easily navigating the forest, easily knowing where’s where without trails, symbols, arrows, signs.
Harry nodded. That’s what’s he’s thinking about too. Think like an adult. But how could he? Maybe he can think like one but certainly cannot act like one anymore when it comes to Draco.
Draco turned into one corner in the east wing and opened a door to reveal a spacious room inside. A king sized bed in the middle of the room, adorned with the finest silk sheets and blanket with a few pillows stacked at the headboard and a light decoration of flowers and a good aroma of lavender. There is a love chair at the edge of the bed facing the window to the veranda and another door for the private en suite. A closet cabinet is situated at the left side of the bed and a coat rack.
“Taste so good, daddy” Draco pulled his hand back and made sure to scoop all of his cum on his face and went to straddle Harry.
As the footsteps drew nearer, his breath hitched and his chest heaved. He gripped the edge of the shirt tight. Regret washing his whole being and practicing how to convey how sorry he was for this action.
Draco gasped and his back arched close to Harry’s chest. This wasn’t like his ex’s kisses. This wasn’t like all the kisses he got from the past.
But when Harry pushed him into that wall after a particularly bad mission, his hold crumble like how an iceberg is to a forceful impact.
She tried to approach him one night, asked him if everything is alright between them and only to be cut of from an emergency owl from work. She’s doesn’t even know who’s the real Harry anymore. This cold Harry or the warm Harry.
Biting her lip, she complied. Her heart’s beating frantically inside her chest. She doesn’t want to be punished but Harry’s gentle eyes told her he wasn’t going for a punishment. When she was in front of him, he pulled her into his lap sideways and leaned his chin above her shoulder, his arms encircling her waist to draw her closer to his warm body.
He wiped the sweat on her forehead before taking a seat beside her and gathered her limp body close to hers, “How are you feeling?”
“That’s it. Fuck, that’s it, Draco. You look so pretty like this” he whispered as he started to chase his own orgasm, “So beautiful for me. All mine now”
“Baby, b-baby” he whispered, feeling like he was about to pass out. Fuck!  Why is this taking so long?!
He might as well have this where it’s good. A real thing. Something to remember day by day with a smirk and a raging hard-on rather than feel the regret of not touching Draco when he had the chance.
“I’m good, thanks. How are you, Professor?” he asked kindly, a tad uncomfortable when McGonagall did not even blink at him. She raised one eyebrow at him, eyes trailing down from head to toe before it settled back on his face.
They turned around the corner and before he could even say anything, he was surprised when he got hauled inside a phone booth, suddenly caged between Harry’s arms. He blinked like a dumbass as he stared in Harry’s throat, taking in the way his adams apple bobble. It shockingly looks so nice.
Massage. There are a lot of possibilities that can happen if he’s to massage Draco and fuck yes but hell no.
“They helped a lot of people and when they were gone, I had to take full responsibility. I finished my studies as early as I can. Traveled through different countries for an internship and came back and took what used to be my father’s title at the Ministry”
Scared but halfway feeling calm under the tenderness, he closed his eyes and gave the man a kiss on the tip of his nose. He heard a surprised gasp from the pant followed by strong arms encircling around his lithe waist and pulling him to his lap. His combat pants rough against Draco’s bare thighs as he nuzzled in the crook of his neck.
He didn’t let him lean away as one strong arm pulled him close, his bare chest to his own while the other smoothed the furrows between his eyebrows.
Harry clenched his jaw, gripping his glass of water and taking a sip in hopes of calming his nerves.
He ruffled his hair in need to finish all the documents then go to bed, sleep then go to the Ministry tomorrow. But something is trying to knock inside him, clawing its way out and he knows what is it.
“H-harry?” she hesitated because she wasn’t sure whether it’s alright for her to ask what’s happening.
He can’t wait for this to be over. Harry beside him was busy looking around, an arm once again locked around his waist to keep him close and Draco was focused on the body heat he can feel even from all the clothes on them.
“I thought you knew better” the man clicked his tongue before he pulled the shirt off and helping him wear the new one, “Drink. It’ll soothe you”
It could also get dangerous. He knows about a few reported cases of unmated omega rushing to the hospital needing to get treated because their heat was so painful and hard to handle. He weighed his choices and sighed.
When Leo took her hand, they walked towards the living room. Laughing at the way the three kids are hauling their father and smearing his suit with the flour. Her smile widened when Leo pulled his hand away and ran to their father.
"You know the east wing is where our bedrooms are. The west wing would be where the other guest rooms are and my friends sleep there." Draco pointed at the way to the west wing.
“You’re so pretty to me like this. Wish you could just see yourself” he whispered, teeth grazing her lobe teasingly, a hand touched her stomach, fingers dancing against her skin.
“Dressing up like a cock hungry whore. You’re practically begging for me, darlin’. Begging to have my cock shoved inside you, fucking you until you only known my name” Harry snarled, “Ruin you for all others”
Draco whimpered, curses flying out of his mouth but yelping in  surprise when Harry tugged on his hair.
. He cursed. Slumping down beside Draco, not even acknowledging when he carefully pulled a fraction of the blanket to his thighs. He watched his friends having fun near the lake.
The way he sniffed her isn’t something creepy, it was relaxing. The way those strong arms hugged her securely, pulling her to that rock hard chest, and inhaled the scent Harry released on his own. Providing her what she had provided for him as well.
“And if I ask you the same thing, would you answer? I doubt that. Because you’re a selfish bastard who can only think about himself—
“Yes. After all, this gentleman deserves to have some fun” she knew she’s risking it, she knows she’s putting herself to peril, trapping her to what awaits her but she’s enjoying it. Enjoying the way there’s an immediate tick in his sharp jaw and the way his eyes flashed with annoyance, "With me"
But the pain she was in right now. The way her sweat slid down her forehead like crazy, to the contorted expression of absolute pain to the way she closed her eyes and scrunched her nose. The way she was suffering. The way his omega, his girl was obviously in too much pain right now. Not even listening to Andy’s words of encouragement.
Then the last ones came into view. Oliver, Percy, Hannah, Angelina, Parvati, Padma, Fleur, Bill, Viktor, Pansy, Hermione, and lastly Blaise. His head looking around them with their smiling faces and the scowling ones from the Greengrass sisters. They successfully formed into circle with a gap from the side. His hands were overflowing with roses.
Draco went out of his bathroom with a joyful smile. He loves riling Harry and watch him bit by bit lose the control he's trying so hard to keep together. Draco is sure he will find his way in. He would crack him up and seduce him and call him to his bed.
“Merlin, look at you” Harry filthily whispered. He loved the way Draco writhed under him but nonetheless, pliant.
He leaned on the counter, not bothering to sit by the stool as he waved over to the bartender who knows him better than anyone in this place. The bartender immediately got to work, already knowing his order.
“Sssh” Harry shushed and inserted a finger. All morals thrown aside because his godfather is right. Sirius is right.
And as one by one, they scattered off, Draco returned his eyes on Harry who was currently smiling at him, “Thank you so much, angel. I love you”
Dracy got the signal and shamelessly opened her legs wide, providing Harry the sight of damp lace panties and a growl erupted deep from his throat. He pulled away and quickly removed his own clothes, wanting nothing but to bury his hard cock inside her, to feel her tight pussy hugging him and pump her full of his cum and pepper kisses and coo at their baby.
Draco shivered as he slowly buffered the meaning of his statements. Felt cold ice water metaphorically washing over his figure.
“Catch the snitch! I’m warning you, Harry!” Seamus shouted, waving the new eight year flag at the stands, “Score some more!”
“Harry?” she called, eyes glued to the quilt laying innocently on the couch. It looked rather inviting and drawing her in. The only thing she wanted was to wrap it around herself.
He turned to look at him and shook his head, "Oh no. You're not going anywhere until I finish up the wards and we've spoken about the rules"
"It's that potion that blew on our faces, right Professor?" Harry asked for confirmation, thankful of at least getting some answer.
“Oh, nothing. I just thought you want to hear something about him. Everyone knows the mighty stalking that happened before. Was it the wrackspurts or nargles pushing you to follow him? You didn’t wear the necklace I gave you?”
In other circumstance, he’d consider this a very loving action. Something he’d been jealous of at times. The idea of having someone to lean on has been eating his midnight thoughts, consuming him and letting him forget the idea of eating his muggle popcorns courtesy from his bestfriend Prongsie.
Would Harry ever give this up or would Draco be the one to let things go? Follow Harry’s way because he’s the one in control? He cannot help but wonder how things are if the two of them settle in peace.
Harry whistled as he literally moon walked to Draco’s table the next day. Carrying that nice box of chocolates and that shit-eating grin plastered over his handsome face.
He took this job because it called out to him. Be as bold, as voyeuristic, as someone who moves to enchant the crowd, charm them for his  benefit, woo them with his moves, call out without a word.
“Come on. Want to hear those pretty little whimpers for me, tiger. Want to hear my name from your lips, the noises, let me know I’m making you feel this good” Harry said roughly, his palm suddenly cupping her clothed pussy and Dracy moaned loudly, "Only
He pouted. He’s adorable. Why didn’t Harry hug him afterwards? Why didn’t he compliment him for being such a good boy?
Then he began to walk away again and Harry followed. He noticed they are walking towards the west wing before his eyes kept going downwards again.
“Are you…pregnant?” he asked, voice low and neutral. There’s no contempt, hate, or anything that would indicate he’s mad at her. For a second, it somehow comforted her a bit. But the lack of reaction is stressful.
Harry inserted another finger and began to slid his fingers in and out of his mouth. He gave him another kiss on his cheek before giving one more at the side of his eyebrow, “So beautiful. Doing so good for me, baby. I’m proud of ‘ya. Daddy’s proud of 'ya”
He peck a kiss on the other side of his lips, “Rough” a kiss on his chin, “Shameless” a kiss on his cupid’s bow, “Make you beg” he stick his tongue out and lick his bottom lip.
“Boring. I have to stare at documents for hours and read until my back is aching” Harry groaned in irritation and stretched his arms upwards until he can hear some of his bones crack.
When he reached his department, he saw different heads seriously working. Such workaholics. Why can’t they be like him? Striving, happy, and surely blooming.
When Sirius heard that familiar disappointed click of tongue, he stilled. He willed himself to focus on Remus’ eyes. He wanted to bent down and kiss him deep on the lips with tongues and all.
“Draco Malfoy?” the voice was low and deep, with precise calculation and Draco bit his lip by the roughness of his tone. Just the voice itself woke something inside him. Something a bit primal, a need that he didn’t know was even there.
but the mind in her told her to fight it. He was the only one who managed to dare try to break that.
The three other staffs he could only afford to employ are busy on their own duties. He looked at his phone when he felt it buzzed.
“Not only so you can lean on me but also so I could lean on you” Harry bent down and her eyes widened when he kissed her lips.
With the equal love she can see from his eyes, she cupped his cheeks and confessed the same, “I love you too, Harry. And this is absolutely perfect”
“The raid in Hogsmeade, the team you newly arranged for me, and the meeting you assigned me to handle!”
Harry moved his hand to hold his palm, the back of Draco’s hand in view as he gave it one smooth kiss before letting go.
“Fuck! My fault again? What is this?” Harry said, seemingly forgetting how to use magic, “It’s fucking bad”
Their first night together is magical not just because it was such a hot steamy night but because they managed to settle what’s stopping them both from accepting to be in each other’s arms. They fucked and Harry took care of him and lulled him to sleep, hugged him for the rest of the night and he woke up with his kisses this morning.
The two spouses watched their sons walk away, hand in hand and Lucius sighed deeply, trying to rephrase the century old curses at the tip of his tongue.
Draco turned his head and raised an eyebrow before turning back to his work, “You will not buy me with your flowers”
. Draco breathed heavily, hands clenching as he laid there all bare for Harry to see, flushed and already too dazed,
His hand moved from its place on her waist and gave a squeeze of her breast for a few times, “Wanna taste your milk”
“Why the fuck are you my husband?!” he’s just ready to faint. Faint and toss every braincell into the next century.
He watched a guy give another guy lovebites on the neck, he watched two girls make out with tongue and all, he watched a woman crawl to a man's lap and fucking grinded her hips to his crotch, he watched Pansy downed five glasses of firewhiskey when she refused to blow a man in front of them and it got her several boos, he watched two teens grope each other and moaned.
“Calm down. Eat your breakfast” Pansy spoke again and annoyingly, Draco turned his head to look at her and raised an eyebrow, “Do you think I can have the energy to calm down when Harry is flirting with someone?”
“Ooh, Harry” Draco quakes, his nails digging through Harry’s skin. He growled on his neck when he felt the pain that came with it but still superb. He lifted Draco’s shirt off and threw it away somewhere.
“Aren’t you cold?” he asked, seeing Draco only on his pajamas. He shrugged. He was cold alright but how would he just say that casually?
When someone finally did come for him, he looked up to see everyone he cared for standing there in front of him. They weren't in the court room anymore. They were in a room with a single chair and they were all standing around him, while he sat in the chair. They all looked down on him with hateful eyes. Molly Weasley was the one to step up and speak.
Hermione Granger had declined, getting a better offer to work in the Magical Creatures department. Besides, it was to much being back there after all that had happened.
From the time Draco made the buttons, to the moment after Harry competed in the first task, Draco and Harry barely talked. If Harry hadn’t been so focused on his own confusion and hurt, he would have seen Draco wasn’t doing much better.
After the Room of requirement, he walked out of the school halls to the small little hut that had smoke coming from even smaller chimney. Harry still remembered the look on Hagrids face when Harry had walked out into the cleaning deep in the forest, ready for death. He remembered how upset he had been. Hagrid, had been the first person to show Harry kindness. These were moments that Harry would cherish now, even as he set out to end his life.
“ it wasn’t just those. You were also a death eater who wanted me dead... I knew I had feelings for you, but I had never know how strong they were. I hadn’t realized my sadness had gotten so bad... I just dealt with it. You were with me everyday when we caught the dark creatures and I ignored the signs because no matter how much I fell for you, nothing could stop it. But I couldn’t say anything because... if I did there was a chance you would run away. And I couldn’t have you run away from me.”
When Harry was called up to demonstrate, he wanted to die at that moment. Everyone was staring at him, and he hated the attention more than anything in the world.
But Draco did. Draco understood what Harry felt and not only that, he was able to comfort Harry like no one had been able to before.
“Do you want to dance, Harry? I didn’t spend all those months with teaching you to dance for nothing, you know.” Harry breath hitched in his throat as he nodded, and took a step towards Draco, who had his arms out waiting for Harry to come forward.
“I realized something, Harry. And I don’t think I can keep it in any longer. Not after how you looked tonight. Not after watching you dance with some girl. I need to tell you this, and if you never want to speak to me again, I accept my fate.”
“I think I might be gay.” He said almost to quietly. Draco stared at Harry for a long moment not saying anything as the gears in his head processed that statement.
Harry had done it. He had done the things he wanted to do, seen the last places he wanted to see, and say the last goodbyes he wanted to say. This was the part of the movie when you thought there would be a happy ending, but you find out that there never was going to be a happy ending. This is the part where they had continued rolling the camera, in hopes to see what would come next, but it was cut out since it was to graphic, and of course it didn’t paint the main character in a good light.
They got there and Draco opened the door for them before closing it once and locking his soulmate in a dungeon.
Harry's world turned dark as he screamed. This couldn't be happening. Draco was innocent! The tears came back as he screamed and yelled for someone to listen to him. For someone to let him go. No one heard him of course. And if they did, they ignored him completely. Draco didn't though. Draco took one long look at him and shook his head before following the Aurors out of the courtroom.
Harry nodded his head. “Yes, I am sure. I’m taking this potion to make myself fertile like we always talked about, and we are going to each lose our virginity to each other. Even if it doesn’t work, there’s still the possibility it does. That way we can still have a child like we wanted to, and when your out, he will be ours.”
Harry followed and pulled back enough to look at Draco’s face. He looked completely nervous. More nervous than Harry was.
The first thing they did, was get back into those sickening muggle ‘cars’, and drove to this place called a ‘movie theater’. Draco didn’t exactly know what to expect, but they all decided to watch this comedy movie that ended up being quite funny, even for Draco. And the entire experience seemed to be an eye opener for Draco.
“Harry.” The voice sounded serious and yet so full of emotion. “I need you to look at me because I am not withering away and neither is that boy, because the really Draco Malfoy is right here. I didn’t die in the bathroom. I didn’t get taken to Azkaban. You saved me. This isn’t real.”
At the beginning of class one Monday, the professor walked in announcing that they as they were all adults, they were allowed, more like required to go on a weekend trip to a muggle city, where they would be staying in a muggle hotel. The small class of four people hated this, but on that Friday, they all woke up early, hating how it was still dark outside, and headed to Hogsmeade where they took the train to London.
They walked in, finding a table towards the back, and ordered their drinks. Harry ordered a pint of ale, while Draco ordered a Strawberry Margarita. Harry chuckled when the drinks were ordered and they were waiting for them to get them.
“Regret? Grief? Guilt?” Harry looked away from Malfoy. “Yes. I feel that all because things weren’t supposed to be this way. Innocent lives were not supposed to be taken... Student, Malfoy. Students that had a life ahead of them. Parents that are leaving their children without them because they were killed. No. It’s more than that. They were slaughtered. And it’s all because I was here... because I came to Hogwarts.”
Draco didn’t look Harry in the eyes, but nodded. “I just don’t understand it, I guess. In a way I do, a little. Wars are said to have lasting side effects, usually meaning that most involved in the war, suffer from depression and - well, suicidal thoughts. Feeling like you didn’t do enough to save the people you fought with. Not doing enough to end things. Or sometimes it’s just because you didn’t make the right choices, like me. But Potter, That’s not the reason I don’t understand.”
This was exactly how he had wanted this to go. In his mind, he knew that Ron wouldn’t be as emotional as Hermione. He knew that Ron would be the last person he said goodbye too. And he had planned this out knowing that he would never actually walk into that room and go to sleep. He would never actually sleep again. Well, unless it was the endless sleep that was death.
“Harry... this is Hogwarts... not as it was the last time you were seen. The Battle of Hogwarts was 20 years ago... you and Draco have been missing for 20 years now...”
“Merlin, Potter... need you so bad...” he said in between kissing as he rutted back against the boy, again they both groaned from the friction it caused. Harry smiled against Dracos lips. “Then take me Draco... fucking take me...”
“I found them mom... it’s Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy isn’t it? They look like the photos. Could it really be them?” Hermione walked to the boys and she stopped in front of Harry. Her hand moved to the boys dirty face, pushing back the hair that covered the scar.
Maybe to some it's a magical experience and the feeling of hearing somebody else's melody becoming one with the other is positively life changing. They must have gotten this information from someone who lived a normal life. They must of got this from someone who didn't have to worry about anything other than what color they were going to paint their new home.
They got that much correct. It sounded beautiful as a child. Intricate fantasy's fueled by innocent imaginations was a normal occurrence. Boys and girls dreaming about a day when their one and only will come and make their life complete. The imaginations grow past childhood as perception of reality was discovered and still, their expectations for what it will be like never fade, never tarnishing.
It was Draco. And Draco looked awful. His hair and body were so cover in dirty and muck that he could barely recognize the boy.
It wasn’t until after he came back from the dead for a second time, that he believed the world to actually be a cruel, unjust place for not letting it end. It wasn’t until a week or so after the end of the war, that he sat up one night, telling himself that the end was near for him. He thought a lot about death at that point. To the point that he knew how he wanted to die.
The dorm was mostly quiet when they entered it. Blaise and Draco didn’t say a word and Harry followed in their silent converse. Ron and Neville were both talking to each other happily, as if they were the only ones in the room. That feeling of the world moving around him as if he were in a movie appeared again, but he ignored it for the most part. This was what he wanted to experience, one last time before he left this world.
They made it to their abandoned classroom, either one not saying a word as they enter. Draco looked at Harry up and down, and Harry did the same. Then their eyes met.
“Merlin, how many times I stared at you across the hall, so fixated on you and your blonde hair that falls so perfectly in place and your grey eyes that hold so much more emotion than your willing to express. Your stupid smirk and your stupid arrogant attitude... all of it had been pulling me in for so long. And now with this realization, you were the only person I could think of... and your still the only person I can think of.
“I want - I want the pain to go away. I want to learn to live my life. I want to learn things about myself that I didn’t know. Discover myself. I want to fall in love and laugh and go on spontaneous adventures that don’t end up in near death experiences. I want to learn to live.” He looked away for a moment before turning and to Draco. “Could you help me find those things? Could you teach me how to live my life to the fullest. To actually wake up wanting to be alive? Is that even possible?”
“I wouldn’t expect you to understand.” He snapped and Harry stopped again. He stared at Draco with a sad smile.
Before he knew it, dinner was over and they were all walking back to the eighth year dorms. Everyone in the eighth year had been put into one dorm, all adults, all exceptions that were able to come back. Boys were in one room, girls in the other. Harry’s bed was placed in the middle of Ron’s and Nevilles bed. Draco and Blaise Zabini were on the others sides of Ron and Neville.
“I tried to start multiple conversations with you to talk about all this. I mean, we share a room together, we have every class together, and we’re partners in almost every single one of them. But when I try to talk to you, you are quiet and moody that I’m even talking to you.”
“Your too dressed... I think we should fix that...” he said in a deep, husky voice. Harry bite his lip, sending waves of want to Dracos still restricted cock. “I think so too...” Harry muttered, staring into Dracos eyes. Draco grinned as he pulled Harry back in to kiss his lips, now his hands moving quickly to remove all clothes from this boy and Harry did the same thing to Draco.
“Malfoy, I don’t expect you to understand this, but muggles are actually a lot like wizards. Someone are extremely awful. For example, in the muggle world my relatives were awful. In the wizarding world, your awful. But there are nice ones. Like some of my teachers back there and there are more than enough nice wizards here. The only difference is that we can do magic and they cannot. It doesn’t make us better, and it definitely doesn’t make them useless.”
“Wait... why are you telling me this, Potter?” Harry didn’t answer right away as he was fin bushing off his second drink very quickly. Draco took note in this and followed along, feeling himself get more and more drunk with every passing moment.
That night they lost their virginity to each other, finally after years of talking about it. For just a moment, they both forgot that Draco was going to be leaving the next day. For just a moment, they loved each other.
“Harry, are you okay? I heard what happened yesterday. He didn’t hurt you, did he?” Draco bombarded Harry with questions, none that were answered, since Draco wouldn’t let him speak.
“I might not remember much after I come out, Harry. The dementors, they are said to make one go crazy. I just hope I’ll be sane enough to read about what we once had.”
He looked over to the Weasleys. The family that had become more family to him than his own. They all stood over the body of the one and only Fred, one of the twins that were known for their pranks and laughs. What on earth did such a boy ever deserve to deserve such a fate? Why couldn’t he muster up the courage to walk over there to them.
Harry spent more time focusing on Draco’s nearly naked body and the look of his hair when it was wet. He could barely keep his eyes off him. Draco even teased him about it.
“Harry, why didn’t you ever say that you were lonely and depressed? And why didn’t you ever tell me how much I meant to you? Not just anyone’s biggest fear is seeing me in Azkaban. Or apparently seeing me die.” He patiently waited for Harry to answer him.
“Why do you say that? What makes him so bad?” He asked, not stopping as he talked. He didn’t want Draco to actually see that he was curious.
They got all the way to a very familiar classroom. It was the defense against the dark arts classroom. And the door was open to a class that was being taught. Full of children they had never met.
“Harry, look at me please. Please, look at me.” Harry still didn’t budge. He spoke though. His words filled the air as he did.
Dementors took custody of Draco, leading him to a Portkey, where Draco was told to grab it, and just like that, the love of his life was gone.
Draco pulled from Harry, completely breathless. “I want to continue this... but maybe we should continue it in place a little less crowded? And maybe you will let me show you what it’s like to be with a man?” He watched the look on Harry’s face turn lustful, his eyes black with want.
“Harry! Thank Merlin I finally found you!” He didn’t look up to see who was there as the voice that had been calling his name was now inside the room with him. “Harry, what are you staring- oh...” the voice sounded displeased with what Harry was looking at.
The look of hate that painted the blondes face was more terrifying than Voldemort trying to kill him once again. Yet, Draco raised his wand, and a green light surrounded him while the words echoed in Harry's mind until they vanished entirely.
Harry stared at the boy. What did he really want? Could he open up to the blonde? Why did he feel like could?
There on the ground, laying in the water that filled the room from broken pipes, was Draco. The was crying out in pain as red stained the white shirt he was wearing and the blood stained the water. He was staring straight at Harry.
It’s said that one of the worst moments in your life would feel like someone was ripping out a part of your soul, leaving you forever change by that event.
Harry didn’t actually believed the words he was hearing come from Draco. Draco actually didn’t hate him all these years? His mind was still processing this when Draco continued.
“What happened?” He asked the blonde, holding an arm to his head as if that would help. The blonde turned and looked at Harry.
The walk off the train and towards the carriages the Thestrals pulled was a short one. Hermione and Ron had met up with Luna and Neville, all of them talking. All of them acting as if the war hadn’t happened and no one had actually died. All acting as if everything was perfectly fine. All while Harry sat quietly, keeping to himself.
The entire walk to the dinning room of the Manor was the longest one he had ever experienced. He walked with his face forward, avoiding eye contact because something told him that if he didn't, his facade would crack. Even his little song couldn't calm the fear and anxiety that was taking control of every inch of his body. Inside he repeated the words 'please not potter' over and over again.
Harry looked at him confused, but Draco answered his question. “I have always been envious of you, you know. Though I wouldn’t show that to a living souls and if you ever tell anyone I will deny it to the day I die. But you had everything I ever wanted. People were proud of you for things you did, and all you had to do was be yourself. You didn’t have to try to show up, you didn’t need to get the best grades, you didn’t even need to save people. You were always looked up to by so many people and everyone wanted to be around Harry Potter.
Draco was surprised by this. Harry was right, but he didn’t expect Harry to be the one to point this out and make this happen between them. Harry actually did want to be his friend.
They both walked out the great hall, neither one showing any sign that they were going to the same place.
The words came out of his mouth like silk. For Harry, at this moment, they were just words. For Draco, the person whose soul wasn’t being slowly ripped from his body, it meant the world to him. His heart hammered in his chest and he tended up, not believing he had just actually heard that.
The magical moment that he had dreamed of all his life was ruined by the simple fact that his soulmate wasn't only the Boy-who-lived, the boy who Draco had tormented for 6 years making them rivals, he was also the boy who was in the opposite end of the war. Draco would have added his near death to the list, but after time had passed, he had forgiven Harry and began cheering him on so that all this would end. He couldn't run into the boys arms and talk about color schemes like a normal person.
Harry shook his head and planted a kiss on his boyfriends cheek. “They won’t hate you. Not when I tell them stories of his amazing, brave father. I won’t allow him to hate you. Got it?” Draco hesitated but kissed Harry back.
If it mattered, the wizarding world would have seen that Draco Malfoy had not been true to the death eaters. Draco Malfoy, was true to anything that involved Harry. As it had been for years now.
It was a good time because there on his skin lay an imperfection that in a little less than a month would make him a murderer. He had over the year, pushed his friends away, grew distant with the world and given up hope that he would survive this. He already had one near death experience in the abandoned girls bathroom when the famous Boy-who-lived slashed him open with an unknown spell.
Neither said a word about how they really wish they could go with each other. Neither enjoyed their dates. Harry sat by Ron and his date, until the two dates, who were twin sisters stood up, very annoyed, and left.
“Your correct, Potter.” He took a long drink, downing it in one go, deciding that if they were getting drunk, might as well go all out.
The next to go was Ron. He just stood up and looked at Harry. He scratched his head awkwardly. “I’m”going to bed. Do you... are you going to bed now?”
That lead them back to the Dueling Club, and how Draco Malfoy, in attempts to make it better for Harry, shot a snake out of his wand. The snake was going to attack Justin Flinch-Fletchley, a hufflepuff.
The entire ride, Harry had decided that snogging in the back of the car as the person in front drove was a great idea, and who was Draco to argue? He couldn’t argue. Not when Harrys body was pressed to his, his tongue was in his mouth, he was making sighs that drove Draco made with want. By the end of the car ride, Draco had a painfully restricted erection that he was ready to get rid of.
Harry realized that their relationship meant a lot more than Ron’s and Hermione’s the following summer. Draco had been sending letters to Harry for weeks and finally, he couldn’t take the worry anymore. Draco had heard all about how those rotten muggles had treated Harry, and now he was worried.
"Potter... I don't know what to tell you... if I don't do this, they will kill me. I don't have another option." Harry stared and Draco not saying anything. An annoyed sound come from the Weasley who was standing to the side of Draco.
Even before the Yule ball, they had both made awkward conversations about who they were taking, but they both avoided the topic for the most part.
“I’m scared. I don’t want to take the dark mark. But I have no choice, Harry.” Harry hugged the boy tightly to his chest, rubbing circles into it.
That was the night that Draco Malfoy realized that a soulmate was a blessing to those who deserved them. And he, Draco Malfoy did not deserve one.
“I am hated Harry. I lost everything. Everything I have ever known, was a lie. All my life, I lived in the shadow of a man who was an awful person, who hurt people, hurt children for Merlin sakes, and all I wanted to do was make him proud. Now, that man is in Azkaban, that man ruined the family name he taught me meant so much, he destroyed my life and my mother’s life, and the worst part of it all, is that all those stupid beliefs that he taught me growing up, they were all fake. So I lived my entire life being the bully, even became a fucking death eater, when I was the one in the wrong the entire time.”
Draco wasn’t sure who had dominance over who as they both seemed to fight over it. Harry had pushed his tongue into Dracos mouth, immediately meeting Dracos in this very suddenly hungry fight for the dominance. Which didn’t surprise Draco one bit. They were both strong, stubborn boys who wanted to be in charge. And as much as Draco wanted to give into Harry’s dominance, he wanted Harry to really experience this. This was his first gay moment and Draco knew what to do.
He made it to his final destination, the astronomy tower. Albus Dumbledore had died in here. It was only fitting that the man who had used Harry, built him up to be nothing but a human weapon, would die in the same place Harry Potter did. Harry walked over to the railing, looking down at the ground below. He hoped that his fall wouldn’t be that bad. Maybe he would look like Albus had on that day. Maybe he would be found and everyone would raise their wands to the fallen hero, giving their respect for the boy who gave it his all.
“Also, after my parents died, I went to live with my mothers sister. I didn’t even know magic existed until my 11th birthday, when Hagrid had to come and get me from my aunt and uncle. I always thought I was a freak for being able to make strange things happen around me. Turns out that I was just a wizard, and thats why they treated me like they did. Everything I did was never right, and they made it known.”
“You actually want to be my friend? And wait you think you might be... gay? I don’t understand why your telling me this. I mean, you can figure it out yourself. All you have to do it picture a male naked body. Does it seem appealing to you? Can you fantasize with it?”
“I think that I can arrange for that. But we need to make a deal.” Harry nodded his head. “Anything. Whatever you would like.” Harry answered immediately.
“Remember, relax okay? It’s going to be painful right away, but remember to relax and it will go away.” He waited for Harry’s nods of acknowledgment before he allowed himself to push pass the entrance into Harry’s tight arse.
Harry woke up to a now lit room. For a moment he believed that maybe he had been brought to the hospital wing, but there was something off. The ceiling above him didn’t look like that of hospital wing. And he was on the ground. The hard ground. But he couldn’t still couldn’t be in the potions room. That room never got light.
"Please, dont do this," he begged as he was pulled from view. "Please..." he said, but they were gone.
When he finally did speak, he smiled at Draco with a smile Draco had only had the chance to admire from across the great hall from time to time.
“Harry, I love you so much. I have for years now. I wish I would have known. Nothing in the universe will ever make you run grind me, got it?” Harry smiled at the reassuring Draco.
Harry never would have believed that the moment he thought would be his end would actually be the moment he was comforted by the most unlikely boy. Draco looked at the crying boy, Harry looked back, and nothing was spoken aloud, but each knew that they needed someone in this moment. Someone who knew that the war had broken them, and to really comfort them. Which is what lead to the two once school rivals in each other’s arms, sobbing into each other’s shoulders as if this was a normal thing and they were closer than they actually were.
“I missed you too. How have you been? How is in the Inquisitorial squad going?” He asked him softly as they cuddle.
During the day time, he was required to sit in on death eater meetings in the Manors grand dinning room with his parents and the others most loyal to the dark lord. There almost always some muggleborn wizard floating in the center of the table after the Cruciatus curse had rendered them nothing but a body with a useless brain. They would talk about their plans and sometimes, the others would brag about their recent kills.
“I am sorry for how I treated you before. I didn’t know. Also, I would like to ask something. I know I’ve been rejected once before, and if you refuse a second time, I will understand. But,” Draco paused. “Harry,” the name sounded smooth coming from the boys lips. “I think that there’s more to you than I let myself believe. If you would give me the chance, I would like to get to know that. As friends.”
"Your welcome Harry." He turned his head slightly, letting their eyes meet and found that he was right about Harry's eyes. Draco realized didn't want to hide the smile from Harry.
“Thank you, Draco. It means a lot you say that.” They sat in the room and talked for about another hour, which was as long as they were usually allowed to without someone getting suspicious.
Exactly one month after Draco had been sent to Azkaban, Harry found out he was pregnant and with twins.
Draco made his way back up to Harry’s mouth, kissing him with hunger as he removed his weight from the boy and they moved towards the bed, their mouths never leaving each other’s as they did so. Once Harry’s legs had hit the end of the bed, Draco pulled away from Harry’s mouth to look at the boy.
That’s why he said nothing all the way to Hogwarts. It’s why his friends seemed to have stopped trying weeks ago to get Harry back into his normal state of mind. Though, he didn’t know at this point what a normal state of mind was. All of his years at Hogwarts had been attempts, one after another, to survive to the next school year. And even before that, he was a freak who lived under a stair case. There was no, normal state of mind. In fact, there was no normal anything.
They walked for another 5 minutes before they encountered their first person. It was a student obviously. She was dressed in a set of red Gryffindor robes. She had red hair and freckles that reminded Harry of the Weasleys, but she wasn’t a Weasley he knew. The girl stopped when she saw the both of them and stared with wide eyes.
But the end of the day and the end of dinner, Draco was more than ready to go out and see what it was like to drink at a muggle bar. He wanted to talk to Harry, ask him more questions about muggle technology and if he was lucky, he could talk to Harry as if they weren’t enemies before. As if they didn’t just come out of a war in opposing sides.
He didn’t take the final step to his death. He didn’t feel the freedom he longed for. He didn’t get the opportunity to leave this world. The moment ended as soon as it had come, when something stopped him.
“Potter, why did you live with muggles? Aren’t they awful?” Harry spun around so fast and walked closer to Draco with a fiery of emotions.
Maybe, that was what he needed. Maybe, it wasn’t why he needed. Maybe, it was really that he needed to get out of that dark, dreary home that once joked that once housed his godfather, Sirius Black, the man who had been one of the closest people to a father figure he would ever come to have. Maybe, just maybe, he didn’t need time, because there was nothing that could truly fix what had happened.
Ronald Weasley had also declined. He had been one of the few wizards who had been offered into the Auror training program. And he took it while Harry told the boy that he was done fighting the bad guys.
To his relief, it was Snape that killed Dumbledore. Draco and Snape ran off, but not before Harry noticed a gold band in his wrist. The band that was going to keep him and Harry in contact after this.
Without another thought, Harry put a finger on Draco’s mouth as he was opening it to speak. “Say no more, Draco. I feel the same.”
Even Harry spent a good 15 minutes lecturing Draco in how even in public, that word was not acceptable. Draco once again apologized.
“Well, I’ve been okay. It’s hard to be good when everyone is talking shit about your boyfriend. Or that your trying to find out the ‘sneaky thing’ he’s doing. Honestly, I wish I could be on your side. I hate being away from you or fighting against you.”
They began dancing like they normally would, except this time, they were both tense. Harry could feel Draco’s breath hitting his neck, causing Harry’s body to tense up even more.
Scorpius and Albus has lived their first five years of their life being told that their father was an amazing man. So when they finally got to meet him, they were so excited.
All it took was one moment, one group of words, that would bring the world crashing down around you, and no matter how much you wanted to place the pieces back together, you couldn’t.It was out of your control, lost forever in a black abyss of what once was, and what will never be.
The chair he was sitting on started being pulled backwards as he started up at Hermione with watery eyes.
"As the new Minister of Magic, I have decided that for all those you have gotten killed at all the lives you have effected, you are going to be spending the rest of your day in Azkaban. Where you belong."
The boy was trembling as he held his wand up. Harry knew he didn’t want to kill him. He wished that something would come up, and Draco wouldn’t have to do it.
Draco didn’t speak as their drinks got to them. He knew Harry was right. He had come out here with Harry in hopes to actually make something from this.
He couldn’t find the words to comfort the man. In all reality, there was nothing that could change this, and he knew that. He didn’t want to believe that this week would be the end, but he couldn’t see any other way out of this.
He whispered the lubricant spell once more, this time rubbing his hands on his neglected erect cock. He rubbed the liquid all over it before turning to Harry. “How do you want to do this? What position?” Harry looked from Dracos cock to his eyes. “I want to look at you as you fuck me, Draco.” He stated softly, and Draco smiled at this. He positioned himself in between Harry’s legs, lining himself up to Harry’s hole.
The only thing he wanted to do before he died, was go back to Hogwarts, and see it’s beauty one last time. He wanted to walk the halls and really appreciate them. He wanted to walk onto the quidditch pitch, the one place he had always felt free, and experience that once last time. He wanted to eat his last meal in the great hall, enjoying the terracle tart that was served. And then, when it was all over, he was going to that his finally breaths in that school, finally, ending it. Finally being free of all this pain and misery and emptiness.
From the back side, her brown hair was one the was so familiar he could tell it from a mile away. Only, the body didn’t seem to match the hair.
Harry was just about to say something when yet another voice entered the room. But this time, it wasn’t from his old school rival. This time it was from a figure with features he wouldn’t make out.
Harry looked at Draco and the words just kind of clicked. His body lost all form of happiness or hope and say there almost lifeless. The look in his eyes were void of all emotion as he sat there, ready to spend the rest of his day alone in a room with the boy he wanted but could never get too.
Harry was used to the muggle world, being that he was from the muggle world. He got along with the teacher perfectly as they both talked happily about the things that were planned for the trip. Draco, along with Pansy and Blaise sat there, nearly drowning in the confusion that they felt.
He does this until he feels Harry on the edge of his orgasm and stops, removing his mouth. He ignores Harry’s groan of annoyance and whispers a wandless lubricant Spell on to his fingers, before moving them to Harry’s opening, circling the rim, earning a whimper. Draco looked up at Harry, who looked anxious and little tense about Dracos fingers being inside of him.
“I tried to think about all the times in my life that I might have stared just a little bit to long at a man because I just couldn’t look away, and the first and only thought that came to my mind... was you.” Dracos eyes widened and his heart began racing. What was Harry saying?
Everyone eventually did find out. It shocked everyone who hadn’t already known. Years passed and they got married and eventually had children together. And no one would have ever guessed that the rivals, would have ever become more than that.
The last book wasn’t published until way after the twins were born. They were born shortly after the second book had been released to the world.
The areas that were not covered in the ruins, were bodies. So many bodies lined the floors. Bodies of people he knew. Bodies of students that had wanting nothing more to go to Hogwarts to learn magic. Innocent people who had lives ahead of them. All ended in a war Harry had never wanted to be apart of.
Harry didn’t know what to do. He had only ever kissed two people before, both them girls, one while she was crying, the other had felt wrong since she was like a sister to him. And Dracos lips were so much different than theirs. They weren’t soft and round but they were hard and a firm. And Dracos lips caused his heart to race faster than it ever had even with the two girls.
“Harry” she called, hands beginning to wander along his muscled torso, trying to tell him something as she began to feel slick pool on her panties.
Harry smiled before guiding him to lie down side ways. Draco whined when Harry pulled away, “Hush, love. I’m here. Just taking my boxers off”
His eyes glinting with mischief as he put his hands on the pocket of his sweatpants. The laidback aura on his demeanor easily piquing Draco's curiosity.
She had clean a dozen of times but she had also read more than a dozen of times. That’s an activity she loves at an absolute level. Especially when she saw the library, she was in awe.
She moaned, moving to straddle the alpha, whimpering as his cock grazed her soaking panties. Merlin, she wanted him now. Wanted him out in the open, outside of the safe house they are in while the whole night watches them.
She cupped his cheeks and kissed him on his lips. Moving her head to the side, Harry immediately responded back, grasping both of her ass cheeks and squishing them.
He hugged him back and inhaled Harry’s natural scent. It was manly and comforting. It never fails to remind him that Harry is here now, in his arms.
Draco bit his lips, liking the voice too much. He clenched his fist around the blanket and stared at it as if it was the most beautiful thing in the world. When in reality, it was the man beside— strange thoughts again.
She gasped when Harry roughly pulled her into his lap and hugged her, feeling her small form to his and he groaned.
Confused and hungry at the same time, she turned her head to look and her heart melt at the sight of Harry leaning his cheek on her pelvis and occasionally kisses her tummy, his hands rubbing the side of her legs.
The weekdays passed like a wind just gushing over the window. Dracy would not admit it out loud but she had fun whenever she’s alone in Harry’s house. She can do anything she wants as long as she does what Harry wants her to accomplish.
After they have ordered their foods and was just busy waiting for it to be served, Draco looked up to see Harry smiling at him like a lunatic.
The pillow he was hugging seemed to be smoother than he can remember but he wasn’t complaining. It is nice and he wanted to go back to deep slumber once more. He pulled the pillow tighter and then, he heard a whine.
He wanted to sweat with him, paint all those scars with his creamy white cum, have his mouth full of Remus, until he was coming and then fuck him into the wall, into the bathroom. Paint every James’ and Lily’s house with every sexy memory, bless this innocent home with every bit of delicious noises, corrupt the purity of this house in much more beautiful way than Harry who surprisingly has a daddy kink, very right for his age and his nephew's.
Being inside the young boy beneath him is divine. Despite the stretching, Draco is tight and warm and all too sexy. He felt like his sanity is fully slipping away as he stared at him, eyes barely open, lips parted with every love bites Harry made in view. He looked like the most expensive painting ever to be created.
“I miss you” he whispered even when they have been with each other for the whole day, “I miss you, daddy”
He helped her ride out of her orgasm for a few seconds before pulling out. His chin now rests on her shoulder as their eyes meet on the mirror, “Are you good?”
There are a lot of things Draco imagined on his mind as he thinks about the man that's sleeping across his room and the unimaginable things that Harry can do to him once he cracks. And he might able to continue that later when Harry leaves to visit the Ministry.
He wasn’t even allowed to wear his own clothes neither was he allowed to have his own possession. It was in his captor’s statement that what is his is what he owns as well. Sickly on its own style.
He gritted his teeth, hands gripping the armchairs. What the hell did he just hear?! He cannot be! Of course he cannot be!
He bit his lips, he felt himself shuddered again as Harry looked at him from head to toe before walking away. He heard him walk upstairs and he released the breath he wasn’t even aware he was holding.
Love. That daring endearment. Jake never called him love. He called him baby, sometimes sorrow and often, sadness.
When he woke up this morning, he was on his worst and he was sobbing like a little kid on one of his innocent pillows. He just need Harry’s presence behind him, beside him and those big hands around him. He needs to be reassured or otherwise, he will blame himself for this.
“I know this isn’t the most romantic of all, angel” he smiled apologetically, “But I saw this from the jewelry shop and I immediately thought of you and I”
They were happily settled in the living room until it was time for them to go. Upon Dracy saying good bye to them Ron pulled him out of her earshot and spoke, “We’ve contained every press trying to smear her name, Harry. Kingsley was able to ban your names in the Daily Prophet"
When Harry pulled his head back, they stared at one another. Dracy feeling her heart started to feel like it was dancing rather than beating. Harry’s eyes were glazed with want and it is making her feel things, especially neediness.
She knew Harry spent too much galleons on her in one trip in Diagon Alley. What they bought were five pairs of lacy bra and panties on different colors, another five in lingerie dress, and one night robe in emerald color. When she checked the price from the nearby saleslady who was fixing a rack, she had told her that one pair costs two hundred and fifty galleons.
“What happened, Harry?” Seamus asked as they settled in the common room after dinner. He was cuddling with Dean on the couch and it took all ounce of strength for Harry not to replace Seamus’ and Dean’s face with their own.
Harry considers him beautiful because he’s Draco. He didn’t play by the old rules known in the Wizarding world. He doesn’t wear jeans because his sex dictated him to. He wears skirts, dresses, thongs, and heels because it’s what he wants. He doesn’t wear what he doesn’t want because he doesn’t please the Wizarding world but to show himself as he actually is.
The enthusiastic energy Harry displayed on his movements, tongue teasing around her labia. He alternated between sucking and nipping so playfully, palms beginning to move from its place on her hips to touch her cunt and part its lips.
He inserted another finger, twisting it in the right way she likes and hitting that spot that has her legs quivering, threatening to close. Harry sucked on her clit, pulling and playing with it with his tongue and lavishing it with utmost attention.
Maybe not all the way tonight but if she chooses to give him the permission, why not give her something to remember by? He smirked, tilting his head as he eyed her from the other side of the venue.
However, Harry shouldn't also underestimate Draco's young skills and overestimate himself. It'll do no good.
When they arrived at the Nott Residence, both of them can already hear the noises roaring from inside and Draco smiled.
They stayed silent for the next few minutes, basking in the afterglow and the smell of aftersex. Their breaths falling in sync as they sat, sweat to sweat and always skin to skin. Remus began to hum a song, comforting Sirius as he curled around his torso because fuck, being in love never fails for them.
Harry faked a gasp, “Okay. That twice stupid is hurtful. But I get to go in first. Hold on to my shirt, make sure no one snatches you away from me”
People watching were in awe, complimenting the way he moves like waves to the sea, the way his pale skin shimmers under the light, the way he feels as if there’s a halo above his head.
“Or touch you like this?” Harry asked and gripped his jaw in quick motion where Draco gasped once again, startled by how fast Harry is with his hand. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
Draco felt his whole body throb hearing the dark tone on Harry’s voice. He really do have rough hands that’s igniting flames inside him. Waking his cock from slumber as he felt it tried to push against the silky panties he wore.
He dropped a kiss on his head before brushing his sweaty hair away from his face, “Are you alright, little one? What do you need?”
“You lot need to study. The exams are coming in soon!” he grumbled in annoyance, looking around the table and actually looking petrified that he’s the only one taking things seriously.
They were still seated at the Gryffindor Table as McGonagall announced the eight year table will be added tomorrow morning. He can still feel eyes on him and the words being said about him. He’s used to it by now but he’s not some heartthrob out there.
“You see, think about this, Dracy have been seen as the fallen angel since the issue with her father escalated full force and since then, I know she had not felt warmth or appreciation because people have been so quick to judge her and make fun of her. So when you came, assuming you provided her some attention that her omega liked, it was what pushed her to ask such question”
“Why don’t you show Draco around, Harry?” Mrs. Potter insinuated and Draco was both mortified and interested upon seeing the smirk that blossomed on the man’s face.
Draco eventually followed and straightened his head, opening his mouth as Harry began to feed him, occasionally putting food on his mouth as well, all the while his other hand never ceased on rubbing along Draco’s spine.
Draco look up surprise, “Harry! I didn’t hear you arrive!” he said joyfully and ran up to him. He immediately jumped into his arms.
Harry raised one well sculpted eyebrow, nodding and regarding him for a bit moment. Draco’s chest throbbed when he thought he saw something other than kindness in his eyes before it delved into a nice bobbed of the head.
It didn’t take long for them to get ready. But it was also such a short time for her to collect her nerves. Harry’s assurance had eased her worries but as minutes pass by and the thought of going to St. Mungos where people can know and gossip. After all, the eyes of the public travels fast, mouth on mouth and thousands of ears that can listen. She just knows her pregnancy is at risk.
That’s what she can remember. How is she in her room? Did Wily levitate her to her room or maybe it was Harry who carried her? Nevertheless, she’s grateful.
Harry chuckled, unconsciously pulling Draco closer to his side, “Well, we’re new to the neighborhood”
Turning their heads back, they saw the Headmistress at the bottom of the stairs with pursed lips but gentle gaze.
But what confuses her was that the picture had marks as if they were once rip apart and was only fixed by a charm. And when her fingers gently touched the area where the mark was most prominent, she felt that magic that’s holding the picture together.
“Of what care do you need?” Harry’s other hand begin to cup her cheeks, “My omega will be treated a treasure. Tell me what you need and want to”
Draco nodded, “Yes. Pansy Parkinson recommended your service” he answered, “What do we do?” he bit his lips, fingers grasping the side of his trousers.
“Here’s your sobering potion” he said stiffly. Keeping his expression and tone cool and collected as not to give away the inner wars he’s currently having.
They talked for more than an hour before Draco decided to end it and call it a night. He laid down at the couch and was still determined to wait for Harry but he did not realize he fell asleep.
But who the fuck is he to act as if he's the strongest man on whole of the Wizarding World? The force of the boy is nothing but indestructible. He cannot for the love of morality, counter that.
Tightening his grip on her hips, he pulled her up and encircled one hand around her waist while the other fondled with her breast, toying with the hardened nipple at hand.
Draco sat down and began to take a sip of the coffee that was already on the table. Where did Harry go? Dobby said he was in a hurry? Maybe he got an emergency?
“’ma, yummy” she whined petulantly as she leaned on her big brother James who wrapped a hand around her shoulder.
He met customers after customers, booking him for private shows. One song, two songs, three or as much as they could afford them. He would move, seduce them, take a reaction out of them, tease them but it was never him who seemed to be on the receiving end.
Sirius shrugged, “It co-exists with your world. But hidden away from muggles. We do not want to risk our world with your hot poky stuff, right?”
Dracy’s lips parted, perplexity written all over her face, “But you’re an Alpha” her mouth spoke on its own.
“I’m going to taste you, stretch you, fuck you, and fill you with my cum” he kissed his lips, soft for a second then shifted roughly the next minute, teeth nibbling on his bottom lip.
At mornings, he would bring their breakfast in bed, filled with a stem of tulips and a small bar of chocolate she’s gotten to love since the night she saw it back at the cottage’s food cabinet. It’s always been a part of her cravings and she would not feel good if she doesn’t have even just a single bite.
And as those lips that were formerly wrapped around a cigarette kissing the corner of his lips to nipping at his chin to his jawline, mouth finding their way to his ears and tug on his earlobes gently, “Is this what you want?”
"Hi" he called and he reveled when he noticed the way Harry raked his eyes to his whole body and visibly gulped. He smiled. He's sexy and he knows it. Something that would taste foreign in Harry's tongue but would surely be the best.
He didn’t expect for Harry to clasped his hands to his chin to raise his head and they glanced at one another. Draco was sure he looked to vulnerable right now but he can tell that Harry is as well. Those eyes that reflected not regret but fear?
She watched him as he raised a hand waved it over the tub where it began to fill with water and a nice soap that automatically bubbles.
"Mr. Potter will guard you and the Manor, Draco. Do behave and not cause the Head Auror too much headaches" Lucius butted in and stood beside his wife, "Does this mean you are accepting the job?"
He clenched his jaw. His dick is celebrating at what he is currently witnessing because it's heavenly.
"Mmm" he moaned, ignoring how fast Harry is driving and how good it is to be riding with him because right at the moment, he's wondering how exquisite would be to ride him instead.
“So, our Sirius here said about your problems with the minister” said James Potter, immediately talking about their purpose in coming.
He sat alone inside the train, making sure to hide in huge hoodie to avoid students asking for his autograph and answering questions he certainly doesn’t want to be answered.
When he had let it all out, he whined at Harry’s weight and called out to him, “D-daddy” he needed aftercare. Needed Harry’s hug. Needed his arms around him. Needed Harry to care for him and hum until he falls asleep.
He stomped his foot and turned around the corner, eyebrows raising when he saw a familiar person sitting down on the floor, back resting comfortable at the bookshelf with a few messy papers and quills scattered before him.
Harry yanked his jeans open and slid his hand inside, smirking when he felt the material of his panties, “I bet you look so good, baby. Wish I could see you just in it”
With their close proximity, light around them, Draco nearly gasped when he took in his looks. He was unimaginably indescribable, something that should only exist in fantasies, video games, dreams and nightmares.
Harry studied her for a moment before nodding, “Please take that to the counter and we’ll just be in the lingerie section” he stated to the staff who nodded knowingly and walked off.
“Such a good girl” he praised. It did not miss his notice when Dracy shivered at his compliment. He smirked.
He walked inside and dropped his luggages at the foot of the bed, deciding to fix them up later. He turned to Draco and walked back outside.
Draco moaned and closed his eyes. Lying is such a good thing to get what he wants. Merlin, how he wanted those hands all over his young body.
She can feel some of the eyes observing them, wondering what had her stone glued in the middle of the dance floor, suddenly so subdued and unmoving. They wondered how but she didn’t care. Not when when she felt Harry stopped behind her, his front pressed to her back. His broad torso hard against her soft skin.
That’s new. It’s new. He sucked in a breath and he smelled the smoke, the cigarette Harry just finished. It lingered on him like how desire lingered in his body.
Without no warning, when she felt that familiar tightening of her lower abdomen, she came gushing on his face, the scratch of his bead nicely touched the side of her pussy. Harry helped her ride out her orgasm before pulling back.
Draco nodded dazedly before tilting his head to the touch. His nose latching onto the familiar smell of cigarettes and the new one that distinctly said
“I’m sorry for shouting at you” she apologized for her own mistakes as well, “Sorry for demanding things without considering how you feel”
“Come on! Hurry” Sirius said and sighed. His godson is having problems and issues and he cannot offer any good advice and believe it or not, it’s making him feel bad.
Harry sighed and smiled at his little boy. Encircling an arms around the slim waist as he cupped his cheek with the other and played with his bottom lip, "What is it, angel?"
One thing Draco wants right now is for this moment to last longer, longer than he usually take a bath or shave or shop.
Draco huffed calmly, hands finding purchase. There was it again but unlike before, it didn’t feel restricting. It felt abundant and rich. Something a bit foggy and profuse amount of suspicious passion.
. That asshole who thought it was a good idea to handcuff one Draco Malfoy in a chair. In a horrible chair no less!
He smiled at the dazed look on her as he ate her out like a meal. Her sweet scent of arousal dripping out of her and invading all of his control but he cannot risk taking her now. Even when she claims it as okay, he wouldn’t want to.
It didn’t take long until Draco was panting and coming all over their stomach. He kissed him on the lips before sighing.
“Yes. That’s the problem. I know how our son can be. He’s reckless and comes home every night with a hickey on his neck! He has a fianceé, Potter”
He turned his back when saw the a light and he was glued to his spot when he noticed motorbikes coming on his way. He cannot really see who they are even when they weren’t wearing any helmets because of all the lights invading his line of sight.
He took a deep breath. Calm down. It wasn’t like he’s been forced or something. He stared at him, finding any sign Harry was joking but there was only intense seriousness followed by the gentle smile he wore.
Harry never shares. That’s one of the not so many things she knows about the man. Whatever available is out there, he gets it. How can Dracy be an exception?
Determination fueled the both of them as they stared to one another, gazes glued and unfaltering, unblinking and leveled with each other’s plans.
Harry sighed and nodded, "Nine it is. No dilly dallying past nine because the house will automatically seal itself so no people would be able to go in or out"
McGonagall hummed, her slender fingers tapping impatiently on her armchair. Her eyes scrutinized him for some reason, her gaze prickling deep in his face. For a bit moment, Harry was intimidated by the suddenness of her action.
An hour later, as it turns out, fun is eventually drinking alcohol, bunch of mimosas and some whiskey for Harry. But since he can very much hold his tolerance highly, it was no problem on his side. However, Draco is. . . Draco is. . .
She gently leaned on the back of the couch, palms caressing her protruding tummy and slightly wincing when their baby kicks right like a boxer.
“You smell good, tiger” he murmured between kisses and love bites, “You looked so good in that gown, so elegant with the way you move”
He buried his face in his back and inhaled his scent. He smells of dark chocolates and the strong distinct smell of forest, created by the wars he magnificently faced alone when there was a massacre among the Auror force months ago.
Harry bent down and leveled Draco’s face, his hand not leaving his jaw and looked at him straight in the eyes. After a second, he let go but immediately gripped him at the back of his head, the same way he gripped it on his dreams.
He sighed and closed his eyes, letting out the confession he did not allow himself to say when she’s awake. For now, that is.
“It’s all its point” Draco smartly pointed out and as much as Harry loves the brain, he needs the heart too.
He was sitting down by the window pane, holding his own firewhiskey in hand. He was enjoying the celebration but not much with how messy it can get. Cue in the game of spin the bottle, truth or dare and whatever games are out there on the table.
She cried as she buried her face in her hands. Harry loves her! Harry loves her! Yes! He loves her back! He loves her too!
He’s always been so impossibly lovable and the more he acts like it, the more Draco hungers for what isn’t there.
. Common phrase, never unheard of but it was the promise in his tone that put Draco off. Overwhelmed possibly but still not deterred.
She stood before him as their surroundings faded into a blurry jade. That’s one of Harry’s mastered ability. The way he earns her attention like no other and in turn, the way he returns the fervor equally.
He knew he’s such an arsehole for that but he really didn’t give it much thought when he flew away. He was so desperate to get out of there that he completely had forgotten Draco’s feelings on this.
“Do you think that we were in a coma or something and we have been asleep for a long time?” Malfoy asked and Harry shook his head.
Harry took no time to stand up. He watched from the corner of his eye as Draco stood up, and walked away from Pansy who was having an intense conversation with Blaise and his date.
“Malfoy,” he started with a laugh, “this is how muggles get around. And some of us have been riding in muggle vehicles since before I was walking. Cars, aren’t that bad once you get used to them.” Draco looks at the ‘car’ and groans.
He walked into the doors leading to the school, making his way through the destroyed corridors. The further away from the scene of the aftermath of the battle, the better. He found himself near the dungeons, subconsciously leading him to the old potions classroom that once occupied the grumpy old professor he once believed had it out for him.
Harry and Draco were partners in their muggle studies class, meaning that all the projects, essays and assignments were to be done together and turned into together. That apparently meant that class trips meant the same thing.
Harry had spoken for the blonde and his mother, able to get them out of Azkaban. But nothing he could have done could get that blonde to look lively once more. Harry hoped that after he was gone, that the blonde would have a life that was fulfilling and worth talking about. Maybe once day, after death, Draco would have died living a life of true happiness.
Upon entering the Grimmauld Place, they both stood in the completely dark room that was eerily quiet. It was as if, even the house itself knew that something tragic had taken place.
Draco listened to Harry and he felt weird listening to Harry pour out his heart to him when the boy didn’t even trust his friends to understand. It made him feel like for once, maybe the boys had something in common. Draco opened his mouth to say something, but Harry wasn’t done talking yet.
“Harry, it’s fake. This is all fake. And if we don’t get you out of here now, you will die.” Harry didn’t move. He still didn’t look away from the boy sitting in the corner. He didn’t think he could look away.
There was nothing that could fix the damage that inflicted on those of the war. He had attended every single funeral, each one just as awful and soul-crushing at the last. Reminders that the Weasleys had lost someone. That a baby, not even a year old had lost his parents. That students that had nothing to do with the war, had lost so much. And Harry, took it upon himself to make it his responsibility, this fault for causing as much death as he had. Nothing, not even his best friends, could get him out of this ever-spiraling darkness he had fallen so deeply into.
Only Dobby also almost got Harry expelled and Draco apologized immediately after they had a moment alone. He even apologized for the way he had acted in the Flourish and Blotts. Though it was quickly dismissed, since they both knew that whatever they said in public was not to be taken seriously.
“I can’t do it. I can’t let you go. This isn’t fair.” He sobbed into the mans chest, and Draco remained quiet as he did.
He nodded. “You’re right, Potter. We’ve been forced together in every way. But my question for you is,” Harry raised an eyebrow curiously, “why do you want to try to make the most of it? You hate my guts. I was death eater, Potter. You spoke for me at the trial, but I don’t understand why?”
“You know what you are Potter? Selfish.” He spat out in a tone one would think was disgust, but Harry knew better. Draco always sounded this way. “You think life is so bad that you could just end it all, leaving all the people who fought to keep you alive? What are you even thinking? That life for Harry Potter is so bad now that the war is over and he can finally live a normal life?” Harry watch as Draco moved over Harry, hovering over him.
She blinked for several times, fingers trembling as she felt the palpitations that assaulted her being.
Harry snorted. He felt like a chaperone as everyone refers to his bestfriends as lovebirds. He took a bite of his chicken and shrugged, “Didn’t come”
Before she could get away, she felt a hand around her wrist and she turned to look at him, “Don’t touch me”
It was thanks to Pansy’s connections he didn’t need to wait weeks to months to have an appointment. One call from her and he was presented with the contract and things he filled in to show what he likes and what he doesn’t.
And pretty sure, the Greengrass sisters were happy that his proposal was rejected. Those two have been trying to sneak their way in his bed and he’s just waiting for them to step a toe out of line so he’ll drop them thousand dollars and voila, they’re gone.
But as he have experienced how sweet Harry is, he found himself holding back, craving what he shouldn’t.
“Pansy, listen! Someone said love is in the air! You better go get your mask and wear it! Don’t let yourself be infected! They’re dangerous and contagious!”
When the familiar sound of swoosh roared and died down, Draco turned to look at him, his dress twirling with him and baring a little view of those sexy legs that would feel great wrapped around Harry's waist and
She knew he knows the effect of what he’s doing to her and the smile that blossomed in his face says it all.
Harry looked over the whole city. He stopped by the hill when he cannot think of somewhere else to go. He surely cannot go to Ron because he’ll definitely be seeing why Harry had to show up so suddenly on his doorstep followed by Hermione’s incessant questioning.
She shook her head fondly before taking her wand out and flicking her wrist, while waiting for everything to go back on their order, her eyes dropped to the silent kid sitting at the edge, busy reading some book,
She would complain in her mind but other times, she convinced herself that she already has it good as it gets. He pulled her out of the dump she’s stuck in. Why would she complain of the lavishness Harry is giving her?
All of him that was swimming in agony just moments ago is replaced with sudden sensations. He basked in the way Harry’s lips felt so good, the way he felt it fit his just right, the way he kissed him passionately, deepening in a second and he moaned.
Then his smirk turned into a grin as he began to walk closer, easily putting his hands on his pocket, “Who’s this dollface over here?”
Draco let his eyes wander around. There were several aisles with label on top. A lot of people walking around and enjoying what Hogsmeade newly offers. It was perfect, every little thing smartly planned and executed to perfection.
“Are you going home for the Holidays?” Harry asked as he helped himself in Draco’s bed, sliding under the covers with him.
Harry sighed. This is not going anywhere. He dropped his spoon and focused all of his attention to Draco, “Listen, sweet”
He looked up at Harry dazedly, eyes fogging with lust and pleasure as he felt the sting of the slap, adding to how turned on he was feeling. He loves the roughness, one that’s not present from his former victims.
Or is the whole of Roaring Lions disappointed at him? Will Pansy and Blaise still look at him as their friend?
Draco took a peek as he walked out of the room and realized he was in a huge house that is more quiet than silence itself.
McGonagall sighed, “Very well” she gesture her hands around them, pointing at the Hogwarts’ walls as she began to explain.
Draco slid an index finger over his daddy’s cheek, all the while beginning to roll his hips in slow movements, “I am going to fuck myself, daddy. And you’re going to watch”
“You look so beautiful with my baby in you” he intentionally kept his voice low, his breath fanning her ear and he smirked at the way he can see the rise of her chest and the slight shift of her mood.
His emerald eyes were dark, angry, and all things hot. There’s a slight edge into them, a pang of desperation to claim, own, and mark him but there was also a slice of jealousy and doubt. Draco’s heart clenched at the sight as he took a deep breath.
Draco was cut off when the cauldron blasted and hitting the both of them of its contents straight in their faces. It burned as the two of them doubled in pain and complains, crying out loud for some help.
He had already warned Draco to behave today and hopefully, his baby boy is in his right mind to follow. Their hands turned to him, noticing the way Moony’s serious gaze settled on Draco while Padfoot smirked at his appearance.
“So perfect” Harry whispered, his tongue circling her nipple, wanting to taste milk but unfortunately, there’s none.
“Sleep” just like that, she was out light light. Leaving him wide awake and watching until her breath evened out.
Can he wandlessly cast a holy aguamenti here? Fuck. The image of Draco on his stomach as he massages those thighs, back, shoulder is so sinfully realistic in his mind. It was if it's already happening in front of him.
What she saw when she arrive was a trail of candles on both sides with floating balloon in the air. They are glowing, surrounded by fairy lights and dancing with the breeze. There’s a straight path ahead and as Harry curled an arm around her, she let her eyes roam around at the beauty of the place. Ignoring the house as she focused on the surprise, the beauty, all of Harry’s efforts.
“What are you doing here?” he asked, taking his coat off and loosening his tie. He has to finish some papers today if he wishes to get on a vacation and take some time off work.
“Harry, please, oooh” she didn’t know what she’s saying please for but at the moment, it didn’t bother her. She wanted to cum but she also wanted to prolong the sensation. Wanted Harry’s magnificent tongue on her even more, the wet and warm mouth that enveloped her wetness, the thing that slid in and slowly explored her insides.
Ron gave her a friendly smile as they made their way to the dining area. Harry’s bestfriends have visited for a nice dinner at his house to check on them both after weeks of not seeing each other. And Dracy’s been casual with them and perhaps, Hermione’s already a nice friend?
Of fucking course, Draco Malfoy never fucking disappoints. He’s skilled, trained. He shouldn’t known better. He laughed.
This is not fucking right. What was really is the number one of the House of Potter morals? Fuck. He doesn’t know. He doesn’t know. He really cannot remember! Maybe he needs to talk to Sirius again.
That’s the number one and the most essential of morals. The one he shouldn’t disregard easily. Draco is the tempest that even the killing curse will not be enough to atone for Harry’s mistakes. Harry will burn in shame and wither away and be remembered not as the Head Auror or as a son of James Potter. He will be remembered as the one who pounced on an eighteen year old.
Remus moaned at the sight, Sirius on his knees never fails to turn him on, more so when he remembered the way Sirius used to act bratty in school, not following orders. But now, submitting so willingly, giving what Remus wants as he was left sated from his own orgasm.
He faked a sobbed because why is kisses is still on his mind? It’s just one kiss! One marvelous kiss! And where is that caterpillar by the way?
Harry was aware of her past. The famous legend of the Malfoys living with ruins. The Purebloods that were once at the top of the ladder have been pushed down the stairs, not even giving them space to redeem what was left of them. They were thrown down and she was left alone.
She whimpered when Harry put a third finger and started to finger fuck her pussy harder causing more slick to slid down from inside her. She can smell the whole office reeks of her lust and the sensations Harry is giving her.
Harry sighed, taking note of her stance and the way she fidgeted with the end of her skirt. She is nervous, he can tell. And by then, he knew what the answer was.
Harry didn’t return in the Malfoy Manor for the next three days. To which frustrated and angered the other side but it did make Harry feel a bit better. It also gave him the chance to rationalize and he meant, really rationalize.
Harry sighed and ruffled his hair. Fresh perspective is gonna be a very long one. Why did he send the patronus to Sirius when he could’ve just sent it to Remus instead? At least he’s sane.
Draco moaned hoarsely, arching his body, chest touching Harry’s as he encircled his legs around his waist to pull him closer, “Please, sir, need it so much, wanna make you cum”
“Fuck, ohh” Harry growled, feeling good himself. Dracy’s body is amazing. It felt too good above him just as it felt amazing last night when he fingered her. It didn’t matter if he’s not yet penetrating because this one felt so good already.
She bit her lips. She’s beginning to feel that familiar emotions inside her heart, her mouth suddenly wanted to blurt out something but before she could even, she cleared her throat.
True, Pansy has the money and the status and those goddamn mysterious connections that resulted him to where he is now. Hopefully, he’ll be out here sated and contented and relaxed.
“I’m already so hard for you, love. Daddy’s cock is already hard for you. Want to fuck you, want to take you again and again in this bed, wanting to make you cum once in my fingers, twice on my tongue and thrice on my cock.”
Draco bent down and peck him on his lips, “They aren’t just words, Harry. So please don’t think that way”
He squealed when Harry relented, paying for a two rounds of the game, which consisted of three spears per round. The dragon balls are wiggly on their places at the board, filled with different colors but nothing to give away whether the contents are nice or bad.
Draco moaned, hands shaking at their place at the stretch in his hole. Harry have always been so huge and thick. It never failed to stuff him so good and fill him up with a lot of his juices. Yeah, fuck.
But he breathed heavily and glared at him. And the first time he hears Draco whimper, fuck, it was nothing but a sumptuous sound. Excellent expression and perfect little boy.
Sirius cringed and blinked, “Uh, no. I’m fucking Re. Well, more like he’s fucking me because you know, I’m a power bottom”
Draco needs to know his work out routine, the gym where Harry exercises and the bench he lied in. He needs to straddle this man asap.
“Fuck baby. You taste so good” Harry complimented. He sat up and watched the way his fingers disappeared in and out of his hole. The way Draco quivered and his eyes rolling at the back of his head. It was such a sight, Harry palmed his cock.
Remus sighed. When he was satisfied, he pulled them out, quickly catching him when Sirius’ knees gave out. He smirked. Sirius’ ruined and debauched look is even more a sight.
He held back a noise when he felt him took a lungful of breath, almost as if taking in Draco’s scent on his mind. He bit his lips when he felt that tingling sensation again, sliding from his nape to his buttocks.
He gritted his teeth. That’s way out of his bounds. She’s teasing him and all of men around her. She should only be teasing him and not pulling others into the picture. Fuck, she’s his to undo and not for them to wink at.
Suspicious like a dog sneaking in but it’s the only thing they could do. More acceptable than running away and risking to blow their cover.
James and Lily looked to one another before a smile blossomed on her face, “It’s only fair the contract be sealed by something more binding than a piece of paper, isn’t it?”
Harry decided to owl his godfather Sirius. To at least let some steam off because his cock won't listen to him to calm down. Draco would not leave his mind and apparently, his crotch. He wouldn't deny he didn't like it when he saw Draco's motivation. It looked so bloody hot in him. So fucking good. The way his eyes lit up with firm determination and sharp bravery to get Harry into his bed.
Harry pump his hand up and down his shaft, thumb caressing his leaking slit before coating his cock with his precum,.
He wasn’t about to look at it when his eyes caught a smirking image of Harry and a brand new article which have heart shapes on them.
He clenched his jaw, “Do you know I am on leave?” his voice came with grave warning and the woman noticed it. Everyone is aware how high he is in the Ministry and to mess with someone like him is nothing but digging your own grave.
“I didn’t think you’d come back someday” Dracy stated honestly, “You were gone for Merlin knows how long until I got used to your absence and then I became numb”
When he stepped out of the Ministry, he instantly apparated straight to Gaydar who runs by every hour of the day. He arrived within a whiff, settled just by the entrance point to see familiar faces and non-familiar ones who can just as be nice as a popsicle.
Ron shrugged nonchalantly, “I don’t know. I just know that to render one Harry Potter speechless is to have someone propose to you”
Harry growled, his head sliding down to suck and bite at her neck and waved a hand to magically get their clothes off. She purred and tried to entice him to claim her already, “Please, Alpha. Need you. Need your knot”
“Fuck, oooh” he sobbed, fingers sliding down even more to tease through his sensitive perineum, giving it feathery touches and moaning loudly.
The new ones introduced to the modern curriculum was the History of Muggle Studies that makes absolutely no sense— for Harry that is, A Guide To Sure Spell Casting, Wizardry Studies of Illnesses centered for the ones who wants to be healers and the last one Harry is beginning to enjoy, Magic Development & Refinement.
Harry leaned his head down and smirked at Draco’s look. He kissed him on his forehead as he whispered sweet nothings to him endlessly. The softness of words opposed the roughness in his fingers and Draco felt like drowning in contradiction.
He wouldn’t look at Draco in the eye with appreciation in normal days. He would admit he was hoping for some kind of truce but is there a space for ceasefire if the both of them is facing something they cannot understand?
“So sweet” he whispered, holding her up. His fingers left her pussy to hug her figure and pounded harder to reach his own, “Fuck, tiger. Sucking me in so good. Yes, sweetheart. Clench around me. Milk me, fuck, tighter” he groaned.
“Oh, don’t worry, baby. I can do just fine. Come on. Let’s get you cleaned up” Harry scooped her up on his arms and walked towards the bathroom.
She panted and let Harry rest her hand at the sink, “Hold on, baby. Tell me if standing is too much” he whispered.
Dracy arched her back when she felt him tying her wrists at the headboard using his tie. Not too tight but enough to constrict her from pulling away. She gave an experimental tug and she had a vision of the torture of not having the chance to hold  him, scratch his back with her nails.
Many have fallen prey to what he can do but one person. The one who doesn’t cave to gather his attention, one who doesn’t kneel before him, one who doesn’t beg for a night.
Her mind tried to rear back to the incident yesterday but she did not let it win. She was thoroughly pampered yesterday. Harry, as soon as they came back, immediately reassured her and spoilt her of his attention. He bathed her, helped her slipped into one of his shirts before laying her down on his bed and ate her out, guiding her to relax while murmuring praises after praises.
He sighed and apparated to Diagon Alley. He immediately went to the flower shop and bought a bouquet before going to buy for a takeout.
Harry sighed as he poured himself a coffee the next morning. He didn't know what he was expecting but yesterday was not it.
Sirius blushed and nodded. Squealing when he was turned within a second, he found himself lying on his back as he looked at him, eyes widening. Remus didn’t speak but winked at him, tossing the blanket aside, pushing his thighs wide open before bending it over his shoulder and with one powerful thrust, Sirius screamed.
He really is beautiful. He somehow on his own ways defied the set of standards that circled around the world ‘beautiful’. He challenged the word gorgeous itself and proved that not only those who have these ‘soft’ features can be considered one. Harry doesn’t only consider him pretty because he’s young (there’s another word for that and it’s tasty).
"I want to try it. Can we, Harry?" Draco fluttered his eyelashes and Harry sighed and nodded. Those pleading eyes are enough to convince him to let him ride his bike.
He chuckled. His right hand gliding upwards. Taking his time to caress his soft belly, to his rib cage and his hard nipples, rolling it between his thumb.
They decided to walk around for the next minutes. Stopping for a second when they find things interesting and laughing when they see something they thought is silly. It was the recollection of some memories they had in their last Hogsmeade trip that had Draco smiling more.
“Mon chou” Harry bowed and handed him a stem of tulips, “I hope our love continues to blossom like this flower”
Harry bit his lower lip as he groaned hoarsely. Draco moaned at the overstimulation, exhausted body drained out of energy as he vaguely understands what Harry was telling him. He let his eyes close as he felt heat coating his insides as Harry throbbed inside him, thick globes of cum painting his hole as some leaked out.
His eyes slid down and he found himself staring at those cherry red lips, puckered slightly and calling out to him but he fought himself not to.
The woman smiled, “It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am Lily Potter and this is my husband, James Potter”
“Fuck, baby. That feels so good” he mumbled, hips thrusting slowly but he immediately halted his movements, letting her blow him on her own pace with no pressure.
He can fuck the best. That’s the gossip that’s never out of the trend and it’s only because he’s Harry Potter.
She stared at them knowingly but nothing too heavy on the eyes, “All I’ve seen before was the cloud in your eyes, Harry. It’s freeing now that you don’t have them, don’t you think?”
She gulped and is about to rephrase the question or probably change it entirely when Harry turned around and stared at her.
He whimpered from where he is standing. Fuck, how does Remus manages to look so innocent but so hot? So hot. All Sirius ever want to do is to fuck himself on his monster cock to oblivion, drive into the hilt, hit his bundle of nerves over and over again, make him see his own constellation with the brightest vision even in closed eyes.
He returned to his place few inches from her. With no regards of the witches and wizards surrounding them, he began to circle her, rounding her with such ease. It bothered her for how he seems to be so unaffected while she’s barely even standing.
When Harry put another finger in and began to pushed his fingers deeper, the tip reaching at that spot, she cannot help but rolled her eyes back, legs beginning to quiver as she struggled on her feet but Harry easily supported her.
He gripped Draco's arm tight and pulled him outside. "Harry" there's a slight mockery in his voice mixed with a satisfied one.
The changes in demeanor ought to scare him but fuck it. Harry is charming and surprisingly soft under his hard facade. Maybe all of these are the ones that called out for him after all. All of these are what drew him in.
They’ve been swimming on circles for the last few days. Harry swimming away and Draco trying to swim closer to him, catch him. They never did swim to one another to communicate. That’s one thing they both had missed and now, it led them into this. And maybe it was not from lack of trying but more like, lack of courage on Harry.
He was about to retort something nasty but held his tongue when he saw Harry’s fierce gaze focused on him. He felt so small then. Smaller than he really is. Harry looked so handsome but so cold at the same time. Those eyes that pinned him to be silent and keep the words to himself.
“We have questions. I know we do” Harry whispered, tugging Draco’s head to level his, “A lot to be answered”
It wasn’t a simple need for fervor, neither it was a call of flesh. It was more like hands reaching out to him, for comfort, for serenity.
Draco pouted and is about to open his mouth when Pansy spoke again, “No. Actually don’t tell me. I know”
Staring at his husband walking away, he thought back to what had happened back in Diagon Alley. Those people that just never stops. How can they be so cruel to someone whose soul was misled? Whose life was already dictated before it was even born? Whose future is already foretold before it actually happened and was really revealed? How can they be so ruthless?
Draco sighed as his hands were freed and was about to massage them when Harry caught hold of them, gathering it both close to his lips and kissed it repeatedly, “Sorry for this” he apologized,
He stepped out of his floo and looked around, the house seemed silent other than the clunking noise he can hear from the kitchen. He toss the coat in the couch and walked to see Dracy fixing the dining table.
At lunch, they would eat their lunch in the dining, most times Dracy would sit on his lap, eat from the same plate and at dinner, they would simply eat on their own and have a casual talk, of their plans for the next morning.
They knew where Tom lives. Just across the apartment complex they are in. Their spot carefully picked out for spying.
hello! it's pains me to say this but there is no update I will be posting for a few days or a week starting right after I post this.
She looked beautiful. The way the light inside the library lit her pale color more. She looked fresher than when she’d just arrive. She looked so frail then but now, there is this little glow and she had filled her body so she wouldn’t just be skin and bones.
The party was about a charity event Tom hosted on his name. Something that Draco thought is just a kindness cover of what’s really underneath his fingertips.
“Please? Just lunch. To clarify, completely platonic but I could do romantic if you want to” he winked. He’s aware his moves are all rusty when it comes to Draco but it’s all worth the try.
“You’ve been awfully distracted, mate? Anything happened when you and Malfoy fainted?” Dean asked with a smirk.
He whimpered when Harry slid his tongue in and tightened his hold on his waist, pulling him closer. They both pulled away when oxygen was badly needed. Draco was sure he’s sporting that dazed look on his face as Harry looked at him in hunger.
She breathed heavily, the scent of her arousal mixed with Harry’s own was making her dizzy as she tried to hold onto the bits of her sanity. She felt like combusting as his tongue did things she thought unimaginable.
“Was that a nice good morning?” he whispered just beside her ear and Dracy blushed before she nodded. She bit her lips as she began to feel both of their cum leaking out of her.
Oh well, he doesn’t plan to waste the glitter on his eyelids so he decided to walk over to the counter and order himself a drink.
Draco bit his lips when Harry shook his hands with a firm grip. His palms obvious of the wars he bravely faced, the roughness told his achievements as a powerful and successful Head Auror.
“Potter?” Lily looked at her husband weirdly, eyes looking around at the wine cellar. James was crouched down at the floor with a bottle of wine at hand and sobbing.
She leaned her back, her head resting on his shoulder and nearly mewled when Harry tightened his hold.
“Fuck, you smell amazing” Harry complimented her, his fingers started to play with her pussy lips, “And already so wet”
He cannot be having some love potion inside him! But it explains why he suddenly found himself appreciating Potter’s physique a while ago. There’s just no way he’s finding Harry handsome!
Harry sighed and nodded. They've been asking why he was packing his stuff and his father had over reacted a little saying he's neglecting his parents and it's not like he's a child, he's thirty for fuck's sake.
“Oh no. I wouldn’t like that. This is for someone special. I am not giving him free flowers. How much?”
Harry was gentle, controlled but so sweet and Draco felt himself melting. He leaned all his weight to Harry’s body. He gasped through the kiss when Harry’s hands slid down and hiked his dress up.
She breathed deeply before shaking her head as an answer. She looked at him in the eyes when Harry pushed her thighs open, his hand dangerously close to her cunt. Harry pecked her on her lips before finally letting a finger to the center of her pussy covered by the lacy knickers she’s wearing.
After waking up one day, finding a boggart in one of their trunks, they did research and found that there are creatures, very dangerous creatures that no one cares to stop. So they created a business to get the creatures that are unwanted out.
It started back when they got back for their fourth year. Draco and Harry started to have a rather strange relationship. It wasn’t something that was strange from the beginning. They had always been very affectionate to each other, giving hugs and holding hands to comfort each other. The year before, Draco had begun kissing Harry’s forehead, which every time he did, it still made Harry feel confused, warm and fuzzy inside.
“How on earth can you stand being in there... Merlin, that was bloody awful.” He said after he was done retching his insides out. Harry and the Professor shrugged. To them it was nothing.
Harry had seen a different side to the boy that night. He actually didn’t want to say no. And so he held his hand in front of him.
At this, his want was to great. He needed Harry in more ways than just kissing. He pushed Harry down onto the bed, crawling onto of the boy. He moved his lips down from Harry’s lip to the soft spot next to Harry’s ear, nibbling on his ear lobe, earning a moan in response.
He confronted Draco and Draco just shrugged it off. He felt like Draco was get distant and with all his very new confused feelings for Draco, he was hurt.
He had never actually apologized for that moment, but in his mind, he didn’t need to. Harry knew that Draco was a strong boy. Stronger than he himself knew. Draco would feel better knowing that Harry ended his life after almost ending his right here in this tile floor.
Draco realized that he was wrong before. He did deserved a soulmate and as of today, he was going to fight for that soulmate.
"After careful consideration, we find the defendant Draco Lucius Malfoy guilty of the crimes he has committed during his time as a death eater. We sentence him to life in Azkaban. Case dismissed."
