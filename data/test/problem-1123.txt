Draco sighs and turns back to the coffee he had been making when Harry had walked in.
Scrivenshaft’s began stocking Muggle stationery soon enough. It started with fountain pens and notebooks, both of which had enthralled Draco. Gradually, with the resounding success of the products, they branched out, bringing in lines and brands of gel pens, post-cards, post-it notes, pencils and erasers, drawing materials. Muggleborn startups began writing to them with offers, newspapers accepted their advertisements.
“But there is something I need to speak to you about.”
“Guess that’s my call then, mate,” Weasley says, grinning at Harry before rushing up the stairs after his girlfriend.
“If you’d asked, I would have slammed my door on your face,” Harry says without hesitation. He would never, not in a million years, speak for Lucius Malfoy and spare him the well deserved hell of Azkaban.
‘Harry!’ comes the voice from the next room a couple of days later and Harry jumps out of bed at the shrill note he hears in Draco’s tone, fearing the worst.
The day Harry kills himself, he wakes up in the morning to make Draco a cup of coffee.
Draco reels a little with surprise. He knows Harry isn’t the type, but part of him had expected to be the filthy little secret. A hidden away toy, a written off friendship. But Harry told… told… the other two thirds of the Golden Trio about it and it sparks something in his heart that spirals from a match into a wildfire.
Now, the memory is tainted by the pressure of Harry’s hand on his mouth and the strange light in his eyes that leaves Draco feeling hollow.
Closer to a scarf cut in half, actually. No single thread that could be tugged, just an unravelling mess of torn fabric that had once been something real and beautiful.
“I’m sorry—” he begins, turning towards Harry but Harry cuts him off with a kiss. It’s been burning through his veins all day, watching Draco in his comfort zone, leaned against the backrest of their restaurant booth, exchanging jibes and insight on their friends with Parkinson. They don’t talk about their friends the way Harry would about his, but there’s an odd fondness in their insults and mockery, an affection that asserts itself in vicious slander and the assurance that it’s allowed. It’s irrationally attractive—Draco’s carefree smile curving his lips, his grey eyes flickering with mirth.
He probably should start calling the prat Harry.
God, he loves that hipbone.
“So,” Scorpius says slowly, not allowing the hysteria to set in, “even if you wanted, you couldn’t transform into me right now? No matter what you do?”
Once he’d heard Neville’s footsteps fade into the forest, he’d dropped to his knees and sought the Stone out with the Wand.
“Everyone at school thought you both were—” Harry emulates Malfoy’s vague gesture.
If only she’d known Scorpius.
,” Draco says through gritted teeth and furious eyes, “of my
He closes his mouth, cursing himself colourfully internally for running it in the first place. Unwarranted, unwanted words are shameful, he knows that. It has been drilled into him for years, especially the last couple. He clearly hasn't learnt much.
“I don’t want to,” Potter says, the first words he’s spoken since he decided to tell Draco his perfectly reasonable argument downstairs was unwarranted. “I like being here.”
“Nothing I haven’t done before,” Potter smiles.
. It’s all unrequited, Father.”
being paid rather handsomely to put up with this and anything else he can come up with. It’s an effective way of draining vaults that do not have to pay for a child’s education anymore.
Draco shrugs. He doesn’t want to talk to Potter anymore. He needs Potter out of his house. As soon as possible. “She’s your friend, ask her.”
Draco blinks at the mingled, mumbled syllables that have merged together to form one long string of unintelligible sounds. “I beg your pardon?”
All that light. All that life.
“Pity,” Draco says. If words were knives, Draco would have bled him dry by now.
Draco’s jaw drops open. He had heard rumours about the Saviour’s less than ideal childhood and had passed it as a load of tosh. Just something to make the already overly sung Hero even more sensational. But then he remembers Harry telling him about his repressed memories of childhood, triggers he doesn’t even know of and a sick, sick feeling settles in his stomach.
It’s a surprisingly warm sound.
“When did she send those to you?” Draco asks, incredulous.
Ginevra brightens. “Great, now that Ron’s left the Aurors to work with George. He was always so good with strategy– he’s helping out with advertisement and accounting, and George feels steadier, working with a brother again.” She doesn’t mention that last bit with any hint of resentment or bitterness, just a flash of melancholy in her wide brown eyes. “It’s been fun, working with them on the stuff– George’s always been a fucking genius, everyone thought Fred was the crazy one, he was just louder. George was the one who thought up all the stupid pranks which
followed by an explanatory crash from within his, Draco realises the walls are also paper thin.
She shakes her head. “Believe it or not, I didn’t leave the house to accost you on Diagon.” She smiles. “Happy coincidence, eh?”
“Weren’t you the one going on about time being a mortal construct?”
“Hermione is alright. Distraught, anxious but comparatively alright. Ron is sleeping but it’s natural sleep. And you have Draco Malfoy to thank for all of that.”
That happened sometime around the Court Case That Sent Everything To Living Hell. A little before it, perhaps. Definitely not after. The morning they both dressed in their formal robes to go into the Wizengamot meeting, staring into separate mirrors, kissing Scorpius on the head without looking each other in the eye and going over their respective case files, Harry knows for certain they did not sit down to eat together.
Scorpius wants to laugh. Hysterically.
He does, and closes his eyes in tightening shame when he notices Gianni has splashed in a couple drops of Calming Draught.
Harry has never heard an elf sound that happy save for when Dobby had acquired his tea cosy hat.
Harry’s fingers press into the sides of Draco’s neck, where the arch of his throat meets his collarbone. He’ll have to glamour the bruises away tomorrow.
– looking every bit the rugged, handsome man from the photo albums Harry had shown him. His smile is like a beam of light, charming like a revelation and Scorpius finds traces of Father in the aristocratic line of the nose, in the slender, tapering fingers and the beautiful eyes.
Archibald had predictably gone red in the face and had blustered for another fifteen minutes about the importance of tradition and how the modernisation of the economy by introducing electricity and television ruined lives. It had predictably circled right back to Shacklebolt and his ‘pro-Muggle’ schemes and how they damaged Wizarding Society.
August passes in a haze of summer sunshine and Harry’s brown skin turning gold in it. They find new cafes to love and new waitresses who speak broken and accented English. The receptionist at their little motel is now a regular fixture of their mornings and they’ve both taken to wishing her a very good morning when they leave the keys to their room with her for safekeeping.
But by far the worst times are when Draco is completely resigned when Harry steps in at odd hours of the night,  acting like nothing out of the ordinary has happened, pretending that the warming charm he keeps casting on the food is just a routine act, not bringing up the fact that Harry forgot to send a Patronus again. He looks at Harry and in those grey eyes lies a distance that Harry aches to fill but sometimes finds himself falling short.
“I found the Menagerie,” he says, unnecessarily, but Draco isn’t paying attention.
The force with which he spins around to glare at her almost causes him to sprain his neck. “Volatile?” He hisses. “I’ll show you volatile! Potter’s the one who goes around looking like one misplaced word would make him cast an Unforgivable and you call
One year, Draco has been telling himself.
Harry opens his eyes to bright light and a sense of unfamiliar emptiness, instinctively aware that he isn’t alive.
But he understands that. He understands not talking to the Death Eater, the bloke who stood by while the Carrows spewed Unforgivables, the snob who made almost everyone’s life a living hell from First Year itself. If he’d been in their shoes, he’d probably have cast a few unnoticed jinxes and hexes by now. They’re being merciful, really.
“There was– there was a woman, once. I was away for a game, and Harry hadn’t called in days, and I was fucking furious, and she was there, and she was beautiful and I– I made a decision I couldn’t take back. One I had to live with, bury deep within myself, one I had to face in the mirror every day after that. I couldn’t look Harry in the eye for months.”
“You said it wasn’t serious, just a bit of fun on the side.”
‘There’s a cabin I have up in Scotland. Quite close to Hogwarts, actually. Lots of fresh air, pine trees and chirping birds- I think you’ll like it.’
“What should we talk about then?” Draco asks with a small smile of his own as Harry moves closer. There’s a breath of space between them and Harry’s hips are pressing against his own.
“I found the Menagerie,” he says. “It’s beautiful.”
Eventually, Draco probably takes mercy on Harry who is now arching and spasming on the bed almost continuously. With one finger slipping into his hole fairly easily, he doesn’t bother teasing and just swallows Harry’s dick down as far as it goes from the angle at which he’s sitting.
“What–“ He cuts himself off before he can ask. He doesn’t think he could handle an answer. Worse still, the lack of one.
Sometimes he hates Weasley and Granger for having this man to themselves. Other times, he’s grateful for them, for the rejection, for the years that shaped Harry Potter into the kind of man who saved the world from everything Draco Malfoy stood for.
“It’s not a problem. How do you take your tea?”
“Have you considered modernising the shop?” Draco had asked after Archibald had finished blaming his pathetic condition on every factor that wasn’t his incompetence. “After the War, people aren’t looking for traditional supplies and techniques anymore. Selling parchment made of imported plants and macaw feather quills will not bring you new customers.”
The roiling, curling anger finally finds a focus, and he feels his face twist into a snarl, the words coming out almost against his will but horrifyingly suited to his voice and his face and his motherfucking status—
‘I am,’ Harry says, amused by the almost childlike quality Draco’s voice has acquired.
“Get on with it.”
This kiss isn’t rough, but it’s a little biting, filled with the promise of more. Pressed against the closed door to his own room, Harry wonders what fourteen-year-old Harry would think, knowing he would one day kiss and be kissed by Draco Malfoy and enjoy it. Nothing good, but it’s an interesting idea.
Everyone who’s ever come to Privet Drive has looked at Harry as something other than a human being, but coming from Draco, who before this week had been surprisingly decent, it stings more than Harry thinks it should. It makes him angry with himself and consequently angry with the world, and even the tiny cafe they go to for lunch with white decor and blooming flowers curling over the walls does nothing to cheer him up. He snaps at the waitress and then apologises profusely, he trips over a stone on the sidewalk and curses loud enough for several heads to turn in judgemental stares and eventually bangs his door on his way to his room so loud that the glass vase on the table near the door teeters on the edge and falls over, breaking to pieces.
“Not just the fact that you want Pureblood and Muggle cultural exchanges. The fact that you thought Malfoy would be a good candidate, that’s brilliant too. I mean, I wouldn’t have thought that prick would agree but if he does, he is a rather perfect candidate.”
He hears the underlying question beneath the joke.
“I didn’t know that was possible,” Scorpius says. “Death does not just pay a visit to the living, like some sort of brooding houseguest.”
In his dreams, Draco still talks about Anthony Filibuster and Florentina Fortescue’s endeavours to make her father’s recipes public which are being thwarted by Florian II. They talk while Scorpius plays with his toy broomstick in the garden and they talk while Scorpius attempts to climb Harry’s foot like a tree.
“Because you’re a stupid git who’s had too much money his whole life and not enough people telling him no. But you can still learn. And because whatever you saw with Voldemort, in your house, with your Father, has made you a better man than you were a boy.” He looks around, at the curtains, at the open door, at the bed, and then looks back to Draco, a little smirk pulling on the corner of his lips. “And the Italian villa sounded positively splendid when you spoke about it so mournfully into your whisky and I wanted to see it.”
She’d met his eyes then, watched him struggle to breathe with tears in her own and had rushed out of the room crying when he’d said in a hoarse, broken voice that this is why he couldn’t hate them. That they needed him to keep their own pices together just as much as he needed them now.
“Right.” He swallows past the lump in his throat. He doesn’t know why she bothers to look after him the way she does. It’s her and Ron holding him together, he knows. If they left, he would fall to pieces, come undone like parchment in the rain.
It bears repeating, especially in present company, Firewhisky makes for an
“You heard me,” Harry returns defiantly.
He arches when Harry’s fingers cup his balls and roll them together and Harry murmurs, “Do you have an answer?”
After a few moments, she removes herself and wipes her face on the back of her hand. “Thank you,” she whispers, voice hoarse and barely audible from all the shouting. “Do you have some Calming Draught? I think I ran out.” Draco nods and reaches into his pocket where he keeps his supply of the Draught. He hands it to her and she measures it out drop my drop onto her tongue. After she swallows, she casts a throat clearing charm and says, “If you want to leave, you can. I can handle this by myself.”
“Can one of you stay with me?” he pleads. He’s almost ashamed of how broken his voice comes out.
“No,” Draco tells him, unsure why he feels he owes explanations to a hallucination. Maybe he’s hallucinating because he needs to explain these things, say them out loud before they fester within him and kill him slowly from the inside with the pressure of not being able to get out. “I can’t sit in those rooms. They’re places where Vol-Voldemort or Bellatrix did and I can’t sit there. I can clean, I can perform magic, I can throw out furniture or try to get rid of Dark Magic but I can’t, I can’t sit there. Spend time there. If you want to, go ahead, but you’ll be alone.”
There are frowns in the pews. Draco understands the sentiment wholeheartedly—Potter threw the men who died to protect him under the proverbial bus to testify for Draco of all people. It’s bizarre and if not for the cutting straps pushing into his wrists, Draco would have thought he was caught in some fever dream.
but all he manages is a tight smile and a curt nod.
The cabin is a small wooden structure in the midst of a forest and surprisingly unostentatious given that it is Black family property.
He tells himself he’s seeing things when Draco’s eyes appear shinier than they should be.
“Yes,” Harry says, wondering why people keep asking him that. He’s not a child, he’s allowed to make whatever decisions he pleases. “Yeah, I. Since we’re both leaving and all. It might be best to have a drink and—” He scrubs a hand over his face. “Leave the past in the past.”
He looks like he would do it again.
Draco’s eyes are so full of overwhelmed anxiety that Harry feels quite alarmed. Hesitantly Draco begins, “If we go further than this, it will be my first time.”
Except—
The gates rise tall and forbidding. Even without having reached the house, the unwelcome air of the property strikes Harry. After having the Horcrux in him removed, his sensitivity to dark magic has increased. The best way Harry could explain to Hermione what he was feeling when he couldn’t bring himself to enter the attic of Grimmauld was to tell her that it was something similar to being a recovering alcoholic in a bar. She had nodded and set to cleaning the attic with Ron and Harry had rushed back to his room, darkened it and stared at the ceiling for four hours. And now, the Manor, a stronghold of dark, ominous magic a few feet away is making Harry’s stomach churn in a way that makes him want to Apparate as far away from there as possible. But Hermione’s tear streaked face and her voice telling Harry she’s leaving flashes in his mind’s eye and he raises his hand to the gate hesitantly.
“Wait a minute,” Draco interrupts. “Finnegan’s gay? For
It doesn’t even happen elegantly—a touch on the shoulder, a glance across the narrow street, a gaze caught and released quickly through the tinted glass of a suspect shop window. It happens as most things do between them—explosively, messily, with a whole bunch of broken glass and creative profanities. In the aftermath of Harry and Malfoy, there is always a wreckage.
Draco’s sure his mouth is open. He stares at her, at a complete loss because of all the things he expected, this isn’t it.
He gets up, groaning when the motion causes the world to tilt dangerously, black spots appearing before his eyes. He blinks a few times, adjusting to reality separate from the darkness beneath his covers, and takes in the sight of his bedroom. There’s broken glass everywhere (thankfully not on the bed). He summons his bedroom slippers with a lazy flick, certain that he’ll shred his soles to pieces if he tries to navigate the mess in his current hungover and distinctly discombobulated state.
“Nowhere,” Harry admits. “I’ve never been allowed.”
“Who are they intimate with, then?”
‘Yes, yes of course. If you need to put them to sleep, there’s a room down the hall. This… this is Harry’s room.”
His mind is not safe, but it is still private, and he wonders in the most secluded crevices of it what it means to feel those flutters in the depths of his stomach at the sight of Potter’s broad shoulders shaking.
“These are good people, Malfoy,” she says quietly. “And I don’t say that because they saved the world. I say that because Harry was my friend when everyone called me Loony Lovegood and stole my things and made fun of the Quibbler. Because Ron pushed me to join Healing School when I needed something, anything to tide me over the death of my friends. Because Hermione taught me charms that kept out strangers from my drawers and strange boys from my bed. These are good people.” She gives him a long, hard stare. “But you? You’ve given me pain. You started calling me Loony Lovegood, you gave Hyacinth Dartmouth the idea of taking my things, the oddities I like to collect and put them out of my reach where the whole school would see them and laugh at them. You sent hate mail to the Quibbler office. I owe you nothing at all but I am telling you, I am advising you to go see someone because I can see you need it.”
Malfoy jerks up to look at him with eyes so wide that Harry’s alarmed. “What? Don’t tell me you’re homopho—”
“Alohomora,” he whispers at the lock, wary of touching anything with his hand. The heavy bolt on the inside slides aside soundlessly and the gate swings open with a slight creaking noise. Wand held at the ready, he steps in through the gate and surveys the area. There are no house elves, Harry knows. All of them have been seized by the Ministry and employed in the Ministry of Magic itself. Narcissa Malfoy had left for France after being acquitted of all War crimes and Lucius Malfoy was rotting in Azkaban with a life-imprisonment sentence with no possibility of parole. And so, Harry thinks, the knowledge making him slightly uneasy, Malfoy should be here, completely alone. The Manor is a tall imposing tower of stone and for one moment, sympathy courses through him. Grimmauld is smaller than the Manor and even then, when neither Hermione nor Ron are in, Harry feels alone in a space too big to be safe, to be comfortable. To be alone in what used to be Voldemort’s… house, it can’t be easy.
“Doesn’t she mind?” Draco asks eventually.
“Draco," Hermione sighs, "Go and have fun for an evening instead of being a killjoy for once? Please? Just one evening and its for a good cause.”
‘Never happened?’ Draco asks, and his voice is low. When Harry turns to look at him, his eyes are dark.
Draco raises his own glass of whisky to his lips and takes a swig. The Muggle drink is refreshing in a way the potent burn of Firewhisky isn’t.
Twelve months, Potter tells him. It’s jarring.
“I know,” she says, removing it.
Draco blinks. “So you want to come with me to… what? Teach me humanity?”
He’s gasping, he can tell, but there’s the voice again, eerily similar to Draco’s, telling him to breathe, and Harry doesn’t feel quite as cynical about breathing anymore, especially not when the voice gives him a template of exaggerated breaths to copy.
It doesn’t sound like a half bad idea, if he’s being honest.
Hermione looks to be at a complete loss. It is such an unexpected and unfamiliar expression on her face that Harry feels helplessness tugging at him. “It, it wasn’t okay. And I know I should be happy or maybe at least satisfied that he’s, he’s suffering, it’s what I thought I wanted to see but…” he trails off, unsure of how he feels about the situation. Dismay, regret, anger, frustration. Guilt. No joy. No satisfaction.
“The War is over, Malfoy,” she says, her demeanour intent. “I’m not interested in holding grudges.”
“Stop,” Harry says. “Stop… Just, hold me accountable. Tell me I fucked up. Let me make it up to you. You didn’t deserve that. You didn’t deserve any of it.”
Shattered glass in his bedroom. Shattered hearts in every bedroom they have been in together. Shattered voices, shattered lives.
“There are probably spells and charms—”
Draco watches the muscles of his arm strain against the black fabric of his shirt and his mouth waters. Harry’s so fucking strong, and he understands it so much better in these moments where he gets to just observe.
“Aunt Petunia wanted to, I think. She was bringing some ointment when Uncle Vernon asked her what she was doing. And when she told him, he laughed and called for Dudley to tell him he was proud of the fine son he was bringing up. He didn’t let Petunia bring in the ointment.”
“When they find the leather pouch on you, they’ll find the nullified wand,” says a voice behind him, and Harry whirls around as the familiarity of the voice permeates his consciousness.
“That’s the dosage for a fortnight. You’ve finished it in two days?”
. At forty two, as a man, he’s sharper, greyer and taller, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to being a Malfoy left with no choice.
The throat clearing again halts his train of thought.
“Did you want an apology?” Draco asks. He expected this. In fact he’s prepared for it.
Which is why he knows now that Granger is lonely.
Parkinson turns a considering look on him and says, “Potter gets it.”
“He’s right there, his skin is right there, tell me, does it look like yours?”
Draco thinks he understands.
Even the name is enough to draw a visceral reaction from Draco. He feels his jaw clench, his fingers tighten around the glass. Something rattles on the edge of the table and his whole being feels flayed open and raw.
This was when Granger dropped the bombshell. “I want you to spearhead the Pureblood integration portion.”
He hadn’t realised how painfully hard he’d gotten, too caught up in the emotions of it all. But he is hard as a rock in his pants, sweating and squirming and desperate to relieve the pressure and he almost untrapped one of his hands only for Harry to look up at him sharply, eyes brimming with warning. The frustrated groan had seemingly delighted Harry whose movements acquired a renewed fervour.
Kinship, he thinks. A feeling all Slytherins know a little too well.
Draco takes two deep gulps of whisky and tries to take a third, only to discover he’s drained the glass. He sets it down on the table and steeples his fingers. She meets his eyes.
And so when he lifts the Glamour and keeps it away in his box of memories of a time he would rather lock away, the Glamour leaves his scars naked and exposed under the unreliable protection of clothing.
pleasure. Harry slides in to the first knuckle, and Draco hisses out a breath.
He hears voices downstairs as he changes out of his pants and pulls on the only clean underwear he could find shoved at the back of the shelf. It’s not Ron, Ron is with George right now. He can make out Hermione’s voice and she seems to either be ranting or explaining a detailed plan to someone.
She continues, to Draco’s puzzlement and slight amusement, to switch between calling him Draco and Malfoy. He doesn’t know whether to find it annoying or amusing. He himself cannot imagine calling her Hermione yet. In any case, the question she asked deserves a response, no matter how humiliating it is for him.
“Potter,” Draco groans. Harry smiles innocently at him.
“We’re already having sex,” he points out, a little redundantly. Harry exhales and tries to not be annoyed.
“Why not?”
“I love you,” Scorpius hears, a low murmured whisper that feels too private for him to witness. “I’m sorry.” There’s a pause for a few seconds followed by a low humourless laugh.
“To the Burrow,” she says, quite matter of factly without looking at him.
, he notices she looks sleepless, the bruises under her eyes deep and dark. Her hair is longer than it was at Hogwarts, but it’s the awkward length of terrible upkeep that Harry knows all too well and her skin is pale and sallow.
‘I’ll make it up to you,’ Harry murmurs against the shell of Draco’s ear. ‘I promise, love. I’ll make all of this up to you.’
He’d withdrawn the Hallow dispassionately from the tangled, skeletal remains of the Headmaster, sealed the tomb back up and had stared at the Elder Wand with a sort of fascinated horror. He’d tucked it into his pocket after a while, sat there a little longer for appearance’s sake and had then left, bidding the headmistress goodbye.
“Assuming what?”
His magic crackles around him, an uncontrollable burst of energy fuelled by grief.
Harry’s eyes close as the words seemingly strike against some unknown part of him. When he opens them again, something in them makes Draco uneasy. It’s different from the looks Harry has been giving him all evening and Draco’s stomach twists in fear.
The dynamic shifts between Potter and him in that night. He doesn’t have a name for it but he thinks that that line of ‘not-quite-friends’ has officially been crossed. They don’t talk much but when they do, the discomfort all but disappears.
And when a third pair of arms wrap around them from the side, Hermione’s bushy hair tickling Harry’s nose and her voice saying Ron is too tall for his own bloody good, Harry laughs through his tears and doesn’t pull away up until Ron complains saying, “Harry, there’s snot on my damn t-shirt, mate!”
“Yeah?”
Harry isn’t good with words, not the way Hermione is, or even Draco himself. He’s acceptable when he writes down what he wants to say or when he’s so wound up that words he didn’t know existed in his vocabulary make themselves known. But he has a better track record with actions, so he pulls Draco down for another kiss, taking care to angle their heads right so their lips meet in a gentle, soft collision that doesn’t feel like a hurtling comet but instead like an alignment of the stars.
If Scorpius had a beating heart, this would be when it would have skipped a beat.
“I’m not trying to argue with you,” Draco says. “I’m not accusing you. I’m pointing out the facts and I’m trying to find a reason that either justifies or at the very least explains them.”
But the poison Harry has worked into his system has done its job, and there is no part of Harry left to listen to him.
It’s the colour of Draco’s eyes. He focuses on it, because he thinks he’s dying, and when he dies, he doesn’t want to see green and red flashing lights—
Draco distantly wonders if he should be surprised. He realises in the face of that laugh, he isn’t. He realises he simply does not care. He realises he wouldn’t care about time ever again if Harry spent it in his company.
But within moments, the Saviour turned Auror returns and Harry’s jaw hardens, his eyes turn cool and his voice cuts through the air crisp and sharp.
The little half-smirk Potter sends his way is enough to kick his heart into overdrive. When Potter says, “I’ll find you anyway,” Draco turns away and tries not to blush.
Scorpius is certain tears would have obscured his vision by now, if he’d retained the ability to cry. The ache in his empty chest intensifies.
Draco learns, with every undone button and short, steady nod when Harry’s eyes flicker to his for affirmation and reaffirmation of his agreement, that there is no ruination in consent.
But when they are all in the room together, everything comes to a standstill. There is no movement. Scorpius finds himself startled by the sound of birds alighting on the windowsill, so accustomed he is in those moments to the statue like stillness. Breaths are cautious, measured. One too loud might bring on eye-contact better left avoided. One too soft might bring on panic better left bottled.
There’s quiet in the room. Draco drinks some more.
Harry shifts and lines up and Draco feels a blunt head poking at his entrance. He takes a deep breath and nods again and Harry gradually, painstakingly gradually pushes in past the tight ring of muscle.
This is how Malfoy blood speaks its love.
Draco’s lungs feel painfully tight. “He saw me without it. He told you.”
“What’s new?” Draco asks, not looking up from where he’s rummaging through his notes to find Snape’s instructions on how to create Dreamless Sleep given that Slughorn just asks them to look at the book and be done with it.
“Oh thank Merlin,” Hermione says.
Before Draco can volunteer to go and fetch it himself, Granger has vacated her seat.
Fuck.
“I’m not
He’d called out to Scorpius, pressing down on the shutter at the precise moment Scorpius had turned, charming grin place. The picture had been delightful, the lighting perfect, the grin heartbreaking in its resemblance to Draco’s genuine smiles.
It gets significantly harder to ignore Malfoy’s unveiled desire to share Harry’s cup when a long, pale finger makes its way into Harry’s line of sight, dips its condescending way into his cup, swirls itself around and draws back.
“Go faster,” Draco says, almost on the verge of begging as Harry drags his cock out, slow and long, Draco’s passage clinging to it.
She sighs. “All of your dead, Harry, they’re floating around you, inside you, like ghosts. And you, you’re in their realm more than you are in ours! We’re watching you waste away to nothing and we’re watching you be-become a ghost yourself and it’s, it’s so hard to just stand here and watch…” She trails off and Harry realises with horrified shock that she’s crying.
She shrugs again. “We’ve been together since Hogwarts, Draco. He’s always been something of an explorer. Hoping he’d be satisfied to simply settle with me would be naive, and growing up with six brothers breaks you out of naivety by the time you’re three and sitting in the tool shed with a broken broom.”
Without missing a beat Harry says, “When you stop needing it and stop wanting me to.”
“Was I now?”
“Harry?”
The unsaid words,
Draco’s eyes fly open and he looks at Harry with a sort of desperate longing as he says, ‘I know. I know. I’m so close, Harry, please.’
“I know what you wanted to do to me, Draco. That’s not the point. You didn’t deny the other ones.”
Death shrugs. The gesture is so decidedly human that Scorpius wants to laugh. Instead he nods. “Please.”
The warmth blossoms.
This, Draco thinks, this is the moment to laugh hysterically. This is the moment to tell himself that the side effects of too many Calming Draughts are settling in and he is definitely hallucinating even if his hallucinations tell him they aren’t hallucinations. Hallucinations aren’t supposed to know who they are anyway. They’re not supposed to let you know either. So he can’t trust what his hallucinations tell him. Because unless he’s hallucinating, Potter is standing in front of him, wand holstered away, saying he is in Malfoy Manor to apologise and that, that is a stretch even for someone who likes stretching the truth to its furthest limits the way Draco does.
“Harry, say something!” Hermione urges, looking at him, frustrated energy shining through in her eyes.
“So where were you thinking of taking me?” Potter asks, sitting down beside her.
“We can’t be friends,” he says eventually.
Uncertain and wary, he stares at the cup, wondering what Harry is up to. If it is a gesture of reconciliation, it is too little, too late. If it is a reminder of Harry’s presence in his life, it is unnecessary.
“Why?”
“I have your wand,” Potter says, looking at him. He has a habit of making full eye contact when he speaks and it unsettles Draco who’s only used to Slytherin tactics of eye-contact. There are rules for this sort of thing, he thinks indignantly. One never makes eye-contact when making semi-monumental statements. This is the time for a flickering gaze- a split second of full eye contact, a moment spent looking away, things like that. But Potter clearly isn’t intimate with eye etiquette.
“More,” he begs, and keens when Harry buries his finger fully in Draco’s arse, its path slicked by lube and Draco’s wanton writhing. He leaves it in and stars burst behind Draco’s eyes with the force of the feeling of fullness. “Move,” Draco says, and thrashes when Harry acquiesces, warm, broad palm a gentle pressure against Draco’s arse cheeks.
Something warm blooms in Draco’s chest. Draco feels the knife twist in his gut as he tries to squash it and fails.
He’s facing away so his face can’t be seen but he’s standing with his arms folded and his feet apart. His posture makes his shoulders look broader and though Potter is a little bit shorter than him, in this moment he seems to almost tower over the long shadows that fall around him.
After two more spoonfuls of blissful silence, Malfoy slams his own cup down and stares imploringly at Harry, casting unquestionably hungry looks at Harry’s cup, where the chocolate has begun to melt and droplets are cascading down the thin papery sides.
Three words.
“You know,” he says conversationally, voluntarily speaking for the first time this evening, “my son was the one to first suggest I do this.” He gestures between them, and the woman’s eyebrows shoot so far into her hairline, they run the risk of disappearing.
She doesn’t bat an eyelash at the words, caustic though they are. After all, he surmises, she
“Why now, Potter?” He asks, simply because there is absolutely nothing else he can think to say in this situation.
“Draco, look at me.”
“We’re going to pretend you didn’t say that,” Harry says and Draco almost collapses from how much it fucking hurts. At least Harry isn’t leaving.
“So what—”
A young wizard of forty two, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, an attractive, kind man– the minute Harry was single again, witches and wizards would be falling over themselves trying to catch his eye.
“But– but, these are old alliances!” Scrivenshaft had said, panicked and wide-eyed.
Most importantly, the diligent Auror who never asked for personal leave except when Kingsley thrust it on him has been staying home three days a week (four, if one includes Sundays), asking his PA to take over paperwork and his best friend (and Deputy) to take over the more challenging field work.
“My love,” he begs eventually, voice hoarse and broken. “Oh my darling. Come back.
“I missed my mother,” Malfoy says, and it’s Harry’s turn to drop his fork. “We were sitting outside, and there were roses. She loves roses, her perfume always smells of them. And she—she tends the Manor’s rose gardens by herself. They’re probably falling to ruins now.”
“Fucking Merlin, Potter, you’re… glorious!” Draco ultimately says, throwing his hands up. “You… don’t just get to call me good when you’re kind and brilliant and deserving of literally anyone who isn’t me!”
“Yes,” Draco replies, weary. He can’t defend his decisions to Potter now. Calming Draught is legal, if frowned upon by Healers when taken in incorrect dosages. Potter is no Healer, the last time Draco checked.
“A free,
But the strange light in Harry’s eyes has intensified and the hand on his mouth is too strong.
“We?”
“Gianni is believing his eyes! And Gianni is asking Master to put him down right this minute,” the elf croaks, tiny hands coming up to press against his ears.
“You were angry and you fucked up once, Ginevra. It’s not the same thing.” He’s hoarse. Hoarser than he was the night after Harry left him in a hotel room once with come sliding down his thighs, his face buried in the pillow, his throat burning from where Harry had pressed against his Adam’s apple with all the lean, coiled energy of a wildcat.
Draco doesn’t want to. Doesn’t want to see the gentle way in which Harry will let him down, doesn’t want to see that vitriolic undercurrent of disgust once again. All he’s ever wanted, he’s had in these perfect, unadulterated moments, and he doesn’t want to look Harry in the eye and let him see Draco fall apart when Harry takes it away.
Malfoy looks away, eyes fixed on a portrait frame on the far wall. “It’s the master bedroom, specially designed for—er. Couples. My parents stayed there, during our time here.”
But Potter asks, “And then?” and Draco smiles.
“You’re sure?”
She coughs delicately. “Indeed it is.”
Hermione nods.
familiar ground.
“You know what I mean,” he says. Draco is silent, but when their eyes meet, the understanding could not be clearer between them.
Draco stares at him. At this man, with his messy mop of hair and large eyes and long limbs, sitting in his bed, sipping wine while he gauges Draco’s reaction to his tidal wave of words which should not make sense but do. At this man whom he’d hated for rejection out of a petty childhood spitefulness that his father had been proud of and his mother had ignored.
“Of course not,” Harry says, after he processes the words. “Unless you want me to.”
And he does.
“Who?” he asks, wincing at the naked hope colouring his voice. This is what the darkness feeds on. He can feel it immediately, crowding in on him—hungry, yawning mouths eager to suck the faint glimmers of it from his soul.
“What happened?” He asks Harry, voice raspy and weak. Harry gets up, pulls out a glass and casts an Aguamenti into it. Malfoy tracks his movements with confused grey eyes but when Harry holds out the glass to him, he drinks the whole thing in one go. Harry refills it and Malfoy sips at it again before repeating, “What happened, Potter?”
The cold in his insides at knowing he had cocked up a good thing right in front of him without even trying. Without doing anything but kissing the man he wanted, he man he dreamed of, back.
move them.”
He chooses to focus on Granger’s hair, trying to count the curls on it, to have something to do that grounds him. Numbers always ground him.
Potter’s smile is quick and heartbreaking in its accessible ease. Draco can only ever dream of such an expression coming easily to him. His smiles are twisted with mockery even when he doesn’t intend them to be. Potter’s lips are dark and when they curve in a smile, the perfect cupid’s bow of them stretches out in a warm glide. “A mentor if you will.”
Malfoy keeps his eyes on his pizza. “In fifth year, Pansy started dating Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he says.
It’s dark and filled with screams and forgotten echoes of forgotten people and their forgotten pain, but above everything else, it is freezing.
Yes, that, that is a recent development.
The shame of it! The horror of it, a Malfoy in exile, a Malfoy thinking about work, a Malfoy willingly handing over the contents of half the vaults without a fight. The pressure of generations of Malfoys disapproving of this heir chokes him until he’s gasping, until the hot tears are sliding down his face, obscuring his vision, until the only sound in his ears is the horrible, rasping breaths he’s drawing in, until his nose is filled with the scent of the roses that remind him of his mother’s perfume and her gentle smile and her iron will.
“Yeah?”
“I know him by another name,” says the stranger. This time the words are serious, unamused. Scorpius even suspects them to be slightly reverential.
Harry had not prepared himself for the man he’s faced with, nothing abstract about the sharp lines of his stomach or the sharp slant of his smile or the crooked twist of his eyebrows. Harry is falling, fast and hard and irrevocably in love.
“I think I’ll stay the night here, if you don’t mind,” he drawls, and Potter’s eyes flash at the thwarted opportunity to have the last word. “I’d ask you to spend it with me, but seeing as you just broke it off between us, toodle-oo, Potter. Off you go.”
‘How could I forget?’ Harry asks, looking into Draco’s eyes, which flutter shut when Harry’s breath ghosts over his mouth.
“I saved you,” Potter says bluntly. “Over and over. The flames. Begging all those corresponding testimonies off of Hermione and Ron and Ginny. Dean and Luna were more than willing, but some of the people whose memories are included in your Pensieve were less than willing to help a bloke who called them names all throughout school, hexed them in the hallways, turned them over to Umbridge. My testimony itself, though more than one person objected to me standing up for you.”
Draco buries his face in his hands. “I don’t know,” he says, and wonders if he sounds as woefully inadequate to Potter as he does to himself. “I don’t know, but I’m assuming something and I shouldn’t. I don’t know what it is, yet.”
“I’ll open the dor justa prove ya wrong,” Harry says gleefully. A few seconds and some crashes later, the door creaks open. Harry blearily blinks into the light and rubs his eyes vigorously. “An’ now I’m seein’ things,” he says mournfully. He sways and instinctively Draco reaches out to support him. With his hand around his waist, Draco takes in the sight of Harry. A three-day diet of alcohol has darkened the hollows under his eyes and his skin is pallid. He looks awful and reeks of whisky and yet the confused, bewildered man in his arms is the most beautiful sight Draco has ever witnessed.
When the Sobering Potion begins to course through his veins, the burning sensation first tingles slightly and then begins to hurt. It is mighty unpleasant and he fails to hide his wince while he feels the contents of his stomach rising to his throat, cleansing his blood of the alcohol remnants.
“Keep going,” Draco grits out.
He opens his eyes and instead of seeing Harry doing something with his own self for Draco’s viewing pleasure as he had hoped he would, he finds Harry staring open mouthed at his exposed chest, gripping his shirt with both hands and looking so shocked that Draco winces at his own stupidity.
Draco swallows and nods. “But I… But I…” He doesn’t know how to frame it in a way that doesn’t make him sound either ungrateful or somehow delirious. “I don’t have to go back to Azkaban?”
“An apology, Granger, surely you know what it means?”
There is an altar, and Draco, who has never seen the point of religion, finally understands the merit of worship.
There should be a clean change in the closet. Hopefully.
“What do you want?” Draco asks, quiet and soothing. “Tell me what you want?”
“Lavender’s dead,” Harry says, the words weighted and heavy on his uncooperative tongue. Parvati blinks.
THE END.
Harry laughs. It’s weak, barely there, but it’s genuine. “It’s four in the afternoon.”
The woman raises her eyebrows pointedly. Draco smirks. “It is rather hot,” he says, gesturing to the fire.
“Oh, thank Merlin!” She says before turning back to Weasley and pulling him to her chest. He is completely unresponsive but Draco thinks it is more for her own benefit than Weasley’s.
The moment shatters when he blinks, a sharp jolt into reality. Harry’s parted lips shift into a smirk and with a whispered spell, his hand is slick with lube.
“This morning,” Harry says. “She left last night, came over to give them to me today morning.”
Harry’s laugh is bright and Draco wonders if this is how it feels to be an object in orbit.
“What?” Scorpius asks, unnerved when the unblinking stare has been directed at him for far too long. Sometimes they seem more snake than person. They’re neither, but it’s eerie either way to never know what precisely it is you’re looking at. Scorpius had always thought a face was a face, even under glamour charms or Polyjuice. It was still something underneath it all. This seems to genuinely be an unsettling mirage without any underlying reality. “Did I say something wrong?”
“The Curse did hit you,” he gasps, shocked. “It hit you right in the chest but when my mother was asked to check if you were dead, you weren’t. You weren’t dead.” He grips Harry tighter, not knowing if what he is saying should even be possible. “You survived Avada Kedavra twice.”
‘I have to say,’ Draco drawls, when they finally step inside, ‘you know how to apologise.’
Harry draws off immediately, a worried glint entering his eye.
“But she’s at the Manor, isn’t she?”
do you–”
“Touché.”
“What about it?” He asks Potter, keeping his eyes on the books he can see behind Potter’s head.
Potter isn’t in the mood for subtlety, Draco realises and furtively glances around the library for Granger.
Before he touches it, he draws his wand to check for underlying hexes meant to set off on intruders, sure that at least a couple nasty ones are lying in wait for him. He remembers an exclusive in the Daily Prophet on Voldemort’s Headquarters, details about the Manor that had apparently fascinated the people, something about the gates contorting into a face that asked questions, about select people being able to pass through the wrought iron gates like they were smoke. When none of that happens, Harry cautiously casts a Detection Charm on the gates. But when he swipes the wand through the air, only a red shower of sparks erupt and die away.
to be
Lovegood arrives by their table, a serene smile in place, blonde hair twisted up on her head, the edges of the owl feather earrings she’s wearing brushing her bare shoulders.
He looks around, taking note of the way the bed is still mostly done, as though Harry has spent the night here, but has not bothered to rest.
Harry learns to suck Draco off.
He looks up at her, sees her face tight with concern and fear and numbly says, “Draco kissed me.”
When Draco speaks, his voice is raspy. ‘I do think it might have missed something.’ He runs a hand up the side of Harry’s bare arm and asks in a low undertone, ‘Do you think you might still be… interested?’
Potter shakes his head. “I was here when I heard you come up the stairs.”
. This is supposed to make me
He peers at Granger through his lashes, expected a reprimand or a glare but instead, she barely looks up from her list of ingredients that she’s printing on a fresh sheet of parchment. For a moment Draco thinks she hasn’t heard.
It’s an act, Harry realises the second Malfoy’s eyes rove over the crowd and settle on him. Behind the blankness of his mask is the terrified boy Harry is here to defend, the one who stepped into a lake of blind loyalty for his parents without knowing how to swim. There’s something pleading and desperate in that gaze, and Harry’s heart unwillingly clenches. He’s not here to be emotional, he’s here to do what’s right, but Malfoy’s grey eyes full of desperate defiance snaps the thin boundary between the two.
“Good.”
. You think you’re the only one who understands those things? You think anyone is fucking fine after the damn War?”
At the trial, he’d been too preoccupied with the thoughts of returning to Azkaban and the sheer surprise of having Potter champion his defence. Now, as he watches Potter make his way back to their table in the corner, drinks balanced on a tray, Draco can’t help but think he’s missed something significant.
The other side effect was that he could only bring himself to shag blokes of size. Draco hadn’t shagged a man who weighed less than 200 pounds since he had been at Hogwarts. There was something about a man with a belly and a fat arse that really just did it for Draco.
“I want what you want, Dray. I’m here no matter what,” Harry had said simply, and the matter had been settled. Their arrangement would be up in the air when it came to Draco, and Harry was okay with it. He had to hope that there would be more food and fuck in their future. He had no choice, really, but to hope. And the last two months had left them too breathlessly busy to think about the widening of the Malfoy.
Draco laid on the couch for a few moments more, listening as the water in the master bath started up. He suddenly felt inexplicably vulnerable, his naked body feeling sticky and full and queasy and
When they were done they were both sweaty and sticky, and breathing heavily. They stared at each other, a distinct gleam in both mens’ eyes. For a moment, neither of them knew what to say. They had a large, empty house at their disposal, a huge comfortable bed, and they’d chosen to jerk each other off against the wall in the living room, like a couple of teenagers. Neither of them could pinpoint why it had happened that way; why their first sexual encounter with Draco’s newly formed belly, a belly that he’d grown on accident over a stressful two month period, had been so immature.
Draco thought evilly as he looked at his thick rear end.
, Harry couldn’t deny the ripple of joy that pulsed through him.
“You like this?” Harry growled, a devilish smile on his face as he pushed himself into Draco insistently. He was so full, but
His name had been Max, and they’d been in a pre-med class on Wizard Anatomy together. It was the autumn after his graduation from Hogwarts, and Draco had been going through a dry spell in the romance department for more than a year. Nothing had felt right, immediately after the War, and he’d been too focused on his future. He hadn’t intended on falling for anyone, instead choosing to focus on his first post-secondary classes. And then Max had walked into the classroom.
. He felt as though he’d blended in his whole life and now he would stick out. He felt disconnected from himself and yet, at the same time, he felt so very present. He didn’t know what was going on, or why he was feeling this way.
Harry and Draco explore this new dynamic, and Draco reflects on what these changes mean.
, he supposed. It didn’t bulge, or sag, or anything of the sort. But it would soon, he reasoned. He was already starting to round out, and he supposed another ten pounds would do it.
It was true. Draco Malfoy was now the proud owner of his own belly. He could no longer consider himself merely thickened or pudgy. This belly of his was still small enough that it didn’t sag. It was just there, small and unassuming, something you might not pay much attention to if you saw Draco dressed smartly in a suit or his robes. But it was there, and it hadn’t been a couple of months ago. Harry reached underneath Draco’s tight shirt and stroked it. It was soft and flabby, and it jiggled as Harry fiddled with it.
He wonders if Draco is doing the same thing in his own head, as he looks down at Harry. If Harry tilted his head to the side, he could press his forehead against Draco’s knuckles. He’d like to. Harry hears the bedsheets rustle as Draco shifts his weight onto one arm, laying the hand closest to Harry’s head out palm down on the bed. He extends his fingers slowly, one by one, as if stretching them, each action deliberate and measured. Harry feels impossibly aware of how close they are to touching him, each movement of Draco’s hand almost ghosting across his skin. The room is so quiet he can make out each of Draco’s soft breaths. He’s suddenly aware that he’s holding his own.
Draco’s room is only a door or so down from Harry’s, a short walk during which Draco doesn’t let go of Harry’s fingers, pulling him along. Draco’s room is darker than the guest room he put Harry in, and Harry makes a surprised noise when he steps onto plush carpet.
Harry manages a sort of grimacey face back at him. “Wait, we’re coup― case number seven?” Harry asks, incredulous. His head is
“Yes, excellent. Good boy, Potter. You can have one of Nettle’s liver treats, if you fancy.” Draco smirks at Harry briefly, before turning away to pull out his wand and cast a few spells to freshen up the bed linens.
Potter looks utterly dead on his feet. Exhaustion radiates from him, the kind of bone-deep weariness that Draco isn’t used to feeling physically anymore. He still feels it mentally, though.
"Shhh." He waves his hands like he’s swatting a bee. "Don’t say the B word, don’t jinx me."
Change sucks. Being an adult is hard. Harry is so glad he has nice people around him to swear at him and like him even when he can’t do things for them, and to let him weep on their casual business attire.
Harry breathes out harshly on a laugh. He swallows, every inch of him wanting to turn his face into Draco's cupped hand. "Never been great at rules," Harry croaks.
"―Harryyy―"
Draco shrugged. “Worth it. Besides, it’s good practice for when the baby comes and neither of us ever, ever sleep again.” He ended in an ominous whisper, and Harry choked out a laugh.
Her name is Darya. She is deceptively difficult to find, this person Potter is looking for. Draco owes favours now, which is not uncommon, but these sound like
"Draco thinks I should write my autobiography," Harry says once they’re settled. He sips his tea and makes a face when he gets a mouth full of leaves. Fucking worst strainer in England.
“It’s okay,” Harry says, shooting Draco a small half-smile. They lapse back into silence before Harry slowly lowers his head to rest on Draco’s shoulder. It’s a careful and measured move, and very deliberate. Draco lets his breath out in a rush, before he tilts his head, lets his cheek rest against the top of Harry’s head. His hair is soft against Draco’s cheek and his fingers are warm against Draco’s skin, and it’s the most comforting thing. Draco shuts his eyes and enjoys it, warm and safe in a place that should be exactly the opposite.
"I told you I was shit at this bit," Draco replies, voice low. His hands are on each of Harry’s hips, slipping around to his back. He fiddles with the hem of Harry’s jeans, fingers in the belt loops. The movement pulls Harry ever so lightly closer, belly to belly.
“Check the time yourself, you lazy sod. There’s a clock on the wall just there.” Draco raises his eyebrows and nods, pointing in the direction of the clock with the rolled up parchment.
unique pain in the fucking arse.
Harry breathes in deeply, watches goosebumps rise along Draco's skin as he breathes out again. "I want to kiss you," he manages, the words mostly a breathless jumble against Draco's arm. Draco understands him well enough, though.
Draco lets his lips curl into a sneer. "So I am." He takes a mouthful of his drink, lets the bitter Campari roll around his tongue as he fights to regain some composure. "And what are you?"
Harry shakes his head, gently so as not to dislodge Draco's hand. "Nothing I didn't already feel."
It's…a really simple pattern.
sleep, will you? Definitely not creepy at all." Potter’s smile has turned cheeky as he pulls down the covers in order to get under them. The thick, dark curtains in Draco’s bedroom, as well as the charms on them, completely blot out the rising sun, and the lamp on Draco’s side table casts only the scantest light. The room is quite dark, but Draco can see Potter’s expression well enough. "I’d much rather you sleep with me, if those are the two options."
Still.
"Maybe Jaffa Cakes, I’m sure I bought some the other day, they were on offer―"
Draco makes a cut off, startled sound that deepens out into a low groan as Harry shoots inside his mouth. He swallows as best he can, breathing harshly through his nose and with his eyes shut, his brow furrowed in concentration as he works his own cock over. Harry can feel it, the rush of Draco's pleasure crashing into the back of Harry's, making what feels like an endless wave. Harry presses the heels of his hands against his eyes as Draco lets Harry's cock slip from his lips. Draco chokes down a breath, nuzzling against the crease of Harry's thigh as he comes with a low, muffled sound. Harry's spent cock twitches, overstimulated and almost sore as he feels Draco's orgasm course through him. His head spins.
"You know what I was doing," Draco says after a moment. His voice is soft and low, his cheeks flushed pink. He's so pale, Harry thinks, that he never gets quite red when he blushes, just goes pink all over instead. Harry wants to press his thumbs against Draco's skin, watch the flush fade to white and then spring back again. "Don't you, Harry?" Draco leans closer, so close and yet not touching Harry at all.
Harry spreads his legs slightly, sighing as he works himself over. He rests his free hand against the cool glass shower wall once more, leaving a smear of sweet-smelling lotion in his wake. Peppermint, Harry realises, the same scent he's smell before on Draco's skin when Harry's leant close to read a document over his shoulder or sling an arm around him in the pub. He bites his lip, a low moan slipping out as he grips himself tighter.
Draco doesn't dance, but this is not dancing.
He’s been in Prague for just shy of two months now on his most recent case. He’s not ashamed to say that the first thing he did when he arrived was to find out the best places for those of his kind. It always pays to know the safe spots, beyond just where the general wizarding community can be found. The banks, the bars, the places it’s safe to be openly into other men, the places it’s safe to be openly inhuman. Draco’s hardly vulnerable, but he’s aware that he could be. Should someone follow him home, should there be threats upon the small Blood Suppositories set up across Europe to keep his kind in fresh donated blood without endangering anyone. At least that's what they're supposed to do; any vampire worth their salt will admit it does nothing to stop the craving for a fresh vein. That's why people hate creatures like him so much. It's only natural.
He slips both hands lower, over Harry’s hips and just above the curve of Harry’s arse. He tugs him closer, his thigh bumping up against Harry’s hardening prick. "Uh huh," he says cheekily, as Harry sucks in a gasp. "This is slow?"
There’s a moment before Draco replies.
Harry blinks, taking Draco’s words in. "I died once," he says after a moment, shrugging one shoulder.
Draco lifts one shoulder again in the same self-assured gesture. "I seem it because I am. Whoever, or whatever it is, I can find them," he repeats. "It's what I do."
This, Harry reasons, is why he’s never going to get over his crush. With a sense of deep, deep lack of self-preservation, he sends three kisses back, and then sticks his phone under a chair cushion so he won’t be tempted to stare at it longingly for the entire afternoon.
He doesn’t know much about Horcruxes, really, only the basics, uncovered from the darkest tomes in his father’s private library. There was no mention of there being more than one, though, or what they were. Draco feels deep apprehension at the idea of Voldemort having split his soul so many times—even more so the implication that he made one unintentionally. He listens intently to Potter’s every, quiet word.
It seems like a bigger admission than it is, and Harry shuts his eyes against the fondness he sees on Draco's face. When he opens them, he looks down at Draco's wrist. He can see the pale blue lines of his veins, the ropey stretch of tendons. There's something vulnerable about this place, Harry thinks, where the skin seems so thin. He opens his mouth, lets his breath gust over Draco’s wrist. Draco’s fingers press more tightly against the soft hair at the back of Harry's head.
Draco's fingers inside him suddenly feel like too much, but Harry rides it out, letting Draco finish before he tries to shift away. There's nowhere for him to go, really, when they're this close and Harry's half off the bed and uncoordinated to boot, so all he manages to do is jostle Draco slightly. Harry gives up, lies still and tries to catch his breath. Draco’s own breathing is coming out in a damp, uneven rush against the crease of Harry’s thigh.
And then it all goes to shit.
stop doing things."
Something flashes in Potter’s eyes, and he looks away. Draco doesn’t know what the expression is. "The people who matter know where I’ve been." Potter’s voice is soft but his expression surly. He sounds a little guilty, and extremely defiant. Draco quickly looks away before bringing his drink to his lips. He struggles to swallow his mouthful.
The man frowns as he mulls Draco's words over. Soon enough, he leans back, clearly satisfied with the dreadfully obvious code they've supplied.
The smoking man spits as Draco strides past him, but Draco doesn't take it personally. It appears to be more that this man is just revolting, and not that he's taken issue with Draco in particular. Small blessings, really.
Harry only really registered that he’d screamed that in Draco’s stunned face once he was done, which did make him realise he was reacting a little more animatedly than he usually would. It had taken him another hour to apologise to Draco about it, but he suspected that was actually some kind of record between them in terms of making up; they were both capable of a mean sulk, and Draco was reigning king of the silent treatment, as was decreed after the great Christmas Brussel Sprout debacle of 2002. (It wasn’t Harry’s fault he forgot them, honestly, there was no need for Draco to cause such a stink about it, since when does Christmas cheer depend on the sodding
“Shit, let me sort you ―” Draco tried to move his hand between them to grip Harry’s prick, but Harry stopped him, pulling Draco’s hand to land on the bed beside his head. Harry was
Draco already knows he’s got him.
At first, Harry sees nothing. The sky is dark, pinpricks of stars glittering faintly. They’re easier to see here than in London, and it’s a clear night anyway. Harry’s about to tease Draco for staring up at the stars like a spooked dog when there’s nothing there, just a vast stretch of barren nothing to rival even the marshland in front of them, when finally, he sees it.
, he explained while gesturing at his left forearm and the pale serpentine scar etched along it. Harry’s own body is mottled with scars from the past, too, on his chest and hand and forehead. They make a nice pair, Harry supposes, with their blemished and tarnished bodies―all these marks that cover them. Harry wants to put his mouth over every single one on Draco’s skin.
Harry laughs again, quieter this time. He feels Draco lean back a little against his knee. “So we’re doing this, then?” Harry lets his smile turk cheeky. “Even if the sex is shit without the bond?”
Harry gets home from his meeting with Aggie at roughly 2pm, after having sat in her office for nearly three hours.
Well, he does two things monumental, really. First of all, after a strong mug of tea and a pep talk, he de-cobwebs the bike in the garden shed, greases the chain and evicts several spiders from the wicker basket so that he can take Cat to the vets and find out if she really is looking for a home, or just fancies her freedom and the odd outdoor shit. He even finds a helmet, and cleans it up, before deciding not to wear it because he looks like enough of a dickhead and it doesn’t fit properly over his hair. The thought is there, though.
for it, like he’s done this a hundred times and is grateful to be doing it again. His hands grip at Draco’s hips as he swallows him down enthusiastically, bobbing his head in increasing fast movements. He doesn’t take Draco down fully, but it’s close, and it’s
Obviously they would expect Draco to have a contact number. God, he probably even has a bank account. A receipt book.
where Harry has always excelled.
His heart sinks into his stomach and right out of his arse into the floor and the molten core of the earth as he reads what Drunk Harry has sent to Draco.
"Yeah, I guess so." Harry finds himself oddly excited by the prospect―that there’s still more of Draco to know.
Harry purses his lips then wrinkles his nose. "Fine. Gross. If you are really a person, then that’s quite rude, just so you know." Harry sighs, turning back to his typewriter. He all but dives on his phone for the distraction when it vibrates next to him.
"Either," he responds, the word hitting Draco in a rush. Potter looks Draco up and down. His gaze lingers, pointed in the way it travels from his thighs to his midriff, over the plane of his material-clad stomach and back over his chest, his neck, his lips. He feels it like it's a caress.
At midday Harry notices that Draco hasn't messaged him yet, which is definitely weird. At the time, he thinks nothing of it and just puts it down to timezones or Boggarts or any number of other things that might be occupying Draco’s time. When he opens their text chain, though, ready to fire off the usual
“So you did.” Draco smiles at Harry, head tilted down as he continues rubbing at his eye like an overtired toddler. He doesn’t answer the question, just as Harry didn’t either. His smile lingers though, and he doesn’t look away as he reaches for the doorknob and then gestures for Harry to enter.
"Shit, yes, like that." Harry can barely breathe around how good it feels when Draco holds his fingers in place again, curling them up to massage his prostate once more. Heat pools at the base of Harry's spine and between his hips as Draco moves his fingers back and forth in small increments, bumping up against the bundle of nerves inside Harry again and again. Harry struggles to stay still, his mind growing fuzzy at the edge. All of his attention is focussed on the growing heat between his hips, the feels of Draco's fingers around his cock and inside him as Draco works him over.
Harry looks down at the text on the parchment. It glitters at him briefly before settling across the page in a line of dark, cursive letters.
, and he thinks Harry will like it, ergo Harry is going to grin like an idiot and then flush himself down the toilet later on for being a ridiculous sap.
"Have what?"
Harry snorts a laugh. "There really isn’t much to talk about. But by all means"—he gestures at the nearly empty jug—"ply away." He sighs at Ginny’s unimpressed look, then shrugs. "There really isn’t. I’ve written nothing, I’ve got a meeting with Aggie in two days to finally admit I’ve got nothing and beg for more time, and in the meantime, I’ve maybe got a thing for Malfoy but he’s in a different country and we never see each other in person these days so fuck knows if it’s, like, mutual, and anyway I’m not going to bring it up and make things weird, so." Harry shrugs again, face red and heart a bit sore. He takes a swig of his drink, polishing it off. "Like I said, nothing much to talk about," he finishes lamely.
"Harry." Draco’s chair creaks as he stands up.
―as it does to him, but then again, Potter's kisses are hot, deep and real. His hands clutch at Draco's hips, bringing him closer, and Draco shamelessly sighs into it. He's past caring. It's too loud in here, anyway; no one can hear him, and if they did, Draco doesn't think they'd bat an eyelid. They hardly stand out here. There are a myriad of lustful couples scattering the dancefloor, the corners of the room. It's glorious. Draco loves blending in, being an anonymous part of a crowd. It's a novel feeling these days.
“Want, yep,” Harry finished for him, “Now, more fucking, less talking, there’s a good boy.”
Potter smiles ever so slightly. He moves to mirror Draco's posture, turning until they're both facing each other. The movement is languid. Around them, the club churns. People talk, drink, dance. Draco is barely aware of them, pulled into the vortex of Potter's intense gaze.
"Think about it," Draco says. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out an inky black pen, and looking around for something to write on. There’s nothing. Potter’s coaster is stark black, and therefore useless, and Draco didn’t bring his notepad. The pen is habit; the notepad is work. He chews his lower lip, pulling the cap of the pen off and exposing the silver nib. Impulsively, he gestures with two fingers towards Potter’s bare arm, then mimes writing with the pen. Potter is wearing a dark denim jack, a grey top underneath. The sleeves are rolled up to expose his forearms. He frowns at Draco, obstinately confused. After a moment, he extends one arm anyway with a slow reluctance.
Draco turns to Harry, the impact of his annoyed glare somewhat softened by the bags under his eyes and the fact that his hair is still, frankly, a huge mess.
"Yes." Draco dares to step closer still. "Drink with me, Harry?" They're close enough now to share a breath.
“I.” Draco licks his lips, his heartbeat thumping in his ears. “I just keep picking at it.” It’s an astoundingly edited version of the truth, and he doesn’t want to say why. He’ll probably throw up if Harry asks. He expects Harry has figured it out anyway, if he’s astute enough to notice Draco’s habit. Harry’s nowhere near as oblivious to what’s going on around him as he seems. Draco knows this, but it always catches him unawares anyway.
"Shit, I have to―I'm going to―" Draco suddenly pulls the hand on Harry's cock away, replacing it with his mouth. He's out of breath, in no better state than Harry as he slips his now free hand between his own legs. He groans, deep and relieved, around Harry's cock. Harry shuts his eyes, his mind whiting out as Draco sucks at the head of his cock as best he can while gasping at the reverberating pleasure between them himself. His fingers remain sure as they massage up against Harry's prostate. Harry's mouth falls open on a silent gasp.
knew it, too. "I’m not having a go at you about it, honest. Really. I just." She puts her arm around his, her small hand gripping his bicep. Her fingers are cool from holding her Bellini, and her nails press in gently as she squeezes. "I feel like…maybe you put off doing it, and stayed in something you didn’t like because you felt like you had to. And maybe you’re doing that with your book? Because you’re stuck but you don’t think you can say no to doing it." Harry squirms a little in his chair, his face hot and his chest tight. He nods after a while, for her to go on and also because she’s hitting a nerve. He thinks she might be right.
Potter laughs genuinely this time. Draco can’t ignore the thrill that gives him.
Harry's handwriting has gone to utter shit in his surprise.
“Hi.” Draco steps into the room, then backwards again as he closes the door behind him. He leans against it. “Are you just sitting here in the dark, Potter?” he queries softly.
Around them, the bar has picked up steam, the music growing louder and the conversation of the patrons getting rowdier with it. Draco clears his throat. "So what do you want from me, then?"
“Yeah, it was,” agrees Harry, and he means it.
"I want an explanation," he responds. As Potter’s expression turns confused, Draco goes on. "You’re not going to give me a straight answer about why you’re here, fine, but I want
knows it, the parasitic force that transformed him three years ago is more than fucking aware that it has been sated. He wants it, though.
And then Draco wasn't human anymore.
Draco." Agatha smirks, and Harry rolls his eyes.
Draco finally takes a sip, then closes his eyes as he sighs, pleased. Harry watches for a moment, Draco’s breath fogging out in front of him through pink lips. Harry follows the trace of steam back to the curve of Draco’s lips, then quickly looks away when Draco’s eyes blink open.
"Fuck," Draco mumbles after a moment, mouth pressed tight against Harry’s shoulder. Harry can feel the heat of his breath through the material.
His hands slip down to Potter’s neck to cup his jaw and tilt his head the way he wants. Potter lets himself be led, kissing Draco for a long and tender moment before eventually they both let the kiss taper out. The sounds of the bathroom around them, of the chatter of people outside and occasional bursts of raucous laughter, the conversations happening in a language Draco doesn’t speak, slowly filters back into his awareness. The music is still the same thump of bass, the interminable heartbeat of the dancefloor. In front of him, Potter’s eyes are heavy-lidded, his cheeks still flush with blood and his lips that perfect bruised colour. His hair is a tangled mess from Draco’s wandering fingers. Draco can’t define the emotion that surges inside him at the sight, the feeling that swells as he looks at Potter’s face. He can’t deny it either, though.
The therapist he went to called it a lot of different things, but Harry still thinks it boils down to that in the end; he just wasn’t sure how to be still, or okay, or not expect a stab of pain in his forehead and peril at his door.
This time Draco’s laugh ended on a groan. “God, you’re ridiculous.” Draco thrust in hard, then stayed there, rolling his hips before pulling back and picking up the pace again. Harry managed a strangled “Mmhmm”, before he shut his eyes, breathing out harshly through his nose and trying to get a grip. He was meant to be making Draco come first, not getting off himself, bloody hell. Fat lot of good it would be with both of them having taken the potion if Harry blew his load before he even got Draco on his stomach, and
As expected, Draco finds the paper dry when he accepts it. Potter looks almost relieved to be handing it over, a tension draining out of his shoulders. His expression remains wary, however. Draco wants to open the folder, to devour all of its secrets, but he doesn't want to do it in front of Potter just now.
It takes more than a bite to make a vampire, Draco knows this. Draco can bite all of London, take a sip from everyone he can lay his teeth on, and they will be as vampiric afterwards as the cucumber slice Draco just petulantly bit into. That's not how this works.
“Show off,” Draco said fondly as he flipped the paper at Harry. It fluttered to the floor and he crowded Harry up against the bathroom sink. “Had to steal the limelight didn’t you,” he muttered gently, eyes shining and bright as he smiled, kissing Harry's cheek, his jaw, his temple.
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco surmises as Harry settles his back against the log (not as bad as settling his arse on it, he finds. He rests his shoulder just against Draco’s calf, too, trying to steal a little warmth. There’s a low-level warming charm on their hideout, but it’s far from keeping them toasty, as such. Too much magic will give off a tangible and easily discernible trace for savvy criminals, rendering their surveillance moot. All they’ve got allowance for on this trip is a mild concealment charm, a Muffliato for their voices, and a heating charm that should ideally save them from hypothermia considering it’s just gone midnight and it’s February. Draco’s the one who’s cast the charms, and Harry basks a little in the tingling, misty feeling of his magic. There’s always something jumpy about Draco’s magic, his spells, as if they’re brimming with energy and excitement. Harry likes it.
“We had sex last night,” Draco states abruptly. The bluntness of it startles a laugh out of Harry.
Draco exchales thickly, pushes his hair away from his clammy forehead. He inspects his right hand under the low dorm light, then clenches his jaw. There’s blood under the fingernails, and his arm aches. The scratches along it are long and deep and the new scab has been pulled away. It’s no surprise, but Draco groans with frustration all the same; sleep, he just wants to
Potter manages a weak but genuine smile at that. "Well, you can’t sleep on the floor either," he counters, kneeling up onto the bed.
“I feel I need to point out,” he kissed gently over Harry’s Adam’s apple, “that this is the most Gryffindor approach to conception that could possibly exist.”
In the few months that Draco has pulled down most of his defences, Harry had forgotten just how viciously defensive most Slytherins are. “What’s it to you?” Parkinson asks, stressing her vowels so hard she sounds more snake than human. “Am I not allowed to visit my best friend?”
“Of course,” Harry whispers, pulling him closer. “And you should know I’m already seeing one.”
When they ask him how he pleads, Draco wets his dry lips with a shaking tongue and says, “Guilty.”
Draco is a little taken aback. He doesn’t know how to respond so he defaults to, “When you write back, do wish them a hearty—”
There’s a tightness in Draco’s throat and a tell-tale wetness on his lashes, but he finds himself unable to even lift a hand to wipe it off. Instead his hands drift to the bruises on his lips, on the sides of his neck, on his thighs, and press in, a reminder of what Draco had and lost.
“I almost ruined it for you!” he gasps.
Harry laughs, and fuck, that laugh with the grating edge of his sore throat sounds huskier and lovelier than it has any right to.
“Draco…” Harry begins, and his voice sounds small, far away. “You’ll let me know if you need any… signatures, yes?”
When they walk into the Great Hall side by side, there’s complete silence for a couple of seconds before everyone picks up where they left off. Eyes follow Potter as he walks over to the Gryffindor table and for the first time, some eyes follow him as he makes his way over to Slytherin.
“Did the blood you shed not appeal to that posh palate?” someone asks. Draco looks up and Ginevra Weasley is fixing him with a cold, dead-eyed look.
Harry obliges him, sliding the tip of his finger into Draco’s clenching hole. The intrusion burns something fierce, but it’s the sort of burn Draco enjoys with every fibre of his being. Every cell of him screams for more and every heartbeat rings true to the rhythm of Harry’s name.
Seemingly noticing her for the first time, Draco eventually turns to Hermione still standing in the doorway. “Something you wanted?”
The pain comes back with the third one but there’s more pleasure than Draco could have thought possible before this. He gasps and moans and arches and squirms until Harry takes his other hand and holds his hip firmly in place. “You’re going to stop moving if you want me to not hurt you,” he says in warning.
“Malfoy,” Potter’s voice is quiet. “Take it.”
“Lovegood?” Malfoy says. “Are you quite insane? She was imprisoned in the Manor’s cellars for so long I lost track. I’ll be lucky if she doesn’t hex me six ways from Sunday the minute she sees me.”
She looks at him and her face softens slightly. The harsh lines of her clenched jaw smooth out and Harry sees she has creases on her forehead from frowning too much. She moves towards him slowly and when her hand brushes his cheek, he leans into the familiarity of her touch.
Hermione sits up straight. “That shouldn’t be a problem. There are Healers at Mungo’s willing to be discreet–”
Red eyes. Red lights. Red, thick blood pooling around the raised lines of the Dark Mark. Red pride and red passion, whirling, whirling, whirling into red shame.
Draco shakes his head. Tries to say that it’s alright. That he doesn’t mind.
them do this to themselves. Please.
“Then why stay?”
‘Hey,’ Harry says, when their chests are almost touching, pushing all the earnestness he feels into his words, hoping his eyes show Draco the love he feels, the way his heart is breaking open at the look on Draco’s face. ‘You’re the only one. You’ve always been the only one.’
He doesn’t turn over, but he can imagine it, Potter silhouetted in the doorway, moonlight glinting off his spectacles, face contorted in an angry scowl, words berating Draco for his cowardice ready on his lips.
The stars he was named for, the stars he died by.
Hermione gives him a look that causes him to pause in the stroking of her hair. “For someone who wanted Malfoy thrown out of the house less than a week ago, you sure are pretty insistent on me meeting him.”
“You’d do that?”
For three days he has had Malfoy on his mind, a continuous, uncomfortable nagging that something isn’t right. Every day Hermione greets him in the morning with a meaningful look in her eye and he returns it with a pleading one in his. She shakes her head looking slightly exasperated before she goes back to the plate of food before her and whatever book she has with her just then. Ron, who probably heard about the Kitchen Debacle from Hermione shoots him a sympathetic look each time before concentrating on his breakfast or rather what appears to be
They stare at each other. Draco’s sure he looks like a blinking fool, with his confusion evident all over his face. Potter looks strangely upset.
She shrugs. “Not really but I think you deserve to know.”
“So did I.”
He pretends her surprised delight doesn’t make him feel more alive than he has in months.
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that.
Harry understands exactly what he meant by hallucinations.
“What?” Draco asks, confused.
She takes a moment but eventually nods. “It’s just,” she points vaguely at the two of them in the bed, “you look so happy and you’ve sorted it all out and Harry, I, all I even want to see anymore–” she takes a deep breath, “All I even want for you anymore is hope this lasts while you sort out the other things.”
“I wish I could say the same,” she says seriously, without even a hint of mocking in her tone. Harry knows if it was anyone else, he would be offended but this is Luna. And Luna is always, always honest. Even when it hurts.
‘Fuck, Harry,’ Draco whimpers and his grey irises are engulfed in black.
Are you sure?
She looks pensive for a minute and then says, ‘There’s always Ron?”
He grits his teeth at the sensation of
“Roooooon? Wanna drink, may- moo- I mean, I mean, mateee?”
Clutching Harry’s letter in his hand, he wills his crumbling mind to Apparate him to where he knows Harry will be, hoping to hell that the goodbye note wasn’t a suicide letter.
Draco snorts, Hermione groans and Slughorn enters right at that moment, bustling around in his robes that are better suited as a nightgown.
They sit like that for a minute until they hear heels clicking on the staircase. Healer Choudhury steps in, assesses the wreckage that used to be a room and clicks her tongue. “Draco, why don’t you take Hermione and go downstairs while I see to Ron?”
He thinks of his mother. Thinks of her in her French villa, creating tapestries and tending to the rose garden. When she had told him she was leaving, her hand clutching at the delicate pearls set against her delicate throat, he hadn’t even put up token resistance. He loved her but she needed more than an empty house with too many memories. Draco knows she wants him to live with her, wants him to move to France and do his Potions mastery there. A fresh start.
, waiting for men in their early forties to die. I’ll be bloody lucky if it isn’t two! I can’t–” he says, swallowing, “I can’t just
They shake their head. “I couldn’t.”
It’s Harry’s turn to groan. “Merlin, fine,” he concedes. “Talk. What do you want to say?”
Hermione leans back against the back of the chair, looking relieved.
Sometimes, when dying, watching birds alight on his windowsill and feelings his fathers hands in his hair, he used to feel like a Muggle clock whose minute hand had stopped working. Going by that metaphor, he can say with unfortunate certainty that the hour hand too has finally given up on telling the time.
“India,” Harry clarifies. “We said before we came that we’d spend six months here and six months there. But I… am not ready. And if I don’t give myself a timeline, I doubt I ever will.”
my son suggested, this was possibly the least inappropriate.”
Rome is an oil painting, vibrant and bold, an experience in existence, history binding its cobblestones tight. They take long walks through the streets at night, the warm glow of the lampposts turning the sidewalks golden. It feels like a different era and Harry finds himself patting down his pockets for errant time-turners.
Malfoy pauses. His hands are stuffed into the pockets of his trench coat, pale wrists a sliver of vulnerability between the unforgiving stretches of dark fabric. The line of his back is rigid and tense, as though Harry’s words have triggered dual responses within him, his body and his mind pulling in opposite directions as he struggles to settle on one. He looks like something out of a historical fiction graphic novel, the ominously flickering lights of the alley throwing his profile into dramatic shadows. He turns partway to look over his shoulder without straining his neck at an awkward angle and Harry recognises the light of curious concern in his partially visible eyes.
When he’s done, Harry’s mouth slides off in an exquisite pull and staring up at Draco through hooded eyes that used to be green but have now become a blown shade of brownish black outlined with a circle of forest green, he wipes away a stray dribble of come from the side of his face with the back of his hand.
Draco’s lips are swollen and heavy from all the kissing they’ve done today and the blowjob he gave Harry earlier  where Harry lost control and gripped his neck and fucked his mouth. Draco had moaned through the whole thing, unbuttoning his own pants to slip a hand in to relieve the pressure on his own cock. It  had been wild and hot and heavy the way it hasn’t been since they were twenty six and rutting themselves dry in a night club.
And then there’s the one that Draco doesn’t know how to feel about.
Six letters.
have. I don’t know why you’re still alive Malfoy, when—when—but you don’t deserve to be.”
“Of course!” She responds immediately.
“I think we got quite a bit of it done, though,” she says, critically eyeing her own parchment which is almost full. “I have about seven inches left to write.”
“I think that might be true.”
The door opens and a dishevelled, rumpled Harry steps out with a disgruntled expression, “I told you, ‘Mione I’m not going to go, he doesn’t want to see– oh! Draco!”
His question is answered when Harry says, “Shut the fuck up.”
Scorpius smiles.
He has never been able to admire arrogance, but there is a quiet reverence in Malfoy’s gaze as he sweeps it over the marble steps and the stained glass of the upper storey windows that renders him speechless as he watches. The villa is indeed something, but Malfoy on his terrain, comfortable and kingly is something else entirely.
“I wasn’t married before, Draco. I was in Hogwarts and horny.”
“It is not a secret that the Dark Lord divided his soul into Horcruxes. Hermione Granger and I have revealed this to the press prior to this hearing. I was… in touch with one of these Horcruxes. It led us to form something of a mental link with the Dark Lord. We were able to gain insight into his… memories without his knowledge. I have seen Draco Malfoy refusing to do Voldemort’s bidding. I have felt the… weight of his disappointment turn to satisfaction at the possibility of torturing… a… an innocent face.”
“Of Harry?” He asks.
“And I thought– I always thought you were a spectacularly bad one, one I needed to break, one that brought me nothing but agony.”
He can’t meet Potter’s eyes because that damned verdant gaze is too much for him to take. He’d rather not discover unwelcome truths in their depths, find pity or disgust.
Confused Draco looks at him. “Why would I hate you?”
He manages his own wobbly, unsure smile in return.
By the time he looks up, dregs of broken courage mustered in the clench of his palm, Kingsley’s eyes are fixed on him. It’s assessing and cool as ever, indiscriminate in its neutrality. Nothing of his veneer softens when he nods once more, another sharp jerk before banging his gavel and saying in a tenor that brooks no argument, “Court is adjourned.”
“Of course it was,” Harry murmurs. “You with your talk of us visiting help centres for sexually frustrated men, of course our bond was much too strong for issues as trivial as death.”
Harry seems to struggle with his words. “You, you made amends with us. All three of us. And you tormented us more than you ever did the castle. If we can forgive and move on, so can Hogwarts. Especially a place like Hogwarts.”
Harry looks up to see Malfoy sucking it into his mouth, cheeks hollowed and eyes closed. He’s a sight, hair tousled and cascading over his forehead, lips a little swollen from the ice cream and an expression on his face that Harry can only describe as post-orgasmic bliss.
Granger’s eyebrows shoot into her hairline.
Draco notices, not for the first time today, how good Potter’s burgundy jumper looks on him.
“How’ve you been?” she asks when the pink creature has flown back. “It’s been a while since we saw each other.”
“I was paying back a life debt,” he says, the words uncomfortably acrid in his mouth.
murmurs the resignation in his eyes when their magic responds by tightening further.
Harry thrusts his finger in shallow, gentle movements, pushing in and pulling out until only the skin above his nails remains pressed to Draco’s hole.
Harry nods as best as he can without raising his head or moving it too much. He can’t decide what is more exhausting– moving his aching head or speaking with a sore, raw throat.
“You want to go sleep if off?” Draco asks Harry after a few minutes. “I’ll let you take a shower now and after, you can go to bed.”
, the voices say, whispering in the silence of his mind. Nothing else matters, just this, just the here and now, just them in a dimly lit room of a Camden bar, trying to find salvation in a situation that has already damned them.
“He’s the one who got us into this mess. He’s going to drag himself out of it,” he says, darkly and promptly looks horrified. Harry thinks he understands. The Malfoys’ honour code would never allow for a transgression against one’s own father in such uncharitable words.
He allows himself a mirthless smile when that thought crosses his mind- a Malfoy so unaccustomed to attention that he shies away from it, like a timid animal from a raging wildfire.
“Then don’t let his ideology steal the compassion from you,” Harry says. “He is not worth doing yourself that disservice.”
“No, I, I don’t want to come like that.”
“Pardon me, I find names cumbersome,” the stranger says. “I deal in faces.”
“Scriven’s?”
Potter himself goes through a complicated series of emotions. At first he seems as surprised by his own words as Draco. Then horrified, which makes more sense. Then thoughtful which veers into delighted and eventually settles on determined.
“You’re late,” Draco murmurs, when Harry is close enough to hear the whispered words.
“Was there ever any doubt?” Draco asks, the words forming and falling before he can stop and censor them.
“We try to keep ourselves busy, Malfoy. All of us. But at the end of the day, everything that has been our reality for the last few years is gone. I try to not have time but when I really think about it, I’m drifting. And I’m not willing to sit down and accept it. So will you put aside the last seven years of schooling and hatred for now and just work with me?”
When Draco stumbles in through the Manor’s Floo, his forehead is beaded with sweat and his hands are trembling violently, jerking in the uncontrollable fashion that usually signifies he has gone far too long without a Calming Draught.
“How precisely are there Pensieve memories of Draco Malfoy being subjected to torture by Bellatrix Lestrange? Were you a witness to this, Mr Potter?”
He’d debated in his fading moments that if he weren’t dying whether they’d have severed the bond by now, leaving the rings in a forgotten drawer in an attempt to move on.
Before Harry drifts off into peaceful sleep, he thinks that’s one of Draco’s best plans to date.
“Malfoy!”
Harry looks… gorgeous. He’s tied his hair back, now that it’s long enough for that, he’s shaved and he looks positively gorgeous in the suit, the green of his tie bringing out his eyes. He’s not wearing his glasses, probably courtesy of a strong, temporary vision charm. Draco’s glad he’s wearing robes or there would have been a dangerously uncomfortable situation in his pants.
The shame those words are drenched in is a force in itself, the one keeping Draco’s eyes down, the one making his shoulders shake, the one that had him shy away from Harry for a week. Harry licks his own lips and wonders what power he has that is stronger than that shame because Draco should not look this broken for something Harry finds no sin in.
Now, with Hermione’s hand stroking through his hair and the weight of Ron’s head on his shoulder, it comes back to him. The shame is still there, bitter as bile, but it’s overpowered by something so close to hope that Harry thinks he might choke on the sweetness of its fragrance.
‘Something wrong?’ Harry asks, worry creeping into his tone.
The Healer’s face is serious. She isn’t too old, Draco thinks, perhaps in her mid thirties. But she appears wiser than anyone of that age Draco has ever encountered. Hermione looks alarmed.
Draco nods, though it pains him to do so.
Harry has his own legacy, a vault full of money, a face he cannot claim to have worn first for its striking resemblance to a man he never knew, eyes that give him away as his mother’s son. But it’s one of bravery and love, of sacrifice so great that Harry resents it just as deeply as he is grateful to it. It’s a legacy of blood and death and ferocity, Gryffindor to its core.
“I want to go to Italy,” he says. “Tuscany. Maybe Florence. Maybe Rome.”
“You came up with the idea and it is a good idea so Draco and I can hash out what we want and you can write down. Maybe even, I don’t know, throw around a few ideas of your own.” Malfoy rolls his eyes at that.
divorce Harry.
“You seem… extraordinarily okay with the idea.”
“Merlin forbid,” Draco responds dryly.
It had led to one of those rare moments he had opened his arms up for a hug, and Harry had stepped into it with a surprised huff, and held on longer than he usually did.
“Can you talk?” Harry asks when he cottons on to Draco’s mental state.
Ever since, Harry locks his door before going to bed without fail. Hermione must have unlocked it herself to open the curtains. The thought fills him with a certain confusing fondness for the familiarity of her mother-henning and irritation at being... inspected.
“Draco, just, please, just this once, take me at my word instead of dredging up double meanings. I’m not giving you permission, just asking you to consider.”
“You look like you’re having an existential crisis,” Potter observes mildly. The foam of his beer has found its way onto his upper lip. He licks it off and spreads his hands out on the table in a throwaway gesture of
When Harry is in up till the third knuckle, he crooks his finger slightly. “What are you doing?” Draco asks, curious.
“It’s your life Malfoy.”
She huffs a startled laugh. “Why did you tell me this?”
Harry’s eyes are wide, and green, so green. Greener than the lights Draco sees flashing behind his eyes every time Harry pushes into him, every time Harry’s lips touch his. So green, and blown wide.
Traitor.
Potter does nothing, just twirls his wand between his fingers and stares.
“I know what I said, Draco,” she says with the patience of someone who is used to dealing with eighteen year olds behaving like they’re five.
Granger sighs. She stays quiet for a few minutes and Draco can hear a clock ticking somewhere. Then she straightens and with her usual determination, says, “Your mental health isn’t why I initially wanted to contact you.”
Scorpius watches Draco’s Adam’s apple bob with every swallow. The house is dark. Harry isn’t in.
“I didn’t fight for this,” he says, voice coming out hoarse and heavy with suppressed tears. “I didn’t fight for everyone involved to just keep living with the aftereffects and the shocks and horrors.” He stares bleakly at her, feeling exhausted and weak. “What was the point in getting rid of him if he keeps living on in our minds? I was supposed to save the world, Mione but all I did was, was…” he can’t go on, voice breaking into sobs. Hermione pulls him to her, close and safe. She smells of dust and old books and the familiar tightness of her arms allows Harry to let go.
When they go back to Grimmauld, Weasley leans into Hermione’s ear and says something which Draco wishes he had overheard because the result is Hermione’s cheeks reddening obviously. She looks towards Harry and Draco briefly, saying, “Boys, don’t burn the house down!” And then with an obviously suggestive look in Weasley’s direction saunters up the stairs.
Now Draco understands what it must have been like, being so close to something so despicable, something that wanted only to kill, to destroy, to scar and cause harm.
His chest aches, but he swallows against it and tries his best to not get too caught up in the liturgical chant of
This time, Harry screams himself hoarse as Draco’s tongue traces a broad swipe down his balls to his hole, which makes Harry realise how Draco had tied him– to keep him exposed, open.
But what truly unsettles Draco is not the ferocity but instead the new distance in Potter’s eyes. As though he’s not entirely where he is supposed to be. That, combined with the slightly unhinged air he seems to have around him now makes him unstable and even by looking at him, Draco knows that Potter’s magic is crackling like electricity around him, in the air, in his movements.
“What?” Potter asks like the buffoon he is, blinking at Draco.
“The witness may be seated,” Kingsley booms. Potter sits. Draco can tell from the way his shoulder jumps that he’s tapping his fingers against his thigh.
“I see,” Choudhury says. “I’ll do what I can. Now, don’t you worry dear, go downstairs and have some hot cocoa. Maybe some chocolate. And we’ll have a chat after I’m finished here. Is that alright?”
Her smile widens imperceptibly.
“You think hardcore Purebloods will give familial consent for their kids to just go out into the Muggle world?”
Draco knows his eyes have widened significantly. He wonders how he doesn’t have vision encompassing the whole room from how stretched the corners of his eyes feel, but everything has been consumed by Harry.
“Unnnghhfff.”
Draco understands. He doesn’t presume to think he understands the true extent of Potter’s trauma but if the horrors he has had to endure are even half as much as what Draco has, he wouldn’t want to share them with someone else. It is in a way ironic that Potter has possibly seen
says Blaise’s voice in his head in that same sorrowful murmur.
When he looks back at Potter, Potter’s smiling. “Something real, then,” he says and the words are drenched in bittersweet surprise.
He stops himself before he can go further down the road. In, one, two three, out. In, one, two, three, out. In, one, two, three, out.
“How so?”
She fire-calls the shop and over the crackling connection they find out Pig is out. “There’s a Ministry owl George has hired for a few days, should I send him?”
Harry knows Draco loves it from the moment they step into the clearing when Draco’s mouth falls open at the beauty of the little house covered in creeping tendrils of flowering ivy.
