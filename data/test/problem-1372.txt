“Let’s move on to Lady Cakes McMansion,” RuPaul said. “What happened to you out there?”
“Draco—,” RuPaul began, “Your comments tonight on the runway were full-bodied, but your geometric couture lacks...dimension. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
By the time RuPaul called them back to the other end of the room, Draco was dressed in a low-cut white dress and pumps with a short, curly blonde wig.
Draco blinked. She had no idea in the slightest what Courtney was talking about. “I’m afraid I’m not familiar with them,” she responded a bit stiffly. “Is that an Australian group?”
“I’m surprised that part would bother you,” Martha interjected. The others laughed.
—Before the Viewing Party—
Those in the audience who were either muggleborn or had some familiarity with muggle magic tricks (hello, George Weasley) burst into laughter at Draco’s reaction to seeing a trick for the first time.
Lorena picked up a drumstick from the platter and proceeded to fellate it in the most obscene way possible.
“I can’t hot glue this material,” Intoxia held up a length of shiny, bulky teal fabric in frustration. “I should probably try to hand sew it. It’s too big for the machine,” he whined.
“I think it’s sad that so few people in the LGBT community are registered to vote,” Paris added. "The people leading this country are making decisions that affect our civil rights, and even our very lives, and we can’t afford
Eventually, the queens were all called back to the stage. Paris, Goldie, Lorena, Steve, Kali, and Ivana stood in the front.
“Nice weather for flying this morning, huh?” she commented as they both steered their brooms around another curve in the pitch.
—Confessional—
“So who do you think’s in the top?” Acacia asked.
Draco’s eyebrows raised and her jaw dropped. Lady Cakes clapped her hands together and Lorena jumped up and down, squealing with delight.
“I think he means Jacob Marley,” Granger-Weasley muttered into the book. Draco shook his head. At least she knew better than to stick her nose in their fight.
Trigger Warning for homophobic language. If you want to avoid it, scroll on by to the next scene after the queens start their bar crawl, or ctrl/cmd + F for Elimination Day.
“Rise and shine, bitches!” Lorena, Venus, Kali, and Paris skipped into the workroom the next morning. Draco led a giggling Goldie in a waltz. Lady Cakes trailed behind them and shook her head.
Harry grinned. “I know exactly when,” he answered. “We were just sitting quietly in each other’s company, reading books on the couch, and then you took your shoes off.”
“I’ve missed you,” she whispered into Draco’s wig.
“I’m thinking of playing the smart, female candidate that no one votes for.”
—Confessional—
“Draco—! RuPaul addressed. Tell us about your outfit.”
“This is going to be a right bloody mess, I swear by Ross’s pink frilly knickers,” Draco told the camera, shaking his head.
“Sweet Merlin,” Harry shook his head. Greg Goyle, Blaize Zabini, and Theo Nott — Draco’s surviving Slytherin dorm mates — had all turned to Draco and glared. Pansy and the other girls were beside themselves with laughter.
“Michelle’s tits,” Draco sighed, and downed her cocktail in one go.
Draco turned his attention away from them. Weasley and Potter were sitting on giant turnips the size of armchairs, watching the scene. Granger-Weasley had conjured herself a chair and was sitting at the table, studying the book.
“Lorena, you’ve won a year’s supply of makeup from Salmon Buffet. That’s

The queens looked at each other.
After the end of Episode 3, the queens reentered the werkroom to find Cindy Sanchez’s lipstick message.
“Araneus. But she’s now retired from drag.”
. It felt like his brains were struggling to catch up. His heart rate sped faster than was probably healthy.
“Very well,” Burbage huffed. “I know of a good muggle theatre in Salisbury we could haunt. Come on, Aura! Put some hustle in your bustle!”
“Former Death Eater or no, you’ve been keeping your nose clean since your trial. I didn’t have any reason to expect this case to get interesting at all. Imagine my surprise when you went into a flying spin on just your second day of shooting!”
Queens scrambled to get to their makeup stations. Goldie dragged Draco over to his station and sat him down in the chair, then studied his face before reaching for some foundation.
“I’m fine,” Lady Cakes muttered, struggling to remove a lumpy black leather fingerless glove. He hissed.

Draco shrugged nonchalantly, inwardly grateful for the change of topic. “It was for

“That’s not—”
The queens rushed to the stations to change, then crowded around a table to paint press-on nails.
Microphones: I realized as I was editing this that everyone on Drag Race has to have a microphone taped onto their torsos, but I had already written the microphone scene with Bruce Vilanch and wanted to keep it. So, um, suspended disbelief?
The stag nuzzled the side of his face, then faded away into the mist.
“I know I shouldn’t laugh,” she chuckled. “I promised I wouldn’t laugh. But dear lord, I think Carmelita might have been right about Draco being from another planet.”
—Confessional—
“Honestly, I think it’s ridiculous that we should have to sew our own costumes,” Carmelita Corazon complained. She had also been harshly criticized for her look. “I have tens of thousands of dollars in costumes that I brought with me and I can’t even show them off! I have people who make my outfits so I don’t have to!”
The rest of the queens seemed to have forgotten Draco as they gushed over the new girl, who was apparently a big name in the Los Angeles drag scene. Another queen might have felt slighted, but Draco was relieved to lose attention from the previous line of questioning.
The queens applauded.
“I don’t,” Lady Cakes sighed. “Looks like I’m going home next.”

Was Draco turning into a Hufflepuff?
After two days of searching Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, Harry had finally tracked down a box of files related to the house and the Black estate. The estate was apparently somewhere in the Cotswolds and had a small acreage of farmland that had been managed by a wizard named Thomas Pendleton who lived on another piece of farmland nearby.
“All right, we’ll try to keep this short. But first, I think the question on everyone’s mind is, where have you been? Everyone’s been looking for you!”
, one of my favourite books when I was a kid. It’s about how Aethelwynne is brought to life and becomes a wartime spy. This specific look is from Chapter 13, after Aethelwynne gets knocked off her shelf by a cat. She breaks her face and arm and has a disjointed walk, which is truly horrifying, but she lives through it and survives the war.”
“You know how he is about photographers,” Draco added. “Getting him adjusted to having a camera in his face is going to be an entirely different challenge. Once he’s comfortable baking within the time limitations, Millicent and I will put him through rigorous television personality training by bringing in a camera and asking him question after question about his baking.”
“Draco, are you okay?” Goldie asked, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder and handing him a tissue.
“Ooh, a French burn!” RuPaul looked delighted. Paris scoffed in bemusement.
“I tried wandering around for a while,” Crabbe continued. “There wasn’t much to do at Hogwarts, so I went to London for a bit. You know, to see the sights.”
“No, not really. I’m from the UK. Any other Brits here?” she asked, raising her hand. No one answered. “I’m the only one? Excellent! Then I could literally say anything about being British and no one will contradict me.
“You know you gotta be thirty-five to run for president, right?” Lady Cakes rebuffed. “That’s, like, fifty-seven in gay years.”
Even then, he wasn’t sure he was in love, however. He wasn’t even sure he could be capable of love. What
“You both go on ahead,” Harry said, then looked at Draco. “I’ll catch up in a minute.”
Lorena chimed in as she glued rhinestone-studded eyelashes to her lower lid. “Yeah, that’s great, but I’m a drag queen. I’m here to entertain and be fun, not be all serious.”
“Draco! It’s been a while. How are you, old chap?” He took off his reading glasses and wiped the lenses with a tiny embroidered handkerchief he’d pulled out of his smoking jacket before sliding them back on again.
,” RuPaul repeated.
“For this week’s mini challenge, I want to see you give us your best face — on someone else! Pair up with the person next to you,” he said, and the queens drifted into pairs. Draco found himself paired with Goldie.
Draco rolled her eyes. “As much as I appreciate the need for drama in these Untucked sessions, your delivery leaves something to be desired,” she drawled.
“Kali Sister, you are safe.” Kali thanked her and joined the others. “Steve Donovan, you are safe.” Steve’s bottom lip wibbled before she sobbed and walked back. “Intoxia...you are safe.”
“Right. And Goldie is an anime character—”
“Crabbe, you hover above the circle,” Draco continued. Crabbe moved into place in the middle. “Next, we light a black candle in the middle.”
Polite applause came from four queens who were clustered around a pink worktable. Draco walked up to them.
land in the bottom,” Lorena Gucci shot back, giving Acacia a bored look. “Do you think RuPaul wants to crown a winner who can’t win a challenge?”
“Here we go, four queens of color, and only one non-white part,” Carmelita muttered as he looked at the script with dismay.
“Why, it’s one of my very own drag daughters from Season Seven and All Stars Season Two, Katya Zamolodchikova!”
—Confessional—
“Draco is out there nailing every single word,” Goldie explained. “She’s not even looking at that piece of paper. She don’t need no cheat sheet!”
“Well, she also wrote about how the Parselmouth in question had come into the shop and told her the snake’s name was Stefan. She thankfully kept our names out of it, but of course our friends were able to put two and two together.”
Steve crossed her arms and looked away.
Drag Queen Draco Malfoy now had the opportunity to completely shed those former identities like layers of a snake's skin and reinvent himself (or herself) for a new audience who knew nothing about Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy. Drag Queen Draco Malfoy was lovely and refined and elegant (albeit not above a cake fight, apparently). He wasn’t about to fuck that up by doing anything that might be construed as violent — even to a stupid stuffed animal.
“And old enough to think for herself and try new things, which is more than I can say for

Draco considered this and looked out across the parking lot while the other two smoked in silence. She started to turn back to the door to go back inside when Steve screamed.

“What’s wrong with that? I’m intrigued.”
“Jameela Jamil.”
“And we’re…”
“He didn’t mention anything about that,” Draco frowned. “He wants me to help him move on to...well, whatever happens to ghosts when they stop being ghosts.”
Draco put the finishing touches on her costume in the green room behind the Bent Unicorn’s stage area, fixing a ruffled pink hat to her short brown wig. She had begun doing more of her prep work onsite rather than back at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, much to Teddy’s dismay. She had other practical considerations for avoiding being seen in this particular costume prior to taking the stage to introduce the episode.

Draco raised a painted eyebrow. “Be glad I didn’t lip sync,” she replied. “I would have danced circles around you, literally.”
Harry Gryffindor smiled and put his shirt back on. Granger and Teddy looked pleased.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
They looked at each other as the screen shut off.
Draco shrugged. “I’m fine, see?”
Back in the werkroom, the queens sat in their teams and brainstormed ideas for selling their products.
Draco grinned. She had survived the first episode. She could only wonder what reactions she would get from future episodes.
—At the Viewing Party—
Draco then marched the rest of the way forward and simultaneously pulled her wand—her
premier viewing party, someone from the
As luck would have it, a spectral silver stag suddenly jumped through the hotel room window and stopped in front of Draco’s bed.
His first choice had been Karen Jones from the
Draco considered him for a moment. Lately, he had been trying this new concept of being nicer to people. In the second week of Drag Race, the other queens in Team Venus had wanted Draco to be sent home. But then, being nice to Lady Cakes by healing his wrists had paid off. Not only had he helped Draco win the Week 3 challenge, but he was helping him understand American muggle culture. For that matter, Steve Donovan had seemed to warm up to Draco after Draco had helped her during Untucked. Maybe niceness could change other queens’ opinions of her.
Draco pursed her lips and nodded, mentally reviewing the lyrics for the lip sync number while RuPaul explained to both Queenie and Carmelita why their outfits were both horrible. Both queens held their breath while RuPaul milked the moment for as much dramatic tension as possible.
“He asked for a tattoo of a snake coiled around his cock. Said it had to look good whether he was erect or not, and it had to be
“Temporary work,” he replied.
And that was that. Harry stood up stiffly and left the office.
“Kali is serving Jameela Jamil by way of Dick Van Dyke,” Lady Cakes laughed. “It’s a jolly ‘oliday with Kali!”
“I’ve brought Bianca del Rio here today to help give you some pointers on your stand-up routines,” RuPaul explained. The pair went from table to table and talked to each queen in turn.
The next day was elimination day. The queens chatted as they prepared their runway looks.
Draco Malfoy was in a state of ongoing metamorphosis in his life. Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy was still reviled back in England. Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy had been unable to get a job in the wizarding world after his sentence of house arrest ended following the war. Soon after a chance encounter with Harry Potter, the two started dating and fell in love, and Draco graduated from Unemployed Former Death Eater Draco Malfoy to Unemployed Live-In Boyfriend Draco Malfoy.
“Winner, winner, chicken dinner,” RuPaul drawled. “Lady Cakes McMansion, Lorena Gucci, Draco— Condragulations, you three are the winners of this challenge.”
“Nice to meet you,” Draco said cautiously.
Suddenly, Venus burst out laughing. “Hash
“It’s a brand new day in the workroom” Venus cried. “And, we still have seven queens this week. Which one of you am I gonna send home?” He laughed.
“I suppose you’re not the worst person I’ve talked to tonight,” Draco admitted. Right. Definitely not flirting.
Within an hour, Draco had posted tweets condemning the attacks and supporting his sisters, and set Mariah Thomas up as his social media manager. He would pay extra for the service, but it was worth it to have someone else sift through the noise in order to stay on top of the important messages. Besides, Draco had started getting more paying gigs at muggle drag shows around the country, and had even had some modeling and advertising offers in the last week. He could afford to outsource some of the online work.
“Ah. Now we know the sorting hat didn’t put you in Slytherin by mistake.
RuPaul moved on to the next queen. “Now, it’s time to introduce a princess from a galaxy far away, Carrie Fisher!” Intoxia-as-Carrie-Fisher waved. “Tell me something,” RuPaul said. “As the star of a legendary movie franchise, did it take some convincing for you to come here on our show today?”
“Great. Enjoy your stay,” she finished in her bored voice, then looked back to the line. “I can help who’s next!”
—Confessional—
“You know, that thing,” Draco waved her hand in the air. “It takes us to and from the hotel.”
“Welcome, ladies!” RuPaul addressed them. “The judges and I watched your cooking shows, and I’ve made some decisions. This week, you worked in teams, but tonight on the runway you will each be judged individually.
. More people in wizarding Britain expressed sympathy in their letters to the editor after the second episode, arguing that Draco deserved more credit for her performance and wondered what was wrong with her red carpet look, anyway.
The man got into the front left seat of the not-Knight-Bus and looked back at Draco. Draco only had time for a fleeting realization that the steering wheel was on the wrong side. Weren’t they supposed to be on the right? “All buckled in?” the man asked.
“And CUT!” Michelle called out.
audition,” Draco told Blaise by way of an explanation as they heard loud clanking and rattling of pots and pans as they approached.
“All right, now let the music play!”
Blu Hydrangea: “I’m gonna play Mary Berry.”
Harry must have navigated to the right screen for that, because his frown deepened. Draco’s panic increased.
“Never mind that,” Draco waved his hand in dismissal.
“It’s not a bustle; it’s a bum roll!” Aura retorted as she followed Burbage and Crabbe through the closed window.
“I’m sure he’d want to see
“Love you too, Steve,” Lady Cakes McMansion sighed as she sprayed the mirror and wiped at the lipstick. “Damn, this shit really don’t come off easy, does it?”
“Yaaaaasss!” This announcement garnered even more excitement. Draco cheered along with the other queens, even though he had no idea what that meant.
“Shit,” Paris breathed.
“Red for filth,” purred special guest judge Ya Kid K.
Harry acknowledged Draco’s apprehension with a nod and automatically slid into Heroic Saviour Mode. He picked up Draco’s phone and held it out to Draco. “Give me your finger so I can unlock it.”
“When’s the last time we talked?” Goyle countered. “I’ve lost touch since you didn’t come to my last graduation party.”
” Intoxia-as-Carrie-Fisher held up her card. “You should always take your prescription medication, RuPaul.”
“Record a video.”
When he had first arrived, Draco couldn’t help fangirling over the reality of meeting RuPaul and the other queens. She had even fangirled over meeting Courtney Act — at least, until everything became a chocolate-smeared blur of cakefighting, sabotaged Secret Santa gifts, and poor drag choices. Hopefully, what Draco had lost in terms of Courtney Act’s goodwill would be worth it if audiences would remember her despite her lack of prior fame in the business.
Scorpius had gotten his school supplies list. The two of them made their trip to Diagon Alley that weekend.
The other queens looked at each other nervously.
“Setting aside for a moment that I think living with a Gryffindor has rubbed off on you in a frightening way, would you say that you have a...
So, he had asked Granger for advice. After some discussion and a trip to a muggle vintage clothing store, Draco was equipped with a halter top, leather trousers, chunky-heeled boots, and a wooden stake, ready to portray Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
“Anyway, they seemed to buy the idea of a hangover remedy. And they weren’t surprised by the idea of potions and cauldrons, either — they just didn’t understand why I was talking about them when I didn’t dress to fit their idea of a witch.”
“She done closed the library!” RuPaul cried as Draco handed back the sunglasses and skipped playfully back to his place in the lineup.
One by one, the queens were called forward to model their fruit.
“None — they all had heart attacks and died the moment they saw her walk out here,” Carson Kressley quipped.
“My pen is broken,” Draco muttered. “Has anyone got a pen I could borrow?” The other queens ignored him, concentrating on their own joke-writing efforts.
“‘Sex is Brilliant,’ and, erm, ‘Don’t Bugger Me in the Arse Unless You Got Twenty Quid.’”
Draco snorted. “That much was a given.”
—THE END—
worth it.”
, Draco thought. Kali looked up to the lights, then at Draco, and raised his eyebrows questioningly. Draco took a deep breath and held it for a few seconds before letting it out.
RuPaul laughed. “Sorry, not a match. All right, Nicole Byer, what’s your answer?”
“Now, your first mini challenge is going to be a time-honored tradition,” he explained. “You’ll each have a photo shoot with our photographer, Mike Ruiz,” Ru explained. The queens all clapped and cheered appreciatively.
“Rani Padmavati from
“Madame Inkwell wrote in to tell about the one time she’d had a customer come in and ask for a snake on his cock, because he was dating a Parselmouth,” Harry continued, then grinned at Draco. “She said you cried like a baby, even after taking three pain-numbing potions--”
Draco stepped out of the floo and into the dimly lit wizarding reception room of Best of Both Worlds. This was the relatively new shop that Dean Thomas had opened with his muggle sister next to the Leaky Cauldron. The business primarily catered to muggleborns and their families, offering email-to-owl mailing services, wizarding/muggle currency exchange and credit services, and electronic devices that had been modified to resist shorting out around magic. After Harry had told Draco about buying his laptop there, Draco had found their services indispensable in preparing his audition video for
Draco made a face like she had bitten into a lemon.
“Hello, Divining Divas! I knew you were going to call,” Draco answered like a smug Trelawney. “I suppose you’d like to know what the future has in store for you?”
“You are safe.”
“Ladies, you all really knew how to work that produce — but two of you really stood out: Steve Donovan and Intoxia Madison!” The queens cheered. Intoxia clapped and Steve curtsied.
“All right, Jiggly,” RuPaul grinned, “Thank you for joining us today! Now, it’s time to introduce our next celebrity. She is the 2019 Woman of the Decade Award winner, Taylor Swift!”
strategic, as Shangela had?
Lorena turned to face the back of the set and wiggled her well padded derriere. She looked over her shoulder and said in a sexy voice, “Chicken butt!”
“In this challenge, we are each portraying famous women from the 1990s, and I’m assigned the part of Cher
” Kali muttered, this time loud enough for Draco to hear.
“Oh! Yes, of course,” Draco replied. “While I’m on
A pregnant pause filled the Untucked Lounge as Lorena gaped in surprise. Goldie handed her a napkin.
Queenie Q was a queen famous for her online videos, but proved herself to be paralyzed with stage fright on Drag Race. Her runway look was mostly a giant silicone breastplate with corset and panties, topped with a cape sloppily constructed from the fabric she had been given. It did not bode well for her. Not that Draco really cared. Draco had a song to memorize.
Mariah grinned back. “Yes, social media accounts! We received quite the urgent message earlier. It seems World Of Wonder has been trying to call you ever since the first episode aired, but your phone has been turned off.”
The other queens looked at her in alarm.
“Yeah!” several of the girls cheered.
Draco wasn’t aware how much time had passed like that. Eventually, he pulled away to breathe, his eyes wide.

“Y’all can skip and dance all you want,” she laughed.

So what do you think of this episode? Other Drag Race thoughts? Holy crap, Widow Von Du brought chocolate cake to the Snatch Game! Is Jackie Cox the Pandora Boxx of Season 12? Did Jan achieve the impossible by being “too much” for RuPaul’s Drag Race? State your opinions in your initial post and then reply to at least three other posts by -- Sorry, eLearning is doing something weird to my brain.
Draco raised an eyebrow at her. He hadn’t been aware that he was being followed, but the news didn’t come as a surprise. “I’m sure I hate to be so disappointing.”
Draco closed his eyes and held his breath. “What does that mean, exactly?” he asked after a moment.
“Thank you, Ladies,” RuPaul said, “While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.”
“But I’m loving this new side of you,” Ross continued. “I believe that you really could kill us all if you wanted to.”
“Any time someone gives me any problem on social media, I just RELEASE THE BEES!” She swept her arms dramatically. RuPaul laughed.
—Confessional—
Harry blinked. He looked around the room, blurry as it was without his glasses. Why was it blurry? Where were his glasses? How did it get so dark?
“Fantastic! Let’s see what you can do. Now, follow these steps.”
RuPaul laughed. The other queens on the runway turned to give her an odd stare.
“How did you decide on that order?” Paris asked.
“I don’t know why you feel like you have to go with me,” Scorpius complained, huffing his too-long, too-purple fringe out of his eyes. “I’m of age now. I can pick up all my stuff on my own.”
When he finished, Lady Cakes tried flexing one wrist. He gasped in surprise. “
“Really!” Draco scoffed. “Tell us more about how unhappy you are with RuPaul while the cameras are running, sweetie. I wouldn’t be surprised if Ru sends her home just for that! Besides, I actually think it’s quite cunning, using this platform in such a way, and I’m not just saying that to toady up to the boss, either.”
RuPaul doubled over in laughter. “It’s always the children who suffer most when a drag family splits up,” he noted in mock seriousness. “Now there’s something I’d like to know about you. You’ve only been doing drag for a very short time, but I can tell that you are a very creative person. How did you express your creativity before you discovered drag?”
Whatever sense of euphoria Draco felt when dancing on the runway evaporated during the face-to-face session with the judges. Ivana, Goldie, Venus, Kali, Steve, and Intoxia had already been declared “safe” and sent back to the Untucked lounge.
Back on the runway, the Venusian team faced final judgment while their Parisian sisters stood in the back.
“Yeah, boo, we know,” Lady Cakes laughed. “We oughta make a list of all the movies you need to see.”
“If I get sent home for being too nice, I’ll be like, ‘Curse you bitches!’” He shook his fist in the air.
“Rude!” Professor Burbage cried, wagging her finger. “Ten points from Slytherin.” The spectral pair flew right through him and flounced out of the room (as much as ghosts could flounce, anyway), leaving Draco shuddering and alone again.
“Oh my God, did someone use up
“Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync...for your
“The Aurors were okay with it,” Draco rolled her eyes. Honestly, did anyone think they would all still be there to watch the episode if Draco had violated the Statute of Secrecy and been arrested in the US?
Draco fell backwards into a death drop. From across the stage, she saw Queenie rip off her wig in a frenzy of passion. For a fleeting second, she wondered whether she should maybe remove her wig at some point, too, until she saw RuPaul and Michelle narrow their eyes at Queenie in disappointment. That settled that question — well, that and the fact that she had surreptitiously used a semi-permanent sticking charm when no one had been looking. That wig wasn’t going anywhere without a countercharm.
“Fine, fine,” Draco grumbled, “But you’re all missing out. It really is a work of art.”
“Splendid,” Draco managed to utter after he’d cleaned up tea for the second time that morning. “What’s next in your busy afterlife?”
” Draco informed him.
A few queens snickered. Lady Cakes raised a shaky fist and finished, ”Vote for Ol’ Lady Cakes, and Imma take a switch to Washington and give those whippersnappers a piece of my mind.”
“I’m afraid I can’t stay,” Narcissa continued. “But I wanted to let you know that I’ve been watching your performances. I’m so

—ooo—
“We’re three sorority sisters who go to a school for magic,” Paris explained.
“Wait in here, please,” she merely said in response, gesturing toward an open door into a small conference room. And then she left.
Draco swallowed past a lump in her throat. “I’ve missed you, too.”
Venus Flygirl as Leeloo wore a bright orange wig and a costume that looked like it was made out of white elastic bands. She lip synced a long line of gibberish as she spun around the pole gracefully, her lips not matching the words by a long shot.
“This way, please,” a witch shooed him off the landing pad in a bored voice.
Harry smiled back.
But, even in death, there was no such luck.
His level of annoyance climbed even higher when he realized he would have to wait on the person behind him in line to finish up with the agent before she returned her attention to him.
Acacia looked over her shoulder and cackled. “Oh my god, you actually wrote down ‘magical black women?!’”
“Oh indeed.” Draco loved his son, but absolutely hated the purple. Blond hair was the only redeeming quality of the Malfoy family.
“She up there lookin’ for the
Goyle looked confused. “But I thought you liked them. You told me you liked Dickens especially.”
“I am positively floating down the runway, and I am determined to convince the judges of what I can do with just a little fabric,” Draco told the camera. “My look is a Greco-Roman-style chiton with a halter neckline, and I know I am showing my naturally exquisite body in its best light. My outfit makes me look like a goddess in the front...and just a bit naughty in the back,” he added with a sly grin.
The queens dashed to their stations. Draco had learned his lesson from the first time they had to throw on quick drag, and had foregone a workroom outfit covered in buttons. This time, he was wearing an aubergine velvet smoking jacket, untied to show a cropped midnight blue T-shirt that revealed his bare midriff. The shirt featured Draco’s name and constellation in shiny silver detail. He had paired it with dark blue skinny jeans and purple ankle boots.
Which is why Draco now frowned at the Buffy the Vampire Slayer costume on his clothing rack. The idea of playing that type of character felt like a slap in her face. But what other choice did he have? It’s not like he knew that many fictional characters in muggle culture. Almost all of his exposure to muggle arts had been reality television programming.
“That was really hard yesterday,” Steve said as he steamed a turquoise gown.
Harry smiled and shrugged. “Sure, why not? I bet you’d look absolutely hot as a drag queen. And I know you don’t mind wearing heels and a skirt,” he added, winking. They had already had some fun with this kink after Draco had discovered a few trunks of women’s clothes and accessories in the attic.
Of course, since it was dark, there wasn’t much to see. Draco sighed. “What is it, Potter? You look like you want to ask something; might as well get on with it.”
Draco swiveled his head around to the source of the voice. Potter — beautiful, unfairly sexy Potter — was standing right next to him, holding a tiny sausage on a cocktail napkin. Draco blinked.
“A legendary British baker,” Kali repeated, affecting Draco’s British accent.
“Well, what else am I going to do with my time?” Draco shrugged, then gestured around at the sheets of parchment strewn all over the desk and floor, covered in copious notes. “I’m a professional drag queen now. Or, at least, I will be, as soon as I get the right supplies.”
“I’m forty-three!” Draco cried. “And your perception is skewed because you’re forever a teenager.”

But he had always tried to earn his father’s approval anyway. His left arm twitched at times when he thought about the sacrifices he had made for his father. He didn’t have to look at look at the mark on his arm to be reminded of it.
“You’ve got this,” Harry winked at him. “Love you with all my heart, Draco!”
“Who’s got 20 quid???” she tweeted.
“Hem, hem.” No one acknowledged the fake cough from Draco-as-Umbridge on stage. “HEM HEM! MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION!” she bellowed. “I seem to have lost my cat. Has anyone seen my pussy?” The audience laughed. “Why are you all laughing? Now, I want everyone to help look for my pussy. I LOVE PUSSY!”
“It was still bloody hot.”
“FATHER!” Scorpius had entered the room levitating a cake, and gave Draco a horrified look. “No one wants to see your penis!”
Another confession: I was watching Drag Race UK’s Snatch Game episode thinking, “Nobody play Mary Berry. Nobody play Mary Berry…”
All the queens stopped to look at two men who leaned against a wall as the group was passing them by on the sidewalk. One of the men pushed away from the wall and faced them. He stood menacingly over Goldie, who started to tremble. Goldie, the smallest of all of them, in that moment reminded Draco of a little fish that knew it was mere seconds away from being eaten by a bigger fish.
On Elimination Day, the queens reentered the workroom. Draco, Paris, and Goldie had stayed up late to rehearse their act, but felt confident. At least, Draco felt confident that their act would be entertaining. He hoped the aurors would see it that way, too.
“Get ready, America! Draco—” she paused dramatically, taking off her sunglasses to reveal stunning silver eyes, “—has crossed the pond.”
Draco smirked back at him. “You and your foot fetish,” he said. “Just think, if you weren’t so hard for my bare feet, we might not all be here today.”
—Confessional—
“Ooh, gimme a Victorian whore,” the voice answered enthusiastically.
In the Untucked Lounge, Draco quietly kept to herself while the other safe queens discussed who was likely going to be in the bottom. Now that she was safe, Draco’s mind reeled back to the pending court case before the Wizengamot and Kali’s attempt to get her to use magic to help her with her costume.

Granger-Weasley nodded. “Quite the happily ever after — minus the living, I suppose.”
“Cut!” Martha said. Draco stopped and looked at her. “Did you say a
“But she got better!” Draco turned to the audience. “And isn’t it a nice arse, ladies and gentlemen? Paris, show them your arse!” Paris turned around and twerked while the audience erupted in cheers and applause.
—ooo—
After a few more minutes, Draco had found a bottle of green dye and poured it into a little bowl. He dipped the makeshift quill into the dye, tapped it against the side of the bowl to remove excess drips, and began scribbling notes on his notepad with a sigh of relief.

Lady Cakes groaned and tapped at his watch. “My Fitbit says it’s time for me to die.” He cradled his right wrist in his left hand and closed his eyes.
“When Voldemort killed me,” Potter clarified in a way that wasn’t any clearer at all. “Of course, when I saw Dumbledore in King’s Cross Station afterwards, he said he didn’t think I was dead. Maybe that’s why it was so easy for me to come back to life.”
Teddy beamed. “Enough to go to the drag race party?”
“I was definitely getting a Sharon Needles vibe the way you were talking about potions and cauldrons,” Special Guest Judge Snoop Dogg added. “It would have helped if you dressed the part and made a total witch of yourself, though.”

Heather turned her face to look at him again. She considered him for a moment before answering, “You know, I’m inclined to believe you.”
“Gougères,” Harry answered, holding the tray out toward the drag king. “Savory choux pastries mixed with cheese. I added a dash of smoked paprika to make these a little more interesting.”
Most disturbing was a letter that threatened to take action if it happened again on the show.
“Yaaas!” Paris tapped her long fingernails together.
...and
“How was that?” Draco asked.
“Now, it’s important to stir the mixture counterclockwise for exactly thirteen rotations,” Draco continued. “And then you can add your grated smurf. Now, fresh smurf is best, but dried will do if you add another centilitre of water—”
Steve nodded apprehensively.
“Let’s take it from—” Ross looked at the script they had given him “—’one bite will have you moaning in delight.’”
“Vince was a very supportive friend while I was working on my degrees,” Goyle said. “Once I set him up in a room with audiobooks, we found we both liked to discuss classics of the English canon. Though I’m more into Shakespeare and he’s clearly a Dickens man. We almost came to blows once over

Draco frowned. “
Todric grinned. “I want to know how many gay antique dealers between here and London are throwing their remotes at the TV right now.”
“Look, it’s not as though I’ve needed to know the exact numbers before! When I need money, I just go in and fill a bag.”
” Lady Cakes sniffled softly into his shoulder. “I don’t know what’s in that stuff you gave me, but my wrists feel a hundred percent better this morning.”
“There’s no record of anyone casting the charm on a living creature, let alone themselves, so I’m testing out ways of combining it with some transfiguration spells for animagi,” Draco explained. He sagged into his vanity chair. “I’ve yet to successfully split my entire body. With some more practice, I think I can get there, but I can only do so much at a time before I get a massive headache.”
Draco blinked. “I was not aware there was a —”

“Amen!” The queens chimed.
When it was her turn, Draco grabbed a saucepan and placed it on the stove before Acacia turned to the camera.
“What does that mean?” she asked.

The judges looked baffled.
“I thought I’d take him out flying on our brooms and surprise him with a blow job.”

“Welcome, Racers!” RuPaul greeted them cheerfully through the screen, wearing a black top with a low neckline and frizzy honey-blonde hair. “Can you dance like a she-ro, or do you just like going down on a pole?” The queens shot each other puzzled looks. “Are you a pretty woman, or just pretty in pink? This week, we’re going to find out which queens are a real sister act, and which of you are just plain
“You rolled right over my turn and made it sound like Beyoncé said something really funny when she didn’t. That wasn’t the greatest answer of all time!” Goldie stifled a laugh. Venus dropped her jaw, her eyes widening.
“Maybe sorority sisters?”
Draco had no idea what any of it meant, but she did as asked, serving her best duckface while posing in front of a ballot box.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Here,” he sighed, and reached forward to pick up the spider with his hand.
“First up is legendary actor and civil rights activist, George Takei!”

“Why do they call it a microphone, anyway, when it makes sounds louder?” Draco asked. “Shouldn’t it be called a macrophone instead?”
In the last few months he had metamorphosed into Theoretical Drag Queen Draco Malfoy. At least, it was theoretical while Draco still practiced in the privacy of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place for an audience of Harry, a couple house elves, and Dean Thomas’ muggle sister who had been willing to help him prepare his

Kali Sister raised her arms over her head in victory. “I’m still amazed that I finally won something!” The other queens cheered.
Draco huffed. It’s not like she’d never seen another queen on
“My fellow queens,” RuPaul greeted them with an air of pomp. “Four score and seven queens ago, I wanted

The next morning, Draco thought the production assistant who was taping a wire mic onto him looked familiar.
“Harry, you don’t want to read ninety percent of these messages.”
“Hello, hello, hello!” RuPaul stepped into the workroom, dressed in a three-piece suit patterned with muggle street signs.
Draco sighed. Of course. But it had been worth a shot. No stone unturned, anyway, right?
“The she-beast rears her head,” Zabini muttered into his own cocktail.
Several people gasped and looked at Draco in alarm.

“Nobody’s seen you around in years. You’ve been a bit of a mystery.” The Golden Boy grinned.

“Just dragons and a constellation.” He replied, his voice muffled by Lady Cakes’ shoulder.
“He was a champion athlete at school. Now this one says ‘Weasley Is Our King’ — he was another athlete, I guess. But this one is my favorite — the ‘I’ stands for ‘Inquisitorial Squad.’ That was a club I helped start. I like this badge for the clean, elegant lines.”
“Once I came to and realized I was dead, Hogwarts didn’t look like a battleground anymore,” Crabbe explained. “I didn’t even recognize half the students or teachers.” He casually drifted around Draco’s kitchen and examined a potted plant by the window.

“And then, what do you suppose is the proper thing to do in that situation, when one’s mates are all wanking? Why, wank along in solidarity, of course!”
“Why, yes, now that you mention it,” she replied.
Teddy’s face fell. “Awww! But I’ll be
Draco nodded. “He’s my boyfriend.”
“Imavbrntm,” Harry muttered.
Ivana looked at her with surprise, then handed over her cigarette.
“All right, ladies,” RuPaul addressed the workroom at large. “Remember — these are tough times, and the future of this great nation depends on you.”

“Now, you’ll be performing in two teams before a live audience,” RuPaul continued. “Venus, since you won the mini challenge, you get to choose your sisters.” Venus smiled deviously. “So, Venus, who is your first choice?”
“Now, for the rest of you, it’s time for the judges’ critiques.” Acacia, Draco, Steve, Intoxia, and Lorena exchanged nervous looks.
“Merlin, that’s messed up.”
Harry flushed. He should have been angry. He really should have. But instead, he felt a tiny thrill run down his spine.
Goyle looked at Draco. “I think I’ll head down, too. Will you two be alright in this room?” he looked around. “I don’t know how safe it is.” With that, he placed the rubber-chicken-turned-candle onto the table.
“Abra Cadabra, ladies!”
“Category is...the Wonders of the World!” RuPaul announced.

“I’m sure,” Millicent snorted derisively.
Well. When she put it like that... “They were changing lives,” she said in RuPaul’s defense.
—Confessional—
“Lorena Gucci, you are safe.” Lorena bowed her head and went to the back of the stage.
“No, I don’t think that will be necessary," Draco replied. “In fact, I—I just had an idea. Miss Act, if you please, stand over here—” she gestured at a spot in front of the tea table. “—And face the camera.”
Draco could actually see more people laughing in the audience, and on the judges’ panel now.
Lorena dashed off the stage to cheers and applause, tapping Draco on the shoulder as she waited in the wings. “Good luck, bitch! I left you a banana peel on the stage in case you need it,” she winked.
“So that’s all you need to know about boarding school,” she continued. “But at the end of the school year, I would go home for the summer. I was an only child, and had a bedroom all to myself. The silence was deafening,” Draco explained.
“Obviously not, or I would have known about them, wouldn’t I?”
Draco felt...odd. This wasn’t really happening. Potter wasn’t supposed to...what? Approach him? Talk to him like a friend? Ask him out for drinks like this was some kind of date?
“No shit, I saw an owl in our hotel the other night, too!” Kali added, and laughed. “I was just heading to the ice machine when I saw it swooping down the hall towards the front desk.”
“Ta,” Draco sniffed and took a sip from her cocktail. “Really, you all should know I don’t hold it against you. Well,
Draco buried his face in one hand. “I knew the first challenge was going to be a sewing challenge. I was prepared for that,” he confessed as he lifted his head again. “I wasn’t expecting to fuck it up before getting to the sewing part.”
“Maybe
Teddy furrowed his brows in confusion. “You mean you’re not going to be in the show tonight?”
he couldn’t explain.
Draco’s head shot up in surprise. “What?”
Only Draco, Queenie Q, and Carmelita Corazon remained -- the clear bottom three of the week.
“Our twenty-four-year Hogwarts reunion. I know, I know—” he held up his hands in surrender, “I technically didn't stay back for an eighth year like the rest of you, but Blaise, Theo, Pansy, and the rest are all going. Might be fun to get the gang back together.”
“Oh, so he’s gonna bake a cake under the desk?” RuPaul asked. Nicole nodded.
Teddy jumped up and started tugging the zipper in the back of Draco’s gown. “Wow, this is really tight,” he commented. “Have you gotten fat?”
“I know! I’ll do...
Courtney’s face twitched. “Before your time,” she repeated quietly. “And just how long have you been doing drag, dear?” she asked with a tone of false sweetness.
“Crabbe,” he said, feeling suddenly robbed of his eloquence.
Draco spun in place for a few more moments before falling to her knees in front of the judges, holding up the henge at eye level so her face beamed at them from a stone archway.

“You forgot it, didn’t you?” asked Potter. Draco ignored him.

“Check your Twitter messages. Mariah says you’re at the center of a flame war.”

“You know, she was that pilot who disappeared a long time ago?”
Draco grimaced. “Too orange,” he said, then cringed. He had never worn makeup a day in his life and felt no urge to start any time soon.
“That’s our little secret.” Aunt Aura swished her skirts dramatically. “Besides, it's been ages since she passed. She’s moved on, and so should you.”
—Beginning Episode 3—
“Let the music play!”
“Aw, nuts.”
“Of course, Sweetie,” Harry answered. A soft smile overcame the deep lines on his face.
Finally, YAY! I must confess that it’s been difficult for me to focus on this fic while sheltering in place. I did my best writing at work and got most of my inspiration while walking to/from work. But if ever I needed a kick in the pants, it was seeing the teaser for the next episode of Season 12. Would you believe I’ve had this chapter planned since last summer?! Gotta get my version out before RuPaul does! ;-)
Rather than looking perturbed, Goyle tapped his chin thoughtfully. “Do ghosts have sex?
The queens laughed and applauded. Katya waved and headed for the door. “Goodbye...goodbye...goodbye,” she smiled maniacally as she exited.
Steve giggled.
“I think she’s gorgeous, but that piece of fabric was not an outfit,” Michelle declared.
“Not without my daughter,” RuPaul said as Draco returned to the back of the runway.
Granger huffed and cleared her throat. She shot Harry an irritated look, as if it were
“I’m—I’m fine,” Goldie answered after a moment. He shook himself. “Thank you.”
Draco huffed. “Whatever. I stand by my choices.”
“That’s right, honey! A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips!” RuPaul called out encouragingly as Courtney smeared cake across Draco’s barely padded hip. Draco gave as good as she got. All the while, Mike kept taking shot after shot as the two queens each tried to get as much cake onto the other as possible until the cake ran out.
“Ivana!” Intoxia Madison cried as she looked at the departed queen’s lipstick message. “I can’t believe she’s gone. She’s such a legend.”
. The whole piece was so heavy she had had to cast a lightening charm on it just to lift her head up. They slithered around her head in shades of pink and pale green, fanning out in every direction and cascading down her shoulders and torso over a nude illusion, never stopping their movement — except in the muggle photo. Muggles would only see a very realistic-looking imitation.
“Nice work, ladies! Now, switch! Painted ladies, paint your painters!”
Everyone looked at her in silence.
“You’ve each won one thousand dollars and a year’s supply of corn dogs from Bitch on a Stick — where it’s a total sausage party, and everyone’s invited! Paris Davenport, Goldie Hanako, Kali Sister.” The three queens stepped forward.
“I must say,” he frowned, “I had hoped to avoid this type of hassle when I chose not to fly the muggle way.”
Lorena made a funny look. “Is Draco using a cheat sheet?”
Intoxia and Lorena were praised for their looks. The judges didn’t have much to say about their cooking segments on Two Piece and a Biscuit.
high,” Harry added, holding up his hand as measurement.
After some more writhing around on the stage floor, she gracefully rose up to her feet and resumed the pose she had begun the song on.
The judges laughed.
“Gr—”
“Harry, as much as I want to support your baking, I won’t be able to fit into my corset for much longer if you keep bringing me food before a show,” Draco whined.
Emma Watson thought for a moment. “I’m going to say that she uses...a kitchen sponge.”
“Which way is she going?” Michelle asked after Draco performed a pirouette at the edge of the stage.
“This bitch,” Paris rolled his eyes. “Who does she think she’s kidding? She must wanna prove something by having me go on after Venus, but she can think again, because I am going to Turn. It. Out.” He snapped his fingers on each of the last three words.
Draco rolled his eyes and took the item, popping it into his mouth. It was horrible. The things he was willing to do to help a friend, honestly. His reaction must have shown on his face because Potter laughed.
Katya appeared to ponder this question seriously. “Watch out for falling rocks,” she said sagely, “in about two hours.”
She reached forward with her hand, as if to pull herself along an invisible rope closer to the judges.
“Greetings! Thank you all for—”
“Welcome back to Smells Like Fish!” Acacia began again. “Today, I’m here with Draco, who’s going to show us how to make a basic hangover
“Statue she betta don’t!” RuPaul cried.
Lady Cakes laughed and shook his head. “Whatever! Just let me know when they start probing people. I wanna be around for that.”
They shrugged.
Draco blinked. “NMCS?”
“All right, they would hang bears outside their windows, because they’re so gay! Let’s see if we have a match from any of our celebrities. Jameela Jamil, how did you answer?”
Suddenly, he was caught up in a river of muggles. They all appeared to be walking purposefully in the same direction — and admittedly, looking just as tired and annoyed as Draco felt. Draco summoned his courage and joined the flow of traffic down one long corridor after another until he came into a larger area with glass doors to the outside. Beyond the doors, he could see muggle vehicles starting and stopping. What were they called again? Art-o-motors? Carmobiles?
“But really, I’d like to talk to you about an experience that I’m sure we
Later that day, Draco stood at a worktable, puzzling over the largesse of Courtney Act’s vengeance spread before him.
—Confessional—
“Well, you know, drag itself is a type of magic,” RuPaul explained. “We’re all turning ourselves into women with some duct tape and a bit of paint and powder. And that’s really the kind of ingenuity we’re looking for in this challenge.” The queens nodded. “Do you have a narrative for your act?”
Goldie hooted. “Oh, no Ma’am! She must be
It was respectful enough that Draco could forgive her appropriation of a tiara made from chunky amethyst crystals, which was the sign of a graduate of the Salem Witch Institute. Kali had probably borrowed it from her aunt for the occasion.
Crabbe laughed. “Sorry, but you’re not my type.”
“There’s so much she doesn’t know,” Steve added.
“Your portkey arrived just as American flight 135 from Heathrow sent passenger luggage to baggage claim,” she explained. “You’ll need to go out that door—” she pointed to an Exit sign beyond her kiosk— “and you will see people coming out of Customs and heading toward Ground Transportation. Follow the flow of traffic and you will eventually see airport exits. Do you have a ride picking you up?”
“Draco,” Goldie said, “You’ve had a good run so far on
“That’s nice.”
The tension in the room hit a breaking point when Kali said, “Holy crap, I feel like I got good critiques tonight!” She ran a hand along her shoulder-length auburn wig, pleased with herself.
"Well, RuPaul, as you may know, I've retired from the
Later, in the Untucked Lounge, the queens discussed the critiques they had been given. Kali was unable to disguise her glee at having received enough praise this week that she didn’t fear for her own safety.
“Oh!” Goyle snapped his fingers. “Now that I think about it, there was something about a prophecy about you at Hogwarts, wasn’t there? Maybe you could be on the lookout for Wife Number Two! But at our age, I guess you’re not going to find someone young enough at the reunion, eh? We’ve all aged out of that demographic, haven’t we?” He winked.

“And to think you had it all this time,” Potter sighed, still frowning. “Malfoy, this book is dangerous. It needs to be destroyed.”
“Do you need me to say it?” Lorena answered.
“I’m not sure what I was thinking, taking on this part,” Venus muttered. “It’s one thing to just say a long line of bullshit, but it’s another thing to have to remember when someone else says it! I thought I’d only have to say ‘Multipass’!”
Draco blushed. Thinking about Potter in that way was...a

“You will be coached by legendary singer, actor, dancer, and choreographer Todric Hall.”
“There will be time for bribing the judges
“Ms. Flygirl, what experiences from your past make you qualified to be America’s first drag president?”
“Whoa,” Steve seemed genuinely impressed. “I’ve always wanted to be visited by aliens!”
Paris ran her fingers up and down a stalk of bok choi. “Yass, you betta sissy that bok!” RuPaul exclaimed.
“Can I hug you?” he asked.
Suddenly overcome by a feeling of kinship, Draco lifted the spider closer to his face and smirked. “I shall make you my drag daughter,” he told it, “And I shall call you Araneus.”
“Well, hello RuPaul, it certainly is a pleasure to be here!”
From this perspective, it was possible to see both looks simultaneously. The high collars on either side met in a diamond clasp at the center of the neck. The hair was parted down the middle, the chignon wig only covering the right side. Down the center of the chest was a heart, as a cut-out half-heart showing skin on the gown side and a half-heart-shaped lapel on the left side that revealed a white tuxedo shirt underneath. The rest of the outfit met in a smooth seam down the middle of the torso before dividing between the trouser leg and the skirt.
“Acacia Davenport, you are one fierce queen. And I know your career is really going to cook after this.” Acacia nodded stiffly. “Now, sashay away.”
“Morning,” Draco answered politely, forced to a stop. He recognized her as one of the crew assistants on the show.
“Cheeky!” Rupaul exclaimed.
Draco sat at one end of a large table. Framed posters from previous seasons of
“Hi, Ru!” They all replied simultaneously.
“First Up! Category is…Beach Blanket Realness!” RuPaul announced.
“You know Paul Hollywood is actually straight, right?” Harry had whispered in Draco’s ear.
“Now! This week, we’re going to have a ball — and it’s Queens! Queens! Queens across the world!” RuPaul announced. The queens all cheered.
Cheers erupted from  the audience.
Previously on DDR: Draco makes an enemy of Courtney Act during an ill-fated photo shoot and fails to wow the judges with her haute coutoure rectangle.
“On one condition,” Draco continued, “I want to see Harry Slytherin, too.”
Draco blushed. “Er—”
“I don’t really have a performance spot,” Draco admitted.
“During the rehearsal,” he admitted.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, um, as a choreographer, I have directed teams of drag dancers to learn their moves, and that’s like herding cats. So if I can do that, I can work with Capitol Hill. I will get Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer to bop, mop, and shablam until we have our country all moving in sync.” Venus shimmied at the podium.
Draco didn’t need a crystal ball to anticipate the shouting match that followed those words.
She shrugged. Let Rita Skeeter write what she would. Draco was beyond caring what the

this would entail.
“Speak for yourself, Son!” Harry shot back.
The pair proceeded to go from table to table, asking each queen about their campaign slogans. Draco overheard them discussing phrases like student loan forgiveness, taxing the wealthy, and other concepts that didn’t fit easily into his reality.
Draco grinned. “You should have seen Courtney Act.”
“There’s only one way to find out,” Harry said. “Let’s go look!”
The edge of Steve’s lip quirked up slightly at that. She still looked defeated, so Draco wracked her brain for something else to say. Her eyes landed on Ursa Minor, perched on her shelf, still wearing a miniature safari outfit and pith helmet.
“Start from the top,” Michelle directed.
“What do you think?” Draco asked.
Draco waved his hands and stood up, walking away from the vanity. He paced back and forth, his kimono swishing rapidly as he tried to calm down.
“You can pull it out of the stand,” Vilanch interrupted. “Or adjust it. Either way, we need to be able to
“More is more?” Draco had the good grace to look sheepish. She turned to RuPaul and explained, “It’s

One week later, Harry received the owl to let him know that Malfoy had the documents ready for his signature, and to come to his office.
“YES!” a few people cried in the audience. Applause filled the Bent Unicorn.
Kali answered with the world’s crunchiest cockney accent. “Thank you, RuPaul, I think I must be in the Great Place, because it’s great to be here!”
Draco had opted for his idea of a “power outfit” to build his confidence going into the challenge: a three-piece suit made from a kelly-green brocade patterned with gold dragons, a matching green shirt, a gold tie fastened with a snake tie pin made from small peridots, and a gold pocket square.
“Hi, Draco! Made any progress yet?”
Draco followed him. “Is four a small number for luggage?”
“I think it’s a very out-of-the-box approach,” Ya Kid K offered kindly.
“Tonight, you will see things that you won’t believe…” Draco said.
“There’s no need to be embarrassed! How many times did we see each other in the dorms at school?”
Of course, having arrived dressed in such a multitude of buttons, a tie, and tie pin meant that Draco took longer to undress, and was barely able to throw a long blonde wig on her head before the time ran out.
Myrtle appeared to be considering this. “Well, I suppose if you must, you must,” she sighed. “Though it would be such a waste. We don’t have many teenage ghosts around here.”
Goldie made a big show of interacting with the audience before stuffing a long, thin balloon down her throat. Paris and Draco built up the moment by interacting with the audience, which cheered even more enthusiastically.
Draco quickly downed her drink while the other queens continued to argue about the commercials like too many cats trapped in a very small bin. She then got up and slipped out the door to the parking lot for some fresh air and fellow air signs.
Goldie Hanako laughed. “Girl, she really did wanna get her money’s worth out of that prosthetic, didn’t she?”
I find out that she’s a blonde...who wears
Draco turned and stared at him.
“I don’t really sound like that...do I?” Draco asked the producer behind the camera. “Why aren’t you answering?”
Goldie-as-George-Takei waved. “Thank you! I would like to remind everybody that it is okay to be Takei!”
After they left, Draco turned back to the passage in the book and found a statement that would cause an unfortunate complication in the plan:
Finally, it was Draco’s turn. He donned the pink, starry sunglasses and cracked his knuckles.
“If you have a hunger for something
Draco ended the call and carefully eased out of the hearth, his knees complaining. Once he stood up, his thoughts drifted back to the idea of a Hogwarts reunion and seeing Potter again, and he smacked his palm against his forehead.

“Of course! Now, shoo. Mama needs her mirror time.”
Once the microphone lesson was squared away, Draco ran through his entire routine and got some pointers on content and delivery before the time was up. Draco thanked him and went back to the workroom.
“And I’m Draco!”
“Team Venus, I’m sorry, my dears, but all of you are up for elimination.”
Carrie Fisher. I didn’t want to disrespect her memory by making a lot of stupid jokes at her expense,” she huffed.
“Goldie Hanako, same question.”
So he kept to himself.
Of course, any and all kudos and comments are greatly appreciated. Thank you!
“Baker! You have five minutes left!” Draco hollered into a thick cloud of flour that had overtaken the kitchen.
,” Lady Cakes cried. “I am so gonna burn in hell for this.” He cackled.
“This ain’t illegal, is it?” Lady Cakes asked.
Draco was now an expert at answering all manners of phone. The ringing sound resumed, and Draco picked up the phone—properly this time.
“Let’s move on. This question is for Jason,” RuPaul continued. “The city of San Francisco is so gay,” RuPaul said, “Instead of flags, they hang
“Like there was any chance of that! I just knew.” Draco smiled and grabbed Harry’s hand. Their hands were old and wrinkled now, with a few liver spots here and there. “There was always something about you, and once I had you back in my life, I wasn’t about to let you leave again.”
“Crabbe? Oh yeah, I’ve seen him,” Weasley said.
for death. And I’ve had a rough day, so I would be absolutely
“Two queens stand before me,” RuPaul said to Lorena and Kali. “Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life! Now, good luck, and don’t fuck it up!”
“Amen!” The queens cheered.
“But I’m not a drag expert,” Granger interjected.
“I--- er--- well,” Harry stammered. His face took on the color of a ripe tomato.
She let out a blood-curdling scream and leaped behind Acacia, then swiveled her around and steered her bodily toward the exit.
“Acacia Davenport, you are a queen who knows how to serve a heated look, but this week, your performance was...undercooked. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.” Acacia nodded and sniffled into her glove.
That afternoon, the Team Venus queens walked onto the main stage in boy clothes and high heels to learn their choreography.
Malfoy dropped his quill. “What in Merlin’s name for?!”
Lady Cakes McMansion laughed. “Girl, she means twelve more to beat before she wins the crown.” A few queens laughed as they began shedding wigs and false eyelashes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“YES,” cried Venus, Goldie, and Lady Cakes.
Draco performed a lip sync to Lady Gaga’s “Bad Romance,” which the manager of the Bent Unicorn had requested since many customers had missed the first episode. After the audience reactions during the episode, she wasn’t too surprised to hear people cheering her on during the number. The cheers spurred her on and she felt more confident in her performance.
“I’m sure that only applies to
“Bloody fuck!” Harry appeared on the other side of the kitchen island, a white spectre with flour covering his clothes, apron, hair, and glasses. His hands, mysteriously, were bright blue.
Blaise, Greg, and Theo were still glaring, which only made the girls laugh harder.
Draco sighed and turned to face the wall. His forehead hit the plaster with a loud
—Confessional—
Draco smiled. “Thanks — I really like your pyramid, too.”
What was the most striking about her look, however, was her makeup. She had painted her face an almost white shade with pink circles on her cheeks and tiny lips. Her left eye was transfigured entirely black. A large black gash was painted across her face, from her left temple, down through the black eye, across her nose — which was largely missing, painted as a larger black hole —  and across the other cheek, ending at the back of her jaw.
“Condragulations, girls,” RuPaul told the remaining queens. “You are all one step closer to becoming America’s next drag superstar. And remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an Amen!”
“Welcome to Draco’s kitchen!” she spoke to the camera. “Today, I’m going to show you how to make a basic hangover potion.”
“James, Al, and Lily were away at Hogwarts,” he continued, explaining to the grandchildren (and a few great-grandchildren who had snuck into the room when the responsible adults weren’t paying attention. “Draco had already lost his own wife, Victoria--”
The others all agreed. The rest of the conversation dissolved into small talk as they changed out of drag, the aches from their heels and tucks setting in as the high energy of Elimination Day waned.
“Now Draco, I heard that Kali wanted Venus to pick you for their team. Why do you suppose he chose Lorena instead?” RuPaul asked, stirring the pot immediately.
” Draco explained. “She’s a rich teenage girl with charm and cunning and I can get behind that. And
Venus sighed and buried his face in his hand. “Well, this is a real a shitshow,” he told the camera. “Lady Cakes is fighting gravity real hard, but I can tell she trying. But Intoxia and Steve both have terminal cases of White Girl Dancing Syndrome. And it must be contagious, because Kali seems to be catching it, too.”
“Let’s leave some things a mystery,” Draco said.
RuPaul laughed, and Draco relaxed.
Millicent nodded. “Safety in numbers, right? I’ve been following the drama in
“‘Sorry Carrie!’” Steve Donovan read from Intoxia’s lipstick message on the mirror. “‘Best luck to all of you, xoxo Intoxia. PS Kim Cardassian 4evah!’”
Draco nodded.
“Tomorrow on the main stage, you will have a debate so that America can decide how to cast their votes in our new Frock the Vote challenge. You should have a campaign slogan, and a strong idea what kind of platform you’re running on, so that you can field questions from our panelists in the debate.
“You’re a good egg, Draco.” Crabbe flashed a translucent smile. He started to drift towards the window. “But if you’re out of sorts about not seeing your friends, maybe you should try getting out more,” he suggested.
“Potter,” Malfoy nodded stiffly. “What are you doing on Pendleton’s floor?”
“This week’s challenge is to come up with a telly commercial,” Draco explained. “Our team is going to advertise RuPaul’s Thick-n-Juicy Chicken. I’ve never sold anything before, but I’m confident in my powers of persuasion. I know we can turn this out.”
“Draco is really feeling herself tonight!” Ross chirped.
Who’s watching Drag Race UK? I’m trying not to let it influence this work, since I started working on it long before I heard of the show. But I’m watching it anyway, because Drag Race UK. What are your thoughts on the show? Got any favorites? With more British queens, Draco’s got more competition for Snatch Game characters. It’s not like he knows that many famous muggles… :-D
audition video.
“Some of the queens have played male characters on Snatch Game.”
Draco was washing his hands in the loo when a wizard he’d never met suddenly apparated into the room.
But if Astoria had only come back as a ghost, maybe he wouldn’t have to feel so lonely.
The queens stumbled into the werkroom after Acacia Davenport’s departure.
“Say, are you planning to go to the reunion for our Eighth-Year class next Saturday?” Potter asked, effectively ruining Draco’s plan by changing the conversation.
This week: The competition takes a magical turn when the queens perform a magic show for a live audience! (See the Notes at the beginning for a summary of the rest of the fic, should you need it :-)
Draco-as-Mary-Berry picked up a fork and took a bite, then made a face. “Is this rum cake? I can’t taste the alcohol.”
Draco shook his head. “I don’t get racism,” he muttered. “Of all the things to judge someone for, why pick skin color?”
Most of them were quite dark even for Malfoy standards. He had found multiple instructions on rites for preventing someone from moving on to the afterlife when they died for various nefarious purposes — the weirdest of which was on using spirits as sources of energy in the kitchen.
Several people in the pub guffawed. Harry quirked an eyebrow and smirked at Draco.
“Lord! Oh, forgive
—Confessional—
“Oh my God, who are you and what have you done with Draco?” Venus laughed. “This queen is acting goofy as hell! I have never seen her laugh so much. It’s like she’s never seen a magic trick before in her life.”
?” The idiot blinked at him in confusion. He apparently hadn’t expected any of them to actually confront him. His friend remained silent and watched the two of them, smirking.
About the flame war: apparently there is a vocal segment of Drag Race fans who have been harassing black queens from the show. This article shares some of those experiences: https://www.buzzfeed.com/benhenry/rupauls-drag-race-fandom-racism
Draco blinked, then furrowed his eyebrows in annoyance. “Well, of course that too!”
“Draco—! Queenie Q!” RuPaul addressed them. “Ladies, this is your last chance — to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync...for your life!”
This was exactly why purebloods didn’t like muggleborns entering the wizarding world. They inevitably told their families, who inevitably wanted
“Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!” Draco jumped up and down and waved her arm in the air harder than Hermione Granger. “Let me use the wand!”
Draco made tiny steps, almost hopping forward. She stopped halfway up the runway. With a dramatic movement, she strained her arms until the ropes broke. (They had been designed to be broken easily, of course.) She reached behind her and pulled at the stake, which turned out to be none other than her old Nimbus 2001 broomstick. She stepped away from the pile of twigs, held her broomstick confidently up in the air, and laughed wickedly.
“It’s like, it’s funny but you don’t even know
Steve, on the other hand, received criticism for her failure to lead the group — partly by letting Acacia get away without cooking anything, and partly for not doing a better job to control the train wreck that was Draco’s part of the act. It seemed unfair to Draco, but Steve then received high praise for her eighteenth-century Parisian courtesan look on the runway.
“Come on, I bet you’re a champion lip syncer. Let’s go over your plan for this song, just in case.”
Draco sighed. “Goodbye, Queenie Q,” she said as she began cleaning, wiping until the words became a blurry pink smear and deciding it was good enough. “That’s one queen down, twelve more to go!”
“How interesting,” Draco commented blandly. He would have to be careful the next time he came out here first thing in the morning. He didn’t feel particularly keen on the idea of becoming wampus food.
“You’re horrible and I refuse to encourage you.”

He was just about to give up his search when he rifled through a book titled
“Portkey, please,” a wizard said to him, and Draco handed over the little rubber duck he had traveled with.
“Now, for your maxi challenge this week, we’re going to play a different kind of game,” RuPaul continued. “Wait for it… wait for it… SNATCH GAME!”
He sighed as reality hit him. He was lying awake in bed, his arms twisted in the sheets.
Janet Jackson oohed and applauded. “I see, Stonehenge really does keep track of the time! When Draco’s on her knees, it must be solstice,” she said.
. Those were two words that should never go together. The latest issue of
of you think to cast a Silencing charm?!”
A few minutes later, Team Paris went to their own rehearsal, and Team Venus collapsed into chairs and took off their heels, rubbing sore feet.
Draco
On the set, Acacia interacted with each queen in turn for Smells Like Fish, alternating between chatting with the cooks and asking questions about the steps in the process.
“My legendary children, a Drag Race superstar needs to develop a pretty thick skin. So, in the grand tradition of
Draco turned to Granger, who blushed. “This is about shattering the glass ceiling,” she repeated, albeit more bashfully than earlier. Draco turned back to the shirtless celebrity impersonator.
“This week, you will all be serving us your best jokes in a stand-up routine before a live audience!”
Draco frowned.
know you got that name because of how thick you apply your makeup.” Lady Cakes barked in laughter.
“Uh—”
The conversation died down while a few of Harry’s grandchildren passed around slices of a large cake in the shape of a snitch.
Draco threw his arms around him and gave him a long, fiery kiss. When they finally pulled apart, Harry continued, “Promise me you won’t get too upset if you don’t get cast to be on the show? You’ll be competing against thousands of queens who have been doing this for years.”
Millicent shook her head. “No, I mean, aren’t there women who pretend to be men?”
“It’s about talking to the audience,” Goldie explained. “You need to talk to the camera and give instructions so people who watch the show know how to make your recipe."
The queens entered the stage for the main challenge, dressed in their presidential debate attire. Draco had opted for a royal blue suit without a blouse, revealing a deep vee of pale skin underneath her jacket. Her blonde wig was pulled into braids wrapped into an elegant Dutch crown around her head.
wearing chains? Or Myrtle?”
So...what did you think? Who was your favorite celebrity in this chapter? Which queen would you have chosen to win the challenge, based on how they performed in Snatch Game? As always, I value all your comments and kudos. Thanks again for sticking with this fic!
“My eyes are up here, Harry.”
No answer was necessary, however, as another queen walked into the room at that moment.
“I used to play quidditch in school, too,” she informed him. “Chaser for Wampus House. You know, we actually have a wampus cat here on the island. It comes out at night. Sometimes we see it roaming around the park in the early hours.”
Draco’s feet landed with a loud
“Maybe you should take up the pottery wheel,” Professor Burbage suggested one day when he was feeling particularly morose.
“Malfoy, wait!”
“Even though she already knew that much, since I’d given her a huge thank-you bouquet of flowers after you first found it.”
“I was groomed for it,” Draco admitted, pausing with a lip liner pencil in her hand. “My father expected me to enter the Ministry someday, so I was trained in diplomacy, economics, and twelve other languages…” he drifted off, taken back to a simpler time in his childhood when he felt like he knew what life had in store for him. The conversation moved on to other topics as Draco reflected on that road not taken.
Draco sighed and tapped a pen on his empty notepad.
“Greg says he’s going to the reunion. So are Blaise and Pansy, Theo, Daphne, and even Millicent.”
But there was no such excuse for cheering up a depressed Steve, forgiving Kali for attempted blackmail, even saving Goldie from a randomly belligerent bigot on the street.
Eventually, the queens began shedding their wigs and dresses and taking off makeup. Draco’s head turned abruptly when he heard Lady Cakes gasp in pain at the clothing rack next to his.
“Ooh, I wouldn’t mind seeing your cat sometime,” Venus-as-Amelia-Earhart said, waggling her eyebrows. She turned to RuPaul. “Back in my day, we used to call that a
“Why, Ru, I got all the booty you need!” Lady-Cakes-as-Nicole-Byer got up and turned around, bending over at the waist so her derriere was on full display.
,” she explained to her specifically. The woman laughed, a little red-faced, but didn’t appear to mind the attention. Draco felt truly fired up now, hearing more laughter.
The wizarding world was small. Draco was still struggling to believe there were more than 500,000 people in the world, let alone muggles on Instagram who cared about drag queens. Draco had more followers paying attention to her than she had ever dreamt possible. This was
After Lady Cakes went back to his room, Draco picked up the letter the owl had delivered and sat down on his bed. The source wasn’t a mystery; Draco had recognized the Malfoy crest on the envelope immediately. He opened it with some trepidation.
it’s funny.” Goldie cried. She frantically waved her hands in front of her face. “Oh my god, I’m gonna mess up my eye makeup!”
“CUT!” Draco looked to Michelle.
Draco remembered being in Sixth Year and privately wondering if the prophecy meant he was destined to fall in love with Moaning Myrtle.
Harry grinned and signed. “Thanks, Malfoy,” he said, and stuck out his hand.
Lady Cakes laughed again. “Ooh, this gives me an idea,” she looked thoughtful and tapped her pen again. “Hold on, Lorena, what were you about to say?”
The Auror laughed, tilting her head back. “Oh, sorry, don’t take offense! I usually prefer chasing criminals, solving cases that save lives – you know, the stuff most people join the Aurors to do. Watching out to make sure you don’t violate the statute of secrecy isn’t exactly on the same par, you know?” The wind whipped a long lock of dark hair from her ponytail over her shoulder. She shook her head, sending it backwards and swishing in the other direction.
had changed since school,” he clarified.
“She almost threw me out of the shop then and there,” Draco added, “Told me she didn’t run a ‘happy endings massage parlor,’ in her words. I had to do some fast talking to convince her.”
Paris had chosen the Sphinx and made a glittering gold dress with paw-shaped mittens, a tail, and a lavish headdress. She had even styled her makeup to look like a chunk had been taken out of her nose. Lady Cakes had similarly gone for an Egyptian look, but designed a pyramid-shaped dress that flared out from her neck.
Draco was surprised to feel a pang of loss at Cindy’s departure. She hadn’t gotten to know Queenie Q at all at the beginning, and really hadn’t warmed up to Carmelita Corazon — but Cindy had been an upbeat, cheerful presence in the workroom.
“Okay, let’s just start writing down some dialogue and see if it gels into anything,” Goldie said, sounding just as rattled as Draco felt.
been this quiet,” Venus said. The camera panned across the werkroom to show everyone seated at tables, heads bent over notebooks and tapping their pens. “Everyone is digging deep inside their brains trying to come up with something funny. No pressure!” He laughed nervously.
“Yes. Well, cheers. Erm,” Draco blustered. She looked around, trying to figure out what to do instead. She looked to Acacia for ideas, but Acacia looked equally baffled.
, you are the winner of this week’s maxi challenge.” Ivana’s jaw dropped. She beamed and nodded her head in gratitude.
The camera panned out to reveal that Narcissa was sitting on a sofa next to Draco’s Aunt Andromeda, who smiled and waved. Next to her was Teddy, practically bouncing in his seat, smiling and waving as hard as he could from underneath a turquoise bouffant. And next to him was Harry — Harry, who continued to stun Draco with his unflagging love and support.
“In order for it to work, we need everyone who was nearby when he died to join in a circle.” He pulled out his wand and drew a black circle on the floor, gesturing for the others to stand around it. Potter and Weasley looked to Granger-Weasley, who shrugged back at them, and they joined the circle.
“What gets me is how Kali could be in the same room with three British people and still not be able to fake a British accent,” Michelle said. “I mean, talk about Amy Winehouse! Kali’s Jameela Jamil made Yara Sofia’s Amy Winehouse sound authentic.”
“Two queens stand before me,” RuPaul said. “Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life! Now, good luck, and don’t fuck it up!”
“That’s a line from
“Thanks, Lady! I’m just glad to live another day, you know?”
“Draco, you gotta be the queen of bullshit!” Lady Cakes laughed.
,” Draco interrupted. “Starsss. Galaxiesss. Bitch, I have my own constellation!” With that, Draco crossed her left hand to her right hip and began tracing the arc of the constellation Draco up, over her head, down the other side, and back up, ending with a snap of her fingers.
“I’m giving you Stonehenge as it was meant to be seen,” Draco said. “This is no pile of fallen rocks, but a vibrant work of art.”
“You don’t know that.”
Goldie and Draco waved their hands on either side of Paris, hyping the moment. “Magic!” they cried. The audience applauded.
” Draco repeated. “All those other henges are utter rubbish.”
“All right, Ms. Goldie Hanako.”
“I’m shook,” Kali admitted. “I’m not proud of the way I behaved in that last challenge. I know I’m gonna have to do better this next time around.”
Later on, the queens sat in the workroom, tapping pencils to notepads as they tried to think up campaign ideas.
“Welcome back, Ladies. I’ve made some decisions,” RuPaul began after the queens reassembled at the front of the stage. “Lorena Gucci, you are safe.” Lorena nodded her thanks and retreated to the back.
was shady,” he whispered in Draco’s ear.
confused.”
for beta-ing this fic!
“I’m going to say...Kali!” Kali grinned and walked over to where Venus and Lady Cakes were standing.
“What’s this about a prophecy? Did someone make a prophecy about you?”
“I died on the grand staircase,” Aunt Aura chimed in. “It was rather gruesome. I could show you a reenactment, if you like.”
kind of curveball. Everyone knows the team captain is the one who goes home if the group doesn’t pull its shit together. If we end up in the bottom, these bitches better watch out.”
“Kali Sister, Venus Flygirl,” RuPaul said, “You're safe.” The pair nodded and went to the back.
When it was her turn, Draco gracefully glided down the runway. Her ball gown was strapless in a shade of sky-blue satin patterned with white crystals and a full-circle skirt in grass-green crepe. Her wig was fashioned into rosebud-braid buns at the back of her head accented with small crystals, but what really stood out on her head was the large golden headband with beams radiating outward in a halo like a sunburst. It, too, was decorated with crystals to give it extra shine.
As luck would have it, Draco had gotten a letter about the reunion
“You should go! I bet you haven’t seen any of our old chums in years. Don’t you wonder what everyone’s been up to lately?”
“Welcome, ladies!” RuPaul began, after the queens lined up at the front of the stage. “We’ve all watched your debate. Now, it’s time for some political analysis from our judges. Let’s start with Goldie Hanako.”
Potter blinked. “She did, actually.”
Acacia was grilled for not actually cooking anything, and failing to be entertaining.
“You’re going to be Mary Berry, from
“Well we don’t need to hear you bragging about it!” Lorena snapped. The other queens exchanged shocked looks.
be the one calling the shots here.”
Lorena had incorporated several bananas into a risqué routine. It was more performance art than comedy, but the audience (mostly gay men from various LGBT advocacy groups) appreciated what she could do to a banana without gagging, so that worked in her favour.
in the moment
“Boo.”
are you dressing up like
“I went to a boarding school in Scotland for seven years of my adolescence, from age eleven to seventeen. The school was in a castle, and my room was in a part of the dungeon next to the lake. We had glass windows that were underwater so we could look out and see the fish. Sounds quite lovely, does it not?”
That was easy enough for her to say. She hadn’t had her name taken away.
“How was I supposed to know?” Harry cried in frustration.
. He had been helping his competitors more than he would have expected. It forced him to wonder if he was losing his strategic, Slytherin edge.
“Lipstick?” Crabbe asked in confusion. “How is that going to help?”
“But if you don’t mind, could we go to my room to apply it?” This was awkward. Why had he brought the potion with him?
Before too long, RuPaul announced that they only had a minute left. Goldie yelped and quadrupled his speed. Draco tried hard not to flinch.
RuPaul laughed. “All right, so tell me, what do you all have planned for your magic show?”
“Language, Potter. There shall be no fucks given on the BBC!”
Draco shook his head. “Maybe it was Your Tube, or Video Tube. There’s a tube in there somewhere.”
“Gone?!”
Draco explained the story of Aethelwynne. The judges silently nodded and jotted down notes.
“There’s still seven of us.” Paris Davenport commented. There was a faint edge of bitterness to her tone. “I really thought I would have sent another one of you bitches home this week.”
“No, I don’t think so. Anyway, that’s beside the point. How long have you known and you haven’t bloody told me?”
granted me permission to appear on the show as long as I don’t perform
They walked down the hall and down the stairs towards the kitchen.
Bulstrode grinned.
Who’s watching RPDR Season 12? What do you think of all the wild drama so far? I mean, RuPaul’s wearing giant hats again! OMG!!! LOL, I won’t give any real spoilers here, but feel free to comment if you want to get your own opinions out. (And should I have RuPaul wear a big, loud fedora in the next episode of DDR?)
Trigger warning for Lucius Malfoy being homophobic / transphobic / Lucius Malfoy. If that’s not what you’re here for, then skip the scene just after the one with Harry’s patronus and scroll ahead to the scene after it, or Control + F / Command + F to “Yeah, the owls are a problem.”
Draco jumped and dodged and wove up and down and back and forth. All those years of playing quidditch at Hogwarts had seemingly led up to this moment. The Slytherin seeker had always been a popular target for other teams’ beaters. His eyes easily followed multiple balls whizzing around him.
“What?” RuPaul asked in a mock whisper, “Is Paul Hollywood
! Everyone knew that! And what in Merlin’s name did she mean by “copyright clearance?”
“Well maybe I didn’t find it funny.” Steve huffed.
“Why, what happened?” Paris asked. Draco sighed.
“Ms. Sister, as the first drag president, how would you redecorate the White House?”
“You are all safe,” RuPaul told them. Paris sighed in relief. “You may leave the stage.” Paris, Goldie, and Steve left the stage.
Draco was in a muggle vehicle and it was
“I shared a room with four other boys, nine months of the year, for seven years. Now, let’s take a moment and think about eleven-to-seventeen-year-old boys. There was something we all did in that room, and it wasn’t studying.
“I wouldn’t. He’s working on speed this round. He won’t be ready to interact with a camera crew until at least next week.” Draco steered them back out of the room.
The funny thing about trying to translate a phrase like “turn it on and back off again” into a language that didn’t have a concept for on/off is that every single person I asked gave me a completely different translation. Linguistically, it’s fascinating, and I’m grateful for every suggestion, even if I could only use one of them.
; he had slipped it into her suitcase before leaving London. Draco’s lipstick was now printed at the bottom next to Harry’s signature.
“Paint me like one of your French girls!” Intoxia lip synced, and launched into her pole dancing solo. It looked like a struggle, as she was wearing a tight ankle-length dress and a large, floppy hat.
“Neither do I, Ru!” Draco confessed in exasperation.
—At the Viewing Party—
“Well, I’m not religious, you see,” Draco tried to explain. “So I’m not one to say things like ‘Thank God’ or the like. While I’m on this show, I want to keep my exclamations drag relevant.”
Draco lunged forward and pulled her into a hug. “What are you doing here?”
“Draco, I know this reading challenge is going to be a struggle for you because it goes against British manners, so let me help you,” Lorena said, then switched to a high-pitched British accent before continuing, “Lorena, I couldn’t possibly read you!”
It was a British muggle journal focused on LGBTQ issues. The headline on the front page read:
“Draco—, you served us uniqueness with your red carpet look tonight on the runway. But if you don’t watch out, these other queens will walk all over you,” RuPaul admonished. Draco braced herself and gave RuPaul a steady look and a stiff upper lip. “Draco—, you are safe.” Draco let out a breath she didn’t know she had been holding and curtsied before walking to the back of the stage.
Paris fixed Steve with some stinkeye. “Bitch,
“I grew up in the Wiltshire countryside, just a stone’s throw away from the
make that reference?”
“Not yet,” Draco answered. “Would you mind sending in Shangela next? I’d like to pick her brain.” Steve and Lorena snapped their heads in his direction and looked nervous.
Draco raised an eyebrow in response.
“I didn’t want to spoil the surprise.”
“Thanks! I swear it won’t happen again.” Kali grinned. “So, what do you think we’ll have to do for this week’s episode? I hope it’s not another sewing challenge!”
“Oh my God!” Goldie exclaimed, sitting next to him. He placed a protective hand on Draco’s wrist, moving so quickly that Draco jumped from the sudden contact. “Are you okay?”
Crabbe, however, was not perturbed. He positively waggled his eyebrows and floated over to her. He held out his elbow, which she wrapped her hand around.
“Oh, Cindy!” Venus Flygirl cried, then squinted at the mirror. “What did she do, write a novel?”
“So then Draco says, ‘What were you expecting, rose petals for the Bloody Savior?’” Harry addressed their audience again, this time doing an impression of a patented Draco Malfoy sneer. Draco snorted.
Eventually, the queens were summoned back onto the stage and formed a line facing the judges.
is your bedroom?!’” he continued in an overwrought imitation of Harry’s voice.
“Kill it! Kill it!” Venus cried.
“Okay, I’m taking Leeloo,” Venus continued. “Now, we have Rose Dawson from
The voice laughed. “Sure, put her on.”
Ivana shrugged again and took another puff. “Meh, you’re really better off if you don’t get into it,” she told Draco. “Some nights, it feels like half of the money I make in the clubs goes toward these things. I just haven’t been able to kick the habit.”
When we were filming Star Wars, I went through the crew like wildfire. I slept with everyone, down to the last stormtrooper.”
“Is that all?” Draco rolled his eyes. “If we were still in school, you would be kicked out of Slytherin for that.”
“Maybe we need to figure out what kind of act we’re gonna have first,” Goldie said. “Then that’ll help us figure out what kind of magic we should do, right?”
“I can certainly say that I have no memory of an alien encounter last night,” Draco said.
“Kali’s going to be in the bottom, I’m sure of it. That corn outfit was hideous!” Acacia declared.
“Good luck, and don’t fuck it up!”
Draco had trouble making sense of these words over a roaring in his ears.
“Your mother has given her permission for you to use her maiden name as your surname,” Simmons explained. “From now on, you may identify yourself to others as Draco Black.”
“That was sweet, what your mom said.” Lady Cakes McMansion took collapsed on the sofa with a heavy sigh. “Girl, I thought you were gonna jump out of your skin when you saw that video.”
win!” Lady Cakes McMansion grinned from ear to ear as she removed her Wonder Woman headband and wig. “Crown it, baby!”
choose the order in which the queens will perform. Gentlemen, start your engines...and may the funniest bitch win!”
Kali grinned. “Aliens!”
Underneath Draco’s pith helmet was a light-brown wig pulled into a loose braid down her back. She had attached Courtney Act’s stuffed koala to the braid so Ursa Minor was indeed along for the ride, complete with her own matching outfit, braid, and pith helmet.
“I’m...still brainstorming ideas.”
, a thin strip of white fabric wrapped around her head to imitate a Greco-Roman statue. On her feet, she wore gold stiletto sandals with gold cords that wrapped back and forth up her legs to tie at the knees. A gold armband in the shape of a snake hugged her upper arm.
“Once I saw how the other girls were wearing lots of jewels, I did switch to some sparklier jewelry.” She pointed at her diamond choker and earrings.
It was a truth universally unacknowledged that Harry Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, was bad at math.
“'Love you all, no hard feelings!’” Draco read aloud, “‘And watch out for those banana peels!’ Indeed,” she snorted.
“You just weren’t used to dressing in anything other than extreme casual wear,” Draco retorted.
Venus cried in relief and headed to the back of the stage.
Draco’s unease did not let up as they walked up to the seventh-floor corridor.
“He doesn’t, does he?” Draco sighed. “Well anyway, would you be willing to help?”
“Your luggage exceeds the limitation for Extension charms in no-mag society.”
“Malfoy!”
—Before the Viewing Party—
“Ah, yes, of course.” She nodded. “I’ll just...answer...the dumb phone.” She picked the lumpy device off of the table.
“Lorena Gucci, I’m sorry, my dear, but this is not your time. Now, sashay away.”
What happened to the ball gag?
Draco pulled Harry’s letter from her bosom and showed it to her. Kali’s eyebrows raised in surprise. Intoxia Madison peered over her shoulder.
Potter just shrugged. “Maybe I’ve missed having you in my life? You made up such a big part of it when we were in Hogwarts.” He looked Draco up and down. “And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find you just as attractive as I did back then.”
“And then Theo, Blaise, Millicent, Pansy, Daphne…” Crabbe counted on his fingers. “Marcus, Anthony — you know, he used to help me with Charms — and, oh yeah, George and Ron.”
“Thank you, ladies, I think we’ve heard enough,” RuPaul told the queens on the stage. “While you untuck backstage, the judges and I will deliberate.”
“Yeah, you’re giving me this romantic mitosis fantasy moment — or is it meiosis?” asked special guest judge Neil Patrick Harris. The judges laughed. “I can’t remember my biology!” He shook his head. “Anyway, I’m living for it.”
“How on earth do you do a sewing drill?” Kali Sister laughed.
“Why,
“We won the challenge!” Draco crowed. “Take
“Ladies, I’ve made my decision. Lorena Gucci, Chanté, you stay.” Lorena bent forward and supported her hands on her knees. When she stood upright again, she pressed her hands together in prayer. Intoxia looked at her sadly and clapped. “You may join the other girls.” Lorena hugged Intoxia before walking to the back of the stage.
“Ms. Draco, tonight you get the last word.”
“Ms. Davenport, same question.”

Goldie laughed and patted Draco on the shoulder. “Good luck, girl. You better work.”
Draco considered his little cousin. “Why would you want to go, anyway? It’s just going to be a bunch of grown-ups sitting around watching the episode together. You and I can do that tomorrow when it’s available on Harry’s laptop.”
She flipped to another page. “Under ‘Social Issues,’ you have ‘Woke (Adjective),’ ‘Talk-Sick Masculinity,’ ‘Cultural Approposition,’ and, um, what? ‘White Noise / White Privilege: are they related? How do they see sound?’”
— or at least, we would have if his punches didn’t pass through…” he looked up at a corner of the ceiling as if it could finish his sentence for him.
Draco tried not to wince. How could muggles be so casual with a phrase that sounded uncannily like the killing curse?
on the dining table. He’d never had the courage to explain to his son why they should never eat at that table, and it always unnerved him to see his son use it for that purpose.
“Don’t worry, no one’s gonna go hungry,” Lady Cakes interjected. I’m gonna be feeding everyone with my
“Can you talk about the masks you made?”
“Now, since Steve and Intoxia won the mini challenge, you will serve as team leaders and pick the teammates for your cooking shows.”
Millicent giggled. “The Slytherin rite of passage.”
“I think you can use that to your advantage,” Warren said. “As someone from another country, you have an outsider’s perspective on the United States. What insights do you have about America that you could talk about in the debate?”
“You think Draco might go walking children in nature?” Michelle raised an eyebrow.
“Well, look at
“All right, what’s up?” Weasley asked, shoving a cocktail weenie (
Courtney was caught by complete surprise when Draco smashed the handful of cake onto her cheek. Mike Ruiz captured a shot of Courtney’s look of absolute cake-smeared horror as Draco gave the camera an evil grin.
“She manages to make sunburn look sexy!” added special guest judge Janet Jackson.
Draco shrugged.
Scorpius sighed. “Dad, maybe you shouldn’t keep doing that. You’re not as young as you used to be.”
“That’s because it’s the queen’s Netflix password.”
Draco shrugged and handed it to her. “I don’t know, Crabbe. If it hurts, it should only be for a moment.”
“Very mature,” Pansy made a face. “Draco, did he tell you that he cheated on me with an eighteen-year-old? She’s a friend of our daughter Begonia’s. She’s barely out of Hogwarts!”
After what felt like an eternity of sitting around the Untucked lounge listening to queens argue about each other’s outfits, they were all called back to the main stage. Draco resumed her place at the front of the stage with the other top and bottom queens of the week. She applauded politely when Goldie Hanako was announced as the winner of the sewing challenge. Lady Cakes McMansion and Venus Flygirl were both safe.
“And now, we just have one trick left,” Paris said, holding the wand.

“Isn’t that the underground train system?”
“Oh my God, just kill me now!” Goldie cringed and buried her face in her hand.
“Hey, is that an owl?!”
She held up her card. “
“It’s got nothing to do with Beyoncé being funny,” Lady Cakes argued. “Have you never seen that clip of Kanye West at the Grammys? We had both Beyoncé and Taylor Swift on Snatch Game. How could I
“And how about that win, Miss Ivana?” Paris Davenport asked coyly.
“Draco, you have two heads.”
Draco had no control over what was revealed in future episodes. They had been recorded in the past, of course. Draco knew what was coming; he just didn’t know how the wizarding public would react as a result.
—Confessional—
Comments and kudos make my little heart go flutter-flutter!
“You can continue to use your first name in your performances and on this show,” she explained, “But only your first name. You cannot continue to go by Draco Malfoy. The producers of
RuPaul went over to a large bag that one of the men held open for him. “Oh, my!
“You have each won a custom latex outfit designed by Cherries and Minx,” RuPaul continued. “Thank you; you may join the others at the back of the stage.” Draco nodded in gratitude, stunned that she wasn’t in the bottom this time.
He tapped his pheasant feather quill against his lip and considered his options.

?” Kali asked. Draco’s nostrils flared slightly in warning. Kali held up both hands in surrender. “No. I mean, not intentionally? I’m playing a British celebrity, too, so I thought repeating what you say might help me get the accent down.”
If Lady Cakes couldn’t use either of her wrists in the next challenge, she’d definitely be sent home.
“I think she needs to practice a bit more and come back in a few years.” Lady Cakes agreed.
Draco lifted the spider closer to his face and smirked. “I shall make you my drag daughter,” he told it, “And I shall call you Araneus.”
“Oh, like you’re any better?” Draco gave her a pointed look. Kali and Goldie gaped, looking delighted at the prospect of more drama.
“But you
We've finally made it to Snatch Game! This took me longer to write than expected. I'm sure there are parts of it that could be better, but this is the version that's getting published. Enjoy!
Crabbe made a face. “You know I can’t eat.”
“Oh, come on, Dad! Now I really want to know.”
—Confessional—
Draco blinked. Millicent had been in Draco's year in Slytherin when they were at Hogwarts. She had never quite blended in with the other Slytherin girls, who sometimes bullied her for being more "butch" than the rest. But she had always got on well enough with Draco, and the two of them had even dated briefly during second year, before either of them had fully sorted out their respective orientations.
“Indeed,” Draco repeated, and cringed again for a completely different reason. Could he not think of anything more intelligent to say? He contemplated what would be the best way to tease Potter about being an old fuddyduddy who complained about his kid’s self-expression without Potter turning the teasing back on himself.
“That’s brilliant,” Draco absently replied as she worked on transfiguring her lips to a luscious, pink pout. “Keep practicing.”
Draco chuckled. “Aside from my boyfriend and a very small number of friends, no one knows I’m even doing drag, let alone consorting with muggles...in America, even. I can’t imagine how any of the old blood-supremacists back in England could possibly find out.”
“This is how I know it’s tomato season,” Carson said.
“I know it was terrible,” Lady Cakes said. “I think I got too far into my own head tonight.”
“And now, Draco.”
—Confessional—
“Now, sashay away.”
I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
The Bent Unicorn was eerily quiet. Draco had completely forgotten about that moment in the interview, and cringed to see it on screen, especially now that she was in a large room surrounded by people who knew exactly what those masks had been about. The wig of snakes weighed heavily on her head despite the lightening charm.
—Confessional—
With that, two thirds of the Golden Trio left.
“Ladies,” RuPaul began, “I’ve made my decision.” The two queens waited expectantly.
“I wanted to ask you a drag-related question,” Millicent said as she claimed one of the stools next to the vanity. Granger leaned against the wall by the door. “And you were busy dolling yourself up, so I saw Granger and thought maybe she would know, since it’s a muggle thing.”
Draco had merely rolled her eyes and shook her head. “

“Yeah, this isn’t going to be the same without her,” Goldie Hanako said.

RuPaul laughed. “Okay, let’s move on. Mary Berry, Dirty Diana is so dirty, she uses
“Did you even
“Condragulations, Draco! You have won a two-thousand-dollar gift certificate for custom jewelry by Viva Regina.” Draco clapped and jumped up and down caught up in the excitement.
After each pole solo, the queens resumed dancing around each other in a circle and struck a final pose, half of them out of breath.

“Use the microphone, sweetie, that’s what it’s there for,” Vilanch coached.
Sneak Peek for Episode 7:
“They read her for wearing a rectangle,” Lady Cakes explained, then laughed again. “So then Draco starts going on about how people look at rectangles every day or something and that’s why she made her outfit that way.”
“Creativity wasn’t a formal part of my education,” Draco admitted. “But I found ways to express myself by writing songs and designing fashion accessories. I was particularly proud of my badges.”
well, for all Draco had come to respect the technological advancements and artistry accomplished by those without magic, old prejudices were hard to snuff out completely.
“You don’t know? I thought everyone knew about the prophecy,” said Crabbe in surprise.
“So, what do y’all think about what’s going on in America right now?” Paris asked.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Potter wasn’t actually asking him on a date, was he?
“What do you know about magic?” Paris asked.
“To Professor Binns,” Draco tapped his cup against Potter’s. He smiled. “And to reuniting with old enemies.”
“Hamlet was
Once he was back in his room, his eyes landed on a small tub that sat on the bathroom counter with his other toiletries. He picked it up, thinking.
“Oh, honey, you’re not joking!” Venus replied.
Potter and Weasley whipped their heads around fast enough that Draco was surprised they didn’t injure themselves. “WHAT?!” Weasley cried.
“That’s not including the Black estate,” Malfoy continued, holding up another form. “Looks like the farm has been doing well. One hundred acres of winter wheat, sixty of rapeseed, plus the apple orchard. You might tell Old Pendleton to rotate in a legume next summer to replenish the soil quality, but in general, it’s a thriving property.”
“For today’s mini challenge, you will each take turns reading each other. Ladies, the library is open...
“Security!” RuPaul called to someone behind the camera. “Anyway, I’m afraid that’s not a match. Let’s move on to Carrie Fisher. Carrie, the big bad wolf is a drag queen. Instead of huffing and puffing, she
“Maybe we have to try to paint without looking?” Steve suggested.
“I’d like to talk to you about an experience that I’m sure we
“Damn, we’re only into the second week and already, the bitches are coming for each other!” Carmelita made a face. “I’m not so sure Kali didn’t step on my toes on purpose. If she does it again, I think my foot’s gonna accidentally come in contact with her shin.”

“I gotta level with you,” Paris answered, “I don’t really do impressions. All I’ve got is Beyoncé.”
Draco sipped his tea with both hands, relishing in the warmth in his fingers. “Hmm. Maybe the ritual worked better than we realized.”
As she reached the end of the runway, she cocked a hand to her hip and spun around. Her backside was completely nude save for the chain at the nape of her neck and the belt at her waist. Below the waist she had glued the small British flag to her left cheek. Draco turned her head over her shoulder to wink at the judges before continuing her runway walk.
“Intoxia Madison,” RuPaul continued, “Tonight, your look on the runway is out of this world. But in Snatch Game, your Carrie Fisher impression...failed to launch. I’m sorry my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
“It didn’t work, but Draco being who he is, he was happy to just let me make a fool of myself by talking dirty to his cock in English.”
“It’s not like they believed me,” Draco said, defending herself. “See?” She gestured towards the screen as the rest of the judging scene unfolded.
“In other words, they just think you’re fucking bonkers.”
Sorry for the cliffhanger! That’s been part of my outline for this fic since the very beginning, so I’m not doing this as a way to end the fic early. I promise not to make you wait another year for the next chapter!
Lorena pursed her lips in disdain.
“Let’s talk about this ritual,” Granger-Weasley said. As much as Draco was grateful for the change in topic, this wouldn’t do.
“And if you’re aroused, that’s okay, too!”
“All right, let’s ask the audience,” Goldie continued. “What do you think? Should we let Draco do some magic?”
“This is the land of opportunity. By the power vested in me, chanté, you stay! You
“HI, RU!” Lady-Cakes-as-Nicole-Byer chirped loudly. Next to her, Draco jumped in her seat, not expecting the extra volume.

By this time, the audience was roaring. RuPaul herself looked like she was struggling to breathe.
“Really? Because I thought—”
“Ladies, I have made my decision,” RuPaul said. “Lady Cakes, chanté, you stay. You may join the other girls.” Lady Cakes held up her hands in prayer and nodded. She hugged Steve, then walked to the back of the stage and grabbed Goldie’s extended hand.
“Wait until you see the paper, Dad. You’re never going to believe it! Professor Binns is

, I’m committed to keeping my exclamations drag relevant.”
RuPaul laughed. “Girl, that’s some tea right there!”
“I’ll always be two months younger than you, you know.”
“Well now, that was exciting,” Goldie smirked. “So, Draco, tell us for real. Did you make up this Ethel character?” She gestured at Draco’s oversized doll dress.
The other queens looked at each other.
Draco posed with her arms extended elegantly above her head at the back of the runway, wearing a shell-pink leotard, black tutu, sheer black stockings, and pink ballet flats. She had styled her wig in a high chignon.
“Mr. Darcy can eat my arse,” Draco sneered, spinning in a quick circle before smacking her hand on her bottom for emphasis, and danced off to the side when RuPaul summoned Lady Cakes for her turn.
Dean and Mariah exchanged a look.
Malfoy Manor had changed a lot over the years since the Dark Lord had occupied it. It was now a bright, cheerful place, where Draco and Harry were living out their retirement in their own wing separate from the one Scorpius occupied with his wife. The most recent generation of Malfoys had already grown up and chosen to live in London flats.
to be more to it than that.”
“I just thought you looked like a 1940s secretary,” Martha Stewart added. “It didn’t seem to go with what you were saying. It’s just unfortunate, since you look so beautiful tonight.”
Lip sync:
—Confessional—
“Sorry, that’s not quite a match.”
Draco grabbed his quill and notepad and began frantically jotting down notes. A production assistant came in and called them all away to Craft Services for dinner; Draco stayed behind, a growing pile of notepapers cluttering the area around him on the table. By the time everyone else returned, he had their entire magic skit storyboarded.
“Thank you, ladies; we’ve heard enough. While you enjoy a cocktail in the Untucked Lounge, the judges and I will deliberate.”
Draco scoffed. “I can’t recommend being in the bottom,” she said. “Especially not in the first week! I was half ready to start singing ‘Ru Save the Queen’ if I thought it could have kept me from going home.”
After the judging, Draco and the other “unsafe” queens — Lady Cakes, Lorena, Paris, Acacia, and Cindy — were sent back to the Untucked lounge while the judges deliberated.
Malfoy smirked. “That’s the financial advantage of hiring a Certified Accountant of the Wizarding World, Junior Class,” he explained. “When I reach Woodletter’s level of seniority, I could charge you that amount for merely stepping into my office.”
“Fly, my queen, fly!” RuPaul exclaimed.
The only problem was that she was already standing and talking with Weasley — who still gave him dirty looks — and Potter — whom Draco could barely glance at without remembering how he had made an arse of himself mere minutes previously.
Draco strutted down the runway in a burqa.
Draco stepped around in front of them and addressed the camera. “If
“I’ve got work to do, and I don’t need you lot distracting me!”
“OH!” Myrtle’s eyes lit up. She smacked her fist into her palm. “That was you, eh?” She swooped in closer to him, then frowned.
“RuPaul says it all the time,” Draco said in her defense. A pregnant silence ensued.
“But those aren’t the only tricks we can do,” Goldie said.
“What prophecy?” Potter asked curiously. Draco’s ears suddenly felt very warm.
“I’ve seen the
Lady Cakes turned around and fixed a look at Draco, who sat quietly in the back seat and pretended to pick a speck of link off his shirt.
“You are all safe. You may leave the stage.” Kali looked especially relieved and bowed to RuPaul. One by one, all five of the safe queens filed offstage to the Untucked lounge.
for the Malfoy name?” His fingers gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white. He had brought this on himself. If he hadn’t insisted on using his real name to flaunt his drag in front of Lucius, he wouldn’t be in this position now.

She beamed at the panel of judges as she glided down the runway, arms stretched gracefully out to either side like a dancer. Her dress was a panel of lightweight white fabric with a small gold chain clasping at both shoulders and wrapping around the neck like a halter top, pooling in front to create a draping neckline. A gold belt cinched it at the waist. The skirt hung down to mid-thigh. Her blonde wig was swept into a curly updo
“I’ll be honest — I’ve never heard of Ethel Lynne or whatever it’s called,” Matthew said.

Draco took a deep break and paused in the middle of applying eyeshadow to the left eye. “I was disowned,” he replied crisply.

“Draco, breathe,” Goldie coached.
“This was a stupid challenge anyway,” Cindy argued, wearing a tight, mustard-yellow catsuit with a thick dirty-blonde mane. “Who does RuPaul think she is, using
“Are you feeling intuitive?” RuPaul asked them. “For this week’s mini challenge, I want each and every one of you to reach deep down and feel...your gut.”
“All right, now let the music play!”
“I won a challenge!” Draco told the camera excitedly. “I’d like to thank everyone who tried to bludgeon me back in school. The joke's on you, you tossers!”
“Lorena Gucci,” RuPaul went on. “Your witch look had us gagging. But in the challenge, you...choked.” Lorena nodded stiffly.
Two men rolled a large screen into the Untucked lounge. Draco didn’t look up. She had seen enough Untucked episodes from previous seasons to get the gist that these moments were usually about some queen’s mother or boyfriend leaving a message to let her know how loved she was. Draco sighed, not really feeling in any sort of mood to support some other queen getting this type of love. Her own life was too complicated for that now.
“Really, Queen?” Intoxia raised an eyebrow at the camera. “Carmelita is...fishy and effeminate. We’re talking about Trinity from
Draco shook his head and wondered what sort of damage Goyle’s newfound muggle lifestyle had done to his sensibilities. He relit the chandeliers as Granger-Weasley went back to the table. She leafed through the horcrux book, her brows furrowed.
“This week, for your main challenge, you will be putting on a cooking show!” RuPaul informed them. “This is one of the classic formats of daytime television. Some of the great TV chefs like Julia Child, Paula Deen, and Rachel Ray have been teaching multiple generations of home cooks how to make delicious dishes.
“She’s the least experienced of any of us,” Kali said.
That left Draco and Ivana Mann as the last two queens. The Rusical episodes were typically challenges that required a lot of dancing and physicality. Surely Draco’s lip sync performance had proven her abilities to the others. And considering that she was half Ivana’s age, that had to count for something, right?
