Besides, he did feel quite guilty about jumping to conclusions and expecting Malfoy to treat him horribly when he had been nothing but kind to Harry so far.
Harry snorted. "What's the point acting all shy now when you've already seen everything that's there to see?"
"So," the blond said as they turned another corner. "Let's see…" he paused as he thought for a moment. "Ah, that's right. You said you deposited a vase in Gringotts today?"
"Yeah, don't blame Lily!" Lily joined in, sticking her tongue out at James, who reached out and grabbed her tongue with his muddy hand, causing her to splutter and spit all over the place.
Several pairs of surprised eyes turned to stare at him, and Padma inhaled sharply before saying, "Pardon?"
Harry shot Ron a look as he eyed the fancy-looking lettering on the card. "Silver Sprigs? Isn't that the school for the rich and famous or something?"
"Weasley," Draco said, his tone of voice matching the look on the other's face. He gave the redhead a once-over, lip curling in revulsion. "Looks like the life of poverty is treating you well." He focused his gaze on the brunette next. "Tornado hit your hair, Granger? Or is that what passes off as style these days?"
They paused a little away from the head office, each lapsing into silence as they reverted back to their own thoughts. A few minutes later, Hermione exited the office. She looked frazzled, and her hair was all over the place, but she was beaming.
Harry felt a lump form in his throat. Pressing a kiss to his son's head, he said, "I missed you, too."
to be joking," he grumbled, barely having the energy to clean himself up with the freshening charm that was swiftly becoming a mandatory part of his everyday life.
She hummed as she rummaged through the cupboards and extricated a bottle of Firewhiskey from the back of a cabinet. She held it out to him, and he raised his eyebrows.
He would've preferred if Rabastan Lestrange had remained true to his former title—a Death Eater feared by all—than the sunken man, reduced to the state of a frightened, lifeless being whom one could only sympathise with. He felt no fear for this man. He felt no anger towards this man. All he felt was immense pity.
"No. Now move," Draco snapped, trying but failing to walk around the gangly redhead. He sighed. "Look. If you have such a problem with your boyfriend hanging out with me, shouldn't you be talking to
"For now," Draco said, sniffing. "My poor lad. What if the kidnapper is actually after me and decided to take my son hostage to punish me?"
Draco pondered over that, nodding slowly after a long moment. "I do believe you have rather powerful magic flowing through your veins." He reached up to place two fingers against the skin over the carotid artery in Harry's neck. "I can feel it."
Harry turns to face me, and there is something in the way he looks at me that I can't quite discern. He smiles, and in the dim lighting of the shopfront, the crinkles around his eyes stand out, making him look warm and homely, and I'm suddenly overcome by the urge to hug him and cry.
She pulled him into a hug, and he laughed as Lily whined about being squished. "I'm here. Where're the rest of the kids?"
Shaking his head, a sense of disbelief settling over him, he chuckled drily at the twisted irony of it all. He finally knew why he thought he had known Hertzfeld. It was because of how similar his story was to one Harry had personally experienced
The Weasley matriarch had a gentle expression on her face as she asked in a soft voice, "Until they're ready or you are?"
"I know." Neville leant forwards in his seat, his eyes shining with understanding and support. It reminded Harry of the times during the war when Neville had stood by his side irrespective of what had happened. It sort of relieved him that Neville was here, although he couldn't help but be overly cautious in case anybody realised something was going on. If everything was taken into consideration, his paranoia was justified—at least as far as he was concerned.
"Oh, that's right! It's a folded envelope, sir. It looks like… well, a folded envelope. It's white and has—" she broke off, making vague gestures with her hand, and he had the sudden urge to pat her on the head. She reminded him so much of Lily when she was flustered that he found it endearing.
Feeling his heart begin to race, Harry took on a demeanour of confusion and shook his head. "Last night? No, I didn't. Ginny fell asleep on the sofa so I went up to get some work done. Why?"
"Oh, don't worry 'bout it. I leave Rosie and Hugh up here all the time while I'm tending the shop. It would've been bad if we hadn't installed the locks on the study, but since we have, there's nothing to worry about."
"No, Arthur finally ended up making a little sandbox for the kids by the pond in the garden so they could play all they wanted without disrupting the flowerbeds."
"Oh, they should be back anytime, now. You know how Arthur's been wanting to take them to watch the tournament, so Bill took the day off today so they could go together. I told Ginny, but she isn't in Dorset anymore, so she couldn't meet with them. And Fleur and Dominique took advantage of the opportunity to get some shopping done in Diagon. They should be back soon, too."
Harry looked guilty for a moment before Hermione spotted the book he had been reading. "What's this?" she asked and then reached over to his bed to grab the book. Harry felt another lecture coming on.
LeFay didn’t answer and instead got up from his seat and headed over to a desk. He started writing something quickly onto a slip of paper and then handed it to Draco.
“Well… You see, you know how I told you it wasn’t going so well,” she paused as she looked down at the floor, her eyes looking like they were starting to water. Theo looked down at her when she stopped speaking and placed a hand on top of her head.
"Oh, alright, but that means everyone else has to do it too!" Hermione exclaimed as she slipped off the bed. There was a groan from the other three, but it was all in good fun. "For me it's rather easy, I don't know how it is for you guys since your's are your inheritances," she explained. The other three nodded as she spoke but didn't say anything.
Draco's eyes closed as he finished, sliding back up his mate's body just as the wave hit him, his head resting now on Harry's chest. He didn't have time to react as LeFay rolled them over again, Draco's startled gaze suddenly filled with the dripping image of LeFay above him. He smiled hesitantly before his mouth was claimed, and he let his body go weak, submitting into the kiss. LeFay laughed darkly and Draco could feel him at his entrance. With a sharp movement Draco let out a loud gasp, his claws digging into LeFay's back while LeFay pinned one of Draco's wings to the ground. He whinned quietly and Draco could feel his dragon submitting to this, the kistune had him by the throat now and there was no where to go. Not that he wanted to.
Harry and Tatsuya have gotten along pretty well so far. Course, it's only been a couple hours since they initially shared one body in harmony. Well, a type of harmony that is. After telling Hermione about what happened and a very excited Neville and Luna, he heads back up to his room to show them, just exactly what he'll look like. For his first time it's unexpectedly easy. That is until he looses control. Hopefully it doesn't happen when McGonagall tests him in the morning.
"I've had a bit more practice with mine," he stated quietly before he winked at Hermione. There was a quiet rumble as Theo changed places with his creature form, and a loud roar echoed through the room after he did. Sitting in the middle of Harry's room was a Maltese Tiger. It seemed that Theo was so use to morphing back and forth that even his clothes morphed with him. The blue tiger got up and started towards Harry, a low rumble deep in his throat. Harry backed away, unsure of the large creature in the room. Herm on the other hand boldly stepped in front of him, her head and tail held high before she sat in front of the tiger’s path. It stared at her for a moment before rubbing its face against hers and then rolled over onto its back. Tiny Herm took the chance to pounce on the larger cat's stomach. Everyone laughed as the two cats started to play a version of tag around the room, almost knocking over one of Harry's candles.
“When the Auroras land that’s when we strike,” Snape whispered. There was no way the three of them could take on the group of twenty.
Next came Draco, and to his surprise Draco sported two sets of black and violet horns. The lower pair curved back and then tipped forward, while the higher pair reminded him of ram horns that curved around Draco’s newly pointed ears. His skin was also darker, clashing harshly against his pale hair. The black robe he wore dragged on the floor, covering his feet and the source of the tapping sound that followed him. He stopped at the altar and took a deep breath before lifting his gaze.
Harry chuckled at Ammit, who sounded truly insulted. He patted his familiar's head as he turned from the window and Bubo flew past him.
"They'll be coming in with the mind healers soon, we should go," Tom stated as he put his chair back. "Care to join me? I'm headed to the kitchens to find something to snack on. I do believe your mother has made some delicious sweets." Tom stepped to the door way, stopping for a moment to cock his head to the side. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, chewing it for a long moment before finally standing. "Good boy. There isn't much we can do for him right now anyways. And I'm sure he wouldn't want you wasting away," Tom said as he set a hand down on Draco's should. Draco nodded weakly, glancing back at Harry's bed before following out the door.
LeFay snorted, like he would forget after almost losing a limb. That had been his first and only mistake before turning his leaf completely around.
“Most are from run ins with other creatures," he explained, "They need proof of a strong leader before following them. Of course, that usually only happens with the more feral of them.” LeFay tilted his head, resting his chin in the palm of his hand.
When he closed his eyes to listen to the birds, and the quiet sounds of the other forest animals, he heard a low distant humming instead. He kept his eyes closed as he listened to it, it sounded familiar. Something he remembered, distinctly, hearing before. He opened his eyes, his ears still tuned to the soft singing.
Charlie looked a bit guilty as he spoke, “Well yes but, many dragons will help in the care of hatchlings if they come across any. It’s only after a dragon becomes a juvenile that other dragons will have pretty much nothing to do with them. Pushinng them out of their territories. He seems to be expressing that drive to protect hatchlings, though, I don’t know why he would view you as one.”
Voldemort looked over the bed, dropping his bleeding arm to his side as he gripped the side of the bed with his good hand. Severus stepped up to the side of the bed as well, a look of pain on his face. "My'Lord?"
Harry’s smile wavered but he nodded, “And I’ll have Ghost!” he said, patting the thick striped hyena’s side.
“Harry, we’d like to ask you some questions about what happened the day before last. First, I want to inform you that you parents have been notified and are currently waiting outside. But due to the questions we are going to ask I have told them to wait outside until we are done,” Minerva stated. Harry nodded, acknowledging what she said as he looked over everyone there. “First, tell us all that you remember up to when we found you,” she said kindly.
“How could this be happening again?” Harry whispered as the sound of spells impacting neared. He felt a hand squeeze his shoulder and to Draco.
It was hard for him to get to his feet as he took another step forward only to be transported into darkness. A low growling encircled him as he was pushed forward by some kind of hard misty mass, it circled around his arms and legs, holding him in place when he stepped to the middle of the garden. Like something out of a nightmare two glowing eyes appeared from the darkness in front of him, and slowly LeFay slipped from the milky darkness around them. His bare skin glowed against the blackness that surrounded them, his hair forming pools around his ankles and feet before fading in to the surrounding void. Antlers dripped with green moss as LeFay took a step forward. Draco backed away a step, his body shaking with fear. The magic, LeFay's magic was suffocating him, yet feeding into him like some addictive drug and the pain Draco'd been feeling from the collar was gone.
“I’m guessing you wanted to talk,” he drawled, still tense and irritated about the whole event. He understood LeFay very little now. What was he trying to get at with all this back and forth. It frustrated him so, seeing his godson’s heart break and not able to do anything about it. He couldn’t even hex the man causing it.
Ammit stated. He was confused why his master was so upset when it was obvious his master liked the hatchling.
Harry was thinking about heading back to the dorms to try and get some sleep when the doors to the great hall opened. Curious, he peaked over his shoulder only to find Snape's standing there. His curiosity squashed; he went back to his thoughts. Unable to think about anything else other than the inevitability of everything being his fault.
Harry started walking backwards slowly, watching in fascination as the dragon’s wings acted as a third set of legs.
“Lord Black,” Draco bowed slightly before taking a seat. Sirius nodded at him before sitting down in his own chair behind the desk while Remus stayed standing beside it.
Draco asked, fear starting to creep its way in as he remembered exactly what he'd done the last time he'd woken.
“Wish we could talk to him before this fight but rules are rules. Maybe I can get that shitface to reveal what he did to LeFay during the fight. What do you think? You ready to kick some ass Jariss?” Draco asked aloud. The fighting roar he got in response within his mind made him smile as he reached for the door and headed out to the main yard for the duel. Guards trailing after him.
“Harry!” Draco yelled, trying to get his attention. His voice sounded so muffled, he could barely hear himself over the ringing in his hears.
"Severus.., Severus!" he shouted, "Harry! Severus, Nagini-." Harry reached out and put a hand on Draco's shoulder. The frozen temperature of Harry's hand was enough to pull Draco's attention.
“Are you going to try and stop me?” Draco asked, raising his eye brows. His hand was already on his wand, ready to use it at a moment’s notice.
Draco watched him for a long moment before gingerly handing the book over to him. Harry held it in his hands and looked over the cover. Strangely it felt both plush and soft like leather, but rougher.
"Why didn't you tell us sooner?" August asked, confused on why his best friend had not told him of Lord Malfoy's impending arrival.
Any animal he talked to, that wasn't a snake or Hedwig, made he feel stupid. He knew they couldn't understand him so why do it?
"Damn," Severus slammed the table with his hand, almost knocking the vials of the table. "There's to many, even if I can get them closed enough to administer the anti-toxin I don't know how much is actually in his system," he bit his thumb hard. Time was running out.
It took about an hour for everyone to be ready for the ceremony. Harry stood behind the alter, head slightly bowed. Narcissa was the first to step up to the alter; carrying with her a small bowl with assorted ingredients. Each participant chose six items to burn, each specific to them, and spoke what they wanted to give with their vows. After they set them a flame they would add their blood while speaking the incantation.
"Relax Draco, relax. You're safe. Nothing is going to harm you here," he almost pleaded as he knelt beside his godson. As Draco did relax and lay down on the cot, Severus ran his hand over the fur covered ears.
"It would seem they can tell you are on the verge. You do love torturing him don't you?" the darkness stated with a half-hearted chuckle. "Come, do not keep them hoping for the impossible," it soothed.
"HARRY!" he screamed at the top of his lungs. As the glass shattered, Harry's eye snapped open and he looked at Draco in surprise. Suddenly everything was rushing towards Draco and he felt his body being smashed against surface after surface. He was gasping for breath before he suddenly saw the arms coming for him. Harry screaming no echoed in the waves of red as Draco felt panic envelope him.
"Now, student's, before we start our dinner I feel it is necessary to update you all in the importance of safety in these dark times," Dumbledore announced as he stood at the head of the teachers table, "I know you all must be worried about what the future holds, but I implore you all. Panicking at times like these will only create more chaos and confusion. I know, everyone has heard by now about what has happened to Draco Malfoy and his family. I want this to be a lesson, one we can all learn from, it is not one group that is targeted by the death eaters, it is all of us. In order to defeat the darkness, everyone will have to band together," Dumbledore stopped for a moment, looking over at the Slytherin table, as if waiting for something and then waved his hand.
“We knew the moment he got his inheritance,” Remus stated quietly. “We knew that he would most likely revert to his true self.”
“Harry careful,"Remus sighed pitfully as he held his arms out, only to cover his face with his hands, "Your tails,” Remus groaned as he went to fetch a broom.
Even though it was cloudy and chilly, there were people out on the streets, going about their business as per usual, and Harry felt a moment's envy at their mundane lives.
-headed?" he asked, and the owl clucked reproachfully. It finally took the letter from his hand, and he pulled his fingers away just before the stupid bird managed to nip or claw at him.
Harry nodded as he watched Lisa jump to her feet and start yelling at Buxley. "Listen, I'm in the middle of something right now, but I'll call you tonight?"
He looked up to see the soft smile on her face and her shimmering brown eyes, and felt himself relax. That's right. He'd done what he had meant to do. He'd put to rest a past that wouldn't leave him alone. It had finally ended. A part of him could finally relax now that Rabastan Lestrange had passed on peacefully.
"I know," he said softly as she ran her hands through his hair. "But no more surprises for a while, OK?"
Weasley and his horrible-haired girlfriend walked past Draco to stand on either side of Potter. The duo wore identical expressions of disgust as they eyed Draco—as though
Harry shrugged. "I think it might be mutually beneficial." When Malfoy's sceptical expression didn't change, Harry added, "All I'm suggesting is that we try it out. You
Camilla seemed disappointed that things hadn't gone the way she had planned, but Malfoy simply spared her a cursory glance before turning back to Harry.
When he awoke, it was to the pungent aroma of freshly baked goods and flowers. It took him several seconds to think back to his last known surroundings and several more to discern that there were neither muffins nor gardens where he had been. Jumping upright, he swore at the jolt of pain that assaulted him and rummaged around for his glasses.
I pause abruptly as I notice that most of the seats are occupied, and as the bus jerks into motion, I swear under my breath and settle down on the foldable seats by the front, my impatience getting the better of me.
Harry shrugged. "It seems the most logical explanation. If this fellow disappeared right after his employers' deaths, it could be for two reasons: he either has something
"Everyone always seems to be cleaning up my messes after me," Harry mumbled into his hands as Hermione came to sit beside him.
"Neville's back there," Hannah was saying as she led him to the back of the pub. "I told him to take you upstairs, but he was oddly adamant about seeing you here."
She coughed, attracting the attention of several of the people nearby. "Excuse me," Astoria began, her voice booming thanks to the amplifying charm. "If I may have your attention for a few moments; this is an urgent matter." Once everyone's gaze was fixed on her, she continued. "I'm Astoria Greengrass, one of the organisers of this exposition, as many of you may know." There were enthusiastic cheers from the crowd. "And this is Draco Malfoy, the father of my son." The cheers were uncertain this time around. Astoria held up a hand for them to quiet down. "My son, Scorpius, thirteen years old and around as tall as I am, seems to be missing. We would greatly appreciate if you could help us locate him. We think he may still be on the premises, as it's only been around fifteen to twenty minutes since we lost him, and the quicker we find him, the quicker we can go ahead with finishing our preparations."
"I'm guessing you felt obligated to tell him, considering Lestrange was one of the four Death Eaters that put Alice and Frank Longbottom permanently in St Mungo's?"
Forcing himself to his feet, Harry trudged to the bathroom, cleaned himself up, and went downstairs.
, leaving him alone, once again, in an empty home. He sighed and massaged his temples, wondering if he should just take a nap since there wasn't much else to do, when there were three sharp raps on the window frame, and a Screech Owl flew in and settled on the table.
Harry nodded, and Buxley frowned. "Why d'you look like you anticipated some sort of conspiracy to be afoot?"
Harry tossed the notebook towards him. "There're either too many lines to read between or not enough."
"The charm wears off after a while, so make sure to keep recasting it," he reminded her as he tucked a strand of her ginger locks behind her pale ear.
"The Magpies and the Wasps," she replied, moving away and flopping onto the bed. "I'm going to have to leave on Friday if I plan on going as part of the Harpies' press team."
"Which part?" Draco said with a tinkling laugh as he slid out from under the sheets and pulled on a robe.
"Er, yeah, but George said he has it under control for now, so…" Ron trailed off, looking over his shoulder. "Look, mate, I know you've been spending time with them despite being busy and everything, but I think the kids're starting to feel homesick. 'Specially Al and Lily. I think it'd be better if you brought them home for a day or two, just 'til they're back to their usual, chipper selves."
"Thanks," Harry replied, and Hermione nodded, leading him out of the room. "Er, Hermione, I know where the Floo is—"
"Oh, she's doing great, thanks. The Leaky's been really busy lately, and she's finally decided she can't run the whole pub on her own."
They laughed at that, and as they walked towards Gryffindor Tower, Draco felt Harry's fingers brush against his. His stomach fluttered again, and he cleared his throat, pretending like he didn't notice, but he couldn't deny that it pleased him.
Molly made a thoughtful sound as she bustled over to the kitchen. "Have you had something to eat yet, dear? I thought we'd wait 'til everyone got back, but if you're hungry…"
Harry thanked her again and walked her to the door. The moment he shut it, he turned to Buxley and said, "Have some of your lads take a look at those books and tell them they get a free lunch in the
"When will we make this official? I mean, I want this to work, but if it doesn't, will I have to go through the process of choosing another Healer?"
"Come and get them," he called, and after a moment, Pig raised its head, tilted it, stared at the owl treats, and then flew at them.
“I told you to stop using yourself for your experiments!” he yelled, walking over to where his husband laid, writhing. “There are enough werewolves willing to offer themselves up as test subjects so why do you have to keep inflicting pain on yourself like this?”
He thought she'd give a smart-mouthed reply to his outburst, but she only stood back with a frown and crossed her arms.
Harry's prediction may have had some merit, though, because the afternoon before Christmas, while Draco was avoiding the rest of the student population and the festivities by holing himself up in the library, Granger flounced over to him.
"Oh, I woke up late this morning and couldn't go with the Harpies to the practice pitch, so I decided to finish up some other work…" she paused, and he heard her speaking to someone else. After a moment, she was back on line. "Yeah, so now I'm trying to get to the pitch but you won't
Hermione made a beeline towards the pungent aroma of tomato soup as soon as they entered. Draco settled down on one of the stools by the table in the middle, grabbing the first thing he could get his hands on—a large banana muffin—and bit into it.
There was silence from the other side, and after a minute, he began to panic, but the door cracked open and she stepped out, head bowed, looking shame-faced. "I must apologise to Auror Buxley for my behaviour. It was uncalled for."
Harry gritted his teeth, and a heavy silence descended upon them. He could hear the scraping sound as she pushed back her chair and excused herself, and he could imagine how embarrassed she should be for having yelled at him over the phone in front of all her friends.
His expression was unreadable as he stepped aside to let her pass. She hummed a little tune, twirling her wand in her hand, eyes never leaving her prize. Everything was going according to plan, just as expected. What she didn't expect, however, as she spun around with her wand raised, ready to rid herself of the last loose end, was the spell that hit her square in the chest, throwing her against the wall. As she slid to the floor, a menacing grin stretched across her face.
The blond shook his head. "Although I do still have people that resent me, I have a rather faithful client base, and the people I meet on a daily basis are ones I have a good rapport with." When he hesitated, Harry waited, patient. "But… this isn't the first time Scorpius has been kidnapped. It's happened once before, when he was around six, when we lost him in London. We were looking for a casket for my mother's funeral, and he disappeared. We didn't file a missing persons report then because we were confident we would find him, and it was hours before someone we knew informed us that they'd seen someone that looked like Scorpius all alone in a park. We found him, but we don't know how he got there as it was quite a ways away from where we had lost him and he couldn't have made it there on his own. Scorpius later told us he was waiting for the nice lady who said she would find us for him."
Harry laughed at that, throwing his head back and guffawing until his eyes watered. Dyers went red in the face, grumbling, "You lot should stop being such overachievers and quit trying to revolutionise things around here. It's a pain in the arse for the rest of us."
"Also, maybe slow down a bit? Your paperwork's not going anywhere," Harry said as he came to flop down in his chair.
He remembered feeling confused about why exactly Percy was thanking him, and reading this so many years later, he felt the same way. If anything, Percy should've blamed him for what had happened, not thanked him. Rubbing his eyes, he slowly moved down to George's message. He remembered asking George to write it and then almost forcing him to write something when he refused to. He wanted to hit himself for that, now.
"Pleasure," Harry said, nodding once. "Well, er, I know my appointment isn't for a couple of hours, so I could come back later…"
The burly bloke growled and stepped close, barely an inch between them, and spat to the side. She didn't even flinch. Her eyes grew cold, and the smirk dropped off her face as she raised her wand and Scoured the spittle off her cheek. She then murmured something, and before he could register what she'd said, there was the sound of splintering wood, and he felt a sharp stab between his shoulder blades.
"Harry," Neville said, reaching forward and grasping his arm. "He's dead. Voldemort is dead. You killed him."
"A very good afternoon to you too, Draco," the man said, strolling around the shop before coming up to the counter. "Has the new shipment not come in, yet? Your racks are nearly empty."
Draco laughed, a short, almost human-like sound, and Harry had to restrain the urge to kiss him. He wasn't sure whether it was the blond's Veela powers that drew him to Draco so fiercely or if it was something within himself responding to the other man's presence, but he was sure of one thing: he wasn't about to force his muddled feelings on—
Harry. This isn't the first time I'm travelling. Besides—" she jangled her purse, grinning. "Hermione's bags are extremely useful. I'm barely carrying any luggage."
Draco clawed at his shirt, and he reached into his pocket to pull out a syringe. He jabbed the needle into the blond’s thigh and pushed down on the plunger, hoping beyond hope the antidote worked and reversed the transformation.
The woman shook her head. "No. I just heard that someone was looking for them—their daughter, if I'm not mistaken."
Camilla sighed softly as she stood, shot Harry a smile, and touched his shoulder as she walked past.
He reached over and squeezed Draco's shoulder. "Now we just have to catch this bastard and we can get your son back to you."
Harry couldn't say he hadn't expected her to bring it up, but he had thought she would discuss it with Ginny first. Molly took his hand in hers and smiled at him. "I know it's difficult for you to take care of them without Ginny, seeing how you're at work so much of the time, and while both Arthur and I enjoy spending time with the children, we think it's been far too long since you pulled them out of school. It's important for them to be in the company of other children their age and have return to a daily routine."
"How I mourn my mother is up to me," I say, already sick to death of Pansy's antics. "My father chooses to drown his sorrows by the bottle, while I choose to invest the inheritance my mother left me to bring her long-treasured love for flower arrangements to life."
"Hermione, I'm doing everybody a favour, alright? We all know the DMLE's been eyeing you to take up one of their vacant posts for
"They're finally gone!" he exclaimed, referring to his missing milk teeth. They hadn't fallen out and had to be removed since the new ones were already growing in.
Frozen to the spot, Harry felt torn between the rising feeling of guilt that he was the reason Malfoy was having an argument with his wife and the fact that it was none of his business what was going on on the other side of the door. But even as he inhaled deeply and closed his eyes, his mind instructing him to walk straight to the couch and pretend to be oblivious to everything that he had overheard, being the person that he was, he couldn't just let it go.
Ron nodded, beaming. "Yeah. We've already discussed the logistics and everything. George wants to add two more floors to Zonko's and convert the topmost into a proper lab. He wants to add another floor to this one, too, but I keep telling him that two floors is already enough."
Harry grimaced at that. "I'm only trying to keep you safe. We don't know yet if Macnair was working alone or with an accomplice. And considering there've been two threats to your life in the past three days, we thought it prudent that someone guard you, for the time being."
Harry started, and then quickly tried to mask his surprise, but Malfoy had noticed his reaction because he had sat up, a knowing look on his face. So, instead, Harry said in a strained voice, "Yes, that would be me."
"He saved my life," Draco said matter-of-factly. "I didn't see a reason to refuse him. Think of it as me turning over a new leaf, if you'd like."
"Shite," I swear as I begin to stand, wanting to confer with the driver on whether or not I was on the wrong route. The bus abruptly comes to a halt just then, and I lose my balance, stumbling to the side just as somebody hurriedly hops onto the bus.
Draco found himself smiling before he realised it, and Harry frowned, his cheeks colouring in embarrassment. "It's rude to laugh," he groused, which made Draco laugh anyway, and he came around to straighten the sheets.
"Harry," I say as he nearly falls asleep at the table. "Maybe you should head home. You don't look too good."
Harry stared at the parchment for a long moment, heart hammering away in his chest, and he thought back to all the regrets he had because of the things he had been too afraid to take action on. He decided once and for all that this was something he
Malfoy's smile widened. "Absolutely. And I'll take this moment to also remind and assure you that we follow a very strict non-disclosure policy. Once you sign the initial two, we are bound by, what you could even imagine being, a form of the Unbreakable Vow."
Hermione scoffed. "You think Ginny'd throw a party and not invite those two?" she replied. "Thanks."
Once Harry was settled down in his usual spot, he sat back and sighed, replaying what he had just witnessed.
Harry smiled. It wasn't often that Buxley complimented one of his men. "I'd like to have a chat with Rogers after this vase case has been dealt with, then. I think it's time you had a deputy of your own, seeing how much you've got on your plate of late. If you agree, of course," he added as the other man's eyes widened.
He eyed the fancy, elegant writing on the front of the envelope as he unfolded the letter, and turned to read what it said.
The younger man saluted smartly before taking the papers. "Very well, sir. Thank you for asking. I've actually been meaning to come in and give you my thanks."
Mr Simpson rushed up to them just then, standing a little away awkwardly until they separated and acknowledged him. "We're looking everywhere, but he doesn't seem to be on the premises."
He desperately needed to spend time with Ginny and the kids to wash off the terrible feeling that was slowly accumulating in and around him. It was suffocating him, and he had no way of fighting it off except by putting on a brave face. He envied Neville, just then, for having Hannah to go back home to, and almost regretted doing this for his sake, but he caught himself before he went down that path.
They rushed to the director's tent, Hermione hardly able to string two words together, and Draco explained the situation to the camp's director, who told them that they could take all the time they needed. They Disapparated and arrived just on the outskirts of the township. Hermione ran to the nearest payphone and dialled the number, her face full of hope. But, with every moment that the phone went unanswered, her hope seemed to be dwindling.
Harry looked over his shoulder one last time before turning back to Hermione. "Yeah, I'm fine. I just thought I saw someone I knew."
She glanced at him sideways, her annoyance evident, and Harry cleared his throat. "Yeah, sorry 'bout that. I didn't really know how else to get a hold of you."
To his surprise, Granger rolled her eyes and said, "Ron's stupidity is precisely why I'm here, asking you of all people for help."
He stared at the picture on the top of the pile idly, wondering where he had seen it before. Flipping it over, he read the familiar, narrow scrawl, his mind taking a moment to catch up with what he was seeing.
Malfoy shrugged. "Everyone calls you all sorts of things all the time. It doesn't matter, though, does it? Won't change the fact that you're just Harry Potter, the boy who got caught up in things a million times bigger than him."
Harry nodded, and they sat silently as the waiter brought their appetisers and drinks. Once he left, Camilla took a long swig of her wine, and then began to speak.
Or, otherwise, one of them would snap at something the other said, leading to two outcomes: either they would argue about it for a good couple of minutes before breaking out in awkward laughter and continuing the conversation, or, like what had just happened, the other wouldn't take the bait, and the conversation would end, just like that.
Angelina finally nodded and looked towards where her husband and sister-in-law were, a somewhat worried expression on her face.
"Have a good day," he says, shooting me a bright smile, and before my baffled brain is able to come up with a response, he's stepped off the bus and the doors have swung shut.
"For this session," the blond was saying, "I recommend that you go see Mr Hussain on the first floor for acupressure treatment. I think you'll find that you'll be able to fall asleep much easier after that."
Harry processed what Malfoy had just said before replying. "Meaning they don't treat anybody differently because of their families?" Malfoy's smile widened, and Harry saw Silver Sprigs go up to first place in his mental list. "That sounds perfect. Especially considering discrimination was the main reason I had to pull my kids out from their previous pre-school," he admitted. "Although, exorbitant fees makes me rethink my decision..."
They laughed, and Audrey waved goodbye as she made her way down the street. She then ducked into the nearest alleyway, and Harry knew she had Disapparated. He stood there a moment longer before making his way back home. He'd decided to Floo to Antares that day instead of Apparating, for a change, since Malfoy had gone out of his way to leave the fireplace in his office open for Harry.
Mr Simpson cleared his throat, looking somewhat confused by how tense the two were. "Er, if I may," he ventured, flinching when Draco glared down at him. "He couldn't have gotten that far; I'm sure there's no need to involve the authorities…"
Ginny's suspicious behaviour is causing all sorts of thoughts to go off in Harry's head, and just after a pleasant afternoon reuniting with the kids and getting some work done, she stumbles into his study, drunk. Although their banter is affectionate and leaves Harry with warm feelings, a sudden phone call for Ginny from an unfamiliar number sets Harry off once again. What is it that his wife is hiding from him, and how many more lies will they tell each other?
"Camilla McMahon?" Harry repeated the name she had offered in introduction. She titled her head in the slightest, her smile widening.
Camilla took a swig of her wine and smiled, seeming at peace, making Harry wonder if he had imagined her earlier breakdown. "I reckon so," she said.
He glanced sideways as Harry came to stand beside him, placing an arm around his waist when he swayed. "Drunk enough to apologise for snapping at you before," he murmured, bowing his head. "That was presumptuous of me."
"Any chance I'll get to speak with him?" When Harry shot him an incredulous look, Neville held his hands up and nodded. "Thought as much."
She smiled up at Harry, and he thanked her, watching her bustle away before turning to eye the far table. Neville was sitting there, barely discernable from the shadows, drinking what looked to be much too strong a drink for that time of day. Harry walked over and stood right in front of the table before Neville noticed him.
They consisted of trinkets, memorabilia, keepsakes, and other odd pieces of junk that he was sure he'd only kept because of their sentimental value. He picked up a mirror shard and instantly recognised it as being part of the mirror Sirius had given him. Dispelling thoughts related to Sirius, he set the shard aside and turned to the other things.
"I wonder why," Hermione grumbled from behind her husband as she inspected the boxes. "Ron! These are all the latest models! How much did you spend on these?"
He looked up, a sudden thought occurring to him. Eyes wide and heart racing, he picked up the file and reread all the information he had on Hertzfeld.
"Mum told me you were looking for a pre-school, and I remembered that Audrey recently started working in one that isn't all that far off."
"'Dunno," Lily said innocently, and he Levitated the bundle onto the table, unwilling to get dirt on his hands.
"Looks like you lot've had a rough start to your week, eh?" George said with a wide grin, coming up to him and pulling him into a rough hug.
"Yeah, OK, I'll talk so enough with your melodramatic tall tales," Draco said, washing down the sausage roll with some coffee. He smacked his lips at the bitterness.
The electronic ticket reader chimes as Harry touches his travel card to it, and as the bus jerks into motion, he quickly slips into the nearest empty seat.
Padma merely shrugged a shoulder. "I don't have enough evidence to make that claim, but everything that I told you so far comes directly from the horse's mouth—and by that, I mean my dear friend who headed the investigation."
For a moment, nothing happened, and he was about to say the spell again when a box flew straight at him, hitting him in the gut and sending him sprawling across the floor. He groaned as he pulled himself up and dusted his clothes. Muttering about cookbooks and better control over spells, he'd just started down the stairs when there was a creak behind him.
"You better be here exactly at eight or else," Harry said from the other end of the line. Draco couldn't help but think, once again, that he loved how deep the brunet's voice sounded on the phone.
"No one can ever forgive someone completely, Harry. That's what makes us human. We may get past something or learn to forget and move on, but we never completely forgive."
She asked him to wait for a moment and he listened to her converse with someone else, and just as she started to say something to him, he blurted out, "Ginny, there's something I have to tell you."
He shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant, and motioned to where Ginny and George were having an animated conversation by the kitchen isle. "Maybe she answered the phone herself and doesn't remember. She was pretty hammered last night."
He picked up the two mugs of coffee and walked up to the blond, sitting down beside him and offering him one. Draco took it from him with a slight bow of his head, his focus still on the article he was reading, which had a picture of him with the bloody message and flashes going off on the right side of the page.
"If so, then allow me to say, your spell work has advanced magnificently. I'm quite surprised that you were the person walking beside Camilla yesterday."
"A lie is a very poor way to say hello," Draco groused, and Harry chuckled, pushing himself up from the other's lap.
Something was wrong. His nightmares had never caused him any physical pain before. But no matter how much he tried to distract himself, he couldn't shake off the empty, gnawing sensation in his abdomen.
"It is," the blond agreed, "but, like I said, if my friend finds your vase to be valuable, you're not going to have a problem."
He yelped and threw out an arm to steady himself. Looking down, he came face to face with a boy who looked no older than James. His dirty blond curls and freckled nose gave him a look of innocence, but there was nothing innocent about the loaf of bread in his arm or the red welt on his cheek. Before Harry could react, piercing blue eyes locked with his own emerald ones, and the boy pressed a finger to his lip before scrambling away.
As I focus on the rhythmic clicking sounds of the heel of my brand new Oxfords against the vinyl floor, willing the bus to move faster, I belatedly register the blur of green passing by through the opposite window. It takes me a few seconds to realise that the bus isn't taking the city route, and I stiffen, inhaling sharply, unwilling to accept that my tardiness had caused to me to board the wrong bus.
"Potter, I presume?" the man asked, his voice like birdsong, so pure and gentle that it could move one to tears.
The man nodded once, and she threw her head back, a peal of maniacal laughter spilling from her painted lips. "Oh, I knew I made the right decision in tracking you down."
Impressed, Harry picked up a crumpet and bit into it, humming at the explosion of blueberry in his mouth. "This is good."
Dominique raised her eyebrows and crossed her arms, and Louis seemed to instantly realise his mistake. He opened his mouth, making to say something, but his sister beat him to it.
"Alright then, Harry." She smiled at him as he took his seat and then turned to the waiter who had come to take their order.
He pointed his wand at the blotch on the carpet and sighed as he watched the ink retract back and then form a blob, filling the pot after it fixed itself. Leaning down, he picked the pot of ink and placed it carefully on the desk, pushing it away from the edge just in case.
"Me too." They walked to the fireplace, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder in his hand, and with a smile to Malfoy, he ducked under the mantle.
"I—I—" he stammered, unsure of what to say, his muddled mind numb and confused, the wine warm in his stomach and like cotton in his head.
"Still doesn't explain why you went and got pissed out of your mind in the middle of the day, though," Ron said, eyebrows raised.
"Yeah… they weren't very bad at first, just passing nightmares, but they've been getting very vivid, and very real, of late. Almost like they're visions." He shuddered at the thought, absentmindedly touching his scar.
The blond shook his head and looked away. "No, I was just thinking that you've spent more time babysitting me than leading the investigation, as you're supposed to."
"That's it, come here. I'll keep you safe," Draco cooed. Harry looked hesitantly from Draco to the eyes above him, then looked back up at the boy and his outstretched arms. Slowly he reached out and took the boy's hand before being pulled into a tight hug. He didn't realize how cold he was till the warmth enveloped him.
Bubo flew to the window then pushed it open, causing a blast of wind to flood over the room. Theo laughed as papers came off the tables and everyone scrambled to try and catch the papers. Harry on the other hand was frozen in place as scents drifted in through the opening, his eyes seeming to focus on something distantly. Without warning Harry leapt at the nearest object, his fur standing on end as his eyes darted wildly around the room. Thankfully Neville had stayed in his creature form and withstood the large fox creature landing on his chest and throwing him to the floor. Snarling teeth clicked together inches from Neville’s throat as he struggled to keep the Harry Kitsune at bay. Luna and Hermione where both yelling at him to stop before a large weight crashed into Harry’s side.
Harry watched as Ghost then approached him only to start shoving him towards a broom closet. Taken off guard he tried to push back only to have Ghost snap at his hands. He jumped away from the hyena, arms raised above his head as he yelped. "Fine! Fine! I'm going!" he yelled. As he turned he ran into something soft and solid, and looking up he recognized the greasy locks.
"How did this happen," the cold tone made him look up into his master's face. Voldemort stood over him silently, expecting an answer.
Severus tilted the collar in his own hands, trying to sense the magic used. “This is quite extensive,” he stated as he inspected it. Pausing when he noticed something written on the inside of it. The initials DLM where scrawled there. “I think your hypothesis is right, his initials are even on the inside. Narcissa must have known this might happen.”
"Goodnight dragon," LeFay whispered as Draco curled up against his chest. Draco murmured something in reply but he couldn't make it out before the two of them fell asleep.
LeFay sat in his little sitting room just off his bedroom, a tea cup pressed to his lips as he silently took in the man across from him. He too had a cup to his lips, but his eyes were on the fire, and a blanket was wrapped tight around his shoulders.
“That’s just gross,” Draco gagged a little as he turned away from his mother. “I’m going back to my room.” Narcissa watched him walk away, and smiled a little. Any mother could see when their child was hiding something, and the slight pink tint to Draco’s cheeks was unmistakable.
“Chill Theo. This one is still learning, I’m sure you’ll find a perfect mate for yourself, and one that’s not Harry Potter,” Draco stated. Harry didn’t catch it but Draco’s eyes flashed violet for a moment as he glared at Theo. Theo lowered his gaze and waved them off.
“Nagas!” Bill yelled. Remus fired off a spell next to him, and Harry didn’t even see his other father till the Grim sprang at the side of the Nagas.
"I was actually just leaving. The door opened earlier and I wanted to see what was inside it. I wasn't aware-."
LeFay was instantly on his feet, taking the steps in threes as he pushed through everyone to the middle of the room. Everything slowed around him as the team was rushed to the hospital wing, and he froze when he saw the coiled body of his best friend lying there on the cold floor. A giant gash went up the side of the magnificent snake, exposing bone and muscle. Worse yet was the symbol cared into his familiar head, an obvious calling card as he spotted the Order's phoenix carved into the flesh and bone. Albus knew he knew.
“Ahh, someone who actually knows our customs,” chuckled Hisashi, “Much more impressive than when we met LeFay. The young kit almost lost his life the first time we met,” the white fox said wistfully.
"You swore your life to me, did you not?!" LeFay had no need to raise his voice. Just talking alone held the power to still Snape's heart beat out of fear.
"Well I see you've kept almost the same taste in design, and not just your clothing," Draco jabbed as his hip pressed further into the dresser behind him. He glanced over his shoulder at it, looking for an escape route.
"Shouldn't we be going? I would think LeFay gave us new orders during the meeting," Hati said as he placed his hands on his brother's shoulders.
"He made me think killing, that splitting my soul would make me stronger. In the end it made me mad and he was able to control my actions. Able to bend me into his toy, his straw-man. Severus how was I so blind?!" he snapped, his knuckles were white as he gripped the bed harder. Severus sighed, sucking in a deep breath as he turned away from the former mad man.
“Moving on then. As for the room and classes,” Minerva started, “After further discussion about the two of you and your current predicament I have allowed the request to share a room. However, do to an influx of students with creature inheritances the two of you will be taking almost all your classes together. You may have one class that is separate, so I suggest the two of you look over your schedules and reevaluate your classes. Originally Hogwarts was not accepting students with creature inheritances but because of Dumbledore’s death the rules have been reset to what the Founders wanted for Hogwarts. That includes all the classes that Albus banned as well, so I also suggest you two look at those classes as well before making a full decision.”
Sirius stepped into the room and looked over the two. “What do we have here?” he asked as he looked at the letter in Harry’s hand and at the unopened on still on the table. Harry looked up from the letter and smiled slightly.
He made his way there, twisting through the out door paths till he could see the tall bushes peaking out. He was surprised to find the place pretty much abandoned. He’d thought that, with all the people at the LeFay castle, there would be at least a few people milling about here. Shrugging he entered the maze, reaching out his hands to stroke the bushes as he passed. Overall, finding his way to the middle was a pleasant experience, that was until he started to hear voices. He ducked behind the last thick parts of the bushes, crouching low and hoping he hadn’t been spotted at the opening.
“You’re wrong Cadmael. I don’t deserve either of you. I’m a monster hiding behind a mask of kindness and gratitude. I’m not who I used to be when I was younger, and even with you, I have to hide a part of myself. Draco avoided Tatsuya last time, and even when I see that part of myself I can’t help but shake. It’s terrifying,” Harry muttered as he looked down at Cadmael’s face.
Well that explained why Luna acted so strangely. “That must be really cool. Have you gone and talked to any of the unicorns in the Dark Forest?” Harry asked. Luna shook her head and sighed.
P.S. I Honestly wanted to write more for this chapter, but I thought where I ended the chapter was probably the proper place.
Clearing his throat, Draco shook it off and turned his gaze to the fire place, “So why is it green all around the castle within the wards?” he asked.
"He saw something that non of us could, Voldemort, or rather Tom," he stopped. "Draco, the world isn't what we thought it was. There is so much more to Harry than even Dumbledore new."
With a roar Draco crashed out of the dust cloud, talons out as he went in for a swipe at Cadmael’s back while firing another spell off with his opposite hand. There was a bellow that came from Cadmael as the talons landed and slashed open his back, blood gushing down through his fur. The spell hit his calf, dropping to his knee before he turned, slashing out with both claws and fangs at Draco. Nearly getting him as Draco disappeared back into the dust cloud.
"Just do it, but don't move to fast," Harry ushered, watching the two like a hawk. He was afraid if he moved any closer Ghost might see Neville as a threat and actual launch a physical attack.
“That was amazing Harry!” Bill stated and clapped a hand on Harry’s back. Harry smiled but didn’t take his eyes off the black dragon. Bill looked from Harry to the dragon; still drinking from the pool. He sighed and then squeezed Harry’s shoulder.
Harry and Draco both nodded before going to stand, bowing slightly before leaving with the rest of their ‘family.’
Draco nodded his understanding just as the doors closed. August, followed by Douglas, Skoll, Cadmael and Severus funneled in. As everyone took their seats or knelt, Douglas and Skoll brought Cadmael before LeFay, snapping the chain holding him to a ring in the floor.
Charlie and Bill try to help Draco with his dragoness but finds there is more to it. Harry tries to bring Draco back to his own consciousness but finds himself losing himself along the way.
Harry was torn, his nails digging hard into his palms as he glared down at Cadmael. His attention was drawn by the quick movement of Draco’s wand, and he found himself leaping up from his chair as Draco fired a spell straight into the face of Cadmael while he was looking up at LeFay. There was a massive wave of magic as the two were thrown from each other. LeFay was already leaping over the banister as both men laid prone on the ground. Severus ran for Draco, propping Draco’s head up with his knee as he quickly looked over his godson.
Cadmael grunted, “Hogwarts, he’s posing as a board director,” he managed to say before Severus caught him, undoing the chains and bringing him over to a chair.
“You shut up,” Dean said and turned to grab both of her hands and pulled them behind her back. Seamus pulled out his wand and pointed it at Harry, starting to cast a spell.
It was around 9am when they finally arrived at Gringotts, all of them gathered in the room next to the one they would be using for the will reading. One of the goblins waved a hand and the wall separating the room became transparent, at least to this side. “I hope this will suffice? No one on the other side will be able to see in, but this way your security for Harry will not be impeded.”
Draco's eyes seemed to flash purple for a moment before his grey eyes returned, there was no sign of emotion on his face. "That's not entirely true, but it doesn't matter now. Even if it wasn't completely you that did it, you still had some control when Harry placed the collar on me," he stated.
“Can you tell me your name then?” he asked. Ammit looked up at his master, wondering what kind of conversation they could be having to make Harry ask that. The kitsune laughed at him, loudly this time and it felt like Harry’s head was being shook.
Draco is starting to second guess everything he has hoped for. Especially when a stranger starts creating a divide between the two.
"And no lying this time. We all know how that ended up," Draco snorted as he turned in his seat to far Harry.
“Well… Since Alchemy got out early and Neville and Luna had to leave for their one-on-one tutors I was left by myself. Everyone was acting weird so I decided to go ahead to the room Draco and I share. I know it was against the rules, but I didn’t really feel comfortable where I was. I ran into Theo and Hermione on my way to the class and they asked if I wanted them to walk me there, and I declined. Which honestly, knowing what happened it would have been better if I did,” Harry sighed and then lifted a hand to rub his forehead.
The hyena, upon hearing it's name stood up, sniffing loudly as it looked between Snape and Dumbledore.
“There are an extra five rules. Number one, there will be no using any animagus gifts around other students. As most of you know, or at least I’d hope you’d know, your animagus forms are usually the true forms of the creatures you gained your inheritance from. As this may scare some of the other students, it will not be allowed. However, doing so in your own rooms, during one on one sessions with tutors, or during the study hall after classes; will be allowed. Number two, in the light of the situation and knowing many of you will be feeling the chemical and emotional personality changes of your creature inheritances, I expect there will be a lot more duels. I expect these to be fair, and rather than a single teacher or staff being present there must be at least two, along with one of the school’s med witches. Number three, if there is any friction between any of you and another student I want it reported to your head of house immediately. This is for your safety as well as any student not present at this moment. Due to creature inheritances being rare among wizards, and some of those creatures being rarer still, some of you may be targeted. This leads into the next rule. Rule Number four, no one in this room is allowed to move around anywhere in the castle without your support or other attendant. I know this may be hard for many of you, but this rule is absolute. Rule Number five, the last but not least. If anyone is having any trouble, or needs anything due to their creature inheritance please go straight to either myself of Professor Snape. Do not go to anyone else. Each house's head has been informed of your statuses, however, not all of them are experienced enough to help you,” McGonagall clapped her hands together as she finished speaking and food appeared on the table.
Dragoon cleared his throat as he finished and looked up at Sirius who was visibly shaken. “Dragoon are you able to see what the creature inheritance is?” Sirius asked.
Harry nodded and jogged ahead, stopping when he came to the small clearing with a large rock in the middle. “We should rest here a while. Charlie, have you been able to pick out anything?” Sirius asked. Charlie glanced around, picking up something off the ground.
Bill nodded, his eyes switching from Minerva to Charlie who seemed distant. Harry chewed the inside of his cheek, wondering if he should inform them of the letter he and Draco had gotten before he disappeared. Remus seemed to notice his distress.
“Shh, just drink,” Harry said softly, tipping the bowl to Cadmael’s lips. At first it didn’t look like it worked till Cadmael started to relax, and then a soft gold light started to form between them, hesitantly reaching out to Draco too. There was a moment of silence as the dusty veins of gold wrapped around the three of them, and a ring started to form around the three men. Almost like the first breath of spring finally hit, there was a mysterious breeze that formed the room just as the magic settled, pushing Severus back gently before the magic faded.
“Sirius Black I presume then," Sirius nodded, "We were wondering when you would come to claim the Lord title one you were since you had been declared innocent after Petegrew’s capture. We thought you would have come right after but you never turned up,” the goblin sneered. “Since I am also the Keeper of the Black Vault’s I will be happy to talk them over with you, but I suggest the wills and inheritance test be done before. My name is Baxeka Dragoon. Call on me after." Sirius was confused for a moment before the goblin chuckled, “We are having all of our major vault holders go through inheritance tests, especially those in line for any Lordship.”
"Yea, I'm fine. Neville, a hand please?" Harry asked as he flushed slightly with embarrassment. Neville chuckled and helped Harry up, smiling at him before patting him on the back.
“Severus, I believe you have a few more potions to administer before we continue,” LeFay pointed, his free hand then landing on Draco’s head, and coming through the young dragonlings’ hair.
“Don’t blame him, he swore an oath to protect me. That includes protecting me from people I didn’t know if I could trust,” LeFay said as glanced at Draco from the corner of his eye.
Tatsuya spoke, his voice quietly ghosting through Harry’s thoughts. Harry nodded and smiled, tomorrow then!
“Are you ready?” Charlie asked as he stopped beside the group. Harry lifted his head from his food and smiled hesitantly. “Good, McGonagall would like to do it now,” with that he walked away with Bill trailing behind him. Harry looked over his friends and took a deep breath before standing.
“I heard Parvati yelling and then there was a chaos of hissing noises. I don’t know where they came from but the sounded very angry. I was trying hard to stay conscious when I saw Seamus standing over me with his wand above me,” Harry bit his lip hard, he couldn’t believe Seamus would turn on him like this. “He said that if he turned me in he’d be rich. The next thing I knew though there was a black blur and Seamus was tackled by something, or someone. I’m not sure though. It was pretty big, that’s when I blacked out,” he finished and gripped his blankets.
LeFay felt a spark in his chest, one Tatsuya felt also, as he looked at Draco. Feeling the sudden stirring of long-forgotten emotions. Tatsuya was right though, Draco hadn't changed much. Even his appearance didn't seem all that different.
“Then with that I will call this reading to a close. Please use the exits at the back of the room,” he paused to look down at Regulus and Harry, “I will see the two of you in the next room. Oh, and Severus as well. We have other things to speak on.”
Noticing Harry was sniffling again Draco lifted his grey gaze to the wizard and nosed under his chin. It was weird comforting one Harry Potter, but who would? Harry had obviously charmed the area around his bed so no one could hear him at night, which only left Draco-no Ghost, there.
Minerva sighed, tilting her head slightly before pursing her lips. “You have two days to complete an animagus transformation. Everyone else going already knows how to, and if what I’m understanding from Charlie’s suggestion you are going to need to be able to. If you are able to become an animagus within those two days, come to my office and show me. If I deem it acceptable then you may go with them,” she paused and then turned to leave, “Remember Mister Potter. Two days.”
Potter was the first to wake in the house, yet, he continued to lay on his back; simply staring at the attic ceiling. Sleeping last night had been hard, especially with the three tails slapping around in his bed. He finally sat up, yawned, and then climbed out bed to stretch. He stopped in front of the mirror to stare at himself.
Severus inhaled sharply before nodded, giving a slight bow to Draco before he left the room. "Goodnight my prince," Severus said softly. Draco merely looked away and closed his eyes as the door closed.
“Seriously,” he mumbled as he backed up against the fireplace. Red eyes blinked at him and one of them moved towards him, before he could react, he was pinned to the fire place.
Harry sat on his bed, tired from today’s classes. Even with the time he took to try and get closer to his ‘true form’ it didn’t seem like it was going anywhere. He even skipped supper along with lunch, taking both in his room. He sighed as Ammit stared at him from inside his cocoon of blankets. Harry cast a tempus charm to check the time, scoffing at it.
"Snape did say something about him being bred specifically for being a familiar, so he was able to hold magic or some such," Harry stated, rubbing the back of his head as he tried to remember what exactly Snape had said. "He seems to understand English I think too," Harry added as he thought about what had happened on the way back to the Gryffindor Tower. "Of course, he doesn't really seem to listen to anything you say though," Harry stated as he thought about the incident with Neville.
Remus watched Dragoon warily as the goblin cast a quick cleaning charm to remove any blood left over. Kneesprocket stepped up in front of Lupin to lead him into position. He did as he was instructed, not paying any attention to the others as Dragoon came over to Sirius with a small box, opening it and showing him the Black Ring.
Harry watched in horror as Tatsuya started to attack the wolves ruthlessly, giving their members a face full of claws and antlers. 'Don't kill them!' LeFay yelled as he tried to take control again. Tatsuya simply shoved his host's mind away, lunging at the closest attacker again. LeFay could feel their body being picked up in a wolf's jaws and tossed into a snow field were they skidding to a stop.
“If Shibee is unneeded Shibee will leave and then come back in half an hour to escort Lord LeFay and Mister Malfoy down to the Great Hall,” Shibee stated as she pulled her hands behind her back. Harry turned around and nodded at Shibee, who disappeared with a pop.
"Don't fire!" Skoll yelled as the smoke started to clear. There was consistent coughing as the group of werewolves slowly became visible, the circles wands dropping slowly. "We need healers quickly," Skoll shouted as he held his arm, glancing back at his team. "LeFay, its Ammit."
Harry was confused and lifted his eyebrow. He must have been deep in thought. “All I did was ask you a question,” Harry countered and scowled at him. Draco huffed before looking over the bed.
Draco continued the day shoveling through the leaning tower of paper, writing out stocks and order forms one after the other. He was glad that he had something to keep his mind off the search for LeFay, but as hours passed he'd still end up thinking about him. When he did finally get to the end of the stack, he felt very pleased with himself. He stood and straightened out his robes before heading out to relax in the sitting room.
“He’ll be back to his venomous self in no time. You’ll see,” Bill stated. Harry tried to smile, and nodded his head. Watching Draco like this made his chest hurt, and he couldn’t quite place why. In all honesty, he didn’t even know if they were friends or if Draco had just been acting the part.
“The Harry we knew wasn’t Harry. It was a molded shell of a wizard Albus cultivated to his liking,” Draco sneered. It dawned on him that even the Harry he'd thought he'd gotten to known wasn't real. Not the golden child, not the happy go lucky one, not the one that had shared banter with him these last months.
Draco lifted his grey-white gaze from the book and up at Harry's face. They definitely weren't very good friends if that's how Harry felt, and it explained why Harry always seemed tired and did badly in class though. The book he had was pretty intensely high level reading, something that definitely required lots of concentration. Draco felt kinda bad now, but not that bad, just because he was reading book like this didn't mean he was actually better than he was in class. Draco turned away from the book and then laid down on the bed, his short fluffy tail curling slightly around his hind quarters.
“It must be taking about Draco. It must think you two are bonded. I’ll talk to you about it after,” Remus croaked.
"Here lean on me, I know the transition can be hard on your body if you've been in your animagus form for a long time," he stated as he felt Draco's legs shaking.
He sighed as he made his way through the hallways, mumbling about which homework he would start first when he got back. That was until he bumped into something, stumbling he fell backwards onto his rump. This stone floor had not traction suitable for his paws and it irritated him. “Ouch,” he said quietly before looking up at the object he had run into. Looking down at him was Theodore Nott, with none other but Hermione trying to peek over him.
LeFay really had changed, even the way he looked at Draco. He could pick out new scars along LeFay's arms were the sleeves didn't cover, some crisscrossing his face and catching the light. Harry's bolt was gone, replaced by a new scare that extended over his right eye, ending just under it. Another crossed over it on cheek, the one just last a small nick on his upper lip. It looked pretty fresh compared to the others.
Harry looked up from gathering the documents he'd forgotten at home when he heard the telltale hiss of the Floo. Striding over to it, he got on his knees and stuck his head under the mantle. The burning logs fizzled, and Ron's face appeared in the fireplace.
Harry ran a hand down his face and swore loudly. Sometimes he wondered if his lot purposely ignored instructions just to drive him up the wall.
Harry shook his head. "I still don't understand. Why didn't I go back to my world? Why am I connected to you?"
Harry scoffed in disbelief. "You say that so nonchalantly that I almost believed this had nothing to do with you for a second there."
Ginny shook her head. "No, she just knew about me coming back early, so she only agreed since I promised her she wouldn't have to miss out on going to the carnival. Ron was a right git about the whole thing, though."
"He is a German wizard under trial for murder," Padma repeated, her voice tight. "Whatever evidence you have can be submitted to us, and we shall go about the appropriate channels to determine his innocence—or guilt."
"Yes, but at least during the holidays." She gave him a stubborn look, and Neville turned to Harry helplessly.
Draco started, looking up at the woman standing before him, clearing his throat and smiling at her. "Yes, how may I help you?"
It didn't matter to him that people still resented him for the post he held. That was something he'd learned to deal with throughout his life. But it didn't make it any easier knowing that things had to be done in a roundabout method for him to get what was rightfully his in the first place. It was like the Headmaster refusing to give a student a gold medal just because he thought he'd received too many already.
Just as Harry was thinking about how Hermione would love to come and spend afternoons in there reading all the books lining the bookshelves—that he'd assumed were all medical books and the like, but had found books on economics, politics and even travel among them—Malfoy returned, looking rather harassed.
"Nothing," Ginny replied a little too quickly. "Nothing at all. There's just stuff that I need to take care of, alright?"
Rubbing his face with his palms, he made a mental note to remind Ginny to sit her father down and tell him to stop spoiling their kids rotten. Every time they dropped the kids over at the Burrow, which was more often than he'd like to admit, the trio would return with some present or the other. It was bad enough that they barely hesitated before demanding for something—and that he and Ginny bought it for them without question. It was about time to draw a line. He refused to let his kids grow into spoiled brats. The next thing he knew, they'd be counting their presents by the dozen.
"I'm telling you, he's dead," she was saying to her friend, beside herself with excitement. "Hung himself, they said."
Three weeks of desperately searching for something to do—to the extent that he had even considered working as a janitor in the Ministry, if worse came to worst... but his pride shut down the very idea before he could think on it any further.
He jumped out of the way as two boys rushed past him, arms stretched out on either side, until their mothers caught them by the ears and yelled at them. Harry smiled as he made his way to the lifts and decided that he would go see his kids once he was done for the day. He was used to going days without spending time with them, if he got home after they were in bed and left before they woke up, but somehow, of late, he missed them much more than he usually did.
"I don't know," Harry whispered, wondering for himself why he was taking everything into stride so simply. "Maybe I'm just that simple-minded."
"Can't we just carry him, sir?" the lad he'd saved from going overboard asked, and Harry shook his head.
Effectively distracted, the three children cheered and sat cross-legged on the floor, watching excitedly as their grandmother Levitated the plates down to them.
Walking down the footpath, he looked around idly, taking in the bustling Muggle town in all its glory. He hadn't really paid it much attention on his way to the café because of the rain and him getting lost, but now that he had nothing better to do, he decided that he might as well take a walk and get his thoughts in order.
"I predict that you and Hermione will be good friends in the future," Harry called after him, and Draco walked off with a scoff. Him and Granger, friends? What a load of poppycock.
Harry sighed and tightened his grip on Lily's hand as they made their way down Diagon Alley. He had managed to leave work early because it had turned out to be a rather slow day, and his presence wasn't actually required. Since he had the time, he decided that he would bring his kids to Diagon for the afternoon and drop off the vase in his vault before his appointment with Malfoy.
"I'm not a big eater," Draco replied, pushing his arms through the sleeves and sighing as the warmth enveloped him. "Thanks for the coat."
"Oh, yes, thank you." He handed her the bouquet and watched as she undid the wrapping and replaced the flowers in the glass jar beside the bed with it. He waited awkwardly till she was done and walked up to him, her eyes never leaving the floor. He had half a mind to apologise to her, but he remained silent.
"Seriously, quit it," Draco hissed at Harry. "If you're going to keep hitting on me all evening, I'm leaving."
The ginger looked away and said, "It's fine that you didn't want to worry us and all, but don't go forcing Hermione to make promises that'll only make her worry more."
She looked to be on the brink of tears yet again, and Harry was at the end of his patience, but when she had mentioned the Blacks and Orion and Walburga, his heart had started to race. If this girl's story was true, it had become his duty as the proprietor of Grimmauld Place, and inheritor of everything belonging to it, to find this vase and return it to its rightful owner: him.
"Well, that just leaves you lot. Are the kids good to go?" Ron asked, hefting up his pants, much like his father did.
"Absolutely not. You're going to get into the bath and then we can talk about why you're covered in mud first thing in the morning."
He grabbed his coat and walked out the door, a confused Draco following behind him as he asked, "Where're we going?"
"Alright, you two, that's enough. Ron, Hermione's right. We don't really have any use for these phones. Especially the kids. What're they even going to do with Muggle phones? I don't want them getting used to them at such a young age, and you know they don't work anywhere
Harry stifled the urge to bang his head against the desk. If there was another thing he'd learnt from working with Kingsley for so long, it was that the man liked playing mind games. It made sense, why he did it, but that didn't make the process any more pleasant. In fact, he hated it when Kingsley found a constant need to beat around the bush before telling him exactly what he came to see him for.
"Please, don't be," the blond said as he took Harry's outstretched hand and shook it once. "Like I told Astoria, you are my priority. My family's going to be there whenever I get back. Shall I leave the Floo open for you?"
She pursed her lips, and Harry grinned as he pulled her into a hug. "I won't do anything stupid, Hermione. I've learned my lesson far too many times already."
Harry's eyes darkened and he squared his jaw. "Way to take a joke, mate." He rose and followed Hermione, leaving Draco feeling like
"They're driving me mad, Potter! Mad! And the German Ministry's refusing to give us even the slightest amount of information on the Barkridge case, despite us helping them close it. They keep saying that it's not our problem anymore, which is true, but that doesn't mean they can just get away with being tight-lipped about it! Not after barging in here without any prior notice and sending the whole Ministry into a frenzy!" Dyers said in a rush, his blue eyes bulging out of his head. "You're lucky you don't have to handle the mess of legal stuff that comes with every case you clear."
the one that can't let them go," he muttered as he tried to calm his racing heart and stabilise his breathing.
"Obviously they're not," she countered, following him back into the room. "Harry, this is serious. Maybe you should—"
Harry had to think about that for a moment. "I think they're mostly stress headaches. Or headaches from lack of sleep or not having eaten—the usual stuff."
When there was no answer, he swore under his breath and, pulling out his wand, pointed it at the banner.
"I've only been overseeing this case from the beginning and wasn't directly involved in the investigation," Harry explained. "I would be more useful here, where I won't be making the others' job more difficult by hovering over them and can ensure your safety." He placed a hand on Draco's knee in an effort to placate him. "I'm getting periodic updates and participating as much as necessary. As soon as the Aurors find your son, I'll take you to him."
She opened her mouth, paused, and then said, "I was just wondering—did you answer Ginny's phone last night, by any chance?"
"I wish my body worked like that," Hermione said wistfully. "I'm in a perpetual state of hunger and exhaustion these days."
She smiled, and everyone nodded, already looking around. "If you happen to see him, please bring him to one of us," Astoria said, motioning to the three of them with a sweeping gesture. "Thank you so much for your cooperation; it is greatly appreciated."
"Yeah. I was going to take the kids on Saturday, but I spoke to Jones—the Harpies' captain—and she said that they're leaving early Saturday morning, so Friday evening would be a better idea."
I inhale sharply, startled to have the subject of my recent emotional conflict sitting beside me. I smell a whiff of the familiar sweet scent again and involuntarily turn my head in the slightest to inhale again.
The corners of her mouth twitched as she tried to hide her smile. "Well, it's out of concern that she does what she does."
The voice announced their arrival on the first floor, and he stepped to the side as the two Healers exited the lift, leaving him alone in the rather spacious metal contraption. Just as his stomach let out a loud gurgle, the voice announced his destination, and the doors hissed open. Sighing, Harry quickly made his way out of the lift and walked straight down the hallway before coming to an abrupt stop.
He sat back and stared at his handiwork, feeling proud that he'd managed to take the first step. Nodding to himself confidently, he went about writing the rest of the letter.
Pulling back with a coy smile, she waved once, spun on her heel, and strode back the way she had come. By the time Harry glanced down at the file in his hands and back up, she was gone.
"I brought you here, Harry," he said, his eyes growing dark in the way they always did when he gathered his magic. "But this is not your world. It is mine. And I can't let you get involved in it."
His smile widened as he gestured to the wall behind him that was covered in photographs of his masterpieces. "Would I come off as sounding too arrogant if I were to agree?" he asked, although he was rather smug.
why the surname seemed so familiar. The Barkridges were one of the only pureblood noble families to have not taken part in Voldemort's madness, to the extent of moving out of the country and back to Germany before the first war. There's been news of the previous head of the family's appearance in Britain several times after the second war, to help rebuild homes and hospitals for those who suffered, which is probably where you remember the name from. But they never returned here, and haven't been in the news for a long while, now, which was why I had forgotten about them."
Malfoy clasped his hands and smiled serenely, reminding Harry once again that this man was completely different from the Draco Malfoy he knew.
Harry shrugged. "If you're going to insist I call you by your first name, then I'm going to insist you do the same, just so the awkwardness is mutual, if nothing else."
Buxley grumbled under his breath and excused himself, leaving Harry to pull on his coat and exit his office with a tired sigh. He clapped his men on the back and congratulated them on a job well done as he passed them by. Once he was out of the Ministry, it didn't take Harry very long to get home, have a nice, long bath, and take a power nap before he Floo-d down to the Burrow.
She nodded and offered him a reassuring smile. "And, although Kingsley had you believe otherwise, Robards was appointed as head of the undercover unit mostly because he offered to take the post. Your week off was just a convenient time for his promotion."
Hermione slid to the floor, hugging her knees to her chest and sobbing into her arms. Draco knelt beside her, a lump forming in his throat, not knowing how to help her. An idea came to him just then, and he ran a hand through his hair, deliberating if he should act on it, before deciding that, for Hermione's sake, it was necessary.
know," Hermione snapped, crossing her arms. "Please explain to me why you wasted so much money on buying
"I know," Harry said in an agitated voice. He was starting to develop a headache. "I told her the same thing. But she insisted that I was the only one who could help her." He waited till Ron asked, "And why is that?" to continue, "Because she claims the vase belonged to the Blacks and is a memento from the war."
"Harry, stop. I'm fine," Hermione said as they knelt down and picked up the parchment she'd dropped.
"It's good to see you, Molly," he said as he hugged the Weasley matriarch awkwardly around the boys.
either." She emphasised her words with finger quotes then sighed. "Well, it's a good thing that the German Ministry will be sending a lengthy apology letters of sorts to compensate for all the trouble they've caused, I'm sure, plus my report may convince the higher-ups to let you off the hook with some grumbling and vague threats."
Ginny waved her hand vaguely and said, "It'll be easier to travel that way, plus I'll get better access to the other teams."
Harry checked his watch again and sighed. He had been waiting for three-quarters of an hour already, and he was starting to get impatient. Although the call had been sudden, and he didn't exactly have the right to complain, considering the other party had agreed to meet with him on such short notice, he still couldn't help his annoyance.
"I can actually give you a list off the top of my head, but, if you prefer, maybe you, Ginny, and I could sit down sometime and look them over so we can discuss pros and cons and the like. What do you say?"
He stood before his unimpressed mother, trying his hardest to use the pout he had mastered at the age of four that had let him get everything his way. As it turned out, even The Pout had an expiration date—much to Draco's chagrin—and his mother's deadpan expression was the most it could now glean.
"Dad, can we wait here, please?" James whispered, looking at one of the goblins with a terrified expression.
Just then, Lestrange tripped and went sprawling across the ground, and for the first time since leaving Azkaban, a sound left his mouth—and it was the sound of a frightened, wounded animal. It made Harry's blood run cold, and he had to force himself to breathe deeply to keep from being ill. Neville didn't seem to be in any better a state than him, and one or two Aurors actually threw up to the side.
Harry's eyes widened, and his jaw dropped. He stared at Draco for a long moment before saying, "I can't see any on you either."
"I really appreciate it," Harry added quickly before Camilla could retort. "But Malfoy's right. I would like some time to look through this list and make my choice."
Draco glanced to his side, and his parents looked just as confused and stunned. Potter turned to direct his smile at them and offered a polite greeting that his parents accepted just as graciously—or at least his mother did; his father was frozen in shock.
She leaned forward and said in what was probably meant to be a mysterious voice, "This vase is said to have belonged to the Noble House of Black. It was handed down from generation to generation, and ended up in the home of Walburga and Orion Black, from whence it was wrongfully taken and then sold off as an inexpensive trinket in the black market. It was then retrieved by my late grandfather for a hefty price and has been displayed in our humble abode for decades—until it was stolen from right under my nose last week!"
I grimace, not wanting to have this discussion, but I decide that I may as well be honest since it's come to that. "Well, yeah, I suppose so. But it's also just…" I wave a hand vaguely. "The way you smell."
As they made their way through the darkness, Hermione's wand lighting the way, Draco noticed that she walked one step ahead of him, as she always did since the time they started working together three weeks prior. She had established a sense of distance between them that Draco wasn't comfortable closing. He spotted the light of the kitchen tent several metres ahead and sighed in relief, not realising how tense he had been until then.
Harry nodded and moved back in his seat, relaxing into the cool comfort of the leather. He breathed out a sigh of relief, caught himself, and hoped Malfoy hadn't heard or seen it. Even if he had, the blond didn't seem to care, and it left Harry feeling conflicted for some odd reason.
Harry caught his breath at the question. He wasn't sure what to say, but he decided that his best bet was to be honest. "I don't think so, no… I might not be the best dad, but I don't think I'm a bad one."
"Harry." Kingsley stopped his pacing to come back and sit in the chair. "You know that not everyone is very happy with you becoming Head Auror."
Draco leant back, wondering why he thought that. It took him a while to answer. "Because I can't see any other tattoo on you."
Alarmed, he pulled out his wand and was just about to cast a Disillusionment Charm when Camilla appeared around the corner. She made a startled sound, and he grabbed her and pulled her towards him, pressing a finger to his lips. She looked up at him and asked in a furious whisper, "What are
For some reason, Harry kept expecting Malfoy to be condescending and make fun of his moment of humiliation, but Malfoy was being perfectly nice about it. So nice, in fact, that Harry decided that he was being a little too harsh in his judgement of the man. He inhaled deeply and caught his breath for a moment before saying, "I actually came with the intention of seeing Camilla. I reckon I wasn't thinking when I arrived here at seven in the morning, in a tizzy."
They broke off their glaring contest as Ron stumbled into the room, his arms laden with bags upon bags.
She hugged Harry, and he held her for a moment longer, raising his brows and giving her a questioning look. Hermione glanced towards Ginny and the kids and then gave him a look that said, "I'll explain later." He nodded and let her go, stepping back as she hugged the kids quickly and bustled away, looking immensely relieved.
Her gaze fell on his arm, and she swallowed. "You were groaning and sighing, and I wondered what was wrong when I found that you'd nearly scratched the skin off your arm."
"Mummy, are we going home now?" Albus asked, coming to stand before Ginny and looking up at her wide-eyed.
Harry sighed deeply and ran a hand down his face. "Sorry 'bout that. D'you think you could keep them occupied until the evening? I'll see if I can finish up early and bring them home."
"Right, then." Harry held out his hand, and Malfoy shook it once. "Thanks for today. So, I'll see you…?"
"Listen," the man says as he grabs me by the elbow and steers me to the closest seat. "Let me pay to get those cleaned—they look new."
Harry's day off begins on a dreary note with sick kids, but it quickly takes a turn for the better when he meets the bright and cheerful Audrey. After a pleasant lunch, Harry decides to make a quick phone call to Ginny, only for it to end on a strained note, making him question the state of their relationship yet again. And finally, his meeting with Malfoy takes a surprising turn as they both come to learn new things about each other.
Malfoy didn't wait for Harry's reply as he leaned back and clapped his hands. There was a crack, and a House Elf appeared, big eyes staring at Malfoy with a beseeching expression. Harry was surprised to note that the elf looked tidy, as if it bathed and cleaned itself regularly, and it even had on a little uniform that matched what the staff wore.
As he followed her, he quickly glanced around the room. To the right of the fireplace was the main entrance, which comprised of two very heavy-looking ornate doors that had been propped open. To his left was the reception desk. As he stepped out into the hallway, he noticed that it didn't look at all like he'd expected.
"I know I'm not exactly at the peak of my career," Buxley continued, his voice growing more haggard as he spoke, "but I'm good at what I do, and despite what anybody else thinks or says, I'm not that easy to replace."
Harry paused again and shook his head. Staring at the glass tabletop before him, he tried to recollect the nightmares he'd had all those years ago, but all he could hear was a shrill ringing interspersed with blood-curdling screams and pleas for help. He closed his eyes and breathed, trying to calm his racing heart. Malfoy sat silently and waited for him to continue, not moving a muscle.
"Did she decide to talk?" Harry asked as his deputy flipped through the little notebook he always carried around.
"Harry," Draco whispered, his hold on Harry's hand tightening for a moment before letting go. "Do you trust me?"
Only staying long enough to watch him get to his feet, she hurried back the way she had come, hoping beyond hope that her son wasn’t badly injured.
I stare at him, unsure of how to respond to this piece of information that was unlike everything I imagined the man to be. Harry runs a hand through his hair and chuckles at my befuddled expression. "You're probably thinking I'm a half-wit, and you're not wrong. But…I don't know. I guess I just wanted to exhaust all avenues from my end so that even if it didn't work out, at least I wouldn't regret not having done enough. You know?"
Ginny groaned. "Yeah, I think it's high time we send them to school. My parents must be exhausted with all the things they've been handling recently. Did you hear about Mr Perriwinkle passing away? A real tragedy. Dad was so upset; they were such good friends."
They slowly dispersed, the only sound coming from Robards bellowing instructions, and the perpetrator—who turned out to be a Muggleborn Auror who had been recruited in the last minute—screamed that he had finally brought justice to the countless Muggles and Muggleborns who had died painful deaths at the hands of the Lestranges.
They climbed out of the cart and made their way to the vault. As they reached it, the goblin held out a hand and said, "Key, please."
Potter chuckled, a small, hollow sound, and Draco swallowed, feeling a lump form in his throat. This man, that had supposedly saved the wizarding world, exuded so much sadness and misery that it made Draco want to curl up and cry.
His original plan had been to go camping, but Ginny had instantly opposed the idea with a very valid argument—the kids would
He stared at the door for a long moment, setting his thoughts straight, before undoing the Muffling Charm. Scrunching his face up, he braced himself for the barrage to come but still winced when Lily's shrill screaming assaulted his sensitive ears.
"Hi, pumpkin!" Harry picked Lily up and twirled her around, laughing as his daughter squealed with delight.
Harry nodded slowly. "Well, I do remember certain snippets from different ones. I've figured out that they're generally related to things I'm stressed out about in that period of time."
"Well, all of us live in the castle, of course," James began, motioning to what was apparently the castle, with a flourish. "And Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione and Rosie and Hugo live here," he continued, pointing to a smaller mound. "And Gran'pa and Gram'ma live here," he pointed to a third mound, "and everyone else lives all over here," he finished, motioning to all the different-sized mounds.
Malfoy nodded but said nothing. Harry continued without looking up at the blond. "The thing is, Ginny and I have been rather stressed out about various things of late, which lead to us fighting and arguing a lot more than normal, and I realise that this may have been the reason why she didn't talk to me about a lot of things, because, well, I'm rather unreasonable when I'm angry, if I say so myself…" he trailed off and glanced up at Malfoy, who was listening intently, his gaze fixed on Harry. "She's been away for about a week and a half—she's covering the tournament this season—and her not being around when I needed her the most increased my stress by… a lot."
"As Auror Morrison here has informed you, I'll be personally overseeing this investigation, and I assure you that I will do everything in my power to find your son."
The man's eyebrows fly up into his hairline in an exaggerated manner. "Are you sure you're on the wrong bus?"
Draco recoiled, stepping back and flattening himself against the railing. Hati seemed to notice and winced.
Sirius smiled proudly for a moment before Lupin pinched his shoulder and cleared his throat. “You’re what a lot of people in Japan would refer to as a Kitsune, or fox spirit," Remus explained. "They're one of the few magical creatures that wizards will accept as better than themselves. Partly because there aren't many of them left. Especially in Britain,” Harry continued to inspect his body as Remus spoke, finding two small light brown growths on his head. He had a theory that they might be the start of a pair of antlers.
LeFay is losing his temper with the way Tatsuya wants to run things, and possible having a traitor within their ranks is only making the problem worse. (Especially when that traitor might just be the flirting with your mate.)
Harry woke in a panic, clutching at his chest as pain continued to echo through him; making him felt faint as his stomach threatened to turn sour.  His eyes took time to adjust to the darkness but he managed to spot a crack of light coming from a half-opened door. Hushed voices drifted in from the opening, and he stood to investigate. As he took a step forward he wobbled and crashed into the nightstand, causing a cup of water to fall to the floor with a dull thud. The hushed voices stopped and Harry could feel a cold sweat begin to set on. He tried to take another step only to fall again, barely catching himself this time just before his face hit the floor.
"That is a Hyaena hyaena," Luna said from the Ravenclaw table. Apparently, having heard Seamus' question.
“That doesn’t sound good,” Harry mumbled as he stared into the cave. As Harry approached, Draco the dragon twitched in his sleep. Only when the twitching stopped did he motion Charlie to follow.
“Everyone else, leave and prepare, this is our chance to move. I doubt Albus would have reasoned that we Cadmael would bend this fast. Not with how much pride he takes in his spells,” Harry growled. There was a cacophony of pops and cracks as people apparate out of the room, leaving only Severus, Draco, and Harry.
Harry closed his eyes, sniffing slightly as he thought back to it. “Um… Lavender, and something woodsy, and dark. Like dark chocolate almost,” he stated and then opened his eyes to see Theo still rummaging. Finally, he brought over what looked like a scarf. Harry didn’t think he had ever seen it before. “Were did you get that?”
“Nope, oh wait. Could you deliver a message to Luna and Neville? Oh! And, Theo and Hermione? Tell them I’ll be in my room for all of today and that I’ll see them after I finish,” he stated. Shibee nodded and with a pop was gone. Harry looked over his room and then went over to his flash fresh box. Opening it he pulled out a large rodent and set it into Ammit’s tank. Ammit struck it with his fangs and started eating it graciously, humming and coiling around his meal as he did. Harry sat down to eat his own food. He found it hard to concentrate, however, as he felt the kitsune moving around in his head.
"I don't know. I think it just depends on long you've known him," Hermione stated. Luna and Neville nodded, Theo shrugged. Harry stopped at the door to his room and spoke the password before pushing it open..
Draco’s hand laid on the collar. Angry first as he gripped it strongly before his hand relaxed and began tracing his fingers over the amethysts within. He let his gaze stray from LeFay, hopelessness enveloping him.
"Why would it be a problem sir?" Harry asked. "Yea, he is a bit harsh when you first stuck me with him, but over the day and last night. Well, he's helped me a lot already I think," he paused and reached down to pat Ghost's neck. The animal seemed surprised. "i think we'll be great partners."
"Don't," Ron snapped. He was still sore about what had happened with his sister, especially after what his sister had told him. Just then the rest of the boys started filling in, and Ghost (comically wide eyed) made a run for Harry's bed for safety. "Just leave it," Ron sighed finally and got up from his bed, heading for the bathroom.
Griphook grumbled but bowed back, “I expect to be your nephew’s account manager for a very long time.”
"Everyone!" August bellowed, glaring around the room as almost everyone shut up. It seemed to do the trick, only leaving Ashliegh and Douglas' conversation bare. They finished soon after noticing everyone was staring at them.
Someone had done the decency of tucking him into a long robe, but he could still see that from the middle of his thigh, and farther, his leg had turned into a delicate fox leg covered in silky vat black fur. Starting at his pointed fox head he traced down his neck till he felt where the fur stopped and his skin turned slowly from a dark grey to his normal fair skin.
"Yes...Even if that Harry wasn't really you, it wasn't that, that I was drawn to. Magic doesn't lie, and yours is...unique," Draco stated, trying to come up with the right words to use. LeFay seemed a bit lost for words as he just sat there staring at Draco. Then he started laughing. Draco frowned. "What is so funny?"
Draco placed a silk bookmark in between the pages he had been reading and stood. He decided to take it with him before heading down the hall. It didn't take him long and as he opened the door he heard LeFay speak.
“Narcissa, Draco. Please have a seat,” Remus stated as he filled two cups with tea. Narcissa smiled tensely and sat, motioning Draco to do the same. He sneered before sitting and crossing his leg over his lap, refusing to look at Remus and choosing to stare off into the shelves of books instead. Remus chuckled and handed Narcissa a cup before leaning on the large desk in the room. “I hope the packing wasn’t too stressful. I can understand how it feels to uplift all your roots and move somewhere entirely different,” he kept his tone neutral as he spoke, sipping his tea.
he stated, staring at Harry. There was another light huff, causing Harry to stand up from his bed and looked around frantically. Ammit watched him, starting to worry.
It had started snowing as he tracked it, making it almost impossible to maneuver through the trees and underbrush. He had to stop a few times to catch his breath, finally deciding to lean on a larger tree to rest. In the quiet stillness around him he started to hear something carried in by the wind. He turned his head, trying to pinpoint were it was coming from. It sounded like someone singing, and he decided to investigate.
Harry's gaze focused, as the realization of where he was started to come back. "Draco? Draco!" he crawled forward and straight into the arms of the blonde, tears spilling down his face.
"Did you say something Lord Malfoy?" LeFay asked as he turned his attention back to the blonde standing in front of him. Draco shook his head and went to sit in a chair across from LeFay.
Lord Malfoy, or rather Draco, has found himself at the headquarters of the new Dark Lord. For the past six years he has been looking for Harry-LeFay. Just what kind of person will he find in his, Harry's, stead. What is the real person behind the mask once called Harry. Who is LeFay?
Ammit nodded his head and then slid onto the bed from Harry’s shoulders, curling up in the warm side of the bed where Harry had been sleeping. ‘
Draco gritted his teeth, pulling his wand out to get ready, “I don’t know what happened between you too, but Harry and I have always had a connection. Even before he was able to make contact with his inheritance, we may have been enemies then but we were still connected, and I won’t let you ruin what we’ve built since then,” Draco growled. He could feel Jariss’s presence against the sides of his mind as the dragon coiled, and lifted his scales in a fighting position. Dragons wings lifted and fanned out around him, making him appear far larger then he currently was.
Harry looked at it in awe. The collar was a coppery brown with pink and blue detailing in the form of a Chinese Dragon. The outline of it being pink, and its scales being various light blues and darker purples. Regulus thought it was very pretty, but he doubted Draco would like it, that was until he looked down at Ghost and saw the hyena basically drooling while he looked up at the collar.
Severus snarled as he got to his feet and then looked disappointingly at his godson. "It was the only way to keep you from hurting yourself, and Harry. Do you even know why you want to get to him so badly?" Severus snapped.
"It's better to get it out of the way now. I wanted to speak with about your choice of animal for Harry Potter. It was rather...interesting," Albus stated, though he didn't look like he was talking about it because he was curious about it. If anything he looked disappointed, maybe a bit irritated.
Harry stooped before finishing, slammed his mouth shut painfully as he gripped the wall behind him and bit his lip; causing some blood to drip from it.
“I was almost at the Astronomy tower when I turned the corner and saw a group of students standing there, I decided to hide behind the wall so they didn’t see me and wait till they left,” Harry paused as he felt his heart rate pick up, and a building rage in his veins, “That was before I figured out what was happening.”
“Albus, raised m-,” Cadmael coughed and gagged for a moment, throwing his arms out to catch himself, “He raised me after my mother died.” Cadmael could feel the bile crawling up his throat as the memories that had been locked away filled his head. The torment, the abuse, the torture he’d suffered under that man tell he was thrown to the side. Till he’d been set up to find Skoll on day as he wandered the streets. Then living the rest of his life with Skoll, those memories were sweet. He couldn’t believe he went back to Albus after that, thinking he owed him. “We stayed in touch after I found Skoll, then when he asked me to follow someone I did it for him.”
Tom Riddle's gaze rotated to Lucius, causing the man to swallow. "Lily Evans, is related to my late father distantly. I was her uncle of sorts. However I am also technically a distant cousin of the Potters through the Gaunt family branch. I would like to leave my family title as Harrison's great Uncle however, as not to confuse the child further when he wakes," he explained.
Draco didn’t know what to do with the information. Should he be angry because LeFay had just left him without knowing for sure, or sad that LeFay didn't care if it didn’t recognize him and Harry as one in the same. Biting the bottom of his lip, Draco stared at the floor, fingers still tracing the collar.
Tom shook his head and lifted his hand. "Please leave Severus," he said quietly. Severus bowed his head and left.
Draco's head snapped from side to side, his nose twitching like mad as he fought to pick up that scent of jasmine and lavender that seemed to follow Harry everywhere. His hackles raised as all he could pick up was his family's stench mixed with his and Nagini's blood.
Draco put the letter down and sighed. Maybe she was right. It wasn’t the answer he had wanted when he had written her, but he definitely had a lot to make up for. Maybe this was a good opportunity?
“Draco? He’s conscious, doing rather well actually. The scars to his face aren’t healing as well as I thought they would, even with my salve it looks like they’ll be permanent. Small white scars, so it won’t be terrible. His mother will throw a fit, but it’s treatable.” Snape answered, arms crossed over his torso. He glared at LeFay, eyes narrowed.
Draco nodded, thanking him for the potions, and continued on his way. When he passed the wards he apparated to a town near the Forest of Rothiemurchus. He wanted to be as close as possible his starting point, along with gaining some insight from the locals in the area. Yet, to his surprise, he didn’t actually land in town, but right at the edge of the forest.
“Thank you Griphook,” Tom said with a small bow, “We all greatly appreciate the work you are doing, and you have earned our respect.”
“For hurting Draco. For not protecting him when I should have. For not trying harder to sever whatever it was between us. I didn’t want him brought into this anymore than you did, I-”
It wasn’t at all what he had expected. He was about the size of a pony, with three long tails that currently curled neatly up over his back. A small set of antlers sat on his head, but all around he just looked like a normal yet over sized fox. It definitely wasn't as scary looking as Tatsuya, that was for sure. His mouth and teeth even looked normal when he opened them to look at them. Everything seemed okay, that was until he got to his eyes. The Avada Kedavra eyes seemed sad, and sparkling emerald tears spilled from his eyes, down the sides of his cheeks. He hadn't even noticed that he was crying. That's when he felt arms wrap around his neck and a face buried itself into his fur.
“Well, it seems that Gringotts has fallen a bit behind since the war and are trying to sort everything out. Narcissa also sent a letter but we haven’t gotten to that one yet,” Remus stated.
LeFay groaned, now he had to actually think about this. What he really wanted, those rushes of emotions and instincts he tried to ignore, that made him disgusted with himself every time he felt them. This was it, his first lesson to unlearning everything that had been drilled into him by Albus and the weasels. He inhaled, finding that thread that he could feel between him and Draco, not just the one that they’d formed, but the one each creature tied to magic had. Grabbing hold of it he let his magic stroke it, watching it flare to life before opening his eyes again.
When Harry stepped out of the floo, Sirius was there waiting and caught him when Harry stumbled forward. At first he didn’t recognize his son, only doing so when he remembered what Harry had been wearing. Harry smiled at him and gave him a thumbs-up, making Sirius laugh. “Well come on,” he stated and patted Harry’s back. They started to walk while Sirius pulled a list out of his pocket and looked over it. “Remus sure was thorough. I’d forget my head if it wasn’t attached.”
“Velvet black midnight, little time till day…Crescent Moon Maiden, warm colors in lighter shades.” Harry’s eyes widened. He remembering the poem! It that was in Draco’s book!
“As for the custody of one Harrison James Potter, until he came of age, listed here are seven people. Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy, Alice and Frank Longbottom, along with his godfathers; Sirius Black, Severus Snape, and Regulus Black,” Ulkalb looked down sternly at the group, and then fixed an angry glare on Albus. “As per Lily Potter’s wish he is in
He yelled at himself. Stop being such a brat! You already admitted that he wasn't attractive. Draco continued bounding, stopping and looking back over his shoulder to make sure Harry was keeping up, though he knew very well Harry Potter knew the way to the great hall. That doesn't mean you can't admire him though, he pointed out to his subconscious.
Tatsuya and LeFay shared a mental stare before they spoke, “It’s Draco Malfoy. He showed up this morning before the sun even had a chance to rise... He still had the collar,” they explained, looking guiltily at Hisashi.
Charlie was running toward them now along with Bill and Severus. “Potter, watch out!” Severus yelled as the dragon’s tail came up behind him and almost squashed him. Harry barely dodged out of the way, his springy legs carrying him quickly to the side. Glancing between the three men as they stopped near Draco, Harry couldn’t understand what was going on. Draco lifted one long clawed foot to his face, looking like he was trying to remove something from it. Charlie was withdrawing a syringe of some kind and Harry felt the sudden urge to attack the group as they ran toward Draco, trying to help.
LeFay looked down at his papers and shook his head. "I can't worry about him right now. We have a lot of work to do," he stated.
Twenty minutes had passed before Harry was Harry again. He sat in the middle of the floor with a blanket covering him and a warm cup of tea between his hands. His eyes stared hollowly into the cup as Luna and Hermione exchanged concerned glances. Both had been instructed to stay on the other side of the room while Neville and Theo took care of Harry for the time being. Harry shivered a bit before taking a sip from the cup.
The whole hall's attention was now on the creature that trailed behind Snape. It was about the size of a large dog, Harry noted, with, what looked like, porcupine quills along its back. It had a slopped back which effected its gait but what made it even stranger was the color of its coat. Almost pure white with creamy pinkish stripes down it's body!
Draco comes to terms with the fact he must swear loyalty to Harry Potter, and strangely he doesn't feel as discussed as he originally did by it. After making said vow it's off to Hogwarts to start the next adventure, only this adventure may hold a lot more in store for them then they had bargained for.
“Nah, I’m good Theo. You two go do what you were going to do. I swear I’ll be careful,” Harry stated. Hermione looked skeptical but nodded.
“I most definitely have not, forgotten,” he mumbled as he finished up the letter and sealed it. “Winky! Dinky!” he called.
He turned when he heard a soft crack behind him, stumbling backwards when he saw a forest looming there. He looked up at the trees, awed at how tall they were. He swore he’d never seen anything like them. Not even in pictures of the rain forests Hermione had shown him while researching different climates around the world. He tried to look into the forest, but it was dense and too dark to see anything form the outside.
The others looked from one person to the other before Harry took a step forward and lifted the clothes pile. "Herm?" he asked quietly. There was a quiet mew before a small cat was looking up at him. It took him a moment to recognize it before he broke out into a big smile. "You're a munchkin!" Harry laughed loudly. Theo leapt off the bed and picked up a sulking Hermione from the floor.
Harry’s eyes went wide, putting the pieces together now. He raised up his hands in front of him like it would protect him from the Malfoy’s wrath.
Tatsuya said within LeFay's mind. He was amused and LeFay could see the shadowy form of his self smirk beside him.
"The care of?" Harry rolled his hands, trying to get Severus to finish. Was the old bat having a fit?
However, LeFay was more focused on the subconscious movement made by Draco. The fact Draco's hand went to the collar and pressed against it surprised LeFay. Was it resentment, or nostalgia?
Hermione froze a little bit, and Theo looked at her slightly puzzled. She blushed a deep red, "Well um yes...but I'd rather."
Harry crawled into bed and then put out the light, turning on his side to try and get comfortable. He couldn’t help but stare at Draco’s side of the bed. He had gotten so close, yet had so little time. His ears folded back as he lifted a hand to place it on Draco’s side of the bed, guilt washing over him.
“Maybe that’s why it doesn’t have an author, or even a title for that matter." He sat back in the love seat and stared into the fire for a while before he turned his attention back to Potter.
After this, they would go shopping, both to make a statement and hopefully to let Harry relax after the will reading. Tom already knew it would be a mess and the boy would need something to ground him after. Draco actually came up with the idea of shopping. He’d seen the boys filthy rags of clothes and knew Harry had very few items to call his own. Or any items that even allowed him to keep his items private. His trunk had no locks to speak off, and was mostly magicless. To his embarrassment, he also suggested they go to the pet shop, as he had a suspicion that Harry would love finding something to give his familiar. With all that planned out, they left soon after breakfast with Draco taking the spot as Harry’s familiar, Ghost.
Bill rolled his eyes and then sat on the ground before taking out a book from his pocket and reading over some curses. Sirius and Remus started arguing in hushed whispers, leaving Harry to his own devices. He started wandering the perimeter of the clearing, looking over the ground curiously. He sniffed the air and then froze, his jaw tightening. It smelled like blood. There was a scream from the trees ahead of them just as a burst of wild life came crashing out of the bushes. Harry jumped back, turning to leap out of the way of a deer.
“Harry!” Bill shouted and started running to him. Harry sat up and quickly put a thumb’s up in the air when he heard the dragon starting to growl at Bill. He stopped in his tracks and bowed a bit, backing away from Harry without turning his back on the dragon. Draco seemed to relax, his head dropping back down to the ground. Harry got up and dusted himself off, kicking the spears aside, and when he looked back at Draco's dragon head, the eerie eyes closed. He walked the length of the dragon up to his shoulder, one hand always placed on the dragon’s side as he walked. The scales seemed to shiver underneath Harry's hand and large violet eyes opened again when he stopped at the dragon’s neck.
'I want to know the real you' Harry snorted. Cocky kid. No, they weren't kids anymore, and that was part of the problem.
Harry watched her leave and then sighed and sat down, playing with his nails as he waited. He hadn’t been able to get what she said earlier out of his head. It had been bothering him the whole time they were talking as she was measuring and showing him the different fabrics; their idle chatter not being enough either. One of the few werewolves that could get a job?
“He was still sleeping when I woke up, so a good twelve hours so far. Roughly," he paused, "He has been twitching a bit as well so I think he might not be completely out. That or he already has an infection and fever.”
Severus sat up startled at the sudden burst from Draco's mind. Draco jumped from his cot, blood splattering the ground.
“Actually, I’m not paired up with anyone. The Headmistress can’t find any one capable enough that and won’t fight me all the time,” Theo answered, waving his hand dramatically.
"I take that as you forgiving me?" LeFay chuckled. Draco snorted, pushing against him. He laughed a bit harder smiled, "Let's head back then. Get some tea and warm up?"
“Okay, I’ll try it!” Harry yelled over his shoulder. He felt the change move over smoothly this time, within himself as well. It made it easier to shift as he felt Tatsuya’s muscles bunch and the way his fur, and tails, brushed the ground. Opening his eyes again he felt his head drop slightly from the weight on his head. Quickly reminding himself that he had a good set of antlers hanging behind his head. Blinking Avada Kedavra eyes he looked up to see violet eyes staring back at him. Right in front, of his face. Harry skittered backwards only to run his rump into the dragon's tail behind him.
Draco flinched as the last pieces of the mirror hit the floor. Apparently, LeFay really hated people seeing his Kistune counterpart. Draco noted. Or maybe it was just him seeing it that made LeFay react so?
“He called me his golden boy when he apologized just now, only Albus calls me that. Hati, Cadmael, never called me that,” LeFay shouted over his shoulder as he made his way through the great hall’s doors.
Draco looked up, looking around. "No! That isn't what he wishes, Harry come back to us! Please! If you stay here any longer," the voice cracked. "Please, you can't just promise me forever and then die on me."
Harry looked around the store, browsing through the shelves and different cages. The store was rather loud, with barking canines and meowing cats along with the sounds from various other animals. He looked back at the door only to spot Sirius talking to a man at the counter and shrugged his shoulders. Apparently, he wasn’t getting any help from him.
Snape stopped and turned sharply, stepping up to Harry and almost knocking him over. "Potter," his voice softened slightly, "these are private lessons. The potions lab is no place for what we are about to do, and if you happened to misfire a spell in a room full of expensive potion ingredients." He stopped and straightened himself. "Well, you get where I'm going with this. I do hope you are at least intelligent enough to catch on."
“I was about to visit Draco to give him his next dosage of potions. It would seem your ex-lover has some interesting spells up his sleeve that did a number on my godson.”
Severus wiped his thumb across Harry's forehead, then Draco's as he started to speak. Within moments the room was filled with a soft green and blue, the lights going out as Severus voice grew furious. The last thing Harry saw and felt where the light, the lights burned his flesh and he could hear himself screaming.
The doors to the main hall banged open as Draco emerged, head held high as he made his way into the dueling area. Horns, wings and talons fully bared and adorned in the ritualistic garb appropriate to the contentment. On the other side stood Cadmael, a massive muscle and fur covered jaguar warrior werebeast in every way. Draco was taken by surprise, he’d honestly never known that such a non human existed but, now remembering the tails of jaguar godly warriors being worshiped in South America way back when made sense. Honestly if he’d just been a muggle he’d probably thought the man standing before him was some kind of warrior god too.
Harry grunted and sat up, causing Draco to curse when he hit the bed with a thud he wasn't expecting. Harry got to his feet, summoning a robe to pull on. "And us," he muttered, just loud enough for Draco to hear.
it hissed. Bill started helping Remus to his feet, taking the distraction as a good chance to regroup.
He was frozen, wide eyed, as he stood in front of the other being. Terror and that feeling of being very small overwhelming him. Everything told to run.
Severus put down the rags on the table, nodding at the other healers as they headed out of the room. "Thank you so much for your help today," he said softly. They nodded as they passed, some handing him a few gifts for Harry when he woke.
"Hurry, the poison is spreading through his body as we speak. Go to the cabinet in my room, take out the phoenix tears, as well as a a vial with 'ANtox' written on the side," Severus breathed as he took the bowl from Harry and started setting everything up. As he looked over Draco's body his face started to pale. As he combed through the fur the amount of bites his godson had taken dawned on him. "FASTER POTTER!" Severus bellowed.
Cadmael laughed, “Just a kid! That’s really your excuse for everything isn’t it? What about after Voldemort was destroyed? Why didn’t you patch it up with him then, and after he vouched for you so you weren’t thrown in right with your dad? What about the six years after? You have no idea what he’s gone through you selfish twirp! All the twisting he went through by Albus’ hand, everything his muggle shit relatives did to him, when Sirius almost died, shit when the whole castle’s inhabitants almost died! Where were you?! That's right you were on the opposite side fighting him every step. And even after that you didn't even come by to apologize until you were forced to move in under the same roof as him. Even then when you started to think there was something you forced yourself apart from him, when he needed you most you left him. He had to push himself farther than he already had to save your ass and did he ever get a thank you? No!” Cadmael bellowed.
“Hurry grab a blanket so he doesn’t catch a cold,” Severus spoke as he rushed forward and covered his godson with his jacket. Harry got up quickly and headed back to their fire pit for a blanket. He was so happy he could shout. Draco was Draco again!
“Lord LeFay has gotten very handsome, hasn’t he,” Narcissa said as she looked back at the door to the drawing room and then at her son.
“Well… Honestly?” she licked her lips as she stood in front of him and tapped her foot. “The more feminine dress robes will look great on you, even with your legs. The real problem is for normal clothes and student robes… but maybe…” She started murmuring to herself as she closed her eyes, and fidgeted with the tape measure. She started to scribble some stuff down onto the pad she was carrying in her back pocket and tapped the pen to her lips. “Yes, yes! That might work!” Kristian spoke excitedly as she headed towards the door. “I’ll be right back.”
“Thank you Hisashi. We seem to be getting the hang of it now,” the two said as one. Switching their weight from one leg to the other the raven coated Kitsune sat.
Sitting up sharply he grabbed the newspaper from the side of the desk and skimmed it till he came upon the updates for the new year.
August nodded with a sigh, “I believe Lord Prince took him to his quarters for treatment, something about making sure there wouldn’t be any blood infection or permanent damage to Lord Malfoy’s face,” he answered. LeFay nodded and turned to leave just as August spoke again, “I won’t pretend to understand your relationships but, what do you want me to tell the others in your council?”
"I know we are all tired, but we need everyone as one unit if we want to change our world for the better. Now, I'd like to continue," LeFay paused, looking around to make sure he had everyone's attention, "Good, now about tightening security-"
It was a good question, Harry wasn’t even sure. Why had he told Draco who did it? For sympathy maybe? No. Yet he honestly didn’t know why he had told Draco, or at least he didn’t think he did.
Harry shook his head as he stood and grabbed his books for class. First was Transfiguration, then Charms and Potions. He had an hour break in-between Potions and Ancient Runes which he decided he could use for animagas practice. Next was Herbology, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and the new Dark Arts class. He had another hour break for lunch before his Care of Magical Creatures class and then Astronomy. He thought about either going to the library for lunch and doing homework there, or in his room so he wasn’t disturbed. He didn’t think the people working at the library would be okay with him eating in there anyways.
With that problem solved they had gone to Regulus with Harry’s wish, and he had out right told them it was too soon. Though he wanted to see his nephew happy, he didn’t think it was safe. Even with Severus’ potion. If Albus suddenly lost two of his closest assets to Harry, and felt had no control, he would speed up whatever nasty plot he had for the boy. Then they wouldn’t have the time they needed to put that man behind bars where he belonged. Tom had to agree, and with that it was settled. Regulus would be the one to take Harry in to the will reading. A letter had already gone to Albus to inform him of the will reading, both from the goblins and Severus. Severus’ was of course questioned, but by law, there was nothing to keep family, like Regulus, from pulling Harry out of school for private lessons or family matters like this. Albus had to, by law, ‘let’ Regulus take the boy.
Severus cleared his throat from the side lines, holding his wan to his side. “Please get into position. Just for everyone, there has been a formal contest laid down against the mating and claiming of one Lord LeFay. The rules are as stands; as it includes the lows of magical creatures both wand magic and any magic or abilities coinciding with said participants bloodlines are allowed. The duel will end when the opponent is either incapable of fighting any longer, or the contesting party withdraws their contest. While killing your opponent is frowned upon it will not be restricted by the rules currently in place,” Severus announced. LeFay could tell Severus was worried.
“We will now begin the reading of James and Lily Evans Potter's wills.” The goblin cleared his throat as he spoke and pulled out a large case which he then opened and set before him as he began reading.
"Potter. You are over five minutes late, I demand to know what has taken you so long," Snape grumbled.
“Oh, so we are back to this Malfoy?” Harry’s voice seemed hallow as he spoke, and a frown formed on his face. Draco hesitated for a moment, as the emerald stare settled onto his own. It was haunting, almost like looking into a cat’s stare for too long only to realize they were looking through you. Draco shook his head and looked away, his eyes unfocused as he thought back onto what they’d shared the last few days.
Draco fired spell after spell behind him, even placing down a few tripping jinxs. Anything to quickly slow the mob behind him. He stopped for a moment, looking around for a way out of the woods. That’s when he heard it, the low humming of someone singing again.
“They haven’t done what I’ve done. They still feel something when they take a life, they take no pleasure in it!”
“Very well. Mister-Pot. Excuse me, Lord LeFay. First is the matter of your familiar, I understand that the two of you have formed a completed familiar bond. Hogwarts rules state that any animals deemed dangerous or unpredictable are not allowed on campus, however the fact that you two have a completed familiar bond, unlike most students that bring their ‘pets’ with them, Hogwarts rules cannot interfere. Thus, allowing you to keep Ammit with you,” McGonagall explained.
Harry had collapsed from exhaustion shortly after pulling himself from the depths of his dying mind, scaring everyone again, but this time Narcissa had assured everyone that it was in the clear. It was just taking time for his body and mind to recover. All the while Draco had never left his side, even when Severus half begged for him to at least come eat something. It ended up with Sev just bringing the food on a tray for the two of them. Though, Harry's food had to be spelled into his stomach while he slept.
They stopped in the snow as LeFay concentrated on looking inwards, towards his inherited half. Tatsuya was sitting in the very back of his mind, darkness enveloping him, but LeFay could tell Tatsuya had heard him.
Hisashi looked up at the large dragon, a smirk forming across his lips before he bounded over to his place at the top of the hill. A toothy smile formed across his face as he looked over the two creatures in front of him. “Now, LeFay, your first lesson. Make him submit,” Hisashi commanded.
Draco smiled a nervously and shuddered as a wave of raw magic crashed against him. When he opened them again he was startled by the look in LeFay’s eyes.
"Almost. Draco, you have to realize there was only so much we could do, and I don't want you to be angry with him."
"No, nothing more. Goodnight Severus," Albus smiled at him. Severus bowed slightly and then turned, his cloak snapping behind him as he left. Albus' eyes darkened as he placed his hands together in front of himself, elbows on his desk. It seemed Severus had done a little too well with his choose of familiar for the Golden Boy. Hopefully this would not hurt his plans to much.
Severus scoffed, “It’s my job my Lord. Now, I must get ready. I don’t plan on letting you leave me behind at the manor.” With that he turned and started out of the grand hall, the large doors closing behind him with a low thud.
Shaking his head in slight disbelieve, he finally turned from the mirror and started to rummage through his clothes. Settling with a black muggle turtle neck and tight dark green jeans. Harry flashed back to when he'd first bought the muggle clothing and his surprise to both of Remus' and Sirius' complements about on how nice he looked. He'd honestly expected them to be a little put off by the muggle style choice, but they'd both started to even adopt it into their own wardrobes. Harry had kept his dragon hide boots however, preferring them heavily over muggle footwear. He headed downstairs once he was done, tucked his wand into the holster Sirius had gotten him for Christmas last year as an after thought. Remus was already waiting and checking his watch in displeasure. It was just like Sirius to take his sweet time.
Harry started climbing up the sleeping dragon and headed to the back of the neck while the others got into position. “Okay, I’m unshrinking it,” Harry stated as he hung his legs over Draco the dragon’s neck. The collar expanded and clattered to the ground, the metal glittering in the sun light. Working to lift the heavy collar into place Harry was just able to clasp it together in the back. He watched in astonishment as it melded together before glowing brightly. He could feel it pulsate under his hand before a wave of magic hit him and he fell off Draco's neck. It took him a moment to realize why till he sat up. There laying in the grass surrounded by his Professor and friends was an unconscious naked Draco.
Harry stood, turning away from Draco and taking a breath in. "Come one, we need to get you out of here."
“Well. Honestly, I think this will both be fun and very dangerous. Especially for you, I mean I understand you defeated Voldemort, but compared to him a dragon is-.”
"Ghost saved our lives. Once we got back to the study to start your lesson Nigini attacked me. Ghost was really hurt protecting us both and you passed out. It would seem that in the panic you managed to bond yourself very tightly to your familiar. He's recouping in another room under the care of," he stopped. The Malfoys were suppose to be dead, who was he going to say was treating Ghost?
Harry sat on the bed facing the door, watching Draco pacing. It had been a week since classes had officially started, and everything had gone well until today. Well that and when Draco got over sleeping in the same bed. Harry snickered at the thought.
Draco wished he could talk to Harry, tell him it wasn't his fault. The person really responsible was one that Draco had run from; Voldemort. Draco glanced at his left foreleg. Even in his animagus form the mark remained imprinted into his skin. Thankfully with his stripes the Dark Mark just looked like a more curved strip then the rest that covered his body.
“You don’t think he could have smelled a singular scent that set him off instead?" Theo asked, "If what I’m thinking is correct that could have been why he went into attack mode. Over stimulation, I feel like, would ahve sent him into more of a flight response,” Theo explained as he went over to Harry’s and Draco’s desk, scrambling through papers.
Draco nodded and watched as LeFay straightened and left. He still couldn’t believe it all. Harry was alive. Not the Harry he knew, LeFay was alive, but then again. If what LeFay said about the collar was right, did that mean there could be was some part of the Harry he knew left? Still, those emerald eyes haunted him; ones that matched that terrifying monster.
Regulus huffed, “As I’ll ever be,” he said as he leaned on the cane he was temporarily using. Regulus made their way into the other room and stopped at the round table to take their seats. Severus made his way in moments after and sat on the other side of the table. With that, the goblin in charge cleared his throat. “Before we start, I will read off the names of the participating members; any deceased will go to their next living relative or person listed in their own wills. Now; Lord and Lady Longbottom, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Lord and Lady Malfoy, Severus Snape, and Harrison James Potter,” he paused and looked around the room, “As of this day, the current witnesses to this reading will be Neville Longbottom and his Aunt acting as his guardian on the Lord and Lady’s behalf, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Severus Snape, who will also be acting as the proxy for Lord and Lady Malfoy, Harrison James Potter and Regulus Black acting as his current guardian, and Albus Dumbledore.”
The growling vampire's face grew closer and Draco could just make out the fangs in a thin strip of moonlight. Draco tried to speak, but his voice wouldn’t come out. The vampire laughed and continued to do so until Draco managed to mumbled expulso under his breath. The vampire went flying backward into the group behind him. Draco recovered his breath and turned, yelling the spell again at the wall behind him. It exploded out onto the snow and Draco took his chance to escape. He heard angry roars from the vampires behind him as he ran.
Draco felt like his heart was about to burst. He felt unbearable pain as he was both unimaginably angry, and distraught. Harry had sacrificed his soul to safe him, bound himself to Draco in ways no mortal could even understand without first passing through Lady Magic's heart and living to tell the tale. He felt tears streaming down his cheeks as his front limbs finally gave out and he lay there in a heap.
As they continued down the hall Draco started to form an idea. Stopping suddenly, he then barked to get Harry's attention. Harry turned, brows lifted.
“How is he doing?” Snape asked as he sat down by the fire, Bill following. Harry looked up and frowned, shaking his head sadly.
Draco stepped forward slowly, watching Harry’s every move, along with the large snake behind him on the bed. He sat down at the coffee table Harry used as a desk then pulled out the paper he had his chosen classes on. Harry seemed to be watching him more than the list of classes, causing Draco to fidget.
LeFay sat in the throne-like chair that was pulled out from him to watch from the balcony overlooking the main yard. Normally it would be where everyone trained but everyone else was busy clearing the space for the duel between Cadmael and Draco.
Harry on the other hand was about to blow. He could take care of himself! Yet, seeing the look on Remus’ face, he knew there would be no arguing. He may be an adult but in the Black Manor, what’s said is what goes. Harry nodded his head in acknowledgment and then continued to eat his waffles.
"Where else would I be?" he asked, eyes opening. He stared into the black sky as two large eyes looked back down at him. The eyes blinked at him and he heard faintly someone calling his name.
LeFay finally let his walls down as Ammit wrapped himself around LeFay’s shoulders, hissing comforting words. LeFay stroked his head, marveling at how big his familiar had gotten. Thinking about him reminded LeFay of just how much time had passed.
“Nothing… I was just curious, about what I saw at the ceremony. I mean, you had horns. Like a goat or something. One of those Hebridean goats, or are they sheep?” Harry scratched behind one of his ears and crossed his legs.
"I know what I said. I was lying. I've always known we were mates," he said with a sigh, "Harry might not have known in the beginning, but when I fully awoke, I knew it instantly." He fiddled with his thumbs, unsure of how Draco would react.
"Um, could you perhaps turn around and keep watch," Harry murmured. His eyes where on the ground and his face slightly flushed like he was embarrassed about something. Draco finally realized why and felt himself starting to blush to, if animals could blush, and then he swiftly turned around and took up his post. He cleared his throat with a huff, his porcupine like mane standing up as his tailed slid over the floor slowly. "Thanks," Harry stated. Draco heard the water starting to run behind him and tried to focus on other things rather than how much he had under estimated Harry's looks. Even with the scars littering his body from front to back he still looked attractive. He wondered how Harry had gotten so many in such a short span of life.
Draco sighed, shifting his position as his breathing leveled out. "What do you remember?" Severus asked. "Don't try to speak, my mind is open and your magic is to unstable to produce a voice from your current form. Just use pictures like a taught you." Draco nodded and sniffed, his eyes closing as he drew up the last thing he remembered. He had been laying down at Harry's feet, anxious about Harry knowing the truth. He remembered feeling scared that Harry might not comply with there plan, that he might try to kill Draco again if given the chance. "Focus," Severus voice said softly. Draco's ears flicked in frustration as he thought harder. He remembered the hissing, scales rubbing across hardwood, blood. Blood everywhere, red water, arms...HARRY!
Snape sighed and nodded. He understood what Harry was going through right now. He'd turned his head, ready to leave, when he spotted Draco, "Draco? What are you doing here?"
LeFay felt an ache in his chest as he thought about it more. He didn’t want to just use Draco, that would be unfair.
Harry whirled around, trying to face where the voice was coming from. He looked over at Ammit who just stared back at him.
,” LeFay repeated, his voice dripped with power as a wave of both pleasure and fear coated Draco’s body. Before he could even think Draco laid down, a soft thud when his head finally hit the ground, nose just at the edge of LeFay’s paws. Harry couldn’t help the wave of satisfaction he felt, but the disgust soon followed, and he turned his head so he didn’t have to look-.
After Harry finished undressing he turned to face the striped hyena, surprised to find the creature staring at him. Ghost's eyes seemed be focusing on one of his scars intently, one that ran up the length of his left inner forearm. Seeing the animal eyeing him like that made him nervous. "I know you're an animal but could you stop staring, it's weird," Harry stated. Ghost blinked at him as if hearing him for the first time before the animal stepped towards him and put his nose against Harry's scar on his arm. Harry's skin flinched at the contract with the cold nose. "It's from Voldemort, when he used my blood to resurrect himself," Harry explained, his voice barely above a whisper. Ghost flinched at the use of the name and Harry noticed but didn't comment on it. There was a moment of silence as Harry shifted his weight from foot to fit, watching as Ghost seemed to be inspecting him, taking note of all the injuries Harry had endured.
Tom had planned on fulfilling Harry’s wish by adding Sirius and Remus to the fold, but Regulus and the attack had challenged that. It took awhile for Harry to accept, but Regulus made a good point. They didn’t know if they could trust the mutts yet. They could be under the same compulsion the rest of the Hogwarts staff were under. It was a miracle that Severus was even able to slip the treatment to McGonagall. They’d spent all of the second half of yesterday doing so, and it had taken seeing Harry and his medical history to convince her. Meaning she had to be brought to the manor under guard.
“A baby dragon!” Bill hooted. Harry groaned, leaning his head back onto his shoulders and blowing out a puff of air.
Harry decided to great him, drawing Draco’s attention. “What are you reading?” he asked as he sat down on the couch opposite from Draco.
“Harry, do you think you could remove the other spears?” Charlie questioned as he stepped up beside him and Bill. Harry shrugged, his eyes watching Draco the dragon as he finished drinking and laid down in a sunny patch of grass.
“Just don’t move,” Charlie stated. Harry nodded, he could do that, as him and Draco continued their staring contest.
Sirius was the first to speak. “Looks like they all took to you, and that LeFay one,” he let out a long whistle as he looked at the rings. “Looks like the magic embedded in the rings righted your creature inheritance. It was a good thing we did it then," he stopped to crack his fingers, "Well then, Lord Potter, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, LeFay. What else should we do today?” Sirius joked. Harry grinned and chuckled.
“Luna, Neville. You two are looking great,” Harry said excitedly, “And Neville, smokes! You really filled in!”
“Wishing you could interact with the physical world again I see. Which book is it this time?” he asked.
“Move!” Harry snarled, frustrated that the dragon had stopped him. Draco clearly wasn’t pleased by the outburst as he snorted again and lifted his head higher to stare down at Harry incredulously. Harry glared up at him and then turned, walking around the tail this time. However the tail moved, blocking his path again. Harry threw his hands up then, turning on his heel. He was about to scold the dragon some more before he heard Charlie yell his name.
