But how was he to leave the Manor without help and return to his friends? He had no wand to apparate away, and several House Elves had the order to keep him within the wards. And dammit, He knew just how powerful they could be. It hadn't been so long ago that Harry had seen them in battle after all.
Of course he didn't accept all cases he was offered. For one, it would arouse suspicion if a not inconsiderable part of the defendants in the Death Eater trials would suddenly be released without any real punishment. And for another: even the Malfoy vaults were not infinite and Draco knew that one day the means he had to play this game would end. But for now, he was determined to push his luck.
are." Blaise corrected, feeling much the same, except that it had been his anger clouding his judgement and if he thought closely now about how carelessly Harry was always risking his life … he simply couldn't be allowed to keep going like that. Even though Blaise knew that he had approached the subject positively maladroitly, it certainly would need further attention. The thought that Harry might end up dead or hurt because of his own thoughtlessness had his stomach in knots. It was unacceptable.
Harry eyed them warily, his heart beating fast but steady in his chest. It seemed that they weren't underestimating him as much as he had hoped they would or expected them to from Eleuterio's haughty, self-absorbed behaviour earlier.
"Yesss." Malfoy hissed through clenched teeth, eyes narrow and cold.
"If they refuse to let him go, if we have to fight them…"
Why the hell had Draco stepped away? He had thought all three of them were enjoying themselves, basking in the closeness, intensity and intimacy after the initial discomfort at the unexpected sensations (and at the identity of the participants) had faded. He himself certainly had…
Because for once the boy was silent and still before him; for once Severus had to face him without the rebellious, defiant eyes challenging him, mocking him, distracting him and giving him all the excuses he needed to bask in his hate and disgust. Perhaps for the first time ever in their entire thorny history, Severus was incapable of ignoring all the glaring counterevidence of everything that he had wanted to believe in for years.
"If Harry ends up mated though, before we get to him, don't kill his mate."
”But we only follow those inactive lines into the 7th generation. If the trait has not come forth until then, the line is declared extinct. I think one of the last families whose blood was weakened enough for that was the Potter line. Three generations ago we finally declared the line lost.” A small smile played over Lucius’ thin lips. It never failed to amuse him that the one to kill the Dark Lord – one of the most powerful wizards of his time – was someone whose family had grown so weak that it had lost the ability to reap the fruits of their pure blood.
His fury flaring again, Lucius took a few quick steps towards the mirror until he stood directly before them, his eyes blazing. "You have a duty to your family! For once in your life, fulfil it!"
where he is –" the portrait drawled, "if you get that House Elf."
James and Sirius and every one of those dim-witted morons that had favoured their little ragtag group of bullies and braggarts over those that were genuinely talented and eager to learn and evolve; All of them had conditioned Severus to feel this way, to hate them and desire nothing more than to retaliate and to prove how much inferior they truly were.
Smugly, Draco raised an eyebrow at their young Vykélari as if to say
"I … you know, it's alright, really …" Harry started hesitantly, if a little bit strained, "just, if maybe I could stay here until the school term starts, that'd be great…"
No, he couldn't trust anyone within this blasted house. He needed to leave, find his way back to England and his friends and sort this out, even with his somewhat dubious control over his magic. If anyone would be able to deal with that it were the two persons who had stood at his side during the war. Malfoy and Zabini in contrast had proven that they didn't know how to handle the situation: all they had done so far was making his magic lash out, who said it wouldn't happen again? Who guaranteed him that they would be able to help him regain control over it?
Lucius had always persuaded his father Abraxas to let Severus brew his potions in one of the Manor's dungeons and take the picture of Cygnus with him. He didn't know what his friend had told the old Malfoy; probably that it would be highly beneficial to have a potions master close to the family and devoted to them. Severus really didn't care.
And well, since he didn't have to fight this dominant for their submissive and said submissive was neither here nor willing to help him release all the pent-up tension, he'd need another way.
"Oh. Yeah, of course." Harry muttered bitterly, thinking back to the hardwearing cotton T-shirt and  the sweater he had worn that full-moon night, then quietly pulled off the light blue shirt, which Harry thought, was a lot thinner than what he had been wearing then and might have ripped more easily, not bruising his growing wings. It explained much and not for the first time, Harry found himself envious of the two Slytherins for having known, for having been prepared. He could have been spared so much pain and confusion, not to say panic.
It rushed into Blaise's body before he had the chance to close himself off, streaming into his hands, along the muscles of his arms and into his chest, flooding his lungs until he felt he couldn't breathe, piercing his heart until it ached, making his stomach lurch and his legs cramp and he was jerked off Harry's body as if he had been caught by a tornado that had carried him for a few twirls only to spit him out again, throwing him away.
Ives nodded calmly, as if he had expected that answer. "Then I will offer you a deal. You will give my descendant and his fiancé the benefit of the doubt and an honest chance to court you. And you, in turn, will allow them to teach you about the ways of Vykélari with an open mind. In exchange, I will tell you how to leave them for good on the 31st of August this year, one day before the new school term starts. I hear Hogwarts will be reopened by then and allow for all those who weren't able to continue their education during the war to return for an eight year. In Hogwarts you will be a lot safer than anywhere else aside from a dominant Vykélari's home."
They all nodded, only nodded. Hermione didn't think the others really felt like talking, God knew, she didn't.
Harry’s magic whipped forth with sharp anger, just a tiny, invisible tendril of pure power extending from all that flowing blackness, but Taide could feel it nonetheless as its force rippled the very air and natural magical currents around it, and it made his skin crawl. With precision and furious determination it attacked, flashing brightly for a short moment right above Valerio’s far too slowly moving form, a thin curve of light like the gleaming of a knife, like lightning in the nocturnal air. Then it vanished from sight again and Taide felt as if the short moment of sudden silence and the absence of any clue to its whereabouts or doings was more frightful than anything it could have done.
He was livid. How dare they? How dare they even think for a moment that he would let them cage him? Who did they think they were, setting rules like that and thinking he would obey them like a good little first year Hufflepuff?
Only the miniscule narrowing of the deep, blue eyes hinted at the astonishment the elder Malfoy undoubtedly felt at those news. Strangely enough, that lifted Draco's spirits somewhat again and he managed to edge the dark shadow of his father aside for now.
Moments thereafter Blaise saw out of the corner of his immobilized eyes, how the heavily blurred silhouettes of his servants surrounded him protectively, could sense the soft vibrations of their own innate magic pulsing around him and yet he couldn't feel relieved, desperation swelling in his throat accompanied by the taste of bile, so thickly he could barely swallow past it. What was happening to Harry? To Draco?
He stumbled over the last few words, realizing what he was saying only a fraction of a second too late. Flushing bright red, Harry cursed inwardly… he really hadn’t meant to say that out loud and he lamented the fact that he never really had such problems before becoming entangled with this insane Vykélari mess (though to be honest, Harry really couldn’t tell if he shouldn’t just attribute his missing brain-to-mouth-filter on the influence of the Slytherins; they seemed to do that to him sometimes).
"I don't…" Harry started to protest, taken aback a little bit that the Italian's face was just so cold and freaking emotionless while obviously, he was everything but. It reminded him of how he had lain on the ground, tied up and honestly nervous as hell while the dark skinned dominant had loomed over him, telling him off for trying to escape via the floo connection. It made him uncomfortably aware of the three or four inches that Blaise had on him and of how he could control him by just showing off his magic surging over the surface of his wings. He felt threatened and it caused the magical control to snap.
Blaise followed suite, coming to stand some metres away from their Gryffindor and he could also see Draco landing so that Harry was between them.
Harry had no time to be surprised before the red beam of light hit him and his vision went black as he crumbled into the harmless emerald flames.
"… As soon as you mated my son. "
He had tried calling for Adler's little servant first, but without success, which lead him to the obvious conclusion that the Elf either was immersed in the Pensieve and thus unable to hear him or he wasn't in the room at all. Draco just hoped he hadn't taken the precious bowl with him that continuously filled itself with whatever Harry saw and heard. He had no time to search everywhere for Adler's foolish Elf, and he needed to see those memories urgently, even if the thought filled him with cold dread. Harry had been so full of fear, so desperate and he couldn't imagine what might have pushed him into such a state when he had been so composed and brave while flying through fiendfyre, while duelling with the Dark Lord in person, taunting him on the same battlefield that had demanded so many lives, so many fellow students…
Whatever consequences awaited him now, it was the only logical explanation for them to charge into his rooms and be so upset with him - at least Harry couldn't remember doing anything else that would warrant their ire since the evening before.
"Do it, now!"
Harry raised his chin defiantly but did not lower his guard any; in his humble opinion, he had every right to any bout of undue paranoia he felt like having, especially after their shared enmity during their schooldays and the war combined with their molestation of his person during the past night.
The very notion was ridiculous: In contrast to all the muggleborns and halfbloods and bloodtraitors they had had nothing to gain from Harry's victory – not until the Dark Lord had shown the true extend of his madness. It had only promised a loss of the values they held dear and their influence in the wizarding world.
"He is at Malfoy Manor But Draco's parent's and my mother can't learn of it! It is imperative for Harry's safety. I need you to also contact Pansy and some of Harry's allies: McGonnagall has the connections and power to get portkeys to Italy for a few of them." After all, the woman knew the minister and while Blaise was aware that both had been Harry's allies, he could imagine that the headmistress was by far easier to convince. She might even be the only one who might be able and willing to get them help in time, now that the public and probably the ministry had been utterly turned against them and everyone sharing their last names; she was known to be fair and practically a war hero herself. Everybody who had stood behind Dumbledore, stood behind McGonagall as well.
I gave an extensive explanation for their behaviour in the review replies for the last chapter. If after reading that you still think that you never ever could forgive them their deeds even if they had a total change of heart and you still want to see them dead, I advice you to discontinue reading, you won't ever grow to like Night Flight.
And with Draco standing so close to him and all of them so close to the edge of the chariot, nobody could expect him to actually think rationally. It should be enough that Harry managed to take a second to realise that it wasn’t his magic that made his stomach feel as if he was already falling. But there was no compulsion fogging his mind, no tingling of magical sparkles travelling along his nerve fibres to sear him.
Of course that would neither hold Narcissa and Amalyne back, nor detain them significantly as they were keyed into the wards.
And yet…
He raised his hand to slap him, more because he felt like it than out of the belief it might cause a miraculous revival, and surely it couldn't make it any worse. But then Severus stopped dead. Within the blink of an eye the syrupy nectar smeared all over Potter's skin had lost its lustrous gleam, as if something had sucked the colour out of it, leaving a thick, richly yellow fluid that was not unlike mango juice in place of the liquefied gold that it had been.
But driven by her guilt and the wish to rectify her mistake, Giallina had asked to be allowed to keep at least one eye on their guest whenever her duties allowed it, especially during those times when the Gryffindor was alone. She had therefore been the obvious choice when Blaise had to decide on a House Elf to give to Ives. It relieved her from her usual duties and gave her more time to see to Harry's safety, a task she took very seriously, more so than maybe any other Elf in his employ. Besides, she was of a very gentle nature and he thought both Harry and Ives would be comfortable with her.
Perhaps half an hour and the softest orange glow would bleed into the blue, giving rise to a transformation like the birth of an entirely new world: oppressive and hostile shadows would turn into harmless wood and bark, the sounds of nameless enemies moving in the darkness revealing themselves to be nothing more than wind and animals prowling through the scrub and boughs. Blades of grass and millions of leaves and wild flowers would shed the dull greyness clinging to them like tar and burst into colours and the soft smells of moss and wood and leaves and earths would thicken in the soon warming air.
No wands, no possibility of leaving the manor without being dragged right into the Italian wizarding prison by the guardia, no allies…
Draco Malfoy supposed that he was the obvious choice to go to. It was a wide-spread yet unproven supposition that the Malfoys had kept investing in not quite legal undertakings even before the war and so his willingness to stray from the law if it was profitable enough was practically a given; yet although he had been a known Death Eater, Draco had been acquitted of his crimes – and that early enough to be able to assist other accused. His trial had been one of the first and with Harry Potter himself speaking out for him, who could have sentenced him? The Gryffindor was the one paragon of goodness that people still trusted, after all. No, Draco was cleared and free of suspicion.
"The stability of Harry's magic and life will depend on the continued existence of whoever it is." The blonde elaborated, once again looking to that very spot where the guardia and Blaise's uncle had emerged from the darkness, where they had waited to spring their trap.
"Mr. and Mrs. Weasley!" The elder of the two healers exclaimed angrily, stressing every word he spoke. "We are in a hospital! Please keep your family from disturbing the peace and quiet of our patients or I will have to insist you leave."
"That isn't any of your business!" Harry growled with a pointed glare and grabbed a slice of ciabatta out of the silver, filigree breadbasket.
"Sirs Ives and Adler Malfoy told her to alert the master. Giallina swears!"
, not your family. He will care for
Uncertain, Harry gazed at Draco, who smiled at him, but though it seemed honest and light, Harry was aware that the blond was nowhere near as calm and collected as he pretended to be.
And that's what they made him feel: vulnerable. He didn't like it. And yet, their caresses, probably imbued with magic, soothed the last echoes of his headache and made him feel … well, it was just such an intimate gesture that seemed almost affectionate?
“As a matter of fact, I contacted you because of your position as representative of the Vykélari community in Britain…”
Or perhaps the Aurors had managed to uncover their – especially his father's – underhanded tactics in the Malfoy trials?
"But they will allow us to ride in their chariots if their riders give their permission, of course. And they will bring us to our first destination today."
"Regardless of what you believe, regardless of what you think is true, I swore a Tiwaz oath to Ron Weasley, only this very morning, that I would do right by Harry. And I will."
Severus caught them with a flurry of nimble wand gestures, directing the lot of them to crowd over the boy's outstretched body. Another flick and they turned upside down and Severus grabbed the next best bottle and tore out the stopper. Gurgling, the viscous liquid poured from the bottle and splashed against the boy's pale sternum. Thick golden drops sprayed over his chest, rivulets ran over his side to drench his torn clothing and the bed sheets, or flowing down to his stomach and even into the wound, washing away and mixing with the harsh red smears of blood.
But. They were stubborn and they were smart, inventive and resourceful. Most important of all though: they were persistent. Forced into a corner, they never gave up even if the odds were against them. When given a task so difficult and dangerous that no one sane could expect him to survive it, had Draco not still found a way to succeed? Had he ever allowed his failures to discourage him in his attempts to trump his childhood enemies, especially Harry Potter?
The nearest of these patios was on the first terrace: a table with a complex tessellation of blues and greens was being set up by House Elves with bowls of fruit, carafes of some golden liquid and three place settings.
Only once he was sure that he could defend himself and his charge, did he let his attention focus solely on Potter, levitating him carefully onto the soft mattress where he came to lie in an odd position like a statue displaced from its original spot, still frozen from the stasis spell as he was.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Enough was enough. After all, he had been through that night he certainly didn’t need to take their taunting. God, if he could only talk back!
One and a half hours earlier Harry was led away from Blaise's and Draco's paralyzed bodies and it was one of the hardest things he had ever had to do in his entire life, which was saying something. Every step felt weighted down as if he was wading through a swamp, every little movement only pulling him deeper into the thickening bog that grew ever more reluctant to let him go, weighing his legs down.
and as such a part of the decoration of a room that needs to harmonise with the furniture, stylistically, thematically
Harry eyed the blonde a little bit warily. "Thanks, Malfoy."
So Harry had accepted that they were not boasting, trying to impress him or buy him over with all the little luxuries offered to him so freely; rather they seemed to enjoy pulling him along in their not quite voluntary holiday, choosing to ignore a world beyond the dreamlike landscape of the Italian coast where a civil war in their homeland had just culminated in a bloody battle lead by Harry himself, where the corpses of friends and schoolmates rotted under grave compost that was dark and fresh and had not yet had the time to be overgrown with plants like a wound in the earth itself waiting to just scar and stop hurting; choosing to ignore a world where Blaise and Draco's parents were trying to force them into cruelly predefined roles and the wizarding community was a powder keg just waiting for a spark to ignite it and blow up right in their faces.
Blaise chuckled lowly against his flesh and started to pinch Draco's other nipple, toying with it while still sucking, licking and kissing the one beneath his lips. Jolts of searing pleasure burned their way down through Draco's body directly to his groin, which was quickly becoming the centre of his circulation and gods, the feeling was wonderful and maddening and oh, so not enough!
But Harry barely took notice of how the flaring flames filled every edge of the room with warm and gentle light as he absentmindedly leaned back against the door. Knowing that behind not even two inches of wood and maybe a few feet of air Draco and Blaise still stood in mutual silence was distractive enough. At least he hadn't heard their retreating steps, even though some distant part of him remembered that privacy charms suffused the wood and the stone walls, to prevent even Vykélari hearing from being disturbed by any noise.
If Harry's mood was suspiciously improved in comparison to the day before or if he seemed a little bit excited and nervous at the same time, when Blaise and Draco met him this morning, they didn't notice it, too busy to assess his lithe frame and his somewhat short stature. How much of that came from the mistreatment he had endured and how much was natural? Were his eyes so bad because he had been forced to spend much of his time in a small, ill-lit cupboard from such a tender age on?
“You tried, Narcissa.” He reminded her. “We all did.”
… Maybe that old Sorting Hat was wiser than students usually gave it credit for, Harry could still remember the first song he had heard, treasuring the memory:
Blaise frowned. That meant that the blackmailers had to have taken Harry's friends only a few short hours before contacting the submissive…
"More or less." Blaise answered, the corners of his lips curling upwards, thrilled by the sizzling tension in the air around them, not yet willing to interrupt and destroy whatever game they were playing by confessing what Harry had done behind their backs; not when Draco was so beautiful in front of him in that cold, steely, sharp way of his, moving steadily forwards like a white-furred nundu on a hunt; not when Blaise himself still felt an echo of Harry's lips, of his hands against his chest and his trousers were still uncomfortably tight.
His gaze flitted over the ruins as his mind razed, as if the solution was hidden somewhere in the debris – perhaps something to distract them…
No, no one had the right to demand of Harry to just forget and forgive all that had happened between their families, least of all Draco and Lucius, not even to ignore the past. The noble Gryffindor that he was had already helped his mother and him during their trials and given him back his wand; he had spared Draco's life by returning for him and right into the fiendfyre even with all their black history.
The parlour, if it could be called that any longer, had been emptied out completely and was bare now aside from a single, thick, massive wooden pillar that stood in the centre, showing an artfully stylized tree that dominated the otherwise not very large room. It was round except for a metre high, cubic part in the middle, of which each side was occupied by one painting, each showing a different room that probably had been part of some baroque Italian villa: facing the door was a huge, two-storey library, where an elaborate fresco occupied the entirety of the domed ceiling overlooking the curved balconies of the first floor and the richly ornamented worktables on the ground floor. Sunlight flooded the hall through tall windows situated in between the many shelves, bathing it in a surreal golden hue. Next to that painting, Draco knew, he would see a study and a trophy hall. The latter was in his opinion a rather indelicate hotchpotch of magical creatures that bordered on the grotesque. One of Blaise's ancestors had been a professional hunter and his eternally preserved victims, including a Harpy, an Echidna (a man-eating half-snake) and a Teumessian fox littered the room without any conceivable order. The fox at least, Draco was sure, had been a protected species even then; wizards had even spelled the few remaining individuals so that no muggle hunter could catch them.
deluded…" the blonde sighed dramatically and then there was a small pause before Harry heard Draco take a calming breath and continue somewhat calmer and more politely but still a little bit uppish. "Ives, it might have escaped your notice, but you are a
Huffing out a sigh, Draco leaned closer to the surface of the swirling liquid, careful to stay far enough away to not be sucked right into the memories. It was so much darker than a regular Pensieve, Draco thought, frowning in deep concentration as he brought his fingertips to meet the silver: his thumb for will and logic, his index finger for ambition and his ring finger for his subconscious that might guide his magic if only he let it.
Damn it! He needed to see Draco, needed to know both him and Harry safe and well and…
Amalyne stepped closer, grasping Narcissa's shoulder and letting her strong hands run over her upper arms. Her eyes glistened like the scales of a black mamba. "Secure him for our boys, Narcissa. That way you can help Draco, Blaise and Lucius."
Draco smiled back, enjoying himself in that weird way. "I think it looked more like a game."
Harry would probably have made more of an effort to be polite, if Ives hadn't been looking at the other man with barely contained fury simmering under his skin and in his lively blue eyes. It was unsettling and confusing and Harry would have liked to ask what this was all about but didn’t wanted to meddle into the clearly private affairs of a married couple.
Almost, Blaise would have stepped back and retracted his wings, appalled at the vision his own magic painted in front of his mind's eye, but he didn't want Harry to leave and he was sure he would if he retracted his wings. Harry would wake and would be angry and once again he would run before Blaise could explain.
Swallowing nervously and frustrated with an audible click in his dry throat, Blaise turned to look towards his fiancé who was pushing himself up on his hands and knees with obvious difficulties.
"Harder!" the blonde demanded and Blaise forcefully pushed into him, his pace brutal, exactly how Draco wanted it. The two lovers locked gazes, feverish, piercing, burning, and Blaise could feel the walls around his flesh tightening erratically and not even half a dozen thrusts later, Draco came with a hoarse outcry, his seed splashing against the tanned, smooth skin of Blaise's stomach.
"Feel free to elaborate whenever you are ready." Adler said with an elegant hand-wave and the hint of a smile when Draco had fallen silent for some moments, pondering over how to address the morning's happenings.
Without hesitation, Draco thrust the two digits in, up to his knuckles, groaning as he felt the inner walls clutch at him tightly, his own erection throbbing with the desire to have that vice-like grip
This intruder obviously hadn’t noticed the silent alarm. Or, Severus corrected himself drily as he looked up to the stairs above him, they simply hadn’t cared.
"Okay."
Quickly he closed the door while behind him the shadows swathing the living area flickered and died reluctantly as, one by one, candles burst to life magically upon his entrance, making the beiges and sand colours of the elegant furnishings and the artfully marbleized walls glow.
mate…' supplied a part of his mind that Harry really didn't care to listen to right now.
"We'll see, Severus, we'll see. For now we have to help Draco and Blaise
And in a way, he did: Harry might choose his friends over his Slytherin suitors now but that didn't necessarily mean that he cherished them more, only that their lives were at stake and not Draco's and Blaise's and Draco had to hold onto that belief.
"Another aunt of his, the sister of his uncle, she had a dog and the whole family watched it chase Potter through their backyard until he managed to climb a tree. It was the aunt he accidentally blew up in the summer after his second year, I don't know if you heard of the incident. After what I saw in his memories, I don't even want to know what she did to finally make him retaliate."
The man whipped his arms up to protect himself but not quickly enough. Dirt and small stones and grass hit him directly in the face and he spluttered, throwing his head to the side and clenching his eyes shut, even as his hands moved to rub them clean again, leaving him helpless and unable to react.
So really, reconciling herself to the demise of the Dark Lord wasn't that hard at all.
Next to him, Zabini leaned forwards a bit, propping both of his elbows onto the armrests of his chair and folding his hands. "Harry is in a rather difficult situation right now but he is starting to accept his inheritance, even find enjoyment in it."
No. No, not that!
Hermione moved her chair closer to the mirror. "Stockholm Syndrome is not about love, Harry." Then she said with a glance towards her boyfriend "Muggle scientists found out that one out of four hostages develop generally positive feelings, empathy and sympathy towards their kidnappers, because they mistake a lack of abuse as an act of kindness while feeling left alone by everyone else, especially when the kidnapping stretches over many days."
And michlori, I'm sorry I took so long to update, especially since I told you I'd most likely update so much sooner. But I have had some serious family problems since right before Christmas which really killed my time and my muses and I just didn't manage to complete the chapter even though it was almost finished.
Inquisitively Blaise turned his dark gaze towards his lover, cocking his head at the splitter of ice he saw there, freezing those grey irises over.
'...The Boy-Who-Lived in the hands of a former Death Eater…'
His magic swirled in his belly, slowly and indefinite as mist, hesitating to take form like a wisp of cloud, as if waiting for a cue on how to act.
"Harry? Are you alright?" Ives voice was tight with concern and something else, something akin to anger, though Harry couldn't by any stretch of imagination understand why the redhead would feel that way when nothing substantial had happened that could warrant that reaction.
Narcissa frowned deeply and pursed her lips. She hadn't thought of the boy at all. Of course if Potter had somehow been injured or at danger, they couldn't have all evacuated…
They had mocked him then with their presence, because he had not wanted them to be there. Now he
"And I am" Harry answered, biting his lips. "Doesn't mean that I'll be trusting you blindly. Just that I won't outright refuse your proposals and … and advances." He said, his cheeks flushing faintly while he stubbornly encountered their assessing gazes.
"I'm fine, honestly. We've had a somewhat rough start, but ... I'm fine now." He hesitated for a moment, but the question needed to be asked. "How is Ginny?"
Harry's hand slowed. But what if it was just like that? Neither Blaise nor Draco had ever shown any interest in him before... Ginny had had a crush on The Boy Who Lived since like forever, before she had even known him, and Cho... Cho had had a strong affinity for celebrities.
The news had come as quite a shocking surprise to Britain’s wizarding society. After all it had been merely a week prior that Draco Malfoy and his mother had been acquitted from their charges. Even more surprising for their closer friends and relatives was that it had been Blaise who had proposed to his long-time friend and lover. Equally as beautiful as his mother, the only Zabini scion was just as reserved as she was – at least around most people – and it had been the general opinion that if one of them would dare to take that next step, it would be Draco and not Blaise.
Now, with the prospect of having the younger Vykélari as a mate, a real mate, and with Severus's words still haunting him, he couldn't do it. There was no logical explanation, nothing that would have sounded reasonable to him anyway and yet ... he just couldn't.
Warily he looked down to the pale sparks vanishing into his skin, unable to keep himself from wondering whether they were somehow moulding his emotions again. He didn't think so, but still... Harry just didn't know if he wanted to come into close contact with that magic again.
"We need wands, Blaise. Call whomever you trust and use whatever you need. You know the contents of my vault. Use it all if necessary."
they had
"And Harry does, too. Now come, Dragon, we lingered long enough. I'll have breakfast sent up to you, Harry."
“… you see, this evening we had an emergency. A young man. Showed signs of magical exhaustion; his senses had shut down… vision, hearing, smell, tactile sense; taste might have, too, we're not sure yet. Tested for curses, but negative. That lasted for about ha–”
What could have happened for only one of them to evacuate? Who could have found the boys, found out they were even in Italy? Who could have entered Lanai manor and how and why? Was it due to Potter and his inheritance or some self-proclaimed revenger infuriated that Draco had so recently been acquitted?
“What are they supposed to do?” Narcissa asked scornfully, cocking her head. “With a submissive,” she nodded towards the boy, one palm hovering over his chest as if to claim him for her family already, “we will be too powerful to attack. And they know it. They will not even dare to try.”
Even the suggestion of abandoning the palace would have equalled blasphemy.
Frowning stubbornly, wondering why it hadn't worked, Harry once again imagined the enormous, emerald and bottle-green and spring-green appendages that would erupt from his body, tearing his skin. His shoulders tensed.
Insistently he tugged at the hands holding his ankles apart and they released him, gripping his hips tightly instead, leaving Draco free to wrap them around his lover's chest.
Crouching low to the ground in the vague hope of appearing non-threatening, Draco fanned his wings out and did what his instincts told him to: he pushed his magic to the surface of his body, letting it swirl over his feathers, suffusing it with the soothing, calming touch that they had already used on Harry in the hospital on the night of his 222nd full moon.
"Sounds complicated."
"I would speak with him."
Harry glared venomously. This wouldn't be the first time that his penchant for sparing his opponents would come back to bite him, and Harry had to give this devil his due, he had done his homework. But what Valerio and many of his enemies failed to understand was that the Battle of Hogwarts had changed him, had made him realise that there were situations where a swift kill could save lives. All those deaths of children that might have been prevented if he – or others – had fought with more determination, had used more offensive than defensive spells… no, Harry had learned from his mistakes and though he would do everything to keep Taide alive, he would do even more to save Ron and Hermione. Add to that the fact that his friends had been tortured in front of his eyes, and Harry wasn't quite so sure whether mercy was still an option.
From the outside, the isolated building had more similarities with an oversized menhir than a tower, the smoothed stone surface unbroken by any cracks, windows or doors, nothing that would leave purchase for even the sturdiest of plants to grow.
"Jerk!"
What if they were too late? What if these birds were nothing more than the requiem for a broken existence, ghosts of a nightmare holding silent vigil at Harry’s tomb?
"Harry," Draco impatiently raised an eye-brow, "you really don't want to transform like that, do you? You would tear the shirt and the pressure on the growing wings is rather painful, or so I'm told. We'll show you tomorrow how to cut two slits into the fabric word- and wandlessly and close them afterwards but I think we should use less … expensive clothing for that."
Somehow, this seemed to be the wrong thing to say. His sharp ears easily caught the quiet, angry murmurs the Italian Aurors probably thought to be inaudible for him, curses and muttered insults, and with a spark of unease Blaise noticed that they were actually on the verge of attacking him. Honest contempt and revulsion pulsed towards him in waves and more than one of the men took an angry step forward, knuckles white around the sturdy woods in their hands.
"Leering at him as if you wanted to devour him whole… did you want to?" Blaise cocked his head as he asked the question, wondering if his fiancé would be honest or if he would try to evade, make excuses. For some moments of silence it seemed that he would.
Instead Blaise was sucked along the magical tunnel with no means to influence the journey, his muscles tensing under the strain and his hands clenching around spindly, greyish fingers, holding on, because there was nothing else to do.
Would that she could reach for her friend's hand, or at least share a few comforting words… but they were both alone in this nightmare. And in truth Narcissa would not have known how to approach the other. Weakness was not something that was acceptable in their world.
Why should he not raise the suspicion of the officials? No, why not go a step further: he could rip himself loose from the tight hold Eleuterio had on him, rush back and reveal the whole atrocious plot to people who could actually interfere in the one moment that was out of his blackmailers' control… Would it not be foolish of those conceited bastards to kill Hermione and Ron when a dozen Aurors would know where to search for the culprits? It might even force those men to obliviate his friends and let them go as inconspicuously as possible to try and hush it all up, getting rid of all evidence so that they could pretend that no one had ever been kidnapped in the first place…
Harry should know better than to let it affect him! Especially since this wasn't the first time that he found himself unarmed within enemy territory and he knew, he
Generale Carraci tilted his head, thoughtfully. "You mean to tell us that signore Potter is responsible for this? The destruction of Lanai Manor, the deaths... even Malfoy and Zabini's transformation, the 'darkness' in them?"
"Nothing… It's just, you know, it was … really painful…" he shrugged, dropping his gaze along with his voice.
And aside from the dangers and the fact that Harry didn't know where to even get a broom, his hosts had wings and probably knew how to use them - in contrast to him. It would not be difficult for them to follow him, even if Harry should destroy all other brooms in the manor. Or maybe it would be difficult? How fast were Vykélari?
Draco waved the comment away with a sniff and a sharp head movement. "I was thirteen. And I learned my lesson."
"Fine. Then give Granger our regards and... we will come and get Harry in about two hours."
The moment Harry started to move, Draco agilely propelled himself forward and out of the window as if he had waited for the other to give him a start signal and perhaps he had, perhaps he had wished and hoped against hope that the brunet might wait and stay long enough for him and Blaise to figure out how to solve this latest problem. But there was no time to contemplate the little sting of disappointment in his chest now at seeing Harry turn away with steely determination.
Harry wakes sometime at noon in a bed room in Lanai Manor with wings, claws, enhanced sight, feathers in his hair and green and ultraviolet markings on his body.
Mordred, how was he to tell his fiancé?
Harry honestly didn’t believe one moment that that was what was happening to him. He had felt magical exhaustion before and god, this felt as if he was casting a very powerful curse that bled his magic dry… he tried to convey his doubts, shaking his head.
Potter's legs and his arms were fixated to the bed with sturdy, thick leather straps. Where he had fought against them the hardest – at his ankles and his wrists – they had chafed the skin to an angry red, making Draco's blood boil in rage: Vykélari had very sensitive tactile senses that Potter must have already regained at this point of the transformation; the high sensibility meaning a high density of nerves in the region and that meant that superficial injuries hurt like hell. A healer should know that, and they seemed untreated as of yet!
Blaise barely had the time to prepare himself for a rough landing before the whirling colours deflagrated and gave way to an inky blackness. Momentarily blinded Blaise fell, his flailing limps breaking through small twigs, rough bark and rushing leaves. One of his hands managed to get hold of something that burst under the pressure into sticky wetness, before he impacted harshly with the dirt covered ground. He rolled uncontrolledly over sharp stones and hard roots that bore painfully into his flesh, scraped at his skin and robbed him of the breath to even cry out.
"Fine." Harry finally spat. "But it won't happen if you hurt my friends any further."
That was when he noticed that the Slytherins had both turned and regarded him with almost identical smirks and Harry flushed. God, when had Zabini and Malfoy started to be able to make Harry lose himself in his thoughts? The war should have taught him better,
Malfoy clicked his tongue once again, making Harry wonder how many times he could make the git do that during a certain time span. "It's been over 200 years since the last Potter fledged. Your ancestors were not powerful enough."
But Harry only nodded in the periphery of his field of view and he walked away, the gravel crunching beneath his feet deafeningly in the silence of the night and every step felt like a kick to Blaise's guts.
At the same time the skin around his eyes paled, and it was that same sparkling ultraviolet, a colour that he had never seen on himself but had discovered on several plants in the gardens and even in some of the portraits and paintings of the manor. It emphasized his eyes and made them glow now: gems of leaf green  surrounded by an almost white. Fascinated he reached up to touch the appearing mask, wondering what the skin now felt like, only to have Blaise gently grasp his wrist, shaking his head mildly.
It made him want to scream and weep and rave and deny it all. His magic was seething, wriggling within his stomach like a ball of hissing, agitated snakes that wanted to strike!
Perhaps, Severus thought darkly as he reflected on how blissful his ignorance had truly been, Dumbledore had had a point preaching about the use of scars. Sometimes they were important mementos, and not always for the ones bearing them. Perhaps…
Harry felt his throat tighten and his hands spasm helplessly at his side, whether to ball into fists, or twitch with the desire to throttle or snap something, or to wring in agitation, Harry was not sure.
2. Again, don't worry: Draco and Blaise are not going to be abusive or downright cruel. Doesn't mean they'll be all forthcoming and nice.
The realisation hit him with the force and suddenness of a bludger.
Draco and Blaise both frowned at the former head of Slytherin house with irritation and, more importantly, confusion: when had they stopped taking pleasure in the derogatory things their former professor never failed to say about the Gryffindor Golden Boy?
to present that submissive to the media come morning, healthy and unmated, or he'd be torn to shreds too small to even feed to the chimera guarding the secret government archives eight storeys below...
They had dived a few metres down to a rock formation at the ground of the sea that was overgrown with colourful corals and sponges and it was as if everywhere Harry looked he saw something moving: sea snails in the oddest shapes, jelly fishes that Blaise made him avoid, and a wide variety of other fishes that Harry had never seen before.
He licked his suddenly dry lips. "Would it help you if you could speak with someone who has … been through something similar?"
At least this dominant Vykélari might be rational enough to make negotiations possible. Cold enough to consider the consequences of his actions even over the crude, raw threats Harry was about to make.
Though he had refrained from punishing her (more because of Harry's wishes than anything else) or maybe because of his leniency, the little Elf had thrown herself into the task of watching over Harry with an almost obsessive fervour, and had planned to continue even after Blaise had officially told his servants that there was no need for any more observations and that, for as long as Harry wasn't in danger, he wasn't to be denied anything. Only if his safety was at risk, his staff had the permission to force Harry away from the threat.
But if he fell, Draco had no doubt that he might never ascend again; his transgressions were too severe and too many. The worst was that his father was not even aware of just how close he was to the abyss; and now that he had thought of a solution, he would not even consider another one, much less listen to his son and fiancé as they proposed a plan that might still not be enough to save him from prison. He would try to force Harry into their arms or make Draco and Blaise do it for him.
It sat enthroned there like a royal demon holding court, exuding darkness and malicious power. Or rather, a caricature of such a being: a failed attempt at crossbreeding of a human with a dragon, a horrifically distorted amalgamation of two forms that shouldn't mix.
The gears in Draco’s head began to totter, causing the smooth flow of the usually so orderly, meticulous machinery of his mind to slowly disintegrate.
"I am sorry we kept you waiting." Draco gave him a smile that was all angles and sharpness and with an uncomfortable twinge Harry noticed that the serenity that had fought its way through the polished surface of their demeanour as resilient and unrelenting as dandelion breaking through stone, had given way to the frosty, slightly aggressive, sharp-edged determination that Harry knew all too well from their years of fighting.
They were framed on Granger's side by the Weasel and on the other side by those nasty, prank-loving twins, all of which had been gazing into empty space with an expression Draco couldn't quite pinpoint but they looked up as the two newcomers entered, and that weird look faded into a mixture of disgust and hate – Draco had never been really sure which of the two emotions might outweigh the other in regards to him, but he guessed it didn't really matter anyway, even less so right now. How ironic that he and Blaise were here to safe Britain's savior, the one and only this group of emotional children were always fussing over so much and all the read-heads did was…
From Severus' look Draco could tell that he thought the question to be foolish, and that he had expected better of his favourite student, but Draco didn't back down.
A sudden gust hit Harry hard as he was standing not far behind Blaise, and he had to narrow his eyes as it mercilessly whipped into his face. The dark Italian meanwhile had indeed jumped up into the air that caught him with open arms, it seemed, cradling the lean body in its currents, carrying him steadily upwards and still the wind was beating around him. Only its effect on Harry and Draco, still standing on the roof garden, diminished gradually as Blaise was borne farther and farther away from them.
Neither was the fact that her reputation had suffered somewhat due to her well-considered suggestion that it might be better, in a purely utilitarian sense, to throw the Wonder-Boy out to the wolves when the castle had been besieged. It had been the logical thing to do and really she couldn't understand why it had made everyone so angry. And damn it, it wasn't as if Draco hadn't tried to give the boy over, Gregory had told her that, the only difference was that she had done it in front of the whole student body and who-knows-who-else in the Great Hall. It hadn't been a very Slytherin thing to do, she had to admit that and so she bore the consequences now with the grace and humility befitting someone of her station.
Immediately Harry opened his eyes wide in shock to look at the closed lids of Blaise's and when he found his hands curiously pressed against firm pectorals, stroking and kneading... well, doing things he really shouldn't have been doing, Harry used the position to shove the Slytherin off of him with all his might, hard enough to make him stumble backwards against the far wall of the corridor.
But the one method that made this game so enjoyable and exciting was catching the ring fastened to a 10 metres long rope hanging from each chariot, which earned the team 20 points. Once an opposing team had snatched away the ring, it was magically replaced by another up to ten times. If a team lost all its rings, it had automatically lost the game.
"Amalyne is right, you know, Lucius," she breathed against his ear softly. "Blaise and Draco are Slytherins: too ambitious to ignore the power right in front of them. It will seduce them and make them want to possess and control it. And they will take it in due time. But your son is
"I like my glasses." Harry shrugged uncomfortably. And really, he had enough for now of the freakishness of his inheritance. Even his blurred sight was somewhat of a relief, a bit of normality and familiarity where his world had seemed too instable otherwise.
through the Department of Mysteries, trying to kill them? That he didn’t keep him and other light wizards and muggleborns captive at Malfoy Manor and tortured them or tried to get Draco to identify him so that Lucius could hand Potter over to the Dark Lord? That he didn’t actively and financially support the Dark Lord? Narcissa! Even if you managed to get that boy to lie for you, which I seriously doubt, there are enough people who witnessed Lucius do all of that and more and who would know Potter was lying.”
An ominous sense of foreboding overcame him, drenching him like cold rain. Immediately Draco raised his magic around him in defence, raised his wand and spread his wings, fully intending to cocoon Harry in them and enforce his compliance. But Harry was quicker.
on the line…"
So Ettore made another floo call; this time contacting the Battellis.
"Tragically, that single fervent wish, that fracture of a second, causes it to happen and you will never even know, because you will have lost consciousness and soon die of magical exhaustion. There is no taking it back. With your magic and the impulse to attack you also unleash your fear, anger and pain, all great motivators for cruelty."
With almost no sound at all the bowl settled on the stone floor, handled with so much care by the Elf that levitated it – Alfar, Draco ascertained as he looked up briefly, already having sunken to his knees in front of the shadowy, silvery swirling liquid.
Pansy was in a right snit. And she had every right to be, in her humble opinion. Nothing in her life during the last few years had worked out the way it should have. First Draco had had the audacity to fall in love with their school's pretty boy and asked her to cover up for him so that neither Blaise's nor his parent's would learn of their affair. Of course she'd said yes, what else should a well-mannered, noble-minded girl of a respectable pureblood family have done if a friend asked for her help? Especially since she loved the two idiots. Very grudgingly, mind you, obstinate bastards that they were. Merlin, and without her, they would have just managed to make away with themselves somehow, or throw their cover, or destroy their twisted joy in life in some way or the other. Somehow, she just knew it; they were reckless and narrow-minded like that. Nonetheless she wouldn't have been averse of becoming the next Mrs Malfoy, or Zabini for that matter.
His eyes must have widened comically because both of the Slytherins started to chuckle at him; well, Zabini did. Malfoy's answer was more along the lines of a derisive snort.
He could feel Blaise's length, once again stiff and swollen against his stomach and he smirked at the dishevelled look, the dark brown locks, wet with sweat, clinging to his forehead, lips bruised and eyes clenched.
"Fred!" Arthur hissed, grabbing his son's shoulder tightly to restrain him. God, everything depended on the goodwill of the woman in front of them. They could do nothing to help if she didn't tell them where Harry was.
"Of course."
Maybe the two of them aspired to more than a convenience marriage after all.
"We'll have a late noon meal in the garden." Zabini said as he stepped past Harry towards the large window he had been looking out from. Then he turned suddenly, his eyes glinting as they travelled from the thin pyjama bottoms that the Gryffindor wore to his bare chest. For a short moment he locked eyes with Malfoy, and then he smirked back at Harry.
"Not because of that reason…" Blaise stated, shaking his head. "You should forgive him, because it was maybe a wise decision. He wouldn't have survived with us at his side, Draco. He would have died long before even reaching the age of his inheritance."
If only Blaise and Draco might perhaps forgive him for the betrayal he was about to commit… but how could he expect them to, having promised them to stay at Lanai Manor and let them court him and be honest with his two kidnappers turned suitors. When he was turning his back on them after this wonderful day and crushing the vague notion of a future together, the vapour of an idea that, if he was honest with himself, was there in his mind; nothing more than a new-born dream obliterated and washed away by the breach of trust Harry was about to commit.
The empty bottles were flung aside carelessly, clinging loudly as they hit the ground and rolled away and Severus immediately turned towards the wound in Potter's abdomen. The cleanly cut edges were raised just a little bit, the skin around them smeared red from blood.
So he let it be when Draco cocked his head and smiled at him as if he didn't quite understand what Harry was asking exactly. "Of course... Blaise and I haven't had our final exams and to be honest, the last year was rather... well, I don't think it would be a good idea to try and do the exams now. And you need to finish your education as well, or didn't you want to return to Hogwarts?"
Finally, with a decisive nod and the air of a war general surrounding her, she leaned forward with both hands on the table, intently gazing at him.
"I'm right here, sottomesso." Came that same soft voice with a strong Italian lilt to it.
If it should come to that, he at least wanted to have this meagre portion of Harry's life, this one day of seven years of knowing each other where the three of them had truly been happy together. Close.
"You tried to do what!?" Severus exclaimed, incensed that his friend had tried to get rid of something he treasured that much. "Don't you dare do anything to that painting, Lucius! I warn you!"
"No worries..." Harry began, waving the apology away. But his words were distracted at best; there was something in the blonde's steely eyes as they, too, fell onto the article laying to Hermione's feet, something he couldn't quite name but didn't like either way. As if those silver grey orbs were lakes covered with ice and frost, hiding whatever lurked beneath.
But then his head was tilted upwards and Blaise's face was so close that Harry had to lick over his suddenly dry lips. The magic around him changed, sizzling in the air full of potency and electrifying excitement and diving back into him like daggers, bringing with it the taste of power. A hand glided from the side of his face, stroking through his hair and finally cupping the back of his head, while Harry felt his heart beat louder and louder, though he honestly wasn't sure if the blood rushed out of his head or in. All Harry knew was that Blaise was going to kiss him. He was actually going to use those soft, full lips and kiss him! The first man to ever do that to Harry and should he be disturbed? Harry was sure he should at least be
‘Please don’t be dead!’ Blaise begged in his mind, his throat closing up as he pressed a finger gently into the soft skin of Harry’s throat, aware of the many eyes observing him. Mordred, he was so cold to the touch. But he could feel Harry’s pulse returning the pressure, far too softly for his liking and far too slow and unsteady, but it was there nonetheless.
"A Vykélari, Potter." Zabini corrected with a raised eyebrow. "And that is a fruit fork, it won't attack you."
It took only seconds for the whole process, Harry's magic already knowing and most likely trusting him, and for Blaise to spread his wings and let the stolen magic that was now indiscernible from his own dance over the surface of his feathers, drawing swirls and patterns more energetic than ever to confuse the submissive, to hold
“Giallina,” he addressed the Elf, his voice coming out more harshly than he intended it to, rougher, ”locate Harry!”
Harry cringed. "Could you not use that word, please? It makes me sound like an animal."
Then he let himself become serious once more, businesslike, just like he thought Harry might appreciate right now. "I think you are very apprehensive of your wings and that because of this, your magic won't allow the transformation. So I thought it might help if we tried to just show you. No spells." He added from under lowered lashes, wondering how Harry would react to his proposal once he understood its nature. As it was, right then he just frowned in confusion. "Why would my magic keep me from summoning my wings? I've had it under control for years."
Well, maybe that wasn't exactly true: he couldn't rid himself of the image of Blaise that had burned itself into his mid. Blaise with his copper and bronze wings, looking so … indescribably in tune with every slight movement of the wind, so free, so agile, so beautiful in those few seconds that Harry had seen him fly… it had been more natural than flying on a broom could ever be.
To be truthful, Blaise had, in the first years of their long internment in Hogwarts, mistaken Draco's obsession with the prodigy that was Harry James Potter with the jealous rage of a child used to be the centre of interest wherever he went, and to the not less powerful and destructive force of the pure boredom of a young, restless mind.
Because Harry still doesn't really believe them, Draco and Blaise offer to let him question them under veritaserum but Harry instead demands to speak to his friends, telling the Slytherins that he will believe Hermione and Ron. They promise to arrange for Harry to meet his friends on Monday.
And Harry's indignation at the unintentional possessiveness he projected in his direction.
And with that a ripple went through the silvery surface, the colours it showed mixed and swirled together. They rearranged themselves and then, moments later a new room took form, or rather one side of another room in Malfoy Manor. It was a kind of two-way mirror that formed a visual and acoustic connection between Malfoy and Lanai Manor. The set-up had been expensive, but it was a much more comfortable and
Dear Merlin, they were gorgeous and the way that each feather shifted with each movement, completely in tune with their owner's body was nothing less than amazing. Harry had never even seen his own wings fully, only a part of them the one time in his room - no, the room that Zabini and Malfoy had given him - and then only while they had surrounded him like the cocoon of a silkworm…
"I will make the same vow." Zabini said and then repeated Malfoy's words before carving the Tiwaz into his own flesh.
Next to him, painted with fine, delicate brushes stood the somewhat sinister figure of a man swathed in black, a foreign invader completely out of place amongst the greenery and the Nostalgia roses, even with the red haired submissive nestled into his side, held there with one arm, as if it was the only place Ives had any right to be in. A waterfall of white-golden silk cascaded down his back, vanishing behind the man's shoulders and his confident blue eyes held a ruthless sparkle as he regarded Harry, reminding him uncomfortably of a goshawk, a predator, a killer who was as effective, fast and merciless as he was intelligent; but not necessarily evil. Just hungry.
But he did scrutinize the near perfect mask of calmness, showing his suspiciousness by doing so, before he returned to the matter that had lead him to seek out his ancestor's portrait to begin with, and which now might turn out to be the less grave topic discussed today. "Well, although Harry was certainly much more accommodating and complaisant after his time with your husband - though I must say you should maybe talk to him about the way he speaks of our family - Harry had…"
Harry.
This is a chronological summary of the story. Everything that happened so far is outlined very briefly by the text that is in italics. Reading only this should refresh your memory. If, however, you feel that the given information is not enough, the text below is a more detailed version that contains everything that I, as the author, think is important for the story.
"... I didn't mean to corner you so." Blaise continued, making Harry force himself to pay attention again. "But I know now what you meant when you said I was not thinking clearly. But the influence was just so subtle, I didn't really notice it at all."
That in itself might not be as bad, though he was starting to get along with them just fine right now, but if they had no real esteem for him as a person, if they just saw him as a submissive to be played with and exploited, they might retract their protection, send him away to his friends, whom Harry would endanger with his presence. Or was that a lie? God, he didn't know, he just didn't know and he didn't want to even chance to endanger them again after all they had been through in the past. If anyone deserved safety and peace right now, surely it was them…
With a harsh curse Blaise followed, not even wasting a moment on the naïve hope that the birds might let them pass through to their creator unchallenged – their blood thirst was all too obvious. Fervently he kept his eyes focused on the form of his lover who contrasted starkly against the flickering light of Harry’s birds like a dark angel, fearing that any glance might be the last he saw of him, that any time now the birds would attack and turn his fiancé into one of the crispy, mutilated bodies littering the courtyard.
Once more he submerged below the water's surface, his hands moving to keep him down. Immediately the water pressed against his ears, filling them with the sound of his own rushing blood, the sound of the water currents moving, the small waves hitting the edge of the pool. He heard Draco's left leg moving in a slow, small circle, disturbing the water's flow, the sound exaggerating the movement because he was so close and because there was barely anything else to hear.
"Tempting." Draco murmured, lips close to Blaise's, dark and pale eyes clashing, as he deliberately left the other wondering if the comment was meant for him or the image of their submissive that the Italian had conjured.
Next to him, Blaise slid out of his chair and approached the younger Vykélari. Ignoring the unimpressive glare of swimming eyes, he gently turned the other's chair around to face him and hunkered down in front of the brunet.
For some moments only the sound of Adler's fingertips tapping softly onto the wooden end of his armrest could be heard, and Draco looked up again, poised and with a mostly neutral expression firmly fixed on his handsome face.
"'Somewhere'? Harry, you are not in Britain anymore! Here in Italy it is a serious offence to violate another's home by use of the floo connection. Most wizards ward the area around their fireplaces with traps, often lethal traps, that kill you the moment you step out of the fireplace without the permission of the owner."
"You can take it willingly or have it administered by force." The man said in an almost bored tone of voice and Harry shot him a nasty glare, hating him more with every second, every icy word that left his lips. But his blackmailer only raised an eyebrow in challenge, a confident reminder of how defenceless his scheming had left Harry.
He still thought that had something to do with his magic reacting to theirs. He couldn't
It really was some strange quirk of fate. As it was, the following meeting between Draco Malfoy and one Pansy Parkinson would rewrite history; well, not literally, since no one would ever learn of it; but still, it would change the following years for the entire wizarding community in Britain. Draco himself would come to rather enjoy that thought, it was so uplifting to know of the impact one had on the world one lived in. But we digress; When his former girlfriend asked the Malfoy heir to help her father evade prison, Draco had amiably agreed under the condition that her family would stay loyal to Draco and Draco alone. After all, it wouldn't do to assist someone for free - he had after all the business acumen of a Malfoy, and it would be a shame not to exploit the chance even if he decided to expulso himself afterwards; maybe he could even get Pansy to do it herself as a repayment, she might find it amusing.
Wasn't it cruel to continue letting them court him when they invested so much of themselves, more than Harry was? They were defying their parents for him and god ... Harry felt like a wedge driven between the two generations of Zabinis and Malfoys, with both parties hammering him deeper into the rift between them by turns. Maybe he should remove himself before the wounds he inflicted on those families festered and scarred beyond healing.
"Are you
With renewed enthusiasm, Harry climbed out of the ridiculously large bed and walked around it towards the curved foot bench. Like the previous morning he found a pile of clothing, which his two captors had laid out for him when they had accompanied him back to his rooms the previous evening. Harry had been too tired to mind much and hadn't even complained when Blaise had vanished behind the curtain to the side of the king size bed and returned with a fresh pyjama which he had deposited on the bed. It seemed they didn't trust him to dress properly and Harry had thought he should maybe tell them that there was a reason why he had been so tastelessly clothed during their school days, but really, the Dursleys were none of their business; and he had still been so very tired.
"And then don't forget the prestige and influence the Malfoys would gain" Cygnus spoke up, looking enthralled by the possibilities and a little bit wistful at not being alive to actually witness everything. "Mordred, Prince, with the help of the young submissive and his betrothed and some good advisors at his side…" at that point he winked at Lucius and Severus "… our Draco could literally overrun the ministry!"
"I will send you that spying potion also, in case he gets lost." Severus said. With Potter's heightened magical strength he might detect normal tracking charms, but the spying potion was veritably undetectable.
A heartfelt THANK YOU to Sara, adafrog, littlechinesedoll and lexisnotgroundedanymore for the reviews! And thanks for the kudos and well, for reading my scribble in the first place!
Harry whipped his head around and there stood the man it belonged to, only a few meters away from him when ten thousand would have been too close, his wand still raised from binding Harry's magic.
"I am here."
Curious himself, Blaise trained his eyes on the brunet, observing with interest how his golden skin flushed appealingly. What, by Mordred, had Ives told the Gryffindor to embarrass him so?
And he wanted to see the dark Italian come undone in his arms.
“Ouch! Potter!” Draco cursed, rubbing his sore jaw while his attacker scrambled backwards, or at least tried to: unused to the added weight on his back and still blind, he almost lost his footing and toppled backwards but he managed to catch himself just in time; courtesy of the added organ of equilibrium in his hip. Sometimes Draco hated nature, especially when it worked for his enemy and against him...
One could argue that it might have been more efficient to just change the wards but neither Blaise nor Draco were exceptionally experienced and a mistake could weaken the Manor's defences considerably, a danger they weren't prepared to risk.
"Good." Adler gave him a rare, approving smile. "Now, I believe you were speaking about what happened after our submissives talked."
Absentmindedly Blaise pushed himself away from the pool's wall, treading the water softly with both his legs, not minding the resistance it offered to his movements as he floated there on his back in what was the closest thing to weightlessness there was on earth.
