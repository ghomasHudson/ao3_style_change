Harry became bothered by the mention of Professor Snape, ‘but he could be wrong.’
‘I caught this boy loitering on the seventh-floor professor,’ Filch said maliciously, knowing he was humiliating Draco in front of everyone right now. ‘He claims to have been invited to your party, but I assume he was gate crashing.’
The things I do for Dumbledore, Harry thought as Slughorn excused himself for a few moments, leaving Harry alone with a man who insisted he write an autobiography. Harry knew people saw him as a celebrity of some kind with the rumours circulating about him in the daily prophet, but he had never seen himself as anyone crucially important. If anything, he hated being the focus of the public eye, especially when it meant everyone would be closely observing his every action or word.
there's only three chapters left including an epilogue so not long left :( hopefully, the next chapter should be up by tuesday/wednesday <3 Thank you for all the comments and for reading <3 (also i apologise for all the angst)
By ten pm, Harry had finally collapsed onto the array of blankets on his bed, the fatigue leaving his entire body dried up. He had had to practically pry himself away from Hermione’s incessant comments about his new potion’s textbook. She was convinced that the Half Blood Prince was some treacherous wizard and that the book – like Tom Riddle’s diary – was some type of dark artifice. With Ron’s help, Harry had shaken her concern with a yawn that prompted him to head to the dorms.
Harry was sitting on his makeshift bed with the letter in his hands when Ron entered the tent and sighed at the sight of his best friend.
All three pairs of eyes settled onto Harry in a mixture of disbelief and indignation.
‘We have to be escorted?’ Harry asked.
‘Yes Mr Malfoy, you are quite right.’
Draco stopped mid-sentence as he looked at the scene in front of him. At first, he saw Hermione and then moved towards Ron, his heart began to beat erratically as he finally turned towards the kneeled figure on the ground.
‘Take the boys down to the cellar!’ Bellatrix instructed, walking closer to Hermione till their faces were only inches apart. ‘I’d like to have a talk with this one.’
‘Yeah, maybe.’
‘Fancy.’ Ron muttered to which the other two nodded in agreement.
Harry felt his chest unconstrict and grinned at the sparkling of playfulness in her eyes.
By the time Harry reached outside Snape’s office, the conversation was already well under way. He pressed his ear against the door, desperate to hear it.
The snatcher who had been holding Harry hostage suddenly loosened his grip ever so slightly as the man again began to sift through the list.
‘Ron!’
‘Quiet!’ Bellatrix screamed at him; her eyes shifted towards Greyback who was clutching the Gryffindor sword in his hands. ‘Where on earth did you get that? It was in my vault!’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You see, I was ready to let the first time go.’ Draco muttered, ‘but, you just can’t help being nosy? Can you?’
The Gryffindor students turned their heads in the direction where Slughorn was suddenly standing. Harry’s mouth dried as he realised Slughorn was staring at Draco’s cauldron, his ashen eyebrows raised in surprise.
‘Harry Potter sir!’
‘Relax Harry, I know.’ Ginny rolled her eyes, ‘if it makes you feel better, I don’t like you too.’
‘Harry, what on earth are you doing?’
Over the course of the past year, Harry had read these words so many times that he had now committed the letter to memory. No matter where the trio had travelled, he had protected the flimsy piece of paper with his life, always ensuring it was with him before they departed for another destination. Harry was unsure how such a miniscule object could exercise this much control over him. It had transformed into a different person, someone only living for the next second in which he could read Draco’s scrawled writing as if it was a drug keeping him alive.
‘Quite a while,’ she replied rather chirpily.
And with that, the topic of Draco Malfoy’s letters was forgotten and replaced with the various supplies they were to buy that afternoon. They had been compiling their shopping lists when their O.W.L results had arrived. Harry felt his spirits lift as he scanned his grades, finding that he hadn’t completely failed every subject as he had pessimistically predicted. After eating the delicious lunch prepared by Mrs Weasley, they had all gotten dressed and piled into the ministry car that would take them to Diagon Alley.
For every day for the next year, Draco recalled this encounter from every angle he could think of. Even though Harry had most likely forgotten it had even occurred, Draco was stricken with immense regret. Whenever he saw Harry in the corridors surrounded by countless admirers, Draco wished he hadn’t run away that night. He wished that he had said something in response to Harry, something that could’ve possibly bridged a gap between them. But things only worsened as Draco’s father fought against Harry and his friends at the ministry. Things seemed irreparable now.
‘Okay,’ Hermione cut in, standing between both boys. ‘That’s enough now.’
Harry stayed silent, watching the blurred greenery pass by the window.
‘You see Harry, Severus has kindly agreed to watch over Mr Malfoy following his father’s imprisonment and finds so far, that he is harbouring no threat or pursuing any suspicious endeavours that you might be thinking he is.’
‘They’re beautiful.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You just looked desperate okay?’ Harry replied awkwardly, ‘I just wanted to help out.’
‘Both of you eat quicker,’ Hermione dictated, stealing away Harry’s attention. ‘We have double potions in five minutes.’
As both Harry and Ron trudged into the Great Hall several minutes later, they found Hermione and Ginny already seated and smiling knowingly at them. Ron was quick to begin shovelling various breakfast foods onto his plate.
Draco’s mind was taken elsewhere as he heard Harry’s quiet sobs from the same deserted area behind the castle. A part of him wanted to walk away, back to the castle, to avoid facing Harry for a second time. Yet he had waited too long for another opening such as this to abandon it. And so, Draco again, took feeble steps towards Harry’s hunched figure, watching him with a softness as if his gaze was enough to break Harry further.
The intoxication he felt dissipated as soon as Hermione’s gasp was heard from behind him and Harry’s body was burning now.
‘Dumbledore picked me up early.’
‘Look at this!’ He exclaimed, ‘this girly’s reportedly travelling with Potter.’
Harry hadn’t realised how exhausting shopping was until it was time for their yearly back to school trip. But this time, their trip was distinctly different from the previous years. Not only did they need the security of Hagrid as they went from store to store, but every building was tainted with a sense of unease and fear. Everyone was on edge, afraid of the circumstances that had fallen upon the wizarding world with the return of Voldemort and his followers. The trio stopped outside one of the only remaining stores on the street: Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, ‘well I asked Luna, but Neville had already asked her beforehand.’
‘You could’ve asked Ginny,’ Hermione suggested, causing Ron to snap his head towards Harry.
A scoff left Draco’s mouth as he strode closer to Harry, taking a threatening stance upon his body as if Harry would begin to duel him.
‘Draco Malfoy, I assume?’ Dumbledore probed; Harry nodded in response. ‘Am I right in presuming that you and Mr Malfoy have formed some kind of rivalry over the years?’
Harry’s eyes remained stationed on Draco’s footsteps for the next hour, waiting for them to move in any direction. But they stayed stagnant. Harry fell asleep that night with the map pressed tightly against his chest, his dreams again filled with painful nightmares.
‘Why the fuck did you do that?’ Draco hissed at him, stormy eyes frantically darting across the room. ‘Forget this.’
With his fists clenched under the table, Harry only bowed his head, knowing that saying anything further on the matter was a lost cause. No one was taking him seriously. Harry knew his suspicions weren’t a result of his hatred for Draco, after all he had considered this before. But there was something deeper, a burning feeling in his gut that was almost cancerous and had convinced him to continue pursuing his paranoia.
And a few minutes later, the carriage was silent aside from both Draco and Harry’s muted breathing.
‘What is it McLaggen?’
‘You’re crying again.’ Draco said quietly, yet this went unnoticed by Harry who glared at him.
‘Petrificus Totalus!’
‘Change of the plans, we’re going to headquarters.’ The leader said, turning towards Harry with a sneering grin on his face. ‘I think we just caught Harry Potter.
Draco shivered as his aunt came closer and bent down, ‘so?’
‘Quick Harry Potter and his friends, grab onto me!’
‘Malfoy’s a child.’ Hermione replied, visibly doubtful of Harry’s suspicions.
The disappointment in Dumbledore’s words made Harry flush slightly.
Draco stood next to a tall, black cabinet that loomed over his already lean figure and made him look smaller than he was. He was touching the surface of it with his right hand as his mother spoke to the man attending the shop. An equally stern expression was spread across her features, allowing Harry to notice how alike the mother and son were. As Draco said something, both his mother and the attendant turned towards him. Draco’s body visibly stiffened as the attendant said something in response.
‘Finite Incantatem.’ Draco whispered, bent down next to Harry’s body that was now slowly regaining its motion.
Harry smiled amusedly, ‘god, they’re never gonna stop, are they?’
Trigger warning: violence.
‘Ron!’ Hermione scolded as Harry’s brows furrowed and knitted in the centre of his wide forehead.
‘You tripped?’
‘Let me go!’ Ron yelled, struggling against the snatcher's grip as he desperately gazed at Hermione who was now shaking in fear. ‘Hermione!’
Draco swallowed but nodded in obedience, not sparing Harry another glance as he followed Snape into the castle ground. Harry frowned, wondering why Snape had focused more on punishing Draco than him. But a few moments later, Harry was interrogated and searched by Professor Flitwick as soon as Draco was out of sight and after several minutes, he had finally allowed Harry to go to the Great Hall. His friend’s faces flooded with relief as he made his way down the Gryffindor aisle to his usual seat. Whispers surrounded him on every side, curious students baffled by his blood-stricken clothes and lack of uniform.
‘Sounds like a Malfoy thing to do. What a git.’ Ron seethed out, his hatred for Malfoy clearly showing in his words.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Draco,’ Bellatrix suddenly said, turning to her hesitant sister. ‘Call Draco!’
‘Yes, he is Harry, you can’t even deny it. You said it yourself, you saw his dark mark.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Look at what Malfoy’s doing.’
‘He’s not coming back Harry.’
Numerous pairs of eyes – including Draco’s – looked towards Harry in an overflowing level of astonishment. Here he was, the boy who lived, publicly coming to the aid of the son of a well-known death eater. Harry knew he was being completely irrational by what he was doing right now, but the waiver of embarrassment on Draco’s face had reminded him of himself. The ministry’s insistence that Harry was a renowned liar last year had led him to suffer many humiliating instances and he knew Draco was already under much scrutiny for his father’s actions.
‘Nope,’ Hermione said, picking up a goblet filled with a sparkling pink drink. ‘Cormac seems to quite like you though.’
Dumbledore shook his head, his silver beard moving along with the motion. ‘I trust Severus’s judgement and besides, you might want to give Mr Malfoy the benefit of the doubt. You and him are more alike than you may perceive.’
‘I’ve had enough mother.’ He snapped and shrugged off the robes which fell onto the ground around him. ‘I’ll just get my robes elsewhere.’
But Draco was significantly taken aback to see no other than the famous Harry Potter seated on the crevice between two stone pillars with his face buried in his hands. His crying was anything but loud, it was muffled and strained as his body shook with a visible fragility to it. Despite the warm weather, Harry wore a thick black hoodie double his size and now, as he sat hunched over, the blackness seemed to be swallowing him.
‘Liquid luck,’ Hermione interrupted, her eyes focused clearly on the vial of clear liquid.
‘He’s your best friend – ‘
Everyone but Draco looked towards him, the scorching heat of their gazes numbed Harry’s skin as he stumbled forward. The bite of toast he had eaten earlier swirled in his stomach as he stationed himself in front of the cauldron, trying to take in its scent as best as he could.
‘I…’ Ron trailed off, looking guilty, ‘I accidentally dropped something into your cauldron whilst trying to gain a look.’
Next chapter = the infamous train scene
Swivelling his body in one motion, Harry was taken aback to see Luna and Mr Ollivander emerge from the shadows, both looking considerably haggard. A goblin who was suspiciously eyeing both boys followed them, his eyes widening as he recognised Harry whose disguise had completely faltered now.
To Harry’s utter dismay, the next hour was spent with Slughorn moving him from person to person who were all as equally thrilled to meet the chosen one. Harry had never been skilled with small talk and often found himself at a loss of words when asked a question, Slughorn would see that as his chance to step in and steer the conversation.
Harry picked up goblet, guzzling the fizzing liquid to calm his parched throat. He detected something like speculation settle on Hermione’s face as she observed him.
Before Ron could reply, Harry was rushing in the same direction Draco was moving. He kept the distance between them, ensuring his footsteps weren’t resounding enough for Draco to realise he was being followed again. Harry recognised the route instantly; Draco was taking long strides towards the same area where he had found Harry crying the previous year. His icy blond hair seemed to be glowing as he walked, contrasting the dense blackness of his sweater and jeans. His appearance always seemed to be at war with itself.
The man cocked his head, ‘and your name?’
‘The Malfoys are death eaters though.’ Harry murmured, shifting his gaze towards his two best friends.
‘You said we needed an intervention ‘Mione, now’s your chance.’
‘What do you lot want?’
The desperation in Harry’s voice was enough to convince Draco that there was nothing more he could do to help, and he nodded. Everything in him yearned for him to stay and push Harry’s boundaries, but Draco knew that he didn’t deserve the right to do this. Not after the many years he and his family had tormented Harry when he was already suffering.
It was hellish for Harry the next morning. His first day back was usually filled him with an immense build up of excitement and even with the sleepiness still roaring through his veins, he would still get up almost immediately to get ready. But this night’s worth of nightmares had left him drained to the bone, his eyes burning with the acidity of daylight and head thudding with exhaustion. When Ron had practically shaken him awake, Harry had just wanted to smother himself with his duvet. He had even contemplated skipping his first few classes for the sake of his sanity, but after a few moments of deliberation, he knew he didn’t want to miss his first day.
‘I’m done.’
‘Why on earth is Draco Malfoy writing letters to you?’ She said in indignation, her eyes following the words written. ‘Has he gone utterly and completely insane?’
‘That’s not why I’m here.’
Harry gritted his teeth, fighting the urge to shoot Hermione an irate glare for bringing up the topic in front of Ron. The last thing he wanted was to cause any misunderstandings over his non-existent feelings for his best friend’s sister.
Ensuring he had spent enough time debating with the man within Slughorn’s peripheral, Harry excused himself and attempted to locate his friends. He waved at Neville and Luna who stood across the room, but both failed to respond, discussing something too deeply to notice Harry. An abrupt grip on his arm made Harry look up startled to see Hermione looking stricken with irritation.
It was this letter that had exposed his relationship with Draco to Ron. One night, several weeks ago, Harry had fallen asleep with the letter clutched in his hands and this had resulted in Ron taking it from his sleeping figure and had read its content. His reaction the next day had been much more subdued than Harry had expected. It was Ron’s reaction that he had assumed would be the most disastrous due to all of the cruel things Draco had done to them all. Yet, Ron had only stared at Harry in shock for several minutes before he had proceeded to comfort a clear anxiety ridden Harry.
Harry looked up to see a knowing look on Dumbledore’s face, his blackened hand propped up against his aged face.
Letting out a scoff, Ron ignored what his girlfriend had said, ‘are you forgetting about all those times he boasted about being a pure-blood and looked down on muggle-borns like Hermione? Sounds very death eater-esque to me.’
‘I-I didn’t mean it like that,’ Harry spluttered.
‘Calm down Ronald. The food isn’t going anywhere.’ Hermione lectured; her eyes focused on the open daily prophet in front of her.
The sound of footsteps made Harry rush to the side, the door flung open and a distressed Draco began striding towards the dungeons. Harry held his breath, pondering over the words he had just overheard.
‘How’re you both feeling?’ She asked enthusiastically.
‘No sir, it’s fine.’ Harry spluttered, ‘I’ve just been feeling a bit suspicious over something.’
‘I said, are you taking potions this year?’
Harry again, put on his Slughorn-approved façade and swivelled to face the red-faced professor, a wine goblet clasped in his hand.
‘Nothing,’ Harry replied, ready to walk out of the tent for some fresh air.
‘Would you rather I left you here for an early trip back to London?’
‘Better take these lot to the ministry then.’
‘I know mate.’
Without any more prolongation, Dobby apparated them directly onto the beach outside Bill and Fleur’s cottage. As they landed, Draco’s body knocked against Harry’s, his arms shaking vigorously.
Harry’s attention was piqued by this, having a vial of such a potion would prove to be particularly useful to his fight against Voldemort. Yet he couldn’t help but let out a sigh, knowing his potion-making skills were subpar at best. As he gathered his materials and opened his textbook, Harry noticed the marking on the first page.
Bellatrix’s menacing voices made all of them turn towards to see her grasping Hermione, wand pressed against her throat as if to threaten them. Ron instantly dropped his hand, his face whitening in alarm. Harry felt his breathing hitch as a squeaky noise above made him turn upwards to see Dobby settled on the chandelier situated above their heads. It seemed to also gain the attention of the others in the room as a few moments passed in silence before they all pushed backwards in different directions to avoid the crashing of the glass pieces against the floor. Whilst Ron grasped onto Hermione who had been pushed forward and shielded her from the glass, Draco had unconsciously moved in the opposite direction to his parents, barrelling straight towards Harry. Harry grabbed onto Draco’s arm, pulling to his side and amidst the chaos of everything, Dobby moved in front of all four of their bodies.
“Now, Potter,” Draco began, very close to Harry’s ear so that he could hear him over the music, “you must be careful to Not. Touch. Anything. This place is good for picking someone up, but it isn’t exactly known for it’s sanitation.”
“Honestly, Ron. This is about more than reigniting schoolyard antics. This is a chance for Harry to move on and live life to the fullest.”
“It’s fine, Pans. Just a long day.” Draco replied, swishing his wand and repairing the glass. “I’d hate to interrupt whatever it is you have going on in there… Who do you have in there?”
“Before we tuck in,” Ginny said, standing and raising her glass. “I’d like to make a toast to my good friend and brother.” The rest of the party raised their glasses as well.
“True, which is why I’m not attempting it and risk making a fool of myself. You, on the other hand…”
Oliver Wood, ignoring the fact that Draco was dripping wet, was still animatedly discussing the Quidditch match that they had been watching. Draco followed at Oliver’s heels, his shoes squelching on the sidewalk.
.  In fact, I would hardly call us anything at all.  I will be leaving. Have a
“I hope you’re not exaggerating when you say
“Well Cormac, I am curious as to how Draco and you became friends.  A rather odd pairing, I think.” Percy interrupted, clearly missing the anxiety rolling off Cormac in waves and Draco’s nearly
Fueled by the adrenaline of a successful fix, and his own proclivity for rash decisions, Harry apparated to Roger’s flat instead of Grimmauld Place.  He knocked on the door and Davies answered.
Draco was above all of the fanfare.  The only reason he was marrying the Half-Blood Prince was because the law of the land allowed Snaperdinck to marry whomever he wanted to.  Draco had remained true to his vow to never love again, and held himself aloof.  The only joy he found during this time was in his daily rides.
Draco's face was pale and drawn with pain, but he managed a half-smile. "Fancy meeting you here."
The masked man's jaw firmed.  "I challenge you to a duel of wits."
Harry spluttered in righteous indignation, while Draco laughed out loud. "You deserved that," he said, still smirking at Harry.
Draco mounted a spare horse, and Snaperdinck escorted him away.
Potter said in an attempt to cheer him.
After a restless night spent in one of the guest bedrooms, Harry trudged down the stairs, put the kettle on to boil, and slumped into a chair at the kitchen table. Draco came in as Harry was steeping himself a cup of tea. Draco helped himself to the tea, and Harry wordlessly got up to get himself another cup. He sat down at the table once more, wary eyes on his volatile boyfriend.
Malfoy brayed like the jackass he was. "How much did you drink last night, Potter? You seem to still be feeling the effects."
"I'll be killing myself shortly," said Draco.
"Him and any other spirit," Draco confirmed. "To be safe, however, you'll need to repeat the sage and salt treatment once a week for the next few months."
"I have a name you might find interesting," Malfoy drawled in response. He had seated himself on the sofa in the lounge area of the suite, one ankle crossed over the other knee. He looked elegant, relaxed, and sexy as hell.
"Mange and fleas," Potter cut in.
Harry winced. "Unfortunately," he began, "this is not the first time you've injured this shoulder. Two years ago, it was your rotator cuff, and before that, you had a SLAP tear."
"Is that going to keep him out?" asked Potter, ruffling his hair with a hand.
"Have you ever considered piracy?" asked Harry, climbing up on the ledge.  "I think you'd make a brilliant Dread Pirate Riddle."  He jumped down, followed closely by Ineville.  They mounted the remaining horses, and the four of them cantered from the courtyard, making their escape.
"Gagging for it, are you?"
Draco glanced up quickly, only to see that Harry was making fun of him again. "Berk," he grumbled. Draco then added, "I'm still unsure which surname to use."
"I thought you weren't eager for this."
"Why don't you pull out and let me top?"
"Come along," said Harry. "I have a plan to warm you up from the inside out."
"I will help you up," Ineville offered, extending a hand.
Hagrid laid Harry on the table, and Max bent over and placed an ear to Harry's chest.  "He's mostly dead," he pronounced.  "However, that's better than being all the way dead."  Max looked at his guests.  "For a miracle to work, there has to be a good reason for it to happen."
Ineville was surprised.  "Where did you get that?"
Draco grinned in malicious glee and turned up the volume.
"Superior Labrum Anterior and Posterior," Hermione chimed in. She stepped forward and clasped both elbows in her hands. "What Harry is trying to tell you is that this is most likely a career-ending injury, Malfoy. I'm sorry."
"My betrothed is a wealthy man," said Draco.  "He will pay a ransom if you release me."
Draco felt the stiffness seep from his shoulders and spine. "That's what I'll do then," he decided. "Thank you, Harry."
"Go away, or I'll call the Troll Squad," threatened Max.
Harry chuckled, relieved that Draco was up to such banter. He waved his wand slowly over Draco's arm, upper chest, and specifically his shoulder. He frowned at the results he was seeing.
Zabini did as instructed.
"Mm," Draco hummed as he woke up slowly. He smiled at Harry before nudging Harry onto his back. "Want to ride you," he husked.
"It was worth every sickle," said Draco, winding one arm around Harry's waist and the other around the back of his neck. "Do we want to talk, or shall we make this marriage official?"
"Son, I am begging you. Please!"
Draco rolled his eyes, even as he smirked. "Very well, Harry. You may join me in my bath."
"I'll be right there!" Harry called out, already rushing to Ward Four. When he arrived, a junior Healer waved to get his attention and directed Harry into a curtained-off examination room. He slowed his momentum and entered the area at a sane, professional pace.
"What is so bloody important, then?" asked Draco, voice tetchy with disappointment.
"Blueberries!" cried Draco, suddenly all sweetness and sunshine. He picked up his spoon and dove in.
"I wanted to undress you," Draco protested.
"That's the Amortentia talking," Draco quipped. "It's how I won you over."
Draco's eyes narrowed. "That's odd," he drawled. "You don't look like my Mum, and I don't believe I'm ten years old."
“Deal,” Draco nodded. “I better head out, Cormac is waiting for me. His elf is making us dinner.” He stood up and walked over to the wall of fireplaces. He waved to Harry as he called the name of McLaggen’s house into the green flames and was off.  Harry, still holding a grudge against floo travel, chose to walk back to Grimmauld Place. Ron and Hermione were staying with Hermione’s parents for the weekend going over wedding plans. He’d finally have the house to himself, and it was the perfect opportunity for him to have Davies over for the night without interruptions.
“Well, you’d think you would’ve grown up at all!  What good, pray tell, does the Department of Magical Games and Sports actually do for the Wizarding World, hmm? I don’t believe we would perish without your presence.” Percy retorted, his chest puffing up, all thoughts of civility leaving his mind.
“Just send some home with Hermione and Ron,” Ginny said, taking a handful for herself. “I’m sure he’ll appreciate it.”
******************
“And you think I’m the right solution?” Harry asked incredulously.
“Hey! Those are mine. I earned them fair and square for cheering up another utter tit I know.” Ginny playfully slapped at Pansy’s hand, getting her a glare from Pansy before she gave in and handed Pansy one.
******************
Harry has been, up until this point, pretty consumed with thoughts of Quidditch. Quidditch was Harry’s life. But now,
“Oh yes, of course, how silly of me,” Draco’s voice dripped with sarcasm. “They’ll just welcome me, a former death eater, with open arms and throw flowers at my feet on the most important day of their lives.”
Another important moment, is when they are all at the Yule Ball and Harry makes this observation:
“I won’t be taking no for an answer, Potter. I’m prepared to sit here all day until you accept.” She crossed her arms defiantly.
“That’s not the only bad news,” Hermione said. She gingerly pulled the sheet back from Harry’s leg so that he could see it clearly. A sizable chunk was missing just above his knee, and there were deep claw marks around it as if something had dragged him down by his leg.
The Third Seeker will have her turn in Half Blood Prince, spoilers, it’s Ginny. We will also give honorable mentions to Viktor Krum, as a Seeker he clearly appreciates and respects although Ron seems to be the one who has the bigger crush on Krum.
smart,
“Why?” Draco was appalled.
“At least another fifteen minutes,” Percy sighed, looking at his watch again.
“Oh shit,” Draco stopped eating and began to dab at his shirt with a napkin. A bright orange stain had appeared on his otherwise pristine shirt. He knew he couldn’t use magic around muggles, but he also didn’t want to look like a slob in public.
anything,” Neville muttered to himself as he gathered some supplies.
In fact, he’s already starting to show some characteristics of being a friend. He actually has some concern about Draco’s safety and worries about what else Voldemort might do.
“Charlie? How many Weasley’s are there?!” Draco’s utter confusion made Pansy laugh.
“Yeah, that too.” Percy replied distractedly. He quickly stuffed a letter into his cloak pocket.
“It’s only the first day of us working together, I hope your vocabulary is big enough. It’d be a shame if you ran out of insults before the Quidditch season started.”
The next morning, Draco woke up to loud music blaring.  He truthfully couldn’t believe Pansy had fallen so quickly and deeply in love with muggle music.  Could he have done without the phrase “Sleazy, sick of all your lines so cheesy, sorry daddy but I’m not that easy?” Probably.  Did he have the rock solid balls to ever mention that to Pansy? Probably not.
“Yeah,” Draco answered. “But, usually, you refer to me as Malfoy.”
“Do you always let your employees speak to you like that?” Percy whispered at Oliver. “You should fire him, it’s what I did.”  Draco’s eyes widened slightly when he heard this. So that’s why he hadn’t seen Harry around...it was because he got fired.
“She won’t let me have any say! How can I not be miserable?” Harry grumbled, reaching for the kettle to pour himself some tea. Before Draco could interrupt, Harry continued, “I wanted lilies…she turned me down. I asked if we could hold the ceremony on Hogwarts grounds, she laughed! It’s like she doesn’t want my input at all.”
(388)
“I know what you mean,” Harry nodded. “It’s not so bad when I get to leave the office on time and don’t get called in on weekends.”
A wave of emotions raced through Draco as he transfigured the wooden bench into a more comfortable chair. He was frustrated that even so many years removed from Hogwarts, Harry Potter was still overshadowing him. And he was mad that winning seemed to be more important to Cormac than he was. But as he watched Potter circle around the Quidditch pitch looking for the snitch, he could tell that it was helping Potter’s mood. Although he was loath to admit it, Potter was a better Seeker than he was, and was certainly a better seeker than his opposition so at least this game would end quickly.
(152).
“Yeah, sure,” Harry said through his fingers. “I will do literally anything to get rid of this hangover. My head hasn’t hurt this much since Voldemort was inside of it.”
Neville just nodded, ignoring the question, and made sure Harry was gently lowered onto the couch, a feat in itself given Harry’s state of inebriation.
Mrs. Weasley ushered them to the table as Harry pulled the maroon and gold striped sweater over his button down.
“What was I supposed to do? I wanted to help! I needed to help!”
“I’ll have an egg white omelette with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms with wheat toast, no butter. And he’ll have a full English, eggs extra runny and sausage well done, please” Draco said, dramatically snapping his menu shut.
It felt like all of the air had been sucked out of the room.  This was the opposite of what he wanted to happen. His fingers stopped moving and clutched the edge of the table. Why, in Merlin’s name, was his school rival currently limping towards the empty chair at the end of the table. Draco tried to school his features from shock to passivity but it ended up just making his face look like he’d eaten something sour. Of course that was the exact moment Harry looked up and met his eyes. Harry went from limping to nearly stumbling, his dirty trainer squeaking as he tried to catch himself.  Naturally the sound echoed through the room and it took every ounce of self control Draco had to not burst out laughing.
wants to be with you for you and not for tickets to Quidditch games or co-signing houses that are close to work. Leave Percy. Let him fend for himself with Cormac, they’re both prats. But you deserve better.”
“--I’m not here to play,” Harry said quickly. “Just a spectator.”
dinner now.”
“He quit?”
“So, so small,” Harry kept repeating to himself while pinching his fingers to indicate to Neville just how small he felt the children were.  Neville ushered Harry out of the bar and guided him back towards Hogwarts.
“Do you trust me?” Harry asked. “Because I’m telling you now, that it’s going to be fine, Draco. Will you just fucking go with me, please?”
We’ll start with my least favorite of the redemption arcs, Albus Dumbledore. I’m not a fan of Dumbledore or his actions, but there is one particular moment that is applicable to Draco. Harry and Hermione are discussing the things that they’ve learned from Rita Skeeter's tell-all about Dumbledore, and Harry is disgusted. But Hermione, points out:
“Her name is Ginny,” Draco added. But the blush spreading across his cheeks betrayed his true feelings.
broomstick--'
“Work has been insane lately,” Harry said, making himself at home on the couch. Roger hastily straightened some of the pieces of parchment that had been strewn on the coffee table in front of Harry. “Did you get my owl the other day? The one about going to The Burrow?”
“Ginny! What are you doing out here? You should be inside where it’s safe!’
“Err, thanks.” Harry replied and rubbed the back of his neck. “I actually applied for a position at Hogwarts that I’m really excited about. Are you still with Percy? What are you doing here?”
“I appreciate the concern for my ‘new life journey,’ but if the two of you don’t let me get my trunk and leave, none of it will matter because I’ll miss the beginning of term.”  Harry could feel the now familiar rise of anger and frustration threatening to come to the surface.  He knew his friends meant well, but acting as though a position at Hogwarts was going to make up for the fact his girlfriend died because of him was a ridiculous notion.  Not to mention that if word of his condition made it to the Board of Governors, he’d be kicked out and locked back in Grimmauld Place in a heartbeat.
“I guess you get your wish after all,” Draco said. “Let’s get this over with.”
“Do not walk away from me Malfoy.” Harry growled.
“In fact, first impressions aren’t anything at all if you’re going to be stuck around someone for the foreseeable future.” Ron continued, having clearly not realized Harry’s internal struggle as he was very preoccupied with his own wedding. “Thanks for teaching me that and for always laughing at me as much as you yell at me. I’m glad that you were finally able to sort out your priorities, and agreed to marry me.
Even though Harry had been placed on desk duty nearly a year ago, he still fought the urge to roll his eyes as soon as he stepped into Percy’s office. Behind Percy’s desk were awards from his time working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation, a framed letter from the Minister of Magic thanking him for his service (on which, Harry noticed gleefully, Weasley was spelled incorrectly), certificates for each O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. exam he passed, and his Head Boy and Prefect badges.
“Oliver told me what you said, and I can’t have an assistant who is going to undermine me in any way.” Percy crossed his arms. “I’ll be writing to the Auror Department to explain your departure, and to tell them that you do not have my recommendation for auror qualification.”
“What the hell?” he muttered.
(212). Draco could have made the remarks quietly to his classmates, but he wanted to make sure Harry heard, because he needed to make sure that Harry would never get the wrong idea about his feelings. And lucky for Draco, Harry is an absolute idiot. Later, when Harry and Ron are in the Slytherin common room Draco makes fun of Colin Creevey by making fun of Harry and it’s obvious that it’s something that he does regularly.
And then Harry blew caution to the wind, and gave into his desire since sixth year and kissed Draco.  The waitress smiled from behind the counter as she rang up their bill. She’d been watching their interactions for years, and she was so glad they had finally figured their shit out.
“He’s not my boyfriend anymore.” A muscle in Draco’s cheek twitched as he replied. “I broke up with him. Or he broke up with me. It all happened very fast a few weeks ago when I walked into his house and Percy---” He stopped suddenly. Harry’s face was full of rage, and he knew he had said too much.
“Oh right, because Improper Use of Magic is just integral to wizarding society, how dare I forget?” Oliver said, sarcasm evident. He leaned against the edge of the lift, desperately hoping his comment would shut Percy up.  He was quickly proven wrong.
“Potter, please do remember we’re under an invisibility cloak,” Draco whispered whilst elbowing Harry in the ribs lightly. Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed Draco’s arm so that they could exit The Leaky Cauldron under the invisibility cloak and then re-enter without it.  It would be far too suspicious for them to suddenly appear at a booth that had been empty for nearly an hour.
“What are you doing here?” Draco directed the question at both of them.
“I did that as a favor,” Harry grumbled. He turned towards Neville for support and discovered that he had left him alone with Draco during the argument.
This chapter brought to you by 5 white claws, 1 beer, a thai iced tea, a Celtics win in Game 5, singing Betty by Taylor Swift, general exasperation at our dweebdom, and learning the definition of the word "simp/simping"
“Careful, if I didn’t know any better, I just might think The Boy Who Lived was uncomfortable with the gay community,” Draco said, staring into Harry’s eyes with an edge of superiority.
The referee blew her whistle, signaling the start of the game, and released the bludgers, snitch, and quaffle. Ginny made her move, and grabbed the quaffle first. She streaked through the air with her fellow chasers flanking on either side. She scored. Then several minutes later the Harpies scored again.
“Harry was just about to tell me that when you interrupted,” Hermione told Ron. She put her hands on his shoulders and kissed his cheek. “Please, continue, Harry.”
“Well, Potter, as our assistants, you and Mr. Malfoy here, are going to find us the perfect place to live.” Percy explained.
“I hope this doesn’t take long,” Draco grumbled.
“Honestly, I don’t know.” Harry said, fiddling with his napkin. “Being an auror has been my dream since I was 14. Granted, some of that drive is fueled by a need to prove Umbridge wrong,” Harry laughed a bit to himself before becoming subdued,  “but I still can’t really imagine a scenario when I’m not out saving the day.”
Harry stood up, and without thinking, he removed his Weasley sweater. The process was a lot less coordinated than Harry would have liked because he was still drunk from the party. He hastily pulled down the corner of his button-down that had started to ride up when he took off his sweater, but not before Draco caught a glimpse. Draco swallowed.
“Draco,” Neville pointed towards one side of the path. “The mallowsweet you were looking for should be over there. Harry and I will go this way to see if we can find the newts that I need.”
Percy felt the lift lurch, groan, and then stop. He wanted to groan along with it, but he knew that would be completely undignified. One must always maintain the facade of calm when faced with adversity.  He would never continue to rise through the ranks of the Ministry if he let small things bother him.  Though, his former classmate in the lift with him was certainly testing this conviction.  Percy took a deep breath and channeled what he thought was an incredibly even voice,
“Golden Snitch.” Harry muttered.  Instantly what had appeared to be merely a stone wall melted away into a somewhat ornate wooden door.  Harry reached for the door handle and walked into his new ‘home.’  The room consisted of a sitting area, a desk, and a large four poster bed.  There was a small door to his right that he assumed was for the en suite. The floors were a dark polished wood with a deep red plush carpet with matching arm chairs in the sitting area.  There was a small fireplace and overall the room was warm and everything you’d expect a former Gryffindor student turned professor to want for themselves.  Too bad it only made Harry feel more empty and alone. Memories of hanging out with Ginny in the Gryffindor Common Room swirled to the surface. Fighting Voldemort hadn’t been easy by any stretch of the imagination, but somehow that time had been easier than this.  He’d fight off a hundred dark lords if it would bring back Ginny. Or remove the issue that landed him at Hogwarts instead of the Aurors Office in the first place.
“Didn’t you once tell me that misery loves company?”
“Before you go,” Harry called out. “Are there any other openings?”
He walked a few blocks away from the Ministry and apparated to Cormac’s front door.  Draco reached for the ridiculously ostentatious door knocker. He never understood why Cormac insisted on having these ornately carved broomsticks on his front door. He rapped three times and waited. The door swung open, and Draco was disappointed to see that it was McLaggen’s house elf.
“What really brought you to Hogwarts?” McGonagall asked pointedly, her glasses slipping down her nose slightly.  “Clearly, it wasn’t just for the flying, otherwise you wouldn’t have come to my office.”
“I have a good time with you,” Davies continued when it was clear that Harry was not going to say anything. “But I don’t think I’m ready to make that kind of commitment.”
Harry ran his hands through his hair, which he hadn’t bothered to cut in quite awhile. “Fine,” Harry answered. “I’ll be the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.”
A glint of something white near one of the trees caught Harry’s eye, and he turned to Neville giving him a questioning stare. Neville ignored him and waved toward the tree.
(125).
Much like Chamber of Secrets, there is one line that is constantly referenced as proof of Drarry:
“GryffinDORK, you mean,” Draco said, the only thing giving away his anger was the way his eyes briefly flamed. “Besides, I’m not overly concerned about what my father would think considering he died in Azkaban several months ago.”
“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Draco waved him off dismissively. “You and Ginny can both tell me ‘I told you so.’”
“I hope you learned more than
, they’re not going to want me there.”
was the right sort of man for her.” Draco leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms behind his head.
Oliver and Percy started animatedly discussing Quidditch and barely noticed that another twenty minutes went by.
******************
“Harry!” she exclaimed. “You’re not just getting home from work now, are you? We were worried but it wouldn’t have been the first time you slept in the office. Send an owl next time, or something, honestly.”
“Right, right,” Percy said distractedly, still admiring the flowers on his desk. “While you’re with Mr. Malfoy, can you have him tell Oliver I won’t be available for our dinner this evening, something else has come up.”  This surprised Harry, which is something that Percy rarely ever accomplished.
“We’re both facing a lot of...pressure, at work,” Draco began. “And I think that we could use some time off. Not that Wood or the Work Weasel will let us. But hear me out...what if we were able to distract them?”
“I’m really just hoping it might cause enough brain damage for me to reasonably quit.” Harry responded, lifting his head up and tilting it back against the chair.
******************
“No, honestly,” Harry said. “I’m just here to watch. I haven’t played Quidditch in a decade.”
“I’m drunk, I think.” Harry said when he stumbled over the rocky path.
“We’re messing with their lives, Malfoy! It was one thing when it was a date here or there so that we could have some time off, but helping them move in together when they don’t even like each other…that’s just not right.”
“Potter, this is utterly ridiculous.” Draco said, as Harry bopped his head and moved his arms about in a chaotic fashion. Draco stepped out of Harry’s reach and raised his eyebrow at Harry.
Harry screamed in agony, and Ginny instinctively turned in his direction.  When she noticed that Harry was down and barely conscious, she changed course and started to run toward him, firing spells as she went.  The last thing that Harry saw before everything faded to black was a spell knocking into Ginny’s side. She crumpled to the ground with his name on her lips.
“Why are you working for Percy if you want to be an auror?” Draco asked suddenly.
Second Seeker: Cho Chang. This one is a lot more obvious because he spends half the book mooning over her. But I will be fair to Cho Chang and include a few excerpts of canonical proof that Harry was into her. He starts off by embarrassing himself at the World Cup when he sees her
******************
"Call your own patronus."
Draco clenched and unclenched his fists, pressed the button to go back up to the Atrium and said, “Whatever you say,
He could do this. He defeated Lord Voldemort and saved the entire wizarding world, surely he could handle a few third years. But, by the end of the week, Harry would have much rather faced a dark wizard than teach another group of teenagers ever again.
(645).
“She might surprise you,” Harry said. “I could always put in a good word if you wanted me to…”
“Thank Merlin,” the bartender muttered under his breath as he caught sight of his savior for the Savior walking up to the bar stools.
Harry watched with pride as Ginny continued to lead the way. She was unstoppable. The crowd roared in support.  Harry recalled his sixth year when he and Ginny first got together after a Quidditch match, and began to daydream about using a Harpies victory today as a catalyst for asking her out again and rekindling that relationship.  Harry was distracted by this fantasy, it took him a moment to notice that the sun, which had been shining brightly in a cloudless sky all afternoon, was shrouded in darkness.
“No, it
The waitress efficiently wrote down the order and walked away as Harry gave Draco a piercing glance.
Oliver looked up from his desk at the word Quidditch. “About what?”
“I told you it was going to take them till this wedding to sort their shit out.”
(361)
******************
“This isn’t over, Potter,” he spat. And then he swept from the Great Hall praying to Merlin that he wouldn’t trip on his way out.
“He asked me to marry him, Harry!” Hermione shouted, coming around the corner and flashing a sparkly diamond in his face. Harry, who was in the middle of taking a sip of firewhiskey, began to splutter.
“There’s nothing to fix with Potter. We only became friends because of this whole setting up our bosses thing. And since that’s clearly not happening anymore…” Draco trailed off. “Besides, he is convinced that I’m the same person I was at seventeen and I may have told him to never speak to me again.”
Curiously, Harry chooses to finally make his move on Ginny in their common room after she successfully won a Quidditch match as a seeker. And now, back to your regularly scheduled programming.
“Yes, of course Miss Headmistress, Tilly will be taking care of that for the Great Harry Potter.” The little elf stared wide-eyed at Harry until McGonagall cleared her throat, prompting Tilly back into action.  She grabbed his trunk and bag and left McGonagall’s office with a loud pop. Harry shifted awkwardly, his leg hurt from carrying the trunk and he wasn’t really interested in small talk.
Along the same vibe of Malfoy constantly making fun of Harry, at Christmas:
Harry slid his now empty glass over and motioned for a refill. The bartender reluctantly filled it, it was The Harry Potter after all, but he kept peering at the door as if he was waiting for someone to come into the now empty bar.  Harry, who had been drinking since early evening, was too busy ranting about his students to the bubbles in his freshly poured glass to notice. However, the sudden bang of the old and tacky door being opened caught Harry’s attention.
“Good. And while you’re at it, I’d consider thinking about what you
“That, Harry, my boy, is what taking a calculated risk is all about! You’ll keep this between the two of us.” Without confirming, Harry grabbed his coat from his desk and grumbled to himself for the entire trek to the open house.
“Cool,” Cormac said, reaching for a piece of toast. Draco thought he caught a smile flit across Cormac’s face. “The elf will be thrilled, you know she loves cooking for two.”
“Nothing like an ice cold beer to take the edge off a rough work week, eh?”
“Very subtle, Potter.” Draco said, but he walked over to him anyway. After a few minutes Draco waved Harry over. “I think you might remember, Roger Davies, from Hogwarts.”
Having this information made Harry rethink his Hogwarts years through a new lens. He thought about how often he would check his Marauder’s Map looking for Draco’s name, how he followed him through Knockturn Alley and on the Hogwarts Express, and his constant need to prove that he was a competent wizard around Draco.
“Oh, that,” Oliver brushed it off. “That’s nothing. He told me about that. He’s been meeting with Cormac for a work related project. Maybe it’s above your pay grade. Thanks for looking out for me, Harry, but I’m good.”
Early on in the book, Draco is proud and pleased with his new role as a Death Eater. He hints at how important he is when he’s on the Hogwarts Express.  He’s confident and unconcerned about the consequences of his potential failures. His mother cries to Snape,
“Very good. I have a Transfiguration class to teach, so please take a biscuit and I trust you’ll be able to find your way out.”  McGonagall stood and walked towards the door.

******************
On the surface this is just Harry Potter dealing with some jealousy and disappointment that Cho Chang doesn’t like him back. But we’re in this for Drarry, and so we must reinterpret lines (without ruining their integrity, of course). So, I shall propose this interpretation: maybe Harry is upset about Cho Chang. But maybe he is also upset about it specifically being Cedric Diggory dancing with her. And perhaps, him wanting to kick something has more to do with the fact that part of him knows he’s attracted to Cedric and that frustrates him.
Before we dive into Draco and Harry specific scenes, I think it’s important to look at the three redemption arcs that will make up the backbone to the redemption arc that Draco should receive in a post-canon world.
******************
“In here?” Harry asked, looking towards the waitress, and shook his head.   He reached absentmindedly for the uneaten piece of toast on Draco’s plate. “I never understand why you don’t get butter on your toast. We both know you love the stuff.”
“Oh come on, Malfoy let him come. You don’t have to play, Harry,” Ginny turned to him. “But I think watching some Quidditch and being outside would be good for you. Get your mind off Hottie for a little while.”
Ginny smiled in response and disappeared into Pansy’s room. When she emerged a few minutes later she was wearing her Quidditch gear and holding her broomstick. “Harry, you should come too!”
******************
“Do you, err, want to go to Ron and Hermione’s wedding with me?” Harry spluttered. “Just as friends, I know you’re with McLaggen and all. But I had fun when we hung out in a not-work setting before, and I got the impression that you did too, so I thought maybe…”
******************
“That’s quite alright,” Draco shrugged. “I was a last minute invitation.”
“First, you’re going to tell Weasley all about Wood’s accomplishments and how important he is in the MInistry.” Draco explained. “Do it casually. It also probably wouldn’t hurt if you mentioned that he can get free tickets to just about any Quidditch match.”
“You can pay me in acid pops for my problem solving services.” Ginny smiled smugly. “Well, what are you waiting for?”
I referenced
"Sort of," Neville motioned towards one of the vials. "I got enough for one dose but then your yelling interrupted me."
Over the next few days, whenever Draco and Harry had time to spare (which was not often), they would send paper memos to each other trying to work out the ideal time to send their bosses to the lift. Harry could always tell if it was a note from Draco because he had a habit of charming them into paper cranes instead of planes.
“That’s not really one of my strengths.” Draco mused.
Harry wanted to protest, or perhaps even punch Malfoy in the face just because, but he could think of no excuse quickly enough.  Resigned to the fact his schoolyard nemesis now knew his deepest secret, he merely glared.
The biggest moment for Harry, emotionally, is after he and Cho have their very wet kiss in the Room of Requirement. As expected, Hermione is there to sort things out for Harry:
“Go ahead, Potter,” Draco said, covering his blush with the menu. “I’m all ears.”
I’m not going to sit here and suggest that Draco Malfoy is innocent and didn’t say and do terrible things in the name of purebloods. He did, and I won’t deny it. But one of the cool things about human nature is that we can change and grow as we become exposed to additional world views. Draco probably never even saw a muggleborn until he went to Hogwarts, and so he would have believed every nasty thing his parents had ever said about them because he didn’t have any reason not to. Then he gets to Hogwarts and he realizes that muggleborns are smart. And half-bloods are good at Quidditch. And maybe purebloods aren’t inherently better just because of their blood status. By the end of the books, Draco Malfoy has started to show some remorse. I will analyze the specific events later in the essay. But I will offer this brief example to get your empathy juices flowing:
Mr. Weasley may not always understand muggle things, but he isn’t an idiot. He can see what Harry isn’t able to see yet: Harry is obsessed with Draco, and he doth protest too much.
“Maybe it’s not one of the three emotions you’re capable of feeling Potter, but I was embarrassed!” Draco yelled back. “Do you have any idea how much it sucked to find out that the person you thought you were dating would rather date A WEASLEY than you because of the optics? I didn’t want to talk about it, and I didn’t think that it would matter.”
“When there’s Quidditch scouting reports, broom research, AND a brand new chasing formation to explore?  Yes, yes there is a reason to be a bit impatient about being trapped in a bloody lift in the Ministry!” Oliver exclaimed.  Percy was clearly just as uptight as he had been in Hogwarts.  They’d barely been stopped a full minute and he was already complaining.
Once again, Draco Malfoy goes out of his way to find Harry’s compartment on the Hogwarts Express. He waits for Harry to get off the train just to make fun of Harry for fainting on the train. It was information he heard secondhand, but he had to bring it to Harry because he desperately wanted some interaction. Later, Draco does some idiot teenage boy stuff to show off, and ends up getting attacked by Buckbeak. After he’s released from the hospital wing and goes to Potions class this scene occurs:
“Or what, Potter?” Draco and Harry were inches from each other, Harry’s arm blocking any chance for Draco to escape. Harry felt like the temperature in the hospital wing had risen significantly in the past few minutes, sweat beading on his forehead.
“Yeah, yeah, I get it. I’ll shower and cease all brooding activities.” Harry laughed and began to get up off of the couch.
“Ever a man of many words, Potter,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “As I said, I assure you the potion is brewed to exact qualifications required,” Draco continued even as Harry seemed to want to interrupt, “and it is absolutely not poisoned. Had I known it was for you however…”
This chapter brought to you by an embarrassing amount of sobriety, the Celtics winning game 3, and the phrase "f*ck it, it's 2020!"
******************
“But…”
"What is wrong with you two?" Neville said as his patronus circled back to rest on his shoulder. "You've probably woken the entire forest up with your screaming!"
“It doesn’t matter,” Draco replied. “Thanks for paying me back though.”
"Madame Pomfrey asked me to deliver this potion as soon as it was finished brewing." Draco motioned to the goblet in his hand. "You're lucky that I didn't spill any of it when you ran into me. It's very important."
“Never you mind that,” Draco waved it off. “Isn’t this your stop?” And he gave Harry a little shove out of the gate.
“You sounded a bit like Hermione for a second there,” Harry muttered. Draco took a swig of his beer in response, and looked down at the inkblot forming on his report.
“I am always the picture of poise.” Ron responded with confidence.
But this book isn’t all about Draco.  Near the end of the book, when they make the announcement about the mandrakes and everyone starts cheering, Harry makes it a point to look over at Draco Malfoy when he should just be celebrating with his fellow Gryffindors.
“We aren’t lying, though.” Draco reasoned. “What has gotten into you? You didn’t have a problem with setting them up before.”
“You’re aware that there are a lot of tests you have to take to become an auror, right?” Harry swallowed some of his chicken tikka masala. “Most of them are practical and written exams, but there are a few that are more like personality evaluations. I was doing fine. But then the Department decided that I was too hot headed and could be a liability because of  an ‘unprecedented need to save everyone on my own without any consideration of the consequences’. I don’t see what’s wrong with saving everyone.”
“I WAS SEVENTEEN!” Draco exclaimed. “You have no idea what it was like for me back then, and I’m not going to have this conversation with you right now when there are witnesses.” He motioned to the entrance to the kitchen where the estate agent was waiting patiently. He composed himself before turning to her.
“Long day at the office, Draco?” she had asked, as the faint beat of techno music could be heard from Pansy’s bedroom. Draco couldn’t remember the specifics of the conversation, but he remembered complaining about Oliver Wood, lamenting the lack of time he was able to spend with Cormac, and asking if Pansy had a girl over (which she usually did). Pansy was uncharacteristically coy in her response and it dawned on Draco then, and also now, that there had really only been one girl other than Pansy occupying their flat over the last few months.
“Anyway,” Hermione eyed Ron, daring him to interrupt her again, “Ron and I have come a long way from our first year.  And we appreciate you all being here for us for the last decade.  We cannot wait to share our special day with you tomorrow.”
Draco does a lot of eye catching and smirking in this book. He also, as always, inserts himself into Harry Potter’s conversations as frequently as possible because he just wants to interact with Harry in some way.  Just like in Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, Draco makes it a point to know as much about Harry Potter as possible--he knows about Sirius Black being an animagus now (and proceeds to taunt and inadvertently warn Harry about this knowledge), and he knows that Hagrid spent the summer in the mountains with some giants (a fact he goes out of his way to tell Harry).  He inexplicably shows up to Gryffindor Quidditch practice even though no other Quidditch team does that, and he leads the mocking. He also makes eye contact with Harry during their Charms O.W.L:
“Harry, duck!” he heard a familiar voice cry from behind him. He followed the instructions as a curse flew over his head.
“You always were one for the dramatics, Draco. Luckily for you, Gin is a genius and can get you out of this hole you’ve dug yourself.” Pansy said, grabbing Ginny’s hand and squeezing.
“Good for you! I’m glad you’re finally getting laid.” Ron clapped and Hermione hit him with a pillow.
“Draco, you and I both know we were casually dating at best,” Draco almost interrupted but Cormac blazed on, “and I have a reputation to think of.  Shacking up with a former Death Eater from one of the most disgraced families in the wizarding world? Surely you had to know I wasn’t serious.  Percy comes from a family of war heroes. He’s quite well-off and is a respected member of the Ministry. You understand, right?”
‘I’m sorry.’ Draco whispered, loud enough for Harry to turn towards him in a mixture of anger and shock.
‘I just hope it’s worth it,’ Blaise’s words made Draco freeze. ‘I just hope everything you’re losing out on is worth it Draco.’
Harry’s brow furrowed at the kindness in Snape’s voice, it seemed out of place and he had never heard the man speak in such a gentle way.
The leader moved forward, ‘we have Harry Potter.’
‘Well what’s he like?’ Hermione pestered as Harry got out of bed and stretched his arms behind him.
‘Probably,’ Ron agreed.
‘This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince.’
As the realisation that Draco had purposely tricked Harry in following him here dawned upon him, he stumbled backwards, away from sight. Harry was beginning to realise how his obsession was slowly festering inside of him now, a hive within him becoming more and more active with every interaction he shared with Draco. He despised this feeling and he despised Draco too. The embarrassment mingled with the cold air made his face flame scarlet as he retreated back to the quidditch fields.
As an unfamiliar Slytherin student was walking into the crowded carriage reserved for sixth years, Harry quickly slipped past him. He moved towards an empty area where no one was seated and upon scanning the carriage, Harry easily located Draco ahead of him. He was seated amongst people Harry recognised as his supposed friends: Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and Vincent Crabbe.
Just in case anyone didn't catch it, the reference to Draco wearing red at the end was supposed to indicate how brave it was for him to step down from the ledge :(
‘Well,’ Ginny replied, a small smile dancing on her lips. ‘It’s not bleeding anymore so yes.’
Freezing in place, Draco’s eyes began to dart all around them as if he had just realised where exactly he was. He was no longer trapped in the manor surrounded by people who disgusted him, but he was outside, breathing the freshest air he had breathed in a long time. To the side of Harry and him were Ron and Hermione, closer to the shore. Ron was rocking Hermione back and forth, desperately trying to calm her as Dobby stood nearby looking rather hesitant. On the other side of their figures stood the sea, raging back and forth against the grey sky. Either way Draco looked was free of any constraint, free of anyone or anything that would again confine him. And in front of him stood Harry who hadn’t ended up hating Draco for the decisions he had made.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘It’s perfect Mr Malfoy!’
‘Hey Potter, is it true what the rumours have been saying?’ Cormac questioned, his eyes glazing over Harry in a way that seemed almost predatory.
‘Can anyone tell me what you think each of these potions may be?’ Slughorn asked enthusiastically, looking from student to student.
Harry only shrugged, ‘I’m winging it.’
‘So that’s what he meant…’ Ron muttered under his breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
As Draco hesitated, Harry grabbed onto his hand and guided it towards Dobby’s figure. His parents both looked at them with widened eyes as his aunt became hysterical.
Harry wanted to scream in frustration as Cormac McLaggen with his signature smug expression made his way towards Harry, his narcissistic ramblings already ready to slip from his mouth.
Cormac, however, was clearly angered by Ron’s performance and as his turn came, he settled himself onto his broom with determination swallowing his figure. As he knocked the bludger with a precise force, Harry couldn’t deny that Cormac was indeed a talented keeper, perhaps even better than Ron. But Harry wanted nothing more than to avoid inviting Cormac onto the team. He could only hope that Cormac would slip up, enough to allow room for Harry to defend his decision for giving Ron the keeper position.
‘Taking a detour into such a place as Knockturn Alley wasn’t such a wise thing to do for someone like you.’
Draco’s voice, however, was anything but gentle. ‘I’m working just fine on my own. I don’t need your concern or anyone else’s.’
‘Well well, look at what we have here!’ One of them exclaimed, a buoyant looking man dressed in mismatched clothing. ‘Grab them!’
‘Yes, but you’re going to be trying out against Ron, so the position isn’t guaranteed yours.’ Harry sternly said.
‘Slughorn wanted to see me, so I got caught up and tripped trying to make it to the platform in time.’ Harry lied, knowing there were significant gaps in the flimsy excuse he had just conjured up.
‘Everyone!’ Harry burst out, ‘his damn father, Voldemort – ‘
‘You told me not to save you, I know.’ Harry whispered, ‘but for some reason, the universe brought me to the manor today. It brought me there to save you Draco, so let me keep saving you, please.’
Before either of them could make a move, they were all grasped by different, gruff-looking death eaters. Harry didn’t recognise any of them except one, the man holding Hermione was one he recognised very well. Fenrir Greyback, the ruthless, infamous werewolf.
‘It’s not about the damn cabinet Hermione, it’s the shop the cabinet was in!’ Harry’s tone increased in desperation as he tried to convince his friends.
‘Yes, indeed this is a curious little potion, Felix Felicis, commonly known as Liquid Luck. One drop and the taker is the luckiest person in that moment, gearing on the edge of being successful in whatever they do.’ Slughorn explained, ‘and it seems like you’re all in luck ladies and gentlemen, for whoever in the next hour brews a perfect draft of Living Death will receive one vial. I hope that should be your motivation to work hard this lesson.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Why the hell are you here Malfoy?’
‘Harry’s forming some kind of conspiracy- ‘
‘Shit!’
Like always, Draco was running away from him again, desperate to escape the heated attention he couldn’t afford. This time, Harry followed him into the corridor, knowing he was only escalating his problems as his friend’s watched him leave. But for some reason, this recklessness was difficult to control.
Before any further questions could be roused, Harry called for keeper tryouts to begin. He walked away from Cormac as if being within the same vicinity as him would make him into the same blubbering mess of nerves that Ron currently was. To Harry’s relief, Ron was playing better than he had expected, defending the rings as if he had just consumed a cauldron full of Felix Felicis. Even though he had promised to be objective in his judgement, Harry couldn’t control the ovations that bubbled up his throat every time Ron knocked the bludger’s away.
‘Vernon Dudley.’
Before either of them could process Hermione’s words, the sound of voices could be heard from the outside of the tent. Harry immediately knew who they belonged too, the snatchers had found them, and it was all his fault. As he turned to his friends in panic, Harry was met with the sight of Hermione’s wand tip in his face before a searing flush spread across his face and made him gasp.
‘Hm, what did you say?’ Draco – to Harry’s relief – turned his attention towards the raven-haired girl.
if anyone is interested, the poem Harry quoted is The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot. It's my favourite poem so i really wanted to feature it since it also inspired the title <3
‘I didn’t fancy getting in trouble on the first night back.’ Draco replied immediately, his answer seemed already rehearsed and ready.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Goblin,’ he said curtly, ‘come closer to the door. The rest of you stand back, I don’t want to hurt anyone.’
‘Shut up Zabini.’ Ron said on his behalf and pulled Harry along with him.
‘Something or someone?’
Ron sat up in one swift motion, ‘did you hear anything?’
‘Harry?’
‘Yeah,’ Ron added, walking till he was next to his girlfriend. ‘I’ve thought about things a lot, you know, all this stuff with you and Malfoy and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around it. I know somehow you’ve come to like him, but the state you’re in right now, I just don’t get how it’s all over a death eater who terrorised us for five years.’
Harry decided not to go back to his office right away. He didn’t know if he could face Percy right now, so he wandered around for half an hour before making his way back to his desk. When he got there, he found that his desk had been mostly cleared out and all of his personal effects were in a cardboard box.
A week later, Harry was sitting in the parlor when the fireplace roared to life and was filled with the green fire of floo travel. Professor McGonagall stepped out, and brushed some soot off of her emerald robes.
Harry let out a deep sigh and closed his eyes.  He didn’t remember falling asleep,
“Oh good,” Percy said bluntly, when he noticed Harry was back. “I took the liberty of starting to clean out your desk for you since you won’t be needing it anymore. You’re no longer my assistant. I’m firing you.”
“Well, anyway,” Harry said, backing out of the room. “As lovely as this chat was, I better get back to the report I needed to write for Percy, otherwise I’ll never get to leave this hell hole.” And with that, Harry strode down the hallway towards the lift leaving Draco with his thoughts about how this was the second night in a row that he had a relatively civil conversation with Harry Potter that didn’t end with a hex.
“What’s going on?” Harry’s voice started to come back. “Where’s Ginny? Why am I trapped in this bed?” He shifted his left leg slightly, but this caused him agonizing pain and he cried out. “SOMEBODY. TELL ME. WHAT. HAPPENED. NOW.”
“Well,” Harry said, finishing his drink. “I don’t usually drink on the job. Besides, that wasn’t the test that I had a problem with anyway. But speaking of drinks, I need another.”
“You dolt, they’re both reds. I should’ve known better than to ask you. You probably had never expanded your palette beyond firewhiskey before I took you out in Diagon Alley. I’ll give him the Pinot. I have more of it at my flat and I prefer Cabernet anyway.”
“I know just the place.” Draco smirked, as he strode toward the doors of the exit of the Ministry. Harry, having paused in confusion at Draco’s confidence in a restaurant, had to sprint to catch up to him.
"Malfoy made this?" Harry stared at the swirling liquid. Madame Pomfrey, sensing an argument was about to escalate and realizing she was too old for the typical Potter and Malfoy antics, ignored Harry’s question and quickly made her way to her office.
had overheard him talking about getting stuck in the lift last week and he spoke very highly of the gentleman that was stuck in there with him. He was very impressed, and dare I say,
Harry had owled McGonagall as soon as Ginny left.  The now headmistress quickly replied that of course Harry was welcome at any time and he could drop by at his leisure so long as he didn’t disturb any lessons. Harry, after showering as Ginny had requested, grabbed his Firebolt 3 and apparated to Hogsmeade.  The walk from the village to the castle gave Harry some time to clear his head. The air was crisp and cool, giving him a sense of clarity he never would’ve gotten cooped up in Grimmauld Place.  When he finally reached the gates, he immediately made a course straight for the Quidditch pitch.  A few laps around the goal posts would do him good.
“I’ll have a Cosmopolitan,” Percy said. He had recently watched some muggle television and was very intrigued by this beverage.
"Wait."
“Harry,” Hermione started before bursting into tears. Ron buried his head in his hands. Harry tried to reach out to comfort them, but discovered that his arms and legs had been magically restrained  to the sides of the bed by what appeared to be thick leather belts.
Draco and Harry were too busy trading insults with each other and draining their goblets to notice that McGonagall had dismissed the students, and the Great Hall was empty except for them and a few ghosts that were still milling around. They also didn’t notice that McGonagall was now standing in front of them with her arms crossed with a stony expression on her face.
“Seriously, Harry? Yeah sure, maybe Malfoy isn’t the 100% upstanding citizen you thought he was, but everyone is entitled to lapses in judgement. AND even if what he did was as egregious as you’re making it out to be in your own mind, is that really a good enough reason to lament on your couch for days?” Ginny grabbed his shoulder and forced him to turn back toward her. “Come on, Harry Potter, where is that Gryffindor bravery?”
“I’m actually just leaving,” Harry stuck his head in. “I have an appointment with Draco for a potential house for you and Oliver.”
Harry explained that Percy had plans last night, so he was able to get away from work earlier than usual and went out to a bar where he met…
. Narcissa makes it clear that she knows the real reason that Draco was tasked with this impossible challenge--it isn’t to prove his worth or because he’s exceptional like Draco would like to believe, it’s punishment. Lord Voldemort intends for Draco to die, but it’s not until part of the way through the year that I think this actually starts to sink in. Subconsciously, Draco finds the line that he is unwilling to cross for Voldemort, and this is the first step for him to become disillusioned with the Death Eater movement and move towards the redemption arc that he rightfully deserves.
“You know it goes against everything I stand for to agree with you, Malfoy” Harry said, placing his hands on Draco’s wrist and leaning in. “But, I think this might be a brilliant plan.”
Then there’s the whole dragon thing. Malfoy’s obsession becomes apparent when he’s listening in on Harry’s conversation and he risks punishment by sneaking out just to catch Harry Potter with a dragon. Meanwhile, Harry is so distracted by his thoughts of Malfoy that he forgets his invisibility cloak and gets a detention.
“More qualified for what?” Harry asked, still not understanding where McGonagall was going.  McGonagall pursed her lips.
“I guess,” Harry shrugged. “It just feels like last names are so impersonal... for people you’re acquaintances with or don’t particularly like, and I thought that we’d reached the point where we were actually, maybe, friends. I wasn’t wrong about that, was I?”
”  Harry hoped that the delivery of this report would mean he could leave for the day, but he should’ve known better by this point.
He hadn’t seen Harry around the office, so he assumed that he had told Oliver at least part of the situation and was following Draco’s request to cease communication.  It was all making itself out to be an absolutely dreadful week. He was greeted with a loud pop when he entered the living room.
“I believe I mentioned that my father died in Azkaban, yes?” Draco pushed his food around with his fork. “The Ministry took a lot of our fortune as retribution for our crimes. And the Malfoy name does not go nearly as far as it used to. The job with Oliver was the only one that I could get that wasn’t a complete embarrassment. I’ve always fancied going back to Hogwarts to teach Potions but I doubt McGonagall would give me a job.”
“Uh, Harry,” Neville looked at Harry and then Draco. “Do you want to switch seats with me so you can continue having this conversation without me being stuck in the middle?”
to be Christmas.” Harry responded sternly. “Ron cornered me when I got home last night.  HIs mum is insisting that I come for Christmas dinner and the engagement party they specifically planned for that night. They figured if both events were at the same time, that it would be easier for me to attend.  I’ve missed pretty much every Weasley family gathering since I started working for Percy, so I need to be there.”
By the time Harry walked into the terraced home, his mood had not improved at all. If anything, he was even grumpier than before. Now, instead of just being mad at Percy for being a prick (which, Harry had to admit, was par for the course), he had also worked himself into being mad at Draco. He hadn’t figured out how, but he knew this was all Draco’s fault.
“The diner,” Harry bit his lip uncomfortably.
Draco stuffed the chipped kettle back into his pocket. Portkey travel sucked. And it sucked even worse when it was pouring rain and your boss insisted you expend your efforts keeping
“Better work on those seeker reflexes, Potter.” Draco taunted as the doors finished closing and the lift shot off.
Ron was beaming at the head of the altar with Harry and George to his left.  Harry wasn’t sure he had ever seen his best friend so unabashedly happy.  Ginny and Luna looked beautiful as they walked down the aisle and took their places on the right side of the altar.  Hermione and her father, memory restored after months of her research on memory charms, began to walk down the aisle as well.
“I’m glad you were able to figure it out,” he said, pocketing the money.
At half past two, Harry decided it was time to head out.  He gathered up that morning’s Prophet and skimmed through the first few pages until he got to the sports column.  Oliver Wood, his old Quidditch Captain, was working as the Senior Quidditch Correspondent these days, as well as running a Quidditch Supply Store in Diagon Alley.  Harry could always count on Wood to give a brutally honest forecast of an upcoming Quidditch match.  He imagined that the Quidditch-focused manic energy Wood had when he was at Hogwarts had only increased in the years following.
Drarry may not be your ship of choice, and that’s understandable. Not every ship is for everybody. But I do think that Drarry has its merits and that it’s a very plausible ship. Do not pity the dead, my friends. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without Drarry.
“Sure did,” Pansy nodded. “My girl here talked some sense into him. She didn’t tell him to quit his job though, I’m not sure why he thought that was a good idea.”
Harry Potter started expressing concern for Draco at the end of Half Blood Prince, and his worry continues throughout Deathly Hallows. He has a vision of Malfoy Manor and wakes up from it with,
“You Gryffindors and your sentimentality,” Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling. “I suppose we are friends...Harry. I’ll consider your offer. It’s not a yes yet, but it’s not necessarily a no.”
The second story of redemption is Regulus Black.  I brought him up earlier as an example of why Draco would be too afraid to stand up to his family, since he didn’t know the truth of Regulus’s death and would have come to the same conclusion (that he tried to back out and Voldemort killed him as a result) as Remus and Sirius.  But Regulus did much more than that. He saw the evil that Voldemort was doing and wanted to end it. Sure, he went along with it for a while, but when it affected him personally (with Kreacher), he decided he needed to try to stop Voldemort. He was a 17 or 18-year-old who was in too deep with the Dark Arts, but changed his mind and wanted to stop Voldemort as best as he could. His story is incredibly similar to Draco’s: wealthy Slytherin home, certain expectations about supporting Voldemort, doesn’t comprehend the severity of Voldemort’s actions until he witnesses it firsthand with his family. Once again, Hermione comes in with a nugget of insight when she says
Hermione brushed imaginary lint off Harry’s coat for what felt like the thousandth time.  “I’m quite sure you’ve gotten anything that might be lingering there, Hermione.”  Harry barely managed to suppress rolling his eyes.
(71).  You might try to pass this off as just an objective description of Cedric Diggory, but then we hear Harry’s actual thoughts:
“Percy was only dating you because Harry and I planned it. We set everything up from the beginning because we were both exhausted and wanted to be able to have social lives of our own. It wasn’t supposed to be anything serious, and maybe that’s why we were okay with it before but now….Oliver,” Draco turned his head so he was looking directly at Oliver when he spoke. “You’ve been my boss for years, and I’m incredibly grateful that you gave me a chance when nobody else would. And even though you apparently lack the ability to tell when your employees are being overworked, you still deserve to be with somebody who
Harry managed to get through the ticket line and up to his seats without any issue. He saw a few of his former classmates as he made his way up the stands and exchanged pleasantries with them. An air horn broke through the chatter. Everyone stopped milling around and hurried to take their seats.
the potions master at this school, I would be the most qualified." Draco explained. He was pleased to see that this seemed to impress Harry slightly. "And, it's a highly sensitive potion. Only a few professors know about it. You probably aren't one of them."
“Well, that’s incredibly offensive,” Draco sneered. “You testified at my hearing years ago, surely you believed what you said. Or is the great Harry Potter harboring some prejudices and unable to accept that people can change?”
“Nothing definite,” Harry said, looking around with his drink in his hand. “I suppose if I’m charming enough tonight, maybe I’ll find somebody here.”
He remembered coming back to the flat he shared with Pansy distracted because he was replaying the conversation he had had with Potter as he walked back from the office after working late. He remembered sitting down on the couch and summoning a bottle of wine and two glasses, pouring one for himself and one for Pansy who was already sitting nearby.
“Can I get you two lovebirds anything to eat?” she asked.
“We’re going into the Forbidden Forest with
“Well, if we’re both stuck waiting at least a little longer, might as well order another round.” Oliver finished his drink and eyed Percy’s half full glass speculatively.  “If you finish that drink in one go, I’ll buy you your next one.”
Chapter 4: Say It Ain’t So
“Oh, there’s no way that we’ll lose today!” Cormac declared. “Especially with Weasley AND Potter on the team. You were a questionable Captain but a fantastic Seeker.”
Harry climbed out of the fireplace shaking out his robes and straightening his glasses that had gone askew after flushing himself down a toilet. He had about thirty minutes before Percy was expecting him to be downstairs. Draco was waiting nearby, and when he saw Harry spin into the Ministry he headed over to him.
Ineville and Hagrid charged into the tunnel, Ineville's sword leading the way.  They reached the interior of the Shrieking Shack, only to find the man in black dead.  Hagrid hung his head in sorrow, while Ineville scrubbed a tired hand over his face.  "We need a miracle," he sighed.
Draco gave a curt nod anxiously waiting to be reunited with his love.
Decedent: Harry James Potter
Draco heard a click and the floor beneath him began to shudder before descending into the ground, surrounded by complete darkness. After about a minute, the box touched the ground and the door sprang open. Draco quickly stepped out and made his way to security.
The folder fluttered to ground slowly- almost gracefully- scattering papers around the room. Draco's knees buckled beneath him and his body crumpled to the ground, his back pressed against the bedframe frame. A tightness engulfed his chest,  squeezing his lungs until he was left gasping for air.
"I don't hate you either Malfoy," Harry murmured.
After passing through security, Draco made his way to the second level: Department of Magical Law Enforcement.  Draco briskly walked by the cluttered open area divided into cubicles, eager to see his Harry.
"Now I know I can't share the details with you but let me tell you, this case was unprecedented and our lead was barely a lead," Robards scoffed shaking his head lightly.
"Now, Mr. Potter-"
"You're wrong. I don't hate you Malfoy," Harry replied quietly. "No matter how much we fight I wouldn't thank someone for hurting you. As much as you might get pleasure from hurting people, I don't." Harry retorted, facing Malfoy eye to eye.
"Merlin, Malfoy is such a prick. I bet you if it weren't for his father he'd be kicked out in a heartbeat" Harry complained to Ron. Before Ron could respond Harry heard the nitwit's voice again.
"But you know how determined and headstrong Auror Potter could be. He told me he'd bring in the culprit if it was the last thing he did and I believed him. I sent him on skewed path. I'm- I'm  sorry Draco."
"Give me his file. I know you have it. Give it to me and maybe I won't hex your balls off." Draco growled and shoved the tip of his wand deeper into Robards' quivering throat.
Deepest regards,
"Lumos," Harry spoke softly, lighting his way to the astronomy tower. He tiptoed through the vacant hallways, until approaching his destination. As Harry made his ways up to the stairs he whispered, "nox" seeing as the moonlight provided more than enough light. As he was about to shed his cloak, he heard a sneeze come from his left. Who else would be here at this hour? Harry slowly creeped forwards to get a good look. Harry peered at the body lying next to the tower's railing. From his new position, Harry could see the moonlight highlight a plume of platinum hair belonging to no other than Draco Malfoy. What was he doing here?  Unsure of what to do, Harry went to rescind his steps but failed to notice the cloak had slipped further from his grasp. Harry let out a squeak of surprise as his next step found him parallel to the wooden floor and the silky cloak lay in a clump next to him. Damn the slippery floors! Damn the slippery fabric!  Harry inwardly cursed at himself for revealing himself. What would Malfoy do to him now?
"Virietis"
"Erm, yes?" Harry pushed himself up from the floor and adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose. Oh bloody hell. He'll have to get Hermione to fix his glasses again.
"Does it hurt?" He asked, pointing to Malfoy's injury.
"Please, call me Draco"
Race: Caucasian        Marital Status: Married
Harry shrugged off his friends comments, too focused on the concerning matter at hand. Swallowing thickly, he pushed away any thoughts regarding Malfoy, eager to give Hagrid his full attention.
Dear Mr. Potter,
"Fuck it" Draco muttered. He reached out to the far back of the shelf until his hand clasped over a wide bottle. Uncapping the potion, he brought it to his nose, inhaling deeply. He was instantly struck with the overwhelming scent of rosemary. He chuckled to himself. It was just his luck he picked the right bottle the first time. Perhaps the universe was trying to tell him something,
The two boys sank to the floor, hands intertwined as they looked up at the full moon.
"I'll see you soon, Harry,"he mumbled. Draco tipped his head back and gulped the potion in one swig. He waited to feel something, anything! But nothing came. Draco sank to the floor ignoring the shattered glass beneath him. Maybe he drank too much to feel anything. Whatever the case, he sat sadly, a bloody mess. Merlin, if Harry could see him now in this pathetic state maybe the wanker and wouldn't have gone off and gotten himself killed.
"Who's there?" The blond jerked upright quickly, wildly looking around the room, wand in hand.
Later that night, while Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus slept peacefully, Harry tossed and turned in his bed still conflicted about the earlier events. He hated the git so why did he have the strong urge to wrap his arms around the boy. If he concentrated hard enough, he could remember the sweet smell of Malfoy's coconut hair shampoo. The bitter blonde constantly insulted Harry and his friends, never once holding back. Of course, Harry just fueled the taunts by fighting fire with fire. It was ridiculous, Harry realized. This feud between them was getting bloody tiring. Harry wasn't even sure what they were fighting over at this point. It just seemed like the school expected the Slytherin and the Gryffindor to be at odds with each other.
I hope this letter finds you in good health. Please come swiftly to the Ministry of Magic at 4pm on Sunday to Mr. Gawain Robards' office. We have discovered the whereabouts of your husband, Mr. Harry Potter. That is all we can disclose at the moment.
The Gryffindor and Slytherin third years fell in line behind Hagrid anxiously eyeing their copy of The Monster Book of Monsters. No one knew how on earth they were supposed to open it. The majority of students had their books bound shut with rope or a belt. Some had opted to cram their books into tight bags and hope for the best. As they students found their way to a clearing in the forest, Harry heard Malfoy's snobby voice behind him.
"Potter. I'm not saying it again. You heard me." Malfoy eyed Harry suspiciously, not knowing how Harry would respond. He didn't even know why he confessed what he did to the boy. It must be the after effects of Madam Pomfrey's pain relieving potions. It had to be.
"Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium."
"Potter? Is that you?"
"Thank you. Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes," the woman said. Draco's eyes widened as he saw a square silver badge come out of the coin slot with the words Draco Malfoy, Personal Meeting on it. He pinned it to the front of his robes as the female voice spoke again.
Draco saw a sign plastered to a cubicle in the corner donning the title, "Auror Headquarters". He made a beeline for the cubicle, then turned right finding himself standing in front of a large, dark oak door. A golden plaque with the words Head Auror, and then Mr. Gawain Robards beneath it was nailed to the door at eye level.
"Is that what you think Potter? That I hate you?" Malfoy said, bewildered. Harry nodded.
"What are you doing here Potter? Past your bedtime isn't it? What's the golden boy doing out of bed at these hours?"
""Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business," a woman's voice rang clear throughout the box. However, her voice seemed to fill the box as if she were standing right beside him. He'd never used the visitors entrance before so he stuck to responding through the mouthpiece of the telephone.
Draco released Robards from his group and took a step back. Before Robards could move, Draco pointed his wand at the man's chest and shouted, "Stupefy".
"God, this place has gone to the dogs. Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes," Malfoy loudly sneered.
Home Address: 12 Grimmauld Place, Islington, London
"Got a real treat for yeh today!  A great lesson comin' up! Follow me," announced Hagrid in a booming voice.
"BULL FUCKING SHIT! YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING WHEN YOU SENT HIM. ARE THEY JUST BLOODY PAWNS TO YOU? JUST MINDLESS MACHINES TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK?"
He suddenly remembered to open his eyes when he felt a familiar touch.
The pompous git gave himself a fucking codename. Draco chuckled to himself shaking his head. "Virietis" meant stag in Latvian. Of course, since the prat was sent to Latvia he had to have a Latvian name. Draco stood in their bedroom flipping through the folder, disappointed by the lack of information. Robards wasn't kidding when he said the mission was unprecedented. Five male muggles aged 33 with matching descriptions of being tall and blonde were found with deep slashes marring their pale skin distinctly over their chest. Coroners reported there was no indication of what caused the precise lacerations other than an extremely sharp blade of a sword, given the length of the slashes. The muggle coroners had reported cause of death was hemorrhaging, most likely from the cuts. What was even stranger, was that the men were all identical to Draco.
"I'm not sure I understand Sir. What is you're not telling me? Where is my husband?" Draco's pulse quickened and he heard a small crack coming from the wooden arm of his chair. He didn't feel the wood splinters pierce his skin. There was one thing on his mind, and one thing only. Draco felt blood rush to his head as he stood up. He pushed the chair behind him angrily and gripped Robards' desk, knuckles ashen white.
******
"Accio Virietis folder"
"Come in Mr. Potter," the taller man said gruffly. Robards beckoned Draco to enter, who happily obliged. Draco's face fell as he realized Harry wasn't there to greet him. The letter did say they had found him. Perhaps he was far away and was still on his way home.
Draco muttered a quick tempos checking his time. Good. He was right on time. Just as he was about to knock on Auror Robards' door, the door opened before him revealing a stoic man, he assumed to be the Head Auror. He certainly looked the part, which the tightly pursed lips and thick, naturally furrowed brows.
"Call me that name again and you'll see I can be a lot more hostile." Draco bristled in anger before calming down to say, "Now please, tell me where Harry is."
"Ya mate. He's just another tosser. Sooner or later he'll get what's coming to him" Ron added, patting his friend on the shoulder.
******
"Alright. Draco, I know my letter wasn't all too revealing but as you know Auror Potter is in a dangerous job and we couldn't risk giving out more information had it landed in the wrong hands. I'm sure you understand".
He was getting close to the end of the file which no doubt had a description of Harry's death. The next page was going to be the last time he would ever see his Harry. He almost didn't turn the page but he had to know.
So maybe Harry was a little bit gay. All he knew was that snogging Malfoy, no- Draco,  was the best damn thing to ever happen to him.
"Course not Potter. It was just a wee scratch" Malfoy replied sarcastically. "I've got a bloody sling on because of Hagrid's bloody chicken! It hurts like hell Potter. I don't see why you'd care. You probably thanked the giant bird!"
"It's- It's in the- the drawer. The- to-top drawer. Right drawer" Robards wheezed, straining against the tight hold Draco had on his windpipes.
Hermione brought him back to reality grabbing his arm. "Ignore him Harry. He's not worth your time" she said.
Draco stumbled into a hidden pantry in the basement where he kept his potions, bottle of firewhiskey in hand. In his inebriated state, he accidentally knocked into the left shelf, sending dozens of potions to the ground, shattering on impact. Liquid splattered the hard floors but Draco didn't care. He didn't care that several shards of glass impaled his pale skin. That was the beauty of intoxication- feeling nothing at all. Sluggishly, Draco roamed the shelves looking for two certain potions. He squinted trying to read the different labels but the alcohol blurred his vision.
Draco gulped and turned his head slightly to the right so only one eye could see the page. His hand shook as he went to turn it. Although he stopped his breathing, his heart beat rapidly, loudly, nervously.
The stoically poised man shut the great door behind him before making his way to his desk. Before sitting down in his chair, he gestured for Draco to take a seat. Draco tentatively complied sensing the palpable tension in the air.
Suddenly, a wave of nausea washed over Draco causing him to clutch his stomach in discomfort. He thought he was going to be sick. He leaned over and threw up a sticky, black substance. Oh great, he thought. He forgot the Elixir of Euthanasia potion smelled of rosemary and mint. Instead of drinking the Elixir he drank Phial of Iratus Mortem. Draco knew if he didn't act quickly, his body would start to combust from the inside out. Before Draco could think of a remedy, an excruciating burning sensation rippled through his body eliciting a raw scream of agony. This was ten times worse than the times he suffered through the cruciatus curse. With the little movement the pain allowed, Draco reached for the Draught of Calm. Luckily, when it fell off the shelf it hadn't cracked open like the rest of the potions. Another wave of hot pain seared through Draco's abdomen. Now, a panting, sweaty mess, Draco mustered the last of his strength to hold the bottle to his mouth and swallow the substance.
"The name. Give me the name"
"Where. Is. Harry."
A manila folder flew into Draco's hands with "viertis" scribbled in the top corner in black.  Draco gripped the folder tightly to his chest before apparating back to 12 Grimmauld Place. He couldn't be bothered with niceties anymore. Not when Robards never gave Harry a fighting chance.
Thought after thought bombarded Harry's head. It was beginning to be too much. Harry quietly slipped out of bed and rummaged his trunk for his invisibility cloak. He wasn't going to get much sleep tonight anyways so why not take a stroll through the castle to clear his mind.
This time, it was Harry who caught his breath. He exhaled on a groan when Draco delved deeper and squeezed his aching cock. "Draco... I'm not going to last..."
"Please tell me you did not fall asleep."
"That obvious, am I?"
Draco grinned unabashedly before growing serious once more. "Would you want to leave your career at St Mungo's behind to take over from Pomfrey at Hogwarts?"
Draco never would have believed a ghost could get more pale, but his father managed it.
Draco responded with a hearty laugh. "I've married a mad man," he lamented.
"How in the bloody hell was I cheating?!"
"Point to you," Harry conceded. "However, you're in no condition to be shagging anyone."
"Draco, you need to see a Healer."
Harry was furious--at Malfoy for making the demand, at himself for even considering it, and at his body for wanting it. He breathed in deeply, already hating himself for what he was about to say. "Give me the name first."
"I have not been taking fertility potions," he said. "Why would I? We haven't even discussed marriage, let alone starting a family."
Feeling giddy at the prospect, Harry laughed. "I'll buy you all the strawberries you want, and whipped cream too." The enormity of what they were about to embark on washed over him, and he sought to make sure they were on the same page. "You're sure about this? No regrets?"
"A mere technicality," drawled Snaperdinck, having intruded on Draco's reunion with Harry.  "First, however, we must battle to the death," he said, directing his challenge to Harry.
think it means."
"That was the sound of true love dying," whispered Ineville.  He looked at Hagrid, and together they blurted, "The man in black!"
"Excellent! Why don't you bring the wine?" Potter pushed his chair back and stood up. "I need to speak to Hermione. She has some intel on our next case." He gathered his notes and swept out of the office.
Hagrid stooped to peer at the old man.  "I'm with the Troll Squad," he said.
"That should do it," he said, once it was finished.
Harry heaved a mock sigh. "It seems I've married a demanding shrew." He reached between Draco's legs and tickled his balls. Draco gasped and squirmed, but his hands remained where they were. Harry grinned and dragged the fingers of his right hand through the slick in his left and reached for Draco again. He found his target and rubbed the tightly furled flesh of Draco's entrance.
"But, Zabini," whined the giant, "we cannot simply kill him."
"Stop being dramatic, Father. You're already dead."
Draco worried his lower lip. "You're not proposing just because I'm...because there's a baby?"
"Yeah, I reckon I did," Harry admitted. "Since the Cannons aren't here, may I join you in your bubble bath?"
"That's true," Draco admitted.
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed, tugging the mask away from that beloved face.  "You're alive!"
Draco chuckled and shifted so their bodies fit more snugly together. "I won't be able to suck you off if my lips are sealed."
"At the risk of getting hexed, you do realize you could have cast warming charms, yeah?"
Draco stumbled along in his wake, trying desperately to think of a way to gain his freedom.  What manner of man wasn't interested in money?  Draco dug in his heels.  "I know who you are," he said.  "You're the Dread Pirate Riddle!"
"It's just that...er...I was hoping we could ride the London Eye, and you probably don't want to do that after drinking even one glass of wine."
The man in black charged.  He hit Hagrid in the midsection and bounced off.
The Half-Blood Prince smiled tightly.  "I don't doubt it for a moment."
Still chortling, Malfoy strode forward. His feet went in different directions, and he ended up on the cobbles far faster than Harry had.
Harry closed the door to the honeymoon suite behind him and leaned back against it. His dress shoes were pinching his feet, his tie felt like it was throttling him, and he'd never been happier in his life. Harry pulled Draco into his arms and whispered, "Alone at last."
said the cat.
"Thanks," said Harry, hurrying away to consult with Hermione. He wanted to share Draco's diagnostic results with her for a second opinion.
"Wouldn't I?" Draco challenged. He then turned his attention to Potter.
Harry shrugged from where he sat on the cold cobbles. "Fix them later," he said. He turned onto his uninjured hip and climbed slowly to his feet. Harry's right foot slipped and he pitched forward, catching himself on his hands. It was painful, and he swore under his breath.
"Yeah," Harry replied with a nod. Eating them counted as disposal, right? He hadn't suffered any ill effects.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!" Lucius howled. He condensed into a large orb and flew through the lounge, knocking items to the floor and causing Potter to duck and cover.
"I was wondering the same thing," said Harry. He took a step back and tugged at his tie, sighing in relief when the knot loosened. Harry toed off his shoes, unbuckled his belt, and pulled the tails of his shirt free.
"Ah, I do recall that, now that you mention it," mused Harry. "Something about wanting access to my vaults," he added as he lowered his zip.
Draco groaned and closed his eyes. "You're saying I may miss a significant portion of our season."
Draco had never considered it. "But, I have nothing to trade," he protested faintly.
, but arguing over that particular subject is what had landed them in their current predicament. "I thought you had to surrender your wand."
Draco was left staring after him in bemused silence. It seemed he'd been maneuvered into having dinner with his partner. Draco was surprised to find himself looking forward to it. He only hoped Potter--
Snaperdinck stood and went to Draco's side.  "I understand," he said, expression solemn.  "I have an idea.  You go and write four letters, addressed to your beloved.  I shall send my four fastest ships in each direction, with the intent of delivering your letter once Harry is found.  If he loves you as much as you love him, he will return for you.  But, if he does not, would you reconsider your decision and marry me, instead?"
"You have my word," promised the Half-Blood Prince.  "We will return him to his ship, and he shall be free to go."  As Draco nodded in relief, Snaperdinck leaned close to Count Rodolphus.  "Take him to the Shrieking Shack," he muttered.
"Does a foot rub count as foreplay?" he asked.
"The ginger had a wheelbarrow," said Hagrid.
"We have all night, Harry, not to mention the rest of our lives."
Now she had Draco's curiosity piqued. "What is so alarming that you can't discuss it with me?"
Harry couldn't possibly have heard Malfoy correctly. He carefully sat upright and fumbled about for his glasses. Finding them, Harry settled the specs on the bridge of his nose and peered closely at Malfoy. "What did you say?"
"Surnames?"
"You don't even have a ring."
Draco felt a rush of pride and a sense of accomplishment. Granger had the right of it. He and Potter may have been brought low, but they hadn't let that stop them from taking down their common enemy. He sensed magic in the air an instant before Granger's magic swept the tableau, releasing the combatants from the immobilizing spell and returning them to their human forms.
Harry was nearing the peak of pleasure, and he strained towards it. "Fuck, Malfoy," he panted, puffing out a few nonsensical words before his eyes rolled back in his head. "FUCK!" Harry bellowed as his muscles grew taut and his cock jerked in Malfoy's hand. Harry trembled through it, and when it was over he had to brace his quivering arms to avoid wilting forward and getting smashed, face first, into the sofa while Malfoy continued driving into him.
"That is quite enough!" he growled, magic crackling around him.
Harry rolled carefully out of bed and stretched. He decided to entice his boyfriend with a great breakfast and then ravish him in the kitchen.
"We surrender!" Draco blurted.  He glanced nervously between Harry and Snaperdinck.  "I'll return with you, so long as you let Harry live," he said.
Draco's eyes were immediately drawn to the prominent bulge at his partner's groin, and he felt himself flush. He didn't think he'd be able to keep up with Harry's youthful stamina, but he was willing to provide Harry a release for his ruddy young virility. Draco heaved a sigh and stood up as well. He crossed the cavern to their pallet and began removing his clothing without a word.
"Kill them," ordered Rodolphus.
Harry mustered his Gryffindor courage and grabbed the collar to Malfoy's silk pajamas, careful to avoid his injured arm, before planting his lips on the other boy. The Slytherin gasped in surprise before eagerly responding to the other boy's hunger. Their bodies moved in tandem with their lips and suddenly Malfoy's left fingers were wrapped in Harry's black locks, gripping the strands tightly. Harry let out a moan at the contact, briefly detaching their lips before quickly smashing his lips against the blonde, kissing him heatedly, passionately, as if this was their first and last time. After both boys were out of breath from kissing fervently they pulled apart, cheeks flushed, lips swollen, foreheads resting against one another.
Draco slowly peered down at the file before him. No, not his Harry. No, no, no, no no!  Draco thought, filled with anguish. That couldn't be the strong, fiery, determined Harry he knew. The man before him looked sickly and unbelievably pale. Even paler than Draco. He was bruised and battered to the point where he looked like a completely different person. Harry was naturally lean and wiry, but as he matured he had filled out his body, becoming more muscular. However, the man in this picture had knobby knees and his rubs jutted out from his main frame.
Draco stiffened his posture in response to Robards' words but he knew Harry wouldn't want his temper to get the best of him.
