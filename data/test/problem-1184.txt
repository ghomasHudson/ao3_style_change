A moment later, Ron opened the door. Harry watched his sleep-heavy eyes grow wide before he let himself into the sitting room and closed the bedroom door behind him.
Harry couldn’t reveal everything he’d seen in Draco’s mind, but he reckoned that Draco would be all right with him sharing the good memories of New York City and that suburban synagogue.
"Me too," Harry confided. "I know this—whatever it is between us—is moving fast, but . . . well, I'm glad you're here. Glad you're staying.”
Draco turned his head toward him and nodded. “No. You and your muggle brawling—I still relish the moment when I found out you were all banned.”
Harry thought for a moment, and then changed the subject. “So, Benjamin: why do I know that name? Wait. He's Shira's brother-in-law. And a muggle, yeah?”
Whereas Harry reminded him of the charged atmosphere just before a thunderstorm, Weasley’s scent was more like the calm in the wake of that storm, when the air feels lighter and less tense, and a general sense of relaxation prevails.
Draco was even willing to admit that Hagrid possessed a legitimate talent when it came to magical creatures. But that did not make the man a qualified teacher. He had no idea how to conduct a proper lesson, and he had no business introducing his students to the most dangerous monsters he could find or breed.
“Er, dangers of teaching Magical creatures. Misunderstanding between me and one of the—well, never mind that. Here to visit someone, are you? Not one of the Weasleys, I hope.”
Draco made a chuffing noise. He couldn't imagine the powers-that-be promoting Harry from the field straight to the top, but perhaps an intermediate desk job would open up. Preferably for both Harry and Ron.
The whole room was perfect. Most of Malfoy Manor had a sumptuous but somber feel to it, and Harry almost fancied that he could hear echoes of Voldemort's tread. But this room—with its soothing, sage-coloured walls—was different.
For a moment, Harry didn't think Draco would answer. He'd probably had his fill of questions for the day. And this level of cooperation, at least with Harry and his lot, was a new experience for him.
One moment, Draco seemed content to be held by George. The next, there was a ferret tearing through the room, with George in fast but clumsy pursuit—George still had all the speed and power of a beater, but that came along with a stereotypical lack of grace. Nonetheless, he managed to get one pinky on Draco’s tail, and then promptly ran in the other direction.
“Wasn't telling you anything, Malfoy. Just, you know, pointing out that you're still lying on top of me.”
“Look, I know things went badly at Hagrid’s.” Harry pushed himself up so that he was sitting. “I, um, might owe you an apology.”
Not all the letters were angry, though. Some were delighted that Draco Malfoy was finally serving some kind of sentence. A disturbing number called on Harry to be as severe as possible.
Ron looked him over. “I actually didn’t mean it as an insult. I was serious before—I do like you better now.”
Draco felt an infuriating mixture of anger and guilt and panic rising in his gut—and then he caught a whiff of wolf. So the other Weasley was Bill, and it was really better that Draco be anywhere else in the world but here. He needed to break loose or transform or something . . . .
He didn't smell as musky and ferret-like as Bill expected, but that wasn't surprising. As soon as that picture appeared in the Prophet—the one of Harry holding Draco in his ferret-form and smiling down at him—Bill had done some research. A skilled animagus had considerable control over his animal form, so even though Draco-as-ferret seemed to be, er, whole, he could probably tamp down his scent and even keep himself from going into heat.
“But . . .” Draco, for once, seemed at a loss for words. “You’re allowed to drive in the States without a license?”
But Harry didn't look away in disgust. He stared at it for a moment, without any particular expression, and then shook his head. "Draco, I see that all the time on you."
“One of the few,” Draco agreed as he turned back to George. “Look, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for siding with Umbridge and with . . . with the wrong side during the war.”
“Harry,” Draco spoke slowly now. “If everything had played out how it was supposed to, I’d have died in that explosion. I wouldn’t be alive to worry about anything else.”
"And that's something else I don't want: people knowing that's real. I don't want them searching for it." Harry swallowed. “You don’t really see me that way, do you? As some sort of saviour?”
"I assume so." Jamie crinkled her brow. "It's not usually an issue back home. Most American guys are already circumcised."
"They have one mobile they share. Not sure if it has a proper keyboard. And they definitely don't have that one with the virtual keyboard. Dunno about a pager, though. They ought to have one."
"Of course!" Granger sounded as if she wanted to smack herself. "They're laundering their funds through muggle accounts, using muggle technology—"
Draco settled on an obvious response. “It would be unofficial. You know that, don’t you? Not even muggles recognise gay marriage.”
Either way, Harry changed into a tee shirt and joggers and slid into bed. He reached out to stroke Draco, but got an angry hiss, complete with an arched back and bristling fur, in return. Shit, he was awake. And definitely not speaking to him.
Suddenly Potter's—no, Harry's—hands were on Draco's shirt, unbuttoning it from the top. And that would be a welcome development, except there was no desire in his eyes right now. More like some sort of righteous indignation.
“I’m sure he doesn’t hate you,” Harry said cautiously. “I don’t think he hates anyone—not even your father.”
Ron distracted Draco just then by absently stroking his back. Draco forgot about his father as he stretched and twisted to make the most of this massage. He soon found himself dooking with pleasure, which drew a good-natured laugh from Ron.
“Technically, yes. But I was on a sort of probation—this group didn’t trust me yet. So they didn’t involve me in anything of consequence.” He paused. “Look, I wasn’t in danger until much later, when I was deeper in. ”
Harry didn't push him any further. He just stayed there with him, half wanting just to hold him and half wanting to fuck his brains out.
And somehow she was standing between the two men, who both looked more than willing to hurl unforgivable curses at one another—and both were perfectly capable of it. She, for one, understood that Harry Potter was not the saint everyone thought he was.
“Look, Draco’s right,” Harry tried to make his voice sound soothing. “We can use all the help we can get. I just want to make sure you’re happy here, that’s all.”
"Yes, Harry." He couldn't keep the annoyance out of his voice. "Look, we just sort of fell into this. And we're only twenty. And you . . . you've got your pick of witches and wizards. Ones without this."
Ron laughed again as he picked up the button, pocketed it, and then scratched Draco behind the ears. “Burrowing. Right. Stupid question. And of course I would choose today to finally wear a proper shirt . . . Anyway, I won the first match, but Draco’s mind wasn’t really on it. He won the second one, though.”
“Harry,” he was saying as he lowered the kettle closer to the flames of the fireplace, “you’re better off without that little Malfoy git hanging about. Still his father’s son, I reckon. If he’s pretending to be your servant, it’s because he thinks there’s something in it for him.”
Those last infuriated Harry. Ron understood that—and he felt the same. He might still have some issues with the ferret, but he didn't want to see him abused. But a lot of people did, and Harry would have to learn how to deal with that kind of hatred. If he really wanted to make a go of it with Malfoy, he'd find himself confronting it often enough.
Fortunately his mother spoke up first. "We are very grateful to you, Harry. Draco told us about what happened in the, ah, Room of Requirement, I believe it's called? How you and your friends risked your lives to save him from the fiendfyre—”
“You can apologise to my brother Bill, though,” Ron added, almost as an afterthought. “Reckon you’ll see him soon.”
Fuck. Ron hadn’t had a chance to talk to Malfoy about that yet. “Oh, I meant to tell you when we woke up. He’s taking you to pick up Shira and Jamie. Er, just you.”
Draco replied with a gentle laugh as he moved faster to match him. "More than okay, you idiot. Don't stop!"
Draco snorted. “Just a little. Mostly I was head over heels for you. You’re—well, let’s just say the role of the Holy Saviour suits you.”
He stared at her, but then had the grace to look chagrined. Amused also, but still chagrined. “I’ll attempt to tone it down.”
“Yeah, good thinking. They might know scions of the Baumgarten family, actually. I don’t think they know about the arranged marriage idea, though.”
That’s when Ron heard the knock at the bedroom door. Having no reason to suspect that anyone other than Kreacher was in the house, he had shouted an order to come in.
Harry felt a curious flip in his stomach as some of his anger melted away. Apparently Draco actually worried for him. And apparently he already considered Grimmauld Place, Harry’s home, to be his home as well.
Draco hesitated. “You didn’t object to the public part of the deal,” he said at last. “I know you wanted to, but you didn’t. But if you had ever told the Wizengamot what you really thought—that my father should rot in prison—he’d have spent the rest of his life in Azkaban.”
“Potter here has placed us all under his protection,” Draco explained. “He’ll make sure you keep your liberty, Father. And he’ll make sure the Ministry doesn’t seize our home.”
“Right.” Harry smiled despite the fact that he was still half asleep. “It’s an ungodly hour of the morning here, love. Can this wait?”
Fuck, he was apparating. Or Draco was, anyway, in the memory. But it wasn’t just bad in the way that apparating in general was bad.  It was worse, because of what would happen at the destination point . . . .
"Sorry, Potter. If I'd known pulling my arse out of fires was such a high priority for you, I would have done."
“I gather he feels threatened by you,” Hermione said wryly. “And with reason, I imagine. You invaded a memory he had locked away, didn’t you?”
The slightest hint of guilt crept into Potter’s eyes, though his face was red with what was more likely anger. “He’s fine. I’m sorry, I should have told your house elf that. It’s not that sort of emergency.”
“But you are now.” Harry’s eyes gleamed with something curiously like approval. “You’re not the bully I knew in school—but that’s the bully Dobby knew, isn’t it?”
Too late. His white-blond hair transformed into white-blond fur. It happened so fast that Harry scarcely noticed as Draco scrambled onto his lap.
"Doesn't look like an act." Harry initiated another chaste kiss, but stopped himself from pressing for more. "Sure you want people to know about this life debt?"
Harry smiled. “Do you suppose Anthony Goldstein had one? He didn’t invite any Gryffindors if he did.”
Harry had felt an odd but poignant sympathy for his old nemesis when that article appeared. He hadn't known whether it was true or not—though his gut told him it was—but either way, it was no one's business but Draco’s.
“You've got a life debt to me, remember?” he said at last. “More than one, actually. And the Malfoys, apparently, care about their debts.”
“Potter, these neo-Death Eater cells don't all talk to each other. And none of them know that I'm an animagus—”
That was also true, but Draco really ought to have brought it up. His interest in Judaism—well, it showed a different side of him, didn’t it? One that Arthur wouldn’t have expected.
But he must have obtained a wider world view living with Shira and Jamie in New York. They might both be purebloods, but with Jamie as a squib and the pair of them into alternative cultures . . . well, that must have helped. And all that time away from the poison his parents believed must have helped.
“Yes, well.” He blushed. “You legilimency is improving, because most of those took place in the social hall, not in the sanctuary.”
Harry reckoned he could feel that jolt now, even though—Jesus Merlin Christ, they were high up! He wasn’t close to any of the windows, but he could still see out of them, and they were . . . fuck, was he seeing over the tops of skyscrapers?
No, the Weasleys must not have done; Ron didn’t know about the rococo style. (Or if he did, he’d never explained it to Harry.) So maybe it was just the posh pure-blood parents.
“Conditionally.” Ron shrugged. “He did dangerous work for the aurors. Not by choice, but it still counts for something.”
He had gone to Harry, fully conscious of what it would cost him to humble himself. It had been one thing to beg the saviour to intervene on behalf of his father. But to ask for that wand back—fuck, Draco had swallowed an ocean of pride.
He swore under his breath. “Those comments—that was me parroting my father. In truth, Weasley, I always envied you all those siblings. That’s partly why . . . well, being an only child has its drawbacks.”
“Of course. But if it’s your calling . . . well, then, it’s your calling. I won’t interfere with that.”
“No, he’s not.” Ron was giving him a thoughtful look now that seemed completely out of place. He only took on that particular expression during a game of chess. “And I think Hermione and I will need to join this boycott.”
Draco grinned. "Not really. A bit niche, I suppose. Shira's uncle introduced me to his work. I meant this one for an investment, but now I'm too attached to sell it."
She was flattered. The ferret was boosting her ego—in a good way, Ron thought. Malfoy finally appreciated Hermione properly. And respected her properly. The git really was over his prejudices against muggle-borns.
“I know there were extenuating circumstances.” His father leaned forward in the chair. “I was there at the trials, Ron. I remember Harry’s testimony.”
“Why do they suddenly need privacy for their game?” Hermione asked, glancing down at Harry from the small, two-person couch. No, chesterfield; that was the proper name, according to Draco.
“Draco lowered his wand!” Harry was on his feet now too, finally shouting. “He wasn't going to do it. I was there!”
"We've got a different sort of relationship, that's all." He put a hand on Harry's cheek. Slowly, as if he were the shy one now.
Harry finished scribbling an answer to Shacklebolt and watched the owl take it gingerly in it's beak. “Sorry,” he told the animal. “Still no treats. I really will make it up to you.”
"That's a bit limiting, isn't it? I'm relying on you, Harry, to . . . to give me some sort of consequence when I do something like hang up on my master in a fit of anger and hurl my mobile across the room."
“It’s the reason you’re still breathing, you know. The fact that I hurl myself into danger and rescue people.”
“I’m not disappointed. I’m just—” Harry broke off to step closer and put his hands on the door. Now Draco was trapped, rather than pinned, but he still didn’t seem to mind. “Draco, you must have known that I cared about . . . about what happened to you. Why else would I agree to keep my mouth shut when it came to your father?”
Harry didn’t push him off, although he easily could have done. Something about Draco’s voice stopped him.
"That's a massive job at Grimmauld Place, actually." Harry looked thoughtful and a little apprehensive. "Before you start, I need you to figure out exactly what, um, interesting items are still there, what they're supposed to do, what they actually do, and whether they can be salvaged."
“I got into the habit at Hogwarts,” he explained. “I would get up before anyone else so I could work on assignments and revise for exams in peace. Besides, I had to make my high marks look effortless.”
But Draco wasn’t paying him any attention. “I still remember coming across you right before a match. You must have been running late, but somehow you made time to harass me. You asked me where I was going as if it were your business. As if I owed you an answer.”
“Oh, it will never get old,” Harry promised. But he stopped needling him. There'd be plenty more opportunities for that.
But he put that thought aside as he closed his eyes. The Weasel and his body heat were surprisingly comfortable. And he was lulled by the talk between him and the Holy Scarhead, which had somehow moved onto Quidditch. Draco was no longer paying much attention to the specifics; in fact, he was dozing.
Harry took a gulp of his own wine before he remembered that he was supposed to be sipping it. He had no particular opinion on Blair or any other politician, muggle or otherwise, but Lucius was sounding as canny as ever. Did the man still have influence in the ministry, even after his fall from grace?
"Yes, I think we should postpone that discussion until morning." His mother stood up. "Draco, I'm sure you can guide Harry to the proper guest room? The one adjacent to yours will do quite nicely, I think."
"Yes. You have my services till death do us part and all that. But I don't owe your heirs anything, and mine won't owe you or your heirs anything."
“I thought we’d have time, Draco! I thought only our friends would know for now. I didn’t think the Prophet would hound us about this so soon.”
"You were in the Room of Requirement, secretly fixing that cabinet. I scared Goyle off guard duty, but he was noisy about running away. So you must have known someone was just outside the room."
“What the—Hermione, you know it’s not like that.” Harry forced himself not to raise his voice. “You know I’d keep all the Malfoys safe even if he broke up with me. Even if he wanted to cancel this life debt.”
“Nothing. So, um, you choose the thoughts you’ll allow to rise to the surface, and then you lock them up. So when someone penetrates them through legilimency—”
Harry had prepared for this moment. Draco had likely imagined—with considerable pleasure—Hermione delivering a blistering lecture. Possibly with a hex to drive the lesson home. But Harry was too experienced with Hermione to allow that; he knew just how to distract her.
“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Her voice was somehow gentle and pointed at the same time. “Hagrid isn’t always best at keeping secrets.”
Suddenly, bizarrely, Draco was smiling. “I keep telling you: I’m not angry about that spell. I don’t blame you. And, honestly, I’m glad I didn’t know that it was unintentional. Because, Harry, you slicing me open like that—that’s when I knew that you had it in you. That you could defeat Voldemort.”
Hermione lifted her hand to reveal that, for all his protests, Draco was grinning. He took hold of Hermione’s hand and, with a mischievous glance at Ron, kissed it tenderly. For which Ron tackled him again, initiating a playful, ad hoc wrestling match. Fortunately Hermione was too amused to bother stopping it.
“Yeah,” Ron put in. “He’ll be there for a week. Draco arranged for him to stay with the Baumgartens.”
"Yes it is. And don't look at me as if I'm some down-trodden house elf in need of your activism. As your husband pointed out, I make out quite well from this deal."
"All right!" His face reddened, but he kept talking. "They said they'd throw my father back into Azkaban unless I agreed to the undercover work."
“Yes.” The affirmation was out of Draco's mouth before he had even given it a conscious thought. He fought not to look embarrassed as he realised what he said. “Of course I do. You think I'd say no to the holy saviour?”
"Master Draco is a most noble wizard!" Kreacher's elderly voice quivered in admiration, causing Harry's stomach to turn.
“Yeah.” Harry shook himself. “So, ah, Grimmauld Place. Would you help me—I don't know. Pull it together? Make it look like a non-goth adult lives there?” He paused to glance at the picture of Draco and the girl who was probably Shira. Whoever she was, she was definitely goth. “Uh, not that there’s anything wrong with goths. But it’s not really my style."
The holy-fucking-saviour hesitated before answering, and then seemed to suck in a lung's worth of air. “To start with, I want you to tell me what Robards is holding over you.”
Draco shifted, forcing Harry to lift his head and look him in the face. Those grey eyes of his were suddenly intent. “Is there something else you want to do?”
“Not necessarily.” Harry’s brain was stampeding ahead. “Your father was out of favour, Draco. And you weren’t there every second that monster was in your home.”
Draco looked relieved as he furrowed his brow. “On either the 102nd or the 103rd floor of the north Twin Tower. Cantor Fitzgerald’s offices go from the 101st to the 105th, but I can never remember which one Benjamin’s desk is on.”
Harry murmured an agreement as he climbed off of Draco and slid under the covers with him. At least Draco sounded more resigned than annoyed at the thought of seeing Ron and Hermione so soon. That, Harry supposed, was progress.
Of course, things might turn ugly. The man despised Draco—in fairness, understandably. Weasley wasn’t wrong when he named all the reasons. Hell, Hagrid had a right to turn Draco away.
“No.” Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I’ve never been on a plane or anywhere outside the UK. But how difficult can it be?”
Draco knew the voice who answered her: he’d heard the twins bellowing often enough at Hogwarts. And since only one of them had survived the war, this must be George. But which Weasley was behind him?
Before the Malfoy family's spectacular fall from grace, his father had picked up on every Ministry rumour. Which wasn't surprising, considering his methods: he had fawned over some contacts and blackmailed others.
There would also, however, be no Weasley to scoop him up. Draco yipped at that, squirmed, and then put his paws on Weasley’s face, reminding him that he still had nails, trimmed or not.
Draco’s lips curled into a scowl. “Thank you so much for your concern.” He pulled his hands from Harry and folded them. “Care to remember why we’re here? It’s because I’m graciously giving you access to some of those memories.”
But, in the end, he would have died undercover if Harry hadn’t intervened. And there was a target on his back now. And, for all his changes, Draco was still, er, Draco. So if he was willing to answer to Harry’s best friends, so much the better.
“I am, so I’ll see if I can arrange it.” Andromeda would agree, wouldn’t she? Harry wasn’t about to keep his boyfriend away from his godson. Especially when said boyfriend and godson were related.
Harry released him. Draco scrambled off his lap and ran to George, though he took a strangely circuitous route that led underneath some of the furniture. Bill understood; Draco was giving him and his wolfish scent as wide a berth as possible.
“And Shira’s aunt taught me to become an animagus and some wandless magic to boot. Plus I kept up my occlumency and potions, my skills in working with enchanted objects, even threw myself into muggle finances. I’m not completely useless, you know.”
His boyfriend was still hesitating. But it didn’t matter; Harry had just figured it out for himself.
But those had been positive memories. Now they would be passing into more negative ones; presumably ones dealing with grief and guilt and trauma.
Kreacher's little cough reminded both men of his presence. “Master should remember that he had promised to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley yesterday evening. Master missed the appointment. They have both just apparated near the house and will soon be outside the do—”
This was a bastardly thing to do, but at the moment Harry didn't care. “Don't try to follow me. We're not on the floo network here and the wards won't let you apparate out alone yet.”
“Soon, probably. So better pretend not to despise a poor wizarding family with more children than they can afford.”
Meanwhile, if Harry were honest, he'd have to admit that Draco was probably reading Ron correctly. And, yes, the entire Weasley family would probably agree with him. There was more going on here, though. Draco was somehow being honest with him, yet distracting him at the same time.
“If you die young I will hurl myself straight into Blaise Zabini’s arms. And we’ll live miserably ever after.”
That left his private chat with Arthur. Harry sighed. Ron had probably been correct. There really was no way for that conversation to have gone well.
"Dunno." Draco sounded thoughtful. "Not sure if it's a New York thing in particular or an American thing in general."
“I didn't call anyone from the papers.” He hesitated. “Why are you upset about this? I told you I wanted it public. You never said you minded.”
That was, oddly, the exact right thing to say. Draco managed a grateful snort and mentally prepared himself to see his father.
Ron sighed and leaned back on the kitchen chair—so far that it balanced precariously on two legs. "Wasn't your fault. And Hermione was going to find out about Toffee sooner or later, you know."
Most importantly, Draco's parents were satisfied. They had swallowed their pride and agreed to sign over a life interest in Malfoy Manor to Harry. The paperwork would take time, but Draco was fairly sure they would keep their promise to see this through. The manor was too vulnerable to seizure without Harry's protection. And they seemed to take Harry's word that he would not try anything underhanded—that the property would be left to Draco's heirs.
Draco let out a long-suffering sigh. “Because we were, by my estimate, on rather uncertain terms. I had no idea how you’d react to such an offer.”
Harry chuckled. "Look, you're curious and intelligent and playful. Sometimes in a dickish way, but still. And you're, you know, pointy and angular the way a ferret is."
"Draco was working undercover for Robards," Potter said. "He must have been at it for some time, because he was a proper agent—even became an animagus while he was in New York."
Draco inhaled deeply, letting the air fill his diaphragm so he could focus on finding the words he needed. “One of my chief sins, Harry, is jealousy. Or coveting, perhaps. Or both, I suppose. I always, you know, coveted your power, your skill as a seeker, the friendships you formed, the attention you attracted . . . and your courage. God, I wanted your courage. I made myself sick with envy sometimes. Literally sick to the point of vomiting.”
“Uh, right.” Right. Of course. This was the perfect way to end an awkward conversation. Except that Hagrid had recovered a bit and seemed ready to resume his interrogation.
“Dunno, actually. We fixed up one floor as a guest room for them, though—that was Kreacher’s idea. It’s almost a proper flat. Draco probably wants to show them.”
“Yeah,” George shivered as he stood up. “Scary place. We’ll get out of your way, then. Good luck in New York. And good luck with the Baumgartens.”
Now Draco was looking as if he were forced to endure the most clueless boyfriend in history. "The question, Harry, is if you're willing to be seen with them. With my parents, I mean. In a magical establishment—not a muggle one. We won't be able to hide from the press."
“So Malfoy’s the one who provided all that intelligence?” Weasley was asking. “And when you found out, you went to rescue him alone?”
For the first time, Harry forced himself to ask why he had fallen for Malfoy, of all people. He was going to have to explain it to Ron and Hermione, so he might as well practise on himself.
"But I'll accept that there was some miracle involved when you died in the forest and then returned to us. Through the power of the stone or . . . whatever. I’m grateful for that miracle, but I don’t intend to overthink it.”
"Ron's right, you know." Harry tried for a bit of sternness. "I can't believe you never went to bed."
Draco leapt down and draped himself around Harry's shoulders. It was impossible not to smile at that, so Harry didn't bother trying to look stern.
Harry glared at him. “I’m going to take them down eventually. And no, Toffee, neither your head nor Kreacher’s will ever be up there. But we can’t tell him that.”
Hermione refused to rise to that bait. “You know that's not what I meant. This is about the life debt.”
“Fair point.” Harry wondered how much Draco knew about his time with his muggle family. A few facts were public knowledge now, thanks to a spat of unauthorised biographies. And Harry had told Draco a bit, though they hadn’t discussed the Dursleys at length yet.
He took a muggle cab from Heathrow back to Islington. Door to door service would have been awkward, considering the wards at 12 Grimmauld Place, so he asked the driver to leave him at the nearest Costa’s.
Shira, meanwhile, turned back to Harry. “Please go straight up to Aunt Cissy—she’s driving me insane. Jamie has more patience. So will you, I think.”
Harry laughed. “Come on; we could both do with a shower. I’m sure you can show me a few of your kinks in there.”
“No.” Weasley slowly shook his head, as if still working it out for himself. “No, you’re entitled to privacy about this, with a couple of caveats.”
Besides, Draco's reaction was more important than George's or Bill's. And he was giving Harry an odd look that somehow combined both longing and disbelief. At least until he tucked that look away and turned his expression neutral.
Harry felt oddly shy as he changed back into yesterday's trousers and then waited, topless, for Draco to lend him a fresh shirt. Merlin, what was the matter with him? He'd changed in front of Draco last night without a second thought.
“Don’t worry. I’m not angry about it.” Draco shoved his hands into the pockets of his trousers and stared down at the floor. “Not anymore. Not even then, I don’t think. It’s not as if I don’t know what the man is.”
“Yeah, I got that. And, actually I'm okay with it, as long as you promise to treat him like a house elf.”
Harry was unimpressed. “Come off it, Malfoy. You could have kicked me out of those memories if you’d really wanted to. You’re much better at occlumency than I am at legilimency.”
Harry bit back another grin as he rested his hands on Draco's waist. "Get off or . . . well, this book has a lot to say about proper ferret cages. I'm sure I could transfigure one for you. Might be just the thing for a time out—"
Draco had cocooned himself in all the blankets. Of course he had. So Harry took a pillow and smacked him with it.
“Sorry,” Draco muttered as his body finally stilled. “Thought you’d have better reflexes, you being an auror and all.”
"So I guarantee a platonic night," Draco continued. "Unless your taste is peculiar and, ah, a bit alarming."
Hermione focused her attention on the laptop. She was seated directly in front of it; Draco, meanwhile, was leaning sidelong toward the screen.
Harry shook his head at both of them and then turned to Granger, whose paperwork was now sprawled across the chesterfield. “Hermione, wait. I’ve got a better idea than wasting our day on filling out forms.”
“That I could be a murdering bastard? That’s what you understood?” Harry clenched his fists again, furious with himself. “I was a stupid bastard, Draco. I would never have cast that if I’d known what it did.”
Harry could think of any number of reasons. Draco might not want to share a house with his former nemesis. He might already have a flat of his own somewhere. Or . . . well, he’d grown up here at Malfoy Manor. He was probably attached to the grounds, the mansion, and this perfect, soothing room.
Draco was still trying to fix his own hair, but Ron decided not to allow that. So he tackled Draco from behind, pulling him back down onto the bed and mussing his hair at the same time.
“Can do, I suppose.” Hagrid stiffened his shoulders, as if he had sensed the shift too. “Just don’t go putting your faith in him, Harry. He’s still a selfish git, I reckon, and he’ll only hurt you in the end.”
Potter grunted. “Maybe we've turned a corner in our relationship. Bet he's cross with me, though, for outing him as an agent.”
He nodded. “We already talked it over. Draco agreed that I’d have the final say come September. And unless things don’t work between us, and he’s madly in love with Shira by then, I’ll never allow it.”
There was a sudden, dangerous glint to Harry’s eyes. “What do you want to see? What sort of punishment would you like to inflict on someone who, as a teenager, was forced to serve Voldemort and live with that monster's constant threats to him and his parents?”
“Is it?” Lucius gave him a look of polite disbelief. “And just how long have you two been seeing each other?”
“Right,” Ron agreed. “He and Harry struck a deal, Dad. Hermione and I were witnesses. Both of them are happy with the terms.”
Harry didn’t bother to fight him. He knew he wouldn’t fight him over the clothes either; it was easier (and probably more effective in the long run) to just let Draco play the part of his personal shopper and valet combined. But he sighed a little as he grabbed a towel. He was still the one in charge, he told himself. He was just learning to pick his battles.
Hermione coughed before anyone could respond. “Excuse me.” She placed a hand over her chest and paused for a breath—not that she was fooling anyone. “Draco, I'd like to discuss the information on the flash drive with you. Shall we go down to the dining room and look it over?”
Ron entered his flat as quietly as he could, careful not to turn on a light or cast Lumos in case Hermione was already sleeping. It wasn’t his fault that Hermione left a pile of books right where he would trip over them—although, arguably, he was responsible for the weights he managed to stub his toe on.
He scoffed. “There won’t be an exam, so don't worry. No need to prove you’re better than me this time.”
“I think it’s a brilliant pic,” Weasley commented through the last of his crisps. “You really do make a good ferret, Malfoy.”
Draco didn’t quite meet his eyes. “Why not? It is new. But I’ll see to it, sir, that Harry doesn’t avoid the Burrow whilst he and I sort ourselves.”
Hermione finally found her voice. “Surely you realise that Harry can’t comment on an auror mission! Especially one that’s related to an ongoing investigation.”
Harry knew this was not the time to rub that in. “Want to talk about—um, whatever's really upsetting you?"
But Draco surprised him. "My personal fortune started with gifts from various Malfoys and Blacks," he explained. "But I've enhanced it with my own legitimate investments—not by cheating muggles."
“That’s true,” Hermione admitted. “Although she never took the dark mark. Still, we don’t know for certain that the mark prevents one—but be patient, Harry. It probably won’t come easy to him.”
Harry stroked him gently, careful not to disturb him. It still amazed him that Draco had accepted his ferret-hood with good grace, considering the way Crouch Jr. had humiliated him. Merlin, just reminding Draco of the transfiguration had been enough to shut him up for weeks afterward.
But Harry didn’t say any of that out loud. Instead, he simply nodded as he climbed to his feet. Then he allowed Draco to lead him out of the sanctuary.
Still, it couldn’t hurt to mollify his boyfriend, so he dressed himself in the outfit that Draco had laid out for him. Which turned out to be as perfect as yesterday’s: comfortable, casual and somehow just a little edgy. Harry couldn’t help but check himself out in the mirror—he looked good. And not as if Draco were turning him into a fashion plate or anything. No, he looked like himself, but a bit better.
“We’re here for a reason, Harry.” He took a step back. “And the memories I’ve hidden here . . . they’re not all pleasant.”
"Oh, we're not changing." Potter’s face was fierce and determined now. "I want Robards to see just how close he came to getting us both blown up."
Ron released his hold on Malfoy’s arm, but he stuck close to him as they walked toward the castle. If Malfoy found that odd, he didn’t say so. He didn’t say anything at all.
“Why are you here, Harry?” Lucius’s voice was tight as he placed a hand on Narcissa’s back. “Surely you didn’t arrive at midnight to tell us that you and our son are in the midst of some childish quarrel.”
He looked around for a place to sit. Unfortunately, most of the furniture here was designed for house elves, so he took a seat on the floor instead.
“Dunno. Reckon we’re both more singed than burnt. Don’t think anything’s broken. Could do without the nausea from the petrol fumes, though. You?”
“Yes.” Her quill was floating in front of her now, scribbling furiously on a piece of parchment. “How interesting, then, that he waited until this last rescue to call in the life debt.”
"Oh, this will play out just as you thought. No one at the ministry will touch Malfoy Manor, as long as I hold it." He hesitated, half-relishing and half-dreading the next step.
Draco looked away. “I almost killed two of our fellow students that year. One of them is your best mate.”
"I am too," Harry said. "But you can tell your parents that I'll be happy to join them for your birthday dinner at whichever restaurant they choose. It will just be a week later than planned."
Harry laughed again and put all thoughts of life-debts and confessions out of his head. Plenty of time for that horror show tomorrow. Right now, the warmth of Draco's skin and the cool-yet-aroused look in his grey eyes reminded him that they still had so many new things to try together. And Harry had the remainder of the night to make a dent in that particular list.
“Don’t put words into my mouth.” Hermione was exasperated now. “And, please, stop with the self-loathing.”
Draco snorted. “I know who Molly Weasley is. And trust me, no smoothing over will come of this conversation. Her husband disliked every word that came out of my mouth.”
“Only listen, I know.” Harry paused to give the elf a contrite smile. “You’re right, of course. Go put your feet up, Kreacher.”
So now Potter was up off the chesterfield and across the room. He looked frustrated and besotted and absolutely adorable. Despite his own frustration, Draco couldn't help but smile.
“Sorry,” Harry said. “Look, I shouldn’t have stopped you from coming with me. I know they’re your parents. But I really thought—”
"Are you talking about Malfoy Manor, Ferret?" Ron folded his arms across his chest. "You think Harry wants that place?"
"I'm not meeting anyone official until tomorrow afternoon. I'm supposed to be recovering from jet lag till then."
The bed shifted as Harry sat up. Suddenly a warm light surrounded them both; Draco found himself squinting.
“So this thing you have with Harry—the life debt, the, uh, relationship . . . all of it—it’s all real?”
“No.” Draco yawned. He was usually wide awake for hours in the aftermath of this particular nightmare, but the warmth of the blankets, combined with the intense heat that seemed to naturally radiate from Harry, had soothed him enough to leave him feeling drowsy.
It was surprisingly hard to think of a better one. Harry suspected that any serious movement would lead to the discovery of worse injuries than either of them were aware of, and he wasn't sure he could face that just yet. “All right.”
"Right." Harry bit back a grin as he decided not to introduce Draco to the possibly condescending term 'chick-flick.'
Not that Arthur himself was particularly religious. He wasn't, as far as Harry knew. But he respected people who were, and he found the actual practise of religion intriguing, especially as it concerned muggles.
That was, presumably, a rhetorical question, so Draco just kept nuzzling and chirrupping away. Potter kept stroking him and even pressed his mouth, briefly, to the top of Draco's head.
“None.” Harry raised his eyebrows at the man. “But, speaking of politics, I understand you take an active interest in the muggle parliament. How do you like Blair’s chances?”
And then his brain must have relaxed properly, because he felt the tug of a memory. A cracked mirror. A smashed cistern. Shame. Anger. Terror. A water-logged floor . . . .
Harry forced himself to pay attention again. Unfortunately, this didn’t sound at all like a style he would enjoy, especially when it came to gilding.
“It is. I answered all his questions about New York and muggle life there—and I didn’t sound like some blood supremacist, I swear it! I don’t look down on muggle culture anymore.”
She kissed his cheek. “Percy always comes around in the end. But how do you intend to handle your parents?”
And, anyway, if it was a fight, he had clearly won: Draco would let him teach him those two spells. Not that he expected Draco to be an easy student, but Harry was still counting this as a victory.
There was a moment of silence, and then the sound of Ron climbing more steps. "He better not have woken Hermione."
“God, no.” Draco’s tone was half contemptuous and half soothing. “I’ve switched about my memories and codes since that time, I promise. Focus, Harry.”
Now Harry knew for certain how loud and fierce those arguments had become. Yet Harry still couldn’t sense any negative feelings here, so Draco had probably enjoyed them immensely.
Draco didn’t pull his hands away from Harry, but he didn’t quite return their grip either. “Call it a force of habit. Or a security blanket, perhaps. I like knowing that certain memories are locked up tight.”
Bill remembered hearing about this: the Slytherins had a lost a match against Gryffindor, but Draco made up for that by cruel remarks about the Weasley family and their mum. Harry and George were both stupid enough to take the bait. Fred too, if memory served.
"All to circumvent detection, yeah?" Ron shook his head. "Clever, but how far can we follow the money?"
There was much more to say between them, but Hermione still couldn’t face that yet. So she peered at the screen instead, determined to learn more about arbitrage and how to manipulate galleons and knuts.
“Well, that’s something. I suppose it’s best not to be at each other’s throats.” He paused. “Weasley, I know I’ve never properly apologised to you and Granger—”
“Listen, I'm living with you now. We’re going to be seen together. Plus your rights to Malfoy Manor will be a matter of public record.”
Harry was shaking his head now, partly in disbelief. He obviously couldn’t wrap his brain around the fact that Draco simply couldn’t apparate.
“Tell me, then.” Harry looked him in the eye. “Now that your wedding to Shira is off, do you still want to convert?”
Draco stole a glance at his father, but he was still glowering at the head of the table. If he was impressed, he wasn't showing it.
Draco snorted. “I know about two particular, quite eccentric Victorian Goths who are into BDSM. How well would that go over?”
Narcissa bit back a smile. Oh, to be twenty again. “That’s true,” she acknowledged. “But you’ve always brought out the worst in each other.”
“You know what I mean.” Malfoy paused to grunt. “Ironically, my parents always considered that sort of thing to be a muggle problem. We, as more advanced beings, don’t judge wizards by their skin colour or religion.”
After a few seconds of squirming, Draco complied. Harry was still holding him by the scruff of his neck as he became a twitchy human instead of a twitchy ferret. A twitchy human in silk pajamas, no less.
"Harry . . . ." Draco sighed and leaned down to kiss him—another gentle, chaste kiss. "There. I can behave myself."
“And, really, me and Bill are the ones who have the most reason to kick the ferret’s arse. Out of my family, I mean. And you—”
They were at the Vue Cinema near King's Cross, figuring out what to see. Harry raised his eyebrows at Draco's choice. "Um,
"I look forward to it." The words were perfectly polite, and Draco mostly hid his nervousness as he accepted the handshake. Then he turned to Ron and Hermione. “Would you two mind following me upstairs?”
“Okay.” Harry blushed, but managed a small smile as well. “That wasn't a proposal. Not yet. But you're willing to marry Shira, and you're not—um, you're only friends, right? It would be like me marrying Hermione.”
Harry reached out and put a hand on his shoulder. “You've got a good heart. You know that, don't you?”
“Shhh.” Draco licked his lips in anticipation. “You've made it clear to everyone that you won't allow your humble servant here to enter an arranged marriage.”
“One might ask,” Lucius said dryly, “why Mr. Potter should feel he has the right to interfere with any part of your life.”
A small, detestable part of Draco—the part of him that still felt like an insecure, jealous fifth year—understood that and even sympathised. But for the most part he was simply grateful to Harry.
But Ron held onto the back of his neck, despite all of Draco's squirming and wriggling, and brought him in closer to his chest. “Easy, Ferret,” he whispered. “I think this will all go better if you stay right here and stick with your animagus form.”
Draco's eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Is this about me being a ferret? That's still not old for you?"
“No.” Draco hesitated. “Actually . . . possibly? In a quite technical sense, as I can’t see how it matters now, legally speaking.”
“That might break a few statutes, yes. But Aunt Bella said if such a muggle existed, she would would wager her inheritance that a wizarding expert in legilimency wouldn’t be able to penetrate his mind. Not without permission.”
“No, but Hermione thinks you’ve got a good eye for detail. And you do have a decent brain.” Ron kept his hand on Malfoy’s arm as he guided them both into the courtyard. “Ever thought about becoming an analyst? Someone’s got to sift through all the evidence and intelligence we collect.”
Well, there was nothing for it. He’d have to ring Draco back and apologise for the teasing. Then he would have to find out what happened and calm his lover down a bit.
"Yeah, there is." Harry looked him in the eyes, trying to disguise how nervous he was. "If you're serious about all this . . . ."
But she would not let that bother her. No one knew they were coming to Hogwarts, and the school was well-protected. Besides, she knew the job Ron had signed on for, and she was determined not to become too worried for him. Not after everything they had already survived.
“Why not? It’s been a few years since Malfoy and I have seen each other—you should introduce me properly to your pet.”
Draco bit him again in response, sparking yet another wrestling match between them. Which ended in a win-win: Harry might have out-wrestled his boyfriend, but Draco seemed pretty happy to be pinned beneath him. Happy enough to kiss him soundly.
Draco, meanwhile, did not look much impressed. “It’s not my fault you haven’t initiated your lessons. And that lack of lessons has nothing to do with you trying to barge into a private memory of mine.”
"It's not what you think. He wasn't destroying their bridges or using them for target practice. It's all about muggle finances, actually."
"How about I let her know that you and I are dating? I reckon she'll be fine with that, as long as I haven't interrupted one of her potion experiments."
“Of course they did!” Hermione seemed impatient now. “Perhaps not physically, but they pressured him to conform to their warped prejudices, didn’t they? And to their ridiculous ideas of what it means to be a pure-blood and a Malfoy. And they bound him to Voldemort! Really, Narcissa should have run away with Draco to the continent or to America before she let him take the Dark Mark.”
Granger, meanwhile, was setting down her briefcase and pulling a pile of paperwork out. “I think I’ll go down to the dining room to work on this. Draco, there’s another article in there about you.”
“Anyway,” Ron continued as he stripped down to his boxers, “Percy kept going on about Malfoy. It’s as if he’s forgotten all about how he betrayed us himself, how he made our mum cry, and how he turned on Harry. He was an absolute ass for years.”
Harry was having a hard time parsing through Draco’s emotions now. He could feel them just fine, but he couldn’t name them. Draco seemed to be somewhere between stunned and contemplative as he tried to absorb everything Benjamin was telling him.
He could almost hear Draco shrugging. "Why not? I'd be exchanging a name that's hated throughout our little world for one that's adored. The advantage would be all mine."
"Nothing." Harry closed his eyes as Draco rubbed a soothing ointment into his shoulders. "Your hands feel amazing. Keep going, please."
“You feel it?” Draco whispered. “The pain, the shock? I always thought you couldn’t feel pain once the shock took over. But, trust me, I felt every vicious slice . . . .”
Worse, Harry paid for said technology with muggle money. He had a legal muggle identity, after all, and apparently a muggle bank account for such things, fed by the wizarding fortune his parents left him. Which meant that he was forever at the mercy of Gringotts’ exchange rates. Draco would have to teach him a better way to manage his finances.
“But I know that memory was about apparating.” Harry placed his hands on Draco’s knees. “And about landing somewhere you didn’t want to be.”
On the other hand, Saint Potter here was the one who had risked his neck to save him, not Robards or Shacklebolt. And Potter wielded considerable influence. No one had forgotten his status as saviour.
“Of course not!” Draco rolled his eyes. “I don’t think he had eyes for anyone, even with my Aunt Bella throwing herself at him. Not even sure he had the proper organs in that magically reconstructed body of his.”
“Yes.” Kreacher paused to shudder. “But . . . it’s not fit for wizards. And Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley spend most of their free time here.”
“Do I know that one?” Harry was smiling at Draco as he spoke. Draco’s ferret eyes couldn’t quite see the smile, but he could hear it and smell it.
Potter grimaced. "They must have temporarily charmed the scent out of the petrol; I didn't notice it at first. And I wasn't expecting a muggle bomb. But Draco and I got out."
Draco's chief weapon, really, had always been words. He'd always had a clever, cutting tongue. And a cruel one. In fact, the lyrics of one particularly insulting and ironic song were no doubt his brainchild.
Harry treated him to a playful punch on the shoulder. “I was. I’m not anymore. In fact, I wish I were experienced enough to step into Robard’s shoes now. Assuming he is forced to resign.”
“Yes, counting breaths. My occlumency is a little better now. But my legilimency is patchy at best. We don’t spend as much time on it as you’d think. Veritaserum is more reliable in the interrogation room.”
Draco swallowed. He couldn’t imagine wanting to be inside that warped, sadistic mind. “Fuck, Harry!”
Narcissa bit back a sigh. Of course Lucius’s first instinct was to antagonise the boy. “Why don’t we all sit down so you can tell us what this is about.” She was impressed by the evenness of her tone; really, she was quite good at keeping hostilities to a minimum. “Shall we summon an elf for refreshments?”
"I still think you've both lost your minds." Granger slammed her coffee mug down on the long dining room table with such force that Draco was amazed the oak didn't crack.
Draco smiled. He loved everything about the Strand, even though he’d never been to the Strand proper. ‘His’ Strand was an annex on Fulton and Gold.
"Rescuing you—that was all because of Harry," Granger added. "When he heard you screaming, he couldn't leave you like that. And we . . . we just followed him."
"You might grow tired of my snark." Draco resumed the massage yet again. "And you'll have to go back to work eventually, you know."
Harry stared at her and then, despite everything, bit back a grin. Apparently Toffee liked attention and praise as much as Draco did.
How much did human scents change? Surely Ronald Weasley had never had such a relaxed air back at Hogwarts. He’d always been an easy target for ridicule, thanks to his hypersensitivity about . . . well, everything: his family’s poverty, his mediocre skill in Quidditch, and his general sense of inferiority.
"Why not?" What did he have against Gringotts? Harry hoped he wasn't in for a lecture about the evils of the gold standard or the silver standard or whatever it was, because it would go straight over his head.
Meanwhile, it was Ron’s turn to raise his eyebrows. “Why, Shira? The Malfoys are all about pure-blood supremacy. Except for this one now.”
Harry tried to imagine Draco’s introduction to a muggle-friendly way of life and really, really wished he’d been there. “Bit of a learning curve?”
They lapsed into silence. For a few minutes, all Harry could hear was the ticking of the ghastly old clock that he kept meaning to give away. Or destroy. Or otherwise dispose of.
Draco took a seat on the bed. "That's as good a word as any. And that's my piece, actually. It's a Ruvein Rubin."
“Stop!” Harry clenched his fists, but kept them glued to his sides. “I don’t care about your fucking password or your fucking security. I’m not going to say that word again.”
There was a certain bitterness in her tone. Draco understood why, and suddenly found himself wishing for his father's skill in networking.
“Huh.” Harry bit his lip. “I know I’m going to sound conceited, but I have to ask: Voldemort was obsessed with me. And you knew me better than anyone else on his side. I mean, not that you wanted to be on his side by the time he was living in Malfoy Manor, but—”
He shook himself. Harry was still staring at him with that intense gaze—though, to do him justice, it wasn’t judgmental or prying. It was more affectionate and genuinely curious.
He stopped stroking Draco and just rested his hand on top of his head. "I'm glad," Harry managed. "That's why we're doing this, isn't it?"
Granger gasped. Draco just stood there stupidly—but he should have known. Of course Hagrid blamed him for the near-destruction of his hut. It might be a wretched hovel, but it was his. And there was no one else to blame; Rowle had done the deed, but Draco had smuggled him into Hogwarts.
Hermione risked a smile. “Then I won’t add to them. But Ron is right; we know what real evil is. You were never that—except under duress.”
Harry didn't leap to any ludicrous conclusions. He knew this wasn't some long lost relative of Umbridge's. One thing he had learnt as an auror was that there were only so many faces in the world. They repeated endlessly, in slight variations.
A distinct popping noise interrupted Harry’s thoughts. Kreacher was suddenly standing near the bed, and a large, multi-level, ferret cage was equally unexpectedly tucked into the corner of the room.
The elderly elf nodded. “Kreacher knows house elves from frum families, Master Draco.” And without another word, he disapparated.
"You don't have to bow and scrape to us to stay in our good graces," Granger explained kindly, as if Draco hadn't figured out Ron's meaning on his own.
But he didn’t like the chivalrous way Malfoy offered Hermione his arm. Or the way Hermione took it, rolling her eyes but smiling at the same time.
Instead Harry turned back to Toffee. “Would you go and help Kreacher, please? He might need a hand with breakfast.”
“Perfect!” Jamie continued to ignore Shira's objections as she and Harry exchanged information. After a promise to contact him with flight details, she signed off.
“Austere instead of extravagant. Think Napoleonic: a few bold, rich colours set off by plenty of white. Military touches here and there. Lots of wood showing, a bit of marble, and perhaps some well-polished brass.”
Strange. He had only meant to be polite to Hagrid; he hadn’t rehearsed an apology. But Hagrid deserved at least this much from him. Not that the man showed any reaction.
"I was on the wrong side of that war," he said at last. "I went in there to—well, I didn't actually want to . . . fuck, it doesn't matter now. But you had no reason to go back for us."
“Okay.” Harry took a deep breath. “That's fair. But at least tell me this: do you want us to work out? Do you want to be with me long-term?”
“What? No, of course not.” Harry shook his head as he absently stroked Draco’s back. “He's an animagus now. And he's been undercover for the Ministry for—I don't even know how long. And Robards left him to die.”
Harry cursed his luck as he stepped through the window of the red-bricked, condemned department store that served as a gateway to St. Mungo's. He had all but crashed into the towering figure of Hagrid.
Didn't matter. Malfoy was willing to stop working undercover because of it, so Harry was willing to play along.
Draco’s eyes, Hermione noticed, were set resolutely on the screen. He was keen to keep the conversation focused on the flash drive.
Draco laughed. “No. She's a fierce atheist. She likes the customs, though. And she lives to deconstruct and critique all the ‘patriarchal idiocy,’ as she calls it, in the Torah.”
Harry sighed yet again, wondering what his former nemesis had in mind. "Go on, Malfoy. Do your worst."
“Oh, he’d have done it, even if he had to work up the nerve! You know what he is. Look what he almost had done to Buckbeak!”
Fuck, fuck, fuck. His hands were clammy. His face felt hot and sweaty. And his stomach was churning.
Harry could hear the challenge in his voice, but he didn’t rise to it. He already knew he was going to win this battle too, so there was no need. “Is it all right to have more than one style?” he asked instead. “Because I don’t care what you do with this room. We never eat in here.”
Funny how Malfoy’s words had burned so much at the time. Now the memory only brought a wry smile to Harry’s face.
Harry caught both easily and grinned. “You’ve got yours on already, I see. This is a synagogue, I take it?”
Harry’s voice was even. Hermione wished she could pretend that was a good thing, but it might have been better if Harry simply exploded. He and Hagrid would soon get over a shouting match, but this calm anger on Harry’s part was something different.
The clock kept ticking. It must have disturbed Draco, because he finally piped up again. “I’m planning to thank you for rescuing me. Even if you were stupid enough to risk your career for it.”
There were students all around, but none seemed to pose a threat. Some were standing in small groups, complaining about this or that class. Others were sitting solo by the fountain, pouring over their textbooks. And a few of the younger ones were cross-legged on the ground, snatching games of gobstones.
“Yeah.” Harry sighed. “He would just come at me with legilimency—he didn’t explain things first. He kept telling me to clear my mind, assuming I knew how to do that—”
He was obviously being as vague as possible, but Draco decided not to push him. Harry was too skittish at the moment. “All right. But whatever this link was, it didn’t constitute proper training in legilimency?”
"Can't. My father volunteered to drive Draco to Heathrow himself and pick up the girls with him. Said he'd like a chat with Draco on the way there. Just the two of them."
Anyway, it was a good question; usually Ron and Draco played on the floor of the sitting room, each of them sprawled by the fireplace.
But Harry ignored him in favour of stroking the owl. “Sorry, but I don’t have any treats on hand. I’ll make it up to you next time.” He paused to shoot a wicked grin at Draco. “And no, I won’t feed my pet to you.”
"Well, Master Draco here wants to sign over his personal fortune to me. Kindly explain why he shouldn't do that."
“Why would you drive in Manhattan? And why is Benjamin letting you drive his car?” Draco’s tone was turning sour now. “He never let me drive it.”
"I don't care if he goes to sleep!" That was Ron in the background. "I just want him to give me the phone and then go upstairs so you and I can have a word in private."
"They're behind us, so you gained a few hours. How are you meeting Shira and Jamie? They ought to be leaving for London soon."
He wanted to hear something about how clever muggles were, no doubt, but Draco was not about to give him that satisfaction. "I think . . . I think Bridget Jones is more gainfully employed than I am at present."
“Shhh.” Draco was behind him now, wrapping his arms around him. And, all right, the sudden warmth felt good. A tiny bit of Harry’s anger dissipated as he leaned back against his lover.
“Oh no?” Draco snorted. “He loves having power over me. You think he’s above getting a little revenge?”
“Oh, I don’t have much more to say. Except that he really should have been sorted into Slytherin, don’t you think? He was ruthless in his quest to destroy the dark lord. And it was an ambitious quest as well.”
Draco was pretty sure Granger agreed with him on these points. Someday, when she was out of earshot of both Harry and her husband, he would have to ask her.
Harry was falling again, but there was no swirl of thoughts and memories this time, and he landed gently on his feet—in the middle of a muggle office.
“Miss Skeeter,” Malfoy drawled in that posh, bored tone of his, “Harry has saved my life before, as I’m sure you know. It was during the war, at great risk to himself, when we were on opposite sides.”
"Nothing." Harry kept stroking him. "Just wondering what it's like for you. Being an animagus, I mean."
That, to Harry's astonishment, was the right thing to say. Ron let out a short but genuine laugh. "Yeah."
Of course, Draco had been canny enough, back at Hogwarts, to guess that Harry was unhappy with the Dursleys. His arrows had certainly struck home when he mocked Harry for spending Christmas at Hogwarts, correctly assuming that Harry was unwanted by his family.
He transformed in response . . . and ended up straddling Harry on the chesterfield. Draco tried to wipe the smirk off his mouth as he gazed down at his saviour, but that proved impossible.
Since they left the bedroom door open, Ron waited until he heard their footfall start down the stairs before speaking up again. “So, uh, we hadn’t met Toffee yet either.”
But Hagrid had already turned back to Harry with something halfway between a laugh and a snort. “I saw the Prophet this morning. No need to drag your new servant everywhere, is there? Not that I can’t find a few chores for him. But enough talk! Come in, you three.”
Harry would go on to marry someone appropriately heroic and Draco—well, Draco would do his best to be a decent husband and loving father. And he would settle for whatever scraps Harry would spare him.
"JFK." Draco scowled. "That's unacceptable. Write back. Tell him you'll need a different flight. One that lands in Newark."
Privately, Draco doubted that. That oafish half-giant rarely seemed to put much planning into his lessons or exams. It was more a matter of his students surviving whatever dangerous monster had most recently captured his fancy.
So he and the holy scarhead dragged out the muggle laptop again. Fortunately—or unfortunately, rather—Harry did have both a webcam and internet access, and both worked despite the magic at use in the house. Damn all these new spells and wards that were making it easier and easier to use muggle technology.
Jamie gave Ron a curious look. “I’ve been on Draco’s side. Hermione has argued on both. But you’ve managed to keep out of this.”
“I know.” Harry swallowed. “Draco—look, just tell me the truth. Robards is the one threatening you this time. Not your life, but with something, right?”
George seemed to find that hilarious. He kept laughing and laughing, sliding down against the wall until he was sitting on the floor, almost hyperventilating.
He could almost hear Draco frowning at that. "Yes and no. Remember, in America it was illegal to marry a muggle until fairly recently. There's a reason there are so many pure bloods over there."
“I know.” He walked over and knelt in front of Draco. “I didn’t mean to pry. I just . . . I caught a whiff of that memory and then I couldn’t let it go. And I wasn’t trying to puzzle out your password or anything like that.”
Hagrid had no notion of how a professor should deal with children or teenagers; perhaps that was the problem. Draco had watched him treat Harry like a friend rather than a student for years. Ditto with Granger and Weasley.
All smoke and mirrors from the powers that be at the ministry. Malfoy must have seemed the ideal choice to infiltrate a group of neo-Death Eaters. He was a former Death Eater himself, after all. And Harry knew he was skilled in occlumency.
There was a long moment of silence. “Dunno,” he said at last. “But I already hate being the boyfriend of one.”
Shira cut in with a regrettably brilliant impersonation of Draco. “Saint Bleeding Potter. All right, he saved us all, I’ll give him that. And he’s fucking gorgeous—but just tell me it hasn’t gone straight to his head, what with all the crowds following him around just begging to lick those atrocious trainers of his—”
“I have, actually. Auror business took me into one—we were under cover, of course. But it wasn’t as large or so high up!” He paused. “Was this a first for you?”
And asking for advice was an effective way to compliment someone. Harry would accuse him of sucking up if he understood Draco’s thought process, as would Weasley. Neither of them had mastered the skill, hence they denigrated it.
“Good. It should be better known. It seems more real than the made up one.” Harry took a deep breath as he stared back down at the floor. “So I walked into the forest and . . . and I died. But then I was given a choice. Riddle was still a threat. I hadn’t destroyed the horcrux in Nagini. So I was allowed to, er, come back.”
Harry and Ron were both standing up, exchanging glances. Ron pulled Draco out of his shirt, but kept a firm grip on him.
“Oh, right.” Harry managed a half-hearted attempt, though. Well, he managed to lift one arm enough to give Malfoy a pathetic little push. That didn’t work at all, so he just rested his other arm on Malfoy’s back.
“You were forced to become one before you were even of age!” Harry stopped and took a deep breath. “Besides, the war’s over now. Hagrid knows that. So will you come?”
Draco stared down at the chessboard. The pieces were all stilled at the moment, no longer attempting to lop off each other’s heads. And their injuries from this last game had magically healed.
Draco swore under his breath. “Stop making me out to be more than I am. You're only going to be disappointed.”
Draco climbed off of him and held out his hand. "Then take me to this muggle cinema. Even a platonic date ought to lead us somewhere."
Harry bit his lip. It was funny to think of the elder Malfoys with any muggle technology, but he didn't want to offend Draco by laughing. "Well, er, perhaps we can purchase new mobiles for them at Christmas. Or for their birthdays or something."
"I think they take a pinprick of blood from circumcised converts." Shira bit her lip. "Maybe you can find a Reform rabbi who won't ask for any of that."
“But that was never my motivation—” she broke off and bit her lip. She couldn’t read Draco at all right now.
“Yes.” To Harry’s astonishment, Draco’s face lit up. “I’m strongly tempted to go for a true rococo feel—this house would take to it perfectly, don’t you think? Just look at the chandelier above us. There would be brilliant lighting throughout this room if we restored it and fixed the mirrors, which are obviously rococo themselves. And imagine a toile de Jouy wall covering. There’s hope even for this table, honestly . . . .”
Draco fell silent for a long moment. Weasley had a far-away look now, and small wonder. The war had certainly not been easy on him or his family.
But Shira had somehow accounted for that. “Hagrid, you must know London. Please take me away from this place—I hate hospitals. And I need coffee that’s blacker than a dementor’s soul, or I will die. I will literally die.”
Harry looked him over. Really looked him over. There was something about how intense his eyes were as he kept examining Harry’s hand, as if he was peering at a precious gem that didn’t belong to him. A gem that he would soon have to return.
Draco smiled at that, apparently forgetting how annoyed he was with his lover. “No. I imagine they're tutored in magic at home—and I don’t think they even call it magic. But I reckon Kreacher knows who to speak with.”
Ron's voice brought her back to the present. “All right,” he was saying, with a grin directed at Shira, “I’ll bite. What does kasher mean?”
"Oh." Harry felt his face turn hot with embarrassment as he turned back to the note. "Er, looks like John F. Ken—"
Harry felt another irrational urge to contradict him, but he had enough experience with house elves to know that there was at least a little truth in his words. “That doesn’t bother you?”
"I might just," Draco retorted, following him out of the room. "The Prophet has been fawning over your arse for far too long now."
Suddenly Weasley was talking, and Draco felt his brain snap back to the present. “Look, Harry,” he was saying, “I’ll walk Malfoy up to the castle, yeah?”
“No.” Draco bit back another smile before he continued. “Severus Snape was a master of occlumency, though. To have studied under him—Harry, you should be an expert!”
Draco managed a nod. “All right. Someday maybe you’ll tell me the full story—everything that’s left out of all these new history books.”
“I was too fast for you, and I’m not sure you hated me enough for it to work anyway.” He paused. “But earlier that year—remember when you paralysed me on the train, stamped on my face and threw my invisibility cloak over me?”
“Of course you haven’t.” Surprisingly, Draco sounded more affectionate than annoyed. “Do so as soon as we hang up, please. You have your auror robes, but they probably won’t be necessary; the American wizarding community doesn’t go in for the old style. Not in Manhattan, at any event. Most of them dress as if they work on Wall Street.”
“No idea, Potter. But that’s how important meditation is to occlumency. And she said that even whilst believing that muggles are far beneath us.”
This time the elf did apparate. Harry shook his head, and then climbed up to the suite of rooms they’d set aside for Ron and Hermione. He rushed through their sitting room, but came to an abrupt stop at their bedroom door. He couldn’t just barge in, so he knocked.
There was a slight hesitation before Draco answered. “You’re comfortable with them? They’re not like the Weasleys . . . .”
He was ready, he supposed, yet he suspected there were other memories locked away here that were more important. Memories that might even shed light on why Draco could no longer apparate or why he thought he couldn’t cast a patronus.
“So what does Draco want with Ron and Hermione?” George persisted. “What’s he showing them upstairs?”
"Should we stay in tonight?" Harry asked suddenly. "I did promise you that second date. You know, a muggle cinema?"
He shook himself, and suddenly he was back in the offices of—what was this company called? Cantor Fitzgerald, right. For a moment, Harry was back in his own head. But he closed his eyes as another memory tugged at him; he could feel . . . Merlin, so many things at once. His head was swimming. But there was a warm hand on his shoulder, helping him find his centre again.
Draco grimaced. "She's right. Don’t worry, Harry. You’ll still meet them. They were planning to stay for at least a fortnight."
“Yeah.” Harry favoured him with a soft smile this time. “I don’t regret it, believe me. Whatever the fallout is. Anyway, it will probably be worse for Robards: the ministry is launching an investigation.”
“But he stood trial,” Hermione said. “And then he was blackmailed into serving as a spy for the aurors. I believe he’s paid his debt to society.”
“Oh.” Harry blinked at the thought of Draco or Narcissa reading books like that, and then burst out laughing too. Only for a moment, though, before remembering why he was here. “How do I access your memories? I thought the surface ones would be obvious.”
To Ron’s surprise, Harry grinned again. “He's welcome to use me for that, but right now all the Malfoys want to keep our relationship out of the papers.”
Granger sighed, presumably because she worried for Harry and Ron too. Draco twisted himself toward her and nestled against her tee shirt, perilously near her chest.
“Shame that Labour seems so unassailable right now.” Draco put down his fork with half the food left on his plate—he didn’t seem to have much appetite tonight.
But Draco squared his shoulders instead. “Harry, if you and my aunt are willing, I’d be honoured to meet them both.”
He was still furious, Harry reckoned, but that nod was enough. Harry apparated without another word.
The door opened and Draco stepped inside. He hadn't changed for bed yet either. "I think you'll find some joggers and tee-shirts in that wardrobe. Or proper pajamas, if you prefer. I'm still taller than you, but something ought to fit—oh, like that water colour, do you?"
The old house elf trailed after him. “It did not belong to Kreacher’s late Mistress, whose taste was all elegance—”
Draco's grey eyes widened. He sat up, drew one knee to his chest and then reluctantly shook his head. "If you are, I'm not ready to find out. Not here."
Meanwhile, though, Ron rather liked giving Draco orders, even if that made him a bit of a bastard. And that made Harry a bit of a bastard too, didn’t it, considering how much he liked having Draco obey him. But Harry was entitled. Besides, Harry lived up to his part of the bargain: he was determined to protect Draco and his family. And he was determined to build a happy life for himself and Draco. It was a fair deal.
“But you—you’re the one who’s afraid this won’t work! If you already . . . I mean, why do you keep trying to slow us down?”
Harry kissed him. “I’ll miss you too. Behave for Ron and Hermione. And don’t bite anyone in your ferret form! I don’t want to hear about anyone else’s hand bleeding.”
“There are more important things to discuss now, little brother. Harry, let Malfoy go. We’ll behave, I promise.”
Ron bristled. “Which is it, Dad? Are you upset that we’re on friendly terms with him or upset that we’re ordering him around?”
Weasley, meanwhile, was pestering Potter again. “Come on, Harry, what did you do? And how much are we going to have to hide from Robards? And what possessed you to get a look-alike Malfoy ferret?”
Not that Ron minded ordering Draco about. And not that he hadn’t done so already. But he shouldn’t have done it in front of his father—especially when there was such bad blood between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy. Ron almost wouldn’t blame Draco if that perfect sneer of his crossed his face.
But Harry didn't address that straight away. It was probably better to keep Draco talking about other topics for a bit.
He paused and turned to Draco's mother. "And Draco is all right, Narcissa. And I'm going to make sure he stays that way. He'll never have to work for Robards again."
And with that, Harry made good his escape. He owed Shira for this intervention, but he pushed any fascinating but preposterous thoughts of her upcoming conversation with Hagrid from his mind.
“I didn’t say the memory happened here, Potter. Just that I’ve hidden it here. Pay attention!” Harry could sense him rolling his eyes. “Fuck, no wonder Snape couldn’t teach you anything.”
“Come on, then.” Harry kissed him again, but Draco scarcely seemed to notice. “You’ve got a mobile, haven’t you? I do own one, but I don’t use it much, and I don’t even know if it will make international calls—”
Draco studied his bare chest and then gave a nod of satisfaction. "Very much. The aurors keep you fit. Here, let me help you."
“I haven’t said anything yet, but I think I’ll have to go.” He shifted to look her in the eye. “That doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten what happened to you at Malfoy Manor.”
“Look, whatever you decide about all this”—Harry waved his other hand, presumably indicating not only the shul but the whole question of conversion—”is all right with me. I’ll support you.”
He woke up the second time because of an apologetic little tap on his shoulder. This time Harry sat straight up, wide-eyed, and grabbed for his wand.
Draco stared at him for a moment, as if weighing something in his head. Finally he shrugged again. “I can’t apparate.”
“He said so. Said he wouldn’t touch Ginny no matter how beautiful she was. Or words to that effect.”
“We aren’t boyfriends,” Harry said at last. “And if we were, I wouldn’t want to be his bit on the side while he got entangled in an arranged marriage.”
"Probably not. Meanwhile—well, I think Hermione's going to want to talk with you about that flash drive too." Harry paused to chew on his lip. "Want to tell me anything more about it?"
"It went, ah, mostly well." Potter paused to run his fingers through that impossible hair of his, mussing it up even more than normal. "Let's find some place to talk."
“But—” Harry’s brain was working furiously now. “Why didn’t you practise after seventh year? You spent all that time in New York with a wizarding family!”
“Yeah. In five or six days, I suppose.” He hesitated, his eyes still earnest. “Do you consider Moan—er, Myrtle a friend? Is that why you insisted on seeing her?”
“Don’t you dare be reasonable about a thing like that! I don’t want you hurling yourself into danger, not worrying about me just because you think I’ll live happily ever after with your friends. Or with any other decent person. I won't."
“But I can’t remember a time when you didn’t have either Granger or Weasley supporting you. And mostly you had both. And sometimes you had the whole fucking school on your side.” Draco could feel a hint of affection creeping into his voice. “In any case, you were always more powerful than me.”
The sneer stayed in place. "True. But I reckon Granger will keep you from becoming a proper tyrant." He raised his eyebrows again. "So are we sorted?"
Yeah, he did. Only this wasn’t just about Dobby any more. This was about Draco now too, and what Harry needed to understand about him in order to help their relationship survive.
“Well, um, I might have suggested they spend more time together. Draco could help Hagrid with some chores after all, seeing as how he'd enjoy the manual labour . . . .”
But Hagrid didn’t move. Draco couldn’t tell if he was hesitant or implacable, but he knew it didn’t matter.
Harry wasn’t impressed, although he didn’t seem to be in any pain. “No nipping. And you are a suck up.”
"No, but I know what it means." His eyes were glued to the mark. "And it's not that I don't care—believe me, I do. I hate that his mark is on you. But it doesn't make me want to break up with you. It . . . fuck, I just want to remind you that you're mine now."
Harry opened his mouth to object, but wisely thought better of it. “You’re right,” he said at last. “I won’t.”
Harry held his wand firmly, savouring the way the holly hummed to life in his hand. A zillion dirty jokes about wands leapt into his brain, but he summoned enough discipline to dismiss them all. Legilimency was a serious business; he didn’t want any harm coming to Draco as he delved into his memories.
“No. And, actually, Snape tried to teach me occlumency to counteract it. That was back in, um, fifth year, I think.”
“Of course. I just wanted your fucking attention, Potter. And I never cared about getting Dobby’s attention, so I never treated him the way I treated you.”
Hermione was almost to the top of the stairs now. And from the sound of her, she seemed to be chiding her companions.
Weasley chose that moment to stand up. “Okay, this is starting to sound like a private conversation—”
"With due respect, Granger, I think it is the point." Draco quirked his eyebrows at her. "Potter and I are just negotiating an agreement between two consenting adults. There's nothing legally or magically binding about it."
“Blaise’s chief requirement is that his partner be as beautiful as he is. And, trust me, he won’t miss an opportunity to shag someone who shagged the Holy Saviour of the wizarding world.”
Merlin, that was tempting. Harry didn't jump to agree, though, for a number of reasons. "But you love your parents. You love your family."
On the the other hand, there was no petting and soothing afterward in a human salon. No Potter to apologise profusely, scratch behind his ears, and kiss the top of his head. No Weasley to smile down at him, utterly charmed no matter how much he tried to feign indifference.
But he couldn’t find it. He tried counting his breaths, but it wouldn’t work. Nothing worked, he kept plummeting . . . until he came crashing to a halt, landing on some kind of flooring that was hard and unforgiving.
He tried to figure out if he was bitter about that, if he resented Harry for putting him so far in his debt. Fuck, he ought to have enough pride to be bitter. But at the moment, Draco just felt relief.
He left off ‘for anyone but Harry,’ but Ron still grunted at the unspoken words. Then he changed the subject. “You’re serious about seeing McGonagall, yeah?”
“Tell me something, Harry.” Draco still didn’t look up. “What are you looking for? What good do you expect to come from this conversation?”
So he had found out already, and of course he didn’t understand why it was necessary. The boy hadn’t a shred of political sense.
“What can you do here?” he demanded over his mobile. “The healers haven’t woken Father yet. He’s still in that magical stasis.”
Benjamin was silent for a moment, his face grim. “It doesn’t matter. Yeah, you should regret the stuff you did. But the regret, by itself, doesn’t help anyone. It’s not productive.”
Soon Harry was sitting at the dining room table, connecting to Shira. Draco didn’t bother to warn Harry what to expect—he’d find out soon enough. The restrained goth style of that one photograph simply did not do her justice.
Harry also remembered the intense satisfaction he had felt when Lucius was sentenced. But the fact that Azkaban was such a hellhole—and it still was, even without the dementors—didn’t sit as well now.
But his father waved that concern away. “Ron, I’m not sorry to see you two make peace with an old enemy.”
All right. Harry had to chuckle at his rough mixture of sincerity and exaggeration. But he still didn’t think Draco had a right to posthumously take Dumbledore to task.
"Well, that's reassuring. You also have an appointment with Robards today. I want to be there when he thanks you for your services. Then we'll go register you as an animagus—you don't have an excuse to keep that hidden anymore."
He scoffed. "Salazar, Potter. You're so naive. I know his contempt for muggles and mudbloods—er, muggle-borns—is rubbish. And I don't have the stomach for his brand of cruelty. But we're still alike."
Ron sat in silence as Harry paced the room, filling him in on Draco's almost-arranged marriage into the Baumgarten family and the fact that Harry had forbidden it.
“Don’t thank me yet. I don’t know how my parents will react. Ginny won’t like it either. And Bill—he might forgive Malfoy for letting Greyback into Hogwarts, but Fleur never will.”
Draco smirked. “For starters, I had to make sure it was safe to spend a considerable amount of time as a ferret. It’s a very different world view; I don’t want it fucking up my human brain. And, you know, seeing as how you’ve always wanted a pet to cuddle with . . .”
“No, let me finish. Malfoy’s parents brought him up all wrong. They indoctrinated him into all that pure-blood superiority and Death Eater bullshit. But Percy was brought up the right way. So what’s his excuse for siding with a corrupt ministry all that time—against his own family?”
Potter didn't even blink at that epithet, or the sarcastic tone. "We do need to talk with him. Come on, Malfoy. The wards won't let you apparate in or out of here alone, but I can take us."
First thing: slow his breaths. Allow Draco’s memories, thoughts, feelings and impressions to fill his mind.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up from across the table. Harry felt a twinge of guilt; he doubted Draco wanted his father to know just how much he had revealed about his family. But there was no way Harry could resist goading Lucius. Not after everything the man had done.
“I’m glad. Maybe that’s why your room feels so different from the rest of the manor. Much less, um—”
“No,” Draco continued. “It was a Death Eater higher in Voldemort’s favour than my parents were. He agreed to protect them and me in exchange for—”
“The media swarmed us.” Harry was rolling his eyes. “Mostly reporters from the Daily Prophet—we were all advised to work from home today. And tomorrow. And probably for the rest of the week.”
“Right,” Potter admitted. “And I didn't even smell the petrol at first. Not that the petrol—I mean, I think there was an actual bomb too. Look, Malfoy can tell us more about the whole operation.”
"Salazar help me." But Draco was more smiling than sneering now. "That only applies if you've kept up your part of the deal."
“Oh, don’t worry, ‘Mione,” George was saying as he pushed past her to lead the way into the sitting room. There was a distinct laugh in his voice as he continued. “We won’t harm Malfoy; any pet of Harry’s is a pet of ours.”
“Oh. No, that’s a man and a woman, actually. Married couple related to Shira. I think Noa must be a girl’s name too.”
“Good.” Draco was still leaning alongside of him, so close that his breath was warm against Harry's neck. “That's sorted.”
Harry knew he was at fault for prying, but he couldn’t stop a bit of anger from boiling up. “You were plotting to assassinate Dumbledore. To let those Death Eaters into Hogwarts. That was my fucking business!”
"Oh, you're more than welcome. My parents will be counting on it." His voice was dry now. "They'll be counting on the six of us going out to dinner, I'm sure."
But Draco surprised him. He wasn't sneering and he didn't seem upset. He wasn’t wearing that sucking-up expression either. Instead, he was giving Ron a measuring look—as if deciding, once and for all, if Ron were someone worth obeying.
The two men shared a look that startled Harry. He hadn’t realised, until now, that this jealousy of him was something they had in common. And he had never imagined them bonding over it.
Ron had made a half-hearted attempt to toss Draco out on his furry white arse, but . . . all right. He was adorable, and Ron was too tired to chase him around the room. So Draco stayed.
Harry turned to find Shira barreling at him. She wrapped him in a bear hug—he could feel every bit of boning in her corset—and then released him to look up at his companion.
They were standing in Harry’s sitting room, all four of them. Harry had greeted Ron and Hermione just like this, holding the ferret’s hand, before launching into a speech about how he and Draco were together now.
Ron shifted to pull her closer. “I like him better all subservient and repentant. Hell, right now I like him better than Percy.”
Harry bit back a grin. They’d both almost gotten themselves blown up right in Surrey. How would the Malfoys react to that? Had they even known about their son’s undercover work?
And Harry knew precisely what the password was now. And, at this moment, he hated Draco for using it.
Harry wasn't sure what more to say. The Draco from back at Hogwarts would have never wanted people to know about the life debt. He'd have seen that as a humiliation.  And maybe that summed up Draco back then. Always worried about the image he projected; always terrified of embarrassing himself or failing his father's expectations. At least until sixth year, when he suddenly had more life and death issues to worry him.
Her forehead crinkled. "So you think you can legally finagle a way to transfer the property to Harry before the Ministry can seize it."
Harry had Draco's shirt open now and was inspecting Draco's chest for himself. But the slices and slashes from that vicious spell were long gone.
Weasley frowned. “Are you sure that's Malfoy? I wouldn't expect him to be so, um, affectionate with you.”
Something about the term 'enemy’ grated on him, even though that was exactly how he had regarded Draco until about a week ago. “We were all just kids.”
“Look, just think it over.” Harry raised both his hands to his lips and kissed them. Which might have been a stupid, over-the-top gesture, but Draco didn’t call him on it. “If you talk that memory out, maybe we’ll discover why you won’t apparate.”
Hermione sensed the awkwardness too. She took a seat on the bed again and gave Ron’s dad a pleading look. “Arthur, I can tell your head is spinning. But you must know that there was nothing untoward happening when you walked in.”
Skeeter pretended to look chagrined. “Of course, Mrs. Granger-Weasley. Perhaps Mr. Potter will tell us instead just why, despite his heroics, he is reportedly assigned to deskwork for the foreseeable future?”
Harry felt a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “You also told me that you hated me for that.”
Draco only cared that he was actually living a long-standing, top secret, shameful dream: kissing Harry-fucking-Potter . . . kissing the man he had once regarded as his worst enemy. The man he had hated for years, with all the passion and loathing and pent-up lust a stupid teenager could muster.
It was a fair point. Especially because Draco belonged to him now, and some twisted, possessive part of Harry believed that he wasn't really a Malfoy anymore.
“So this is where I, er, contemplated a lot of the things I’ve done. And a lot of the things that were done to me. Mostly by other Death Eaters, I mean.”
There was a smirk in Draco's voice as he answered. "You could plan to spank me properly when you get home, instead of teasing me with a smack to my arse here and there."
“All right,” Ron said. “But if you and Malfoy are really together, you're going to have to bring him to the Burrow. You’re still family, you know, so you can’t hide him from us.”
Harry didn't seem to know how to respond, but he was clutching Malfoy's hand. And Malfoy was just standing there, sneering—as if a Weasley’s opinion about their relationship couldn't possibly matter. But he was clutching Harry's hand back, so he wasn't as calm and contemptuous as he was pretending to be.
“You rescued Mr. Malfoy in the line of duty, did you not?” Her eyes lit up in false admiration. “A brave auror pulling an agent out of a fiery trap?”
No, Draco sighed. This was Draco’s memory, Harry told himself again. He couldn’t choose his reactions or change anything; he could only embrace the memory as Draco had experienced it.
After all the noise and hustle of the Cantor Fitzgerald office—and even the noise of Draco’s memories upstairs—the synagogue seemed too quiet. Eerily so. Harry knew what it should be like: he could catch glimpses of Draco’s memories of these hallways. Children weaving in and out of classrooms in chatty gaggles whilst adults—some laughing good-naturedly, others looking harassed and put upon—either supervised or clustered together to discuss committee business.
Draco snorted. "The Prophet will have a field day with that. They'll be eating up this life debt as it is."
Harry reached over and tugged Draco to him, until he could rest his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I'd best keep you there, then.”
But Draco didn’t give them up. He tugged back instead, sparking a wrestling match that Harry won easily. It took all of thirty seconds to pin the git to the bed.
“If you don’t outlive us, he’ll entomb them at Malfoy Manor, of course. After your natural deaths,” Draco clarified. “In the house elf part of the catacombs.”
“You could have had them! You could have had that time in Paris and New York and Buenos Aires and wherever else you went without being blackmailed and without putting your life at risk.”
Shit. What exactly was he including under services? And did Malfoy really consider this a debt to last until one of them was dead?
Right. Settle into a normal conversation first. Perhaps Draco needed time to work up to the real issue.
Ron gulped as he turned to face his father, who was unaccountably standing next to a house elf he’d never seen before. A house elf who looked exceptionally proud of itself—herself? Yes, herself—as if she had just performed some heroic service.
Granger sighed. "Harry would have helped you even if you hadn't agreed to honour this stupid life debt, you know."
After a moment, Draco took it. Not only took it, but pulled Harry into a hug as well. Harry didn’t fight him.
Draco looked to Harry, trying not to let his eyes say ‘I-told-you-so.’ But Harry didn’t notice. He was frozen on the spot, staring after Hagrid. He’d been smiling broadly a few seconds ago, when he knocked, but now that smile faltered.
“You’ll get sacked if you go into his office blazing again.” Draco grinned suddenly and shook his head. “Of course, that might be just as well.”
“What’s wrong, Malfoy?” Harry couldn’t stop the slow, mischievous grin from spreading across his face. “Afraid to drive on the opposite side of the road? If you know how to drive at all, that is.”
“Trust me, I’m not.” His eyes took on a far away look, as if he were lost in a memory. Then he shook his head. “We didn’t work well together. It was partly my fault, because I wanted the connection between Voldemort and me to grow even stronger. I wanted to figure out what he was up to.”
Hagrid's face—well, what Harry could see of it through the beard—turned a startling shade of pink. “Oh, well, you know how the students are at the end of term. Reckon she has her hands full enough.”
Draco nodded and took hold of Harry’s hands. “I’m going to take you into my memories. Recent ones first; you’ll see a swirl of the ones I allow to remain on the surface: the ones I don’t care if anyone penetrates. Then I’ll take you deeper.”
"Never mind. It suits you. And it's iconic now, along with the glasses, so there's no point putting you in lenses either." He paused to pick up Harry's hand, only to release it with a scowl. "You're in desperate need of a manicure. We should see to that today."
“Work here with you?” Suddenly Draco’s voice was dripping with sarcasm. “Think Cantor Fitzgerald will hire me too? My CV is useless here.”
Hagrid looked much struck by that, just as she had intended. This was something Hagrid could understand: the feral and naked fear an animal must feel for its predator.
Harry grinned. "I know. But you'll have to take him as your third, you know, if anything happens to me."
Harry took Draco's wand back for the second duel. The hawthorne with the core of unicorn hair still seemed to recognise him as well. He'd been oddly comfortable using that wand ever since he took it off Draco—and not only because he had carried it against Voldemort.
Shira shrugged. “I don’t think we’d fight about that, but proximity was always going to be an issue. If we go through with the marriage, Jamie and I will have to move to London, or you two will have to move to Hoboken.”
Draco adjusted himself as their pillow talk turned to other matters—largely Ministry matters. They knew nearly everyone of importance personally.
"You're wrong." Harry swallowed. "I mean, there is a part of me that—but it doesn't matter. Everything you just said is wrong."
"You really are home." Ron yawned as he looked Harry up and down. "The Ferret's going to have a fit."
A quite knowledgeable partner, judging by the gentle yet intense pressure of Draco's hands. Harry really did relax, at least a bit, trying to put the whole situation with Robards out of his mind. But just that stray thought caused him to tense up all over again.
Draco caught his breath and glanced at his mother, hoping she had some trick to defuse this situation. But she just shook her head.
Jamie bit her lip in a thoughtful sort of way. “I think I'm on your side, Harry, but we should all discuss it. In person. Would you agree to that?”
“We’re here to keep Draco company whilst Harry’s in New York,” Hermione explained. “The aurors just sent him there as some sort of consultant.”
Hermione sat down behind her desk as Ron took a seat on the edge of it. "Harry," he said, "have you still got a job?"
"Or something." Potter was actually blushing now. "Anyway, I realised that Draco was our agent, and that he was in trouble. Based on the intelligence he had gathered, I traced him to a house in Surrey. I thought I could extract him easily, but—"
He opened his eyes. Stone. He was sprawled on a fucking stone floor. No wonder his body was shrieking in pain.
“But you’re not going to get a baby with his platinum blond hair, Shira,” Jamie pointed out. “Not with your dark hair.”
“No.” Draco rolled his eyes, making it clear that he shouldn't have to state something so obvious. “I want to serve him too. And stay with him for as long as he’ll have me.”
"I'd argue, but I'm more interested in the fact that you just said 'we'—as if you were identifying as part of the ferret population."
“Just what I said. He kept telling me to clear my mind, but he never bothered teaching me any sort of meditation or anything. Didn’t even send me off to the library for a book on it.”
Shira nodded. “It’s really insulting. So she’s not highly motivated to support a traditional pure-blood marriage.”
“Calm down, Harry.” Draco looked amused in a wry and bored way. “Not that I mind being manhandled . . . .”
Draco shifted until he was leaning back against the railing, fully facing Harry. “So why hide the facts? Why allow all the speculation to continue?”
She reminded Harry weirdly of Umbridge. Not in temperment; this woman didn't seem fake or cruel. And though her build was different, she definitely had Umbridge's face. But it was much less toad-like on this lady.
"There's no official exchange rate, so—" Draco broke off. Then he sighed and lowered his voice. "Look, I have plenty of quid. And it's all yours now anyway."
Harry cringed. “Right. Okay, I’m getting up.” He suited his actions to his words as he climbed out of bed and strode toward his wardrobe; might as well pick out his clothes before he treated himself to a shower. But he froze after just two steps—his wardrobe had vanished. The entire piece of furniture was missing.
Draco shook his head, sneering a little. "You're quite generous in your reading of me, but never mind. You can see why I don't trust myself enough to be in charge of my own life. It's never landed me anywhere good."
Draco looked satisfied. "Good. Now about my property. Anything I own personally is yours, if you want it. But family property that I stand to inherit or already own is different."
Harry, meanwhile, was pointing at the pew that had caught his attention. “You’ve sat there, squashed between Benjamin and . . . and a woman I don’t recognise. Mrs. Baumgarten?”
Harry rolled his eyes. "Too bad you didn't think of it before you agreed to go undercover. You could have saved us an explosion."
"Oh. Well, you know, after what happened second year—look, just hire a car, then. Draco will arrange it."
“No.” He shook his head. “Shacklebolt wants all of us—you, me, Hermione and Ron—to keep out of sight. So looks like another day, at least, of working from home.”
His tone was reasonable. Annoyingly reasonable, and Harry was in no mood for it. “When I see Robards—”
“No one thinks I was punished, Harry! At least if they know about the life debt, they'll—there’s a better chance of people accepting me. Of your friends accepting me.”
Of course, she’d probably be more furious with Harry. At heart, she still didn’t respect the life debt. She might not like the way pure-blood parents arranged marriages for their children, but she would hate the way Harry forbade Draco’s marriage. She didn’t understand that he had the right to.
“Right.” Harry yawned and placed his hand over those tapping fingers. “This isn’t a dangerous mission, Malfoy.”
“But he’s doesn’t agree with his parents!” Hermione interrupted. “He’s not a pure-blood supremacist any longer. And he’s apologised for the things he did and the things he believed as a teenager.”
He nodded toward Draco, who was on the other side of a room, leaning forward in his chair as he explained something about muggle finances to George, who was sitting cross-legged on the floor. Ron and Bill were part of that group too, and all four men seemed engrossed in the conversation.
“Bill and George are both willing to talk with Malfoy. George is expecting some grovelling, though.”
“Possibly, but I also suspect he’s far more ruthless than he lets on. Eventually, even muggles will notice.” Lucius paused. “Whether the Tories or the Lib Dems will have the wherewithal to take advantage of that remains to be seen.”
Lucius and Narcissa did the polite thing: they walked him out of the mansion and far enough from the wards guarding it so that he could disapparate with ease.
“We’d like to keep that quiet for now,” he answered. “I don't mind them knowing about the life debt, though. What did you tell that reporter, by the way?”
"Oh, the ministry's too smart to seize it under the pretense of reparations." Draco curled his lip. "They'll seize it because of our violations of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy."
Draco was staring at him now, his grey eyes half-pleading and half-challenging. "You ensure all that, Potter, and I'll do whatever you say."
"How did you become so comfortable as a ferret? When Moody transfigured you—sorry, I mean Crouch Jr.—shit, I never saw you so frightened and humiliated."
"I think that's enough protection. But Ron, what are you afraid of? That your father won't like Draco? Or that he won't approve of the life debt? Or that he won't approve of my relationship with him?"
“You wouldn’t.” He knew Draco wasn’t serious, but Harry could suddenly taste bile in his throat. “Is he even gay? Or bi?"
Harry was obviously fuming, but he seemed well aware of their surroundings. Ron’s eyes swept the street as well. They were coming up to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, which always seemed a world away from the Auror Department.
"And you'll come with me, as my plus one, so you can meet her and maybe understand a little better."
“Yes. Dobby and Kreacher both, actually.” Harry smiled a little. “Kreacher just went on and on about the noble cast of your aristocratic features or something. And how he’d rather be serving you.”
"Yes," he admitted. "No one at the Ministry would dare interfere—not if Potter ends up with it. More importantly, I trust our saviour here to hold it in trust for my heirs. I know he won't make a grab for it himself."
“I know Harry,” Ron persisted. “He’s not going to sit down to dinner at the Burrow when you’re not allowed there.”
Draco tumbled off of him, sat up and transformed into his human self. He was still wearing his dressy shirt and trousers from last night, though they were rumpled now.
There was a shuffling sort of sound as the phone switched hands. Then Ron's voice came across, strong and clear. "All right, your pet has gone upstairs. Sorry, but I don't want to talk to him about this before I talk with you."
“I don’t think you have to tell Harry about every partner you’ve ever had or anything. Or even about this Death Eater. Like I said, you’re entitled to privacy about your past.”
But he didn't want to stop him. Potter had lost his mind, obviously, but that was fine with Draco. Especially as their lips pressed together.
"Um, yeah." Harry put a hand on Draco's back and guided him toward the queue. "So you know who Jane Austen is?"
“Yes, sorry.” He shook himself. “Just thinking back—well, never mind. I like that Benj and Noa are so much in the muggle world. And it makes sense, doesn’t it? He’s a muggle. And from what Noa says, most of her family actually live and work in the muggle world. They’re mostly teachers at muggle schools, aren’t they?”
Harry sat down on the bed too, facing him. They were both freshly showered and in pajamas—well, Draco, at least, was in proper pajamas. Harry owned plenty of his own, but preferred a tee shirt and joggers.
“No, I didn’t.” Malfoy stared at Ron, as if deciding how much information he was worthy of. “Partly because we’re friends and we get on well enough. But partly because she has a large family—almost as large as yours—and I wouldn’t have minded having all those, er, siblings-in-law.”
Ron grinned. “If I have, it’s not your problem. Your only job right now is to survive the ride to Heathrow with my father.”
Nothing would end the friendship between these two—Hermione knew they were too dear to each other—but she could almost feel the shift in their relationship.
Hermione shifted back toward the laptop, but somehow she couldn't let it go at that. The injustice of it galled her too much; there was no reason for Draco to pledge his service to Harry for the rest of their lives. Especially if they were dating—didn’t Harry want a relationship between equals?
“No. I still don’t understand where, exactly, you keep your bad memories—or why you keep them here.”
Ron rolled his eyes as he turned toward Hermione. "When you're the Minister for Magic, love, I hope you tax all these posh families out of their inherited wealth and redistribute the money to poor wizards and muggles."
“Check and mate.” Weasley leaned back, folded his arms over his chest, and smiled with an annoying amount of satisfaction as Draco’s king knelt down and surrendered his sword.
Draco stared at him for a long moment, his lips twitching. At length he gave into the laughter. “Very well.”
Ron snorted. “You couldn’t stop talking about interior decorating when you and Angelina moved into the new flat—”
She gave herself a mental shake and tried to refocus on the conversation in the room. It had shifted; Jamie was now describing traditional Peruvian food. Which, since it featured plenty of meat and a variety of potatoes, chili, and quinoa, Ron was keen to sample.
But Potter took the nuzzling in his stride. He even gave Draco a gentle scratch behind the ears as he scooped him up and, with Weasley’s assistance, struggled to his feet. Next he retrieved his glasses, sat down on a chair and deposited Draco in his lap.
“Yeah.” Ron reached down and ruffled his hair. “And fortunately you weren’t any good at being evil. Worst assassin ever.”
"The information dried up," Potter went on. "I assumed that Robards had pulled the agent out. Which was fine—it's what he should have done. But I overheard . . . well, the details don't matter. I found out our agent was still there. I couldn't imagine how he had kept his cover. And then, after, um—"
Ron should have known. As soon as he saw that weird flirting between them back at Hermione's office, he should have known.
Draco, damn him, was a morning person. That seemed impossible; Harry had always imagined him lounging in bed until noon, with house elves serving him a late breakfast on an antique silver tray.
Draco let out a long suffering sigh. A seriously exaggerated one. “If I wanted to forget about it or cancel it or anything like that, obviously I’d go to Granger. She hates the whole concept of it. I’m going to Weasley because he understands it and approves of it.”
"Granger. Of course." Draco let out a frustrated sigh. "I worship the woman, but she doesn't understand our relationship."
And Draco must have all of a ferret's survival instincts. Bill could smell the fear on him, and he was fairly certain that he, himself, was the cause of it.
Harry ignored that, thinking back over the past few days. When he’d rescued Draco, when they apparated to the ministry, even when they’d apparated to and from the gate at Malfoy Manor . . . each time Draco had side-alonged.
“Yeah, I know that.” Ron shook his head, partly in resignation but partly in disbelief. “But not being a killer? That’s a pretty low bar to set for a boyfriend.”
“You’re the saviour, mate,” Ron said through a mouthful of something. Muggle crisps, judging by the colorful foil bag he’d pulled from his pocket. Draco wondered where in the ministry he had gotten hold of those.
“To answer your first question, I keep them in this building but outside of the sanctuary. They’re locked away in various classrooms downstairs, but I’ll let you enter the room that will show you Dobby. As for the second question—fuck, I don’t know how to explain this.”
Harry knew he had to give her this much. It can’t have been easy for her to watch him help Lucius and Narcissa as much as he had done. A small part of Hermione had probably hoped that Lucius would rot in Azkaban—and he might have done had Harry objected to the public deal he cut with the Wizengamot.
But all that was done now. Robards was satisfied and promised Harry he'd speak well of Draco's service. The Improper Use of Magic officials were finally satisfied, after taking forever to confirm Draco's status as a former agent and making him demonstrate his animagus form over and over.
Ron glanced around the room, noting all the doors and windows yet again. Then he relaxed a little and took a look at his companions.
“Oh yes. Master Draco explained to Kreacher how Toffee will be assisting with the renovations. And Master Draco is saying to me, in private, to always pretend that Kreacher is in charge.”
Harry smiled and scratched him behind the ears. "That's called a dooking sound, per this book. You're happy enough, then?"
“The point is this.” Harry closed his eyes for a second, remembering the scene. “We were alone. You had let down the blinds so no one could see what was going on. Once you petrified me—nice spellwork, by the way—you had me completely at your mercy. But that broken nose and that almost-ride back to Kings Cross was all you did.”
But in Hagrid’s case it was egregious. A teacher wasn’t meant to be mates with his students. And he certainly wasn’t (for example) meant to show off a contraband baby dragon to them or allow them to help him cover up his possession of said contraband—which is what the Golden Trio must have done.
He wasn't lying. Harry had never had a massage before, but now he understood why so many people swore by them. Presumably a professional didn't straddle you as they attended to your shoulders and back, though, so having your partner give you one seemed an added benefit.
Draco didn't pretend to misunderstand him. "I want you to protect my family and our property. I don't want my father to die at Azkaban. I want him and my mother to grow old together at Malfoy Manor, without fear that someone will snatch the place away."
He closed his eyes as he snuggled next to Draco, trying not to worry about telling those two all his news. They weren’t likely to react well.
Ron shrugged. “Yeah. They’re boyfriends now too. That was probably inevitable—they were obsessed with each other for ages. That’s not what Mum’s upset about, is it?”
“Not at all. Unfortunately, we didn't have much time together, because I was only driving them to the airport, but—"
George felt the same. “Bill, back up—I think you're scaring poor Malfoy here. He can probably smell the wolf in you.”
"Fuck yeah," Ron said. "But—all right. If you want to, er, just be normal mates, without any of this subservient shit, that can happen."
“Yes. Mine was perfect. And their home is perfect—I didn’t expect a ramshackle old Victorian. Or, er, whatever the equivalent era is here.”
Draco answered in a bored drawl, but Hermione didn’t miss the blush that crept onto his cheeks. “I’ve grown rather partial to Jewish traditions."
“Where is he?” Lucius demanded. He was standing right behind her, and she could hear both the irritation and apprehension in his voice.
“My muggle family?” Harry laughed as he shook his head. “My Uncle Vernon never showed me off at his work; he liked to pretend I didn't exist.”
Ron was turning red. "Your whole family has muggle credentials and they vote and invest? After every bloody thing they said about muggles and muggle-borns?"
“I do understand,” Benjamin insisted, squeezing his shoulder. “Come over here.” He released Draco and started away from the window.
The two departed with that, leaving Harry to wonder how such decent people—and he was fairly certain the Baumgartens were decent—could maintain such a friendship. Or, for that matter, how he could keep up his own civil facade with Lucius.
“I'm not. That undercover work was probably worse. Anyway, he tried to apologise to me, but I didn’t want to hear it. I told him we were okay, as long as he doesn’t disappoint you or Harry.”
Draco ignored that. “This house is in horrific condition. Here’s fair warning for you: I plan to borrow more house elves from the Manor periodically.”
Harry dug his hands into his pockets, trying to hide his surprise. "So you want that to be public knowledge?"
His dad seemed to struggle with a response. “I think we were all a bit surprised to discover that Harry is, er . . . .”
He even loved the journey there. He and Shira—and sometimes Shira’s girlfriend, Jamie—would squash aboard the PATH train in Hoboken, surrounded by muggles of all descriptions, on the World Trade Center line. It had always seemed exciting, especially as his parents had never let him loose in London. They had guarded him carefully there. Even at King’s Cross they would hustle him as fast as possible through the barrier at platform nine and three-quarters.
Harry seemed to dismiss Granger’s concern as well. “He’ll find time for us between classes. Besides, this is important. He’s one of the people—well, I want him to know that there’s more than a life debt between me and Draco.”
People were perched at their desks all around him, typing frantically on their keyboards as they spoke on their phones in American English, spewing jargon that Harry vaguely recognised as financial. More people rushed past him, carrying paperwork in one hand and their pagers in the other.
“All right.” Harry settled back down under the covers. “Tell Draco I’ll be up in ten minutes. Fifteen at most—”
Ron tore his eyes away from his father to see Draco standing back at the bedroom door. Fuck, he should have heard the git walking up the creaky stairs of Grimmauld Place. He couldn’t decide whether to be annoyed by his stealth or impressed with it.
“But you promised not to make things more difficult for him,” Draco continued, looking up again. “And that . . . that made a difference, Harry.”
But there was something soothing about the way Malfoy’s breaths were changing from shallow and fluttery-fast to deep, slow, and steady. After a while, Harry's breaths started to match his, and the ringing in his ears began to fade.
“Yeah. I wish you hadn’t put it to that use, but—well, you heard Bill. Even he’s impressed with your spells and your craftsmanship.”
"Right. That. And playing up his cleverness might impress Hermione and Bill, but it won't impress my dad. And Draco can't do his pet act either, because my father's not going to drive a literal ferret to Heathrow—"
“Master and Master Draco should know that Mrs. Weasley nee Granger has sent an urgent owl.” He held out a sealed envelope.
Harry had memorised all those expressions back in school. Now he had many more to add: he knew what Draco looked like when he put on an act, pretending not to care about his fate. Harry had seen that particular expression in Azkaban: he remembered the nonchalant mask Draco had worn as he tried to convince Harry that he was coping just fine before his trial, thank you very much.
By the time he opened his eyes, Hermione and Draco—who was human again—were sitting on the bottom edge of the bed, chatting companionably. Hermione was still in her favourite makeshift pajamas: one of Ron's Chudley Cannons tee-shirts and a pair of yoga leggings. Draco was still dressed as he had been yesterday, though his shirt and trousers were rumpled now, as was his hair.
“I know. We meant no harm. You and Draco—you’re besotted with each other. That’s obvious. But we wanted to give the press something else to gossip about. We want them focusing on the fact that our son has enough honour to pay off his debt to you. We don’t want them speculating on how long your romance with an ex-Death Eater will last.”
Draco actually laughed at that. "I wouldn't mind, if it’s all right with Harry. So, ah, we’ll talk?’
She looked shocked by the question. “Of course! It’s an honour to be serving Harry Potter, who saved the life of my Master Draco.”
“Why? It’s just a word. You’re not casting the spell this time. Go ahead. Say it. You have to, if you wish to get any further.”
Harry shrugged. “But you know what I mean. If you could marry Shira and be happy, why can't you see us being happy together? If it's that you want kids, well, don't worry. I want some too.”
Draco was perfectly capable of surviving a week without Harry, so that hadn’t set him on edge. And despite all the drama about familial expectations and arranged marriages, he’d been looking forward to seeing Shira and Jamie; he hadn’t been stressing over their arrival. And Draco seemed comfortable with Ron and Hermione, even accepting Ron, to some extent, as an authority figure.
“Thanks for the reminder.” He kissed the top of Draco’s head, still grinning despite himself. “Knowing you’ll be judging my every move won’t add any pressure at all.”
Draco sat down again, adjusting the legs of his trousers as he did so. "Saint Potter is pouring out his righteous anger on my behalf. When I left, he was threatening to expose the way Robards blackmailed me into becoming an agent."
Draco laughed too, but the rest of his response was cut off by some sort of interruption. Ron's voice, from the sound of it.
She didn't say anything. Was she waiting for him to say something more? Would Potter expect him to apologise for every cruel comment he'd ever made about her? They'd be here forever.
He cleared his throat, breaking the silence that had engulfed the room. "You said you had conditions, Malfoy. Name them."
Draco’s brain seemed to freeze at that. So Robards considered him expendable, despite the promises he made. Promises about how the Ministry always looked after their agents. And Draco had been stupid enough to believe the man.
“I don’t know about your mother, but your father’s family was a mixture of Anglicans and dissenters—chapel types, I think. And he had one branch of Hindu ancestors, of course. I think your Dad himself was Anglican, though I’ve no idea if that was just nominally.”
“Yes. Though I didn’t finish it alone. You know Neville beheaded Nagini in the end. And once that horcrux was destroyed, there must have been a way to defeat Riddle even without—”
"I'm still filthy from the explosion, Granger, that's all." He lowered her hand, but didn't release it. "And I don't believe that crap about muggle-borns anymore."
“Enough!” Ron looked up toward the ceiling, as if summoning divine aid. “Just come out with it, Ferret. If I can keep it confidential, I will.”
Of course, Hermione had no idea whether her words were true. They might well be, but it was just theory. Had some part of Draco always instinctively, and perhaps subconsciously, identified with ferrets? There simply wasn’t enough research on animagi out there.
She took his arm with a sigh. “Don’t worry, I doubt it will come to that. Let’s not despair—or plot—until we discover one thing.”
Draco actually smiled, something he hadn’t done all evening. “It’s in New York—well, New Jersey, actually. But, trust me, I don’t have to go all the way to Tel Aviv to find some unrest. I can get myself blown up anywhere.”
Her eyes were watering. "But why—Draco, what possessed you to become an agent? We thought the aurors were using you as a mere consultant."
That didn’t stop Harry. He still managed to grab hold of Draco and force him down on the bed, until the ferret was trapped lying sideways.
But the ferret had only bought them a brief reprieve. Somehow Skeeter had sniffed out the scandal at the Auror Department, and nothing Harry, Hermione or Malfoy said was going to dissuade her from pursuing the story. Ron didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad one, but he wished it wasn't Skeeter.
“No! I mean, yes.” Damn Draco for putting him into this position. Now Harry would have to face Hermione and try to explain how he suddenly owned a second house elf, who probably didn’t want her freedom any more than Kreacher wanted his.
“Draco, that sounds perfect.” Now Harry was genuinely enthusiastic. “As long as you can make it comfortable.”
He knew what Draco looked like in the middle of a breakdown too: Harry would never forget the sight of him sobbing in the bathroom or the haunted quality of his voice, despite his forced bravado, as he tried to bring himself to perform the killing curse on Dumbledore.
Benj nudged him with his elbow. “Just don’t wallow in it. Use the regret for fuel instead. Use it to move forward.”
He was a beautiful animal, no question, with an adorable, pointed and, yes, twitchy face—though hopefully Hermione would never remind him about the twitchy part. His whole sleek body was covered in gorgeous Malfoy-blonde fur. All except for the discoloration on the inside of his left foreleg, but Harry understood about that.
Harry focused on the door. He had no idea what password Draco would use. Besides, Draco was almost at the end of the hall, about to turn the corner. He had to catch up. But as he started to move, he caught the faintest whiff of the memory.
Draco, who had been giving Harry an intense look, suddenly smiled. "Oh, I knew it was you. You were my personal stalker that year."
"Um, okay." That was as good a way of expressing it as any, Harry supposed. He was grateful too, in fact. But Draco was probably right. Best not to think too hard about it. "But if people knew what really happened, they would—”
He let out a little chirrupy, chuckling noise as he nuzzled against Harry's neck. Perfect way to communicate his contentment. No way to say it in human form, really. Not without sounding like an utter sap.
"No! I mean . . . ” Potter blushed yet again. He was almost scarlet this time as he chose his words. “Yes, I mean. She looks nice and all. But it's a marriage your parents are choosing for you! You've already said you don't trust your father's judgment—"
The missive was short and to the point. Evansia Gross of the Daily Prophet had contacted Ron and Hermione for comment on the story that Draco was currently serving a life-debt to Harry. Ron and Hermione intended to show up at Grimmauld Place first thing in the morning to discuss the matter.
“Fuck.” Draco folded his hands on the table, looking as if he were about to face an interrogation. “I knew he’d come up eventually.”
“But you’re obviously okay with him.” Ron grinned despite himself. “At least judging by all the flirting you two do. And I’ll say this for him: I think that’s genuine on his part.”
But that wasn’t an excuse. Harry had overstepped. Why did he always go overboard where Malfoy was concerned?
"Yeah," Harry agreed. "But because of our history, and because . . . well, I am a bit of a violent person, I can't lay a hand on you to punish you. Not even a, um, punishment that wouldn't really hurt you."
Bill hesitated and then placed a brotherly hand on his shoulder. “Just remember, Harry. They are friendly with Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.”
Muggle cash, he meant, though they were obviously keeping their vocabulary muggle-friendly and unsuspicious here.
He started their discussion by pointing out that Draco didn’t believe he was capable of casting a patronus, and that he either couldn’t or wouldn’t apparate any longer. Those two facts upset Hermione almost as much as they had upset Harry, and put her in sympathy with him.
But Harry didn’t let go of his arm. “What’s wrong? Do you just not like to apparate? It’s okay. Lots of people don’t.”
“Of course not. That might have changed now, I suppose, if they think I can provide them with access to you."
"Ouch!" Harry laughed as he reached behind to capture Draco's wrists and pull him even closer, so that he was trapped against Harry's back now. "Stop that. You'll  come with me whenever I tell you to and transform into a ferret whenever I say. A ferret with a fucking muzzle, that is."
"She tried to," Harry answered. "But Jamie wouldn't let her. We had a proper conversation instead, about—oh, all sorts of things. The fact that I shouldn't suffer any culture shock here, for instance."
“Shira does have a point, Draco. Since you’re not Jewish, what inspired you to have the house kashered?”
“Oxfam!” Toffee uttered the word proudly. “That is the person Master Draco is naming: A Mister Oxfam.”
So Harry didn’t care what was stopping Draco from casting those spells, whether it was indeed a mental block or a lack of proper training or whatever. One way or another he was going to learn them—and Harry would soon make that clear to him.
It took Narcissa’s brain a moment to encompass the fact that by ‘home’ Potter meant Aunt Walburga’s old residence, as if her son no longer belonged in Malfoy Manor.
And yes. As Harry looked up at those stupid, long, narrow boxes—feeling an awe that he was desperate to tamp down—he was forced to admit that they did. They anchored the skyline perfectly.
Draco frowned at that, unsure of the etiquette involved. It was likely fine, though. The Ark was closed tight; you couldn’t see anything of the Torah scrolls inside.
“Draco didn’t kill Dumbledore.” Harry’s voice was sharp and uncompromising. “You know that. You know what really happened.”
“Yeah. Which we both learned from.” He paused to shake his head. “I don't solve problems between us with fists or wands anymore.”
“No.” Potter remained standing. “I need to know—did you contact the Daily Prophet about the life debt between Draco and me?”
There was an appraising look in Draco's eyes now—oh, right. That explained why Harry felt shy. Best to brazen it out, probably. "Like what you see?"
"Right." Ron cursed under his breath as he zipped up his jeans. "You can side along with me to the Manor, then. Once she's dressed, Hermione will wake Shira and Jamie. They can all meet us at St. Mungo's."
George knit his brows together. “What’s that about? And who are these two blokes Draco wants you to stay with?”
“I know. But Ron was afraid—well, he thought you might have different interests than his father. What aspects of the culture did you talk about? Was it all, er, financial?”
"Not really what I'm looking for. So while I was snogging Ginny, were you shagging Pansey? Or, Merlin, was it Blaise?"
Draco was amazed it had taken him this long to ask, though he supposed they had both been distracted. And he had no objection to sharing his theory with Harry; it was only Granger who needed to be unprejudiced.
The tension in Harry’s shoulders began to spread. “You need advice about the life debt? Draco, are you—do you want to forget about it?”
Harry cringed. Ron had been right; Draco probably sounded too much like he was sucking up, just as he used to with Snape.
“So were you.” Hagrid heaved himself down onto a bench. “And I notice you didn’t go around trying to have an innocent hippogriff murdered.”
"Harry, I usually do something with my parents on or near the date. At least when I'm in the country. Dinner or something."
But not everyone was hell-bent on some call or bit of paperwork. There were people laughing and joking with each other too, or throwing their hands up in mock despair at some piece of news or other.
It was an excellent kiss, in Harry's non-expert opinion, but when it ended Draco looked like he had something on his mind. Something foreboding.
Harry, who was sitting cross-legged in that same spot, opted for the truth. “Draco wants to ask Ron for advice about his life debt.”
“That was before I saw how cute and fuzzy he is now,” George objected as he advanced toward Ron and the ferret.
Draco gave her a sour smile. "With what they have on my family and the history of that property? Yes."
Conversion and becoming a member of the Baumgarten family—to Draco, those two things were inextricably linked. But what if Potter were in this for the long term? He thought he was, of course, but what if he actually was in reality?
Harry crept into his bedroom. It was dark, so he was pretty sure Draco was already asleep. Providing he wasn’t so pissed off that he had moved into another room for the night.
“No, Harry. Shhh. Just let the memory come. It’s important. There’s something you need to understand.”
Harry swallowed and turned back to Draco. "Look, your father has to keep himself absolutely clean from here on out. I can't do anything if he gives Robards an excuse to charge him with some new infraction."
“Draco, I'm a curse-breaker,” he explained. “But I deal with plenty of magical items that are damaged as well as, or instead of, cursed. Vanishing closets are amongst the trickiest things to deal with, so I want to know exactly how you fixed that one at Hogwarts.”
"They can't." Hermione all but stamped her foot. "Demands for reparations from Death Eater families have failed again and again—"
They were in the dining room. Earlier, Draco and Granger had banded together to ensure that their romantic counterparts finally got a start on their paperwork for the Auror Department. By Draco’s reckoning, said counterparts had lasted about three hours before demanding a break. So Harry was now in the sitting room, confessing his tyranny to Granger, whilst Weasley was downstairs clobbering Draco at chess.
“Merlin, you're adorable,” George cooed. “Clever too. Tell the truth: you were the genius behind those Potter Stinks badges, weren't you?”
“And Mrs. Baumgarten—she would have been furious if he tried to disown Noa,” Draco continued. “There would have been a raging battle. But, fortunately, he values the concept of peace in the home.”
But Hermione's mind crept back to Draco. He had seemed so much at ease of late, even when Ron ruffled his hair—as if he really were a pet!—or issued him an order. And that was just with Ron; Draco was even more comfortable with Harry in charge.
Draco had sensed that power the moment he met him, back when they were fitted for their first year robes. In their subsequent years at Hogwarts, he had both wanted him for it and despised him for it. Surely even muggles weren't oblivious to it.
"We have plenty of time to discuss this," Harry continued. "And I promise to take your feelings into account. But I'm the one who will decide on our surname."
Kreacher, somewhat to Harry’s surprise, nodded approvingly. “Yes, Master Draco. Shall Kreacher and Toffee arrange the third floor as a guest room for Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley?”
“I—I’m sorry, Hagrid,” he stammered, “for everything I did as a Death Eater, and for my, ah, ill-informed prejudices beforehand.”
Harry laughed again. “Come on. You enjoyed the greasy food. And you and Ron were civil—almost friendly, really. And you and Hermione were doing some weird platonic flirting thing.”
“Yeah. But it’s a trick my Aunt Bella taught me.” He paused. “When people know you have some skill in occlumency—and Voldemort knew, as did Robards—it’s best to select the thoughts and memories you’ll allow to the surface and then protect them. And you want a good mix: painful, giddy, embarrassing, shameful, content . . . you get the idea.”
He was rewarded with a bright smile. “Good.” Harry stood up and walked over to him. “Come on, then, let’s get going. I suppose the four of us should apparate to Hogsmeade . . . .”
“Yeah.” Harry swallowed. “I knew a life debt was a real thing—Dumbledore said as much back in third year. But I didn't know it was so formal—”
Draco raised his head to look up at him. There was a half-smile playing on his lips. “My romantic liaison, not my bit on the side. That’s better, surely?”
“Just between us.” Harry gave him a look. “And I’d want power over you regardless of how much sex we have. And, er, speaking of power imbalances . . . .”
“So, I suppose we should start.” Draco sat down on the bed, cross-legged, and waited. He wasn’t keen to have Harry rifling through his memories of Dobby, but it was preferable to putting them into words.
She leaned back against the couch with an odd look of triumph. “I knew this would happen. I knew you wouldn’t respect his fundamental autonomy—”
“Oh, they’re already trying. They want me to join them—along with Shira and Jamie—at a wizarding restaurant for Draco’s birthday. He’s turning twenty-one on the fifth.”
Narcissa was first down the stairs and into the sitting room. Neither she nor Lucius had bothered with proper clothes when the house elf woke them from bed; they were tieing on dressing gowns as they rushed to the boy who seemed determined to remain both a saviour and a bane to their family.
That wasn’t enough to satisfy Harry. Or Ron. As for Hermione . . . well, she was still next to Bill, holding her breath.
Harry moved to grab Draco by the scruff of his neck—but Draco was fast enough to counter with a real bite to his hand. A sharp, stinging bite that drew blood.
It didn’t have to wait long. There was a rumble beneath them and then the whole place started shaking. Draco’s grip on Harry—they were still holding hands—tightened. He didn’t let go until the shaking stopped.
"I can see why." Harry smiled back at him. "Did you choose everything for this guestroom? You know, the colours and furnishings and such?"
"Draco insisted on retrieving a flash drive first—this was with flames all around us, mind—but, yeah. We ended up singed and concussed and banged up, but otherwise all right."
Could Draco even cast a patronus charm? It was a rare spell outside Dumbledore's Army and the aurors, but Robards should have made sure it was in Draco's arsenal before sending him into dangerous undercover work. If he didn't know the patronus charm, Harry would teach it to him. Even if he was free of working for Robards, anything could happen. And Draco was, well, Harry's responsibility now.
“So why didn’t you tell me about Robards blackmailing you?” Harry felt his face heat up. “You came to tell me that you were leaving London. Why did you lie about the reason?”
Harry sighed and shook his head again. “I feel as if we’ve wasted three years. Or maybe not; you obviously found yourself in New York.”
“So that Severus could do the deed and end his life as planned, thrusting him even higher in the dark lord’s favour.”
“That’s settled then.” Narcissa did her utmost to disguise her relief. “Now, some tea or coffee before you leave? Of course you’re welcome to stay the night in Draco’s room if you’d rather not apparate just now.”
"No. I don't understand how that's possible, though. Weren't you seeing the Weaselette back in sixth year? Though I suppose you two never did anything but snog."
No, Malfoy didn't belong under cover. He ought to be brewing potions or repairing magical antiques or something. He was good at things like that: things that required lots of time and effort and patience.
Draco nodded, grateful for the assistance—and for the fact that Ron hadn't called him to task for not being able to apparate himself.
And now Draco was only alive, once again, thanks to Harry Potter. The chosen one was making a habit of saving him. Which meant that Draco was even further in his debt.
"No, your parents make out quite well. Your father will stay at liberty and they'll both keep their estate." She paused to shake her head. "But do you even care about Malfoy Manor? For yourself, I mean. Not for your parents or heirs."
“No, not with Dobby. I didn’t know him well.” Draco looked away from Harry then, his features tight. “The house elves assigned to the kitchen would give me a treat and let me sit in a corner and read. We didn’t speak much; I don’t know if they realised I had, er, borrowed the books from my mother’s private library. Or that I should never have been reading them at my tender age.”
“I didn’t stay relieved, you know? Because it didn’t help me personally. I still couldn’t work out how to . . . how to get out of murdering Dumbledore. Or how to work up the nerve if I couldn't get out of it. Or how long my family could possibly stay alive afterward, because the Dark Lord would always have more tasks for us . . .”
She finally opened her mouth to reply, but Weasley chose that moment to enter the waiting room. His eyes widened a bit at the scene in front of him, but he took it better than Draco would have anticipated.
"Oh!" Harry sat there blankly, his mouth hanging open, as his brain raced ahead to do the maths. So Draco was born on 5 June. In 1980, of course, same as himself. And like Harry, he was turning twenty-one this year.
Ah. This was not a fellow auror. This was an angry boyfriend. An angry boyfriend who was spitting out his surname exactly as he used to do at Hogwarts.
“Draco and I can celebrate privately, you know. Or just with you lot. And Shira and Jamie. I don’t have to go.”
“Brilliant of you to notice, Potter.” Draco’s drawling voice was raw, but clear enough now. He had finally roused himself enough to shift his head. “No wonder you're the new poster boy for the aurors.”
Harry shook his head, dismissing that question, and focused on the hallway. The classroom doors were all closed. There were no knobs, Harry noticed, even though they were built for them. Apparently Draco had removed them in his head. Harry tried pushing and tugging at one of the doors, but it wouldn’t budge.
Draco’s mouth was hanging open now. And that, he realised, was his most common response to Harry’s revelations. “Snape tutored you in occlumency, but never taught you to meditate?”
“I’m sorry Master,” it said in a high-pitched, squeaky little voice. “Master Draco says if you are wishing to arrive at your office on time, you must be getting up.”
But Draco could hardly discuss apparating with a muggle, could he? No, he needed a qualified therapist with some connection to the wizarding world. A muggle-born, perhaps? Or maybe some muggle with a wizard or witch for a family member?
There was a moment of silence. A long moment. “You’re the most convenient person to blame,” Draco said at last.
“Draco,” he said at last, “I’m not giving you a choice. You have a target on your back. I want you to know how to apparate and how to send a patronus for help.”
Ron grinned, enjoying his discomfort. “Well, since things went so well with Hagrid, you might as well get dinner with my family over with.”
“True, but I can keep him in line without hurting him. I promise. And so far I'm the one who's been injured; he can give a nasty bite as a ferret.”
"And, look," Ron continued, blushing a little, "I know what I said before. About me liking you better this way, all obedient. And that's true, as far as it goes, but you don't have to—well, you know."
It seemed an even worse idea when Shira informed him, agog with curiousity, that she would never settle for just talking to the famed Harry Potter. No, she insisted on seeing him, so they had best set up a video conference on muggle computers.
He sighed. “They don’t talk to the likes of me, Harry. Pansy, Blaise—they were clever enough to stay out of the war, weren’t they? Neither took the dark mark, neither actually fought against the right side. Remaining friends with me would have damaged their reputation in the post-war world.”
“I still think you ought to let me return the favour.” Harry reached out and smoothed his hair, because anything that messy looked wrong on a Malfoy.
“We seem to have exhausted the verboten topic of politics,” Narcissa said at last. “Shall we move onto religion? Draco, I understand the Baumgartens’ youngest will be celebrating his bar mitzvah this coming autumn?”
“Yeah.” He swallowed. “Draco’s parents and Shira’s parents wanted them to marry for the sake of producing pure-blood children. They thought it would work out because both of them are gay.”
Snape . . . Snape had been a Death Eater. A sincere one, before Voldemort murdered Harry's mother. He had taken the mark. He had—Harry didn’t even know the extent of his crimes in those early days. He knew that Snape had recited the prophecy about Harry to Voldemort, making Harry and his parents targets. Harry didn’t know what else Snape might have done, but it could have been anything, up to and including murder.
“But—but this all happened before he was an animagus,” Hagrid pointed out. “It happened even before Crouch Jr. transfigured the brat.”
Wait, was it normal to visit the father of someone who was serving a life debt to you? Even if said father was a mortal enemy? “Er, yes.”
Harry sat up, straining his ears, but he couldn't quite make out the words. It sounded as if Ron were issuing some sort of order and Draco was resisting it—not by scoffing or refusing to obey, but simply by pleading his case.
“Enough!” Harry was laughing too now, but was clearly trying to look stern at the same time. “George, you’re going to bash your head against something.”
But Draco shook his head as he placed a finger over Harry’s lips. “No, you don’t get to say that yet.”
Bill stared at him for a moment and then let out a mirthless laugh. “No. I'm not obsessed with his memory. He didn't turn me, remember. Just gave me some wolfish traits. And I don't blame you for what happened—not entirely.”
Hermione felt a stab of pity as she watched Harry’s reaction. Somehow he looked hurt, apologetic and resigned all at once. And then she noticed something else in his expression: the painful decision not to confide in Hagrid.
“It is for me.” His voice was still drawling, but somehow it had lost that annoying, superior quality it usually held. There was even a hint of uncertainty in it, as if he were unsure of Harry’s intentions.
Draco caught it and followed the trio into the room. A picture of himself and Harry at the ministry, their clothes singed and torn from the explosion, dominated the front page. Their eyes, Draco noticed, were glued to each other as they walked into Robard’s office.
Arthur Weasley. Harry cringed a bit at the mention of Ron’s dad. Yeah, he must be the reason Draco was so upset.
Potter took that as permission to continue. "I didn't know about this. All I knew, as an auror, was that someone had infiltrated a neo-Death Eater cell. And they'd given us good information. We were able to make several arrests."
Fuck. Draco couldn’t tell. He might be an expert in occlumency, but he had no equivalent skill in legilimency. Would Harry actually haul him back there and force him to do grunt work?
But that wasn’t fair, he told himself. The one redeeming feature of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy was the fact that they loved their son. Loved him enough, it seemed, to show their limited support for him to find, uh, ‘romantic fulfillment’ with a man they despised.
A commotion woke him up. He almost bolted out of Ron’s shirt, but Ron grabbed hold of the scruff of his neck to keep him in place.
“The Ravenclaw half-blood?” Draco shrugged. “Dunno. I think American wizards in general do more of the religious thing than we do. Of course, he has cousins in America. I met a couple of them.”
So Harry was smiling as he walked out of the master bedroom and down the stairs to the sitting room. No sign of Draco there, though, so he headed down further, to the ground floor, where he could hear Draco’s voice wafting toward him.
Ron looked at Hermione and then back at him. He seemed like a man steeling himself for some unpleasant task.
Harry furrowed his brow; he couldn’t hear any background noise. Draco was somewhere in St. Mungo’s; he knew that much. Was he properly protected? The Malfoys had so many enemies . . . .
Bill couldn’t see George’s expression, but it must have been serious, judging by his tone. “He doesn’t need forgiveness from me, you know. He didn’t kill Fred, and he didn’t blast off my ear.” He pointed to the side of his head, where his ear was missing, for emphasis. “It’s Ron and Bill who have a right to a grudge, not me.”
Jamie snorted. “I know. I’m Jamie Yarleque, from an impeccable line of Peruvian wizards. Until you get to me, that is.” She paused to sigh dramatically. “I’m a squib—can’t do a drop of magic. Just thought I’d get that out of the way.”
“Oh.” Harry gave him a sheepish smile this time. “Well, they’re both your family. And Teddy’s my godson. He lost his parents in the war; it would be good for him to have more family about. Good for Andromeda too, probably.”
"Merlin, no more politics." Harry elbowed Draco. "And remember, that personal fortune of yours belongs to me now. I can make sure you use it for good causes."
Harry blinked at the spot where Kreacher had stood just a moment ago. “All right,” he said. “I’m guessing ‘frum’ means, uh, observant or religious or something?”
Harry sighed. “No. He's not wrong. And he knows he's not really in a position to criticise the man. I'm more upset by the things he's said about Hagrid.”
“George!” Hermione gave him a reproving glare before crossing the room to stand at Ron's side. Harry let her pass.
Draco had been hovering in the background, but he put himself deliberately in view by standing behind Harry and encircling him in his arms. “I dunno. Potter’s grown on me, I suppose.”
Narcissa stared at the boy as he continued to ramble. She hadn’t realised how much he despised living in the full glare of publicity. Small wonder, though. She remembered how the Prophet had painted him as a deluded attention-seeker for insisting that the Dark Lord had returned, only to turn about and hail him as the chosen one when the truth could no longer be ignored.
And apparently they were mates now. In Weasley’s eyes, at any event. Draco wasn’t sure he could truly be friends with the man, for the same reason he couldn’t truly be friends with Harry: they weren’t equals. He was too conscious of what he owed the Weasel. Not as much as he owed Harry, perhaps, but a great deal regardless.
“You’re not jealous?” Now he sounded outraged. Or mock-outraged, at least. "Why aren’t you jealous?”
But Draco's choice was fine. Harry didn't have anything against Jane Austen—not that he'd read her either. But he'd been hoping, by some miracle, to find
Draco looked like he had a hundred objections. But, in the end, he didn't voice any of them. Instead his eyes softened and he shook his head a bit. "All right."
Hermione seized on those as the way forward, PR-wise. (After explaining that PR stood for public relations. Muggles used abbreviations for everything.) Harry was well known to be apolitical. He had never intended this life-debt to represent a particular side of the wizarding culture wars, nor as something that anyone else should imitate. So the key, Hermione swore, was to keep emphasising that this was just between him and Draco. It was important to Draco, on a personal level, to pay back his debt. And Harry respected his feelings on the matter.
He grabbed his old wand—the one Harry had just returned to him—off the table near the bed and performed an adequate “Episkey.” That wasn’t a simple spell, and not part of the standard curriculum at Hogwarts, so Harry wondered where and when he had learned it.
Draco's voice was almost painfully cautious as he answered. “I don't know. But they like to get ahead of stories about the family. You know, control the narrative and all that.”
Harry scratched him behind his ears, as if he were in ferret form. "I'm aware. Which is why we need to break your nipping habit."
"Here," he said instead. He turned the laptop around, so that it was facing the Golden Trio. "All the information on that flashdrive. Accounts, passwords—every shred of financial evidence I collected on that lot."
And at that moment, it struck him. All this time, Harry had been telling himself that the life-debt was something optional between them. Something superfluous to their relationship that they could let go if Draco outgrew it.
"And you loved that, didn't you?" Draco gave him an oddly fond look. "You loved having that power over me."
“Oh. Um, all right.” He swallowed as a feeling of dread curled into his stomach. “Is Kreacher aware of this arrangement?”
Draco chose that moment to transform. It took only a second; suddenly George had a lapful of a very human Malfoy.
They walked into a large room with lots of round tables, big enough to seat eight or ten each. The social hall, apparently. This must be where Draco had gotten into all those arguments about religion, politics and any other inflammatory topic.
“Don’t worry, Harry. I’ll still show you my memories of Dobby. Once you’ve earned back my trust, that is. So don’t pester me about my dreams.”
“So Robards . . . he sent you out into the field without you knowing how to apparate to safety? And without you being able to send your patronus with a message or a plea for help?”
Saying either of those things out loud was probably a bad idea. Well, not the second part so much; Draco already knew how much Harry enjoyed having his old rival under his thumb. Still, now wasn't the time. And, besides, those sides of him weren't the whole story.
“I just . . . there’s something I think we should discuss.” He tried to keep his voice gentle. “And not because I want to dredge up the past or anything. But you’re good with Kreacher and Toffee. Very good. So I’d like to know—”
"No." Draco felt his lips curving into a soft smile. "Potter—and that hero complex of his—rushed in to save the day, of course."
“Right. Noa was with him. They brought me to a diner for breakfast—a proper Jersey diner, they assured me.”
"Yeah, I do. Sometimes." He let out another long sigh. “I’m not really upset about you driving, you know. And you are actually better than me on a broom. Better and faster.”
Harry just walked back to the chesterfield and knelt down in front of him. He took Draco’s left arm and ran his fingers over the mark.
Whatever the fallout, Harry wasn’t at fault. Ron repeated that over and over in his head as the foursome made their way along Diagon Alley. Robards should never have left Malfoy to die. He probably shouldn’t have blackmailed Malfoy into becoming an agent either—although that was murkier territory. The aurors had never been saints; Ron was well aware of that.
Harry forced himself to gulp down a lung’s worth of air. “You’re fucking cruel, you know that? You’re pissed off because you think I insulted you. But I didn’t mean to, and you’re lashing out anyway.”
"It's fine, Ron." Harry held out his hand to Draco. "I accept. All of it, I mean. The, um, payment of the life debt, the conditions—everything."
Narcissa stole a glance at her husband. Draco’s orientation had never troubled him; many witches and wizards of excellent stock were homosexual. But Draco happily submitting himself to Harry Potter, of all people . . . that was more than Lucius could be expected to bear.
Draco apparently had no interest in what he really thought, because he interrupted by lunging at Harry and snapping the air perilously close to his arm.
"No! No, Malfoy, we're done with fist fights. And that's—that's not how I wanted to wipe your sneer off." He took hold of Draco's wrist again, gently this time. "Come here."
They’d all lose track of each other as they browsed the seemingly endless stacks and shelves, and they rarely returned home without at least two bags of used books that they couldn’t possibly squeeze into Shira’s flat. They could easily have ‘gone to the movies’ on one of those trips, but somehow they never had.
“Oh yeah. No one ever got under my skin the way you did. So why didn’t he try harder to delve into your thoughts?”
“None,” Harry agreed. “But I suppose I could just forbid you to enter an arranged marriage to begin with—”
“Just so. And yes, teaching is sort of the family profession.” Draco’s voice was tinged with affection. “Meanwhile, I presume everything went smoothly at the airport?"
Draco thought it unlikely that anyone would. There was an easy going vibe about Potter—and that wasn't superficial, exactly, but it wasn't the whole story either. Right underneath there was still a raw power to him. Salazar, it almost crackled at times.
“Yes, sir.” Draco took his hand and shook it, his expression respectful and overly deferential. “I stayed with one of the Baumgartens and her girlfriend in Hoboken, right outside the city.”
“That’s true.” Draco knew his tone was reluctant. “But I don’t want to change the terms again. Do you?”
The prospect of an afternoon with Hagrid did not fill Draco with joy. But this visit, he reminded himself, was for Harry’s sake. Harry clearly wanted him to get along with the oaf, so Draco would oblige.
“Yeah, it’s me.” He made it to the bed without further incident, sat down on it, and toed off his trainers.
Draco kissed the back of his neck. "Not to most of Britain's wizarding world, Harry. You know that." He paused to shift again, allowing his hands to work their magic just above Harry's arse. "What's really troubling you? So what if Skeeter publishes the truth? Nothing terrible will happen to Robards, you know. At worst, he'll be forced to resign. But he's too talented to be ruined. He'll weather out the scandal and end up heading some other important part of the ministry. At least that's what my father thinks."
Fuck. It was hard not to roll his eyes at the sarcasm dripping from Draco’s voice. “There’s that, yeah. But I want you to be sure.”
“Yeah, but, if they're both used to the idea of an arranged marriage, maybe it doesn't seem so bad to them.”
Draco let out a long-suffering sigh, but he didn’t argue. If he were to be completely honest with himself, he rather liked the idea of Harry seeing to him. “Very well. What does the letter say?”
It was a good meal. A brilliant one, really, and Ron found himself enjoying the ferret’s company. The bastard flirted shamelessly with Hermione, of course, but it was obviously harmless and she obviously thrived on it. And, anyway, Ron would punish him later by thrashing him at chess—Malfoy had promised him a game.
And there was the fact that Shira rarely emerged from her potions lab—a lab which she had quite illegally built into her cramped Hoboken apartment. Mordred only knew how many muggle regulations it violated.
“No. Dunno how she would have reacted to that, at least while they were dating. I just meant . . . look, Ginny was never the subservient type.”
“Compartmentalising like that. Draco reviews all his memories and decides which he wants to lock away somewhere in his mind. Even now, when he’s not under any threat.”
That scratching felt surprisingly good. Perhaps it wasn’t so bad, sitting on the ugly chesterfield with Harry and Weasley, even if Weasley were the one holding and petting him. Before he could stop himself, Draco nudged his head into Weasley’s hand and started dooking.
Harry scarcely remembered the flight back; the novelty of flying had worn off, he supposed. Or perhaps he was too preoccupied.
“Wait!” Harry turned back to Hagrid. “The war’s over. The trials are over. Can’t we all just sit together for a few minutes?”
“You’d have broken a bone. Yes, I know.” And Draco could have done; Harry was well aware of that. “But if you bite me again like that you’ll find yourself muzzled whenever you’re in ferret form. Understood?”
"I want a chance to see where this leads us, Draco." His green eyes were fond and determined and exasperated all at once.
Shit, Draco had actually hung up on him. Harry blinked and stared down at the phone in his hand, wondering if he should ring his boyfriend back. He’d only been teasing. He hadn’t known Draco was so upset.
“Of course we do,” Narcissa said in that posh, deceptively polite voice of hers. “As much as we would enjoy living in a wizarding bubble, Harry—is that short for something, by the way? Harold, perhaps, or Henry?”
“That doesn’t change all the rest.” Hagrid’s words were gruff and quiet. “I’m sorry, Harry, but— well, I can see you’re getting on with him. Or maybe you’re just being protective, him being in your service and all.” He pause as a guilty shadow passed over his face. “And I suppose Dumbledore, being how he was, would approve. But I’m not ready to welcome that twitchy little ferret here. Nor trust him either.”
Harry nodded and told himself that everything was going well. Apart from ferret-Draco biting him, the night had gone better than he expected. He would still have to deal with the Daily Prophet and whatever its idiot article had to say about the life debt, but that was tomorrow’s problem.
Bill, who was leaning forward in his chair, suddenly spoke up. "I don't suppose American guests are a good enough reason to get out of the assignment?"
“Benjamin and I are bringing them to the airport in a bit. We’re picking them up in Hoboken. Which is apparently an adventurous place for a car to go.”
Fuck, that went straight to Harry's groin. But he had to make one thing clear. "Only if you promise to enjoy every smack."
"Yes, sir." Draco kept his tone as respectful as possible. "We still need to, ah, iron out some details regarding the manor. We have to make certain that it's officially under Potter's protection so that the ministry can't seize it."
Ron had put that question out of his head just before nodding off. It ought to have been weird, he thought, falling asleep with the ferret nestled between himself and Hermione. But somehow it wasn't.
Harry managed to grumble something derogatory in response. He had not willingly gotten out of bed at such a ridiculous time since the early months of auror training, which had been rather like boot camp.
“I don’t have your courage, Harry.” Draco swallowed. “Not even a tenth of it. I never did. Just remember that when you see my memories of Dobby.”
Malfoy shrugged. “I had time to rehearse most of it in my head. Wasn’t hard to see his reaction coming.”
Draco went on for a full five minutes, his voice more and more enthusiastic. Harry didn’t understand the half of it, but he loved seeing Draco like this.
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Hermione was saying as she entered the room. Ron, meanwhile, was muttering something about the annoying clock.
Draco was staring at George now, hesitating. “I’m sorry too. For what I said about your family that day, and especially your mother—I didn’t mean any of that. I just . . . .”
Draco smiled up at him. “‘Fraid not. No shellfish either, or filet mignon, and no mixing meat and dairy.”
"I don't care that you were a Death Eater! That happened when you were a teenager. Fuck it, Draco. You stood trial for any wrongs you committed. It's over."
"Harry, mate, I didn't want to tell you this, but it's already all three. Why do you think I haven't brought you two 'round the Burrow yet?"
Narcissa nodded. “There’s been more than one marriage between the Baumgartens and the American branch of the Goldstein family.” She paused to give her son a gentle look. Then, to Harry’s surprise, she spared one for him too. “Harry, you might not be aware of this, but pure-blood marriages are often based on a solid friendship rather than a romance.”
By the time Draco rang off, Hermione was changing in the bathroom and Ron was changing on the other side of the bedroom.
Draco shrugged. "It's more comfortable than the guest room, so I did the polite thing and put you in here."
“I’m not sure that was possible by that point,” Harry said softly. “Besides—look, he’s happy now. All the pressure is off: Voldemort is dead. Robards has no more power over him. And I mean to keep him and his family safe.”
But looking down at Draco, especially after this cock-up, he knew the truth. He wanted to own him, he wanted that responsibility . . . and he wasn’t sure how their relationship would work without the life-debt as part of it.
“Is that what you were thinking while you and Harry beat the crap out of me?” Draco demanded. “That I’m so pretty?”
“Exactly as I say! Tell me what Robards has on you. Whatever it is, we’ll fix it. And then we'll tell Robards and the whole ministry to go and fuck themselves.”
Harry nodded grimly. He hadn’t forgotten that Draco once used the imperious curse on the pub owner. “I know. But that’s not what you were going to say.”
"Yes, I'm sure. I'll call in a few minutes; it's earlier there. And Kreacher and I will get you packed." Draco hesitated and then turned to the remaining Weasleys.
“I’m perfectly capable of kvetching now, Granger. And whinging and whining—just ask my lord and master up there.” He nodded his head toward the staircase that led to the first floor.
He sat up too, furrowing his brow. "Not quite. I think I'm also Draco when you've just pulled my arse out of a fire.”
Merlin, had the poor elf run up all those steps? He was too old for that. “Sorry, Kreacher. Where’s Draco?”
When Harry finally finished, Draco didn’t say a word. Harry summoned the courage to look him in the face, only to find him gazing thoughtfully toward the pews.
"Because of the way that fortune was acquired," Draco answered. "The Malfoys have spent centuries confunding and otherwise charming muggles out of their money and property. And, trust me, we're not the only pure-bloods in on that game."
“I don’t want you sitting up at night worried, Draco. But I don’t want to get sacked either. I just want the aurors to do things differently.”
Draco curled his lip. “But you managed to break into that memory regardless. Either you’re much better at legilimency than I ever imagined, or I’m losing my touch with occlumency.”
"That's not what I mean. I'm talking about actual happiness and fulfillment and—fuck, I want to wipe that sneer off your face."
Harry grabbed his wrist—his left wrist. “You didn't identify me to those Death Eaters when you could have. You saved my life at that moment. And when I took your wand—and all the wands in your hand—honestly, you hardly put up a fight.”
Some treacherous part of her brain reminded herself that this could all be an act. Perhaps, as Arthur feared, Draco was only pretending to be respectful and subservient. But, again, what would he gain from that? He could have had Harry, and all of Harry's help, without the life debt.
But Hagrid had answered at the same time. “Ten in Azkaban would have done for him! Five, even. Don’t care how old he was at the time—he let monsters in here, Harry. Into Hogwarts. He tried to kill Dumbledore.”
