As the man looked as if he was about to move closer to Draco, an arm was drawn over his shoulders and Draco almost jumped out of his chair - but a familiar voice spoke silently in his ear. “Don’t, Draco. Just go along, will you?”
This story was only supposed to be a short one-shot to distract me during my vacation. In a matter of days, it grew into a smaller monster that kept haunting me.
He sighed, releasing the ropes and letting his robe fall open. He saw Astoria’s eyes fall on his exposed body and he felt disgusted. “Do as I say, please.
“I can’t risk it, Harry.” Draco said, his voice sharp and cutting. Harry jumped slightly at the use of his name, nevertheless. “Should he end up in Slytherin, which I have no doubt he will, I won’t do anything to make his school years anymore difficult than they’ll already be due to his surname alone.”
“You can’t be sure he’d be bullied because of that.” Harry said, a stinging sensation going through his stomach at the thought his own kids might have to put up with harassment due to his and Ginny’s divorce.
When he came home that night, he didn’t care for Fleetwood, nor prosecco. At first he sat in total silence, agonising over nothing and everything all at once. What his life had become. What he had done to deserve to be so fucking miserable and cynical he couldn’t even find some bloody joy in just sitting in his own flat.
When Draco pulled back, Harry wished he’d remove his hand from his throat so he could follow. He didn’t want those lips to be too far from his. He wanted them close, so, so close. He would have felt embarrassed about the whine he let out, if he’d had any dignity left. He didn’t.
Schooling his expressions, Draco got down to business, following along with Gemma as they discussed the forthcoming hearing. Draco had drawn up a couple of momentary plans. Ones which hopefully would hold through the hearing if no further information came to light and would give Ginny a symbolic sum of one million galleons while the rest of Potter’s assets would befall their children at the time of his death. When the children reached their maturity, they would also receive a trust fund, something Draco had been surprised Potter hadn’t already put in place for his children at their birth, considering he had his own trust fund from his parents as an orphaned child. Should Harry collapse and die right this very moment, all his money would befall Ginny who then would distribute it to her children, both with Potter and the eventual future children she has with Shacklebolt. An absurd notion indeed.
In the middle of that hidden, comforting darkness, Potter had reached out and Draco had grasped his hand. A post-war existent in black and white had suddenly gained colour. He might have been hated by the entire wizarding would and protecting himself in the way he always did, by being nasty. But there was one person who saw beyond Draco’s shell, beyond his constructed persona and simply accepted things the way they were. No words were needed and it wasn’t much else but a few kisses, confused handjobs and mutual wanking - but Potter was right. It wasn’t just
“What’s this about, Potter?” Draco said, falling into step with Potter as they exited Gemma’s small office building in the south part of Diagon Alley.
“You what?” Draco bit out, his grey eyes glaring at Harry as Harry’s hand reached out, tracing Draco’s collarbones.
Harry shrugged, leaning closer to Draco, their lips brushing together. Draco drew a sharp breath before he pressed his lips against Harry’s. Harry felt as if his knees were about to collapse, his head spinning as Draco’s lips moved against his. The flick of Draco’s tongue tickling his lower lip and Harry couldn’t help the moan that escaped him. It felt like electricity went through him, the same pain and slight adrenaline shocked pleasure as when he’d tried sticking a paperclip into an electric socket in preschool.
for him, but also because Harry was a bloody auror. But, it wasn’t as if he could help himself and Draco
The hallway was empty and Draco straightened his tie before he headed off, glad to be leaving the Ministry - and confused about his non-existent non-feelings. He wasn’t supposed to feel this …
Harry loved watching him. It was difficult to keep his eyes away, even as they ate in silence. Draco was just eye-catching and it pained Harry that he never could be fully his. He’d been too late, too scared. The wedding band adorning Draco’s left hand shone with its golden glimmer and even though Harry knew it was a sham of a marriage, it still stung him to see the ring on Draco’s finger.
The house elf popped in a few seconds later, large brown eyes watery as she looked up at Draco with a hopeful expression on her face. “Master is wanting dinner?”
“What are you listening to?” Potter asked as Draco walked from the hallway and back into the living room.
Harry wasn’t exactly open with his emotions, but it was beginning to become difficult to hide from those closest to him. When he met Ginny and the kids after a week, he could see in the way she looked at him that she knew something was up. Even James seemed to notice, but neither said anything. Perhaps they thought it was the divorce.
Harry needn’t have worried. As he was let inside Gemma’s office by her secretary, she was smiling at him as she’d done all other times that they’d had a meeting.
Potter. He needed him like he’d never needed anyone before - and in the ten years since he’d felt his skin - his warm, silken skin and the heft of his hard prick in his hands and full, wet lips at the nape of his neck, Draco had lived a shadowed existence.
“Sure,” Harry shrugged. “I just don’t see Ginny doing this. She wouldn’t. It’s as easy as that.” They both looked troubled and Harry felt his cheeks flair. “What aren’t you telling me?”
“I don’t know.” Draco answered, his voice choked. Potter nods, lifting his pint to his lips. “She’s a good woman, nevertheless.” Draco said, his voice low and hoarse. He has to force the words out. “She knows I’m not faithful …And she accepts it. If she knows…”
Harry almost moaned from the sight alone when Draco fell to his knees before him, looking back up at Harry with his beautiful grey eyes and features so sharp they could cut you unless you were careful. His cheekbones were pink and his hair was falling into his face - and all Harry wanted was to bloody love him.
“Did she?” Draco pulled away from her touch, narrowing his eyes. “Well, yet another failure for father to blame me for then, it seems.”
“My point,” Draco said, pushing away from the counter and walking over to the kitchen isle, as he leaned forward over the stone counter, across from Harry and pointing his finger with the fag at Harry. “Is that you’re a bloody masochist with a saviour complex so bloody big you can’t see when you’re actively trying to kill yourself helping people you should stay the fuck away from.”
“Why are we even talking about this?” Draco bit out, at a loss of both patience and this infuriating game Potter appeared to be playing with him.
His father was silent, as if expecting Draco to say something - or simply taking some sadistic pleasure in making Draco squirm. As if he knew exactly what the old dolt was getting at. Maybe he had an inkling, but no matter what it was, he wasn’t about to admit to
married with a child? Be grateful that I still have contacts with enough sway to stop the Prophet from spreading disgusting rumours about you.”
Draco dearly wished he could be like the infamous Gallagher brothers. Punching paparazzi and giving them the fingers. Using people like punching bags whenever he felt like it, whenever he became too angry, too frustrated about his inconsequential life.
His flat looked out over Hyde Park through tall windows that spanned through three of the four rooms. It gave a calming view, especially during evenings and Draco enjoyed the minimalism of the décor he’d chosen. As opposed to the manor, which was opulent almost to the point being vulgar, Draco preferred to keep things as simple as possible. Still toothachingly expensive, as he found great pleasure in procuring muggle and wizard modern art and designer furniture.
Draco sighed, rolling onto his back and looking up into the roof of his four-poster bed. “Get me dreamless sleep.”
“So, Mr Potter,” Gemma said with a wry smile as they sat down and the secretary had poured them all tea. “Your hearing is tomorrow. I’ve been informed about Mrs Potter’s solicitor and I’ve been in contact with her. She’s not a bad one, I’d say, but I can assure you,” Gemma smiled, “I’m better.”
Then, there had been Ginny. Potter had basically flipped in a day - abandoning Draco to the shadows and the name-calling and harassment, all of it he surely deserved considering what he’d done during the war. But he’d felt used. Still fucking felt used - because it wasn’t Potter that had left Ginny, was it?
“Yeah,” he said then, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. As if it wasn’t completely absurd to begin with, not to imagine what others would say. Then again, why should other people know? Not everything needed to be public knowledge. But it was a futile notion, so why even contemplate it?
Harry walked up to his small home office and sat down by the desk that had once belonged to Sirius’ father, Orion. It used to be a dark room with heavy dark green curtains in crushed velvet and brown wallpaper. Now it was bright, but still cosy with dark types of wood and filled bookshelves.
“Yeah,” Harry cleared his throat, “I’ve got a guest. Would you mind preparing some lunch for us? Something… uh, fresh.”
He picked up the quill and scribbled down his apology. Harry wasn’t great with words and his handwriting was atrocious. It took him five tries before he just said ‘fuck it’ and blew on the ink to dry it before he rolled it up and sealed it with wax.
Potter smiled and drank from his wine as the thunder combined with the electric organ of Riders on the Storm played. Draco looked out his large windows, framed in high, white linen curtains. The light from the street below shone up into his flat, but the darkness from Hyde Park and the starry sky gave it a calm vibe together with the music. Draco found that he might, kind of, enjoyed being silent with Potter. Just sitting, enjoying the music and the wine. It’s not something he would have chosen himself, though he was completely unable to convince himself to throw him out. Maybe, Draco mused, trying his best to find a good enough reason for allow the pillock to remain, the book hadn’t been all that good, after all.
“Obviously, I know it’s not a healthy thing to either contemplate or to do. But, I doubt anything in my life has ever been what most
“Whatever might I do for you this morning, father?” Draco drawled when he put the clock back in his chest pocket. “Surely you could have owled.”
“I see,” Draco said, scribbling down the date, Potter’s full name and the circumstances in brief. “And are you sure you’d like
Harry moaned and when Draco held himself up against the headboard of the bed, quickening his pace, changing the position slightly, Draco must have hit the right spot for Harry, as he and a given a few more pushes and without warning, Harry came all over his stomach.
12 Grimmauld Place did still have a lot of work to be done, even though he’d spent countless weekends renovating it. Now, most floors had been done by, painted in light colours and the lingering dark magic had been removed. Walburga’s portrait hadn’t been easy to remove and Harry had to get help from Bill to at least manage to move the still screeching woman to the attic.
Draco chewed on his already pink and slightly swollen lower lip, as if weighing pro’s and con’s in his head.
Harry has issues with Draco not interacting very well with his children and the fact that Draco doesn’t like his own son very much provokes Harry beyond what Draco deems is normal. It’s a stick in Harry’s eye - something unfathomable that he simply can’t put his head around - and possibly never will be able to. Draco has let it go, given up on trying to even discuss it. It only leads to misery, and he’s had enough of that for a lifetime, ta ever so much.
When Draco pulled away from him, straddling Harry’s hips without any distracting grinding movement and just watching Harry, Harry realised Draco’s eyes were glimmering. He had a faint feeling of déjà vu, which wouldn’t in itself have been that strange considering that they’d fumbled about together in the darkness before, but then it hit Harry that it had been ages ago - and this was the first time he was on a bed with Draco.
Arthur had been by to collect the kids just fifteen minutes earlier. And Harry stopped breathing for a moment, as Ginny continued. “I can’t do this anymore, Harry. And I know you can’t either. You and I, we love each other. But we haven’t been in love with each other for a long time.”
“Where to even start?” Gemma leaned back with a cup of tea between her hands, “I don’t know the exact details, mind you, but it’s juicy. I mean, only the notion of the Golden Boy getting divorced? And from the horrid Weasley slut he married? I’m honestly surprised it’s not all over the Prophet as we speak. But, as he’s told me, due to the circumstances, they want to keep it quiet. And I can understand that, sure. I never thought I’d feel sorry for Harry bloody Potter, though. Dumbledore’s little special darling, but how can I not?”
to be advising you?” he asked. He didn’t really want to be advising Potter - not just because he prefers to avoid his actual job as much as possible, but mainly because it’s bloody
Maybe Harry was fooling himself and had been a right creep. It was honestly hard to tell. And all he could think of was that he wanted Draco. He wanted to feel his smooth skin underneath his fingers, his thin cold lips against his own and his body against Draco’s with all its sharp angles cutting into his muscles.
“Right.” Draco took a deep breath, itching for a fag. It was still strange not being able to have a fag in a pub, but muggle health regulations and all that… “So, you’re a liar, then?”
“Of course not.” Draco said, setting his glass down and walking over to his turntable to turn the record. “So, nothing better to do on a Friday night than crashing my party?”
Draco caught his eyes, for a moment bemusing how different Harry looked without his glasses - how much more alien his eyes looked when they weren’t hidden behind glass.
The sauce was good, of course, but normal people ate their pasta first and then, perhaps, soaked up the last of the sauce with a piece of bread. At least when you were out of the public eye, in a relaxed and more causal situation as this. Otherwise, absolutely not. His mother would have a fit.
Draco nodded, before moving past Harry - and Harry had to stop himself from reaching out and touching Draco. Instead, he followed him upstairs.
, Draco thought as he sagged against the wall, dragging his fingers through his hair, coughing. When he heard the door slam shut, Draco grabbed the bottle of wine Liffy had opened to air, and threw it against the wall with a scream.
“Yes?” Draco looked at him, the glass of wine in one hand as he leaned back against the chair, a strand of hair falling over his forehead.
Harry takes a hold of his hand quickly and pulls Draco back before he’s even had a chance to move out of the way, looking up at him with a wry smile.
Draco retched and a sour taste came to the back of his mouth. He tried to swallow it down, but it spread until he stumbled out of the armchair and ran heedlessly towards the closest toilet. Clutching the porcelain, Draco emptied the meagre contents of his stomach, breathing hard as tears streamed down his chin.
Yes, Draco had been involved. He’d been an arse, a fucking idiot and bloody horrible to Potter and so many others. But Potter didn’t seem to hold it against him, never really had, after. And Draco still wouldn’t blame him if he decided he did. If he knew of it all, Draco was sure he would. If Potter could read his thoughts, what he spent his days fantasising about, he wouldn’t just judge him. He’d fucking kill him. And what a mercy that would be.
Harry supposed he’d never know. He’d backed off for Draco’s and his own sake and he would keep doing so, unless Draco changed his mind. He’d always welcome Draco’s advances, but he had withdrawn his own, as it was obvious Draco had enough issues as it was.
“Bloody hell,” Draco rolls his eyes and leaves the kitchen, walking upstairs into the ground floor hallway.
Draco looked away, feeling too much. And he fucking hated it. The pandora’s box was beginning to slowly unravel and suddenly he was not just angry, incensed and frustrated - but afraid. What else had he tucked away, with the intent of never again touching it? But he was right - Potter was right - and Draco was lying to himself.
But he’d felt Draco’s emotions. In the kisses they’d shared. In the way his body reacted to Harry’s touch. It was obvious he was frightened, and Harry couldn’t fault him for that. He was scared too. So, the only thing he could do right now, which was the best option, rationally, was to back off for a while, without doing something rash. Give him space.
Kreacher appeared within fifteen minutes with their food, which surprised Harry. Maybe it also annoyed him a bit, considering how obvious it was that Kreacher did it for Draco’s sake, but Harry didn’t comment on it, and instead, sat down at the table as Draco sat down across from him.
As soon as they were inside, Draco pressed Harry up against the wall of his hallway, Draco’s hand around Harry’s throat and his lips lingering just over Harry’s, as if he was unsure. As if he was trying to control himself, make a decision, do
Or two, pull himself together and realise he needed to back off for a while. He knew, had seen in Draco’s eyes that he was unsure, divided about Harry. That he felt something too, he was so very damaged and it pained Harry to witness him like that. To see him shift between masks of anger, fury and arrogant pettiness. In between, you could see the slivers of vulnerability Harry had seen in the darkened hidden classrooms ten years ago, though he had become even better at hiding, Harry had to admit.
He’s still cold on the outside, but Harry accepts that. Just like Draco accepts the fact that Harry’s a blunt buffoon severely lacking in table manners most of the time. It gives a certain spice to everyday life, he supposes. But, Harry makes him happy. As happy as someone like Draco can be. If it’s happiness as defined by others, he doesn’t know. And, in all honesty, he doesn’t care about other people’s definition of happiness anymore. It drains him too much and gives very little in return.
Draco lights what he’s promised Harry to be his last fag. He’s sitting in the back garden of 12 Grimmauld Place. He told Astoria yesterday he’s selling the flat over by Hyde Park. He also told her about Potter.
Draco laughed, his mouth widening into a beautiful smile even as he cackled like his demented aunt. “You bloody pillock. How can you be okay with that? Do you hate yourself that much, Potter?”
.” And Potter looked ashamed as he said it. Draco supposed he could empathise. After all, he never found Astoria especially stirring, even though she’s one of the most striking women he’s seen. “The divorce… Ginny brought it on, but - it’s mutual. I’ve wanted to date other people for years… And Shacklebolt came into the picture, and honestly, I’m not even angry. I want her to have a good life. Just like I want a good life.”
He really did look beyond beautiful with his bared chest and opened trousers. Harry didn’t know where to begin and even though his cock had managed to regain some stiffness again, he couldn’t help his nerves getting to him. He hadn’t got a clue as to how to proceed beyond this point.
James and Albus had taken it better than Harry had thought. Lily didn’t understand what was happening and was so used to spending a majority of her time with Ginny anyway. But James and Albus, they sort of understood. Perhaps not fully, but when Harry and Ginny had sat down with them, they’d listened,
He ignored the people when he entered Gringotts. He ignored the people in the lift. And he definitely ignored his assistant as she spoke to him. He didn’t listen, didn’t even take his headphones off as he shut the door in her face, again, dropping his satchel on a chair and shrugging out of his coat and replacing it with hiss robes. He sat down in his chair and leaned back, listening to his music.
It was a good, fresh Pecorino and Harry took a long sip after having handed Draco a glass. Harry gestured for them to sit down in the sofas as they waited. Draco did, sitting leaned against the arm with his leg crossed over his knee. He looked ever so like the aristocrat he was and it pained Harry to admit he actually resembled his father quite a bit when he sat just so, a glass of wine in his hand and that damned snotty expression on his face, as if he’d just smelled something awful. Harry felt like an idiot for finding it charming.
Harry shook his head as he chewed, his mouth closed this time. To Harry’s surprise Draco just chuckled and returned to his dish.
Potter licked his lips with a smile, looking at Draco for a moment whilst leaning over his plate with his elbow on the table, before he took a slice of bread, tearing it apart and scooping up sauce with the bread. Draco sighed internally, rolling his eyes.
Draco was different from most others in that he’d been so very close to the dark magic during such a long period of his adolescence. He’d been exposed to horrific things, seen things most people wouldn’t recover from. Just like Harry. And still - they were so very alike in parts, but also so very different.
He’d come by on a whim, being lucky enough to be let in by a nice old neighbour of Draco’s, an old lady living just next door. All it took was a charming smile and telling her that he’d gone to the same boarding school as Draco. The woman mentioned some placed called ‘Eton’ and Harry had just nodded and said that was it. The old lady was more than happy to let Harry in.
After a few seconds, Astoria put the book and her glasses away and pulled her nightgown up to her waist before she got on her knees and turned around. It was easier with just her arse in the air. The round shapes of her hips were difficult to ignore, but as long as Draco relied on conjured images in his mind and the pink potion, he could pretend the wet heat from her cunt was something else, someone else. Giving his cock a few pulls, he took his position behind her, took a deep breath and then pressed inside. He was dry, and so was Astoria. She whimpered from pain and Draco pressed down on the small of her back and clenched his jaw, shutting his eyes. It would be over soon.
Harry felt himself grow hard immediately and as he pressed himself against Draco, he could feel Draco’s body responding in the same way, which only egged Harry on - made him want to just feel and touch Draco in every way possible. Forgotten was the glasses of wine, the still burning fag in the sink and every last harsh word Draco had ever spoken.
“I don’t mean to be… Forward.” Harry cleared his throat, worrying his lower lip. “But, you’ll never divorce her, will you?”
Draco sauntered into the former dining room and looked around. Harry hadn’t done much in there, except turn it into a sitting room filled with a cosy large sofa and armchairs around the fireplace. On the walls hung portraits of late Black’s that weren’t as loud as Walburga, along with a few muggle paintings of landscapes. It was a fine enough room, filled with plants and small decorations Harry had found hidden away in the attic. Draco suited the room, looked like he had always been here, by simply existing. As if the house itself just recognised him and made him a part of it.
Things… Hadn’t gone to plan. Not that Harry ever really had a plan to begin with, with most things that he did. He usually just went for it and hoped for the best. But Draco was different than all other things he’d done in his life so far.
He hadn’t cooked food himself in about three months, resulting in the sight of two rotten potatoes and a half eaten jar of jam. Maybe he should clean up his act a bit in that department. But then again, why? He was still a wizard with a smaller army of house elves at the snap of his fingers.
He hadn’t heard anything about any new ‘accidents’ or hospital visits for Draco, which at least helped Harry to keep calm and remember he needed to be patient. But it’d been two weeks. Perhaps it was best to just send the apology and hope to god the meeting on Monday wouldn’t be too horribly awkward.
Draco felt a cold shiver down his spine as he watched his father with a neutral expression. The jab about his mother’s nerves was uncalled for, certainly, but Draco remained silent, which was always a better card to play when it came to his father’s rage, at least until you knew what he was on about.
Draco looked pained, if only for a moment before he managed to control his expressions. Harry saw the anguish, the desperate need to hold on to a broken mechanism of defense that didn’t really work, but one that Draco had become so used to, Harry imagined he’d feel even more broken without it. The view of the world that Draco had - the society in which he had grown up - it had formed him into a cold and so emotionally constipated person Harry didn’t even know where to begin. All he knew, and he’d accepted it, come to terms with it, was that he wanted Draco - baggage and all. Perhaps that in itself was him emotionally abusing himself, Harry couldn’t tell. But he didn’t want anything else but to see if things could work out between them.
The pain from that Friday evening was still present. It didn’t disappear, no matter what Harry did, but he learned to live with it, strangely enough. He had before, after all. But then, he’d been able to focus on Ginny instead and transfer all those confusing emotions on her and the normal relationship he had with her.
. It was a historical fiction he’d gotten from Pansy last Christmas, written by a colleague of hers that had spent several years in Egypt digging up old vampire’s scrolls. So far, Draco didn’t hate the book, so he decided a couple of pages along with his wine before dinner couldn’t hurt.
“Well, what are you waiting for?” Draco said, grinning sadistically as he gestured for her to pour. She said something, but Draco didn’t hear it - he was too occupied by the tickling sensation underneath his skin and the music still in his ears, shutting out all outside noise. With a pursed, sour expression, she poured his tea.
He didn’t have a meeting with Malfoy in the next two weeks, and unless Malfoy spoke to Gemma Zabini about what he did during his private time, Monday morning at her office would be fine. Or, it would be bloody awkward.
“The funds for you children are already in place, Mr Potter. I’ve drawn up the papers of Godric’s Hollow, preparing for the transfer of the house to Mrs Potter at the end of next month. However,” Draco paused, clearing his throat. “There may be some possible issues concerning 12 Grimmauld Place.”
The realisation in itself was painful and disgusted Draco. It disgusted him what he’d done to himself, what he’d put others through. But it still scared him to embrace the change, letting the realisation work its way through him and forcibly bend Draco into some sort of self-acceptance.
to hold back. Perhaps he could indulge just this once - perhaps it would sate the demon inside him, help him find some sort of solace, some calm, if he only gave in.
Draco imagined it was different from what Potter was used to. The Weasley were pure-bloods, yes, but they were poor and had next to no class. They lived in a hovel that was magically held together by the grace of god alone, and from what Draco had heard, they weren’t much for actual decoration. And Potter, well, he’d grown up amongst middle class muggles. Draco didn’t imagine Potter’s ancestral home that he had rebuilt in Godric’s Hollow contained much original art. He knew 12 Grimmauld Place did, however. But last time he’d been there, it had been so poorly kempt since the 80’s that it was now falling to pieces.
Harry was a bit speechless, honestly. “She wouldn’t.” Harry said and as he looked up from the scroll Draco had given him. Ass he looked at Gemma and Draco both, he realised she might. They looked slightly worried and he didn’t care for that at all.
Second, what were the reasons for their divorce? What could possibly have happened for Potter to be worried about the finances? Normally, in the few cases of divorce that’s heard of every year, the finances were the least of the issues in the settlements.
He’d gone clubbing with Blaise and Pansy in muggle London before he got married. He seldom went out now, as Astoria would whinge and nag him silly about ‘responsibilities’ if she found out. He did find himself in pubs and bars, sitting at the bar in silence drinking muggle whisky, searching for some handsome muggle to fuck in the toilets if possible. But he was on his own then, as he was far from open about his sexuality to anyone.
“Malfoy,” Gemma bit out through clenched jaws, obviously holding herself back while looking concerned as she glanced at Potter, who now looked less gone in his own thoughts and instead more present, out-right furious and ready to leave. “Why would you say something like
He hated how it felt as if his insides somersaulted and his chest swelled when he saw Potter. He didn’t like it one bit and wished desperately for Potter to just go back to his ugly clothes, without a sharp jawline and that bloody hipster beard that it seemed he’d gone all in for as he’d merged into adulthood. He also, pettily, wished he could break his nose again - or maybe just his glasses.
“It doesn’t matter right now, Harry.” Ginny had answered, “The important thing right now, is that you know that this wasn’t your fault and nothing’s happened between me and him. But I can’t continue like this anymore.”
Draco pulled back, straightening himself and clearing his throat again. It felt dry, as if he’d swallowed a handful of sand and he wanted to cough. Instead, he looked at Potter, who just stood there, his hands now in his pockets.
Draco’s mother sat to his father’s right, silently and neatly as she cut into the sliced roast on her plate, watching as the juices from the meat spread with the light gravy as she took well measured bites and chewed in silence with a tightly closed mouth where lines were beginning to show her real age. Her fair hair was perfectly coiffed and pulled atop her head and her slim shoulders looked relaxed at first glance, though it was all a play for the masses. Not that there were any masses gathered in this dining room anymore, thank god.
Draco turned slightly and Potter stood beside him, glaring at the man sitting to Draco’s left, who now looked stricken, but backed off.
Draco tried not to roll his eyes and instead plastered on that bloody smile he’d worked at for years now and still failed at, every time.
When Gemma Zabini had recommended he’d go see Draco Malfoy for financial advise concerning his divorce and his assets, Harry had been hesitant. But from then on, the thought of just going to him, seeing him had whirled in his head and one day when he was sat at his desk at the Auror’s Office at the Ministry, he’d just decided to go over to Gringotts in Diagon Alley and have it done with. Malfoy could refuse him and he’d get someone else. Maybe his cowardice hope he would be rejected, if only so he could stop thinking about him.
And it hit Harry, that he would essentially have to get to know Draco again. Of course, he was still Draco. Snobbish and condescending, but frail and soft when you got past those very sharp edges of his.
Potter meet his eyes for a moment before looking away, his normally open expression looking pained for a second, before he managed to go back to a neutral look. It enticed Draco, awakened his curiosity and he had to control his expression to keep his act of nonchalance in place.
“Sure,” Potter shrugged, giving Draco what could be easiest described as some sort of shit-eating grin, which only made Draco’s anger flair. “Whatever you say, babe.”
Harry straightened his shirt cuffs and made sure is tie hadn’t slipped to the side as he came closer and closer to Gemma’s little office. His hair probably looked like shit as it always did and Harry had long since given up honestly caring. The only thing he cared about right then and there, was that Gemma wouldn’t have a go at him. That Draco hadn’t fucking dropped him and told the entire world about them.
Alas, him and Harry, they’re not in any way open about their relationship to the general public. Draco is still married to Astoria and he’s not planning on divorcing her. She can spend her time as she pleases - just as he can. But they still have Scorpius. They’re what people call ‘estranged’. Which isn’t very different from how it’s always been between them. Draco’s just stopped trying to get her pregnant again. It’s something neither of them miss.
He began to recite the lyrics in his head, imagining the bassline, the drums and flowing guitar if only to have something else to think of, aside from his miserable family that’s more like the shadows of themselves these days. Not that they haven’t always been such, but he can remember his mother looking less like a pale ghost and when Draco was younger, his father’s eyes used to have an intensity to them. Now, everything just feels dull.
“Still some life in the old thing yet,” Draco commented as he poured the butter sauce over his steamed fish. “Haven’t seen him since I was a child. Better behaved these days, I’ve got to say.”
He really did have a meeting that afternoon with his co-workers and the goblins. Goblins where in reality horrid little creatures, nasty to work with and generally insufferable in their inability to even try to understand human customs. But they paid well and Gringotts where the only wizarding bank in Britain. There existed wizarding banks that was owned by humans, the largest one could be found in Russia, but Draco did not feel like learning Russian and he definitely didn’t feel like moving to Russia either. Though, he had visited as a part of his job and found the thought of it, in a theoretical sense to be interesting.
“You’ve rectified it since the 19th century,” Draco drawled, crushing the butt of his fag in the ashtray. “Now, back to Potter. Have you brought the documents I need? And when’s the hearing between the two parties?”
Blaise, Marcus and Anthony didn't bloody care. Neither did the barristers sitting at the bar or the ministry officials sitting two tables down. It’s all about image, how things look. It’s a cacophony of fancy words that ring as hollow as their laughter amongst the faux gold that adorns the decorations inside the establishment and Draco felt as hollow as his own laughter. It’s a reflection of how empty he was at this point. It’d been ten years since the war and so little had changed, and still -
“I didn’t want to bring it up, but…” Harry winced at his own idiocy - but he supposed he’d already begun so he might as well just throw himself overboard and get at it. “Did you get my letter?”
He was well aware of how unprofessional it was to act as he had towards Draco. Not only because Draco was his financial advisor at the moment, and
“Malfoy,” Potter said as Draco pulled on his coat and winding his scarf around his neck. “You have a minute?”
“I’m going to have a fag.” Draco said, rising from his chair and looking at the bartender who nodded at him. “Don’t feel obliged to wait for me.”
“You won’t believe this,” Gemma said, her voice low and almost a whisper as she leaned forward. “It’s absolutely mental, but… Ginny’s left him. For Kingsley Shacklebolt.”
Aside from the slight hiccups - which, depending on how you see it, could subjectively be viewed as perhaps not so small, though Draco prefers to view things more objectively - he’s happy. He thinks.
Instead, he plastered an obviously false smile on his face as he put his headphones and muggle iPod away, telling his assistant to bring Potter in in two minutes. She nodded and left, and Draco took the two minutes to make sure his suit and robes were as immaculate as his hair and face.
then cried, then cried some more when Harry left. It had broken his heart all over again. The tears came as soon as he left and with James and Albus crying, Lily’s tears came as if on cue. It made Harry resent Ginny for wanting to go ahead with the divorce, even though he knew it was unfair of him, but he couldn’t help himself. He felt depressed for the first time in years and he needed someone to fucking blame, didn’t he?
“Gemma Zabini,” Potter leaned back in his chair, looking slightly more relaxed. And that would explain why Draco had been recommended.
. He’d gone from obsessing over Potter, to obsess over being what wizard society deemed ‘normal’. Draco had silently accepted the fact that he’d have to life a tortured life, that he didn’t
, Draco begged his brain to take the all too vivid thoughts away as the whisky sloshed from his glass onto his thighs.
He didn’t say any of those things however, and instead just sighed and moved aside, letting Potter inside.
He looked gaunt, tired. His pointed features were made even more pronounced than usual in the sharp light and the dark bags underneath his eyes had started to show his age. He wasn't twenty anymore and it din’t bother him. Draco enjoyed growing older, growing more dignified and less bothered by things in general - or at least he imagined himself to be less bothered. He was a narcissistic bastard, still, even though the melodrama of his youth had escaped him with age. Though he despised his light complexion. It makes him ghost-like - Astoria claimed it was striking. Draco knew her lies.
Draco had never been warm, exactly. He’d been vicious in school and he could still be. Vicious to the point of sadistic. It was only one of his many faults and even though Harry knew he himself had a way of just shrugging Draco’s less savoury parts off like they didn’t mean as much, he was well aware of them. Well aware of the consequences of those vicious traits. His feelings for Draco didn’t change because of them, however, and maybe Harry was sick in his own way because of not finding Draco as a person despicable. But he simply couldn’t, because he also knew about the other sides of him. The vulnerability, the well-hidden softness and the dry spots of humour that Draco accidentally allowed him to see.
Astoria who was supposed to love him, pretends and takes his money just like the whore, and still she had the audacity to fault him for fucking them. Did she not realise she wasn't all that different from the prostitute in the alleyway - aside from the fact that Draco had bought her a ring and said some meaningless words during a ridiculous ceremony orchestrated by his mother?
Starman began playing and Draco smiled softly into his pint. He was ticked off, but music had a way of calming him, and considering the abhorrent music which was usually played in London’s gay bars or bars in general these day - for Bowie to come on, seemed almost like a sign of sorts.
Draco ran his hands down Potter’s broad back, giving a sharp nod along with a deep intake of breath. He wanted to feel Potter closer, his warm skin against his. God, Draco was tired of impersonal, of shallow and meaningless endeavours. When he finally allowed himself to let go, he could so very clearly feel the magnetism radiating between them - a pull so strong he felt lost and frightened, but at the same time -
Of course he fucking wanted to. But it’s not like he was going to admit it. Ever. It’d be a cold bloody day in hell when Draco didn’t do everything in his power to make Potter’s life more difficult.
He had shagged a guy in drag a couple of weeks back after having drinks in a muggle gay bar just off of Leicester Square, and they’d retreated back to Draco’s flat to finish the night off. It had been risky, however, his flat was in a purely muggle part of London and they had been discreet. Could that have come out somehow? The person recognising him seemed to have thought the man in drag was a woman, so maybe? Either way, it was a close call which would need to never be repeated. Draco had known it was a bad idea, but his cock in combination with the alcohol had ignored the red flags.
“I can promise you that we will, Mr Potter.” Gemma said. “Mr Malfoy and I have gone over your finances and all seems to be in order. Have you anything you wish to add, Malfoy?”
The door to Draco’s flat slammed shut behind him and Harry leaned back against it, breathing heavily as he dragged his hands over his face, back again and through his hair.
The room around them was a beautiful room lit up with smaller lights combined with candles and the modern fireplace.
“Master sent for Liffy,” she said, anxious, “Tell Liffy what to do for master. Liffy will help, yes she will.”
“I-“, she stuttered and Draco wanted to roll his eyes, but took a deep breath instead. “I’m sorry Mr. Malfoy. You have a visitor.”
It took his breath away for a moment, before he allowed himself to fall. Harry caught him, his soft lips tracing every sharp contour of Draco’s body until they both had been divested of all their clothes. Harry laid there, his eyes lidded and glimmering as his chest rose and fell, his lips slightly parted and his black hair even more mussed than it usually was.
Potter shrugged. “Probably not. Perhaps with the boys, but Lily’s too young to leave Ginny. Maybe when she’s older.”
Whatever it was she believed she knew; Harry had no idea. He didn’t ask and didn’t exactly care about it. He was still trying to come to terms with the fact that his marriage since ten years was over - and he hadn’t been prepared for how awful it made him feel. Awful, and at the same time… Free.
Draco sighed, feeling his heart break for the thousand time. Finally he deflated, all of him. From his stiff neck and shoulders down to his toes. If he only could, he’d love to snog Potter - or any man - outside of this bar. Hold his bloody hand in Diagon Alley, to go out to dinner with him without people staring. He’d love to share his life with a man, to be able to bring him home to his parents, like he’d brought Astoria home. But it isn’t possible, is it?
Draco glanced at him, but didn’t say anything. Instead, he appeared to be quite content, sipping on his wine as he looked around the room. Harry was silent as they sat there, just watching Draco and twirling his glass of wine. He wasn’t much of a day drinker normally, but he’d never said no to a glass of wine or a beer with lunch.
“Need anything from the shop?” Draco asks. “I’ll let Kreacher have the night off. He must be exhausted by the little monsters.”
Draco ignored the looks people threw him and just stared straight ahead, waiting for his turn. Unfortunately, when he stepped into the lift, he came face to face with Arthur Weasley. Draco just kept his face blank and locked eyes with him for a moment, refusing to take his headphones off. He doubted Arthur wished to talk to him in any case.
“Glad to hear it,” Harry nodded, focusing on Gemma. In the corner of his eye, he could see Malfoy making notes, shuffling his scrolls around, as if restless. Harry tried to just look away. “I’m sure we’ll be able to reach sufficient results.”
Potter noticed Draco watching his wrist and with a slanting of his lips, he said, “It was Fabian Prewett’s.”
He was still drunk from too many glasses of whisky, and he staggered as he scrubbed his skin clean from imagined dirt. His sluggishness didn’t stop him from leaning against the tiled wall, his breathing heavy and strained as he let his hand wander down between his legs, stroking back and forth as the heat from the water sprayed against his skin. If he imagined eyes too green with hair too black and tanned skin beneath him, he did so without acknowledging it. He just had his wank, easily reaching his release before grabbing the shower handle from above him, stumbling slightly from drunkenness and post-orgasm breathlessness and rinsing off his spunk before crashing into bed, his hair still wet and his breath stinking like a bloody brewery.
When it was done, Draco stood speaking to one of the barristers while glancing at Potter, who was speaking to Gemma. Draco caught Potter’s eyes and inclined his head with a quick nod, hoping Potter would understand to follow him.
Draco smiled, putting out his cigarette on Harry’s abandoned plate. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Potter.”
He couldn’t even begin to consider what Potter might want from him aside from his financial advice. The whole situation was awkward enough as it was. For Potter to approach him outside of their meetings only made Draco feel uncomfortable.
“With the funds, they will be.” Draco said, meeting Potter’s eyes before looking away again. “At least as good as they can be during the circumstances.”
Ignoring the fact that he himself had only been able to get Draco’s mother pregnant once, Draco almost threw his cup of tea at his silent but very much judgemental father at the breakfast table. It didn’t matter that it was all in his head, he could see in his father’s eyes, he meant it. He’d always blamed Draco’s mother for being unable to carry more children.
things. Feelings were beneath him, especially feelings about a good buggering from a man who was supposed to be his bloody arch nemesis.
The only difference between their ‘refined’ Afternoon Tea in their too large and ostentatious gardens and Draco and his so-called friends’ gathering in this distasteful establishment of a finer pub in Diagon Alley, is that Draco and his ilk have cocks and their wives do not.
Draco left a few pound notes with Pansy before shrugging on his coat and wrapping the scarf around his neck.
Harry’s blood was boiling. It had been ever since Gemma told him about Ginny’s statement, or rather, her claim. Harry hadn’t been with
Draco rolled his eyes, reaching into his pocket for the brushed brass etui in which he kept cigarettes for especially draining situations. His father gave him a disgusted look as Draco lit a fag, still refusing to sit down in front of his father and instead leaning against the shelves Potter had stared into during a majority of their awkward meeting yesterday.
Here is a link to the video that inspired me to write this in the first place: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBOnE79LTQE
“Right.” Draco feels sick thinking of Astoria as Potter speaks. His striking wife, bound to him - feathered to the manor with a lover or two every now and then. Was it fair?
Bowie’s Station to Station sounded in Draco’s headphones as he stepped out of the floo at the Ministry. He never liked being here as it reminded him of his own trials. It seemed he reminded others of his trials as well, considering the way people stared at him as he walked towards the lift, easily falling into the long cue of people needing to get to one of the too many underground levels.
Nothing was solved that afternoon and Ginny, through her solicitor, rejected the plans Draco had drawn up, apart from the trust funds for their children. Draco hadn’t expected anything else. From his experience of divorce proceedings, they took time.
Lucius Malfoy didn’t agree, naturally, and he tried to beat the queer out of Draco as well as he could. The mere sight of his father’s cane still made him shiver, even though he hadn’t been frightened by the sight of it since his late teens. Draco didn’t know if his father thought he’d succeeded with his beatings, but he didn’t really care anymore.
“Kreacher still around?” Draco asked, still standing with his beautiful back towards Harry. His shoulders broad but skinny and his hips slim.
Astoria knew it was useless. Once every week they do this, only to keep some semblance of intimacy. Perhaps she could become pregnant again. Draco hoped not and he was fairly sure Astoria took potions preventing her from becoming pregnant, seeing as she kept lovers of her own. Sporadic and in secret, though she wasn't nearly as discreet as she believed. Draco didn’t care and he knew his disinterest in her hurt her. His semi-open infidelities hurt her. Should she know it was men he preferred to stick his cock into, she’d probably demand a divorce.
“Deep Purple’s debut album from ’68.” Draco said as he took the bottle of wine from Harry and lead him into the living room. It looked just the same as it had done that Friday. The
Potter looked somewhat flabbergasted as his eyes raked up and down Draco’s body and Draco immediately became very self-conscious, considering his state of dress. He was usually very picky about what he chose to wear, especially in front of other people and he was very much not comfortable standing here with Potter, dressed in joggers and a t-shirt without even socks on his feet.
He was so sick of it, the shallowness. It wasn’t just boring, dull. It was frustrating and horrible in so many ways he hardly knew himself where to start.
And so it began. The first of several tiering hearings, as it quickly became clear that this would indeed be a very drawn-out process and Potter’s mindless statements about what Ginny would and wouldn’t do had been almost comically wrong.
Draco remained silent. What was he supposed to say? He was married to a woman himself - a hypocrite if anything.
“Bloody hell,” Potter said, sounding tired. “I’m sorry. I didn’t think. I’ll make an appointment with your assistant and come back-”
“Bollocks,” Draco said, draining the last of his pint, ordering another. “Put these on him.” He told the bartender, pointing at Potter, who simply shrugged in agreement. “See,” Draco said, “This is
Just before Draco apparated them away to 12 Grimmauld Place, Harry realised why he’d thought of that song. Draco looked just like Bowie did on that album. It was bloody eery. And the damned lyrics in combination with that was even worse. Harry looked into Draco’s eyes as they whirled away through time and space, existing in nothingness for a few milliseconds, before they landed on the steps leading up to his home, Draco’s ancestral home on his mother’s side.
“And now you do? After spending almost ten years in a relationship with a woman?” Draco laughed, no - cackled. “Have you even been with a man, aside from a piss poor blowjob ten years ago?”
Harry nodded, “I… Yeah, I guess I get it. The war,” he cleared his throat, clasping his hands on the kitchen isle and shifted slightly on the barstool, “We’re all kind of fucked up from it still, Draco. It’s not just you. The war… It left me a killer. I did horrible things and I prepared to die. To stay dead.” Harry looked down into the white marble with its swirling gold and glittering inlaid stones. “What I mean to say is, I haven’t blamed you for what you did, when we were kids or during the war, in a long time. Perhaps… What I would want is for you to not blame me for being a confused kid. I’m not defending what I put you through or what I did, but I am sorry for it.”
What they said bores Draco. Their words are useless and tiering, without meaning. It’s all gossip concerning worthless individuals, business cards, acquaintances and the whores they slept with. Draco pretended to sleep with the same whores as Blaise, Marcus and Anthoy. He pretended to be interested in the same gossip of unimportant colleagues. The fact was, Blaise, Marcus and Anthony sounded worse than their wives when they gathered for what they pretended to be
“Where’s the dining room, then?” Draco asked, turning around with his eyebrows lifted. “Seeing as it’s been turned into a sitting room.”
Draco frowned, staring at the bags of crisps hanging from the wall on the other side of the bar. “What way?” he asked.
“Master called,” Kreacher croaked, reminding Harry of the hunchback in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
With a somewhat regretful and longing sigh, Draco stubs out his last fag and vanishes it from the ashtray before he rises from the chair and heads back inside.
Draco didn’t want to think on his father’s own mistresses. He could scold Draco as much as he wished for not being discreet enough, but Draco was well aware of his father’s own exploits. He hadn’t been exactly discreet himself. Draco could remember at least four women from his youth that his father had cheated on his mother with. They were all cash grabbing whores who thought they’d be able to snare the great and influential Lucius Malfoy.
“Yeah?” Harry was breathless and all he wanted was to push Draco back against the brick wall of Gemma’s office building and push his tongue down his throat. He didn’t care anymore. Ginny could have all the money she wished - because, yeah, she was technically right, wasn’t she? Harry hadn’t been physically unfaithful - but he couldn’t deny he’d failed in being a devoted husband mentally. He couldn’t.
“Liffy is making pasta. Should I ask her to do more?” Draco asked, sitting down in his Jetson again and motioning for Potter to sit in the cognac-coloured leather sofa across from Draco.
“What are you doing?” Draco hissed, “Maybe it’s you I should be afraid of. What are you even doing here?”
“Draw on that, if you please. Leave the drawers alone.” Draco drawls before he shrugs off his jacket and hangs it by the door. He steals a glance down at James’s homework, rolling his eyes. “Thank god you’re not a teacher, Potter.”
He looked so different, sitting there over Harry’s hips, his clothes somewhat rumpled and his hair tousled, hanging down over his forehead and cheekbones. And still, he was a marvel. So bloody beautiful it almost hurt a little to look too closely.
He resented his family - and himself for his weakness - for the situation he’d been forced into. He could already taste the pink potion in the back of his mouth and it made in nauseous.
He’d already been crushed, and along came the Golden Boy - the Saviour of their kind and Draco’s obsession for the last two years. Along came a mountain of repressed emotions and urges he knew was impossible, for so many fucking reasons. And yet, in darkened rooms as they finished their N.E.W.T’s, which Draco had been ordered by the Wizengamot to do with the other students while almost constantly watched by aurors and angry, mourning students - something had happened between them.
“Inside, already.” She said. “He’s talking to the undersecretary who’ll preside over the hearing along with the barristers.”
As he looked at Harry now, he found him to be beyond handsome with his tanned skin and muscled body what was like something from a Greek painting. Draco was smitten, absolutely beyond drunk on whatever this was.
“So,” Harry said, sitting down by the kitchen isle as he watched Draco lean back against the counter when he’d finished with the cheese plate. “How… Uh, how are you doing, Draco?”
Potter gave a nod and sat down, leaning back in his chair and spreading his legs wide. It only ticked Draco off even more than Potter’s mere presence in his office and Draco straightened in his chair, clearing his throat.
His father’s sneer turned into a sly small smile as he rose from Draco’s chair. “Anyone I know?” He asked, raising an eyebrow.
The two weeks didn’t go by very fast. Harry almost owled Draco two times during that time, drunk and miserable - but he managed to control himself, which he was glad for when he woke up in the morning.
Instead, Draco suggested the symbolic sum to Ginny along with a trust fund at Gringotts for each Potter child, containing one million each - which should be enough to sustain them until adulthood.
“I…” Harry sighed, shaking his head and looking away from Draco for a moment. “I meant it. Every word. I don’t know what you want Draco, but whatever you decide, I’ll respect that. I can’t take away what’s happened between us, ten years ago or a couple of weeks ago.”
“You’re having a party?” Potter asked with a grin as he leaned back in the sofa, balancing his glass of wine on his thigh.
His mind was occupied by other things. Well, Potter, mainly. Potter visiting bars close to where he knew Draco lived, and obviously not that far from where Potter lived. Visiting gay bars in the hopes he would run into Draco in one of them. He could have just owled him. Not that Draco would have answered - and he supposed that was he whole point of looking for him in pubs close to where he lived. Christ, was he that obvious for a person like Potter?
Astoria put the book down and watched him silently. Draco drew a deep breath, leaning against the bedpost closest to Astoria’s hidden feet.
“Hm?” Draco looked into Potter’s eyes, feeling something fluttering in his stomach. He tried to ignore it and focus on the fact that he actually hated this man and would prefer him to leave. Draco realised, of course, that he needed to practice more on lying to himself.
“Who?” Was all Harry could say. He felt empty and his throat felt thick and dry at the same time. It was as if his life had turned into a house of cards that was suddenly brought down by a puff of wind.
Draco looked at Harry, biting into his lower lip, almost looking like a sleek, fantastical predator, hunched over Harry.
Potter looked around, humming as he shoved off his boots and hung his jacket and scarf on the hatstand beside the door.
Well, even if it was, his official dealings with Draco would soon be over, as he’d not heard anything else from Gemma. Hopefully, the settlements could be reached quickly and Ginny wouldn’t object to the financial plans Draco and Gemma had drawn up. It was difficult to tell, really. Harry knew nothing of finances and cared even less. There was a reason financial advisors were in great need, after all.
He’d been in the Knockturn Alleyway with the whore two days ago, but they had been completely alone, Draco had made sure of it. If it came out he’d been blown by a male prostitute, his father wouldn’t think it a mistress and the conversation they’d just had would have been very different and ended in a much less amicable way. It would be such a scandal his father wouldn’t have been able to stop it from being front page news, no matter what strings he pulled or how many people he bribed.
He’d had two fucking miserable weeks after Potter had left. Pandora’s box was now fully opened and Draco found himself at the point of no return.
Draco trailed kisses down Potter’s neck, allowing himself to take in his scent, the way the curls of his hair and his beard felt against Draco's lips and skin - how it made Draco’s body react in the most delicious of ways. It was freeing and strangely wonderful.
“Good,” Potter shrugged, still smiling. “So, uh… Are you leaving before me, or…” he said, glancing at the still locked door.
. He looked like a slimmer version of his father, having inherited his mother’s thin body but with a constant sharpness to him. He knew he was considered handsome, but he was just that smidge too beautiful. And men weren’t supposed to be
The very thought disgusted Draco. It felt unnatural and, in all honesty, undignified. Children, in general, were rather undignified due to the nature of them alone.
Draco drank the last of his pint before putting two tenners on the counter and then leaving without another word to Potter or the dyke bartender. He should have left Potter to pay up, but he just didn’t care anymore. Just wanted to get away from it all.
Anger stirred in Draco. How dare he? How dare he just jump back into Draco’s life like this, as if all is well and the past is forgotten and forgiven. It’s not. It’s not bloody forgiven.
Perhaps, Draco mused as he listened with half an ear to what was being said as he glanced at Ginny and her solicitor, Potter had known her as she had been before she realised she’d spent years upon years in what turned out to be an illusion of a marriage. Perhaps her solicitor had put ideas in her head. But why even try to find some explanation for why Ginny acted as she did?
Looking at him now, Harry saw the softness, and he liked it. Liked it so very much. And he resented the expression on Draco’s face as he was obviously trying to find a way to word his answer to Harry’s question in a way that would keep Harry at a distance.
Blaise laughed and Marcus and Anthony followed. Their eyes met and they searched for Draco’s. He didn't hear the joke, but it din’t matter, did it? He felt nothing, but laughed anyway. It only gave him a disgusting feeling, like he needed a shower, if only to shed the emptiness inside him. The lack of actual
After a few polite words about nothing in general and a cup of tea, they went down to business. Draco had sent over scrolls of plans, filled with calculations Harry had a hard time to decipher, but Gemma did her best to explain what they meant and Harry trusted her. He had to, considering the amount of money he was paying her for her work.
Potter didn’t seem to care and just shrugged as he sat down beside Draco, his pint being placed in front of him. The bartender smiled and went to pour Draco’s second pint.
“The house in Godric’s Hollow goes to Ginny,” Draco said, taking notes from Gemma’s walkthrough of the proposal for the hearing. “And it was valued at around half a million galleons in muggle currency, estimated at around £2,5 000 000, which should be counted into the symbolic sum she receives, turning it into half a million galleons, along with the house.”
It was easy to see the differences in this persona and the relaxed, at-home-Draco. Here was the professional, blank and cold Draco. The person people saw but never got to know. Harry knew it was far from the real Draco and he loathed the coldness he spread around him. It was a simulated personality Draco had created to protect himself, and Harry knew well he carried some part in this persona’s creation.
Draco coughed and looked away. “Whatever it is, you’ve just gotten divorced. And I’m still married.”
“Fuck my life.” Draco breathed as he grabbed the washbasin hard, before crashing his head into the mirror.
The healers had managed to heal him completely, leaving no trace of his ‘incident’. He’d almost hoped for a black eye, swollen cheek or bloodied forehead - but no. Nothing. Just his usual slightly gaunt self with dark bags under his eyes and to sharp features, too many teeth behind his thin lips and collarbones that stood out as if his skeleton wished to escape his flesh.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco answered, but his voice was far from as angry as it’d been in his head. Instead, he sounded almost forgiving. He lifted a now shaking finger for the barmaid, ignoring his awful weakness for another, saying, “Give me something strong, for fuck’s sake.”
What was left was the upstairs bathroom and the remaining guest rooms and he figured a few beers along with some good music and paint would keep him from going completely mental whilst licking his wounds.
“No bloody dead rats or poison, you nasty little creature.” Draco’s voice was condescending and Harry grimaced as he looked down at Kreacher. To his surprise, Kreacher seemed to straighten slightly at Draco’s voice and his eyes glimmered.
As he'd sat in Gemma’s office yesterday, sober and clear-headed, and Potter walked in, looking hesitant and tense, all Draco could see was the misery in his eyes and he recognised it too well. He felt
Draco holds a hand up, stopping Potter, his curiosity already having taken over, “You’re already here, so why don’t you tell me and we can have this done with sooner rather than later.”
“Yes, Lily.” Potter nodded slowly, watching Draco with those damned eyes of his. “She was… Somewhat of a surprise. But, I’ve always wanted a daughter.”
“What are you doing in a gay bar, anyway?” he asked, his voice remaining low, acidic in its sharpness. “As I remember it, you’re ‘straight’.”
“You’ve ruined regular pasta for me, I swear.” Potter said, his mouth still filled and Draco scoffed.
“I, uh,” Potter began, pulling his hand through his messy hair. It looked good and Draco was absolutely certain Potter was well aware of it too. “I just wanted to thank you, for this… I know it’s awkward, considering - well, you know.”
“You’ll pay for that later.” Potter says as he licks his lips. Draco can’t help the slight grin that plays over his own lips for a short second.
, and yet - as Gemma explained to Potter about Ginerva’s solicitor and the statement Gemma had received that very morning, Draco couldn’t deny it. He felt bad. And to his absolute horror, he found he wanted to reach out and grasp Potter’s hand in some disgustingly comforting gesture.
. “Are you telling me you honestly believe I need to fucking try it before I’ll even know? What the fuck’s wrong with you, Draco?”
“Occasionally. But I prefer to live here.” Draco said, “And these days, I believe Astoria prefers it this way too. Gives her more freedom.”
After a few minutes, he shouted for his assistant. When she popped her head in, he shouted over his music, “Bring me tea!”
Harry stood in the doorway, watching as Draco looked at the books in the shelves, dragging him fingers over the worn spines. His tall, lithe body like a sharp play of contrasts with his black trousers, waist coast and white shirt. With his platinum hair, it made him look just as other-worldly as he always had. So strangely attractive as strands of his pushed back hair fell over his cheekbones. Harry could just stand there and look at him forever.
. Harry let him hesitate, let him hold him there, strangling him slowly with his thin but surprisingly strong finers. If Draco wished to cut off his air, he could easily do so. Harry relaxed in his grip and just looked into Draco’s grey eyes.
Potter thanked him and left, leaving Draco feeling confused and even more angry but not so much with Astoria anymore, but with himself and the sodding
“Please…” at this point, he was just begging. Draco could throw him to the wind and he wouldn’t care. He’d take what Draco would give him. What did he have to lose, anyway?
To Draco’s absolute annoyance, his father went and sat in Draco’s chair behind his desk. He might as well have just flipped him off and shagged his wife while he was at it. Or taken a shit on his chest.
Harry nodded. He supposed he understood. The shame and the collective guilt those who’d been on the opposite side of the war carried was difficult for Harry to understand, but he knew it was there. It was an entire culture of its own that had to be changed, reformed and at the same time remembered, so that it wouldn’t happen again. And before him sat one of the men who had been closest to the Dark Lord. He’d been a boy then, a boy who had tortured and maimed on command. Now, he was a man who, Harry was still fully aware of, could murder without issue.
Kreacher had prepared cod with butter and parsley sauce, served with baby potatoes with a side of peas. Harry was silently impressed and thanked the elf before he disappeared and left Harry and Draco alone again.
Draco had always been a little too pretty, too elegant for the other rough boys at school. Even though he was an athlete and a seeker just as Harry, Malfoy had retained the litheness of youth and instead only grown more into his pointed and sharp features. If Harry was completely honest, Draco - because he wasn’t Malfoy to Harry anymore and hadn’t been for years - was drop dead bloody gorgeous.
Potter gave a wry smile as he looked away from the painting and remained quiet as they sat listening to Jim Morrison’s voice and the surface noise crackle on the old record.
Instead, his mother sat in a chair to his side inside a brightly white room and Draco realised he was in St Mungo’s.
Draco was what he was. It was an incurable infliction and besides, he had done his duty to his family. He’d married a pure-blooded witch and gotten the heir. A spare had been ideal, he supposes, but perhaps it wasn’t to be. Draco didn’t want to think about the fact that he was expected back at the manor tomorrow for his weekly visit and shag. A weekly shag which in and of itself really was more close to rape. Him raping Astoria - and himself, by extension.
“Still want me to…?” Draco asked, hesitating slightly. Last time this was brought up in conversation between them, Harry had told Draco he’d never done this before. And Draco might not be the most empathic character Harry could have found to have his ‘first time’ with, being fucked up the arse, but he didn’t want to hurt him.
They all shook hands and Gemma’s secretary arrived with tea and biscuits. Draco had spent the end of last week going through Potter’s finances, everything from the inheritance from his parents, to the money Sirius had left him from the Blacks. It was honestly an absurd amount of money, not that Draco wasn’t used to absurd amounts of money, considering his own family vaults, but it still pained him a little for his mother’s sake. She’d gotten her Black inheritance when she married and the Malfoys were nowhere near short of cash. However, she along with his aunt Andromeda, who was worse off than his mother, were the last Blacks.
And she was right. Harry knew that then, and he knows it now. Ginny was almost always right - and now, when he’d had some weeks to think and understand that their marriage had been over a long time ago, he didn’t even feel angry. He just missed her, her warmth and how steady she’d always been. The way her hair smelled in the morning, or the way she laughed at the dinner table. And the family - all the Weasley’s. Harry had always wanted a large family, people with whom he belonged. Ron was still his best mate and they met once a week just the two of them. He’d married Hermione a couple of years ago and they had two kids now. They seemed to be happy and Harry was glad for them, even though it seemed to be far from a perfect marriage. But Harry had always supported them and still hoped they’d make it.
Draco frowned, holding his glass of wine between his fingers. Harry could tell he was conflicted. Draco wasn’t one to open up about things. He kept most things to himself and it wasn’t difficult for Harry to understand that over the years, that part of Draco had only grown stronger. If it was due to being scared of letting people become too close, a sort of defense mechanism due to the obvious trauma Draco - along with so many others - had been through during the war, Harry didn’t rightly know. He’d never asked. All of it, what he knew of Draco, was in a sense, simply estimated guesses from a different time, when they had both been different persons.
“Yeah,” Potter hummed. “She’s my best mate’s little sister. I love her and I want the best for her. But I haven’t… wanted her, for
And third, why even worry about the children not getting what they were due? It was easily regulated in both muggle and wizarding law, especially if there was no bastard children involved.
One, get piss drunk and firecalling Ginny, crying his heart out before he passed out in his bed, soaking himself in tears and his crushed pride, along with an honest to god bloody broken heart.
After his father left, Draco sank down in his chair, still warm from his father. He lit another cigarette and leaned back, drawing the smoke deep into his lungs as he stared up into the ceiling.
exactly? It’s the truth of things, isn’t it?” Draco snorted, “Leave me alone, mother. And don’t even think about getting Astor-“
“What?” Potter seemed to relax, holding up a finger for one more from the dyke at the bar, who nodded with a smile to Potter. “This is my neighbourhood gay pub.” Potter said as he sat down next to Draco, throwing the older man a cursory glare.
“Barbarian?” Potter laughed, “Never been called that before.” He shrugged. “I suppose the barbarians did do quite a bit of party crashing, so… Yeah, I see your point.”
Arriving back at Gringotts, he met up with Anthony before they took the lift down to the underbelly of the bank where the Goblin’s higher up’s could be found. Blaise and Marcus were already there, having made sure one of their assistants brought tea with them. The goblins didn’t care for tea and sat sneering in their higher chairs, grumbling about something Draco didn’t pick up on. It frustrated him, but he decided to just drop it as he sat down beside Marcus and a woman he’d forgotten the name of, but knew worked on the second floor.
“First floor.” Harry said, gesturing for Draco to follow. “Kreacher’ll have it done in twenty minutes or so. Getting old, and that.”
Deciding it was time to push Potter into admitting what the fuck he was up to, Draco looked up from his beer and glanced at Potter.
He uncorked the bottle and carefully measured two tablespoons of the potion, mixing it with water and then downed it in one go. It didn’t taste bad, but Draco was disgusted by the chemical flavour that stuck to the back of his tongue. He tried to wash it down with water and then decided to brush his teeth in the meantime, while the potion worked.
It was all so despicably shallow. His so-called friends. His wife’s smile as he kissed her cheek after having forgone staying at his London flat to come home and spend some time with his family, if only to avoid his father’s stern words and glares. Or having the misfortune of his father flooing into his office.
Lily’s conception had been, in many ways, nothing short of a miracle. Him and Ginny had the house for themselves over a weekend when Molly and Arthur had taken the boys and a couple of bottles of wine had done the rest. It was the first time in over a year that they had proper sex.
. To be as normal as possible in the eyes of society but still retaining that touch of inaccessibility that belongs to the upper class. This means getting married, doing your duty, produce at least one (male) heir and make sure you find yourself in an influential position with a job that makes people look up to you. And; to do it well - or else. Draco would like to see his father come at him with his cane now.
Standing in front of the same mirror he’d crashed his head into - now completely repaired by Liffy, Draco stared at himself. A cigarette hung from between his lips as he traced his forehead with careful fingers.
Draco steps outside into the misty London air, locks the door and puts his headphones on. He shuffles through his iPod, letting it chose the track for him this time.
Draco seemed to notice where Harry’s eyes rested and he looked down on his left hand, frowning. He looked back up at Harry with a raised eyebrow.
Potter’s hands were in Draco’s hair immediately and a low whine escaped him as Draco deepened the kiss, marveling over the softness of Potter’s lips against his own, his body against Draco’s - how it just felt so strangely right. As if every touch, every kiss seemed to heal one small, infested wound inside him after another - and he still felt divided about it. About how good it actually felt. How disturbingly
His stomach hurt as he tied the scroll around his owl’s leg and as he stood watching her fly away, he almost wanted to call her back. He didn’t. He needed to be the better man this time and actually apologise. He’d left whatever it was they’d shared in fucking ruins the last time; an apology was the least he could do this time around.
His mother said nothing, simply walked out. She sent him an owl later in the evening, assuring Draco he would always be her son, that she would always love him, no matter what.
“Go fuck yourself, Potter.” Draco swiped his napkin over his lips before he grabbed his glass of wine and took an aggressive sip.
Potter gave a satisfied sigh as he dug in, giving Draco a small wink that almost made Draco blush where he sat, twirling the long spaghetti on his fork.
Draco had sat in his dark office for hours, staring at the piece of parchment - the words almost indecipherable from Potter’s atrocious handwriting alone - but Draco could read it. Could understand the words. And he hated them. Hated Potter for being the bigger man. Hated him for having the gall.
Draco sat to the left of his father and to the left of Draco sat his wife. His son has been taken to bed earlier, having thrown a fit which his mother claimed gave her a headache, so Astoria took him away. Draco wished Scorpius could be away at all times. He didn’t want children. Didn’t want a wife, actually. And still, there she sat to his left, trying to imitate his mother’s posture but still failing. Her cheekbones were cuttingly sharp and objectively, she was gorgeous, but she did nothing to stir Draco’s affections, sexual or emotional. He wished he could put his headphones on and disappear to ‘Hotel California’ with a firewhisky in his hand instead of sitting here in the silence pretending.
Harry’s kids, visit. The boys staying with them two weekends every month. Draco doesn’t like it. Still doesn’t like kids, if he’s absolutely honest. But he puts up with it, or just makes himself scarce whenever it’s time for the invasion. Thankfully, Harry’s genes are strong, so it’s only the little girl that looks even remotely like a Weasley. Draco doesn’t like her any less for it though. He abhors Harry’s kids equally.
Changing into a loose pair of joggers he wouldn’t be seen dead in outside his flat and a Deep Purple band shirt, Draco opened his fridge and looked inside.
What headlines they could produce if they only knew. What debauchery they could wallow in. Oh, the stories Draco could tell about dark magic and fucked up orgies of torture happening in the Malfoy dungeons during the war. The Ministry and the Wizengamot thought they had uncovered it all, and the Prophet had written pages upon pages about all that went on behind closed doors in the Dark Lord’s headquarters. They knew nothing, the bastards. They all assumed, thought they knew and therefore had the right to judge freely.
Shut it, brain. Perhaps he could kidnap one of the secretaries. Lock her into the manor’s dungeon and keep her there as a pet to take his anger out on whenever he felt like exploding. If his father believed he kept a woman to rape and torture, at least he wouldn’t be a fucking queer, right?
Draco drank the last of his white wine and waved for the check. “Ta ever so, darling. I’m sure we can work something out soon again, but I’m afraid the goblins are scarier than you are, so I best be off. This was lovely.”
Why would he, anyway? They weren’t eighteen anymore and Draco had about as much to lose - if not more - if it came out what they’d done.
“That’s fucked up, mate.” Potter said. “Why does she accept it? Is it an open marriage, or something?”
Painfully slow to begin with. Even though Draco hadn’t done this with someone else in a while, he knew just how painful it could be if not done right, and he wanted this to be right. Wanted Harry to enjoy it as much a he did.
people would deem ‘healthy’,” Draco paused to take a sip of his wine. “And… I am reluctant, Potter. About this. This… Whatever it is that we’re doing. How could I not be?”
His hair was beginning to grow too long. He should have it cut, the thought, but he wasn’t sure he really wanted to. He liked when it fell over his forehead when he bent over.
After a blow job that honestly was beyond what Harry had ever expected, with the psychedelic sounds from the record Draco kept on in the background, they stumbled into Draco’s bedroom. Harry hadn’t even had time enough to offer to return the favour to Draco as he was pushed back against the large bed dressed in muted dark grey linens.
“I wasn’t taught anything about sexuality when I was a kid, aside from the ‘normal’ kind, you know,” Potter said, thumbing the coaster, “And when I came to Hogwarts, it was all heterosexuality or nothing. Mainly nothing. Keep your hands inside your trousers until you’re seventeen and you can marry your sweetheart.” He sighs. “And I dated Cho, then Ginny. Then the war came - and after, there was you. I was confused. I don’t know what to say, if I’m completely honest.”
He could string her up by her intestines this very moment, a grin still on his face, and she wouldn’t have a single chance to defend herself.
Draco frowned as he threw the man a look again, noticing he was now staring, as if working hon saying something. The look in his eye made Draco uncomfortable.
Draco spent the hours before his meeting with Gemma recovering from his father’s surprise visit and when she finally showed up, Draco felt himself again and could fully concentrate on what turned out to be a somewhat bizarre divorce.
Still, punching people left and right wouldn’t help him in his strife for normalcy. But, considering the upbringing he’d had, could you blame him for acting out physically? He didn’t. He was too forcibly well behaved, upper class - stiff upper lip, poppy cock and all that.
The second week came and went. It was Friday and Harry had stayed out of Draco’s way for two weeks. Not a word had been sent. He’d gone nowhere near he could suspect Draco could be. He’d even sent someone else to Gringotts to make a withdrawal for him.
Draco accioed his etui of cigarettes and brought one to his lips, staring at the white walls surrounding him in the silence of his dark living room. Smoke billowed around his head as he watched the fag’s end glow in a soft orange.
“Guess I have to, right?” Harry said. Draco looked up into the ceiling for a moment, sighing, before coming back and rolling his head on his shoulders, a grin still on his lips.
Gemma smiled and reached forward to clasp his hand, whilst Draco held back slightly, his sharp face blank as he silently watched Harry. When Gemma released his hand, Harry turned to Draco, not sure on how to proceed, considering. His hand was shaking and sweaty. Gemma hadn’t mentioned it. Maybe she thought him nervous about tomorrow.
Astoria lives with his parents at the manor. It’s her choice and she’s free to use their money to buy herself a flat whenever or wherever she wishes, but strangely enough, she likes it in Wiltshire. Draco doesn’t fully understand her, though he did have a somewhat happy childhood there, before the Dark Lord came back.
He would back off, give Draco time - and if he hadn’t heard anything from him in two weeks’ time, he’d owl him an apology and let this be. He’d blown it and perhaps he wasn’t deserving of forgiveness - but then there was little else he could do.
It was what people brought to dates, right? Harry wasn’t sure. He wasn’t even sure it was a bloody date to begin with, but - he decided not to even mention it. It wasn’t as if Draco didn’t have any humour. He did. It was just… Very dry and not even close to as infantile as Harry’s humour could be. Harry and Ron liked to joke about bollocks, after all.
Draco drew a breath between his teeth, trying not to look to pained, thinking about their bloody sons going to school together.
Now, he’d settled in fine at the old headquarters. Harry had spent much time doing repairs there during the years, in many ways to get a pause from family life, and now it seemed almost ironic that all through his marriage, he had used the renovation of his future home as an escape. A home where he would start anew, without his family. Without Ginny.
“I can remove it, if it bothers you.” Draco frowned, putting his cutlery down. “I think you know there’s no love lost between me and my wife.”
And then Potter had fucking crushed him all over again. And Draco had to stand there, in front of the entire Wizengamot and Ministry, gratefully just taking it like a whore as Potter basically saved his whole family because he was afraid of what? That Draco might open his mouth about what they had done?
Mind, Harry was very well aware he was the arsehole in this, and he hated it. He loathed being the arsehole, the one who’s fault everything is. Before, everything had been Voldemort’s fault, or Lucius Malfoy’s fault, then it had been Draco’s fault for a bit. But never Harry’s - exactly. He was a coward, a bloody spineless coward and he’d freely admit it if it only helped, which it obviously didn’t.
Liffy came with a plate of late dinner sometime before midnight and Draco pulled himself from his misery, pushed the food on the plate around without really eating it and then took a took warm shower.
“Self-satisfied arse.” Draco muttered, hating Potter intensely even though his erection was still making him uncomfortable.
He’d done quite a bit with this room. Replacing the dark and worn wallpaper with a crème-coloured wallpaper, as well as redressing the old furniture in brighter colours, making the room in its whole more welcoming but keeping the cosy feeling. He’d also removed quite few carved snakes. Not that he disliked snakes, but you didn’t need them in every room, did you?
It was one of Ginny’s favourite films and Harry had watched it with her several times. It had some great music in it, and for a moment, Harry couldn’t help but to wonder if Draco had seen it. He seemed to like muggle music, after all.
In comparison, Ginny was safe. He’d known Ginny since they were kids, she was Ron’s little sister, for Christ’s sake! And Harry loved Ginny. She didn’t make him shiver like Draco had done and her kisses didn’t burn through him with an intensity so hot he didn’t know what to do with himself, but he’d thought she’d be enough. Thought they could make it work.
Draco sat the book down with a frown, annoyed at once for the disruption. He decided to ignore the doorbell and picked up his book again, but then it rang again. With a sigh, Draco got up. If it was his incessant and too wealthy neighbour, he would actually break into her flat in the middle of the night and knife her as she slept, the old hag.
She laughed, shaking her head. “Bloody Irish Catholic, we Farleys. You don’t adhere to any faith, Draco?”
When their lips met and moved, hands searching and finding warmth underneath clothing, Harry could feel his magic reaching out, meeting Draco’s. By the sharp intake of breath he could hear from Draco, Harry was certain he’d felt it too. Harry could feel his fingers crackle when he reached under Draco’s shirt and traced his sides while their tongues touched as their kisses deepened.
in one of their stately gardens - which was in reality just another word for a bunch of rich sluts nagging on about other rich sluts, their husbands’ whores or how chronically unfaithful they were.
Now, he simply can’t unsee the number of horrors committed in that god awfully large house. He’s happier when he stays away, though he still visits once a week, for Scorpius. He visits alone and Scorpius doesn’t come to 12 Grimmauld Place, where Draco has lived more or less full time with Harry for the past six months.
Having finally managed to uncork his bottle of Merlot, Draco rummaged around for a red wine glass, eventually finding it in a cupboard above the sink, containing about fifteen different kind of glasses for any type of beverage.
Pulling his hands through his hair, Potter took a deep breath again, not meeting Draco’s eyes as he spoke.
He rose from his chair and held his hand out to Potter, who seemed to catch on as soon as he shook himself out of his empty musings.
“Right,” Draco said as he entered the former drawing room. “I like it. Turning it into a combined living room and dining room. Suits it, actually.”
It was from his mother, asking him to come home for dinner on Saturday, unless he had other - more important - plans. Draco didn’t, really. But he also didn’t want to go to the manor. But he supposed a Saturday night dinner wasn’t too much to ask for. If it allowed him to enjoy his Friday night in peace and made sure he was left in peace for a majority of the upcoming week, he’d sacrifice an evening on being the good son.
Draco bit into the filter of his fag and inhaled a hefty amount of smoke, letting it ripple from between his lips and nostrils on the exhale.
I've been through countless records and glasses of wine whilst writing and Draco as fought me the entire way, but alas, just like Potter, I only wished for Draco to be happy.
“I’d rather fuck you, honestly.” Potter drank from his own glass, his eyes never leaving Draco’s increasingly flustered face. “I’ve dreamt about it for years, really. If you’d only let me the first ti-“
His hands, like much else of Potter, was very different from Draco. Where Draco was tall and lithe, bordering on skinny, Potter was broader, athletic, only a couple inches shorter. His hair was dark, his skin tanned and his eyes remarkable, where instead Draco was light, light, light - ever so pale with platinum wisps of hair and pale grey eyes. Always each other’s contrasts. Potter was a typical ‘lad’, even though he’d grown into a man with muscles and a bloody jawline. Draco was just a bit too dainty, too fair and
“No!” Potter’s outburst left Draco stunned for a moment, furrowing his brows as he set the quill down. Potter’s cheeks grew faintly pink as he shook his head. “I-I mean, I don’t mind that it’s you. Or, I mean, I don’t care. I just want it finished and my solicitor told me you’re the best.”
Draco’s closest friends know about his relationship with Potter - and Potter’s friends know as well. The reactions have been mixed, but overwhelmingly positive - or at least neutral. No one has refused to stay in contact with him, which surprises Draco. He doesn’t know what to make of it, if he’s being honest. Harry says to let it be, to not think too hard about it. Problem is, Draco enjoys thinking too hard about most things. It’s one of life’s simple joys.
But a beautiful snob. Harry absolutely adored seeing Draco like this. In a simple pair of black wool trousers with a slightly snug fit, along with a deeply blue jumper with the arms drawn up, leaving his forearms bare. Harry didn’t even mind the dark mark still sharply visible. He never had minded it, but he knew Draco was worried about it, so he never let his eyes fall on it when Draco could notice.
“No thank you. I came here to talk. I wouldn’t accidentally want your mother to read my post, considering the upsetting information contained within. I’m afraid her frail nerves wouldn’t be able to handle such things.”
He felt like something calm but theatrical, something easy - so he pulled out the Human Menagerie by Steve Harley and the Cockney Rebel. Lifting the needle carefully, he moved it to the last song on the A-side and turned up the volume, before walking over to the liquor cabinet and pouring himself a large firewhisky.
How much time would he be sentenced to in Azkaban if he decided to murder Harry Potter? Would it be worth it?
Draco had realised quite early he was not supposed to like boys the way he did. At least if he considered his father’s reaction upon having that damned little house elf reporting his and Theo kissing to his father. Theo was and still is straight as a rod, of course, but they were just kids. You’re supposed to try things out, to define what you like and don’t like. ‘Boys will be boys’ and all that wank.
“I’m so sorry, but… I can’t.” She said in a smaller voice than usual, “It’s an auror. A.. Auror Potter, in fact.”
His father drew a deep breath, his eyes boring into Draco’s. “Rumours have reached me through an acquaintance, Draco.”
Draco felt annoyed by the question. It was a sore point, Scorpius. It wasn’t like Draco didn’t love his son. He did. He just didn’t like him very much. His son was much like Pansy in that way. Smaller doses worked, with long pauses in between. Astoria had accused him of acting like a cold, egotistical arse for not being more present in his son’s life, and Draco honestly couldn’t blame her. He hadn’t wanted Scorpius, but now that he was here, well, not much to do about it, was there?
It also fucking unnerved him being home at the manor. His father acted like he was even more of a disappointment, as if he could see through Draco’s ‘accident’ without even asking - his grey eyes almost urging him on.
Potter seemed to understand, even though he looked pained for it. Yet again, Potter - as far as Draco knew - had married Ginny because he loved her. They’d had their kids because they wanted to, even though Potter had claimed yesterday that there was some sort of moral obligation to it. But Draco didn’t think it was comparable to his own situation.
Draco rose from his chair and walked around the table, his hand reaching forward and stroking Harry’s hair. Before Harry could even say something more, Draco’s lips brushed against his and Harry was again completely wrapped around Draco’s fingers.
Inside his office, Draco was met by the last person he wished to see this morning and as he pulled his headphones off a little more aggressively than necessary, he noticed his assistant standing in the door, whimpering.
He’d almost done just that when Astoria told him she was pregnant. It took him a week to recover his nausea and it wasn’t until he realised her pregnancy would mean he wouldn’t have to touch her sexually for almost a year that he could see the positives of that situation. It held for a few weeks, because, unfortunately, pregnant women still want sex. Draco hadn’t realised and it only left him feeling cheated and miserable.
and want pulled at him. When he’d regained some semblance of control over himself, he was pushing Potter up against the wall inside the hallway, his hand around Potter’s neck and hips lips hovering just over Potter’s. And Draco found that he had lost. He didn’t
Yes, it must have been after the Dark Lord died the first time. When his father again nestled himself into the Ministry and manipulated anyone who could be even slightly useful to him. Perhaps the constant manipulation of his own child could have been included into those happy memories? How his father created a miniature of himself to use when he needed to.
Draco wanted to ask about the divorce, if only out of curiosity and the fantastical gossip he’d get out of it, however, he finds it’s not because he’d like to share the gossip with his ‘friends’ - and the thought of why he’s curious made him shiver in disgust.
