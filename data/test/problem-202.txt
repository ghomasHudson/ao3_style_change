But Harry couldn’t help but feel an ache in his chest grow a little bit more.
As they walked, it seemed like the room got bigger. More desks filled with people showed up, and Harry began to wonder when the area really started, and where it really ended.
Lavender shook her head. “Nope, and I don’t really need to know either. Kingsley made it seem important, but confidential. I understand. Took them long enough to give you a break though.”
Pride swelled in his chest. He could recall the Neville from 1st year, high in doubt, low in self esteem, now he’s head of Gryffindor. “Neville, that’s great! I’m so happy for you.”
“Hello, Isolt.” He said as he walked over to pet her.
Healer Tina looked to the trio beside Harry. She put on a smile, and gently asked them to leave the room. After a moment’s hesitation, they left. None of this eased Harry’s dread.
Harry moved his head slightly, and saw unknown Malfoy again. This new Draco Malfoy, boyfriend to unknown Harry, friends to unknown people. Harry watched as Malfoy moved above him, carefully checking him.
Harry would’ve elbowed him for that, but he was too in shock. The image of the unknown Harry was fading away to something more real, more tangible. It looked more like him now.
Malfoy slowly sat up, blinking him slowly awake in a way Harry had only seen once before when he woke up from St Mungo’s. “I was waiting for you,” Malfoy yawned. “Wanted to make sure you were okay when you got back.”
“I didn’t realise I was so afraid to see this house.” He whispered softly to himself.
Throughout their visit, Harry wondered if Malfoy was going to come in at some point, but as time went on, he never reappeared. Harry wondered aloud why Malfoy was in the room, a few hours later. He noted the grim faces on Ron and Hermione’s faces as they tried to change the subject.
So he spent a while looking at the shelves. Thoughts and ideas of how to rearrange them came and went. There was a certain order that he couldn’t make out, but he felt like he knew it deep down. He trusted his body and its memory. Understood when a book looked right, and took it back when it didn’t.
“But it’s potions, huh?”
“Definitely. Only if you’re still up for it, though. Today might’ve already been a lot for you,” Neville said, looking at Harry carefully.
“Hagrid!” Harry called with excitement.
Truthfully, Harry had a feeling it was about that. Deep down somewhere in his heart he knew the answer, even if his mind had no idea. Maybe that’s why it didn’t feel like a revelation.
A person zoomed by in his peripherals, and with a pounding heart, he realised it was Teddy. Blue haired tiny kid with a snitch plushie in his hand. Andromeda was there too, and she smiled softly at Harry and waved. Harry kinda maybe wanted to cry.
A few minutes into the diagnostics, Ron and Hermione came rushing in. Concern and worry on their faces. For the first time since he woke, Harry realised they all looked slightly different. Older. More mature. It was probably nothing, but Harry felt that discomfort in the bottom of his stomach.
The girl looked to her notes and sighed. “I’m terrible at it too,” She huffed.
He felt himself sway as he stepped away from the door. He wants to run, or cry, or both. The gift from the heavens she is, Hermione appeared beside him on his way to the kitchen. She held his hand as she led the way.
After the two days, he went back to the Ministry. He tried to keep an optimistic mindset, thinking that maybe the job won’t be as terrible as he was making it out to be.
A wave of doubt and hesitance washed over him. He knew it would be difficult to change his mindset so suddenly, but he didn’t expect to fight himself this hard.
“Remember the promise?”
“Oh, Harry.” She said, moving to hug him tightly.
Goyle apparated them to Nott’s apartment as it was obvious the alcohol was making itself more present in Nott’s system. He started singing a Celestina Warbeck song Harry didn’t know, but came to the conclusion he never wanted to listen to it ever.
“Bullshit. You really thought you could, that’s why you kept it up for so long. Tell me, who else have you done this too?”
“Yeah, it would be,” Harry said as he started to card his fingers through Teddy’s hair. “But it doesn’t have to be. We can be our own person.”
He looked back at the photos. It was him, but at the same time, it wasn’t. There was still so much to rediscover about himself and who he hung out with.
He grabbed a handful of powder and stepped in. “The Burrow!” Malfoy watched as Harry was engulfed by the green flames.
Ron stifled a laugh. “Yeah, the pap absolutely ran you through when you went to Draco’s shop, didn’t they?”
His fist held high, about to knock on the door when he heard a familiar voice.
He could feel the back of his eyes start to ache again. He thought he had no more tears left, but here they were, ready for round two.
He was a few stores down from Malfoy’s apothecary. Somehow, he’d been able to travel here without hurting himself or anyone else since his outburst. He counted himself lucky.
“Harry?” Malfoy called from the kitchen next room over.
“Hey, Harry. How’d lunch go?” Malfoy asked, showing up beside him.
He watched her as she left. Once out of sight, he looked back down at the field, watching Hagrid throw chunks of meat to the thestrals. Harry ran down, old trainers, dirty jeans and all, to meet him.
Harry turned as Malfoy finished placing lunch on the table. The food looked absolutely delicious. His stomach rumbled once again, startling Isolt.
“I need your help!”
Hagrid looked at him with a sadness in his eyes. “I know I shouldn’t tell ye’ this, but it don’ matter. Yer still ‘ere, alive an’ all. It don’t matter tha’ ye chose a diff’rent hippogriff or-”
“Draco…” He cleared his throat. And again. Three times for good measure. “Draco Malfoy.”
“Oh, but he didn’t have time to parade about during that beach party!” Nott commented.
Harry just kept on writing. It might have been nonsense, or a beautifully written poem. He didn’t get to find out either way because his inkwell exploded.
He walked up to the teachers table, where Neville had left a seat beside him. All the professors were talking amongst each other, Flitwick, Minerva, and Slughorn seemed to be in a heated conversation, Neville, Hagrid, and Grubbly-Plank were joking around, even the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, an ex-auror who lost her leg during the battle of Hogwarts and who looked like she could kick your arse while preparing the best tea, was laughing with Trelawney.
“You go first,” Malfoy managed to say just before Harry could.
Suddenly, Malfoy was at his side, checking him. Either Harry was losing his sense of perception or the pain was becoming too distracting to notice. Yet there Malfoy was, casting simple diagnostic spells on Harry even though they had just fought.
Everyone began laughing again. Even Harry laughed too, maybe his memory being gone wasn’t
Harry didn’t know, but he knew the other Harry did.
Malfoy just grumbled and groaned sleepily. “No thank you.”
“Harry,” McGonagall’s arms were wide open. “It’s so good to see you.”
Kingsley leaned forward and rested his chin on his hands. “That’s really good. Tell me about it.”
“It’s amazing,” Harry said, putting praise in his voice. “This is the vision you tried to drill into us during 8th year.”
His hope must’ve been all over his face because Malfoy smiled. He
“What? Where are you going?”
Harry’s hands were gesturing wildly, trying to convey his message through weird actions and stumbling words. He could imagine Malfoy on the side, laughing at his silliness.
Just before sleep could take over, Harry’s eyes shot open. His hands covered his mouth, and his mind felt like there was an intense alarm wee-wooing in his head.
“Doesn’t mean my grades are.”
Harry shook his head. “No, not at all. It’s expected, considering you’re my boss.”
But when it came to the reception, that’s when it got hectic. Ginny would recall someone setting off fireworks early, only for Luna to say they actually went off late. It was getting a little confusing.
He couldn’t stop his jaw from dropping. His heart pounded a little harder, and his palms started getting sweaty.
She spoke of how drabby and old wizarding fashion was. How there was such a strong sense of how a wizard should dress, and that anything out of that image would cause strange looks. Pansy noted that she had enough strange looks in 8th year to last a lifetime.
Harry smiled throughout it all. Malfoy was a wonderful storyteller. He never stuttered or backtracked, it was a continuous flow. Harry marvelled at that, as he himself was never good at recounting things. Facts at the wrong time, bits and pieces being added hastily. It was a stop and start kind of thing, whereas Malfoy spoke as smoothly as the run of honey.
It’s been so long since it’s been too much, and Harry’s not ready for it at all.
There it was. That one word that was in every single reprimand from each person who knew of his plans. “
“What was the last thing you remember?”
Harry felt his blood run cold. “I- He-”
“Hey, Malfoy. Wake up, sleepy head.”
“When’s your birthday?”
A soft voice, careful, concerned. A gentle shake of his shoulder. Then light grey eyes looking into his as Harry felt himself slowly go back into his body.
It never seemed like the right time to go to Teddy, so he hung around the dinner table. He ate the treacle tart that was put out a few moments ago, savouring the taste. Then Luna popped up next to him.
“Minerva, where are we heading?” Harry asked as they passed the herbology greenhouse.
Harry shrugged and suppressed the bitter laugh that wanted to escape.
“Harry, don’ worry about it, okay?” Hagrid looked at the castle. “I gotta go and meet Grubbly-Plank abou’ the class today. I’ll see ye ‘round.”
“Oh.”
So she went to the muggle world, and found how different it was. How better. How accepting. Harry marvelled at this part, how her views had changed so quickly in the right direction with a little help.
Harry could hear the frown in Malfoy’s voice.
“I need a moment to think.” And he pressed the palms of his hands to his eyes.
He’s known Kingsley for a while, even without the five year void, but even so, it didn’t click fast enough. The Kingsley speaking to him right now wasn’t his boss, it was his friend.
“It’s lunch time. Just thought we should all go out since our free time synced up for longer than an hour.” Hermione said with a smile.
“Nev, I’m stuck, and this is the only way I can somehow move forward,” Harry whisper-shouted.
He didn’t even know what they were celebrating in that photo. He didn’t know anything. He couldn’t remember, and no matter how many times he watched it, nothing came. No flashes of a smile or a lingering taste on his tongue, no smell of fresh backyard air or tingling touches, and absolutely no recall of how their laughter sounded. No memories.
“Look, Harry…”
Malfoy sighed, but kept rearranging his papers in an order that Harry didn’t quite understand. “Why don’t you guess?”
Hugging Hagrid felt like hugging a mattress. Well, more like hugging several mattresses with a beard that ticked the top of your head. He smelt like dirt and raw meat and slobber but Harry didn’t care. Hagrid was still the same as he remembered.
“Harry Potter?” The healer's voice finally came through.
He wanted to see him this intant. To hug him and hold him and hear him tell him stories of just about anything and everything. Harry was up and walking to the floo before he stopped. Did Teddy know he’d forgotten the past 5 years with him? What if he didn’t like Harry anymore because he’d changed?
“For days, we’ve been talking to you, making sure our theory was right,” Pansy told him with a voice like a scalpel. “We waited, and watched, and listened.”
Wow. Talk about monotone.
As he went in and out of sleep, he heard talking. One time he recognised the voice of Kingsley and Lavender. He made note to thank Malfoy for that, since work was long gone from his mind, and sleep took over.
He glanced up and raised a questioning eyebrow. “I’m sorry, what?”
God, how many more differences could he find about him and the one that was lost from that auror raid?
“And you have amazingly organised and detailed notes, the answer is somewhere there, isn’t it?”
When he finally got out of the shock, he laughed softly and nodded. “Yeah, I was terrible at it. Any of my friends would agree.”
Harry brought Isolt to her cage, and she happily stepped off. As he did so, Harry heard the kettle being turned on.
“I’ll... get a treat for you,” Malfoy said to the owl cautiously as he swept into the kitchen.
“How long have you known?” He asked, throat constricting.
It wasn’t completely over, but it was a start. Harry felt his soul breathe just a little bit better.
The conversation continued on about a range of things. Ranging from the past, to the party. Harry took the subtle clues of how events went, and stored them in his memory in case he needed them in future pretendings. It was difficult though, because sometimes people simply weren’t there.
And nothing.
Harry moved to get the dishes and put them in the kitchen when he heard Malfoy. “Just leave them, I’m not done. I’ll finish after I show you your office.”
Kiana thanked Harry numerously, but genuinely. And he told her he’d see her one day as a great potioneer. They parted ways when they reached the castle, Harry walking to the Great Hall for dinner, and Kiana dropping by her house dormitory.
Goyle laughed. It was hearty and booming. “Yeah, he did. But I guess we were all too knackered to care, we let him in and celebrate with us.”
He watched as the Slytherin and Gryffindor students played with each other, making fun and jokes as they approached their hippogriffs, some even wanting to move towards the smaller baby ones.
“I can’t eat with you today, I’m late!” Harry called, grabbing an apple from the fruit bowl they started recently.
“You too. Though, it definitely felt longer for the two of you than it did for me, huh?”
He thought to himself.
“That’s the end of the tour. Any questions?” Lavender asked as she led him back to his desk.
“Why on earth would you do that?”
Feeling his eyes were still puffy and his hands still had a slight shake, he stayed in the room, not going downstairs just yet. He’d forgotten to ask Malfoy about the missing pictures in the house, but with how intensely he reacted to the one on his desk, he was thankful he did.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, feigning ignorance.
“Nothing at all?”
“I can cook something,” Harry offered.
“That eagle owl,” Malfoy said as he smiled painfully. “It reminded me of the owl from my childhood. I thought mother had news for me, that’s all.”
The silence grew, but it was bearable with his friends here. Soon, Ron asked, “How old do you feel?”
“Huh.”
The bubble of magic around him disappeared, but he kept staring at his friend and school rival in shock. He didn’t even hear the questions his healer asked as he just kept staring at the three in confusion.
“Hey, Harry. I’ve been doing great. Hogwarts has been great, oh and guess what,” Neville said with a bright smile.
“Well, considering your situation, I thought you might like to see a new addition to the school 3 years ago.”
Malfoy waltzed back into the kitchen, Isolt still perched on his shoulder. Harry himself went over to the table and sat down, waiting patiently.
“Sorry we couldn’t be there,” Goyle apologised.
Once Isolt gathers her balance, and the beats of her wings aren’t booming in his ears, Malfoy’s laughter rings through. Harry just stares at him.
“I just decided to teach you because I wanted to?” He scoffed.
Dinner was about the same as it always had been though. Malfoy still didn’t let Harry help with cooking, but they would go out and shop for ingredients together if they had extra energy to spare. Even if the conversation was shallow, they still made time to talk.
Harry laughed quietly to himself. “It’s like organised chaos,” He whispered.
He has completely fallen into the idea. A part of him knows it’s a bad one, so very bad with consequences, but it had worked with Lara. Who else could it work on? Harry started walking to the apparition point they had arrived at.
Harry’s mind was screaming to
“So when do I start?”
“Ah, I was just going to ask what’s for breakfast.” Harry looked over at what looked to be a pancake batter half mixed in the bowl. “Pancakes?”
The flowers that dotted the patches of grass around the trees were new. Weeds of different colours, existing in beauty where no one could tell them they couldn’t be. Harry sat in the shade of the tree, looking at the lake, watching its ripples, the castle in the distance.
He kept laughing as he went through the Daily Prophet articles, and smiled brightly when he read the Quibbler ones. Luna’s editing was fantastic, taking out the sensationalism out of the articles, and then adding comments on the creatures present. It was glorious to read.
The ding of the elevator didn’t register at all in his brain. Much too soon they had arrived at the cafeteria. It was definitely peak hour. Everyone and their grandparents must’ve been there with how packed it was.
Harry looked at Malfoy still outside the door. “Are you going to come in?” Harry asked.
“What would-” Malfoy cleared his throat as his voice cracked ever so slightly. “What would you like to know?”
“Tina! What are you doing here?” Harry asked as he walked in.
She nodded in reply as she looked over them with pride. “I do,” She said. “In fact, I’m head of the Investigatives.”
He braced himself for Andromeda to immediately catch on to what Harry was planning, but all she did was laugh.
“Let’s fix you up.”
No, they would make Harry truly regret it. They’d find a way, and Harry knew this threat was up with the very few threats that ever meant anything to him.
The following days were around the same. Terribly stagnant, no change except for the conversations held on the days. There was no change in the case, nor the visits to Malfoy, and his friends.
Neville and Harry left the castle and began walking towards Hogsmeade. They talked about whatever they could, from Quidditch to the Quibbler, potions to portkeys. It helped to ease the anxious feeling slowly creeping up behind him.
Hagrid did ask about how Harry was with his memory loss, apparently finding out from Ron and Hermione when they visited. Harry also learnt that the news that Hagrid was overjoyed about had to do with, of course, dragons.
Draco Malfoy was wearing a Molly Weasley made Christmas sweater.
Malfoy came back, a healer right on his heels. “I just contacted Ron and Hermione too, they’ll be here soon.”
“Hmm.” Teddy looked at him like he was analysing his every move. Then he looked at the cards. “Let’s keep playing, I’m going to win.”
He wanted to keep fighting, to leave and fight this battle another day. But he was stuck in the snake pit. The vipers slowly wrap around his body, strangling him slowly but surely.
. But nothing works. Hermione says it just needs time.
“No… Nothing came today.”
Too much.
“I’m sorry.” Ron’s voice was dripping with regret.
Malfoy nodded once and disappeared again.
But tonight was the grand celebration at the Burrow. No one has contacted him yet except for Ron and Hermione. Molly hasn’t sent an owl, nor has Neville. He wondered if everyone was gonna be there or if some had other plans.
“Yeah, but… It’s
Harry looked down at the floor and shook his head. To be honest, he didn’t know how to feel. One on hand, reading bits and pieces, and watching seconds of sepia tones replay over and over again was actually a grand experience after he got over the sadness of forgetting it all.
Harry couldn’t help scoffing. “No, we didn’t actually. He just left and went to his office.”
Somehow, that made Harry feel a little better. Isolt stood proud on Malfoy’s shoulder, unaware of his shirt stain dilemma.
Harry looked around. The restaurant was quieter now, but it kept that environment that he loved dearly. Tables were emptying, customers were leaving, and the bells slowly stopped ringing. But the love that was overflowing in this place was incredible.
He bought whatever he could, wanting to buy some for Pansy and Blaise too while they talked in the backroom. He decided to cringe over the price later. After all, he needed this right now. It was well deserved, if he says so himself.
It wasn’t just a group of students coming together, it was the entire school.
It was breathtaking.
“I thought if I could just…” Harry struggled to form the word. Afraid that the moment he says it, everything would fall apart. “Pretend.”
Harry dodged, just barely. The quick movement brought a sharp pain just above his stomach. He was still healing, and this duel was a stupid idea. Yet, he continued on.
This Draco Malfoy in front of him, living with him, smiling and laughing, cooking and cleaning, clear headed kindness and selfless, caring, compassionate, oddly funny, and still trying, should feel foreign. But the more he stayed, the more he wanted to keep staying.
His heart swelled as Teddy fixed up the cards, and ran to one of the books lying on the floor.
“Is everything okay?”
They stood there for a while. The sun hitting their skin, the wind still blowing, and the animals moving along without a care. Harry just kept watching it, feeling amazed. He didn’t remember any of it, the campaigns or the fundraisers, but he did remember the feel of Buckbeak’s feathers under his hand, and the rush of adrenaline from flying on his back.
Soon enough, Harry’s spoon was scraping against the plate, trying to get as much as he could from the amazing meal. When he finally put his spoon and fork down, Malfoy smirked at him.
Finally closing the journal he had such a strong hate love relationship with, he rubbed his face to release the tension. Then he got up, and walked downstairs to greet whoever just came through.
After finishing his food, and relaxing his muscles for a bit, Harry and Kingsley walked back to his office.
A small hint of regret made its presence known as he reread the letter. Unknown Malfoy was still nice, albeit a bit more cold than yesterday. It was fair though, Harry had been a little bit of a git.
“You’ve said it before. But it won’t change what I think, what I’ve felt.” Malfoy slowed down, and took a deep breath. “Just give this desk job a try, yeah?”
The students cheered. A Gryffindor from the back spoke up in a voice that reminded Harry of Ludo Bagman. “Who’ll win next time on Longbottom versus Potter!”
“Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world, can’t get his pet owl off his head.” Malfoy deadpanned.
He told Malfoy of how he pretended. How it worked on people, how it made him feel like he had everything back again. He spoke of the intense jealousy he felt for himself, his old life, how he read his hard work and all of it was gone because of one mistake.
But it was now.
With a smile that was way too forced, Malfoy mumbled, “Tell Kingsley I said hello.”
“Yeah, I know. But thank you either way.” Harry held out his hand, for some reason wanting to reach out to him. “C’mon, you should sleep in a real bed.”
Isolt is perched on his shoulder. She’s been there for a while, ever since he came down actually. He knows he hasn’t seen her for a while, and feels incredibly bad about it. He even offered her the top of his head, feeling guilty. But she settled for his shoulder.
In a way, Malfoy was right. Harry did know he worked in potions, set up his own apothecary and is quite well known for it these days. He did not, however, know how it opened up or that it was in the Daily Prophet more than once.
Ron just nodded.
The words fell onto the trio’s ears, and they looked at him with surprise and hope.
“It was great actually. Did you eat yet?”
Goyle dragged Nott into the kitchen.
Isolt hooted softly, and moved onto his arm. They stood there for a while, just together. Memories of Hedwig came up, but the overwhelming regret and disappointment wasn’t there. Time was beginning to heal him, especially after he forgave himself for having another owl so soon after Hedwig.
Lavender smiled another sun filled smile, and began walking. “Come on, let me show you to your desk.”
But Harry can.
Pansy and Blaise would be inside anytime soon, and free to talk to while Malfoy handled his customers. It was a perfect time. He’d finally be able to relish the success of his pretending.
Malfoy just blinked in response. Harry wasn’t quite ready to hear Malfoy tell him about everything, but he knew that he probably never would be. It wasn’t fair to learn about this man’s past just by bits and pieces he’s picked up. Malfoy deserved to give his view on his life.
Their conversation started very slowly, mainly just catching up between the three. Nott would loudly comment on how he hit a writing block every now and then, downing a shot quickly after. Neville and Goyle would laugh softly with him, and Harry, watching, did too.
What came back first was Harry’s consciousness. For a split second, he thought that maybe he was dead. What proved him wrong, however, was the tingling sensation throughout his body. Death didn’t feel like that the first time. On the other hand, time also felt just as odd then as it did now.
As the trio walked to take one of the few tables left available, Harry took in as much as he could. There was a line at the front, where a glass case filled to the brim with all sorts of cakes and cookies were, then the movement through the opening into the kitchen caught his eye, then there were the waiters who seemed to actually enjoy themselves here. There was something about this place that spoke to him.
“Not so fast, Harry. I just showed you the desk, there’s a lot more to being in the investigatives.”
“I take the food was good then?”
He held out his left arm for Isolt to land on. Gradually, his eyes landed on a piece of scarred skin, one he didn’t even remember having since he was covered in a myriad of them.
“Hm, I guess. Is this your favourite story, Teddy?”
It’s almost lunchtime, but he isn’t hungry. He decides to skip this meal too. The office hasn’t really changed much since he first came into it. The mess was just cleared up, but he kept almost everything where it was before.
The eagle owl flew gracefully out the window. Isolt’s stare leaving it until it was a dot in the sky. He pet her gently, and gave her an owl treat too.
As Harry was leaning against the wall, window open and wind blowing through steadily, he sighed. Yesterday was insane. The rush of emotions all packed into a 24hr box, wrapped in sandpaper and held together with weak spellotape.
Malfoy’s smirk faltered, then slowly descended to a thin line. “A few years ago.”
He was prepared for all questions and statements, ready for his whole life to be told to him piece by piece by someone he’s never met. They ask about Voldemort, or about the scar, most times about the war. The amount of times he’s had to recall it was astronomical.
“Yeah about that, why does he have international all the time?” Harry wondered aloud.
, Harry thought. Before the thought could even relish in its existence, Harry piled it for later.
Harry pulled at his hair, then repeatedly took off and on his glasses. Like somehow the movement would do something different. Like maybe if he tried hard enough, he’d remember something. Something new. Something of unknown Harry.
“Yeah, he told me about it. That’s why Malfoy’s been a lot more run down whenever he gets home these days.” Harry replied, distance and coldness in his voice.
“Same. New book is killing me,” Nott huffed. “At least sales are growing again.”
“A-Anyway,” Harry sputtered. “Did you hear about Draco’s potions shop getting more sales lately?”
The trio started talking about whatever they could. From auror missions to meetings with higher ups. It was just a blur for Harry as he ate his delicious fish and chips. Harry still didn’t offer any more than 3 words at a time.
i forgot i never uploaded this chapter oops
It’s times like this that Harry wishes out of all the memories he had, he could forget overhearing Malfoy’s breakdown at The Burrow. Harry never talked it out with him, and to be honest, he didn’t think he ever could. Those words weren’t meant for Harry’s ears, even if they had fallen on them by accident.
Malfoy looked at Harry, scanning for anything that would hint of a lie. But nothing did. “Okay. Okay, fine. But Harry, you have to promise me that the moment it becomes overwhelming for you, you find me, okay?”
“Yeah, I’m okay!” Harry replied.
“I wouldn’t have touched the cake, you know me!” Ron said, appalled.
Harry, mouth filled with as much as he could fit in it, finally looked over at the students in the Great Hall. The difference couldn’t have been avoided even if he wanted to ignore it. But it was there.
Hermione, bless her, had started reading into muggle biology textbooks about memory loss and bringing it back. She suggested visiting places he’s been too before with other people, or simply just talking to the people he cared about. Ron smiled at her, and rolled his eyes as he did when Hermione started her neverending information talk.
“Oh, that’s my office. Didn’t think it was important.” Malfoy shrugged and continued walking.
The small idea that planted in his brain had finally taken root as he waved at Lara. Lara smiled and waved back, then continued doing her duties.
Harry couldn’t feel anything. It was as if his entire body had shut down. He couldn’t feel his heart beating, or his breathing. There was no feel of bile bubbling in his stomach, nor the jealousy that had been his motivation for so long.
“What are you talking about?”
Finally, he reached the investigative section in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He looked around at the desks, stacks of folders on top of each one. A little past the room of desks, there was a clear glass door and what looked like a sanitary station. On the table were a few wrapped items.
“I have a meeting to get to as well.” Hermione replied, standing up.
“And one day you won’t.” Malfoy looked at him imploringly. “This isn't the first time you’ve ended up in St Mungos, Harry. Not the first time you’ve been out for days on end, with me crying at your side.”
After all, Harry decided he wasn’t going to pretend to be other Harry to Malfoy at this point, right?
Hermione hid her exhaustion well too. Her dark skin looked a tinge more grey, than the full of life he was used to. Her jaw line jutted out, making it slightly more pronounced, and her smile didn’t reach her eyes.
“Yeah?” She smiled. “What makes you say that?”
That stopped Harry’s mind in its track. “He’s doing well.”
“So what’s for dinner?” Harry asked while they walked back.
“Is that eat here or takeaway?”
It’s been a while since Harry had felt anything of his uncontrollable magic. In fact, he didn’t think he’s had this for years. He knew that the Harry from before didn’t have this at all.
Harry stood there, looking at the mess of clothes on his bed. He had absolutely no clue what to wear for a celebration. Usually, celebrations called for semi-formal like that in the Ministry, but it was with the Weasley’s so surely it would be casual, right? So he tried for smart casual, a mix of the two, but nothing coordinated well together.
Opening the window was the first step. A gust of wind pushed through, and the smell of dust that Harry didn’t even notice was there, slowly began to disappear. The view from his window was beautiful. He could see the side of the neighbour’s house, the street below and the way it curved. He saw the front yard, eyes landing on the mix of flowers from lilies to daffodils. If he looked hard even, he could make out the shine of the wards. With wide eyes, he realised that this house was in a muggle neighbourhood.
Harry tried to breathe normally. He knew a given opportunity when he saw it, and Kingsley handed it to him on a silver plate. Thankful that Kingsley didn’t push him, he gave a small smile. But even so, his brain started caving into itself.
Despite his head being filled with work, he often had a spare moment to think of his next performance as other Harry. To be honest, the majority of his body opposed the idea with full force, whilst the other bit told him that he had thought of it for a while.
Ever since then, he has been working in both modelling and photography. Blaise was happy with where he was, with how he got there.
“Hey, girl. You’re not flying today?”
“You have an office upstairs.” Malfoy started. Harry didn’t comment on how tired his voice suddenly was. “It has your stuff in it. A desk, books, journals. Hermione told me you had to regain your memory a different way. Maybe spending some time in there would help?”
Harry knows he’s closing himself off from everyone. Talking to Ron and Hermione with quick sharp responses and too many one-word answers. But he’s jealous, and he can’t help it.
It was the usual tests of stamina, strength, flexibility, and reflexes. The three of them must’ve gone all around the auror department to check everything. From sprinting 50 metres in record time, to duelling Kingsley himself, it was exhausting, but exhilarating.
“W-well,” He cleared his throat to give himself a bit more time. “Work has taken over, so we aren’t seeing each other much. But… He cooks for me.”
Harry didn’t expect to hug her again so soon, but he couldn’t help it. Minerva hadn’t changed, she was just as she was, and it meant everything to Harry right now.
“Isoooolt!”
When she opened her satchel, and took out messy stacks of parchment, Harry noticed all the writing and diagrams. The parchment may have been all over the place, but her notes were pristine. On par with Malfoy and Hermione, if not better.
They stayed like that for a moment, like a movie paused at the worst and weirdest time. But just as suddenly, they burst out laughing.
Harry nodded. “If it’s overwhelming, I’ll find you.”
“Huh? Oh, yeah, they’re okay. They’ll get better soon.” The smile was back on her face, better than ever. “Besides, I got to see 3 out of my 4 favourite customers again after, like what, 10 years?”
The knowledge that Harry Potter had lost his memory was still kept under wraps, known only by Tina, Ron, Hermione, and presumably Malfoy. ‘The Boy Who Lived Once Again: Immortal?’ was one of the worst articles he’d ever read.
“Right now? About 90 years, give or take a good few thousand.”
There was so much energy coursing through his veins. His magic was all stir crazy now. He could feel it in the way his fingers twitched around for his wand, or the way his lips would mouth spells.
“Yeah, ‘course.” Harry took a swing of his beer. “Actually, I’ve been meaning to ask, how did you all meet? Again, I mean.”
Harry cringed at the thought. “Yeah, they did. Thanks,”
She smiled back, and patted his shoulder. “Just call me Minerva. That’s what you called me before.”
One thing he could definitely notice was how his heart, whilst creating a natural disaster in his chest, felt lighter and freer. The words had made his heart nod in such excitement, to agree so feverently.
he thought as he spun around, feeling the spiralling lurch of apparition.
Malfoy looked at Harry, and smiled at him. He even gave a small wave just before another customer dragged him to the cauldrons. Harry didn’t know he was smiling until his cheeks hurt.
He could feel it again, that taste of what had been ripped away from him.
Tina was a good healer, Harry decided. She didn’t give anything away from her face and didn’t treat him differently.
Harry knew they were both extremely passionate about their jobs, their careers, and they held an insurmountable pride for it. No wonder the aura of confidence grew around them.
Isolt hooted softly, and flew out the room. Harry assumed that the rattle sound was Isolt in her cage.
*****
“Something grand must’ve happened for me to ever date you.” Harry said, venom laced into his words. “With our history, different sides of the war. The things you family did against mine. I didn’t think I’d ever forgive that, even if I did speak at your trial.”
Neville’s smile got even brighter if that was possible. He nodded. “Yeah, for about 3 and a half years? They’re amazing, I could talk about them all day.”
What he’s learnt from that celebration was just how everyone there was living their best lives. They were at their peak, and Harry was once right there with him. Now fate, the dirty bugger, brought him back a few steps. It was infuriating. Why can’t he just live his best life, too? It was right there.
“I’m head of Gryffindor!”
Malfoy dodged just in time. “
Teddy sat up at that, and looked Harry in the eyes. Under his gaze, Harry felt vulnerable. He was amazed that Teddy could do that, but still, he gulped like he did something wrong.
Harry gave them to her. He didn’t have the heart to just leave her, so he asked, “Are you okay, by the way?”
“You had days where you said you couldn’t handle magic anymore.” Malfoy seemed to struggle with this one. “Times when you rejected it. Even now, sometimes you forget you’re a wizard. See, the first day you came back, despite your entire situation being covered in magic, you forgot you could clean up that spill with a spell, that you were a wizard. It was like your body remembered that you turned it away.”
Harry didn’t even need to tell Malfoy he wanted to leave. He tapped his shoulder, and Malfoy instantly knew. 5 minutes later they were in the floo, having said brief goodbyes to everyone. Harry walked straight to the bedroom, and flopped onto the bed.
When Malfoy laughed, teeth shining and eyes twinkling, everything felt right again.
“Did you hear about my memory?”
Teddy huffed in annoyance. “You were lying to her while we were eating sandwiches!” He whispered loudly. “She might not have noticed, but I did.”
Malfoy put his hands over his face. After a few seconds, he exhaled, schooled his features, and shoved his messy hair away from his face. Harry stared at Malfoy, wondering how he was able to hide it all, even after just crying.
“Because it’s one of your favourites. You’ve read it to me a lot of times since you found this copy in a ‘garage sale.’” Teddy put quotation marks. “I kept reading it to figure out why it’s your favourite, but I still don’t get it.”
Luna popped up beside him, with Malfoy disappearing into a hushed conversation with Ginny.
Still, Harry looked a little harder, observed a little more, when it came to Malfoy. His idea of pretending was a tricky one, and either way, he didn’t think he had the guts to play it on Malfoy just yet. Especially with how he said he still knew Harry. Malfoy would see right through it.
Malfoy never came back after the day Harry first woke up. He started to think maybe he hallucinated him ever being there. But asking about Malfoy made Ron, Hermione, and Tina change the subject almost immediately. It wasn’t like he
Parkinson and Zabini looked at each other, a silent conversation between them. Harry looked out the doorway and into the shop. Malfoy was there, dealing with customers professionally.
He looked back at Hace who paid him no attention, and then to Tatus who seemed to ask him if he was okay. Just how different was Harry with his memories gone? Had he really lost the life he had built from one damn mistake on the field?
“Oh, he definitely did.”
And he did.
Teddy had a smirk that made him think of Tonks. Harry continued the game with a fierce determination to win, trying to quell a small growth of fear and guilt in his chest.
“What?”
Malfoy still had a smile on his face, remnants of the laughter from earlier. But that wasn’t just it. The laughter was definitely sorely needed on Malfoy’s part because his eyes seemed to be a bit more lively, and his skin a little more healthier.
The office was incredible. This is the one place, the first place, that really felt like him. Even if it wasn’t the same Harry that left this room, the Harry now that entered it felt right at home.
Then he thought back to Hermione’s words. Words that had somehow gotten even more distant in a time he believed he probably needed it most. He hadn’t thought back to those words in what felt like years, as if those words melded themselves into the memories of before the 5 year void.
the selfish one?” Harry laughed. He actually laughed at the thought. “You’re the one without a damn heart. Acting like nothing’s changed. Typical of a Malfoy. In case you haven’t noticed,
“You brought people’s attention to this idea. You raised awareness and money.”
The office had changed a lot from what he remembered it was five years ago. There were pictures now hung on the wall, all sorts of people together, standing next to Kingsley. It seemed to range from ministry events to personal celebrations. Even the curtains were open wide, letting in the sunlight. It was so different from the empty and cold office Kinglsey used to have.
Out of all the stories, he didn’t expect Beauty and the Beast. Even so, it was a good story. So he opened the book, and read it to Teddy.
It wasn’t familiar, no memories came through, but he was already enjoying himself here.
He looked back at the archway to the kitchen, and there it was. A beautiful brown owl, staring up at him with the widest eyes he’s ever seen. It hooted again softly, and tilted its head as Harry walked closer.
Harry wasn’t sure if he would have, to be honest. But one thing he was sure of was that their guard was up. Both of them were extremely cautious, just like in Hogwarts. Zabini and his watchful eye, and Parkinson with her defensive questions.
Harry slowly opened his eyes, and was amazed at how much time he’d spent wallowing in his own sad thoughts. The shadow of the tree was even longer as the sun descended closer to the horizon.
Then Harry felt it. His body roared to life like a fire that got new fuel. Now he could feel everything. He could feel his magic course around him like a second skin. His fingertips were tingling. The vein in his neck pulsed with his racing heartbeat. His hair stood up, his eyes went in and out of focus.
Harry’s desperate to remember something. Anything. To give him hope that the life he had for the past 5 years could come back. All the hard work he did in order to get to that life, he couldn’t let it go.
Harry watched as Malfoy took out a bit of his anger on the food, chewing with a glare. Harry felt the side of his lips twitch into a smile.
“Yep, that’s how.” Nott chipped in, smirking.
“So, Harry. How have you been lately?” Parkinson asked, her eyebrow raised at the mac and cheese for Malfoy.
Her head turned to look at him once more with a half hearted smile. Then slowly, her eyes travelled to the scar. Her eyes widened.
Somehow, Harry had woken up in a bed when he distinctly remembered he fell asleep on the floor. He sat up, and looked around. This must’ve been the bedroom unknown Malfoy and unknown Harry had shared. Laundry basket in the corner, drawers and closets pushed against the wall.
“Since the first day,” She said.
“Do you think we’re stupid, Potter?” Pansy asked, voice quiet but sharp.
“So what’s for-”
Hermione’s still searching for something to help. She comes over when she’s free and talks about muggle biology and again tries the counter curse for
Goyle just cringed and slapped Nott’s shoulder lightly. “Gross.”
Harry had to stay in St Mungo’s for a few weeks longer. His days were filled with spells and diagnostic charms that it all started to meld together. All Tina could do was watch over him and wait for any memories to come through while he was hospitalised.
“Hmm,” She laughed. “No. It didn’t hurt at all.”
“Don’t do that, Harry. Don’t lie. You don’t need to, and you don’t have to.” Pansy finished, the final wave reeling back into the ocean.
Well, to be fair, Harry’s silence and blinking dumbfounded face was completely reasonable. He wasn’t expecting that question, especially when it wasn’t the main focus in many of the writings about himself.
Malfoy was truly and utterly beautiful.
A few hours later, everyone was still chatting amongst each other happily. Molly, Arthur, Andromeda and Teddy were back in the room since it was too dark to play outside anymore, despite the
He didn’t realise he never thought about the people who cleaned up the mess.
“And I’ve missed you too! You can’t go disappearing again for so long,” She huffed. “Anyway, where’s Draco? He’s at work?”
That’s gone now, though. Harry lost hope every passing second. Nothing had come yet, no memories of passing smiles or bouts of laughter. No beach parties or wedding celebrations. Nothing.
Ron nodded. “Yeah, and sometimes lookouts take days until we get the information we need. There’s no consistency and it’s hard to plan, but I send my patronus to her, telling her I love her and all. Other times, when I get home we plan an instant date.”
At that, they all somehow brightened up significantly and went back to playing. Though there were hushed whispers of ‘bets,’ and ‘duels.’
“It was one hell of an experience. Think of it this way,” Ginny looked like she was trying to find the right words. “The both of them were heavily intoxicated, and Celestina Warbeck’s hit single Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love started playing.”
How is it that I, somehow your boyfriend, lost memories of our entire relationship and you can just carry on like normal? I fall through the floo, and you’re treating me like nothing’s happened.” Harry’s voice was trembling, a mix of anger hiding the sadness.
Harry asked himself.
You can’t look at a case for too long or it becomes mush. Anyway, I do have a life outside of work, don’t you?”
“Is Neville coming?”
Aside from the evidence areas, there were small rooms spaced out amongst the place. Each room held a single pensieve and what seemed to be a vast collection of memories held in glass vials.
It started off when he walked through those entrance doors. A rush of aurors ran quickly, urgency seeping off their skin. For a moment, Harry started running too, until he realised he wasn’t authorised to be with them.
“Mr Potter!” A student called out just before he could walk up the stairs.
Neville wasn’t taking it though. “They didn’t notice, but I did. Harry, I’ve known you since we were 11, so I know when you’re not thinking right.”
“Hi guys! It’s been a while, where were you lot?” She asked.
The office, the books, the magic.
“It was at Draco’s surprise birthday party. We, uh, all decided he needed one after everything that happened…”
Harry hugged Hace tightly, trying not to scare him off or make him regret accepting him, but he put his entire heart into the hug. Hoping that Hace could understand the amount of sadness Harry had in his heart for this creature.
It was small things like that that dug slowly but deeply into Harry's skin. Small things about the Harry from before, details that wouldn’t be in the journal or the books. They were small things, but they just kept piling on, and it screamed out to Harry how different he really was.
Some part of him did want to do it. A small, teeny tiny little bit. He didn’t know it existed until he thought about this plan. But his mind did want to refuse.
The spell didn’t last more than a minute which Harry was eternally grateful for. He watched as Tina wrote studiously on the papers in her clipboard. When she finished, she looked back to Harry and sat down on the spare seat.
“No, Ron, I distinctly remember it was both.” Blaise Zabini’s deep voice rang through as he brushed the soot off his clothes and walked towards Neville.
They continued walking down. When they passed another door and Malfoy didn’t note it, Harry stopped. “What about this one?”
His eyes continued to browse the room, taking note of muggle lamps. For a house that has been lived in for years by two people, it seemed like it was missing something. Bits and pieces of things were here and there, a stack of wooden dragons on one table, a discarded coat, but it stillfelt bare.
With one startling moment, Harry realised that Malfoy must know at least a little bit of his traumatic childhood. He wasn’t sure how to handle that information. Thankful that he didn’t need to tell Malfoy, but also uncomfortable he knew something he kept deep down.
Luna told him all about her life in the past 5 years. They moved around a bit until they sat on the couch, Luna still recalling important parts of her life to things that were more of a flavour text of sorts.
When he gets home, door still unlocked and the house thankfully not a theft crime scene, Isolt is waiting at the open window in the dining room next to another owl. This other owl stood up high and proud, a letter of what must be of great importance tired to its talons. Isolt seemed to watch the stranger with a close eye, protectiveness seeping through her gaze.
*****
Harry thought maybe there was a silver lining in losing his memory.
Harry tried to leave that thought for later. But his mind didn’t quite let him, as he ended up thinking about Malfoy’s hand in his, gripping tightly and lovingly. Just like it was held in St Mungo’s when he woke up, just like it was when he was asleep.
“Malfoy!” He called out, hoping this wasn’t a bad idea.
That made the room a little lighter, and they all started to talk about whatever they could without revealing too much.
He talked about how he needed to do something. How through this, at least he was moving. At least he was doing something productive. Forcing the memories was better than just waiting.
Harry quickly took his hand away, and stood up. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He ignored the way his hand tingled, or the fast beating of his heart, or the way his chest leaped. “Why were you sleeping here?”
She looked at her notes, avoiding eye contact with Harry. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine.”
“Hm?” Malfoy seemed a little distracted, and didn’t look up at Harry.
Ron was head auror, and rightfully so. Through training, Ron developed his strategic mind, one Harry knew he had from the beginning with Wizard’s Chess. Ron was careful, and logical, and moved without recklessness compared to Harry’s instincts of ‘now or never.’ Harry couldn’t imagine anyone else being head auror. He knew Ron doubted his qualifications for the role, but Ron was brave, noble and respectful. He was perfect for the position.
This man worked as an apprentice under a famous potioneer for 4 years before opening his own potions shop. He still keeps in touch with his teacher, who had retired a few months back. Malfoy’s love for potions stemmed from a very young age, and his skills were genuine. Despite Snape showing favouritism, Harry knew that Malfoy did deserve every good grade he got in that class.
Harry looked at Minerva, who had gone back into a conversation with Flitwick and Slughorn, and marvelled at her. The house unity she tried so hard to achieve had not only come to reality, but it was even beyond what he thought was possible.
Even so, he’d much prefer to know Isolt was safe and on his head, than anywhere else and not.
“I understand how you feel,” Harry said to her with a gentle smile.
He wanted to punch something, or cry, or scream into the emptiness of the forbidden forest where no one could worry about him. But he didn’t do either. Instead, he took a step towards the hippogriff with the sun in its feathers. The hippogriff that the old Harry had connected with.
“The table’s fine. I’ll come over.”
Before Harry fell into a deep sleep, lying on his bed a few hours later, Malfoy in the spare room next to him, he thought of what to do. There was one more day before Hogwarts.
So he bought a camera, a muggle one. Extremely expensive Harry guessed with the amount of details Blaise gave about it. He began to dabble in photography. He took opportunities to take photos of his co-workers who modelled with him.
“Yeah,” Harry said while vigorously nodding. “Okay, yeah. I need a break.”
Harry hung his head lower, willing himself to sink into the chair. He couldn’t even look at Pansy anymore as she struck each blow with her words.
He had spent 5 entire days looking into the life of a person through other people’s eyes. There was no journal of hers, no written notes or secret love letters, no engraving on the ring or a lover to recite her woes.
“Alrigh’. We’ll be learnin’ abou’ hippogriffs.” He looked at Harry who was standing awkwardly beside him. “My Potter ‘ere is going to help us.”
It couldn’t have lasted longer than half a second, and it didn’t take Harry any longer to have his foot through the floo.
He’s learning more about this unknown Harry. It helps with his performances, but other than that it feels like weight pulling down on his chest. Unknown Harry was so optimistic, so care free and lively, now it’s just holding a soul of sadness and envy.
“Oh, awesome.”
Harry sucked in a breath, and slowly let it out.
“Harry, you’re okay. Thank, Merlin, you’re okay.” Malfoy smiled so brightly, and it took off years from his face. Then it turned icey and accusing. “Potter, you idiot. You scared the shit out of me! I’d have half a mind to slap you to oblivion.”
“Fighting is all I know, it’s what I’m good at.” Harry countered. “I want to be able to use my experiences for good.”
Even the pretending with Pansy and Blaise had become almost numbing. There was no more satisfaction, and if there was, it was fleeting. It felt like it was too easy.
“That’s good. I’ll visit him today.”
The same was with the small amount of evidence. A ring that was found in her front yard, and a wand.
“Leaf?” Harry asked.
But she was cut off with a smack to her head.
“Hi, Teddy!” Harry said as he was squatting, arms open for Teddy to run into.
Harry didn’t get the chance to even nod in reply before she continued.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at that, hands immediately trying to cover his laughter that bubbled out of him uncontrollably. Goyle’s deadpan voice was so sudden and different from how he had been the entire time.
He decided to tackle the desk first. Moving around to sit down, he took note of just how messy it was. Broken quills and dried out ink pots littered one of the corners. He moved to grab one of the pens, and tested it on a random piece of paper. Out of the 3 pens on the table, only one of them could actually be used.
Ginny arrived towards the end of Luna’s 5 year catchup, sitting next to her. She slipped her hands into Luna’s and held on. The wedding ring glinting on Ginny’s hand.
Harry followed.
Malfoy was nowhere to be found. Harry looked at the kitchen counter, and of course, there was a note.
“Nothing!” Malfoy singsonged, then disappeared before the wall again.
Harry nodded vigorously. They continued to eat lunch in peace, saving a lot of the food for Malfoy. Turns out, the trio didn’t really have much of an appetite after that confrontation.
So Harry continued his normal everyday. No true memories coming back, no ‘new perspectives’ unlocked. Nothing. Just absolutely nothing.
Harry gave a soft chuckle, and shook his head. Malfoy must be in a good mood, it’s his day off after all. A much deserved break.
It’s always time.
One time he asked a coworker beside him in the coffee room how long she’d been working on her case. Harry grimaced and wanted to cry when she said, “About two months.”
So Harry wanted a while, hidden. It wasn’t until it was his usual lunch break that he walked into the store, the familiar bell ringing.
The class laughed, and even Hagrid gave a hearty chuckle.
Aside from the diaries, there were journals that held a bit more than one sentence. It wasn’t much, but they held some newspaper clippings of things that Harry seemed to actually be happy about. From Ginny and Luna’s wedding article to the ‘The Coming Out of Ronald Weasley (and what it could mean for Hermione Granger)’ Harry laughed at that one both then, and now. Regardless of Ron’s sexuality, his love for Hermione is too strong.
“Does he know you’re here?” Kingsley asked carefully.
A snort of laughter left his mouth. Isolt nipped gently at his hands. He told her he wasn’t going to write a reply, and that she should go home, that he’ll be there soon.
The healer’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion. “Tina. I’m healer Tina.” She scribbled some notes onto her papers as Harry tried not to look at Hermione who gasped softly.
“Harry, you make it out like all you had before was everything,” Malfoy started, talking in a tone of finality. “But back then, when you were living in it, you thought you had
A knock on the door took Harry away from his reading trance. The candle on his desk was lit, and the sky was darker than when he last saw it. He was biting his nails as he was reading, and didn’t notice how jagged they had become.
“I’m sorry…” Harry whispered softly.
“Yeah, well. You know him, doesn’t let many people in when he’s very stressed,” Nott murmured into his shot of firewhiskey before swigging it.
“Yeah, something like that,” Harry told them, and quickly pushed the conversation away from that topic. “How’s work been for you?”
There was a distant crash that sounded from the kitchen. Then it was the shelves shaking. The ground began to quake.
His memories stayed hidden, locked away with no knowledge of a key or an
Kingsley just chuckled. “Yeah, I know. I was just joking.”
Despite seeing Malfoy everyday, Harry noticed how little they actually talked. With his new job, and with how busy the apothecary was, they didn’t hold much conversation during Harry’s lunch break, and by the time dinner was over, they were too tired to do anything else.
“Yeah, but she prefers Andromeda.”
“Who is it? Who am I living with?” Harry asked as the silence grew too long and his thoughts grew too loud. His friends flinched slightly at the intensity in his voice.
“It was a great night, either way. Oh, by the way, when mum and dad danced, it was one hell of a sight.” Ginny said.
“Which is…?”
He swore he heard Hermione and Ron whispering with Malfoy as well, but he was too thick with sleep at that point to properly register it.
tried to hit on each and every one of them.”
Harry felt incredibly vulnerable under Malfoy’s gaze. It was like he was being analysed layer by layer, piece by piece. But he stood his ground, he let Malfoy search him so that any doubts in Malfoy’s mind would ease. For what reason he did this, Harry didn’t know. But his heart told him to be open to Malfoy, to let Harry, the current real Harry, to be seen.
“I don’t remember any of it. I stared at that picture for what felt like years, trying to bring a memory into existence. Nothing came back.” Harry sighed and finally looked up.
Now, if anyone asked Harry what happened, he’d lie and say he took the news with the calm and collected mindset worthy of the Minister herself. That he understood the decision, and knew it was for the best. After all, his boss is his friend and has watched him grow from a young boy to now.
Nott didn’t reply, but thankfully Neville did. “He does that when he has a ‘spark of inspiration,’ he says.”
Malfoy grinned. “Yeah, I’m starving.”
Harry looked towards the kitchen, Malfoy’s head poking out. He remembered the way it did the first day he came here. How far the both of them had come, how far they had yet to go.
Malfoy started playing with his hands. Harry stilled picked at the carpet.
Harry stayed with his hippogriff as he watched the rest of the class approach their own. Surprisingly there was enough for each person, compared to back in his third year.
Harry hesitated, but nodded. “Just... Don’t tell Draco yet. They’re only small glimpses, and nothing else has really come back.”
Malfoy was laughing with his entire being. He seemed to
But he held onto her wording. “To us,’ She said. Not to anyone else.
Under a shimmering stasis charm, a box of owl treats sat untouched. He took one and gave it to Isolt who ate it happily from his hand. His heart hurt as memories of Hedwig came through. But when Isolt rubbed her head against Harry’s hand, and looked up at him with big eyes, he felt that it would be okay.
Harry didn’t notice Nev and Nott’s conversation had quieted down. Neville was quiet, giving space and time for Harry to get used to Goyle and Nott. While it was nice and caring, he was actually feeling like he was suffocating.
He didn’t even realise how much his chest was hurting. It wasn’t from anger this time, no, it was the same low thrum of emotional pain he felt just before he sobbed his heart out only a few hours ago. Something was wrong.
“No problem. Just make sure you come more often, we’ve missed your face.”
Harry smiled at Malfoy. A proper smile this time, because he definitely deserved it. A small thought appeared in his mind, one that said that maybe, just maybe, having Malfoy as a boyfriend was a good call. Malfoy gave Harry a proper smile back. Harry didn’t know he missed it until he saw it.
Malfoy’s voice was so soft, like it would be the final push for Harry to go over the edge. Oh, how it was the complete opposite.
“I know what you’re doing, by the way.” Neville’s voice shot right through Harry, and all the guilt, fear, and jealousy rose up like bubbling lava.
But Hace looked at Harry, and in those eyes was understanding, forgiveness, and acceptance.
Harry chuckled a bit, knowing how hard it was to get sand off from a day at the beach.
“You were fantastic, Hagrid! They loved you,” Harry said with a smile.
“For scaring you, I mean. That’s what I’m apologising for.” Harry lowered his hands.
Harry gulped and finally looked at Malfoy and was surprised by his reaction. It was a soft sad smile, and tears were brimming at his eyes.
Harry gathered Malfoy was trying to keep himself together. But when tears started falling onto the table, just behind the unfinished plate of food, Harry stopped breathing all together.
“While we were celebrating, our small friendship group of Slytherins, Neville called on the floo. He’d brought work with him, asking Draco if the plants were still okay for his potion brewing.”
“No, Harry.” Malfoy looked back at the papers and began shuffling them faster than before. “We’ve had this conversation countless times before but you don’t remember, so I’m going to tell you for the first time again. I support your career choice, Harry. I love how passionate you are about it, but... There are other ways to help the world and save people.”
Harry felt himself deflate. There was nothing he could do. He saw the unmoving face, the stubborn tone, and knew it would be a losing fight.
“Hello again.” Harry walked over, put down his food and grabbed the note.
This was going to be harder than he thought. How had he befriended them before? Were they this guarded when he met them?
Her smile never left her face. Her curly dark brown hair matched her dark skin that seemed to glow like the sun made a home in her heart. Her eyes were just as bright. She was happy, incredibly so, and it radiated throughout the building.
“Oh, hi Harry,” Ron smiled brightly.
Same same same same same.
“Hm?” Harry might’ve been way too focused into the game.
His eyes travelled over each page. Remnants of his anger made him have to reread sentences. He finally got halfway through a journal, which he found was just filled with dates for interviews, meetings, and speeches, and decided it was time for a break.
But the worst of it was his head. He felt pressure building up so quickly in his head he was surprised it hadn’t exploded yet. He could feel every heartbeat pound against his skull.
If Malfoy thought something was odd about Harry not having visited him at the store, he didn’t let on. Harry knew it wasn’t fair, but fear crept into his mind when he thought about Pansy and Blaise catching his thoughts.
“I… Helped with all... of this?” Harry gestured to the gigantic field in front of them.
“Can you help me?” Harry asked politely.
Minerva nodded sadly, then began to walk, leading the way for Harry to follow.
“Mr Potter and I must go now.” Minerva smiled gently at her students.
“It’s not your fault. It’s no one’s fault.” Malfoy’s voice was back to the calmness it was before. “Bad situations seem to have a thing for us, don’t they?”
He got up, and walked into the bathroom. Begrudgingly, he began to get ready for the day. Finding clothes somewhere amongst the wardrobes, guessing his toothbrush was the strikingly deep Gryffindor red that bordered on obnoxious, he finally got there.
“Yeah. Sorry about that.” Pansy said.
It was peaceful, watching the movement of the room from a wall’s perspective. Everyone moved around, catching up and sharing stories they wanted to tell. There were a lot of people, and a lot of stories, but it just worked. It worked so well.
” He said to himself.
“So that you wouldn’t worry. Didn’t matter. They didn’t tell you about me ‘til a few days ago, remember?” Malfoy’s hands were fidgeting, rolling his wand back and forth across the table. He was still incredibly calm despite the sharpness in his words.
His hands started to fidget, begging for something to do, but his mind was exhausted. He looked around at the mess of his office. Thankful to have something mindless to do, he got up and started cleaning.
Next to Malfoy were a much older Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini than he remembered. There was softness in their faces as they leaned forward to look at the cheering squad. They laughed as they raised their arms. Neville Longbottom, Theodore Nott, and Greogoy Goyle were there too, looking at each other smiling, until they all leaned back, laughing.
“Not… remembering?” Even Harry knew it was a weak excuse.
“Merlin, I can only imagine. Really, everyone there should’ve known sun shield charms don’t last nearly long enough.”
“Welcome home,” Harry says to him.
“I’m glad he does.” Harry looked at Teddy with a smile. “He even brought it to Ginny’s 23rd birthday, huh?”
It was begging for his memory to return. It was pleading and praying, and no answers. It was denial at the situation because how could he
Malfoy looked tired and broken all over again. Harry’s heart pulled towards him, but he stayed where he was. Whoever this Malfoy is, he didn’t love him. Not like unknown Harry did, and not the way unknown Malfoy wanted him to.
He threw away all his old and broken things. He cleared out his drawers, the folders, the shelves. Case folders that must’ve been missing from the aurors, he packed, ready to return to Kingsley tomorrow when he gets to work.
“Are you sure you won’t be using my floo, Harry?” Minerva asked as she pulled away from the hug.
“Yes, but I don’t think you would’ve noticed the cake at all with how quickly you put things into your mouth.” Malfoy added with a shake of his head,
Harry ignored the way his heart flipped at that.
He didn’t miss the pair of twins that started a whisper of a betting pool. It was so jarringly similar to a pair of redheaded twins that were no more. But he watched as the twin girls, one wearing green robes, the other wearing red, discussed their own bets.
Now here was Isolt, content and perched on Harry’s arm as he rubbed her neck softly. Her feathers were soft and well taken care of. Isolt, with her range of browns all over her body, was incredibly different from Hedwig's snow white. Even so, Harry could imagine himself loving Isolt just as much.
“Pansy, Blaise, is everything okay?” Harry asked kindly.
“Are you okay?” He asked, Nott.
Harry chortled. “Yeah, they really do.”
Harry laughed, a slight blush on his face.
Ginny looked excited to recount that day, and Luna just rolled her eyes affectionately while looking at her wife. Harry swallowed the lump that formed at his throat at the pure adoration they had for each other, and nodded.
“We still on for the Three Broomsticks tonight?” Harry asked.
“I thought he went for the apple pie with treacle ice cream?” Parkinson spoke up from next to Hermione.
need them back.”
But sometimes, when he’s tossing and turning in his sleep, trying to calm the pain that kept him sleeping too lightly, he feels someone hold his hand. And while his mind screams in confusion, his body fights a little harder against the pain. As always, when he’s fully awake, they’re gone.
“If I could be the other Harry, if I could relive his life then maybe…” Harry was struggling so much.
“What?” Harry asked.
It was a joke in poor taste. But when Harry went to comment on it, Malfoy’s face had contorted in a cringe, regret all over his face. Harry suppressed a laugh at the image in front of him, and continued to move around the room.
The 3 days passed like everything else. Only difference was the way his mind wandered to Malfoy a lot more than usual, and how his sleep no longer consisted of hands to hold. But it wasn’t like he needed it anymore. The pain has gotten a lot better.
“Okay,” Malfoy replied through a yawn.
“There’s a picture frame on my desk,” He said slowly, avoiding Malfoy’s eyes. “It’s got everyone in it, you, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna, Ginny, even some of the other Slytherins from school.”
He overheard a bad card pun from one of the Slytherin’s, and couldn't help but laugh loudly.
It was coming from the living room. Intrigued, he moved to the living room, trying to flatten his shirt in case some guests had arrived. But when he got there, Malfoy was just putting takeout on the table and sitting on one of the chairs surrounding it.
. And-”
Malfoy sighed and finally looked at Harry. “How did it go? Going on the field tomorrow then?”
And with those lovely last words, she left. Harry decided to have a nap.
“Kiana. My name’s Kiana.”
In one swift motion, Blaise got up, and closed the backroom door. He waved his hand and muttered a spell, and the familiar low thrum of magic covered the room.
Harry’s stomach lurched.
The next two days were completely uneventful. With Malfoy going to work, Harry started getting back into his workout. A slow build up was what he needed, so he began with sticking to morning runs. The cool morning air mixed with the thin layer of sweat was an experience he didn’t know he missed.
“I always have,” Harry whispered just as softly.
On the desk were an array of ink bottles and pens that looked like they were from a 2 dollar muggle shop. He had shelves with stacks of folders shoved hastily on top of each other. There were a few books, a mix of muggle and magical. On the window sill was a potted plant, not dead yet, but seemed to be in need of a lot of care.
“What are you guys doing here?” It was cold, but they didn’t flinch.
Another knock on the door. “Harry? Just checking up on you, are you okay?”
“Ginny, I wanted more firewhiskey, not food!” Ron chimed in.
Halfway into breakfast, a silver-blue wispy lynx burst into the room, scaring the heart out of everyone in the room, including Isolt. When they regained their composure, Harry knew his day off would not be that at all.
Harry sipped the water slowly, trying out his voice in between. The silence from his mouth turned into a whisper, and that turned into a croak, which turned into his voice with a considerably large amount of cracks. He wondered how long he was out for if his throat was that bad.
He skimmed through the cases, trying to choose which one he’d focus on. The second one was most interesting. It was focused on the disappearance of a young woman.
“Okay.” He finally muttered out.
And Malfoy just nodded, and whispered, “I know.”
In auror training, one of the most important lessons is getting information from a glance. One glance at Malfoy was all Harry needed, but he continued to stare on.
The fight paused in his body. Why wasn’t Malfoy fighting? Or running away? Harry blinked his tears away as his other fist kept clenching.
“We probably won’t tell him, as long as you’ve learnt your lesson. Remember, Harry. You will regret it.” Pansy reiterated.
Harry nodded, feeling confused and a sinking of his heart. Why was it that when he thinks about going back to the field, part of his body fights it? Has he become scared of the work now?
Malfoy studied him closely, then smiled softly. “Isolt came to me, hooting all over the place. Now I’ve got grease splatters on my shirt.”
After a long talk with Ron and Tina, Harry decided to try getting the memories himself. Apparently, the clash of spells that hit him during his apparent last auror raid was Obliviate, Confundus, and Stupefy. The shield that he threw up wasn’t strong enough. So, added onto the onslaught of spells, he flew back and hit his head hard against the brick wall.
“Damn it!” Harry exclaimed loudly.
“Yep!”
He retreated his hand from Hermione and moved his legs away from Ron. It was so snake-like, coiling into himself. Hugging himself like the scared kid he was in the cupboard all those years ago.
“I know, isn’t it great? I’ll finally be out of here.” He smiled a little too much to be considered genuine.
Teddy shook his head. “No, this one’s weird to me.”
“It’s not a good idea, don’t do it. Do not.” Neville firmly stated.
“Luna, my love, come here! We need a gameplan.” Ginny’s voice travelled from across the room.
It made his next action a lot easier.
But it’s gone now, and no memories have come back. It’s been too long for him.
Malfoy’s voice was muffled slightly through the door, but he could still hear that hint of concern.
“Malf-”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
“I may be young, but I’m not stupid.” Teddy suddenly looked like the child he was, young and vulnerable, and so betrayed. “So why were you doing it?”
They left the window open for when it would like to leave.
You’d think for someone who’s died before wouldn’t be thought as immortal, yet here were the conspiracy theories.
Harry and Malfoy were still swamped and tired from work. Malfoy began leaving before Harry even woke up to ensure all the potions brewing in the side of his shop were of the best quality. Harry didn’t mind, head filled the thoughts of his own job.
“Hm, sounds like a problem for tomorrow.”
When the third years started piling in, almost no one was wearing bags for parchment or quills. Harry was surprised, no one even brought the textbook. It didn’t seem to bother Hagrid though, as he stood up tall and greeted the small third years with the kindness he’s always had.
So that’s what this is about. Harry spent enough time as an auror, even without his memories, to know when someone is trying to get a gauge on your mental health. He’d done it many times before, and even did it for his own gain.
Once the window opened, Harry expected Isolt to go flying. Yet, she didn’t. She kept staring at Harry, head tilted, as if she knew this Harry was different. Owls were incredibly smart. As the staring continued, he felt like he was being tested. Finally, Isolt hooted softly, and moved to rub her head against Harry’s jaw.
“Is Dakota okay?” He asked, swerving the potential of a pronoun mistake.
“See you again soon,” Harry waved. “I’ll bring you guys food next time!”
But the silence fell, and the only sound was the water. Harry looked away, coming to the conclusion that, yeah, it was kinda weird to look so he stared at the lake.
Harry stood up and while Isolt flew for a second, she only landed on top of his head once more. He put his arm in front of him for Isolt to land on, but she stayed perched on his head. He tried to look up at Isolt, and Isolt was only looking back down at him and tilted her head.
“Clothes, right?”
“No need to thank me. I have been your main healer for the past 4 years.” She smiled, a hint of sadness in there.
Malfoy was scraping the last of the food from the pan onto a plate. The smell of the dish hit him so hard he started salivating. His stomach roared loudly.
Harry sighed. He knew it was a good idea at first, but Harry’s thought about it many times and still struck down the idea. “Sorry, I just won’t do it.”
His heart fell to the pit of his stomach. Did she know what he was doing? Could she tell? Or was he just that bad at pretending?
He remembered strategies and protocols being drilled into their brains. Drawn up plans of action, and veteran aurors telling us why each was successful or a failure. How life seemed to be looking up for him, that his future seemed to be coming up and it was.
Harry nodded, lying.
Harry sighed, then nodded.
Harry pet Neville’s shoulder, and reached out for a handful of floo powder. Just before he could grab it though, Neville spoke with a firm voice.
Harry gave a half hearted smile and nodded. “You can try.”
“By the way,” Hagrid started. “I know yer memory is gone an’ all, but being with the hippogriffs didn’t help or nothin’?”
Malfoy gestured for Harry to eat. Harry picked up one of the disposable bowls and a plastic spork and started grabbing a bit of each food. The smell of each dish was amazing alone, but together it was intoxicating.
Pansy’s anger came in waves. She pushed and pulled the conversation, one moment she seemed to hold composure, the next it was crashing.
Malfoy jokingly punched him, and said a soft, “Sod off.”
You’d think after so much of his life, even excluding the part he couldn’t remember, he would be used to magic now. But no. Instead his childhood-enemy-from-years-ago-turned-good-who-somehow-became-his-lover-that-he-couldn’t-remember had to remind him of its existence. Feeling the tips of his ears grow red, he pulled out his wand and cast a tempus.
a part of Harry thought.
“I’m alright, I guess. At least, much better than before. Thank you…” He trailed off, raising the final note in a question for her name.
Just as they sat, a waitress came through, a bright smile on her face.
“Because we are not friends anymore, Potter. What’s the last thing you remember of me, hm? Of us?” Parkinson hissed.
“The entire Weasley family minus Bill and Charlie, Luna, Hermione…”
“Last I heard from her, she was good.” Malfoy sighed. “I forgot you didn’t know. She’s living in France now, and is living her life. We… um. We don’t talk as much as we used to, but when something happens, we send owls. I just thought the worst when I saw the owl, I apologise for not thinking.”
But nothing came.
Before Harry could begin fidgeting, realising how empty his hand might feel, Nott spoke to him.
“Hello, Harry Potter! Did something happen?”
d it all. His heart felt lighter as he watched it burn.
Harry didn’t realise how much had changed in the Headmaster’s office. Dumbledore’s portrait was still there, just behind the desk as it was 5 years ago. But Phineas and all the others had moved to different walls. The pensieve cabinet was nowhere to be seen. Even the desk itself seemed to be a different one, a darker more sophisticated wood.
“You’re a good friend that is loyal and trustworthy. You’ve stared death in the eye and walked back. You’re brave and kind. You love with all your heart. You’re great at Quidditch, played seeker on the Gryffindor team in Hogwarts. You were there at Ginny and Luna’s wedding. You were there at every birthday party held for your friends.”
“Malfoy,” He started slowly. “What happened back there?”
It was too much. There was too much here. Why did Harry think it was a good idea to come here knowing how much there was? How many memories did he forget? How could they possibly talk things over when it held so much emotion?
Harry didn’t remember thinking about it at all actually. Things were still way too new, and he was still getting used to this Malfoy as his friend as opposed to the Malfoy from Hogwarts that was his rival.
All too soon, the Three Broomsticks came into view, and two silhouettes were talking just in front of it.
One day, Tina told him he was lucky to be alive. Harry thought for one scary moment that maybe that would’ve been for the better. But when Ron and Hermione came in, holding 4 cups of hot coffee, and determined smiles on their faces, the thought crushed itself.
When he looked into the spare bedroom to find it empty, his heart fell. Harry peeked into his bedroom, and came up with nothing there either. Malfoy's office was shut tight, with Isolt and Malfoy inside. Harry didn’t need a big ‘No Entry’ sign to know he wasn’t welcome.
When Harry finally stepped back, bowing once more as a goodbye, Hace bowed back just as low. Harry turned, and Tatus was there with a tilted head. It reminded him of Isolt, and her curious eyes.
Maybe that sob was always there in his throat, waiting to come out. Maybe it just ripped out of him with no thought. Either way, Harry sobbed into his hands. Everything came crashing down onto him. All the things he did, the things he said.
“Of course!” Harry quickly jumped at making amends. “I just meant, it was a work incident, case files, the whole thingy, y’know?”
“You should just be comfortable,” Malfoy said, with a smile.
The handwriting, thankfully, was familiar. It was Neville’s handwriting. But how on earth Neville had gotten an eagle owl was beyond him.
Soon enough, Malfoy swept through with a stack of pancakes. The ones on the top looked glorious, but the ones at the bottom looked ridiculous. He told Malfoy this, hoping to release whatever tension was still there.
A wave of students entered, walking past him in bouts of laughter that reminded him of his friendship group in their Hogwarts years. Nostalgia settled in his chest as he shook himself out of the trance.
Harry buried his head into his hands after he maneuvered to sit on the floor. He couldn’t bare to look at Malfoy as he told him everything.
“You’re… going back to work?” Malfoy asked carefully.
Malfoy was the first to move. Like the world decided to put them out of their misery and press the play button. He turned around, back facing Harry.
The house was better than he thought it would be.
Malfoy laughed out a sigh. “I support you, Harry. You know that.” A pause. “It might not seem like it now, but just know I do support you.”
Pretty much everyone groaned at that. Harry was pretty sure he heard Ron say, “And that’s why I wanted whiskey.”
After all, these were his friends.
She nodded, her smile gone. “I never paid much attention to it, just did what needed to be done. I thought it was an easy O since I passed my OWLs. But, it isn’t. It’s so much more intricate and complicated than I could have ever imagined.”
He spent hours reading through them, There weren’t that many, even for 5 years. It seemed he’d fall off and forget about the books for weeks, even months, until he started writing in them again. He understood, life seemed to be busy all the time.
It looked absolutely majestic.
She kept eye-level with him, and the pit that was forming in Harry’s gut became bigger. And as Tina told Harry what had happened to him, the pit grew so big he found himself falling into it.
Nott nodded. “Yeah, you disappeared for a while though, stuck in St Mungo’s. Not many people know your current condition, though, which is good.”
He didn’t realise just how thirsty he was, and downed the glass before Neville could even start his reply.
He quickly got ready, changing into some decent clothes that hadn’t been slept in for hours on end. He ran down the stairs, and drank a tall glass of water.
Harry looked between them, mind racing as to why they just put a
“...And Beauty and the prince lived happily ever after.” Harry said, as he closed the book.
“It’s the only thing that’s making me feel like I’m doing something while my memories are still missing!” Harry’s volume rose, desperation seeping into his words.
“Not everyone is here, but we’re all here with you every step of the way. We’re here to help. It’s a shitty situation but, y’know, we can handle it.” Ron smiled and jokingly punched Harry’s arm.
Malfoy scanned him for a moment, then answered. “Yes, but I believe you already knew that. You were busy in your office, I assume you saw some of the articles about it…”
, then maybe he wouldn’t have the first instinct to run.
Harry said his goodbye’s to Goyle and Nott, and thanked them for letting him join them on what he realised was a date night. Goyle just said it was fine while Nott, slightly slurred words and a lot more confidence than Nott could ever need, told him not to do it again since this was a freebie and ‘you lost the memories of us, how dare you?’
“Wow, that’s so,” He struggled to find the right words. “I’m happy for you.”
“You didn’t miss much, Pans. We did make fun of Ron with Celestina.” Blaise told her, a distant smile. As if the memory of that night was too good to be true,
Despite his face being mostly covered in hair, Harry could still see Hagrid’s cheek redden. “Thank you.”
Malfoy blinked, then lowered his wand. Harry caught Malfoy’s slightly clenched jaw, and knew the question before it was even going to be asked.
i'm back to writing though! :) I do want this story finished as it means a lot to me
So he packed them neatly in the boxes, and kept them in the corner that Malfoy chose before. There would be a time where they discuss those photographs, but it wouldn’t be today. Harry needed to be further along this healing before he could.
Malfoy’s hair was just as soft as he expected it to be. Harry’s fingers carded gently through Malfoy’s hair, he watched as each hair fell gently, as if each strand was afraid it would make a sound.
I'll delete this note when the next chapter 'Love (Part 2)' is uploaded
Through and through there were inconsistencies and confusion. The only definite was that she was missing, and to this day, no traces, magical or not, have been found to close the case.
They both shook their heads. “Harry… You don’t live alone.”
He just needed a break, just one day of no plans or interactions.
“How are you so calm about this entire situation,
“Yeah, how could I forget?” Harry lied through his teeth.
Grabbing a pen, avoiding the quills covered in dry ink, he wrote his reply. He let Malfoy know he’d be down in half an hour. Isolt’s feet tippy-tapped along his desk as he wrote, her excitement could be felt from miles away. He’d only just got the letter tired around her ankle when she shot off through the window.
Harry turned to look at Goyle, whose hands were in his pockets and seemed to shift his weight from one foot to the other. He was probably as uncomfortable as Harry felt, but he stuck his hand out for Goyle to shake, and put on a welcoming smile.
Malfoy took a deep breath in. He steadied himself and stepped a little closer to Harry. “Harry, listen to me. You
“Actually, don’t tell me. It’ll just make me more angry at you.” Her voice started to decrease in volume and power. Harry took a breather while bracing himself for the next wave. “None of your memories have actually come back, have they?”
Sometimes, things will get worse before they get better. Harry knows this. He's lived it and lost it.
Harry laughed at that. A long time ago, he would’ve hated it, but Malfoy’s been lighter on the jokes. In fact, he was genuinely funny and had a good sense of humour once you figured it out.
Malfoy opened the spare bedroom door, and walked in.
Harry clenched his eyes shut, trying so hard to remember something. Anything. Please. But nothing came but the history the two shared in Hogwarts. Nothing but the cold communication during his trials. Nothing but snide remarks and petty fighting in 8th year. Nothing. Nothing that could somehow twist into affection for Malfoy.
Things are difficult for Harry. Words slowly disappear, and the journey for memories is covered in shards of glass. Harry's in this situation because of one bad move, so how long does it take until he realises he's made another? Here's part 1 of the second chapter.
“You could probably cook better.” Malfoy replied offhandedly.
Harry’s head turned when an uproar of cheers took the attention of the majority of the people. His heart ached when he saw Ron there, laughing around with the rest of the auror friend’s they’ve both made along the way.
“I just want that life again,” Harry whispered quietly.
Malfoy looked up, and smiled at Harry. It wasn’t a genuine smile per say, but it wasn’t malicious either. The closest thing he could say was that it was polite. He began to open up the array of takeout containers, and the smell of a mix of spices filled the room.
They spoke one day about the birthday party where Malfoy got burnt, and Harry slipped up. He got a fact wrong, and they looked at him oddly, but Harry quickly recovered.
“Takeaway, please,” Lavender answered for him.
Harry told Malfoy about the people who knew about his performing act. From Teddy to Kingsley, Neville to Pansy and Blaise. How each one of them chewed him out, finding his plans unnecessary.
“The pancakes will be ready soon, just…” Malfoy waved his hand, like he was shooing Harry away. “Do something.”
Once out of the weird trance, Harry cast a tempus. Fuck, they had to leave soon. Harry quickled got changed and ready.
“That you’re both good friends to Draco.” Harry dropped the name to see their reaction.
“You just look a bit tired, that’s all. Anyway, I’ve got to go now. Want some tea to go? It’ll be on me.” She winked as she got up.
“Oh I bet,” Harry continued, wondering if this was still pushing his luck. “Draco complained about the sand for weeks afterwards. Add that onto his sunburn, and it was quite intense.”
“We’re not going to fucking leave you,
It was Teddy.
“And that’s how…”
Malfoy’s days off were not on a preplanned day, instead it was chosen in line with his levels of stress. “I can’t afford a day off in the week,” He told Harry one day. “So I’ll choose the day myself, for when I really need it.”
Both Harry and Isolt jump. Isolt spreads her wings to regain balance but they smack Harry’s face. As soft as the feathers are, they do not taste very nice.
“Why don’t I remember?” His voice was sharp and accusing. It was all directed to himself. “Damn it, Harry. Remember
When Andromeda started on her chores, leaving Harry to watch over Teddy, he couldn’t help but celebrate for a moment. He’d done it, he’d pretended again and it was completely successful. He could have that life back, the one that still seems so out of reach for who he is now. He could take it back, even if it isn’t real, he could pretend it was. At least for a second.
Lara came over once she had enough time to sit down for a chat. Despite seeing her at least 2 times already, he never really got a proper look at her. Both from the overwhelming newness of the situation and the fear that he’d have to explain his condition to someone who didn’t already know.
Harry got as far as passing the wards before he realised he didn’t know where they were going. He turned back and waited for Malfoy who was, for some reason, locking the door with an actual key.
Still, he followed on, trying to quell the hint of uncertainty and frustration bubbling slowly in his chest.
Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were not dating, but seemed to be very close. They got along with so many people, easy smiles and cheering of glasses shone through every photo they were in. It was incredible.
Wrong.
“He’s doing very well, considering how long he was asleep,” Tina said, flipping her notes. “I was most concerned when he got hit in the abdomen during the duel, but he took it as well as a healthy patient normally would.”
On the other hand, nothing came back when he went through it all. The goal he wanted to achieve was not completed, and despite thoroughly enjoying the journey, the destination was nowhere in sight.
It was refreshing. The Malfoy in charge of the apothecary was different from the Malfoy at home. This one was more of how he was in school. The flattery, the coolness, even to the point he would deal with rude customers with a subtle harshness and authority.
Harry was thankful Malfoy did that. He wasn’t sure if he’d be able to handle a party at the Burrow so soon, but two weeks was manageable. He could do something, maybe get a few memories by then.
Mixed emotions flooded through Harry, just as it always did when it came to the new Malfoy. Well maybe not new, just unknown. The unknown Malfoy of the past 5 years. This letter wasn’t anything like he thought Malfoy would write. It was informal and domestic and not at all what he’d expect.
He’s had enough. He physically felt the thread holding in his pent up anger break.
“Oh, that. Well, we do a lot of demonstrations for the duelling club,” Neville said nonchalantly. “The students love it, and it really helps.”
