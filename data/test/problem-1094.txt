Draco places his hand on Harry’s shoulder and feels his heart break when Harry flinches and throws himself away from Draco. He crawls into the corner of the room whimpering. He keeps whispering things like, ‘Please don’t hurt me. Please. I’m sorry sir. I’ll be good I promise.’ Draco wants to cry. How could someone do this to the most beautiful person ever?
Patronus.
The rest of the people submerged their faces and watched the memories play.
I sigh dreamily at him as he bristles at my words. He is so cute when he's angry.
He padded around in the dark trying to a light switch but then remembered. His wand! He silently accioed his wand and waited for it to smack into his hand. When his wand arrived, he cast a silent lumos and screamed when the room lit up. There they were; the Malfoy's, Tom and Snape sitting on chairs, well slumping in Draco's case, wide awake looking like they were scared shitless. Harry was breathing so hard and he had almost pissed himself with fright. He heard Draco giggle slightly before muffling it. He glared in his direction.
Draco got no warning before he was picked up effortlessly by Harry and carried bridal style into Hogwarts. Harry navigated them through the empty castle to the eighth year common room brushing off anyone who tried to talk to him.
"THAT'S IT!" he yells.
I'm not sure
"Yes. That." I spat at it. She shrieked and hopped away, laughing as she went. "Dray!"
Gasps from the students and staff surrounding them dragged Draco’s attention to them and he flushed pink before putting his mask back on. He turned to Ron and said, “Piss of Weasel. You’re not wanted here.”
"Harry! What's wrong?" My gorgeous Angel looked up at me with tears streaming down her face. "I- It's so beautiful Draco. How- how did you pay for all this? It must have been expensive!" She was whispering but she looked so happy!
Potter and Malfoy.
I heard two giggles from behind me where Pansy and Granger were. I ignored them and decided to reply to Potter with a witty comment.
I sigh. I hate potato soup. Why do I eat this again?
Harry nodded in agreement before looking around and meeting my gaze. He blushed then looked away.
"Oh and Harry, if you don't come back after 15 minutes, I expect to see you and Malfoy snogging in the entrance to the Great Hall at breakfast. That means you are dating. I'll let the others know alright?" Neville grinned. Harry sighed, "Fine." "Good luck Golden Boy!!" Neville said and walked off.
I missed them.
I wish to discuss what I found in person, if that's okay. I have put too much in my letter and if someone were to intercept they would most likely go to Dumbledore. I have one more thing to tell you before I wrap up. Going back to my 'wellbeing' and my treatment worse than a house elf I wish to inform you of one more thing. If you couldn't tell by now, I am abused. They call me Freak and Boy. I don't know my real name till my Hogwarts letter. But it isn't just verbal. The physical abuse is serious. I will send a copy of my 'punishment chart' and the 'punishments' I have before I return. I don't think I will be able to get to Hogwarts in time and I suspect I will be unconscious for a day or two. Could you create a portkey for me? Please? It could just ditch me into the Infirmary at school so Poppy can treat me. If it is alright with you, of course, could you make it so that it activates itself after 2 days or something? It would be much appreciated if you can conform with my request.
"Harry, you just said that out loud."
"Harry, I dare you to go into Malfoy's room and kiss him on the lips. I bet he is asleep by now, but if he wakes up, you must tell him how you feel." Neville said mischievously. Harry groaned, "Oh Neville! Must I?" He looked at him pleadingly. Neville snickered and nodded. "But you were meant to be on my side!!" Harry complained. "Eh, well off you go!!" Neville shooed Harry out into the hallway.
"Harry Potter – The Boy Who Gayed – Single Pringle." Draco breathed. "Have you read mine?" He asked Harry in a whisper. "No." Harry replied softly.
"Okay Pansy. So, my plain black skirt that goes half way down my thighs, skin coloured tights.... hmmm what shirt...." I started to mumble to myself. I am now starting to show signs of madness. Fuck.
Draco slumped with relief before grinning hesitantly at the Saviour under his wet fringe. "Cool. That sounds great! I'll owl...?"
"Who are you married to?"
"PANSY! PANSY! PANSY!!"
Harry had blurted it out on the 3rd meet by accident. They were talking about relationships (somehow) and Harry had just said it. Draco was furious. Harry had to take him outside and calm him down before his magic went mental and they would have to obliviate any muggles.
"Gods I love you Draco." Harry whispered.
"I know Harry's gay name."
He felt a rush of blood rise to his face and tried to ignore the boy on top of him, closing his eyes in exasperation.
"Malfoy-Potter!"
He swallowed before turning around and looking at his human octopus. Harry. Bloody. Potter.
“Nope.”
To top it all off, when he went to the staff room, THERE WERE NO BISCUITS!
"Only if you use my proper name, outloud, so everyone can hear." He gestures to the hall, especially Granger, who is now out of her seat tiptoeing over.
"Harry, I don't know how, but I have somehow got stuck in my shirt. Could you, could you help me please?" he asked, blushing but Harry couldn't see thankfully. Harry barked a laugh and shrugged his shoulders. "Sure!" He walked over, telling himself to behave and not do anything stupid and placed his hands on Draco's shirt. He started to lift his shirt up almost pulling it back over his head so he could detangle it when the door opened and a shout of "BOYS!" tore them apart.
things and they take even longer when dealing with these types of customers. The two husband's sniggered at the sight.
Oops?
Ginny looks at me, “Harry? Wanna go?”
Ginny was seething. "What about me?" "I broke up with you. Didn't you get the owl?"
"Fucking my boyfriend" he snarled at her.
"2..."
"What are you doing here?" Draco asked suspiciously.
Draco looked back up, "What are you doing in my room Potter?" Harry smiled sheepishly, "We were playing truth or dare in my dorm, and I was dared to co-"
The other person giggled, “I can’t wait!”
"Oh shut up Draco."  Harry laughed as Draco started walking away from their friends with his treasure hanging from his shoulder.
"Boyfriend?" She shrieked. "When did this happen may I ask?" She demanded.
Harry chuckled and kissed him sweetly, holding him tightly in his arms. "I have you, and I am never letting you go. Okay?"
Harry smiles softly watching Draco as he sleeps, tracing his facial features with his eyes watching him breathe deeply. It is so warm and Harry never wants to leave. He wants to wake up like this every day for the rest of his life. He blushes slightly at the thought. That is when molten silver eyes meet his emerald green ones. ‘Harry,’ Draco sighs, ‘Did no one ever tell you it’s rude to stare?’ Harry blushes more and looks away. Draco chuckles and tips Harry’s head back to him, forcing eye contact. ‘I don’t mind.’ He says. ‘I’m only teasing.’ Draco smiles at him making harry giggle and Draco melts. He pulls harry even closer and harry does not complain, just snuggles into Draco and relaxes. Draco grins at feeling Harry snuggle into him more. Maybe he likes him back. He gives a content sigh.
“Get out of my way ferret.” Ron sneered as he fought his way through the crowd to get to his charm’s class.
Stepping over him, I said, “Draco chose me, you chose me. Let it be known that I choose Draco.” And with that, I threw myself back into Draco’s arms. “And I accept you harry.”  Draco whispered into my ears.
Thursday I cried when I got my next gift. It was this:
Six Gryffindors were inside Harry's dorm playing truth or dare. They hadn't been able to spend much time with one another for ages as school was piling up, but they settled into their old ways of joking and laughing quickly. The Golden Trio, Neville and the gayest couple in Hogwarts – Deamus as Luna named them – were sitting in a circle with their flags on their shoulders. Harry's was silver with the words Harry Potter – The Boy Who Gayed – Single Pringle in a black thread. Dean's had the writing Dean Thomas – Gay 1 - #No.2 Deamus Shipper in white thread on a purple background. His boyfriends, was Seamus Finnegan – Gay 2 - #No.1 Deamus Shipper in a purple thread on a white background. They had an argument about who was the first shipper of themselves and eventually came to an agreement that Seamus could be the first shipper only if Dean could be Gay 1.
Harry stops retching and is okay but Draco keeps holding him. As Harry had just been beaten, he did not have enough time to put on a glamour. Narcissa gasps as she sees the damage and starts to rush forward. Harry flinches and she looks horrified at herself. Draco just pulls harry onto his lap in the middle of the freaking Amazon Rainforest and cuddles him close, hands brushing calmly down his arms and sides, whispering sweet nothings into his ear. Clutching him close to him. Nothing will ever make him let go of this boy, not when he finally has him in his arms.
Burnt: 50 lashes
Harry just laughed. The Slytherin had stopped running and was now panting slightly, face red. Harry was not too sure if his face was red from exertion or the slap...
Total times: 108 times
I am at the lake waiting for her to show up. I wonder if she will...
"Okay, so Dray. It is snowing today, so you want something that is warm but shouts cute and formal. Just because you're trying to impress a half blood doesnt mean you lower your standards." Pansy teased me. Pansy, fucking, teased me. Its only 6 AM! It's too early for this shit. Why did I get up again?
It was a routine he liked. He liked to imagine what they would be doing with their lives if they were alive. Would they have pets? A family? What career did they want to chase? It made him sad, but he felt it was the least he could do for them. Who else was to remember them?
Wassup guys. 8th chapter is out. Woo! Dumbledore is a creature, can you guess what? There will be more hints later, but for now, I would love to see your ideas. Comments make me smile so :-)
Lucius looked at his son, proud that he found his soulmate. He looked back down to the abusive muggle on the floor. He spat in his face.
There is so much to do! And I hope it is all worth it in the end.
This is the day I wish for us to meet. Is that okay with you?
It was a wet Wednesday and the storm had come a few days earlier than people suspected. Harry had to move all his flowers inside less they get destroyed by the wind and hail. He was watering the last of his flowers when the door slammed open with a gust of wind and a sopping wet person stepped through. They pushed down their hood. Harry gasped when he saw Draco. Tall, slim, muscular (he could tell because his shirt was stuck to his skin) and unfairly handsome. No one except Hermione and Harry knew of Harry's sexual orientation. He was Bisexual and right now his gay was definitely showing.
"Nothing." Snarls Draco a thunderous expression on his face. "You did nothing wrong Harry, nothing. You hear me? It wasn't your fault."
Narcissa cooed whilst looking at them all sappy-like, basically melting at the cute moment. "They are so head over heels for each other and they don't even realise it. I bet when we tell them they will be even closer and even cuter. I don't think I could stand it!" She squealed the last bit quite loudly gaining the teens attentions. Harry's blush which had started to fade came back full force and started to fidget but Draco pulled him close and kissed him on the head again making Harry blush even darker and Draco finally realised what he did. He made a sort of strangled noise and flushed even darker than Harry, making the adults laugh at him.
“Grandma told me about you,” Teddy said, his voice barely a whisper.
Honestly, this is enough food to keep them sated for days. And yet… there’s one tiny thing missing.
Draco bites his lip. “I want to,” he whispers. A part of him is still worried Potter will change his mind, that he’s still confused and doesn’t really know what he wants.
“He talked to you?” Granger asks.
“I’m an Auror, Potter, not a porcelain doll,” Draco snaps, willing his teeth to stop clattering.
“Talking to yourself, Potter?”
“Okay, one voice.” Potter exhales loudly. “But you didn’t feel it? The anger?”
“Same as every year,” Potter said, as if Draco was supposed to know what that meant. Of course, Draco did know.
“Thanks, guys,” he murmured, burying his face in their mingled hair.
“Sadly, no.”
“And in these moments, he feels… gleeful. I just can’t imagine how someone can feel like that while they’re— It makes me sick.”
“That’s only speculation though,” Draco remarks. “He could have gone to the Quidditch pitch, the castle, Hogsmeade—”
Draco raised his chin, but a small smile started to form on his lips.
“You don’t like going to events like that,” Draco pointed out.
“Save it,” Draco said weakly. “You always hated him. You—” He broke off when he felt warm fingers on the back of his hand. Potter was hesitant at first, his fingers lightly ghosting over Draco’s skin. But then he pressed his palm against Draco’s hand and brushed his thumb against his wrist.
hadn’t brought it up.” He pushed his hip forward to prove what thinking of the blond did to him. He felt the same thrill he felt when he fought with Draco now when he thought of all the possibilities he faced with him. It was still a rather new idea, liking boys, but he wanted to explore it further. And who else to explore it with then the boy who always gave him a reaction?
”This is wrong. I can’t. You’re the bloody saviour! I’m scum. You can’t expect people to accept this? Just don’t do this. Please. You’ll just keep me as your secret and then you’re going to go back to your perfect life with the Weasle and- I was fine before you cam, Potter.” He sneered, a tear rolled down his chin.
“What is it Ms. Jordan?” He sighed.
The first time Harry had seen Hermione drunk, he had discovered a completely different side of his best friend. It was fun to see everyone of his friends have fun after everything that had happened in his past years. These Saturday night bath parties were a way for him to let go for a while.
They kept up their fights, much to Hermione’s dismay, yet now it was recognized as playful arguments. It was their way of communicating. They also kept up their newfound sexual agreement. Harry passed notes in class, all saying the same kind of message. Where, when. Draco’s were much more vague. Things like:
The large oak door that lead to the common room was at the far end of the school near the lake. The spell work that had gone into making the new dorms was rather impressive and every detail of the place had been carefully thought about in order to make the place feel like home to all it’s students. There weren’t any walls in the common room, strange as that may seem, however, the floor was a pale polished wood that contrasted nicely with the dark cabinets and couches in the lounge area. Where the walls should have been, there were powerful architectural charms (that could be compared to large windows) that one could put a hand through without disturbing the magic or meeting any resistance. This made for a truly amazing sight, for on the three walls other than the door’s, you could see straight out onto the grounds of the castle. The first floor was partly below ground level and at this particular spot, the lake reached the edges of the castle and surrounded their common room. The magical barriers prevented the lake’s water from coming through. Half of the view was split horizontally by the waters surface and at such a depth, the water looked a wonderful shade of turquoise. For the first time in most of the young student’s lives, they could see the giant squid look at them as well as many other magical lake creatures and plants.
Tonight, it was to be a game of magical truth or dare. Two options were given to a student. The first a dare and the second a truth or vice versa depending on which was chosen first. If you refused to do the first, a force, not unlike veritaserum or an imperius curse did, forced you to do the second. There were two rules: nothing physically harmful and if you worded it wrong, too bad for you.

. What perversions? Truly the one Malfoy heir couldn’t be scared of that. Harry needed to know why.
”I don’t care what people think. I want you. I don’t want Ginny. I don’t care if we make the front page of the P
would he’d his bullocks. In truth, Draco had been the only person he’d ever gotten that close with other than Ginny, and she wasn’t in the room.
Boggart-Lucius covered his practically uncovered goods and squeaked. His evil glare made him look like an angry puppy and Harry laughed. Partly because he was relieved that the situation had been taken care of and that nothing bad was going to happen in the castle. The fear that had taken refuge inside him when he’d heard of the intruder in the castle disappeared with every exhale. He laughed at the whole situation. To think he’d thought his colleague was up to something like he’d been in their youth. To think that as student he’d always thought wasn’t capable of causing harm to a single soul had escorted him like a badass bodyguard.
the one who left love bites down my neck.” He smacked his arms against the surface of the water and foam flew and landed on the blond head in front of him. He bit back a grin. Draco looked so cute like this, even if he was angry, “Look, I really wouldn’t mind being your friend, Mal-Draco. To call a truce? To be honest you’re the one of the few who sees me for me. I need someone like that. Of course, if you want to pretend that you still hate me and that you don’t deserve friendship well screw you.”
A grindylow started back at Harry, who was looking out of the common room for lack of anything better to do. Quidditch used to be a fun discussion topic for him but recently it just aggravated his frustration. He couldn’t play. And friendly games on the weekend weren’t enough to satisfy his need for competition. He turned his attention back to the conversation when he heard a sharp voice cut in.
“I’m not the one who started that this morning. You made me
The conversation was, as per usual, centred on the upcoming quidditch match. Although they weren’t allowed to play this year, Ron had discovered that it was much, much funnier to discuss quidditch when members of the opposing houses were present and involved in some friendly bets. Pansy Parkinson had surprised everyone by winning almost every bet she placed so far.
Harry made his way back to his classroom as he thought over recent events once more. He’d only seen Draco crying like that three other times. The first time had been in sixth year, an event that hadn’t ended well. The second had been when Draco was inches away from death in the room of requirement. The third time was after Voldemort died. Draco had been found by Harry thanks to the Marauder’s map. Narcissa had been looking for him in the rubble and was starting to suspect the worst when Harry spotted his floating name up in the astronomy tower. He’d been crying for hours even after the news of Voldemort’s defeat. Harry had left before Draco had looked up from his knees to cry into his mother’s chest. This fourth time hadn’t been the same. They weren’t fighting on opposite sides of a war. This was more personal. The boggart has been his father. What had be been so afraid of? It wasn’t the presence of his father, Draco had never shown any fear at the mention of his name and Harry would know if he was afraid. It was something about what he’d said.
Draco had a dorm to himself as none of his friends came back, and anyway, no one wanted to share a dorm with a Death Eater in case they were murdered in their sleep. It was a small room, with 2 beds. He used one for sleeping and the other as a chill type couch. He had a dark wood desk and a massive window looking out over the quidditch pitch. The Slytherin found it slightly strange being in a tower instead of being in the dungeons but he felt he was adjusting quite well.
I got dressed as she replied. "Although my mum was called Lily, Father always bought her roses. They were her favourites, especially red ones. When I was born everything I owned had a rose on it. All my shirts, onesies, pyjamas, bibs, bedding, towels- everything you name it, had at least a rose on. When I am 18 I'm thinking of changing or adding rose to my middle name or surname. I'm not sure which yet."
"What took so long Freak? Who's at the door? More of your freaky friends?" The voice thundered before a slap was heard. Draco fumed, how dare he hit Harry! He burst through the door, wand held pointing at Vernon. "I was right." Vernon said. "It was one of your freaky friends. You cant do magic outside of school; didn't think I knew that did you!?" he snickered.
"Pansy!" I whined. "You can't replace me! I thought I was your only best friend!" She giggled a little before wrapping her right arm around my shoulders. I scowled at the chain of metal around her neck as she came closer. "You will
Pansy gasped. "No way! Draco told me his earlier."
WAIT.
Blaise decided to pipe in. "Draco, seriously. Start your plan today. Or at least buy everything you need and then start it but please. I beg you. Just make sure you're snogging each other by the end of next week."
The train ride was uneventful to say the least. He sat with the Slytherins but didn't speak. He just looked out the window and mostly ignored them. Harry could feel all the stares on him so he turned his head and met every single pair of eyes with his cold, emotionless ones. The Slytherins all blanched and quickly found something else to look at. The one person who didn't was Draco; he had a curious look on his face and wasn't afraid of meeting Harry's eyes. Harry looked back out of the window and let Draco ponder.
"Oh don't worry darling. I am pretty sure my
"Really."
“It’s because I love him!”
No more hiding.
“What do you want Malfoy.” Ginny says rising up to face him, falling into a defensive stance, wand out. “Oh nothing, just Harry here.” I raise my eyebrow at him. He raises one right back and smiles softly. Softly. Draco fucking Malfoy just softly smiled at me. What? Why?? He chuckled at my obvious confusion (quite fondly I’ll have you know). My heart is doing somersaults (not sure why. I admit it though; he is kinda cute and very handsome. Shhh!!) whereas my brain is thinking this is so suspicious. Ginny grabs my arm and pulls me towards her. Apparently, I had taken a step forward without realising. I snatched my arm back and glared at her. She snarled at me and so I growled back, telling her to back off. She grimaced and with her nose high in the air, she turned on her heel and stalked out the room.
"I want to claim you." Draco said bluntly, eyes scanning Harry for his reaction. He could hear the adults spluttering over by the door but was entranced by the emotions passing across Harry's beautiful face. Harry had spaced out a little, blush still prominent, lips parted slightly, staring at Draco with an unknown emotion. Draco raised an eyebrow, the movement breaking Harry out of his trance with a jolt and he scrambled away from Draco, putting his head in his hands trying to calm his racing heart. Draco felt hurt but forced his mask up hiding his emotions not wanting to look stupid and heartbroken.
Harry’s hand was moving swiftly up and down his length and his thumb was sliding over the tip. It felt
”I thought you were my friend?” Harry grumbled. He could feel the tug of magic urging him to answer the question. The answer to which he couldn’t say or
”Do you want to be seen or not? Thought so. Come on let’s go.”
Needless to say, Harry went to bed in a grumpy mood that evening. Hermione had been trying to set him up with a few witches, but he just wasn’t interested in any of them. Sure they were nice, but Harry wanted what she and Ron had. “Bonds like the one Ron and I have didn’t form on the first date, Harry.” She’d told him countless times that if he just put in the effort and the time, he would find someone. He just didn’t have the time. He was fine, he was happy, even.
”Alright, who in this room,” he looked around and gave pointed looks at the Patil twins and Cho who sat near Hermione, “have you shagged? That’s for the truth. If you don’t answer this, you have to take off your bathing suit.”
Harry coughed and looked at the healer, “Could you enlarge the bed, please?” And then feeling the need to explain he continued, “I’ve got the bedside digging into my back”
————————————————
After that, it was soon known around the school that Harry Potter had called a truce with Draco Malfoy. Nobody knew how long it would last but no one knew that it would last as long as it did. In fact it lasted more than a month before it turned into a real friendship and not a cessez-le-feu.
“You’ve really scared the students there, professor.”
He decided to stop thinking of such things. He turned onto his side and faced the warm flames of the fire across the room. He wondered what the boggart would have shown him had he stepped in front of Draco earlier. Voldemort, death, small cupboards, maybe. Loneliness? His thoughts all swirled back to his previous problem. With a start he sat up in bed and summoned a sleeping draught he’d gotten from George. The speed at which his brain was spewing ideas about dying alone and never finding someone to share a home with was enough to make him dizzy and he quickly downed the potion. He felt his fingers tingle and his thoughts trickled to a stop.
”I thought my sister was your first!” Ron slurred.
”Did you feel his dong, Harry? Was it teeny? Or was it big like his ego?” They giggled at each other before Harry replied that he simply did not know. Their smiles wiped off their pace, they pouted, “You're no fun.”
“I’m sure they weren’t the ones who suffered the most here.” His tone was cold. His smile had disappeared.
”No. This isn’t. I never agreed to this. I
”It’s not funny, Harry!” He said in such a pitoyable tone that it reminded Harry of a younger Neville. But even Neville smiled after a while and Draco was hiding a smirk in his book.
over and over. That’s when Peeves decided to join the party.
“You keep hangover cure in the bathroom?” He downed it in one go as Harry did the same. He took the empty vial back and vanished it. Draco felt the hum of Harry’s magic surround him and his eyes widened at the sheer power he felt.
Both boys looked around bewildered. Peeves cackled and twirled around the pair yelling, “Oh no! Oopsie! Potty is stuck to a ferret! Potty is stuck to a ferret!”
When he got back to the common room, most of the eighth years were lounged in the common room. The others had been washing up before their day at Hogsmead.
They thanked the professors and Draco sneered at Peeves before returning to their common room, where they were accosted by thousands of questions. Neville looked like he felt sorry for Harry, but he was the only one who did.
Harry was still grinning when he turned to Hermione, who had a clear look of disapproval spread across her face. “What?”
“I may have to thank you, Alyssa, for saving me from the repetitive task of correcting work.” He grinned, “Come sit.”
He was a stubborn prick! He was a git! He was a
”What?” Harry asked, confused.
“I heard students talking about a fight between you and Malfoy?”
“I’m jealous of that squid, to be honest.” One Ravenclaw boy had said during one of the following meals, “If I had a chance to get a piece of
“Oh! This is my best work yet!” He claimed, as he admired the two boys in front of him, “Enemies, forced to stick together. How tragic!” He said dreamily.
“Well, I think there is a certain kind of healer that you may have overlooked.” He stood and went to rummage through his desk, “I’ve read an article about a new decision of healer that specializes in emergency cases like in the muggle world. I can’t seem to find it. Regardless, these healers go to different places to help aurors bring gravely injured people into their care. You would get a lot of field work, like an auror, without working with criminals and helping those in need. I think it would be a good fit for you, Ms. Jordan.” He looked at her and smirked, “If I’d known you could be so good at handling emergency situations like before, I would have thought of this earlier.”
About thirty more awkward steps down the corridor, Harry shook as he gave the password and lead them to the secret staircase behind the portrait of the fat horse (what was with Hogwarts’ love for well fed beings anyway?) and the portrait closed behind them, but when they tried to go up the first step, Draco slipped. Harry reached for the railing to steady himself as the blond struggled for purchase, the tight squeeze of his hand on Harry’s elbow now moved lower to grab at his bum, essentially pulling their hips even closer together. Draco couldn’t prevent the moaned curse from escaping his lips and the green-eyed boy thought he’d never heard a sound as amazing as that. Harry’s head fell down onto the pale shoulder in front of him and through his lust-filled haze, he registered Draco pulling him closer and slowly rolling his hips against him.
started it, Malfoy and
The stairs that lead to the common rooms were in each corner of the room nearest the castle. On the right side, the black metallic spiral staircases lead to the boys’ dormitory and on the left, the girls’. The dormitories weren’t above the common room but rather on each side of it in order to let the natural sunlight illuminate it. The dorms looked like their old ones, but now the beds weren’t all those of the same house.
“Honestly! You two couldn’t be more immature.” Hermione reprimanded.
When they arrived, Alyssa lead the professor to the back of the class, still pushing and shoving through the panic-struck crowd that was standing near the door of the potions office. Harry nodded at students, apologizing on behalf of  the young girl and reassuring everyone that it would be fine. His words sounded clear, calm, and true, but a great observer wouldn’t fail to notice the slight shake of his hand and the uneasy look in his green eyes.
”I just feel this truce with Malfoy wont last long if you keep fighting with him. At some point you’re going to say something wrong and he’ll close himself off again. You’ve known him forever, Harry. You know how much of a stubborn prat he could be.”
After a long relaxing shower, Harry made his way back to the common room, now dressed in his pj’s and went directly to bed. He was far too tired to do anything but replay the day’s events in his head before falling asleep. He slept well, and dreamt he was flying above the lake but every time he tried to turn back to the castle, a shooting pain would spark at his side and he was forced to continue up and away from his home. When he woke up, however, he was not in his bed and his neck ached terribly. It was probably due to the fact that he was lying on the floor at the foot of his bed with his head pulled back at an odd angle by
“I’m sorry, Malfoy. I didn’t me—”
“We’re... um we’re going to have to move.” Draco nodded silently, not trusting his voice. They started moving very slowly toward the secret passage Harry knew lead to the infirmary. Draco’s hands gripped at Harry’s elbows and his mouth was a tight thin line as he tried desperately to control his breathing. Harry stepped forward urging Draco, who in any other situation, would be arguing and trying to be the one guiding them down the corridor, to back up a step. Draco was glad that for once he could just keep his bloody mouth shut and just follow.
“What was the boggart talking about?” Harry knew he shouldn’t have asked. Malfoy was going to kick him out.
They stood there for a few minutes, catching their breath and when Harry cast a silent cleaning charm over the two of them Draco tried to pull back suddenly. The reality of the situation hit him and he realized this was real. He’d just done that. He’d just jizzed his pants while grinding onto the saviour of the wizarding world. He was filled with a heavy sense of shame as he thought of what had just happened.
“That’s harsh, Zambini.” He thought for a moment. “I’m going to save whoever’s toe I would’ve suck by saying I’d shag the new defence professor. He’s the youngest one of the lot and I’m not shagging any old bags.” He looked around and pointed right at Harry.
”Oh, but I would!” He cackled and sent them floating across the bath toward each other glueing them together by their hips. Their very naked hips. Peeves popped out of the room after one last cackle and left the two boys to fend for themselves.
Harry hissed when Draco curled his fingers and stroked his prostate, “Fuck! Do that again. Do that again.” The fingers inside him stroked the same spot repeatedly and Harry praised every figure he knew, cursing and moaning at the intense pleasure. How could he have not tried this before?
”I don’t care,” Harry moaned into his ear as he pumped his member into the long slender fingers that were wrapped around it. He grabbed Draco’s free hand and moved it to his bum, encouraging him to
The whole world faded away as soon as it begun. Harry’s eyes scanned around the pitch for the snitch while he dodged the many bludgers coming his way. He was only vaguely aware of the crowd cheering and Seamus commenting as he was almost knocked off his broom by the ball. It had been almost twenty minutes of fierce competition when he spun on himself barely avoiding a bludger and caught a glimpse of a gold shimmer at the other end of the pitch. Right next to Malfoy, who was also dodging bludgers left and right.
”No! No, I’ll take the dare.” Harry said as he pointedly avoided Ron’s questioning stare. He promptly removed his trousers and swung them at Neville. “Anyway there’s so much foam it doesn’t really matter does it? Pansy. You’re turn. Truth or dare?”
”Quit it, Malfoy! I need to work more than you do. Just sit straight.” Malfoy didn’t cause any trouble after that but he did point out that Harry had just called him smart.
”Fat ass.” Malfoy grumbled under his breath. “Maybe we’d be able to get up if you didn’t stuff yourself of treacle tart everyday.”
That something revealed himself rather quickly when Harry tried to pull away. He raised his arm in front of his face and heard a hiss coming from behind him. His entire arm was stuck to a pale one and his cheek was also glued to someone else’s. That someone had rolled over in their sleep and pulled Harry back with him so his neck was strained.
”I didn’t do that!” He’d said as he looked at his hand. It wouldn’t budge when he’d tried to remove it. Harry had dragged Draco to Madam Pomfrey, kicking and screaming.
Harry wondered if they’d ever have a chance to put everything behind them. He wondered what could have happened if they’d called a truce and decided to work together rather than against. He’d often thought that they’d make a good team. They could read each other’s thoughts without trying and after so many years spent fighting, they knew each and every one of their triggers. Harry knew that Lucius was a difficult topic. He’d often used it to anger the blond. He knew he should just leave it be, but something was off about what he’d seen. Something new.
”Potter! You bloody fool! I had the snitch!” Malfoy all but wailed as he lunged forwards, jumping off his broom and tackling Harry to the ground a few feet below, where they started wrestling for the small snitch that fluttered helplessly in Harry’s tight sweaty fist.
”This is your fault, Malfoy. Don’t even try to deny it.” Harry said before he received a well-aimed snowball to the side of the head. The familiar thrill of fighting with Draco rushed through him and soon they were shoving snow down their coats and running down the road towards the shrieking shack. When they collapsed in the snow to catch their breath, Harry revealed that it had been him who had traumatized him in third year and they’d talked for a while about their adventures in their past school years.
”What’s this?” Draco asked, as Harry shut the door behind them. He looked at the all too romantic setting in front of him. A fireplace in the corner and a small table with plates and cutlery was in the center on a large soft-looking red carpet. A string quartet played through a speaker. Draco’s shoulders tensed, “I think the room messed up again.”
to lose. Seamus had taken the post of commentator and the bludgers had been expertly charmed by Hermione for the occasion.
Luna still refused to say which Slytherin had slithered into her panties and she and Pansy was trying to extract the information from at one end of the tub. If there not-subtle drunken manner was anything to go by, Harry guessed that Blaise was the mystery Slytherin and that Luna and Pansy were now sharing their experiences with him to each other. They giggled sometimes and said
“Maybe.” And Harry, who remembered how Draco had responded last time he’d said that smiled once more. They stopped eating after that to explore what Draco had suggested. A bed had conveniently appeared by the fire.
Of course, if they kept going, Harry would practically be frotting against him and any teenage boy knew that it was every harder to ignore
”It wasn’t the squid! I’ve told you, it was a girl. Why won’t anyone believe me?”
“You think I did good?” She looked slightly relieved, “Oh! I just felt so terrible when I was pushing everyone out of the way, but I knew it had to be done. Would that be useful, you think? A healer like you’ve described mist be able to escort people through crowds, I suppose. Oh! This gives me so many more possibilities! I will definitely look into it, professor Potter!” Without leaving any time for a response, the girl was bouncing out the door in a flurry of red-hair.
Something Harry didn’t know. Harry knew almost all there was to know about Draco Malfoy and he couldn’t help but be annoyed that there was something unknown to him.
”You’ve never been a death-eater, Draco. That mark on your arm says nothing about your character.” He kissed him again and this time the lips beneath his kissed him back. It was better than anything they’d done beforehand. When Harry had kissed Cho, she was crying and it was wet and awkward, but now with Draco it wasn’t awkward. It was passionate.
The conversation twisted into one about lessons and upcoming events. Harry stared across the hall at a young couple at the Ravenclaw table. The two were holding hands beneath the table and smiling at each other, reminding him what he’d missed out on in his youth.
But Draco had stopped moving. If Harry could pull back enough to see, he’d see a red flush creep over the pale skin of Draco’s face.
and ran for the door. Harry caught him by the wrist and pulled him back. “Why are you lying? Why won’t you let yourself be loved?”
Harry opened the door and let Draco in before he followed. He hoped the room had provided him with what he wanted. It still had trouble sometimes after the fiendfire.
He could here someone calling after him from across the hall as he speed-walked to his classroom. Already late for his next lesson, he could spare no time for the young girl who was most likely going to ask him about an upcoming homework or exam or quidditch match. He called over his shoulder, asking her to come after class when he wasn’t running around the school. Her calls just got more frantic, however, sounding more like the red phoenix he’d known in his earlier years than a student resident of Hogwarts.
The end!
He motioned for Alyssa to stay behind and crossed the threshold into the small office. It took a few moments for his mind to comprehend what exactly he was facing. Even after closing the door behind him to stop the curious gaze of the horde of students on the other side, he couldn’t comprehend just what he was looking at.
“You don’t love me. I’m disgusting. I’ve done horrible things. I’m just like my father. Just let me go!”
He’d felt it against his own but to have it in his palm was entirely different. He’d curiously moved his hand up and down the impressive length and Harry breath hitched, but he kept moving his own hand on Draco. He pulled them both under the hot stream of the shower.
”Malfoy?” His voice was tired and because his cheek magically bound to someone else’s, it sounded muffled.
“Well I’m glad, because Merlin knows I would have been the one to have to endure your constant complaining. I’ve had enough if your Malfoy obsession to last me a life time, I can only wonder how Ron must have felt back in school.”
was better than anything he’d ever done with any girl, despite de uncomfortable feeling. He turned around, Draco’s hand following him, and pushed back again onto the long finger inching it’s way into his arse.
keep this a secret.” He brushed a tear off the blond’s pale face, “Merlin! Hermione’s right. You are stubborn. You can’t see that you deserve love. You can’t admit that you like this just as much as I do and that you want more. You can’t accept that you’ve always been the most important part of my life. Even when I had a madman chasing me across the earth, I always thought about you. Worried about you! Even if I didn’t realize it, it always been you. You get me. You know exactly how to push my buttons. You know how I feel without me saying so how come you haven’t realized that I love you.”
”Harry, you do realize you’re glued to Malfoy again, don’t you?”
Harry walked over to where Draco stood fuming and pressed himself to his side, what could have been considered an inappropriate gesture had he not leaned in to whisper into the blond’s ear,
”No! I don’t want to.”
Unfortunately, something did happen. The boys barely had time to register Peeves’ approaching laughter before an orange light flashed. Malfoy, who did not seem at all phased by the poltergeist’s gleeful giggles, tried to roll over and straddle Harry to throw a punch. Fortunately (or unfortunately) for Harry, the blond boy couldn’t move from where he was lying next to him, long pale fingers practically cutting through his forearm as he held it down on the ground.
”Truth or dare?”
He didn’t wait for a reply before climbing up the stairs to his dormitory and sitting down on his bed to get his towel and pjs. He went back down the stairs toward the common room, not failing to notice that the conversation had died down, and out into the hallway. The eighth year lavatory was just across the hall and it was practically an exact replica of the prefects’ bathroom. Showers were on the far wall and had privacy charms surrounding them and the center of the room was dedicated to a huge bath much like the one he’d visited in his fourth year.
which we probably would seeing as I would
“By the looks of you, they didn’t find Peeves last night. Am I right?” Luna asked. Draco just nodded and made his way up the stairs to get dressed. When he got down, Harry was being questioned by the twins.
“I’ll take the compliment, Malfoy. But just so you know, my mind wouldn’t be filled with images of you screwing me if
It was a long tiresome aspect of his job that he would despise if not for the pride he felt for his student’s success. He was nearing his last of the third-year essays when Ms. Jordan coughed to announce her presence.
They’d managed to stand up and had made it the edge of the corridor when they heard voices. Harry accioed his invisibility cloak with his wand and levitated it onto himself and Draco.
”Well I don’t want to be your friend. You’re a stupid prick who loves being gloried by the press!”
do this.”
Draco and Harry had gotten into yet another fight that evening and had been kicked out of the pub.
“I don’t know why you would suggest that, professor, I’ve mentioned already that I’d bore myself with the routine of it all. If I didn’t mind working with criminals I would have thought to be an auror.”
“I didn’t know you could read, Potter.” Draco sneered as he came up behind him in the library one day. His blond hair was fluttering slightly in the breeze of the open window and glowing in the sunlight. He looked angelic.
They got stuck together quite a few times more by Peeves. Once during a potions lesson when Draco had been insulting Harry’s work behind him, a Harry had turned around and slapped him across the face.
an improbable coincidence.
A few creatures rattled in their covered cages but Harry paid them no mind. He replaced the desks to their usual positions and washed the board with a silent flick of his wand. He decided to deal with the papers he needed to grade first, and then later move on to the angry parent letters, if he had time.
The students had stopped shouting after the arrival of their professor and Harry could now clearly make out the shouting behind the closed door of the potions professor’s office. A green light flashed through the crack of the door for a moment and Harry didn’t hesitate to cast.
in the hallway outside the common room.
”You sound like a child. Let me go.”
The spell didn’t have the desired effect. Malfoy was far from laughing and he couldn’t harm the boggart even if he tried in his current state of mind. Harry cast his own spell from where he stood behind him.
With his momentary distraction over with, Harry turned back to his tedious work. After about another thirty essays about the uses and counters of a simple knockback jinx, he abandoned his corrections and made his way down for lunch where Neville was waiting for him.
“What’s in it for me?” Draco said with defiance before he turned to sneer in Harry’s general direction, “Potter wouldn’t stand a chance anyhow.”
Draco removed his fingers and grabbed Harry’s hip in a bruising hold. He pushed him against the wall, aligned himself with his slick entrance and pushed. His mind went blank. Waiting for Harry to tell him to move was practically impossible. Harry moved his hips slowly seconds later, impaling himself further on Draco’s hard member. The voices outside were going louder but they were safe in the magical showers and the thought of getting caught like this gave them both a thrill.
Harry pushed back onto Draco’s finger relaxing as best he could to get used to the intrusion. He was left with no doubts about his sexuality. This.
“Professor! Will you just stop and listen?” The urgency in her voice made him stop.
”Merlin, Potter, you’re so tight.” He whispered. His fingers had breached the tight ring muscle and into Harry’s warmth. This was so wrong, but the brunet groaned into his shoulder and all thoughts of right or wrong vanished. He didn’t give a shit. All he knew was that this was
“Malfoy. I want-mmm. I want you to fuck me.” It was all he’d thought of since the blond had mentioned it earlier and he wanted, no needed, to know what it felt like.
Draco and Harry hadn’t spoken since that morning and now they were sat at opposite sides of the tub pretending that nothing had ever happened that morning.
“Party tonight guys, don’t forget!” It had become a new tradition of sorts that every so often, the eighth years all got together to have a hot tub party in the eighth year lavatory. Alcohol was snuck in through the newly functional room of requirement and games were to be had in the giant tub. They’d played a competitive game of pool volleyball on night with loads and loads of foam filling the space.
“That won’t be necessary. I should have known not to give assignments to so many of my groups at once.” He walked around his desk and sat on the edge of it, crumpling a few letters in the process. “I wanted to ask if you’d thought of anything you’d like to do after you graduate since the last time we spoke.” She shook her head, “Well in that case, I might suggest you think about becoming a  healer.”
Madam Pomfrey did as was asked and Malfoy, who had been awfully tense, relaxed a little. He was glad he wouldn’t be permanently attached to the smelly hit next to him and the bed had been very uncomfortable for him too. Minutes passed by and felt like hours before the professor returned with a poltergeist contained in a magical barrier. The boys glared daggers at the floating figure, who just stuck out his tongue and giggled.
The lot of eighth years went own to the great Hall for breakfast not long after, their booming voices echoing through the empty halls that lead to the more common areas of the school. after that most went to the library to finish up some work before going to the village before lunch. Hogsmead was better in the afternoon anyhow.
It was a secret agreement between them that they not mention what it was they were involved in. It was just casual sex. They did start talking to each other more and more and it brought them closer together despite the fact that neither of them would admit it. They never kissed. It was just casual.
Malfoy. He thanked Alyssa for the help and announced that the situation had been taken care of. There was nothing to worry about.
There was still some hostility between the Slytherins who had returned and the others, but most had been forced by Hermione to acknowledge the fact that no one had had a choice in the war.
”You’re father isn’t here. I’m here and I’m asking you to give me a chance.” His chest was hurting but he had to keep trying. He had to see this through.
Seamus was all too proud of his position in from of the voice amplifier, started passionately describing the fight as Hermione rushed towards the field to stop them before anything happened.
“Oh my goodness! Draco, you poor child.” Pansy said.
Unfortunately, Hermione’s predictions were partly right. It was mid February and Harry had spent Valentine’s Day glaring at all the couples. After spending far too much time trying to find out why it was he was jealous, he’d made a plan to put an end to his problem. He’d sent a message to Draco for him to meet him by the room of requirement that weekend at dinner.
”Let’s go!” He said, impatience clear in his tone. He moved foot forward when he felt a warmth press against him and-
. He pumped his fingers in and out, experimentally. How could this ever be wrong?
”First! I think Neville should go first. He’s master of all dares after all.” Seamus said. Everyone remembered how Neville’s last date had ended. Cheers erupted and Blaise was given the ok to give Neville his options.
”Well of course,
“You bet against me?!” Pansy waved him off and the whole year started arguing about who had actually won.
“Is that a rhetorical question?” Malfoy answered the red-head in Harry’s place. He then proceeded to try and get up from the awkward position on the floor. He successfully managed, with the help of Harry of course, but not before complaining about the situation and that his neck was hurting.
”NO! PEEVES, YOU WOULDN’T DARE!” Draco shouted.
”I shouldn’t... this isn’t right.” The pale boy said, but his body contradicted his words as he leaned into the touch. They couldn’t do much but push against each other in this position but it was all that was necessary to bring the two over the edge a little more than five minutes later, rutting frantically against each other beneath the surface of the water. Both too drunk to care what consequences there could be afterwards.
Malfoy shifted beneath him and rolled back onto his back. When he realized the situation he was in, he let out a strange yell and cursed under his breath. The rest of the boys in the dorm had waken up now and were looking at them curiously.
but it was no use. He burst into a fit of giggles as he saw Neville walking around to an empty bed.
”Stop. Don’t do this. I can’t do that.” Draco eyes were filling with tears, “Merlin, my father must be rolling around in his grave.”
He turned to Malfoy, who was brushing himself off where he stood in the corner of the small office, smiling ever so slightly and avoiding his gaze. He went to shove the boggart into a chest he’d conjured and turned back to speak.
“We believe you, Neville. Malfoy’s just being a prick.” Harry had replied. He turned to look over Draco’s shoulder as he read the letter he’d received.
”No.” Harry took Draco’s hand and lead him to the table and pulled out the chair, “This is a date.” Draco didn’t sit. He clenched his fists by his side and avoided Harry’s gaze.
His class was empty when he arrived. He’d dismissed his class to go to the dungeons and he didn’t have any more classes before Monday. He only had two classes that day and that had been his second. He sighed. His classroom was a mess. The desks had been moved to both sides in preparation for the sixth year’s practical lesson and the benches were piled on top in a very hazardous way. Papers lined the windows, still ungraded from last week’s assignments. Harry was secretly hoping to give out detention so he wouldn’t have to correct them alone. It really was the worst part of his job. His desk was covered in unread letters he’d received over the course of the week that were most likely from overbearing parents and his blackboard was in dire need of a good cleaning.
Malfoy lunged at Peeves with a loud growl, dragging himself and Harry back down to the ground. Harry let out an undignified yelp as he fell face first into the grass. He used the arm farthest from the blond to pull himself off the ground and smacked him on the back of the head with the other. Draco turned to glare at him and stuck him with a half-assed stinging hex.
, he asked and a third finger joined the others, spreading him wider and fucking him deeper. It was too much. It was too good. His fingers scraped at the wall in front of him and he faintly heard the sound of voices though the shower’s privacy charms.
when someone was rubbing against it. He thought of what would happen if they kept walking like this and to his horror, he felt blood rushing to his nether regions as well. He tried willing it away and panic seized him when he found himself thinking of Malfoy brushing up against him. This was
They moved together with a steady growing rhythm. Draco was biting and sucking on the dark skin of Harry’s sweaty back, water was streaming down his face, but he paid it no mind. His own pleasure, forgotten, mind set on the task at hand. Soon Harry was begging him for another finger and he complied, pushing another in to join the first, curling and twisting them in the slick warmth that was Harry’s hole. He pumped them in and out as the boy moaned and groaned.
Without thinking, Harry closed his hand around the golden ball, fingers scraping at Malfoy’s palm as he snatched it out of reach.
He lay in bed thinking about the different dates he’d been on over the past year. Maybe he just wasn’t destined to fall in love. Maybe that bond he craved didn’t exist. Ron had often joked about how his perfect witch sounded more like a wizard, but Harry refused to believe it. It was getting harder and harder to do, though. He still couldn’t find himself to like any of the witches Hermione set him up with.
They wasted no time. Harry sent a patronus to his class on the third floor to dismiss his class early and tumbled down the stairs after his student, Alyssa Jordan, who studying at Hogwarts for her seventh year. She was a kind-hearted young witch who, normally, treated everyone with politeness, respect, and fairness. Had the situation been any different, Harry probably would have chuckled at the site of the Hufflepuff bustling down the hall, pushing and shoving everyone in her way without the smallest of apologies, shouting at anyone who refused to cooperate and stomping down the stairs to the dungeons with an impregnable determined pace.
friction and Harry let out a whimper that he barely heard over the heavy beating of his heart.
Soon both boys were knocking into each other trying to get the snitch, hands stretched out towards it and trying desperately to reach it before the other. The stands wizzes passed them faster than ever and bludgers trailed behind them.
That inevitably started a lengthy argument about who was the best of the two seekers. Most had agreed that Harry was superior and that had left the blond boy practically seething and he’d agreed to
”Harry! Oh, Merlin... so good. Don’t..ah..stop!” Draco bit down on his shoulder, hard, and shuddered violently against him. Harry joined him barely seconds later, spilling into his pants as he dug his hands into Draco’s pants to put him close and squeezing his bare bottom.
”Ladies and Gentlemen of the eighth cohort! Tonight, we face the game that will determine if you posses balls or if you are seriously lacking in that department. Of course, even the women of the house are welcome to possess these jewels. Let the games begin!” Hermione announced from where she stood at the edge of the water, before she jumped and tucked in her legs, canon-balling into the center of the large bath.
The few Gryffindors that had returned for their eighth year were sitting in their new common room on the first floor. It had been a very difficult adjustment for everyone in their year. Every year prior to this one, they had either needed to climb or to descend the many steps to the towers and dungeons many times a day in order to reach their dorms. The new common, however, room for the eighth years had been created with the entrance on the first floor.
“You don’t really think there’s something going on between them, do you?”
Draco peeked at McGonagall. One of her eyebrows was raised, making her look more stern. A classic McGonagall move.
“Potter,” he croaks.
Harry lowers his wand, hoping he won’t regret it and swiftly walks up to the other boy.
“I don’t act like it’s a punishment,” he murmurs after a moment. He ignores Draco’s snort. “It’s just… It gives me too much time to think.”
Draco gapes at him.
“Obviously,” Harry echoes.
Harry inevitably thinks of Bellatrix and their fight in the Ministry. She had told him he has to mean it when he wants to use an Unforgivable Curse. It wouldn’t work otherwise.
“What?”
“You’re impossible,” Potter chuckles, but he lifts their joined hands to his mouth and kisses Draco’s palm. “Now eat the best pancakes you’ve ever had.” Potter doesn’t look smug as he says it, but his tone makes it very clear he has no doubt about his skills. It’s irritatingly hot.
“Hmmm… no. I don’t want to move right now.”
Draco simply shook his head.
It couldn’t be. There was no way. But… the longer he thought about it… Baxter and Potter had never been in a room together. Since Potter had shown up, Draco had only seen the koala when he thought Potter was sound asleep in the next room…
“I’m not uncomfortable with it,” Harry burst out. “Draco, I had no idea we- Oh God, this is so embarrassing.” He let out a deep sigh, before taking Draco’s hands in his. “I had no idea you wanted to- you wanted me to…”
“Ah, I grabbed a few things before we came here.” Potter pulls out a little bag from his inner pocket. “I thought it might come in handy.”
“Not to the point that it would justify that kind of reaction.”
Harry sighs. “Alright, alright.” It takes him almost half an hour to empty the bowl placed in front of him. Afterwards, Madam Pomfrey hands him three different vials. They all taste appalling.
It’s been seven months and twenty days since they’ve last seen each other and even though his eyes immediately want to dart over to Draco, Harry forces himself to keep his gaze on Greyback. Staring at Draco will only give him away. He tries to keep his face impassive as Lucius Malfoy and his wife start talking to Greyback agitatedly. Dread crashes down on him when he notices Narcissa Malfoy regarding him closely.
While Draco has no idea what the wizard is talking about, Dumbledore’s eyes widen. Without another word, he vanishes from the frame, as does the other wizard. Draco is all alone again. Good. He’d rather be alone. He’ll probably be alone for the rest of his life.
He shook his head and started to move towards the door. He needed a shower.
Draco frowned in confusion and turned around. Oh no!
He keeps his head down as he throws Potter a nasty scowl. It intensifies when he sees him staring off into space. Ugh, he definitely needs a shave. And a haircut. But what else is new. And… apparently more sleep. The dark circles under his eyes speak volumes of restless nights. Perhaps that’s why he’s so jittery. And honestly, his lip is going to bleed if he bites it any harder. Draco hopes it does. It would go well with the deep frown wrinkles between his eyebrows.
“Save it, Potter. I never needed your pity.”
He can’t even win a fight against Potter, Draco thinks bitterly. Is his father right? Is Draco really a disappointment? Draco is faintly aware that he’s heaving and puffing, his chest aching.
“I kept saying I didn’t trust him,” Potter says. His voice almost sounds like a whimper. “I kept throwing it in his face and he—he probably—”
They stared at each other while Draco prayed this was only a dream.
Harry silently sipped his tea as the two Slytherins in his kitchen started bickering.
“Kind of paradoxical, isn’t it,” Draco said, knowing he was about to ruin the moment, “that you can tell me something like that and yet not believe me when I tell you the same.”
Draco studies him, his heart inadvertently beating faster as more of Potter’s warmth seeps into him.
“When we—When we—” He cleared his throat, his cheeks slowly turning pink. “When you held me—I—I—” Potter made a choking sound and it was clear he couldn’t finish his sentence.
He desperately wished he could look into Harry’s head right now. What was
“It was like—like it was luring me to—to—” Draco hesitates. “Where was I going?”
“It was on that day,” Draco said. Harry frowned, trying to remember. Huh. Maybe Draco was right. He hadn’t even realised. Grabbing Draco’s hand had become such a habit, he didn’t really think about it anymore. Just like sleeping in the same bed. Snuggling in said bed. Cuddling on the couch. Doing… basically everything together.
Potter bursts out laughing. He closes the gap between them once more and moves his lips tenderly against Draco’s.
“A part of Voldemort’s soul was inside of me,” Potter says quietly.
The woman scowls at Draco. “No need to be so rude about it.”
“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Harry says with a dismissive gesture. “Here’s what we’re gonna do.” He puts both of his hands on his hips, very aware of the fact he’s only wearing a towel, and draws himself up to his full height. Which, unfortunately, is still two centimetres shorter than Malfoy. “You saw mine, so it’s only fair you show me yours now.”
Draco’s lips stretched into a lopsided smirk. “Did you do it?”
“You know that’s bollocks, right?,” Potter said, his frown deepening. “I’d gladly exchange all the ‘famous Harry Potter’ rubbish for a boring, normal life.”
The brief glimpse Harry catches of his face, however, speaks volumes. His lips are parted and his cheeks are flushed, the deep pink in stark contrast to the rest of his pale skin. It encourages Harry to keep checking the Marauder’s Map, to follow Draco around unobtrusively, hoping to startle him into a conversation. After his third ambush, however, he seems to have put Draco on alert and the git seems to have improved his skills at nonverbal spells as well. More than once, Harry falls victim to the Jelly-Legs-Jinx, leaving him incapacitated while Draco takes off in a hurry.
“Why not?” Potter shrugged.
One of Draco’s fingers twitches. Not a chance. “What other things?” No!
“I… um… Well, I guess I wouldn’t be completely… Um, that is to say, I-”
“Fuck! Are you telling me I have to walk around wearing this?” Malfoy snaps. “Why the hell did you do that?”
Draco grits his teeth at Potter’s audacity. “You’re the one who’s bleeding, you idiot,” he grumbles as he picks himself off the floor.
“Yeah, of course it would have such a special meaning to you, if it reminds you of
When they broke apart several minutes later, Harry’s heart skipped a beat and he was sure he had never seen anything more beautiful. The way Draco was looking at him almost made him topple over. This was how he wanted Draco to look at him from now on, with the biggest smile on his face Harry had ever seen.
Potter chuckled, coming to a halt right in front of Draco.
“Stella?” another girl pipes up. Her huge brown eyes and the two long braids that almost reach down to her stomach make her look like a first year. “She’s been missing for a month.”
“Oh?”
“I know you weren’t,” Draco said with a grin as he buttoned up his shirt. “I guess you’ll stay a virgin forever.”
“If you don’t wake up on your own in the morning, believe me, I’ll make sure those potions find their way into your system one way or another.”
“Hmmm.”
“I don’t know.”
“Potter,” he shouts. “G—get away f—f—from me!”
Draco flinches, but Harry ignores it.
“What kind of things?”
Discovering someone else’s body, without being able to see, is an experience Harry isn't prepared for. Aside from the fact that he hasn’t touched anyone like this before, this feels… overwhelming. He can only see with his hands. Still, he wishes he could at least get a glimpse of Malfoy’s eyes. Do they widen as Harry’s fingers wander up his spine? Does he like the way Harry’s fingers are brushing against his skin?
“Did it hurt you?” Draco asked, rushing to Teddy’s side.
“Shhhh.” He leaned closer, cradling Harry’s head. Harry had to admit, it felt nice. Really nice. He suddenly couldn’t stop thinking about the dream  (or rather the memory) of having someone (apparently Malfoy) in his arms.
A strange look flashes over Potter’s features before he holds out his glass and waits. After a moment of consideration, Draco touches his glass to Potter’s and leans back in his chair. He watches as Potter takes a sip and puts his elbows on his desk.
“Maybe,” Hermione says and her lips stretch into a knowing grin. “Look, I think it would be best for all of us if you two just sit down together and—”
Harry’s mind reels as he finally realises it’s Malfoy’s collection he discovered in the Room of Requirement. But why is he getting rid of it?
“Albus,” Draco hears somebody hiss. He opens his eyes, looks around disoriented, until he sees an old wizard in another portrait gesticulate agitatedly. “Albus, the boy!”
“Harry needs to die. As long as he’s alive, Lord Voldemort can’t be killed.”
It was quick, fleeting, but it made Harry stop dead, the air completely knocked out of his lungs. Grey eyes, hesitant, sad, locked with his.
Draco peeks at him from under his lashes. His face is unreadable, but he looks paler than usual.
Draco’s anger melted away quickly, however, when the koala’s head was nestled in the crook of his neck and he felt its slow and steady breathing.
Harry hesitates. He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t. But he needs to know more about these potions. And, if he’s being honest, he really doesn’t want Malfoy to stop doing… what he’s doing. Even if this turns out to be poison, his colleagues know where he is. He sent a Patronus. They’re probably already on their way.
Malfoy nods and pulls Harry into a kiss that’s far more tender than he expected.
Harry’s head whips to the side, a hot stinging sensation on his right cheek.
“Asking for a new partner,” Draco finishes. He leans back in his chair, feeling dumbstruck. Why is he even surprised?
“Oh, so you’re saying I did all of this for nothing?” Draco huffed. Potter smiled.
“Oh man, your beard is really soft,” Ron said, twisting a finger into the white strands. “Is your hair that soft everywhere? I know the beard isn’t real, I mean, technically it’s not real, and I’ve seen you naked before, but—” Harry clapped his hand back onto Ron’s mouth, his eyes wide in horror.
“You like her, don’t you?”
“What did she put in his tea?”
That gesture seems to make her more uncomfortable. She pushes down her fringe, as though she’s trying to hide her eyes behind her blonde locks.
“Harry Potter! Harry Potter!”
No, it’s still his own loss, Draco thinks gloomily. And now he’s lost Potter for good.
“I knew Voldemort had something on you,” Harry says in an accusing tone. “I knew you didn’t want to do this. I knew it!”
“N—No.”
“Your— What?”
Draco tries to kill him with a glare.
Draco debates snatching his hand away, but what if the prat starts whimpering again? There’s no way he can ignore that. He’ll lie awake, tempted to strangle him. To make matters worse, the tosser seems to be more relaxed now, his breathing slow and even. Draco isn’t keen on disrupting that, suspecting he won’t get a wink of sleep if he does. It’s got nothing to do with the fact that Potter’s heartbeat is now drumming against the back of his hand and Draco’s face is feeling strangely warm.
“Why?”
Harry yelps when Malfoy pulls him forward. He tries to shove the other boy's hands away, struggling and grunting. He pushes against Malfoy’s shoulders, but his grip is as hard as iron. As he tears at Harry’s pyjama, there’s a clattering sound on the floor. Before Harry can think about what that sound was, Malfoy shoves him away. He feels his breath getting knocked out of him when his back crashes into the wall. He groans, hunching, before his legs give way, and he collapses onto the floor.
“Just look into his eyes,” Draco said. “You’ll know it’s him.”
“Hey, when you see that secret admirer of mine, could you give him a message?”
Maybe he shouldn’t have used so many colours to ice the cake. The writing was barely legible. This was such a mess. But he didn’t have time to start over. Frustrated, he threw the piping bag on the table.
will talk about tonight. Sometimes he talks about his mother. Never about his father. Sometimes he doesn’t say anything at all and they just sit there in silence. At first, Harry thought this was a waste of time. But it was in that silence, he realized that something really is different between them. It’s as if something between them has… shifted.
“Um, no thank you. You were obviously getting ready for bed. I won’t disturb you any longer,” he said hastily.
“W—What?” Harry freezes. No, it can’t be. He can’t know— “Damn it, the potion!”
“Does it bother you?”
“You’re not… jealous, are you?”
“Why would she do that?”
“I will be when I can feel your balls against my arse.”
“Excuse me?”
Taking a deep breath, Draco commands his hand to cup Potter’s balls through his pyjama bottoms. It seems that this was a good choice. Potter makes a gurgling sound and his legs jerk. It’s then that Draco is starting to realise how much power he has over Potter in this very moment. He slowly squeezes Potter’s balls, drawing a deep moan out of him. Encouraged by this, Draco massages them. He stares in wonder as Potter’s legs fall open.
“What?” Potter sounds scandalised. “Why?”
“Misses yeh too, the little shit, if yeh ask me.”
“Oh, it might take a while before the effect kicks in. Hang in there, my boy.” Another clap on the shoulder. “By tomorrow, at the latest, everything should be back to normal.”
It was on the tip of Harry’s tongue. He bit his lip to prevent him from embarrassing himself. It was bad enough he had feelings for his flatmate… Okay, at this point, Draco was definitely more than his flatmate. He had become his best friend. He couldn’t ruin that by blurting out something stupid. No.
“Come on, Malfoy,” Potter urges, wrapping his arms around himself.
“I’m a Black,” Draco shrugs.
“Harry Potter,” Draco shrieked. Harry stepped up to him and placed his hands on his shoulders.
Draco mentally berates himself. He was so angry at Potter; he thought Potter didn’t care. Instead, Potter hadn’t been able to care.
“Don’t look at me like that,” Potter bellows. “I’m so sick of you!”
Draco watched as he drank his coffee pensively, his expression turning more serious.
“No idea,” Blaise said. “I didn’t get a name. Two people came by to pick it up. I think they were Muggles.”
Harry looks down at his cup, shame washing over him.
“What do you want me to do?” Potter asked.
“See you then,” he said. And right before he vanished, he smiled.
Draco almost cried out when Potter’s hand curled around his cock; it only prompted Draco to move even more frantically.
“Celia. That’s a pretty name,” Potter said softly, smiling at her. “How old are you, Celia?”
Unsure of what to do next, he slightly leans forward, so his forehead rests against Malfoy’s. This might be too intimate a gesture, but Harry’s brain seems to be too foggy to register. He relishes the feeling of Malfoy’s soft skin against his, the warm drizzling of the water somehow intensifying it. The urge to let his hands roam becomes more powerful with every second, until Harry can’t keep it to himself anymore.
Harry was so lost in thought, he didn’t notice the raised eyebrows, the looks the Slytherins were giving him or the way Draco had turned beet red.
“BECAUSE I’M IN LOVE WITH YOU, YOU IDIOT!”
“Fuck,” Potter almost yelled. Draco did it again, pressing the flat of his tongue against Potter’s rim. But what now? Draco thought hard, until he decided to move his tongue like he did when he was eating ice cream. That couldn’t be too wrong, right? “Oh fuck, Draco!”
“You’re that optimistic?” Harry asks, doubt ringing loudly in his voice.
“Yeah, but for how much longer? Honestly, Potter, one might almost think you—”
He keeps a close eye on Potter over the next week, something that seems to be coming to him naturally. On Thursday evening, just as Draco is about to go home, Olivia Miller, Robards’ assistant, passes them and pauses, giving Harry a sympathetic look.
Potter needs three attempts until he’s finally able to grab a card. His eyes widen as he clutches it. “I—I can’t answer that.”
Potter’s shoulders slump and his forehead is touching the window again. “He didn’t give me any hints, Hermione. The things we did… Everything was a bit awkward and messy, but I thought he was just nervous. I was.”
Fuck. What now?
“Good strange?”
Harry looks at him in wild horror. Tickle the fucking Flobberworm?
“Huh. You’re more opinionated than usual.”
“Sooo…” He stretches out his hands, only to realise he has no idea what to do with them. He quickly puts them in his lap and purses his lips. He got what he wanted. Malfoy is right beside him. And now, he has no idea what to do.
Celia cocked her head and pursed her lips while she tapped her chin with her index finger. “Yes,” she finally said. “Is he a good friend?”
It’s all he can think about the next day, and the day after that, and the— Well, you get the idea. There has to be a way he can show Malfoy he’s not a homophobic prick.
“Yes, you twit! It’s a yes.”
“This isn’t your property, Malfoy,” Harry ground out.
“Then why do the house-elves have it in the kitchens?”
Draco raises his chin and looks at Potter with half-hooded eyes; he can do this.
Malfoy grunts and buries his hands in Harry’s hair. “You’re driving me mad, Potter.”
Shit, was that too obvious?
“Thanks,” Harry murmurs. “Err, I’m sorry if this is rude, but could you maybe leave us alone?”
“And now?” Draco hears himself ask.
At least the other boys are sensible enough not to bring up the fact that their entire dorm is plastered with all sorts of colourful flowers. Neville is the only one who keeps commenting on it, but only because he’s fascinated by them. He tried to talk to Harry about them a few times, but Harry stayed silent. He’s avoiding talking to anyone, really.
“This is a lot to take in, for all of us,” Draco said, putting a hand on Potter’s shoulder. “Let’s have breakfast first and then we’ll take one step at a time.”
“And when have you ever needed my help?” Draco snarls. He realises much too late that there’s another insult in Potter’s phrasing; as though it’s a given that he will take the lead and Draco is merely his assistant.
“You are! Ugh!” Potter rakes his fingers through his unruly hair, making it even messier.
“I, um, I wanted to tell you something.”
Since so many asked for a sequel... ;)
Draco couldn’t care less about that, but instead of clarifying, he simply nods and takes another sip of his coffee.
After they’re gone, he strains his ears for any sign of Malfoy. It’s driving him mad that he can’t just go out and look for him himself. It would be pointless. Still, sitting back has never been his strong suit.
It’s not like the hate is suddenly gone. Harry still feels it whenever he looks at him. But it’s different now.
“I really hate to leave you here.”
“Do you want to keep standing? I think it would be much better to have this conversation sitting down, you know.”
“WHAT?”
Harry finds himself unable to look at Malfoy all throughout the lesson. He stares at his hands in his lap instead, which doesn’t prove to be very helpful either, especially when a sea of pink-coloured peonies appear by his feet.
“About ter take a nap, were yeh?”
“Um, Harry, are you feeling okay?”
“Alright then,” Harry said, making room for Draco to lie down. He summoned two blankets from their bedroom and tucked his boyfriend in.
Draco cleared his throat. That wasn’t exactly a compliment. He wondered if that was the reason he often found himself unable to break any rules. And while Teddy keeping a koala in his room was definitely more than a bagatelle, his mother’s words echoed in his head like a taunt.
“Thank you and… sorry for the inconvenience,” Narcissa told the keeper, who simply nodded.
in front of him and his hips are encircled by strong arms. Malfoy is leaning against the brick wall and Harry has to grab his forearms to steady himself. What in the name of Merlin is happening?
“Again, this is only a guess.” Dumbledore folds his hands. “I believe it was the darkest part of your soul that revolted. It sought obliteration.”
“It feels like I am,” Malfoy sniffs.
“I’m certainly not going to try to force myself on you if you—”
Before he can let out a frustrated sigh, Potter suddenly convulses beside him. Draco’s eyes widen as he starts screaming at the top of his lungs. It sounds like the screams he had to listen to at the Manor. What is happening?
“You two seem… very close,” Blaise observed with a chuckle.
“How is your mother?” Potter asks with a hint of uncertainty.
Harry lets his head fall back against the door as more laughter seizes him. “It probably won’t be pretty,” he snorts. After a moment, he squeezes Ginny’s hand again with a smile. “Thank you,” he whispers. “It really means—Thank you.”
“I’m not—What are you implying, Potter?”
Harry could only stand there and stare while Draco wrapped his arms around him.
“Rose isn’t even here right now.”
“Ventus,” he hears McGonagall say and feels a sudden gust of air.
“No way, Potter.”
“We would have come sooner, Harry, but we had to take Rose to Molly’s first.”
“Do you—” Malfoy pauses. “Do you want it to be clammy?”
“Looking for the others,” Potter interjects. He gives Draco a meaningful glance. Merlin, how Gryffindor of him, wanting to protect Connor’s and Stella’s little secret. “He was pretty worked up about the whole thing.”
“For what?”
“Seems a bit unlike you,” he murmurs, jerking his chin towards Malfoy’s parchment.
Potter pressed his lips into a tight line. He almost looked like a child who had been caught stealing candy.
For the longest time, Draco hadn’t thought he needed anything more than that. From anyone. Being hugged for no reason at all seemed like such a strange concept. Until Draco discovered there was always a reason, wasn’t there?
“I’m warm,” Malfoy echoes. It almost sounds like a question and his voice sounds… dumbfounded. But that could be Harry’s imagination. He doesn’t know what to believe right now.
“And,” Malfoy bites his lip. “I know how it ends. I know—I know what will cure you.”
Draco seemed to ponder this for a moment before hesitantly opening his mouth and accepting the spoonful of porridge.
“Bummer,” Draco mutters. He peeks over the dividing wall when Potter stays silent. He’s staring at his desk, or maybe the letter, disappointment written all over his face. “Weasley with a baby,” Draco mutters, scrunching up his nose. “Huh. On second thought, it might suit him more than being an Auror.”
“You—Cox! This doesn’t concern you. Stop lurking and go back to work.”
“Godson?”
“I haven’t been back there since…”
Harry doesn’t want to jump to any conclusions. That won’t go down well. But, as always, his tongue is quicker than his brain.
“Why would it do that?”
Draco huffed in response and wordlessly moved them to the shower. When the first splash of hot water hit Harry’s scalp, he let out a whimper. He leaned back against Draco and let the other man support his weight. Draco’s touch was tentative and yet sure as he washed the grime out of Harry’s hair and off his body.
Harry tries to resist clearing his throat; Malfoy looks far too smug as it is. He doesn’t want him to give any more leverage.
“I know.” Harry swallows.
“Oh.” Harry doesn’t remember.
“If I kiss you now,” he says quietly, “it will mean goodbye. It’s not a goodbye, do you hear me?”
“You said you wanted to fuck me,” he smirks.
Harry blinks as Malfoy puts down his tea and gets up.
“A game? Since when are you into games?”
“Shit,” Potter spluttered, grabbing Draco’s hips. “Oh Merlin, do that again.”
At first, Draco thinks the curse has missed him. He doesn’t feel anything. He stumbles when something bounces off him. He watches the streaks of light chase each other through the room. He has never seen anything like it. And then, it happens. Pain, like he has never felt before, tears through him. It’s like his chest is being cut open by an invisible sword. He loses his balance, tumbles, until he’s struck by a violent force.
Would he be okay? Harry suspects the world wouldn’t be the same afterwards, but that’s not exactly what Malfoy is asking, is it?
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Potter turns to him and gives him a questioning look.
“That is very unfortunate,” Slughorn mutters, examining the flower. He gives Harry a peculiar look before his gaze wanders over to the door. Oh god, he knows. Hermione probably does, too.
“Merlin, Potter, don’t—” He breaks off when he notices Magnolia’s face. She’s staring at Potter as though he’s a Dementor. “Magnolia,” Draco says softly, “are you alright?”
“Are we having another DA meeting?” she asks, cocking her head.
“We’re not sure. His classmates say they haven’t seen him since yesterday morning. They only came to Professor Slughorn now because they didn’t want to give him a false alarm.”
“You know, Slytherin and all that.”
Potter coughs and Draco would bet anything it’s a fake cough.
“What?” Draco hisses.
“No, you don’t understand, Potter. My life is complicated enough as it is. I don’t need to add your drama to it.”
Harry cocks his head to the side. “Seriously? They don’t think I made you Captain because you’re one hell of a player? Because you’re an amazing Chaser, but also a bloody good Seeker? They didn’t stop to think that my decision is based on talent, rather than favouring a friend? Is this coming from Dean?”
Harry implores his mind as the scene suddenly turns into something very awkward. That is
He felt his left hand tremble and his knees going weak; it took so much effort to stay vertical and to school his features. Potter was Baxter… Baxter was Potter. Somehow, it felt like such a huge betrayal. Had Potter known from the start? Was this all part of some sick plan? What the hell was he up to?
“One might think you don’t care about your own life.”
“Hey, I said
“Because,” Potter yells, throwing his hands in the air. “I didn’t know what I was agreeing to! And I wouldn’t have—” He pauses, his face suddenly unreadable. “Did I hurt you?”
“Merlin, this was the best idea ever,” Theo roared.
“What— What— Draco?”
When he comes home that night, he pauses after shutting the door. He cocks his ears, slowly leaning to his left. There are voices coming from Malfoy’s room. Voices, as in Malfoy isn’t alone in there. Well, it’s not like he isn’t allowed to have people over.
“Yeah, I kinda miss Ron’s too,” Harry says. He feels Malfoy shift. And then.
“I’m sorry,” McGonagall told Draco, “I thought you two…” The rest of the unspoken sentence had Draco’s mind spinning. She obviously thought they were close enough for Draco to share his secret with Potter.
“I’m spelling something, you prat! Concentrate!”
“This is—” Potter gulps. “You’re shirtless.”
Draco stopped, almost dropping his bag. A drink? With Potter? Was he serious?
Draco grabs his mug with both hands and gulps down the coffee. It does help, but the aftertaste is absolutely horrendous.
With shaking fingers, he puts down the flask, containing the Potion Master’s memory, placing Draco’s vial right beside it. Which one should he look at first? Somehow, it feels too selfish to start with Draco’s, but Harry has been dying to know what kind of memories Draco pulled out of his head for him. And, surely, whatever Snape has wanted him to see can’t be pleasant.
Dragging himself out of bed gets harder every day. It just seems so… pointless.
Ginny raises an eyebrow at him. “Who do you think? Draco Malfoy, of course.”
Harry watches him stride away with his head held high. Who does he think he is? He’s trying to help Harry? Yeah, right.
Potter opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Before he could say something stupid, Draco reached for his wrist.
“Wait, what’s the difference between a normal tent and a Muggle tent?”
“Can you take me to him?”
“Don’t,” Malfoy interrupted him.
“Won’t your parents— I mean, err…”
“No, no,” Malfoy sniggers, grabbing Harry’s wrist. “No touching.”
“Uh-huh,” Harry says, unable to focus on anything other than Malfoy’s eyes. His breath catches when Malfoy slightly leans forward as though he’s going to kiss Harry. Oh.
“I just said I thought it was the right thing to do. I thought you were better off without me.”
Nothing happens for a moment, then he feels a finger digging into his chest.
Malfoy snorts. “Read the story, Potter. Then you’ll know.”
“I—I—”
“But you like me, right?”
“Wow, um… I really don’t know why I said that,” Harry murmurs sheepishly.
Well, maybe it wouldn’t be the most horrible thing in the world.
“Potter,” he called, startling the witch beside him. Potter’s eyes instantly found his, a mixture of confusion and excitement in them. Fuck, why did he have to look at Draco like that? “Come here, come on, we need to go. Now!” He stretched out his arm to make room for Potter to walk through, not giving a damn about being scowled at.
“God, why? Why is this happening?”
As Draco kept examining them, the koala held completely still. Draco snorted at his own foolish fascination with the creature.
“If what?” Harry growls, suddenly looking murderous. Draco flinches, but tries to keep his expression even. “If you don’t want to be with me, just say it, don’t make some stupid excuse—”
“Honestly, I don’t get you,” he murmured. He chuckled as the koala waggled its ears. “Seriously, what’s your deal?” He shifted the koala’s weight, so he could pet him with his free hand but stopped when the koala suddenly stilled.
“Well, yeah, I—” Harry shakes his head. “You can’t be serious about this. You can’t live here.”
“As a joke,” she says. “Well, partly as a joke. I still can’t believe you’re into Malfoy of all people. What’s Ron take on this?”
“Is this okay?” he asks. It feels hesitant when Malfoy taps his skin twice, so Harry makes sure to take his time when he continues. Their hands reach his chest and he presses Malfoy’s hand more firmly against his skin. He knows Malfoy can feel his heartbeat. It’s thundering erratically. He lets go of his hand and reaches forward to curl his own around his neck.
“Are you still mad?” Harry asked, kissing him again. His tongue traced the curve of Draco’s lower lip. Draco couldn’t help but shiver.
Oh. Right. Harry didn’t think about that. He doesn’t want that. But if Malfoy doesn’t want to stay here…
“Don’t ‘Draco’ me.” He tries to keep his face impassive. He still isn’t used to Potter calling him by his first name. It slipped out once during sex and neither of them commented on it. But, to Draco’s horror, Potter kept calling him by his first name after that. He secretly loves it, but there’s no need for Potter to know that.
“This isn’t working,” Potter mutters, his gruff tone the complete opposite of the gentle fingers touching Draco’s arm. “Take off your robes.”
“I see,” Draco said flatly. Potter seemed to catch his irritation.
“YOU FUCKING PRICK!”
“WHAT?”
“I’ve been told the host wants to stay anonymous,” Draco said, trying to keep his voice even.
“I know your body is willing, but are
“Are you okay?” Potter asks.
“Are you sure?”
“Idiot,” he hears Malfoy mumble, but there’s a hint of amusement in his voice.
His mother looked at him incredulously and Draco knew she wanted to say something. But he also knew she hated to cause a scene. Surely enough, she nudged Teddy’s shoulder and ushered him into the dining room.
“Wait as long as you want, but I’m getting really… hungry,” he said in a low whisper.
“Again?” Draco inwardly flinched at his high-pitched voice.
Shit!
“No it hasn’t! And if you still can’t see it, even after what happened the other—”
But how should Draco have known? With all this new-found information, it was suddenly painfully obvious why Potter had asked to turn off the lights, why he had wanted to keep his shirt on.
“Oh god,” Harry groans and nearly drops the Flobberworm.
“Nothing.”
He deliberates faking a coughing fit. Maybe that will make Malfoy go back to his bed. But then… he’ll be back in his bed, Harry will be in his, and he’ll be right back to where he started. He exhales loudly, plucking up all his courage. He isn’t a Gryffindor for nothing.
He never should have become this attached to the koala in the first place.
“I—” He gulped. “I broke up with Astoria.”
“You’re not an experiment, Malfoy,” Potter murmured into his neck.
Carefully, he let the squirming child down again. His eyes followed her movements as she immediately darted into the classroom.
He lowers his head to Malfoy’s shoulder again and slowly presses the length of his body against him. No sparks this time. Hmmm. Maybe because he knew it was coming? Or—
“For a very, very long time,” Draco responded, relishing the deep sound Harry made when Draco slipped his fingers underneath his shirt.
Several moments passed until Potter crossed his arms in front of him, covering his stomach. Draco’s eyes darted up to his face. He had never seen Potter look so nervous. His eyes widened when Draco smiled at him and stroked his arm.
“What?”
Draco let out a frustrated grunt. This kid really had a wanton imagination.
“No need to be shy about it,” Harry sniggers. He even goes so far as elbowing Malfoy. Perhaps that was a bit much. At least Malfoy seems to think so. He grabs Harry’s arm, pulling him forward until their noses are almost touching. The Niffler in Harry’s arms makes a displeased sound; it must be getting crushed between them.
“How is he acting around her?”
“Probably just the aftermath of that Goblin wine,” Draco shrugs, mentally begging Potter to let it go.
“Don’t do that to me again,” Draco murmured, placing a kiss on the koala’s head. “Stay with me, okay?”
Blaise looked up from the paper he was reading and grinned at Draco.
“Aww, it’s being shy,” Blaise crooned.
“It’s… nothing,” Harry murmurs, his tone resigned. “Just… take it, or give it back, I don’t care.”
“That’s exactly the point,” Potter intercepted. “People have this idea of me, this image they created, based on what I did to defeat Voldemort, when in reality…” Potter pressed his lips together. It looked painful. “No matter what I do, it will always be a disappointment. It will never be good enough. Like, can you imagine what would happen if I started telling people I’m not becoming an Auror anymore? The public would go mad! And then there’s other people, like McGonagall.” He let out a sigh. “In fifth year, she vowed to do everything in her power to help me get that job, and she did. What do you think she’s going to say if I told her all her efforts were for nothing? But… I just couldn’t go on like that.”
“I did.”
“Draco,” Harry says, nearly rolling his eyes.
“They don’t need me,” he continues. “They only need the idea of me. And they’ll still have that when I’m dead, so what’s the difference, really? At least then I won’t have to—”
“I know,” Draco murmured, trying hard not to let it show how much the kiss affected him.
Malfoy grunts when Harry softly bites his bottom lip and smiles. He returns the favour, leaving Harry breathless and shivering.
Draco stares at him, unblinkingly. “I guess, um—I guess I owe you an apology as well. I—I didn’t think you’d care.” That’s only part of the truth, but Draco can’t bring himself to say more.
Malfoy seemed to notice that he wasn’t the only one in this horrible situation but he kept quiet.
Word had travelled fast and soon most of school were getting bundled up on a cold November evening to go witness the legendary battle that was to take place on the quidditch pitch. Even Peeves, the school poltergeist had made an appearance to cheer on whoever would lose. Harry stood at the foot of the stands with Malfoy at his side. Both were holding their brooms and dressed in their best quidditch robes, determined
Draco, who had taken dance lessons since he’d been very young, would normally have no difficulty following a simple movement but everything about the boy in front of him was unpredictable and whereas that usually brought him a thrill, it was currently nothing short of infuriating. All his energy was devoted to following Harry’s mouvements and willing his breathing to stay even as the boy’s decidedly impressive (almost as impressive as his own) length pressed up against his. Infuriating. Every time their legs moved, pleasure coursed through his body and they were far from reaching their destination, meaning he would have to endure the endless rubbing for at least another five minutes.
things.” Malfoy said defensively, knowing all too well that it was a lie, “Things a person with my responsibilities shouldn’t do.”
“This isn’t our usual spot.” Draco had questioned before being told to
”Ouch! Screw you, Malfoy. That hurt.”
”Delores?” Madam Pomfrey inquired.
”I’ll give you a chance, Harry.” Draco finally said. He pulled back and smiled at Harry and walked back over to the table to sit. Harry joined him at the small table and they stated eating in silence. They spent most of the meal smiling but when Harry smiled or stared for too long, Malfoy kicked him under the table.
the way Draco moved his hips. He knew now why things with Ginny hadn’t worked out. Why they couldn’t ever work out.
The picture of Draco pouting like a child and holding his pink cheek in the common room later that evening was enough for Harry to use for a Patronus forever.
The tub was filled to the brim with steaming hot water and there was at least a foot of foam on the surface. Everyone was sitting around the bath drinking and chatting. It was eight thirty.
! The boggart Lucius stumbled and a moment later was covered in a tattered beige bag similar to the one Dobby had worn when Harry had first met him, but barely long enough to cover his pride. On his neck was a leather collar with a bell that jingled and his voice had gone into a high falsetto rendering him incapable of speaking in a menacing tone without sounding like a certain highly frustrated pink ex-ministry official. None of what he said now could be taken seriously.
“My favourite pets! Are you having a party without me? I’m forgetting something aren’t I? Oh yes! Draco, Harry, did you enjoy yourselves this morning? I’ve got another present just like the last one for you! I wasn’t planning on giving it to you now but now I think is the perfect occasion!” He said maliciously.
What happened next was a surprise to everyone in the stands as well as the two competitions. Draco’s left hand swung toward the snitch flying between his and Harry’s extended hands on his right side, just as Harry’s right hand swiped at it. It resulted in a sort of high five with the snitch clamped between their palms.
“Even your girlfriend knows I’m better than you.” It got a blush to creep up his pale skin which satisfied Harry immensely.
He should have known it wouldn’t be that easy. When have things ever been easy for him? On the contrary, the next day, he has to endure the humiliation of Slughorn’s booming laughter when a bunch of purple flowers suddenly burst out of his cauldron and ruin his potion.
Draco briefly closed his eyes and let out a sigh. “Not much at first. After father was thrown into Azkaban, I took care of mother. She didn’t deal well with his imprisonment. But after a few months, I realised we couldn’t go on like this. Luckily, mother rallied and I was able to get an apprenticeship to become a Potions Master.”
“No,” Draco whispers, shaking his head. Merlin, what’s wrong with him?
Darco shook his head and sighed. “No idea.” He studied Potter from under his lashes, taking in his gaunt figure. Something was seriously wrong with him. “You know, I think it might be best if you talked to a professional.”
“Damn it!”
Draco has only a second to decide if he’s feeling satisfaction or disgust over Potter being sick like that. Next thing he knows, Potter crashes onto the floor, his mouth hanging wide open.
Draco mentally rolls his eyes as Robards marches off. This isn’t the first time the Head Auror is acting as though Draco doesn’t exist.
“I just borrowed it,” Potter says. “Wait until it’s your turn.”
There. He couldn’t have made himself clearer now. Oh, well, maybe it was a bit of an unfortunate choice of words. It might have sounded like a dismissal. Malfoy seems to have taken it that way, Harry thinks, as he feels how tense he suddenly is, his body rigid and his hand stock-still. Harry desperately wishes he could see inside the other boy’s mind. He has no idea what’s going on. But, he reasons with himself, he’d be hesitant, too, if he wasn’t sure if Malfoy really wanted this. And, even though it should be pretty obvious how much Harry is enjoying himself, he hasn’t actually said it out loud, yet. He doesn’t really want to, but if the alternative is them not doing this again… Well…
“Second—What?”
Harry thought about it for a second, an obvious ‘Yes’ on the tip of his tongue. But the more he thought about it, the more he realised they hadn’t had a big fight at all. Sure, they had argued about a few things here and there but it had been nothing like their fights in school.
“Doesn’t matter,” Malfoy mutters.
“Well, sometimes I wish I could just go back. Especially when Rose is being difficult. But I like to be a stay-at-home dad.”
Malfoy’s head whips around to him. His lips are parted and there’s a strange gleam in his eyes. Their gazes lock and neither of them says anything for a few seconds. Harry’s breath catches in his throat, his pulse hammering against his collarbone.
“Hermione brewed it.”
Oh, right. He still looked like an old man. Huh. Malfoy didn’t seem to care.
“Actually, I can relate to a lot of things. Weird, isn’t it?”
Harry has never seen Malfoy move so fast. Without a backwards glance, he storms out of the classroom, his hurried footsteps echoing off the walls.
“Miss Granger, I know you’re worried about your friend and while I’m sure he appreciates your concern, it is my job to take care of him. So will you please let me do my job?”
“The moment you’re withholding something and don’t lay everything on the line, it doesn’t matter that we both agree to it. We’re agreeing to different things.” He brushes a few strands of hair out of Draco’s face. “Look, I understand why you didn’t trust me before, but… do you trust me now?”
Harry bites the inside of his cheek, deliberating only for a moment. In an attempt to lift the mood, he swings his hips again, making sure his crotch is sufficiently covered.
They all watched her stomp outside.
“What are you talking about?” he manages to say, shaking his head. Dumbledore doesn’t answer at first, not until Draco’s eyes find his.
“Otherwise it won’t count,” Harry insists, pulling Draco closer to him again. Draco groans in frustration and curls his fingers around Harry’s throat, as if he’s going to strangle him. He brings their foreheads together, fixing Harry with a glare.
The blond seemed to get the idea and he moved a warm finger down his crack, not before giving the firm globe of his arse a nice squeeze.
He moved his finger over the puckered hole a few times, relishing in the shudders and heavy breathing from his companion. He tried to slide his finger in, but Harry hissed in his ear. His green eyes shut in concentration for a moment before Draco felt magic surround his fingers. Harry nodded at him and he slid his finger once more and this time it was much easier.
”Obviously screwing me will only ever happen in your dreams. I do not get screwed, I screw. That’s not going to change no matter how good of a fuck you are.” He uncrossed his arms and placed them at his sides and felt Harry’s cock twitch at his thigh.
He tried to move his hips away from the boy pressed against him but he only succeeded in creating
Pansy then proceeded to strip in front of everyone to avoid revealing her favourite fantasy and she jumped back into the hot bath, tits bouncing, and called on Hermione. Who had whispered into Dean(who had blushed a viscous shade of red)’s ear what Ron’s secret talent was. Next was Luna, who avoided removing any piece of clothing by revealing that she’d slept with a Slytherin at some point in time. Luna then called on Draco.
To be perfectly fair, the last time someone had entered the castle had resulted in many deaths and severe injuries and though he tried to rationalize, a small part of him refused to believe it could be a coincidence that all this commotion was happening in the potions classroom. The better part of him kept calm and hoped this was all a misunderstanding. Draco Malfoy wasn’t the same scared manipulable boy he had been ten years ago. This
“Are you going to leave?” The sharp tap of an impatient foot brought him back to reality.
—————————————————————
It was already mid-December when Harry and Draco woke up one Saturday morning glued
”What happened, my boy?” She asked him.
”Shove off, Malfoy. I’ve been trying to call a bloody truce and be your friend since September. Don’t tell me this is my fault. You’re the one who’s too stubborn to let go of our last differences. Even the school is trying to tell you to give me a chance. Merlin!” He gestured at their glued body parts.
”Truth: If you had to shag a teacher... life or death situation here, Nev... which one would it be? Can’t answer that you have to swim a lap around the tub with your eyes closed and suck the big toe of whoever you end up in front of.”
”Please, you wish you had a fabulous arse like mine.” Harry retorted simply and the hall erupted into laughter. Harry heard two Hufflepuff girls whisper that Malfoy did, in fact, have a nice bum and therefore Harry Potter was wrong about that.
The spell hadn’t worn off yet when Neville was rushed in covered in what looked like giant hickeys. Madam Pomfrey practically ran to greet him and started casting analysis spells.
When they woke up the next morning, it was still early for a Sunday morning. They were wrapped in each other’s arms on the cold tile floor of the eighth year lavatory. The spell must had worn off in the hours prior while they slept. Harry dragged Draco by the arm to one of the private shower stalls and turned on the water. They were still both butt naked since the night before.
“This is your fault. If you hadn’t took the snitch away from me, we would never have been in this situation.” Malfoy pulled his top half away from Harry in the water and crossed his arms over his chest, glaring.
”Truth?”
“Souvenir.” He simply said before summoning his bathing suit from the night before and leaving.
I hate the press and second, if you truly hated me why’d you bloody shag me this morning?”
Nobody could find Peeves that day and so the pair had to wait in the infirmary for four hours before the spell faded away. Hermione, the bright witch that she was, conjured two backless chaired so they could still manage to do their school work during this time.
“It makes me wonder why they never made a tunnel like this barrier to allow students to wander though the lake for care of magical creatures.” Hermione had said when they’d first examined their new home.
Harry huffed and marched out of the room. He was not obsessed and he would certainly not  resort to
Pansy gasped from her seat on the common room armchair, “They did not both catch it! I seem to recall Potter having it in the end. I am not going to lose the money I placed.”
“You’ve met my father. Figure it out if you’re so curious. Now leave.” He flicked his wand and the door opened to let him out. When Harry didn’t move, Malfoy sat at his desk and rubbed at his temples. Students were staring through the open door, “I have class. If you’re so obsessed with knowing why an imaginary version of my father was shouting obscenities, you know how to stalk me.”
Word travelled fast in the wizarding world. It was a day after Harry had walked into the great hall with Draco’s hand clasped tightly in his when a fluffy black-banded owl landed in Draco’s plate. He’d been sitting in front of Neville, enjoying frustrating him as he refused to believe the source of the boy’s new love bites.
“See, Malfoy? You didn’t even argue the fact that I’m better.” With that Harry backed away and turned to the rest of the students who were still loudly arguing about the outcome of the match and their money, “Guys! No one lost and no one won! Cancel all the bets because I doubt any of you bet it would come out a tie and get on with your day.”
“Now, Peeves.” Professor Flitwick’s high pitched voice cut in. Peeves grumbled but did as told and the two eighth year boys were detached with another orange flare of magic. Harry didn’t move right away but, as soon as the orange glow dimmed, Malfoy scrambled up and to the other side of the now large bed, away from Harry. Harry shivered at the loss of the warm body beside him, suddenly feeling very cold.
The entire school soon knew all about Nevilles run-in with the squid. The hickeys had been mostly healed by Madam Pomfrey but he still had many bruises up and down his arms.
“I’m sorry boys,” Madam Pomfrey said to the two, who were now crammed into a single hospital bed about a half hour after the incident, “you may have to stay this way for a few more hours. The spell that bound you together was cast by Peeves, whose magic is bound to the school’s. It is much more powerful than that of a wizard and unfortunately I cannot risk detaching you myself. It would most likely only complicate your situation.” She ignored their discouraged looks and continued, “However, I have asked Professor Flitwick to track down our poltergeist so he may detach you himself. The spell should only last a couple hours at most, anyway.”
A crowd had formed around the scene where Hermione was now casting spell after spell to try to unstick the pair, but she was unsuccessful. Peeves had disappeared and teachers were running towards them. Professor Flitwick and McGonagall were asking them to stand and to make their way to the hospital wing. However, walking with another body connected to you from your hip to your knee was much much harder than it seemed. Giggles erupted through the crowd as the boys tried to shuffle their way across the pitch and when Harry tried to move his right leg at the same time as Draco moved his own, essentially kicking the blond and himself to the floor once more, the headmistress decided it would be much simpler to levitate the duo and send them off to the hospital wing herself.
“You can’t possibly be disappointed, ‘Mione. It’s Malfoy and Harry! It’s to be expected.” Dean replied, grinning.
“Harry wasn’t the only one who had his life planned out before him. Whether that be good or bad, we should not judge others for mistakes that were thrust upon them.” He’d been uncomfortable when she’d used him as a way to coax the others into mutual understanding, but it had worked and he’d rapidly forgiven her. He had enough trouble dealing with Malfoy and his stubborn refusal to accept his truce, he didn’t need everybody fighting.
