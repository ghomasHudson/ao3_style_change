He missed the pain of it, the burning shame, the near-crippling fear. But more than anything he missed knowing how and when he is going to be hurt, because this? This was absolute mayhem. There were times, whole hours even, when he could swear he was happy.
Malfoy poured some of the potion on his shirt and dabbed his gash and bruise with the liquid, and had to moan in relief when it eased the pain. Harry could see the wound closing up right in front of his eyes. It was making him slightly sick all over again.
“I was aiming at your aunt, actually, after she… killed Sirius. I ran after her and – I wanted to hurt her, to make her pay. It didn’t work. She said I didn’t mean it enough.” He sounded very bitter to his own ears.
“No, never." There was definite blush in his cheeks now, familiar and so damned sweet. Harry felt himself drawing confidence from that.
much more than he could take? But Harry wasn’t done. “Anything you want, Draco, anything that’s in my power, is yours. You have to know that. Whether it’s silly things like sleeping arrangements, or… how do you feel about the moon? Interested?”
There was a slightly evil spark in the grey eyes now. “Oh, there’s no mystery there. There are only two things those two do during holidays; eat and sleep.” He snickered a little to himself. “That’s what they do all year round, as well.”
It seemed like an effort for him to speak. “You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to go. I won't think any less of you – in fact, I will be grateful. Let me do this by myself, I’m begging you.” His eyes glimmered with an emotion so strong, Harry nearly fell off his feet.
In the end the second voice won, only because he really didn’t want another death on his conscience. But at the moment it hardly mattered to him if Malfoy lives or dies; it nearly didn’t matter if he himself lived or died. The only thing keeping him going was his complete and consuming will to make Voldemort pay for what he’s done to him. And that emotion overtook the others finally, because it was stronger than anything else. That was the emotion that took him back to Gryffindor tower and to his bedroom, making him collapse on his bed and draw the curtains shut. He didn’t want to speak to anyone or see anyone, he couldn’t possibly concentrate on anything else. Only the hatred burning in his gut, only the anger moving him forwards. He is going to make him pay, he is going to make them all pay. Voldemort, Snape… Malfoy.
“Perhaps then, yes, but how can I deny it now? We must be reasonable, Potter. You’d do well to remember no one wanted to believe it was true last time, either.”
“No? Aren’t you? When was the last time you bloody faced anything? It’s so much easier for you to focus on how miserable and broken I am, rather than fixing your own problems! You said you wanted to talk about it – but you can’t, can’t open up to anybody, can’t show them you’re vulnerable too. Every time we even go near it, you bail. It’s always poor Draco, he’s so messed up, he needs help… what about you, Potter? What about the help
“Like it?” Potter stared at him, flabbergasted. “I love it. It’s beautiful. I… the M is for Malfoy?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, still breathing rather hard. If Malfoy saw his own father chasing Harry, he said nothing of it. “I – it was clearer to me this time. It felt less like I was in it, more like I was… viewing it from the outside. Like a movie.”
“I do not care what pleases Lucius,” she snarled. “I will be with my son and there is nothing he can do to stop me.”
“What does it say?” Ron asked in a tight voice. Harry was happy for the request to read it out loud, because he didn’t get anything from it even on the fourth and fifth read. His voice was quite hoarse when he spoke.
“Here, have some water,” Harry tipped a glass near his lips, and Draco chugged gratefully. It felt very real, the way the water hit his tongue and a splash ran down his chin since he could hardly manage a gulp. Five-star quality dream. Also, Harry was there. Draco could not have asked for more. “What… Merlin, Draco, what did he do to you?”
Harry just can't seem to lose Malfoy, who is absolutely everywhere. It's not stalking when it's not your fault, right?
to him. Even if only to determine the situation, only just to use him. Not to mention He’d probably want Draco by His side – undoubtedly will, for one reason at least. Perhaps Draco’s actions were unpardonable, enough to drive Him away... but not before he was punished for them, right?
wasn’t exactly right, as he couldn’t see a thing beyond the blackness – but he was willing to let it go. Everything hurt too bad to pay much attention, anyway. There were three things he could focus on, and three only: first was of course the unbelievable, all-encompassing, breathtaking pain. The second was something warm and wet touching his face intermittently, a thing he could not even begin to guess the meaning of. Third – and most important of them all – was the voice he could hear, a voice so beloved and precious it cut through the pain like a machete through butter.
“It sounds great. I kind of like the snow, too. Although when I was a kid snowstorms were the worst, because they meant being stuck in the house with my aunt and uncle.”
He did know that, which made it infinitely worse. “I only wanted to say that you can go, if you’d like. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.”
, Malfoy.” Draco leaped up in amazement. “I was… picturing Voldemort. Because I know he was the real reason you did what you did to me.”
So alive, and so fragile in it, which wasn’t always easy. Who was he kidding; it was probably never easy, never would be, either. But he was practicing, a little, every day. Practicing being okay. Practicing being seen. Practicing being loved. Practicing being shouted at and angry with and hurt, in a way that wasn’t necessarily destructive. Practicing being a human being, being a person, and he was making some headway with that, he thought. He could be going somewhere, perhaps. And at least he wasn’t alone in his journey.
“Oh, there’s no reason for that,” Harry replied easily. “We can just go to the kitchens and grab ourselves something. Just to hold us till then.” His stomach made that awful sound again, and he wanted to bury himself in the covers and never emerge again. But then Draco laughed, actually laughed, and the sound made his heart soar. He looked at him, a little nervous.
, killing Grove, falling into His hands – it was all him just trying to live. No matter how many times a day he fantasized about dying, and the one time he actually did try, and all the little times in between he thought he might. He didn’t. He didn’t die. He didn’t let them kill him, and that made him proud. Of himself. A thing which sounded almost paradoxical, but wasn’t really. Draco was proud of himself for having gone through all of that without ever really giving up.
“No, it’s not that, and you know it. Come on, you know I don’t dislike you anymore. You’re not that dense not to notice it. I may have been trying to fight it, and it may still make me feel very uncomfortable, but I do care about you now.” Harry gave him a pleading look. He was very tense all of a sudden, as if the next words Malfoy would say might determine his destiny. The grey eyes slowly found their way to his.
“Of course not.” He rubbed his face, again this tired and sad little ball of human, and Draco’s chest hurt. “Draco, I don’t… of course not. I don’t want to control you. All I wanted was to help you.”
He could see more and more Aurors in their bright uniform, and it was the first time in many years that the sight didn’t terrify him. Well, it did, but there was so much else to fear at the moment, he didn’t really notice it. The other men – His men – were backing down, it was beginning to look like. Jugson was still on the floor, and Sutherby was tied up in a corner. Yaxley had been thwarted by Harry’s commander, and it looked like Weasley was keeping the other man under control. Still, in all of the mayhem, He wasn’t there. Draco looked everywhere, but he was certain he’d feel His presence without having to see. He couldn’t feel relief yet – the fight would never be over until He is there. Where was He? Where was –
Did Potter know he was going to end back up here? Did he expect Draco to have some sort of a panic attack, to take refuge in his bedroom? And when did he even have the time to do this? He blinked at the note a couple of times. Potter barely had five minutes to himself this morning, and this is what he did? Put a note on Draco’s pillow telling him – telling him what exactly? The library? Was Potter suggesting he goes to the library?
“I realize it may sound mad to you, but please, just listen to the facts. Your boyfriend is a possessive, abusive maniac, and so was Grove, from everything you’ve told me. And they both developed this intense fascination with you, in such a short timeframe – I mean, how likely is that? That they both found you? And you said – you said that your boyfriend was there when you killed Grove, that he was in Grove's house. What was he doing there?”
“Was that why you took every chance you had to break them?” Draco asked in a smirk. Potter looked affronted for a second, and then gave a rolling laugh.
“Aunty Hermione, did you know, when Cousin Draco lived with us, I wasn’t even two years old yet? But I remember that he was very quiet, and he charmed a little mouse to talk to me, and it made funny little noises when it ate cheese – “
“This one, Harry,” Neville shouted and pointed at a figure all the way to the left, not too far from where Harry was crouching. “Ernie, you take that one over there, and Malfoy, cover the one in the corner.”
Nodding, Draco averted his gaze to the window. There were some flowers in the garden right before the cliff edge, charm-protected, arranged in neat little beds that screamed his mother. There was a little butterfly out there, white with orange stripes, and Draco watched it flutter over to the flowerbeds. It landed on a purple iris, the contrast between the colors striking. Draco did a very good job of concentrating on the butterfly alone for about a minute and a half, until Harry swallowed particularly loud.
It felt like days had passed, but in all honesty it could have been under twenty minutes since Draco was dragged into the depth of Azkaban, thrown in a holding cell for ‘questioning’ and left there to rot. There was no way of telling how long it’s been, and at the moment he didn’t really care. All he could concentrate on was drawing each painful breath at a time, and trying to clear his swimming head. Being brought in here meant his two weeks of solitary must have ended, which was very good news. Back there, it seemed like hunger was finally going to win. Out here, Draco may still stand a chance.
It turned out he wasn’t planning to. When the door opened he lunged forward; smoke was coming in big puffs, and for a second Draco didn’t even recognize the incomer. Then it was all a jumble of limbs and hair, and Harry was – did he just
“Neither of us can, really. We’re so used to being joined at the hip. Longest time we spent apart was probably when we were chasing hor- I mean to say, during the war. We had a bit of a row and he split. I was so angry with him, you can’t even imagine. I thought I’d kill him the next time we met.”
“It’s nothing sinister,” Harry quickly assured him, no doubt interpreting correctly Draco’s look of alarm. “They just get you to talk about things, like feelings and bad experiences, that kind of thing, so you can move past them. It can be very, er, effective, actually.”
“Let’s not start talking about what’s pathetic or not, all right, Draco? I don’t think you really have a leg to stand on here. And in regards to your ‘boyfriend’, that’s just - ”
iness of it all. He needed answers – he needed – using the last of his rage-born courage Draco shook his head, as impertinent as he could be. To his surprise, it seemed to be working. “All right. I suppose – after all, I suppose you do deserve an explanation.”
Potter scuffed the carpet with his shoe. “Jesus, Malfoy, calm down. You don’t have to be so bloody dramatic about this.”
Harry gave him a sad smile. “If it’s potions, I’m afraid I can’t help. I’m pretty rubbish in that department.”
“Good.” He wasn’t wrong. Potter’s smile returned to its natural place and his eyes were normally warm again. “I’m glad. I thought there’d be more – I don’t know – quarreling. But I’m glad you know I mean it.” He made as if to touch Draco on the shoulder, saw the complete terror in his eyes, and mastered himself quickly. He understood, Draco had no doubt; there could be touching between them, but only when it was absolutely necessary, and only by Draco’s initiation. For some reason, he trusted Potter to respect that. Either Draco was a blithering idiot – most likely he was a blithering idiot – or he was right. It didn’t much matter anyway, since if Potter did want to touch him, Draco would never openly defy him or fight. It would just… well, break every little green bud of hope for himself he’d been cultivating, that’s all. Trample it with a big black boot and burn the ground afterwards. But Draco was used to that concept, basically lived inside that feeling, and so he was resigned to accept it as his due.
“I can’t, I can’t,” and it was true, he couldn’t. Rutgrass will be in Azkaban still, and Parker and Field… and fuck, fuck
“Because I could,” the shadow answered, and a chill went down Draco’s back. It didn’t sound like Him, not precisely – and with a jolt of anxiety Draco realized he didn’t remember exactly what He sounded like at all. It sounded a lot more like that
He definitely was shaking now; the cot made a terrible noise as it rattled beneath him. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. He was so tired, so unbelievably exhausted, drawing each breath seemed a hassle. He was so filthy, still able to feel His blood all over him. He was so
“I’m not sure. When the Dark Lord said Harry’s last name, it was like something clicked into place in me. But it still wasn’t… it wasn’t enough. There were other words, things he said about me, about him, and it was becoming a little sharper. And then when he said his first name – actually, it was the nausea. I felt it again and it helped clear everything else. It brought me back.”
“Thanks, Potter. I was worried I might get a permanent scar or something. I don’t know if I could have made it to Madam Pomfrey quick enough.”
“Okay. I’m going to give you a few seconds to clear your mind again, and then I'll begin. Remember, Potter; it’s really not so complicated. Just think about something that is naturally a part of you. Think about it, until you think of nothing.”
“There were a few murders recently, seemingly unrelated… a break-in at the apothecary in Diagon Alley… then there was this gathering on Wednesday, ending with thirteen dead at a Muggle birthday party. And the Albanian group – I really can’t tell you much more, but it’s all grim. Very grim.”
“You did it, Potter! You were able to block me there! I mean you did use your wand, but it was still something!”
in the only kind of timeframe Draco could face. Potter, for whom Draco tried so hard to keep even a shred of his sanity. The man who gave him a purpose. The man who wanted him to be bloody warm. When Draco arrived at the flat that Sunday afternoon, Potter was already waiting at the door.
He can’t be falling into that now, can’t lose himself to this rabbit hole. He needed to stay fucking present and somehow fix this. But what could he do? There was nothing to do right now… perhaps other than getting to the bottom of this whole thing. With a sigh Draco lowered himself to the carpet in between all the documents and started browsing through them. “What's all this, then?”
“Hush now. However I might dislike it, you have given me no other choice. After having seen everything, I fear… but you must have known. You could not have possibly expected anything else.”
would never give up a truly-deserved punishment. And it’s not like He was one to wait out His anger so well.
uttered in a sorrowful gasp. There was no other sound in the whole entire world; all four of them must have been holding their breaths. For a moment there was absolutely no movement either, only the trickle of blood, thin, drop after maroon drop falling silently. It was oddly mesmerizing. Then, grimly, He turned to Draco and placed the blade in his trembling fingers. “Now you,” He said, not ungently. Draco thought he might actually die.
“I was the one who brought him there in the first place,” Draco whispered to his hands. “It was my fault he was in danger.”
“What?” Grove’s acting was off the charts; he sounded almost broken up about it, as if he really hoped this would get him anywhere. Draco never felt so confused in his life. The man he knew would never take being spoken to like that. With disdain? He’d never – not ever. He would be having Harry on the floor and hitting him repeatedly with the worst possible. Why was this Grove – what was he trying to pull? What the hell was he doing? “You can’t – Field told me you were still off because of it!”
What could he say to him, after that? After not only seeing but actually feeling this black hole that surrounded Draco? After understanding the intensity of the pain he was under? Could he even be mad at him, could he blame him for anything? Harry’s thoughts raced in his mind so fast, it was hard to untangle a single one from the mass. Draco did all this to try to save his mother from being murdered. How could Harry blame him for that? And then – he changed his mind. He chose Harry. For he could understand what that meant now, he could understand what a huge, unbelievable sacrifice that must have been for him. And to think that he actually did it – to think that he would put himself through that – it was more than Harry could take.
He used to. For many, many years, he blamed himself. Every day and every night, when he didn’t think about it, when he was still somehow thinking about it even when he didn’t. He blamed himself. Draco was so weak – he was such a coward – he was so pathetic, and so dirty, and he deserved everything that’s happened to him because he
“Is there a way to make sure?” Lucius asked with some desperation. “Is there a way to ensure we know who this is?” Snape nodded.
“Yes, it does have a bit of a strong effect,” Malfoy laughed and turned to face Harry. “But the best part about it is that it makes you absolutely, utterly smashed. I don’t suppose goody-good Harry Potter ever got drunk before.”
“I love pumpkin pie. My mother makes the best one in the world. I’d wait for Halloween every year just to eat it.”
Two hours and a half later found him very nearly in tears, kneeling on the floor next to the toilet. He simply could
“Silence,” The Potions master collected himself. He looked at the man and then back at the boys. “Peter, I need a moment alone with my students.”
Draco looked down at the golden cuff and shook his head. It wasn’t even activated, he realized now. The mere presence of it was enough to stop him from trying – He didn’t even need to cast the spell; He knew Draco would be cowed out of any attempt just by seeing it. Draco was such a pathetic fuck, that he let a
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he stayed quiet. He was angry with Lucius, same as always, but now it was from a slightly different angle. When choosing to join Voldemort he didn’t only entangle his own life with his; he had to take his family with him. And even though it was Malfoy, who was probably just as evil as anyone he had ever known, it was still incredibly unfair.
Did he want to go? No, not really. The news of his being alive had only been made public three days ago, and he was still receiving far too much attention for his liking. The thought of being around so many people, most of whom he didn’t know – or even worse, knew in the before – was nerve-wracking in the worst way possible. But he wasn’t not going, either. He would never do that to Harry.
Draco thought again about how much he owed Him, how He saved him in His own unique way. That it was harsh, brutal even, sometimes outright cruel – didn’t mean all that much. It worked, after all. Before Potter came along, Draco hardly ever thought of Azkaban. Didn’t need to think about it. He was almost entirely free of it, since he gave him all to Him. Leaving all the pain and trauma in His hands was in many ways releasing it. And now that it was all back, and Draco was alone again, it proved too hard to push away.
“I must?” Lucius repeated, swiftly detaching himself from the wall and looking at his son with interest. The torchlight danced and flickered on his pale face, making it look more colorful, lively, yet his eyes still looked dead. “I don’t think there is anything I
“Clever, on top of everything,” Harry’s smile widened. “I know that, you dolt. You’re you. I want you.”
“Er – we could come back later, Harry,” Hermione said in a tiny voice, already pushing Ron back out. “Yes, I think we will.”
“My son got in the way,” Lucius said evenly, and Draco wasn’t even surprised. He told Harry long ago; he always knew his father would not hesitate to hand him over to be used as cover. Right now, in the total mess that was left of him, Draco hardly even felt the pain. Lucius didn’t seem remotely upset. Draco would not have expected him to.
Still. There was being disobedient, there was being dumb, there was being suicidal, and then there was total fucking lunacy. Draco had
“He’s my son, Bella!” the woman snapped, finally letting her silvery eyes leave Harry’s face. Fire danced in them now, and Harry could breathe again. She looked so defeated before, so broken, he thought they might have been too late. But now he could see she still possessed some of her force. “You cannot keep him away from me. I must speak to him. I must.”
Potter worried the fabric of his shirt. There was an odd look in his eyes. “You sound funny when you talk about him,” he said reluctantly, almost like he was confessing it against his will. Draco pulled himself back to the present.
Suddenly he was out of air; his bound hands struggled to reach for his throat, and his eyes were bulging in his face. “I said you don’t talk to him, Macnair. Forgot already? And here I was, thinking you were halfway intelligent.” Harry lifted the spell a few seconds later, and Grove’s eyes were still far too wide. “Draco’s not going to say a word in your defence, you sick, sick bastard. Why would you even think… All right, say you didn’t actually kill Grove. How much do you reckon that’d knock off your time, three years? Five? Ten? What’s that compared to, what, three life sentences, was it?” his glee was forced and entirely humorless.
The next evening he went to see Dr. Radford, so he didn’t plan to go on a walk (not that he wanted to, not after last night, not after that look on Harry’s face). But when he Portkeyed back with Mother, Harry hurried to him as always, then asked him to come out to the garden.
He took a moment to think. “You called him Potter, my Lord.” The dark haired boy looked absolutely broken. His face was covered in tears and snot and Draco thought that maybe, maybe he really did know him in the past, maybe he knew him very well. He kept thinking that if he could put his hand on him, like he did on his wand, then he would know. The fog shifted and swayed inside him.
Draco choked a little over something invisible in throat. To hear Potter apologize for being insensitive was like hearing a Bludger apologize for smashing your nose. He sighed. “It wasn’t all you. I should have kept back, not risen to your bait. I lashed out on you as if it was your fault, when in fact it was every bit my own. So I guess I’m sorry too.”
Sighing, Draco looked back at the window. He could see movement, dishes and cutlery magically setting themselves on the table, the hint on Mother’s long hair. He was going to tell them today, he decided as he tried to catch his breath. Why wait? The shouting match did nothing if not strengthen his resolve. They had asked a few times, the collective ‘they’, though Andromeda more insistently than the rest. And so far he was very careful about not giving a direct answer. But he did spend the last month thinking about it, and he thought he might have an idea now.
“You – He’s not big or bad, but He will destroy you if He thought you were trying to come between us. I’d seen Him do it before, when His colleagues tried to insinuate… things about me. And they were people He worked with, so He showed some restraint. I don’t even want to imagine… please.”
know what he was talking about. He cocked an eyebrow at him and gave Malfoy his best confused look. “Cut the crap, Potter. You’ve been undressing me with your eyes. It could not have been any clearer.”
“Just that ever since we started – er, spending all this time together…” Harry felt his cheeks burn as he didn’t meet either of their gazes, “I’ve been – I’ve not been as focused on Sirius anymore. I feel like I… I don’t know. Forgot about him, or something.”
Halfway through dinner came the time for speeches. Being the best man, Harry got the floor first, and he got up from the table where they sat (in her infinite wisdom, Hermione decided not to put them in the top table). He cleared his throat a few times before he could manage a word.
“No, Harry. Dobby, you don’t need to do it. Going near my father is bad enough, but the company he keeps is even worse. You shouldn't take that risk.”
“Riddle, Tom Riddle.” Harry’s eyes widened when it was evident the name said nothing to Draco. “You know, Voldemort? That was his real name.”
“Are we going to do this, then, Lucius? Not that I’m not enjoying the little stare-down, but…” Greyback’s voice brought them both back in an instant.
The bedroom was small and neat. It was only a few doors down the from Potter’s, with nothing but a bed and a wardrobe, but Draco felt off from the get-go. The wallpaper was a light cream, cheery and clean, and it was wrong. The floor was bare, no carpet, and it was wrong. There was an adjoined bathroom with a yellowing claw-foot tub, and it was wrong. And the most wrong of it all was sitting on the bed and pretending like he was going to sleep there.
He said the wrong thing, and he knew it straightaway. The smile was replaced by a pained expression. “Fuck, Malfoy, I’m so sorry. I’m such an idiot.”
at him? That was a rather odd reaction. Draco’s eyes narrowed with suspicion. “You have grown quite a bit, I see, my boy. Well. Our Lord has done fine work with you, after all.” He clapped stunned Draco on the shoulder once, then took a step back and gave him an appraising look. “You are very thin, Draco. Thin and weak looking. You have to regain your strength if you plan to overtake Harry Potter any time soon.”
“I’m Draco’s girlfriend,” she said in a tiny voice, and pulled herself up. “I’m – very sympathetic towards Draco’s goal. My father told me all about it and I – well – I wanted to help.”
“Crucio,” he said, and a green light emerged from his wand and hit the bug square on. It made a nervous little twitch, then started running away towards the edge of the table. Harry sighed once more. ”See? It’s not going to work. Come on, it’s late, let’s just give it a rest.”
“You’re so full of shit,” Harry cried, the fool. “You don’t love him. He’s just a – a possession, a pet to you. Get a fucking hamster and get over it. Let me make myself clear: you let Draco go, I’ll make it easy for you. You don’t, I’ll fight you every step of the way.”
“You know you can’t be with Draco! Lucius will be coming here too – he will not be pleased to see you together – “
“Stop. Stop it, I don’t want to hear you anymore – go away, leave, I don’t want you here. I don’t want to – “
Maybe he knew about all of it. The nightly visits to his cell. The speech they had him say every mealtime. How Grove made him kneel all day long. How he spanked him in the corridor in front of the entire ward – how they spelled the words
“No problem, Harry,” Hermione whispered, and Ron clapped his shoulder very tenderly, though it still hurt like hell. “You should really rest a little now. Do you want some Dreamless Sleep or something?”
from him. His anger, already roaming freely everywhere, was upsurging incredibly fast. Draco held the bracelet in his hand and waited for something dramatic to happen.
The man hissed something in return that he didn’t quite catch. “Tell me the truth, Draco. What is going on here exactly? Where is Potter?”
Draco didn’t even know what he was talking about anymore, and of course that wasn’t what he thought, but he didn’t know how to take it back, either. Not without betraying Him completely, and he’s done enough of that already. “That’s not what I – you’re missing my point, Potter.”
Oh, good gods, the sappy fool. Draco wanted to smother him. Still his voice softened unwillingly as he said, “Harry. I… you don’t need to worry about me. I’m going to… I’ll rise from this, as well.”
“How about the three of you and Dobby?” Draco asked, finally having returned. He handed each of them a vial of a different colored potion. Harry’s was pure silver, like Draco’s eyes in the moonlight. It was by far the most pleasant looking one – Ron’s one was puke colored, and Hermione’s a horrid pink. He looked at Draco with a measuring look.
“Never mind, it’s a Muggle thing. Give me a second, I need to find something else to focus on.” Malfoy nodded and waited as Harry looked around. It wasn’t that much different than thinking of a happy memory in order to summon a Petronus. He just needed to think hard and focus, that’s all. And it's only Malfoy in front of him, not Snape who was only ever looking to hurt him. He felt himself calming steadily. He took another couple of deep breaths. “Okay.”
That was news to Draco. He didn’t know he was broken. Now, peering within himself, he wondered what it meant. He used to be different? He was more than this once, more than just the white fog and the fire and the red-eyed master? The familiar ceiling and the Potter boy… yes, yes, there was more, he was more. He was
Potter shrugged. “I can fix it. Would do me good, I think, to have a project. And there’s Floo and portkeys and besides, I can apparate wherever I need. That is… I dunno, I wanted to hear your opinion. What do you think of it?”
Dumbledore’s nod was like an elbow to his stomach. Suddenly that odd night came into a completely different view. “I was under the impression he would tell you himself. I thought it might be best if you two spoke about it, without my interference.” Dumbledore’s eyes were large and mournful. “At this meeting with him, Harry, I had some very difficult questions to pose. I used Legilimency to the best of my abilities, and a little bit of Veritaserum too. I forced him, in a manner of speaking, to make his choice now; either go to the Dark Lord and attempt to reach you, or surrender himself fully and face the repercussions of his actions. He chose the latter. He chose you.”
“How about – fifteen pounds?” this type of bouquet usually went for thirty, but Daniel’s grin returned.
It really wasn’t, but Draco couldn’t go any faster. Saying all this felt a lot like taking his clothes off in front of all of them, and for a terrible second he wondered which would actually be worse. Shame was scorching hot in his abdomen. “What I’m trying to – there were a lot of things He used in order to, er, control me. A lot. Looking back it’s almost impossible to… He really was so good at it.” Draco’s fingers ran over his left arm in vain search of a bracelet that wasn’t there. “It might have actually been His idea. Why else would He have bleach in there? It’s not like He cleaned the house the Muggle way. Maybe He wanted to push me to the edge, maybe it was a part of the plan.”
“Heard it before, I think. Now come on, give me what I want, or I won’t have any choice but to threaten you again.” His smile was absolutely diabolical. Malfoy glared at him, furious, then rolled his eyes and let out a heavy sigh.
“I insist on it.” So he will be in trouble – so fucking what? He was already going to be in a world of pain so deep, probably nothing mattered anymore. “Please, it’s the least I can do.” He meant it, too. Keeping Draco’s secret was not supposed to be Potter’s burden. And on top of that… he couldn’t shake the feeling of imminent danger.
, does that terrify you? Do you find that revolting? I promise you I had been called every single name possible, so you can’t possibly offend me. Still, I suggest you try your hardest. I’ve seen the way you people throw insults, I expect to be highly entertained.”
Draco’s look of misery made for something thick and painful in Harry’s stomach, but thankfully shock was able to cover most of it. “You bloody idiot. I thought something happened
“Only took a little bit of soul-crushing, and here we are,” Malfoy said cheerily, but his smile was a little vacant. “Ha, do you remember the time I got you in detention last year?”
Harry shook his head, his throat feeling a little tight all of a sudden. But Malfoy seemed more vulnerable than his usual self, and Harry really wanted to reciprocate the favor. “No, not much. I grew up completely separated from anything having to do with them, and there was no one ever really to ask. I got a photo album of theirs as a present once from Hagrid. I’ve never had pictures of them before.” It was very odd to be saying so much; speaking about his parents was something he very rarely did. Malfoy gave him a sympathetic look, and Harry was only a little stunned, which was on its own perplexing. To think that he’d come to expect
Something in him ached, around the region where he imagined his heart lay behind the fog. The fog which was still thinning rapidly. He could nearly see it now. Draco closed his eyes and took stock of what he knew. Graceful, mad, cruel. Wonderful, brilliant, terrible. Witty, brave, good.
And oh, gods, of course. “No,” Draco breathed, all of a sudden comprehending. It took this long, but he finally understood. It took
“Urgh, are we still taking that?” Ron asked mournfully, but he only received a stern, slightly Mrs. Weasley-ish look from Hermione, so he packed his things and got up. “Oh, all right then… better go, mate.”
“Then don’t bloody die.” There was no twinkle in his eyes, no smile on his face. He looked somber and austere. “Please don’t come with me. Please. I’m begging you. Don't do this to me.”
Draco could barely swallow as he made his way to the shop, since apparently his throat had temporarily closed for construction. He thought of what he would have to do later today, if Potter really does show. He hadn’t spoken about Azkaban in – well, never, to anyone but Him. In all honesty, Draco wasn’t certain he was able to. There was too much…
him, but he didn’t really. Harry didn’t know the first thing about him, the most crucial thing of all. He didn’t know where Draco’s heart still lay. He didn’t know Draco was not his own to give. He didn’t know shit about what was happening inside him, constantly, ruthlessly ripping him to shreds. He didn’t know, and he fucking needed to, because this was too bloody much. Water filled every crevice and slit in him, the shackles tore his skin, the iron curtain was crumbling and everything was
“In a manner of speaking,” Malfoy said quickly. “It was more to make a point rather than anything else. Then he made me promise not to go to Madam Pomfrey, and that was that. Are you happy now? Am I finally excused?”
“I came to bring you these,” Potter pushed the papers forward. Draco spotted a handsome country house before he returned to look at him. “It’s about your mother. It’s got some more details than I could give you last night, and it looked like you wanted to know.”
? His inner voice sounded disturbingly like Hermione. But she was right – meaning, he was right – Harry can’t just go there. He needs a plan, he needs something more concrete than ‘and then we just storm the place and win’. This was what failed them the last time, no? but Harry just couldn’t settle down long enough to formulate any plan through. He was lost without Ron and Hermione, and Dumbledore said they can’t visit him at the moment. He needed them, damn it, he needed them so badly, and he had no idea what to do without them. He had no idea what to do, in general. His desperation brought yet another wave of sluggishness and he plopped back down on the sofa. His head was burning and he closed his eyes once more.
“I trust you all will be able to stop me. And if not – “ he drew a deep breath. “I can’t keep going like this. I can’t. I’m sorry.”
“Is that true? You never know?” The fingers were cold against the delicate skin and he was seized by a sharp, dizzy sort of nausea.
“Yes, very good. Next time let’s do my tendency to leave my hat at the shop. My ears never forgive me when I do that.”
“I’m not doing it for him,” he said, starting to feel like a broken record. And it was the honest to God truth: he wasn’t doing this for Malfoy. He couldn’t care less about the boy. But he sorely, desperately needed a distraction; he needed something to focus his anger on. And this was too good of an opportunity to miss: he got to upset Malfoy and learn about Voldemort, all at the same time.
Dying always felt like a letdown, like giving up. Even when he felt proud of himself, he thought the time with the bleach meant failure. But maybe there was a way to do it which wasn’t giving up. Maybe this time he could make the right choice. Even if it was the last thing he wanted to do, even if he was afraid. Maybe he could be afraid, but still not let it stop him. Maybe he wasn't going to let it stop him.
“I’m sorry to say that I will. I highly doubt I would enjoy it, but… needs must.” He started stroking himself lazily, and Draco’s eyes nearly popped out of his skull.
It must have been morning already, and the only thing that was still clear was Harry next to him. Without thinking, and out of sheer fright, Draco turned to him and took his hand. Harry held it, grounding, painful, familiar, warm, and Draco was so scared, so scared,
“You and Hermione. I mean, come on, it’s only been there ever since fourth year. It just happens to be Valentine's day - when are you actually going to do something about it?”
“I don’t want to take the potions anymore,” Draco declared one night, a week before Ron and Hermione’s wedding, and everyone stopped what they were doing. Pansy and Hermione, looking over some work papers, glanced up at him with surprise. Theo and Ron, in the middle of a very dramatic exploding snap match, turned towards him. Harry, still in his work shirt, paused halfway through making dinner. Narcissa put her book aside, and Blaise came in from the garden, his cigarette still smoking.
“Look, Malfoy, it doesn’t matter, all right? Your dad told you everything that happened, you don’t need me to repeat it. He and his precious Dark Lord had me cornered, and I only just managed to escape. So do you think you can just shut up about it already?” Harry was really on edge. He was very abruptly reminded of the fact that he was actually sitting in front of someone who was raised by a Death Eater, someone who in himself had received a task from Voldemort. “Maybe we really should give this thing a rest for now.”
“Nothing, and I’m not, it’s just really hot in here. Shut up about that already.” Harry stretched his legs, feeling weirdly uncomfortable. “God, it really is hot in here.” He was becoming aware of the fact his body seemed to want to get closer to Malfoy. He fought it hard.
“Come on, Draco,” the voice was unusually soft. “You know yourself what you are. What you require. You could never stand a chance on your own, you’d never be enough. Look at you! What could anyone possibly find in you besides a willing slave? What else do you have to offer?”
“Fuck, Potter, yes. I want to.” He lay flat against Harry’s chest and looked down at him with bloody affection that made for a warm surge down his abdomen. “Is this okay?”
Startled out of his wits he turned to Hermione. “I’m not feeling very well. I think I’ll go up and lay down a little.”
“But you jumped in to take up the reins anyway? You’re so used to being the bloody poster-boy that you’d take that one too? Or, I’m sorry, have they perhaps made you Head Auror and I’ve not really been paying attention?”
Draco was again too stunned to know what to do. This was a simple gesture, and it was more than he’d gotten in years. For a second he just blinked at Potter, who began to eat in a way that was almost barbaric. “What is it? Not hungry?” It was hard to understand him through the mountain of chips he was trying to conquer.
“No, that’s not what – I just meant, I wouldn’t always choose you. Not over anything. You always put me first, but I can’t be like that, not… I
going to think about. Ha, did you really think he would fall for that? No chance. Draco breathed through his teeth and let anger flood him, grounding, necessary anger. His heart had better stop racing like that, he was no fucking cheetah. His hands had better unclench from their fists, and those little beads of dread had better stop building in his stomach. Nothing happened, and there was no reason for his body to act up like it did. So he heard his father’s name, so what? So Harry’s commander seemed to think he was alive. It meant nothing. It changed nothing. It – it was nothing. Draco didn’t have to think about it, he was reprieved, and no one was going to force him to, because he was safe here. Right? he was safe. The only threat was the one contained within his own head.
The wet thing returned to gently touch his face, and Draco wondered blearily if He somehow forgave his manic outburst and was cleaning him again. But he sobered quickly – there was no chance in living hell He’d forgive so easily, not for something like
“So you disagree? You think it’s perfectly safe, that it won’t be reckless to go there before we know the situation better?”
“Right, to have the option. Always with your little plots of rescue and choice. But you will never really trust me, will you? You will never treat me as anything but a poor soul who needs saving! I will not be your victim! I will not lay on the railroad for you to fly me away! I simply refuse to grovel at your feet any longer!”
Harry almost laughed. “Oh, that is so precious. I'm not scared of a little tumble with you, Malfoy. I’ve already faced your dad, and he’s supposed to be a little tougher than you.”
The waves of orgasm brought him higher and higher, and it took around forever to be able to breathe again. He was in absolute bliss; nothing in the whole world could dampen his spirits now. He slowly pulled out of Draco and lay by his side, wrapping him tightly in his arms.
“I brought shame on the Malfoy house?” Draco couldn’t help but sneer. Usually he would cower in a combination of shame and fear before him, but not now, not because of this. “It seems like the
“That doesn’t matter. Draco – you realize why you had to be punished, right? You know why this happened?”
Another torture spell was cast at him and changed his opinion right back up. It was a fact; Lucius Malfoy was nothing but an evil bastard. Draco found his tongue just fine this time, and he yelled with all the force still in him, panting and heaving on the floor to which he slid, back against the wall. When the curse was lifted and he could breathe once more, his father approached.
Malfoy’s shoulders dropped, and he suddenly looked so miserable, it physically shot through Harry’s stomach. “I'm not good. You don’t understand me, you don’t know what I can... I’m not good,” he shook his head. “I’ve accepted it already, a while back. But then you started bloody – never mind. It doesn’t matter.” His grey eyes seemed a little misty.
“Draco!” Lestrange exclaimed, her anger becoming clearer. “You need to be careful how you speak in front of outsiders –“
The shock he felt to be called by his name at that moment was something Draco could not even entirely understand. And to hear it again, and again, and again… He considered not opening the door at all, just letting Potter stand there and say his name over and over with growing concern. But after about a minute he felt stable enough to get up, and did in fact open the door. The man on the other side was holding a stack of newspapers in one hand and a brown paper bag in the other.
. Why did he have to do this, hurt Harry, worry him, and for this? For the sake of torturing himself in the woods? What the fuck was the benefit here? He completely lost it. Dr. Radford was a madwoman, and should have her license revoked. This was a terrible idea
When they were wet and famished enough they returned to the castle, where Harry dried their cloaks, and went to lunch. Snape wasn’t at the castle at all so they sat together at the Gryffindor table, although Malfoy kept periodically sending alarmed looks at the front door. But when he wasn’t - Harry looked at him as he spoke, so freely and lightly, and noticed how Malfoy wasn’t even paying attention to the fact he was eating. It was no longer an ordeal, like every other day when Harry spotted the boy from across the room. Now he seemed so content, or at least distracted, that even eating was simple. Harry felt it warming his heart almost to a boiling point.
“I’m so sorry, my love,” He said, and Draco didn’t expect that either. Dazedly he blinked a few too many times.
brought him back to his senses, and he just spotted the smoke from the corner of his eye. He turned his awed head to Draco, who’s wand was still drawn, and wore a devilish smile on his face. “Don’t worry,” he assured him. “I have your back.”
“I am, and I have no clue what you’re on about! I’m not testing you. I’m not trying to annoy you. I’m not trying
Draco gave him a suspicious nod, then caved. “You can wait in the back room if you want. It’s too damn cold outside.” Potter retired to the back, leaving Draco to wonder just what kind of an idiot he really was. Potter, Potter, that pesky little Potter, always coming when he didn’t need him, didn’t want him… But Potter who was real and who was here… how tormentingly baffling. Draco closed the shop in a very distracted state of mind and as quickly as he could. It was incredibly stressful to know there was someone in the store with him, and it being Potter only made it worse. At five o’clock he’d already finished everything and went to collect the man who was practically bent double on the sofa.
“I never should have disappeared on you like that. I – fuck, I’m so sorry, you have to believe me. I can’t even tell you how bad, I – I didn’t know if I can control myself, and I didn’t want to scare you. I’m so, so sorry.”
of it. The torture. The degradation. The fucking dehumanization, the humiliation, the rape. The complete and total annihilation of the self. It was all Him, everything – all of it – the man Draco thought he loved
? What in the world… Shaking rather hard he opened the door. Potter stood there, fist in the air like he was just about to knock again, his eyebrows drawn and his mouth a thin line. It felt a little like he was going to hit him. For a second Draco wondered if he really would. He also wondered how he’d react to that; would he fall on his knees and beg for mercy? Or perhaps for more?
His Quidditch skills were the sole reason the glass wasn’t currently on the floor. “What?” Harry gasped in utter shock.
“Right,” he replied dryly, looking up at them. “Still, one must marvel at the chances… Mr. Malfoy, may I have a moment of your time? There’s something I wish to discuss with you regarding your Quidditch team.”
“I see you tried to cook something?” he asked, and Draco felt two red spots of heat blossom on his cheeks. This day would just never bloody end. He practically ran into the kitchen after him, but Potter didn’t look like he was mocking him. There was a smile on his face, but not a bad one.
“Not in the slightest.” Mother patted the blanket above Draco’s knee. “Of course we don’t always agree on everything, but that was never the point. We’re so sorry, dearest – we never meant to put you in the middle. We simply wanted you to know you always had a choice. We’ll try to do better, I promise.”
Dream-Harry had this misery around the eyes that would break awake-Draco’s heart faster than anything. “I should've known. You didn’t want to leave, I made you do that, and then he was free to just… I sent you right to him. Draco, I’m so sorry. You have no idea.”
The seconds until the little creature returned with the box were the worst in Draco’s life. Potter looked better than he did in His corridor, true, but still incredibly weak and probably in a life-threatening condition. Why, why didn’t the tosser just go to the hospital, instead of sentencing himself to dying here? Does he not know Draco can’t take him? Does he not know he can’t save him?
Draco couldn’t bear to look at him; it was so much worse that Harry made him say all that, that he wouldn’t just trust him, that instead of listening he had to tear this confession out of him, which cost a lot to his way past ruined psyche. But then the silence lasted too long and in the end he had no choice but look. What he saw made him physically hiss.
Potter didn’t seem like it was easier for him to hear than it was for Draco to say. “He made you do it. Hurting people. All those things.”
“I’m very happy to have my magic back,” Harry insisted. “It’s been such an important part of me for so long, I really couldn’t imagine my life without it. I used to think it was the most important part of me, too. But turns out it’s not.”
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “You have nothing to worry about, Potter. You’re special enough, yes, but no one will make you Head Auror before you’re thirty-four.”
“You have grown,” the man said, stroking his cheek in an almost loving manner. “The boy I remember would never have dared speak to me like this. He would have bowed his head and waited for his punishment obediently.”
“You should be glad this is all I’m doing, Malfoy. I could always go to Dumbledore and have you practically executed, instead. You're lucky to be receiving my mercy.”
“How did you…” the wand was perfect, absolutely perfect. Lighter, slightly longer than his last, it fit him like a glove, like it was molded around his core. It touched the innermost part of his magic and formed around it, stable, quiet, powerful. Everything Draco wanted. Everything he didn’t dare imagine having.
it. He rubbed his eyes, furious and confused and bloody sick of it all. It was too much for one person. The Dark Lord’s red eyes, Grove’s blue, His brown. It was too, too, too much, and he was too, too, too small, and he had had enough… he couldn’t take it any longer…
Potter took a deep breath. “Yeah, you’re right. Sorry.” There was the awkward silence between them Draco was beginning to miss. He let it linger for some time, fingers toying with his bracelet nervously, before making an effort to break it.
“You really hate them, don’t you?” Malfoy sounded a little surprised. “I never would have thought the great Harry Potter had it in his heart to hate anyone.”
, his mind quipped, and Draco wanted to slap himself to shut up, but his wrists were chained behind his back. Ah. He hadn’t noticed that before. Shackles – his ankles were attached to the wall behind him, and his wrists must have been fixed to some pole, because when he moved his shoulders he could hear the chain rattle against something metallic. Draco looked down at his body now. There was barely an inch of white skin there; every piece of him was bruised, burnt, torn open, or simply missing. There was a gaping hole in his hip where Greyback scraped a chunk of his flesh with his nails, and it was still bleeding profusely. His ankle was sprained, and both legs had fractures: his right shin was protruding from his flesh in a maddening white, and his left was twisted very awkwardly. Damn it, he shouldn’t have looked; now that he had, the pain only became that much worse. The feeling of a burning colony of rabid fire ants in his legs nearly drove him off the edge, and he was this close to passing out again. No. He needed to use this time he was alone, he needed to stay present, and he needed to find a bloody way out of here.
who’s abused at least half the prison, probably? The man was very obviously spooked, and Draco tried to tell himself it made him feel better. But he knew the truth; trapped animals give a brutal fight. If Grove felt this was his only chance, he sure was going to take it. For a second he thought he’d lose it and throw up again, all over himself, but at the very last second he caught himself and desisted. He couldn’t afford to show the smallest sign of weakness in front of him.
“I’m sure we can evade him. Maybe we can poison him over Christmas dinner and make him ill for a few days. Or we could just kill him.” His eyes glinted malevolently.
, of course, of course that was it! He pulled back from Harry with some difficulty, placing a hand on Harry’s chest, right above his heart.
? because of what’s happened to him? That was exceedingly strange. The people who knew what happened to him until now used it to get whatever they wanted from him. They never cried for him. They didn’t even feel sorry.
Finally he managed to stumble inside, blinking his eyes that didn’t see much, not entirely due to the darkness. There was no light in the living room, and the bedroom door was still closed. Was he alone? “Sir?” he tried in a tense whisper, then a little louder, “Sir?” no response. He must have been alone then. Draco sighed, took off his coat and hung it on the rack. The flat was bloody freezing, almost as bad as outside, and Draco wistfully thought of warming charms as he lowered himself to his knees in his corner of the living room. Gods, warming charms. And that little ball of flame he could conjure, too, and carry around in his pocket all day. Oh, and the warming potion that made your breath come out in purple puffs... Draco always loved those, ever since his days as a student in the frigid Slytherin dungeons, but now he was partial to them all. Every charm, spell or hex, every incantation or potion he could think of, all came with that bitter-sweet taste to them. Now that he couldn’t use magic at all he really understood how precious, how dear it was to him. He always knew it was essential – from the day he was born magic was in the very air he breathed. But he never really grasped how personal it was to hold a wand, how gloriously delicious it was to use this power. He didn’t know until his wand was taken from him and broken in two.
. There was nothing really to do, but still, the slashing dread made his mouth open in some sort of plea –
“Very well, Potter. I like you. You are an insufferable git, and every second I spend in your presence is torture, but somehow I still like you. And although you are even worse than I had imagined all these years,
“This particular kind wouldn’t have killed me. I told you, Harry; He was extremely calculating. The thorn apple would have saved my life, while the poison He created could work uninterrupted, infused within the regenerating components. He didn’t want me dead, simply to have another way to exercise control." he could tell just by the way the others were breathing they didn't understand yet. Oh, Merlin... Draco bucked up whatever courage he still possessed. "Poisons based on a human source usually only affect a certain part of the brain – they can interfere with a person’s lingual abilities, or affect the use of a body part. The poison He made took my magic. Or didn’t quite take, but made it inaccessible – though not entirely. I’d get bursts of it back, every time I’d be given a…” the words burned on his lips and he couldn’t, he couldn’t go any further.
“I just…” Harry didn’t quite know what to say. “I know it can be different for you, Malfoy. I know you could be so much more than whatever it is he wants you to be. I know you can have a better life, a good life even. With no pain and monstrous werewolves and bloody torture.” His smile was very wan.
Because – because! Because he refused! Because he simply refused to keep on play-acting, now that he knew, knew! that the only thing keeping Him alive was Draco’s own mind, no sort of spell, no attachment. It was Draco who did this all along, who kept it going, who let Him – him! Who let
He was way more than just baffled. “I’m talking about going there and getting your mum out, of course.”
Mother’s cottage was a charming place; large, spacious rooms, delicate French windows, cozy fires, comfortable furniture, everything in light colors and soft browns. It was a lovely country home, and Draco felt so wrong inside it, he could cry.
Something happened to his body, but he wasn’t exactly aware what. Dazed, Draco wondered if the thin screen of denial he cast between him and Azkaban that now shattered could ever be rebuilt. It was terrifying; he felt exposed, exposed and raw, and everything flashed before him in sickening detail. Father’s face the last time he saw him, pale and desolate… Mother screaming farewell behind the prison gate… Grove shoving himself inside, fire in the blue of his eyes… then falling, falling, always falling… he wept until he was dried completely of tears, fidgeting endlessly where he lay, whimpering his impossible plea. It was terrible, too terrible, and nothing could ever take it away… he couldn’t let them take it away… he was doomed to stay in it forever…
Draco remembered what he told himself when he thought he saw Harry in a dream. Of course, reality was far more complicated than that – he couldn’t simply kiss him, it wasn’t something people just did when they were awake and sensible. He wanted to, though. He really, really, desperately, wanted to.
One day after Charms he felt absolutely desperate, and waited at the class entrance for him when Malfoy forgot to run away the second the lesson ended. He waved Ron and Hermione on and they left, exasperated and sighing heavily. Then when it was only Malfoy in the class, since he absolutely refused to leave the room with Harry standing there blocking the way, he got back in and shut the door.
. Someone was in the flat other than Draco, and it wasn’t Him, because he would have known His scent anywhere. It didn’t smell like Him, it smelled like –
It was impossible not to curl a little into himself as he answered. “Yes, of course. They were lovely. Andromeda was so good to me, I’ve never had the chance to… oh gods, why did I agree to this?”
“God, it was such a nightmare trying to remove it. It took three expert curse-breakers, Ron, Charlie, Bill and Hermione’s help, and we still had to keep it in the house, or the rain wouldn’t stop.”
“Hi, Harry. Long time no see. Malfoy,” she turned to him in greeting. “It’s good to finally have you round, Ron just wouldn’t shut up about you. It’s always Draco this, Draco that.”
For a second the boy just seemed lost for words. He looked at his father as if unable to believe what he heard. Then he bowed his head again, overcome by emotions. Harry felt the familiar bubbling in his gut. So this was it, then? He should have known. Some of the screams in his head formed into clear sentences. Lucius’s affection meant more to Draco than Harry’s, that much was clear. And the initial sting of learning that was enough to wake him up to the sad reality around him. Then realization so sharp, so painful took over him and for a long moment he could not speak.
“Look, I just want to talk to you. Can we do that?” he could see the doubt in Draco’s eyes. “Also, if you have any mice for Fredrick, he’d be much obliged.”
“Why did he do it?” Harry bent forward and whispered in the boy’s ear. Malfoy turned to look at him, startled.
Harry’s head was still spinning out of control when the world widened from the tight black hole and the kitchen emerged in front of his bewildered eyes. It was impossible that they were able to get out of there, absolutely unbelievable… his heart was beating a hundred miles a minute. Panting, crouching with two hands on his knees, Harry looked around. The house-elves were all in disarray, running wildly and shouting, carrying large trays full of what presumably was medicine. Nearer to him were the two desolate faces of Ron and Hermione, back to their own bodies, and the stunned image of Narcissa Malfoy. None of them spoke for a minute.
Harry wondered why he kept asking him if he could go, and not just went. He played with his wand distractedly, and noticed how the grey eyes were following the movement almost in trepidation. Then something occurred to him, and he had to check. He pointed his wand at the boy, who brought both his arms up as if to defend himself. Harry gasped. “You came here wandless?”
Harry’s breath became ragged as the hand moved faster, yanking him up and down, sending flaming arrows through his back. He shut his eyes tightly, unable to suppress the deep, loud moans. Then, as it wasn’t enough: “M-Malfoy…” the hand only worked faster, more furiously, and he felt like he might actually scream with pleasure. He gasped as he felt the rushing in his belly, in his thighs, in his balls; everything was tight and shaky and hot; and then with a huge cry he came, bright spots dancing in front of his eyes, and no oxygen at all in his brain. Every nerve ending in his body relaxed as he spilled hard into the boy’s hand, who kept milking him, making him shiver hard, till he was done.
“I don’t – who’s out there?” Or in there? Or in other words what, in all the gods’ names, was happening?
Harry smiled now, thank the bloody gods. “We should head back, I never told Narcissa we’re going. She’d be worried.”
Malfoy wasn’t laughing anymore. “I don’t know where he is, but I have a guess. I’d assume he’s in the company of our beloved Dark Lord. Perhaps receiving more news from him about the fate which awaits me.”
“You can’t deny you have an unlikely connection. I want to see if I understand exactly what it means, though. You mentioned before that your boyfriend could… tell how you felt?”
Malfoy’s mouth closed around the tip of his cock, and Harry went limp. He sank into the sofa, eyes shutting immediately, gasping in surprise. The feeling of warm, silky tightness around him was almost too much to bear. His whole body shook as Malfoy licked the underside of his length, grabbing the base with one hand. Then he swallowed more of him in, and Harry’s entire nervous system was in a frenzy, tingling and shivering all over. His head was spinning in a startling speed. The new sensations were taking him by absolute shock, sending spiraling tornados down his spine, all through his body. Starts glistened behind his eyelids as he felt the tongue gliding on his skin, melting his brain into fine hot liquid. And then Malfoy sucked, and Harry gave a muffled groan as his hips pushed forward involuntarily. Malfoy backed up immediately, gagging.
Harry didn’t say anything, but Draco still couldn’t bring forth the words he was so desperate to say. How to explain to him, how to make him see – the bloody bastard
It was a fairly strong potion; Draco chose it for Harry especially for its near immediate effects. It wasn't actually of the Pepperup variation, but much more like a thorn apple mixture, with strong regenerating agents. Draco sneaked it in his bag because he thought - even when Draco didn't trust magic, he could always trust potions. This was one of the strongest he knew, and he trusted it to work for Harry. To help him, when nothing else could. Fantastic as the healing potion was, though, it still had a considerable drawback – taking it while conscious, and with the severity of Draco’s injuries, was hell on earth. There was so much to repair: all this broken tissue, bruised organs, bleeding gashes, and the magic pouring over all of it was exhausting. Draco felt the same numbness from before gathering around his eyelashes, and try as he might he could not fight it. He fell into a frantic, rabid sort of sleep, and all he could hope for was to still wake up in the end of it.
“I – I told you, I need the exercise.” He made a point of not looking in Harry’s direction. he was utterly puzzled. Until –
Draco shook his head with disgust. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.” He began to wonder if the memory had been left in his mind for a reason. He was not about to play along. “Besides, your lot has been doing it to me for days now. Doesn’t seem to be working.”
He should have known. He should have fucking known. Not even a month ago did he experience the exact same feeling, this blinding rage combined with acute disbelief. He should have known, and God damn it, he did know. Why, why did he not listen to himself back then? How could he let this happen,
“I don’t think that’s as much of a compliment as you imagine it to be,” Draco said, a touch breathless. “And besides, I don’t want you working too hard. You may be better, but you’d still do well to rest.”
“You – “ Malfoy started but then stopped, his head falling into his hands. “You're just too much, Potter.” Harry tried to hold him, but Malfoy resisted, pushing him away and looking at him with eyes so large they were about to tear up. “You are too fucking much.”
“You’re kidding me. After he attacked you? After he sent bloody Greyback to live with you, you're still going to join him?”
“Sure, no problem. Draco, write down what you want – I’ll go Firecall Ron, see if they’re coming tonight. Pansy said she’s on a date, so I wouldn’t count on her, but I’ll ask Theo and Blaise as well, and – “
“Of course,” he said without giving it a spare thought. He couldn’t bear to see him so torn and miserable. “Of course I’d come with you.”
Draco’s shoulders moved up and down in dizzying speed. What had he just confessed to? He was far too frazzled to care. It took a long while before the silence compelled him to look, and then he really wished he hadn’t; the sight that met his eyes made him stumble. Harry was on his knees in the middle of the room, both hands on his chest, and the look he gave Draco was scorching with passionate sincerity.
, I am sorry! I am sorry I was ever mean to you, or neglected you in any way, or made you feel bad – Draco, if you do not take action now, this will be the last thing I could ever say to you. Please try and get up, you must help me. Without your help I could never get Potter, and without him, you are doomed.”
Ron gasped in relief. “I think that'd be best, yeah. But – blimey, Harry! Having sex for the first time is a big deal, you know.”
“Malfoy? Is everything all right?” Sinking into these thoughts made him forget entirely about the other person in the house, and Draco jumped with alarm.
Now that his heart wasn’t breaking speed records anymore, he could see the others around them. Mother standing at the door with a red-eyed looking Pansy. Ron patting Blaise’s back behind the kitchen island. But there was one person who was right there, so very much there, and Draco – he didn’t know how to call it, he didn’t know what name this emotion could have, but he was full to the brim with it. It was the easiest thing he ever did, taking Harry’s head in both his hands and kissing him. It was the easiest thing he’s ever done in his life.
“Luna has a theory he's a werewolf,” Ginny supplied from somewhere to Harry’s right, to general laughter. Harry smiled at her, but then brought his glance back to the blond boy. He really did look awful; he was paler than his usual self, far too thin, and had black bags under his eyes. At the moment he gave the full plates around him a thoroughly disgusted look, and Harry found himself wondering. What happened to the smug, haughty bully he'd known for so long? Had the events of the summer affected him, much like they affected Harry?
“I – the – please, I can’t go there, don’t let them take me! Please just – if not the bracelet then something else, please, I beg you!”
Harry looked at him, at that pointy face he imagined to death over the past few months. First it was with great enthusiasm, then with hatred unlike he had ever known, then with something resembling grief. The face that caused him so much pain, so much agony. The face he dreamed of every night. The face he loved.
“Is this… Draco, is this an apology? Because you don’t need to do that. I’m not angry with you. And even if I was, I’d never – “
“Yeah, we’re not going to say anything about how you’re a bloody evil git who serves You-Know-Who,” Ron offered in an annoyed tone, and Harry frowned at him. “Our lips are sealed.”
But not entirely a stranger, for there was the coffee table Draco leaned on, the drops of his blood on the sofa. There was the fucking corner where he fucking kneeled every fucking day. There was –
At some point he quietened, only the minute shaking a sign of what was still wracking him up inside. Harry’s hand softly released the back of his head. “Hey, are you hungry? I saw there’s some food in the kitchen. I could make you something to eat if you wanted.”
In the end, thank Merlin, the man left. Draco sank back to his wobbly knees, whispering his gratitude to whoever wasn’t listening, and repeating his own kind of prayers. They hurt like a bastard, but they weren’t without their effect. In a short while he was too woebegone to be scared.
