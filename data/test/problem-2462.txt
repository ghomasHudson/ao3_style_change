He didn’t, of course.
“Oh?” Potter said, holding Draco’s eyes.
Potter seemed to understand, even though he looked pained for it. Yet again, Potter - as far as Draco knew - had married Ginny because he loved her. They’d had their kids because they wanted to, even though Potter had claimed yesterday that there was some sort of moral obligation to it. But Draco didn’t think it was comparable to his own situation.
, Draco thought as he sagged against the wall, dragging his fingers through his hair, coughing. When he heard the door slam shut, Draco grabbed the bottle of wine Liffy had opened to air, and threw it against the wall with a scream.
Draco holds a hand up, stopping Potter, his curiosity already having taken over, “You’re already here, so why don’t you tell me and we can have this done with sooner rather than later.”
Draco felt his hands shaking. He stuffed one hand inside a pocket and clutched his cigarette with the other as he watched his father, his cheeks feeling warm.
Draco drank the last of his white wine and waved for the check. “Ta ever so, darling. I’m sure we can work something out soon again, but I’m afraid the goblins are scarier than you are, so I best be off. This was lovely.”
Draco swallowed, pulling at his cuffs and then raking his hands through his hair, putting the strands back in place from Potter’s idiotic and awfully lovely fingers. “Good,” Draco said.
Lying in his old childhood bed, staring up into the ceiling, Draco considered getting up and walking into the en suite and just setting himself on fire. The thought was tempting in his misery, but it was just as impulsive as bashing your head in against a mirror and he was fairly certain his parents had put him on some sort of suicide watch with a house elf lingering in the corners of his room. Invisible of course.
Though, Harry didn’t think he’d take the news about Malfoy as well. Gay
Gemma Zabini nee Farley had married Blaise two years back, but now tried to avoid obvious nepotism by recommending Draco instead of Blaise to help her deal with Potter’s divorce. Blaise would honestly have been a better choice, though Draco says nothing about it. It annoys him that Blaise, who must have known about this from Gemma, hadn’t thought to warn Draco before Potter burst into his office.
“Didn’t you have a daughter just last year?” Draco asked instead.
“Of course.” Draco gave her a nod before he turned and left the restaurant, heading back towards the Leaky and into Diagon Alley again.
Potter shrugged. “Probably not. Perhaps with the boys, but Lily’s too young to leave Ginny. Maybe when she’s older.”
He really did look beyond beautiful with his bared chest and opened trousers. Harry didn’t know where to begin and even though his cock had managed to regain some stiffness again, he couldn’t help his nerves getting to him. He hadn’t got a clue as to how to proceed beyond this point.
All he was trying to do, was to live his life in peace. The fact that he had to escape to the muggle world, it was inevitable and Draco had accepted it as a necessary evil of sorts. If only to be left alone. But it wasn’t right. It wasn’t right that he had to suffer for what his father had done ten years ago.
Draco mentally relaxed and had to keep himself from letting sighing with relief. He didn’t know.
. Yes, they’ve all got their own corpses in their mouths, but it’s easier to blame those where it shows, isn’t it? Those who wears the corpses on their sleeves - literarily. And go on then, Draco thought, blame him all you like. He doesn’t care anymore.
It also fucking unnerved him being home at the manor. His father acted like he was even more of a disappointment, as if he could see through Draco’s ‘accident’ without even asking - his grey eyes almost urging him on.
, you asked."
Thankfully, it wasn’t Astoria.
“The funds for you children are already in place, Mr Potter. I’ve drawn up the papers of Godric’s Hollow, preparing for the transfer of the house to Mrs Potter at the end of next month. However,” Draco paused, clearing his throat. “There may be some possible issues concerning 12 Grimmauld Place.”
When Draco pulled back, Harry wished he’d remove his hand from his throat so he could follow. He didn’t want those lips to be too far from his. He wanted them close, so, so close. He would have felt embarrassed about the whine he let out, if he’d had any dignity left. He didn’t.
They took it easy, slowly.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Maybe he regretted even asking now that it seemed Draco had decided on honesty for once. And still, he listened and watched Draco intently. Draco glanced carefully at Harry before looking away and continuing.
Suffice to say, even if Ginny took half of Potter’s assets, which Draco and Gemma would be able to quite easily prevent as it looked right there and then after Draco’s initial briefing of Potter’s papers, he would still be one of the wealthiest men in all of Britain.
Suddenly, Draco laughed. “You’re completely absurd, Potter.” He said and Harry frowned, growing annoyed at once, shackles risen as he looked at Draco. “I put you through hell at school. My actions during the war should have been enough for me to be granted the kiss, but alas, there you were again, Saint bloody Potter. The saviour and the chosen one - but you just couldn’t help yourself, could you? Your conscience is your Achilles heel, do you know that?”
Never mind that.
Ginny had been the brave one, when he wasn’t. Perhaps he’d been so tired of being brave, he’d just given up. Given up and embraced what was safe, secure and easy. Ginny had always been strong. Had always been the one to hold Harry’s hand through everything. But, when she sat him down that night, Harry somehow knew that they’d reached their end.
Fine Young Cannibals - She Drives Me Crazy
Potter leaned back over the table, pushing his now empty plate to the side. “Well?”
But what if Draco decided to drop Harry as a client?
He resented his family - and himself for his weakness - for the situation he’d been forced into. He could already taste the pink potion in the back of his mouth and it made in nauseous.
He’d done whatever he could to just press it back, too afraid of becoming so bloody vulnerable again. Reducing his urges to quick shags in bathroom stalls and one-night-stands which meant nothing. He’d done it because he was the same bloody coward he’d always had been. A narcissistic coward who preferred to blame his own short-comings on other people instead of fucking facing reality like a normal human being.
“Malfoy,” Potter said as Draco pulled on his coat and winding his scarf around his neck. “You have a minute?”
He looked so different, sitting there over Harry’s hips, his clothes somewhat rumpled and his hair tousled, hanging down over his forehead and cheekbones. And still, he was a marvel. So bloody beautiful it almost hurt a little to look too closely.
And she was right. Harry knew that then, and he knows it now. Ginny was almost always right - and now, when he’d had some weeks to think and understand that their marriage had been over a long time ago, he didn’t even feel angry. He just missed her, her warmth and how steady she’d always been. The way her hair smelled in the morning, or the way she laughed at the dinner table. And the family - all the Weasley’s. Harry had always wanted a large family, people with whom he belonged. Ron was still his best mate and they met once a week just the two of them. He’d married Hermione a couple of years ago and they had two kids now. They seemed to be happy and Harry was glad for them, even though it seemed to be far from a perfect marriage. But Harry had always supported them and still hoped they’d make it.
“Tell me what upset him, Emmyl.”
"N-no. I-I need to fix the letter, Harry."
"I-I-I don't want to!" Harry screamed out into the room, "I AM SORRY. I AM SOO SORRY."
"I simply didn't know I was hungry until you left." he grits out, his voice void of any feelings and considerably louder than the hushed noises he has been communicating through lately. "You have a bloody house-elf, do you not? You could ask him for more, then, instead of crying about a few missing spoons of rice."
"I brought you some healing salve and pain potions." Harry told Draco softly when he stopped gasping for air. The tears were still streaming down his face, but other than that, his malfoy mask is back on. Harry didn't know what to make of it and it drove him crazy. Draco started shaking his head, that panicked look back in his eyes.
"M-myrtle?" the younger blonde asked weakly while turning his head and instantly feeling horrified at finding a smiling Harry crouched down in front of him, extending a hand.
When Harry woke up, hours later, he made a beeline for the books he purchased, determined to get any kind of answer that would put his worries to rest. It seemed simple at first. This was a disease. A disease has a source. A source could be treated. Then, Draco would be fine! He would. He would. More calm now, Harry started skimming the books and immediately found his answer, hope spreading through him and filling him with pure joy.
"what about now? Why are you helping me now?"
"Draco!" he said as calmly as he could. "You know what would make me happy? Breakfast. You want breakfast, right?"
“Sorry, dude. I don’t,” the boy said, then continued to walk. Draco groaned internally. He would have to approach another muggle. It took everything he had just to talk to that one! He should’ve brought a calming draught with him.
"I just heard you and wanted to make sure you were alright."
He didn't have time to dwindle on the thoughts, though, because Jashua immediately jumped on him, tackling him to the floor on his stomach and whispering in his ear.
Draco tries to fight his demons when he gets traumatic flashbacks during sex. Harry, as usual, has no idea what to do.
“I already told you, ‘Mione. He explicitly said he wasn’t a sociopath, then he just...I don’t know how to describe it. He just started balling his hands. He seemed in pain and he said it happens whenever he thinks I am angry at him. It stopped when he started to bleed. It also seemed to stop when I grabbed his hand-”
"Don't wanna be touched." he murmured so quietly, Harry had to strain his ears to hear it.
"Of course he would!" Harry suddenly yelled, "That's the problem. The guy is insane. I would never do anything to you like he does. It's horrible. Please! You can't go back to him, please."
“So, you’ll report them?” Ron asked enthusiastically. Harry finally looked up. His friend was already deep in thought, presumably coming up with plans to investigate where the money went and prove that it wasn’t spent on Harry in court.
"Take a look for yourself, darling. He's resting on our balcony floor as we speak, resting forever and always that is."
Draco was worried sick. Harry had left to get a pen from his best friend and never returned. He even went to the red-head himself, but all he got was a "sod off, Malfoy. He doesn't need to tell you where he's going all the time. Maybe he just left early."
“I mean...I would understand why given the symptoms you’ve listed. Perhaps I can give you a set of questions to ask him, then.”
Later that night, as Draco silently ate his dinner, Harry went over the blonde’s contract. He didn’t look pleased.
"it isn't like that! I swear! Please, don't hurt him. He did nothing wrong."
There it was. That sad smile again. Harry was surprised that the awful emotions draco felt when giving it were the same as what Harry felt whenever he saw it.
No anger.
Harry looked at the wand sitting on the table in front of the both of them.
It didn't matter what Harry thought anyway. Draco couldn't stay there. It wouldn't be right. It wouldn't be fair for Harry. Harry has everything to offer and Draco has nothing.
Harry could hear everyone whispering about his ‘purity’, making assumptions. He didn’t understand what was going on. Ginny had told him about what a bonding ceremony is, but he wasn’t really listening, too exhausted after a long study session to do anything but nod along.
Draco blinked, not fully comprehending what was happening, until he noticed he was shaking. He had given himself away. If only he had stayed in control for a few more seconds....
"What's wrong?" he asked, trying to keep his voice steady.
2. Go flying on the pitch
"No. And you never were."
Suddenly it all clicked: Draco's behavior, Jashua's words, the letters, the fear in Draco's eyes.
“If that were true, you wouldn’t be in pain at all,” Harry joked, then groaned when Draco recoiled again. He closed his eyes, sighed, and was just about to let go of Draco’s hands and demand that they go to a healer. The blonde’s next words stopped him in his tracks.
Suddenly, every single moment Draco had with Harry since running into him at the market played Through Draco's head, and, the blonde was sure, Jashua's as well. As soon as the memories stopped, Draco braced himself for the kick, for the punch, for what he thought would be his absolute death. After a few seconds passed with no hits, he looked up to find Jashua staring at him, gaping. Only then did it occur to him that Harry had been casting the same blockage spells on him for weeks without Draco having to even ask. He had Draco's fears at the back of his mind this entire time, even when Draco, himself, had forgotten.
And that was one promise Draco intended to keep even if he could never throw away that damn piece of glass for some reason. Had it been harry, he would've snatched it away and coodled the blonde endlessly. Jashua left it. He was a good guy that way. He wanted Draco to be strong.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shook his head frantically.
Harry instantly looked down at himself, not seeing anything alarming or out of order, he shot a confused look at Ron, who rolled his eyes and immediately conjured a mirror.
"N-no! I w-won't let you do that either." he chokes out, "Y-you don't want this, Draco. Trust me. Please don't do this."
" I didn't want to see you."
Harry couldn't help it. What he saw... What did he just see?
"draco.. Please"
"stop being cryptic! Why can't we be friends?"
“Thank you, but don’t you have work?” the blonde asked with a raised eyebrow. Harry shrugged.
“Mr. Potter, all these documents are confidential and so is anything that pertains to them,” the officiate said harshly. Harry gulped at the sudden change of tone.
" There. Everything is unlocked. You can leave if you want to. I am not keeping you prisoner." Harry said softly with an edge to his tense voice. Upon seeing the hurt and understanding flash across Draco's face, he quickly added "But I don't want you to, just to be clear. I want you here even if you drive me crazy. It's one of the things I love about you. I still find it cute."
To his surprise, the blonde perked up immediately, sat back down, and began digging into his food. Harry smiled at him, but his heart radiated concern. It didn’t make sense that the blonde could be miserable one second then ecstatic the next. He needed to understand what was happening. He had to talk to Hermione about it the next day. He knew it was a breach of privacy, but he hoped Draco would never find out.
"H-Harry?"
The brunette waved him off.
“I really need this job, Potter. Please don’t mess it up for me,” he whispered, continuing to look down at the counter.
Draco shrieked and stood suddenly, banging his head against the sinks. Harry chuckled, then dragged draco out from under the sinks, loving his child - like attitude.
"Draco, you're dying. I can't let that happen. You haven't eaten. You can barely stand without falling back down. You- you look dead already. I can't stand by and watch this. I am just going to get Pomfrey and she'll know what to do. She'll make you better. Don't you want that?" Harry had to restrain himself from shouting. Surely, Draco was taking the piss if he was asking why Harry needed to do this. Does the blonde really not realize how sick he is?
"Please don't do anything else to me." he said wetly. Harry was about to envelope him in a comforting hug, when the blonde dashed to the floo, called out knockturn alley, and disappeared without another word.
"that's quite alright, but I will need to keep an eye on you to make sure you don't run off to knockturn alley and sell yourself for some potions." Harry said softly, rubbing draco's arms, then chuckled at his joke, but he stopped abruptly upon hearing draco's next thought.
The blonde knew that, logically, Harry’s words were true. It shouldn’t be expected of him to just accept workingon such short notice, but he just couldn’t bring himself to actually
"Your mother would've died! You were terrified. I sensed what you were feeling. I would've done the same to save my mother, do you hear me? If you think you deserve what he did to you, you don't."
"It's negative." he whispered, barely able to contain the cheerful tone at the thought of Draco being able to get away from Jashua, which just warrants the question. Just what exactly was going on there?
"I'll eat later, Draco. I am not really in the mood now." Harry told him with what he hoped was a soothing voice.
He steals glances at Draco whenever he can, looking away at the start, afraid his ex-lover will catch him. Eventually, he abandons being subtle altogether and openly stares at Draco. It didn't matter anyways. The man hadn't moved an inch and his gaze was still on the floor. Then, he sees the blonde eyeing the food from the distance subtly and his confusion increases.
“Mate, I am just trying to help you.” he heard his friend say firmly, then felt the couch dip next to him, “If you really don’t want to do anything about it, at least talk to the bank. You shouldn’t have to pay a dime to them, not after they neglected to make sure the Dursleys were following your mum’s wishes. Don’t you think?”
"Are you looking to buy something illegal?"
Harry returned to the alley every night. He searched the prophet for any sightings of the blonde. He looked through knockturn alley, but no one had seen Draco come or leave.
"He seems fine." Harry echoed back breathlessly, then promptly asked if he could leave. The nurse let him go.
Harry went through the list of things the books recommended he do to help draco.
Draco giggled, rolling his eyes as Harry sat on the edge of the bed, holding an envelope, and suddenly looking kind of nervous.
No hatred.
Harry regretted the question the instant Draco's smile vanished and he dropped his hand. He needed to know, though. Even if it pained him to see Draco upset again, he needed to know why Draco seemed to have completely forgotten about their wonderful time together and apparently hated Harry again.
Harry's ears were ringing and he barely understood what was happening as the man took a hold of draco and dragged him away, but not before Harry saw that same look in the blonde's eyes and the tears streaming down his face.
"he.. Felt obligated?" draco whispered. He finally had it. The missing piece of the puzzle. The explanation behind why Harry loved him: he simply didn't.
It was Ron and he looked at Harry like one would at a puppy with three legs. Harry prayed he hadn't been looking at Draco the same way.
"N-no. No healing. N-no potions."
"How long will that take? I want to leave as soon as possible."
The brunette looked back in an instant, failing to see what could be petrifying the blonde at first. Luckily, his Auror training came in handy. When he inspected the area closer, he noticed it: a wizarding camera, pointing right at Malfoy. The blonde was under surveillance, knew about it, and let it happen? Why would he do that?
He couldn't speak. He knew if he did, his voice would give him away. He let the tears fall with his  shame and sadness. Harry was disappointed in him. He couldn't even give his Harry one day of happiness. Unless...he could convince Harry to enjoy him without worrying about Draco's pleasure.
"because you live together?" he said casually. Draco shot him a terrified look.
" N-no. I don't understand, Harry. What is this about?" Draco asked, looking around the room, panicked, then gazing up at Harry was wide, pleading eyes. The sight broke Harry's heart.
He had never told his friends about how bad things were at the Dursley's because.. Well how can he just bring something like that up? Harry remembered all too clearly all the reactions he had gotten from the other kids in his room the say his uncle had landed him in the hospital.
Harry stood impatiently waiting for an answer, but Draco didn't look up.
The blonde gulped as he once again faced the tables. He saw that a couple of teenagers had just walked in and approached them very slowly, only to be side-tracked by a familiar voice calling to him.
Draco looked up to find Harry frowning at his still full plate. Harry's was empty. The blonde had fallen asleep, seduced by the warm and comfortable cushions of the booth and the safety of having Harry next to him.
"Draco-"
It was a glimpse, but enough to instill the horrifying truth that he so desperately wanted to avoid: his draco was dead and the man he was seeing was merely a corpse.
Draco shook his head frantically. He couldn't take any of that. It was too much. Harry was doing too much for Draco. Draco could only eat from dumpsters. That was all he deserved, perhaps even more than he should be getting. This food smelled too good. It would be such a waste to give it to Draco.
"He didn't rape me." he said simply.
Harry felt his blood run cold as his anger threatened to boil over. He would recognize that paper anywhere.
, what I can do is tell you a few things that could help prevent future episodes.”
"I have no where else to go, potter!" the blonde exclaimed and Harry seemed to deflate at the use of his last name, "Now, if you care about me one bit, please drop this now and send me home."
"Yeah.. When I was on the streets, I would help the strays look for food in dumpsters and such, even named some of them. They used to hug me at night and keep me warm. I guess it gave me some sense of purpose for a while. Until some woman, who claimed her kids were attacked by them, put poison in the dumpsters. They all died that night. It wasn't even their fault! I-I am sure of it! I saw those kids! They always threw stones at the dogs, what did they expect would happen? Even then, the dogs didn't do anything. They just ran towards the kids then stopped and turned back. I saw it with my own eyes! When I confronted her she said I was a crazy homeless guy. That's when I-when I... "
Draco’s eyes immediately snapped to where the brunette’s hand was reaching for his wand. The blonde shuddered and looked at Harry pleadingly.
“We won’t charge them for the school fees, then. What about the food and the doctors and the college fund and everything else? Anyone who knew you back then could testify that they weren’t for you.” his red-head friend gritted out, unable to believe that Harry wasn’t more upset about this.
"I-Of course I read them. I read them all. Every single of them. I even re-read the first few, just trying to- nevermind."
"Sorry." he murmured, rubbing at his eyes furiously so he could wake the fuck up and not alert Harry to his level of exhaustion.
Don't own any of the characters. Rowling does.
He still couldn't move, not until Harry cast that damned spell and saw Draco's bruised and broken body, along with the scars from the bathroom incident that seemed to hold Harry's gazr for too long before he finally rested his eyes on the mark and the two slashes from his attempts. Only then could he turn to rest on his side, pull his knees up to his chest and weep in a ball, no longer giving a damn about his perfect day.
Jashua smiles widely.
"N-no. That can't be true.
"You were almost unconscious."
"But you're big on withholding." Harry murmured and Draco couldn't argue with that.
“It happens when you’re angry with me,” he heard Draco murmur. His eyes snapped open instantly and he gaped at the blonde, waiting for an explanation that never came.
Draco's hole was leaking blood and semen onto the tub floor and it looked like someone had ripped him open. His back had extensive bruising and his chest and stomach were purple, which proved that his ribs were affected as well. His wrists and legs and cock and bullocks were all deep purple, like the blood was trapped there for some reason. They had magical fields around them. Harry would recognize the spell anywhere. Jashua was binding Draco to the house, causing the binds to tightened more as Draco went further and further away from it. Harry was surprised his limbs and cock hadn't fallen off by the way they looked.
“I’m sorry. You’re right. You’re right. I know I am being a bit...unreasonable, Mione, but he was in so much pain. I really want to help him,” Harry said, feeling bad, then asked, “How long do you reckon it'll take if you agree?“
Harry's stomach knots once again upon hearing Draco's words and sad expression. He wants to find whoever reduced the blonde to tears and beat the shit out of them, but, right now, he needs to take care of his Draco.
“What can I do?” he asked, tightening his grip and rubbing Draco’s knuckles with his thumbs. His heart sank when Draco started shaking his head, but he sighed in relief upon hearing the blonde’s next words.
"Morning." he said softly. Draco seemed confused for a second then suddenly shot up and looked around frantically, only to wince in pain because of his sudden movements.
" Suicide rate is a little over 20%. It's a leading cate of death, mate. One person every 40 seconds."
"Treacle tart. Draco Malfoy and we went all the way and were in love. Ginny Weasley and I forced myself to go to second base before I told her the truth about me. No one else since then. No other guys since you. Grimmauld Place and a dog named Scruffie who always cried for an hour after you leave and I don't know how to calm him down the way you do. You like to be called baby, especially when I am comforting you or when weren't having sex. Fourth year, 11 pm, hot April night in our chamber. I promised we'd continue to do it there after, though, and we did."
"We don't have to buy anything." he said quickly. "I'd like you to, but if you don't feel like it, we could just look around."
And still, Draco hadn’t seen him in years. They’ve successfully been able to ignore each other since after the trials when Potter spoke for Draco and his family, saving himself and his mother from spending time in Azkaban and resulting in only his father’s imprisonment. He’d been released after five years and now lives out his days more or less confined to the manor, forbidden from any political or other social engagement beyond family and close friends. Naturally, a majority of Draco’s father’s close friends are either still in Azkaban or dead.
The whole first week had been a complete orgy of drunken anger, prostitutes and general debauchery. The fact that he still had a work to go back to, was a miracle in itself. Draco had felt ill the entire last week, depression from his bender pushing him into a bottomless darkness and for a while, he’d completely forgotten what was real and not. He couldn’t remember what he’d done at work, couldn’t recall whom he’d spoken to. It wasn’t until his crying mother had brought his father with her last Thursday and threatened to have him hospitalised, that Draco managed to snap out of his misery.
Pulling back, Potter leaned his forehead against Draco’s, whispering “Thank you.”
Draco pulled back, straightening himself and clearing his throat again. It felt dry, as if he’d swallowed a handful of sand and he wanted to cough. Instead, he looked at Potter, who just stood there, his hands now in his pockets.
Harry nodded, “I… Yeah, I guess I get it. The war,” he cleared his throat, clasping his hands on the kitchen isle and shifted slightly on the barstool, “We’re all kind of fucked up from it still, Draco. It’s not just you. The war… It left me a killer. I did horrible things and I prepared to die. To stay dead.” Harry looked down into the white marble with its swirling gold and glittering inlaid stones. “What I mean to say is, I haven’t blamed you for what you did, when we were kids or during the war, in a long time. Perhaps… What I would want is for you to not blame me for being a confused kid. I’m not defending what I put you through or what I did, but I am sorry for it.”
he’d managed not to think of the tosser. For
And he’d been so vulnerable back then, crushed from the war and confused. He was facing trials that could have possibly put him in Azkaban for the rest of his life. His father was already there, the Kiss pending. His mother sat alone in the manor, once a home wrecked by dark magic and lost lives - enemies and friends alike.
He quit a couple of months ago, but it seems since Potter’s bloody wife decided she was in love with the much, much, much older Minister for Magic and wanted a divorce, he was again a smoker. Well, he knew an excuse when he saw it, but decided to not acknowledge it.
“You’ve rectified it since the 19th century,” Draco drawled, crushing the butt of his fag in the ashtray. “Now, back to Potter. Have you brought the documents I need? And when’s the hearing between the two parties?”
“Right.” Draco took a deep breath, itching for a fag. It was still strange not being able to have a fag in a pub, but muggle health regulations and all that… “So, you’re a liar, then?”
Draco had never seen the beauty of it.
“Thanks,” Potter said as he stood somewhat hunched, leaning against a bookshelf.
He had shagged a guy in drag a couple of weeks back after having drinks in a muggle gay bar just off of Leicester Square, and they’d retreated back to Draco’s flat to finish the night off. It had been risky, however, his flat was in a purely muggle part of London and they had been discreet. Could that have come out somehow? The person recognising him seemed to have thought the man in drag was a woman, so maybe? Either way, it was a close call which would need to never be repeated. Draco had known it was a bad idea, but his cock in combination with the alcohol had ignored the red flags.
The clock above sounded and Draco followed Gemma into the large chamber. Potter met his eyes for a short moment before they sat down, Draco to Gemma’s left and Potter to her right. Ginerva was sat with her solicitor and father - and the rest of the table was filled up with barristers and the undersecretary.
“You what?” Draco bit out, his grey eyes glaring at Harry as Harry’s hand reached out, tracing Draco’s collarbones.
Draco coughed and looked away. “Whatever it is, you’ve just gotten divorced. And I’m still married.”
“Ah, of course.” Gemma smiled ruefully, “Our Irish line is a bit too muddled. I tend to forget.”
he’d focused on rebuilding his life, his reputation. He’d wanted to be normal, so he had done all he could to be normal - but it was pretentious pretending. His life was a sodding joke and it seemed as if Draco was the only one who wasn’t laughing.
Boston - Peace of Mind
“It was ten years ago, Draco…” Potter said, frowning. “I told you yesterday, I was frightened and confused. I… I didn’t fucking know better.”
David Bowie - Sweet Thing / Candidate / Sweet Thing - Reprise
, and reached up, threading his fingers through Draco’s hair and then just blurted it out.
Draco leaned back in his armchair, studying Potter before answering. “A few years.”
Still, punching people left and right wouldn’t help him in his strife for normalcy. But, considering the upbringing he’d had, could you blame him for acting out physically? He didn’t. He was too forcibly well behaved, upper class - stiff upper lip, poppy cock and all that.
“Whatever might I do for you this morning, father?” Draco drawled when he put the clock back in his chest pocket. “Surely you could have owled.”
accident.
love - because he didn’t need it. He convinced himself that he couldn’t fucking feel it. And what a load of tosh that was.
Perhaps, Draco mused as he listened with half an ear to what was being said as he glanced at Ginny and her solicitor, Potter had known her as she had been before she realised she’d spent years upon years in what turned out to be an illusion of a marriage. Perhaps her solicitor had put ideas in her head. But why even try to find some explanation for why Ginny acted as she did?
When Draco pulled back, Harry was dazed and maybe, he’d even forgotten how to speak, if only for a moment or two. He was also impossibly hard.
Instead, we found himself with Potter at 12 Grimmauld Place, and from there - it was as if Draco lost control for a moment. Lust, anger,
Potter’s mouth hung open for a moment, looking around before looking back at Draco, “Do what?”

“Draw on that, if you please. Leave the drawers alone.” Draco drawls before he shrugs off his jacket and hangs it by the door. He steals a glance down at James’s homework, rolling his eyes. “Thank god you’re not a teacher, Potter.”
“It doesn’t matter right now, Harry.” Ginny had answered, “The important thing right now, is that you know that this wasn’t your fault and nothing’s happened between me and him. But I can’t continue like this anymore.”
The whore who’s mouth he fucked in an abandoned alleyway before he flooed back to the manor was equally shallow, but at least he din’t pretend to be otherwise. That’s the good thing about whores, Draco thinks, it’s their job to pretend.
Draco ignored the looks people threw him and just stared straight ahead, waiting for his turn. Unfortunately, when he stepped into the lift, he came face to face with Arthur Weasley. Draco just kept his face blank and locked eyes with him for a moment, refusing to take his headphones off. He doubted Arthur wished to talk to him in any case.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “Tomorrow.”
“What does that even matter?” Potter’s voice was rising and Draco couldn’t help but to feel enjoyment from egging him on, almost feeding on Potter’s indignant anger. Finally, Draco thought, something
Gemma drew in a deep breath as she leaned forward, glancing quickly at Draco.
“Yeah,” Harry’s voice sounded raspy and he dragged a hand over his mouth.
Madonna could be heard in the background, though Draco didn’t fancy her music that much and instead he focused on inhaling half his pint in one go, just content to be someplace other but the manor or his flat. A man sat down beside him, sending him looks from the corner of his eye. Draco looked back, but decided to focus on his pint. He wasn’t into that much older men, really. He preferred his men tall and with at least a somewhat youthful appearance. If he was desperate, maybe - but not tonight. Not after the days he’d had.
The room around them was a beautiful room lit up with smaller lights combined with candles and the modern fireplace.
The second week came and went. It was Friday and Harry had stayed out of Draco’s way for two weeks. Not a word had been sent. He’d gone nowhere near he could suspect Draco could be. He’d even sent someone else to Gringotts to make a withdrawal for him.
Draco had to think for a moment. He’d married Astoria and she’d gotten pregnant shortly after. Ah, of course. “He’s three. Turns four in May next year.”
Potter licked his lips with a smile, looking at Draco for a moment whilst leaning over his plate with his elbow on the table, before he took a slice of bread, tearing it apart and scooping up sauce with the bread. Draco sighed internally, rolling his eyes.

“That’s okay,” Harry said, his voice hoarse. “I don’t mind.”

His flat looked out over Hyde Park through tall windows that spanned through three of the four rooms. It gave a calming view, especially during evenings and Draco enjoyed the minimalism of the décor he’d chosen. As opposed to the manor, which was opulent almost to the point being vulgar, Draco preferred to keep things as simple as possible. Still toothachingly expensive, as he found great pleasure in procuring muggle and wizard modern art and designer furniture.
As he looked at Harry now, he found him to be beyond handsome with his tanned skin and muscled body what was like something from a Greek painting. Draco was smitten, absolutely beyond drunk on whatever this was.
Potter took his hand. It was warm, a bit sweaty and just… Comfortable. Draco hated to admit he still had a good grip, steady and calloused.
in one of their stately gardens - which was in reality just another word for a bunch of rich sluts nagging on about other rich sluts, their husbands’ whores or how chronically unfaithful they were.
His own dastardly connection to Potter, unspecified as it may still be, weren’t much better, but Draco decided it was far from the same situation as the one with Ginny and Shacklebolt.
He began to recite the lyrics in his head, imagining the bassline, the drums and flowing guitar if only to have something else to think of, aside from his miserable family that’s more like the shadows of themselves these days. Not that they haven’t always been such, but he can remember his mother looking less like a pale ghost and when Draco was younger, his father’s eyes used to have an intensity to them. Now, everything just feels dull.
, Draco wanted to say, but he kept quiet and looked away. It seemed he’d knocked himself out bashing his head into the bathroom mirror that morning after his fateful wank in the shower. Fortunately, it seemed he wouldn’t have to shag Astoria tonight. At least he didn’t think so. Did you have to shag your wife after waking up in hospital? A notion as bizarre as the actual shagging itself and Draco felt dirty all over again.
And he both did, and didn’t.
Stooges - Not Right
“I’m in love with someone else,” Ginny had said, her red hair bound in a loose knot on her head and her normally happy eyes dark and serious. Harry could see how tense she was, and her words didn’t register at first. Only that she was looking at him, intently, as if trying to force him to understand the strange words that left her mouth.
Draco sighed, rolling onto his back and looking up into the roof of his four-poster bed. “Get me dreamless sleep.”
“Yeah, cheers.”
Annoyed, Draco called out for Liffy who popped in after a second, looking worried and writhing her hands.
Maybe, if Harry hadn’t treated him like an old pair of knickers to throw away before, perhaps he could have blossomed into something less sociopathic as an adult. Something just a tad bit warmer.
Draco sighed, patting his lips with a napkin. “Of course I am.”
“Nope.” Potter said with a wry smile as he took the glass of wine Draco held out for him.
, and yet - as Gemma explained to Potter about Ginerva’s solicitor and the statement Gemma had received that very morning, Draco couldn’t deny it. He felt bad. And to his absolute horror, he found he wanted to reach out and grasp Potter’s hand in some disgustingly comforting gesture.
Lucius Malfoy didn’t agree, naturally, and he tried to beat the queer out of Draco as well as he could. The mere sight of his father’s cane still made him shiver, even though he hadn’t been frightened by the sight of it since his late teens. Draco didn’t know if his father thought he’d succeeded with his beatings, but he didn’t really care anymore.
Kreacher appeared within fifteen minutes with their food, which surprised Harry. Maybe it also annoyed him a bit, considering how obvious it was that Kreacher did it for Draco’s sake, but Harry didn’t comment on it, and instead, sat down at the table as Draco sat down across from him.
Then, Draco’s expression mellowed and he reached for a pack of fags lying on the counter. Harry didn’t mind his smoking - inside nonetheless - but he didn’t like it. Though, he said nothing. Lighting the cigarette and taking a deep inhale, Draco looked up at Harry. “I’ve quite frankly been feeling like dog shit, Potter.”
“So…” Potter said, switching the leg resting over his knee. “How long have you lived here?”
“Liffy is making pasta. Should I ask her to do more?” Draco asked, sitting down in his Jetson again and motioning for Potter to sit in the cognac-coloured leather sofa across from Draco.
Standing in the en suite connected to their bedroom in the western wing of the manor where his family resides, Draco looked at himself in the large golden framed mirror.
“Liffy!” Draco shouted as he pulled out a bottle of Merlot, first checking the wine fridge for a good white, but quickly returned to his initial choice of a red.
The meeting continued without issue after that, and they managed to prepare for the hearing. When it was done, Draco wanted nothing more than to go back to his flat and put on a Fleetwood Mac record and pour himself a glass or five of prosecco, but of course Potter waited for him outside Gemma’s office, because Draco had never really been very lucky.
He didn’t say any of those things however, and instead just sighed and moved aside, letting Potter inside.
“Yeah,” Potter said, looking away. Draco looked down into his papers, feeling awkward in front of Potter’s strained expression. “I just want to make sure the kids are good if anything should happen to me.”
He couldn’t fucking deny the fact to himself that he
After another minute or so, he could see her physically shaking and he began to grow tired of looking at her. Draco gestured for her to leave. She just glared at him before she left, looking as miserable as Draco did in his bathroom mirror after a few glasses too many.
David Bowie - Starman
“You’ve ruined regular pasta for me, I swear.” Potter said, his mouth still filled and Draco scoffed.
“And why would I want to shag you to begin with?” Draco continued, “I gave you head once ten years ago and after you went completely mental, going on and on about you not being queer. I’m pretty sure I don’t want to go through all of that again.” Draco took a deep breath, glaring at Potter who’d now shrunk back against his chair, a much different expression on his face now. “Actually, I’m not just pretty sure - I’m dead sure.”
He felt like something calm but theatrical, something easy - so he pulled out the Human Menagerie by Steve Harley and the Cockney Rebel. Lifting the needle carefully, he moved it to the last song on the A-side and turned up the volume, before walking over to the liquor cabinet and pouring himself a large firewhisky.
Astoria put the book down and watched him silently. Draco drew a deep breath, leaning against the bedpost closest to Astoria’s hidden feet.
“I haven’t forgiven you yet, Potter.” Draco said as he rose back up to his full height. “It’ll take some time, but…” he looked away for a moment before sighing. “I’ve come to terms with the fact that I might enjoy you as much as I hate you.”
the smile on his lips, the puff of his warm breath against Draco’s skin.
Until his doorbell rang.
“We’re not on a date. You decided to barge in on my Friday evening.”
“Oh, pardon me, father.” Draco said, perhaps somewhat sarcastically, “Would you care for some tea?”
His stomach hurt as he tied the scroll around his owl’s leg and as he stood watching her fly away, he almost wanted to call her back. He didn’t. He needed to be the better man this time and actually apologise. He’d left whatever it was they’d shared in fucking ruins the last time; an apology was the least he could do this time around.
“Maybe,” Harry shrugged. “I’m not that well versed in music in general - wizard or muggle.”
Potter looks down at their intertwined hands, still smiling. “Oh, in a couple of hours.”
Draco drank the last of his pint before putting two tenners on the counter and then leaving without another word to Potter or the dyke bartender. He should have left Potter to pay up, but he just didn’t care anymore. Just wanted to get away from it all.
Draco nodded, “Right. Of course.” As if that was even a possibility with Draco’s inclinations.
“Me and Ginny, we’re getting divorced. Considering my financial situation and the reasons for the divorce, I was advised to seek proper help with splitting the assets. I want to make sure our kids get their due, no matter what happens to me. I don’t care what Ginny does with her share, but I don’t want them to be left with nothing if the worst happens.”
Draco nodded, before moving past Harry - and Harry had to stop himself from reaching out and touching Draco. Instead, he followed him upstairs.
to be advising you?” he asked. He didn’t really want to be advising Potter - not just because he prefers to avoid his actual job as much as possible, but mainly because it’s bloody
“That is… Absolutely mental, honestly.” Draco frowned, reaching for his fourth fag in a day.
Draco shrugged off his robes, throwing them over one of the sofa in the living room, before walking over to the turntable and his albums.
No, of course not. Then again, they both knew what they did when they married. He’s not sure Astoria knows he’s gay, but she knows something’s not right. But it’s the way of things. Marriage. Children.
God, he needed good shag.
“You’re such a bastard,” she shook her head, “Impossible arse.”
“I see,” Draco said, scribbling down the date, Potter’s full name and the circumstances in brief. “And are you sure you’d like
Schooling his expressions, Draco got down to business, following along with Gemma as they discussed the forthcoming hearing. Draco had drawn up a couple of momentary plans. Ones which hopefully would hold through the hearing if no further information came to light and would give Ginny a symbolic sum of one million galleons while the rest of Potter’s assets would befall their children at the time of his death. When the children reached their maturity, they would also receive a trust fund, something Draco had been surprised Potter hadn’t already put in place for his children at their birth, considering he had his own trust fund from his parents as an orphaned child. Should Harry collapse and die right this very moment, all his money would befall Ginny who then would distribute it to her children, both with Potter and the eventual future children she has with Shacklebolt. An absurd notion indeed.
“Of course not.” Draco said, setting his glass down and walking over to his turntable to turn the record. “So, nothing better to do on a Friday night than crashing my party?”
On the second day, an owl arrived to Draco. It was from Potter, inquiring about his health - though, not in those words, mind you. Fucking auror knowing everything. Draco crumbled the note and threw it in the fire, disgusted by his stomach’s fluttering reaction. Instead, he downed two glasses of muggle whisky along with a dreamless sleep potion and collapsed beside his bed.
Hermione's screams, Bellatrix's laughter, the deafening sound of spells whipping past him and missing him by an inch, Dobby appearing out of nowhere.
Malfoy's grip on the wand relaxed a little " You attacked me first" he pointed out as a matter of fact, which only made Harry roll his eyes.
Malfoy glanced back over his shoulder "Do you happen to know where they are now?" And Harry shook his head "I don't know, i can't think of where they might have gone to. But regardless, i need your wand" Harry got up and went to stand next to Malfoy , Harry noticed that they were out in the middle of another forest and he wondered how safe they were in this place. Malfoy whipped his head towards Harry "I'm not giving you my wand, Potter." He said with an air of finality.
He stretched lazily across the bed thinking about how hungry he feels right now and wondering if Potter was still asleep or not.He looked up at the room and found that he was alone in the cabin.
Malfoy continued " My parents are in too deep to reason with, they used to be everything i cared for. But when your own parents bring the most dangerous wizard on the planet to live under the same roof, there comes a point where you sit and just think " Well, that is certainly a risky move that i should not be a part of " i mean, he had us torturing mud-bloods in our cellars for crying out loud!" Malfoy complained as if it was the most outrageous thing to ever happen, and Harry assumed that perhaps it was. He flinched inwardly at the way Malfoy used the word "mud blood" so casually, but he let it slide for the sake of getting this conversation over with.
"draco..."
His voice is angry by the end of his rant and Harry doesn't know how he manages to switch his tones so quickly. He waves it off as a result of the obvious addiction that the blonde is denying.
"help?"
"I didn't mean it. You have to know that, Draco. I don't hate you and I didn't back then, not really. You haven't ruined me. I am just.. Yours. You're not insufferable. I only suffer when I am away from you." Harry whispered and Draco eyed him for a second before setting him back down on the other end of the couch where he was immediately assaulted by Scruffie, sniffing him, making sure he was alright.
Draco had no clue what he was talking about and couldn't bring himself to ask. Harry was feeling guilty. But why?
"I know, Draco, I know." she told him, wiping away nonexistent tears and floating over to where the blonde was standing, then placing a hand over his shoulder in a gesture.
TW: Suicide attempt and blood.
The slight catch in Harry's voice at the end of his rant was the only thing that could've made Draco look up. He didn't even know he was speaking until Harry shot him a confused look.
Harry winced at the harsh tone that replaced the soft, almost relieved one. A flood of emotions and questions went through his mind, but when Draco made a move to leave, he quickly started to speak.
"I know you don't."
We've come to the 'heartbreaking scene' that Draco mentions in the second part. It's Harry-centric and will only be mentioned a few times after this, so for readers who don't enjoy reading 'abused Harry and helpful Draco' scenes, you can skip this chapter altogether, just know that the summer before fifth year was particularly hard on Harry, which explains how distant he is when they return to Hogwarts. Other than that, enjoy!
It wasn't like that.
“Harry, he has, presumably, been living this way his entire life. He is probably used to it by now. I know a life of pain doesn’t seem like one that could ever be good, but the human body can adapt to so many things, you’d be astonished. He probably doesn’t suffer as much as he used to anymore.”
Draco blushed furiously and Harry thought, if he died right then and there, he would've been a happy man. He was too out of it to notice the frown and guilt on the Blonde's face.
He flinched away when Harry tapped his shoulder, then his eyes widen when he saw who did it.
It was a simple muggle supermarket, one that draco wouldn't have been caught dead in had something not been off and something was definetly off. He was thinner, almost deadly thinner and his eyes had a haunted expression that he only saw once before in the hospital wing following the bathroom incident and never wanted to see again. His jaw had an unmistakable bruise and his neck had fingermarks. Harry instantly saw red at the thought of someone laying a hand on his blonde.
" Always." draco says, looking down at Harry again, then scoots down and leans in, touching his warm lips ever so slightly against Harry's and whispering.
“Alright. What was that veil thing and why wasn’t it bonding us like it was supposed to?”
The brunette was cut off by a slight hiss of agony that the blonde tried to cover with a cough but failed. Harry’s eyes widened. Draco’s face was contorted in pain and his hands were starting to clench into fists again. The brunette instantly reached out and grabbed both of them, not knowing what else to do.
"Can you move?" Harry asked Draco in a voice so low that that he didn't even recognize it. The blonde flushed the toilet, then got up and took two steps. The second he was outside the stall, he collapsed and leaned on the wall for support. He looked at Harry with an apologetic gaze and shook his head.
The brunette just shook his head when he saw the tears running down Draco’s cheeks.
" Then you cannot leave here period!" he shouted at the top of his lungs.  He expected protests from the blonde, but, to his surprise, Draco's shoulders slumped and he dropped down on the far end of the couch, curling in on himself and putting his head in his arms.
"Hey.." Harry said carefully, hating to disturb Draco, but thinking that the scene was too sad to go on. "I don't blame you. You did what you had to do. He raped you. He would've made a terrible father. He forced things on you and you didn't have a choice."
To his delight, Draco grinned widely, took the biscuit, split it in half, then kicked the chocolate off his and devoured the biscuit before handing Harry his own half. Harry simply laughed and did the same, then they continued to do the same until the box was empty.
Taking a deep breath, the blonde approached a boy who looked about his age, and smiled slightly.
But, no. He didn't. He couldn't. And he couldn't because he was pathetic.
Draco jumped upon hearing the brunette’s voice, then blushed violently, having just been caught using Harry’s wand to blow bubbles all around his room.
The worst were the isolation rooms. Harry saw a patient screaming as the doctors dragged her through the hallway telling her to calm down and then locked her inside while she banged on the door to be let out. The room had no windows. It was a prison, Harry decided. A new patient complained about her dog, and how nobody would feed him while she was there. She was crying and begging the nurses to let her call someone, anyone, so the dog, scruffie, wouldn't die while she was in the ward. The nurses ademantly refused. Harry's heart broke. He listened in while she told them her address, determined to help that poor creature. As he made his way to the door, he saw another horrible sight: the nurses holding a screeching patient down, strapping him to the bed and forcibly injecting him with something that made him sleep. They then proceeded to undress him and made notes of his self-harm scars, then dressed him once more in plain, uncomfortable patient clothing, and left the room, locking the door behind them. Harry bolted from the ward, not being able to stay there for a second longer.
Harry reached out to embrace the blonde, but Draco pulled away and seemed intent on leaving the room entirely.
"I am so sorry. I am sorry. How could I be so stupid. Obviously that guy spiked it. Oh wait until I see him again. I'll teach him to mess with... Illegal potions. I guess I can't but I'll teach him a lesson anyways. Oh God if something happened to you, I would never forgive myself. Not after all this time."
Draco waited another minute in silence before sighing and making an attempt to walk out of the bathroom but stumbling slightly. Harry had had enough. He wasn't going to let Draco leave anyway, but having to catch him only made him realize the graveness of the situation.
They all just treated him like a freak, like he's always been treated and he could risk Hermione and Ron being that way. It would just destroy him. But this other person seemed to understand everything so well.
“M-my condition makes me very...sensitive. You’re very important to me, Harry. When I make you mad-”
"Obliviate me!" he yelled. Harry only shook his head in response, not letting go of Draco's arms.
The blonde didn't turn around, continuing to face the shelf in front of him and gripping it tightly. For a moment, Harry thought he didn't hear him and was coming up with something else to say when Draco finally spoke up.
Harry started to cry harder at his words, but, eventually, he nodded against the blonde's chest.
Harry finally decides he's had enough and casts a  spell that let's him know the truth.
Thank you for your comments, kudos, and views! Hope you like this and what comes next!
Only when he got to his dorm did it occur to Harry: the last entry was dated back two years. Malfoy was fine. He was. Wasn't he? Harry should just leave the journal for the blonde to find then get on with his life. No one said Malfoy still felt the same way. No one said he was still thinking about...
“I-er- I told you, Ron! He was hurt. I wanted to stop him,” Harry replied, hoping he sounded convincing. He didn’t need any accusations thrown his way right now. After the red-head grunted in acknowledgment of what Harry was saying, the brunette sighed, looked at Hermione, and asked hopefully “So...er...what’s his diagnosis and how do we fix it?”
"What if I loved you too?" Harry asked quietly, looking at the floor.
"Is everything alright?" Harry asked him, starting to get worried. Draco's left hand continued to pet Scruffie as he sighed and murmured "I found your letters."
"of course, mate."
The elf popped into the room, eyed Scruffie with distaste, then listened intently as Draco listed all of Harry's favorite dishes, and vanished, only to come back with all of them and set them in front of the two men and Scruffie, who panted harshly at the smell of the food.
The blonde exhaled in relief, then opened his other hand and gave Harry the vial to discard. he took it quickly and vanished it, then smiled at his ex-lover who was already showing signs of improvement. He briefly wondered if Draco was faking and his thoughts were still clouding his judgment, but scowled at himself for even thinking about casting the connection spell again. He couldn't do that to Draco. They need to trust each other if whatever this was was going to work out.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, sighing and not really having the energy to comfort Draco. It had been a really horrible day and it hurt that the blonde hadn’t even asked Harry how he felt about the suicide tournament. Draco looked up at him in disbelief through red-rimmed eyes.
The blonde doesn't remember much after that. He just recalled pain as he clawed at the carpet with his hands, dragging his limb body across the sitting room, carefully avoiding Harry's eyes, and into the bathroom. It must've taken him half an hour to get there. When he finally made it to the toilet, he jolted himself up to his knees, stuck two fingers down his throat and coughed up all the remnants of the potions. He hoped it would be enough, but wasn't sure.
"Why would you want that? You finally know the truth."
"I just missed the way you look when you're asleep. Had to get a better angle."
"I knew you were a Moron, Draco, but I didn't think you were this dumb."
"Y-you.." the blonde started, but trailed off. Harry was panicking. He had to keep Draco from leaving, from hating him, from knowing...
“Oh. Y-you said that a long time ago. We’ve gotten closer since then, and I thought-” he started, but Draco cut him off.
"N-no qu-questions." the blonde stuttered out and Harry's heart sank lower. Draco simply couldn't go back to that man. He recalled Draco's question about whether Harry could handle the friendship and, only then did he know, the answer was a definite no. But he couldn't tell draco that. Not yet. He would need to convince him to stay later, but there were more pressing matters to be dealt with at the moment.
" Alright." Harry said slowly," How about we talk about something you want to discuss, then?"
2) I know Harry is being very emotional and he's crying too much. He isn't normally like this, but I imagine this is how one would react when they have never had depression and were suddenly assaulted with it all at once. Draco's feelings and thoughts are too overwhelming and Harry feels completely useless and guilty at not knowing how to help. I guess this is the kind of chapter that shows how any relationship is affected when one person becomes depressed and even more so here because Harry can literally feel what's happening to draco and can't do anything about it.
"draco.." he started and the blonde looked up with that same smile that made Harry want to cry. "Is it alright if I apparate us to my home?"
Just the thought of that brought him back to the same conclusion he often had: I am a terrible person.
"I sucked people in by making them pity me. I-I never deserved your kindness. I forced myself on you and you were too nice to say no."
“Me...my illness. It’s the same thing,” the blonde said bitterly, then buried his face in his arms. Harry didn’t know what to say to that. He didn’t want to suggest healers or pester Draco for details again. The brunette remained sullen and quiet for a few minutes before determination shone in his eyes. Maybe talking just wasn’t the answer. Draco wasn’t going to give him any useful answers anyway. Harry was a bit upset that the blonde wouldn’t confide in him, but, deep down, he understood. Everyone had things they’d rather not talk about. Harry hated it when people forced things out of him. Why was he doing the same thing now?
"... Prepare yourself.."
"What the bloody hell is your problem? I-" Harry starts, but cuts himself off when he sees Draco recoil.
“Can you take my order?”
“If that is all, I need to take my leave right now,” the officiate said, sounding professional again. Harry nodded and murmured, “Thank you.”
Suddenly, Harry's arms were engulfing him and the blonde fought to no avail. He didn't deserve comfort, but Harry, being the kind person that he is, was giving it to him nonetheless. It felt nice. Wrong, but nice. It didn't make any sense.
Draco seemed escastic as he ate, like he hadn't tasted real food in decades. Harry would've normally been content just watching him moaning at the taste with a wide smile on his face and a spark of light in his eyes. But he wasn't. The arms of the clock ticking where like shards of glass digging into every inch of his body, ticking away as his limited time with the blonde made itself known.
"Draco.." he started soothingly and he could've sworn that he saw a small speck of hope flash across his previously dull eyes, but it ended too soon as reporters crowded against Harry asking him about his testimony. He pried his way through the crowd, desperately trying to get to Draco, but he was already gone.
He got up, not wanting to smother Draco but being unable to sit still and wait. It was about 9 pm and neither had had breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Suddenly, Harry had an excuse to be near the blonde. Food!
Harry was about to lie and say no, when he remembered their pact to be honest and how touched Draco was at Harry's normal attitude around him.
He knew it was low. Draco had shared and Harry was using his worries to get him to eat more, but Harry didn't care. Perhaps part of his negative mood was lack of food? Maybe? Hopefully?
"No. And it wasn't a child, whether you want to hear it or not. Five weeks... It can't hear or see and it doesn't have organs and stuff. Please see reason with this. You only removed some cells that would've turned into a child eventually, but they weren't yet. It wasn't murd-"
" You were! And you are right now! Gods Draco-"
“I heard you, but...What? No joke? Nothing to say about my relationship? No little songs about how Harry Potter’s dick doesn’t work? You don’t plan on blackmailing me or going to the Prophet?”
“Of course it is!” Draco suddenly screamed, interrupting Harry. The brunette jerked back at the sudden change of Draco’s tone. The blonde seemed just as surprised judging by how his eyes widened. Draco shook his head slightly, took a deep breath, then continued in a more composed tone: “What I mean is that your comfort is very important to me. I don’t want you to feel bad or guilty or whatever negative emotion you have right now. I can tell that you’re upset, Harry. A-and it was me who upset you-”
“Yes, specials. You do know what a special is, don’t you?”
"oh my poor baby. You're very confused." Jashua had said, gripping Draco's hand tightly, "from what I understood you were feeling down and talking about ending your life. He is the savior after all. He felt obligated. That much is clear."
Draco had to bite his lips after he spoke. He felt a need to just offer to make Harry something, anything that would take the brunette's pain away. Although Harry always looked satisfied when eating Draco's food, the blonde was certain that he was the happier one about it. Seeing Harry that happy just made him feel like nothing else in the world mattered.
Theodore Nott woke up on the floor, he slowly got up and looked over to where Draco and Potter should have been, but they were gone.
" Fuck me .. " he groaned, pushing himself up and out of the room.
"What was that?!" Harry demanded an answer from the distressed boy, who after more heavy breathing slowly rolled on his back and closed his eyes "Nothing to worry about" he slurred weakly.
Was this a sign that Voldemort disowned him? He thought with a smirk.
.....
"Yeah.." potter said lamely.
Potter regarded Draco softly " Why didn't you tell her?"
"What are you going to do?" Draco asked the boy standing over him, he managed to push himself up into a sitting position and watched as Theodore knelt in front of him.
His wand was broken, and Malfoy got his wand back from Harry's person while he was recovering from the sudden apparation.
Harry observed the way he bit his lips as if he had a grudge against them existing, then sighed and laid back on the bed, which made him realise how tired he is and how much he missed having a real bed.
Malfoy's ties disappeared, and Harry turned and walked over to Theodore's wand that fell next to him on the floor.
He wandered aimlessly until he found himself standing in front of a door slightly ajar. Draco pushed it open and paused when he found someone inside.
His straight and pointy nose had dried blood caked in it, his right eye was ruined and puffy and so was his lower lip. Harry cringed at the bruises around his pale neck and the contrast it made with his skin, he couldn't believe that Theodore Nott did this to his own friend, he remembered him in Hogwarts and how he was always with Malfoy the whole time and how even one year there was a rumour that they were actually not just friends, but he doubted that was true now.
"I can't defend us without a wand Malfoy, and I'm clearly better at fighting" Harry challenged Malfoy to disagree but he surprisingly didn't "Okay don't sound too pleased with yourself" he replied, then he added " We stick together until we find you a wand, yeah?" He suggested and Harry had no option but to agree.
"I .. didn't. Well, not really. " he said hesitantly, he shook his head then stood up "thankfully, i know some cleaning spells" Malfoy announced in an obvious attempt to change the subject and as he started throwing spells around, the place became spotless in under a minute.
Harry knelt down near him, panic taking over him as he shook him roughly " Hey! Wake up!"
When they reached their destination, which was one of the bedrooms, Harry laid the boy down on the bed. Once he's successfully done so Harry sat next to him.
Next thing he knew he was being apparated into the middle of nowhere with one Draco Malfoy, whose wand was currently poking his right cheek.
Harry's heartbeat sky-rocketed as he tackled Malfoy to the ground, who yelped in surprise and easily fell to the ground, Harry tried to wrestle the wand out of the pale hands but Malfoy had a death grip on it. They tossed and turned until Harry sat on top of Malfoy's slim frame. He raised his fist, ready to connect it with the blond's face-
Draco sighed and shrugged " I was scared of what might happen if you die. "
The blond boy was suddenly grabbed by his hair and his head was pulled forward, his face inches away from his childhood friend's own face.
Draco immediately went to search for his wand but realized that it was indeed missing too. He sighed and sat on the bed in defeat "So stupid " he  muttered, upset at himself for trusting Potter to stay put and not steal his wand and leave him all alone.
Harry came to with a loud ringing in his ears and a sharp pain in his nose,  his heart was beating fast from the adrenaline as he laid there on the ground staring up into the blue sky and tree branches.
I really should make the chapters longer, I'm new to this thing so bare with me UwU
" How come you've had a change of heart this quick?"
It was a short cycle of Draco throwing up, and Potter  waiting patiently to vanish it.
"Theo, please don't do this"
" Incarcerus !" Was the first thing that came out of Theodore Nott's mouth upon seeing who jumped him from behind, as soon as the spell hit Draco his limbs got bound and he fell on top of the brunette.
" What are you going to do now? " he asked in a flat tone, Potter hesitated for a moment before answering " ideally? Find my friends so we can finish finding all the horcruxes Voldemort scattered around."
"Draco!"
" Are you going to tell me why we're here?" Harry demanded as he observed Malfoy, who was doing exactly the same thing.
There was a loud sigh.
Harry's eyes went from the blond boy's bruised face to his ruined clothes.
When no response came he felt for a pulse on his neck and was immediately relieved to find it.
" Expelliarmus!"
" I think you'd know if you did"
" Theo! What are you doing?!"
"So you no longer support Voldemort?" Harry simply asked and Malfoy chuckled " If that makes you sleep better at night, sure Potter"
Theodore smiled down at him "shhh .. it's okay" he whispered "Everything will be alright"
" shit " he muttered under his breath.
Draco's interest was peaked, he turned to look at Potter "Horcruxes? "
"That's because you kidnapped me" Harry countered and Malfoy sighed " if i lower my wand are you sure you're not going to attack again?"
, Draco wondered to himself as he spotted stairs that lead down to the first floor and he took them down,  miraculously managing not to take a fast trip to his grave by falling down the steps and breaking his neck.
Malfoy slowly looked back up at Harry, and Harry saw himself reflected in Malfoy's face. He seemed exhausted and just tired of everything, and Harry couldn't help but feel the same.
"shouldn't we set up some wards so no one can find us? " Harry thought out loud as he went and sat on the bed, when no reply came he looked up and found the taller boy still at the same spot, with his mind seemingly far away.
"We should save the chatter, we need to get somewhere safe."Harry watched as Malfoy got up and slowly extended an arm "Come on, i know a place'"
"You were screaming bloody murder Malfoy, it sounds like i need to be worrying about it considering you're the one with the bloody wand in here!" Harry argued with the pale boy lying at his feet, who slowly sat up and sighed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Look at me, Draco" he murmured softly and Draco looked up, their eyes met and Theodore continued " cooperate. So that hopefully when the dark lord hears how eager you were to fix your fuckups , he won't let your parents watch when they .. " he paused and smiled at Draco " Well i don't want to spoil the surprise"
Harry stood up and reached for his own wand on impulse, only for the realization to hit him.
" So the trio had been running around and destroying horcruxes all year ? Explains why you were all missing from hogwarts."
Draco crossed the few steps that separated him from Potter and stood infront of him. "What .." Draco started, his voice was hoarse and he felt like his throat was slashed up a million times, but he pushed through it. "I don't remember much ... what happened? " Draco watched Potter closely, and noticed how he suddenly became so interested in this room's wallpaper. "Um .. well, Theodore Nott happened?" He scratched his neck as he said this, and Draco's vision started blurring as the events of the assault unfolded.
The handle turned, and the door cracked open.
The sound of dead leaves being crushed brought Draco back to his senses. He hastily got up and realized that the footsteps were getting closer. Draco looked around the room for anything to defend himself with but found nothing. He settled for hiding behind the door and trying to jump the intruder.
Harry tried to remember all the healing spells he knew and he got to work. He was no Hermione, but he could fix a few things here and there if he had to.
After half an hour Harry deemed his work done here until they find actual help or Malfoy wakes up and heals himself. He got up, took out Malfoy's wand out of his pocket and placed it on the small table near the blond's head, then he turned and walked out the door.
"What happened to you? " he wondered out loud but froze when he heard the floorboard creak behind him, he was quick as he spun around and fired off the first spell that came to mind
“You’re a bit feverish.”
“That’s not an excuse, Hope! You can’t keep blasting things just for the fun of it!”
Harry was still in a state of shock when he met the others in the corridor. Sirius was more surprised than Harry was to know that Severus delivered babies. It was something that none of them was expecting, except Remus. Sirius looked at his lover with distrust.
Draco quickly cut him off, "I can give you a cheering ice-cream! Or coffee ice-cream! You love those!"
“No!” Alfred immediately denied. I couldn’t say whether he was telling the truth or not.
Harry seemed more relief after hearing that. When he left, Draco turned to Nathan and said, “Although we are out of the water, the real reason why I sent Harry away was to thank you, Nathan.”
"Did I ever tell you that Sirius is going to visit me? He’s in France," Harry started babbling. "He met someone there. He said he would bring her next week. Gee! It’s a little hot in here!"
Hermione only raised her hand to shush him and turned her back on him. Ron sighed.
“No, I don’t think so. I’m just... tired,” Draco whispered. “Where am I?”
As I thought about the episode, and how icy Harry’s voice must have sounded when dealing with that issue, I smiled. Of course that bunch of good for nothings wouldn’t have the courage to forbid Granger to soil their precious Club with her presence. She was, after all, one of Harry’s best friends. Whatever Harry wanted he had it. Not to mention that Granger really was a brilliant witch. Still, wasn’t it strange that the Club had let them in just now?
She kissed him on his cheek. "Bye."
“Do you love him?” This time Harry looked straight into his eyes. “Do you love Seamus?”
“And I can teach my cute little nephew how to stop saying wanna and gonna,” Sirius said. “Honestly, Harry, what are you teaching him? Shouldn’t he be in school already? You and Draco are terrible teachers!”
Ron laughed.
"Please leave." he whispered in a shaky, terrified voice. Harry looked around, hoping to find what the blonde was so desperately afraid of and coming up with nothing.
Harry is shaking his head because he doesn't understand anything. Obliged? When was Harry ever obliged? Help him again? What was he talking about? The trials?
The question was out of his mouth before he could think about it. Then, it was too late and Draco was releasing shaking breathes, trying to stop his tears. Harry didn't want that. He just wanted Draco to be fine, not pretend to be fine!
"did you mean what you said?" he asks very quietly.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes pleadingly. Only then did Harry see that Draco was still crying. The blonde cupped harry's cheek with the hand not holding onto his waist, then swiftly let it go and returned to hugging Harry's chest. For once, Draco's thoughts matched his words.
"There isn't." Draco whispered, and silence followed. He didn't dare look at Harry and the tear streaks on his face. Harry was now his enemy. Keeping him from Jashua, taking all that was left of Draco's control, which wasn't very much. The blonde supposed it didn't matter. He had no control to begin with, but he truly didn't expect Harry to abuse his power.
Harry stretches and yawns, a faint smile on his face from waking up to the blonde in the morning.
He didn't even know how he got there, but suddenly, Harry was on the floor sobbing harder than he ever had in his entire life, touching Draco all over as if to reassure himself that he's real, silently begging him to forgive Harry for letting him walk away after the trials. He knew this would happen. He knew it would. He had had a feeling and he should always trust those. He did, but it was too late. He started to imagine what would've happened had the blonde been successful. Harry's last memory of him would have been reporters tearing them apart and him standing there looking like a ghost of who he once was. This all made Harry cry harder and suddenly the blonde was comforting him and hugging him , even though Harry was sure it was very painful for him. He didn't  mention leaving again until Harry was completely quiet and sniffling while tucked beneath Draco's chin and cuddling up to his chest.
Draco simply smiled then got back in the bed, when Harry suddenly cast a lumos. He had been doing that all night. Waking up, casting the spell, then, after he made sure Draco was there and in one piece, cast a nox and cuddled up to the blonde again with a happy sigh.
Fighting off tears, Harry threw on his invisibility cloak and went into the emergency room, then followed a nurse with a file, until he finally found it and was immediately overwhelmed. The filling room was a complete mess and he too afraid to use magic least someone walk in and see things floating around. He was sorely tempted though. It took Harry hours to find Draco's name, but it was worth it. He was finally going to see what was wrong with Draco and how he could help him. That was invaluable. His hope diminished as he read through the case. Apparently, Draco had spent months in the ward to no avail and the nurses noted he was worse when he left.
The brunette just nodded silently.
Harry continued to gap at him, not believing what he was hearing.
Harry had so far done everything on the list but the second and he didn't think it would be a good idea, considering the blonde shared a house with that horrid man. None of the things seemed to help so far. The seventh one, which he refused to even acknowledge, asked Harry to be patient, but how could he be patient when he was watching his Draco slip through the cracks of life? How was that even possible. No. The books were useless. The doctors were useless. Even Ron was making everything worse, walking on eggshells around Harry at work as if he would break at any moment. The brunette had even taken several separate cases to avoid his best friend. This was up to Harry and Harry alone and he would help Draco if it's the last thing he did.
