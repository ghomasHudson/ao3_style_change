“It’s time,” he said in a low voice. Ginny spun and flung an arm around him, and after a moment’s surprise, he hugged her tightly enough to frighten her.
in his eyes. It sliced deep inside where her memories of Ron dwelt, and the last night she’d seen his face alive. The moment when she just… just knew. Impossible. There was no way that Seamus could know anything. But she could see that he did.
There was nothing he could do to change it now, no backtracking and fixing to make things finally go his way for a change. If he could have done that, he might as well have gone back to a time before Pansy slipped into Voldemort’s shadow as a spy, or stopped himself from sleeping with Theodore that first night.
It could have been hours, or minutes. The winding cobblestone streets had long since become a maze. The buildings plunged the narrows into purple shadow as he crept along. He could hear the sounds of magic, but did not know which direction they came from. Always, always he turned a corner and came across a smoking hole, the limp body of a Death Eater or the staggering form of an Order member. On Stonegate Street, a Muggle woman ran smack into him from an open doorway, letting out a cry and pushing past without even seeming to see him.
Hermione had no idea. “Ask.”
Pomfrey squinted at her, a disturbing amount of curiosity in her eyes. “How so?”
They reached the front atrium moments later, and Harry gave Oliver a nudge toward the stairs with his elbow. “Go on. I’ll tell Moody I kept you.”
“Better,” he said, truthfully. “I’m not hurting like I was. Just sometimes, when he is.”
“Something’s wrong,” Harry muttered. Draco wanted to laugh. Of
“Then we can’t just leave him out there,” Oliver said. “Anyone could find him, and if he’s not himself—”
Weasley’s face was buried in her hands.
He opened his eyes.
wife,” Harry whispered, mostly to himself.
“Where to?”
*	*	*
was making that noise. God, how long had the attack been going on?
“Where is she, Malfoy?”
“Cheers, Luna,” Ron said drowsily from below. Hermione nodded her thanks and took a sip.
Hermione stood breathless at the foot of the staircase, wand out. The student she’d saved turned to her, wide-eyed, and Hermione watched as the boy’s legs gave out, dropping him in the hallway next to the downed Death Eater.
“He’s alright, you know,” she said carefully, fully aware of the dual meaning. Harry leaned back until she could meet his eyes.

Harry frowned. “Why not?”
No curses in this library.
he snarled. The room tilted and he slid sideways without another word. Moody’s reaffirmed grip on his shoulders righted him before he hit the floor.
In one fluid arch, Harry pushed him back into the wall. Draco felt the unrelenting pressure against his groin, felt Harry’s equal hardness there. Harry rolled his hips upward deliberately and Draco gasped, knocking his head on the stones. He grasped at Harry’s shirt, pulling him in by the waist of his trousers, but Harry’s hands darted, fumbling with his fly. Draco shoved himself bodily off the wall, trying to… to what? Harry was stronger, better balanced, and Draco only succeeded in pressing them closer, chest to chest. Harry’s hand slid down inside his pants and closed around him. Draco let out a breathless moan. His legs felt wobbly and weak. Harry pushed a knee between his thighs and held him up, and Draco could only clutch onto firm shoulders and inhale sharply as Harry stroked him. Hard strokes, fast, unrelenting. Draco writhed, thrusting into it, clenching his hand in Harry’s hair and pulling. Harry’s throat smelled of sweat and cedar. Draco turned his head and kissed, bit down at the soft skin there, felt Harry’s entire body ripple uncontrollably.
Harry didn’t believe him. Even if Remus believed himself, Harry couldn’t.
that—”
The pain dissolved into pure and convulsing pleasure.
Moody’s magical eye rolled upon him avidly. “Whose spell?”
Magic had rules that a mere human being could never hope to break. A random prophecy turned into truth by an overzealous and terrified wizard had been more than enough, Harry’d thought. But to have it manifest as it eventually had… Exactly how random were prophecies, really? It was beside the point, now; Dumbledore had said as much, many times, every time Harry had needed to hear it, to stiffen his resolve. It was just… hard, knowing death was most definitely in the cards now.
“I’m so edgy,” Seamus whispered. “Not myself.”
Like a brush of breeze, she felt it: the searching tingle of a seeking spell over her arms. Hermione squeezed Ginny’s wand and stared into the darkness. The spell roved over her shoulders and up into her hair. Hermione grimaced, fighting the urge to cry. She’d not lost him. He was near… but not near enough, unless she used the wand. The spell sang enticingly over her flesh and then pulled back. Disappeared.
Oddly enough, the contempt in his voice made her relax.
If the pub building was still standing.
Real alarm threaded through Harry’s thoughts. He drew back. “Draco, what is it?”
having sex, just that his body and his mind and the tidal thump of his blood understood.
“Draco Malfoy?” Harry spat. He had to laugh; he couldn’t help it. “You can’t mean to tell me you always… That’s impossible, you had no way of knowing.”
“Luna’s lowering the wards,” Harry said faintly.
“He’s going to bond, Blaise. With someone. Like you and Seamus.” Draco fisted a handful of Blaise’s sheet. “Gods. And then he’ll fight. And who knows what will happen?”
arrived. She knew how important it was to him. And Harry had greeted everyone at the door so far. Granted, there were only three others who had come staggering in, but he’d welcomed them all, until George and Fred arrived. He chewed his lip and thought about going to Luna’s room to ask.
Again, Draco’s grip tightened. Harry tried to send a sense of calm through the bond, but Draco resisted.
Blaise confirmed the still-empty hallway over his shoulder and hunkered down next to the closed door. No visible signs of spellwork. He pulled out his wand and gripped it. If the hissing hadn’t called her, then this would. With all the inherent magic in this section, the Death Eaters might not feel such a tiny spell, but a snake would sense the change in pressure, no matter how slight.
When George retired to his bed to gain his own rest, Seamus whispered to Blaise, a low mantra, “Come back, come on, come back to me, come back, come back.”
“He said Cruciatus.” Seamus kneaded his forehead. “And he… It sounded like Mordeocunctor.”
Harry knew Dumbledore was not speaking of merely bringing Ginny through the Death Eaters safely. The enormity of the larger choice, the entire war—hell, he himself had made it years ago—threatened to engulf him once again. He could only shake his head. Arguing with Dumbledore, especially over the intricacies, had never been an easy thing to do.
Harry had asked. He was doing what Harry wanted.
George’s was potions-induced, but Fred was sleeping the sleep of exhaustion and she found she didn’t want to wake him.
“She stepped away from me and she moved through the fair…”
“Could he have cast some sort of protection over himself?” Moody growled. “Something to keep him going for long enough to escape? A form of Vivacis or Durabilis?”
“No, no, it’s here. It
“I’m tired,” he muttered. “I’d like to sleep.”

he here for, if not… not…
Something was building within Harry, burgeoning and feverish. He’d only given voice to it once, when she’d first suggested undertaking this spell, and Luna had gazed at him for so long he had wondered at what he’d said. He couldn’t give voice to this, not the truth of it. It had become selfish, and Harry had been shaken free of that reality long ago.
“You’re alright?” Harry asked, looking uncertain.
The first word Draco had spoken in hours. Harry’s body tried to freeze. He looked up, wondering what had prompted it, and what would follow.
He spun around. “What in god’s name are you—”
He’d never realised until now how much the dreams, the anticipation, of what had just happened had driven him. And now...
But the Healer looked distinctly troubled. She turned to Ginny again. “And did anything… out of the ordinary happen while you were in their care?”
His mind tried to sling itself away, tilting abruptly enough to dizzy him, but another sound rapped out, dispelling the throb that tried to surface.
his mind hissed.
“Happy almost Christmas.”
When she returned for a second glance, his expression was blank again, body rigid. It was as though he’d never moved.
“What in Merlin’s—”
Seamus didn’t answer. He only took the cigarette back and took a long drag. His eyes closed; a shiver passed through his limbs, and suddenly Harry knew there was a magical property to the cigarette.
“Blaise is dead.”
Harry had to go three floors before he found everyone he sought, but Luna’s song kept his mind focussed for long enough to locate Remus in the makeshift Potions lab. Moody had set it up in one of the neglected ballrooms downstairs. Harry felt sure Luna could have directed all three of his targets to Hermione more easily, but he found he needed to move, relished the strain on his leg muscles as he climbed and descended the stairs, traversed hallways. By the time Remus had gathered up his initial experiment results and departed, however, Harry’s whole body was re-centering, drawing tightly around the only thing it could seem to handle these days.
“Draco,” she started. His head lifted sharply, expression smoothed with surprise. Ginny licked her lips, his first name tasting foreign on her tongue. “Why did Harry pick you to do this?”
“Harry?”
Harry’s mouth twisted into a hard grimace. He raised a hand in front of his face. “Seamus, it’s not his fault.”
Something smacked into his forehead and Blaise jerked back, throwing up a hand. His fingers hit metal, just at the level of his ear. He grabbed it, barely stilling his own flight. Cold bands of metal wrapped round and round each other to form a cup of some kind. Just like the wall sconces in the halls. Blaise gave up on the wall itself and scrabbled at the sconce, feeling his way over rusted metal with shaking hands. Long, smooth… the handle of a torch. Blaise yanked at it but it held fast. He pulled again, breath hissing between his teeth, and finally the torch broke free with a loud crack. He spun around and ran with all his might for the door, unable to stop himself. Fell out into the still-empty hallway.
Draco swallowed hard.
She nodded, feeling awkward. What must that be like? The idea, as romantic as it sounded, repulsed her slightly. How did a bonded person keep her own head? How would she know that her thoughts were hers? If she were bonded to Harry, would she have his nightmares?
Draco wondered when Ginny Weasley would become a statistic to him. Why hadn’t she already? She should have been the first; it was much easier to remove someone’s humanity if one already disliked the person. But, fuck it all, he wasn’t even sure about that anymore. It wasn’t enough anymore, being a Weasley. The name had been synonymous with
Blaise came to a turn and stopped. He pressed against the wet wall and listened. Nothing but the dripping. He peered around the corner. Another empty corridor, eerie in yellowish light. There were no pillars this time, just the sweating walls. He drew a breath and went down the hall at a silent run, feeling the vulnerability of each step as though it were a stutter in his heart.
“Wrong?” Draco snapped. “Of course it’s
Ginny jerked, staring at Harry. His voice had changed. Very subtly—if she hadn’t been focusing on every detail, she would have missed it. He didn’t even register her movement. Ginny swept his face, heart climbing into her throat, and right then, Draco answered.
Draco ended up sleeping for four hours, on his back with his head turned into the pillow. His hair was a haphazard mess, dull in the afternoon light. Harry got up at one point and stood by the window, watching the rise and fall of Draco’s chest. Faster than usual. Not as deep.
“Tried to protect me. They killed her for it.”
Malfoy didn’t respond; he didn’t
Ginny frowned at him. Was he
“Hey, leave off. That’s my lager.”
Harry smiled down at her tenderly. “Let’s get you to bed.”
Harry studied her, then placed the flute to his lips.
Glancing back, she saw the gulf between Seamus and Blaise. The light streaming through the door between their two forms felt heavy. They would stand apart in deference to Malfoy until the door shut them from her sight. Ginny found herself wishing to see what happened once the wards rose behind her: Seamus would reach out and Blaise’s eyes would at last uncloud,
But the words died somewhere in her throat. Any answer Harry could have given would be too unyielding. Ginny was beginning to realise that neither answer would leave her feeling good.
“I can’t ask this of them.”
**originally posted 3/22/07**
Harry looked back toward the way he’d come, and Seamus got it. He let out a faint snort. “Oh. No, Harry. I’m not sick. Not like him.”
It felt like hours, but it was clearly a day at the very least—how had he lost time? It was a struggle just to shake his head, to clear enough room to think. Harry felt drugged, buried under some invisible mound that hung from his limbs and grasped at each thought, trying to pull him down.
But there, he simply could not go. Malfoy’s losses still sang eerily in his dreams at night. He shook his head and stopped talking. Words were the poorest of threads for such a tapestry, and yet, he’d been weaving this one all his life.
Katie stared at him. Harry ground his teeth. He whipped back to Malfoy. “Why are you here? What possible reason?”
“Yes,” Ron muttered. His fingers closed around the door knob, flexed once, and pulled it open.
In all ways. It was a rush Harry couldn’t have anticipated. He pushed his hands down the back of Draco’s trousers and pressed him close.
“Where are you, Zabini?”
put the wards up?”
Malfoy smoothed his shirt and bent again. One hand disappeared back into his satchel, and after moment, his entire body just… stilled. One moment he was tense, balancing on the balls of his feet, and the next, all the movement had simply deserted his frame. He was looking at something but whatever it was remained out of sight in the pack.
it, really want it. It’s much bigger than anything any of us have come across before, I assure you. The way it crafts itself to the individuals involved—” She stopped, seemingly at a loss to encompass the notion in words. But Harry knew. He’d read it as well, and he understood the vastness of the very idea.
“Do you know what he’s doing?” Her voice was unsteady.
And what if this snake wasn’t here at all? Nagini. Potter had told Blaise her name. The snake often went where Voldemort went, or so the Order’s information said. Pansy had confirmed more than once that the serpent remained in the compound often enough when her master had departed, but it was hit or miss. The whim of any given day. And if Voldemort himself were here, then Blaise had already called something much larger and darker down upon his own head.
Below the tangle in his gut, his body burned, right at the center. He moaned, dragging at Draco. Draco could make it stop, surely he had to. He was the only one. The how of it didn’t penetrate, only the understanding that if it didn’t end, Harry would shatter.
ing noise, nodded, and once again made for the door. He paused just inside, however, and peered at Malfoy where he stood in the shadows. Hermione picked out open deliberation on Moody’s features right before he turned away. He left the room, his false leg thumping down the hall.
“Draco are you even listening?” Pansy’s voice broke my trance. I turn to see her with her hands on her slim hips and her head tilted.
"Pardon my reach" I put his plate down then feel a rough hand brush across my face into my hair. My neck snaps to see the prince rolling a lock of my hair in his fingers.
“You look stunning doll” His voice washes over me like hot chocolate on a cold night. I snap my eyes open and rip the sheets off of me. My skin feels too hot, my clothes start to cling to my body. I can feel the sweat drip down my neck and run the length of my back. I look into my lap and see my cock making a tent out of my sleeping pants.
“Harry fuck me, please! I can’t…” The please becomes too much for Draco, white streaks land on his chest and even his chin as he finally comes. Harry finally looks up to see his husband is a mess. Dracos eyes are rolled back into his head, heavy breathing and a thin sheen of sweat covers his body
And with that, she turned away from him and marched into Draco Malfoy’s room. Kingsley was left baffled. No one had ever talked to him like that, even if it hadn’t been about him. But then again, no one would send the partner of a coma patient away from their lover, yet that was exactly what Miss Parkinson did, as he could see through the window.
To his own surprise, he could see his hands were shaking when he put the kettle on. In all the hectics, his body hadn’t been allowed to respond to the shock of his best friend showing up at his doorstep with a recording of his dark, close to suicidal thoughts. That didn’t exactly happen on a daily basis.
One too many time I have seen people die just because they could not get over the shame to ask for help, or the idea that they were not worth it, or that they did not want to bother people. And by one too many times, I mean I have seen all of my friends hurt themselves by
(See the end of the chapter for
He’d criticised with that characteristic twinkle in his eyes.
“That’s it, love. Just drink it. Just relax.” Someone was putting a hand through her hair but the potion made her fall asleep so fast she couldn’t see who it was. Probably Mrs. Weasley though. That woman was too caring for this world. “Go to sleep Narcissa. Forget about everything for a bit. I’m sure we’ll have good news for you once you wake up.”
Revealing your name to me is a big step, but everything should be fine as these matches are made to be most beneficial to you by my superiors. They had a good reason to pick me for you and it does not have to change anything between us, except for that you can now talk more freely.
Potter laughed in surprise. “You watched
“Two bonds?” Harry said, but Draco already knew. Gods, he knew.
Draco’s heart knocked into his ribs. He turned Theodore carefully, laying him on his back on firmer ground. The rain lashed his face, streaking through the red and baring the pale skin of his chin. Theodore smiled ruefully up at Draco.
Sloper glared, but ultimately stalked from the room, whispering something to Tonks as he passed. For her part, the Metamorphmagus remained in the doorway. But her eyes were still clouded with sorrow. “Harry… Can’t let you alone with him. Not without—”
“His condition is precarious,” Pomfrey said, as though she were anxious for other talk. “But that isn’t the reason you’re here. This concerns you intimately. His state right now is of great concern to all of us.”
“Of course he will, Weasley,” was all he said.
“Did it feel better at all?”
you’ll just get a feeling in your bones when we get close enough?”
If she could have believed Draco capable of such a—Ginny’s chin jerked and she forced herself to be still. Incongruous. Dra—
Blaise caught her eye when she was several beds away. Ginny opened her mouth, more startled than anything else. Kept going, and almost sat down on Seamus in her unsteadiness when she reached Blaise’s bedside. Ginny jumped up from the other mattress, but Seamus never moved. He was asleep, his body sunk into the bed with exhaustion. He looked like he hadn’t moved in hours.
Blaise studied him. Something new shadowed his eyes. “I won’t drag him along with me, if that’s what you—”
“The goal is clear,” Harry said before he could begin to wallow. “Voldemort will be controlling his army through the Mark. To win whatever battle is coming, he must be destroyed, and I don’t just mean killed. He still has one existing Horcrux to fall back on. That Horcrux is me. Ergo, I also have to die.”
“Are you alright?” Draco rasped, barely words at all. He rolled onto his side, hands climbing over Harry’s face. Harry felt them shaking, enough to shake
Her attention wandered again. What had she been thinking about a second ago? Well, it was gone now, whatever it was. To wherever thoughts went to take the piss. Hermione snickered to herself. The crackling of the fire and the splitting of the large logs pulsed heat into the hall. Hermione thought she’d never seen the room so brightly lit. But the firelight wasn’t reaching everywhere. She squinted, not caring that she was blatantly staring.
“No,” the older woman said, very crisply. “No, she’s not. She’s Apparated too often in too short a period of time. It could be days before she recovers fully. Weeks. I have no way of knowing here. And the longer you keep the two of us out of my Infirmary, the less of a chance I’ll have to figure out what she’s done to herself!”
“As I said, it’s a raw bond.” Her lips turned downward. “There are loose edges—I’m sorry. It’s quite hard to put it into the proper words.”
Cool fingers slipped around his wrist, and Harry jumped. Draco stood inches away, paused in mid-step beside Harry as though he’d stopped merely to listen to Luna’s song. He squeezed Harry’s wrist, gave him the slightest of tugs.
Harry felt ill. He made himself meet Dumbledore’s eyes. “You expected this? This—” He couldn’t name it; it was too big for words. The pull, the endless ache to be close to Draco, beat through him steadily. Patiently.
She opened her mouth and sang, “And fondly I watched her…” and at the same moment, her voice sounded in Harry’s head.
“Well. I feel so much better now that I know that.”
In spite of the darkness, the weird wash of moonlight and the thrumming of her nerves, Ginny smiled. In a few days…
“Let me.” He ran his forefinger along the line of the scar. It vanished under his fingertip until Harry’s forehead was serene. Unblemished.
“Harry—”
And now Blaise was dying.
She took Ginny’s wand from where she’d tucked it between her knees. Only the patter of rain stood in her way, the sighing of the wind. Hermione skirted the blockade of fallen buildings. When she reached the place where the cross-street had been, she perused the area carefully. The wind, funneled into a whistle down the narrow street, whipped at her hair. But aside from the creak of timber and odd flap of ragged curtain, there was only stillness.
“No.”
“I can’t—not do this,” he hissed into Harry’s ear. “I feel like you’re pulling me, like I’m—” He took Harry’s face in his hands, moving back until Harry felt each exhalation across his lips. Draco’s mouth kept seeking his, needy brushes, as though Draco couldn’t quite pull away. “I want this. Do you understand? I
Harry hissed. “Yes, Draco, I would have! And I’m not supposed to, but I wouldn’t have been able not to.”
Blaise shot the petrifying spell again and rushed forward. The snake snapped her head out like lightning and Blaise hit the ground, rolling out of the way. His shoulder crunched hard against the stone floor and he forced himself to his feet, hearing her coming. He spun, not thinking about it, just knowing instinctively. Her head was right there, glossy and grotesque. He hit it merely by chance, snapping her head away, and seized at the thick abdomen with both hands.
But Fleur’s dirty, elegant hands closed around her companion’s shoulders. The flash in her eyes was enough to drive the closest of the others back.
“What?” Harry muttered, and Draco moved restlessly.
“That right there is disgusting, Hermione. Bad influence, your friends. You shouldn’t hang around us anymore.”
Dumbledore looked out the window at the rain. “You must know what you will create from this. You must understand it, and Draco must understand as well. Should you choose to go this route, there will be a great deal of darkness in the binding, for you both bring it with you.”
Ginny looked around skittishly, ending with her eyes on Harry. He could see her relief, but the new anxiety was palpable as well. “Only us? Isn’t Seamus the one who—”
“Draco,” he forced out.
Harry had asked him specifically, after all.
Hermione felt inexplicably happy. Comforted. As though all the warmth of the wine and fire and laughter were filtering down into her bones. Bloody hell, she didn’t even know Blaise. Did she?
A pause. Draco tried to open his eyes and found his eyelids too heavy. Harry spoke again.
How long would the castle hold up?
Oh gods, what had he done? He could have just let her go, there in the forest. Left her to them. Watched as they dragged her away from the task she’d been set to do, forever. He could have… he could have let her die and been done with it. But he hadn’t. He’d thrown himself to the wolves instead, but he hadn’t died, as he’d expected—hoped? He’d come through it, thanks to the very person he’d sacrificed himself for. He’d gotten them both to the safety of ancient magic, and now, now he was going to get her the rest of the way, to the castle, to—
He wanted to laugh at the absurdity. Here, at least, was something they had in common.
Ginny fisted her cloak. She could see nothing out there except windblown grass. The implications of such a strong magical shield tried to stagger her, but she was too tired to feel much.
.........
The stillness swarmed in, blanketing them both, and in that insignificant pin-drop space, the feeling twisting in her gut took shape. She gaped at him, unable to stop, the thought coalescing with the speed of lightning.
Did he mean the two of them personally, or everyone? Harry wasn’t sure if either choice would make a difference in how the statement made him feel. As usual, Remus was right. All those years of contemplation, another war and other losses, made his observations calm and steady, and of course, wise. But also resigned, and it was from there that the uneasiness struck at Harry.
Hermione grimaced at him and tried to sit up. Her arms weren’t cooperating. “What are you on about, Ronald?” she huffed. “I don’t get p… pissed.”
Seamus broke away long enough to tilt his head toward Blaise’s ear. His lips moved soundlessly—who could hear a thing over this music?—and Blaise’s hand found Seamus’, lifting it from where it rested against his side and settling it on his knee instead. Their fingers wove together and before long, their heads were bent and they were entirely involved in each other’s mouths again.
Fuck. That she had experienced herself. So Draco loved Harry Potter. So did she. There was no shame in it; she could hardly berate Draco for falling for so worthy a person. Was such a commonality so difficult to accept? Ginny chewed her lip. Draco’s hypothetical sacrifice was going to ensure that there would be an end to this war; it was a glimpse at a pain Ginny wasn’t sure she could bear herself. And he hadn’t said a word.
Nothing.
but the idea that it wasn’t meant for him and had never been snapped the noose taut. It hurt to breathe.
“So Blaise is injured?” Remus prompted. He leaned against the table, hands clasped in front of him.
Draco’s fury rose in response to the righteousness in Harry’s stance. Because it was all true, but it was all completely unfair, and he hated it, and Harry. “Oh, that’s pretty. Our last chance? How many last chances have you witnessed? You don’t know how many people I’ve watched die for your cause. In your
“Shit.,” Harry stopped flat in the hallway. His bones hurt. His muscles panged in a spiteful reminder of how he’d spent his morning. And the futility of this walk, this attempt to make everything right again—things that couldn’t be made right, he was in the middle of a fucking war—struck hollowly on his nerves.
Blaise’s expression washed clean of all strain. “I feel good, Draco. Better than a couple days ago. It’s… It’s about him, do you see? It’s because I have him at all.” He shook his head. “Hard to explain.”
Dean’s brow furrowed. He studied Malfoy’s wand for a moment. “No.” He slapped the wand into Harry’s outstretched palm. “Gave it over as soon as he saw us.”
Something lurked behind the grey, words or thoughts, Harry couldn’t tell, but they had not been uttered, even in the gentling sunset through his windows. Draco’s body sprawled across Harry’s bed, limbs entangled in and against Harry’s, and yet oddly separate.
Seamus Finnigan stared up at her from the landing on the third floor, arm outstretched to block a small group of students.
“They’ll fight for you, Harry, whatever you’re planning to do.”
He didn’t remember much of that week, only that somehow he’d completed whatever mission he was on. At night he heard Seamus’ heartbeat in his head, tugging his pulse into an ill-fitting tandem.
She wasn’t looking at him. Wasn’t looking at the Death Eaters either. She was staring at the ground, her eyes unfocussed. He opened his mouth, but there was nothing waiting there. So he stared after their departing pursuers instead. He squeezed her fingers against the stone.
But somehow, Draco had managed to gain Harry’s trust. Hermione had expressed concern two years ago, though Ginny didn’t know if she’d said anything to Harry himself. But eventually even Hermione let it go. Hell, Ron had refused to rail about it after a fashion, and it had been a hub of many, many fights between Ginny and her brother. Ron had said that in the end, it didn’t make a difference how many times she shouted at Harry to be reasonable. The cold, hard truth was that Draco Malfoy had passed Veritaserum under the judgment of not only Harry, but the five heads of the Order as well, including McGonagall, Moody, and Remus Lupin, who had more than enough reason to want Draco thrown out or even killed.
**originally posted 5/17/07**
“He’s sleeping. Truly sleeping,” she added, “not spell-induced.”
Pomfrey shook her head. “It’s vital that you both listen to me very closely. Seamus is the one who found Blaise, and he is the one who kept Blaise alive. It was Seamus’ magic my spells were reacting to, as if I were casting them on him instead.”
And yet it had happened. Somehow, the impenetrable castle had been reduced to a burnt-out shell of masonry and broken glass. Scattered parchment, singed draperies twisting across a blackened lawn. The forest, rising up in flames.
Her palms were bleeding. Ginny stared at the four arced cuts from her fingernails. Draco got heavily to his feet.
“Oh, no.
“Have they,” she said, flat.
An instant later, he wished he hadn’t said it. Draco’s body stiffened. His eyes opened, but he wasn’t looking at Harry, had turned his head instead to stare at the bed curtains. His voice was flat. “I told her to run. And then I went…” Draco’s lips thinned. “But she didn’t listen. She came back.”
The tide of Harry’s moods spoke silently about where his mind truly was, who his thoughts were with. Tears filled Ginny’s eyes and she was glad he was looking away, lost in whatever ruminations her last words had conjured. But she needed to see it one more time.
He looked up, saw her familiar oval face and her hair twisting haphazardly over her shoulders. The small, concerned press of her lips. Draco’s golden hair was a beacon-fuzz in the corner of his eye. Harry looked away.
“Then she stepped away from me, and this she did say…”
“I didn’t know,” Harry whispered from his place on the floor.
On the night of 24 December, 1998, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was destroyed.
Harry dropped at last, utterly spent, across Draco’s body. Trickles of almost-pain shot through him, every touch against his skin an electric shock. He groaned, enduring it helplessly, waiting for it to subside. His mind… was a mush. He could only breathe, and taste the flavour of Draco’s skin and sweat on his lips. He felt legs clench around him, then release and drop away. With the last of his coherent thought, Harry raised himself from the heaving body of his lover and dropped to his side on the bed.
He saw—
That was all it took; Ginny flung herself up the last few steps and into his arms. He caught her in a grip she’d missed and the smell of him overwhelmed her senses.
“It’s stronger than anything I’ve ever seen, any of the recognised bindings I know of. The things it’s doing… It’s capable of incredible things. I believe it is the same bond as the one you’ve been preparing for.”
Her eyes were full of despair. “There’s nowhere to—”
him for the rest of her life. It was a frightening prospect. She would know him better than she knew herself, taste him and hear him and dwell within him. And she loved him. She would do anything for him, and he knew that, damn it, knew it and returned the feeling tenfold. He was for her; he was not for Draco Malfoy.
He barely knew it had stopped until he saw Lestrange’s face looming out of the gloom. She spat on him.
The ice in his tone curled Ginny’s insides. Why did it hurt to hear him speak like that? He meant very little to her, and she even less to him. But that wasn’t true, and the quailing in her belly reminded her of it. Harry was still watching Draco. Ginny summoned her voice.
“Ron!” she shouted, but another blast, this time yellow, took the sound away. “Ron!”
He stopped. It took Hermione a few sluggish seconds to realise that he was listening. The tense look on his face relaxed and was replaced by something resembling awe. Harry shook his head. “Alright,” he murmured.
“Well we can’t have that, can we?” Harry snorted. “What are we if not a dumb idiot and a posh git?”
Recorded Draco sounded seconds away from hyperventilating. Real life Draco looked ashamed of himself, staring a hole in the edge of the rug as he tried to move away from Neville. Not that Neville let him do that. He couldn’t listen to this and
That is not to say that you should not try out other things however, because sometimes writing doesn’t help, or it is not enough, or you just need a change of pace. In that case, like I said, a talk group or an immersive hobby (one of my friends does free diving in her spare time. It is a muggle thing where you dive with just you and your swimsuit and nothing else) can really help. Be careful what you choose though. Having a risky hobby combined with a fluctuating mental state can go wrong fast. My tip: don’t get into wine tasting, it does not end well.
But then it gets dark again. So dark. I know that I can’t change this. What happened when I was younger has shaped me into the person I am now, and in a way I’m grateful. But I’m also angry because it could have been so different for me. The war was just a culmination of how shit (sorry, not sure if I should swear in these letters?) my situation was. Again, this might clue you in as to who I am, but I don’t care anymore. You’ve helped me realise that I haven’t just suppressed memories of the war, but some whole sections of my life.
But in between those peaks, going outside is a great way to relax. Feeling bad about yourself and the world is a lot harder when you are enjoying a cup of tea in the sun. My father became a recluse in the last years of his life, and making someone see the light in their life is a lot harder when they never see the sun. But I will not bother you with those details, as his case is not even remotely close to yours.
anymore. She couldn’t bear it.
He was pulled out of his thoughts by the greeting of his brother. Despite their age difference, he felt so much younger than Ron. Like he was back in the ruins of Hogwarts, trying his best to run from the reality around him rather than helping anyone. He’d been shocked, then, when he saw Ron give instructions, help out, keep a clear head as the smoke of battle cleared. He’d looked then like the adult George couldn’t be even now.
“You’ll have to ask your grandmother, Scorpius. If she’s okay with it, then so am I.”
Draco’s arms tightened around Neville for a moment, before he pulled back and looked at him. His grey eyes were a bit red-rimmed, but to Neville’s delight, he was smiling too. “I don’t want to know what would happen if I didn’t have you as a friend, Neville.”
“Yes, I definitely had too much wine during dinner,” Harry answered in the exact same tone of voice as his rant. “But that doesn't mean that I love or admire you any less.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Giving them a few minutes, she picked up her order pad and made her way back to the booth to take their order. By the time she reached them, she couldn’t sense any awkwardness, just an air of hopefulness.
The first night he met Harry after many years, the week after Scorpius had finally been let out of the hospital, they’d just talked. Laughed and cried and drank and talked until the landlord came to kick them out. During the many playdates with their kids, they’d drifted closer together until they couldn’t possibly call each other
A new update will take a while, both my old shitty and my new laptop have died beyond repair and I have no money to replace them
“But you got angry,” Scorpius said, sounding confused. “How can doing good things make you angry?”
Suddenly there was a smile on Harry’s face and a hand beckoning him to come closer. When Neville sat down, he was surprised to find Harry pull him into a hug, not caring that Draco was already in his lap and might wake up like this.
I found myself taking pain killing potions just before dinner each evening, under the disguise of a headache, but in reality I was still numbing myself to what used to happen during dinner in the war. It took me two years to finally realise I was doing that, and even longer to fully stop. Habits like that keep our body and mind in fight or flight mode, which comes with a free bucket of stress and fear and anger that you do not need in your life.
“Great!” And with that, Scorpius ran off to his gran.
At some point, probably around the start of the war, something had permanently broken inside of him. Ever since, it just made no sense to him that anyone believed him to be deserving of good things. It was why he hadn’t taken Dumbledore’s offer that night on top of the astronomy tower, because he’d been scared and so
him, which he had no right to because
Two blond eyebrows shot up. “Who’d have thought, Harry Potter running a coffee shop with proper service.”
Draco nodded, and had his arms open for Harry to bury himself in before the man even leaned forward. They landed in tangles on the bed, nearly hitting Scorpius. Draco carefully shifted them onto safer territory, his parenting side shortly taking over as he transfigured their day clothes into pyjamas and pulled the covers over them. He’d gotten an expert at those spells, given that Astoria couldn’t change out of her clothes near the end. At least that skill had some use now.
to be broken. But he knew he shouldn’t. Punching Percy would only give the man a reason to call him a hypocrite. After all, what was punching if not a very non-consensual touch? “And people can treat me however they bloody like. But as soon as my son is in danger I don’t care who’s doing the hurting and how much of a favour they’ve done me by not hexing me in the face. My son is the most important person in my life and I will not allow him to get hurt. If that means taking him away from your mother then so be it.”
“Good morning, Scorpius.” Narcissa ignored his outcry and greeted her grandchild instead. “It’s snowing in our winter greenhouse. Would you like to pop on that new coat you got for Christmas and take a walk there together? We can have scones with jam and butter at the end as breakfast.”
. Which was a welcome but very confusing and big distraction. How was he supposed to explain things to the man the next morning?
“Don’t-, don’t be alone, Draco. Promise me.” Draco was quite sure his wife would have cried if her body had still been capable of producing tears. Magic fueled leukemia was vicious and cruel. There was nothing they could do for her. “Promise me you won’t let that self hatred get the best of you. There’s so much more life out there that you deserve to live.”
Poor Harry. He’d lost so much already. This would be the millionth blow he didn’t deserve, and the hardest yet to handle. If it hadn’t been obvious before, it was obvious now: Draco was simply not allowed to die. Not now, not ever. She tore herself away from the maternity ward and marched back to Draco’s room. He was going to wake up, and he was going to wake up
That had stopped after the funeral. Draco knew Scorpius didn’t fully understand what had happened to his mother, but by then he’d realised that asking for her wouldn’t bring her back. After that, they both grieved more silently, spending hours together in the sun on Astoria’s favourite garden bench, with Scorpius never leaving Draco’s lap. Those had been the saddest, yet somehow also the most blissfully happy days of Draco’s life. And Merlin knew he’d needed them, given what came after.
What helps me in those moments, is to remember that moving on, is not as simple as turning the page of a book, as starting a new chapter. A human life is not a linear story, it is more like a tapestry.
Harry walked backwards into the room, two giant IKEA bags in each hand. Half of the furniture of each Weasley came from the Swedish store ever since Hermione had brought Mr Weasley there as a birthday gift. They still weren’t sure if that had been an awful or a brilliant idea. “Ha bloody ha, Draco. It’s not all food.” Harry lifted one of the bags, the one that looked the heaviest, and put it on the bedside table with a loud thud. “This is the food. The rest is blankets and clothing and books and all that. And Ron said your mother is gathering things for Scorpius as we speak, so he’ll have everything he needs when he wakes up.”
But had he been speaking the truth?
“I love you.”
“Harry dear, you need to breathe for me alright? Stop thinking, just breathe.” Molly’s words barely registered, Harry was completely out of it. Still, she kept talking to him until he finally calmed down enough to relax in her arms and fall asleep.
Can… can you help?
I am, as of two days ago, officially no longer your therapist. I am also strictly speaking not allowed to contact you anymore, but given that our first contact did not originate from this therapy program, my supervisors have given me the green light to send you this. However, even though you did not sound like you would in your last letter, you are allowed to request a complete cease of communication to which I will abide without question.
I wasn’t personally involved in the attack, but I still feel sort of… responsible. Not because I organised it or anything, but because I couldn’t
Neville shook his head and got up from the couch. Again, he wasn’t really sure what to do with himself, but he knew what to do with Harry and Draco. “If you guys feel up to it, I’ll dig up some pyjamas and ready my bed. Seems best not to go back all the way to your own quarters now, right?”
When Harry came back to Draco’s room, the commotion had died down, and everything seemed to have gone back to the way it was. Draco’s brain activity was still there, but it wasn’t getting any stronger, and the twitching had stopped. Harry didn’t know what to think of that. He had no medical knowledge whatsoever, and he couldn’t make heads or tails out of the situation.
The stupid excuses of the school board, who oversaw his case ever since McGonagall had been called out by the Magical United Nations for something important, were driving him up the wall.
“Do it, then. Bring them all. And when they’re here, I’ll tell you how good it felt to slaughter your sister.”
“It was jumbled. Half the time he spoke aloud, and it was—violent. He was another person.”
“Nott was his friend!” Harry lashed out, furious beyond belief and hurting terribly with the implication. “He was his friend. One of the few friends he had, of course he wouldn’t just—You want us to bond because I look like his dead lover? Because I resemble Nott?”
He yanked Blaise up by the collar of his shirt and shook him. “Blaise, what did you say about a… binding? Did she bind him?”
“I believe that is a bit of an overstatement,” Dumbledore answered gently.
“Did you…” He fumbled for words, for composure. “Were you there? When your mother—”
“Hello, madam,” Ron practically shouted, and made a sweeping bow in her direction, then nearly sprawled across the floor. Hermione snickered and pulled him upright. Ron staggered sideways, throwing a hand out to catch himself.
She ran a hand over her sodden hair. Tiny curls tangled around her fingers and she yanked her hand away angrily.
He’d worked hard for it, months ago. It was the only time he’d really gotten to know Potter, listening to the strange sentences flowing from his throat, copying the timbre and stress to memory. He still had no idea what he was saying, but Potter had taught him two sentences. Only two.
Draco’s eyes were shut, cheeks a bright red flush. He lay sprawled, completely uninhibited on top of the mussed sheets, one arm thrown up above his head. Harry struggled to find a cleaning spell in his mess of a brain, but wasn’t sure in the end if he’d actually cast it. He had to be closer to Draco. There was nothing else except that.
Draco’s hands shook.
Then her eyelashes lowered and she drew a fortifying breath. “Alright. Alright, Harry.”
Somehow Blaise fought free of the quilts and traversed the room to the bag he’d dropped by the door. He didn’t remember summoning Pomfrey, or the spells Draco recited for him to repeat, or the hurried explanations when the Healer finally hastened into the room. The smell of blood tickled Blaise’s nostrils as if he’d inhaled the liquid. The ache in his side swelled over him until it was all he could feel, and yet it did not fell him. He moved mechanically, seeing bright red and pale white, muted colours that only coalesced into recognisable objects an hour later, when Seamus was breathing more easily, Draco perched on the bed trailing his sparking wand back and forth in gentle strokes over the closing wound. Pomfrey spoke in agitated spurts. Words, “Alecto,” “spell,” and “when,” and Draco answered, but Blaise only heard Seamus’ gradually steadying dreams in his ears.
Remus’ embrace was warm and solid. For the first time since he’d slept with Draco, Harry relaxed into someone else’s arms, someone else’s strength. Founders, as if any of them had any strength left. Remus patted his shoulder fondly, gripped him hard, and then released him, stepping back to clasp Harry’s shoulders with weathered hands. “Thank goodness. I’ve been afraid that I’d get here and find you dead.”
There was the final Horcrux to think about. It preyed upon his mind like a viper, slithering into his thoughts when he least expected it. It was better to think about other, more comforting things.
It was for the best. And he’d made a promise to his best friend.
Harry let out his breath. “Then he’s…”
He held her hand tightly, feeling a strange tremble in it. Her fingers clenched and plucked at the air. He pressed her hand hurriedly back to the harp’s strings, uncertain what to do. “Who? Seamus?”
Her eyes darted over his face. She glanced up behind him and then back down. “Alright,” and the passion in her words went somewhat subdued, “alright. Acuere Inimicus takes time to complete. Did Blaise tell you anything?”
The silence resumed, and she was certain their sparse conversation was over, until Malfoy spoke again.
Silence thudded through him. Surely not. But he knew that voice. Just the night before, it had uttered his name in a way he’d never, ever thought he would hear. Impossible to pretend it a dream. He suspected that he would only be granted nightmares from here on out anyway.
to be killed.”
For an instant, Harry hated him.
“Of course she does, Harry.” Remus spoke patiently from his place at the table. Su was now picking herself up and brushing off her palms, but she looked a little cowed. Remus gave her a steady look until she smiled back at him. “She has agreed to tell us should things slide even slightly out of her grip.”
And then his legs dropped. He reached up and flattened a palm against Harry’s chest. “I—What in hell is this, Potter?”
The shame… in pointing his wand at the man who had offered him the only solace he would ever know. The shame of hearing such an offer even after threatening murder. The shame of having to tell the truth to him, Harry Potter, when it would only sound like a request from an ungrateful refugee.
It was still a shock to see Harry’s body unfold. His head lifted like a bird’s into alertness and that gleam she’d not been able to make heads or tails of in school now shone fiercely out at her. “If you’d any idea what he’s given… What he’s sacrificed…”
How to articulate it? Harry moistened his lips and sought for words that didn’t want to come forward. He felt drugged. “It’s more that he’s always there. He’s the only clear thing, everything else is… misty. Sometimes it’s like I can hear him, but I don’t—don’t see him. Or feel him, not like—” Harry pushed his fingers harder into his eyes. “Don’t know how to describe it.”
Seamus looked away, shaking, unable to think, hearing the screams in his head and the nightmares, and no longer knowing if they were his or his lover’s. “I was repressing him, I repressed it, gods, this whole time I was—”
They knew Draco cried. They spoke of it in low tones.
awake, surely, for over two days. He remembered the ache in his calves and thighs, the pounding of his heart as he ran. Skirted. Dodged through copses of trees that seemed overly vivid to his taxed mind. He’d watched Death Eaters pass the places he hid, their wands drawn and trembling before them, the circles under their eyes dire reminders of what he must look like. He remembered feeling a clouded fear. They were determined. They had his stamina, and were they not just like the Order in their diligence, their commitment? They would forgo sleep to search him out, and perhaps fall to the earth in a shaking stupor rather than return to their Lord without him.
“It was a chance I was willing to take.”
Fred nodded and shivered, still looking at his twin. Harry thought about telling him just who it was that had arrived, but he didn’t know for sure—despite what his instincts screamed—and Fred was in far too bad shape to be surprised now. It could wait a little while. Harry closed the Infirmary door behind him. Only then did the coiling of his muscles catch up with him at last, and, breathing too rapidly to be explained by his recent vigil, Harry ran down the hall.
Harry groped and found cold fingers, wrapped his hand around them. His knuckles scraped the stones and Draco’s hand clenched hard around his. His name came in a gasp, filling the silence of the hallway. Draco lurched against him. Sparks flashed through Harry’s vision at the contact. He tore his glasses from his face with a shaking hand and then forgot about them. Draco wriggled free of Harry’s grasp; a second later the press of fingers underneath the hem of his shirt made Harry pull out of the kiss. He gripped Draco’s hips and lifted, settling him up higher on the wall, then thrust bodily against him. Draco let out a faint moan; his head fell back, knocking against the stones. Hands tangled in Harry’s hair and pulled.
“No, me!
It was a big might. But Blaise had worked with less just by sneaking into the damn place.
And then she swung.
“Harry—” Oliver sighed and raised his hands in defeat. “I know. Alright? I know, I know you trust him, and I believe he’s given you reason to, whatever that reason may be. But forgive me if old habits don’t die so quickly with me. Or with anyone else.”
Draco studied, then rose and looked carefully around. His right hand lighted very briefly on his left forearm. “Go quietly,” he muttered.
Harry felt the wards begin to drop, folding down layer by layer. It was all wrong, everything felt wrong this time. Harry’s stomach lurched. Something in the castle shimmied violently. He pulled with all his might and finally succeeded in freeing his hand from Luna’s grip. He closed one of Oliver’s hands over hers and squeezed his arm hard until the other man turned to face him.
Harry had no right to be touching him like this.
Malfoy walked beside her, profile sharp against the darkness. Ginny studied the stoniness of his features and considered how they might have come to life under other circumstances. Theodore Nott’s face flickered through her mind, pale and unfathomable. His image burned starkly for an instant before fading.
“No, you don’t want to sleep,” Ron said loftily. “You want something else.”
“When did you first consider coming to us for help in his release?” Harry repeated slowly.
He trailed fingers over the endless empty bottles, over the jars and along the bare wall, blanking his mind, thinking of nothing, trying to find the state of emptiness he’d cultivated for the entire war. He wasn’t sure if he could still function in that state, but it was all he had left and he was tired of hurting, of hating and sacrificing and needing.
He was unprepared for the flinch that curled through Malfoy’s frame. Malfoy lifted a hand until it hovered at face level. Harry’s heart thudded. He pushed away from the wall and came toward his guest. “Malfoy?”
“Harry’s in a good mood,” Luna said.
Harry’s eyes flicked to the ceiling. “Luna, are you sure you can—”
Luna stopped. Her head turned sideways as though listening. The index finger of her right hand halted on a single string and strummed it over and over and over.
Harry glanced back at the door. The strains of Luna’s lute trembled from the walls and windows. “A few more hours.”
*		*		*
Harry shook his head. “He’s fine. He’s still sleeping. I just didn’t want to leave you alone.”
“If it can. We don’t… There’s no way to know what will happen. If it will even work against the magic of a Horcrux.”
Hermione shook her head and groaned, sleepy. Ron rolled slowly back over, taking her with him. She settled her head on his chest and closed her eyes. “Tomorrow then,” she sighed. “I need my sleep after… after all.”
He smiled at her. It was weak, on only half of his face. “I can feel his dreams.”
It was not something Harry was proud of, or personally responsible for. But it had its uses, even now; Malfoy had no idea.
Hermione shook her head slowly and Ron’s attention narrowed again to his goblet and the arm around her midriff.
Blaise nodded in the corner of her eye. She couldn’t look at him, not without telling him. And then she was looking at him, and the words were coming.
“And she smiled as she passed me with her goods and her gear…” Like the girl in her song. A sad smile. “And that was the last that I saw of my dear.”
“Malfoy.” Harry’s voice was weak. His face flushed up from the neck, and Draco saw embarrassment, desire in his eyes at the same moment, and felt both emotions as his own. He swallowed hard.
Ginny corrected swiftly, but it was too late; the word ‘mother’ was there.
“Wards,” Harry hissed. His anger felt horribly compounded: frustration, exhaustion, exasperation. Annoyance above all, at Dean for letting Katie blow her top as if they were sixth years dueling instead of wielding the power to kill someone with a word. At Tonks for sitting there like a bloody statue the entire time. At Malfoy for thinking he could just walk up to the fucking front door, safe as you please. “Do I have to wake Hermione after her first two hours of sleep in as many days so that you can all be reminded of
Harry stirred. For a moment Ginny feared he would push her away. “There’s a room set aside for you. I can—”
“Alastor will likely want to hear what you’ve been using in Europe. Anything Voldemort’s followers have already seen, if we can tweak it, it can only help us.” Leaving Neville to his newfound cohort, Remus led Harry and Krum out into the hallway.
The air smelled faintly of sulfur.
Ginny looked away, down at Seamus where he lay on the next bed. “I shouldn’t, though. Don’t want to wake him.”
If she was still alive then. There was no guarantee of that, and that was somehow even worse, that she might end up a corpse at his side. Smart, capable, indomitable Hermione. As soon as he let the idea in, others followed: Draco. Ginny. Remus, the twins, Luna, all twisted and still, all ravaged by the ugliest magic. Maybe none of them got out of this alive.
Harry cleared his throat. “Did they…”
“All right,” he said, but gave Hermione a firm glare. “Tell us what that was. But no more demonstrations. I think she’s had enough.”
**originally posted 7/16/07**
“What are you talking about?”
Harry waved his wand once at his side, and it was a long, hushed moment before Malfoy straightened in the chair. He sat poised like a frightened bird, and then slowly got to his feet. His gaze remained wary, fixed on Harry. Harry’s fingers tensed around his wand. He resisted the urge to step back.
“Is he breathing alright?” Her wand had paused over Blaise’s side and steady white light was pulsing into him with a disorienting grinding sound.
“My life will go on.” Seamus turned wide, haunted eyes to Harry’s. “Harry… He
“What?” Pansy undoubtedly raised an eyebrow behind her huge sunglasses. Draco had already put his on his head, giving a new, improved look to his already very nice hair. They were inside now, after all, in some pub with a live band.
“Earl Grey,” Draco sniffed, as if that should be obvious. “No sugar, too much milk.”
you!” Percy spat. Draco was strangely reminded of his late father when he got offended as he watched Percy’s expression grow harsh. “Your child was misbehaving and instead of apologising, you say it was my mother’s fault? And you’re insulting her hospitality by saying she just offered a cup of tea? I can list hundreds of people who would never let the likes of you into their house but she
But he’d learnt long ago that he’d been a horrible person, that he couldn’t blame things on his parents, and that he should and
“I-, I don’t know. I suppose it’s…
“Hey, hey that’s not true, Draco. He has you, he has your mother.” Harry shushed and pulled him close. “Everything considered, Scorpius has a wonderful life, an amazing father, and great friends and you really should stop beating yourself up about this. It’s horrible how you lost Astoria but you’re doing the best you can. No one can ask you to do more than this, ey?”
“How dare you call me dumb in my own home!” Molly raised the ladle at him and Scorpius flinched again, his eyes full of fear. It might be the wrong conclusion, but something told him that Scorpius wasn’t just scared of the look of the ladle, but of the
He got up from the sofa and walked over to the floo. “I’ll go fetch Scorpius now. He’d be so disappointed if I let him miss pancakes.”
“They hate me,” Draco sniffed, changing from stubborn boyfriend into a genuinely upset lover. Or maybe Harry had misread the situation all along. “I can’t. Not today.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for. Your boundaries are your boundaries and no one is allowed to cross them if you don’t want them to,” Draco shushed, hoisting Scorpius up a little higher with one hand while grabbing some floo powder with the other. His son looked confused at that, but Draco explained before he could ask any questions. “We’re going to visit Grandma for a bit, does that sound like a good plan?”
Or actually, he couldn’t stand the thought of Draco dying at all. Teddy already didn’t have his parents anymore, he couldn’t lose Draco too. The thought ripped a huge black hole into his chest threatening to drown him in a never ending pool of loneliness.
time before six weeks ago.
“I-, I-, you wrote a book about dying, didn’t you? For kids?” It were the first words spoken between them in a very long time. They had been on friendly terms after the war, but lost touch when married life and careers began to consume their time. Draco had not seen him in seven years.
Draco shot Potter a sharp look. “Are you comparing me to Elsa?”
“But he did get you as a father, and that makes up for a lot of it.” Ginny reached out for him again, forcing him to look up. Or down actually, as the redhead was quite a lot shorter than he was. Somehow she still made it feel like looking up. “You did the right thing, with my mum. And you’re doing the right thing with raising Scorpius. Harry and I learn from you every day, and so do our kids. He picked a good one with you.”
For the first time that night, Draco smiled. And he answered Harry’s question with a soft kiss. This right here was all the attention he wanted, and something told him there would be plenty of it in the future.
Hello again,
But Potter had brought back the fight in him, with his stupid comment about his jeans. Suddenly all the old resentment at the ministry, his father, Hogwarts, it all came rushing out and Potter had taken the brunt of it. Hardly his proudest moment.
Draco moved away from Harry when he tried to reach out for him. He wanted nothing more than to be held, to be understood and loved and not judged for something that had never felt like a choice. But becoming a Death Eater had felt like the same non-choice as his later career had been, and he couldn’t expect Harry to forgive him for both. If he showed weakness now and Harry would reject him after getting to know the truth, his departure would just hurt more.
“Oh shit, what if I’m making you pee your pants! Or put rain in your nightmare! It can’t rain in your nightmare, that would just make it worse.” Draco began to stir, cutting off any more insane ramblings Harry might utter, which was probably for the best. “Draco? Draco can you hear me?”
anymore. The first time they’d had sex had been after so many dates, both of them had stopped counting by that time. It had been marvellous, but what Draco cherished most about their first time was the quiet story telling afterwards. The sharing of dreams and memories felt more intimate than any sex ever had.
“Well you better start believing it.” Draco replied as he draped his blankets over Harry as well. “Because I wasn’t planning on leaving any time soon.”
“You have exams just after Christmas? But then you can’t relax during the holidays!”
“Oh, shut your trap, Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes. “But thanks. It’s good to know I don’t bother you too much with my rants.”
dramatic, he didn’t play pretend. But she was trying to calm him, and that alone was help enough. Plus, he shouldn’t be thinking about himself at all now. He had a son to worry about. “Thank you, Mother.”
“Because it’s true,” Scorpius replied with a condescending look on his face. Draco snorted. Though he definitely wasn’t trying to make Scorpius be like him, sometimes his son really acted like a mini-Draco.
fucked up. I’m not worth all that. You’re fighting for your life here, and I’m so fucking scared that you won’t make it and meanwhile you just bloody well made peace with me possibly dying each time I go to work? It’s not right. You should never have to do that. I shouldn’t have made you do that.”
“Molly did no such thing.” Draco huffed, offended by the notion even though it was a tiny bit true. “She’s just getting Scorpius some tea.”
“No. I think they are sad. I think they clean so much here because they’re trying to wash the sadness away, but it never really works.” She sighed at the weird habits of adults. “Maybe they could hang up some pictures, see if that helps. Or they could buy a puppy, that would cheer people up.”
, when his head shot up and he saw the huge grin on Pansy’s face, combined with a scribbled on beermat. “You
“If I may be so free to offer, I’ve finished remodeling the south wing and I would like to know exactly how comfortable the beds are.” His mother smiled at him as Draco rolled his eyes. Sometimes she was blatantly obvious in her ways, which Draco suspected was a way to save mental energy as she knew no one would ever say no to her anyway. “They’re big enough for three, I think.”
“You survived. I say that’s brave.”
“Shhhh, it’s okay. I’ll come visit you for lunch if you’d like?” Harry hugged Draco closer, noticing once again that his fever was quite high. “But I think you need to take some potions first, Draco. Eat something. I can’t take you out for lunch if you die.”
It was quite funny to watch Harry’s confused face from the corner of his eye as he listened to the story from Scorpius’ healer. After basically living in the hospital for over a year, Draco knew the jargon, but to Harry everything had to sound like a strange mix of difficult words.
I did not realise how important that was until my father’s love changed from seemingly unconditional to very conditional indeed. I will not mention what he has done, but to put it mildly, I would not lift a finger to keep him out of danger now, had he still been alive.
Harry gave him a small nod, without looking away from Draco.
Draco arched his eyebrow. “Admit defeat?”
“You’re so intense when you fixate on something.” Draco smiled at the memory of the many times he’d seen that happen. “I like that.”
“Thank you.” Draco rose to his feet and shook the Healer’s hand. It was the last thing he did, before he almost took off running back to his son. He still found it ridiculous that Scorpius, just because he was a child, never got any kind of explanation about what was going on. As if he didn’t have the right to  know what was going on in his own body. It wasn’t even that hard to explain.
Teddy looked over his shoulder and nearly tripped over his own feet and the broom when he caught sight of Victoire’s glare. He might not speak french but that only made it more terrifying if he was being honest. Plus, he got the gist of it.
“I am not old!” Molly yelled back at him, looking two ticks away from being just as angry as when she’d murdered his aunt. But Draco could face that with ease if it was to protect his child. The extra adrenaline in his system didn’t help to calm him down, though. “And he said nothing until he suddenly jumped out of my arms!”
I do look forward to your letters, as odd as it may sound since we have only exchanged a few but I enjoy your words… that may sound even more odd. But it’s true. I’ve always looked forward to simple things - as a child, I looked forward to being alone in my cupboard because it meant I wasn’t getting beaten up by my cousin or shouted at by my aunt and uncle. After I started at Hogwarts, I looked forward to going back to school at the end of the holidays. Some people would think that’s pathetic, I suppose, but my school days at Hogwarts are definitely some of the brightest threads in my tapestry. Even the fights and arguments I had with my rival are bright threads because they weren’t the same as being beaten up by my cousin. We were more equal than that.
. Be you. If you don’t want to be held then people shouldn’t do that. If you are scared of the dark, then we’ll turn on a light. And if you want to be able to sleep in the dark but can’t, then I will help you learn that. But I don’t want you to sleep in the dark and be terrified just because you think it is normal to sleep with the lights out. Everyone has their own normal, and unless there’s something wrong with your normal that’s perfectly alright and it should be respected. Okay?”
I’m going to end by telling you who I am. If you haven’t already guessed, that is. You will likely know of me at the very least. Depending on your age, we may even have been at school together which will make these letters awkward - but I don’t regret writing them, and I hope we can continue, even if you never tell me your name. I don’t want to feel embarrassed about seeking help anymore. I know that this doesn’t make me weak.
I just want that to be absolutely clear because the last thing I want is for you to lose your help because you no longer feel comfortable to talk to me but do not dare to ask for anyone else.
“Just as long as it isn’t hospital food.” Draco warned. The stuff was gross, it always was. One would think that in a place where sick people were trying to get better, the food would be somewhat decent and healthy. Somehow it was always over- or undercooked, covered in gravy, soaked in salt or overdosed with sugar or all three at the same time though, and none of that had ever agreed with Draco’s stomach. “I’d rather eat a cardboard box.”
But he couldn’t let that happen. No matter how much he enjoyed it sometimes, right now he did not want to be some damsel in distress.
Wow. I thought I would have trouble with opening up to a stranger, but I think that it actually helps that I don’t know who you are. I’m sorry if that doesn’t make sense. I just wrote as I was thinking about it.
“Ewwwww.” James pretended to vomit as his dad hopped onto the bed and crawled over to give his boyfriend a kiss. “That’s disgusting.”
have sex.”
Or so he’d thought.
“Yeah, well, Draco’s an idiot.”
“No of course I don’t hate you, you absolute twat.” Draco turned around and pulled Harry into a hug before he could properly see his face. If Harry were to actually look crestfallen, Draco didn’t think he could cope with the hurt and guilt he’d feel from that. “I never hated you. I wanted to for a very long time, so
around him. Just thoughts too fleeting to leave an impression, memories just out of reach, sensory input that wasn’t there.
Then on a last note, it is perfectly understandable that you find it easier to talk to someone you do not know. It enables you to talk more freely, without fear of being judged (which I would not do even if we did know each other). So yes, that does make perfect sense. And writing as you think helps me understand you so I can help you better, so please do not shy away from that.
Draco groaned and hid behind his hands. “Why does everyone keep saying that?”
“As if you could say no if he asked.” Pansy threw her head back and laughed. “Oh God, don’t worry Draco, I still love you even if you are a thirsty arse.”
I have no intention of throwing any of your letters out. I want to implore you not to ask your superiors to assign me someone else - but I know that’s your choice, just as you reminded me I was free to ask for someone else. I… I would really like to continue writing to you. I would like it even better if we could, perhaps, meet? For a drink - not wine - or lunch?
“We’ve talked about this, Draco. It’s not your fault. There isn’t a single turn in your life that you could have taken differently that would have stopped all this. Choosing different would have cost you your parents, your friends, your
I do not think the people I fought with back at Hogwarts would forgive me, they definitely do not have any obligation to, but I always found that it helps to think that if you hurt people in the past, that does not mean you cannot help others now. And not being able to earn the forgiveness of those people you hurt, is no reason to not try and better yourself. If we are supposed to act like the worst people we have once been, then this world would be a horrible place to live. People can really surprise you when you allow them to change.
It's short and not beta read because I typed it on my mothers mini laptop which is absolute shite for writing (I cannot even select more than a paragraph at a time. copy pasting this to ao3 was hell), but this is gonna be my only moment to write for a long time to come so its this or nothing
Looking back, knowing how no one had helped him, or any of the other Slytherins to get out of their post-war isolation, it didn’t surprise Harry. The ‘good’ side wouldn’t have them, wouldn’t even educate them why they were wrong, and the bad side never let anyone go. Especially not when you still had family in their claws available for manipulation and blackmail. Harry knew from Regulus how high the price was for freedom. Even a life wasn’t always enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Probably.” And suddenly Harry was in Draco’s arms again, though the hug was a lot less desperate than last time. “I-, I-, Thank you. I wasn’t sure what to do anymore. I just saw an add with your name on it in the paper and I vaguely remembered something about this . But this is better than I could have hoped for.”
“Teddy, stop it.” Victoire halted, turned around and nearly made him collide with her. “I can see you fretting and beating yourself up about this and you shouldn’t. Whatever is going to happen to Draco… It will happen anyway. I wish there was something we could do, but there isn’t, so there’s no use in beating yourself up about taking a few minutes longer to go by bus. Besides, with your flying skills the bus will probably be quicker than going on a broom anyway. Not to mention warmer.”
crying, thank you very much.
Draco gulped. “Eh, Puddlemere’s good. They stand a chance at the very least.”
“Ma’am? We’re about to-, oh.” It wasn’t a ma’am. It wasn’t even a stranger. “Malfoy? What are you doing here?”
“I would just like to have what you have sometimes. That dive-in head first carelessness, not worrying all the time, having a supportive ex-wife, and a giant circle of family and friends to fall back on. Though I might just have ruined the latter a bit for you.”
Neville smiled at the scene, before making himself scarce. They didn’t need him there. He was glad for his large bed this time. It sometimes made him feel a bit lonely, all that space for just one person, but he needed it when his friends came over.
“Oh.” Scorpius brushed it off. “So you’re not angry with me?”
There is no need to fear that you made me feel bad. Of course the memory you brought back with your story of what happened to you was one that packed a punch, but I would not do the work I do if I did not know how to cope with that. There is nothing that you should not tell me about yourself because you fear it might hurt me.
Harry gave her an odd look, but followed her gesture and took a seat in the booth.
His eyesight got blurry, and aunt Hermione wrapped a strong arm around him when the first sob came past his lips. He tried to blink the tears away but it was no use. After a while he gave up and buried his face in Hermione’s side, letting his sobs run free. That was why he missed the thing that caught Victoire’s attention.
And his jaw fell on the floor.
Draco was incredibly touched that Harry remembered what did and didn’t help when he was crying. The last time they’d talked about that was two years ago.
Draco’s eyes went wide. Harry would be
“Sure we are, love.” Harry smiled down at Draco before kissing his forehead, and Neville had to look away. The moment felt too intimate to witness. “We’re just as mean as you are, you big softie.”
“And I love that about you.” Now it was Draco pulling Harry close, impossibly close as if Draco was trying to merge them together. However stupid it sounded he wanted to squeeze all of Harry’s insecurity out of him. He knew it was hard on the ex-auror that he’d gained a stone or two, especially because of the horrible media coverage. Draco sighed deeply and inhaled Harry’s scent like a drug addict in need of a fix. “Perfect teddy bear.”
He did want to see them, but they always wanted to
“D’ya reckon Draco got a downgrade then?”
Teddy hated this. His entire family was in St. Mungo’s, watching over his cousin Draco and he was the only one not there because he was stuck at school.
“Those two things don’t exclude each other, babe.” Harry chuckled again and kissed his neck. Draco pried his arms loose and turned around, sending his lover a mild glare.
“You’re a blessing, son, and don’t you forget it.” Andromeda sighed as she went to sit in the living room. Draco left the mayhem of the kitchen and joined her as soon as the tea was done. “Speaking of sons, Draco, where is Scorpius?”
But his mother just smiled at him, and turned to Scorpius when the little guy ran into the room, his coat firmly around his shoulders. “Hey, my prince. You ready to go home with your Daddy?”
He brushed passed the baffled Weasley without granting him a single glance and apparated away in the middle of the store despite the fact that he’d get a fine for that. It took everything he had not to plant his fist or a nasty hex in Percy’s face and doing that would get him far worse than a fine.
“Yes sir!” Harry saluted him and hopped off the bed. Then his kids spent the next ten minutes saying their faked teary goodbyes to their father, before Harry waved at him one last time and went out the door. Draco smiled. Despite everything, he was quite a happy man now.
“I’m going to the lav,” he murmured to no one in particular before pulling his hand free from Harry’s and climbing out of the booth. He needed cold water in his face and a moment of peace and quiet.
Draco sighed, guilt laying heavy on his chest. “I’m sorry for storming out. And for yelling at Mrs Weasley.”
“Mother!” Draco’s eyes went wide. “You wouldn’t.”
him to get influenced by other people but I’m scared to death he’ll grow up to be like me.”
No one else would pay his university bills and the Malfoy vaults had been confiscated by the Ministry. Plus, no one would distract him from his boring job now that he’d lost touch with most of his friends. It turned out friendships did dwindle when one half of the party was only allowed to contact others via owl post, and the party as a whole was deeply traumatised after a war.
Despite having slept in that morning, Draco was dead on his feet by the time he reached the bed. His days were often like that. Worrying about everything and having mental breakdowns had gotten him diagnosed with chronic exhaustion last year, a side effect of his anxiety and depression. But at least with Harry already in bed, he knew he would have a nightmare-free night.
Draco lifted his head and arched an eyebrow. “You’ve been talking to Hermione again, haven’t you?”
, his father had said.
? Worse still, are you calling yourself a disaster father?”
The only one who can get close to knowing you that well is a very good friend or a lifelong spouse. Definitely not the majority of people though, and definitely not me (unless your name is Pansy Parkinson, which I doubt though I do not know it for sure).
!” All background noise washed away when the distressed call of his son reached Draco’s ears. Without uttering a single word to Harry, Draco turned around and made his way to the Burrow’s kitchen as fast as he could. There was crying coming from it too when he finally reached it.
I think I’m the opposite. When my emotions are running high, I like nothing more than to be out walking among the trees. I can’t feel angry when all I can hear is nature - running water and bird song are some of my favourite sounds. It’s hard to find places like that in London, so I usually have to get out of the city. That is sometimes risky if I apparate and I know I should probably be more careful but I’m always very focused on where I need to be at moments like that. I can’t imagine never leaving the house.
“Of course. Thank you for the invitation, Harry. I might take you up on that.” He definitely would, he decided as he saw a spark of excitement in Harry’s eyes. Plus, Scorpius had always wanted to have a large family, but all Draco could ever him was a grandmother who lived in France and a family of his late mother who pretended he didn’t exist. Their terrible way of dealing with grief had been one of his inspirations to start writing. “And Happy New Year.”
. Draco was sure he looked like a hot, desperate mess, and not in a good way.
Draco knew Harry was rambling because seeing him like this made him panic, but his words still seemed genuine.
With a sigh he let himself fall into one of the many guest beds close to the small drawing room where he’d had his chat with Scorpius. He lacked the energy to walk much further. It was so difficult, being a parent. Especially being a single parent. There were so many choices to be made each day and his track record for making the right one wasn’t exactly promising. Not a day went by when he didn’t miss Astoria. And of course he had his own mother, and he had Harry, though…
“You ask me. Or you ask your grandmother, and then we’ll talk about it. But please don’t put on a mask and pretend you’re alright when you’re not. You’re allowed to say no. You’re allowed to not be alright. Do you understand that?”
Draco was baffled. That was not the response he thought he’d get. Quite the opposite, in fact. He remained baffled and silent as Harry excused them to his friends, walked them outside and apparated them to his flat. It wasn’t until after Draco’s third cup of milky tea and the wrapping of several blankets around him, that he began to talk. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.”
Draco had been the one to organise his best birthday parties and take him on the most absurd holidays. Getting spoiled and manicured in Paris, climbing in the Andes mountains, visiting the north pole to see the northern light, or
“Of course Scorpius will stay part of our family. I told you, he’s a fighter. He’s going to be alright.”
After eight years on the force he was still in the same position, to his father’s dismay, working all holidays and other crappy shifts while being left out of the office’s pub nights and their Secret Santa. The only person who talked to him about anything not strictly work related was Potter, though he wasn’t sure why. Probably a Weasley thing, looking after all the strays and lost folks.
“Luna, actually.” Harry blushed and now he was the one trying to hide his face. “I just-, I love you, but sometimes you’re a little hard to understand. In an emotional sense, I mean. Like, you’ve been through so much and I often think I’m a bit too Gryffindor to see what you’re really about.” Harry sighed, and rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling. “You really didn’t believe for a second I had thought of that on my own, did you?”
Draco nodded ever so slightly and reached into his pyjama pocket to retrieve something that looked like it was muggle. Neville figured out it was a recording device when Draco pushed a button and the sound began to play.
quiet, though Draco didn’t notice, he was too lost in his own thoughts. He’d never said anything like this out loud before. Or at least not to anyone except his therapist. He thought his mother knew, but only because she read him so well.
But Scorpius had already lost his mother, plus he had his hospital trauma and he was only five years old. It wouldn’t be fair to teach him such heavy things already. On the other hand, in a little under a month he’d turn six, and Draco couldn’t let it wait until he was going off to Hogwarts…
“Don’t you think that these aren’t sad tears then?” Draco was pulled out of his thoughts when Ellis spoke again. “Maybe you’re relieved, because remembering your past life reminds you that you don’t live like that anymore. You moved on to better things.”
But just as he hit rock bottom, he’d walked past this pub.
Neville shot Draco a look, before getting up from the couch and quickly throwing a nearby blanket over his friend. Not because he was trying to hide Draco, but because leaving him to sit on his own like that, even if it was just for a moment, just felt wrong. At least this way he’d stay warm. Plus, well, he didn’t want the man behind the door to think that’s he’d been anything short of welcoming and understanding to Draco.
“Well then, whose responsibility is it? Not the Ministry, because they clearly don’t care. Not Hogwarts, because they let him starve in sixth year without lifting a bloody finger, and Dumbledore
“Draco,” Harry sighed, putting a hand on Draco’s forehead. “You’re burning up. You’re not allowed to work this shift, and that’s an order. I’ll take you home once I’ve told Robbarts you’re sick. Now go take a seat in my chair, and you better have finished off my tea by the time I get back or I’ll be forced to take drastic measures, understood?”
as him, left alone disrespect him like that.
Her son. The man fighting for his life who was still just a boy inside her head. A boy who had lived through way too much. The harsh upbringing of his father, which she should have stopped while she could. The war and the fear and trauma that came with it. Narcissa knew those things had hurt and broken him until there was barely any Draco left.
Draco shuddered alongside Harry at that idea. Though Draco couldn’t help but note that he’d much rather have Hermione living in his house compared to Lord Voldemort. He didn’t say that though. There were quite a lot of details about his sixth and seventh year which Harry didn’t know about, and he would like to keep it that way.
A terribly fake gasp came from Harry’s side of the bed, before the man burst out in giggles.
to show you how to build a proper snowman. You can’t be an expert on hot beverages and cold men at the same time, I refuse to believe it.”
From the corner of his eye, he saw Harry watch the exchange with fascination. The man had never understood Draco’s relationship with his mother, but he liked to look at it anyway.
Draco sniffed but forced a smile onto his lips. He didn’t fully agree with his mother. His life
George gripped Harry even tighter in return. “Yes you can Harry.” He swallowed heavily, blinked, and then blinked again. “I know you can.”
He didn’t trust himself to talk, so Draco just pulled Harry closer for a second before letting go. Harry placed a chaste kiss on his cheeks before Draco left. Once back in bed, blessedly without his healer robes on, he cried some more because not only did
are the only person who knows yourself best.
look on his face he’d ever seen. Without a word, Neville stepped back to give the lovers some space.
He hopped off the bed and went downstairs to make some soup. He wouldn’t bother Mrs Weasley on Christmas Eve and soup always helped, he thought. Taking care of sick people wasn’t his forte, but he could hardly do worse than Draco himself. He had no idea if the man was allergic to anything, so he tried to make a basic broth with toast. That’s what sick people ate, right?
“I’ve made some tea, lads.” Neville had entered the living room and put the tray down on the coffee table. He wasn’t really sure what to do with himself now.
I’m glad to hear your cat is having the time of her life ruining your best coat. She sounds adorable and I’m sure she’d rather you petted her than wasted time writing to me (but I’m very glad you
I do not know how much this analogy will speak to you, but it helped change my view on life, and it helped me realise that by moving on, my friends were not turning a page, leaving me to gather dust on a shelf. They are your friends for a reason, they want you in their lives, and odds are, they’ve run out of dark threads quite some time ago and are dying to add some colour, not just to their own story, but to yours.
What I am trying to say with all this, is that while growing up, help has not been offered to you, but that was not because you did not need it, or because you did not deserve it. Quite the opposite, in fact.
“Draco, I get it. Stop stressing.” Harry took a hold of his hands and looked at him. “You need tea, and then you need a Healer update, and then you’re off to bed in the same room where they’ll put Scorpius after he’s out of surgery, okay? And stress isn’t part of any of those steps.”
A Friend
It was one of his most treasured memories.
“Don’t mention it, son,” his mother replied, a tiny cheeky smile on her lips. “Now let’s go and eat some cake. You look-,”
“Oh don’t act so silly, young man,” she said, making a move to pick Scorpius up again. Scorpius was having none of it though, and flinched away. From that moment forward everything went very fast.
, but he was cute. He had a buzzcut on the left side of his face, and the rest of his long, messy black hair was swept to the right. It looked too soft to be legal, especially when he smiled again and Draco saw he had
I suppose it is now time to finally send my apology letter, about a million years late. I am sorry I was such a colossal arse to you in the past. I am sorry I hurt your friends, I am sorry for all the bad shit I did in the war and before it. I am so so sorry for making your life even harder than it already was.
Your word of warning regarding wine tasting is duly noted. Thankfully, I’m not keen on wine as it is, so I don’t think I’ll be tempted by that one. I did, in a moment of madness, buy a guitar. Perhaps I’ll teach myself to play as I imagine that will keep my mind off anything too horrible or upsetting. I’ve always wanted to learn. I tried to have a go of my cousin’s electric guitar once. He whined and whined for it one year and got what he wanted. I think he “played” it once and then he never looked at it again. But I still wasn’t allowed a go. He punched me for even looking at it.
“He would probably like it even more if you came to him on a giant pink elephant or a candy cotton dragon, but that’s not realistic now, is it?” Victoire rolled her eyes and held out a hand. The sarcasm dripped from her words. It reminded Teddy of the fact that though she had only just turned twelve, she was nothing short of terrified of Draco dying, just like him. She was just better at hiding it. “Come on, Teddy, we haven’t got all day.”
about those kinds of things.”
However much that train of thought shocked Draco, it was of no news to Harry. Or at least he seemed completely unphased by it. “I guessed as much. I’m quite the same actually.”
I don’t scream into a pillow very often anymore. Not since I got my own house. Now I can just scream without fear of being clipped round the head for making a racket. Living alone has its benefits I suppose.
“You’re his family, Ted.” Victoire hissed as she pushed him up the stairs. “You’re allowed to visit him. Not stop twitching and hurry up!”
Did you appreciate the rubber duck? I imagine not if it confused you. While I was at Hogwarts, I would usually talk to my friends or occasionally Professor Lupin (in third year). Talking to my owl usually happened at home during the holidays. Being locked in my bedroom (I graduated to a bedroom after my first year - my family were afraid I’d use magic against them) meant I only had my owl for company. She was locked in her cage too, so we had that in common at least. I miss her a lot, but I don’t think I’m ready to get a new owl yet.
He didn’t know how he felt about not coming back to his job, but he knew he didn’t want to think about it now. There were more pressing matters at hand, like getting Draco Malfoy up the stairs. It proved to be quite the challenge, as Draco was taller than him and completely uncooperative. Harry was half tempted to join the blond in bed by the time they actually reached it.
I know I waited until the last moment of my letter, but signing with my name lifted another weight off my shoulders. Knowing that I can speak freely helps a lot - as I think you’ve probably seen in the paragraphs above. I hope I’m not rambling too much. I don’t think you’ll break the rules even though you know my name now. You’re good at your job, and I think that must mean you don’t break the rules so I trust you.
“Nothing,” Draco lied. Harry immediately gave him a pointed look. Even to him this was clearly a lie. “I’m just-, someone reminded me Scorpius will grow up without a mum. I have you, I still have someone to hold on to but he doesn’t.”
“I simply came to collect my grandchild,” his mother replied as she reached out to brush a lock of hair from Scorpius’ face. She then smiled, a light blush appearing on her cheeks. “I presumed you and Harry might want some alone time in bed.”
A muggle thing called ‘mindfulness’ can also really help, and so can yoga. The best solution I have found so far for me, personally, is to share a bed with someone. I do not mean sex, I mean just sleeping together with someone you care about. I have done some foolish things in my dark days, and after one of those, my friends decided I was not allowed to sleep alone anymore.
“Does this have to do with this place? Did something happen here?” Harry was a lot more perceptive than people gave him credit for sometimes. And he clearly had a lot of self restraint, given that he looked like his only desire in life was hugging Draco, yet he still stayed where he was. “We can leave if that’s the case, or if it isn’t. Whatever you want. I can call someone if you like? I promise I won’t be mad. And you don’t have to tell me what’s going on, but if you do I promise I won’t judge. Please, just say something.”
The list was endless, and it was at the very least partially her fault. That realisation dawned on her even more as she arrived in the right wing and spotted the first Weasley curled up and asleep on an old waiting room couch. It was Fred, or George, she could never tell the two apart even now that one of them was missing an ear. It went to show her negligence that Draco had been surrounded by Weasleys but not by her.
“Neville, I’m sorry, I-,” Draco’s breath hitched, cutting off his words. Neville knew right away something was terribly wrong. First of all, Draco
“Well, Mary I'll let you continue with your duties.” I push the sheets off my and make my way towards my closest. I hear the soft sounds of Mary walking her way to my bathroom and start to draw me a bath. The sound of water running and soft birds chirping fills my ears.
Draco
“Open your self for me doll” The Harry in my head eggs me on making me wish the real Harry was the on fingering me open.
"Now Harry place nice. He looks like he will catch fire any moment my boy!" Harry's eyes find mine in a matter of seconds. Time almost feels frozen. I can't move, I can't breathe, my heart is pounding in my chest like a stampede. After a second Harry's lips form a genuine smile, I can't help but smile back at the beauty of the prince's face. I look down at the floor start to walk back to the kitchen with Pansy hot on my heels. I give one last look and see Harry's eyes still glued to my retreating form. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the queen wink at me. Dear god, I think I just experienced love at first sight,

Dinner is well over and I still can’t get him out of my head. I haven't seen him for hours but the image in my head is still sharp. I don’t even know the doll's name! His skin was so pale he looked as if he walked off a self from a porcelain shop. His hair was so blond it was almost white. The only color on his face was that delicious blush I wanted to lick off and his cold silvery blue eyes. They looked like a sea in the middle of a storm. So much emotion swirling around, once in while lightning would strike. Just thinking about him gets me hard.
"Appetizers are needed!" The mans voice echoes off the walls of the kitchen straight into my ears. As the man turns on his heels and walks back out the door Pansy takes her apron off and smoothes down her simple gray dress.
As always leave a kuto and a comment! I love hearing your thoughts on the story!
“I  mustn’t... I have to prepare lunch in an hour” his perfect smile falls and so does my heart.
“Prince Harry, your father has requested that you meet him in his study.” The maid shuts the door too quickly before I can even reply to her. I make myself out of bed and slowly make my way to my father's study. My cock softened the moment the maid walked in, thank Merlin, I don’t want to walk around with my prick standing tall.
“Mr. Potter, may I come in?” A soft knock was laid on my door with a small voice to follow. I let out a long yawn and stretch my arms above my head; I hear a satisfying pop in my shoulder as everything finally goes back into place.
YAYAYA I'M BACK!!!!! College has been killing me with trying to get my bachelor's and all! I will be updating this story and my Diamonds are a girl's best friend more often now that I finally have my life together!
I don’t remember the last time I was in the kitchen or even near it for that matter. The smell of bread fills my senses making my mouth water. I push on the door only for it to not budge. I push again for it to finally open. I walk through and see a blushing doll staring at me on the other side
Harry sets down his heavy work boots by the door and hangs up his red Auror robes on the hook. Feeling tired and warn he trudges up the stairs taking them one step at a time. When he finally reaches his room, he feels a sense of relief. He’s finally home. The dark wizard they have been stalking for what seems like ages have finally been caught and are in for good. He hasn't been home in about a month and is feeling homesick. Harry begins to strip off his white bottom down and pants. He walks into his large bathroom and starts to fill the tub with steaming hot water. Once the tub his full he crawls in and begins to relax. Harry feels his once tense muscles slowly relax. Harry gets so relaxed he accidentally falls asleep in the tub.
“Why does everyone call me doll!” The little blondie stomped his foot like a brat. I hope he's a brat in bed, which would make it so much more fun.
“Harry, darling I don’t mean to be so critical but you missed the door into our bedroom” Draco’s breath tangles with Harry's. He can’t help but stare into the red swollen lips as they speak.
“Well the least I can do is show you the garden, it’s stunning this time of year.” Pansy begins to pull me along again. We go through so many hallways to the point where I lost track of how to get back to the kitchen. She drops my arm so she can open a glass door leading to the gardens. Cool wind rushes in and hits me all over. It's refreshing, to say the least. I walk outside and feel my jaw drop.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck me now Harry” Harry does what he’s told and slowly pushes his cock into Draco’s loosened hole.
“Breakfast will be served in an hour, would you like me to draw a bath for you?” She bows her head refusing to make eye contact with me. I hate this scared treatment I get. I'm just as human as the rest of them. Look me in the eye please I won’t bite your head off I promise!
“Prince Harry? What a lovely surprise”
They finally reach the second floor; Harry misses the door into there room all together and slams Draco’s back into the wall. They break apart to catch their breath. Harry leans his forehead down till it touches Draco’s
“Do you see those groups of starts?” I point to them with a grin. “That’s the Draco constellation” Pansy punches my arm and laughs lightly.
“Harry!” Hermione yelled coming out of the castle’s library. Ron was hot on her heels carrying an arm full of books that look ready to fall over any second. Ron is my personal knight and my best friend; his family has been loyal to the family for decades. We have been close since we were babies. Hermione comes from a more poor family but has a brain bigger than me and Ron combined. My parents have always welcomed her with open arms even when I first made friends with her. She keeps us out of trouble… most of the time. She's the brains in the operation and were her loyal servants.
“Harry! You look… wow. You look amazing” Draco rushes over to me, once close enough I open in my arms and take him into my embrace. His head fits comfortably under my chin. I lay a soft kiss on the top of his head before taking his face in my hands.
“Yes, I’m just a little overwhelmed by the beauty… my family back in France had a beautiful garden, of course, smaller than this one but similar.” My breath gets caught in my throat. I don’t want to remember them. My parents have done enough damage to me, they won’t have the pleasure to do it anymore.

“No need to apologize, your highness, I should have been paying more attention” Draco finally gets to his feet and brushes off his pants
“Harry I know you don’t want this but It’s what’s best” my mother pauses to reach across the table and grab my hand. “We love you with all of our hearts, but you need to find someone to rule with you. Preferably someone who has a brain. We will love anyone you choose sweetheart, we just want someone who will make you happy, that's why we want to throw you this party! It will help you decide to even just help look at potential lovers. We want what's best for you and the kingdom.” My mom's grip on my hand tights before she lets go and continues to eat her breakfast.
“You are excused from your duties today and if anyone says a word about it, they will have a little talk with me. So with that said, will you come with me?” I hold out my arm again but this time Draco takes it and to my surprise, he stands on his tiptoes and kisses my cheek.
Draco
I'm so happy to be posting the next chapter!!! please enjoy! leave a comment and a kudos!!!!!! follow my tumbler @grim-fairytales
“The prince is just being an arse… a cute arse” My cheeks heat up thinking back as to how close the prince's face was to mine. I could see Harry's emerald eyes up close; they were more beautiful than the painting in the hallway. No painting could ever come close to the emotions that lay inside the green sea.
Ron and I laugh running away from Hermioni who is swinging a rather large book at our heads.
“Tell me about your family. You spoke very little of them.” We start to walk on the path away from the castle.
I fill my plate with a few slices of bread and some cheese. I turn around and open the door only to hit something that must have been coming in. I back away from the door and let the stranger enter the kitchen. Nonother than the man I just wanked my self to walks through the door.
“Anything for you” I lightly brush my lips against his. They're incredibly soft and warm. Draco's face lights up bright red. I grab his hand and lead him to a loveseat hidden in the aisles of books. I sit down and pat the seat next to me. Draco follows suit, I shift closer to him to where our thighs touch. He softly opens his book and begins to read. After a moment of watching him, I reach out and start to play with a strand of his hair.
As always thanks for reading and feel free to leave a Kudos and a comment! Love ya'll!
“I think something can be arranged” Harry grabs Draco by his plush arse and hauls him up. Draco instinctually wraps his lean legs around his husband’s waste. Harry bends down and captures lips in a slow and loving kiss. A welcome home kiss if you will. They both separate for a moment then bring their mouths back together in a vicious kiss. Teeth bang together, tangles tong’s and animalistic noises escape both their throats. Draco’s hand tangle themselves in Harry's already rat nest of a hair. Harry slowly walks making his way upstairs.
"Iv never saw hair as white as yours, its fascinating." The prince's voice washes over me and heats my skin like a warm fire. It's deep, rough and everything I crave in a voice. I watch his hand come closer to my face. A finger grazes my cheek liting a fire under my skin. "Your blushing doll, " He says as he shows off his teeth in a widespread grin. I hurry back to where the plates are and continue on. The blush seems to have stuck to my face because I hear the king give a hardy laugh and smack his son on the back.
“I don’t want to rush anything Ron. He’s not a sex doll, he’s amazing… funny… a beautiful mind and I don’t want to blow this!” I continue on my way to breakfast with Ron not far behind.
Harry
IM BACK LOVES!!! so sorry for being gone for so long! Finals were killing me in every way! hope everyone is staying safe! love yall!
“So pretty” Harry gives little licks around the wrinkled hole. With no warning, he dives in working his way into Draco’s arse.
“You have it bad mate” Ron smacks me across the back then laughs at my pain “Are you planning on doing anything with this new obsession?” He wiggles his eyebrows at me. I can’t help but want to punch him.
“You really like this one don’t you” Just as I was about to open the door to the dining room Ron puts his hand on my shoulder and turns me around.
“Fine since we can’t talk about you know who, how about we take a relaxing stroll through the gardens?” Pansy’s grabs my hand and starts to lead me away from the servant quarters.
The sun shines through my open currents and straight into my eyes. I roll away from the sun and pull the blanket over my head. I have no motivation to get out of bed and talk to my parents about a party that’s meant to find me the “one”. A loud knock comes to my door. Whoever is one the other end does not even bother to wait for my response before opening the door.
Today is my date Draco, my doll of you will. I need to pick an outfit that will wow him. I find a nice white button-down shirt and a pair of freshly pressed black slacks. I bring them out and lay them on the bed carefully to make sure there will be no wrinkles for when I wear them tonight.
“Yes, that would be wonderful! Thank you! What was your name again?” I put my chin in my hand as I watch my maid's eye grow in size and as her mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.
“What did you do to that poor boy to where his face looks like a tomato” My dad turns to me with a smirk in his face then rolls his eyes.
“It’s on the chair in the corner love, and sleep I’m tired” Harry nuzzles his nose into Draco’s sweaty hair. Draco can’t help but smile into Harry's chest. He missed the feel of his husband’s strong chest under his hands and his natural woodsy smell.
“Sweet dreams doll” I whisper in his ear and let my lips graze his cheek in a final goodbye. I finally walk out the door with the world's largest grin on my face. Oh, doll you will be mine.
“I’m so sorry, I was not watching where I was going” I looked down to see my Draco on the floor. I rush down and help him back up.
I slowly start to sit up with Draco's help and shed off the reminiscences of my nap. We walk in silence in the direction of the dining room. Before we go through the doors Draco turns to look at me.
"First day on the job? You'll do fine just don't start crying like the other guy" A large hand was pushed on my back as I was forced into a busy kitchen. The room was covered in white tile with dark wood flooring. Pots, pans, and other helpful kitchen utensils where hanging on the wall just waiting for someone to use. I tie my hair up and walk fast into an empty space in the kitchen. An apron is thrown at me, I catch it before it reaches my face. I tie it on as fast as I can then start to look for things to do. I start to walk towards the counter where a whole raw chicken lays. Before I can reach it a hand grabs the back of my apron.
“To the lake just beyond the castle the one with the island in the middle and the willow tree. I thought we could enjoy some stargazing.”
“Date!” Both my parents yell at the same time. It echoes off the walls and vibrates my skull.
My parents' mindless dribble slowly fade into the background of my mind as I start to think back to what I said to Ron ‘I might even love him’. I don't know what romantic love feels like. I love my parents, my friends but someone beyond that circle is completely forgotten. I've never met anyone who makes me feel this way, I almost never did want to feel this way. I was always so set on ruling alone with my trusty knight and Hermionie (who will most likely keep everything from falling apart). it's terrifying in a way but I can’t help it. It's like running in the dark… scary but almost thrilling. I want to see where this goes. Let this flower blossom! Wow, I really am a hopeless romantic… Every time I see Draco my throat closes, my heartbeat picks up and the nails on my body stand at attention. Time always seems to slow down when he walks in a room, It must be my brain trying to keep him in my sight for as long as possible.
“Yes I have a date, and yes it's with Draco” I cross my hands over my chest, sink back into my chair. and look at my parents in their eyes. They can’t stop me from seeing my doll, no one can.
“I love you to angel”
“Deal” we continue on with breakfast, my parents creating a list of people to invite and when it should be held. I tuned them out and continued to eat. Once I finish I leave my parents to continue discussing the party, in hopes to find Ron and Hermine. I take my time walking along the long always towards the library. Or as me and Ron like to call it “Hermines home” She practically lives there, I’m surprised she hasn't read every damn book we have. I must have not been paying attention to where I was going cause the next thing I know I bump and knock then over.
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered.
“Tonks.”
But his entire frame withered somehow. Harry was suddenly aware of the air in the room: heavy and teetering.
There had to be at least ten of them in there, smooth and smallish stones. Ginny was careful not to touch them. She had heard about Ministry Portkeys, or Minis-ports. They were the only thing small enough not to leave a traceable flash of magic, and all Aurors had carried them, back when the title of Auror had mattered. Now only a few people still had any. Malfoy undoubtedly had several on his person right now.
He wasn’t looking at her anymore. He’d tensed again.
But she caught up with him outside in the hallway just as the others’ footsteps were dying away and planted herself right in front of him.
“Need you,” Draco gasped, completely out of breath. He grabbed for Harry’s hands, pressed them against his own body, and groaned at the cooling sensation of his touch.
let it out. But tonight he was happy. He sat in the light, clean-shaven, dressed in warm reds and browns, a goblet in his hand and friends surrounding him. It made her smile herself, perhaps a little too widely, but if she couldn’t be glad for her friend at Christmas, when could she be?
Harry was beginning to notice a pattern to the type of question Draco Malfoy tried to avoid. The Headmistress, with her years watching her students, and the most senior Auror had likely seen it as well.
is he fucking doing here?” Her fingers twitched, as if calling up inherent magic. Harry felt battered by waves on either side.
An odd familiarity stirred in her gut. Ginny leaned against the stone to ground herself. But the feeling wouldn’t settle; it wound up through her until it spiked into annoyance. She jerked forward. “You know, you don’t have to be an arse all the time, Malfoy! Sometimes talking is just fine.”
“He made our bond possible,” she choked out. Harry looked up sharply, hesitated, and nodded.
Harry was just closing the door to Luna’s chamber when Mad-Eye Moody came stumping down the hallway. The clack of his knobbly cane struck a staccato cadence with his peg-leg. Moody saw him and grunted.
“We’ll have to get more somewhere,” Hermione said, gesturing him over to the table and a crackling sheaf of scrolls. “Right now we’ve got enough to be getting on with, but if we have to outfit an entire army…”
about what he wants, Weasley?”
“You fucker,” Draco said aloud. His hand climbed over his face. The utter futility struck Harry like weighted cudgels. “Why didn't you tell me?”
a feeble voice piped in his head. But the words died in his throat. He couldn’t say that to Harry. Not after they’d—
Two of the older children looked ready to crack, but they all nodded. Hermione went to the door and propped it open with her foot. She watched as Ron dropped to the floor at the ruined corner beyond. His knuckles whitened around his wand.
She nodded. Took a deep breath and nodded again. They were blocked off, but Seamus could use the passage, he was still below the wreckage.
With a shake of his head, Harry rose, and Oliver downed the last of his pumpkin juice and followed. “One thing’s for sure. The house-elves know how to cook a good meal, whatever else is happening.”
“Harry.”
touch Draco. He could hear his own breath hitching, feel himself gripping too tightly, and suddenly Draco squeezed his arms, and Harry burst out, “You don’t need to do th—”
She didn’t expect him to answer. But he surprised her with a ready reply.
Hermione nodded. “Okay. Okay.”
to die.” Helpless anger threaded between Blaise’s sobs. “Why does—does it have to be me? Why does it fucking have to be me?”
Harry’s mouth went dryer than cracked earth. “Leaving?”
“I think it’s mine,” said a voice to her right. Hermione found Luna Lovegood smiling sweetly at her. “You can have it if you want.”
It was his fault, after all.
“Never,” was all he heard. The rest sounded inside him where words didn’t matter.
But when he finally slid inside, there was nothing powerful enough to keep him in check. The heat was unbearable, Draco’s body writhing desperately under him, Merlin, constantly moving, Harry thrust hard, pushing Draco further up the bed, nothing but the creak of the old wood and the gasps like a torrent from Draco’s lips. Draco raked fingernails down his back. The splash of pain spiked through him and Harry cried out. His body went swiftly out of his control. Couldn’t think, just see: skin glowing gold in the light, flaxen hair splayed across the sheets, one white-knuckled hand gripping the headboard as if to break it off. Draco’s head fell back—his eyes had rolled up—he jerked so violently that Harry thought he’d hurt him, and then Draco was coming, a helpless chaos of movement, tightening around Harry,
“I didn’t want that to hurt,” Harry said.
“Draco—”
At that first clench of Draco’s hand, Harry felt strong enough to follow. If Draco was forced to watch his friend’s pyre burn to ash, then Harry had no right at all to let him do it on his own.
There was a vicious hiss as a spell hummed past him.
Malfoy shifted once. “No. If they’re around, they’re not using magic.”
now?”
Hermione peered at her, but Luna just gave another sweet smile, said she needed the practice, and melted away into the crush of revelers. A moment later, the liquid tones of the harp started up.
“Don’t.” Malfoy pulled out of reach, right hand hovering over his forearm. Harry let his hand drop.
“At least two feet.”
Remus smiled. “They might have. Poppy and Minerva are attempting the hopefuls now.”
Goyle’s head turned back. Blaise could see his profile, orange in the firelight. He rose slowly to his feet, wand dropping from his hand. It clattered to the stones and Goyle whipped around, snarling. But Blaise was already on him, fist slamming into his chin. Goyle staggered, raised his wand, but Blaise wrapped an arm around his thick neck and squeezed. Goyle gasped for air. His huge fist belted Blaise in the gut, in the side, in the lower back. Blaise nearly fell as agony bloomed inside from the third punch, but there was no time to reconsider. He jerked Goyle’s head up by the hair and rammed it into the wall, hard. Twice.
“Remus needs to know,” he managed finally. He sniffed and got a lungful of her scent, the same scent she’d had since the first year he’d known her. It reminded him, a gut-punch, of Ron. “Minerva. And Pomfrey.”
