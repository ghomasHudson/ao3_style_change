It was nice … but no, not going to happen. Just imagine … him with a photo of Harry Potter—what, on his mantle? He didn't even have a photo of Pansy on his mantle.
? That was not the answer Harry expected from the person with the secret desire about him. “Er, why not?”
Harry, wide-eyed, looked around them, removing his own hand from Malfoy tentatively. The symbols had disappeared from the floor. The ghost was nowhere in sight. And the wind was gone—in fact, it was
Harry was quiet for a moment. It’d been a lot to take in. ‘Thank you,’ he said finally. ‘I’m glad you told me everything.’
Harry nodded, accepting his task. And wound through the hallways, ending up in a cute little kitchen, full of plants and giant windows. It had a door leading out the back of the house.
Then there were pages of unflattering doodles of Harry, falling off broomsticks, or looking sad on the Hogwarts Express with the word “expelled” in large letters.
“It’s just … you’ve always been very—” Hermione looked like she was searching for the right word. “—very hyperaware of each other in school. At times on the obsessive side. And now, all of a sudden, you’re—what—writing each other multiple notes in a day? Spending the whole evening together, when I assume there was a house full of people?”
Draco draped an arm over his shoulders and pulled him close, still holding Harry’s hand. He just waited patiently while Harry blubbered into his shirt, into his neck.
‘Okay.’ He felt like one of his students—a first-year, most likely. Being admonished for breaking school rules. Well, this was a humbling experience.
“We have?” she asked excitedly. She didn’t wait for an answer, as she rushed over to the kitchen to have a look.
to Hermione? But just a few weeks ago, you were hexing me, telling me to fuck off, telling me I have a Hero Complex, telling me no one needs me to save them.’
A quick shrug. ‘They only want a grandchild. An heir. After that … my duty to family is done. Accomplished.’
Harry scratched a spot on his head. ‘Yeah, um, I think I’ll have a shower, then. You’ll be okay to …’ he looked around—nothing here seemed entertaining for a Malfoy. ‘You’ll be okay to hang out, or?’
The thought had only just occurred to him, since Harry's were around his shoulders and Draco's were held at a slight angle just inches from Harry's waist.
That didn’t sit well with Harry. It almost made Malfoy seem … understandable, human. But he gave an easy, not-thought-out, response anyway. ‘Still a git.’
Draco stood up, and made to leave for the door—but hesitated. ‘Did you even get vaccinated for this little trip of yours?’
Harry felt a bit stunned at the price, leaning over her shoulder to take a look. The little picture seemed nice, he supposed. Mahogany wood—glass windows with iron patterning, looking like vines. Not so different from the vines on their wedding invitation.
. Nor Terry Boot’s annoying flirting. And definitely not about how Harry might have a physical attraction to Draco-ferretface-Malfoy. Nothing. None of that. Just Potions.
. ‘Dumbledore can … and the Order of the Phoenix. Your family can go to a safe house, you can all be protected.’
So they hit up a Tesco on their way home. Draco still looked flawless in fluorescent lighting, Harry noted. That skin, that impossibly light hair … Okay, he needed to put the brakes on those thoughts.
Draco was the first to say ‘I love you,’ on an unremarkable snowy Sunday morning, after coming back from a brisk walk with the castle doors just a few strides away—when Harry’s nose was red from the cold, and Draco just had to say it. Couldn’t wait a moment longer.
'The caterers had leftover pastries,' Draco said, placing the white box on the coffee table. 'Help yourself if you'd like.'
, Harry. We can make our journals chime when it receives a message. That way we won’t miss anything important.’ Draco’s expression was quite serious and neutral, but, unless it was Harry’s imagination, his neck did seem a bit pink.
'You got it,' Harry said, almost impressed, as he opened the door wider and waited for Draco to crawl out of the thing.
'So, um, about last night. First of all, I need you tell you how sorry I am. You're on vacation, and you got sucked into my horrendous drama. I … I really didn't want you to see that.'
‘Please,’ Harry groaned again, pressing his arse back into Draco’s mouth. He needed more pressure, more …
Draco ran a hand through his sweat-dampened hair. Yeah. He could do this every day. It felt good. His chest felt warm, like a little flame had ignited. Or, like he’d blown on nearly burnt-out embers, reigniting them into something with the capacity to grow. To burn brighter.
Vector rose to her feet, wearing a full-scowl on her pale face now. “You cannot mean to think he isn’t up to something.”
Even being vaguely near, he’d feel terrible pangs of grief. Overwhelming pangs. Sometimes he'd have to Alohomora an empty classroom and give himself a moment to slow his breathing, and wipe away tears.
Instead he stood alone, in the center of his dorm room, staring off into space in a numb sort-of-trance. He didn’t remember walking there, didn’t know why he was standing. Didn’t care.
Okay. He’ll have a shower, get ready, then work on breakfast. He found he was already eager to cook for Draco again.
And then, black ink moving on parchment filled the screen. It was so familiar to Draco that it felt eerie. Muggles didn’t live in castles or use quills, right?
Merlin. Harry was so bloody warm. And Draco could feel Harry’s heart hammering, which was a comfort. It wasn’t just him, then. They were both... nervous? Was that the right word?
'Dave's excited to meet you,' Harry murmured. He cleared his throat and fixed Draco with a serious look. 'Just remember I'm Evan, and um, I don't really talk about my life in the UK.'
.' His face felt rather hot—that sodding tosser, just grinning back at him. Bloody torturing him, and
Harry squeezed him in tighter, then released. He was calm now, content. He could probably fall asleep easily, soon enough. They'd wanked each other off, they were naked in each other's arms … life was pretty good. Harry let his eyes stray downwards, he saw the scar tissue again, criss-crossing over Draco's chest, and brought his finger up to trace its path once more.
So he resumed sucking, with increased fervour. His free hand found Harry’s bollocks, smoothing over them, rolling them in his hand.
It was a thick leather book, indeed. It didn’t have any markings on the outside. Just the usual white parchment—this time taped flat to the front. It read:
Plunged into darkness, Harry couldn’t see anything at all, so he pinched his eyes shut. He’d try to sleep. No funny business, as Draco had said.
So, Draco went for clarification, “Are you telling me, Harry Potter, that your motivations towards swimming were perverted in nature?”
Blue skies overheard, the bluest of blue. The sun beaming down, warm on his skin. He was ... thoroughly relaxed.
Potter rolled his eyes. “I’ll push you in the lake next time,” he quipped, with the edges of his mouth twitching.
He thought he’d be fine. He’d already worked out that they were making each other unhappy, that they lacked proper communication, that their needs may’ve become incompatible—with Ginny being away a lot, and career taking priority. They’d procrastinated planning their own wedding for so long that the very topic had become dreaded. Simply: they weren’t working. So, shouldn’t he be relieved? Satisfied that they’d done the right thing for both of them?
Draco grimaced. And part of him was wondering what on earth was he getting himself into. Another, a very tiny part, felt a spark of excitement. A small thrill.
Harry looked at him, tears were streaming down the man’s face. It caused a jolt in Harry’s chest. Until it occurred to him, that it was only the onion.
I'm thinking I should warn for a bit of angst in this chapter, along with a brief hint of biphobia. (It's mild, by my standards anyhow!) ❤️❤️
Room service knocked, and she got up to handle it without a word. She took care of all of it, as he sat, useless and unable to move.
‘Then you must take a shot of this!’ Seamus said dramatically, pulling a bright pink bottle out from his robe pocket. ‘It’s bubble-gum flavour!’
'I'm glad,’ he said softly. He wondered if he’d always have this feeling, cooking for Malfoy, or if it’d someday feel normal and boring.
'Ah. Why am I not surprised the Gryffindor is asking me that?' Harry scoffed half-heartedly. Smiling, Draco admitted, 'Yeah, that all sounds good. I prefer it when someone else is doing the adventuring.'
“Ah. Well I may as well join you, then, and sit with my boyfriend too,” said Blaise, with a self-satisfied smile.
. His friend was bloody ridiculous. He took a sip of coffee, then pulled out the folded-up parchment from the cream-coloured envelope.
Potter nodded, lifting a shoulder in another half-hearted shrug. “—and I had to un-learn all that. I met Hagrid, I met Hermione and Ron, and they treated me like I was worth something.”
So—about that tag about making myself cry writing this ... it was during the spin-the-bottle rejection scene
Thing is, Harry hadn't been lying to Ginny when he'd said he hadn't heard from, or seen, Draco in years. But he had, kind-of, kept tabs on him. Kept abreast of certain activities ... Like how he helped to rebuild Hogwarts, for example (Harry hadn't, he'd been in Auror training). Or the apology letter he'd sent to Hermione, and the one to Luna. Harry even heard about him volunteering at St Mungo's, in the Janus Thickey ward, for a time. He wondered if the Malfoys had so much less money because they'd donated it to make reparations?
‘Well,’ she said, slapping her thighs and making to stand up, ‘I best get back to Ron. See you two later.’
Harry’s attention whipped back to McGonagall; he had no idea where she was going with this, but he was glad something was finally being done.
Then Harry prattled on in his easy way, and she answered back, smiling wider now. And Draco couldn't understand any of what was being said, but Harry seemed very much relaxed, in his element.
Draco blinked rapidly. His heart was racing. He wasn’t doing a good job of this. ‘It’s … she won’t tell anyone. She casually mentioned that you had a show tonight. And I’m here on vacation. I thought I’d … well, curiosity—or, erm ...’
The grey autumn sky threatened rain as Pansy and Draco were stood in the Hogwarts courtyard near the fountain, partially hidden from behind one of its stone pillars. Their fellow Eighth year Muggle Studies class were spread out around them, all packed with suitcases in hand, and ready for their trip. Some were more excited than others. Draco was... not.
Harry shook his head. 'Might've still been the same outcome. Seeing is different from hearing and … and I didn't predict that reaction. I thought we'd already, well, addressed it—like you said. But apparently something in me disagreed.' He offered an apologetic smile.
Ah. Should he really wear Draco’s clothes, and sleep in his bed? Well he didn’t really fancy wearing the same clothes he’d worn all day—even if he tried transfiguring them into something more comfortable. ‘If … you don’t mind.’ The two of them were probably vaguely the same size.
Come on, there had to be a different, less embarrassing one. Hadn’t they all been embarrassing, though?
Harry sat back in his chair, and stared at the paper. A smile grew on his face—he was pretty proud of himself. He wasn't ashamed of the year he'd had, the anxiety, the crying, the crippling depression. He wasn't weak or broken.
Potter whipped his head around, and looked up at Draco with a glazed and open face. Drunk then, probably. “Draco.”
Draco took a breath, squeezing his eyes shut. If Harry didn’t like him for who he truly was, and for what he’d done in his past, that was just something Draco was going to have to accept.
Harry tore his eyes away from the chair to look at him, and Draco couldn't get a read on that expression.
Glancing at Malfoy again, he couldn’t help but marvel at his journal-mate being Draco Malfoy all along. It was … well, not what he’d have ever guessed, and it would likely take some time getting used to it.
Harry smirked at him, and took another sip, looking out at the crowd—lazily scanning it, like he was content.
His thoughts switched to Draco. He realised he might like to have Draco around too. For some of those moments—holidays, events … Harry just liked talking to him. He wanted to know things about Draco—what he liked, what he disliked, what he hoped, what he feared … Draco was just so … bloody … something …
Harry laughed, which drew Draco's focus to Harry’s face, quite against his will. Merlin. They were rather close, weren’t they? And Harry Potter’s eyes hadn’t changed a tick. Still too-green, like emeralds. And impossibly kind, and …
Harry leaned forward to reach for Draco’s free hand where it rested on the table, and interlaced their fingers. ‘Juh tem.’
Harry leaned in closer to Draco's ear, and his lips brushed against the shell of it. 'Let's swim together later.'
A small smile grew on Draco’s face. ‘Yeah. We’re good.’ He licked at his bottom lip. ‘And I’m sorry. That was immature of me, I shouldn’t have just avoided you.’
‘Flowers, chocolates, now a stuffed toy. It reminds me of Muggle mating rituals. The man traditionally gifts the woman with flowers, chocolates, and teddy bears. It’s in all the romance films.’
Fuck, he felt awful. He groaned and twisted around in the blanket onto his stomach. And that incessant sound wasn't helping his head any. Where was his wand? He'd Incendio the arsehole.
anymore. With Voldemort dead, the Death Eaters dismantled, his family broken, and his old beliefs out the window—what was left? Well, studying, he supposed. That was all he did now. That and sleep.
Harry shrugged again. Malfoy should probably drop it now, he implored Malfoy to drop it now, before Harry could embarrass himself any worse than he already had.
Draco folded his arms over his chest, although it was a futile gesture since Potter had already had an eyeful. He sighed, they were really going to have to actually
Draco shook his head. ‘The whole purpose of knitting is to relax you ... it’s not going to relax you if you aren’t working the needles yourself. What’s the point if magic does it all for you? I guess you’d get the blanket or jumper you want or whatever … but you can usually buy them cheaper second-hand already complete. Yarn gets expensive.’
Harry found wine glasses, and he was just pouring their drinks when Malfoy emerged—in a white t-shirt and black joggers. Shit. Harry was momentarily struck dumb. It was just so … casual. Muggle. Domestic. And he had bare arms—Malfoy never had bare arms. Harry saw a flash of Malfoy’s Dark Mark—faded, mangled.
“I assure you that I am.” He was. There was no jealousy, no hurt, there. Not at all. Only love, only affection.
He opened the other package eagerly. Christmas trees with tits for baubles? God, where did Draco even
The waiter came back, and Malfoy said a lot of words at him, in his smooth sensual Italian, and then the waiter left with their menus.
Harry shrugged, and set off across the red carpet toward the door. He was going to open it for her—a not-so-subtle hint. “So he burns his mail,” he said without looking at her. “So what?”
Draco was staring at Harry’s beard, biting his bottom lip with an incisor. “So, why the scruffy look, then? Is this a new fashion? All the rage in—” He cut himself off abruptly.
‘But this person,’ he raised the journal again, his voice cracking, ‘had a fantasy. About me. It doesn’t make any sense, how could it be you?’
The Hamsters formed a line in the air to shake hands with the Slugs, and then the winners were paraded around the pitch—met with more claps and cheers.
‘He’d wanted to dance with me at the Yule Ball.’ It was just so … preposterous an idea. So strange that it was hard to get the image of it out of his mind. Draco … with one hand on the small of his back … the other holding Harry’s, as they danced in loopy circles on the dancefloor. In front of everyone. Merlin …
'Smells fantastic,' Draco said, reaching for the rice to scoop some onto his plate. ‘Thanks so much for cooking.’
Draco's fingers tightened against the t-shirt material at Harry's waist. He broke away, and asked, a bit out of breath, 'What now, then?'
Potter turned his head to the spot the ghost had been, too. And looked back up at Draco with wide-eyes, uncertainty apparent on his face. “Why would you—?”
Once in Fred and George’s room, Harry shut the door after the two of them and set his trunk at the base of Fred’s bed. The air in there still smelled of gunpowder from the twins’ experiments, and the floor still littered with cardboard boxes like a warehouse—though it wasn’t the most crowded Harry’d seen it. Draco carefully sidestepped a box, and set his trunk down near the far wall, and looked around the room at all the bits and bobs, the Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes merchandise peeking out of open boxes, and the Muggle music posters on the walls. He wrung his hands.
He hadn't gotten any closer to figuring things out. (Namely: the enigma that is Harry Potter.) But he did feel a great deal calmer than he had at lunchtime.
2. I remember magically-linked journals being a drarry trope back in the day, so yeah! Here’s my version
Harry rolled his eyes—actually rolled his eyes at Draco. Terribly rude. 'That's not good hostmanship.'
They just looked at each other for a moment—Draco's eyes wide and open and … affectionate. Harry found himself glancing at Draco’s lips. Watched as Draco bit his. So, Harry took a step closer. ‘You know,’ he said, under his breath. ‘Homosexuality is legal in Britain.’
Malfoy glared at them in Harry’s hand, as a muscle twitched in his jaw. “Did you open them?” His voice was flatter than his facial expression.
He looked to Malfoy, to see how he’d react. Malfoy raised his eyes then, finally, to look at Harry with a maddeningly unreadable expression.
‘Oh,’ Harry said, his heart hammering. ‘Well, you’re welcome. And … you gave me my first, too.’ He felt a blush creep on his cheeks. They were only talking about flowers, but it felt like more than that.
He'd known people that couldn't seem to get over their first loves. People who kept going back and back and back, despite what the other person had done to them.
Luna smiled, dreamily. ‘Oh, I was just reminiscing with him about the wonderful tea he used to bring me. When I lived in his basement.’
Draco paused his testing of Harry’s hand mobility. ‘I can see that. You were good at your … what did you call it?—Dumbledore’s Army. Or at least, I heard you were.’
Harry opened up the package and looked inside. Oh. The things inside were a bit weird looking. Sort of like lumpy potato croquettes, or perhaps some kind of dried Afghan bug. He gave the inside a sniff. It smelled sweet and a bit floral. Shrugging to himself, Harry dipped a hand in and pulled one out. It was hard in his hand. He popped it into his mouth and bit down—and Merlin, was it
Draco leaned against the tree trunk and exhaled slowly. And began to go over the day's events from the start. He wanted to think.
He nodded, suppressing a shiver from the warm breath ghosting over his ear. ‘Why aren’t you dancing?’ he nearly-yelled back.
Draco, who would rather kiss a Hippogriff than risk his life riding in a magicless metal box over a body of water, remembered that brief peaceful walk through the forest earlier. So, he opted for what Flitwick called ‘a hike’.
. They entered through the front door, single file, into one of the few places that had ever felt like home to Harry. But now, now it was just not quite the same.
With matching small smiles, they finally appeased Harry’s friends and climbed into the backseat of the car. Draco ended up in the middle, a bit squished between Dimitri and Harry. Ruben twisted round from the front seat and eyed Draco with a look he couldn’t quite decipher. It didn’t seem unfriendly, though.
“Mm,” Harry acknowledged, staring unseeing at the dancing reds, oranges, golds, and blues crackling inside the hearth in his small living room.
Harry sighed, and looked away. He watched the people walking around down below. Some were couples, holding hands as they strolled leisurely—like they walked without a set destination in mind. It seemed nice.
Oh bloody hell. He’d written what she’d said, because she was watching and he didn’t want to, well, offend her or anything. Harry looked up at her, then, and forced a smile. She took the card from him, with a pleased smile on her face, and sealed it up for him. Before he’d had a chance to see if there was something nearby he could spill on it, so that the ink would run.
Harry pulled himself off of the couch, and swayed a bit over to his hearth. Okay, maybe he was slightly more than buzzed.
Tears were pouring down Harry's face. He hated it, hated this. Hated crying. Hated that he was wholly unprepared for it, for this.
Draco blinked. He didn't know much about Muggle sports. There was the one with kicking a ball, that much he knew.
‘Fuck,’ Harry muttered under his breath. It was all true. He’d attacked Draco, gotten detention with Snape, missed Quidditch, and kissed Ginny. All in 24 hours. He’d never even considered … He’d never thought to …
Astoria grabbed hold of Draco's arm, and lifted up on her toes, just as Draco bent down. Harry winced, thinking they were going to kiss. But, Astoria whispered something in Draco's ear, backing away slightly to look up meaningfully into his eyes.
Harry blinked at him. He wasn’t about to waste this opportunity—this opportunity to be with a human being. ‘That’s okay. I’ll just sit here.’ He sat on the kitchen island barstool.
Harry leant his forehead against the side of Draco's—hot and slightly damp from sweat. His curls brushed against him.
‘I just read your note, and I wasn’t thinking.’ Dream-Draco laughed at himself. ‘It could’ve waited until at least sunrise, I suppose. You seemed upset though … and I felt awful …' Dream-Draco trailed off. It all sounded rather relevant to waking life.
?” He looked around, and, sure enough, Weasley and Blaise were excitedly talking to one another, beside a very bored-looking Potter.
…' her gaze shifted to Harry. And he remembered that moment in the Forbidden Forest, when all Mrs Malfoy had needed to know was that her son was all right. That was all it'd taken to betray Voldemort. '… that you may not make it, all that mattered in the world was your safety. Your happiness.'
Harry exchanged a look with Draco, like: what were they doing here? Draco smirked back, and gestured over to the table with all the bottles.
Harry was shifting his weight from foot to foot, impatiently. He was doing a good job of resisting shouting, he thought.
They piled into the Room of Requirement, met with cheers and screams of their names. They were surrounded by a hoard of their schoolmates, hugged and ruffled and clapped on the back. Neville got them to back up, to give them some space.
'Fascinating, isn't it? Wizards used to practice the same religions as Muggles—I suppose because we were more integrated back then. Magic was … a secret and private thing, for small gatherings within families or small communities.'
Maybe he should think about trying to take it slow with Draco. But, his mind couldn’t supply a reason as to
The lady eyed her appraisingly. “You are a new one. On an important errand, are you? Well, come on in.” The portrait swung open, to reveal a mostly maroon-coloured room.
Harry looked up, and he could barely make Draco out through the tears in his eyes, he was just a wet blur.
And, at some point in the night, so did Draco’s bare icy feet. They snaked their way up Harry’s pyjama bottom legs, just a bit, to press up against Harry’s shin bones.
It was another half hour or so until dinner, so Harry headed for Gryffindor Tower in order to drop off his stuff.
It was Draco’s turn to fetch them their third refill. So he grabbed their cups, and went to the table to fill them up with more Firewhisky.
Draco laughed breathily, as if he couldn’t believe Harry would ask something so unimportant. ‘Fine. Very little turbulence. I watched Julie and Julia.’
Blinking up at the ceiling, Draco replied, ‘I suppose I’ve always known that I preferred men. Though I didn’t know what it really meant, or what it entailed, until Hogwarts. Until I went to the library and looked up the words I’d heard father say, or the words Blaise had said. When I read about it, it made sense. It explained my feelings.’
I have been working on this story off-and-on since September 2019. About 66K is written right now, but it’s not yet completely finished, so I can’t promise when it’ll all be posted … I’m hoping, though, that by starting to post this, I’ll motivate myself to finally finish (and will stop procrastinating)
Harry stared at the page for a while. Nothing happened. It brought back memories of Tom Riddle's diary, of course, but the person inside this one seemed very different from the young Voldemort. Definitely less manipulatively charismatic than him, and more … despondent? Rude? A touch dramatic?
Ginny laughed. ‘I noticed that too. Charlotte is her name. It’s actually pretty cute, the two of them.’
'But … ever since I was young, I was made to believe …' Draco swallowed. 'That my duty to the family was to produce a Malfoy heir.'
Draco turned slightly to the crowd. 'Good friend of Harry Potter, wasn't he?' he said, forcing a smile.
And so it went. Malfoy ignored him. Avoided him. Refused to speak to or acknowledge him in any capacity. It was like Harry was invisible.
Sure, wanking didn’t necessarily mean much, Harry reasoned. It didn’t mean Malfoy fancied him or anything. They were teenagers, blokes wanked to nearly anything.
He wobbled through the crowd, only spilling a little bit onto his fingers and onto the floor, probably. Maybe a little on a couple people, but they’d bumped him so he was hardly at fault.
Harry didn’t know how to respond to that. Instead, he grabbed a pair of socks, and went to sit on the edge of the bed to pull them on.
‘It’s not like we’re strangers. We’re next-door neighbours. It’s already practically like living together.’
‘It’s okay. I think everyone’s figured it out,’ Harry said, biting his lip and looking to George and Angelina for confirmation.
It all passed by quickly, with Harry telling Moira the news. She seemed genuinely pleased for them, and let him prattle on about how happy he was (and how wonderful Draco was) for the whole session.
It was a lovely tattoo, as a whole. Harry really liked it. The look of it and the meaning behind it. The butterfly wings flapped faintly, and one of the flowers swayed as if there were a breeze.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's bare, sweaty back. 'I'm not sure I'd survive better than that.'
Merlin. Malfoy seemed like a really nice teacher. Patient. Encouraging. The sort of teacher Harry needed at age eleven.
Harry looked beyond them, at a frail Lucius slowly standing up from his chair, leaning heavily on his cane. With his mouth set in a firm line, he made eye contact with Harry and nodded, once. Harry nodded back, tentatively.
“Oh. Yeah. Just up half the night with Victoire. We’re looking after her and Dominique while Bill and Fleur visit Charlie for a week.”
Draco was pleased with the opportunity to explain himself. His whole face lit up—like he’d discovered something brilliant and he knew it. It was his time to show off. Draco held up the big book so Harry could read the spine.
‘But … even excusing his behaviour in the war. Wasn’t he, well, always a snobbish stuck up git anyhow? He called Hermione the m-word, he made badges just to ridicule me.’
Harry eyed Malfoy twirling Astoria around, as laughter lit up Astoria’s sweet face. “Do you want to dance?” he asked Ginny, without tearing his eyes away from the dancefloor.
He brought his knees to his chest, and rested his forehead against them. His Draco was not the old Draco, he reminded himself. The war had changed him, or ... or allowed the real him to come out. The old Draco was largely who he was because of his father’s influence, and
‘Mm?’ Draco took another sip of his strawberry lemonade, squinting out at the rolling hills beyond Pansy’s backyard. They stretched out for kilometres, interrupted only by the occasional crumbling stone wall that served to separate the properties.
'I'm … glad you like it.' Draco's compliments on his cooking made him feel very warm, in his chest. It just made him want to keep doing it—keep cooking and cooking and cooking.
“Ah. Well, perhaps he assumed you knew. Or, perhaps it would’ve been a bit embarrassing to explain out loud.”
“I’d be afraid to be a father … in case I’d turn out anything like mine,” Malfoy said quietly, pushing his dish away from him.
‘Mm, it’s good. Change is always difficult at first, but one quickly finds variety is the spice of life, you see?’
Harry shrugged to himself, and thought that was enough for today. He placed the journal in the top drawer of his nightstand.
Draco removed his sodding jeans right then and there, out in the open. It’s not like Potter would be coming back to walk in on him. He changed into clean boxer briefs, and considered changing into pyjamas. But... he was alone, and this time he knew Potter wasn’t coming back. He didn’t need to wear bedclothes befitting a Malfoy like at home, or need to cover up like in his dorm. So, he put on a large soft t-shirt instead, something Pansy picked out, of course. It was heather grey and had a black tree design on the centre of the chest.
'Mmhmm,' Draco murmured. The hairs on his arms were standing up, and he could already feel his heartrate picking up—in a good way. In a very good way.
Potter closed the distance, pressing his closed lips firm against Draco’s. Puffs of Potter’s breath flitted over Draco’s cheek. Draco relaxed into it. Potter relaxed into it. They planted tentative little pecks against each other’s lips.
Close enough to see Draco better, and, not for the first time, he marveled at how good-looking the bloke was. How elegant and at-ease he looked, all long graceful limbs, soaring in loops, while studiously looking around for the Snitch.
‘I’ve got this book, you see. It’s a Muggle one,’ Neville began. ‘So, supposedly, for Muggles, certain flowers have symbolic meanings to them when they’re gift-giving. And I thought you might like to hear what your flower represents, that is ... in case your admirer was sending a message?’
Potter stared at him; his expression conflicted. “I should’ve saved you. I should’ve brought you with us, at the Manor then. I should have done more to help you.
After approximately the twentieth time of this, Harry sighed and shoved his homework away, picking up the journal again. He opened to a fresh page and started writing, just spur of the moment stuff—just random thoughts as they came.
“Come on slug-Seeker, hurry it along!” Harry called. His team Seeker was diving after Malfoy’s, but a body’s length away.
Draco pushed back at his chair, and walked off to collect the paper. In the meantime, Harry set the dishes to self-clean.
'Fair enough.' Harry watched Draco turn and saunter out of the room—with a chest chock-full of affection for him.
know.’ He really shouldn’t be indulging them … ‘The two packages I have received recently have been anonymous.’
“Mm,” Harry uttered. He stretched and tilted his head up, pressing his dry lips to Draco’s. “Sleep good?” he asked as he leaned back to get a bleary look at Draco’s face.
‘Something to think about, anyhow. She’s still working out the logistics,’ said Hermione. ‘Formal invitations will be sent out in a month.’
Storm chasers. What a ridiculous idea. Gryffindors, most likely, all of them. What other sort would willingly get close to something so deadly, simply for the thrill of it?
Astoria brushed a strand of hair out of his face. “You’re sure you all right with this? All right with talking about this?”
“Maybe she’s not the one for me, you know? Or, maybe ‘the one’ isn’t something that exists … it’s just … Okay, I admit, seeing Malfoy and his wife—” Hermione’s eyebrows went up a fraction. “—made me realise that if I were to get married, today, I wouldn’t feel a fraction of that joy or that love. I wouldn’t cry at the sight of her walking down the aisle. I … fuck, this sounds bad, but I wouldn’t be happy, because … because I think I don’t want Ginny to be my wife. If I imagine it—her walking up the aisle towards me—all I feel is this sense of dread. Like there’s something terribly wrong with that image.”
He was stirring the onions, with a wooden spoon, when he registered that Draco was beside him. Harry’s heart rate sped up just at the knowledge of it. He glanced at Draco, wine glass in hand, frowning down at the browning onions.
She laid out the cheese platter and the glasses of wine on the floor. “Come on, let’s sit on the floor.”
A house elf—who’d evidently been listening in—brought over a little ceramic cup of milk, and one of sugar.
Okay, maybe Harry was being a bit rude. He genuinely liked it, he did. It just shocked him, is all. He thought he’d had Malfoy pegged—
Harry and Malfoy shared a look, not knowing what she was talking about. Harry’s eyes dropped to Malfoy’s chest—Malfoy had thrown on a navy-blue jumper with a giant gold ‘H’ in their rush that morning. Harry smiled again, biting his lip.
‘I … guess that’s true. But we could try anyway. We could try … to be friends.’ He winced. What was he doing—did he really think it possible? After years of animosity?
More of them kept coming in, and Harry couldn’t push past them to leave. He looked at Malfoy, who was staring back at him, with jaw clenched.
He looked around for Blaise, and found him, talking to Weasley by the drink table. Draco raised his eyebrows, lifted a hand and pointed at Pansy overtop her head. Blaise rolled his eyes, but smiled anyhow, and swaggered over to rescue Draco from his ridiculous best friend.
Malfoy leaned in towards Harry’s ear, and said, “Should we make a wager, then?” He leaned back a bit, looking straight into Harry’s eyes—wide-open and daring.
Sighing, Draco figured he should oblige her anyhow. It was probably his fault she was dead anyway, he thought with a pang to his chest. If she wanted to read his stupid poems, the least he could do was let her.
A small smile grew on Draco’s mouth. ‘I didn’t kiss him just now, and I didn’t spin. I drank two bubble-gum shots,’ he said, scrunching up his nose again. It was cute when he did that. ‘And then I went to find you.’
She frowned back at him from the other side of Harry’s DADA office desk, clicking her red, glossy fingernails against the desktop as she awaited response. Her black eyes bore into him, revealing nothing of her true motives. He’d always been a bit wary of her—she was always so intense. Needlessly intense. It was unnerving.
Flitwick’s voice brought Draco out of his thoughts. "Everyone! Please place your hands on your Portkeys.”
He palmed at Malfoy’s cheeks, trying to get him to just stay still—to let Harry kiss him back properly.
Harry pulled back again, looking into Draco's bright, silvery eyes. 'Draco. I love you too, you know? I love you.’'
Draco laughed, again. Merlin, this didn’t seem real. ‘You have a funny way of flirting, Harry.’ Then, without hesitation (because Circe knew he’d already waited long enough to kiss Harry James Potter), Draco leaned in, and pressed his lips against Harry’s.
Next up was a group of people in pink fluffy onesies with little ears and nubby tails, flying in on brooms—doing flips and jumping from broom to broom.
Harry reached up to touch Draco’s cheek, thumbing at his cheekbone. ‘I … suppose that makes sense. You’ll tell me if I do something wrong?’
'Right,' Draco said gently. 'But you're famous for a lot more than that. For being … well, the one to vanquish him. The one who triumphed against all odds … who united a resistance. And at only seventeen—'
They navigated their way through cardboard boxes, bits of Styrofoam, and loose plastic bags to Draco's office door, and went inside.
“The thing is … I do want to have kids, more than anything. But I haven’t brought it up with Hannah yet.”
With his gaze set on Draco’s face, Harry shut the door behind himself softly. A muscle twitched in Draco’s jaw, and he snapped the book closed.
‘Egh. Don’t remind me.’ Draco scrunched his nose up. Then his expression sobered. ‘But,’ he sighed, ‘that fantasy may be meaningless, for
Molly burst into a wail when she found Fred’s silver hand had fallen from the Weasley clock. It was probably the worst sound Harry had ever had to hear.
With anxiety flooding his chest, his eyes flicked over to Potter, who was stood with his usual throng of fellow heroes and do-gooders. They were all laughing about something, and Longbottom had Finnegan in a headlock. Potter laughed along with the rest of them, and scratched at the side of his head.
Harry strode over silently, and pulled him off the kid, flipping Malfoy unceremoniously over so his back was against the wall. ‘What the hell, Malfoy?’ Harry meant it, meant for a real answer.
Draco blinked at the man; he wasn’t sure why Potter was explaining what the party would entail. It wouldn’t change anything—he’s still Draco bloody Malfoy. “No thank you.”
to kiss you. And not like that—not in front of everyone else. Not when it’s forced and doesn’t mean anything. If I were to kiss you … I’d want it to be because
Frowning, Draco snatched up three drinks in both his hands, and worked on following Dave—who'd already disappeared.
Harry took out his parchment, his quill, his books, glancing up at Malfoy every once and a while. Malfoy kept staring down at his page, not moving.
Harry drank another mouthful of maroon, finishing off his cup. He pried the bottle hanging loosely from Draco’s hand at his side. Draco turned, to watch him pour another serving, and wordlessly accepted the bottle back.
Harry chanced a glance at Draco—who looked back at Harry with a raised eyebrow and a slight smirk. “I may’ve mentioned you once … she just liked your name a lot, is all.”
He laughed under his breath. 'Yeah, all right.' Harry wasn't sure flowers would really do anything for him, but he was up for it.
Without warning, Draco leapt into Harry’s arms, down on the floor, almost knocking Harry onto his back. Draco’s knees were flush against the side of Harry’s thighs, as he grabbed on to Harry tight, with one arm wrapped around his shoulders, another hand buried in Harry’s hair. And Draco nuzzled his head; his nose buried in the black curls, breathing in shakily.
“Morning, mate,” Harry said to Ron, cheerfully, as he slipped into his desk chair. He was kind of in a good mood today, he realised. Huh ... he wasn't sure why.
The edge of her lip quirked up, along with an eyebrow. “One hundred percent, Harry. I have no reason to lie to you. Someone else sent you that valentine song six years ago.”
'No,' he said again. In another context, he might’ve gotten defensive, but Harry seemed genuinely curious. Draco wished he could see Harry's eyes behind those sunglasses, instead of Draco’s own face reflected back. 'That’s not what happened, is it?'
And just like that, Harry was coming in strings of pearly liquid onto Draco's nightshirt, onto his chin and hand.
His wounds had opened, wider and wider. There’d been so much redness. Flesh and blood and then bone exposed. Blood pouring out and soaking the bed. The white of Malfoy's ribcage. Harry had been unable to move, unable to speak. Frozen in place.
He found the Portkey and unwrapped it—a yellow crisp clip, the kind to preserve your bags of crisps—and pressed it to the both of them.
Harry trailed after Malfoy, taking bites of his croissant as he went along. Malfoy pushed open the castle’s front doors, and walked out into the cool autumn sunshine. When Harry pushed the door—a few seconds after him—Malfoy whirled to face him immediately. Malfoy seemed tense—his posture all rigid, his expression carefully masked.
He nodded slowly. ‘Anytime.’ At least, he hoped he could. He’d certainly try, whenever needed. 'And if you want to talk more ...'
Draco didn’t watch them leave, he stared at his own shoes instead. After a short moment, he sighed and uncrossed his arms. Then, got up to walk back. He didn’t want to run in to Weasley and Potter again on their way back to the resort.
“Shit. Fucking … Jesus. What?” Potter looked around with wide-eyes, rubbing the side of his head. “Unbelievable.” He turned back to face Draco, and shook his head. “Bloody unbelievable,” he repeated those words under his breath, backing away slowly, until spinning on his heel and charging out of the library altogether.
For one thing, Draco was pretty certain Harry Potter was straight. For another, in the miniscule chance that he wasn’t, Draco had already made far too many mistakes that he’d never be able to make up for. He’d been horrible, he had been cruel, he’d been a sodding Death Eater for fuck’s sake. You can’t come back from that. You certainly can’t come back from that with an 'I’m sorry' and expect Harry Potter to like you.
He couldn’t explain the ache he felt lately, or the racing heartbeats. Not to mention the total inability to think of anything besides Draco Malfoy and that sodding pearl. It was sort of awful. He didn’t understand any of it himself.
“Well,” Draco said. “Are you going to be all right? With …” He waved the hand the held his cup around. “
Oh, Merlin, he was going to need to calm down before breakfast. Maybe take a cold shower—or, better yet, a nice wank in the shower.
“It’s okay,” Draco said automatically. Potter looked sceptical and a bit distraught. “I’m... fine with you knowing.” He meant that, though he’d be hard-pressed to come up with an explanation. Draco took another step forward.
“And …" He trailed off. Harry glanced at him, to find he seemed a bit pinker than he had before. Malfoy cleared his throat again. “Just … follow my lead.”
He shrugged. ‘All you two do is couple stuff, I thought you were too busy snogging to notice.’ Maybe that was a bit harsh.
Harry took his hand back, since Draco seemed done with it, and placed the other—rather neglected—one on Draco’s thigh. He wiggled his fingers until Draco started to touch it, tracing the lines on his palm with a fingernail.
He sighed. ‘Morgan wants me to stay out of the way while they upgrade the office with the new computers.’
There’d been a lot of coupling up over the summer, evidently. He’d suspected Dean and Seamus were into each other before—he'd shared a dorm with them, after all—and now he had the visual evidence. And auditory evidence.
Before he could do something stupid, Draco wrestled the cup out of Potter’s clenched hands and took a gulp.
'This is really nice,' Harry remarked, looking around the room over Draco's shoulder. 'All of it. And it was kind what you said. I think Colin's parents were touched.'
Potter caught up to him, breathing fast, like he’d been rushing. A red flush covered his cheeks—whether from exertion or embarrassment, Draco could only guess.
They brought their teas into the living room and settled onto the sofa. Draco leaned over to snatch the closest gift to himself, and handed it over to Harry.
Pansy hooked her arm in the crook of his elbow, and said, “Come on. Help me choose what to wear, then we’ll go down together.”
“We don’t get along—we've never gotten along. From the very beginning, I wanted to be his friend, and he rejected me. You hear that? He rejected me.”
“Fine.” Malfoy exhaled out his nose, leaning back and lifting the menu up again, but Harry caught a proper smile on his face.
Harry furrowed his brow. ‘We’ve learnt so much about one another through the diary … And he always has something supportive to say, something that helps me, and allows me to see things from a different perspective. I don’t know, a more … grounded perspective, a sensible perspective, I think. He’s become … a real friend.’
Harry was finished first. He loved it. The tattoo artist, Gary, pressed a hot towel to his arm. Then some ointment, and a bandage.
Harry pulled back first, and searched Draco’s face with bright, wide eyes. ‘I wanted to do that for a while. All through the planning and the dinners and the suit-fittings. You’re so irritatingly fit and composed all the time that I just want to ruffle you.’ Draco raised an eyebrow as Harry let out a nervous laugh. ‘But I thought there was no way … no chance you’d ever …' he trailed off, staring at Draco’s mouth.
She smiled. ‘I’m so happy to hear that, Harry. But call or make an appointment anytime if you need to chat about anything, yeah? Recovery isn’t a destination, and it isn’t always a straight road.’
But then ... he wasn’t. Malfoy pulled back, and, without looking at Harry, turned to survey their work.
Draco had never been in there before, he looked around in awe at the various cooking utensils, the pots and pans floating in the air.
Harry took out his envelope, and smiled at it … his name in Malfoy’s (Draco’s?) pretty handwriting. He turned the envelope over to open it.
Malfoy turned to Harry, jabbing a finger towards him. That wild look in his bright grey eyes was back, the same from the morning before. “You,” he accused. “You never—” His voice broke again. He whirled to face Minerva, breathing in pants. “I don’t need to take this.”
Harry heard the front door open with a creak. He turned his head to find Draco shyly padding over towards him.
“So don’t,” Harry said in a breath. “Just … can you let me talk for a minute? You don’t have to say anything.”
‘Yes. Yeah. Fuck. Continue. Please,’ Harry managed, digging his fingers into the comforter to prepare, this time.
“Dray-co Mal-foy!” Rose sing-songed as she glided into the room, over emphasizing each syllable. “What’s a Dray-co Mal-foy?” she asked, gripping a parchment in her little hands.
Draco felt … he didn’t know how he felt. But it’d been wonderful. Potter had danced with him all throughout—taking his hands, twirling him in circles.
Left in a large, plain green shirt and clashing orange Chudley Cannons boxer shorts (that Ron gave him for Christmas one year), he walked over to the bed Draco currently occupied.
Harry pulled back slightly, his eyes were lidded. “We could stay in here today,” Harry murmured. “We could just snog all day.”
Potter eyed him on the floor, wrapped up in his blanket, with bare pale legs outstretched. Draco brought his legs up close to his chest in defence.
Draco was struck speechless, and before he could react, Potter was grabbing Draco’s arm to drag him inside. His left forearm to be exact, causing Draco to tense up again.
It seemed to work. Draco’s face softened, and he exhaled. ‘Well … I was always curious as to why the Muggles held those little rectangular things to their ears. That is what those are, yeah? Mobiles?’
He rose to his feet, and grabbed a croissant to go from the basket of baked goods, because he hadn’t quite finished eating and he shouldn’t have to go hungry all morning because of this. Then, Harry followed Malfoy out. It was easy enough, because Malfoy wasn’t rushing.
The silent room seemed larger after Potter left, and he felt a slight ringing in his ears at the lack of noise. Draco took his white cotton pyjamas to the bathroom to change, locking the bathroom door behind himself with a click. He turned to his reflection in the mirror, and startled. The bathroom light was far too bright, and did nothing for him. He normally didn’t like to look in mirrors these days—now, his reflection looked a bit miserable.
Ah, right. The sodding drinks he's carting around for some reason. So as not to waste them, he supposed.
‘Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some business to attend to.’ Tea-business. It was important—much more important than silly gifts. He didn’t wait for a reply from the girls, and stalked off towards the kitchens.
Harry turned his head when Draco reached him, and let his feet sink so he could stand upright. Smiling now (thank Merlin, Draco thought), Harry said, 'Tell me about your romantic past, then. I hope it's more cheerful than mine.'
'The pictures,' Harry echoed under his breath, looking rather amused. He cleared his throat. 'What did you watch?'
Draco sucked in a breath and whipped his head to the side to look at Harry. ‘What are you talking about?’
And he didn’t want to be petulant. He wished he could be more mature about seeing Draco kiss Terry Boot. But he couldn’t. And wouldn’t.
He soon found himself in front of one of Colin's portraits of Harry Potter. It was Third year, he guessed, because Harry had had pretty decent hair that year—had a bit of style, and wasn't as shaggy and flat and later years. Of course, Harry's hair was best nowadays—curly and bouncy, shaved close on the sides.
“He thinks I’d hurt you,” Draco finished for him. As if Slytherins would really go around smothering people in their sleep. Well, granted, his aunt might've. Draco sighed.
Harry would be hard-pressed to come up with an explanation, a reason, as to why the whole scene seemed the sweetest thing. This was Malfoy, after all. The same Malfoy who repeatedly told him to fuck off a few weeks ago. Told him he has a Hero Complex, told him no one needs his saving.
Potter just blinked back at him, and they stared at each other. At a standstill. Draco didn’t know how to proceed. Potter’s fellow Gryffindors seemed to take that as an invitation to say something.
Draco shook his head, as if to clear it. He wasn’t able to process whatever Granger was trying to say. ‘I’m going to the library.’
Odd that a person would return a used diary to Flourish and Blotts though ... Harry read the dates more carefully, and the timeline didn't make any sense.  Harry bought the diary before class started … and these dates were this past week. Had someone in Gryffindor started writing in it? He looked around the darkened room, at all the closed curtains around him.
Harry did not look very comfortable—with his leg draped over the one armrest, and his head smooshed against the other. An arm was sticking out from under him at an angle, and hanging off the chair. He did not fit.
Once the room was good and silent, Draco clicked the video posted just after his return to London, titled "Dancing to my remix of Tattoo by Jordin Sparks".
He leant forward to get a better look. Potter was dressed only in shorts and was pumping his fists in the air fast, in time to the beat. Then he whipped his arms around in a wide circle, doing a twirl. Next, he rhythmically bounced and crouched on his feet.
'You …' Draco said through a gasp. 'Fuck—' He popped his softening cock out of Harry's mouth and collapsed down beside him. He only lay there for a few seconds before planting a kiss on Harry's cheek, and crawling down the bed. Then Draco wasted no time in swallowing Harry's cock into his mouth.
“One glance at a baby and you’re a wreck,” Draco said fondly. “Who knew the great Harry Potter was so soft?”
He was fifteen minutes late to Charms. Hermione shot him a questioning look, he returned it with a shrug of his shoulders and slipped into the empty seat beside Neville.
Waiting for Draco again, then. He flipped on the television, but it was all in the Afghan language, so he switched it off again. Instead, he let his eyes drift around the room, and tried to imagine Draco coming home there every day. Tired from a long shift … sitting in the very chair Harry was in, scribbling notes on various diseases or types of injuries. Or, watching Afghan television. Did Draco speak the language? Harry wouldn’t be surprised if he did. Draco seemed clever enough to learn other languages.
‘Oh,’ Harry said breathily, blinking slowly. That was … a relief? ‘So, uh, have you ever had a boyfriend, then?’
His old defences, back from his school days, begged to be let to the surface. They wanted him to scowl and bite back to save face. But … Draco wasn’t going to let them. He was … more mature than that (or so he hoped).
Draco nodded, but didn’t look at him. Though … he was smiling a little. Perhaps that was enough, then. Harry had smoothed it over.
She put her cup down as well, schooling her mouth into a straight line, while waiting for him to continue.
Since Harry was in the bathroom, he dressed quickly out in the open. Harry came out as Draco was just tugging a t-shirt into place. He was quick with his showers, evidently. And... Harry was dressed in a towel, smiling at Draco.
Jesus. Harry groaned, properly. Had he really written ‘love’? This was terrible. He was going to have to move—he’d have to leave the country, probably.
“Okay!” She brightened. “Let’s see what they still need!” The girl pressed a few more buttons, and a display of items popped up on the screen. Things like plates and saucepans. “Oh,” her voice dropped. “Um, I’m sorry, sir,” she said as she scrolled through. “A lot of these items have already been purchased for the couple.”
‘Really, Potter, explain it to me. Why are you so mopey? Does it really have something to do with me?’
He’d forgotten to close the curtains, so the sunrise woke Draco up. He stretched and looked over at Potter’s bed. It was still made up. He hadn’t come back last night, then.
Harry forced himself to maintain eye contact, despite how uncomfortable Malfoy’s intense gaze felt. ‘I don’t hate you.’ Surprisingly, it felt like the truth. ‘Do you?’
Harry tilted his head to look at him. He was ridiculous there, just stuffed into that chair. 'Yeah?'
Harry obeyed, shimmying out of the navy-blue boxer briefs. Malfoy bit his lip and stared at his body.
Harry was in awe of him. ‘But you … used to hate Muggles.’ He didn’t mean to be harsh, it was just fascinating how Draco could go from despising them ... to living among them—to
Harry took them, and finally looked down at the food. Whatever it was had been beautifully arranged inside the box—a colourful mixture of golden yellow, white, fresh green, and orange-red. ‘What … is it?’
“I love it,” Malfoy said emphatically, as he eyed the top of Harry’s head. “I’ve always loved it. The curls. Merlin … I’ve always wanted to pull at one to see if it bounced back.” He promptly reached out and pulled at a lock of hair. “Oh my God, it does. It bounces back into place.”
Harry spent the next few days leading up to Christmas wallowing a bit. He figured he deserved a little time feeling sorry for himself. He stopped shaving (what was the point?), and he watched sappy romantic comedies on his DVD player—all wrapped up in a blanket and crying to the screen that he’d never again find love. You know, normal stuff.
He took his coffee over to a free seat by the shop window, and settled into it—undoing his coat and loosening his scarf. As he sipped at his drink, he watched people rush by outside, bundled up from the cold, some clutching on to their shopping bags, others staring down at those funny mobile phones that Muggles seemed to favour.
‘Right, okay.’ Harry opened his journal to the latest part. He ignored the part with his melancholy words, and Draco’s emphatic
he thought he knew who Malfoy was. But maybe he’d been completely wrong, and that was probably a good thing.
, and kissing Draco’s neck. Just lightly there, featherlight. And breathing out through his mouth, just hot breath against Draco’s neck.
Draco enveloped him in his arms again, and kissed the top of his head. 'You're sweaty. Let's have a shower. Yeah?'
Harry smiled, shaking his head, and, wordlessly, they both found themself wandering to sit on the sofa Astoria had only just vacated, moments before.
So, at dinner the next day, over roast beef and Yorkshire puddings, Harry worked up the courage to ask (perfectly normally and casually): “Can I talk to you later?”
Was that a jab? He decided to ignore it; people certainly had their own ideas of who he was, ideas he has no control over. And that’s okay. As his Mind Healer had helped him realise: he can be whoever he wants to be, he exists for himself and not anyone else. But … the bigger issue here is what those Gryffindors had done ...
Harry went to Heathrow, as a surprise. He’d looked up flight arrival times, but ended up early to the airport on accident.
‘Thanks,’ Harry said, accepting his “Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada” mug. ‘Have you been to Vegas?’
He smiled, couldn’t help it. ‘Malfoy has a flat in the city. We’re planning to stay there and have, as he calls it, a “Mental Health weekend”.’
They lay back on the grass, to look up. The night had become cool, but not cool enough to warrant going inside just yet. Insects buzzed around, so Draco took out his wand and cast an insect-repelling charm on the two of them.
Turning to Ron, Harry said, “Ginny and I haven’t really been happy for a while, I think. And by the time I realised it … I already felt like I was drowning in it, if that makes sense?" Ron didn't answer, but he waited for Harry to continue, looking quite mournful. "We ... we never really talked anymore, like,
She rung him up, as his eyes roamed over the merchandise on display atop the desk. Anything to look distracted so that she wouldn’t talk to him. His gaze caught on the most ridiculous socks—ones with stark-naked, chubby Father Christmases, naked Mrs Clauses, ones with penises wrapped up like Christmas gifts, and other various ridiculousnesses.
, this time with a pinkness blossoming high on his cheeks. ‘It’d been good for a while, but in the end, we wanted very different things. He wasn’t ready for anything truly serious, and who could blame him—we were still in our early twenties. But, I’ve never had a proper family … and … and that’s something I’ve always wanted,’ Harry admitted.
Lastly, he performed a shaving charm, and gave himself a once-over in the mirror. He looked good, or as best he could look anyhow.
Draco hummed. ‘Yes. The idea that even in nature, true love and eternal devotion exists. Perhaps it means that there’s hope for us humans, too.’
He let Harry's cock pop out of his mouth, removed his fingers from Harry's arse, and lay his head down on Harry's hip.
Admittedly, Astoria made good points … But one conversation wasn’t likely to overturn years of conditioning in an instant. He’d have to … think on it. “Okay. I’ll … I’ll keep this in mind.”
‘Yes, Lila?’ He didn’t buy-in to the whole “call your students by their last names” rubbish. He preferred they call him by his first name, and vice versa. (Though many of them still called him “sir”, out of habit with the other teachers.) First names just seemed more conducive to learning, in his opinion and experience. They needed to be able to speak to one another as people, with none of that “respect me or else” attitude that professors like Snape had favoured. Respect is
Harry’s heartrate sped up, which was not the best time to have it do so—right when Draco was entering into Harry’s space and wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders.
“And most of all,” Draco continued, sobered by Harry’s expression. “You saved me because you defeated
Harry stared at the page; he hadn’t been terribly eloquent. As per usual. Was that all he had to say? Was that all Malfoy had to say? Had that been enough?
Malfoy held up his palm to stop Harry from talking, which was probably a good thing because Harry didn’t know what he was going to blurt out next. Then, Malfoy tied up the letters with the twine, and slid them towards Harry. “You can have them,” he said flatly. “You may want to run diagnostic spells before you open them. And if you burn them, I’d advise burning outside.” He nodded towards the edge of his desk—which Harry saw now was rather scorched. “Some of the spells interact with Incendio.”
He swallowed, thinking he knew what she was getting at. “Er, a poem about …" He could hardly bring himself to say it. That blasted name—the bane of his existence, the man … “A poem about … Harry Potter?” He nearly whispered the name.
She frowned, opening her eyes—finally—to looked them both up and down appraisingly. “Come to chat, have we? I was
Astoria came back in the room, her face lit up with happiness, with tears shining in her eyes. She clung on to the doorframe. “Oh, Draco. Someone actually bought it for us! I didn’t think anyone would … I just saw it at the shop and fell in love with it. I added it last minute—I figured: who knows? Maybe we have a wealthy cousin or something. And, look, we do! We must!”
“Well,” the girl started, tentatively. “There is one thing left.” She was at the bottom of the list, now. “It’s a display cabinet, for £1099.”
Harry approached the table, and sat down beside Ron and across from Hermione and Ginny. 'Morning,' he said brightly.
Harry locked eyes with Ron and shrugged. Ron nodded with a smile, like he was saying: go on then. And he turned away to say something to Hermione.
A new song number started about girls who are worth fighting for. Draco presumed Potter knew a thing about that.
Harry rose to his feet too, without knowing what to say. Just knowing that this was so off the rails and uncalled for—
, and Frederick is a meek little thing. This whole situation is affecting the entire team’s performance. You should’ve seen Frederick at the last practice—he tripped over himself, just walking onto the pitch! He’s a bloody
Harry grinned, and pulled himself out of bed, padding over to the washroom in only dark green boxer briefs.
Draco licked at his bottom lip, then bit at it. ‘I thought you knew how I felt about you … the things I wrote in the journal. That sodding fantasy scenario …'
She smiled at him. 'We've only been using it a few thousand years.' She rolled her eyes in a friendly, mocking way.
Draco rolled onto his side to face her, finding her already facing him on her pillow, smiling back at him—looking relaxed, looking satisfied. Draco couldn't help but smile back.
A knock on Draco's front door interrupted them from taking their snog further. They broke away from one another—and Draco looked as startled as Harry felt.
“I...” Guess so? He didn’t quite know how to answer that. Sure, they’d had a couple conversations—ones that hadn’t ended
Just … what did that mean for Harry, that it still stung a bit? Merlin … did it mean that Harry fancied Draco Malfoy? Well that was … that was not something he needed to figure out now.
“I love you, too ..." He should ask. Straight-out. "Do you—do you want to, though? Have sex with other people?”
The sun had only just begun to rise, casting the room in pale grey light. Draco squinted his eyes open. Everything was silent—save the soft inhales and exhales of his roommate. His mouth tasted something awful, it was dry as sand, and he could use a piss, so he rolled out of bed and stumbled into the washroom. After relieving himself, one glance in the mirror made him groan—his hair in disarray, and skin seemingly paler than usual.
Harry choked out a laugh. ‘Bloody obviously.’ He sniffed. ‘You are so, so thoughtful. So unbelievably thoughtful, I …' Fuck, he didn’t even know what to say. So, he didn’t say anything. Instead, he kissed him.
‘Did you ever figure out who sent you those things?’ Hermione asked, before taking a sip of wine, and peering at him over the rim of the glass.
Malfoy strode over, and took it out of his hands, giving it a closer look. “Thank you,” he said, rather neutrally, and moved to place it on the windowsill. Malfoy paused to look at it for a quick moment, and then turned around to go back into his bedroom.
It still felt a bit uncertain, like Malfoy was going to tell him he’d changed his mind at any moment. To go back to thinking this was all a mistake, to say that they’d never be able to make it work.
Pansy broke away, and awkwardly mumbled a, ‘Well then,’ before nodding sharply just the once, and hurrying off back to the Hufflepuff table. Her friend grinned at her, following Pansy’s hasty retreat—while looking very proud.
Harry made to go back to the Tower, then ducked into an alcove to throw on his Invisibility cloak. Mental that he had to go through all this, just to talk to Malfoy.
And, in the morning, when Astoria was in the shower and Draco was still lying in bed, he took the note out again. It was a little rumpled now, so he smoothed it out, and read it again.
Harry licked his bottom lip. “I know. I know he’s got a wife.” Harry didn’t … he didn’t … Well, he didn’t quite know how to articulate his thoughts or feelings on the matter anyway. He liked Draco, yes. Draco was incontrovertibly fit, yes. It didn’t mean he was going to fall in love and get his heart broken. “I’m careful, okay? I’ll be careful. I’m not going to just go and … fall in love with him. We’re just friends.”
'Draco, dance with me,' half-yelled Dave, taking Draco's shot glass out of his hand and setting it on the bar. He grabbed for Draco's hand, and led him off onto to the dancefloor. Draco allowed himself to be pulled, exchanging an amused glance with Harry.
Neville asked, “What do you think of that funny ball, though? It’d said ‘children’ in my own voice.”
Harry shut the journal, feeling conflicted. He was satisfied, beyond satisfied. They’d … shared something there. A sexual experience. Sure, they’d had one before. But this time they
These were all the “right” things to say. The polite things. Harry wasn’t sure Malfoy meant it. He had no idea how Malfoy
Draco shrugged his shoulders—just once, and kept looking down at his hand on the blanket. ‘They weren’t talking to you much this year, right? Ignoring you? But now you’ve gotten their attention again, and you seem quite happy about that—it looked so normal. It just makes sense that everything would go back to the way it used to be.’
“Why are you single? Why aren’t you married to Ginevra Weasley, or someone like her, and have three charming biracial, wild-haired and freckled children by now?”
But it felt amazing. A warm body next to him—rising and falling with breaths. And Malfoy was a nice size for him—not too tall. He fit nicely under Harry’s arm. It’d be a bit better if Malfoy relaxed into it though.
And after an exceptionally dull meeting, in which they determined that the organisation was doing well, Draco wandered into his office and sank down into his chair.
'This is lovely,' said Mrs Creevey, taking a sweeping look around the room. 'Colin would be so pleased to see this, to see all these people coming together for him. For photography.'
Harry considered that. Yeah, they were just little things, in ceramic pots that would fit in the palm of your hand. 'Do they count as flowers?' he asked, not really caring about the answer.
Draco barely registered class ending, until everyone was filing out. Draco joined the crowd, like a sheep, or an
“Oh.” Breakfast. Sure. Snogging wasn’t the most important thing in the world, then. Regretfully eating once and a while was necessary... to stay alive and all that. “Right. Okay.”
Malfoy didn’t look up; he licked his index finger and flipped the page. ‘The last time I was on a broom, I was on the back of yours.’
He nodded, and lifted a pant leg. Both Astoria and Draco tilted their heads down and looked. Yes, he was wearing the naked Santa ones. Ridiculous.
Draco bit his lip, and shuffled the bottle and his cup into one arm, taking his wand out of his pocket. He cast the warming charm over both of them. Draco’s magic felt sky blue and a bit fizzy as it enveloped him in its heat. Harry liked it.
‘No,’ he finally said, in answer to Malfoy’s question—he wasn’t done. Stalling, he asked again, ‘Are you really alright?’
Running off and pretending it was nothing would be easy. But did Draco want to be that person? Still? That person who guards his heart, who runs away the moment he’s truly vulnerable? No... he was beginning to realise. He didn’t want to hide away anymore.
'Thank you for telling me.' Still with that same enigmatic smile … Harry couldn't tell what she was thinking.
‘I don’t.’ Harry was getting weary of this, and he’d been wanting to sneak off to the kitchens for a tea and a slice of treacle tart. ‘You’re all far too invested in this. There’s no story here. It’s just a fan, nothing more.’
‘Hey,’ Harry said, catching Draco’s arm. ‘We don’t have to if you’re nervous or anything. We can do something else, save this for another time.’ He’d noticed by now that Draco starts babbling when he gets nervous or uncomfortable.
“Ah,” Astoria said, reaching for his hand with her free one, in order to squeeze it. “And what makes you think that?”
‘Oh lord, no,’ Blaise said. ‘I always find it’s best to stay out of the drama. Zabinis don’t pick sides, that’s how we survive. Look at me.’ He gestured to himself, grinning. ‘I am unscathed.’
Their date had ended well, at least. Was a bit rough around the middle, but turned out pretty good, he figured. Harry would count it as a success.
Draco swiped a hand through his short hair. ‘Alright. Stay here until I’m off. Then, I’ll take you to my place.’
The sharp light caused all the various leafy plants around the room to appear like emerald glass, but also caused a terrible glare on the laptop. Pansy adjusted the “brightness” on the thing, tilted the screen a bit, and miraculously a clearer picture of the video menu appeared.
Sorry? Harry opened his mouth to say something, then closed it. He took a long swig of maroon. The alcohol in it was starting to warm his insides.
“Fuck,” Draco breathed, when arrows started raining down. It was all looking pretty hopeless for Mulan.
Potter turned his head, and Draco followed where he was looking. It was Ronald Weasley... The man was shooting significant looks at Potter.
“Okay class, here are your updated itineraries and info packs. Line up at the counter and get your keys, then settle yourselves in your rooms. We’ll meet at 12:30pm down here in the dining room for lunch,” said Professor Flitwick, handing out folders.
Angelpreet walked behind the computer stations, checking that everyone had their browsers up. 'All right. Now I want you to type into the bar at the very top: facebook dot com. Then press the enter button on your keyboard.'
himself, Harry took off his jacket and hung it up on a hook on the wall, remembering belatedly that he’d decided on the sodding dog jumper. So, he and Draco matched, then. Brilliant.
Harry sank to the floor, mirroring Neville from the opposite side of the hall. He didn’t know much about these matters ... he hadn’t been in a real relationship with anybody since Ginny. But, he’d always thought communication was most important in the end. The truth comes out eventually, whether you want it to or not, didn’t it? “You’ve got to talk about it though, right? At least, sometime. Eventually.”
‘Hello,’ Harry answered distractedly. He watched as Draco glanced over, eyed him and Ginny and promptly looked away, all while frowning. His mouth moved, and Charlotte turned slightly, pausing only when Draco said something with force.
“Come on, let’s sit down,” Harry said hastily, and chose a seat near the back, out of Lucius’ line of sight.
Potter looked... amused. His eyes crinkled and the edge of his mouth curled upwards. He almost looked... fond. But that wasn’t possible because, well, their history.
Draco turned to Harry, saw him looking down at his scars. He didn’t seem repulsed, just... straight-faced and a bit sad. “It’s dulled a bit, like feeling something through a callous.”
'Yeah, all right.' Harry lifted his mobile up so he could see it properly, and tapped the buttons several times. 'Just sending him a text,' he explained.
Harry exhaled slow. ‘What can you do about it now?’ he asked softly, and felt a lot like Moira asking it.
Draco knocked back his drink, and immediately poured another. Blaise and Pansy’s cups went forgotten.
Harry averted his eyes, looking down at the red wine in his hand. “I like him,” he said quietly. He was
He closed the door after them, and then looked at the pink envelope in his hand. He brought it into the living room, where Astoria was, sitting up now.
She smiled. “Then that’s enough. I’m actually very happy, don’t you know? I married the man I love.”
Harry deflated. “Oh, well … I was just going to ask if he wanted—uh, if you both wanted to come to a New Year’s Eve party. Neville Longbottom is hosting it. It’ll be on a roof. We can look at the sky …"
Harry snorted, despite his obvious self-consciousness. 'The internet. Looked it up a bit this morning. Should've printed it out, really. But there you are.'
Harry sighed and rubbed at his temple. ‘It had another silly cryptic note, this time taped on the front.’
Harry remembered what he and Moira had talked about that morning, about keeping Malfoy at a distance. He didn’t want that, not anymore. He was sure of that much, at least.
Draco sighed. Well … it had to end sometime. He handed the note over to Harry, just as the lift doors opened up onto his floor.
That was the one question he couldn’t answer right then and there. It would upset Potter to hear. It would upset Draco to say, come to think of it. “If you still want to know tomorrow... I’ll tell you tomorrow.”
‘I was thinking of, perhaps, covering it up with another tattoo. But I know that I deserve the Mark,’ he rushed to add. ‘I deserve to live with my choices, so I should keep it. As punishment. As reminder of all the evil I’ve done, the evil I am …’ He grimaced, and ran both hands through his hair. ‘I should keep it, shouldn’t I?’
It was cold out—and a sharp winter wind tunnelled through the streets. He shoved his gloved hands deep into the pockets of his coat, and allowed himself to think of Ginny, again, as he walked. The cold air helped him feel more clear-headed. The thought struck him that there was a chance ... a chance this could be their last Christmas together as a couple. And … maybe that was okay.
One of Malfoy’s hands broke away from his mug and reached for Harry’s. That soft hand carried with it some of the tea’s heat, as it inserted gently into Harry’s palm. Malfoy tugged slightly towards himself, as a subtle hint to lean in further. So, Harry did, and Malfoy closed the space between their mouths.
Draco was already there, with his back to Harry, leaning up against the railing. Looking out over at the grounds below. The moon was in waxing gibbous, high in the sky, casting the right side of Draco’s body in a soft light. He wore something dark, but the lower half of his legs were bare, save for some thick, woolly socks.
Draco typed in the password (Angelpreet said you should always use a password, even if you live alone and your computer doesn't go anywhere.)
Harry took the clothes and looked at them. Green tartan bottoms, and an old grey t-shirt—its surface pebbled with age, and buttery-soft—and it had the Bulgarian National Quidditch team logo on the front. ‘How long have you had this shirt?’
He brought the four jumpers up to the salesgirl at the cash. She smiled at his choices, and rung him up. The total price of everything, with the cabinet, was a bit mad.
Potter reached for Draco’s hand—the one full of pebbles. The pebbles poured out onto Draco’s leg and tumbled back onto the ground as Potter laced his fingers in Draco’s.
She sighed again, in a very exaggerated and over-dramatic way while muttering words under her breath, and left Draco’s dorm. Finally.
Potter stopped when he was at the back of the chair opposite Draco, and pulled out a finger to point right at Draco’s head.
Harry paused when he realised Draco wasn't moving yet. 'Oh. Should I go slower? Or, did you not mean to take everything off?' Shit, he was probably being too hasty, when he'd already promised they could go slow.
This was … lovely. Harry couldn’t think of a better way to spend to self-isolation. So, he said, ‘Well that’s one way to spend quarantine.’ He shut his eyes, and smiled.
And despite losing so many people in the war. People Potter had loved. Like Professor Lupin and his wife. Dumbledore. One of the Weasley twins. And Draco’s own relative—Sirius Black.
Draco laughed, feeling a shiver travel up his spine from Harry's breath on his ear. He took a sip, and yeah, Harry was right. It was fruity, and not too sweet. Didn't taste boozy at all.
Draco watched Potter ramble on, as he felt his own eyebrow go higher and higher. Potter clamped his mouth shut, and returned to cutting at his Scotch pancake.
Harry picked himself off the floor, picked up the envelope, and tossed it into his sticky desk drawer. He tried slamming the drawer closed, but it went in all crooked. Whatever. He didn’t care. Harry just knew that he never wanted to have to look at that ring again.
Malfoy walked right up to the lake’s edge, and bent to pick up some smooth, flat stones. He looked out at the water for a moment, contemplating it, turning the stones over in his palm—making little click-clack sounds with them. Harry felt a bit breathless, a few paces away, watching him.
Harry's arms loosened on Draco, as Harry drew back to face him. His eyelids were heavy, but he opened them slowly, revealing dilated pupils. And Draco forgot to breathe.
Draco sighed, slumping down against the bench. ‘Try to tell my father we aren’t …,' he muttered, rubbing his palms against his thighs.
‘Sorry,’ Harry breathed out. This all seemed mad, but … it wasn’t Draco’s fault. This was his life, a life very different from Harry’s, that he didn’t really understand. ‘I know I don’t have any idea of what it’s like …'
Harry sighed. He flipped through the pages again, absentmindedly. Glossed over things again. Reminded himself what they talked about. Reminded himself what Malfoy was allegedly like.
Harry frowned, and Draco removed his hand from Harry’s shoulder. It found Harry’s, on the bedspread, and squeezed—just once. Harry squeezed back, and tried to hold on to it, as Draco pulled away. But Harry wasn’t successful, and Draco stood up. The mattress lost its dip from Draco’s weight.
Now adequately rinsed, Harry wiped the water droplets from his face, and took a step closer to Draco. ‘I’m ready now.’
What—come back once a year in the summer for another few days of inserting himself into Harry's life?
Draco stepped inside, toeing off his shoes and bringing over a box of something that already smelled delicious.
He shook his head, glaring at her. She had chosen a very inopportune time to tell him this important bit of information—while surrounded by people, waiting for the Portkeys to take them away to their ‘field trip’. He couldn’t exactly scream at her to keep her pug nose out of his affairs, not in front of everyone.
“I agree that they’re an awful lot like your old valentine. I’d always figured Ginny had sent that too,” Hermione commented, tapping her chin. “Hmm. Do you remember its exact words?”
The book was titled “The Prophet” by Kahlil Gibran. The typical scrap of parchment was tucked into the book this time, like a bookmark.
But Harry pulled, and produced half a seatbelt. He nodded at Draco towards the space by Dimitri’s arse.
Neville frowned down at her, still clutching the object in his hand. “I think I did miss something.”
“Maybe it is now, but for how long? It’s not like everyone who’s ever sent me a mean letter will get life in Azkaban. They’ll be back. And they’ll be angry I tried to stop them.”
And Malfoy’s lips were impossibly soft. Just ... just applying a steady pressure against him. His breaths came out in a steady rhythm against Harry’s cheek. Harry’s breaths, on the other hand, were probably more erratic, but he wasn’t concentrating on that right then. His mind was screaming:
Covering his mouth as to suppress a snort, Harry took out a piece of parchment so that he could pen a reply.
Harry broke off from the kiss, only to look down at what his hand was going to do. Draco followed suit—he wanted to see Harry’s hand on his cock. Wanted to watch.
Blaise stretched his long legs out, and clapped Draco on the back. “Pansy, dear, Draco is 18 years old, he can run his own schemes.”
As they were exiting the stairs from the Headmistress’s office, Harry swung his rucksack over one shoulder, and bumped into Draco on purpose, lightly. ‘So. Will you knit me one of your blankets? It’s always freezing at my house.’
Harry froze. He’d actually said that out loud. Oh, Merlin … So Harry opened his mouth to try to explain, and blurted out: “I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It just keeps playing over and over in my head. And … I dunno, I just keep looking at you. I’m sorry. You’re right, I’m being weird.”
Eventually, the letters stopped. And Harry had never seen or heard from the man again. (Until … this year?)
And the year went on, and they talked about issues as they came up. They collaborated and communicated, and
She grinned, flashing all of her white teeth. “Of course. Let’s see … how about: Dear,” she faltered. “Um, what were their names, again?”
“Alright. Maybe you like him, then. So, why the pacing? Why this whole—” She waved her hand around his face. “—display of dramatics?”
Draco shrugged half-heartedly, stirring up the water a little. ‘Perhaps we reincarnate, and the souls with magic are the oldest—because we’ve learnt it along the way. Over several lifetimes. But then you’d think Wizards would be more peaceful, wouldn’t you? Wiser, somehow. But we aren’t. Not really.’
Ginny watched him move through the room with the same frown, and sighed. She finally moved to sit on the other end of the couch and turn her body to face him. ‘I didn’t want to
find myself for a little while. So I left Barcelona because I didn’t want them to be able to find me again, and I ended up here.’
He shrugged again, and squinted out at the crowd. Sort of near the back there, he supposed. Draco pointed.
‘That’s all we can do, right? Just learn from mistakes, make amends if possible, try to forgive ourselves, and try to do better next time.’ He exhaled slow. ‘But I sincerely,
Draco made a little huff, and Harry couldn't tell if it was amusement or not. Draco placed Harry's letter down on the table and turned to him. 'Yours is nice.'
Harry turned to him, on the edge of the dancefloor, and a bit removed from the other dance partners. He went ahead and placed one hand on Draco’s shoulder, and took Draco’s hand with the other.
And maybe he wouldn’t even see Potter down there. Maybe Potter would cancel his music thing, maybe he’d have a cold.
Draco didn't know what to say next, because this almost felt like another confession—and they'd moved passed that. So, he cleared his throat and changed the subject, 'Where are you taking me today?'
, least of all Potter, see him in a bathing suit. Not that he’d brought one, anyhow. “I don’t have a suit.”
It smelled lovely. Earthy, fresh, a hint of almond. It smelled like home. Which, in itself, had always been a spotty concept for Harry at best. But he’d had glimpses of it, of “home”. Sitting at the kitchen table at Grimmauld Place with Sirius, or in front of the fireplace at the Burrow. Or sat in his favourite stuffed chair in the Gryffindor common room. Yes, the tea was a bit like those things.
Harry made eye contact with Draco, and Draco smiled to tell him it was all right. He was feeling fucking fantastic, and he didn't want to lose that.
Pansy flashed all her teeth with a grin, and struggled to push herself up off the log. Draco tried to help steady her, and eventually she got it.
It was Harry's turn again. He received a pair of fuzzy yellow socks. Harry put them on immediately, and they nearly reached up to his knees. 'Thank you. I love them so much.'
. It’d been such a long while since Harry had enjoyed a good kiss … and this was likely the best he’d ever had.
“They may have a new leader.” She looked at him as if he were stupid, and that his stupidity pissed her off. “
He thought back to when Harry'd said that he was a bit upset with Britney, and he'd never got the reason why.
He knew it, and couldn’t stop it for too long. His eyes just kept finding him. As he wondered … just wondered.
“Yes,” Draco answered matter-of-factly. Courtesy of how much alcohol he’d drank, most likely. He wasn’t Pansy-level drunk, of course. But his tongue was certainly loosened. He’d probably answer any question Potter asked.
Harry looked up to find Draco watching, and a smile grew on his face. “I think we missed most of the film.”
‘Alright,’ Draco replied breathily. He removed his fingers slowly, then, positioned his own cock to be right underneath Harry’s arsehole. ‘Just, sit down slowly. Try to keep your arse relaxed.’
Malfoy’s expression sobered slightly. “And I’m trying what we agreed upon—I'm trying not to fuck it up.”
’? A tiny smile was forming on Harry’s lips. Draco suppressed a groan, because Harry was cute and Draco had to admit... had to admit that them rooming together had likely been the catalyst that brought about... well, whatever their relationship was. He turned towards Pansy. “Alright. I’ll admit that—in the end—the whole room-switch scheme did turn out—” He paused to sigh. “—Turned out favourably. For all parties.”
Draco brushed his teeth and washed his face in the bathroom. When he came out, he eyed Harry there, still fast asleep. Peaceful—with mouth slightly open, and face relaxed.
‘Right.’ Malfoy picked up the glass, held it up to the sunlight to squint at it, and then, finally, he brought it to his lips.
Draco sipped his tea and peered over his newspaper, across their tiny flat living room, at his wife. The sight warmed him, filled him with affection. There she was, in her flannel pyjamas, draped over the sofa with massive bedhead. Merlin, she was cute.
. “Draco was there,” he added, forcibly casually, though finding himself unable to meet anyone's eye.
Harry allowed it, of course, for a moment. And then pulled away again. “Let’s do this—” He kissed Malfoy once more. “—back in one of our rooms.”
The corner of Draco's mouth quirked up, and his eyes were just so … so affectionate. Harry almost wanted to look away, like they were too bright.
Draco closed the door behind them, locked it, and turned to Harry, with bright eyes and slightly-parted lips. He still had one of Harry’s hands in his. He brought the other one up near Harry’s cheek, but he hesitated, and gave a little shake to his head. ‘No, not standing,’ he murmured.
Potter sighed. “I slept in a cupboard, got locked in it sometimes for punishments.” He shrugged. “I cooked meals for them. I didn’t get any presents at birthdays and Christmas. That sort of stuff.” He laughed a bit to himself. “It seems stupid to complain about, I know. Not getting a proper bed or presents. It’s not important, really.”
“Well, you might have a point.” She turned to him, and looked him up and down, sizing him up. “So, what are you out here for, then?”
to think of him. Still, though, sometimes he had. He’d wondered about the man—wondered what he was doing. If he was okay. ‘Any idea on what became of him?’
The day came to an end again, with no reply in the journal, and with Harry racking his memory to try to figure out what he’d done. He sat on his bed with the journal open in his lap.
He let go of her arm, and watched, helplessly, as she prowled over to Harry Potter. She took him by the hand and led him away, and... Potter just let her. Draco stared at their joined hands in awe—as if it were simple to just... hold Potter’s hand like that.
‘They’re friendly snakes. Non-venomous. I’m still a Slytherin, so it seemed fitting.’ He took a deep breath. ‘And, besides, snakes symbolise rebirth … because they periodically shed their skin.’
So Harry went to the kitchen to get three wine glasses out, and to pop a bottle open. Harry and Hermione trailed in after him.
Draco magicked his bed over to the side—as much as he could (which wasn’t altogether that much). Harry tried to transfigure his empty mango drink bottle into a mattress, but he wasn’t getting the sizing right … either too small to fit his body size, or too big to fit the small space. The more Harry tried, the lumpier the mattress seemed to get.
‘All right,’ Harry answered. He let go of them and circled around to the other side of the table, setting his bag down and sitting with a heavy sigh.
But he was different, wasn’t he? He’d lived a vastly different life. Not everyone was wired the way he was.
‘Good night,’ Harry said, turning onto his side to face Draco’s profile—feeling fond and tired and maybe other things too. And Draco looked beautiful, there, a bit stiff with the covers pulled up to his chest, with his head making a dip in the pillow, with the outline of his face—the angle of his forehead, brow, nose, slightly parted lips, and chin.
‘I should say …’ Draco began, before pausing to lick at his bottom lip. ‘Well, no. I’ll ask … what exactly do you want? Out of this?’
'As many of you know, Colin Creevey was tragically killed in the second Wizarding War, at the age of sixteen,' Draco said as he solemnly observed the crowd from the podium. Many of the war veterans bowed their head in respect. 'He did something that is far from easy to do—take a stand for what is right, in the face of terrible danger and risk. He was the very embodiment of what it means to be Gryffindor—brave, chivalrous, noble. But, all the same, he was just a child, and no child should have to be in the centre of a war.'
Then they stood up. Harry cleared his throat, and grabbed their paper bag of leftovers, and made for the exit.
Harry watched Malfoy throw back that shot of pink liquid into that stupid mouth. Watched his stupid face scrunch up in a grimace.
Draco nibbled his, watching Potter and his ridiculous technique. Draco’s marshmallow was perfect, thank-you-very-much.
She opened the door of her cottage with a smile. Evidently not surprised at all to see him. ‘Hello, Harry.’
Harry had had enough. He opened his office door as wide as it went, silently beckoning her to leave. “While I seriously doubt that, I’m sure it’s all a matter for the Aurors, isn’t it? Besides, Malfoy is a professor here, and has done nothing to indicate—”
‘I don’t have to do much, lately,’ Draco admitted. ‘We’re going paperless. The foundations are doing well, and I have teams in place for marketing, for fundraisers, for all the stuff on the ground. I just try to keep it all moving in the right direction.’
“I do want you. I want you so much it hurts sometimes. So much that it scares me … and I know I’ll just fuck it up, because that’s what I do. That’s what I do with everything I truly want. But I don’t want to … I don’t
‘A drawer?’ Harry echoed, moving to open it. Sure enough, it had paper packets of salt and pepper, along with soy sauce and mustard. ‘Draco … this doesn’t count.’
Merlin. Malfoy’s office was barren. Not that Harry’s was anything special—but at least he had knick-knacks and photographs and an area rug. Malfoy had hardly anything. A desk. A chair. A bookshelf.
Draco babbled on about his favourite book series, and Harry tried to keep up. He gathered it was some kind of fiction/fantasy about someone who makes mountains? And has an enemy called Midnight who goes around eating said mountains? Then they talked of television (which Draco had never seen), and, before long, the sun had disappeared from the sky, and above them instead was a canopy of navy blue and a sprinkling of stars.
Malfoy pinched his mouth small, furrowing his brows a bit. “Because I like you. Hadn’t we already established that?”
, Draco.‘ She sighed, and set the thing down on the table beside his drink. The smile returned—a dangerous smile, Draco noted. ‘Okay, this is
Potter let go of his hand, and looked at him with those big eyes—eyes that Draco knew were so green, but he couldn’t quite make out their colour now. ‘Where’s your constellation?’
It was the same receptionist, Brenda, a middle-aged woman with red lipstick and a mop of dark purple hair. She beamed at them. ‘Welcome back, Harry. Nice to see you again, Draco.’
‘Oh,’ Malfoy said suddenly, glancing over his shoulder at the cupboards. ‘I might have some biscuits somewhere.’
“Me neither,” answered Theo, shooting Draco an inquisitive look. “But if you’re scared, you can sleep in my bed. I’ll keep you safe.” He winked.
Chuckling, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and kissed him. That… made Draco feel slightly better.
Draco Malfoy was sat with the First Year Hufflepuff again. The sticker girl. He had his hands in her hair, folding those thick black strands into a French braid.
He felt eyes on him. Draco looked to his right, and found a handsome blond bloke checking out his cock—openly.
Malfoy’s gaze dropped down to his own feet, as he shrugged. ‘Well, I’ve made myself an enemy of the Dark Lord. I’m told I can either go be with my parents in France, or, I can stay here. I decided to stay here. At Hogwarts.’
strange. ‘I don’t think so. Now, I’m going to finish handing these back, and then we’re going to practice Protego.’
He thought about how he used to attend Ginny’s matches, how he’d dress head-to-toe in her team colours, and try to cheer the loudest. She’d always find him in the crowd, and blow a kiss at him.
Draco was getting a good buzz on by this point. He should probably slow down, but then there was a fresh wine glass set in front of him.
“Me neither,” Draco admitted, and began to tentatively stroke, touching Harry like he’d touch himself. The skin was so soft. Softness over hardness.
Oh Salazar fucking Slytherin. “Well—in the same room! With me,” he managed to choke out. Harry had tilted his sleepy face up towards Draco, his expression soft and slack, and every part of him was just so bloody
“Will we?” It certainly felt impossible—no one seemed to recognise the hand-writing, or know anything about the sender.
There was an unusual amount of giggling at the Slytherin table during breakfast the next morning. Draco tried to ignore it, but, it sort of depressed him. He wished he could be like that,
It was the sort of light that made you squint when you looked right into it, and cast sharp shadows on the books that weren’t in its path.
He glanced at himself in the mirror. He looked a bit better today—more rested, more relaxed. And the outfit was pretty good. Merlin—he still couldn’t believe Pansy had gotten him to wear some of Potter’s clothes. It almost seemed... too intimate a thing. Didn’t Potter realise that at all? Of course not. He was straight. It was just like doing a mate a favour, when they had nothing else to wear. Not that Draco thought they were really mates, just, approximations of friends, perhaps. Acquaintances who no longer fought like cats and dogs—
Potter sat up, and his covers dropped to his waist, revealing expanses of well-muscled naked chest. Draco kept his eyes carefully levelled on Potter’s face. “There’s something else.”
Harry snorted, watching his cup fill up. He should be offended, shouldn’t he? Somehow, Draco just didn’t get under his skin like he used to. “Do
'Mm.' Draco inserted a bare knitting needle into one of the stitches on the scarf-like strip. 'What do you normally do for Christmas?'
‘So,’ said Neville, leaning forward and fixing Harry with a significant look. ‘You like Draco, then?’
‘And there’re drinks and a bit of food in the mini fridge,’ Draco said, nodding toward a small black object on the other end of the room. ‘Help yourself.’
'Morning,' Draco said, trying to keep from smiling at the sight of him. He crouched down to pack his spare shoes into his bag.
Draco slipped his soft fingers back into Harry’s hand. Harry accepted them, without comment, but inside his heart was hammering, and he was feeling a bit … floaty.
Harry turned to look over his shoulder, into the open doorway of the bathroom. Malfoy stood there, becoming decidedly pink.
A lump formed in Harry’s throat, and he rapidly blinked his stinging eyes to keep them from watering.
Harry sat at the old wood table there, with his head down on his folded arms, staring at the steaming mug.
Draco took a deep breath, and ran his fingers through his hair. He smiled up at Astoria. “He didn’t write this.”
That earned a snort out of Potter, and Draco laughed a little too; it was still a bit ridiculous, after all this time.
the war? How had Draco felt at his trial, how had he felt when Harry rejected his handshake? How had he felt when his letters came back, unopened?
Harry watched the movement, and took it as a sign that he could talk. “I’m sorry,” he said. “About everything—”
He led them to the public bathroom, before dropping Draco’s arm. Draco followed Potter inside, rubbing at his Dark Mark through his shirtsleeve.
It felt weird to walk with only one sock on, but… it was okay, he supposed. Since Harry was with him.
With everyone down in the Great Hall for dinner, Gryffindor tower was eerily quiet. There was a stillness in the air, as if the entire Castle were empty.
Harry's eyes had widened a bit, his eyebrows lifting up. He gave a little shake to his head and laughed. 'Not really, no.'
Harry took a deep breath. “Okay, now we’ve established the ‘no falling in love with Draco Malfoy’ rule. How was your Christmas?”
‘Plus if it were genetic, we wouldn’t have Muggleborns, right? Or Squibs born to two Purebloods. But it does happen.’ Draco puffed out his cheeks, as he thought. ‘Or, perhaps, could it be that we can tap into something that Muggles can’t? Some force, or some source? And if such a thing exists—is it external or internal? Tangible or intangible? Deep within the earth, or on it? Or is it on a different plane of reality altogether? But why can we tap into it, and Muggles can’t?’
He chuckled to himself, and continued, thinking about what he’d say to himself, imagining he were somebody else writing him a love letter.
A soft breeze tickled his face, and his eye caught a glint of light in his peripheral. He turned, to find Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott, and Draco Malfoy making their way onto the grass, with brooms slung over their shoulders.
Harry swiped a hand through his own hair. “You know you sent me a poem that started with ‘How do I love thee’, right?”
She blinked at him a beat. 'Have a seat,' she said, gesturing towards a section of vacant computer stations.
Harry shrugged. ‘For the reasons I just said. And, I think someone should’ve helped you in school. Dumbledore, McGonagall, Lupin, or me, even. No one gave you a proper choice—proper guidance from an adult who knew better. And ... I guess I also forgive you just because I want to.’
He’d put the confusing images of Draco Malfoy, soft and “stickered”, out of his mind, he’d even put those fleeting ones about Pansy Parkinson out too. Harry was just going to relax, take it easy. Going to try and enjoy himself and not think too much about anything, anything at all.
‘Ow! What the fuck, Malfoy?’ Harry snarled, rubbing at the rapidly swelling sore on his leg with his free hand, the one that wasn’t holding on to the (now yelping) Gryffindor boy.
Merlin, she could put up an argument. And, against all better judgment, Draco found himself saying, “Fine.”
The other members of the family crowded Ron, giving him hugs, offering him soft words of comfort. Saying it’ll be alright, that Hermione was strong … that she and baby would be just fine.
Dancing shifted from that light-hearted waltz, to something more akin to what the other people were doing all around them.
‘Oh, Harry,’ she exhaled, leaning back in her chair. ‘You’ve always been … well, a bit weird about him. So. What’s happened, then?’
Suppressing a heavy exhale, he asked, 'Yes?' He waited for her to tell him something horrible—like she'd invited Harry Potter to marry him, or something similar.
‘Back at school, I think I had the sense that you weren’t allowed to be yourself, or figure out how you felt about anything, on your own terms. It seemed like you had everything dictated to you, every opinion forced upon you … that you might not’ve known yourself either, like I didn’t.’
Facing the direction of the wall that Potter was just metres behind, he leaned a hand on the slippery tile for support and began stroking, savouring the feeling of his wet hand on himself. Savouring in the knowledge that Potter was there, on the other side of that wall. He gave a squeeze to the head.
'I'll have to check out soon,' Draco said, regrettably. He wished they'd been a bit earlier so they could’ve gotten breakfast together again.
Every wall Draco possessed—he was now putting them up. Bricks, and drawbridges, and metal bars. No, no, no.
‘I admit … I never would’ve pegged Malfoy for a knitter. It sounds like … sounds like an all right weekend.’
He watched Harry gracefully glide into shore, swimming without kicking up a splash. When he got close enough to the sand, Harry stood, with water droplets dripping down his hair, neck, and back.
‘Do you want to fly?’ he blurted out, not knowing where that thought came from. But … now that he mentioned it, it would be more fun than doing an assignment a week early. ‘We could play a Seeker’s game. When was the last time you flew?’
She licked her lips, and shot him a determined glare. “Draco Lucius Malfoy. Everyone here is making an effort to get along. Look at Blaise and Weasley over there. Look at Potter... He’s been nice to you, hasn’t he? Has anyone given you a hard time at all this trip—anyone attacked you? No, right? Now what makes you think any of that would change, just because it’s at a party? Besides, if someone does start something, Blaise and I will be there. You won’t be alone. We’ve always got your back, okay?” She didn’t give him a chance to answer all of her questions, but... she might have a point. Loath as he was to admit it.
Harry busied himself with making a cup, with milk and sugar like Draco liked it. He brought it over to him, set it on the table, then turned back to work on the eggs.
“Mm,” Harry said, capturing Draco’s mouth in his, as his hand stroked. He broke away to murmur against Draco’s lips, “You’re so bloody sexy.”
She barked a laugh, and let him into the sun room again. The laptop was sitting where he’d last seen it.
Potter leaned in closer to his ear, asking loud enough to be heard over the music, ‘You know this song?’
But when Harry pulled back, gripping onto Draco's upper arms, he had a soft smile on his face. 'Is it almost time?'
It was a fervent thing, all strong grasping hands and lips pressed hard against lips. Harry exhaled hard through his nose, pulling at Draco’s pajama collar and edging closer—onto Draco’s lap. And Draco was wedging Harry’s lips open with his lips, which Harry was only too happy to allow. Draco’s soft, wet tongue slipped into Harry’s mouth, as he pulled on the back of Harry’s neck—trying to get closer, though closer was impossible without melting into a complete synthesis.
his come), and a mind full of the way Draco looked as he orgasmed, Harry was not going to last long.
So, in a spur of the moment decision, he turned on the shower and climbed in. The hot water began to relax his stiff muscles, and make him feel loads better. Almost like he could wash away some of the poison he’d voluntarily ingested the night before.
The faintest sounds came from the slow movements of their lips, from their breaths, from the slight rustling of fabric.
Harry was laughing under his breath, so Draco shot him a glare. Harry's face was friendly-enough though; he didn't seem to be laughing
Harry fumbled to open his door, as Malfoy latched on to him, kissing at his neck again. Licking him there, and palming at Harry’s waist—working to untuck his dress shirt.
He considered what Pansy had said—not the love part, the part about Potter thinking Draco hated him. Could that be true? Granted, he had said ‘no’ a fair bit, lately. But that was only because he’d had to. Certainly Potter wouldn’t care or think twice about it.
Draco turned slowly, not quite sure if he should believe Harry. But, sure enough, Harry was wearing a faded grey t-shirt and jeans, just sitting on the edge of his bed, pulling on striped socks.
The ceremony began, and Harry largely tuned it out. He found thoughts and feelings trickling in, he found himself thinking about his relationship with Ginny. Maybe there was a reason they’d had such a long engagement, without making a single plan for the wedding.
Harry removed his key from the machine, undid his strap, and pushed the door open, stepping out. Draco eyed the box that secured the strap over himself, and pressed it, just as Harry had just done. The thing pushed in, and released the metal bit, sending it flying back from where it came—bumping into the car door on its way.
