“I don’t remember.”  He knew his voice sounded mulish, but he didn't want to say it.
“I liked your version better,” George offers, “but what about the fireworks?”  I am about to answer, but the door bangs, and Molly cries, “Ginny,” and that seems to be the universal signal for ‘lunch is ready’.
“Perhaps,” Draco allowed weakly, trying to glare at the baby, but the way he was gripping Draco’s leg and looking at him with such happiness made it impossible.
We’re interrupted from further exploration of this topic by tapping at my window.  For a moment, my heart leaps hopefully.  The owl isn’t the same black one that had delivered Draco’s previous missives, but maybe it’s one from the bank?  I eagerly open the window, and the bird holds its leg out imperiously.  I untie it, and open it up, and my heart sinks back to its usual position as I realize that the writing isn’t Draco’s.
Draco grinned, “I doubt that Healer Cici would appreciate being called a Vampire.”
“Pottah,” mumbled the baby.  “Pottah, Pottah, Pottah,”
by her that I realize that, whatever’s happened in my life, this woman sees me as hers.  The husband, Arthur, is close behind her, a man who seems to be permanently bemused.  His eyes, so much like his son’s, are warm as they fix on me, and he shakes my hand, saying “Alright there, Harry?”
“He and I have been enemies since I was eleven years old.  There have been times in my life where I truly despised him.”
“No.  Harry, I can’t tell you how sorry I am.  I didn’t mean those things, not at all.”
“Oh.  Yes, that would do it,” Harry said.
Draco did nothing for another week, in that, he thought constantly about Harry, but made no moves toward contacting him.  After waking on the morning of the seventh day, interrupting a dream that featured Harry’s bright eyes fixed on his, and his arms around his neck, he gave in, and sent an owl 'round to Hermione.
“It could be worse,” Harry reassures him.  “I once did the same to Dumbledore’s office.  Fortunately, I learned a pretty nifty spell from him and Slughorn.”  He waves his wand, and the office rights itself, canvases and paint tubes and brushes whirling around them.
“Oh,” I say blithely.  “Sorry for stealing your inheritance, Draco.  Can I offer you, what I'm positive is an old spooky house and an elf who makes excellent breakfasts?”
“I expect so.  I’ll ask your Papa.”
Draco thought about this for a moment.  He wasn’t sure if it would help, but he also didn’t know how to ride out the feeling, and not giving Harry the potion wasn’t something that Hermione would stand for.  “Maybe.”
“No!  He’s institutionalized, his people have been enslaved for so long that they don’t even realize that they can live in other ways.”
“So what happens now?” Cass wanted to know.
One lovely thing about being a Wizard was how quickly and easily things like international travel were facilitated.  The Portkey was arranged in a matter of days, and Harry set charms to take care of things within the house and cancelled his Girl’s Empowerment classes at the school for the foreseeable future. His business would simply have to wait. As Cass and Minerva bustled with their jackets and bags in the entryway, Harry lingered in the living room.  “You’ll go to your portrait at Hogwarts?”
“Don’t be silly, of course she does.  I actually did let a little more slip with Andromeda, because she’s a Healer, so she’s bound by the same confidentiality agreements I am, and I wanted her medical advice on Scorpius’ magic.  She understands, better than anyone, Draco, about not letting little kids suffer because of prejudice.”
“Sort of.  They’ve given me an overview of my life story, and she talked about helping me learn spells, and cope with the big gaping hole where my brain was, but she doesn’t seem as interested in helping me just…get it back.”
Draco had always been smart.  And he was a Slytherin.  For as long as he could remember, Draco had been able to take a situation, and turn it to the greatest possible advantage.  Part of that cleverness, however, was knowing when there was no possible advantage, and to walk away.  But Draco Malfoy had always had one irresistible exception to that rule…Harry Potter.  Even in first year, when Draco had come to the realization that he wasn’t going to be friends with the Boy who Lived, he was unable to stop baiting him, stop seeking his attention.  Like a moth and a flame, Draco couldn’t leave well enough alone when it came to Harry.
Luna’s shrug communicates a lot.  “True,” she says, her big eyes riveted on me, “but just because something isn’t officially your job, that doesn’t mean you feel like it’s unofficially your duty.”
The same girl is behind the counter.  “Louise, right?” I say, as she smiles in welcome.
Draco smiled a little, and, impulsively, summoned a parchment and self-inking quill, and with elegant penmanship, wrote:
“Cass, the situation was unbearably complicated.  For a whole number of reasons, I made the decision not to tell him.  And then we moved to Canada, and I stopped talking to anyone other than Auntie Min.”
“It’s Weasley now, and no.  She worries so much about Harry, and when she worries, she nags.  And when someone nags Harry, he just goes out and does the opposite, for spite.  He’s not used to people looking out for him, you know?  He’s always done the opposite of what people want him to do.”
“I’d heard something about that.  I suppose he’d be about four now?”
“Thank you.  I know I didn’t do any of the traditional wizarding culture things.  I got her a book when she was little, but when I tried to teach her any of it, she asked a bunch of questions and then laughed at me when I couldn’t answer them.”
“Harry, will you look at me?”  His voice sounds different, younger.  I look up, and I’m struck by his expression.  His grey eyes are wide, and there’s a little crease in his forehead.  His lower lip is caught beneath his teeth, and I’m left with the impression of a child, trying desperately to master a new skill.  I don’t know what he sees in my own face, but his expression is complicated, unknown.  The silence stretches and he finally blurts out, “I have a son.”
“Oh Merlin, Harry.  I didn’t think.  It wasn’t something I did on purpose, I swear…”
“Dais.  It’s called a dais, and I know.  I’m overreacting.  But it’s weird being back here, and I had too many weird things happen in my life not to be on the lookout for more.”
Harry leapt to his feet, the smile falling from his face.  “Is it over?”
“This is your first Pureblood funeral, isn’t it Harry?” Neville asks, and Harry sends him a relieved smile as he nods.
“Alright, Potter, but if you’re setting me up, losing your memories is going to be the least of your worries.”
Whatever self-preservation instincts he’d honed as a child, Harry was grateful for them now as he managed to force his body to stand, and move through Draco’s home.  He found himself in his bedroom.
I shrug.  “I’m hoping to make that work for me. Unless you know of another way to have him fall down in adoration at my feet.”
been their home.  Draco hadn’t officially moved from the Manor, but he had spent nearly every night, every weekend with Harry.  His clothes had hung in Harry’s closet, and Draco had been the most loving, devoted boyfriend Harry could have asked for.  He was supportive and generous, and they laughed and teased and drank gin on the rooftop patio on the top floor.  It was a good life, and Harry loved it, loved Draco.
Harry chuckled.  “Frankly, yes.  I’ve just disrupted all of your paradigms.  It’s an enormous shock, and some people struggle with accepting something so surprising.”
with distress.  “I…let me…I don’t…”
“No, never.”
“Oi,” he says in warning tones that are offset by the way his his grin widens.
“Uff,” I say.  “That was…a lot.  Are you sure you gave me the easy version?”
“Once Kingsley reassured you that there was a body who was responsible for their conduct, I looked into it further.  The Probation and Rehabilitation department has four full-time staff members, one of whom is the Team Lead.  His name is Dennis Creevey.  Gryffindor, lost a brother in the battle.  Creevey reports directly to Gawain Robards, but unofficially, Zach Smith reviews and signs off on his reports, with Robards rubber-stamping them afterwards.  Creevey doesn’t seem to do much of anything, as far as I can tell.”
“Well what would you have me do?  He’s super old, and if I free him, where’s he going to go?”
“Yeah, I’m going to have to run a bit more, to burn off all this ice cream, but it’s so worth it.”  I follow her into the back, and lift one of the barrels as she does the same.  We carry it out to the coolers, and repeat the process a half dozen more times.  Louise pushes her long hair out of her face, and smiles her thanks.
“Everywhere, Draco.  I went to so many places.  I learned so much, and saw beautiful things.  I met interesting people, and I finally understood what life could be like.”
“You can’t help it if you don’t feel the same way.”  Harry was barely clinging to his composure.  “I have to go,” he repeated, and, before Draco could answer, he had apparated away.
“Listen to me, you stupid fucker.  You don’t understand.”
“Yeah, until she got drunk and died in a car crash,” Harry said, his face falling.
“Kind of.  I love hockey.  But I love you more.”
“Of course I am.  Thank you for your help.  Do you think that one of you could get up with Harry if he wakes up?”
“Was?”
“It’s not really a schoolboy conflict, but that’s good to hear.  If, after I tell you everything, you decide that you can’t represent me, I’ll understand, but I’ll ask you not to speak of what I’m telling you.  Can you live with that?”
“Something on your mind?” Harry asked.
“Scorp, Draco, Astoria,” she said, “it’s wonderful to see you again.  Scorpius, I hope you remembered to bring me the Horntail you were going to show me.”
“My arse is half frozen,” Draco said, trying to smooth over the awkwardness.  “Can we go inside and get tea?”
When he realized who the letter was from, he regretted not being kinder to the owl.  But no matter, it had disappeared, and Draco was holding the parchment.
Harry felt tears prickling.  “Thanks, Draco.  I think I’ll go to bed.”  He set his glass on the table next to his armchair and escaped to his room, where his thoughts continued to run in cross purposes.  Could Draco truly mean it?  Would they be able to make things work?  He lay awake most of the night, confused, desperately wanting to believe what Draco was saying.
“How are you, Harry?”
The girls all started yelling body parts, and when they were done, Harry grinned, “Well done.  We’re going to punch in the throat, or the nose.  We’re going to poke eyes.  We’re going to kick knees, shins, or places that are normally covered by underwear!”  This prompted hysterical giggles from the girls, and Harry blushed.  “I know, it’s funny, but we want to hurt them, surprise them, make them let go.”
“Is it really?” Draco asked, his brain short-circuiting as he tried to connect the plump infant with the strapping Auror who had just destroyed his lab.
He hadn’t gotten a response, which was mildly strange, but, as distracted as he was with the idea that he was having a baby, (a baby!), he’d barely registered it, until, hours later, Draco had stumbled through the floo.  Harry had leapt to his feet.  “Draco!  Oh Merlin, are you okay?  You’re so pale.  Do you need something?  Tea?  Are you warm enough?”
“She’s been disinherited?”  Draco was shocked.  He’d never thought that Pansy’s parents would be so heartless.
“You need help.  You don’t have the political influence you once did, and they’re obviously not going to contact you.  This has gone on long enough.”
“I can?  Thanks, Draco.  I’m sorry I’m so pathetic.”
this is hard on you.  But it’s hard for me too.” His voice cracks then, and Draco knows he’s crying.  He continues in a whisper.  “I think about you every second of every day.  I dream about you all night.  I feel like a part of me has been ripped away and I fucking ache from it all the fucking
Harry begins to dream again, of the night in the forest.  He sees himself turning the stone, sees his parents, Sirius, Remus.  Instead of them walking him to his fate, they look at him curiously.  “Do I know you?” His Mother asks, thoughtfully.  “You look rather like a boy I once knew, but he was alive.”
The joy rises up like a bubble, filling my stomach with tingly excitement, and making my chest feel tight.  I want to weep, and laugh, and most of all, I want to kiss Draco until he loses that smug little smirk.
“Thank you.  I’d better say goodbye, and help Cass clean up.”
Until it doesn’t.  On the eleventh moon, Draco sits in his flat, waiting, until the sun comes up, but the owl doesn’t arrive.  He sits until noon comes and goes, and until night falls the next day.  Only then, does he allow the brokenhearted sob to escape.  He collapses to the ground, head on the cool tile, and the sounds that emerge sound barely human.  He cries until his voice is gone, and his face stings, and then he just lies there, silent, and hopeless, with no intention of ever getting up again.
“Fine.
“I just wondered.  What happens next?”
, Cass, by everyone who ever meets you.  And you are going to live, because I can’t even understand a world that doesn’t have you in it.  I’ve died before, and if I have to do it again to drag you back here, I will.”
“Draco and Astoria Malfoy have a little boy named Scorpius.  He is four years old.  If he doesn’t receive treatment, he will surely die, and it would be unlikely that he would reach his sixth birthday.”
“Yes,” Draco answered absently, examining the results of his diagnostic charm with concern.  Still bloody malnourished, and a host of other injuries.  As he helped him into a larger t-shirt, Draco couldn’t help but notice the little scars and bruises dotting his back.  “Where did you get these bruises, Harry?”
The next night, at seven precisely, Draco Malfoy steps through my floo, looking like a model.  He’s wearing tight denims, and a blue sweater that makes his eyes look more beautiful than normal.  His hair is still damp from his shower, and, as he tosses the long part at the front out of his eyes, I catch a whiff of his shampoo.  My knees get weak, and I want to bite him.
“You want to wear blue robes?  That’s why you were upset?”
“Hermione is brilliant,” she continues.  “She knew from her first day on the train that she’d be discriminated against because of her heritage.  And she’s brave.  She faced the hatred head-on, and she met their eyes, and she advocated for sentient creatures who didn’t have the same rights.  She wouldn’t be part of discrimination like that, Harry.  She just wouldn’t.”
“Oh yes, that’s true.  I think you’ve gone nearly a week without calling me ‘little duck’ and getting that wounded deer look.”
Surprisingly, this honesty seemed to disarm Longbottom, his broad face breaking into a wide grin.  “I reckon he’s no better when it comes to you.  Who am I to stand in the way of destiny?”  With that, he retreated from the fire, and called “Harry.  Floo for you.”
“Draco,” Hermione suddenly said sharply.  “What do you need right now?”
“Those jeans you made me buy say differently.”
“Oi, prat, since when do you work on a Saturday night?” Harry asked.  The slim figure behind the desk jumped, splotting ink all over her parchment.
“I know you’re tired, but I wanted to tell you something.”
“France, I imagine,” Draco sighs.  “Harry, even before you lost your memory, you never learned a single thing about our world.  It’s always driven me mad.  I’m gay, Potter.  I have no interest in women.  But I’m the Malfoy Heir, and continuing the line isn’t optional.  I’ve always known that I would need to have a son.  My parents arranged a marriage with a suitable woman, who agreed to bear me an Heir, and discreetly divorce me afterwards.  It’s very common.”
“I would have preferred not to tell you all of this at once.  It’s rather a lot to take in.”
The afternoon passed…tolerably.  Kreacher, as Weasley had pointed out, was mad as a brush, but he was entranced by Harry Potter in baby form, and was able to care for him for several hours while Draco worked.  After liberating some blood and hair samples from the baby, and placing them into a potion bath to scan for toxins, Draco took advantage of the time, noting down precise formulas in his notebook, and only occasionally casting a slightly desperate glance at the portion of shower he’d not yet cleaned.  When he’d finished with the complex arithmancy required to determine the exact stage the inflammation reducer had reached before mixing with the blood thickener, he finally allowed himself to scrub down the shower before entering it himself.  His self-cleaning rituals, left unchecked, often took a great deal of time, but, noting that it had been suspiciously quiet in the flat above, he rushed through his ablutions, and summoned a fresh set of robes from the wardrobe.
He shrugs, wondering how he never noticed that Draco’s own eyes were grey, not blue as he’d always thought.  “At the end of sixth year…after…I stood up here, terrified, because I knew that things were about to change, that something big was coming, and I didn’t think I was strong enough to face it.  Feels the same now, but worse.  With Voldemort, I wasn’t sure if I was going to get to live through it.”
The silence stretched endlessly, Draco steadily drinking, aware of Harry’s gaze on his mouth as he did so.  As the time passed and the tension increased, Harry finally spoke again.  “You’re a bastard, you know?”  His tone was mild, but he didn’t meet Draco’s eyes.
“Okay.”
I have no expectations of a Wizarding trial, which is good, because I never could have imagined how procedural and
“Oh, yes, I suppose that will work.  Seems a bit cruel though.”
I don’t fancy any more ice cream, but there’s no other shop I remember.  My eyes light on the big bank again, and I remember.  Draco Malfoy.  Smiling to myself, I enter the bank.  The Goblin guarding the doors glares at me, but I smile back at him, and that puts him off his stride for a moment.  I slip past, and scan the bank.  There’s no sign of that distinctive white blond hair.  I head to the Welcome Goblin’s counter, and if ever there was a misnomer, it’s that.  The Goblin is the opposite of welcoming.  I tell him that I have an urgent matter to discuss with Mister Malfoy.  For some reason, this prompts a sharp toothed grin that’s not a little savage.
It’s strange, having someone there with me in my mind.  I can feel his presence, and I’m self-conscious, like I should have tidied up first.  I try not to think of anything, which works about as well as you’d expect.  I’m so afraid he’s going to find some sort of super-deviant kink or something, and leave my mind in a horrified huff, and storm out of here, that I’m left doing the mental equivalent of kicking pebbles while I wait.
“I told him that I met a new kid today, and that he was really cool, and he said he wanted to be your friend.”
Someone pulls on my wrist, and I turn to confront whomever is foolish enough to delay me.  When I see that it’s Draco, I lower my wand.  “That?” Draco says, slamming me into an adjacent wall, “was really fucking hot.”  His mouth is on mine before I can respond.  I kiss him eagerly, my hands touching him anyplace I can reach while hindered by his robes.  In my desperation for contact, I can’t settle on caressing any one part of him for long.
“Muggle?”
becoming a problem, though.”
“How would they go about doing that?  Should I take a de-aging potion, and have someone raise me properly?  Should I go find my relatives and hex them?  Dig up Dumbledore and have a good shout at him for raising me to be a sacrifice?  What would any of that gain?”  Harry shrugged.  “I’d much rather focus on what can be done now.  Like finding a solution for Scorpius.”
“He’s not nearly as angry as I expected him to be.  Said something about, ‘what would you expect’ and left as soon as the press had cleared out.”
“I’ve started doing some freelance work for Ollivanders,” Harry said.
“Do you hate me?”
“Did you miss him?”
“Good.  That’s important.  Now, should we go inside and see whether your Mummy has ruined the cooking?”
“This might present a conflict of interest for you then.  I don’t want to put you in an awkward position, but my life is a bit more entwined with Draco’s than you know.”
“Before I told you that I’d be suing you for full custody and damages?” Draco said.
“They do?”  In his fear, Harry seemed to forget that he was angry with Draco.

being alive.  He hadn’t escaped murder by an insane megalomaniac to die at the hands of a Weasley.
“They’re your potions, Malfoy.  Surely you have an antidote.”
Luna has brought him an injured snake.  Harry didn’t realize that he wanted a pet, but she claims that the snake is unable to tell her where it hurts, and it’s an ideal situation.  The snake is ill mannered and not overly inclined to conversation.  “You speak?” it asks, dismissively, as though Harry were sullying the noble language of the snake.
And here's the epilogue.  Thanks bunches to everyone who's read and commented, and enjoyed.  I've got a bunch of works in progress that I hope to finish soon, so it shouldn't be too long before I'm posting another story.  Stay safe everyone!
“Could be worse,” Draco argued.  “You might have inherited Harry's Gryffindor tendencies.”
Luna is expected to arrive within the hour, and we spend little time preparing what to discuss with her.  Instead, Draco’s razor-sharp intellect is directed upon me.  “It makes sense,” he says, squeezing lemon into his teacup.  “I’ve been wondering why you were so different since losing your memory.  I’ve spent an awful lot of time thinking about nature versus nurture lately.”
“Some of the people I work with have taken your Mum and Dad to our offices to help explain things.”
Ron heads straight back to bed, and, with nothing to do and all exits, presumably, watched, there’s nothing left for me but to go to my own room, where I lie under the quilt, remembering silver eyes and a sexy smirk.
“I reckon he would,” Ron says gruffly.
“Yeah,” Harry laughed.  “She must be as crap at potions as me.  It didn’t work.”  He beamed at Draco.
“So what, you just fell in love and then everything was forgotten?”
“Yes, thank you.”
“Much, thank you.”
Draco didn’t bother to try to wipe his tears away.  The world had hurt this man, over and over, and Draco had never once considered the toll it had taken on him.  In hindsight, everything that Harry did made so much more sense.  More importantly, Draco felt the impact of his own actions in a way that had never occurred to him.  They hadn’t been playing on a mutual field.  Harry had never learned how to shield his soft parts.  Harry was nothing
“Let me take you to dinner,” I say, “and I’ll answer any question you have.  If, after that, you still don’t want to help me, I’ll leave you alone, no foul.”
Her eyes fill with tears.  “Please, Harry, if you’d only listen!”
“Didn’t you think that you owed him the right to know about his daughter?”
“It’s brilliant, Draco.  You’re…” Harry broke off for a moment, lowered his eyes, blushed.  “You’re good.”  Draco felt his smile widen as he basked in Harry’s admiration.  It was sweet torture.
While he was gone, Draco tried to think of something to say, and eventually settled on “Your gardens here are lovely.  Do you enjoy horticulture?”
“I’m sorry, we’re being so rude,” Harry replied, but he was tempted.
“You look like you swallowed a quaffle,” Ron, who had finally reached them, said.
“You can’t ask him anything!  I feel like Papa and Grand-Mère both answer my questions, but they’re talking in riddles or something.  I never understand what they mean.”
“I do.  Luna says that you’re not feeling well?”
“Magic’s not real,” he said firmly, looking extremely uncomfortable.
“What position do you play?”
“Hermione,” I say, “perhaps we could get to what he’s actually been doing?”
“My head hurts.”
“I share a house with a number of people from our year.”
“Well, they mostly locked me in my cupboard and threatened to beat me half to death, so…I wouldn’t recommend their methods,” Harry replied, surprising himself.  He would have thought that Draco Malfoy was the last person he’d make a flip comment in front of, but it had escaped without thought.
“It’s oversimplified at best,” Draco shoots back.  “Freud’s methods were problematic, and offered the after-the-fact explanations of any characteristic, but failed to predict such behaviours and traits.  It’s like betting on a Quidditch match after it’s been played.  He didn’t prove anything with empirical data, and his theories are about a century old.  What are the credentials of your Psychologist?”
“Oh.  I…ah…never had a tutor.  I thought it was like normal school.”
“I never fuss.”
“What was their reason?”
“And your…coaches were okay with you leaving?” She still struggled with the uncommon Muggle word.  She didn’t understand why Draco left, why he was playing Muggle Hockey, of all things, for a shitty minor league team in Canada.  She couldn’t understand that he was just Dray there, that the name on the back of his jersey didn’t engender fear or loathing in those who read it.  She couldn’t see that it was just a cool looking tattoo on his wrist there, not a symbol of his weakness, his foolishness.
You forgot your jumper
As the door closed behind her, Harry wasn’t sure which one of them she was reassuring.
Harry had been proud that, for all of the unexpected challenges his life had presented, that he’d never bowed down, never been beaten by his losses.  That he’d squared his shoulders and stood up, over and over.  He wondered if this time, he’d be able to pick himself back up.  He wondered if he’d care to even try.  He had started to shiver, and even the kids under the bleachers had left, so he rose and began to trudge home.
“Knew what?”
“I get that.  It’s hard for me to adjust, because you never used to want to decide anything.  I got into the habit of telling you what to do.  I guess I just didn’t expect that you’d suddenly stop wanting that.”  She smiles at me.  “It’s good though.  I wanted…want you to be more in charge of your life.”  She stands up and throws her arms around me.  She might be bossy, but she gives amazing hugs.  As she sits back down, I can see the glimmer of tears in her eyes.  “So I heard that things didn’t work out with Malfoy.”
They quickly moved on to Harry.  “Daddy,” Cass said.  “I thought you wouldn’t make it to meet us!”
“Oh, family of Narcissa’s, then.  You’re quite welcome, child.”  His face suddenly twisted.  “She’s not Andromeda’s daughter, is she?”
“Well, I don’t know either,” I say, staring at the intriguing lines of a scar on my left hand. “I mean, obviously, I don’t know, but I don’t know how something so absolutely fundamental to who I am could be spell-related.  Ron, you say that when you were on a love potion, you were…I dunno, fixated on getting to some girl you didn’t know, and this isn’t like that.  It’s not a compulsion.  Like, I don’t feel like I’ll die if I don’t get some…er…anyway, what I’m saying is that I just…know this.  Like I knew my name is Harry, and I knew that you guys were safe, even if I couldn’t remember your names or whatever.  It’s not a new feeling.  It’s…who I am.  The same way I know that I like ice cream, even though I can’t remember why.”  Gods, I am absolute pants at expressing myself, but I need them to see how this is different from any spell-related weirdness.  I wonder if the old me would be surprised to find himself discussing sexual identity with his best friends.
“Fuck, definitely,” Astoria said decidedly.
“No, no, we’ve hashed that all out, you don’t need to say anything,” Harry said.  “This is just hard.  It’s scary to say this.”  He continued, “I don’t think that a relationship like that would be healthy for me.  I know that I need to define my life on my own terms.”
Rita Skeeter wrote all sorts of nonsense about you.  What if he sells you out again?”
“I’d like to know exactly what’s happened here,” the yelling man blustered.  “This freak did something to my Amy!”
“Draco,” Harry says.  He communicates a lot with that one word.  Love, and loss, and yearning, and acceptance.
“Merlin, I hope not.  If that’s how he indicates his interest, we’ll never get anywhere.  I imagine he found that weird postcard somewhere, and sent it without thinking about what it might mean.”
“Well, fortunately for us both, Pansy’s promised to apparate me directly to Mungo’s if I’m ever insane enough to do so.”
“No, I can’t, not if Scorpius is so unstable.  He’s going to be devastated.  He’s been so looking forward to it.”  He placed his hands over his eyes, looking uncharacteristically vulnerable.  “God, I’m really cocking this parenting thing up, aren’t I?”
He does.  At length.  There’s a great deal of complicated-sounding magical theory, but it boils down to the fact that the team within the Room of Inheritance researches all hereditary gifts, particularly those considered ‘dark’.  This jerk's particular project identifies families known to be Dark Arts-aligned, and charts how many had been convicted of crimes, with an eye to proving that the Dark Arts create an insatiable thirst for power.  They intend to understand the imbalance of power that exists between wizards…why some wizards are inordinately strong, while others aren’t, and if this power is directly correlates to successfully becoming a Dark Lord.  I'm no magical theorist, but it's a shaky argument if you ask me.  It feels like he's just cobbled together a bunch of ideas to try to pick on people.  Which, I suppose, is sort of what he's done.  I keep my analysis to myself.
Harry looked at him with understanding, and that shy little smile from before crossed his features again.  “And you still came to get me.”
“I do,” Draco says, his voice deep and firm.
Harry was trying to get to his feet, and so Draco rose to his, and held out a hand.  Harry hesitated for a moment before taking it, and before long, they were both back on their feet.
“Don’t you want to see if he’s written something to you?” She kept her voice mild.
“I know, mate.  She can be a lot when she thinks she’s right.”
“Wicked,” Cass breathed.  “May I touch it?”
“Papa,” Scorpius said, his voice wobbling.  “I did it again.”
Scorpius nodded again, but remained stoically silent.  Stifling a grin, Harry said, “I understand that something happened in your class today.  One of your classmates got a little sting, and I’m sure that it was confusing and upsetting for everyone.  Do you know what happened?”  Scorpius nodded.  “Great, I’m so glad you can help.  Tell me what you saw,” Harry said encouragingly.
“Yes.  Do you realize that my Dad
“Why not?  The first thing I’d do when I got big was to get a dog.  Wait, do
“A drink?” Draco was thunderstruck.
“Fair enough.  I saw your Papa, at the Manor.”
Harry hung his head.  He couldn’t look into Mrs. Malfoy’s eyes.  Perhaps she’d ask him to leave England now.  He didn’t want to leave Cass to endure the Bone Marrow treatment alone.  He didn’t think it was fair to not do everything to pave the way for her relationship with Draco.  But, he owed Narcissa a life debt, and, if asked, he’d have to agree, wouldn’t he?
Harry saw no flaw in these instructions as well, so he did so, hoping that Cass thought he was distracted because of the rush to catch his portkey.  Just like he’d done as a child, when teachers or other adults asked too many questions about things at home, he managed to answer Cass’ questions coherently, while a large portion of his mind wailed in terror at being found out.  He was nearly out of her room when the voice in his mind said,
Draco obviously thinks so too, because he raises an eyebrow in Hermione’s direction.  She flushes.  “I copied it,” she says.  “And don’t you dare judge me, because that’s nothing compared to doing a Blood Magic ritual.”
“Yes. And I’ll see you in your quarters once you’re settled.”
“Two weeks ago, Hermione came to visit me at the Castle.  Do you know what her job at the Ministry entails?”  Harry shook his head.  “She runs the Department of Magical-Muggle Relations, and supervises any interaction that Wizards have with the Muggle world.  She received an application to participate in a Muggle Medical Trial.  Are you familiar with those?”  Harry nodded.  “The application was from Draco, applying on behalf of his son.”
Malfoy?” She looks stunned, but I nod, glad that I’ve solved the problem.
“We usually just cast a shield charm, and people go away eventually.”
“Well, you might be a Malfoy, son, but you’re also human.  I’d be shocked if you weren’t feeling something, under all that decorum.  We’ll do everything that we can to make sure that your Mother is comfortable and peaceful.  I’m very sorry, Mr Malfoy.”
“You slipped?”  Harry can’t help but grin at this.  It’s so endearing and so…Draco.
“A number of things.  Exhaustion, dehydration, malnutrition, disassociation, and, if I’m not mistaken, post-traumatic stress disorder.  We’ll need to confirm that last one, but that will come later.”
Soon, the case had been opened, and everyone was happily getting pissed again.  Draco started edging towards the doorway, but his progress was arrested by a bushy-haired witch with fire in her eyes.
When the secretary left, the little boy regarded Harry solemnly.  Harry motioned to a chair beside him, and the boy scrambled onto it.  Harry took a moment to observe him.  Scorpius’ breaths came fast and harsh.  He was clearly terrified.  “Hi Scorpius,” Harry said softly.  “My name is Harry, and I’m here to help you.”
“This time, there’s no enemy to fight, just myself.  And I don’t know what I want to happen.”
“It was,” Hermione allows.  “But, he…he made some awful decisions.”
“No idea.  The Fidelius wouldn’t have stopped her, because she’s known the secret since we moved in, but Hermione’s wards are strong.”
“Mm,” Draco agreed, his eyes on the rat cadaver in front of him.
“I don’t mean it that way, Draco, but you have to see my point.  Scorpius was so wanted.  I love him so much, but something doesn’t seem right about this.  And, we don’t know if a half sibling would even match Scorpius.  But then I just look at his little face, and I’d do anything in the world to get him better.”
Draco was utterly confused now, but nodded again.  That seemed to galvanize something in Harry, because he moved closer until their faces were nearly touching.
Rose chuckled, and launched herself into Draco’s arms, where he jounced her slightly, evoking deep belly laughs from the toddler.  “Draco,” Hermione said, “you…you’re looking wonderful.  You’re doing so well!”
Draco soon disappeared into his lab, and, aside from the occasional ominous thump from the floor above, was able to lose himself in his work.  It was nearly ten o’clock when Draco realized that he hadn’t done any of his morning rituals.  Something for the journal, he resolved, and dove back into his research, only stopping for a few minutes when a cup of tea and a freshly baked scone appeared on his desk.
“I’m also surprised.  I was brought here under false pretences,” he admitted.  “If I’d known I’d make people uncomfortable, I never would have come.  To be honest, it never occurred to me that Pansy would be living here with such a…diverse group.”
Draco was just putting his book onto the nightstand when Harry entered the bedroom.  He sighed huffily.  “Oh no, Harry, you always do this!”
, Draco knew.
“How about this,” Draco said, realizing that they were going to continue peppering questions at one another, not bothering to properly answer each other.  “You can look at your robes and wand, and then you will answer some questions honestly for me, okay?”
hot?  Ding
His face looked so desperate, that Astoria took pity on him.  “Okay.  Cass will be fine here, and although we would also love you to stay, I see that you have something that requires your urgent attention.  You should come back at eight to pick her up.  Can you promise me something though?”
I’m not really sure where guilt comes into the equation, but we’re making ground towards reconciliation, so I say, “Maybe we just leave it there?  That we both acted poorly, and we’re both sorry?”
“Yes,” she said softly, “you’re in the right place now.”  Malcolm looked up at her, and she gave him one of her lovely smiles.  The boy’s lips quirked, but he looked quickly at his feet before a true smile could blossom.  “Come in,” she invited.  Harry and Malcolm crossed the threshold.
“That’s good,” I say.  He’s getting a little frustrated by how little I’m nudging the conversation along, but I’m curious to see what, exactly, his problem is.
“Git,” I say fondly.  “It’s like everything I felt for you in school finally makes sense now.  And now that we’re not hexing one another, I can see my feelings for what they are.  I think it’s always been you, Draco.”
“How do you propose we figure that out?”
The Department of Magical-Muggle Relations was located on the fifth floor of the Ministry.  Scorpius looked wide-eyed at the memos swooping through the corridors as he clung to Draco’s hand and skipped along beside him.  The door to the Department Head was guarded by a stern looking older woman who peered over her glasses at the two of them.  “Do you have an appointment?”
“Thanks, Dad.”
“I make myself do it,” Draco said.  It was the first time that he’d really spoken about his compulsions, and he was surprised that Harry had noticed.  Then again, when had Harry
“I’m trying,” Harry said.
Draco heard a pained noise escape him, and he frantically tried to reassemble his facial expression.  It didn’t matter though, because Harry was looking down at Hank as though the secrets of the universe were buried within his fur.
He nods, and at his finger snap, an elf appears, who then leads me to a guest suite.  Once I’m alone in the room, I sink down onto the floor and rest my head on my knees.  For the longest time, I can’t focus my thoughts at all, they just turn over and over, examining the information that the day has brought, and retreating from each evidence of betrayal.
“Shh.”  Harry puts a finger to Draco’s lips.  “It doesn’t matter.  Don’t say something you don’t mean.  I have to do this.  I have to leave the ghosts behind and see if there’s anything left of me.  On my own.”
He watched her leave with a look of dazzled wonder and then his wide eyes met Draco’s.  “I never quite know what to think when she’s been here either,” Draco confided, and Harry’s lips quirked around his thumb in almost a smile.  “Are you hungry?” Draco asked, and Harry’s head tilted to one side as he appraised Draco.  “It’s just that, I haven’t had any lunch yet, and Kreacher always makes so much.  I was hoping you could help me eat some.”
Since it was a Wednesday, and midday, Harry wasn’t surprised to find himself at a Primary School.  He entered the front door, and made his way to the office.  “Good afternoon,” he said to the Secretary.  “My name is Harry Potter, and I’m a Community Support worker.  I’ve been asked to pop by and visit with Scorpius Greengrass.”
“I don’t know if Mum and Dad are free,” Ron said, but he looked hopeful.
“From our year, about a dozen.  Well.  There were a dozen.  A few have left the country.  One died.  Including Pansy, there are seven Slytherins our age who are still on probation.”
“Malfoy!” Ron bellowed, sounding delighted, his face nearly as red as Mister Weasley’s had been.  “Come in!  You’re just in time!”
“Harry, I didn’t mean-”
“No,” he says, but he’s watching me closely.  I can’t read his expression, so I flop back down on my back.  “The old you would have, I imagine.”
“Either are we,” Draco said, taking Astoria’s hand and leading her to find their son.
“So you’ve experienced both the detachment that I’m feeling now, and the ability to feel your emotions more normally.  What would you do if you were me?”
“It’s late.”
“Hermione?” My voice is not forceful at all.  “What’s going on?”
“I did.  And it took me a long time to realize that it wasn’t my fault.  She didn’t hurt me because I was bad, or deserved it or anything.”
“I know that with some types of organ donations, the donor has to maintain certain protocols after the donation is completed.  If Cass donates her bone marrow, will it affect her quality of life in the long term?”
“Yeah.  I just need to know whether to give up and walk away.  I’d largely resigned myself to there being no hope, but, I still think about him all the time. I don’t want to put you in an awkward position, but I also think that you know him best.  Is it kinder to leave well enough alone?”
a trusted adult, but perhaps the teacher could help him find one.
“And you won’t deliberately show me porn again?”
Harry shrugged.  “It was different with the Dursleys, because they hated me right from the start.  But I was so afraid that if I gave you all just one more reason, that it would be the last straw.  And so I ran.  And I told myself that because I chose to leave, that it wouldn’t hurt as much.  I was wrong, as it happens.  I’ve missed you all so much.  And I’m sorry.”
“I have a brother.”  Cass looked awestruck for a moment, and then pleased.  “Wow.  I mean, I guess I knew it was possible, but wow.  A brother.  How will the Healers fix his blood?”
The minute I lay down, the room starts to spin, and I’m panicking that I’m going to throw up in Draco’s bed, after being specifically instructed not to.  He’s back by my side right away though, and hands me a vial with a bright pink liquid inside.  “Drink this, Harry.”
“Draco!  That’s enough.  This is what we are going to do.  Today, we will not be discussing anything that took place before Cass was born.  That is a discussion that you and Harry will have separately, in private, on another day.  Today, we will get to know one another, and make some plans about helping Scorpius.  Is that understood?”
“Yes, Ma’am.”
“We’re working on delaying my responses.  A little bit of exposure therapy.  When I’m worried that the germs in my kitchen will make someone sick, I try to wait to clean it, or sometimes, to only partially clean it.  I’m not strong enough to ignore the bad thoughts, yet, but I’m working on it.”
“Congratulations.”
, Draco.  You worked hard, and you managed to reevaluate the lessons you’d been taught, and you learned to define things differently.  Harry Potter didn’t do that for you.”
“I was just picking out clothes anyhow,” Harry’s voice says over the shower, and Draco squawks in annoyance.
Draco escaped Lara’s office gratefully, and flooed home.  His Mother was sitting regally on a blanket by the fire, her wand waving as she conjured a set of stars that turned into a fiery dragon.  Harry clapped his hands in utter delight, his chortles filling the room with warmth.  Draco watched them for a moment, recalling a similar set of stars and an equally playful dragon that she conjured for him every night as he lay in his bed as a child. When Harry spied him, he let out an excited squeak, and crawled as quickly as he could towards Draco, who patted his head a little.  “Did you miss Uncle Malfoy?”
.  Draco wondered if he could simply flee, but, in a heartbeat, the scrutiny subsided.  A few people nodded at him, and the rest simply returned their attention to the blender.  Which, it seemed, none of them could figure out how to operate.
Harry looked relieved, but a bit confused.  Draco continued, “But, every time you gain a new age, you also seem to gain the memories of everything that happened to you since your previous one.  And so, even though I can promise that you won’t be actually hurt between now and then, I don’t really know much about what happened to you before Hogwarts.  So while you, this you, won’t be hurt, I’m afraid that you might remember some upsetting things.”
“Why did you kidnap Scorpius Malfoy?” I ask angrily.
“Hello,” Cass said, a little shyly.
“And now?”
“Shut up, George.  You have to help me.”
“Thanks,” Ron said.  “It’s marvellous, really, when I’ve gotten enough sleep to appreciate it.  Where’s Kreacher?”
“Is Cass okay?”
Harry was, predictably enough, in his closet.  Draco knocked on the doorframe.  “May I come in?”
“I thought that things had changed.  Voldemort has died.  We’re on the precipice of a new world.  Why, then, do we need to uphold the tired old traditions that led us to destruction in the first place?”
Cass ran into the room, her expression pinched and, if Draco were a betting man, he’d say close to tears.  “I’m ready, Dad.  Are you sure we have to go?”
Draco resolved to ask some more specific questions about Harry’s Muggle relatives, but decided that this might not be the right time.  He motioned to a stool, next to him, and Harry awkwardly climbed up.  He sat, swinging his legs a little, before he noticed Draco watching him, and quickly stopped.  “I imagine this must be confusing,” Draco said, after a while of mutual scrutiny.
.  “No,” I say, sighing with relief.
Cass shrugged.  “Fine.  I’ll try.”
Harry nods again.  “Yes, sir.  Thank you.”
If she’s waiting for an answer from me, she’ll be waiting a while, because I know she has more to say.  “But,” she continues, “you’re not really much for saying anything.  Not about the important stuff.  You don’t talk to anyone, Harry.  Not about your childhood, not about the war, not about why, sometimes, after we’ve made love, as soon as you think I’m asleep you leave the room and walk around outside.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry cried, and the tears that had been threatening spilled down his cheeks.  He looked horrified, and spun, running from the room before Draco or Kreacher could respond.
His heart had stopped.  That was the only explanation for this strange dream universe where Harry was saying the words he’d always wanted to hear.  But Harry was still looking at him, waiting for a response.  Draco wordlessly shook his head.
He looked sincere.  Harry wasn’t really sure what to say, but fortunately, they were interrupted by Scorpius, who had finished his snack and wanted to be involved in the conversation, which meant that they avoided the heavy topics, and Harry asked some questions about their lives together.
A passing mediwitch suggested that they might be more comfortable in the family waiting room.  Harry got a look on his face that suggested that he was about to tell the mediwitch exactly what she should be comfortable doing, so Draco hastily intervened, explaining that their two children were inside, and that they were all a little anxious.  The mediwitch smiled, said she’d bring them some biscuits the next time she passed, and continued on her way.
Harry laughed a little, a small sound. “Wow, you’re not giving me an inch here, are you?  Okay, I suppose that’s fair.”  He gathered a long breath, and looked into Draco’s eyes.  “I’ve missed you, Draco.  You fucked up, you made a judgement call, and it was a bad one, and it hurt me, and it hurt you.”  Draco nodded again, feeling his face may crack with the pain.
“Will we have pizza for dinner?”
“Oh.  Right, yeah.”  Harry watched Draco warily.  He wasn’t sure where the conversation was going, which was usually a sign that it was headed in an unpleasant direction
Sighing, Draco calculated that he’d be able to complete the Imperius vaccination as well as a blood-thickening potion both before the Auror parade began.  Just to be safe, though, (
“No, Harry, absolutely not, you’re not picking out his clothes.  I specifically had robes tailored for this, and if I leave it up to you, you’ll put him in something ghastly.”
“No, definitely not that,” Harry laughed, and opened Cass’ door.  “Weasleys, I’d like you meet my daughter, Cassiopeia.”  Molly gasped, and Ron and Arthur made nearly identical noises of shock.
“Yeah, whatever, if it’s for Harry,” George said, his eyes still on the door, and his tone distant.
She was as hesitant as a fawn as she crossed the room towards him.  She nudged his feet from the ottoman, and perched on the edge, wrapping her skinny arms around herself.  “I’m angry with you,” she admitted.
“What do you want?” his words weren’t unkind, just a bit dismissive, as though Draco were an inconvenient caller, disrupting Neville from his tea.  For all Draco knew, that was exactly what he was.
“I don’t know how to take you, new Potter,” he looks discomforted.
With a mental shrug, he fetched a parchment and quill.
Was it a kindness to try to make amends, when you don’t know if you’d do it any differently if you had the chance?  This, it seemed, was the crux of the matter.  At the time, Draco couldn’t have turned his back on his family.  If he had been asked now to choose, between a partner and his parents’ honour, he would grapple with the issue, but he liked to think that he wouldn’t have capitulated so readily.  The definition of family changed, over time, he realized, and his responsibilities were different now.
“That’s mad.”
“I’m not sure that’s a good idea.”
“Yes, fine.  I’m a Crown Prosecutor.”
That’s good, I reckon.  I have no idea how I did that, and Draco’s a smart bloke.  He’s muttering into the floo now, and Pansy turns to me.  “So,” she says, a wry grin appearing on her lips, “have you been feeling strange lately?”
“But, Da-ad,”
Harry shook his head, and looked at him for a long time before he spoke.  “How come I’m here?”
Harry took a chance on looking at Draco, whom he’d been carefully avoiding.  He was leaning insolently against a wall, his face carefully arranged in a sneer.  He huffed.  “Say what you want, Potter.”
“What will you do about your wild magic?”
“Wait til you see the real thing tomorrow,” he promised.
“So I’m told.  Perhaps it’s cleaner if we’re able to move on from it.”
Draco looked around the platform, noting that it had largely emptied.  There was one family who remained at the opposite end, the mother leaning against the wall.  Her hands were over her face, and her husband was ineffectually trying to comfort her.  “I suppose we should go,” he said.
“No,” Harry said honestly.  “It’s taking every bit of control I have not to grab Cass and run home.”
I nod, and she says, “If I may,” and I have to stifle a snort because this kid is all of five, and she’s such a
“Yes,” Andromeda said quietly.  “My mother, your grandmother taught us all to love growing things.”
“Why wouldn’t I?” Cass tilted her head, surprised.  “Of course I want to know more about you, learn your stories.”
“I’m glad.  Thank you for giving him another chance.  He’s not rejecting you, you know.”
“Did you…” Draco decided that today was a day for risks.  “Would you like to have lunch with me?  If you’re free?”
“Sorry,” I say, but I’m smirking.  “Got distracted.”  I’m intrigued to see that he’s panting, the heavy breaths causing his chest to rise and fall beneath his jumper.  My eye, inexorably, travels down to his crotch, where I confirm the evidence that he’s not unaffected by my little fantasy.
“Honestly, Mister Fortesque, there aren’t very many people who treat me normally.  As though I’m just a regular person.  I appreciate that you do, and I’d like to see that Louise gets a chance to follow her dream.  Once she’s on her feet, she can do the same for someone else someday.  Alright?  Please?”  Now that I have this idea in my head, I’m reluctant to let it go.  I can’t keep hanging around the house, and I feel like this is the only way they’ll let me come and hang out.
His eyes flick to look into mine, and I try to tell him everything with my gaze.  “I like the rest of you just as much,” I continue.
They had a quick fly, and Harry was pleased to see that Teddy was taking well to his broom.  He knew that Tonks had been comfortable flying, but he’d never actually seen Remus on a broom.  Teddy was quite bookish, and Harry wanted to make sure that he was well-rounded.
Harry hadn’t said anything to Draco, other than ‘hello’, and so he didn’t expect Draco to speak to him.  “I’ve decided to attend your press conference,” he said tightly.
, Draco thought, dragging himself out of the rocking chair.  His back and neck ached from sleeping in the rocking chair.  Harry’s hands patted Draco’s cheeks gently.  “Pottah,” Harry said.
“You don’t feel jealous?”
“Percy, you numbnuts,” Ron says, punching him in the shoulder hard enough that the thin man stumbles.  “He’s lost his memories, he hasn’t got a clue what happened.”
“I apologize for her behaviour,” Harry said stiffly.
“Curse breaker,” he corrects, giving me a stern look.  “And I can’t imagine that you need anything from me.  Surely the Healers at St. Mungo’s and the Unspeakables are working on it?”
“Well, not eliminate,” he said, ill-at-ease, “but this does help you to resist it.  I’m glad that it does.”
“I guess.  After that, can I ask you more questions?”
“I’m not sure,” Draco said carefully.  “I wasn’t sure you were going to want to.”
Draco frowned.  “No thanks are necessary, Harry.  She’s our daughter.  I’d do anything for her, to help her succeed.”
“No, no, I realize now that it was terribly stupid of me.  Don’t worry.  Even though it gave me a reason to get out of bed, put on clean clothes, leave the house, it wasn’t healthy for me, and it wasn’t really fair to put that kind of pressure on you.  When you finally disabused me of my delusions last week, it was…difficult.”
Draco indulges in a lonely weeping fit, and then goes to Hermione.  He knows how worried everyone is about Harry, and he can’t keep this proof of life to himself.  She takes one look at the parchment and bursts into tears.  After calming down, and mopping her face with Draco’s handkerchief, she sighs.  “Harry is always ‘fine’, even when he isn’t.
“Yes, sorry.  Please, continue.”  Draco braced himself for the words.
.  He wished he could hate him.  It would be so much easier if he could get mad at him, and call him a ferret, and make fun of his inferior seeking skills.   But they weren’t in school anymore, and for the first time in a long time, Harry knew he had no position to claim a moral high ground.  Harry had screwed up, and Draco was well within his rights.  It sucked.  It seemed that, all of the times in his life that Harry had proved himself fallible, weak, it had something to do with Draco.
“Of course you will,” she replied, her voice utterly sure, as though Harry had told her that water was wet, or that the stars came out at night.  Comforted, she bounced back into the living room, and Harry could hear her enlisting Minerva and Severus’ help with convincing Harry to let them have a dog.
“Either did I,” Draco said.  “I didn’t have one this morning.”
He looks thrilled at that, and I may not ever understand house elves.  It seems strange that these little indentured servants would be so desperate to serve, and guilty when they indulge themselves.  In their position, I can’t imagine being so self-sacrificing.  And yet…he cooks amazing dinners, so if I escape to my cabin in the woods, he can come along.
“That’s so dumb.  You don’t even eat anything interesting.”
“Dad had a friend named Cedric, and he got hurt, or maybe died.  Uncle P says that there was some sort of contest and Dad was a contestant, and it was all some sort of plot by Voldemort to hurt Dad.  And he had a Godfather called Sirius, and Dad thinks it was his fault that he died.”
“Please sit.”
“I hated it up here, after,” Draco continues, crossing the floor and coming to stand next to him.  Draco looks out across the silent grounds, and Harry’s grateful Draco doesn’t look at him.
“It was the right thing to do,” Harry’s voice was a little gruff.  It had deepened over the past year.  Coupled with the artfully scruffy stubble he was carrying, Harry had grown into a man.  Draco felt a familiar surge of envy.  What must it be like to be Potter?
“Oh Harry, no.  That’s what you thought?  But didn’t Andromeda tell you?”
“He’s survived death twice.  He killed the Dark Lord.”
“Well, they’re human refuse,” he says, and there’s a note of confidence that makes my spine tingle.
“But I do want a relationship, Draco.  And I want one with the person that I’ve been in love with since I was eighteen years old.  I just…I hope that we can talk about it, and work to have the kind of relationship that works for us,” Harry said earnestly.  Draco was pretty sure that his mouth was hanging open.  It was terribly undignified, and he desperately wanted to change that, but he seemed to have lost the ability to control his body.  “Unless,” Harry continued, looking a bit unsure, “unless you’re not interested.  I’d totally understand.  We have a lot of history, and it might be easier for you to choose someone more suited.”
“We agreed that I’d be allowed an exception on very emotional days.  This counts,” Harry argued.  He kissed the top of her head.  “Let me look at you.”  Cass spun in a circle, her Hogwarts robes billowing behind her.  “Oh yes, you look a proper little swot already.  You know that you’ll be on the train for hours, right?  You don’t need to wear your robes until you’re close to arriving.”
“I supported it.”
“How could he be so fucking stupid?” Dean roars, flinging a canvas at the wall.  “He wouldn’t stop!  I tried everything to make him stop, but he was so fucking stubborn, and he just kept hurting himself!”  Dean is really doing a number on his studio, but Harry understands this.  The guilt, and the helplessness, and the agonizing hole where your heart should be.
Harry’s smile was tight.  “They don’t all live here full-time.  After you-  well, after…I wasn’t really in a very good place, and Hermione and Ron started staying over to make sure I ate and got out of bed and stuff.  They were happy to get a bit of privacy; The Burrow is worse than here, most of the time.  But, eventually, they had school, and work and stuff, and I was…well I wasn’t really okay.  So, Nev and Hannah moved in too.”
“Well, there is one person I know who’d be happy to help.”
“Oh Merlin, Draco.  That was…”
9/27/2021 - I wrote this before I understood formatting or basic rules of English.  Just a tidy-up.
“That tradition has seen its day,” Andromeda replied.
Draco perched uneasily on the couch.  The baby, who had been snuggled in his Grandmother’s arms, reached for Draco, but when he moved to pick him up, Andromeda said “No.  I prefer not.”
“That’s what the Wizengamot said,” Wallace said, a bit sulkily.
Shortly thereafter, Healer Arden appeared at the door.  “How’s everyone here, then?  All sorted?”
I shrug.  “It helped me to understand the difference between how I was and how I am now.  But I don’t know if it’s worth it.”
“I dunno, Draco.  Don’t you talk to your friends?”
“Of course not,” he snaps.  “There are good Purebloods, and I have no interest in punishing them.”
“What wife?  Potter, what are you talking about?”
“What did I tell you it was?”
Draco looks up.  “Yes, I think he’s really happy.”  Draco
“Well, that’s good, then,” Hermione said, a little uncertainly.  Draco thought about saying more, but it was too complicated, too difficult, too much like admitting it to himself.  After a long moment, each of them examining their thoughts and finding them too weighty to share, Hermione said, “Do you suppose we should work on the potion?”
“He’s stubborn,” she said, with forced lightness.  “Always has been.”
“That I’ve deliberately miscalculated the formula, so that when I administer it to Harry, I’ll kill him.”  Saying the words filled Draco with a shame so great he wanted to weep.  He saw a vision of Harry, lying, tiny and still, on the floor of his lab.
.  Draco had managed to stay away for the past four years, because he’d kept himself going with thoughts of Harry happily with his She-Weasel.  It seemed that somehow everything had gotten cocked up.  Draco wasn’t a brave man, and he was very, very seldom an honourable one.  If his sacrifice hadn’t worked, if he’d left Harry here sad, and thin and broken somehow, well, Draco was going to fucking well find out how this had happened.
, it follows.”
“What I know, sure.  It was strange, Harry.  We got separated, and the wards ejected me, but you were trapped inside.”
The office, when he arrived, was busy, team members coming off shift, replacements arriving.  Their boss, a no-nonsense witch named Juniper Buckley, who reminded Harry of Minerva McGonagall, hustled them into the conference room for the Thursday meeting.  Tamsin and Harry found seats at the back of the room.  The Thursday meeting was where assignments and special projects were doled out, and Harry and Tamsin always had the same assignment.  Tamsin occupied herself by levitating a quill off the table, sending it to tickle the ear of Linden Nettle, a man who she and Harry both loathed.
“Oh, okay then,” she sneers.
She gives me a bit of a superior look, but underneath it, I can see the fire of a warrior who protects those who can’t protect themselves.  “No, Harry.  It doesn’t work that way.”
“You know,” she says, her kind face hardening a little, “one of the things I always found interesting about you, was how you insisted on doing things without help.  It’s always been this way.  But you’ve never needed to go it alone.  And you’ve always been more successful when you let your friends help you.”
“What was that?”
She perched on the arm of Harry’s chair.  “It went well,” she said.  “They’re finding common ground.”
“Nah, she’s likely to tell mum, and nobody wants that.  If you think Hermione nags…I’ll figure out a story that will satisfy them all.”
“Your birthday is over, and so we need to decide what happens now.  Scorpius is, thank Merlin, all better, so we don’t have to stay, but I wanted to know what you'd like.”  Cass bit her lip, in such a Harry-esque gesture that he smiled.  “Don’t worry about how I’m going to take the news, just tell me.”
“If we had another, it’s not like we would love him any less than Scorpius.”
known.  Harry had taken that choice away from him. Ignoring, for the time being, the fact that he hadn’t been honest with Harry either, he clung to his wounded pride for as long as he could before he realized that none of his self justification mattered.  Whether or not his choice had been untenable, he’d loved Harry desperately for every moment they’d been apart.  His heart, feeble thing that it was, had longed for him since he’d said goodbye.  Ironic, that, in trying to do the right thing, he’d without a doubt, repeated the same short-sighted patterns of his youth.
“W-when you were about three?  I think?  It’s hard to tell.”
“He doesn’t usually smell like that.  Normally he smells…great”
“I don’t care, Draco.  We can’t just keep sitting here, hoping that someone’s going to reach out.  Potter has more connections than anyone else.  It’s stupid not to use them.”
Uncertain for a moment, Draco merely stared at the baby, whose cries for his mother soon dissolved into heartbroken sobs.  Finally, his feet seemed to make the decision for him, and Draco found himself crossing the room to the crib, and scooping the baby into his arms.  Harry clung to him, still screaming.  “Hush,” Draco whispered, his heart thumping in his ears, fervently attempting to not think of the snot that was likely dripping down Harry’s face.  “Please, Harry, it’s okay.”
As it turns out, Harry was just trying to wind Draco up, and he has no opinion on what the baby should wear, so the three of them make it to Hogwarts nearly on time.  Hermione, when they arrive, has a list several inches long that she’s frantically going over, and she’s doing a terrible job at hiding her annoyance at their lateness.   Harry, to his credit, kisses her cheek, reminds her that Scorpius isn’t going to remember whether they started on time, and firmly shoves Ron at her when she continues to witter on.
“You’re no better,” Nettle said to Tamsin.  “Washed up, aren’t you?  One mistake away from getting the sack.”
“Harry, this is a time to celebrate, a time for family to be together,” Narcissa chided gently.
“You look different.”
“The house is sleeping?”  Kreacher had told me about this, how Wizarding houses were almost sentient, and they sometimes intercede when the residents misbehave.  “Isn’t it going to like me?”
The Hogwarts Express had already arrived by the time that they walked through the pillar.  Children were piling from the doors, and there was a noisy, excited buzz as families everywhere reconnected.  Draco was glad for his height, as it allowed him to peer over the crowds and keep an eye out.  “Do you see them?”  The voice next to him was brimming with excitement.
“I don’t think that’s fair, though,” Harry said, wishing he were able to say things properly.  “I’m happy to say nothing about Cass’ other parent, but I wouldn’t dream of denying you, if you wanted to make it public.  I’d prefer to know what you’d rather.”
“That was an amazing shag, Draco.”
“Of course I didn’t fucking know!” Draco was feeling frantic.  He had to leave, he would just push Hermione over and run upstairs and dive into the floo and go home.  Or maybe he’d just apparate back to Canada right now.  He was pretty sure there were laws preventing it, and he’d probably end up in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean somewhere, but anything would be preferable to finding himself in Harry fucking Potter’s fucking kitchen.
“Thanks, Ron,” I’m still feeling fond of him as I apparate home.  My bruised feelings are soothed a little, knowing that Ron’s got my back.  As I walk through the door of my flat, there’s an almighty clattering at my window.  Clearly, an owl’s been lying in wait for me to arrive home.  I let it in, but it’s another one who disappears the second I untie the parchment, without waiting for a reply.
Suddenly, Harry gave him an inscrutable look.  “So you’re not at all interested in me?  You don’t feel that way about me at all?”
“No, not exactly.  I just was overconfident about how I fit in.  It hurt to realize that I didn’t measure up…again.” Harry’s voice trails off at the last word, as the truth of the statement hits him.  He blinks hard to combat the unexpected tears that have welled up.
“Yes, this is where I grew up.  Welcome to Malfoy Manor.”
They’d been sitting quietly, for quite some time, when Harry’s voice came through the darkness.  “It’s so stupid, you know, but I always considered her sort of a…compensation, I guess.  Like the universe had been keeping score, and Cass was to make up for all the people I’d lost, all the shite things that had happened.”
“You’re right.  I don’t agree that you’re making the right decision, but it is your decision.  I care about you, Harry.  I want to keep being your friend.”  It isn’t the unconditional validation that he’d secretly desired, but, he reminds himself, this is why he never asks for anything.  People can’t disappoint you if you don’t expect anything.  He doesn’t know what to say, so he doesn’t say anything, and eventually, Luna goes back inside.  They’ve addressed it, anyhow, and while a part of him knows that their relationship will never be the same, he won’t feel like he has to avoid her completely anymore.
Hermione whispers back “I know.”
“You deserve it.  Truly, Harry.”
“I warned you,” Harry said, rolling his eyes at Draco.  “She’s absolutely heartless.”
In the morning, he felt Harry’s erection against his hip, and the stupid, brainless part of him wanted to grind into it.  But he forfeited that right long ago, so he drew away.  Harry’s hand outstretched for a moment, but then he sighed, and remained asleep.  Draco watched for a second, his heart so full of love and regret that he could have thrown up.  He didn’t though.  Instead, he put his robes back on, and summoned a parchment and quill.
“I s’pose,” Rose said with a world-weary sigh.
“We just need to get creative.  Maybe we could use a potion ingredient that is magical in nature?  Plants, maybe?  I don’t think that a conjured animal is giving us the right data."
“Training.  I’m afraid it’s not that exciting.”
“He forgets stuff, like, way more than usual.  And sometimes, I see him looking around all confused, like he can’t remember how he got where he was.  And sometimes the way he looks at Gin, like he doesn’t even know who she is.”
As Harry stood to leave, Draco had grabbed his arm.  “Wait.  Do you really think that?  Is that how you think I see you?”
“So will you help me?”
“First of all, I'm not convinced that Dumbledore didn't lay that out like a fucked up scavenger hunt to train his little pet sacrifice.  And secondly, I only saved the fucking thing because I had friends helping me,” I protest, and then my brain finally catches up.  It’s time to fall back on the secret to my success.  “Draco, can I call Hermione and Ron?”
“It is,” Cici said.  “They’re both still sleeping, but their magic and vital signs look good.  You can come in and be here when they wake up.”
“Hermione, I’d like you to meet Scorpius, my son.”
Kingsley is next on the stand, and as the Verituserum is administered, he glares at me and Draco.  Draco’s hand on my arm tightens, and I barely notice that I’ve drawn closer to him.
“He was always a bit oblivious, but being unaware of his own potion addiction is a stretch.  We should know soon whether he has anything strange in his bloodstream, something not accounted for by the potions we
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Harry, just shut up a moment, will you?”  Draco’s voice sounded exhausted.  Harry noted absently that Draco had used his name, and, remembering the way he’d once said it, Harry felt his knees weaken a little.  He swayed, but then caught himself, and straightened his spine.  He cast a longing look at the floo, but remained where he was, waiting to be dismissed.  Finally, Draco said, “Look, I know we need to talk, but I just can’t tonight.  Do you understand?”
“So did it?”
“Alright.  Before I go, I have something for you.  A little ‘welcome to Hogwarts’ treat.”  Harry opened his trunk with a wave of his wand, and wordlessly summoned the gift.  The fabric still felt like spun silver, and Harry ran his hand over it fondly.  “This is one of the few heirlooms that I have to pass along to you.  I was only a little older than you are now when it was given to me, and believe me, we will discuss some guidelines for its use when we return home.  In the meantime, let me show you what it does.”  Harry put the cloak on, grinning at the gasp of shock from his daughter.
“No, Harry, I know you won’t.”
“I tried really hard,” Harry confessed.  “I tried so hard to give Cass a childhood that was different from mine.  I wanted so much for her to feel like she had power over the decisions that impacted her, and to be a strong support when she needed it.  It was really important to me not to perpetuate the cycle.  It was so important that she felt safe to ask for what she needed, because…I’m not very experienced in asking for what I need.  At the time, I didn’t realize that I was taking all of the pain and rejection I felt from my own childhood and trying to be the opposite of it.  I didn’t see that I had starting defining myself as Cass’ Dad…as only Cass’ Dad, and when…”
I grin.  “I’m going to eat ice cream.”
“Yeah.  I needed something different.”
I tuck the declaration away in my mind to consider later.  I feel like it’s some sort of hint to old Harry.  “I don’t want any duties, though.  I’ve done enough.”
They groaned good-naturedly, and sent him a suggestive leer as they stared interestedly at Harry.  Draco didn’t bother to introduce them.  Not until he knew why Harry was here.
“How do you move in this stuff?”
“Yes.”
“I didn’t do much,” Draco admitted, “Ron and Hermione would have found you.”
"An enemy?"
“Yeah, probably.  Just seems weird that the potions smugglers have disappeared without a trace now.”
“I wasn’t sure if I could stand saying it to you and not hearing it back.”
Crying wasn’t allowed, but Harry was crying, and so maybe Harry wasn’t allowed.  He had lost Darkness, and he had lost Blanket.  All he had left was Safe, and so he decided that he would fight to keep it.
“You’re sure you won’t go out with me?”
“No thank you,” Harry replies kindly.  His eyes are far away.  He’s already left.
“I submit a challenge.” Hermione’s voice is forceful as hell now, and the Unspeakable freezes.
“So, my family had sworn their loyalty to Lord Voldemort, as Riddle came to be called, long before I was born.  When Harry and I were babies, Voldemort disappeared, and Harry was whispered about as the Boy who Lived.  My family, threatened by the notion that a half-blooded baby could vanquish their great hope, told me that Harry Potter was nothing more than a piece of propaganda, used to frighten Purebloods.  I grew up at my Father’s knee, hearing that the Dark Lord would someday return, and that he would crush Harry Potter beneath his boot.”
It would have to do, because that was all Harry had.  He didn’t care about anything else.
It didn’t take Harry long to get Scorpius’ home address sent to his Galleon.  He ensured that the Obliviation Squad had everything in hand, and let the Secretary know that he’d be taking Scorpius home.  She noted the information down, and sent them on their way, and, after finding a discrete spot, Harry side-alonged Scorpius to a loading dock behind a grocery store.  The walk from there was pleasant, as Scorpius’ neighbourhood was a nice one.
Finally, he spoke.  “I don’t,” he said seriously.  “I don’t regret it at all.  I call magical abilities a gift, because that’s truly what I believe that they are.  It changed my life, if I were to lose my magic somehow, I would feel like I had a hole inside of me.”
They do.  And it’s a slightly poorer, and much more stylish me that floos home several hours later with an entirely new wardrobe.  I survey myself in the mirror and wish that I had time to get a haircut before my date with Draco, but since I don’t, I use a potion I find in my bathroom cabinet to try to make the bird’s nest on my head simmer down a little.  After a few experiments, one of which forces me to shower the whole lot off and start over, my hair looks mad, still, but more ‘windswept’ and less ‘pulled backwards through a hedge’.
“Easier said than done.”
“Harry’s addicted to some sort of potion.”
“Do you think the day will come when you don’t have to take care of me?”
They returned at 10:50 promptly, Scorpius carefully carrying a brown paper bag, while Draco followed with a cup of tea.  “Mrs. Nott,” Scorpius said excitedly.  “I brought you a present!  And I ate six bites!”
The next song ends, and clearly he’s still pondering…whatever, because he says, “Do you want a drink?”
“Oh, right,” Ron said.  “Bugger.  I’ll have to tell her and Gin that he’s away on a mission.”
Hermione laughed out loud.  “That’s a shame, Scorpius.  We’ll miss having you.  Perhaps your Papa and I could meet tomorrow, and then we’ll see you another time.”
The scroll was actually two pieces of parchment.  One contained a huge amount of writing, and unsurprisingly, it was from Hermione:
“Draco,” Harry whispers.
“True,” Harry concedes. “If only I’d been better.  Faster.” The guilt weighs heavily, some days, and Harry dreams of those they’ve lost nearly every night.
“It isn’t funny,” Draco says, whirling around to glare at Pansy.  “That was an enormous leap of faith.  How did you know he’d be that way?”
Harry had just gotten into the story of his first encounter with Draco in Madame Malkin’s, when a knock sounded at the door.  It was a house elf, bearing a letter from Hermione.
“Mom’s going to flip out,” George warned Ron, who paled.  “You just arrested her baby girl.”
Harry grins easily, the three fire-whiskies he’s consumed making the blood pump warmly through his heart, his living, beating heart.  “Not in the slightest,” he assures her.  “Sometimes I can’t believe it’s real, though.  That this world is ours now, and we’re safe.”
“Yes,” Harry said simply.  The truth was that Hermione’s parents had never returned from Australia after the war.  They got their memories back, but they were quite upset by it all, and their relationship with Hermione remained a bit strained.
Harry’s like a short, lithe octopus, arms and legs surrounding Draco as though he’d like to climb inside him.  Draco accepts the armful of passionate Wizard joyfully, and staggers backward onto the bed.  “Harry,” Draco breathes frantically into Harry’s ear.  “I want you to fuck me.  I want you to fuck me so hard I feel it for days.”
“Do you hate it here?”
“Well,” Draco said thoughtfully, “I do recall some potion makers that were a bit more Knockturn than Diagon, if you know what I mean.  I could put out a few feelers, if you like.”
“I’m not really mad about you lying about us being friends.  I guess I understand.  But it’s just…a lot.  Would you mind if I stayed with Ron and Hermione for a bit?”
“Good.  Too many people shout at you.  Greg went to his room, but he told me to let you know that he’d ‘warded our rooms like he meant it’ and that the house elves would let him know if I left them.”
“Harry, dear, you haven’t called me Professor in years.  I know that you are surprised to hear me bring up a name from your past, and I’ll admit, I did consider that it might be kinder not to discuss this with you.  In the end, however, I decided that you have long past earned the right to make these sorts of decisions for yourself.”  Harry noticed Snape nodding approvingly, and it bolstered him a bit.
Molly’s tears were more effusive than Hermione’s.  She gripped his shoulders, cried, pulled him close, cried, and pushed him to arm’s length so that she could look at him.  “Still too thin, but you look happy,” she decided.
“What do you seek, beloved?”
“Yes, obviously.  I think we might have to leave the country, actually.  For a bit, anyway.”
“Fine.  Broken nose, black eye, both healed.  You broke two different photographers’ equipment in the scuffle.”
“I think he has, ‘Dromeda.  Scorpius is perfectly lovely, and Draco doesn’t seem even remotely Death-Eatery.  It’s early though, and there’s
“Salazar,” she says, the smile falling.  “You don’t remember me at all?”
“DMLE bureaucracy at its finest.  The policy said we all needed to take it, so it wouldn’t have mattered what Harry said.”
Harry stiffened for a moment, as though he realized who was holding him, but said, “She is.  She’s going to be fine, and she’s going to grow up and be a brilliant witch.”  His tears seemed to have abated, and, reluctantly, Draco let him go, standing up to resume his seat on Cass’ other side.
“Yeah!  I wish I could go!”
“You haven’t seen a Healer.”
“So we’ll just hope for the best, then?”
“If she has dosed him, do you think that he’ll de-age again?” Hermione asked worriedly.
“You want a protective amulet for a three-year-old?  Potter, these aren’t exactly trinkets.”
“I expect she was upset that you hadn’t told her you were back.”
“I don’t think that will happen,” Harry said soothingly.
“You’re very smart, you know.”
“Oh.  Good.”  He toyed with a rack of clean phials; with a wave of his wand, he made them float up and do an elaborate circle dance his mother had made him learn as a child.  “Things are going to change.  Tomorrow.”
Pansy led him down a dark hall, and Draco swore it felt familiar.  They were about to go down some stairs when a familiar voice said, “Draco”.  Draco turned to find Blaise standing at the other end of the hall.
“Did you hear that, Papa?”
“That’s mad,” Draco grumbled.
“Well,” Draco said.  “let’s see what the toxicology potions tell us.”  As part of his consultancy with the DMLE, Draco had developed a screening potion that scanned for common hallucinogens.  He’d added Harry’s blood to the potion earlier, and had been simmering it all afternoon.  Ladling some into a clear vial, he compared the colour of the potion to the laminated chart he had posted on the wall.  It didn’t match any of them.  “Well, he’s negative for Gillyweed, Angel’s Kiss, Euphoria, Devil’s throat and Sundance,” Draco said, reading off the list.  “I hadn’t thought to test him for a love potion, but, unless there’s a new strain of hallucinogen, I think your theory has merit.”
“Alright.”  Harry felt himself go rigid with terror.
“If that’s what he’s doing,” Cass said.
“Well, you manage the budget, and you attend Wizengamot, that’s our judicial system, meetings, you’d be the public face of the Aurors, and work with the press to communicate things.  You’d be responsible for ensuring that policies and procedures are followed by your team.  You’ll sign off on all arrest reports, and be responsible for tactical operations.”
“No, I broke their Jenny’s heart,” I answer.
“Well, I can understand that,” Draco said gloomily.  “I’ve struggled with the same thing since the first day I met him.”
“Not exactly, Harry.  Although,” Hermione cast a fairly helpless look at Draco, “I guess there were times when you felt a bit bullied.”
“Waiting for true love?”
Harry settled onto the sofa, with Cass snuggled up against him.  He pulled a blanket over them both, and smoothed her wild hair down as he picked up where he’d left off previously.
I sort of figured I would, but it turns out, I really like sex.  It provides an immediacy of feedback that’s so much less confusing than everything else.  I figure that old me must have watched a lot of porn, because I instinctively know what to do.  My hands are confident and sure, and all I have to do is trust myself.  It’s brilliant.
Narcissa completed her telling with a compliment guaranteed to please Harry.  “Harry, you must be awfully proud of Cass.  She’s so mature.”
“Ah, I see, so he’s still to be shunned, and excluded from society, but not outright persecuted.  Remind me, Kingsley, were we trying to entice a new Dark Lord to rise?”
Harry liked Narcissa Malfoy very much, but he sometimes hated the knowing, subtle way she said things.  It left him feeling simple-minded and inadequate.  “I’ll try not to,” he replied, hoping that she wouldn’t press the issue.  “I should get back and check on Cass, though.  Thank you for the talk.”
“They were on the bad side?”
“Oh.  It’s good to see you, though.”
“I don’t really have a budget, Draco.  Whatever material you think best, as many protective spells as you can manage to add.  A portkey.  And…no, never mind,” he says.
“I didn’t think it was about winning or losing,” Harry said quietly.
“Where’s Dean?” Harry asks.
“I don’t understand why you won’t explain.”
sake.  “Thank you,” I say, and I’m thrilled that I betray none of my annoyance at her cryptic story, which helped in absolutely no way at all.
“Mostly,” Draco said.  “When Astoria and I married, we wanted a child very much, and Astoria has always wanted to be a lawyer, so we agreed that I’d need to work in a role that allowed me to stay home.  So I like the flexibility, and the curse breaking is quite fun.”
“Depending on how long it takes us to get Scorpius’ outbursts sorted, you might need to consider putting him in a less mainstream environment.  There have been some studies about Obliviation, and the data suggests that we really ought to avoid doing it more than a couple of times.  It's not really fair to the staff at Scorpius' school to keep taking their memories.”
“Important enough to let your friends go to Azkaban?”
“But…Have you talked to her?”
“What happened to her?  The Aunt?”
“You don’t even try anymore, though.”
to maintain.  Besides, if I have any hope of being seen as more than just a Death Eater, I have to be above reproach.”
“I have your blessing,” Draco said, smiling.
So when can I see you play hockey?
“You’re brave, though,” Draco says lightly.  His hand is solid on Harry’s forearm, sure, and solid.
Harry shrugged.  “I’ve been having trouble with my coffee maker lately,” he admitted.  “I seem to be relying on the kindness of friends for my caffeine fix.”
“Is that a thing?”
“Of course it’s okay.  You’re Harry’s family.”
In the dim light, Draco could see movement as Harry shook his head.  Finally, though, he said, “Draco?”
“Yes, both parents need to have the same genetic anomaly for this condition to exist.  If either of you had a child with another parent, the risks are much lower, if that’s something that you wish to consider.  But because the baby would only be a half-sibling, there’s no certainty that they’d be a match.  The hematopoietic growth factors will allow us to manage Scorpius’ condition for some time, but it’s difficult to estimate how long.  There’s no guarantee.”
The waiter
Draco held the parchment so tightly that it crumpled.  To have been so close to his most treasured desire, and then let his instincts chase it away…he wanted to howl, to beat his fists against the wall, to climb into his bed and never emerge.  He did none of those, however, and merely sat down unsteadily at the table, and breathed, and examined his hands.
“Harry.  I know that you’re angry, and so hurt.  And I caused that hurt, and I don’t deserve anything from you.  And yes, I was a fucking coward, just like fucking always. But could you let me tell you what happened from my perspective?  Just so that I can say I tried?”
Hermione gives me another one of her unreadable looks.  “It’s just, you never manage to get left alone in Diagon.”
Harry hesitated.  “Um…sure, I guess.”
“I’m not sure.”
I’m not sure how long I sit, my mind blank.  True, I don’t remember any of the shared history that Hermione and I have, but she and Ron are the link to my past.  The only link, it seems.  I don’t regret my harsh words, but I wish she hadn’t been hurt.  It’s frustrating, though, being treated as though I’m witless because I don’t remember what’s happened before.  Well, it seems that I’ve experience with going it alone.  None of the day’s activities are making my imaginary cabin in the woods sound less appealing.
“So,” he said, with a little smile.  “Do you like hockey?”
As he knocks on the door, he notices that his hands are shaking, but it doesn’t matter.  The woman who answers it is startlingly like Aunt Bellatrix in appearance, but has infinitely kinder eyes.  “Draco Malfoy?” Her tone isn’t welcoming, exactly, but it’s not angry either.
“Yes, you prat, which you’d know if you’d paid any attention at any Order meetings.”
“Oh yes.  No fresh air to be had in the Scottish Highlands, certainly,” Minerva said.
Draco smiled.  “You could try, but they ward the doors.”
able to help others.  If you’re responsible for the care of someone else, and you become unconscious due to lack of oxygen, you’ll never be able to help others.  Do you see how this analogy is relevant to your circumstances?”
It was the hardest thing he’d ever done.  “I don’t,” Draco said.
“Do I get a stick?”  Harry was eying Draco’s hockey stick with interest.
Draco felt his eyebrows lifting as he struggled weakly to answer.  “Harry, I-”
Without giving it another thought, he spins on his heel and apparatus to London.  He stands outside a door for several moments, catching his breath, and trying to think of something to say.
“Well, that makes two of us,” Draco muttered.
Well, Draco thought, that would have to wait for another time, because he was getting the fuck out of this madhouse.  He gave her a tight smile, and when she moved aside, he continued moving towards the kitchen door.  Only to walk smack into Harry Potter.  He froze, and Harry did the same.  “Draco?” his voice was tiny, disbelieving.
Now though, he had pride at stake, and picturing Draco’s outraged face wasn’t making things any easier.  Despite his efforts to subdue his mirth, the giggles bubbled up inside him, and he was unable to suppress a little snort, which fed his panic and before he knew it, he was shaking with silent laughter.  The absurdity of the situation made everything funnier.  Tears rolled onto the pillow, and he gasped, and shook, and giggled until suddenly Draco snapped, “Oh for fuck’s sake, what’s so funny?  Lumos.”
I’m listlessly flipping through a magazine when the floo roars to life, and Ron steps out.  I look at him warily.  I don’t have it in me to argue, and no doubt he’s annoyed that I made his wife cry.  “Hey mate,” he says easily, “do you have any beer?”
“That’s a lovely name,” Harry replied.  “Is this your Mum and Dad?”  Violet nodded.  “And is this your house?”  Another nod.  “Well, because I’m very good at sorting out mysteries, I’m going to also say that it’s your birthday party.  How old are you, Violet?”
At breakfast, Cass was surprised when Papa said, “I’d like to introduce you to Scorpius’ tutor today.  If you’re going to be here for some time, we can’t ignore your education, and I wanted you to have some choices.  If you’d rather go to a local school, we can arrange that, although it might be harder to adjust to a different educational program.  Homeschooling is quite common amongst wizarding families, so I thought you could see if you liked Bertram, and we could discuss.”
When he paused to take a breath, Draco spotted his chance, and cut in smoothly.  “So, today, Scorpius, do you remember our plans?”
With the help of Scorpius’ favourite house elf, Kattie, it wasn’t long before both Draco and Scorpius were bathed, dressed and sitting at the breakfast table.  Scorpius was happily describing to Draco the eating habits of the Hungarian Horntail, his current favourite breed of Dragon.
“So you’re not speaking with him?”
I don’t know exactly what she means, but I am confused.  “Even if I wanted to, I don’t have the ability to do anything,” I say.  “ The people that are doing this are powerful, politically.  I wouldn’t know the first thing about trying to outsmart them.  Someone was powerful enough to steal all of my memories.  I don’t think that a summoning spell is going to be enough, if I decided to fight them.”
“Draco.”
“Daddy?”
“Not much.  Harry was undercover, and he was in a warehouse,” Ron says.  He’s obviously cadged a biscuit from the kitchen, and he speaks in between bites.  “He was an idiot who didn’t call for backup, and, because he’s an idiot,” this said with a fairly dark look in my direction, “he went in alone-”
“Yes.  But this could be my chance to see what it would be like to…to…have him look at me like I wasn’t worthless.”
“End what?”
of a child and still treat them cruelly.
“Not sure what about.  It was all whispers, and grabbed arms.”
“You did hurt me,” he says, when it becomes clear that she’s waiting for him to speak.  “Not because what you said was untrue, but because of your presumption that you have any right to judge my choice of lifestyle.”
“I do,” I agree.
Current Custodial Parent: Harry James Potter
“Of course not.  It would be very confusing.”
“Feels a bit that way.  There’s a lot of stuff we haven’t talked about.”
Harry’s smile was brilliant.  “You’re so good,” he said in wonder.  “I’m so lucky.  Did my cousin Dudley go to magic school?”
“You’re alive?  You’re sure you’re alive?”
Draco felt as though an enormous weight had been lifted from his shoulders.  Tears swam in his eyes for a moment before he blinked them away, and said, “Hermione, thank you.  Truly.  I owe you a great debt.”

“I’m not, Harry.  Draco continues to know nothing of your life, and the decision lies with you.  But, I wanted you to know that you had the opportunity to help, and be able to make the decision with all the information.”
It’s past two when Harry’s bedroom door flings open.  Harry’s on his feet, wand in hand before his eyes are focused.  As he realizes who it is, his wand arm drops to his side.
Two weeks pass.  Harry tells himself: Draco is marrying someone else in four weeks.  He wants to go home. Hermione tells him that he shouldn’t be surrounded by memories.  He stays, the spare bedroom at Ron and Hermione’s bland and impersonal.  Ron takes him flying most nights after he gets home from the Ministry, and Harry stops looking up hopefully every time an owl appears.  They’re never from Draco.
“No worries, Harry, I won’t take my eyes off of her.”
stay out too late, it turned out.  They’d nearly identified all of the potential ingredients, and had started putting together some preliminary diagnostic formulas when suddenly Draco’s face nearly split apart with an enormous yawn. “Oh Merlin,” Hermione said, casting Tempus.  “I have to go, I had no idea it had gotten so late.  Are you sure you don’t want me to take Harry back with me?”
“So you keep telling me.”
Harry’s heart broke in two.  “Oh, darling,” he said gently.  “I know this is so hard, and so confusing.  He carefully removed the mug from Malcolm’s trembling hands, and said, “You don’t have to say yes if you don’t want to, but would you like to hold my hand when we go?”  Malcolm gave him a tiny, almost imperceptible nod.  Harry smiled, and held out his hand.  Together, they selected a change of clothing for tomorrow, and retrieved Malcolm’s toothbrush from the loo.  Harry conjured a little rucksack shaped like a dragon.  He surreptitiously performed a diagnostic charm behind Malcolm’s back.  There were some minor bruises, but nothing requiring medical treatment.  He transposed the results into his notebook.
The stag listens carefully to Harry, edging closer and tilting its head curiously.  Then Harry says “But he’s gone forever, and soon he’ll be fucking Astoria, and she’ll be having his children”.  The stag dissipates.  Harry doesn’t bother to try to conjure it again.
“Yes,” she says, and I’d bet even money that’s a look of doubt on her face.  “We’ve talked about getting married.”
It was a matter of moments to arrive at Luna’s strange, rook-shaped home.  Malcolm didn’t enjoy apparation, and was sick into the dirigible plum bush, but Harry assured him that Luna wouldn’t mind.  He knocked on the door, Malcolm shivering like a leaf beside him.  Luna opened the door and regarded them both for a moment.
“I could go looking for the information myself.”
“Do you think that’s a good idea?”  Again, the words weren’t unkind, exactly, just, cool.  Neville had lost all of the shy fearful composure that he carried at Hogwarts.  In its place was a quiet, confident man.
“I don’t know,” I say, honestly.  “But hopefully, I’ll remember how much I don’t hate you right now.”
“No,” Draco whispered.
“Do you need me to tell everyone?”  It will be awful, he thinks, to have to reach out to their friends, and tell them this news.  But he’ll do it for Draco.
“Go and prepare yourself for the day, Master Malfoy.  Kreacher is taking Small Master Harry Potter and caring for him.”  Kreacher extended his long skinny arms towards the baby, who squealed in delight and pitched himself out of Draco’s arms.  Kreacher chuckled, and caught him, disappearing quickly from the room.  Draco could faintly hear Kreacher’s croaky voice, and Harry’s high pitched responses, and he vaguely hoped that Harry wasn’t demonstrating his new vocabulary.  He spelled Harry’s sheets to the laundry, and cast a Scourgify on every surface.  It wasn’t enough, it was never enough, but Draco knew that if he got out his cleaning supplies, the day would be lost.
“I get that.  I believe you.  But I don’t remember it.  He hasn’t said a single thing to me to make me think he’s still like that.”
“How do you know?”
“I promise I’m not.”
“Stop,” Draco said firmly.  “Harry, what are you trying to do?”
Harry glared at her.  She was going to further shame him by mocking his failure. “You know.”
“I do too.”
“Partly, yes. I never wanted you to be part of the spectacle.  I hated the amount of attention I got, especially since it was for no good reason.”
Instead, he gave Harry a searching look, and said “We can go get a beer, or we can go to my place.  You choose.”  He knew he was giving Harry nothing, but the rules had all changed, and Draco didn’t know how to do this.  He’d been so good.  He’d been so adult, and he’d let Harry do what he needed to do, and he’d sucked up the fact that he’d made a terrible mistake, and things had been so hard.  He wasn’t a saint, and he couldn’t give Harry another inch.
As I follow Kingsley to my desk, I can’t help but wonder, why did old me want this job anyway?  My desk is obsessively tidy, with small piles of parchment, tabbed and carefully annotated in tiny writing.  It seems incongruous with the type of student that Hermione and Ron described, but clearly I’ve developed new habits.  I find the file about the potions smugglers easily, and I ask Kingsley if someone can owl it to my house.  I don’t want to go home yet, but I’m a bit at loose ends.
After learning that even Severus was fond of Potter, Draco had resolved to stop speaking ill of him, at least in front of his daughter.  It put her on the defensive, and it made Draco feel things he didn’t wish to feel.  He was about to suggest that he show Cass the Library, when an almighty howling emerged from the bedrooms upstairs.
Harry’s face broke into a wide smile, and he turned in the direction of the voice.  Hermione was elbowing her way through the crowd, intent on reaching them as efficiently as possible.  Behind her, Ron’s bright red hair was visible, trying in vain to make his way politely in their direction.
“Draco,” I know my smile is flirtatious, but I’m going to push until he makes me stop.  “You look good.  Did you dress up for me?”
“Really?” Harry asked.  “I always did.  I used to always have to roll the cuffs of my trousers up, but just before my birthday, I could always roll them a little less.”
I grin.  “With Luna?  Who knows.  The essence of my personality or something.”
“You’re sure hell hasn’t frozen over?”
Over time though, the secrecy had begun to bother Harry.  “I just wanted to have a pint in the Leaky.  Hell, even the Hog's Head.  I know you value your privacy, Draco, but I’m starting to think that you’re ashamed of me.”
“You’re overthinking this, Harry.  Did you stop to question how to fly, how to catch the snitch?  Of course not.  From the moment you took off after Neville’s Rememberall, you went by instinct.  Now, we’ve protected all your breaky bits, so just stop thinking.  Just catch me.”  With that, Draco took off down the ice at a fairly slow pace, pivoting on his right skate to give Harry a cheeky look and skated backwards to watch what happened next.
Harry sat.  “Long time, Malfoy.”
“Thank Merlin!”  I hear Draco’s voice, and I try to respond, but everything’s heavy, and tired, and I slip into sleep again.
“This is so fucked up.” Draco is angry, but Harry places a stilling hand on his arm.
“No!” The woman shouted this, before exchanging a wide-eyed look with her husband and saying, “Everything’s fine.”
Hermione’s eyes were kind.  “I hope that you both can find some peace, then.”
And yet.  Harry wanted to see him.  Draco longed to be himself again, whole, like he’d been before his terrible sixth year, when the stresses of his tasks had finally twisted his mind.  Before the eventual defeat of the Dark Lord had made him realize that his every action had terrible consequences, and that he wasn’t the man he’d thought he was.  Before he resolved, with no doubt whatsoever, that his judgement was so flawed that he couldn’t be trusted.
“Quite.” Andromeda’s thin lips quirked into a small rictus that might be mistaken for a smile, if Draco hadn’t grown up in a house with very similar lips making very similar shapes.  “I’m sure you know that he’s betrothed to Ginerva Weasley?”
“You might be a Slytherin yet,” Draco mused.
After that, it was a series of stolen moments, Draco stealing into Harry’s house at Grimmauld Place late at night, climbing the stairs to his room and Harry fucking him into the mattress.  Frantic, filthy letters sent by owl each time one of them had a spare second.  For three weeks, they spent as much time together as they could, kissing, talking, making love.  Draco had never felt more happy, and more hopeful.
Resolve spent, Harry bucked his hips wildly, knowing exactly what angle to hit to land on Draco’s prostate.  Draco completely came apart under him, his breath in frantic pants, groaning.  With a sharp cry, Draco came, spurting his seed across his belly.  Watching his lover fall apart, and feeling the pulse of his greedy arse, Harry followed him, filling Draco with his seed.  When they both were spent, Harry lazily cast a cleansing charm on them, and snuggled close to Draco.   “You’re my very favourite,” he whispered to Draco, before falling, adorably, to sleep.
“Yeah,” Harry said.  “Yeah, alright.”
“I did try a new thing.  I tried not shouting at you for climbing the cabinets like a monkey, and look where that’s gotten me.”
He spends a lot of time with Hagrid, which helps, and some time with Vincent Peachley, the Defence Professor that Minerva hired the previous year.  Vincent went to school at Dumstrang, and so he is unimpressed by the ‘Chosen One’ rhetoric.  He’s a decent enough bloke.  The accent and his quiet manner remind him a little of Krum, who Harry always liked.  It’s enough, Harry tells himself, and he tries to ignore the voice in his head that wonders if Luna is right, if he’s just settling for what he has, instead of trying to find something he wants.  The voice, irritatingly, sounds an awful lot like Snape, and Harry takes its advice about as well as he’d taken it from the real Snape, which is to say that he answers the voice in his head snottily, and defensively, and then lies awake pondering it late into the night.
“Were you not compatible?”
Bringing his hand to his mouth, Harry slowly licked Draco’s come from each of his fingers.  “Do you have any idea how fucking sexy you look, doing that?” Draco growled.  Harry smiled a kittenish little smirk, popping his index finger into his mouth, his eyes closing halfway as he savoured Draco’s essence.
That pattern continues for another six months, until the seventh, when the scrap of parchment simply says,
“You didn’t have to, though.  You’ve already done enough for everyone.  Thank you for that too, I suppose.  Really though, why did you do this for me?”
“Is that why you never go out?”
soft parts, and he’d never been told that they were worth shielding.
Draco didn’t recall what, if anything, he said to Andromeda before leaving, apparating home and taking his Mother to the restaurant.  He was in a daze, politely responding to his Mother’s comments, choosing a drink, and what he wanted to eat.
“My Father asked to speak to me in private.  His mind had broken, really.  He didn’t, in any way, resemble the man I had idolized, followed for my entire life so far.  He was desperate, unhinged.  He…in his terror, he was hurting himself.  He begged me to find a suitable wife, to save the family.  He fell to his knees and sobbed, pleading at the feet of my robes for me to restore his dignity.”
“Send him in.”
As his worry for Cass grew, he conjured his Patronus, which had changed to a fox after Cass had been born.  “Go check on her,” he told it, and it twitched its nose and disappeared through the wall.  It reappeared a few minutes later, looking wretched.  Cass had clearly blocked its entry to her room.  “It’s okay,” Harry reassured it, and it seemed to consider curling up at his feet, but instead, paled and faded out.
“Dreadful girl, keep meaning to fire her,” he replies, his proud smile completely contradicting his words.
“Harry,” Draco said, and it sounded broken.  He wanted desperately to explain, to make this pain go away.
Then, the day before he was scheduled to go see his Healer, Draco had gone with his Mother to visit Lucius in Azkaban.  Harry had kissed Draco soundly, and set about making his favourite dinner for when he returned.  Strangely, though, Draco hadn’t returned that night.  Instead, an owl had arrived at dinnertime, with a note from Draco saying that he wasn’t feeling well, and he’d stay at the Manor.  Harry had sent the owl back with a container of chicken soup, and spent the night with a rumbling in his belly that suggested he was coming down with whatever Draco had.
Hermione is leaning on her wrists on the ledge, staring down at the traffic, and the people who bustle past.  It’s a strangely beautiful day, Harry notices.  The sun is surprisingly warm for October, and the sky is heartbreakingly blue, with puffy clouds that drift along without any urgency.  The air smells like fall, but early fall, where Harry thinks of fresh parchment, and possibilities, and apples warmed by the afternoon sun, not decomposing leaves and impending slumber.  Harry stands next to her for a long time, quiet, waiting.  Hermione’s tension builds and roils around them, until finally, Harry says, “Mi?”, and that’s all she needs, and her fury unleashes in a desperate cry.
“How hard can it be?” Draco scoffed, not letting any of his utter terror at the situation to show on his face.
“I don’t know about that.  It’s not even really about Pansy, I don’t even remember her.  I’m just pissed at the idea that I died for a society who can’t stop letting their prejudices get in the way of sense.”
“I’m mad at you.”
was the one who tried to smash my lab to bits.  Like usual, I’m going to get blamed for something that
Treatment centre?  “What am I being treated for?”
“Hello darling,” Astoria said.  “You good?”
“Miss Cici?  Can I go play with Dean?”
It was 9:30.  Since he hadn’t told Harry what time to arrive, Draco figured he might as well go start his training, and the elves would get Harry to him if he did show up.  The room that Draco had commandeered as his dryland training room had been a conservatory, in earlier days.  There were wide windows throughout, and many of the plants that Narcissa had lovingly tended still lived, if feebly.  Draco had shoved them all into a corner, and transfigured a pile of old orchid pots into his equipment.  The treadmill had been more difficult to conjure, and so Draco had ordered it online using his phone, and cast a handy spell to ensure it ran without electricity.  He knew that, within weeks, the magic contained in the wards would interfere with the device’s inner workings and it would be useless, but, if his Mother still needed him, he could always buy another.  Money, he thought, was one of the few things that didn’t trouble him, now that he was the de facto head of household.  In fact, if he wished, he had no need to return to Canada and scrimp to live as a poorly paid hockey instructor.  Putting that thought aside for the moment, he started on the treadmill and began to run.  Fifteen minutes later, he considered himself sufficiently warmed up, and he began a series of deadlifts.  The familiar exercises were soothing, and Draco soon lost himself in the mindless repetition.  Lift, hold, release, repeat.
“You don’t want her to meet Draco?”
“I should go.  Nobody knows I’m gone.”  Draco stands, casts a glamour on his face to hide the ravages of his tears.
“Min,” he said, his voice fragile and shocked, and so, so lonely.  She was at his side in an instant, and he allowed her to gather him into her arms.
It had been ten years ago, when Draco’s Mother had begun seeking a match for Draco, and Astoria’s parents had been seeking out a wealthy suitor for their daughter, that he’d first really gotten to know Astoria.  She’d been two years behind he and her sister Daphne at school, and had been so quiet and shy then, he’d barely noticed her.  Since her graduation, she had come into her own.  She wanted no part of marriage.  She wanted to be a lawyer, not a trophy wife who hosted dinners and served on charity boards.  But, since the Greengrasses were quite poor, a law degree was unattainable.  As they endured the ceremony of a ritual courtship, Draco had been nothing but honest with her.
Ron blushed.  “I shouldn’t say anything, Draco, but Harry doesn’t hate you, yeah?”
“Harry, you’re right on time.”  Narcissa greeted him from her armchair.
So that’s what they did.  Ollivander had some interesting theories on the Elder wand, and Harry’s affinity with Malfoy’s wand.  By the time that Harry checked his watch, several hours had gone by.
“Why not?”
“It doesn’t matter.  I’ll do it.” Draco casts a desperate look at me and then at Hermione.  “It’s my
As the calendar flips over to the next year, and people drift in and out of their haphazardly assembled group of refugees to this new world, Hermione and Ron get married.  The wedding is beautiful.  Hermione, in her white gown, with seed pearls sewn to the bodice, her hair pinned up and convinced to behave with copious amounts of Sleekeasy, is so radiant that Harry’s breath catches.  She’s regarding him through the mirror as Pansy touches up her lipstick, and she raises an eyebrow at him.  “You’re lovely,” he says simply, and her eyes moisten a little before Pansy screeches at him to stop ruining her work.
Harry was suddenly filled with cold, icy rage.  Normally, he and Hermione bantered away in good humour, but he had always been sensitive about the incident with Malfoy in sixth year, and how it had been a long-running joke between Ron and Hermione that Harry was obsessed with Malfoy.  She’d dismissed his suspicions then, and she was implying now that he’d be unable to perform his duties.  “That’s out of line, and a low blow, besides,” he said coldly.
