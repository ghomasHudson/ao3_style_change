"I said we should probably get to Charms," She smiled at her not paying attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What does that mean?" Harriet had forgotten her book and was more interesting in learning more in-depth about the pureblood culture, whenever she read it on her own, she was always confused.
"What school?" Merry asked curiously as she hanged her arms off the back of the couch.
~Can I eat one?~ Beetlejuice hissed who was poking his head out of her blouse.
"Why?" Draco demanded the answer with his chest puffed out.
"Are you excited for this school year?" The middle guy asked Harry only.
"Yes I do, every morning," She was about to get up but Riley just smiled and held up his hand.
"Do what?" McGonagall asked with an eyebrow raised as she walked closer to the two.
"Alright, I will see you at Christmas mom," Merry hugged her mother.
"His name is Fawkes," Harriet squeaked at the sudden voice but Flint just stared at the new voice's owner.
"Violence is not the answer, it's best to ignore him for now but when it gets worse, tell a professor," Cedric advice.
"Yep," Harry smirked.
"Morning Slick," Harry said in a Scottish accent because Slick has a very heavy one.
"That explains it!" Tracey covered her mouth that was open in surprise.
"I'm fine with skipping," Pansy smirked and grabbed the mixed fruit bowl for Harriet. Merry plated a bunch of desserts for Harriet and Draco grabbed some pumpkin juice for her. They slipped out of the Great Hall and ran to the Slytherin Common Room with their food.
"You what!?" He shouted back while motioning her out of the floo. He made her tell him everything. After she finished, he just sighed and shook his head.
"Right after he told us that we are forbidden to go out after 9," Harry nodded.
"And also Neville, but he isn't here," Harriet chuckled.
"Now you Harriet will be harder to find a wand I know that," Harry stepped for eager to get her wand. After an hour of searching, Harry still didn't have her wand. All three of them were getting frustrated.
"I can show you where to go," He grumbled which made her chuckle.
"I still wanna be with you, you are nice to me," She nudged her nose into his neck as he calmed her.
"Did it turn out alright?" She looked up underneath her long eyelashes.

Harry frowned at this, she never knew her parents. Her Aunt said they died in a car accident because they were drunk and high. Her dad was a raging alcoholic who was addicted to drugs while her mom was a prostitute who slept with every man she saw. But Harry knew what really happened that night, Voldemort killed her parents and tried to kill her. The reason why it didn't work was because she is magic itself. It has been written since the beginning of time, she is the creator and destroyer of magic. The reason she knew it was of Mr. Feose. Mr. Feose works by her house as a potion maker. They met when she was 4, he was quite scared when an unsupervised toddler walked into his shop with almost no clothes on. He fed her, gave her clothes, and read her stories. Over the years, he let her work for him and she made a few galleons each week. She is so advanced at potions, he fears that the professors at Hogwarts will be scared of an 11 year old having the knowledge of a 40 year old. He was the one who told her about the wizarding world, her parents, and the prophecy. Harry was very thankful for him teaching her and being like a father to her.
"Not really, but you guys can go," She smiled timidly.
"We just have to be by our parents for a bit then all the kids come up after," Draco promised. Harriet nodded and they said bye quickly before leaving her alone. She waited around 20 minutes, just eating pretzels and some chocolates from Draco. She really enjoyed the chocolate he bought her, it was super sweet and creamy. She soon became super restless so she opened up Draco's door and looked down the hallway. No one was near. She bit her lip, wondering if she should leave or not.  So she stepped out of his room and started to walk down the hallway, she followed the loud noises and laughing coming from a large room. Her heart rate quickened at remembering Merry's warning but the curiosity was killing her. She found a darkened open doorway and stuck her head in nervously. She gasped when she saw everyone in the ballroom, everyone was either in fancy robes or expensive dresses.
"Bimbo?" Blaise laughed.
"Is he yours?" She asked while petting his cat gently, she liked the feeling of the fur.
"My name is Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," The blond boy to her left said. He offered his hand to shake so she put her fork down and wiped her face with her napkin.
"What are you two talking about? About how Finnigan is an utter imbecile?" He sneered.
"I thought we weren't going to kill it!" Merry yelled.
"No, I was wondering if I could get one here?" Harry questioned curiously while eating her cookies and cream ice cream.
"What happened?" He shouted with fire in his eyes.
"Halloween, October 31st," Blaise frowned in confusion of why the date could be a factor.
"Really?" Harry was surprised at the random kindness of her housemates. They already knew where their classes were but the others couldn't find out.
"Neither was I," Harry chuckled. "If that was just the dungeons just imagine what the rest of the castle will be like." Merry let out a breath.
"You might belong in Hufflepuff,
"Yes, thank you," Harry stammered out while blushing. He had two older male friends behind him.
"Next time, don't be selfish." With that, her Aunt slammed the door in her face and locked the door. Harriet cried softly in the hallway, too scared to go back to her little room. It was quite lonely in there, there was only a small bed with a few torn and thin blankets. Harriet curled up into a ball, hiding her face in her knees sobbing. She couldn't get the lady's red hair and the loud noise out of her mind. She soon fell asleep with a thought of hoping that the lady was alright. The next morning she woke up to her Aunt screaming.
"Draco?" Merry sighed, Draco mentally prepared the list in his head.
"Are you sure?"
"Right," She smiled and started to eat some fruit. After they watching a few minutes of the movie, Merry asked a question.
"You know Potter," Harriet whipped her head towards Malfoy who also jumped at her sudden movement, "It's bad to show you others that you were fake crying. It would have been better to have them underestimate you and think that you are weak."
"Professor may I have Flint for a moment?" There was a noise meaning that someone was getting up. The older, way taller, student stepped out and looked at her with a blank expression.
"Good," He blushed, "How about you?"
"Thanks," She smiled at Merry. "I probably will shower tomorrow morning," Harry told her while putting away the soap in her trunk at the end of her bed. Some girls were talking about some love show and others were talking about classes. Harry took out a baggy t-shirt and some shorts to sleep in. She also grabbed her toothbrush and some night moisturizer. She went across the hall and changed out of her Slytherin robes. She changed and brushed her teeth. Someone knocked on the door when she was putting on moisturizer. Merry walked in with a bunch of hair product.
"I'm alright, I slept quite well. Thank you again for letting me stay here." Narcissa smiled again at Harriet's soft voice and quiet demeanor.
"What?" Harry frowned but gasped also when she saw the sight in front of her. The sky was darkened and filled with stars. The sunset was still slightly visible with a giant castle ahead of them. The castle was amazing, it stood out like white on black. Harry accidentally let her hand that was still gliding in the water get the edges of her robes wet but she didn't care. She couldn't believe that this place was going to be her home for 7 years. She eyes started to water a little for the cold air or her emotions, she couldn't tell which. When they got up to shore, Harry was the last to get out of the boats because, to be honest, she wanted to stare a little longer. The group walked up to the castle doors. Every kid was whispering excitedly and looking around. The large man knocked loudly on the wooden door which Harry thought he was going to break down the door. A strict looking woman opened the doors.
"Why won't you even just let me sleep?" She flipped over to face Merry.
Curses: -
Harriet gripped her broom tighter and bit her lip nervously, "Yeah you are right, but I'm still really nervous."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Did you hear that?" Cedric asked after a huge crash came from the girls' bathroom.
"Shall we go visit the others?" Riley smiled at the small group, Draco led the group with Merry and Harriet right behind him. Once they entered the adults all said their hellos and got their hugs from each other. Lucius clapped Severus on the back while Riley hugged Narcissa and Cara gently. Riley and Severus both sat on the couch across from Narcissa and Lucius. Riley gave Draco a few presents to pass around which were from both Riley and Severus. The adults talked about... something but Harriet couldn't really pay attention since she had several well-wrapped presents in front of her, they were for her and only her. She smiled to herself as she held a small present in her cold hands. She heard a click and she looked up to see Narcissa taking a photo of Draco opening his first present which was a warm turtleneck, still a bit too big for him. He smiled at the camera and held up his dark green sweater proudly. Harriet got really excited to open up her first present, well her second since Cara got her that fluffy blanket which she cuddled with last night. But it would be her first present on Christmas, her heart beat faster as her and Merry opened up their first presents together. Harriet tore the wrapping nicely while Merry just ripped into it. She heard another click from the camera and looked over to see that Merry got a necklace which she put on immediately and thanked the Malfoy's. Harriet delicately opened up the box to see a makeup thing, she took it out and Merry helped show it to the camera and Harriet smiled on instinct. The camera clicked again to show it was no longer going so Harriet looked at the makeup thing more closely.
The man laughed which sounded like... well Harry didn't know how to explain his laugh. His laugh was beautiful like the rest of him.
"We forgot to look for the other common rooms," Harry gasped.
"You should really be into politics when you are older," Flint said flabbergasted.
"This way!" Shouted Gemma which led them going downwards on a moving staircase, while it was moving! All of the students gasped and looked around excitedly. The staircase shifted into place which made the kids scream a little at the sudden movement. They walked down the stairs and walked all of the way to the dungeons. It was very dark and cold down here. Harry was used to the cold and dark in her cupboard so she was going to be fine. Beetlejuice poked his head out of her collar.
"Come in!" Professor Flitwick shouted through the door. Riley opened the door and stuck his head in while Harriet stood confused.
"Thank you," She bashfully smiled back.
"So what class do we have first?" She huffed.
"It really was," Harriet agreed. She packed a few muffins wrapped in a few napkins and also grabbed some fruit.
"Alright, we can go," Harriet got up, not looking at Merry. Betray stung throughout her body, her temples were pounding. 'Calm down, calm down, calm down, you are probably just over thinking like usual.' She told herself. They walked down to the Great Hall for breakfast, the walk was quiet even though Merry tried to make small talk but failed due to Harriet's mind still on the thought of betrayed. They sat down by their other friends, Harriet seemed very distant at breakfast, everyone tried to pull her into a conversation but failed. Harriet played with her food, not really feeling like talking anymore.
"I'm not mad, don't worry. I heard that you are really good, you will be amazing," He smiled at her.
"Where else do we have to go?" Merry asked while twirling her hair.
"I will miss you too but I will always be at my shop for you to come and see. I will always be here for you," He kissed her forehead. Harry just hugged him tighter.
"I don't want you to waste time."
She wasn't sleeping that well though because of her and Merry's midnight adventures, they found all of the common rooms and are still trying to figure out the passwords. They haven't gone on the third floor yet because Merry admitted that she was a bit scared and Harriet didn't want to force her. She also was having nightmares and visions about the girls' bathroom which she really didn't understand. But overall she was really starting to like her Hogwarts' experience. She also was making quick friends with people in the other houses and her year. She absolutely loved Neville though, he is just so nice and quiet. She loves seeing him in Herbology when he doesn't seem scared or nervous. Her and Flint were still having their 'Staring contests' without actually saying anything to each other. Maybe in the future, they will finally get to talk.
"I'm Merry Baxter," Merry giggled and hit Liam's arm softly as he bit in her direction.
"Hi Riley," She nodded at him shyly. Merry went to hug Severus while Draco hugged Riley, Riley seemed to give longer hugs while Severus gave tighter ones. After Merry hugged Riley, Severus and Harriet made eye contact. She nodded at him which made him raise an eyebrow again and nod back in acknowledgment. Riley patted Harriet's shoulder and squeezed it lightly.
"Oh! Then continue, continue!" Harriet jumped up and down, she wants to bond. The girls all giggled at her excitement.
"No," She mumbled. She ran into the room to avoid them but Dudley grabbed her by the hair. She yelped in pain and stumbled back with Dudley's hand still in her long hair. Piers groped her flat chest and snorted when he couldn't grab anything. She whimpered when he dug his nails into her chest.
"I really don't understand him," Gemma sighed and rubbed her temples.
"I was scared," Harriet sniffled, she was quite cold since she slept on the floor the whole night. But she can curl up in her bed tomorrow in her own room, right?
"Why did the Ministry take the lights side?" Harry asked.
"Let me guess," Tracey laughed, "Beetlejuice."
"They were very interesting. Thank you so much!" Harry said while bouncing on the balls of her feet. Ms. Haack chuckled as she checked in the books. Ms. Haack always had a soft spot for Harry. She knew Harry lived in a bad home and it made her heart ache to see Harry be so grateful over the littlest things.
"When the teachers hand it off to the troll experts, they will kill it and sell its organs for an expensive price!" She should know, Mr. Feose told her how expensive they are and how they kill the ones who are lost and can cause destruction.
"Mr. Feose," She said carefully not knowing the reaction they might have.
"Oh yes, thank you so much," She giggled and followed him out of the Great Hall after waving goodbye to her friends. They talked about quidditch and Christmas plans on the way there.
"Why are most of this crossed out?" Harry asked while frowning.
-----------------------------------------------
"Thanks Harriet," Neville interrupted, "You really didn't have to but thank you for doing that," He blushed and looked down shyly.
"Don't think of it," Merry warned.
"So see any cute boys lately?" Merry asked everyone.
"Riley?" Harriet frowned, what was he going to do?
"Did what?" Pucey wiped his forehead.
"Morning Potter," He stumbled out.
"She has asked that 20 times since we got here," She told Harry.
"Yes, we."
"Maybe I will," Harriet smiled, she really liked flying and if joining the Quidditch team meant more flying, she was in.
"Politics don't really interest me," She shrugged, "I just like helping others."
"Harriet time to get up," Merry sang outside of her curtains on her bed. After she didn't respond, Merry said her name again and peeked through the curtains. Harriet groaned loudly and shoved her face into the pillow. "Are you alright?"
"Can you stir it?" Harriet asked, she wanted Merry to get a good grade on this.
"He will definitely get the position, he is an amazing Quidditch player and spectacular at his studies," Harriet said confidently. Draco blushed deeply at Harriet's confidence in his abilities.
"Good," Pansy nodded, "Are you feeling better?" She asked between Tracy and Daphne.
"They are with us," Harriet showed them all of the blankets and first-year students, "Sorry we were watching movies, they were trying to cheer me up with me being sick and all," She pouted in shame. The girls instantly melted and cooed to calm her.
"They decide what is best for you." Harriet snorted at that.
"May I see it? I can grab it, you just need to rest."
"Has Harriet texted you yet?" Theodore asked which gained everyone attention and all looked at Merry impatiently for the answer.
"Come on Harriet!" Merry shouted. Harriet got up to where she was and suddenly Merry took off. Harriet followed and somehow ended up in front of her.
"Good Morning Ackerson, Jennings, Bloom," Riley smiled to them while Snape sneered at them silently.
"Welcome to Hogwarts, I except your journey here was good," She had a very crisp voice. "I am Professor McGonagall, Head of Gryffindor and you are about to enter Hogwarts. The four houses are Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, and Slytherin. I expect you to behave and study hard throughout your 7 years here" It was obvious she didn't like Slytherin and loved her own house. Otherwise, she seemed perfectly fine, just on the strict side. "I hope you get into the house you want." She went to close the door again but she finished with, "I think it is best to straighten yourselves out while I am away," while staring at a redhead's dirty nose and some others messy robes. She left which made many students sigh in relief. Students straightened their hair and robes nervously. Harry just stared at the door emotionless. She really didn't know what to feel, happy, scared, nervous. She was feeling so many emotions in her life it made her chest hurt. Merry was playing with her skirt and Millicent was tugging at her hair. The door opened again and she motioned them to follow her. The large man walked aside McGonagall. Harry looked at the roof which was filled with stars and candles. Page 184 paragraph 3 explains the ceiling in Hogwarts: A History Harry remembered. The bushy haired girl from before was saying the same thing out loud which earned her a few glares from the other students. But she didn't say the page or paragraph which made Harry puff out her chest proudly. The other older students didn't seem to care about the first years at the front of the hall. A hat that seemed to be made out of rags was on a stool. The sorting hat, Harry smirked, she already knew how they were going to be sorted unlike all of the other students. The redhead with dirt still on his nose was grumbling something about twins and a troll. The hat sang out,
"F-f-fine."
"It's so odd to be scared of a name," She chuckled bitterly.
"Harriet Potter but everyone calls me Harry."
"Oh my god, that was so long," Merry yawned.
(also I changed Harriet back to having green eyes, glasses and unruly hair because I felt like I was stripping her from truly being 'Harriet Potter' like I have a hard time imagining even Harry Potter differently because his green eyes, glasses, and unruly hair give so much to his character and I felt wrong for changing that in the first place)
"Movies, munchies, and mischief," Harriet chuckled.
"A spell so boys can walk up the stairs," Pansy smirked.
"It makes your lips look even plumper," Merry explained while she put blue eyeshadow on Harry. She put darker blue in the crease and more of a silvery color in the middle.
"I heard  you may be spending the holidays with the Malfoys?" He asked slowly.
"Oliver Woods," Daphne giggled.
She burst through the door and walked up to her Aunt who was cleaning dishes, "Auntie! I drew a picture!" Her Aunt looked at her blankly and when she saw the picture of a small brunette with three other people. Each being labeled by their nicknames. Petunia said nothing but took the picture. Harriet's heart was going at a fast rate, she hoped she liked it. Petunia walked carefully over to the trash can and tore up the picture with no words, Harriet gasped and held back tears. She hated her picture, she promised herself that she would do better next time to make her Aunt happy.
"Open up!" A girl's voice shouted urgently and she pounded on the door. Harriet was the first to jump up and answer the pounding. She used her magic to light all of the candles and shut off the television. The first years groaned in confusion as they awoke suddenly.
"Here let Dobby get your blanket," Draco puffed out his chest, he seemed to like informing out orders. "Dobby!" A small creature came running out of almost nowhere, he was dressed in what looked like a dirty, used cloth. When he ran, his large ears flopped around.
"Now to your parents will."
"Now get on but don't take off, that is for a different date," She explained which made students moan, they wanted to fly properly.
"More importantly why are you here?" Merry puffed out her chest and glared at the Hufflepuff.
"Lady Merry of the Baxter Household, it is nice to meet you," Harry bowed her head in respect. Some purebloods can be very offended if you don't address them right. Merry just waved her hand.
"Look, if you don't feel ready, we don't have to go. Your mental health means more than going to class," Merry looked her directly in the eyes. Harriets eyes started to water, she actually cared about her and how she felt. No one ever had seen her almost have a panic attack and yet she was so comforting and caring.
Flint laughed loudly, "Don't worry I can take it." He ruffled her hair gently while Derek tried not to laugh at the sight.
"So it's mostly families from the Sacred 28, you know what that is right?" Harriet hesitated, "So it's basically all the families who are truly pureblood, but knowing that a family is truly pureblood can be quite confusing because people can have affairs and divorces, marrying cousins, it's all very complicated. But the Sacred 28 are 28 wizarding families who are branded truly pureblood. So there are the ones you know Malfoys, obviously, Nott, Parkinson, Flint, Greengrass, and Bulstrode. Longbottom and Weasley are also purebloods and in the Sacred 28 but won't coming because they have other plans and don't get involved with dark wizards. Macmillan, Abbott, and Fawley are mostly a Hufflepuff family but they come to all pureblood events for political power. All the rest are mostly Slytherins-"
"Thanks, I was a bit scared I was going to set the desk on fire," Harriet joked.
Harry laughed, "Yeah basically." The two of them walked around the dungeons, looking at every single corridor and painting. They both talked to everyone, most had never even talked to humans in years.
"What am I going to do with you?" He laughed.
"Yes, please," He flicked his hand a few times and a key appeared in front of them.
"I'm a head boy, I'm supposed to report any students out of bed, immediately," He stressed immediately.
"Of course, I will take extra, extra, extra care of her," Ms. Figgs promised. Harriet handed over Minerva to Ms. Figgs.
Riley looked at them in thought, "It is quite gruesome, you two are pardoned."
"Are you okay Harry?" He hissed and licked her fingers.
"Should we eat again? I'm hungry," Cara said. They ate at a diner which Cara had a salad, Merry had some pancakes, and Harry had a cheese burger and some fries. Harry and Merry giggled watching Merry's kitten named Willow as she gnawed on some fries. They talked about dragons riders.
"Get cleaned up while I," He sighed heavily, "Clean the storage," He grumbled and turned dramatically. When the storage door shut, Harriet turned to Longbottom and stopped crying. He jumped at her sudden movement and his eyes were filled with worry.
-----------------------------
"I can like feel the pressure and pain build up as the class goes on and then as I leave the pressure and pain just turns into a migraine," Harriet tried to explain. Riley nodded his head in thought. "Does that help? Sorry, I'm arse at explaining things."
"There still are more," Draco cleared his throat, he twitched at the interbreeding part, "Ollivander-"
"I believe so, I have a lot of books. Didn't help we completely trashed your room basically as soon as we got here," Harriet giggled mischievously.
Her teachers never said anything, they always were curious when they saw new bruises every day. They wanted to say something. They really did. But in the small town of Little Whinging, everything must be perfect from the people to lawns to the school system. Having an abuse case in their small town will ruin their reputation completely, so they have to keep their mouths shut even if a few kids suffer greatly.
Or young with scabby knees,
"I copied it off when I was in the Ministry, this is the prophecy. This is your destiny and future. This is you." Harry began to read.
"Are you going to Hogwarts too?" She asked while twirling a little in place. The girl had an amber, messy look to her hair and purple eyes. She had a really nice smile and perfectly straight teeth. The girl was more... developed than Harry which caused Harry to blush from even looking. She was wearing a really pretty, short purple dress that matched her eyes really nicely. She also was wearing quite a bit of makeup.
"What the hell is this?" She whispered loudly.
Throughout the day, multiple people wished to Merry for Harriet to get better. Even people neither of them have even met came up to Merry. It was very odd to her, they had no reason to come up to her. Merry just guessed Harriet had that effect on people, they just had to trust her and feel a sense of protection when near her like they needed to protect her. Merry knew Harriet wasn't using this to her advantage, she is simply being herself. She didn't really seem like a Slytherin to Merry, she seemed more like a Hufflepuff with extreme knowledge. For heaven sakes, she once brought cupcakes that she made to the Gryffindors after their lost to Ravenclaws and she stayed for the whole party. She was at the rival house! Maybe in the future, she will show more of her Slytherin side.
Today was almost 11 years after her parents died, October 31st. She was only 5 months old when they died. She remembers the event like it happened 10 minutes ago. She remembers her parents' last words and their screams. She remembers his face and his words to her before he cast the killing spell on her. Harriet kissed Beetlejuice on the head and let him wrap around her arm. She threw the covers off of her and went to the bathroom. She threw off her wet shirt and underwear and hopped into a cold shower. Beetlejuice slithered on the wet floor excitedly, he loved shallow water. The cold shower washed away her sweat and woke her up, made her feel like she could start new again. She spent a long time in the shower before she got out and contemplated going to classes. She whispered a spell so the time would appear, 6:32 am. Breakfast opens at 7 am on weekdays even though classes didn't start till 9 am and 7:30 am on weekends. She really didn't feel like going. She sighed heavily and looked at herself in the mirror. She looked terrible, bags under her eyes with red eyes. She sniffed and rubbed her nose, she didn't even know how to explain how she was feeling, she felt like nothing. Harriet sighed and let Beetlejuice curl around her arm and lick her face. Harriet sighed again for what seemed to be the 10th time, she laid back in bed and closed her eyes which were burning with tiredness. She dozed off and on curled up into a ball with Beetlejuice curled around her arm still.
"5 minutes to board!" Screamed what seemed to be the train itself.
"I would have loved to see the look on his face," She giggled. Just then Draco stomped up to them.
"Defense Against Dark Arts mostly," Harriet nodded in memory.
"Never thought that Potter: The Girl Who Lived, would ever be in Slytherin. Never thought you would also stand up to Snape on your first night," The first one who talked smirked.
She nodded, "It is a very interesting study." Neville nodded as to agree to her statement. The three of them got into a conversation about some plants while the rest of the Gryffindors piled in. They all gave her weird looks but said nothing. A Gryffindor boy sat down next to her, one of the ones who was last to transfiguration. Seamus Finnigan.
"What?!" Merry shouted back.
Merry chuckled, "He won't object to that." Draco punched her in the arm lightly which made the three of them laugh. Harriet skips closer to him and grabbed his arm to hold hands. He opened his door lightly, leading the girls into his room. His room looks even larger as their whole common room, maybe even bigger! There were light gray walls with a roaring fireplace, a gray couch, and a few matching armchairs. There was a huge bed with silky white curtains over it, sun shown through his curtains so the room looked golden and alive. There also was a desk with potions and huge bookshelves that cover almost an entire wall which really interests Harriet. There also was a large Slytherin banner, a huge closet of designer wardrobe. Harriet felt calm from the scent of the room, it smelled like his cologne and old books with broom wax.
"Do you get them often?"
"Feel like I do," He rested his chin in his free hand that was not drumming.
"Hello dear, are you here for your school supplies?" An older woman with round glasses asked. She flooed to Flourish and Blotts.
"Well I want to bond but I really haven't seen any cute boys," She frowned and pulled her knees to her chest.
"Come on, maybe it moved," They quickly searched some of the corridors before running into someone.
"Don't make me throw some at you too," She threatened jokingly while holding up a spoonful of potatoes. Harry held up her hands surrendering. "Good girl," She smirked.
~Tis was a dream, nothing more. Don't worry young one~ He hissed and nudged her cheek. She wept into her pillow and also dug her nails into the pillow. Beetlejuice hissed calming words to her as she tried to calm herself down. When she had her breathing under control, she wiped off her face.
Harriet thought for a moment then nodded, "I am better now."
"Are you excited?" Merry asked while packing up her trunk.
"Okay, okay, so who has seen Terry Boot?"
"Theodore Nott, nice to meet you," He said shyly. Harry could tell that he did not like to talk.
I feel like I have to explain this chapter a bit, I always have wondered how Muggle-borns (or in Harry's case half-blood) handle being in the muggle world which portrays witches as evil. So the Muggle-borns or Harry grow up thinking witches and wizards are bad but then they find out that they are one so what do they do? They have to be afraid of themselves and have the thought that they are evil themselves. I tried to have Harriet feel this and also have the abuse from Dudley and his gang be included to really show how Harriet felt as a kid with magic. Plus the reason why Piers harms her is not just because he is a kid and rude but because he is also taught magic is evil so Harriet is evil also. Hope this cleared things up a bit
"And why not?"
"And you are planning on doing what?" He seemed a bit scared for the answer.
"Right after Dumbledore said we would meet out death if we go onto certain floor, the 3rd. Which I assume you want to go on," Merry eyes were almost popping out of her head. Harry's smirk just widened. There was a moment of silence between them.
"Would you like us to show you guys where your classes will be?" The first girl asked politely.
"Hogwarts does have an impressive library, no one has ever read all of the books in the 7 years they were here. As for the Quidditch players," He laughed. Harriet and Merry laughed back. She liked this professor, he is nice and funny. He also is very easy to talk to.
"Harriet, what do you seem to have here?" Her voice shook with laughter seeing Minerva in this position.
Harriet Lillian Potter
"Hi Neville," She smiled.
"Yeah, I guess," She murmured and curled back into a ball and sighed heavily. The girls all shared a weird look, wondering why she was acting so weird.
"If I can't reply in the muggle world, I guess I have to reply in the Wizarding World," She giggled quietly and made her way downstairs.
"Sure if that won't be any trouble," Harry said.
"It is just a toad eye," She laughed and plopped it into the brewing cauldron.
"So sod off, just because your father taught you to do something a certain way doesn't mean every other Slytherin has to do it that way," Merry glared at him.
"NO!" Screamed the bushy haired girl. The toad flew over Neville and the girls' heads and into Harry's open hand.
"Yeah," She smiled.
"Do you have their schedules ready now?" The third more silent and scary girl asked blankly to Snape. He scowled at Harry even though she did absolutely nothing. He went back into the door and quickly grabbed their two schedules. He shoved the parchment papers towards them and turned to leave with Riley following.
"But I don't want him to be blamed for my mistake," Harriet pouted fearfully.
"Felix?" He growled out, the man didn't even flinch at Marcus's harsh expression but Harriet did flinch which made Marcus swear to himself under his breath. The room seemed to quiet down quite a bit, everyone turned to him. The older ones seemed to keep quiet but look at the man judging him, the younger ones were whispering to themselves confused. Marcus and his friends seemed very pissed off at the man who hasn't moved at all.
"I always need to be by you then," She giggled. Draco blushed brightly which made his ears turn pink.
"A nimbus 2000!" Both of them silently shouted.
"Woah, are you okay?" A deep voice chuckled. Harry looked up to see a handsome, tall male student. He had a chiseled face and sparkling gray eyes with perfect white teeth.
"They are planning on killing the troll!" Harriet cried.
"Have a nice Holidays Professor," She smiled fakely, just like him. As she walked out of the room, the exciting little toys seemed to lose their excitement and appeal. The lemon drop in her mouth became sour. Her eyes became warm and itchy as she ran back to the common room. It was still early so no one was out, it was the last day before break so no classes and everyone wanted to sleep in. She sat down on the couch in the middle of the common room and wiped her eyes. This was going to be her first holidays, her first holidays ever really, with people who actually care about her and she doesn't even get to have it.
Our heads could do with filling
"I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even put a stopper in death," He drawled on in a monotone voice. Harriet shivered at his speech, she was very ambitious to learn how to do everything he just said. He walked in front of her and Merry's table and dramatically stopped.
"Let's start the movie!" Millicent clapped her hands. They set up a flat screen above the first place so they could play Just Dance and movies when they wanted. Harriet never played because she can't dance at all but she loved seeing how competitive Merry gets.
Harriet blushed lightly at her words, "Why?"
"No Baxter was hot, Potter was just down right gorgeous!" Liam argued. Cedric hit both of them teasingly upside their heads.
"Oh definitely, you have to," Merry nodded.
"It's wonderful to meet you Harry," The man smiled which made Harry blush.
"Oh, Millicent, there you are," Merry said surprised. A young girl around their age was reading a leather covered book. She was a little overweight but she was still pretty. She had dark brown long hair while hazel eyes and a round face.
"Coming!" She yelled through the door. She opened the door to see Harriet, who she absolutely loved, held what seemed to see Professor McGonagall in cat form with a slightly amused look and seemed to be in trouble. She stared at the Profesor with a blank look on her face.
----------------------------
"What happened?" Cedric rubbed Hermione's back.
"Ah you'll do fine and if you ever need help just get my attention," She smiled.
Draco puffed up his chest in disagreement, "No it will not!"
"That's not true, you have us," Draco said. Harriet nodded, more in defeat. She still found it a bit silly to be afraid of a name, but she completely understood why they were afraid.
"Didn't Mr. Feose tell you anything?" Merry asked.
"Only 10 minutes to be honest," Harry stared at her blankly waiting for her to respond.
"Eek!" She squeaked and jumped in her chair at the loud noise. After the smoke cleared, Seamus's face was covered in ashes and his feather was also ashes.
"GET UP FREAK!" Her Aunt shrieked. Aunt Petunia has been cooking now because she has been locking Harry in her cupboard almost 24/7. Harry could only get out of her cupboard to go to the bathroom or clean. She rubbed her eyes and pushed open her door. Just as she was about to step out of her cupboard, Dudley walked by and slammed it closed. Harry flew back and hit her head on the wall as Dudley cackled. A black object slithered out from underneath her thin blanket. It was her snake Beetlejuice that she got from Mr. Feose. She named him after her and Mr. Feose's favorite movie. They would cuddle up and laugh non-stop throughout the whole movie. These were her favorite moments because it made her feel like she had a real family.
"Basically everything," Harriet giggled while still rubbing her eyes.
"Can we put a bow on her?" Harry asked as the woman was shrinking down everything for the girls.
Riley chuckled and ruffled his hair, "No need for that, just call me Riley."
Parents: Lily Evans and James Potter
"Yes mom!" Merry shouted back while rolling her eyes.
"It was very nice to meet you," Cedric smiled at Harry.
"Are you excited to go to Hogwarts?" He asked and handed Mr. Feose the food.
Harriet giggled which made Flint raise his eyebrow at her, "Girl things?"
"Wait- I can leave the Dursleys'!" She screamed which scared him.
"Scotland-y," Mr. Feose slapped his upside the head teasingly. After saying a few quick goodbyes, Slick went back into the fireplace to leave. Harry and Mr. Feose went to the living room in the back to eat. Harry ate her sweet and sour chicken and 2 egg rolls while Mr. Feose ate his pot stickers and fried rice. Mr. Feose talked about a wild story that involved the most poisonous snake known to the world, a toilet plunger, and a group of human eating chickens. Harry excused herself for a moment to grab the bag of ice he forgot on the counter. The rest of the day is filled with brewing potions and Mr. Feose telling the weirdest stories. They ate pizza for lunch and again before Harry had to leave at 4:30. She always had to be home before 5:00 or her Aunt will hit her till bones break. She quickly thanked Mr. Feose and ran home. She burst through the door and slammed it shut. Her magic sensed that no one was home so she threw her bag in her cupboard and started supper. She started to cook when her Aunt came home with some grocery bags. Her Aunt didn't even acknowledge her, she just set the bags down and went upstairs. Harry put all of the groceries away and continued cooking. Her uncle came home while she just finished cooking. She set the table while he turned on the T.V. Her Aunt came down as she served dinner for both of them because Dudley was staying at Piers.
"Yes I will see you later Ms. Potter, I hope you have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year," Some twinkle in his eyes was back but not fully.
"And the government doesn't do that?"
"You know what Merry, life happens in weird ways," Harriet tried to be serious but failed.
"Harriet stop!" Merry sat next to her and patted her hair. Harriet flinched at her hand coming near her but tilted her head so Merry could pet her. Merry doesn't know why Harriet flinches so much, she still gets a bit stiff when Merry hugs her. Merry never questions the topic of her home life, she fears the answer she may get. "They will love you, I promise! They aren't bad people, I know they are seen as bad because of their political power but they are nice people."
"Oh my god Merry," Harriet rolled her eyes and picked up an eyeball from the jar with her gloved hand. Merry gagged and covered her mouth.
"No, no, no that was wonderful, thank you," He smiled again at her. "Do you feel any other sick like symptoms? Cough? Sore throat? Runny nose?"
"Yes, I am. But I already have all of the books needed for my first year," Harry explained.
this took way longer to write, wayyyy longer but anyways there will probably be 3-4 more chapters to the first year which will be quite long and hefty <3 <3
"Do we have to?" Harriet moaned.
"Merry!" Harriet teased at her, "Why?"
"Hello sir, I'm Harriet Potter," She shyly offered her hand. He smiled kindly and shook her small hand.
Merry hummed, "How about we go explore the outside of Hogwarts before dinner then we can go to the library afterward? That way no one wonders why a group of first years are wandering around after dinner outside."
"Malfoy has a New Years Eve party and every pureblood family is invited."
"May I use the restroom?" Harry asked her Aunt. She just glared at her and nodded while trying to talk to her husband which was not working at all. Harry walked upstairs and went into the bathroom. She locked the door and quickly opened her letter.  She read it very quickly smiling very wide with tears in her eyes. She frowned at the recommended course books, she already has read them to the point where she could reread the books back and forth. She wondered how she was going to reply but a smirk slowly appeared on her face. Harry couldn't send the letter from Mr. Feose shop because she had a good guess that the letters were tracked to see where they came from. She and Mr. Feose would get into a lot of trouble with the Ministry because no one was supposed to tell her about her magic or anything until she got her letter. She shoved the letter back in her back pocket and walked out the bathroom still smirking.
And I can cap them all.
"I mean I have a sore throat and my eyes really hurt," That was more from her nightmares but she didn't want to say anything.
"That was fun!" Beetlejuice hissed which made Harry open her eyes. She gasped at the sight, people running around pushing carts filled with trunks and pets. Owls hooted and cat meowed and purred at their owners. Kids were hugging their parents' goodbye while the parents cried and kissed them. The train was what made Harry gasp so loudly, it was amazing. It was huge and bright with adventure and mystery surrounding it which excited Harry. Mr. Feose motioned them to step forward. People were rushing out of the dozen floos and the wall across from them. Harry looked around for Merry who said she was going to be by the 4th door to get on the train.
You're in safe hands (though I have none)
"Do you take any medicine regularly?" He looked around, searching for the medicine.
"Wake up, Freak!" Her Aunt shrieked. Harriet simply got up without complaining and went into the kitchen to start breakfast. Her scar has been bubbling with pain lately for some reason. Her scar is like multiple lighting bolts shooting down from the sky and they are pure silver. Harriet's Aunt always complains about how freakish her scar looks. So after a year of searching for makeup products to cover up her scar, they finally found the right product to cover it up. For some unknown reason, the makeup always would work everywhere but her scar. She shutters at the memory of what her Uncle did after she said it was like magic. But she knew she had magic, she knew. Weird things always happen around her like stuff setting on fire and blowing up. She was bleeding for weeks after the incident. Aunt Petunia was screaming about something in the background about uneven curtains which made Harriet's eyes roll. Her Aunt always liked things in perfect order, no matter what it was, it had to be perfect in every way. Harriet really never cared about things being neat like her Aunt because she never had things of her own to keep neat. Harriet was just about to finish breakfast when her Uncle came down, that fat cow. She rushed over to put food on his plate.
She is both sin and saint.
(See the end of the chapter for
Key Owners: Albus Dumbledore and Riley Woods
He let out a breath that sounded like a deep chuckle, "I don't know how else to describe it, they do each other's makeup and talk about boys."
"Thank you mother," His face growing red again. "Can we go eat now?" And that set out the rest of the day, they ate together as what seemed to be like a family. Lucius and Narcissa talked about some politics dealing with the Ministry while Draco and Merry argued about which Quidditch team was the best. Harriet focused more on the food and trying to get rid of the pressure behind her eyes, the food was amazing. She never got to eat any of the food that she cooked for the Dursleys on Christmas so it felt wonderful to finally be able to eat. Merry's mother came over after they finished eating with a few presents. Merry and Draco dragged her quickly to under the Christmas tree in the living room so they could open up presents quickly. The kids sat on the ground while the adults sat on the furniture. Narcissa joined her husband on the black love seat while Cara sat alone on a large seat by the fireplace.
'Oh yes," The old man's eyes sparkled, he had an overall youthful aura around him despite his age. He also seemed to like brightly colored robes, "I'm Professor Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts."
"Really?" He gasped with his eyes blown wide.
"Who is?"
"May I go outside for the day?" Harry said in her most innocent voice.
"Oh shit!" Harry shouted as soon as she put her shrunken truck in her pocket.
"I am your families banker, I make sure that everything is in the right order and nothing but," He explained while pulling out a blank piece of parchment. "I have to do a blood test to make sure that you are truly Harriet Potter," He pulled out a knife. After she gave him a weird look he asked her for her hand. She slowly put her hand in his smaller, grayer one. He put the tip of the knife to the tip of her finger and pushed until blood started to drip. He positioned her hand above the parchment to make the blood drip down onto the middle of the parchment. As soon as the blood hit the parchment, the parchment seemed to explode with black writing. Harry gasped and quickly pulled her hand back. The parchment read:
"Wait, but Merry is a pureblood? What about Vincent or Gregory, aren't they also purebloods? Or Blaise?" Harriet frowned, this was super confusing.
"Yes!" Harry screamed. She wanted to know the truth no matter how dark and twisted it was. Mr. Feose saw the determined look in her eyes and continued on.
"We are not taking it down! We are saving it from that!" Harriet yelled and hit Cedric's back.
"What do you want rat?!" She turned around and shouted at him.
"Merry just touch the toad!" Harriet sighed and put her hand on her hip.
"I- I had a nightmare," Harriet whimpered, why wasn't she running to hug her? Why wasn't she kissing her cheeks like Dudley's? Why wasn't her Uncle reading her a story to calm her down?
"Professor McGonagall," Riley opened the door to her classroom, "May I have Potter for a moment?"
(Edited: I forgot the song!)
"Where would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?"
"Nah, we can do it next year," Merry reassured her.
"Oh thank you," She said softly.
Just wrote a little chapter cause I have to study for 3 quizzes tomorrow even though it is 11pm now. Anyways hope ya enjoyed <3
"But I'm not scared of him, he took away everything from me, everything," Merry and Draco said nothing, "But that's why I'm not afraid, I have nothing."
"I just wanted to talk," She smiled which made him blush lightly, "Have you heard about me being the new seeker?"
"Oh shut up," Marcus smiled knowingly.
Harry learning about the prophecy and her parents.
"So who is going to join us?" Harriet coughed, trying to change the tone of the conversation.
With some interesting stuff,
"I just wanted to make sure that you know that I will step down if you really want the seeker position," She explained.
"You are so selfish! You know that? Can't you think of anyone else for a change!" Her Aunt stomped off, to go finish the dishes. Harriet was left crying in her own cupboard for the rest of the night. She wondered a lot of things that night, why was she treated so differently from Dudley? They were family. Isn't family supposed to love each other? Harriet was rapidly realizing that wasn't true for all families.
"Maybe next time, one of you can transform the other into a pocket watch. That way you won't be late, don't let it not happen again," She said firmly and turned around to walk back to her desk to sit down after the boys nodded. The boys sighed and all sat down in the back. McGonagall gave 5 more minutes to read the chapter to let the boys catch up but they decided to talk in the back. Hermione looked back in disgust at the boys which made Harry laugh silently. They started the lesson which was turning a match into a needle. Harry always have a hard time with this subject, she could never do it on purpose or when she wanted to, only ever on accident. Merry almost poked her eye out with the match and her wand somehow but in the end did get the needle. Neville couldn't even do anything to the match. Hermione got it on the 3rd try. Millicent somehow made the needle bright green. Draco made the needle but it did not look like a needle. Blaise... he didn't even try, he was just poking the match with the tip of his wand. Harriet set the match on fire which she stared at blankly until it somehow made the match a shiny gray, pointy needle.
"My name is Merry Baxter," Merry said after Harry wasn't replying to her question. Harry knew she was a pureblood from her last name.
So try me on and I will tell you
For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
"Yes," All of the boys' attention turned to her again.
"Oh good morning, Riley and Professor Snape," One girl jumped when she saw the two professors and two first years.
Those cunning folks use any means
"They did say it was in the dungeons, right?" Merry raised an eyebrow.
"Like..." She looked at her slightly frightened.
"It was very nice to meet you too," Harry blushed. They all said goodbye and went their separate ways.
"That is just because you have a crush on Draco," Millicent laughed.
"Are you a professor here?" Harry frowned, he was not up at the head tables for dinner last night.
Hopefully, you enjoyed this filler chapter about the rest of her classes, next chapter will be about flying and midnight mischievous. This chapter was supposed to come out earlier so the whole troll in the bathroom would be out on Halloween but for some reason, random events came up that I had to go to so sorry that it won't be on the exact day
"You are not in trouble, don't worry," He patted her shoulder and walked down the hallway. Due to Harriet's small size, she almost had to jog next to him. They walked around for a bit before they stopped at the Charms classroom.
"Oh yeah, I should probably get there early. He probably doesn't want me to be late," She got up, "Wish me luck." The girls all wished her luck as she left the Great Hall. She walked down the corridors to the empty field, looking at everything around her. She heard an annoyingly loud voice, Draco.
"I promise," Harriet rubbed Merry's hands comfortingly. They both started to giggle, "Should we go now?"
"Are you talking to the kitten?" Merry asked with her eyebrow raised.
"What did you do?" Merry whispered.
"It is very nice to meet you, Draco has talked no stop about you since he met you." Harriet was too focused on how soft and gentle her voice was to pay attention to how much Draco blushed at his mother's words. "It is such a pleasure to have a new close friend of his to stay here with us, you are welcome to treat this place as your home." She had a very kind and simple smile, Harriet nodded shyly and smiled back. He watched how scared the tiny girl to the point where she is trembling, how she is so hesitant to even look around.
"But I can invite you, trust me the Malfoy's will love you. Draco probably has talked non-stop about to them about you."
"Yes," Harry smirked.
"We have at least 2 hours of sleep, less than that even," Merry moaned while fluffing her pillow.
"Yeah, especially the seeker," He smiled lopsidedly.
"Well people seem to find Cedric Diggory to be good looking," She shrugged, he was alright. She didn't seem to think boys were all that important.
"Draco!" Merry laughed at him staring at her underwear. His face flushed deep red and he fidgeted nervously while looking at the ground.
"Good morning," Harriet said sweetly like always. Her Uncle was never in a good mood in the morning so it was wise to be on his better side if he had one that is.
"Mom, Dad, this is Harriet," Harriet finally paid attention to the older adults in the room. Both were very clean and elegant, their robes fit very nicely like they were tailored. Both were blond like Draco, and both wore black like Draco did. Draco's mother seemed nicer than his father who seemed to study her a bit. She looked down at her shoes, she looked so odd compared to them, they were so fancy and stunningly perfect while she is wearing baggy, messy clothes and her hair a mess, she probably had some dirt on her face too. She just wanted to shrink away from embarrassment, she never belonged to even set foot in this palace.
Dear Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall,
"Chinese?" He chuckled because he already knew the answer.
"Oh yeah, right. Let's go," She picked up her bag and looked again at him. He was still staring at her which made her want to stare back, but she had to go to class. So she looked forward and exited the Great Hall feeling his eyes on her as she walked out.
"Hopefully this class will be more entertaining," She sighed as they walked into the classroom.
"Blood please!" He screamed and grabbed her hand. He carefully poked her finger with a sharp quill until it bled.  He smeared her bloody finger on the parchment.
"That is... fucked up," She stared at her.
"I know," Harriet sighed and sat up to play with the fabric on her jeans. Merry knew that she wasn't going to say that she wa going to miss her friends and the other people here.
"Good job though Harry," Marcus ruffed her hair and yanked her into his side when she was about to fall from his force. She giggled loudly and slapped his arm playfully. Daisy picked up Harriet in a big hug and kissed her cheek lightly.
---------------------------------------
"You like that don't you? You bloody freak!" Piers shouted. Dudley turned her to face him and punched her under her right eye. She shouted again and fell to the ground. They both spit on her and went into class and shut the door as the final bell rang. Harry started to cry silently as she curled up in a ball on the ground. She stayed there for awhile until she stopped crying. She got up and went into the nearest girls bathroom. She walked in and checked to see if anyone else was there, no one was there. She went to the mirror to see a large bruise already starting to form. Harry stared at herself in the mirror. She had long, wavy raven hair with deep blue eyes that also had green near the pupil. She was very petite with no curves and barely made 4'6". She had very pale skin and plump pink lips. Also, she had the longest eyelashes she has ever seen. Harry didn't want to go back to class, during classes at the end of the year you only would watch movies or talk about the summer. Movies were boring to her because she wanted to read instead and the books were always better. She never had anything to talk about for plans in the summer but it didn't matter because no one never called on her. Plus she always envied that kids got to go on trips with their parents.
Holy crap this is really offseason
"What you were practically undressing Potter in your mind," Kyle teased Cedric.
"I'm Oliver Feose," He said. He wanted to add that he was Harry's guardian but he was not legally so he didn't want to raise questions.
"I just don't like it," Harriet hugged herself, trying to comfort herself.
"Oh, alright," Harry huffed. They walked into the classroom to see most of the Slytherin's already in the room but only two Gryffindors, Hermione and Neville. While Merry sat down and pulled out her phone to text who knows, Harry waved at Neville shyly who waved back blushing deeply.
"They aren't going to kill you," Merry laughed at Harriet pouting on her bed in fear. Harriet seems really happy to be with Merry all break, her mother absolutely loves her. Harriet seems to be calmer and less afraid or anxious when men aren't around so she probably feels more welcome at Merry's home than her Aunt's with two men.
Harry coughed and took a step back, "I'm Harry." The other girl gave her a weird look and turned to leave with her nose up. Neville thanked her again and followed after the other girl.
"Don't scare her," He growled.
You'll make your real friends,
"How are you?"
"I am Gemma Farley, Head Girl, and this is Jason Zang, Head Boy," The boy just seemed to growl at the first years. The girl seemed nice enough to Harry. "We will be showing you to your dorms and home for the next 7 years." With that the prefects and Slytherin first years left to go to the dungeons. The first year Slytherins walked out of the Great Hall first with Harry in the back. Merry and Draco were on both sides of her and both trying to get her attention. They would both say look and point to something at the same time. The paintings were moving and talking! The stairs were moving also! Why is this place so weird? But like in a good way, in the way that made Harry want to learn more about this place and all of its secrets it may hold. The more beautiful the place, the darker the secrets.
