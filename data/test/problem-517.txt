“Good morning!  Glad you managed to rouse the boy from bed.  Harry have a seat and chat with your friends.  If you’ll keep an eye on Ted I’ll pop out and pick up breakfast for all of us.” Sirius offered.
Hermione faced five fingers, Theo faced four, and Susan faced one.  “Shocking, Hermione can be found in the library!” Neville exclaimed.  “I’ll pick next, most likely to be found snogging in the castle.”  Fingers quickly started flying.  Pansy had the fingers of Draco, Blaise, Theo, Millicent, Susan, and Morag pointed her way.  Harry was targeted by Hermione, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Hannah.
“Who said I know what I’m doing?  I’m just looking forward to getting pissed and watching you all make fools of yourselves.” Harry laughed.  “Well, considering we are supposed to get to know each other better, we could address the preconceived ideas we all harbor.  Anyone ever play Most Likely?” There were a few nods around the room, but most seemed unfamiliar with the game.  “It’s a pretty straightforward game and easy to catch on.  We all write down something on a slip of parchment that we think someone is likely to do.  We then mix them up and take turns reading them out.  For example, one might state ‘Most likely to run through the Great Hall starkers’, we then each quickly point at who we think that could most likely apply to.  For every finger pointed at you, you must take a shot.  You don’t have to vote if you are unsure, there’s no penalty.  Since the shots can add up quickly, we can just let the shots sit in front of us at the table and take them as we feel comfortable.  Gives us time to talk and get to know each other too during the game without getting black out drunk in 4 rounds.  If you don’t have a shot on the table you are welcome to drink one anyway.  It’s really just a simple game to see what others think of you, true or not.”
Hermione gasped in awe.  Creating potions wasn’t unheard of as advanced potions masters did it all the time.  That was where the shock came in.  Draco hadn’t even sat his N.E.W.T.s and he had invented a potion of this caliber?  If it worked as he said it did then he’d easily make history.  “I’d love to see your work and theory.  How long have you been working on potions like this?”
year.  Severus helped me with the early stages of it and the first several batches of failure.  I succeeded in this one on Monday.”
for so long, they both lost any semblance of who they were.  They’ve been at St. Mungo’s since then with no hope to ever regain cognitive function.  From what I understand, Neville visits often and always has, but they have no clue who he is nor do they remember his visits.
“Seamus, it’s Veritaserum.  And enough to last a very long time, it’d seem.” Hermione answered him.  “What do they expect us to do with it?”
Harry sank down on the couch next to Hermione and chuckled at the parchments littered with notes and schedules on the table in front of him.  Trust Hermione to figure out the best class load and study schedule as soon as she possibly could.  If he was the Slytherin hiding in Gryffindor, she was the Ravenclaw.  “Well, I assume you are going to hand me a parchment with a list of classes you think I should take and we going to fight over that.  After a few minutes you’ll give in and tell me I don’t take my education seriously enough and should add more classes.  You’ll be a bit cross until I smile at you and then you’ll cave with the concession that if I was only taking those few classes I had better focus and do them well.  Then I thought we’d go shopping as I could use more than the two outfits I have that fit if we are to wear them under our robes.  We could see if anyone wants to join us and maybe do dinner out or maybe hit up a club or something?”
“I don’t think it will be that far off.  I said earlier we were tired of fighting and I think that goes for many others in the school as well.  You’ll always have the ones who will refuse to try, but the vast majority I think just want to enjoy themselves finally and learn.   I myself am only taking a few classes this year so I can relax and finish out a year without trouble.”
“Not really.  Hannah is doing something today with Susan and I haven’t really made a decision what to do yet.  Figured I’d wait to see what everyone else gets up to and maybe tag along if someone decides to get into something.”
“You’re running this show, Harry.  So, what do you suggest we play?”  Seamus questioned as Dean brought over the Firewhiskey and shot glasses.
Draco sat nodding in agreement.  “I can understand your reasoning and while I had hoped we could try now, I respect your choice.  I’m not going anywhere, and I can wait as long as you need for you to feel comfortable with it all.
The next chapter will have us finally on the way to Hogwarts!  Thank you all for the kind comments and the kudos.  I hope you all continue to enjoy.
“I’m honestly relieved to hear that.  I won’t lie and say the thought that you could have known and walked away not caring never crossed my mind, but I always hoped you just didn’t know.
“Just in time, Mr. Potter.  Please have a seat, while we wait on our lunch, I thought we could catch up.  How are things going with your peers?”
“Albus Dumbledore named you as his heir and left most of his belongings and money to you.” Ragnok informed him.
Harry pulled the parchment from his pocket and the two of them took a seat at the kitchen table.  There were several properties listed along with apparition coordinates and brief descriptions about them.  The first portion of the list was what he had inherited from his mother and father, Potter Manor and the house in Godric’s Hollow.  Neither were unexpected.  The two of them discussed these options but quickly disqualified them.  Potter Manor was too big for one teenager to live in full time.  Sirius mentioned a quidditch pitch it boasted and Harry was sure to make use of it, but had no need for a manor at this point in his life.  They did decide to check in on it in over the weekend while Teddy was with Andromeda.  If the house elves hadn’t abandoned the property after so long without a Master present Harry decided to see if one or two would like to come serve Sirius at Grimmauld.
“I’ll look into it the next time I head into Diagon Alley. Onto real issues, have you thought any more about what you want to do now? You know you are welcome here as long as you want but you’re young and I think you need to finally take advantage of the fact that you can leave the house without being afraid someone is around the corner waiting to kill you. It doesn’t have to be Hogwarts and it doesn’t have to be the Ministry but you need some kind of plan.”
Harry thanked Sirius for the wakeup call and hugged him as he left the room. He had a lot of thinking to do.
“Good morning, love.” Draco looked up at voice of the perpetually late woman’s face then pointedly cast a Tempus raising his eyebrow at her.  “I know, Draco, I’m late as usual and as usual you are going to huff and puff and pretend to be annoyed with me when you actually see it as an endearing trait of mine.” Pansy winked then winked at him.  “Besides, you know I’m always going to be late yet you show up on time anyway.  What does that say about yourself do you think?  If you want to really be honest it is you wasting your own time not me.”
No matter, he took to the skies, let his worries slide off his mind, and lost himself in the wind.  He never felt as free as he did in the air.  He spent the next couple of hours catching and releasing the snitch without noticing anything about his surroundings other than the little golden ball.  As he pulled up from a close Wronski Feint applause shocked him out of his obliviousness and he noticed the stands had filled with about 40 people watching him.  He had no clue how long they had been there or what even how long he’d been outside himself.  He noticed his former head of house in the stands as well and made his way over to her.
They all agreed visiting Phoenix Perch today was for the best.  As Ron, Hermione, and Harry cleaned up the mess from breakfast Sirius fire-called Andromeda and asked her if she could take Teddy for a few hours while they investigated what might be hidden at Phoenix Perch.  She agreed and came flooed over and less than an hour later the four of them were off.
“Harry, if you would rather open it privately and share it with us later that’s understandable.” Hermione remarked quietly.
While Hermione agreed Ron and Sirius were much harder to convince.  “Snape was a hateful git, Harry.  He terrorized students and fancied himself above everyone else even with his greasy hair and his hook nose.  I appreciate what he did for us as much as you do but, really?!” Ron bellowed.
“We’ll see, Potter.  We’ll see.”  Pansy grabbed a slip out of the pile in the middle when everyone got comfortable and read “Most likely to be found in the library. Oh, that’s completely boring.” She sighed.
“Harry.  Sure, we can start with about 40 I guess.  I don’t know that we’ll make it through everyone’s tonight as late as it is and with as many of us playing.  A few of us could end up passed out quickly depending on what everyone has chosen.”
Now it was time to bring down the hammer, so to speak.  She had spoken to all of her professors earlier in the week and let them know turning a blind eye to bullying would not be acceptable this year or ever again.  She knew there were more than a few former Death Eaters and Death Eater supporters sitting in the Great Hall right now.   She refused to allow vigilante justice within the walls of her school.  She also knew Mr. Potter and Miss Granger faced a difficult road.  “One last announcement before I release you to your common rooms and dorms.  I hope you are all listening closely as the punishments will be extreme for any infractions to the rules I am about to explain.  In the past there has been a blind eye turned to the bullying, the bitterness, and the sometimes hatred that has gone on here.  There will be no more.  I do not care what side of the war you believed in or fought for.  The war is over.  There were deep losses on both sides and I will not tolerate hearing that loss is acceptable because to quote an unwise Hufflepuff I overheard earlier ‘Death Eaters deserve pain’.  I disagree vehemently.   No one deserves pain.  There is not a single convicted student in this room.  You are not the judge to decide vengeance should be taken.  I will warn you only this once.  After hours and hours of research and collaboration with your professors, Aurors, and Unspeakables as well as cooperation from the castle herself there is now a new ward in place.  This ward recognizes intent and spellwork.  If you cast any spell towards another student that triggers this ward your wand will be allowed to cast it, however, it will then wrap a reflecting shield around you that will send it back to you.  You will also be trapped inside the shield.  The closest professor will be alerted when the ward is triggered and upon their arrival the student will be released from the ward and escorted to my office.  You will receive one warning and one warning only before you are expelled.  I need not remind you that students who are expelled have their wands broken.  I do not care what house you reside in as the favoritism that has ran rampant is gone.  We are all survivors of tragedy.  Do not make me regret placing my faith in you to rise above and move forward.”
“Oh, just in the neighborhood and thought I’d swing by and see what you were up to. It’s been so long since I’ve seen you so I figured I’d check in.” Blaise smirked and winked at Draco.
“One of our rooms is fine.  I’m pretty sure all we have to do is tell the others we are talking potion theory and they will all zone out and forget we exist.”  Draco chuckled.  He was excited and scared at the possibility in front of him.  His version of the truth potion was grand for sure, but it didn’t have the ability to change people’s lives like this one.  If he could make this one work, he could help countless witches and wizards as well as right some of the wrongs his family had done over the years.  “For now, let’s just relax and have fun.  Theo, take this beautiful lady over there and show her how terrible you are at dancing.”  You’d have to be blind not to notice the looks the two had been sending each other all day.  He figured they’d be together by Yule.
“Harry, it’s fine. They will understand. You don’t have to have all of the answers now for what you want to do in the future, you just have to realize you now have a future and it’s fine to live it.” Sirius stated. “Now, I’ll deal with the clean-up. You should spend the day thinking about what you want to do, long term or short term, and I want some kind of idea tonight.”
“Search the ashes and find the smoke?  What the hell is the old coot talking about?” Sirius was as confused as Harry himself was.
“I think you just found yourself a project, Mr. Potter.  I’d be delighted if you would put together a proposal so I could bring it in front of the board.  It doesn’t have to be a final draft, just an idea and what you’ve told me in the last few minutes.”
Draco looked up at the door each time the bell rang in hopes it was Harry.  He’d gotten here almost an hour early because he could no longer sit and wait at the Manor.  It was now a few minutes after 8 and he was so anxious he was about to burst.  He told himself to calm down and take a deep breath and didn’t hear the bell the next time it rang which signaled Harry’s entrance.
“When did you plan on doing that?  I don’t want to rush you or him, but I am dying to meet him.”  Draco, who had always been one to veer towards the dramatic, wasn’t even kidding.  His thoughts since last night centered solely on that beautiful little boy and his incredible father.
Pansy cleared her throat and read the note aloud.  “Students, it is our hope you use the items inside to begin to repair and broker new relationships. It has been said ‘If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.’  Be responsible and we will see you on Monday. – Your professors” She then held up 2 large bottles of Ogden’s Old Firewhiskey adorned with bows.  “There’s a load of potion bottles at the bottom of the box too.”  She placed the bottles on the table and looked back in the box.  “Let’s see….there’s at least 20 hangover potions, a handful of pain killer potions, and –“ She gasped “No fucking way.  Draco, come here, is this what I think it is?”
Harry sat looking out the window of 12 Grimmauld Place at the passing muggles while trying to decide where to go from here. The battles were finished, the war won, the madman was dead. Now what? Since joining the magical world he’d faced one trial after the other with seemingly no end and never thought he’d survive to have to worry about a future. Hermione thought he should go back to Hogwarts and sit his N.E.W.T.s with her and the rest of the returning students. Ron was starting auror training in the fall instead much to her dismay. Harry didn’t feel right with either suggestion and didn’t want to make a choice while feeling so frozen in confusion to regret it later.
“I’ll work on it and try to get it to you by next Saturday.  That gives me time to talk to the others and see who is willing to help.  Will that be soon enough?”  Harry was flattered if a bit over whelmed.  He really didn’t even know he had these ideas but they just seemed to pour out of him.  At least this gave him something to do and knowing he’d left his mark on Hogwarts beyond the crazy adventures was a welcome idea.
“Actually, Hermione was just telling me about the bookstore on the lower level and I’d like to check it out.  I’ll meet you all back there later.”  Theo turned to go but paused before walking away.  He had spent morning annoyed at the fashion hounds he called his friends until Hermione noticed him withdrawing and engaged him in an in-depth conversation about muggle vs wizarding shopping districts.  At first, he thought she was trying to look down her nose at his ignorance of muggle ways but soon realized she, like him, simply loved gaining any knowledge about anything.  Mundane or not.  Here they were nearly 4 hours later and were debating the intricacies of how to adapt a Gringotts account to connect to the cards the muggles were using in place of a physical money exchange.  “Unless you wouldn’t mind joining me, Hermione?  I’d love to get your suggestions and opinions if you don’t have anything else going on.”
“I don’t really know.  Yes, the voice was distinctly male and could have been charmed that way, I don’t think it was.  It just sounded muffled and garbled more so than complete fabrication.  Plus, their behavior and mannerisms just seemed more male to me.” Sirius shrugged “I could be completely off base like Dumbledore suspects, but I really don’t think I am.”
Hermione, you weren’t here last year, but one of the main reasons so many students held out hope is because of Neville Longbottom.  I don’t doubt that he saved the lives of many as well.  He stood up to the Carrows and protected the younger years fiercely.  Some people think his bravery started when he killed Nagini, but if you ask me, it started way before then.  I don’t know that I can fix what my insane aunt did or to what extent, but I’m attempting to try and I’d like the both of you to help.”
They spent one last night together after the graduation ceremony and the next morning Draco packed a bag and walked away from all he had ever known and quite possibly the only man who would ever fully know who he was and still care about him.  He made his way to the Ministry to submit his diploma and sign paperwork that finished his probation and made his way down to the portkey office.  He asked for the next portkey available and found himself in America.
Draco groaned to himself.  Living in the same dorm and classes with Harry without giving in and approaching him might be the death of him.  Pansy would certainly take advantage of this in her scheming plans.
year.  I knew I had an aunt in Azkaban, but I had never met her to my knowledge.  No one ever told stories of her or spoke of why she was imprisoned.  I, obviously, knew it had to do with Snakeface, but no details.
year and have had so many false starts and failures I’ve nearly given up countless times.  However, I really believe I am close to a breakthrough and possibly a finish it soon.  I think I’ve been so frustrated by the complexity that I’m missing something simple but can’t determine what it could be.
Draco was slightly uncomfortable.  He wasn’t ashamed of his work in any sense, but he knew it would remain as nothing more than experiments for him.  He’d never be known as anything more than a Deatheater and Lucius Malfoy’s son.  “I’ve been tinkering with many potions over the years but this one since 6
Hermione, I’m sure you know at least a little of what I’m going to share but Theo I do not think you are aware.  I know it doesn’t seem quite right to ask without saying why, but I’m going to ask for a Wizard’s Oath before going too far into explanations. I don’t care about my research getting out and normally wouldn’t be so presumptuous to require one, but this involves a very personal and tragic story for someone else so therefore, I think it’d be the right thing to do.”  He knew it was a risk as he really needed their help, but he was inflexible on this point.
Minerva had hoped more from this year would return but was happy that all the houses were represented.  “Good evening.  I have several things to discuss with you all but we will do it from your new common room instead of here in the Great Hall.  If you will follow me I will lead you there.”  Minerva began leading them and explaining how in the remodel they had built a new dorm that overlooked the courtyard for prefects and remodeled two of the rooms set aside for visiting professors and family members for the purpose of housing the Head Boy and Head Girl.  They decided to use the prefect’s area this year as housing for the 8
“What exactly are you envisioning that seems so far out of reach if you don’t mind me asking, ma’am?”
“Come on, ‘Mione, we might be able to coexist for the school year without killing each other but it would take a miracle for us to suddenly trust each other.”  Harry pointed out and noticed nodding of most agreeing with him.  “My guess is they expect us to get drunk and spill our secrets to each other so we all feel vulnerable and off kilter.  Hard to hate someone when you know they’ve tossed off to Snape in a bikini.”  He winked and laughed.
“Well, I guess the easiest place to start would be the beginning.  I went into eighth year with no plans on what to do after graduation, as you know.  After you left I really was just more confused as to who I was and what I wanted.  I sat around Grimmauld for longer than I care to admit without leaving and only seeing Hermione or Ron when they’d pop in.  I hadn’t been feeling well for a couple of months but didn’t think much of it.  I hadn’t been sleeping or eating well and between that and the depression I had still yet to overcome, I wrote it off as nothing when I could even be bothered to worry about myself.
“I can’t help but agree whoever this chap is needs to be thanked at the least and I’d say deserves more honoring than Snape does myself.” Ron added.
that it is.  Until I am sure, bringing up false hope would be cruel, and I’ve already been cruel enough for many lifetimes.  I refuse to take a chance someone could overhear me and let it be known to them.”
Harry and Hermione chuckled as they all stepped back.  Harry reached for and pulled a shirt over his head before the trio, righted once again, made their way down the stairs to the kitchen.
For the potion, there needs to be both a reparative and possibly a restorative.  I am 50/50 on if the restorative part is even possible and in some cases, it might prove unnecessary, but the memories of Neville visiting through the years have to be locked away somewhere.  I think if we rejuvenate the brain and nerves and immediately repair them afterwards we’d be on the right path.
Staring out the window lost in his thoughts Harry didn’t even hear the door open and close when Hermione entered.  She was thankful to get the chance to complete her last year and couldn’t wait to see the castle again.  This year promised to bring forth all kinds of surprises and hopefully mend bridges that had seemed impassable this time a year ago.  She knew Ron not being a part of their life every day like he had in the past would alter the relationships of the three but was confident it would hold strong even if it wobbled a bit for the first few months.  They’d been through too much together and were so woven into the fabric of each other’s lives that they’d always be connected in one way or the other.  She felt the train begin to stir and pulled the shades while settling in.  As she turned take a seat across from Harry he smiled at her and dropped his glamour.  She returned the smile and settled in for their last ride on the Hogwarts Express.
And obviously, Draco had known that Potter had a life outside of school, that he must be doing something during his summers, but he had always thought that the boy was busy throwing himself into other adventures, and not sitting on his hands in a muggle suburb until two years ago where he was rescued by Black and Lupin.
have a chip on my shoulder! And it should have been simple, if I had only just pulled myself together, found the right angle, but I couldn’t - I can’t - I’m not-”
But Potter is nothing if not confrontational, so Draco can only hide away for so long before he eventually corners him in the library.
The wing is empty, except for Madam Pomfrey and a single occupied bed that has the mint green blinds closed around it. Harry meets her gaze, and she nods over to the closed-off bed, with a worried wrinkle between her brows.
Harry glanced at his watch and saw that while they were sitting there time had flown by and Caelum’s school let out in another 5 minutes. “I didn’t realize it was as late as it was already. Give me a moment to let someone know to grab Caelum from school.” He pulled out his mobile and sent off a message in his group chat with Hermione and Ron to see if either of them were able to grab Caelum.  He wanted to finalize some plans with Draco while he was here in front of him.  Ron quickly replied he was done for the day and was already waiting outside on the steps for him.  Harry thanked him and told him he’d call when he left to figure out where they were.  “Ron is going to pick him up.  If I know my son like I think I do, he will talk his uncle into ice cream and dropping into the twin’s shop.  I don’t want to overwhelm him with you just showing up so let me take him home and at least tell him you are here.  Are you free for dinner tonight?  Normally on Friday nights a bunch of us from school get together and have a pot luck free for all dinner starting around 7.  You could come over to mine around 3 and meet him.  If you’re comfortable with it, you are welcome to stay for dinner or we can meet up tomorrow at the park.”
“Quite.” McGonagall smugly hoped one or two of the first years drove the young man in front of her as crazy as he and his father had driven her over the years.
When he entered the conservatory, he was greeted by his mother and his best friend Blaise. “Good afternoon Mother. Nippy failed to inform me that you had called in the reinforcements to attempt to convince me to return to Hogwarts.” Blaise had been on the neutral side of the war refusing to declare an allegiance or even entertain a conversation with anyone who brought Voldemort or the need to pick a side up. Because of this he had no reason not to head back in September and was trying to guilt Draco into joining him in any way he could. Now that Mother and Blaise had joined forces he didn’t know how much longer he could hold out on his refusal. They were both forces to be reckoned with alone so together he had no chance.
The quartet were currently in a carriage being pulled to the school by thestrals which sadly they now all could see.  The conversation whirled around Draco without his participation.  He was feeling extremely anxious and hoped the feast would pass quickly.  He wanted to get this day over with and shut himself inside the curtains of his bed.  Without much internal debate at all Draco had concluded that there was no longer a need to remain the hateful tosser he had been the past 7 years.  Malfoy was dead and gone and it was time to introduce Draco people other than his small group of friends.  He was sure he’d face suspicion and doubt but keeping up a façade he no longer needed was pointless.
“Draco and him were very close.  He was actually Draco’s godfather and the two of them spent a lot of time together both in and out of school.  His death hit Draco hard.”  Pansy swallowed the last of her drink and pulled Harry towards the dance floor.  “This night is too young to be this sad.  You are now required to dance with me to cheer me up.  I see your Granger over there with Theo, let’s go show them how it’s done.”
Draco nodded his acceptance as he stood and replaced his coat.  They exited the tavern ignoring the whispers and stares directed at them and quickly found themselves standing in Diagon Alley’s apparition area.  The walk took no more than a minute but the tension for the upcoming conversation was so heavy on them both that it seemed to take much longer.
“I don’t know that we were ready for it before.  I have always noticed how separate we are and the lack of any available options to overcome that.  The Room of Requirement could only host one group at a time.  The library is large enough, but you can’t let loose and get loud.  The weather isn’t always good enough to make the lakeside a viable option.  The great hall is big enough, but doesn’t offer privacy or places to lounge and stretch out.”  Here he shrugged.  “The way it has been isn’t bad.  It’s just that now there is the option of another way that could work just as well or better. It can’t hurt to try. I also have one other idea if you are up to hearing it?”
He lets out an exasperated sigh. “I know you’re not here to make small talk, so just say what you want to say already.”
Potter holds his gaze for a moment before lowering his wand and letting go. He doesn’t move away, however, and stands looming over Draco as he says,
“Is it about Malfoy?” he asks, perspective as ever, which Harry realises, he doesn’t get enough credit for. He had matured a lot since the attack on his father last Christmas, become more observant of other people and their emotions.
“That sounds lovely,” he says, trying to sound genuine, but he must have pulled a face muscle saying it, because Potter is looking at him like he’s just announced he had invited the Dark Lord for dinner.
When he’s eventually set down, he quickly spots his friends, sitting in the middle of the room, drinks in hand and loopy smiles on their faces. He sits down next to Ginny, who immediately hands him a shot glass filled with something dark and spicy, and he doesn’t hesitate to drown it, feeling that familiar burn travel down his throat.
Even though Malfoy’s wounds are healed, his guilt is eating him up from the inside, and he’s ready to take on any punishment the professor will give out.
“You know, you don’t need to hide your relationship in front of me,” he says as they all four sit at the kitchen table. Today’s meal is a bland English one, for his sake, he figures, and the notion is revoltingly heartwarming.
“You know why, Potter,” and the way he says it, quietly and jaded, makes Harry realise that he can only be talking about Malfoy.
“I didn’t...I did it for my father, he…” His words die out on his tongue, but Harry can figure out the rest. Lucius Malfoy was imprisoned last summer after being caught in the Department of Mysteries, together with a few other Death Eaters. It was only a matter of time before Malfoy was pushed to take his place.
Something passes over Black’s face, and the next moment he’s barking with laughter. Lupin joins him with a silent laugh that he’s trying to hide behind his hand, and Potter simply stares at Draco with a bemused grin.
He’s fine, honestly, they don’t need to worry about him, but he appreciates it nonetheless, even if it does make him feel guilty at times. He knows he’s prone to attract danger, in fact, it seems like that’s the only thing he does, but he can’t help it.
He wakes up the next morning, still dressed in yesterday's clothes, but someone, presumably Ron, had taken his shoes off while he slept, and put a blanket over him. It’s Friday, the day before the match, and it dawns on him that he will have to explain to his team that he can’t join them tomorrow. He glances at the clock. Classes don’t start for another thirty minutes. He looks at his nightstand, where a stack of books is balancing on the corner...books...
Was it because he was a pureblood? A Slytherin? A Malfoy? Granted, his father has some conservative views, but he has never said anything bad about same-sex relationships, hell, his own aunt has been living with a partner for the last twenty or so years, and no one batted an eye when they showed up for Christmas dinner at the Manor.
Two weeks later, Lupin informs him that Dumbledore has died. Passed away in his sleep, he tells him, before leaving Draco alone in the library.
“You alright there, Neville?” Harry asks, not able to hide his amusement, and Neville just nods before curling up in his own bed, still wearing his clothes, but mysteriously only one shoe.
Draco makes his way towards the table and sits across from Potter, tucking his feet under the chair.
“How are you Blaise? What brings you here today?” Draco asked unbelievingly. He had just seen Blaise last night so he knew there was nothing he could need to talk about so soon after parting. It hadn’t even been twelve hours since they last parted and knowing Blaise he slept the majority of those hours away.
Everyone except Draco laughed at the exchange.  Thankfully no one, mind Pansy, noticed this fact.  Draco couldn’t tell if Harry was flirting with Blaise or just joking.  He knew all kinds of pointless facts about him that he could learn from afar, but he didn’t know how he interacted with his friends.  “Well then in that case, Harry, what do you suggest we do?” Draco smiled widely.  He nearly shivered at how good it felt to finally call Harry by his name outside of his thoughts.
A quarter before ten, he sighs and puts the essay away in his bag, having only written a few lines and corrected one spelling mistake during his impromptu study session. He’ll make Hermione help him, she always does, even if it does come with slightly annoyed muttering.
It’s closer to dawn by the time the party dies down, and Harry, followed by Ron, makes his way to their dorm.
Harry nods and feels a rogue tear stream down his cheek. He dries it irritably and appreciates his professor for ignoring it.
I have so much fun writing in Draco's POV, he's such a pretentious prick lol. But also, he needs therapy.
“He has to. There’s too much going on right now, Harry, I can’t explain all of it, but we’ll be able to tell you soon. Just worry about school for now, okay?”
“I’ve already learned Hindi and we’re planning a trip to New Delhi when I graduate,” Potter proclaims proudly.
He thinks of Snape then, of the man who used to be a Death Eater and a spy, who has bullied him for six years, and yet still jumped between him and a werewolf when he was thirteen, kept down the fort when Dumbledore was banished last year, rebelled against Umbridge in his own way, by seeing through fingers when he saw DA members sneaking around.
“You’re mad, Harry. We can’t let a Death Eater into the Order’s headquarters, let alone a Malfoy!” Sirius exclaims, brows furrowed in disapprovement.
He wants to hex him, just so he’d stop looking at him, but then he would have a new problem to deal with, so instead, he just averts his gaze and walks past him towards the door. Potter lets him through without objections, which he is thankful for.
At that, Malfy lifts his shirt to show Harry the white streaks across his abdomen, at which Harry flinches away. And yet still, his words worry him, and he gathers his courage as he takes a seat next to the bed and meets Malfoy’s cold gaze.
Such a silly thing, really, to cry over a forgotten birthday. He hadn’t expected gifts or any celebration, he doubted his prison guards even knew it was his birthday, but still…
“Are you enjoying your meal?” Potter asks, at first glance genuinely, but then Draco sees the wrinkles in his eyes as if he’s holding back a laugh.
Draco paced his room anxiously awaiting Theo and Hermione’s arrival.  The two had told him over breakfast they’d meet him at 10 and they should be there any minute.  He sighed and took a seat as his desk to glanced at his notes on the potion so far.  Opening up to Theo was no big deal but Hermione?  That was something new.  Yes, he wanted to be himself and not the puppet his father engineered, but he had planned to ease into it and do it from the shadows.  This felt like diving into shark infested waters covered in blood.
Hermione takes his hand in her own. “Let’s talk about this later, okay. We’ll be late for class.” Harry follows her absentmindedly out of the classroom and towards their next class.
, like they were concerned for him, and maybe that’s why he’s so annoyed by it because it’s even more absurd when it’s
“You were complete prats, but it was very entertaining,” Ginny comments from her seat next to Hermione, making Ron stick his tongue out at her. She returns it with a grimace, before turning back to her untouched eggs.
Hermione seems to notice his distress, because she flips the newspaper in half and puts a soft hand on his.
He realises then, that he’s already done it, he trusted him with his biggest secret, and instead of antagonizing him, Potter risked it all to save his life.
“Well, my mother certainly never approved of the relationship,” he says, at which Draco has to huff because come on, obviously that wasn’t the reason.
They play for hours, and only stop because Kreacher calls them down for dinner. When they land on the wooden floor and put away the brooms, Potter puts a hand on his shoulder and says:
Leave a comment if you liked it! Or don't, I'm not gonna tell you what to do, although comments are appreciated. Thanks for reading anyway, though :) my tumblr is @angsty90steen and I might post updates on the fic there.
“Let go of me,” he says and feels the tears escape his eyes and run down his cheeks. It’s like the hospital wing all over again.
“The one you use to cure yourself of hangovers,” Ron finishes for Harry, before he begins to fill up his plate with every single thing in his immediate radius.
He draws the curtains around his bed and lays in a red-hued darkness, watching the specks of dust dance in the beam of sunlight that shines through a gap between his curtains, his head too full of thoughts to just
They must be putting something in the water at Gryffindor, because it’s so obvious to any person capable of complex thought, that Potter did not come to make small talk, and is simply stalling for time, thinking that he has to warm up to the thing he actually wants to say, when in fact, there is no need, because Draco is seventeen, not five, and can handle whatever it is Potter wants to tell him.
He looks up to meet Potter’s gaze over the top of the parchment and is horrified to find him looking
But then, his eyes land on an empty seat next to Zabini, a seat which he knows Malfoy usually occupies, and something tugs at his stomach, and he thinks he’s about to vomit, but then realizes that it’s another, much more familiar feeling - panic.
Draco rolls his eyes at his surprised voice. He can be nice, if he wants to, there’s no need to make a big deal of it. The conversation continues, and Draco tries his best to take part and be civilized, and it’s worth it, if only to see the boggled looks on their faces.
“Good game. Let’s do it again sometime,” before he runs out of the room and leaps down the stairs towards the kitchen.
In the library, he takes out his charms essay, and tries to work on it for the next three hours. He’s sitting by an open window that’s looking over the quidditch pitch, and can hear the students make their way towards the stands shortly before the match starts. He wills himself not to look, knowing that it will only serve to make him miserable, and instead stares intently at his essay, reading the same passage over and over.
Remus lets out an exasperated sigh. “We’ll see what we can do, but we can’t promise anything, not yet at least.”
Draco follows him at a slower pace, as that warm feeling begins to grow in his chest again. It’s odd to have Potter
Anyone else got really into HP during the quarantine or just me? Anyway, this is my first HP fic so don't judge, and also, this is kind of written already in the text, but just for clarity - Sirius is alive and well, since Harry actually used his mirror in fifth year, and Harry is staying with him and Remus over the summers.
His first instinct is to take out the map, but he had left that in the dorm. Then, an impulsive thought occurs, and he’s about to go over and ask Zabini himself where Malfoy is, because he’s not here,
Upon seeing the horrified look on his face, Hermione smiles reassuringly. “Don’t worry, you only ever told us about it. After that, you were too busy challenging everyone to compete against you and Ron in beer pong.”
It was a lot like being with Blaise or Pansy, and surprisingly enough, Potter could even keep up with his dry humour.
As he makes his way back, he realizes that with the book gone, he can say goodbye to his good grades in Potions, but in hindsight, grades seemed so meaningless compared to the repercussions of a spell like that falling into the wrong hands. Or even in the right hands, it’s still dangerous.
A fifth-year he doesn’t remember the name of notices him and announces to the room: “Harry is back!” at which a loud cheer erupts, and before he knows it, he is swallowed by the crowd and hoisted up by his quidditch teammates, who have seemingly forgiven him for getting detention or have had enough to drink to forget it, as they are chanting his name.
“I don’t-I just wanted to see if you were doing okay,” he says, and Draco’s just about to roll his eyes at the notion that Potter, of all people, would care about
All this time, the boy who he’s been taking advice from, who’d help him through a subject he hated, all this time, that boy had known a dark spell that could have killed his rival. Harry wants to throw the book away, or better yet, burn it, to make sure that no one ever saw the spell written in its margins.
- back at the manor, and he bites back a comment as he’s led into it by his former Defence professor. He doesn’t comment on the state of the man’s clothes either, nor his shoes, or the house that they're currently in, even if all three look haggard and antiquated.
No, Malfoy was not a Death Eater, and he was not a killer. He was a boy, just like Harry, caught in a war that is much, much bigger than himself and forced to choose sides lest he be disinherited by his own family.
“No. Like it or not, you’re under the Order’s protection now, and despite what you might think, no one in this house is out to get you, least of all me.”
“Let me,” he says, his voice quiet, but still commanding, and Harry lets go of Malfoy so that Snape can help him.
It wasn’t much, but it was something, and while Harry despises the man, he knows that he had helped him, in his own bitter and reluctant way, and if a man like Snape can put his past behind and help out the son of his rival, then surely Malfoy could redeem himself as well.
He shuts himself in his room and is about to write a long letter to Pansy, but finds himself unable to put his feelings down on paper, and instead stares at the blank piece of parchment as his quill drips ink onto it, and it spreads across the surface in small black rivers.
“I’ve seen evil, I’ve looked into Voldemort’s eyes and seen nothing but hate and insanity, but when I attacked Malfoy in the bathroom, he was
But of course, that pathetic display was enough to win over Saint Potter’s favour, and before he knew it, he was sitting in Dumbledore’s office, mere meters away from the man he had been sent to assassinate, and
“That I was a bigot?” he says, plucking a small potato with his fork and chewing it before he speaks again, with a hope that Potter would see it and pick up some table manners.
His throat feels dry and he gulps down a glass of water from his nightstand. Ron is snoring peacefully in his bed, drooling on his own pillow, and Harry smiles fondly at his best friend, before he remembers his dream, and out of pure paranoia, he reaches for the Marauder Map and locates the Slytherin common room.
“I’m here,” Draco answers dryly, not meeting his gaze and instead pretends to be too occupied with the book in his hands to acknowledge Potter any further.
“I’ll only eat it if you will,” he says, a condition which Harry can agree to. They split the frog and eat a piece at the same time. Malfoy still eyes him, but soon enough, the colour returns to his cheeks and he glances at the card, and then, his eyes begin to water again.
“I-You-You don’t know what you heard,” he stammers out, but Harry has obviously hit something, so he prods on.
“Wait, so does that mean you can’t play quidditch on Saturday?” Ron asks, which earns him a smack on the arm from Hermione, and a somber nod from Harry.
It’s hours later when he comes back to tell Harry that he’s done for the day. Harry’s hands are dry from sifting through paper, and there are small paper cuts on his fingers and palms, that he figures Hermione has a spell for. He’s about to leave the room when Snape says:
, he couldn’t do it. It would have been so easy, to just take out his wand and kill the old man, but instead, he just sat there, like a disobedient schoolboy waiting for his verdict after being caught red-handed.
“Oh, so you know the meaning of ‘unexpected’ but you can’t spell ‘rejuvenating’?” Draco says dryly, but can’t hide the smirk on his lips. Potter blushes, which is odd, and then throws a piece of crumpled paper towards him, which Draco catches with one hand.
“Mate, if you’re about to be sick, please don’t do it on the table,” Ron says, his tone teasing, but then he notices the way Harry’s mug is shaking in his hand, and he places a hand on his shoulder to calm him.
At the end of May, Lupin tells him that he still has to take his exams, and while Draco’s first instinct is to laugh at the absurdity of taking exams while his life is literally uprooted, he throws himself into studying nonetheless, grasping at the chance of finally having something concrete to do.
“The necklace, and the mead, they were both meant for Dumbledore…You’ve been trying to kill him the whole year.”
“Try and stay out of trouble, okay?” Remus says as a farewell, to which Harry answers as he always does to that request.
Draco had forgotten how much he loves to fly. Because of his mission, he had to quit the team, and he had not competed since fifth year, and even then, it was not the same without Potter, who has always been the only one who could keep up with him.
“Hey, look at me,” Potter says, and Draco has to will himself to look up, only to find Potter looking at him with an unwavering resolution.
He feels a headache coming on and has to lie down for a moment. He stares at the ceiling, trying to justify Potter’s actions, trying to explain them, but he can’t. He can’t understand why he would do this, why he would save
“There's no 'd' before the 'j', and it's with an 'e' after the 'v', not an 'i'. You wrote it ‘redjuvinating’”
McGonagall lets him speak, sitting perfectly still in her chair like her animagus form, her eyes intense and watchful.
“I hate to say it, but I told you so.” Her voice, however, lacks the usual self-assurance, and is instead low and pensive.
Then he remembers that everyone is down in the Great Hall for dinner, and almost sighs with relief. As soon as he enters the common room, he makes a b-line for the dorms. When he gets to his bed he draws the curtains and locks them in place, before taking out his potion’s book.
“Is it true? Did you and Malfoy fight last night?” Hermione asks. Harry nods, and then, he’s just about to tell them everything, right there in the hall, but thinks better of it and instead pulls them into an empty classroom and places a Muffliato charm on the door before he recollects last night’s events.
“So, could you help me with the essay?” Potter looks like a puppy begging for snacks, and Draco has to hold back a laugh.
him, Harry remembered the look on his face as he did - anger masking regret, a resentful scowl and tears streaming down his cheeks, the desperation sipping through his voice.
Before Draco can finish, however, Potter rushes towards him and grabs him by his shirt, making the book in his hands drop to the floor with a thud.
“We’re trying to eat more Indian dishes to help Harry get in touch with his heritage,” Lupin says next to him, which surprises Draco since he hadn’t even thought that Potter had problems with that.
Draco holds down a whimper as Potter’s wand burrows into his skin. He’s about to object, about to provoke the other boy more but thinks better of it. It’s not smart trying to start a fight with him in his own home, let alone when his guardians are downstairs. So he drops it, even if his hands itch to hex him.
“Yeah, right,” he huffs and looks down on the book again so that he doesn’t have to meet Potter’s intense gaze.
Neville is puking loudly into the toilet, with the door open for everyone to hear, while Dean is passed out on top of Seamus on the former's bed, both seemingly half-dressed. Harry smiles and shakes his head at the couple, before making his way towards his own bed, and plopping down on it. Ron mirrors him but is only able to sit up for a moment before he falls back on his mattress with a groan.
Yet he finds himself moved by the notion, by a simple promise made by a boy, a boy he’s supposed to hate, a boy that
He returns to his text, something about dark artefacts and immortality, but he can’t focus on it. The book is shaking in his hands, and before he knows it, he’s sobbing. He lets himself cry, because he’s alone and there’s a slim chance anyone can hear him.
He still cringes when he thinks back on his conversation with Potter, the way he lost control and actually
He makes his way back to the dorm to grab his bag, before he goes down to his first class. He’s a few minutes late, which earns him a stern look from the professor, but he simply takes his place next to Ron and keeps quiet the rest of class.
He took a deep breath and asked Ragnok what exactly Dumbledore had left him.  Ragnok handed him a paper listing 5 vaults with totals in them that made his eyes bulge.  He knew Dumbledore wasn’t poor but he didn’t realize he was that well off.  “Sir, I’m too astonished to do much with the vaults today.  I would like to come back in the next few weeks and disperse the gold then, if that suits you?” Harry asked.  “For today, would it just be possible to get a listing of properties and locations that I currently own?”
Draco spoke the words and the two agreed by touching the tips of their wands to the tip of Draco’s.  With a quick flash the Oath was sealed.  “Alright, I guess to begin with we need to start back in 5
“A gentleman never tells.”  Seamus said solemnly.  Then he smiled and began, “And since we all know I’m the furthest thing from a gentleman there is-” here he was cut off by a sharp elbow to the ribs from Dean.  “Fine, be that way.  At least no one is sitting around weeping into their whiskey anymore.  Now let’s go dance, lover.”  He stood and pulled Dean from the couch and they made their way towards the dancefloor and were soon joined by several others.
Harry kind of cut her off here and said “Professor, I really debated even coming back this year.  I am very glad I did now, but I really don’t want to spend the year rushing around worried about every single class.  I don’t even know for sure what my future holds so I decided to just enjoy myself and relax.  If in the future I decide I want to do something that requires a N.E.W.T. I’ve not taken, then I’ll study and take it then.  I don’t see that as a likely scenario, but it’s easy enough to fix.”
“That’s more than acceptable.  Now, as much as I appreciate all of your ideas, I’ve gotten way off track as to why I asked you up.  As I said earlier, I have received your schedule and noticed you aren’t taking many classes.”
“No, not really.  My initial goal was to change how it works to remove the compulsion, but it proved impossible to do so.  Instead I worked out a completely new potion that, like
He paused hoping what he was saying was sinking in to at least a few people.  “In just this group standing with me, we have lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, godparents, and friends to death or madness.  That’s on both sides of a war none of us asked for.  We weren’t even born when it started, yet we were all forced to choose a side and fight for our lives.  Some of us had no choice to run and hide away until it was over like most of the wizarding world chose to do.  I think I can speak for us all here when I say I refuse to fight any longer.  No more battles.  No more hate.  Move forward and live the life you are beyond blessed to have because there are so many worthy people that no longer have the opportunity to do so.”  Neville then cancelled the
Harry had missed the beginning of Draco’s reaction as he was too mortified to look up at anyone.  He focused all his concentration on walking down the stairs and tried to pretend he didn’t notice how the conversations had stopped with his entry.  He did see the look of disdain on his face as he spoke to Pansy and for a second felt hurt.  There was no doubt that Draco had been a first-class cunt through the first 6 years of their schooling, but he seemed to have grown up.  Had Harry been wrong?  He’d always found Draco attractive even if he’d never said so out loud to anyone.  Ron would have had an apocalyptic meltdown at the mere mention.  With Hermione there was no need, as she would just smile and say she’d already figured out Harry’s attraction ages ago.  Attractive or not, his caustic personality and shitty choices had wiped away any chance to explore said attraction.  He sighed quietly and faced the crowd.    “Well, what are we waiting for?  Let’s go!”
He made his way to the desk in his room and began writing down what classes he wished to take this year.  He could finally focus on what he wanted out of life and not what was expected from him by his father.  Draco had spent countless hours brewing with Severus over the years and adored potions.  The two of them had been very close and Severus was impressed with Draco’s knowledge and thirst for more in his field. He’d already improved a handful, had ideas for a few others, and was close to perfecting a brand-new potion he had come up with on a late night sitting up with the man.  There was no doubt that if he had lived Draco would apprentice under him for his Mastery.  Now though?  Who would take him on?  Was it even worth it?
“Poppy never questioned or pressed, then or now.  Even when Caelum got sick before and she wasn’t sure if it was a hereditary issue or not, she just said she had ‘checked all relevant medical information available and it did not appear to be an issue from either parent’.  It’s kind of became one of those things that those close to me know, but no one really talks about or asks any questions.”
He wasn’t sure what to tell Caelum about Draco being back in town.  He wasn’t sure what kind of relationship Draco might want with his son or even if he would.  Draco’s owl was short and to the point.  A time and a place and nothing more.  He didn’t want to blindside Caelum if Draco did want a place in his life.  Yet, he didn’t want to hurt him if Draco didn’t.  In the end he decided to err on the side of caution and wait.  “Caelum, I’ve got a meeting with someone today that might make me late to pick you up from school.  So, Aunt Mione or Uncle Ron might pick you up instead, okay?”
“Makes sense, would you like to meet in one of our rooms tomorrow or would you prefer to do it somewhere else?”
The rest as they say, was history.  The crowds doubled with Draco as the lead singer the first six months and by a year they were sold out constantly.  It wasn’t long until they had a record deal and a few gold and platinum albums.  No one looked at him any more as if he was scum when they heard his name.  It was what he had always wanted….wasn’t it?
In the middle of all of this, a very silly and insignificant worry pops up in his head, and he feels dumb as soon as he says it.
When he rises again, shoe in one hand and wand in the other, he meets Harry’s gaze, and they both erupt in giggles that soon turn to laughter, and in that moment, Harry thinks to himself that maybe everything is going to be alright after all.
At that, Sirius and Remus exchange a look, and for a moment, it looks like they’re having a whole conversation, before Sirius sighs in surrender and nods. Remus turns to Harry and says
He closes his eyes and lays there, letting his thoughts wander. It was still hard to believe that he had offered Malfoy help, but he knew it was the right thing to do. Even with that mark on his arm, Harry did not see a Death Eater when he looked at the boy. A bully? Yes. His rival? Definitely. But a Death Eater? No.
He sits, and notes that she only calls him by his first name when it’s something serious. His mouth feels dry, and he has to hide his hands in his lap, since he can’t stop wringing them in anxiety.
And that’s how the days turn into weeks, as he withers away in the Black family home, avoiding his estranged cousin and the timid professor, hiding away in the library as he makes his way through the old tombs residing in it.
Breakfast goes by without any major events, but while Harry tries to follow along in the conversation, his gaze keeps slipping back to the Slytherin table now and again, and each time, he feels more and more nervous. Malfoy never shows up.
Slowly, Harry nods, willing himself to keep his professor’s gaze. Something shifts in Snape’s eyes, and he flicks his wand to conjure a stretcher for Malfoy and then rises from the floor. With another flick, the bathroom pieces itself together, and the water disappears from underneath Harry, leaving him kneeling on the cold tiles, wet and covered with blood.
He thinks about Malfoy, and Dumbledore, and wonders if the headmaster knows of the attempts to assassinate him. He thinks about his friends, the seemingly permanent looks of worry on their faces when he’s with them.
When he’s healed and breathing, Snape turns to Harry with an intense stare, and Harry feels him crawling around his mind, searching for...his potion’s book, the one that belonged to the Half-Blood Prince.
And that has to be good enough because that's all either of them can give right now, a promise to protect and to trust, because if they can’t do that when caught in a war against a madman, what else is there left for them to do?
Homework forgotten, the two boys make their way to the attic on the fourth floor, where Potter had set up a make-shift indoor quidditch field.
“Do you think-do you think he’s-” Harry can hardly form the words, he feels like a Snitch is stuck in his throat, he’s too anxious to speak out what he’s thinking.
He feels sick, like he’s about to throw up, but nothing comes up when he tries. Then he sees his shirt, and the red stains on his stomach, and he is just about to rip it off to destroy any evidence of what had just happened. He doesn’t, instead, he vanishes the blood as well as he can and dries his pants with a heating charm, before he leaves the bathroom and heads towards the Gryffindor common room.
“I wouldn’t say killing the most powerful wizard in Britain is a ‘simple task’ for anyone, let alone a teenage boy with a chip on his shoulder.”
A month ago, he would be revolted at the thought, but as he looks across the table at the black-haired boy with his glasses askew, in the midst of an animated retelling of their game, he feels oddly at ease.
Afterwards, they go back to the common room to sober up, and Harry enters the dorm just in time to hear his name being called from the drawer on his nightstand. Quickly, he takes out the mirror, and Remus’s face comes into view.
in front of him, the way he whimpered like a first-year, as if his mother hadn’t taught him better than that.
“Are you sure that’s a good idea, Harry?” she says then, putting down her book and meeting his gaze.
The news is met with expected outrage and debate, but Harry is too tired to argue about it, and just pulls aside the alternate Seeker, a fourth-year named Tallulah Jacobs, to quickly discuss strategy with her, before he retreats to his dorm again, followed by the worried gazes of Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville, who are all sitting around the fireplace when he leaves.
Then, the moment is over, and Malfoy shakes his head, but Harry can’t shake the feeling that he was either about to apologize or thank him, and both possibilities make his stomach turn, not in a bad way, exactly, more so in excitement.
He’s out of bed in a flash and digging through his suitcase before he finds the potions textbook. He knows what to do with it.
But then he sees the sincerity in his eyes, and against his better judgement, he finds himself believing it.
He looks down and turns on the faucet. The water runs red as he tries to wash Malfoy’s blood off his hands, scrubbing them manically until they’re burning, until they’re clean.
So, that night, after he’s made sure that everyone is asleep, he sneaks down to the kitchen and steals a scone from the pantry, before he makes his way to his windowsill and sits watching the lights of the city, and thinks, that in the dark, it almost looks beautiful.
Harry realizes that he should have brought something, as some kind of peace offering, and searches his bag for a last moment proxy, until he finds a chocolate frog, which he holds in his hand as he opens the blinds slowly.
Draco wants to laugh then because it’s not comforting at all when it’s coming from Potter, who has a habit of getting him and his friends into near-death situations on an unnatural basis.
As he walks, he tries to think of an excuse, something that can explain where he’s been without telling the truth, but his mind is blank, except for the image of Malfoy bleeding out on the tiles.
He meets Snape in his office, and the Potions Master leads him towards another room full of documents, which he is then set to sort through. It’s bitter work, but Harry begins without a complaint, which takes Snape by surprise, because he doesn’t even bother throwing a last insult at him before he quietly saunters out the door.
He didn’t even know Slytherins went to parties hosted by the other houses, but it made sense, since all the students migrated between the common rooms for this or that. In a way, it was kind of a nice thought, that a party, of all things, was able to erase house prejudices.
He’s just about to vomit every time he remembers it, it’s that revolting. He didn't need his pity, he was doing just fine without it, but no, Harry-The-Boy-With-A-Hero-Complex-Potter just had to swoop in and save him from his miserable fate, didn’t he? Well, he can go and drown in the Black Lake for all he cares, because as far as he is concerned, Harry Potter had ruined his life.
When he’s done, he dries his face with the back of his hand and sighs, before returning to the book as if nothing has happened.
He passes with flying colours, of course, he expected nothing less, and is only a bit flustered when Lupin congratulates him on his marks. Afterwards, he is exhausted, but satisfied nonetheless.
“Detention, every Saturday morning for the rest of the semester, and you’re lucky that it’s not a direct ticket to London.”
“Get on with it then. I’m sure you’ll only get a rap over the fingers from Dumbledore, after all, nobody will miss the evil Slytherin.”
, Potter. You only saved me because you felt guilty for almost killing me because you have a hero complex bigger than the Black Lake because you took
He thinks about his friends and how they’re handling the Slytherin civil war, he wonders if they miss him, even though they keep reassuring him of that in every letter. He thinks about his mother, alone in a house with the Dark Lord and his pet snake, with only his delusional aunt as company, and wonders if she resents him, if she’s angry at him.
He decides to shower before heading down to breakfast, and afterwards, feeling somewhat refreshed, he puts on a fresh set of clothes, before making his way down to the Great Hall. He eats in silence, occupying an empty bench at the Gryffindor table, and when he’s done, he flees to the library until his detention, too exasperated to deal with the disappointing glances of his teammates that he’s sure to be met with as soon as they come down for breakfast.
Potter huffs, and it’s infuriating, and Draco has to once again hold himself back from not hexing him.
Harry leans in to see the card is that of Albus Dumbledore, and the gears in his head begin to turn, slowly at first, then fast, and soon the puzzle pieces fall into place.
At that, Harry panics again. What else did he say? Did he spill his secrets to the whole common room?!
“But you are not Atlas, Harry, you do not need to carry all the troubles of the world on your back. You’re surrounded by people who care for you,
Up until this point, Draco had been eating his meals alone, however, now that Potter’s here, and he has made a promise to trust him, he decides to begin eating his meals with the others, as a way to uphold his end of the deal.
Potter’s wand is at Draco’s throat, and his green eyes are burning with a fury Draco has rarely seen.
Harry has to process his words for a moment. He’s just about to argue, seeing as the match against Ravenclaw is on Saturday, but thinks better of it. There was no arguing with Snape.
Draco huffs. “Well I’m glad there’s at least one sensible person in your little group, or else you’d all be failing your classes.”
A couple of days after that, Potter comes back from Hogwarts. Draco makes himself scarce as the boy talks with his guardians in the kitchen.He can’t face him, because he’s still ashamed, but more than that, he’s furious at him for putting all of this in motion, for attempting to save his life.
He reads through it and sighs. “How is it that a sixth-year does not know how to spell ‘rejuvenating’?”
from Potter, who’s done more than enough up to this point to make his life miserable. He bites back all the nasty things he wants to say, and settles on a simple:
“Ten o’clock, Saturday. Now clean yourself up and go back to your dorm. And next time, try and think before you use an unknown spell. You’re lucky he’s alive.” Snape sneers, and with a flick of his wand, the stretcher hoovers above ground and follows him out as he leaves.
Honestly, why were they going through all that to hide their relationship from him? It was obvious to anyone with more than two brain cells that they were in love, so why go through all that trouble?
Potter just looks confused, and Draco feels like he’s talking to a toddler, not a sixteen-year-old that has supposedly faced the dark arts more than once. If this is their Savior, they’re most certainly doomed.
As always, Draco doubts his motives for being nice to him, because it still doesn’t make sense to him. Maybe it never will, he thinks, and maybe instead of agonizing over it, he could just accept that for the time being, Potter is nice to him, no matter what the reason might be, and enjoy it.
Harry’s eyes swept the pub before landing on Draco who was sitting in a booth with his elbows on the table and his head cradled in his hands.  He looked as apprehensive as Harry felt.  He made his way over to the booth and found he had no idea what to say so he cleared his throat and took a seat on the bench across from Draco.
Harry laughed out loud at the simplicity of Pansy’s confession.  “Well, never would have pegged you as a closet Lion but sticking to the theme I’ll tell you something no one living knows.  The sorting hat wanted me in Slytherin.”  Harry smirked when Pansy choked on her drink.  “Yup, I almost joined you all in the snake pit.  I’m sure Snape would have sliced and diced me up for ingredients before the end of first year.”
“Romantic is not a word I’d ever describe those night as.  Harry, you know we understand that you needed space and time to accept and appreciate having a life to live now.  It’ll take more than a few quiet weeks to tear us apart.” Hermione said to put his mind at ease as she hugged him back fiercely hoping she could express how very much she had missed him while he sorted out his head.
“Potter, I can’t be remorseful if I have no remorse to feel.  You look stunning and you know it so shut up and buy me a drink, dear.”
One by one they stepped to the door and paused as McGonagall cast the spell towards them.  Hermione was impressed by the creative entrance.  She had never thought passwords were very secure and it would be nice to be able to relax knowing no one could sneak in to cause trouble.  After she had been added to the wards protecting their new area she walked into the common room and looked around.  It was in the shape of a large rectangle with a loft area above that looked to house their rooms.  The seating area boasted two large windows with cushy looking window seats that over looked the courtyard below.  There was a sunken area between the entryway and the windows that had a large U-shaped dark grey sectional couch with pillows of various shades of purple and green.  The couch faced a large fireplace that was already lit.  There was a coffee table in the middle of the couch and a few bean bags dotted around in the sunken area as well.  At the other end of the ground floor she saw a kitchen area, a large rectangular table on one side of the room, and 5 smaller round tables closer to the large window on that side of the room that looked perfect for studying.  As she walked over for a closer look she spotted a small bathroom.  She noted 3 staircases leading upstairs, one near the kitchen area and the other two on each side of the living room area.  It was lovely and she couldn’t wait to see what the upstairs offered.
“No, but I do have a few suggestions.  He said to search the ashes, correct?  Well, he could mean a few things by that.  However, with what you were given and the wording I think our best bet is to search Phoenix Perch and hope it’s not a scavenger hunt from there.” Hermione replied.
“This is amazing.  I was sure Smoke was a hero when he saved me and didn’t understand why Dumbledore asked me to keep his role secret.  I see now how delicate and unknown the name had to be.  If even a whisper got out about someone helping our side it could have proven deadly.” Sirius acknowledged.
“Me too, I guess.  Sounds fair and precise enough not to allow a mistake.” Theo then extended his wand as well.
While most of the purebloods had indeed purchased muggle clothing before, it was generally the high-end variety.  That didn’t seem to be Harry’s aim so several of the group members were curious.  They all sat around discussing what they needed to accomplish before classes started up on Monday and in the end, it was a group of Harry, Hermione, Pansy, Draco, Theo, and Blaise that decided to go together.  The others agreed to meet them later that night at The Dragon’s Lair.
Just a few minutes later found the odd mishmash of students making their way down Diagon Alley towards The Dragon’s Lair.  It was late enough that most of the families no longer crowded the streets, but there were enough people out to turn some heads at the group.  Neville heard the not so quiet whispers and saw the hateful glances directed towards the Slytherins and began to become incensed.  He had been seen as the useless outcast by almost everyone he had met his entire life until he beheaded the snake.  Never good enough.  Not worth the magic that ran through his body.  Just an idiot with a useless stick in his hands. Even his own family didn’t believe in him.  It wasn’t until his friends, though few, stood up for him and gave him faith in himself that he began to shine.  He refused to stand by and allow hate and bigotry to fester after everything they had all be through.
