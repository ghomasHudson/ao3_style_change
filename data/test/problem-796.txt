And why should that hurt – Draco had been trying to prove himself Potter’s enemy for six years now.  Hell hath no fury like a Malfoy scorned.  “All’s fair in war and Quidditch, is that it?” he said stiffly.
They looked at each other in expectant silence, and then both started talking at once, and then both stopped, laughing. Ron asked a couple of questions about China and then began talking about Lavender, and the coming baby, and the joke shop, so Harry was spared the need to find words for his largely wordless experiences of the past five years.
you sixth year in that loo, I didn’t mean to but suddenly your blood was all over and I was horrified – and afterwards I just blocked it from my memory. I got involved with Ginny and forgot about that fight – or maybe I got involved with Ginny to help me forget – and I never apologized to you.”
“Malfoy?”  Potter’s hand was on Draco’s shoulder.   He looked concerned.  His hand was warm.  Draco’s breathing slowed again.
He gazed out one of the windows as the sun set and the sky darkened. Below he could see Hagrid and Fang coming out of the Forbidden Forest and entering Hagrid’s hut.  A moment later a light glowed through Hagrid’s window.
There was a little rustling in the bushes on the other side of the clearing and a child’s face appeared, a young brown-skinned girl with straight black hair, looking at him silently.  “Hello,” Draco said.  “What are you doing here?  Are you lost?  Do you need help?”
“Astronomy.  Muggles have enormous telescopes, some of them out in space, and they send photos of more galaxies than we ever dreamed of.  There’s a group of us who volunteer to catalogue them through Galaxy Zoo, helping to map the depths of the skies.  Some of us found these small round green galaxies – we call them green pea galaxies – that turn out to be rare and incredibly active at forming stars.” Draco smiled. “We call ourselves the Peas Corps.  Give peas a chance!”
A Niffler with a broken nose had to be kept in a pen outside of the Manor as it would otherwise snuffle out anything shiny and try to carry it away. The Niffler got into a tussle with the Fire Crab, trying to abduct it for its jeweled shell, and Draco and Merfley had to pull them apart.
“Does anything go well with gingernuts?” Harry asked, having given in to temptation. The biscuits were excellent, and he reached for another.  The owl glared at him suspiciously and edged closer to the plate.
He tied the note to the owl’s leg, stood pointedly at the window, and said, “Go.”  With a disdainful and equally pointed glare the owl flew off. He supposed he had just been rude to an owl.  Well, it was a Malfoy owl, it deserved it.
“He’s still going strong.  He could live to be 40,” Longbottom said, smiling at his pet.  When he looked up, his face was more curious than hostile.  “What are you doing at Hogwarts, Malfoy?”
?”  Harry said.  It was bad enough taking orders from his aunt and uncle.  He didn’t see why he should take them from a bear.
“It means your true friend, the one who understands you deeply. There’s an old Chinese story about a statesman Boya and a wood-cutter Zhong Ziqi. Boya was playing a zither by himself on a boat at night. He was thinking about the mountains as he played. The woodcutter heard the music from the shore, and exclaimed ‘Ah, this music is as majestic as a mountain.’ Then Boya thought about rivers as he played, and Zhong Ziqi said ‘This music is as vast as a great river!’ Boya felt that Zhong Ziqi was the only listener who truly heard and recognised him.”
He brewed an infusion of centaury and drank the bitter tonic.  Then he returned to the Ministry and went in search of Hermione Granger.
The towering Buddha sat as if on a straight chair, his hands resting on his knees, his feet planted on the ground, gazing impassively out over the river.  The top of his head was level with the top of the cliff, and his feet rested 71 meters below, not far above the water.  He was carved in high relief right out of the red-brown land itself, his face worn by the weather of more than a thousand years.
“Ah, an old friend from school!  Talking over your happy memories?  What was our Mr Potter like back then?”
“There’s something in your hair,” Draco murmured.  His fingers moved lightly across Harry’s head, then briefly grazed his cheek.
“Oh,” said Thomas.  “I’ve always wondered what the axes and branches were for.  A sacred tree or grove, maybe? If you find out, let me know, would you?”
“You will each have your own bedroom, I believe, with a bathroom attached,” Dumbledore said unperturbed.  “The room will not permit any harm to come to you.  It is capable of dampening harmful spells.  It may decide to impose curfews, however, or limit visitors.  It does what it thinks best, and its judgement is good.  Meanwhile, Draco, you are to first visit St Mungo’s for evaluation.  Your mother will be here to get you.”
Standing, Harry watched Malfoy swing a leg gracefully over his broomstick and push off. He joined Teddy in the doorway, and together they watched Malfoy disappear into the clouds.
“I don’t understand you.  You’re their Boy Wonder, war hero, you could be cock of the walk, and here you are –”
Malfoy’s voice, at the end, sounded subdued, bleak even.  What had the war looked like from his side, to have changed him so much from the maliciously cocky child of privilege that he had once been?  Through Harry’s memory flashed a quick succession of moments – Draco sobbing in a bathroom at the murderous task that was beyond him, trembling as he confronted Dumbledore, helpless as Voldemort turned his home into a torture chamber, choking with grief at the death of his friend Vince.  Trapped by family allegiance and bad choices, desperate, terrified.  His courage, it seemed, had come afterwards – to look clearly at the past, to try moving in a new direction.
There was silence as Malfoy seemed to be biting back a retort.  His voice sounded strained when he finally replied.  “Not new.  Older, and trying to be wiser.  You, on the other hand, are now restored to your classic look.  I don’t think they’ve made that style of frames for the last ten years.”
“Yes, because you stopped dead in the middle of the street, Potter. So I’m here, because I can’t go forward, because you’re there. Blocking my way.”
“Blibbering,” Potter said absently. “If not, it won’t be for lack of trying. If anyone can find a probably-non-existent beast, it would be Luna.”
Potter shook his head.  “They keep to themselves, usually.  Of course, if you insult them loudly enough they may turn up to retaliate.  Take umbrage, as it were.”
He bowed again, more deeply. She gave a slight nod in return, and Draco felt, unexpectedly, honored.
Some hurts Lily did not know how to heal, and so her son suffered for them.  “He’s an innocent child,” she wanted to tell Petunia, tell Severus.  “Don’t blame him.”  But they couldn’t hear her, muffled by the Veil.
“It was a very insipid garden party.  I was bending over to tie my shoe and avoid eye contact with a tiresome person, when there was a rustle in the ferns and she attacked my foot.”
He let Andromeda know that he’d be there soon, sent Potter an owl to explain, and changed to more child-proof robes.
“H.E.L.L.?  That must be one of Granger’s projects.  No offense to your friend, Harry, but she has an unhappy genius for acronyms.”
As he was leaving, Draco nearly collided with one of the Patil twins. The Ravenclaw, he thought, as he stooped to pick up a book that had slid off the stack in her arms.  It had fallen open to a painting of a winged cow with a woman’s head and what seemed to be a peacock’s tail.  He couldn’t read a thing on the page, though – he didn’t even recognize the script.
At which the contrary hero-he-was-tired-of-being-grateful-to opened the door again.  “Then what are you doing here?” Potter demanded.
“It doesn’t really matter,” Draco answered with a humourless half-smile.  He turned to look at Harry, then squeezed his hand.  Before Harry could ask what he meant, Narcissa Malfoy stood in the doorway.
“Yes, although the Malfoys have been in England a long time.  But my great grandmother was French, Aurore Chevalier; her son was my grandfather, Abraxas.”
They were interrupted as Harry came pushing back toward the chariot, face flushed.  He stopped cold at the sight of Draco’s father.  His father drew himself up and raised his chin.
“No!  But, er, you can have them if you want – I don’t really know how I ended up with them.”  He’d just stopped for a moment on his way past the flower shop, and the next thing he knew…
A voice called fiercely, and the little centaur turned and ran toward it.  Draco stayed still – it would do him no good to seem to harass children.  A female centaur, grey haired, appeared at the edge of the clearing, glared at him, wheeled and galloped off.
“Harry Potter?  The one we had classes with for years?  The one whose picture is always in the magazines?  Green eyes, you say?”
True, they’d avoided any discussion about their families, or reminiscences about school, or the war.  But it was a beginning.  And Ron hadn’t flat out refused to do it again.  Harry wondered at his good fortune.
But Draco just kept his eyes on the lake and said, “Sorry – I didn’t think to check the net.”  If it hadn’t been so unlikely, Harry would have thought he was blushing.  But it must have been sunburn.
Qing Cheng Shan was, as promised by its name, very green, frothy with leafy trees, and misty.  Harry and Draco gazed at a large and splendid temple with statues of many different gods and immortals.  Red hangings festooned the place and clouds of smoke rose from incense sticks.  As they climbed on they saw many smaller temples, some by the path and some secluded in the trees.
Ron invited him to Sunday dinner the next day at the Burrow, but Harry was hoping to see Andromeda and Teddy then. He promised to call at the Burrow soon.
It was a relief to have a plan and know where to turn for help. Harry renewed the Stunning Spell on the Mooncalf, adding one for protection and one to keep it hidden while he went to get help. Then he Apparated to the coordinates Luna had given him.
“I must have picked it up from this mind-healer I had once.  Still in training, but he was the best.”
“You have time to figure it out,” Andromeda said. “It must be quite a culture shock to be back here after living in such a different place. And yes, we missed you, but you must have had your reasons for leaving. You’d had such a weight of expectations on you for so long.”
Draco whispered, and was stunned when the spell worked.  Dumbledore’s wand sailed into his hand.  He stared at it.
Harry was at Grimmauld Place, but off talking with Ron and Hermione much of the time.  For some reason he wanted to know who RAB was, and Draco did help him figure that out.  That wasn’t difficult – Draco wasn’t likely to forget Regulus Black, who displeased the Dark Lord and disappeared.  But most of the time Harry wasn’t confiding in him.  Draco tried not to let on that it bothered him, but finally he couldn’t help asking.
Harry didn’t want stylish frames, he just wanted his trusty old glasses, so things could go back to normal - not that normal was all that great these days. So after he checked in at work and was told to take the rest of the day off, he Apparated back to the scene of the fight to have a look.  He found nothing, and the disgruntled fruit seller claimed not to have seen any spare spectacles lying about.
Draco forced himself to keep his eyes and voice level. “No.”  Seeing Snape’s raised eyebrow, he added, “No, thank you, Headmaster.”
“I shall apologize to her in English when next I see her.  And not just for that.”  Malfoy flung himself down onto a large rock and folded in on himself, knees pulled up to his chest, arms wrapped tightly around them, chin on knees.  He frowned into space, looking more grim and – wretched? - than Harry had intended.
“Now there’s a scoop.  I must alert Rita Skeeter,” Draco said dryly.  “I knew you had a sweet tooth, Potter, but that’s ridiculous.”
“Car.  Blue.”  It had come charging up and when a door sprang open he scrambled inside, devoutly grateful.  It rumbled through the forest and spat him out nearly at the edge.
“I want to,” Rutherford said, “but it’s a very long way.  I’m afraid my wizard there is wondering what happened to me.”
He called Gabriel to him and the bird sailed down to land near his feet.  The cat ran through the grass and bounded straight over Gabriel’s head.
Lily and James were awkward new parents once too.  How often she’d wanted to turn to her own mother, Violet, for help, only to have grief crush her chest as she remembered her mother was gone.  The sudden loss of her parents, of James’ parents, the rift with Petunia, the war – it had been overwhelming.
“Take them off,” Harry whispered back, waiting for the touch of warm dry fingers cupping his face.  Draco slid the glasses off and flung one hand over his head to drop them on the end table. Harry turned his face against Draco’s other hand to kiss and tongue the palm and inner wrist.
They sulked separately for a while, but that was boring, so they explored the woods around the castle together.  Harry returned to the castle for meals.  He never saw bear Draco inside the castle, and he never saw human Draco at all, because Draco only came to Harry’s bed in the dark.
Harry shrugged and stood.  Malfoy took his arm and Apparated them to a tiny island, where they startled a puffin.  Harry laughed.
The green tree python was willing to go to any part of the tropical rainforest on the island of New Guinea, and the Portkey Office was willing to make one for any town they could provide the name of.  Draco scanned maps of New Guinea.  “Let’s go to Popondetta,” he said.  “I like the name.”
Taking up music for the first time as an adult was not easy, but Draco had encouraged him.  There were a lot of things about the war and his past that Harry was reluctant to talk about, but in the mournful bluesy tones of the sax he let those feelings out.  And the instrument seemed also to embody the warm sensuality that Harry kept private from the world but that his lover knew so well.
Draco showed them the shirt with the three spots of candle wax that Harry had let fall, that sad night in their own bed so long ago and far away.  “Let her just wash three spots out of it.  For I’m sure the one who can wash my night-shirt is the one I ought to have, and I’ll marry none other.”
A broom, that was it. He needed a broom. He hadn’t flown on one in years; it wasn’t done in China, and he had given his own away there in an excess of non-attachment. He would shop for one soon.
What happened at breakfast the next day was witnessed by a number of owls when they flew in to deliver the morning post.
It should have been harder to sleep with Potter there, but somehow it wasn’t.  The bed was warm.  After a few disgruntled murmurs, Potter was quiet, and eventually Draco heard his breathing become slow and even in sleep.  Draco stretched, settled, and drifted into sleep himself, not waking until sun streamed through the windows.
“Am I interrupting something?” Harry heard himself ask, his voice low and husky.  His mind had gone on a detour, wondering how much snogging it would take to bring color into Malfoy’s pale face.
Old Timer needed some teeth pulled, so Draco fixed him soft food to eat afterwards. Old Timer clambered up on the foot of Draco’s bed at night, and Draco let him.
“Nice to meet you, Fern,” Harry said.  Gabriel began to make owly distress sounds from his cage.  Another yowl from Fern was the last thing Harry heard before he Disapparated.
Draco’s face changed as he studied Harry. Slowly, wonderingly, Draco asked, “What do you know about Russian dragons?”
And he swept his cloak around Potter’s shoulders. On its midnight blue background, the constellation he was named for gleamed silver.
Draco was distracted and found it hard to concentrate for the next week.  He did a lot of flying.  Finally he decided he had to get back to writing.  As usual, he went to warm up with a poem for Potter.
As the door opened, Draco tipped his head back, determined to look Hagrid in the eye even if that eye was two feet above Draco’s head.  When he found no one up there, he brought his gaze down − to see tousled black hair half-hiding a lightning scar, and green eyes hardening behind round glasses. Harry Potter slammed the door in Draco’s face.
“Maybe you’ve been stung by a Billywig, Draco,” said Luna. “I wonder if some have come over from Australia?”
Despite what young Ronald Weasley thought, my life’s not boring.  Just staying here in the Headmaster’s office I witness interesting things.  At feasts, I’ve listened to the thoughts of thousands of 11 year-olds – repetitive, but helps me gauge the temper of the times.  And I never know when I’ll be called upon to deliver the sword of Gryffindor – swooping off in the beak of a phoenix to the Chamber of Secrets, or summoned and crammed on the head of brave young Neville Longbottom and set on fire.  Both times so the sword could lop the head off some serpent that Tom Riddle was using to make trouble.  I remember sorting him – a most unpleasant mind, I got out as soon as I could.  He said rude things about me too.
So Harry was a bit choked up when it came time to sing the national anthem, but Draco had picked up the words and tune from overhearing them at the school assemblies, the combined voices of several hundred students having carried easily across the road to Harry’s little house.  Now Draco’s clear tenor blended into the seemingly effortless beauty that is Malawian choral singing:
Back home at Grimmauld Place, he barely had time to make a cup of tea when a barn owl was tapping on the window with a note.  The handwriting was elegant, the message infuriating.
Malfoy set the book down, his eyes fixed on Harry, his face expressionless.  He moved his head an infinitesimal fraction that Harry took to mean yes.
Whatever Draco might have tried to say would not come out. Suddenly tired, he decided to go home.  He nodded slightly, turned, and left.
That was gratifying, because Draco had chosen the book himself – it was one of his birthday gifts to Teddy a month ago.
Narcissa seemed to notice him for the first time.  “Auror Potter.”  She nodded to him, her face grave.
When he came out a few hours later, Potter waved to him from the garden.  “Hey Malfoy, Neville left something for you.”
Draco had wanted to keep their relationship secret until he’d finished school and become independent of his family. But with a gossip like Lavender Brown, the news would spread like wildfire. They both knew it.
Over lunch Draco learned that Merfley had volunteered for this position because he liked animals. He had been unhappy in his previous household, where he had been mocked for, among other things, his devotion to dance. In the end he had defiantly danced through all his duties and been dismissed, only agreeing to leave when he was presented with ballet shoes. Now he required Tuesdays off for ballet lessons, which Draco readily consented to.
His mother’s sisters were his only living relatives with counterparts in the sky.  Bellatrix was in Orion, the Hunter – too close to Sirius for his own good.  She must have taken particular pleasure in killing her own cousin for the Dark Lord.  It was a chance to prove her fanatic loyalty.
Harry followed her, at a loss for words.  Narcissa stopped in front of a small portrait in an oval gilt frame and smiled.  “This is my favourite.”
Luna’s father came. Professor McGonagall arrived with Kingsley Shacklebolt, to Draco’s surprise, and to his even greater surprise, Hagrid came, bringing his homemade rock cakes, “in case you needed some refreshments.”
Potter just smiled lazily at him, sunk back in the sofa cushions, his legs sprawled out so one nudged against Draco’s. A little spot of warmth from Potter’s leg. A little current of warmth from Potter’s eyes.  A little warmth rising in Draco’s cheeks.
“My new and improved eyesight showed me my broom looking all neglected, so I thought I’d go flying.”
“You’re flying differently,” Harry said as he dismounted.  “You seem looser, more relaxed than you used to.  I think it helps your reaction time.”
Harry remembered Fenrir Greyback at Malfoy Manor, and how tense and frightened Draco had been in his own home. How much they had all been through.
Harry slid his hands back to cup Draco’s arse, then pulled him down, rolled over on top of him, and began to kiss his neck. “Can I suck you off, too?”
“You don’t need to pay – ” he began, but she had gone.  Draco shrugged.  He could use it towards owl treats, or ink.
Draco wrapped himself up in the sheet stained with lust lotion and looked out the window at the crescent moon until he fell asleep.
When they finally came out of the kiss they were both a bit flushed and rumpled.  And sitting on a Muggle park bench in public, Draco remembered, reddening further.  “Come on, let’s go back,” Harry said, taking his hand with a shy smile.
All at once, as though her happiness in the photo were contagious, he felt a lightening in his own heart.  He didn’t have to worry about her anymore – she had found something, or someone, new.  Maybe, someday, he would too.
“I know that your mother saved my life once.  And I know that you are not your father.  And I’ve always known who your father was.”
The real apology was long overdue.  Harry took a breath and met Malfoy’s eyes.  “I’m sorry I used that curse on you.  I didn’t know what it did.  I would never have done that on purpose.”
Rising, rising, tumbling together, frantic, tender, sap flowing, cocks crowing, a fierce explosive sweetness.
A pair of wine glasses came sailing through the doorway, giving Harry barely enough time to catch one in each hand.
Harry shook his head. “I could never have got through the war without you. Or Ron. Who knows if we would even have passed our classes without you, Hermione!”
“Yeah.  We’ve become friends.  Close friends.”  More than that, but he’d leave those explanations til later.  “And I’d like my friends to know each other better.”
, Potter.  I was going to bend the earpiece a little – but never mind.  You really don’t trust me, do you?”
“Maybe feeling that you know what you’re doing is over-rated,” Draco commented, to Harry’s surprise.  “My father always seemed utterly confident,” he added somewhat bitterly, then looked thoughtful. “I imagine you’d be a good teacher of the right subject – that club of yours seemed quite effective.  Too bad you can’t teach Defence against the Dark Arts or coach Quidditch or something.”
“That’s good,” Potter said, husky-voiced, licking a finger and stroking Draco’s cheek.  A smudge of chocolate came off on his finger.  Potter dragged his finger slowly over Draco’s lips.
Lily.  Lily of the valley.  Harry had a vision, suddenly, of his mother as a young woman in Godric’s Hollow, smiling in a garden.  “Maybe I should.”  The flowers were graceful and refreshing, somehow, with their light scent.  Grimmauld Place was dark enough, there ought to be plenty of shade there.
The Manor’s own house-elves had been freed by Ministry insistence, and fled. As for the ancestral portraits, Draco no longer cared what they thought.
“My owl hasn’t been very happy,” Harry said.  “Someone suggested to me that my owl and your cat might be friends.”
And then he turned abruptly and squeezed his way into a single empty spot in the stands, leaving Harry to find his own place to sit, some distance away.
There was a small garden, and beyond that a meadow bordered by trees.  The cat had disappeared into the meadow.  Harry set the cage down, took off the covering, and opened the door.  Gabriel blinked, then hopped out and paused to look around before launching himself into the air.  He flew low and silent over the meadow.
Harry agreed and dropped down to the ground to wait.  Malfoy came flying towards him and Harry burst up into the air, but Malfoy sped up at the last second.  Harry chased him and caught up easily.
“You went back into the Forbidden Forest day after day.  That’s not luck, that’s doggedness.  Most people avoid that place.”
“I was,” Malfoy replied after a moment.  “Though I don’t know that it would have worked.  I turned out not to be so good at
They had seldom spoken in the years since the war ended, but Draco felt a need to at least be civil.
“Refusing the marriage? How dare he!” Lucius flung the letter down. “Overthrowing my months of careful negotiations. Has he no sense of what he owes his family?”
“Flutes or harps work too.  You don’t actually have to know how to play, I think he’s tone-deaf.”  Potter stopped and ran a hand through his hair.  “I’m sorry, Malfoy. I should have warned you better.  I really didn’t expect you to run into him.”
“Hello Draco.  I’m Harry Potter.  Isn’t Draco a strange name for a bear, though?  Shouldn’t you be Bernard or something?”
“That’s what you always say.  You can’t be a hermit forever, mate.  You’ve got Hermione worried.  At least leave the grounds once in a while.”
“She is seeking assistance and allies.  Magical habitat is being lost in her homeland, due to deforestation.  Without woods, magical beings are weakened and homeless.  And as magical beings become weaker, people are less hesitant to cut down trees.”
Weasley was happy that Harry agreed to go out, Draco was happy to be alive, and Harry was happy that his old friend and new lover were on speaking terms, so a good, if occasionally awkward, time was had by all.
“No one’s complained, eh?  But you did say penises, plural – ah, attached to bodies, plural.  So you’re fond of gay orgies, perhaps?”
“No.” Of course not. “But I stay right here,” Potter continued.  “And I was sort of, er, involved in the accident, so I’d like to help.”
When he gave the address of their flat, though, he found that the Floo was closed. Of course it was possible they had moved… He consulted a public Floo directory and found Hermione’s name, and soon he was whooshing out into a cosy living room lined with bookcases. The woman lying on the couch, bare feet propped up on the armrest, looked up from her book in surprise. She had large, dark eyes and short cropped black hair, and looked vaguely familiar.
Finally they reached the Kennet & Avon Canal, which connected boats all the way to Bristol.  Here the canal was clear and flowing, and full of Muggles living or holidaying on their boats.  There were towpaths, and nice pubs at the water’s edge.
“Not just me,” Potter said. “Dumbledore said Ron played the best game of chess at Hogwarts for years.”
Just then Molly called out something to Arthur and he stepped over to the house to talk with her. Harry was left with Malfoy and the vintage automobile.
a juvenile at that time, Potter. Not someone old enough to have access to Ministry stationery. Hmm. Was this letter your idea of revenge?”
“Mmmm.”  Draco plus Ron equalled a problem Harry didn’t see a solution to.  Maybe Hermione could help, but she had even less cause to like Draco.
A friendly monk woke them up next morning while it was still dark so that they could attend the prayers.  Harry stood there sleepily, not really understanding anything, and tried not to do anything out of place.
Petunia took a flower in her hand, and the petals only drooped.  Petunia clutched her fist shut until her fingernails left marks on her flesh, and opened her hand again.  Her flower was crushed.
“Seaweed, that’s it! I bet we need to put it in water to be able to read it, just like you need to be underwater to understand spoken Mermish.” Harry filled a bowl with water and dropped the square in. It slowly expanded and the scratches on the surface became words.
with him?  He hated when people tried to touch his own scar.  He didn’t know what had come over him.
Harry thanked her as best he could.  Draco kissed his mother’s cheek and pressed his face to hers, clasping her hands.  Then he turned to Harry, drew him in tight, and Apparated them both to his flat off Diagon Alley.
They read the book again from the beginning, and then Teddy begged Draco for a song before he slept.  “The one you always sing.”
After a slightly bumpy Portkey trip they arrived, in the steamy capital of the northern Oro province of Papua New Guinea.  They set off on their brooms for the nearest stretch of rainforest.  The snake, now much more cheerful, asked to be let off at the top of a tree, so they dipped down enough to let it slither into some branches.  In moments its brilliant green coloring had blended into the leaves and it was lost from view.
The crowd erupted in cheers. Ginny had caught the Snitch, and Harry had missed seeing it. As people began to pour out of the stands, Harry looked around for Malfoy’s pale hair, but didn’t see him anywhere.
“Yeah,” Harry admitted, with a little pang for the things he loved about the life he’d be leaving here.  But he understood a little better what Draco had once said about finding one thing to look forward to, to keep you going. “What do you suppose they have in Zanzibar?”
Draco laid his paws on the ground, rested his head on them, and heaved a sigh.  “I can’t keep you here against your will.  You’re free to go back.  But – I’m doing the best I can, Harry.  If you could just be patient….  Please don’t listen if they try to come between us.”
They explained again.  “Ah.  Love must find its way,” said the West Wind.  “I will help you if I can.  I don’t know the way to this castle, but I can take you to my friend the South Wind.  He’s a bit of a hot-head, but fiercely loyal to his friends and he doesn’t give up.”
That was true enough, but Harry found himself unable to just let this go.  “Yeah – well – maybe we could just… try, anyway?”
“My neighbor’s chickens, mostly, and the occasional goat.  And the neighbor’s kids, when the mangoes on my tree are ripe.”
Harry opened it, read the brief lines and looked up in confusion. “She wants to know what kind of sweets I like.”
“Oh, hello, Harry!  Are you seeing Draco?  That’s good!”  Flushed and rumpled, Harry nodded.  Luna wasn't fazed by much.
By now Draco was standing an arm’s length away, a tentative hand outstretched.  Finally he reached out to tuck a lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. “You can assume,” he added in a shaky voice, “that I want you.”
“No, there’s a name for that sort of sea-unicorn.  A campchurch?  But what is it doing here?  They’re not supposed to live in fresh water.”
All the people wishing to commission verse were accustoming Draco to a wider circle of human contact.  He decided to go to a Quidditch match, something he hadn’t done in ages.
At least, the two dapple-greys on the outside were galloping. The horse in the center seemed to be trotting. Holding the reins for all three of them, Draco had his hands full. But somehow he knew what to do, and the troika sleigh flew merrily over the snow in a landscape he’d never seen.
A mild breeze stirred Potter’s ever-tousled hair.  The May sunshine was warm on Draco’s skin, and the sky was blue.  “It’s a lovely day, really.  We could fly there,” Draco heard himself say.
“No need, it’s fine as a couch. Honestly, I might end up sleeping on the floor, it would be more like the bed in my hut.”
“What? Where?” Draco couldn’t imagine Æthelflæd sobbing. Could Merfley be nursing some secret sorrow? He followed Potter around the side of the Manor. Sure enough, there were heart-rending cries coming from a tangle of brambles that they hadn’t had time to clear. But who would hide in the middle of thorn bushes?
On a stormy late afternoon in February, the little coffee shop Harry owned in Oxford was a warm and aromatic refuge, but most people were trying to hurry home before the snow got deeper.  Then the door was flung open and some idiot in a big furred hat and long grey cloak posed in the doorway, declaiming:
“You said there was a gem on her horn?  Perhaps she could be attracted with jewelry.  Would you like me to make some for you?”
The moon had risen, nearly full. Merfley announced the Mooncalf Quadrille for anyone who wished to try it. Luna jumped up immediately. Her father invited Æthelflæd. Kingsley asked Professor McGonagall, and Harry tugged Draco. “Come on, Merfley says eight dancers make a set.” Hagrid said he’d watch.
“That was interesting,” Potter said, looking after Baines with a small frown.  “Seems like there should be more, though.  I mean, I don’t exactly feel qualified to do this yet.”
“I know she was an accomplished military strategist, but I’ve always thought it was hard on the bees,” Luna said.
“What am I up to with Bill Weasley, you mean?  Nothing scandalous. His wife’s part Veela, Potter, I wouldn’t stand a chance.” Malfoy laughed. “I just do some consulting.  He’s a curse-breaker, and I help him identify obscure curses sometimes.  The Manor library has a number of relevant books.”
Rutherford was well-rested from her sleeper-car ride, and managed the sea-crossing without difficulty.  She glided south, toward the island of Kyushu, following Potter’s trace to a wooded ravine full of hot springs where a little wizarding village of traditional inns offered open-air bathing.  And there he was!  His hair was even wilder than usual from the steam and he looked relaxed.
“Let it in, would you?  There are owl treats in a dish there – oh, I may be out of them. Try giving it a gingernut biscuit, there are some on a plate near the chair.”
“Well, it’s a tall order to take on single-handedly.”  Malfoy seemed to take a deep breath, then moved to go on up the path.  “Been lovely chatting with you, but I have to get out of this sun.”
“It was, of course.  People there thought I was very odd.”  Draco shrugged.  “But at least they didn’t hate me on sight.  And clearly the beliefs I’d been brought up with led to very bad ends, so I thought I’d better try to start fresh.  See what Muggles knew about magic, back in the Middle Ages when they still believed in it.  Read the way they talked about Merlin and King Arthur.  And then I just found I loved the poetry.”
When they got back to the castle the bear disappeared while Harry went in for dinner.  When Harry was in bed in the dark, Draco came back in his human form, and they enjoyed each other until Draco fell asleep.
“I think some private - tutorials - might be possible.”  Malfoy’s breathing had an odd little hitch in it. “Fees to be arranged.”
“There was a lot of smuggling through Wiltshire in the old days, and some smugglers had hidden a barrel of brandy in a pond.  They were starting to rake it out by the light of the full moon, when the officers who collect excise taxes came by and asked what they were doing.  The smugglers played dumb and pointed to the reflection of the moon in the water, and said they were trying to rake up that great round cheese which had somehow fallen into the pond.  Then the excise-men laughed at the stupid yokels who couldn’t tell the moon from cheese, and left, and the yokels laughed at the stupid excise-men, and raked up their barrel of brandy.  We’re quite proud of that story here, villages fight over whose pond it happened in.”
Draco lay back, grabbed his knees, and spread himself as wide as he could for Harry. Harry drank in his flushed cheeks, rosy swollen lips, nipples and cock, now rising again.  The tip of his own cock pushed against his lover’s pink hole and he entered that sweet tight heat with a cry of pleasure.  With effort he held back, watching Draco’s eyes, until he got a breathless nod and began to move.  So good, so good.
“I’m loose, Draco, I’m ready.”  Harry pulled Draco’s hand to his arse, pressed Draco’s finger against his opening, already relaxed from their previous love-making.  Draco slid a finger in easily and felt for Harry’s prostate.  Harry gasped.  “I could – I could - ”
“I mean, does it have to be a boy? I could kiss you,” Parvati said in a quiet voice. Parvati, who never flinched. “Could I kiss you?”
Harry felt an odd current of excitement. “Here all night making excuses?” His voice had turned husky. “Or kissing?”
Next morning, as Harry sat tossing the golden apple and wishing he could eat it for breakfast, a black-haired lassie popped her head out the window above him.  He knew it wasn’t the troll-princess, because this lassie had just a little pug-nose.
When she said she wanted to split up, he’d told her, with complete honesty, that he’d never looked at another woman.  “That’s not the point, Harry,” Ginny had said.  “The problem is, you don’t see me.”
They were almost to the hut when someone called Harry’s name.  Of all people Draco did not need to see at that moment, it was Weasley, jogging towards them.
“Extraordinarily bad luck?” the man said, half under his breath, then squared his shoulders.  “Honestly, Potter, why would I go traipsing around the middle of Africa to look for you?”
“Do I want to traipse all over the world repatriating three snakes who somehow turned up in your plumbing?”
Ludicrous as this advice was, Draco had no better options. But it was hard to get any sound out when faced with a slavering three-headed beast.
The food wasn’t bad, but the noise from the bar was as bad as ever.  “Your room is here?  How can you sleep?” Draco exclaimed.
“Really?  That’s great!” Harry said, dropping a gnome and running toward him.  “What did they do?  What did they say?”
“Bananas, the sort of angular ones.  Want some?  I’ve got it,” he added, as Draco started to shift on the seat in an attempt to reach his money.  Harry passed a few crumpled bills out the window and bought a bunch of bananas and an ear of the hard, dry, chewy roasted maize, enjoying the smoky smell.  Later he flung Draco’s banana peel and his maize cob out the open window.  A goat would eat them.
“Ah, I forgot how long you’ve been away,” Ron said. “Yeah, I was angry the first couple of years after the war, a lot of people were. But since then you know, he went round and apologised, turned over a new leaf, he’s been quite decent. Went through the whole truth-and-reconciliation thing after the war, made reparations. So yeah, he was awful back then, but that’s sort of – water under the bridge now?”
Harry had never heard anyone mention a Squib in the family so casually. “Thanks, Padma,” he said thoughtfully, tucking his book under his arm.
After a bit she turned to see how Potter liked his poem.  He was frowning at the parchment.  It did look a bit bedraggled, what with the wear and tear of thousands of miles, sea air, rain, mud, train smoke, dragon smoke, and the odd bit of mouse blood.  She had tried to be careful, but there was only so much an owl could do.
An apology from Potter?  Would wonders never cease.  On the other hand, Draco was delinquent on quite a few apologies himself.  Perhaps it behooved him to be polite.  “Yes, well.  Thanks for helping,” he said.
“Do what…?”  Turning, Harry saw a stunned-looking Draco Malfoy, dressed in swimming trunks, the towel over his shoulders not entirely hiding a scar across his chest.
Harry sucked on Draco’s earlobes and Draco twined his fingers in his hair.  Harry nuzzled his neck, then lifted Draco’s hand to his mouth, sucked his fingers, and tongued the webs between them.
Harry reached the top of a hill and paused for breath and the view. He’d thought, after that miserable stay in the Forest of Dean, that he’d had enough of wild camping for a lifetime. But after the trials and funerals that filled the first few months after the war, he felt a need to get away, to be alone with nothing more pressing to do than walk and breathe and look at hills and trees and water and sky. So he’d found an old guidebook for wizarding walking tours and headed for Scotland, where freedom to roam the land was a traditionally recognized right. And now here he was, drinking in the clean air, the rose and orange colored clouds…
“Thank you,” Malfoy said, his tone a little more sincere.  “But I just have window-boxes, and they get the sun.  Those flowers need shade.  My mother grows them, they’re lilies of the valley.  Are you sure you don’t want to plant them?”
Harry forced his eyelids to flutter open.  Blurrily he saw that he was in a strange bed, and that light sparkled off water somewhere outside the window.  The lake.  He was in Draco Malfoy’s bed, in a cabin by the lake.  He had just come all over Draco Malfoy’s sheets, from a wet dream about Draco Malfoy.  Draco Malfoy, who was doubtless that dark shape in the doorway that Harry could barely make out from the corner of his eye, who had doubtless made that small sound.  And there was nothing Harry could do about it.  He couldn’t even move his head.  He shut his eyes again, and waited for the little noise of Draco leaving.  He fell asleep.
“Precisely what I was saying.  The snow is snittering snartly and the werbeling winds are wapping.  Therefore I need tea, at once.  Darjeeling.”
The world went blurry.  Then his own lenses, with their two tiny worlds of clarity, came slowly closer.  It was disorientating, and instinctively he shut his eyes.  Warm, dry fingers brushed his cheekbones again, and then Malfoy’s palms were against Harry’s cheeks as he carefully settled the glasses onto Harry’s nose.
“You’ve ridden everything else, to hear you talk.  Dragons, flying motorcycles, hippogriffs.  Why not?”
“She’s near Pegasus – it’s a big square - and Perseus.  But you can’t see her right now.  How do you know my aunt Andromeda?  I don’t really know her myself.”
Draco looked down to see Greg gaping up at him.  Greg was waiting, as if for Draco to tell him what to do.  Draco looked around.  Fenrir Greyback was running toward Luna Lovegood.  “Help Lovegood!” Draco yelled.
Abruptly Draco realized when Potter must have been camping with Hermione. When they were on the run from the Dark Lord, right up until the Snatchers dragged them into the Manor. Where Hermione had been tortured. His hands shook a little as he poured the tea and handed it to Potter.
Damn it Potter, what are you doing here?  I know you can do better – hell, you could hide in thin air for no other reason than to throw mud in my hair, send me screaming back to Snape to make a fool of myself, talking about seeing your head in Hogsmeade.  Then there was 6th year on the train –  when I still thought I was choosing glory, not just gore.  The broken nose I gave you, before I made you disappear under that slippery thing, should have warned me otherwise.  I walked away not quite untouched - a little splash of you, red and sticky on my shoe, making my footprints bleed.
Paths kept splitting off, and after a while Draco began to sense that he was walking in circles.  A feeling that was confirmed when he unexpectedly found himself walking out of the woods back towards Hagrid’s hut.  It was as if the forest had evicted him.
“All right, you win.”  He stroked her back.  “Let’s close the computer.  Should we go out to take the evening air?”
“Er… no, thank you,” Draco said, remembering Luna’s radish earrings and necklace of Butterbeer corks.  “But you’ve given me an idea.”
Harry stared at him numbly.  Swearing, Malfoy turned him around and propelled him through an open doorway into another room.  The bedroom, Harry realised.
“The assailant was captured by your partner and taken in for booking.  No one else was injured.  As for your vision, your glasses came off and weren’t found, so we’ve brought these as a substitute.  We can fit you for a new prescription before you leave – perhaps a more stylish frame?”
“Oh – sorry about those.”  Harry didn’t mind them, really, and they were convenient in the absence of refrigeration or cooling charms.  But he could see that the orange color might be a little off-putting.
This wasn’t the first erection he’d had since the day of the curse.  Sometimes he would get random muscle spasms in his legs or his cock.  An erect cock didn’t mean he could feel it.
At least the fellow had finally closed the door behind him, and was taking off the ridiculous Russian-looking hat and green scarf that had hidden his face.  It was Draco Malfoy, which figured, somehow.  Harry didn’t feel very apologetic informing him that the shop didn’t serve Darjeeling.
“Thanks.  Not much like Crabbe and Goyle, then,” Harry retorted and then could have kicked himself – he’d somehow forgotten Crabbe’s death in the Room of Requirement.
They arranged to meet at Grimmauld Place for dinner the following Saturday evening, and Potter left.  Flying.  Maybe someday they would get to compare brooms….  Draco sighed and started trying to transfigure some protection for his garden, while Greg stirred four spoons of sugar into his tea and ate all the biscuits.
He had declined to go with her.  He knew his mother loved him, and had risked a great deal to protect him.  But she also loved elegance and grace, and the sight of him now seemed to pain her.  If he was to be a disappointment to both his parents… There was no point forcing his presence upon her.  Besides, he couldn’t bear the thought of being hidden away in a house while the war went on outside, and the Dark Lord hunted Harry.
“I’m here on business of the Centaur Liaison Office of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.”
She is back in the Great Hall at Hogwarts at her first day Sorting Ceremony, watching from her new place at the Gryffindor table as Sev is sent off to the Slytherins. Lucius Malfoy, cold and pale and gleaming with his prefect’s badge, pats him on the back as Sev sits down with them.  Lucius catches Lily’s intent gaze, and his mouth moves.  Lily has no trouble reading his disdainful lips.
“A hippalectryon. Well, I must go.  Father thinks there may be a Crumple-Horned Snorcack down in Withycombe Scruffets, so we’re going to go and have a look around.”
The healing sunlight fell on him, and the salt air of this foreign shore lifted shame away.  He brought Harry’s hand over his heart and held it there.  Harry gathered Draco in his arms and kissed him, and they fell backwards.
Harry recognised that bored, cultured voice.  He expected an edge of malice to slice through it at any moment.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You found me out, Malfoy. It was an elaborate plot to get you to confess your not-loathing of me.”
“I would never sleep with someone if I didn’t know what he looked like,” said Harry’s aunt.  “He could be a monster.”
Lavender smiled. “Thanks! It’s been a lot of work but it’s fun. Do you want me to read your tea leaves?”
Ruthie!”  Draco’s face lit up with wonderment, his awed voice trembled.  It was very satisfactory.  Rutherford gave him an affectionate blink but decided to conclude her business with Potter first.  Let Draco see how seriously she took her work!  Rutherford shook the leg with the parchment at Potter.
In the darkness they bumped and fumbled, but it didn’t matter.  All Harry could hear was their quickening breathing and the blood pounding in his ears.
Harry’s cock throbbed.  His eyes stung, and he shut them.  “Harry?” Draco’s voice called softly.  Harry turned blindly toward the voice, his arms outstretched, pulled Draco in and kissed him.  Maybe he’d gone mad; maybe he’d fallen through the looking-glass; he didn’t care, the kiss was sweet as air to a drowning man.
Well, it didn’t really, none of it made sense.  But then, this was Potter, and nothing about Potter was the same as anyone else.
“It doesn’t know how it got here and is quite angry about it.  It would prefer to be back in the rain forests of New Guinea.  We are too big to eat and therefore safe.  It has agreed to remain here for a short time to see if we can come up with a way to get it home, although it says the air is unpleasantly cold and dry here.”
“Very well, Mr. Malfoy.  You have reminded me that trust can be misplaced, and so can mistrust I suppose.  I could wish that your head of house had not been forced into the role of double agent, and had given you a less ambiguous model of moral behavior here at Hogwarts.  But I haven’t heard of you misbehaving since the end of the war.
“It’s Katie Bell’s – she has rather an addiction to new magical kitchen gadgets, says she doesn’t have time to do all the spells by hand.  Supposedly you just use a starter charm and this thing does the rest.”  Malfoy looked sceptical, but sounded amused when he continued.  “Unfortunately she also has a young niece with particularly wild spurts of uncontrolled magic that always wreak havoc with appliances.  I’m never short of work after little Leticia’s been to visit."
Harry looked more carefully at the mansion. He’d never seen Malfoy Manor from the back, but that could certainly be the house. Luna must have got the animal hospital’s coordinates wrong.
“In a minute, Greg.  I’m sorry, Potter, it looks like our conversation must be postponed again.  Perhaps we should try your house next time.“
Bears are very fast runners, Harry discovered, as they sped through a meadow.  He was laughing with exhilaration by the time the bear skidded to a halt and he slid off.   The bear ambled over to a brook to drink, and Harry did the same.  The bear began eating berries that grew nearby.
“Well, a few things have happened since the last time we played Quidditch against each other,” Malfoy said quietly.
He went out to take his leave. It was awkward, with neither of them quite looking at the other.  Only when Harry turned back at the foot of the stairs did he catch a flash of Malfoy’s eyes, unexpectedly dark as they watched Harry go.
“And your bees are going to be all up in my rosebushes.  Zzzzzz,” Draco buzzed against the side of Harry’s neck.
“It was tempting sometimes, but… it would have felt like cheating? You were a war hero who deserved a vacation. I was someone who needed to make restitution.” Draco was silent for a moment, looking out at the horizon. “And it’s worked out. I have my potion making and research.”
Hermione was looking at him steadily.  “You know I don’t like him and you know why.  But he hasn’t made any trouble since the war, I’ll say that for him, and his reparations service seems above board, from what I hear.  If it’s important to you, Harry…”
“I have to run off, but I think Harry wants to browse a bit.  Thanks so much for placing the special orders, Padma.”  Hermione waved goodbye and left.
At the hospital, the healer helped him into a wheeled chair before running a number of tests.  Draco didn’t like sitting in the chair – it was something for old people, feeble people, people at the end of their lives, not him – he was young, it was his right to stand and walk and run….
“What are hamentashen?” Lavender asked, and soon she was jotting notes about cookie dough and the merits of poppyseed versus apricot filling.
One evening, when Weasley had gone to visit his family and Granger had gone to bed early with a pile of books, Harry came to stand beside Draco at the window.  There was no moon, and the city was a bad place for seeing stars.  “In Wiltshire you might see glow-worms now,” Draco said.
Harry and Draco looked at each other.  They were the same age and about the same height, both British and both white, but there the resemblance ended.  “No, this is - Mr Malfoy,” said Harry, thinking it sounded very odd.
“She and Lavender opened a shop together, Tea and Tarot. In the beginning they just served tea and pastries and did readings – tea leaves, tarot cards, crystal ball. And then – how did Taro Tuesdays get started, Padma?”
“Yeah,” Harry said.  He’d spent a few months in France as Draco’s mind-healer, while Draco climbed back out of despair and an overwhelming sense of failure.  And though that time had cost Harry his engagement to Ginny, he thought that was for the best.  Ginny had seemed happier afterwards, returning to her Quidditch career, and Harry had emerged feeling lighter too.
Harry didn’t mind.  It was just so fun to be in the air again.  He regained his balance and started to test the broom, trying different maneuvers until he managed a loop-the-loop around Malfoy.  Then he pulled alongside for the pleasure of seeing Malfoy roll his eyes at him.
People came by to see Potter, and sometimes they ended up at Draco’s door instead, one of the room’s quirks.  Weasley came once when Potter was out, and hung about at loose ends long enough for Draco to use him to practice arm wrestling.  Weasley was happy to beat him and never guessed he was being used.   Ginevra Weasley came once or twice, supposedly to ask Potter about Quidditch strategy; she and Draco exchanged cool nods.
Draco let his fingers follow the trail of hair down, down, into a warm tangle where something was rising to meet his hand.  He stroked Potter’s hot length.
“Southwest England. It was the Kingdom of the West Saxons, up to about a thousand years ago. Alfred the Great was a king of Wessex, and he had a wyvern on his flag.”
Harry had found a Muggle teacher in London and taken lessons, and adapted a Muggle CD player for their flat.  Sometimes they went back to Paris on short trips to the jazz and blues clubs.  Harry had improved enough that he didn’t automatically use
A memory returned of the wrangling at Draco’s sentencing. Though Potter’s testimony had saved him from Azkaban, no one was going to let Draco off completely. Some of the Wizengamot had argued for house arrest, some for community service, some for confiscating Malfoy Manor (which turned out not to be entirely legal).
Draco was still talking.  “His brother Regulus is a star in Leo somewhere.  Andromeda is a constellation of her own – you can see her low on the horizon sometimes – she’s my mother’s sister.  And Aunt Bellatrix, who unfortunately was the one I actually knew.  She’s in Orion, not hard to find, but let’s not look for her.”
“This chair will greatly increase your mobility,” the healer said.  “You can even Apparate in it.  Be sure to renew the Cushioning Charms often, to prevent pressure sores, since you’ll spend so much time in it.”
One morning a horsewoman rode through the gates on an enormous palomino. Draco went to meet her as she swung down, a compact woman in her forties with dark eyes and short dark hair lightly streaked with grey.
Malfoy considered.  “Tell my teenaged father that Voldemort was a jumped-up half-blood loser who would drag his followers down with him?”
“It’s a new appointment for me.  Of course, meeting with the centaurs themselves is a priority.”  He passed the paperwork through to show her.
“Come when you can.  I always love to see you, but I know you have other friends you want to spend time with.”  She turned to Harry.  “I am afraid your experiences in this house have not been… pleasant, Mr Potter.  I regret that and assure you that any guests of my son are welcome in my home.”
“Not with all this moonlight,” Draco said, but he cast a stabilizing spell on the boat and climbed up.
“I should think so,” Draco said. “Dudley seems like a solid type but not what you would call ingenious.”
His thoughts were interrupted by the call to come have tea, and he returned gratefully to the Burrow to bask in the Weasleys’ affection.
Finally Rosemonde could be unyoked, and then Draco had to transfigure the chariot into a usable wheelchair for the ground.  It was awkward to do while sitting in it, and it never turned out as well as his own wheelchair, but that was back in France, so it would have to do.
From there it went quickly, just a few more pieces dragging each other off until Draco’s king removed his crown with a martyred air.
The students were making their own mortarboard caps from taped together white paper.  The caps rose high, like a chef’s hat, with long strips of accordion-pleated paper taped on for the tassels. Draco took a scrap of paper and folded an origami crane for Yamikani, the warm, earnest, capable Head Girl, who started a fad by attaching it to the end of her tassel.  He was thereafter kept busy folding more and giving origami lessons to whichever laughing students had the patience to make their own.
“Malfoy? Are you all right?” Potter dropped the snowball and approached. “Sorry, I thought you wouldn’t mind…”
Somehow he’d forgotten Potter’s presence.  “Just thinking about – my wand,” Draco answered.  “Good night.”
He went the other way at the first fork in the path, and walked for quite a distance (humming, in case Fluffy was about) without seeing anything more than some Bowtruckles.  A few times he called out, “Greetings to the centaurs of the Forbidden Forest!” feeling rather foolish since he never received any reply.
The next day Harry rode on the bear’s back through woods and meadows until they came again to the village where the Dursleys lived.
“What makes you so cocksure about everything?” Draco grumbled.  Potter gave him a sharp side-long glance.
Harry had a sudden vivid memory of Narcissa Malfoy bending over him in the Forbidden Forest where he waited for discovery and death, the long pale fall of her silky hair shielding his face as she whispered to him, asking after her son.  “She was brave.  She lied to Voldemort to protect you.  And that saved my life too.”
.”  Firm hands were on Harry's shoulders, shaking him slightly, and Malfoy was frowning into his face.  “You didn’t kill him.  Voldemort left the poison, and Dumbledore chose to drink it.  You did what he asked of you, though Merlin knows it was a hell of a thing to ask of anyone.”
“Come up here and kiss me,” he said.  Harry surged up his body, wrapped his arms around Draco and kissed him passionately.  Draco kissed him back, feeling his own desire fizzing through his veins.  When Harry pulled away for air, his green eyes were dark with wanting.
Harry looked too, and saw the small fishing boats coming in to shore as the sun sank lower at his back.  If he crossed the lake eastward, he’d be in Mozambique; if he followed the shore as far north as it went, he’d reach Tanzania. But for now he was content to be here in Malawi, the “warm heart of Africa.”  He hoped that his volunteer work at least somewhat repaid the welcome he’d received from the people of this poor but peaceful country.
Harry grinned.  “Yeah, and they only make it past all the demons because of Sun Wu Kong, the splendid Monkey King!  He has amazing super-powers for fighting evil.  And he’s very good at spotting demons, which is crucial because the monk he’s traveling with is virtuous but kind of dim-witted.”
As a short-eared owl, Rutherford had a nomadic nature.  It was a calm night, and gliding across the English Channel by starlight was a pleasure.
Draco was kneeling, straddling Harry’s groin, his back and head upright.  “Your face is kind of far-off and fuzzy up there,” Harry said. “Come closer.”
A flicker of movement down there caught his eye.  A large toad on the ground had just caught a fly.  The toad looked familiar.  “Is that Trevor?”
The hex that had thrown Harry backwards into a fruit stand near Diagon Alley had knocked him out and sent oranges bouncing and pears cascading.  But it hadn’t done any lasting damage, the healer at St. Mungo’s assured him when he opened his eyes.
“Draco, anyone should be proud to have you for a son.  As for whatever happened to your dad … he didn’t seem unhappy, anyway,” Harry said.  Happier than Lucius Malfoy deserved to be, probably, but for Draco’s sake he let that go.  He unbuttoned the collar of Draco’s robes so that he could reach his shoulders better.
“My trip to South America for potions research.  There was an American Muggle scientist who kept going on about
Meanwhile Harry drank green tea in one of the open air teahouses, nibbled sunflower seeds, bought a carved wooden mask with wild bamboo-root hair for Teddy, and watched an old man practicing calligraphy on the pavement with a very large brush and a pail of water. The artist fitted his large, elegant, confident characters to the rectangular gray paving stones, where they gleamed and gradually faded away.
“No, the one who was a seeker for Ravenclaw.  The one you moped over at the Yule Ball.  Long black hair…”
A few things.  The last time he had played against Malfoy had been during their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry realised.  Before Sirius was killed.  Before Malfoy’s father was sent to Azkaban.  Harry’s last match against Slytherin, sixth year, had felt curiously flat without Malfoy on the pitch. Then came their confrontation in the bathroom, curses flying, Malfoy falling, his blood soaking into Harry’s clothes.  And after all that, the war.
“You don’t want to come down with peacock fever.  Screechy voice, feathery hair, delusions of feathers growing out your arse, insatiable desire to strut around staring in mirrors….”
He shook himself slightly.  Now was no time for Shakespearean sonnets to pop into mind, especially such a nonsensical one as that.  Potter was giving him a quizzical smile that Draco had no idea how to respond to, so he excused himself and walked away.
Potter shrugged. Draco started walking away.  He felt Potter’s eyes on him, all the way to the school gate.
“I’ll come,” said Draco, taking one of the small plastic buckets from Harry.  Kili trotted after them for a little way, anxious about Harry leaving again so soon.  They crossed the dirt road in front of the house and entered the empty school grounds, going down the wide cement steps where students sat for assemblies, then on a steep winding dirt path between the dorms, finally crossing the open area where the boys played football, near the girls’ netball hoops, and down to the community borehole.  No one else was there this late.  It didn’t take long to pump enough water to fill the two pails, and then they headed back in the fading light.  Kili was waiting.
There was the sound of footsteps pounding, coming up from behind.  Potter arrived, gasping and disheveled.  He joined in, gasping a bit to catch his breath.
He thought of the past couple of months, of the connections he’d made and the help he’d received. McGonagall, Padma, Dean, Neville, Luna, Ron, the Anggitay, Hermione, Kastania….  And here he was in Harry’s arms.
When the grey dawn came, the pug-nosed lassie came and chased Harry away again.  But he’d twisted a little ring from his hair that he’d pulled from the carding-comb, and he left that on Draco’s finger.
Rutherford spotted a cathedral in the distance and flew over to investigate.  She was in France, after all, so she might as well make the most of it.  The stained glass was beautiful.  The gargoyles, as usual, were interesting but rude.
“There are similar problems everywhere; around the world, the spaces for nature magic are shrinking.”
He explained to Potter that it was a narrowboat, used for canals and rivers.  “It originally belonged to my many-times great aunt Winonia Malfoy, a very independent witch and a bit of a black sheep in the family.  She got it when she and her boat-elf, Wufflina I, retired from the seafaring life.  It was the heyday of British canals then. She probably used it for smuggling.”
Harry went in, but when he turned to look, the bear was gone.  Inside the hall was a long table laden with food but set for only one. Harry didn’t see anyone else, so he sat down alone. Everything he tasted was delicious, and the dishes were never empty. He ate until he was full.
Wondering, Harry and Draco followed the other guests to the pond. The moon had gone behind a cloud, darkening the sky. A small blue light gleamed from the surface of the pond, and then another. And then there were little constellations of blue and green light, swooping here and there. The lights formed patterns, bloomed outward, pulled in, spun in circles, scintillating.
Potter had gone to look out a window. “It’s snowing,” Potter announced. “Big thick flakes, and it’s sticking.”
But Draco was answering somewhat stiffly, “Of course not.  But clearly, courtesy would’ve been wasted on you.  And you were no angel yourself.”
“There’s to be a garden party at four,” Lucius informed Harry, before turning to Draco.  “Do I know you?”
Draco huffed a laugh and they began walking the tree-lined path again, now and then catching views of nearby slopes, small lakes, or shrines.  They stopped at the top to eat and admire the view, and then headed back down.
Potter yelped as some snow went down his collar, then stooped to arm himself, swearing revenge. Draco backed away, running and laughing. Soon the snowballs were flying and Draco was full of that exhilaration unique to going one on one with Harry Potter.
Draco explained what he had recently learned. “They make squid skin change color, glow, and flash with light. Æthelflæd and I are researching the magic for them. We hope to offer the full spectrum for those of Herman’s siblings that are interested. But first we need to bring the squidlets here, which is why we’ve made the pond. Are you ready to try swimming there, Herman?”
Malfoy’s own jaw dropped, and then he gave an incredulous, exhilarated laugh as he landed.  “I beat you to the Snitch!  I can die happy.  Though not just yet, I hope.”
But on this day, Draco was sitting cross-legged on the floor with Old Timer’s head in his lap and a worried look on his face.
“Different holidays,” Anthony said. “If Passover didn’t fall during the Easter holiday I could get permission to go home for Seder on the first night, and my mum would send me back with a load of matzoh and coconut macaroons, and sometimes at school she would owl me challah or rugelach, or hamentashen at Purim. But you can’t owl hot latkes.”
“Well, that’s all I have time for,” Baines said.  “You get the general idea.  I have to get back to St Mungo’s.  Here’s a pamphlet with some tips on using your chair, I’ll just leave it on the table.  You should be able to carry on from here.”
.  All his ingenuity for fixing things had gone into navigating the new difficulties in his daily life, like finding ways to make his chair more mobile so that he could get around the castle. Now, though, he was able to glide to the top of the Astronomy Tower.  He had to think about his family, so he went to look at the night sky.
So he invited Draco to dinner at Grimmauld Place, hinting at a task for the Magical Repairs and Reparations service.
“Do I, personally, have zebras?  You mean, wandering around my yard?  No, Malfoy.  Most of Africa is not a safari lodge.”
“Yeah, I have to renew the bird-poo protection charms often, but it’s worth it.  Don’t leave anything shiny laying about, she’s a thief, aren’t you, Cassia?”  Padma smiled with amused affection at her bird.  “Did you ever get another owl, Harry?”
She beamed, gap-toothed. “It means ‘Amazing Flying One’.  I’m going to play Quidditch someday.  Do you like Quidditch?”
Harry bade her farewell, got on the new horse, and rode on until he saw a golden-haired lassie sitting and spinning a golden spinning wheel without any thread.  She had a dreamy look in her big googly blue eyes.
Yet somehow they had both come through it all, to stand here, brooms in hand in the spring sunshine.  Words left him.  Harry met Malfoy’s intent and silent gaze and held it until he felt something open inside himself.  As though he were soaring like a hawk on an air current, effortless, floating.
The words stuck in his throat – but he had to tell someone, sometime.  “I poisoned him.”  His voice was hoarse.
“I don’t want to live there,” Harry said.  “Just visit.  Just have a little change of scenery, talk to some other human beings.  In daylight.  Is that too much to ask?”
“Theobromancy,” Draco answered absently, gazing at the card he’d unwrapped, a portrait of a harassed-looking teenager with unruly hair and a lightning scar.
Potter still hadn’t returned by midnight, which was unusual for him.  Rutherford flew up high to concentrate better.  Her owl sense told her he had gone east.  She followed.  Finally she reached the seashore and realized that Potter had crossed over to the Continent.
Harry had testified for Malfoy’s trial because he’d believed that the worst of what Malfoy had done in the war was under compulsion. He’d thought Malfoy had, in the end, been looking for a way out of Voldemort’s service. He’d hoped that given a chance, Malfoy could change. But it seemed not.
“Bye.”  Harry waved back and then hurried after Narcissa, who was moving surprisingly quickly back the way they had come.
“I need to be in you, now,” Harry panted, rising and turning Draco against the wall, tugging at his own trousers.
“That’s my mother’s handwriting,” Draco said, looking over his shoulder. “It’s not a Howler, and she’s sent me extra chocolate. It’s probably safe.”
Pansy raised her brows. “You’ve already decided to live together?  Are you sure that’s wise, Draco?”
They made lists on the blackboard.  “Those students sat outside on the ground under a tree.  Their school didn’t have a classroom or chairs or books, like we do,” his students said.  “But they had teachers, they answered questions, they learned new words, like us.”
The procession of sumo wrestlers had their hair in topknots, bare chests, and impressive bellies cradled by colorful aprons that fell past their knees.  Each had a unique, ornately embroidered design: a dragon, a flag, a mountain, and on one baby-faced swaggerer, cherry blossoms.
“Well, congratulations, I guess,” Potter said. “Though I think it would be easier to live around if it were still mute.”
“Hmm, not much about them specifically, we don’t have any at the preserve. They’re smaller than your other dragons of course, just the two legs, no fire… Very protective of their territory, I’ve heard. Good at keeping down pests like Red Caps and Nogtails.”
“Surely you’ve met?  Ignatius,” Malfoy called, then poked his head around a half-open door. “He’s not in the bedroom –”
“Are you, er, doing much writing these days?  That is – sorry.  You don’t have to answer that if it’s personal.”  Potter was fumbling over his words.
That didn’t seem quite fair, since Harry had his own bag to carry, but the hot chips were delicious, and so was the sparkle in Draco’s eyes and the feel of his hand on Harry’s shoulder.  Harry pursed his lips to suck in the tips of Draco’s fingers as the next chip arrived.  Draco’s eyes darkened.
“I’m a bit – tired – but perhaps it’s as well we don’t wait.  Go ahead, then,” Dumbledore said.  He looked like he could barely stand, what was wrong with him?  Even his eyes were falling shut.
Longbottom had appeared from somewhere and was staring at them.  “Problem, Longbottom?” Draco asked frostily.  Longbottom shook his head.
Draco’s exhaustion was beginning to catch up with him.  But there was one more thing – what was it – Snape.  “What happened to Professor Snape, Harry?”
Narcissa went very still. Then she summoned an ancient house elf.  “Wiffly, do you remember the jewelry that I brought with me when I married? Good. Please pack it for me.”
“I give you permission to enter the school grounds as needed for your work; please don’t disappoint me.  And be sure to check in with the groundskeeper.”  She handed his papers back through the flames.
Draco saw his cousin dueling with a big Death Eater.  They both fell.  “Rosemonde, down!”  They swerved down and he saw Tonks was moving, so he pulled her into the chariot and they climbed quickly up to be out of range while she recovered.  She was looking frantically for someone.
“When did you meet Harry Potter, Miranda?”  It was hard to imagine; Potter was known to be reclusive.
“This is one more problem with using house-elves for labour,” Hermione said. “They can’t be expected to know all these differing cultural traditions, but they haven’t been trained to cook for a diverse student body. From a post-colonial perspective…”
So Harry booked Portkey travel to Winnipeg, Manitoba.  From Winnipeg they flew to Narcisse, and saw more snakes in one place than Draco had ever dreamed of – slim, curious, friendly little garter snakes.  Their travel companion slithered off into the midst of them, his blue stripe flashing among his yellow-striped cousins.  When he finally returned he had an air of dreamy contentment.
“NOT MY SON YOU BITCH!”  And there was Draco’s father, bringing his silver cane crashing down on her wand arm.
Draco let himself into their ground floor flat.  Harry was in the living room, curled up in his stocking feet in an armchair by the window.
It turned out that just outside Winnipeg was the home Quidditch pitch of another famed Canadian team, the Stonewall Stormers.  Harry and Draco were able to watch a practice and have a pint afterwards with the team, discussing the latest Canadian innovations in broom design with the Stormer’s Seeker.
“Yes, and a coy little smile. I can’t tell if it’s a beast of land or sea.  Who knows, perhaps its curly feet go cloud-galloping.”
“Patron saint of messengers and postal workers.  Would you like to meet him?  Here, wrap your arm in this towel, he has sharp talons on those long feathery legs of his.”
“Yes, the Lethifold attack here.  Being suffocated in one’s bed and eaten by a malevolent dark blanket thing just sounds so unpleasant.”
“Yes, and something that looks like a cross between a cucumber and a sea urchin.  And two heaps of peas.”
“Rumor has it that if you carry fern seeds in your pocket, you’ll be invisible.  You could give them the slip.”
Thunder growled, long and low and threatening.  Except that this thunder came from near the ground, just ahead. Draco cast Lumos to see through the dark forest and then stumbled backwards, scrambling to cast a Stunning spell.  Ahead of him loomed a huge dog with three heads, all baring very sharp yellow teeth.
Draco turned to the speaker. Harry Potter was in the sleigh with him, wearing a fur-trimmed cloak, high boots, and – armour?
“Even if they had wizarding help, that must have taken ages to carve,” Draco said.  “Why here, I wonder?”
They never hexed each other anymore, but surely teasing was allowed? Draco held the map behind his back. Potter lunged for it.  They dodged back and forth.  Potter  circled both arms around Draco.  For the sake of mischief, Draco kissed him.
Then Lucius Malfoy would lose no time in trying to force Draco to marry some “suitable” pureblood witch.
The owl darted a glance at Malfoy and shuffled from one foot to the other, but resolutely ignored Harry, who had taken the cue and was holding out a biscuit.
“You need to swallow more blood replenishing potion and get your rest.  Other questions can wait,” Madame Pomfrey said firmly.
“The car. How many other wyverns does it get to see? Besides, it’s a convenient way to carry the tuba. You can’t be more afraid of my driving than of unleashing a dragon, Potter, now get in.”
Harry wanted to wet his thumb and rub that inkstain off.  Among other things.  He looked around.   “Something’s come up,” he announced to the other customers.  “The shop is closing early today.  Sorry for the inconvenience.”
“It’s a beautiful island,” Draco said, “and fascinating, but awfully humid.  And I can’t help remembering….”
“It’s nice to get some variety after knitting jumpers all these years. How are the Russian mittens working out?”
“What?  Oh.  I suppose.  Anyway, when I came back I was even more restless.  So I left again. Sort of went on a quest.”
Draco reached out and tucked a lock of hair behind Harry’s ear. “Are you really all right?” he asked quietly.
When Harry opened his eyes again, a few owls were looking at him. He didn’t have any post for them to carry, or any owl treats to give. “Sorry,” Harry said with an apologetic shrug. But he felt a little lighter as he turned to go.
but in Africa he didn’t use magic.  He’d come to get away from wizarding politics for a while, and he had no desire to run afoul of a witch-hunt here, where fear of magic was strong.  He could get by like a Muggle again for a couple of years, if it was the price of a peaceful life.
One evening he and Draco were snogging on Draco’s sofa when there was a green whoosh in the fireplace.  To Harry’s confusion, Luna Lovegood’s face appeared in the flames.
Harry heard the scritch of a match as Draco re-lit the candle and left it burning on the bedside table, then followed Harry outside.  There was the barest sliver of moon, and the sky blazed with stars, thousands of stars, warm and brilliant.  “God, the southern skies are beautiful,” Draco breathed.
“You’re not going to cheat me out of those riches!  Not when we’re finally going to be repaid for all our care of you, ungrateful wretch!” cried Uncle Vernon.
Draco thought.  Harry slid off and lay next to him, reaching a hand to stroke Draco’s now soft cock.  He turned to look at Draco with a question in his eyes.
Draco ended up walking into Hogsmeade with Potter.  Luckily Draco had already been through the ordeal of apologizing to Rosmerta for putting her under Imperius back during the dreadful sixth year of school that preceded the infinitely worse seventh year.  So when Potter decided to join him for lunch at the Three Broomsticks, it wasn’t terribly awkward.  There was always Quidditch to talk about.
Rather to his own surprise, Harry found himself describing how after Voldemort’s defeat, feeling at loose ends and weary of his unwanted celebrity, he had wanted to get away from British wizarding society, see something of the world, do something quietly useful.  He had found a Muggle organization looking for overseas volunteers and requested to go to Africa.  It had sounded interesting and he’d heard of the many children orphaned by AIDS.  But his wizarding skills didn’t translate.  He wasn’t much use at Muggle health care or agriculture.  So they’d assigned him to be a teacher at a rural secondary school.
The food at the monastery guesthouse was simple and the rice was oddly crunchy from being cooked at high altitude, but otherwise the place was comfortable enough in a spartan way.
Harry answered before Draco could start in with his stories.  “Just someone I knew from my school days.”
“Where Fern goes, I go,” said Malfoy.  “She could never scratch her chin properly on those round eyeglass frames of yours, Potter.”
Harry pointed again.  “See that little smudge of light?”  He turned his face slightly, inhaling that scent he had smelled on Draco’s pillow.  He caught his breath and couldn’t help leaning back slightly against the chest behind him.
“And this is an injured and thirsty Abraxan. They live on single malt whisky.” The woman removed a Disillusionment Charm with a wave of her wand, and the horse’s wings became visible, one of them hanging crookedly.
“I’m sorry, Draco, but there’s stuff I can’t really tell anyone.  Except Ron and Hermione, well, they’ve been through everything with me from the beginning….”
He tucked the sock tenderly into Harry’s trunk.  Then he put his arms around his odd, disheveled, grieving, loving, heroic and humble lover.
Harry took off his raggedy hand-me-down clothes and sank into his bath.  It was so pleasant he let his eyes drift shut.   When he opened them, he saw that his old clothes were gone, but there was a big fluffy towel and a linen night-shirt laid out for him, and a door leading into a fine bedroom.
There was a slightly awkward silence, and then Harry said, “That book was certainly a hit.  Where did you find it?”
After some time, Harry became restless.  The nights were sweet, but there were so many things that Draco wouldn’t talk about, and Harry had no one else to talk to.  He didn’t have any chores, which was nice, but also left him with a lot of time on his hands.
Ron turned to Harry.  “Harry, Malfoy’s gone mental and started singing in the street.”  He brightened.  “Did you hex him to make a fool of himself?”
“Wonderful news.” Pansy smiled at him fondly. Draco would have been annoyed, but sometimes – his mother had been gone five years now – it was nice to get a fond smile.
“I finally heard about that book you wanted from the Czech Republic," Padma told Hermione. "It should be in next week.”
“I tried to tell your Uncle Harry who to be friends with. He said he could tell for himself who the wrong sort were. I disagreed with his conclusions, but years later I understood his premise.”
“Oh no,” Harry said. “Ginny was so furious when she made that. I thought she got Molly to take it apart.” Molly had made one of her clocks that showed activities and locations instead of hours, thinking Ginny would want to know where Harry was at all times. Ginny had said it was a violation of privacy.
“I learn well by example,” Harry added.  “Hands-on experience, that sort of thing.”  He wiggled his foot a bit higher up the inside of Malfoy’s thigh.
And that memory fades and Lily is back in this bedroom again, watching Harry lay his child in the cradle and go to the bed to join his lover – Draco.  As Harry slides under the covers, Draco kisses him, and she hears them murmur about the baby.  “You smell like violets,” Draco says.
Fucking dialogue tags.  Harry turned beet-red.  “Give it to me,” he said, reaching for the quill.  “I’d better set it.  Just suck the tip?”
“Says the man who dressed up in a sheet to look like a Dementor and scare the living daylights out of me.”
Draco paused on the threshold, studying him.  “May I come in?”  Getting no answer, he took a few cautious steps inside, closing the door behind him.  Harry stood, arms clenched across his chest, refusing to look at him.
Salt spray hit his glasses and the small boat rocked under them as Draco Malfoy, wet, wind-whipped and pink-cheeked, poured a netful of live fish over Harry’s feet. The fish flopped around, filling the bottom of the little dory.
“Yes, but all she could publish in her own name were translations. It wasn’t seemly for a gentlewoman to write original work.” Padma snorted.
“Evil relatives keeping you from a friend you love?  Of course I’ll help.  I can’t get you East of the Sun and West of the Moon, though – that’s a long way, and it’s beyond my power.  You’ll need a giant of a wind to go that far.  I’ll take you to the North Wind.  He’s the biggest and most boisterous of us all.”
Granger listened to him carefully.  “That makes perfect sense,” she said.  “We should have been thinking about how environmental crises affect magic.  Have you filed a report?”
“I don’t think that net’s safe,” Draco said, breath coming a little quickly.  “You’d better come under mine.”
Harry didn’t know, so he used a wandless Jelly-Fingers curse to break the Kraken’s grip. It worked too well, as Draco lost his hold too, but Harry managed to clamber back into the boat and grab him around the waist. As the Kraken began to knock against the boat, Harry put all his determination and deliberation into a destination he couldn’t picture, but felt with all the force of his heart: “Home.”
They’re not sure it’s you.  Somehow they have doubts.  As if anyone else would wear those hideous specs.  So now they’re asking me.  Damn you Potter.
“Er, we should be going.  Mr Malfoy, Mrs Malfoy.”  Harry grasped Draco’s elbow, but Draco stayed frozen.  Harry put a hand on the small of Draco’s back and left it there.  After a long moment he felt Draco relax just slightly against his hand. Harry drew him toward the door.
He raised his chin and looked back at Harry.  “I didn’t know… I didn’t realize how Dobby felt about our family until he returned to help you escape.  It was rather a shock.  So when I inherited Wuffley….  He is a free boat-elf now. He chooses to stay with the boat, as a proud descendant of Wufflina I and inheritor of her magic.”
“I’m supposed to kill you,” Draco said.  “The Dark Lord ordered me to.  I had a plan.  It might have worked, but…”  He gestured at his wheelchair
All of his insect repellant was back up in his dorm room, and he was really sleepy.  He looked over at the other bed.  The net there had looked fine, and presumably Draco Malfoy would not have put up with a holey mosquito net.  What would it hurt, really, if he just lay down there for a few minutes?  He could get up before Malfoy came back.
There was a slight shifting sound behind them. Malfoy, who had been leaning in the doorway, said a brief goodbye and lifted his hand in farewell. Teddy ran to hug him and Malfoy gave the child a warm smile, then turned and walked out.
The biscuits were good, a little spicier and not as sweet as Harry was used to, and the tea seemed especially fragrant.  He wondered how kissing Malfoy would be, with the taste of tea and biscuits in their mouths.  It was not a helpful thought.
Draco paused to think that through.  “Is that where the Snatchers found you?  The Forest of Dean?” he asked quietly.
They clambered up onto an enormous bed, peeling off clothes and tossing them away, and dove at other.  It didn’t take much the first time – a few strokes and tugs of Draco’s hand on Harry’s silky hard shaft, the astonishing warmth of Harry’s mouth sucking Draco down.  They flopped back on the bed, sticky and elated, gasping.
When he arrived at the front gates of the Manor Draco could hear the screeching of angry birds mixed with Potter’s shouted spells.  He hurried through the unlocked gates and waded through the weeds.
He walked through the Hogwarts gates, but before he reached the path into the forest, he saw someone coming out of the greenhouses and moving in the direction of Hagrid’s hut.  Draco found himself walking toward Neville Longbottom.
Harry and Draco arrived together, late. No one took much notice of them at first. Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, and Harry could see the tension on his face. Impulsively he turned to give Draco a quick kiss, which turned into a longer kiss. When they finally pulled away, they faced a sea of astonished faces.
“I wish I could talk with you.  My name is Draco Malfoy, I am a Centaur Liaison, and I would love to know if there is any way I could assist you.”
, yet another humiliation.  His mother was awaiting him downstairs; she seemed to have a difficult time looking at him.  They took a carriage to the gates of Hogwarts, and then she used Side-Along Apparition to bring him to St Mungo’s.
“The Anglia’s still in there?” Weasley said.  “That’s brilliant!  We flew that car here, second year, Harry and I.  Best thing we could have done, turns out.  Worth the Howler from Mum.”
“Why don’t you boys go for a walk then? And stop distracting me while I’m working out how to beat Weasley?”
Draco, shaking, turned his head to give Harry a desperate kiss.  Then Harry was kissing him fiercely, nipping, pressing Draco back against a wall.  Suddenly he couldn’t get close enough.  Draco grabbed his arse and arched into his body, baring his neck to Harry’s mouth and gasping his name.  “You in me or me in you,” Harry rasped, sinking to his knees and nuzzling Draco’s groin, pulling at his clothes.
Light was already fading from the sky; winter afternoons were short. Coloured lights twinkled in the distance. “Look, there’s a Christmas Market!” Harry said. Suddenly he was hungry. “Want to get something to eat? I’ve got some Muggle money on me.”
“Maybe they can stay with Wuffley.  We can fly out there, we’ll just need some spells to prevent people from noticing the brooms.”
“I can’t help you there, Parkinson.” Ron stretched and grinned. “But if you need someone new to beat
“They must train post owls in the countryside somewhere,” Harry added.  “Maybe Gabriel grew up nearby, and they’re old friends reunited.”
Malfoy had come out of the war subdued, with a remorse and an abhorrence of Dark magic that Harry believed were genuine. For a while Draco had mostly kept to himself, but his friends had stuck by him. Gradually their generation had begun mending rifts and making friendships across old divides, and Harry would find himself at gatherings where Malfoy was too. He’d seen flashes of humour and intelligence and thoughtfulness that made him wonder if they might have become friends, if they’d met in another time and place. But with so much fraught history between them—he didn’t see how they could get past it.
“Well, I couldn’t abide you, but that doesn’t mean I wanted you dead.  And you seemed to have the best chance of defeating that madman, why I don’t know.  You and that crazy luck of yours.  I don’t
“Hello, Hagrid,” said the South Wind.  “This is Harry Potter.  He needs to rescue his friend who’s being held in the castle East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and no one but you is strong enough to get him there.”
“Awk!”  A throaty gurgling croak interrupted them and a raven flew from some dark corner of the bookshop to land on Padma’s shoulder.
Draco shrugged.  Going roofless for a few days in the spring was a relatively minor matter, he thought.  In comparison to living under a roof shared with Bellatrix, Fenrir, Nagini, assorted other Death-Eaters, and the Dark Lord himself.
But Harry didn’t know that, apparently, and was looking awestruck.  “Draco,” he whispered, his hand hovering above Draco’s cock, and then he stroked it slowly.  Draco knew he stroked it, because he could see him.  Harry turned a hopeful face to him.
She must have spread the word, as more requests followed, from people of all ages. It appeared he had a business, which grew with no effort on his part.  The ‘Send Harry Some Love’ campaign was in full swing, and lots of people were prepared to outsource their poem-writing and not very picky about the results.  Draco dashed a few off each morning.  It gave Rutherford some exercise, and didn’t tax Draco much.
They reached the little front gate in the reed fence surrounding Harry’s small mud-brick house, and he thanked the students as he and Draco entered his bare dirt yard.  By the time he’d gotten the old-fashioned key to turn in the lock, Kili had turned up, meowing loudly in welcome, and he had to scoop her up for a moment to give her a proper greeting.  The sun was sinking.  “You can see the sun set behind the peak from the back door,” he told Draco.  “Oh – I’m low on drinking water – excuse me, I should run to the borehole before the light is gone.  I’ll just be a few minutes.”
“What are you…?” Draco spluttered – or at least someone who sounded like Draco.  “Let’s see how you like being man-handled in bed, Potter.”  And then his hands – they definitely felt like hands, not paws – were running over Harry’s body, and it felt so unexpectedly good that Harry laughed in delight.
Malfoy gave him an appraising look.  “Give a bean.  What does that remind me of…  Chaucer!  He’s always saying someone doesn’t care a bean.  Potter, you’re reading Chaucer!  For me!”
Memory swirls again and Lily is walking through the Forbidden Forest with Harry.  James and Sirius and Remus are with them, they are all there to keep his courage up as he goes to meet his death, death that they have met already. Harry is so brave, and she tells him so, and they gaze at each other.  “Stay close to me,” he tells her, and she does.
The white bear returned the following Thursday morning.  It ignored Harry’s aunt and uncle entirely and just looked at Harry.  He looked back into its clear grey eyes.
When he touched the bell it rang softly, the dishes disappeared from the table, and Harry noticed a door he hadn’t seen before.  He passed through it and saw many splendid rooms with no one in them. Finally another door swung open and there was a silver tub, just the right size and full of hot water and soapy bubbles.
Harry shrugged his own cloak on and slung a scarf around his neck.  “Come on, you,” he said, handing Draco the package to hold and wrapping an arm around his waist. They both gripped the Portkey and activated it.
“Hello Harry, sure!  I was just talking Quidditch and Russian dragons with… sorry, I didn’t get your name? I’m Charlie Weasley, by the way.”
He flicked the crumpled biscuit wrapper back at Malfoy’s face.  It had all been simpler back on the Quidditch pitch. “God, I miss flying,” he sighed.  “Let’s go find some lunch.”
Andromeda, like Draco, was a constellation in her own right.  She had made good her escape, linked up with Pegasus, the flying horse.  Only a few of her stars were visible yet above the horizon.  If he waited, she would wheel more fully into view.
Business slacked off a bit, but Draco was still sending a verse every week or so.  Potter couldn’t prove he was the author, Draco reasoned, and in any case there was no law against bad poetry.
Draco certainly understood that.  Deeply grateful though he was that the Dark Lord was gone, he wasn’t about to court rejection by attending a ball celebrating that victory.  Just as he could never bring himself to dance around the Beltane bonfires, so near the anniversary of his brush with Fiendfyre.
Still frowning, Draco reached for the bedside table, pulled a clean handkerchief from a drawer, wet it with water from a glass at the bedside, and pressed it to Potter’s scar.  There was a sizzle and hiss of steam.
Just then there was a loud thud from the roof, followed by a series of crashes.  Both of them were at the window with their wands out in an instant.  Roof slates were laying cracked on the ground, squashing a flowerbed.
“Follow me. The canal’s near here, but it doesn’t look like much,” Malfoy said.  “There were a lot of canals around Wiltshire once.  Not just the Kennet & Avon, which has been restored, but the Wilts & Berks, the North Wilts, the Thames & Severn…  But they fell into disrepair when the railways came in, so a lot of the old inland waterway network can’t be used by Muggles nowadays.  Wuffley can still navigate them, though.”
Had Malfoy been hoping that was why Harry was here?  “I’m sorry – I haven’t had a chance to dig out your old wand yet.  Can you, er, get by for a bit longer without it?”
“Since you come bearing strawberries, you may enter,” Malfoy said, plucking the little basket from Harry’s hands.
The infant in Harry’s arms whimpers again.  Lily softens as she looks.  An innocent child.  And Harry has survived it all, the abuse and neglect and the Dark Lord’s curses.  Lived to love, and let others live and love.
But on Friday Potter said, “No classes tomorrow.  Do you want to use the – er – stuff tonight?” and Draco had quickly agreed.  This time they were both more relaxed, and rolled around on the bed together finding where each other most liked to be touched.  Draco discovered the joys of having his earlobes massaged, and he got Harry to come with a hand-job again.  But Harry still went back to his bed afterwards.
Malfoy looked elated. “I thought you were daft to want to fish so close to the Kraken’s waters, Harry, but it’s true, the fish are shoaling here—look at them all!”  He shot a jubilant smile at Harry, who wondered dumbly what reality he’d been dropped into. And what a kraken was.
The bear flicked its stump of a tail.  Gold coins appeared from nowhere and clattered to the floor in heaps.
“It was an ignorant boy who did that to you,” Harry whispered.  “Who regretted it as soon as he’d done it.”  He laid his fingertips gently against Draco’s skin.
Draco gave the slightest of nods and moved on, keeping his face a mask while inwardly he swore.  Everyone at the department knew that the centaurs had always refused to have anything to do with the Ministry.  “Being sent to the Centaur Liaison Office” was an in-joke.  It meant the person was about to be fired, and whether or not Draco liked his job, he needed it.
Actually, Old Timer always seemed to know how to find Draco. “Oh, well he… well we… well.” Draco gave up on finding words for how they were, and handed Old Timer a biscuit. A soft one, because of his teeth. Old Timer thumped his tail against Draco’s leg.
, but that’s not very useful.”  Draco considered, tilting his head and pursing his lips  “It would have to be a near rhyme.
“What, is my brave boyfriend getting bashful?” Draco sounded amused. “We might as well warm up in bed. Can’t go out fishing again until the good ship
He was always stealing glances at one, muttering. And wherever Draco went, looking for a peaceful spot amidst the Hogwarts reconstruction, Potter turned up.  Didn’t talk, just lurked.
“I can still see it.  I mean, you calm me down.  After you annoy me, that is.  And I am known for a stinging wit.”
“I agree, but no one knows how to remove it, and it’s rather dangerous to try.  He took that secret to his grave.”
Disgruntled, Harry followed Malfoy a little way off. He handed over the wand. “You have to admit it was a reasonable mistake…”
“You’re going to stand up straight and I’ll let go, then we won’t have to talk about this again, right?”
Draco snorted.  Really, Potter was being quite rude to his admirers, although his verse wasn’t any worse than the ones Draco had been sending.  Draco hadn’t actually expected Potter to read them, though.
“Oh, it’s a game,” Harry thought, and swam after him.  He caught the man around his slim waist, pulling him close, wrapping his arms around him to keep him from wriggling away.  They were both naked, their legs twining together as they spun easy and weightless in the water, laughing, floating up into brightness, the other man’s hands stroking up and down Harry’s backside, twisting into his hair, pulling him into a kiss. Their bodies now hungry for each other, they slid together in a rhythm that grew faster and more demanding, pressing and moving against each other with delirious urgency, his lover’s face pulling back for a moment to shake fine blond hair out of grey eyes before closing in again with a kiss of such sweet heat that it pulled a hot spurt of climax from Harry as he clung to this one human anchor in a bright whirling world.
There was no point correcting Harry again on who had really saved the day. “You composed that,” Draco said, awed.
It would have been awkward to refuse. But it was at least as awkward to sit there next to Potter with nothing to say, while Weasley and Granger were absorbed in talking something over.
“We’ve never talked about the war, Harry.”  Draco looked much too sombre again.  “I don’t know, sometimes, how you can be with me.”
Draco climbed the stairs toward the Owlery one Wednesday evening. He might not manage to argue with Father to his face, but he could send a letter.
So Draco let himself be persuaded, and Potter was actually right; it was a bit like balancing on a broom, and it was fun.  But odd, because there was no vertical motion. It made Draco want to go flying.
So much potential in these two young men. If they could only work together instead of being at loggerheads!  Salazar and Godric were best friends, once.  If we could emphasize cooperation rather than divisions, as I tried to tell everyone a few years ago?
He walked a long way until he came to a freckled red-haired laddie about his own age, sitting by himself playing chess.
He crossed the street to meet Ron and Hermione, who Harry hadn’t noticed coming from the other direction.  As Harry watched dumbfounded, Draco bowed slightly to them both, took a deep breath, and began to sing.
It turned out to be a small plant with pale green leaves and a cluster of star-shaped reddish blossoms with a faint scent.  Puzzled, Draco looked at Potter, who shrugged.  “He just said it’s called centaury.”
Draco smiled back at him, and Harry pulled him in for more kissing.  Draco’s warm hands moved over his back, cupped his arse, pulled him closer so Harry could feel their erections press together.  Harry shivered.  It was so different to make love with another man - the feel of Draco’s hard chest and hard cock against his, the male smell of him.  But familiar, also – Harry knew a man’s body, he lived in one.
“It seems lycanthropy is more complicated than we once thought, or perhaps the disease altered its form. Now that there are efforts to lessen the stigma against those who have been bitten by werewolves, whether in wolf form or not, those people have been sharing their experiences. Bill Weasley used to joke that he had developed a fondness for rare steaks, but it was a bit more than that. And though we didn’t think any problems that Remus had would be hereditary, Teddy did use to get a bit agitated when the moon was full.”
And the great black cabinet, big enough for a person to stand in.  Did Draco hear something inside?  He reached for the handle.
She had eyes only for Draco, and Harry could see the love that shone there, though her voice and movements were composed. “Draco.  So good to see you my dear.”
Harry made his way back towards the table. Padma and a younger witch Harry didn’t know were discussing veganism. “I think it’s admirable from the principle of non-violence,
Inside, after a good Hot-Air Charm, Draco put on tea. “So, the star of Defense Against the Dark Arts is not so strong at Defense Against the Dark Clouds. How can you camp with such a fragile Umbrella Charm, Potter?”
She sees him walk into the circle of Death Eaters, she hears dear faithful Hagrid struggle to help him, she sees Voldemort cast the killing curse, and then Harry falls.  Falls into some in-between place she cannot reach, as if the Veil is a waterfall in front of a cave, and he is standing under the spray, neither on one side nor the other.
strange, Potter.  Strange is how things are.  And it’s not like there’s anything normal in us having a civil conversation.”
Suddenly it was too much, and he had to leave.  Harry gave Malfoy a skittery smile and said “I’d best be off.”’ He took a last look at Malfoy standing in the meadow, hand raised in farewell, a breeze playing in his fair hair.  Then Harry Apparated, still tingling.
“Well if you’re trying to get a rise out of me, it won’t work!”  Potter’s eyes sparked dangerously, belying his words.
Draco glanced at his friend, who was sprawled out on Draco’s couch with his feet up, reading.  A toe was poking out of one sock.
“Draco,” Draco said, and saw the man’s eyes crinkle with an easy smile. “Draco Malfoy,” he added somewhat reluctantly.
Harry bent, now, to take Draco into his mouth.  Draco knew the feel of that warm wet mouth sucking his fingers, sucking his earlobes, and tried to imagine he could feel it now.  Harry’s warm hands on his sides were still in his range of feeling.  Draco reached his own hands out to touch the wild softness of Harry’s black hair and feel the rhythm of Harry’s head as he moved up and down.  The sight of Harry’s mouth around his cock, the look of tender absorption on Harry’s face, were doing something queer to Draco’s heart.
They were supposed to ‘talk to heal the wounds of the past’.  Harry faced Draco Malfoy.  Reconciliation?  Not likely.  He crossed his arms.  “Any suggestions on where to begin, Malfoy?”
“You do not own an ugly shirt, Draco Malfoy.  And even if it were, all the more reason to take it off.”
“You know how Kneazles have tufted tails like lions do?  I just don’t think it would look right in black.”
Potter came by now and then, ostensibly to visit the Mooncalf. Perhaps he was also there to check up on Draco, but Draco refused to worry about it. He wasn’t doing anything he needed to hide. And he didn’t entirely mind the company, to be honest. Draco got letters from Pansy, whose parents had whisked her abroad after the war ended, and from his mother, but that was about all.
“I – I made him drink poison.  He might have died anyway.”  Harry pressed his eyes shut and whispered, “From what I did.”
Gabriel blinked at him, and then his eyelids lowered.  He tucked in his chin and settled his feathers.
The witch gave them a knowing look. “Seekers, aren’t you?  There’s a reason we don’t allow wizards to fly in the sanctuary.  Despite the best intentions, your instincts will kick in and you’ll try to catch the Snitch, forgetting that it’s a live bird that could be crushed in your hand.”
“Who’s going to give me a massage here?” Draco asked. He didn’t fancy having Madame Pomfrey doing that, and he’d be embarrassed to be so helpless before his friends.  Baines just shrugged.
“Hello,” said Harry.  “I’m looking for the castle that lies East of the Sun and West of the Moon.  Do you know the way?  I need to get there before the prince marries the troll princess with a nose three ells long.”
“Could be.”  Draco beamed a brilliant smile at him, his bright hair in disarray round his head, his eyes full of light.  “I hear his new boyfriend is very sweet.”  He spread his legs welcomingly.
“Heresy!” Draco said, seizing another chocolate, but this time Harry plucked it away from him to stuff into Draco’s mouth.
“Unlike yourself?  Now if you’ll excuse me.”  Draco took back his letter, turned and headed down the path for the forest.
Harry turned toward the newcomer and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy. Malfoy started, sloshing the liquid that hissed in a goblet.
“Fern!” Draco called, alarmed.  If this was a post-owl, it was illegal to interfere with it; if it was a wild owl, might it hunt his cat?
“Oh, I’m not harassed as much these days, so it’s easier to go out,” Potter said.  “People seem to have moved on.  New generation of heroes now.”
The sacred mountain was a fair distance away, but it was unmistakeable, and indeed full of kitsune. They were foxes carved in stone, facing each other in pairs, looking alert, confident and bushy tailed.  Each pair was unique, and each fox was nattily dressed in a scarlet cloth bib tied around the neck.  They guarded the entrance and watched over scores of little altars all the way up the mountain.  Some carried round balls or keys in their mouths and some, Rutherford was delighted to discover, carried scrolls.
Snape and Dumbledore arrived with Potter.  “Draco, I’m glad to see you alert,” Dumbledore said calmly, then cast
“It was horrible, but we got – we did something important.  But Dumbledore seems really sick.  What were you doing up here?”
They bade good-bye to the East Wind, and then the West Wind carried Harry a long long way, until they felt the hot breath of the South blowing towards them.
Other customers came in, shaking off snow and stamping their feet, and Harry was busy for a while.  When he looked over, Malfoy was packing up his things.  He left money on the table, more than enough, and headed for the door.  As he opened it to leave, he looked back over his shoulder with a look Harry couldn’t read.  Harry moved his hand in something that might have been farewell –  or might have been just reaching for a towel to wipe the counter.  He wasn’t sure himself.
It had become almost a ritual. Draco would climb the stairs to the Owlery with a letter to his father, pause irresolute, sigh, Vanish the letter, gaze out the window and tell himself that next time he would send it. Next time, when he’d found the perfect words. Meanwhile it was peaceful in the Owlery and the owls didn’t seem to mind.
