“I don’t care with whom you share your broomstick, Potter, as long as you don’t get knocked off it again this year.”
“You can’t,” Draco said, the last traces of polyjuice wearing off. Rose looking up at her other beloved uncle in happy surprise.
A shudder ran through the room. A prank from the twins was always fun until you were the one covered in puss or had half of your eyebrows shorn off in the name of humor. Some Gryffindors reached up to their own eyebrows reflexively as if to make sure that they hadn’t fallen out while Fred was talking.
But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around Harry’s neck. They were forcing his face upward. He could feel its breath….His mother was screaming in his ears….She was going to be the last thing he ever heard…..
“Are you mad, Potter?” she asked. “You already have detention and you want to go running around the school at night? You’ll lose more than just your place here, but a whole lot of Slytherin’s house points. Draco really should
Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was also Hufflepuff’s seeker and Captain. After everyone said, “Hi,” Amos Diggory asked good naturedly, “All these yours then, Arthur?”
Harry’s throat tightened. He wanted that too. He wanted what Sirius had offered him. He wanted to be with him and Remus, to be a family. He wanted for the first time in his life to have a home with people who loved and wanted him. He wanted to eat dinner with his family and hear stories about his mom and dad. He wanted to be close to them in a way that he had never felt around his blood relatives.
Harry was drenched in sweat. Flint had put them through the gauntlet at practice, and Harry was feeling the “weakness leave his body” with every step he took. The locker rooms under the stands weren’t house oriented but Hogwarts oriented. No gaudy colors merely the house symbols. The badger, snake, lion, and eagle emblems were emblazoned on the marble locker room doors and all over the locker room walls. Harry stared at one as he stepped into the shower. The marble emblem blinked back at him as he stepped under the spray. The showers were toward the back of the locker room, before that was the changing/pep talk area. The girl’s area was to the left of the doors which had their own changing and shower areas. One of the locker rooms were under the Ravenclaw stands, and the other was under the stands right beside of it, so it made for a more dramatic entrance when they stepped onto the field, Harry thought.
He meant his mark, he knew he did. Draco stood. He wasn’t going to let Harry bully him into an argument. He couldn’t see his mark no matter what. He stepped forward. Draco moved back. And things changed.
“Oh, yes,” said Winky, nodding her head furiously. She looked angry. “My master is telling Winky some things, but Winky is not…no she is keeping her master’s secrets..,” she said fiercely before dissolving into tears once again.
“But we’ll be smart,” added Millicent. “There will be no barging around and knocking things over like the Gryffindors do, you heard what McGonagall said as well as we did. Black is smart, one of the cleverest boys in their year, and that means that we have to use all the cunning we can to catch him.”
“I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said Hagrid, sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious.
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” Dumbledore gave a warning look over the hall.
Marcus, too, seemed pleased when Gryffindor got a point, though Harry was sure no one could tell but him. He was sitting so close to the seventh year and his Captain that he could see the slight upturn of his mouth when Wood managed to block a goal.
“He didn’t mean it,” Blaise said easily. “He was just trying to shock you Potter. Draco and I have been friends since we were children. We all have really, and believe it or not that was my warning not your invitation.”
“What is this?” She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. The moment she started to struggle was the moment the plant started to twist, snakelike tendrils pulled around her ankles. All of their legs and hands had
want it is that sometimes you choose wrong, and humans do have a knack for choosing precisely those thing that are wrong for them.”
It was agony such as he had never felt in all his life, his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head was about to split open. Then maybe it would be over.
“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed ---or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to bed.”
“But Professor Dumbledore said we could call him….” Dobby stopped, appearing nervous. “He said we is free to call him….a barmy old codger if we likes sir! But Dobby is not wanting to Harry Potter, sir. Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him.”
Harry got to his feet and peered around a tree. He was about to ask, “Who’s there?” when without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked shout, but what sounded like a spell and a battle cry.
Peeves didn’t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; then he wiggled his curly toed feet and broke into song. “Loony, Loopy, Lupin,” Peeves sang. “Loony, Loopy, Lupin.” And unmanageable as he almost always way Peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this, to their surprise, he was still smiling.
“Loo,” Draco answered succinctly. Harry nodded and Draco could feel his eyes on him as he walked away. After using the toilet, Draco fell into a conversation with Angelina.
Whatever more Professor McGonagall was going to say halted. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t bother to magic them back up.
“The lights are going out now!” Percy shouted. “I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking.”
“Everyone, this is Ludo Bagman, you know who he is. He’s the one we’ve to thank for getting us such good tickets….”
“She did, and I think we should hear what she has to say for herself.” Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, “Rennervate!”
“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder as she read it. It was a riddle.
Blaise laughed, his hair still perfectly in place. Darn him. Harry was sure his own hair looked like he had just been through a rather violent windstorm, like it always looked like when he woke.
Harry had been traveling with Sirius and Remus all summer. With the Black family fortune at their disposal, they had traveled to places Harry never thought he would get to go, France, Milan, Switzerland, Belgium, even Norway. Honestly, it was a dream come true. And the best part wasn't even the travel, it was spending time with Sirius and Remus. The two were so incredibly in love and truly happy. It was something Harry had never experienced before. Harry had always been on the outside of the perfect family, present but not included, whether with the Dursleys or even at the Burrow. Here, for the first time in his life, Harry felt essential to the happiness of others. It didn’t matter if they were never in any one place for more than a week, Harry felt like he was home.
“If I find that you have besmirched our house in any way you will face consequences, and I do not mean a loss in house points.”
“Care to play, Potter,” Millicent Bulstrode asked him as he walked into the common room. “My hands getting a little sore having spanked Blaise so often.”
“You wish,” Harry said, running toward the champion’s tent before Draco could pull him into a dance. Harry could hear the sound of the other boy’s laughter even after he went inside.
“That’s disgusting,” said Harry. “Don’t talk about Millicent like that, she’s a better witch and a better person than you’ll ever be. Prettier, too.”
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.”
“Next, we need to discuss first year assignments. Coral will be coming by shortly to hand them out.”
Harry looked at him. Lupin’s eyes were twinkling. “How did you know about that?” Harry asked. “Professor McGonagall told me,” said Lupin. “She’s…uh…not to pleased with….well, you’re not worried, are you?”
There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. Potions ingredients and he had to stop off by Madam Malkins to get some new school robes, since his were now several inches to short. Next, Harry had to get his school books. He would be starting Divination and Care of Magical Creatures this year, and didn’t quite know how he felt about the extra classes.
“Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backwards in alarm. “There’s a boggart in there.”
“Now, that’s more like it!” growled Moody’s voice and suddenly Harry felt the empty feeling in his head vanish.
Harry knew they were all thinking the same thing. If Snape had a hand in protecting the Stone then he must know about the other teacher’s enchantments, and the only thing keeping him out now was Fluffy and Quirrell’s
“Mad? Malfoy?” Marcus Flint, the prefect sitting beside Harry said. “He’s your headmaster, and he deserves your respect.” It was gruff and it was final. Draco turned away, latching onto another conversation closer to his
“I was close enough that night to hear what Harry was saying. I saw, we all saw Crouch Junior attack Harry Potter so that he would stay silent, but I will not stay silent. This unruly, mouthy fourth year didn’t kill anyone. The Dark Lord killed the boy I love, and I won’t let anyone taint him with lies.”
And just like that the banners in the Great Hall changed from Green to Blue. “After you, Mr. Potter,” said Snape and defiantly Harry walked in the hall.
“Because,” said Harry moving closer so that his hand brushed Dracos. “Maybe I think it’s time I started calling you Draco instead of Malfoy.”
When Draco opened the door, Harry was standing there waiting for him. Draco moved instantly into Harry’s open arms, and kissed the other man the way that he always imagined that he would. And Harry kissed him back like he would never get the opportunity to do so again. Harry had not looked to see if Draco’s mark truly was gone. He didn’t care. He had him back. He was safe. And he was in his arms. Harry didn’t need a mark on his body to tell him that Draco was his because he had one on his heart.
Harry, ignoring the wand too close to his face, reached for his bag, but in a move that reminded Harry that Remus was, in fact, once his professor, Remus had the bag flying out of his reach before Harry could even touch it.
Harry didn’t bother looking at the Malfoy heir. He could always sense when Draco was near. And the two had decided before Draco left the hospital the other day, that neither of them would discuss Draco’s involvement in Harry’s rescue. If Draco wanted to help Harry then Harry had a role he could fill. Spy.
Wizard after wizard was unmasked. MacNair, Buckbeak’s would be executioner. His dormmate’s and classmate’s fathers. Did they know as little about their sons as they knew about them? Did Vincent’s father know that he had a long standing crush on Tracey Davis and that he was such a good dancer that even Pansy had stolen him for a dance at the Yule Ball? Did Greg’s dad know that he slept with his curtains open and he wrote a letter to his mother every Sunday and that he was as big of a Cannon’s fan as Ron was? Did Nott’s dad have any clue how much his son had admired his old Defense professor who happened to be a werewolf? And did Malfoy’s father know just how much he had helped his Lord’s enemy this year? That his son had cheered for him in the stands? That he had snuck out with him and that they had shared the prefect’s bathroom to solve the riddle for the second task?  That he helped him solve and train for the tasks, or how strongly he smells like mint after a shower?
“So,” said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again, cowering at his feet. “You found this wand, eh, elf? And you picked it up and thought you’d have some fun with it, did you?”
“I’ll owl you when I have any more information,” Draco said, then left. The tingling feeling remained long after Harry was out of sight.
“I’m not blamin’ yeh,” said Hagrid, waving Harry’s apology aside. “I just though’ you two valued friendship more’n that.”
George and Angelina had offered to go to the cafeteria and get snacks for the group. Harry had refused to move from his spot closest to the doors his future goddaughter or godson would be carried out of.
know better, but since you seem to have marginally more sense you should back out while you still have a chance?”
After some cursory checks, the nurse got out the clipboard and began to ask Draco questions. Potions taken in the last twenty four hours? Ongoing medicines? Physical activity per week?
Flint led them down a set of stairs, then another, then another. The air getting increasingly colder, the further they went into the underground of the castle.
“Maybe soon the Ministry will pull their heads out of their arses and allow people to marry whoever the heck they want. Two men. A werewolf.”
gets tough? Millicent has the family name, but I’ve got the power, and Zabini goes wherever he thinks he’ll find the most advantage.”
“Perhaps Amos is suggesting,” said Mr. Crouch, cold anger in every syllable. “that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark?”
Flint reached over and shook Wood’s hand, leaning into whisper something to the boy before pulling back. The look on Wood’s face was covered in shock, but he quickly wiped it away when Madam Hooch blew her first whistle.
“Amos, be careful!” said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. When he appeared once again, he was dragging something or someone along with him.
Draco didn’t promise much, but he did promise to keep his ears open for any indication about who had beaten Harry. Harry could tell that the incident had gotten to Draco. While Harry was used to certain amounts of physical altercations, Draco as well as the rest of the pureblood population were unused to using their fists to solve problems. Draco probably would have been less fazed if Harry’s attackers had cursed him with a volley of hexes rather than punches.
“Not like that, but…” Draco stuttered. “It’s just your face really, and you can’t be faulted for that.”
Blaise sent him a look, but they all did what he asked. After the roll call and a disturbing once over by Moody’s magical eye he said, “Right then. I’ve received a letter from Professor Lupin and are aware that you have had quite the grounding on dark creatures. But you’re behind…quite behind on dealing with curses. I’m here to bring you up to scratch about what wizards can do to each other.”
After the Minister of Magic and the aurors had left with Pettigrew. Snape nodded stiffly at Dumbledore then left without a word. Professor McGonagall left, too, after telling Harry that even though he had helped save an innocent man of a most cruel fate and had finally corrected an over a decade long mistake that he was still a student and thus, needed to be in bed. Soon. Then she left him with Remus and Dumbledore.
The trial was over. They had won, but the look on Fudge’s face assured Harry that he would not forget this anytime soon. Don’t worry, Minister, Harry thought, I won’t forget this either. Harry smirked maliciously in the man’s direction. Sirius bumped into Lucius Malfoy as one was leaving the courtroom and the other was rushing in. Sirius barely noticed the blonde man as he rushed to get to Harry’s side. Harry was immediately swept up into his arms. Remus soon followed, his arms going around both Sirius and Harry, a low growl echoing in his throat. Harry didn’t often see evidence of the wolf, but the closeness they had all shared this summer and the obvious stress of the past few days had brought out the man’s baser instincts to protect and care for the members of his pack. Harry didn’t mind though. Being held so tight by the two men in the middle of a conquered courtroom made Harry feel truly safe for the first time since he witnessed the black cloak of a dementor being pushed back by the combined light of a wolf, a dog, and a stag.
“You sound like this has happened to you before,” Harry asked. But Blaise was too distraught to talk about it.
“That ball,” he pointed up at the other players. “is the Quaffle. The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.”
But what they were they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned toward the portrait hole only to find an empty painting. It’s subject having moved on, leaving Hermione locked out of Gryffindor tower.
Millicent had them patiently explained that no Pansy had no interest McGonagall, but that she did seem to have a vested interest in Mudblood Granger.
The two men were flown against the wall and exhaustion took over Draco’s mind and body as he knew that he could finally close his eyes because he was safe, because Harry was here, and Harry would never let anything happen to him.
“I need….see…Dumbledore…I’ve done….stupid..thing….Must tell….D….” Crouch muttered something about “escaped……must warn…..my fault….Bertha…dead…Dumbledore…Harry Potter….the Dark Lord…stronger…Harry…”
“Wood,” Harry interrupted. “will be happy as long as you do your best. You’re a great flier, Seamus, and besides it’s just Hufflepuff.”
The next package was from Ron’s mother, Mrs. Weasley. He had also attached a note: I told my mum that you didn’t expect any presents this year. Sorry, but those muggles of you really are quite awful. Every year she makes us a
What had turned out to be a friendly couple of beers with a mate had quickly turned into talk of a seedier sort. Harry had just been thrust together with Malfoy into a new partnership that neither of them were sure that they wanted, and not only that, but he and Ginny had finally called an end to their quite frankly platonic relationship. Harry had resorted to kissing her forehead before it was all over and done with. Ginny said that if he had kissed her on the forehead one more time than he never would have been able to get the bogeys out of his nose.
Millicent laughed. “I have a feeling this won’t be the last time you ask yourself that question Weasley.”
Harry spoke the password to the common room. The Welcoming Feast at Hogwarts never disappointed. Harry had indulged in all of his favorites, and now he was feeling a little worse for wear. The Great Hall was loud and the students were boisterous. The new students were sorted, and Slytherin received quite a few first years.
“I envy that you have that, but I also despise you because all that love seems to have been wasted.”
how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness—this was his chance to settle things with Malfoy face to face. He couldn’t miss it.
When the rest of the team had moved out of the conference room, Draco was forced to take a seat on the other side of Kingsley right in front of Harry.
“What Granger?” Blaise said, messing with her. Everyone knew Eloise Midgen was a rather heavy set Gryffindor third year who had acne and what Ron had called an off centered nose. Everyone also knew that Blaise Zabini was the both the textbook definitions of beautiful and charming.
“I didn’t actually,” Harry said finally. “I don’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it there.”
So he didn’t think of what he would have done if things were different, how he would have pulled Harry’s sleep clothes from his body, how he would have gently pressed his hips against the man he loved and how Harry would be just as eager for him. He didn’t envision smooth touches or slow kisses, not even the warm glow that would fill Harry’s eyes. No, he didn’t think about making love to Harry at all.
“That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,” said Hermione, slipping the small red bottle into Ron’s hand. “And stop worrying, Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what’s the problem. Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he’d been in there for ages; no one wanted him.”
“Worried about the lack of wand work, Weasley,” said Finnegan under his breath. He pointedly looked at Hermione who blessedly had all of her attention on their subpar syllabus.
Harry tried to ask Lupin what was going on but it seemed as if Lupin was figuring out a lot of things all on his own. Then Lupin leaned over and helped Black get to his feet, and embraced him like a brother? No, like someone he thought he had lost, but had suddenly found again.
The whistle sounded, Harry pulled the handful of gillyweed from his pocket, toasted Dobby, stuffed it in his mouth, and jumped into the lake.
We are all facing dark and dangerous times. Some of you in this Hall have already been directly affected by the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asunder, and not one week ago, a student was taken from us.”
“No,” scoffed Harry, “but I’m pretty sure that we can assume why they did it. It’s not much of a secret that I’m public enemy number one.”
But it was too late. Snape saw me at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was…”
“No,” Draco argued. “You do the bare minimum. You come here with your pretty face, and celebrity status, and you throw your money at this place,”
And it felt then, like everything had set itself to rights. His clothes were dry. He had never fought to breathe. He had never struggled against unspeakable monsters. Because Draco was here, and he had protected him. And he knew that he would fight any and every monster for the man beside hi….
“Well---yeah---how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bi’ of music an’ he’ll go straight ter sleep---.”
“Dumbledore,” said Moody. “wants you taught what it feels like. However, if any of you feel that this particular lesson goes against your delicate sensibilities then you are excused.” 	Delicate sensibilities? Every Slytherin in the room, even the ones that looked a bit iffy, were now staring at Moody steadily. They knew a challenge when they heard one. And they couldn’t back down now.
I know that I am always looking for great fics, so I thought I would drop some recommendations here.
Harry felt his face redden. This was different than when Colin asked for an autograph or when Mr. Diggory and countless others had asked if he was in fact Harry Potter, way different than that.
“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” Harry said. “You can take the Cloak, I won’t need it now.”
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his relatives smiling happily. Harry sank down on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying all night if he wanted too. Nothing at all.
Then, there had been Sirius. And Sirius and Remus had loved him like he was their own, but then one after the other they were taken from him. Like all good things in Harry’s life, they were snatched away. He was wanted, and then he wasn’t. The child that still lived in Harry still reached out for the warmth of the love that they had offered, but the adult knew that love was gone.
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end furthest from him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him a shaky smile. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
Voldemort had come for his family. No, Voldemort had come for him. The world knew that Sirius was a free man, but very few, not even the ministry, knew that Harry was no
Millicent, on the urge of toppling Hermione’s chair to the ground openly gaped at him as if he had just sprouted another head.
Last weeks update was a little longer than I intended, so this one might not be as long, but I think it's full of good stuff.
The sounds of someone stumbling from a room…. A door bursting open….a cackle of high-pitched laughter….
“Yeah,” said Harry sternly. “And is that you or your parents talking, Nott? Professor Lupin was good to you. He was good to all of us and didn’t deserve to be kicked out. Especially not by those bitter about failing in defense, considering how well they do in all their other classes.” Harry looked at Tracey Davis, who ducked her head meekly.
After conjuring his stag and sending it off with a message, Snape and Dumbledore were there, and together they quickly walked back to the woods.
“Forget it, Harry,” said George bracingly. “Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he’d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking…They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.”
His house had a ghost too. Looking down the table, he spotted a horrible ghost, with blank eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained in silver blood sitting beside Malfoy who Harry was pleased to see didn’t look to be happy about it either.
Then realizing that he was perhaps talking a bit too loudly, and that some people were now staring. George said,” But you’re right. I should have asked her when I had the chance. And now that I do, I’m going to take it.”
But Harry didn’t mind. He had just one thought in his head, which was getting back in front of the mirror, and no one was going to stop him.
Harry looked at Professor Snape who was staring along the staff table at Professor Lupin. His face was twisted in more than anger, in loathing. And Harry knew that expression to well, because it was often how Professor Snape looked at him.
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face—he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.
“Sit down,” said Lupin. “I’ve only got tea bags, I’m afraid, but I dare say you’ve had enough of tea leaves?”
Harry wasn’t ready to go to bed yet. On the train, he decided that he was going to wait until the last possible moment to go to bed. He wasn’t running afraid, but he needed some quiet before he could put the wards up on his bed, and there was no quiet in the dorm until all of the boys went to sleep.
“Because you knew that one? What did she do beat you over the head or make you go to bed without your dessert?”
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.
Blaise, Harry noticed, somehow got even more attractive since last year. His dark skin seemed to glow as if he were on a beach enjoying the sun instead of in a dungeon lounging on his canopy bed.
“If you say he’s innocent, Harry, then he is. I’ve known you for two years, and if anyone can do this, you can.”
Draco’s gut pinched painfully as he realized that Harry’s family and his would never be one in the same. It was better this way. Draco couldn’t provide for Harry. He merely scraped by on his pitiful earnings from the Ministry. And what would the Weasel have to say when he learned that Draco was even poorer than he is. Draco wasn’t sure that he could take the mockery. Weasley and Granger might put on like they have accepted Draco, but there was no way that either of them could forgive him when he could barely tolerate himself.
“They’re getting hungry. Dumbledore won’t let them into the school, so their supply of human prey has dried up. I don’t think they could resist the large crowd around the pitch. All that excitement, emotions running high….it was their idea of a feast.”
And then the thing beneath the hood, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings.
Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor. The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn’t have to ask what had happened.
Ron had wrote to him. Somehow Mr. Weasley had gotten tickets to the Quidditch World Cup, and they had invited Harry to come along. They wrote to say that someone would be along to collect him soon and the Dursleys were more than glad to get rid of him.
No one seemed to be talking to one another. Viktor Krum was standing in a corner, moody and silent. Fleur seemed to be having a silent conversation with Madame Maxime. She smiled at Harry when he entered. She looked a great deal happier than she had in Harry’s memory, perhaps the girls in her class were finally getting behind her.
“They ‘ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?” Stan said. “’Ole street blown up an’ all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ‘ad ‘appened Ern?”
“Wow,” Harry heard someone whisper. And while Professor Lupin didn’t acknowledge it, Harry saw him smirk at the impressed looks on a few of the students faces.
“Eleven sickles,” said Stan. “but for fifteen you get ‘ot chocolate, and for fifteen you get an ‘ot water bottle ‘an a toofbrush in the color of your choice.”
Wood glared at Flint, but Flint seemed unmoved by the burly seventh years expression. When Flint was done playing with poor Wood, he directed the team to the side of the pitch.
“I don’t want to hear explanations,” said Lupin shortly. He glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. “I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. “I don’t want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.”
“If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back. Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for
Teenage Malfoy had tried to best him in Quidditch, did best him at grades. He had called him every snobby nickname in the book, and had taunted him at every given opportunity. There were times when Harry had wanted to throttle him, but there were also other moments. As someone who had gotten a better grade at stalking Malfoy than he ever got in an actual class, Hermione’s words, as much as Malfoy annoyed him he also surprised him.
“Yep,” said Stan, “in front of witnesses and in broad daylight. Big trouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?”
“Thanks, but I doubt the second part,” said Harry, grinning broadly. “I saw you at the Quidditch World Cup. The Wronski Feint you reall….”
Hermione sat in their compartment on the train. She had given her Time Turner back to McGonagall. On the ride back to London, Harry got lost in his friends conversation, only stopping when he got a letter from Sirius and Remus saying that they would see him soon.
“Yeah,” said the man, brushing the underside of his nose with his forefinger. “An auror had managed to infiltrate, but the cocky arsehole underestimated us. He was too clean cut,
The last day of the holiday, Harry got up, and found an owl outside his window. He opened the letter at read it quickly. It was from Marcus Flint, Harry’s old Quidditch Captain.
“The law,” said Blaise, “needs an update. Prejudice was more prevalent decades ago then it is now. Same sex couples are allowed to live together, but not marry, the wizarding way, at least. Muggle style marriages are still valid though, as well as name changes…”
Harry was hungover, if one could count a large amount of sugar mixed with copious amounts of sparkling cider, and several, several varying degrees of wonderful renditions of Italian pop songs that Harry had never heard of before hungover. Harry had envisioned his last night at the Villa would be spent having a fine meal in the villa’s lavish dining room then later, perhaps, listening to some music on the wireless as Sirius and Remus entertained the girls, but he had not expected the wild ride that had greeted him. Madame Zabini it had turned out, and let the last night’s festivities to be planned by the twins. It was tradition Blaise had said as they walked down the stairs to the main living space.
Sirius was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at Harry’s words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.
Thank you all for reading. Here is the next installment. The credit for this work completely goes to all of you, and to Jo Rowling for creating such a masterpiece in the first place.
Harry hesitated and Pansy’s enchanted cane stalked toward him where it had been whacking Goyle’s legs because he wouldn’t move them far enough apart. He had been trying to dance with his legs shut, hoping to avoid the canes blow on that other part of his anatomy if he could.
“Then Professor Lupin stepped over you, walked to the door, and pulled out his wand. He said, “None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.’ But the dementor didn’t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away….”
“Dating Granger?” said Blaise, through his laughter. “It’d be more believable if she had said you were dating Creevey.”
“Even if they have been ordered to kill you on sight, I doubt they could get over how different you look in time to do much harm before you countered.”
“Me too,” said Fleur and a whole host of others stood by him, his friends, even people he had never talked too.
“So am I,” admitted Harry. “I thought they were going to send me Azkaban.” He looked at Ron. “Your dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?”
“Don’t worry,” Pansy whispered as the music started. “I can always buy new ones.” Then the doors opened and Harry followed one obnoxiously proud Warrington and his immaculately dressed boyfriend to his sure demise.
“I…er…I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night. I couldn’t help hearing,” Harry added quickly. “Sorry…”
“A bit of old parchment!” said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as though Harry had mortally offended him. “Explain, George.”
“Them!” said Stan contemptuously. “Don’ listen properly, do they? Don’ look properly either. Never notice nutting, they don’.”
Though it was also the place a lot of fights happened between players. Though, so far, Harry had missed those this year. Flint had been so caught up in practice and scouts that he had no time for feuds. He was even going out for evening flies. Harry would see him come back nearly every evening with his Quidditch kit soaked in sweat but a weary and determined look on his face. Some nights he even looked downright giddy.
“I want someone to share my life with, someone to sit on the couch and watch rubbish tv with. I want someone who’s funny and interesting, someone I can talk to.” He felt wrecked, desperate. He could feel tears in his eyes because he longed for this person, this entity that he wasn’t sure even existed. How could he want something that he wasn’t even sure he deserved?
“Your father didn’t set much store by the rules either,” Snape went on, his thin face full of malice. “Rules were for lesser mortals, not Quidditch cup winners.”
“Don’t you?” asked Harry. “They’re right there.” Harry pointed to the mirror, taking Blaise’s spot in front of the mirror.
“I’m the princess?” said Millicent. “Really, because out of the two of us I would say that you are the….”
There was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their glass. Professor McGonagall and the rest rose from the table, bid goodbye to Madam Rosmerta and left, but Harry barely registered it.
Flint turned at the sound of his name, a slight smile on his face as he saw Harry. Harry almost turned away. He wasn’t exactly sure that he had actually seen Flint smile before. Maybe he’s drunk, Harry thought. He wouldn’t be the first to sneak in some Fire Wiskey.
“Okay, but,” she said, reminding him strongly of the girl sitting beside her. “I want you to do something for me, too.”
Harry froze mid-step. He turned to the right and breathed a sigh of relief. It was Marcus Flint, looking rather flustered.
“Then, to Ms. Millicent Bulstrode for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Slytherin House fifty points.”
“Uck!” Tracey Davis cowed, stroking her long slick hair in worry. “Not even my no-frizz charms are strong enough to stand up against that.”
Throughout his life, Harry had woken up to quite unsettling and unusual things. Aunt Petunia in her rollers and green face cream, Percy’s bottoms on top of his face as he ran around Ron’s room chasing his Prefect’s Badge as Fred and George had enchanted it to fly away at his touch, Goyle’s bare chest every morning since he started getting chest hair, so Dobby’s big eyes almost didn’t scare him out of his seat. Almost.
“Of course, not, Potter. Complaining is for the lower classes,” said Draco Malfoy. “What we are going to do is strategize.”
“Indeed it isn't, Madam Bones, and yet, Harry Potter, a highly popular and publicized member of this community, even before his recent Triwizard win is being subjected to this
Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage, landed on his head and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers.
Moody then raised his wand, closed his eyes, and began to enchant. “Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!” Harry held tight by the ropes, struggled as much as he could as Moody drew a thin, long, shining silver dagger from his cloak. “Flesh of the servant willing given, you will revive your master,” he said confidently, as the sharp knife fell down on his hand and he cut it off.
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. Millicent was still breathing, but it looked as if she had been knocked out.
“We did see it, Granger, he put the dead spider right on top of Potter’s schoolbooks before he pointed out that Harry was the only thing that could stop the killing curse in its tracts, and then he made us all give it a shot to see if he could withstand it again,” said Blaise.
Draco merely smirked then trotted off in the direction Harry had come from not even waiting for him to catch up.
Harry had never quite noticed how many girls Hogwarts held until giggles erupted every time a boy passed a group of girls in the hall. Ron was equally as confused about how they were supposed to get dates.
“A sick tradition,” Hermione said. “And one that you are unlikely to win. If even one of Mr. Crouch’s relatives are alive, Winky will more than likely feel that she owes her loyalty to them.”
“We can explain afterwards,” snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. Scabbers was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face and neck as he tried to escape Black’s reaching hand.
“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws, but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker.”
“Elf!” said Mr. Diggory sternly. “Do you know who I am? I’m a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures!”
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework, without her, what with all of Flint’s last minute practice sessions. It didn’t matter that he hardly got off the ground or that the others barely acknowledged him. Flint told him that he wanted him to be there, that he maybe had a chance, so he was there. Ron, Harry, Hermione, and Millicent strolled out for a walk the day before the game. Harry may only be a spectator, but there was something about the feel of the pitch. Hermione conjured a bright blue fire that could be carried in a jam jar to keep them warm. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry and Millie moved in front of the jar sure that it wouldn’t be allowed. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.
Harry nearly jumped from the chair. He would have, if it wasn’t for Lucius Malfoy’s hand on his shoulder.
“Ah,” said Skeeter. “but of course you have looked death in the face before. How would you say that has affected you? Do you think the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself?”
He needed to find Millicent, Blaise, and Hermione. He needed to know that someone believed that he hadn’t done this.
“He was never going to meet you—Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”
So Sirius Black was after him. That explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He’d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon where plenty of wizards were there to keep an eye on him. And they were getting Ministry cars the next day because Harry was with them.
The day of the feast, Hagrid came to visit him. He looked scared to even touch Harry. Apparently, their little adventure had shaken Hagrid.
Fred and George choked into their cups. Percy went very pink around the ears, but busied himself with the kettle as Crouch bid a curt farewell to Mr. Weasley then left with Bagman to meet with the delegate.
“Your son died in my service. He will not be forgotten. And neither will the disturbance of an over eager follower. Do you understand?”
More often than not Draco left any shared interrogation as hard as a rock and if not for a quick charm, incapacitated until he could take care of it properly.
“How can someone who can fly as good as you Potter be such a klutz outside of the pitch. Keep your wand by your side next time you’re uncertain about a spell.”
“I daresay that is his…er. Eventual plan,” said Fudge evasively. “But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing…but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he’ll rise again…”
“Mess this up Potter, and even a niffler won’t be able to find your body even with all my jewels shoved down your throat.” Harry eyed the rather large expensive looking jewels and swallowed. That didn’t help his stomach at all.
“Nothing,” Harry muttered, though he clearly remembered the dog but it was bigger than any dog he had ever seen. He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan’s eyes move to the scar on Harry’s forehead.
And Dumbledore told him. That Harry had managed to hold onto the Stone long enough. That Dumbledore had found him just in time. And he told him what would now happen to Nicolas Flamel.
Everything was silver and white. It looked like a fairytale. Too bad Harry couldn’t properly appreciate it as he was about to vomit. Pansy tugged on his arm sharply.
Malfoy rolled off Harry to the left, keeping Harry closest to Millicent. Hermione moved forward, and helped Harry get to his feet. Draco leaned his back against the bed, and Harry unable to stand any longer sat beside him. Millicent and Hermione stood in front of them.
“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as Harry slammed it shut again. “Sounded like a banshee…Maybe you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”
After surprisingly running into Hermione at the infirmary and Madam Pomfrey giving him the go ahead, Millicent and Harry walked back down to the Great Hall. Harry had to ask Hermione if she had passed out as well.
Crabbe nodded as if to say, ‘I can do that’ before offering his hand to Tracey. “Ms. Davis, may I have the honor?”
Pansy scoffed. “After forcing me to save that nasty beast that hurt my Draco, getting dirt on my new robes in the Forbidden Forest, nearly getting us kissed by dementors, tossing me onto the beast that nearly killed my boyfriend then saving a convicted and wanted criminal, no, dear Potter, death would be too good for you.”
But before they could cover themselves again, before they could even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws…Something was bounding toward them out of the dark….something enormous. It was a pale-eyed, jet-black dog.
Harry turned around and saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle walking over and looking way too pleased with themselves.
“It’s okay,” said Harry calmly. “I promise I won’t look, okay? But we need to lift your shirt for the charm to take effect.”
Great, she’s going to simultaneously choke me death and cause me blunt force trauma. But the look on Millicent’s face wasn’t to be bargained with. So with great reluctance, Harry threw himself to the ground.
“Ah, yes,” said Moody. “You don’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can cast the Cruciatus. But you need to really mean this curse. You have to want to cause your enemy pain. You don’t need power, just feeling.”
Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table, roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops, and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, pudding, and more.
“You don’t understand!” whined Pettigrew. “He was so powerful. He got inside my mind. It was only a little information, and then, it was more. He..he would have killed me if I had stopped! He would have killed me, Sirius!”
They strode toward the wall and in a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three-quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts Express, a scarlet steam engine steadily puffing smoke.
After lunch, they headed to their first Care of Magical Creatures class. Ron and Hermione still fighting over their animals were not speaking as they took up opposite sides of their little group. Malfoy stood and nearby, shooting Harry an evil look before turning back to a chortling Crabbe and Goyle.
“Does this mean you are tired of our duel Harry?” Voldemort taunted. “Come out, Harry, come out and play, then….it will be quick…it might even be painless….I would not know…. I have never died….”
“Scare easily, don’t they?” he said loudly. “I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What’s he up to----trying to rescue the Muggles?”
“Don’t worry,” the man said, and Harry could hear the zipper in the silence. “Me and Murray will make it really special for you.” Then, Harry heard Draco call for him. “Harry!” Draco screamed. “Harry, please!”
The ghosts, Harry decided, were a nuisance. When one had nearly managed to drop a bin full of trash on his head, he decided to steer clear of them. Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Mr. Filch. Harry had managed to get on the wrong side of him his very first morning.
Hagrid shuffled into view, looking very out of place in Madam Pince’s library in his moleskin overcoat.
All of the champions and their families were in attendance and where Harry would have felt left out in a situation like this today he felt honored. All thoughts of the tournament went away when he could see that Sirius and Remus were okay, and that Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Weasley were happy. This was his family, and he was proud.
At night, when Harry closed his eyes all he could see were flashes of green. It was easier to close them during the day. Harry took off of his clothes, and slid into the water. It was warm already, and Harry thought serenely that he loved magic. Practice for Quidditch hadn’t started yet, but Harry had been out on the field trying to get back into the swing of things. Several of the other house players had been out as well, but when the Hufflepuff team took to the field, Harry decided that it was time to go.
Then reared back and Harry had nowhere to hide, and he couldn’t run. He was going to get flayed alive.
It was Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle. Draco, of course, was dressed to the nines. Harry had seen him that morning before they all left. He was wearing a wool cloak that would keep the cold from his pale skin. It was Slytherin green. His pants were made of some obscene velvet material. While the hat on his head was also made of what looked to be the softest wool. In general, Malfoy looked like he would be attending a gathering for fashionable Wizarding elite instead of gallivanting in the woods to try and torture Ron.
“Hello,” decreed Lady Zabini or was it Montrese now? Harry would have to ask Blaise sooner rather than later.
Harry could actually hear Millicent roll her eyes, but with some careful spell work the demon dipped its head, allowing some of the water to leak out, giving Pansy the opportunity to strut past it and out of the pool.
“Snape didn’t even come see me to deliver his punishment. All he said was that I have detention for next week, and I have to write lines.”
“The boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart will look like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.”
Snape, he didn’t know anything about Snape. He knew he was a hard teacher. He knew he used to favor the Slytherins and still probably did when Harry wasn’t around. He knew he wanted him expelled, but what else?
“It’s all a lie,” said someone else and a Hufflepuff pushed him, nearly causing him to stumble. “Wanted to be champion so bad he murdered Warrington!”
One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh.
“I knew that Pettigrew’s mother only got to bury a finger after his duel with Black, but all it’s ever been is speculation, a legend that we were always too young to know the whole of, but Draco’s father,” said Millicent.
Harry was a brilliant auror, and Draco knew it wouldn’t take him long to figure out Dra…their secret, and Draco wasn’t sure if his resolve could last against all those soft things or not. But he knew that Harry could never ever know about their connection. Not ever.
Draco headed to the back to file some work, and when he got back, half of his folders were now on Harry’s desk, and on Draco’s set a steaming cup of tea and a note that read: Time for a break, let your lazy partner do the rest.
“Maybe I should have picked someone less…” He shook his head. “Nah, I think I’m quite good with her exactly the way that she is.”
“She didn’t do anything…she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time!” Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very taken aback. Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy better, indeed, than any of the others.
“Which of you did it?” he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. “Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?”
“Step off it, Goyle, no one’s going to believe you’re a big bad. Just last summer we were flying around my backyard.”
In a moment, the dark shape seemed to multiply outward and the weather took notice. Lightening started to strike and Madam Hooch was trying to ground everyone, but the players too desperately absorbed in the game hardly seemed to notice.
So instead he walked to the little eat in kitchen and grabbed a can of something and put it in a pot.
“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class. “Let me see….how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough.”
“It’s not that unusual, plenty of odds one at the Hog’s Head. Might’ve been a dragon dealer, but I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms wide open, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.
Other than that he could Floo into the Ministry, his new job was in a part of the Ministry that was only accessible by other Unspeakables. The hall outside his new office was nearly always vacant, unless you counted the quiet footsteps of his co-worker who had the office down the hall from Draco’s. It was nice, Draco told himself. Quiet, yes, but nice. He no longer had to deal with the incessant chatter or banging wizbees or whatever Weasley attraction was popular at the moment like he did at his old office. And he was doing well.
As they started to walk back Harry noticed the scarf wrapped around Krum’s neck. “That’s funny, my friend Blaise has one just like that.”
“Been keeping close tabs on her?” asked Millicent, not willing to back down from Pansy and her smug, pug face.
“Well,” said Millicent loudly. “Despite this scintillating conversation, I’ve actually got work to do.” She stood from the table then followed Hermione after a book or two. Fred watched her as she went.
Harry wasn’t sure. Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House teams, and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the only one. Seamus, Ron’s housemate, spent most of his life zooming around on his broom in the countryside. Even Ron had stories to tell about his time on a broom.
Harry pulled out his quill, and scribbled a Yes, I’ll see you there, on the back of the note before sending it off with Hedwig.
Cornelius Fudge made his way over to the lifeless body of Cassius Warrington and a screaming Ely McGovern. Warrington’s mother was making her way to the ground, pushing through the horde of students and aurors trying to keep back prying eyes. Warrington’s father was nowhere to be found.
Then before he could ask Warrington what was going on, Mad-Eye Moody had him by the collar of his shirt. Harry felt for a moment as if everything would be okay, someone was there to save him after all, until he was thrown into a nearby headstone. The name reflecting clearly in the moonlight.
They were studying planets in Divination, and since Trewlaney was too set in her ways, she said last year’s partners were this year’s partners so Dean and Seamus were forced to sit together though neither seemed to thrilled with the idea.
Whatever, Draco had said, Krum was too stupid to keep Harry’s attention, despite his more appealing charms. Though he still shudders when he hears the former star’s name. Harry had tried to tell everyone that it was just a kiss, that yes he was gay, but that he wasn’t interested in Krum like that. No, the worst was Octavian Tyler. A lawyer that often worked with the aurors, Harry had taken to him almost immediately. Most people dated, casually outside of their soul mark to see if they could find a match, but with Harry it was different.
Harry tried to ignore the turn of phrase, but his stomach still turned at the words. Why would Malfoy want to protect him? Was it because of the “incident” at the beginning of the year? Did Malfoy still feel like he owed him? Was it an edict from his father? Or was it something else? Harry didn’t know, but he was sure going to try and figure it out. He leaves the library, mentally adding another person to keep an eye on in his ever growing list.
“Oh,” said Blaise, causing Harry to look up. And it was only his quick, seeker reflexes that allowed him to catch the mask before it smacked him in the forehead.
“You each have what the other lacks. Potter is force. Malfoy is stealth. Potter has charisma, when needed, and Malfoy is quick witted. You two are a match.”
“Malfoy, Ma….Draco, wait!” Potter finally caught up with him, placing a hand on his arm and turning Draco to face him.
Harry only caught the end of Neville’s howler the next day in the Great Hall due to the boy’s valiant effort to make it out of the hall before it exploded. Still, Harry felt sorry for the guy.
He approached cautiously, moving steadily toward the rumpled heap that was Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. Malfoy’s blonde hair barely stuck out from the cloak as he screamed and kicked against the fabric of the enlarged cloak they had been under.
There was a soft crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames. They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and wary.
Harry walked to the edge of the water and watched as the dementor lowered its hood and watched as his face across the lake froze in fear. Then he cast the spell, “EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
“And there’s a picture, Weasley!” said Malfoy. “Can’t even spell his name right, like he’s a sort of non-entity, isn’t he?”
It came with physical side effects as well, sickness was common for at least a few weeks after getting the mark removed, fever and aches, some even needing to be hospitalized. Some said they never felt the same afterwards, that they would catch themselves running over the spot on their arm or leg where the mark once was, missing it like when someone has their arm removed but they can still feel their fingers moving. It was a ghost pain they knew they would never be able to shake. It was less taboo to name you child Voldemort than it was to talk about “that place”. But that didn’t stop Draco from walking past it on occasion, the thought was always at the back of his mind, that one day he may find himself inside rather than outside.
Hermione hung her head. Millicent looked like she wanted to say something, but the fierceness in Professor McGonagall’s voice thankfully kept her silent. “I’m very disappointed. Five points from Gryffindor for your
Harry took it gratefully, reaching for the Slytherin scarf he had gotten for Blaise a few weeks ago.
And now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!”
Suspects quickly learned that the Death Eater wasn’t their biggest problem, but the savior was. It turned the tide very quickly in their favor. Harry was just leaving the interrogation room when Ron’s patronus came bounding down the hall. Something was wrong with Hermione.
“The Yule Ball is approaching, and as a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament it is an important opportunity for Hogwarts to socialize with our foreign guests. The ball is only open to fourth years and above although if you wish to invite a lower year as your guest then you are free to do so.”
“Come on!” said a voice from the door. Marcus Flint stood there, gesturing for us to follow him. “Trust me, you don’t want to be the last person in the room.”
He could stand this evil hag being a piss poor teacher, but he would not allow for Cassius’ name to be tarnished. His wand felt heavy in his pocket.
He was standing next to Pansy Parkinson in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors. Harry grabbed Pansy’s hand while she still looked a little out of it, and pulled her along with him. Harry didn’t know why, but they had to get to Hagrid’s.
Afterwards, Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious she banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, gave him a detention, and forbade anyone give Neville the password, causing Neville to wait outside Gryffindor Tower until someone came along and let him in.
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione’s face, Millicent even looked sorry for the animal. Then, strangely, as Hermione went to start serving tea, she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a loud shriek.
Ely wasn’t at the feast. He hadn’t been able to leave his room, Harry had heard his roommates saying.
“But family comes in many different boxes, and I want you to know that you have a family, families actually, and that we all love you and want the best for you and we want you to know that we care.”
“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, and be grateful that it isn’t more. Move along, all of you.”
“Harry, I knew you were, well, made of stronger stuff that Fudge seems to think, and I’m obviously pleased that you’re not scared, but….”
“No more snakes this year, boys, I don’t think my poor heart can take it. I mean, except for you Harry,” George joked and both Harry and Percy rolled their eyes.
Everyone knew that Snape really wanted the Dark Arts job, but even this year it had gone to someone else. Another incompetent idiot, Harry could almost hear Snape say. But Moody didn’t seem like an idiot. Fred and George and their friend Lee Jordan seemed to be enamored with the man.
“Yes,” Blaise nodded. “Draco knew you were never going to accept his friendship, but he didn’t know where I stood about you.”
After some back and forth, Professor Lupin sighed and took out his wand. “This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his shoulder. “Please watch closely.”
Before Harry could ask what type was that, the remains of their food faded from their plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the deserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of,
“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass before Parvati could say anything back. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”
“Do you know I still have trouble believing it,” said Madam Rosmerta thoughtfully. “Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I’d have thought… I mean, I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts. If you’d told me then what he was going to become, I’d have said you’d had too much mead.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, trying to disguise his voice, and hoping that he succeeded. “You’re not so bad yourself.”
Draco moved out of the kitchen and headed to the stairs to his room. Draco should have known not to turn his back on an angry Harry Potter. Harry grabbed his arm, and Draco pulled back so fast it was as if something had bit him. Harry at least had the decency to look ashamed. He was looking at her floor.
Blaise didn’t answer him just turned toward Harry and smiled. “And leave off Longbottom,” Blaise said, stopping Malfoy before he got to the door.
“Hey Pads, do you think we need to do some shopping today? I thought we could go to the supermarket together?”
The two were supposed to be flying, but instead Marcus Flint and Oliver Wood were making out rather heavily against one of the stone corridor walls. Flint’s hand was inside Oliver Wood’s robes as Harry stood transfixed watching the two kiss passionately. Oliver was grinding himself against Marcus’ thigh.
“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic…it’s logic…a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizard haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.”
Malfoy paled before quickly calling for his minions and Pansy who looked all too pleased to be at his beck and call.
“What?” Blaise said when Harry gave him a look. “Now there’s two of them,” he said, talking about Colin and his younger brother, Dennis who Harry had met after dinner last night. Harry grabbed the article, and gave it a scan.
“But you have no fear in being the one who stands on her own. And that is why I envy you, that is why I despised you without knowing.”
“We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” said the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, “and we beg the magical community to remain calm.”
It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of warlocks at the bar. Ron offered to go get their drinks as Millicent and Hermine shared a knowing look.
But as Malfoy wasn’t wearing a collar emblazoned with P.A.N.S.Y on it, then he doubted the blonde had gotten that far yet. He’d have to ask Millicent later what on Earth she had done to poor Malfoy to turn him into such a commitmentphobe. He’d likely get hexed for his trouble, but it would be worth it.
“The first task, it’s dragons, Fleur and Krum already know. I saw them in the forest the other night.”
As the entered through the castle doors and headed toward the Great Hall, Harry heard an unmistakable voice call his name.
“The whole third floor has been searched. He’s not there. And Filch and I have done the dungeons; nothing there either.”
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even from a distance there was no mistaking him. Malfoy had seen the dragon.
“Why don’t you trust me?” he asked, despite himself. “I’ve never pressured you into showing me your mark, but to think that you feel so low about your place in my life…” He stopped, face red and nearly out of breath after his ranting. “You’ve met my family for goodness sake. Sometimes I honestly think they like you more than me. Hermione and Ron call and the first thing they ask is how you’re doing.”
“Why on Earth would you have to learn defensive spells? What could possibly want to attack school children such as yourselves?”
“You don’t know the half of it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge gruffly. “The worst he did isn’t widely known.”
“Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. And while you’re searching ponder this. We’ve taken what you’ll never miss, An hour long you’ll have to look, And to recover what we took, But past an hour, the prospects black, too late it’s gone it won’t come back.”
“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn. Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from
The warning signs flashed in Draco’s mind and his defense mechanisms started to take over. “I believe it was once a rather morbid memory of your mother,” Draco quipped.
People may have thought Harry was a diva before with the autographs, photos, and “celebrity”, but he was about to go to Malfoy levels of prima donna in the fit this woman had him working toward.
He had been fielding hits and insults all day about the article and what Skeeter had apparently uncovered, and he had just had enough.
“Ha,” Harry scoffed. “Tell that to my wand.” And the three of them laughed for awhile before agreeing that it was time to head back. As Harry and Millicent made their way to the dungeons and Hermione to the tower the three looked back at one another and from that point forward Hermione Granger had two new friends.
He turned back to his students. “Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment here. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons….you see, Sirius here played a trick on him. It nearly killed him, a trick which involved me…”
“Full of Dark Magic?” he repeated mildly. “Do you really think so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anyone who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop…..”
And then Harry heard Krum’s voice, “Crucio!” The air was full of Warrington’s screams. Harry turned the corner of the hedge he was running down. Krum turned to curse him next, but Harry cried, “Stupefy!” And the boy fell to the ground.
“DON’T!” shouted Davis, pulling out of Crabbe’s arms violently. The two girls stared at each other for a long moment before coming to a sort of truce, Pansy resuming her comfortable seat on the couch and Tracey taking a chair, each girl firmly in the sights of the other in case anyone felt like sharing any more secrets.
“Isn’t that a school owl?” asked Blaise, eyeing Millicent’s correspondence with the same look Harry was giving it.
“I am also burned off the map,” continued Sirius. “You know what would be a good idea?” said Sirius. “We’ll add you to the map, and then have a celebratory burning of your effigy. It would almost be like a coming of age thing.”
But the dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought, staring into the handsome, laughing face. He doesn’t have to hear my mom screaming if they get to close….
“I don’t know, Harry, Snape May not be your favorite Professor, but I don’t think he’d go against Dumbledore. He’s smarter than that.”
“Just tell me!” shouted Harry. Draco scrambled as Harry fell to the floor and yanked on his leg, pulling Draco to him even as Draco fought to crawl away.
Harry rushed back to Honeydukes, through the cellar, and went straight toward his dormitory. He had stared at the photo hundreds of times, but if he didn’t know he would never have guessed that they were the same person. He opened the album, and stopped on a picture of his parent’s wedding day. There was his father waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there…that must be him. Their best man… Harry had never given him a thought before.
It was unusual for him to be angry with Sirius or Remus, but this was something that he had to do. The pair of them had never backed down from a fight, and Harry wasn’t going to either. “Please,” Harry said, and felt more shame than he had ever felt when hot, frustrated tears sprang to his eyes.
Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin’s hand, was a cloaked figure that towered the ceiling. Its face was completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry’s eyes darted downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, shiny-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed in water….
“Jump, Millie!!” he called as loud as he dared. Wondering if she’d wack him with the flute for using her nickname. Millicent followed right away. She landed, sprawled next to Harry.
Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around, and said, with a small smile, “I haven’t poisoned that chocolate, you know….”
“First Hogsmeade weekend, Potter,” said Blaise as soon as he saw him. “Halloween,” he said and Harry smiled, though he didn’t feel it. He hadn’t yet told Blaise that he didn’t get his slip signed, but he knew he would have to soon.
Harry would never tell him this, but he was always envious of this particular skill. It was something that wizarding children learned when they were younger. It was a fun way for wizarding parents to keep fussy toddlers calm or to wear out any excess energy. Harry wondered briefly if his parents had ever made one for him.
Millicent eyed him as he licked his lips, nearly salivating at the thought, but didn’t say anything.
The day of the first match, the weather was worse than ever, the castle having compensated with more torches and lanterns lit.
Ely stopped beside him, calling the attention of every student present though he didn’t say a word. Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Nott stood not far off absorbing everything intently.
As smart as they were, they had done something incredibly stupid. They had left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.
The only things Harry knew about all of that was what he had heard from Uncle Vernon, and that hadn’t been pleasant at all.
Sensing Winky wouldn’t be up for anymore conversation the group walked away. The other house elves plied them with food and Hermione promised that she’d knit Dobby a new sweater.
“It’s a Remembrall!” he exclaimed. “Gran knows I forget things--- this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. Look,, you hold it right like this and if it turns red--oh…” His face fell because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet. “…--- you’ve forgotten something.”
Then Fred quickly changing the subject said, “So…you lot got dates for the ball yet?” Ron glanced at Hermione who had just set off to find another book and said, “Not yet,” then
“That’s nothing,” he said. “Just something to keep me entertained. I was thinking about taking someone from the team, I think…”
And like that Flint was flying up, a bludger coming at him, but instead of simply out maneuvering it, he flew it straight into Harry’s path. Harry was forced to swerve, allowing Seamus to get slightly ahead of him, and before he could correct himself Seamus had caught the Snitch, and the match was over. Gryffindor had won.
“No one? Perhaps you’re further behind then I had thought. The last unforgiveable is called the killing curse.”
Harry shook the thought loose. He couldn’t let a thought like that take root inside his mind. He didn’t kill anyone. Voldemort did. Voldemort was the one who killed Warrington. Not him. He didn’t do anything wrong. No matter what anyone else gossiped.
Harry had felt guilty using Rose, but when push came to shove. Well, Harry knew Draco could throw a wicked punch but that he would never resort to violence in front of Rose, no matter how much he hated Harry.
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date. The break-in had happened on his birthday. Harry wondered if it had been when they were there.
Harry let Greg go after that, having decided that it was enough for the day. Being able to cast Protego might not necessarily be on the curriculum, but it was something that Greg needed to know especially with Voldemort being back, and Goyle’s father being one of the men that Harry had seen in the graveyard that night.
“In a muggle supermarket?” Harry asked, surprised by Remus’ statement. “Why don’t we send Kreature to the Alley?” Kreature was an elderly house elf that Sirius had apparently forgotten the existence of until they had stepped foot back in Grimmauld Place.
When Harry knocked, they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out saying, “Back, Fang---back.”
“With us, with being who are, with not having the expectations of a father who refuses to acknowledge anything that his son tells him.”
Harry had his own field of support that followed him up to the castle. The twins, Lee Jordan, even Angelina Johnson were there along with his friends and quite a few Slytherin lower years to find out what exactly was in the egg.
Uncle Vernon was looking around the living room in shock, but Dudley was sitting in a corner devouring something off of the coffee table.
It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling madly in his head; he wanted it to end…to black out….to die…
“I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog inside his mouth. “I’ve got too. What if the dementors turn up at one of our matches? I can’t afford to fall off again.”
Fudge turned to leave before stopping and dropping Harry’s winnings on his bed then leaving. Mr. and Mrs. Warrington seemed to be waiting for Crouch in the hallway. Harry rose shakily to his feet, and moved to the door.
It turned out that even champions had to go to potions. Thirty minutes in and Harry found himself hoping for another appearance by Colin Creevey. He would gladly face Rita Skeeter again than face Snape in the mood that he was currently in.
“Your dad’s in the paper, Weasley!” said Malfoy, brandishing a copy of the Daily Prophet and speaking very loudly, so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear.
“Hiding in a map of the Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She’s still very distressed, but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr. Filch restore her.”
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name.
No, this was far too shameful to tell your family about. Draco certainly never planned to tell his. No one but he and Harry would ever know the truth of it. The receptionist handed him a clipboard and a pen. Draco took them gratefully. Maybe after this he’d finally be able to have some peace. He’d go home, take a shower if he could then go to bed. Who knows? He might even wake up hungry. To be able to swallow something but his own bile would be amazing.
“You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future.”
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a kettle was boiling on the fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
And everything changed. Draco’s face was frightened. He was upset, and his cheeks were pale though Harry knew that he had to be furious. Draco was an intensely private person, and Harry was just going to have to respect that. Even as the water steadily filled his lungs.
“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually. “he wouldn’t take his cloak off.” He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
“Several scouts have been in touch with Madam Hooch and will be in the stands throughout the season, that means that we’ll have to practice harder than ever before.”
Fred fiddled with the hem of his jumper, ignoring everyone’s eyes as Harry, Ron, and Millicent stared at him and waited on an answer.
He heard Harry murmur an agreement then a few moments later felt his body rise from the bed. His body wised up and forced him to sleep before he could feel Harry’s weight return to the bed.
“Good evening, ladies and gentleman, ghosts, and most particularly guests,” said Dumbledore, beaming around at the foreign students. “I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.”
“Sorry,” said Harry, finishing the charm and putting his wand away. “I guess I must be more tired than I thought.” Harry pulled back even farther, unconsciously having got closer to Draco, and before Draco could say or do anything else completely life threatening. He turned and tucked into bed.
Draco looked at the mural again and smiled. At least the look on Potter’s face when he saw the thing would be priceless. Maybe Luna would even pose them holding hands, picture Malfoy and Potter holding hands for everyone at the ceremony to see. What a laugh. He and Potter? No way….
“Huh,” the man sighed. “Now, how much do you think the great Harry Potter will pay to get his soul mate back?”
No one slept that night, and everywhere they went security was tighter than ever. Ron had become an instant celebrity due to his near death experience.
Harry went back to the library where Millicent, Blasie, and Hermione were testing Neville on his potions knowledge. Harry told them what he’d heard.
“Magick Most Basic,” Hermione said, without raising her hand. She flipped through the book though Harry knew that she had most likely already read it.
Harry turned around, ready to ask the guy what his problem was when he saw that it was Seamus Finnigan. He barely seemed to recognize that Harry was there at all. He was staring quite intensely at the dance floor where Dean Thomas danced with his date, a boy named Caleb from Durmstrang.
Harry’s interest was piqued. He hadn’t picked up a copy of the Prophet all summer, but if there was Malfoy Blackmail material out there then he wanted to read it.
Harry had felt those curses for a week. He felt them now hoping Blaise’s beauty wasn’t enough to attract Krum. Harry was a good flier, but he highly doubted he could catch Blaise’s fine form if Krum decided to toss him off his broom mid-flight.
Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was, and it wasn’t like Crabbe was going to give him the answer. Hermione, though, shot her hand in the air as soon as Harry hesitated.
The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving at six o’clock on Friday the 30th of October. Lessons will end half an hour early. Students will return their bags and books to their dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to greet our guests before the welcoming feast.
Harry threw the cloak over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Blaise and Harry stood perfectly still until after not seeing anything she turned and left.
Then the show began, and Ireland rained gold from the skies as Harry and Ron watched from Omnioculars.
“That’s how I recognized you to be honest. It had nothing to do with your mark, and everything to do with him. When we were having out little fun with Potter we took a deep dive into his mind. We didn’t have to scrape hard to get at your face. Little Potter is in love with you. We saw….oh…so much,” said Basks lasciviously.
Krum and Fleur also looked stoic in their pre-knowledge until Bagman said, “Ladies first,” and offered the bag to Fleur.
Once every one had joined them, Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione and Millicent, and finally, Harry. He was embarrassed, but really quite pleased, when she gave him an extra hug.
“Home?” said Remus walking towards him. “Now, tell me, Harry, do you really consider Number Four Pivet Drive your home?”
“You honestly believe I tell Hermione or Ron half the things I tell you? What? Do you think I just spread all my secrets to anyone who’s willing to listen? About the mark or Octavian.
They set off again. He led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom door.
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
With that mask Draco was able to fend off Harry’s new attitude. The closer than normal proximity had affected Harry quite drastically. For that day, Harry stood closer to Draco than what anyone would call friendly. When Draco sat, Harry sat right by him. Harry found himself touching Draco subconsciously, brushing his bangs out of his face when they were cooking, grazing his hand over a folder. Draco could tell that Harry too, was disconcerted by his new found attachment to Draco, if his blushes and stammers were anything to go by. Draco knew they had to get out of there fast.
Dumbledore explained the rules, and that it was a competition. One person, a champion, from each of the three major wizarding schools in Europe would compete. Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, and Hogwarts.
“I closed my eyes when you got in,” she said innocently, blinking at him through her thick spectacles.
The dark haired man swooped into the room, and stood right in front of the fireplace blocking a lot of the light from the rest of the room. Harry pushed back into the couch, but found he couldn’t go any further.
“Two of us, you and me, or did you think I’d let you go on a suicide mission alone? You may have the worst kind of luck and be the most stubborn, dramatic person I have ever met, but I didn’t think you were stupid.
He had already worked out that Malfoy knew. What he said in potions that day clicked with what he knew now, but he wondered if his friends knew anything about it.
“It’s time that we show you some of the more hidden aspects of this thing, and we promise that we will let you stay in school, but you have to keep these things with you at all times.”
He leaned back further onto the My Little Pony bean bag. “It looks quite pert, don’t you think? Threatening, like it’s going to take someone’s eye out.”
Harry really shouldn’t have been surprised when he got the notice that he was one of the selected few assigned to the special lessons.
He didn’t have time to waste with Malfoy. He had to see if there was something he could do about Hagrid.
The whole of Hermione's speech here is a quote by Doris Lessing from the Golden Notebook. I wanted something iconic and feminist for Hermione to say here and I read this and thought, that's it.
White fog obscured his senses…big, blurred shapes were moving around him…then came a new voice, a man’s voice, shouting, panicking….
“Wait,” said Ron, pulling something from his pocket. “Look at this. Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing unicorn tail-hair.”
“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Blaise. “I’ll explain to him when he’s able to move again, but for now you two have got some time.”
If it were happening to anyone but himself Draco would have found it almost comical, his dry mouth and shaking hands. He was sharing a bed with Potter for Merlin’s sake not proposing marriage. Harry was, and Draco hated the word but, Harry was too cute for words in his little sleep pants and old Cannon’s t-shirt, toothbrush hanging out of his mouth, darting about the room packing up his things the muggle way, arguing with Draco over the benefits of packing without magic.
That feeling was why he had fallen for Octavian as hard as he did. Octavian, while not his soul mark, had given Harry everything that he had subconsciously needed. Attention. Love. The Promise of a Future. Octavian was the brightest star in any room, and when Harry was in his orbit, it made him feel like instead of being pushed down by that tornado that he was lifted up by its wind. When he was around him, when he kissed him, it made him feel dizzy and lightheaded in the best of ways.
“Of course not,” said Millicent. “It isn’t true. If Pettigrew was an Animagus he would have been registered with the ministry. That’s a highly advanced skill, only seven people have managed it in the last century.”
“I have something to ask you,” said Harry. “Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You now that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”
“That’s right!” sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin. Ropes shot out of Snape’s wand and tied up Lupin and Black immediately.
Lupin smiled warmly. “So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you capable of fighting the boggart?” said Lupin shrewdly.
“Seems like you have some experience in that area, huh, Zabini,” said Millicent, like she knew more than the rest of them.
Harry thought about going to his friend’s defense, but in this instance he knew Malfoy was right. No one under seventeen was getting entered into the tournament, but that didn’t stop him from listening to Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle talk about past champions and the tasks that they had read about.
Harry didn’t bother with thinking about that, as he turned in search of his dance partner. He was James tonight. And James was rather feeling like a swim.
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. “Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks…I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmistress if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice.”
“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only—no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”
“Could you at least shoot a drying charm at my underwear then, it’s turning into a swamp down there.”
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as if he was sitting on some sort of plant.
Harry nodded, glad that at least Neville was all right before they both potentially met their deaths in a midnight duel with Malfoy and his goons.
“That’s their idea of fun,” said Mr. Weasley. “Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn’t resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,” he finished disgustedly.
“Is he?” questioned Blaise, sounding bored. Malfoy had soundly corned Krum and most of the other Durmstrang students, but Krum and his friends who had at first looked fascinated were now looking quite bored with Draco and his lofty rantings. A few had already plead incomprehension and more than a few had slunk over to other house tables as the three schools blended more and more with one another.
“Yeah, right, Weasley, and this place isn’t the hovel I think it is.” Millicent looked around the rather dingy looking tables and chairs in the Leaky and shuddered.
“He’s not an idiot; you just don’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch,” said Hermione. “I’ve heard he’s a really good student…and he’s a prefect.”
Warrington had managed admirably then held out his hand for the boy, Ely, Ely McGovern to take. Ely merely gave him a high five then a teasing brush over his hair before the two had walked away.
“She’s just stating a fact, Weasley,” said Blaise in the same tone. “Relax,” Blaise continued. “It’s not like they are going to fire your precious Giant.” Ron rolled his eyes.
“We’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,” said Hermione, looking desperately sorry for him.
“We can’t kill him. We have to take him to the castle, Professor. It’s the only way to exonerate Sirius. Then,” Harry said, looking down at Pettigrew coldly. “Then I want to watch as the dementors suck his soul from his body.”
“Hope you have…er….a. good holiday,” said Hermione, who had caught up with them, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. Millicent had her hand in her wand pocket.
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and a pile of rotten bananas. And then he heard it, a low groaning, and the shuffling of footfalls of gigantic feet.
“Lovely to meet you,” Sirius said, turning his charm on the two girls who were nearly the spitting image of their mother. Harry knew that Blaise and the girls had different fathers, but they looked nearly identical. The maternal genes must be strong in this family.
As Harry had to dodge another blast, he wondered if there was anything like a shield charm that he could use in this scenario, and just when exactly he would learn that particular spell.
When Flitwick partnered them Harry got Blaise while Ron, not so lucky, got Hermione. At least, it wasn’t Seamus Finnigan who Harry noted hadn’t managed to float his feather but had succeeded in making it burst into flames.
“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”
“Surely you are aware that this is not real, Potter. Whatever it is that you are seeing, it is not...”
Ron grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had fallen out, leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron’s hands as thought desperate to free himself.
“No, No ,NO!! It was I who tried to kill you. If it wasn’t for that stunt you pulled you would have been splattered to the ground like Mr. Flint.”
After practice, Flint seemed to be waiting for Harry. “Look, Potter,” Flint’s foot nudged the ground, like they were about to have a really uncomfortable conversation.
Harry knew that it would take time for Sirius to be free entirely, but he was glad that his days at Pivet Drive were numbered.
Smiling, he accepted her invitation, as Blaise moved to the side to watch them play. “She’s tricky, Potter, you’ve got to watch her.”
“I want someone to share my life with, someone to sit on the couch and watch rubbish tv with. I want someone who’s funny and interesting, someone I can talk to.” He felt wrecked, desperate tears in his eyes because he longed for this person who has been by his side for nearly two years, and suddenly Draco realized just how angry he was. How could he not see him? That was all the stuff they did together. Draco was the one who listened to him. Draco was the one who suffered through Cannon matches with him. Draco was the one who his family loved and who would do anything for him, and yet he has always looked right past him.
As soon as Harry hit the ground with Cassius’ dead body, he knew he had to tell someone, he knew he had to tell them about Moody, or the Not Moody. He knew he was still here, in the stands somewhere, was he sitting beside Millicent or Ron and Hermione, was he talking with Ely in sly tones, wondering about how his boyfriend was fairing in the maze when he was the one who had just murdered him?
“Harry Potter, she whispered. Oh what a poor boy. Now, she might not have been able to say anything to anyone, but none of those charms helps who happens to overhear her. It wasn’t too much work after that to be able to put two and two together and find the patient records. It was almost too easy.”
Rivalry, he definitely didn’t want to have a rivalry with someone who looked like Cassius Warrington, but it seemed as if that had been decided without him. His table had been split with some invisible dividing line. Warrington wasn’t even at breakfast but as far as Harry could tell the upper part of the table was filled with fifth, sixth, and seventh years students, while the others had been delegated to sit closer to the doors. Members on both sides seemed to be staring at one another as if they were on the brink of war, one wrong word and spells would start flying.
“Ah,” said Ron. “Think of the possibilities. It would’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident…Shame his mother likes him…”
His soul mark had been on the front page, and was now in the minds of nearly every person in the magical world. And yet, no one had stepped forward.
Johnson on the Gryffindor team had just scored a goal and the everyone in the arena were going nuts. And then Harry saw something that made his heart stand still. The snitch. Harry moved for it. The score was pretty even, whoever got the snitch would be the determining factor. Flint had been playing the game of his life. Even Madam Hooch seemed impressed. Harry thought he kept seeing Flint watch for the scouts in the stands, but he wasn’t sure how he could see anything as fast as the game was going.
Harry was asleep the next morning at breakfast. Millicent kept having to nudge his side so he wouldn’t fall into his porridge. The dreams had abated somewhat while he was back at the Burrow, but last night with Quidditch Weekly open on his chest dark dreams had haunted him. Dreams of graveyards, headstones, and the feeling of anticipation.
Good things had always been taken away from him. Dudley got the best room, the best and only gifts. He received the newest things while all Harry got were scraps. Often, literally.
“I know it’s you Malfoy,” he called into the locker room. “Fool me once,” he said though he doubted the pureblood wizard would have ever heard such a phrase. Though surely at the Malfoy residence they had a saying about not playing in snake dens.
Harry was pushed to the side, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle making their presence known as they passed by Harry and Ron.
“It’s not that easy,” said Lupin, then noticing Harry’s expression. “I think it’s better if we leave this conversation here, some things you’re still not quite old enough to understand.”
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand….but it wasn’t here. Only his Omnioculars.
Flint was standing in the corner of the room mouth gaping, eyes still darting between Snape and the Firebolt, looking for all the world like he might try to make a grab for it and run. And Harry figured that he might as well go all in.
“We do all of those things together. Why do you think we get along so well Harry? You’re the brilliant auror, don’t tell me you still don’t get it.” The words were out in anger before Draco could filter them with sanity. And then he watched as it started to click for Harry.
After Harry refused to plot Buckbeak’s downfall, he rose to leave Professor Trewlaney to assign his dismal grade.
“What do you know about it Flint?” said Wood, trying to rise from his bed, but the pain in his leg stopped him. Flint turning to see Wood’s struggle, stood a little too quickly and walked over to the other boy.
“Don’t you dare let go, Potter!” it said. Its voice distant and echoing. Harry looked at Voldemort, his wide eyes said that he had no more expected this than Harry had.
Voldemort looked away from Harry and began examining his new body. Harry could barely stand to watch as Voldemort eyed his new body exultantly. Moody, who must be getting weaker by the minute offered up his undamaged arm. The Dark Mark waited patiently for Voldemort’s wand. Voldemort eyed it greedily.
“Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to,” said Sirius quickly. “I understand, I just thought I’d….”
“Then what, Draco?” Harry moved toward him. “As far as I’m concerned you’re the one who doesn’t trust me.”
“No worries about you though. We’ve seen that shit hole you live in, but at least it’s got four walls and a roof.”
“So, basically you want me?” Draco spoke up, unable to stay silent any longer. “Me, but less stained?” he clarified for a confused looking Harry.
“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful, soaring sensation of his stomach.
He hang limply on the tombstone of Voldemort’s father. The night rang with the sound of the Death Eater’s laughter.
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed into bed that night. The dog was guarding something… What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you
Malfoy, Harry hated to admit it, was quite a graceful dancer, with his long legs and delicate hands that were so good for potions making. Then Harry remembered that this was Malfoy that he was talking about and that even if he did decide that he liked men or women or both or neither that he couldn’t have Malfoy like that because the Malfoy that was also less pointy than he had been in recent years was still the same prejudiced snob that he had always been, and Harry doubted that would ever change.
“Dean looks nice all the time. But that other guy, you would think someone would put in more effort for something like this, but what do you know, foreigners, I guess.”
“I never laid a hand on her!” Pansy looked so livid, Harry thought she was going to turn her wand on him. “I loved her!” said Pansy. “I loved her, and she’s dead, and I hate myself for it. I hate this damn school, and my mother and everyone, but HER!”
When the group got back to Grimmauld Place, Harry opened the door to raucous cheer. Mrs. Weasley immediately swept him up in a hug, and the proceeded to pass him along to Fred and George, then Ginny, Ron, then finally Hermione. Harry relished every single embrace.
Harry looked up at the owner of the hand, and into the face of one Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself. Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them. “What did ya call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand the moment you left his shop four years ago.”
“Where’s Tyler?” Ron asks, and Draco stands so quickly, Harry thinks he might fall over. He reaches a hand out to steady his partner.
Harry smartly ignored Bagman and chose to sit next to Warrington until he left. Before long Warrington was called. Harry wondered how much they would be able to hear, but when Warrington entered the enclosure the roar of the crowd was hard to miss.
“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match, you will be able to keep them at bay long enough for you to get back on the ground.”
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step closer to it when a slithering sound made him freeze. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered….Then, out of the shoulders, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn and started to drink its blood.
Harry just turned around another corner when he heard something that sounded like a scuffle. With Fred and George’s fight still on his brain, he kept going, just in case others were letting the excitement of the night get to them.
Harry, Malfoy, Hermione, and Millicent had sat and written out a letter to Sirius and Remus. He knew that the letter would bring both Sirius and Remus to Hogwarts, but it was better for them to know from Harry then for them to hear about the incident from another source. Millicent, to be specific. Harry couldn’t physically write the letter so Hermione wrote for him while Harry, with the occasional addition by Draco, dictated.
Catching the look on Harry’s face Neville continued. “People only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you know enough
“Yeah,” said Harry. “but I’m learning. And every new thing I’ve learned makes me feel sicker than the thing before.” Then he turned his back on his house mates and started to walk away. He stopped when he heard Marcus Flint’s voice.
It was the man’s eyes that did it. One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye, and then it rolled right over, pointing at the back of the man’s head so that all they could see was whiteness.
Harry was announced as being the first to complete the task as he dragged Malfoy to the platform.  A towel was tossed over his shoulders as an eager and lost looking Crabbe and Goyle told Draco about the clue.
“Every guest in this Hall will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all once again that we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great, but we can fight it with an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.
The defense classroom changed and shifted with the style of the professor. Lockhart had preferred portraits of himself painting portraits of himself and more mirrors than Harry thought proper to own. Remus had preferred books, and the creatures themselves to study and understand. Even Crouch Jr. had a very fine aesthetic going with his various utensils of death and dismemberment.
Harry entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom and walked inside. But it wasn’t Professor Lupin’s happy face that greeted him, but Snape’s usual scowl.
If Draco tried he could almost convince himself that this was real, that Harry was his and that he was bustling about, getting ready for bed in their room and that this was completely normal and expected instead of completely throwing Draco into an undignified frenzy.
“Worse even than that, m’dear….” Fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble. “Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies. One of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn’t an easy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them their best chance was the Fidelus Charm.”
After Harry, Millicent, and Hermione all signed, Blaise entered the library looking unusually disheveled.
“Hmmmm…well, only the people who really know are in no condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon.”
“Azkaban must be horrible,” Harry muttered. Lupin nodded firmly. “The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea but they don’t need walls when their prisoners are all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheerful thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.”
Potter sat up front joking with Thomas and Finnigan even as Luna moved to the stage dressed in her polka dot dress she had gotten especially for the ceremony. She looked like a deflated beach ball, but a very pretty deflated beach ball, of course.
Flint halted the team as he spotted the Gryffindor’s all in a huddle. Oliver Wood standing in the middle of a rapt group featuring Fred and George, and none other than Seamus Finnigan.
“I thought you said that green was out for this season,” Harry said, echoing the boy’s words back to him.
Millicent seemed surprised by this, but said, “I’ll be back as soon as I can,” then lower to Ron, “Keep Granger on the rails or we’re all doomed.”
In quick succession, Hermione and Fleur broke the water and then Viktor and Blaise. The two champions were only a few seconds apart, but Cassius was still under the water. The look on Fleur’s face as she stared down at the murky water hinted that the witch knew why Warrington was yet to finish.
“What on Earth did you get Malfoy that could possible match that thing?” Ron asked, gesturing to Millicent’s traditional, barbaric, tracking device, uh, ring.
“My Lord, I was constantly on alert. Had there been any sign from you, any whisper of your whereabouts, I would have been at your side immediately, nothing could have prevented me….”
“I don’t believe,” he stared. “, that people are born evil. I think certain events may tempt them to the Dark, but….” He stopped. “When I knew Sirius in school he wasn’t the person that he is now, and he certainly wasn’t the kind of person, or at least I thought, who could….who could do what he did.”
Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile had faded from his eager face. Millicent was thus unaffected.
“The moment has come,” said Dumbledore, smiling around at the sea of upturned faces. “The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. As you know three champions compete in the tournament, one from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournaments tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard cup. The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector. The Goblet of Fire.”
“You need to go to Dumbledore,” said Blaise, suddenly their voice of reason. “That’s what you idiots should have done weeks ago.”
“Now, I get to show you what the Bludgers do. Take this.” He handed Harry a small club, like a small baseball bat.
“Huh,” scoffed Pansy. “No dessert, ever,” said Pansy. “But that was more my mother’s doing than Mrs. Tizzy’s. Mother had and still has this chronic fear of my gaining weight. How will she ever marry me off if I’m as big as Bulstrode?”
“Get the fuck out of my house,” replied Draco calmly. If he didn’t back down now he would still leave, and he wouldn’t……
Thanks for reading and commenting I truly appreciate the thought and effort you guys give to this fic. Unbeta'd but full of love.
It was a dirty game and Harry was glad that he wasn’t directly apart of it as he and Seamus circled the field looking for the snitch.
“You don’t understand!” Lupin nearly roared, and Lupin never raised his voice. “Harry, I think it’s time for you to head back to the dungeons.”
Harry hadn’t been back to the dorm all but to get his stuff, none of his roommates were there. Harry was glad. He hadn’t wanted to face them just yet, much less sleep in the same room as the sons of the men who had just tried to murder him. He didn’t know how he was going to handle next year.
Harry wondered briefly what Fred and George were up to. He hadn’t seen them since the start of the term though he had heard from Mil that the twins were busy product testing some of their newest creations. Harry would have to watch what he ate in the future.
“It really isn’t fair,” said Neville quietly. “My gran has talked about the importance of getting good OWL scores since I was five.”
Thanks for reading, I love hearing your comments. Thank you for your support, I love this fandom. I do not own Harry James, I just love him and his parents by the way, all three of them..... Yes, I mean you Sirius Black. And Jo, If you're reading this, tweet me, call me, send me, skywrite me, because I have an idea for you.
“Use of underage magic and being held under the suspicion of responsibility in the death of three Muggles.”
Meanwhile, first year exams were fast approaching and even Blaise was finding himself in the library more than usual. Harry walked with him if only to alieve himself of Millicent and Hermione’s nagging.
Harry didn’t know why it bothered him so much. He had Octavian. He was happy. Well, he used to be happy. Harry had contemplated nearly every option. At times, he worked on this puzzle harder than he worked on his current case load. He stopped himself before he put up a tracking map connecting pictures of his mark to events with pieces of string.
“Not likely,” he said before moving on. He may trust his friends enough to reveal some of what his home life was like, but that didn’t mean that he was going to give Snape any more ammo to torture him with.
“I am merely concerned that you do not hurt her. She is an incredible person and rumors are that you are also with this Hermy-own-ninny Gr….”
After filling in Ron about the package from Gringotts they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
“Yes,” said Millicent. “But it’s different for house elves especially for one who is just newly separated from her family. A wrecked house elf will want to feel useful which is why Blaise is…
Harry wanted to say that he didn’t have any strengths, but he held his tongue. He was good at a few things, Quidditch for one. It was like Moody had read his mind.
“And what are you two talking about? Deciding which one is getting the next cover of Witch Weekly?” said Ely, walking back toward the table. “I’m sure Krum’s had it enough he could stand to pass on the honor in favor of a new handsome face.”
“Your assignment,” muttered Pansy, her hands full of a stack of other papers, that Harry assumed were schedules and new handbooks for the first years. Malfoy was standing near the fire obviously waiting for Professor Snape.
Draco had never dreaded going to the Ministry more in his life, not during his first day of auror training when many on the force held very strong feelings about a former Death Eater who thought they could join the ranks, not when he was a child when his father had promised they would spend the day together but really Lucius had spent the whole day taking meeting after meeting with people who all held more worth than he did.
“Salazar knows there is no way the great Harry Potter would be sorted into Slytherin and not be my new roommate.”
“No,” said Harry, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I mean, we got him. He confessed as soon as you left. Works every time,” Harry said, still giddy after his win.
The group said goodbye to Fred and George, and started walking toward the North Tower. “Let’s go this way,” Millicent said.
“Magic is a wonderful thing. Potions more so. There are potions for almost anything. Potions that can turn you into another person, potions that can steal your life with a sip, there’s even potions that can make you tell the truth no matter how badly you fight against it. Veriterserum, it’s called. It’s highly regulated of course. You may be familiar with one other regulated material. A certain weed that allows you to breathe underwater.”
“Didn’t try to lead them on strike, did you Granger?” asked Blaise. “House elf magic is not to be messed with. Keep going and while it may look like chicken or meatloaf, or even pumpkin juice it will taste like sardines, Granger, sardines.”
But Moody paid him no mind as he made sure the cords were tightly wrapped around Harry’s body, making sure he couldn’t get away.
“You’re insane,” said Adrian Pucey. “Come on, Marc, you don’t really think you’re going to be able to do this.”
He had found Harry lying near a fallen tree, and had just been able to apparate out and capture the two of them before getting Harry to a hospital. The people there were completely baffled as to how either of them were still walking the state that they were in, but no one had asked any questions. But Draco knew. He knew that the mark had saved them.
“I know that’s an Allucian scroll about the bathing habits of their people, not exactly top secret if I can decipher what it is?”
Millicent seemed just about as nervous as Neville. Even Harry knew that flying wasn’t something that could be learned out of a book, not that it kept Hermione Granger from flipping through Quidditch Through The Ages at breakfast that morning, Neville hanging on her every word over at the Gryffindor table.
Harry rolled his eyes, torn between being angry and humored by the elf who hadn’t exactly taken a liking to him. Though, he did think that he was above Remus and Sirius in the elf’s estimation.
Then Warrington and Ely’s head popped above the water. Cassius seemed to cradle his boyfriend as the two made their way to the platform. Ely was enjoying the attention, allowing Cassius to garner the cheers of the crowd for saving him. Cassius helped Ely on to the platform and the Slytherin boy took a deep nod toward the people.
“….makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was saying. “Harry’s got a right to know. I’ve tried to tell Fudge, but be insists on treating Harry like a child. He’s thirteen years old….”
The key didn’t stand a chance. Harry lurched forward and with a nasty crunch pinned the key to the wall. They flew down and Harry ran to the door. He rammed it into the lock and turned…it worked. The moment the lock had clicked, the three of them ran for it, through the door.
Draco couldn’t deny them that, for most of his formative years he’d been nothing but an arrogant little prick and if the shoe were on the other foot then he knew he would do the same as them. Worse, he wouldn’t just whisper, he would revel in it. Now, though he was wading in his own shit. He had crawled up through the muck to get to where he was now. Malfoy vaults had been restored, and what didn’t go to restitution or legal fees had been enough to afford him a gorgeous flat close to Diagon Alley. He still had to work and there wasn’t as much of a cushion as before, but his life was better than he thought it would be when he took the mark. It was more than he deserved, his apartment, his job, Harry. Though, he supposed Harry was a form of penance all his own.
Since there were so few students there for the Christmas Hols everyone opted to sit together. Percy, Ron’s brother, was ushered over by Fred and George to where they were all sitting though he tried to sneak over to the prefect area. Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. So much delicious food, and there were also stacks of wizard crackers spread along every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live, white mice.
Harry seriously doubted it. He knew he’d be in for it, but decided to put it out of his mind until then.
“The Bloody Baron,” Flint answered, not bothering to look up from his plate. “He’s our house ghost,”
“Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his eye that Harry didn’t like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.
The Ministry halls were lush and active as people blazed in and out of fireplaces that lined the halls, and people apparated here and there, interoffice memos flying overhead. The group of them walked down a long, barren hallway, and Harry, once again, felt a chill in the air. It was only halted by the reassuring hand that Remus placed on his shoulder, and the bear hug that Sirius wrapped him up in before he went into the courtroom.
Mr. Weasley was right, they did have good seats. They were close to the Minister himself, and Millicent and her family. Harry waved at her, and noticed the rather similar looking but older girl sitting beside Millicent looking bored even with all the excitement in the air.
“No, Ron,” he said. “It’s not true and will never be true. Hermione’s just my friend. I’d be more likely to kiss you than her.”
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
“Fine,” barked Draco, and Harry tried to block out the sound of relief in his voice. He bumped the coffee table in his hurry to get to the door. At this point he could barely see. He grabbed his leather jacket with a flurry and pulled it on angrily. Then the words came out.
A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment, Scabbers was frozen in mid-air, his small gray form twisting madly. Ron yelled, the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding flash of light and then…..
The sound of an angry Bludger zooming close to him and Seamus Finnigan in front of it, trying to outrun it. The boy, unable to fly anywhere else, came barreling towards him. Harry caught only the boy’s freckled face as he flew nose to nose over Harry then into one of the canopy’s supports followed by the Bludger. Harry didn’t know which made the sickening crunch that filled his ear, Seamus or the breaking beam, but Harry knew his stomach would never be the same again. He wrenched himself free of the nail in just enough time for the beam to have its final say before it fell right on top of him. Harry landed in between the bleachers, but he was trapped.
Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was wrong because when Professor McGonagall came out of her office, she was leading Neville.
Plus, the masks were extremely helpful in hiding identities. Each mask seemed to be imbued with more than just colorful art and peacock feathers as the addition of glamour charms made it impossible to determine just who was under what mask unless the wearer wanted others to know.
Hermione looked completely scandalized before coming to her senses. “Well, I don’t doubt that he would try to do such a thing. The man seems insane. Scared poor Neville something fierce.”
“Well done, Harry!” cheered Professor Lupin. “Well done all of you, five points each to Slytherin, plus your extra credit.”
“I envy you.” The blonde part veela was soaked to her skin, her wet hair plastered to her skull, and yet she still looked enthralling.
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” she said. “You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think
And he did. Neville sat at the Gryffindor table, nose buried in a book with a large green plant on the cover, looking completely absorbed.
“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. He reached up to high five Blaise as they approached. Blaise did so, clearly on a high from finishing the last of their tests. They would have one week until they knew their results.
“Those fools, please,” said Draco. “Dumbledore said he was going to draw the age line himself, they don’t stand a chance.”
“Cucumber, Vincent?” and Harry had no idea how Blaise could make that sound dirty, but he managed it. Crabbe took the offered cucumber and waded into the pond. He smiled brightly at a still annoyed Tracey Davis.
It was normal for the houses to cheer loud for their new classmates, but Slytherin seemed to be trying to outdo even that standard today. They cheered loudly for Baddock, and though the rest of the houses would seem to have every reason to not clap for the newest snake after news of what happened at the Cup had spread, a few gave a polite clap. Even the people at the Gryffindor table who Harry knew had been distressed from the attack didn’t react any different than normal.
With surprising grace, Pansy landed without making a big splash. Oh, she shot a smarting stinging hex at a laughing Crabbe, but other than that, she looked rather regal in the muddy water. Blaise, wasting no time, leaned over and opened the bag as the monkey like demon once again rose above the surface of the water.
He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn’t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape
The troll moved towards Hermione apparently thinking she was the easier target when Harry shouted, “Confuse it!” at the top of his lungs effectively drawing the troll to his side of the room. The troll stooped a few feet from
“Very well, thanks, Percy,” Harry replied with a smile, remembering the events of last year. Percy looked better and as Fred and George threw themselves over Percy’s shoulders to get to Harry to say hello, it looked like that relationship was still running smoothly, too.
“This means,” said Professor Lupin. “that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the Cloak over his
Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, his tennis ball eyes brimming with tears of happiness. He looked the same as always, but was wearing…something unusual. When Dobby worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn the same filthy pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen. A tea cozy for a hat pinned with bright badges, a horseshoe patterned tie over his bare chest, odd socks, and plaid shorts.
“Shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?” Ron asked, pulling his hands to his mouth to puff warm air on them.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that….. Hmm, just wait Harry Potter Slytherin will serve you good. You’ll see… SLYTHERIN!”
Malfoy looked like he wanted to argue but the look on Pansy’s face dissuaded him of that quick enough. A sound like a whip cracking filled the air and reflexively Harry put his hands on Malfoy’s waist. Harry damned Pansy and her death stick both, praying that wasn’t going to be a permanent reaction.
“It’s the fact that you have a family that loves you, and that supports you!” Harry shouted. The whole platform now had eyes for the pair. “It’s that you got to be raised by a mother and father who loved you and who wanted you. Yes, maybe they spoiled you into the little rat that you are today, but at least you have them.”
“So, is this a trial or merely a questioning? Is this an impartial hearing or hunt with an innocent Hogwart’s student as the prey?”
The staffroom, a long, paneled room of old, mismatched chairs, was empty. The classes’ attention was quickly shifted onto a large wardrobe at the end of the room. It shook slightly as if something were waiting inside to get out.
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you Hagrid, and you wouldn’t tell anyone would you? Not even one of the teachers?” said Harry anxiously.
Blaise who was completely unperturbed lay on Harry’s bed, his hands propped under his neck, looking for the whole world like he hadn’t just tried to feel Harry up.
It was rare that it was ever just the two of them in the dorm, but with careful use of both his cloak and some Slytherin ingenuity, Harry had managed to get Malfoy alone without Crabbe and Goyle. He had to do something about Malfoy’s teasing.
“Yeah,” said Fred. “And the best part is you won’t even realize it’s a punishment until it’s too late.”
Harry followed the team out of the locker room his knees apparently having not got the message that he was just standing on the sidelines as they shook with each step he took. Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in hand.
Harry looked at her incredulously. “What Potter? My family makes it their business to know powerful witches and wizards, and being an Animagus falls into that category.”
Pansy and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw Lupin and Millicent then the others. Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky. Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon…..
“Besides, we’ve got no proof,” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know anything about how the troll got into the castle and they’ll believe him. He’s the Professor we’re the students,
“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry. He was thinking of Dobby and the way that he would have to beat himself up anytime he did something that he knew the Malfoy’s wouldn’t like. And before an argument could break out between Hermione and Ron that Harry would be forced to join, they set off once again.
“Someone said the Weasley twins were thinking about entering,” said Goyle as he sat on the side of his bed.
“Well, I’m taking more classes than you, aren’t I?” said Hermione. “Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies….”
Harry would never forget the day that he had come into the office to sniggers and jeers and found his face on the front page of the Daily Prophet. Well, the part of his face that wasn’t pressed into Krum’s. It had been mortifying.
And Harry knew that it wasn’t Ely that he was taking back up to the surface. Harry drew his wand and sent a burst of fire toward the rope that held Draco to the statue, grabbed the prat by the arm and tugged him toward the surface, leaving Warrington behind him.
The two boys moved toward the door. “Are you at least sorry you called me stupid?” Harry asked the dark skinned boy.
Flint led them to the locker rooms for what Harry was sure would be one heck of a motivational speech.
“I’ll lay some clothes out for you,” Harry said, looking Draco in the eye. “I’m proud of you for fighting,” he said. And Draco nodded.
“They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,” Dumbledore continued. “and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody it to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks of disguises or even Invisibility Cloaks,” he added blandly, and Harry stared hard at the table. “It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors,” he said.
“Yeah, loads,” said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry’s disappointment. He told them not to worry. Malfoy stopped to taunt him, but Millicent sent a jelly-legs jinx at him, causing him to fall face first into a puddle of water. Professor McGonagall dried him with an annoyed flick of her wand, but it was still great to watch.
It seemed to be a handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.
The mentor program, Harry learned, was really quite easy. For the most part, mentors were tasked with looking after their respective first years. Were they doing okay in classes? Were they homesick? Did Snape need to be contacted for any reason? Most of the time, the mentor program was never revealed to the first year.
She looked like she normally did, Harry thought, but when she got closer to the table it looked as if she hadn’t slept. Her eyes were puffy, and her hair was a little frizzy, like she had been running her hands through it repeatedly.
His family smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
Harry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he’d ever tasted and it seemed to warm every bit of him from the inside.
“I am told that you have not renounced the old ways, though to the world you present a respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in a spot of Muggle torture, I believe. I heard of your exploits at the Quidditch World Cup, but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your master?”
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long silver ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
“Yeah,” chuckled Harry. “Because you’re so full the only thing you want to do is wrestle me for the bed.”
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. Undaunted, Flint had the team training harder than ever, under the watchful eye of Madam Hooch.
After thanking Bagman for his blatant offer to cheat, Harry met Hermione were she had been gathering signatures.
Both Neville and Hermione had refused to utter a syllable about what had happened the night before. Other than the mystery and three headed dog, things were going great. Hogwarts was beginning to feel more like home that Pivet Drive ever had. His lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had covered the basics.
“see that there, that silvery stuff shinin’ on the ground? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the
“I said to meet me by the gate three minutes ago, Wood.” The man looked like he had last year. Large, burly, with a no nonsense air about him, and that tone in his voice that said that Harry…no Wood, this time, would be running extra laps.
“Joke?” Bagman repeated, bewildered. “No, no, not at all! Harry’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire.”
“Ha ha,” Blaise mocked, though he smiled at her affectionately. When she heard Harry was staying Millicent had owled her family and told them that she too would be staying behind.
After agreeing that Millicent would come back to the camp ground with them, Harry and the group started to make their way back.
“Of course not, good sir. There’s nothing wrong with your house stylistically. It’s just not entirely functional for a wizard. Besides I think there’s something wrong with your fireplace. I’ll just fix it for you.”
“You can’t,” Draco said, the last traces of polyjuice wearing off Harry’s skin. Rose looked up at her other beloved uncle in happy surprise.
The whole class was now looking at him. Umbridge, too. She nodded her head quickly once to show that she had recognized his desire to speak.
Harry had tried to get close to Fleur to tell her the truth, but every time he tried to get close, Pansy pulled heavily on his arm and Harry realized what a bad idea that was after all. All of the Weasley’s were dressed up nicely. Fred had somehow gotten Angelina Johnson to go with him while George had asked fellow teammate Katie Bell. Neither of the twins looked as happy as most of the other students. Harry had assumed that Fred and George would be shooting off more of those sparklers that they had at the Burrow, but instead, they barely seemed inclined to talk to one another.
“I’m glad you were able to make it out of that scrape. Fudge seems to be working with a bit of a vendetta.”
Draco could barely tolerate the feel of his arms against the side of his body. He didn’t dare use even the pads of his fingers to brush away his tears. The feel of them running over his cheeks and lips, dipping into his ears only made him cry more. The actual pain of burning the mark off his body was nothing compared with the knowledge of their now severed link. As Draco lay on the operating table writhing in pain, he had grabbed onto the healer’s shirt and fought to ask.
Harry walked to the train with his friends beside him. Ron was gushing over his signed photo of Krum that Hermione had gotten for him. Hermione was staring fondly at her still new boyfriend. Blaise was chatting with Millicent, Fred, and George about something he couldn’t hear. George laughed raucously at something that Millicent said. Fred pretended to be put out, but walked closer to the Slytherin girl anyway. Millicent watched him with an odd look on her face. Something was definitely happening there. He would have to tell Fred to watch his tea. After dealing with a hysterical Malfoy all of last year, Harry doubted the world could handle a hysterical Weasley twin. Maybe he would include that in the letter he planned on sending them along with the winnings from the tournament. They would put it to better use than Harry ever would. Besides, it would hardly be fair if Millicent had the upper hand. Maybe all of those galleons would make it a level playing field for the two of them.
When the owls swooped down, Harry got another letter from Hagrid. Two words on the parchment: It’s hatching.
Draco was the one to walk him to the last task parading him in front of what had to be the oddest group to ever exist toward the pitch for Harry’s final show.
God now that Ginny was fucking Luna instead of Potter. He remembered thinking of how unfair it was and how grateful he had been when he saw him at the Manor that day. Yeah, Draco remembered a lot.
“Yes,” said Harry defiantly. “There should be consequences for murder or other heinous acts. You said that you were friends with him and my father, how could someone you would be friends with change that much? Was he always capable of what he did or did he become that?”
Their tone was mocking, but it lacked the disdain it had in previous years. They were teasing Percy like they did everyone. It showed once again that at least some equilibrium had remained after second year.
“Sorry, Potter, but I need this. I need to do this for me and Ely. We’re going to start a life together, finally. And I’ll be free of my father and his influencers.”
Hermione stopped them as they were leaving to head to classes together, telling them of her brief hunger strike and the new war she was raging herself.
“Ely,” Harry said, breaking Voldemort’s rant. “Remember him, Cassius, Ely. He’s your boyfriend. You love him and he loves you. You’re going to get out of here, and make your own life remem….”
Harry shook his head violently to tell Neville to shut up, but Professor McGonagall had already seen.
Warrington seemed to take this in like Harry had done in the forest the other night. He looked terrified and Harry wondered if he had looked the same. He was sure he had looked worse.
“Right,” said Draco. “But Potter, do you know what kind of creatures live in the Black Lake? Do you know what haunts those waters? What the flicker of shadow is that blocks the light for only moments in the dorm?”
“Now, first thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is, they’re proud, very easily offended. Don’t never insult one, ‘cause it might be the last thing yeh do,” Harry spotted, Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle all huddled and hoped they weren’t planning on messing up Hagrid’s first lesson.
Harry noticed Malfoy’s hurried manners, and his eyes darting toward the door as he answered the two bouncy first years, but Harry also saw the slight uptick of Malfoy’s lips.
Ever since the Yule Ball last year, when Harry had caught Flint and Wood in what could only be called a compromising embrace, Harry had though seriously about what attracted him. He had even watched a rather interesting television program in Milan while Remus and Sirius were out doing some light shopping. It had been…enlightening to say the least. Harry had thought that all of the tragedy in his life as of late would have halted those particular feelings, but here they were, loud and unyielding.
Warrington took note of him then and looked like he was about to say something when Ludo Bagman entered the room. He took Harry by the arm and led him forward.
Harry had a blank Hogsmeade slip, no where to sleep and the vision of a ballooned Marge floating away into the night.
the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter, none of this matters, except for getting the Stone. You may be safe here in this house, in your green robes, but what about Hermione and Neville and Ron? What about me? I don’t care if I get caught trying. I may have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to come and get me there instead of here, but at least I tried, because I am never going over to the Dark Side. I’m going through the trapdoor tonight and nothing anyone says is going to stop me!”
The group stopped off at a magical creature shop to see if anything could be done for Scabbers and so Hermione could look for an owl that she had been wanting. As Hermione headed to the back of the shop off in search of a sale’s assistant, Harry went with Ron to the counter.
Filch marched them straight to Professor McGonagall who was still dealing with Malfoy. Out of bed, alone at the tallest astronomy tower, which was way out of bounds, plus the invisibility cloak and a dragon, yeah, they might as
Harry heard Percy Ron’s brother yelling frantically to Gryffindor house, while Flint tried his best to sort the Slytherins into a line. Harry knew it was now or never. As far as he knew Millicent was still out there. Ducking his head down, he joined a group of excited looking Hufflepuffs moving toward the direction of what Harry thought was the closest girl’s bathroom.
The wall behind him slowly started to creak open. Harry stepped back with the rest of the first years. Apparently no one was expecting exactly this. The Slytherin common room was big and well lit, candles and torches were bright
“Do you know why Quirrell couldn’t touch you? Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own
“Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,” he said. “Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself?” Snape walked by then, making sure that Harry and Ron had sufficiently helped Malfoy, thus shutting Malfoy’s mouth.
“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a better look. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.”
“Is it you?” he asked once more before all hell broke loose. Draco tried to turn and run, but Harry got both his hands on him before he could pivot an inch in that direction. Draco pulled, desperate to get his hands out of Harry’s grip, but Harry was not going to let him go. No wands. Just bodies.
“Potter!” said Snape, suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
Snape was waiting for him outside the entrance to the common room. Harry barely saw him as he went to utter the password, but Snape stepped seemingly out of the shadows and in front of him.
This is not a sequel, merely a retelling from Harry's point of view. I hope that it sheds a little light onto Harry's thought processes.
“No,” Harry muttered as his mother kissed his cheek and his father bent down to hold him. “I’ve never seen them before this. My aunt and uncle don’t have any pictures of them, they never have.”
“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,” said Fred, with a mysterious wink. “Come in here….”
He forced himself to think of Sirius, and only Sirius, and began to chant, “Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!”
Harry immediately fell into Ron’s arms and began sobbing right along with the other man. Somewhere in their joint cries, Draco heard Harry say, “Yes, of course, of course, we will.” Ron, smart enough to see through Harry’s enthusiasm in agreeing for the both of them, looked over his head at Draco. The hopeful look on his face brightened into a full blown smile when Draco firmly nodded his head.
In Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Moody announced that he would be putting each of them under the imperious curse, to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects. A few people looked like they were about to interject while a few looked down right sick.
“Okay!” he shouted loudly after Potter’s retreating figure. Still unsure if he heard him or not Draco knew he had to get home. Luna had invited him out with the “crew” that night. So he had to make it home to get ready because there was no way he was going to
“What you did was irresponsible. You could have killed Ms. Bulstrode with your hero antics. As it stands, Gryffindor has 312 points, Hufflepuff 352, Ravenclaw 426 and my house has 472, but for your behavior and
The letter went something like this, “Wasn’t sure if you were aware, but the Triwizard Tournament is happening at Hogwarts, and I got picked as the fourth champion. I’m going up against three seventh years, Viktor Krum Quidditch seeker for Bulgaria, a witch who looks like a daisy but could also kill you. Oh, and the other Hogwarts champion is a fellow Slytherin. Malfoy now thinks he’s my best friend. Send my love to Remus.
Harry, who was busy looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?”
Ely and Warrington were sitting at one of the nearby tables. Both were seventh years and always seemed to be studying for their NEWTS that were quickly approaching. Harry doubted he could handle that pressure on top of being a champion himself. Which was all the more reason that he had to tell them.
“But what if I’d given Harry to him, eh? I bet he’d’ve pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes’ friends son! But when a wizard goes over ter the dark Side, there’s nothing, and no one that matters to ‘em anymore….”
Then, in a matter of moments, he was on the hippogriff’s back and they were soaring. They landed with a thud, and the rest of the students approached them.
“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,” he said. “I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. “Pity sugar makes it useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering.
Then a rustling in the woods drew their attention, and Winky the house elf made her way into their field of vision.
“Are you planning to sleep at all this year, Hermione?” asked Harry, as they walked on. Hermione had gotten some birthday money and had wanted to stop off and see about getting herself an owl. Harry knew of Ron’s family’s trip to Egypt this summer, apparently Mr. Weasley had won something at the Ministry, but he didn’t know that the trip had worn out Ron’s rat, Scabbers.
Upon looking at one Dolores Umbridge new DADA teacher, one would think that her room would be covered in floor to ceiling patterned wall paper, dollies, with a record player in the corner that played an endless loop of human screams, but it was surprisingly minimalistic. It was almost as if she didn’t want you to be distracted. You were to look at her, and only at her. The only ornamentation in the room was a blackboard that had OWLs written on it. Harry only hoped that her skills as a teacher were better than her wardrobe choices. He already had one over done witch to deal with, he didn’t need another.
“House elves is not supposed to have fun Harry Potter,” said Winky. “House elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter,” she glanced towards the edge of the box and gulped---“, but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir, to save his seat. Winky is a good house elf, Harry Potter, sir.”
“No,” Harry answers, too quickly by the look on Remus’s face. He couldn’t explain it to anyone that asked, but accepting help from Remus and accepting help from Sirius felt different. Perhaps it had to do with Remus being his former professor or maybe it was because with Sirius everything was so personal. He didn't want Sirius to see him weak, but with Remus, he knew that this man knew what it was like to be at your lowest and still want the world to know you're fine.
From the molding on the floor to the gold gilding on the ceiling the room radiated wealth. Harry had read the print on the sheets on his bed, and wasn’t surprised to find some French script that he couldn’t interpret beyond, “More than most people make in a year”. Harry wasn’t bothered by the excess of wealth though he certainly wasn’t used to such things at the Dursleys. Harry rolled over onto his back. He wasn’t thinking of them. He wasn’t. He had put them into the past, but he was still having some trouble sleeping.
Warrington was standing near Bagman listening to the man’s constant chatter. Warrington’s eyes passed quickly over Harry as if he weren’t there but Bagman quickly excused himself from Warrington’s presence and bounded toward Harry.
Sirius it seemed was making himself well at home, lounging comfortably on a chaise in the living room. An elf was nearby fanning him slightly with a wide, elaborate fan. Remus was standing anxiously near the front door with Harry and Blaise as the group waited for the entrance of Madam Zabini, the black widow herself, otherwise known as Blaise’s mom.
“I don’t know what that word means, but I do know that she is far better a wizard than you. It was like dancing with a piece of bamboo. Not to mention trying to talk with one.”
Then, Harry lunged at Black and the two fell to the ground in a heap. No one bothered to use magic, the only thing that had any importance at all was getting his hands around Black’s neck.
“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on—I’ll see what Professor Snape has to say about you.”
“It’s a wrench, giving it to you,” said Fred. “, but we decided last night, your need is greater than ours.”
Shocked silence filled the hall, as Cedric Diggory nearly rose to his feet to accept his spot before realizing that his name had not been called. Silence filled the Great Hall until Cassius rose to his feet, ushered into motion by the pleased looking boy that sat beside him. Then Harry’s table erupted into applause and cheers so loud that it made up for the fact that a few people were decidedly not clapping. Warrington followed Krum on his way to wait for further instructions. A few people were looking around in concern and astonishment. But Hogwarts had their champion and plenty were thrilled that at least Warrington was the same size as Krum if the tasks required something physical. Harry thought he might stand a fair chance. It’d be fun to root for someone from his own house anyway.
Thank you all for reading and commenting. I appreciate all the feedback, love, and support. Things are about to get deep so put your scuba gear on.
They found their beds, six four-posters hung with deep Slytherin green velvet curtains lined the room. On the side of the room Harry head a swoosh, the sound drawing his attention. A huge carved out space took a large portion out of the side of the far wall. It was like the window in the main room, the lake was right through the glass.
“Oh no,” said Blaise. “Dobby is too far gone. He doesn’t want to be house elf anymore, but Winky’s just lost her family, I’m merely looking out for her best interests. And my mother is extraordinarily kind to loyal house elves like Winky.”
“Ha!” Nott cheered, and Harry noticed that Professor Lupin also forgot his “Well done,” as Harry stepped up. There was silence as the boggart tried a few different shapes, not seeming to know what would frighten him the most. Harry noticed Professor Lupin eyeing him wearily before the boggart finally seemed to “decide” and turned into Harry’s most recent nightmare. A dementor.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection looked very strained. “Black’s not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It’s the Azkaban guards who’ll get him back, you mark my words.”
He never even gave him the chance to be considered an option. Draco had always been non-descript and while he knew to the letter what kind of person Harry wanted to spend his life with. Draco knew then and he knew now as Harry sat stone cold and wide mouthed on his living room floor that it was never going to be him, despite the mark on his side that was a perfect match for Harry’s.
Harry nodded. He could wait. He had waited this long for a real family and a real life, he could wait a little longer if it meant that he could have this.
Harry opened the note slowly, avoiding the prying eyes of more than just Blaise. His housemates seemed ambivalent to him at the best of times, but while a few people from the other houses were downright staring at him, he didn’t miss the new look on the Slytherin’s faces.
“What?” asked Draco unsure if Harry was actually speaking to him or not. Harry turned to face him. Ron Weasley had called them, Hermione was in labor again, nearly a year and half after her first miscarriage. Now, Draco, Harry and the rest of the Weasleys were all crowded into the waiting room.
“Sorry, I had to wait for Goyle to go to sleep. He’s normally out like a light, but it seemed like he was waiting for something tonight.”
“The loo,” Draco answers. Perhaps, that second drink was a little too much for him. Draco, while an excellent auror partner has always been a piss poor drinking buddy.
“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield the information you conceal!”
staring at the crumpled, prestigious robes, willing his skin to stop crawling. It was only Harry’s face in his fire that stirred him.
Pansy was throwing them at Buckbeak, making him move from his spot and into the forest. She managed it in just enough time to see the executioner and the others rush out of the house.
Halloween, it all made sense. Snape wasn’t going to steal the stone. He had suspected Quirrell all along.
A roar of outrage erupted in the Great Hall, but Dumbledore quickly silenced the shouting with a look. The Great Hall was dismissed shortly after and everyone filled with excitement headed to bed.
A stunned and giggling Angelina was then pulled into his arms and the two took off where Angelina and her former partner who was now dealing with smoke coming from his pants left off.
Harry loved interrogating suspects. While he was never in Slytherin, he only had that part of himself to blame that loved to watch criminals squirm under the weight of his power until they gave up everything that they knew. At the start, people were less than enthused about Harry and Draco’s partnership. But as far as he was concerned, he and Draco were a perfect match.
Going off of Hermione’s detailed list they set to work. Madame Pince the librarian was quick to shoo him out of the restricted section, but since that train was leaving the next day they hardly had any time at all to try to figure out the mystery of Nicholas Flamel.
“Thank Salazar,” said Crabbe rising to leave with his master, commander, and owner. But Draco simply raised the letter in his hands.
Harry had noticed some slight changes in himself now that he was no longer under the Dursley’s care. He was slightly taller, though not much, and he now filled out his clothes. He had had a haircut, which Sirius had assured him looked stylish, carelessly roguish whatever that meant. He felt secure in himself. So secure that he had danced and shamelessly flirted with that guy at the Zabini’s party. No, not that guy, Malfoy. He had to separate the two of them in his mind because that’s what they were, separate.
“Be warned, Potter…any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure that you are expelled. Slytherin has a reputation to uphold after all. Good day to you.”
Potter choosing that moment to turn and look at him. Draco pulled his hands behind his back like they were on fire and that was the only way to put them out.
“He speaks,” the same man said. “Wasn’t sure if you’d be able to after Murray here got through with you, but….”
“Oh, yeah,” she said, touching her hair like she had forgotten that it had changed at all. “My mother nearly had a coronary, but it was almost time for school anyway so I figured why not. I know it’s not blowing up my aunt, but a little bit of teenage rebellion never killed anyone, yet,” she smiled and Harry laughed.
At that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start their fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasley’s youngest child and only girl, Ginny. Ginny waved at Harry, while Percy walked straight over to Harry and took his hand.
“I asked you whether you want me to do that again?” said Voldemort softly, speaking of the last cruciatus. “Answer me! Imperio!”
At the start of term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. Harry knew by the end of that first Potions lesson that he had been wrong, it wasn’t dislike, it was hatred.
“All those Veela genes are probably just trying to figure out why on Earth you’re attracted to Weasley. Must defy all the laws of nature that she knows.”
Recently, he even came back smiling, clearly pleased with his efforts, and Harry had rarely ever seen Flint smile. It was weird.
“Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next?” Madame Pomfrey said as she checked him over.
Harry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes as he fought to remember that Sirius was innocent….
Winky had heard everything, and Harry couldn’t shake the sound of her tears as she learned that the little boy she once loved was no longer the person sitting in front of her as she listened to his confession.
“It was hardly Malfoy’s fault,” said Millicent. “It seemed as if Hagrid was just too quick to jump into the deep end.”
“But when I went home for Christmas and asked to see her my mother got this odd look on her face. She took me by the hand, and let me outside. I wondered why Mrs. Tizzy was in the garden. It was too cold, but I would bring her inside and I could tell her all about Draco and how he wasn’t the an underbelly brat anymore like she once thought he was. But my mother led me to a part of the grounds that I had been forbidden to go to before then.”
“This”, said Flint. “is the Golden Snich, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s fast and difficult to see, and you have to catch it before the other team’s seeker does. Whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. The game ends when the Snitch is caught. Three months is the record, but I would expect any of my players to beat that if it mean getting a win.”
Harry and Ron had come up with a brilliant plan to plot their demises in new and creative ways to appease Trewlaney, but there was no easy way out for them with the essays they had to write for Professor Binns about the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century. While Harry’s head of house Professor Snape was forcing them to research antidotes for a mystery test that Harry was sure was going to involve a poisoning at some point in the future. While Professor Flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charms.
All the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term. Professor McGonagall had given them an explanation.
Neville fought the urge to clutch Harry’s robe as he made a sort of choking noise. Hagrid came out of his hut, striding toward them in the dark, Fang at his heels. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of
“You’d know about that wouldn’t you Higgs,” said Pucey. “With as many times as you let the Quaffle past you last practice, you should be an expert by now.”
Harry looked around, but no one else was stopping. Then from across the hall, Harry heard, “Slytherins always do betray their own kind.”
“They’re together,” Draco clarified. “Ely and Warrington, Warrington and Ely, they’re together, boyfriend and boyfriend til Warrington’s father has Ely murdered and then marries Cass off to a lovely Slytherin Pureblood with a vagina. Until then McGovern pulls that leash though I haven’t heard Warrington complaining. And anyone who messes with Warrington has Ely to deal with.”
“Yes,” said Bagman. “The man knows over two hundred languages, and I really need him to help me with a troll delegate right about now, but I seem to have lost him.”
“All the kid’s will probably just walk right on by it. It won’t be anything special to them. You remember how we were in school, we didn’t pay attention to anything.”
“How are my parent’s memory involved in this exactly? Or perhaps are you that bad of a journalist that you can’t actually fill a page with the topic that you were assigned?” Harry asked, channeling the Malfoy heir for the first and only time in his life.
“One more thing,” said Snape. “Three of my students claimed to have heard what sounded like a werewolf in the forest near the Skrieking Shack this afternoon. Would you know anything about that?”
“Ha, ha,” said Ron. Draco had once again found himself at The Weasley’s ancestral home, otherwise known as the Burrow, this time for George and Angelina’s engagement party. Draco wondered briefly to whom Molly Weasley had sold her soul to have had so many of her children find their marks at such an early age. Ron and Hermione. George and Angelina. The Weaslette and Blaise of all people. Even Percy Weasley had been hopping around Neville Longbottom as of late. Bill had Fleur and several amazingly gorgeous children. Draco was even sure the dragon tamer had a mark mate. Why else would one move to Romania?
Harry watched the figure slyly as the young figure moved in his direction. Harry thought briefly that it might be someone with nefarious intent before putting that thought aside. It was fine. He wasn’t Harry Potter now. No one could see his face or know his identity. He was James no last name. He didn’t need one, not tonight.
Harry was almost out into the open, when he was once again left with an arm full of Malfoy. Harry looked up into the blonde’s face that was white as a sheet except for the red slash across his cheek. They both looked up in time to see Millicent throw another hex at Malfoy’s head. They rolled together as one behind the curtain. Hermione stepped in front of Millicent.
At the end of the meal, Draco and Pansy rose from the table, and ushered all of the first years from the hall. Harry had watched him as he stood. It was okay then because everyone was looking. There was nothing wrong with looking at Malfoy, he told himself. Malfoy didn’t realize that it was Harry that he had danced with or said those things to.
“You should have realized Peter, that if Voldemort didn’t kill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter,” said Lupin.
“M-m-master…”Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch, her eyes brimming with tears. “Mmmmaster, please.”
“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius. This boy who was supposedly my downfall. He was protected by his mother’s sacrifice…an old kind of magic I had not foreseen. I could not touch the boy. I was foolish to overlook such ancient magic, but no matter,” Voldemort said approaching Harry. “Because I can touch him now.”
