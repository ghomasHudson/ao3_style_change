He’s got white roses (Harry’s favorite flower for merlin knows what reason) and chocolate cake and a promise ring.
At least I don’t spend my time wiggling my wand at Bogarts!”
Draco takes a deep breath, brushes off his dark slacks, and pushes open the door.
if we had met irl I’d definitely be ur friend
Draco looks at him curiously and then smiles.
: was gonna say blue oops
no and its going to stay that way
I opened my mouth to say something but I realized I didn't know what to say.  "Thank you, Narcissa."
Well.
“Merlin, you have the balancing skills of a three-legged stag.
RONALD IF YOU DON’T START WINDING UP THE VACUUM CORD I’LL STRANGLE YOU WITH IT
He’s wandering around and helping his students when he first starts.
"Oh godddd... Harry..." And then he froze.
i have officially work off the hangover and have eaten
: draco’s not here to defend himself either hehehe
Harry fumes, putting his head in his hands, only to pull back when he pulls out even more hair.
Turns out Harry never outgrew his knack for procrastination [what a mood].
I guided one of his hands to his dick and made him jack off.  "What's my name?"
excuse me
He opens the door to Ron Weasley, looking annoyed and desperate at the same time.
: it never is
“Never, Potter!”
: MATE
: hello draco!
I fume.
Thanks.
Nothing logical.
: akshsksj
Politely.”
“Malfoy, I’m a professor.
The rest of the evening goes by without incident, and Draco is content to move on with his life.
i hate to say this but
The man gestures for Draco to follow him to the bag of clay, pulling out a hefty chunk.
“What the fuck do you want, Weasley?”
Smiling, Harry says, “Have you got a date to the wedding yet?”
But then he hears Draco laugh, and he knows that this is the only option.
A Cheering Charm only serves to make you happy, not help your body to stay happy.”
“There is absolutely nothing stopping me from hexing you right now, Potter.”
good choice
now continue
He wants to keep talking to Harry and spending time with him, for whatever strange reason.
"Draco!"  Harry shouted, before pushing me out of the way of a falling bookcase.  It crashed to the floor with a bang, causing dust to poof off of it.  I was in his arms again.  Dammit.  But i made no effort to pull away.
I used to think of Potter and only recall of how much I hated how perfect he was… I later realized that was called envy, a trait I didn’t know I could possess.
hey!”
: who’s this
I hate you all
Draco tries very hard not to think about his depression.
What are you doing here?”
Harry grins and teases Draco, but in the back of his mind, he can’t stop trying to remember where he’d smelled that scent before.
DRACO
It’s concise, and he obviously isn’t used to apologizing, but it’s a gesture of kindness all the same.
Crap.  I walked into the wrong door.  And now I was walking the wrong way through Ikea.  Just shoot me already.
tho i might be biased, i’m in a similar situation
: yeah the karaoke was quite a show
The itching.
There’s no pattern in it, nothing upon which to base a prediction.
UHHHH GUYS
He doesn't feel the waves hitting his ankles, or the sand between his toes, or the salty ocean breeze.
It’s a very complicated bit of charm work that needs to be done, and he even reached out to Professor Flitwick for assistance, despite the concerned looks he received because of it.
The sound gets Draco’s heart stuck in his throat, and he finds himself giving a small smile as well.
And as if their luck couldn’t get any worse, half the Hufflepuff house emerges into the hallway.
i will
“What?”
The flurry of unspoken words and restless emotions hangs heavily in the air between them, and
: did u mean it or was that just drunk talk
Sitting at the counter, Draco adds, “How was your night?  Sorry I got in late.”
“Perfect!
“C’mon, there’s obviously summin’ there.”
His daytime brainstorm is fruitless, and the evening is filled with other distractions.
Still frowning, Harry says slowly, “I don’t like Draco dating other people and I don’t known why?”  The four look at him expectantly and he shakes his head.  “Guys what am I missing?”
: THIS IS GOLD
As we talked, I discovered that the reason she added 'Black' to her last name is because, though she still loves her husband, she doesn't enjoy the baggage that comes with being just a Malfoy. So she became a 'Black-Malfoy'. Draco didn't want any connection to his father so he changed his last name to simply 'Black'.
: [one image]
this is one of the longest conversations we’ve had in this chat for a while now
“Alright…”
AND IIIIIIIIIIIII-EE-IIIIIIII WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOUUUUUUUUU
“No, no.
Just as Harry is pulling open the door, McGonagall says, “Oh, and Mr. Potter?  Welcome home.”
Draco pulls away slightly to breathe, mumbling, “What took you so long?”
Harry scrambles to follow him so he doesn’t get lost, admiring Malfoy’s confident but relaxed strides.
: wut
Can you come back to us, Harry?” Luna finishes, rubbing the raven-haired boy’s temples.
: we had sex...
Dean chuckles, “Me too.”
: i’m not sure i wanna know
: cuz i can also wear that red one from the other night but idk
“Yeah, but you never do anything about it, so you can’t really mind that much, huh?”
He never wants to stop smelling it.
: never had anyone say that to me before
Then…
: every time ‘mione does that I get whiplash
: they saw me karaoke. there’s no going back after that
Draco sighs.
: ouch
: i’ll talk to some people and make sure it stays under wraps alright?
He dashes out of the bathroom, ignoring the part of him that wanted to stay put and let Harry catch him, and sprints down the hall.
“Now what about the people that don’t play Quidditch?
: they haven’t messaged the chat in a while, so u think they’re alive
Harry looks bashful. “I think I might’ve come in here last night... I was pretty drunk... sorry.”
“I see you decided to forgo wearing a shirt this morning,” Draco says, pouring himself a cup of coffee.
: oooohh so ur attractive 😏 jk
: this is hilarious
Draco constantly complains about it, wishing there were just constant warming charms around the castle, but he doesn’t actually do anything about it.
: try again in a few days, he’s not likely to go back two days in a row
"You were a muggle, you should know the place.  Quality furniture, only place I go.  Well, other than- never mind."
Wait.
After dinner, I made sure mum was comfortable and I went up to my room to do some work for my Auror training.  After all the wrong I did, I at least want to make an effort to do good.
Not that Draco would ever admit that he’s shorter.
: good to know
Where’d Draco go?
: wow he really was drunk that night
Draco feels himself nod and reach out to rebundle the clay in his hands, but his heart isn’t in the same place.
“Ugh! Why is everything with you about sex!” I exclaim, blushing for the umpteenth time and wishing I had taken the red-eye flight instead.
: and what happens when they give ME shit?
: uhhhh
: do u text?
"Ah, well, you've got to come back sometime. If you've got to go that's alright, Draco should be home soon anyways."
: and suddenly i’m afraid
off of them, smiling.  The place could be called home after a few renovations and some final spells to cleanse the place of the Dark Magic left behind.
: yeah ik but it’s the only thing we have and he won’t eat it
Harry makes sure to lay out the necessary ingredients behind Draco, on the desk, so that Draco is forced to turn around to retrieve something and won’t notice when Harry pulls his prank.
“Well, I can leave if you’d like.
UFCKING
Give him a break.
I smiled wickedly and adjusted so my cock was near his and we were kissing.  Then I grabbed the lube again and clumsily slathered my cock and his entrance.
They stand in awkward silence, looking anywhere but each other’s eyes.
I sighed and my shoulders drooped and I walked out.
Whoever created it managed to make the water look so dynamic that Draco wonders if it's really ceramic at all.
Harry laughs so hard he inhales a bit of muffin and falls into a coughing fit, only recovering after Draco pounds his fist on his back a couple of times.
With that, Harry leaves the classroom, and Draco sighs.
He didn't need to tell me twice.  I pulled out and positioned my hard cock that was dripping with precum.  I slowly started to push in.  it took a minute, but I was all the way inside him.  I almost came just at the feeling of his tight walls around me.
It was a close game, but Harry knows he’s going to have so much fun holding this over Draco’s head.
lavender and royal purple for sure
“Hm?”
Wait.
Anyway, after that extremely awkward encounter, I went into my bedroom to start studying again. My internship at St. Mungos came with a catch: I could work there and get paid but I had to study whatver my host that week wanted me to.
They chuckled and agreed, and I got my glass of juice and headed for the stairs.
You tailor suits, right?”
: i need to know who ur out to
And it doesn’t come out when he tugs anymore!
I have an idiot best friend and a life worth of regrets
Harry remembers that Neville works here as the Herbology Professor and it hits him that Hogwarts was just as much a home for him as it was for Harry…
: why does this sound so sus
"Maybe I'm just trying to find excuses to be in your arms, as you have so graciously let me be now," I flirted, raising my arms so they were around his neck.
“Nah ah ah, a magician never reveals his secrets.”
sighs
He’d better hurry.
Draco deadpans.
McGonagall loves her children, after all.
SCROLL UP OMG OMG OMG
: ugh fine
: the caps was bothering me
now any time you get uncomfortable just let me know and we can leave, but at least try to be friendly k? for me?
Pretty impressive.”
you watch far too much sherlock
✴︎✴︎✴︎
: uhm i think
Something like eucalyptus and maybe rain?
He smiled that gorgeous, radiant smile and answered, "I'd say absolutely, my love."
: AHDGAJ RON WTF
Harry really does have a nice laugh.
As if on cue, Harry walked into the house.
Glancing at the front of the store, it seems his wish has been granted!
: this is why we’re friends harry
“Oh, makes sense.
“What are you going to get?” Draco asks as Harry hails the waitress.
: done
: if i try to move i will spontaneously combust
: what
Harry holds the thick paper in his hands and reads ‘Professor Potter’ off of the top corner.
An entire week of school has gone by with Potter as a teacher, and not a single thing has gone wrong yet.
: SKSHAKJS
“Potter?”
“And you couldn’t apparate?”
“Merlin, you scared the living daylights out of me!
: okay 1) hes not out yet and idk if that includes pansy
: damn, i didn’t think they’d actually do it
Harry beams.
“Alright, alright,” Harry says, feeling like he’s on cloud nine.
“So, the lesson is don’t meddle with love potions unless your job specifically deals with it or you absolutely have to.
: whoop whoop!
“I won’t be breaking them this year.”
With a look of sadness in her eyes, she told me, "We broke up about a year after the war.  Turns out, women aren't his type."
okay harry
You buy me coffee.”
“Your hair looks no different when you’re awake than after you’ve been sleeping for ten hours,” Draco says, attempting to be endearing. Obviously, it doesn’t work, because Harry gives him a look and detaches himself from the blonde man.
: oh come now it’s not that bad
: uhhhh he just said he likes u and he knows u like him so now u ASK HIM OUT
: AKSHAKSH
It sounds incredibly boring, but Draco takes comfort in repetition.
“Uhm.”
: i wouldn’t go that far...
And then Draco leans in and closes the gap, their lips meeting in a soft kiss.
: yeah fs
: really that’s the part of that text you choose to focus on
He’s not ashamed that he cried, he just doesn’t do it very often anymore, so it feels strange.
human
Now he’s gone and ruined the best thing in his life.
"Shut up," I laughed.
“You see the bits of gold in my eyes?
: i’m not even gonna question how you knew which ship i was reading but Y E S
: draco love it’s all right!
"I can't believe you two bet on us!" Hermione said playfully.
He hasn’t felt this strongly about something since the Battle of Hogwarts… he doesn’t know what to do.
aw cmon mione u know u love us
“Draco Malfoy, what in Merlin’s name do you think you’re- oh, Potter, you too?”
Harry chuckles, making Draco’s heart do little flips.
Harry blushes and looks at the ground rather sheepishly.
“Well, it’s July, so there’s no school, and McGonagall is Headmistress and she loves me-”
: she’s got you there man
I hate how happy that makes me.
There she was.
: AJSJSKDKDHS
It’s a vase, shaped like water rushing down a waterfall.
: so u gonna tell me
: *blushing emoji*
Harry sighs.
: MATE WTF
“You know this is considered breaking and entering, right?” He growls.
He hadn’t meant to reveal his Tragic Backstory™ to Malfoy.
Are you offering me breakfast?” Harry looks hopeful and confused, which further messes with Draco’s mind.
: ugh they’re gone
He looks at me for a few moments longer and then says, “So are you gonna start reading or not?”
ofc im right
He looked up at me desperately and said "Daddy.  You're my daddy.  Please don't stop fucking me daddy oh god I wanna cum!"
I meant-”
Harry laughs again, and Draco wears a poorly-concealed smile.
"Thank you, Draco.  I love you."
: guys?
“Where did you get a bottle of nair?”
: ya those
"I must get on with my day, but I feel such relief in talking to you and thanking  you.  Goodbye Harry."
: harry you’re never allowed to throw a party ever again
I was on my 0th shot, as I hated most hard liquor unless I was stressed.  And honestly, someone has to be the designated apparatee.   But watching Draco get drunk was worth the abstinence.
Draco smiles.
: at least smt good came from the alcohol yesterday
We’re just… friends.
“He definitely likes you back.” The whole table turned to face Ron.
You’re just too… boring for my taste.”
Harry doesn’t respond, focusing more on setting the action to 'toilet transfiguration'.
remind me never to doubt your knowledge ever again
Well, at least one of my questions was answered.
: im stealing him
ANYWAY
I sigh. No, I can’t apparate. I’ve never been taught.
I do neither.
this is bullying
We were all instructed to wear ‘butterfly colors’, whatever that means.
: they won’t hurt us!
Harry is a tall man.
YOU TELL EM MIONE
Or something.
He convinces himself its because he needs more yarn, but anyone with two eyes can tell he’s looking for Draco.
He’s acting perfectly normal.
Harry raises and eyebrow and says, “I can think of lots of ways you could keep me entertained…” and I instantly regret asking.
Sit at the wheel across from me, and I’ll show you what to do.”
Oh merlin, Harry is in trouble.
Draco smirks, mumbling proudly, “I got it a few weeks back, after your sour patch kids prank.
Whatever the reason, he responds, ~
: oh god
Draco exists first, turning to see if Harry is behind him and hears him say, “Headmistress… if it’s any consolation, I think we have gotten over our rivalry from school.
it takes like ten extra seconds!
AND HE AND HIS LITTLE ARSEHOLE BUDDIES LOOKED REALLY PROUD OF THEMSELVES AND THEY WERE SNIGGERING SO I
Maybe this fake-dating thing was a bad idea... he wasn’t supposed to develop
When Harry pushes open the door to the craft shoppe, he prays that anyone other than Malfoy is working the register.
Draco takes a hurried step back, putting on a smile and turning around.
“Machine broke?” Potter asks.
Now Draco is laughing with him.
Despite his mind telling him he should be wary, his gut says that this is going to be a good year.
: wait r u saying he likes me too
: i can finally wear my murder suit :)
He goes back the next day to pick up a few more colors, just to keep around, and Draco isn’t there.
The floors are cold, after all.
Harry’s face falls.
Harry smirks and licks his lip, staring Draco directly in the eyes which Draco’s insides turn to jelly.
He rests his hands lightly on Harry’s shoulders, cocking his head to the side and grinning.
The rest of the evening continues with them planning food - Draco wants the food to be fancy but Harry convinces him that ‘it’s quidditch, we need sports food’ - decorations, and times.
: •_•
probably because it was at 2 in the morning
oh boy
If I Stop Reacting Will Harry Stop Making Flustering Sexual Remarks, the third in the biographical series.
Of course, this draws Potter’s attention toward me, and we lock eyes.
oh fuck
: especially you potter
“Excuse you, I am not afraid of talking to you.
: speaking of where we are, where am i?
: we uh
See a doctor?” Harry asks, upon being told.
“I’m not gonna lie, I thought you two were already dating when you bought an apartment together,” Neville says, much to Harry’s surprise.
He frowns and turns to look at what he sat on.
: again?
How do I handle this
"Harry... come back..."
“Great!
“But if you left, who would be here to entertain me with their tendency to get covered in clay?”
"Slow down, Draco.  We've got stuff to do tomorrow, remember?"
: omg finally a smart person arrives in this group chat!
: AHAHAHAHAH
Narcissa Malfoy.
The small step Harry takes brings them even closer, and Draco can feel Harry's breath on his blushing cheeks.
: how dare you
: ballroom fancy = i’m meeting the queen, the minister of magic, and michelle obama all at the same time plus i wanna feel like a goddess
The snitch gets away, though, and the game continues.
: i was also joking
“That’d be great!
avocado toast
: IM GONNA KILL YOU POTTER
: because it came out of YOUR stomach
Draco cackles, bending over and clutching his stomach.
He walks down the hall to where Harry’s room is and meets eyes with Ron.
"Makes sense. If you make it, do let me know. I'd love to hear about your career as I had once considered becoming a transfiguration professor myself!"
Harry harrumphs and plops down into the chair across from Draco, running a hand through his wind-swept hair.
Instantly, Harry is taken back to his years playing as Gryffindor seeker at Hogwarts.
we’d never judge you?
Can you come fix the machine again?” He calls over his shoulder.
No, I didn’t think so.
He doesn’t feel whoever wraps a towel around him and sits him in front of the fire.
“Mhm.
: mood
Draco needs to get his head in the game.
Helps with this,” he says, raising his hands to show that they’re shaking.
: no we’ve solved my problem, i’ll keep going back to the shop
Ron smiles.
“It’s okay now.
: no but smt doesn’t feel right
He whirls around angrily, coming face-to-face with one Harry Potter who’s standing unnervingly close to him.
“Shut it.”
I've been thinking about how I could’ve never noticed that potter and his friends are so much fun
[do crime but smart, 10:54 AM, Friday]
: no my life is interesting
“Ugh!” Draco huffs and walks to his seat at the table.
: do u expect us to talk constantly
: oi!
I looked at him blankly. "Draco, I'm gay."
: IM LITERALLY YOUR FIANCÉE
—— 7.5 hours later. ——
: ur our brother
He bids the woman goodbye, thanking her for helping, and makes the executive decision to cast a (mildly illegal) tracking spell.
I think im platonically engaged to harry potter
“Here are your attendance lists and class schedules for this semester,” McGonagall says, handing a bound folder to each staff member.
You’re pretty hard not to notice,” Harry says nervously.
else ill start realistically considering Theo’s suggestion
“That’s a load of hippogriffshit.
sorry I dropped my phone in time to catch my cat, mid-air, before he jumped into the toilet bowl full of FUCKING BLEACH
See ya!” Harry says, heading out the door.
Okay, uh- see you tomorrow then!”
“Yes!
He didn’t know what to do.
Silky fabric slips through Draco’s fingers as he hangs it on the clothes rack.
“He- he bloody loves you, mate.”
His hands barely shake anymore.
Harry only chuckles lightly, a sound that makes Draco’s knees weak.
Then, biting his lip and inhaling, he laces his fingers between Harry’s and continues walking.
I shut it.
Harry gives a small smile.
: yes ronald that was intentional
romantic????
You told me that last time.
harry it’s the middle of the week
This is not at all how he expected to ask Draco out, but he’s not complaining.
But not emotionally.”
It hurts like the cruciatus curse.
: potter i left like 2 hours ago
: srsly harry no
: shush i know you’re queer on some level and you like men because it’s really obvious and Luna’s gaydar is never wrong
: pay up
uhhhh dragon? U good
I immediately wish I hadn’t.
: besties 🤞 4life
I’m bloody starving!”
“Potter, you don’t have a clue what’s going on.
, Darrington.”
“I wasn’t following you, nitwit, I just wanted to relax.
: i’ve had a huge crush on you since 4th year and just didn’t realize it cuz i thought i was straight
"Oh thank you dear. Draco helped me pick it out."
Maybe it’s a good thing that I took this flight, and maybe it’s a good thing that Harry was on it too.
: this is heterophobia
“Malfoy, I swear to Merlin, I’ll hex you into the next century!
Now shut it, I’m trying to read.
"Well, we have to unshrink stuff, and move it, and assemble it all, and I'm too tired for that," I replied lazily.
However, I distinctly remember leaving you in the guest bedroom but I woke up this morning and you were octopussing me, so there’s that,” he teases lightly.
: FUCK YEAH
His heart definitely does not skip a beat when he receives a note back less than two hours later.
But Harry doesn’t intimidate Malfoy in the slightest, because when the blond looks up from his breakfast and catches sight of Harry, he chokes on the piece of toast he’s eating.
im English
Harry has discovered that he really doesn’t like it when Draco goes brings home his one-night stands.  He doesn’t like it when Draco goes on dates, either, but it’s worse when someone comes home with him.  He always gets this awkward feeling, like he’s angry and triggered.
the fact that those were your first guesses is incredibly concerning
: merlin there’s more?!
: nothing happened lol
“Well, glad you’re back then… I’ll be off.
He didn’t mean to upset him.
He’s got to come up with something perfectly mediocre and embarrassing so that Harry absolutely will not expect anything more serious in the coming months.
: POTTER YOU BASTARD IM NOT OUT YET
“Harry, I don’t… I can’t say I have feelings for you.”
We moved around the kitchen, not avoiding each other but also not making an effort to interact.
: closer to 6 hours but yes
Draco Malfoy is coming home with me?  The snobbish, arrogant, ferret of a man?  What a day."
You seem to be making a lot, so…” Draco shrugs, almost bashfully.
The moment I opened the window, the owl swooped in, did a lap around my apartment, and came back and landed on my outstretched arm.
"Don't fret, Harry.  We're friends.  I don't care that you're not wearing pants or that you slept with my son."
: so when u gonna take me on our first date
I don’t want this-” he gestures to the two of them, “- to end.”
"No.  I don't wanna hear your dumb excuses.  This whole thing was a mistake anyway.  Don't count on seeing me anymore."
After a while, both teams are tied at 200 points and the snitch has yet to be caught.
And there’s nothing.
Afterwards, I plan to move to America and do a similar internship over there in the wizarding community. Then, I'm going to get a job at whatever hospital I want. It's going to be amazing.
“Uh, mate, the goal is to not be homophobic,” Ron says and Harry nods sadly and takes another gulp of his beer.
im not often wrong
“Congratulations, you aren’t a total idiot.”
: no, you have a problem
Any walls he’d had up before are gone now, leaving only the raw, emotional man underneath.
Once he gets to the podium, the man is standing awkwardly next to it, looking at himself in the mirror with a funny expression.
i think if harry likes him he should go after him
: thanks
: ok that was a little aggressive but i’ll be helping him
I got whatever I wanted, so if I was going to wear a dress then that’s just how it was going to be.
He drank the potion and I cast a warming spell on his soup.  Then I leaned over and kissed his forehead.  But I hesitated before pulling away.  I put my fingertips underneath his chin and guided his head slightly upwards so I could kiss him for what would probably be the last time.  He'd never want to kiss me again, I'm sure.  So I made this one last.  It was gentle.  It was sweet.  He kissed back a tiny bit... or maybe that was my imagination.  Whichever it was, I knew I was in trouble.  I was starting to love Draco Malfoy.
Is there really a chance Harry could take him back?
Draco gets out of bed and feeds Gwen before sitting at the mahogany wood and opening his package.
oh yeah that would do it
“Yeah, well, I crochet faster now,” Harry says proudly.
we just don’t care 🤠
I sigh, glancing at him.
Sometimes, students, you can get entranced by the potion without even drinking any.
“No drinking and flying!” Luna says.
My eyes widened.  "How did you-"
“Have you heard, Potter?” Draco begins one evening over supper of roast beef and carrot stew.
harry has none of that
He’s going to have to keep these.
"-Harry-"
: i knew you’d work out!
You have a relaxing voice.”
But he could instantly tell that Draco didn’t recognize him.
: bloody fuck
: uhhhh
make me happy.
“I’m glad nothing has gone wrong this year, usually my luck doesn’t last this long.”
When Harry doesn’t respond to that, Draco frowns.
“We both know you were looking tonight.
I walked up the steps of the house, awed by the size comparison. Malfoy Manor was massive, but this house was moedrately sized. Still fairly large, but drastically smaller in comaprison to the Manor.
“That’s an awfully suspicious thing to say to your boyfriend.”
i want to have a 5 year reunion party with our friends from hogwarts
: i feel too sick to eat!
So I’m here for a second try.
: orright
“But I’ve already dealt!”
“Black coffee with caramel swirled in, if you can, thanks,” he says, giving the girl a polite smile and turning back to Draco’s abhorred expression.
Harry and Draco work through their differences in the way that most men in their early twenties do- by not confronting the problem.
He opens the bag and pulls one out, putting it on his tongue and chewing.
Ron snorts but submits to laughing silently when Harry sends him a look.
He thought it was because of the pottery- but it wasn’t- oh merlin-
: i stared at him until i got caught, then i turned red and ran out of the store without buying anything
: he’s not wrong
“Wh- what?”
There’s a pause, and then, “Shame.
"Oh, yeah, definitely.  I like that option.  And can we do not quite white walls?"
But it was also that faith that got some of them killed.  He taught those kids himself, each and every one of them.  And some of them still died.
I’ve only looked at Potter twice more since the plane took off. Against my will, of course.
can’t get much worse than us
But Harry has to search for different potions books to find the recipe for Amortentia.
keyword being ‘again’
: like draco malfoy?
"Harry, dear, since we can't go back to Grimmauld Place today, you're welcome to stay here any explore the place. Our home is your home."
Oh???
don’t be shy take away the /j
“Which is where?”
anyway
Harry blushes.  “Uhm… or… or I can just…” and then Harry takes a few long strides and kneels in front of Draco, bringing them to eye level with each other.
: neither of you know where you are?
“Well, we’ll be seeing a lot of each other in the next nine months, 'cuz I work here too.”
A smirk instantly appears on Draco’s face.
And then Headmistress McGonagall’s piercing voice snaps them from their trance, and Draco trips over himself in an effort to separate the two of them.
You’re an obnoxious… toad.”
A knock on the door makes them turn, and Neville opens the door, peeking his head inside.
It’s practically begging him for a prank.
Harry smiles a tight smile.
“Malfoy.
: love you did this
He’s never seen the other man blush before…
And now it’s all fucked up.
: can confirm
Then… why haven’t you?”
Everyone can see how in love you two are!” Seamus exclaims.
“No, I didn’t mean it like that, Malfoy.
“Maybe I’m just lonely…” he says and pulls out some puppy-dog eyes.
: see you all in like 7 hours!
: ...
: guys im panicking
: that’s right, i do remember...
you’ve never watched merlin
“But where’s the fun in that?” calls out Teddy from his spot in the back of the class.
“At least buy me coffee before you start smearing clay all over me.”
---------------------------------------
: how embarrassing
“It’s fine. I mean- it was rather cold last night.
I woke up the next morning alone.  As usual.  Just my luck that the only boy I feel a connection with while having sex just up and leaves.
: this sounds like a terrible idea
"What now?" Draco asked.
"Are you preparing dinner tonight or ould you like me to?"
Draco is taking Harry’s shoulder measurements - the man has very broad shoulders - when they lock eyes in the mirror.
“Do you want to eat or not?”
When I regain control of myself, I say, “Don’t look so shocked- of course I’m capable of laughing.
"Where to?"
“Why were you thinking about my crocheting?”
: was gonna ask uhhhh what kinda stuff we said to each other
Except he makes much more of a scene.
did u talk to him
“Sorry I’m late, the tube was- hey, you ordered already!” Harry says, frowning.
Draco suspected, just maybe, that it was a date, but he knew for sure when Harry showed up at his work at 5:30 on the dot looking nicer than usual.
I don’t want to take up all your time, I feel bad.”
Breakfast. Teach.
There's a pause as Harry bites his lip, and then he kneels down next to where Draco is kneeling.
Cash or card?”
: not quite... but the other two should be arriving soon
Draco stands on the porch of the shoppe for a while after Harry leaves, just thinking and enjoying the fresh air.
This sends Draco into yet another laughing fit, only silenced when he receives a stern look from McGonagall.
He reaches out to brush it away, but Draco pulls back, looking hurt.
“You’re still an ass,” Potter mumbles in Draco’s direction.
Does he always make his entrances like that?” Harry says, still chuckling.
“What about him?
“Sorry to disappoint, but no.
“Oh.”
Draco rolls his eyes and casts a spell that chops them instantly.
“Damn you, Potter,” he growls to himself.
: true
I stare at him and smile warily.
The cauldron warps awkwardly into a slightly lopsided toilet.
: awww
: ...
we all sorta made amends at the end of school
: you guys will never guess what just happened to me
“Unfortunately, yes.
he had a glow up
of September is the day this all began, really.  Although the real time of it all can be debated, none of the following events would’ve happened if Harry James Potter hadn’t accepted Headmistress Minerva McGonagall’s offer to let him teach Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
I will not tolerate this slander
“Well, I put the Nair in your shampoo.
Then he realizes what he let slip, and he freezes.
: okay cool yeah i can do that
: plz say smt
He promises himself - and the mystery soup-bringer - that today will be the last day of this bout.
: can confirm my brain is soggy as well
: depends on what “it” is bc if u mean sex then that ship sailed a loooong time ago
He turns around, shaking his head to get the water off, and sees Draco pulling his shirt off and following him in.
And you say I’m the one who can’t read cues…”
: NOTHING
Just because they’re not equal doesn’t mean they’re not equivalent
“Now are you going to keep me company while I sew?”
You didn’t cast a charm or anything, not as far as I can tell.”
: HELL YEAH
See, he needs to potion to turn into a cauldron as soon as the potion is completed to have the greatest effect, but that requires knowing what the final step is and hoping that the potion-maker will correctly brew the potion.
Harry grins.
“What part of ‘use two hands’ are you not understanding?” Harry says, laughing so hard he’s clutching his abdomen.
But the Draco smiles and says, “Only if the location has good scones.”
A million things are running through Draco’s mind, questions of how he’s going to get through this, what happens when Harry does recognize him, who does he think he is?
When I get it back, he’s given me his number and the address of his hotel, making me beam stupidly.
“No more pretending.”
“Malfoy!”
“It’s not my fault that you were-“ he checks his watch, “-eleven minutes late.
: and why weren’t we invited ;)
“You have to work for that privilege.
He sighs and backtracks, beckoning to Harry and waiting for him to catch up.
“Well, one of us had to say it, and Merlin knows it wasn't going to be you.”
“The healers told me only time can fix mental issues.”
“Well, I’ll see you around, Potter.”
“The cats are going to love this stupidly soft sweater,” Draco says, patting the couch beside him for Pickle and Buckbeak to hop up.
: HNGGGGG
“Well, we kept it out of the papers, if that’s what you mean.”
: ron this is rly good
“You’re wrong!”
Draco responds by putting his hand on Harry’s face, smearing the cold, wet clay across his cheek affectionately.
“Yes, he’s okay.
a million things Harry wants to - needs to - say to the boy in front of him, but he can’t find the words.
I cringe and the mischievous - definitely not flirtatious - smile that crosses his lips.
“Oops.
: he’s just having confidence issues rn and needs some support from luna and i, and we need ur support to
: i’m in a hotel room i think... on a couch?
He has a few ideas, but he wants to save them until later on in the year.
You’ll be okay, just breathe and look at my eyes.”
: oi at least i’m not a ferret
But luckily, only his blonde roommate emerges, and fully clothed as well.  Harry realizes he’s not wearing a shirt and chastises himself, blushing slightly.
Unfortunately, balance does not seem to be one of Harry’s fortés because he sways to the side and pitches into Draco, who has to drop his measuring tape and catch him.
“Er- we didn’t-
: he was absolutely coat hangered
Everything is ready, so Draco goes back out and sits down anxiously while Ron persuades Harry to get out of his bedroom.  It feels like ages until he hears footsteps coming down the hall, his heart racing.
On the question
Before he can think much more, he leans in and presses his lips clumsily against Draco’s, surprising him.  But not for long, because Draco wraps his arms around Harry and pulls him in closer, making the kiss ever so softly.
He agreed, and I thought it would just be once, but… it wasn’t.
"Well, I guess you just weren't for him-" I paused confusedly.  "Wait.  Did you say
: not with the puking again...
Harry turned to face Narcissa and felt himself being pulled into an awkward but genuine hug.  He hugged her back and when they pulled apart, he saw a tear slip down her face.
Get a grip, Draco. Seriously.
overall, it’s a very good night.
: has draco?
He hesitated.  "But, our history-"
“Hm… I guess I can deal with nicknames as long as they continue to include ‘handsome’ in them.”
Potter glances over and then returns to eating his own stew.
and a time of magic
: true
: AHAHHAAHAHAH
: and 2) i didn’t tell u what happened after the sex
this is the first time you’ve seen him in years
You’re not the only one unhappy with this.”
: that’s a secret til the party starts babes, just know i’m a fantastic woman
“Harry, there are butterflies in every color, you toad.”
anyway what I meant to say
Draco measures Harry’s wingspan, shoulder-to-arm length, height, hip-to-leg length, being careful to write down the measurements exactly as he takes them.
: anyway
“Hey, I was thinking about all your crocheting and came up with an idea,” Draco starts.
You’ve got to start at the beginning.
[do crime but smart, 8:06 AM, Friday]
OF ALL THE PEOPLE
: •_•
“Merlin, Potter, how did you manage to save the wizarding world with two left feet like that?”
Harry waits for a few seconds… then a minute… then two minutes… then he knocks again and waits again, still to no avail.
"I- I just- you were whimpering and I heard your cries as I walked past your bedroom.  I knocked to see if you were alright but you didn't answer, so I just came in and woke you up."
: is anyone gonna tell me wtf happened w harry and draco last night
“Uhm…” he hadn’t actually expected himself to listen to his therapist, so he really doesn’t have a clue.
If that was weird.”
Draco smirks at Harry, motioning for him to continue.
: Who’s this?
"Call me by my name, slut."
"See that's the thing. You... you can't get mad at us..."
Peanut butter, you daft walnut
He feels Draco’s sharp intake of breath before he hears it.
"Good morning Harry, how did you sleep?" Narcissa asked.
He can tell his cats can sense his anxiety, as the ensuing eruption of orange, gray and white fur is loud and results in scratching of the already torn-up furniture.
Harry really is adorable when he’s flustered.
“Okay, not my best idea. Do you know any card games then?”
With that, she left my room, closing the door.  I got up and put on some jeans and my hiking boots (they're warm in the winter and have good grip), and a plain black shirt.
“You can drink after the game, alright?”
"Oh hello dear, Harry here was just telling me some stories about his Hogwarts years.  Would you like to join us?" Mum asked nonchalantly.
: i disagree
"Had the best fucking sex ever?" I interjected with a small smile.
Is he intentionally being a flirtatious brat or is that just his personality?
Harry adjusts on my shoulder, and I smile (against my will, of course).
“He looks at you the way I look at Ginny, the way Dean looks at Seamus, and the way Ron looks at Hermione.
Harry grins.
Draco simply pinches the bridge of his nose and spells cold water on Harry, sighing.
A million things hit Harry all at once.
Harry pauses with his hand on the doorknob.  What if this isn’t the right idea?  What if he’s wrong about Draco, wrong about everything?
“Harry.”  Harry looks up at Draco, who has an amused expression on his face.
add me to the gc please im cackling
I, unfortunately, am not
: and i’m sure you all remember draco
Anyway, where can I find him?”
Despite being a warmer day than usual, it’s still fairly cold.
: draco can’t text rn but i just told him and his expression was priceless
I specifically chose a seat near the front of the plane to minimize interactions with muggles, and now I have to deal with the consequences of that decision.
Setting his breakfast down on the sturdy, dark oak desk, he sits in his chair and immediately stands back up after hearing a crunch below his backside.
Malfoy speaks up.
I love that energy
: nope
“Hasn’t been in the last four days.
When did that happen?
: who tf doesn’t
It’s not a question.
: it’s fine, i think we just had a lot to drink and danced
I want to!
: ^^three
Suddenly, Harry remembers there’s a room back there.
: er- its a fanfiction-
: THERE IS NO SEX QJSHAKDH
I’m not enjoying myself.
“Er- sure?
dragon gets it
Every time he gets close to Harry to take a new measurement, he feels the man tense and hears him inhale softly like he’s slightly startled.
: i almost was
: i saw that coming a mile a way
“You missed,” Draco says, stepping closer.
“I have business with MACUSA.”
their supervision.
separately obviously
Potter rolls his eyes and my heart skips a beat. This has happened every time he’s ever rolled his eyes at me since forever, so I really don’t think much of it.
"I just know.  Don't worry about it.  I knew one or both of you would come home drunk and hungry, so I prepared.  That's what a mother does.  I'm not going to ask questions.  Just go take the soup and potions up to Draco."  She smiled a motherly, knowing smile.
“Interesting, Carolyn.
: nevermind! hey pans!
“Push the peddle… there you go.
: purple?
: why are we spelling party like that
we need an exorcist
: but you’ll tell us anyway
Malfoy looks mildly intrigued.
"Good enough," he said, rolling his eyes and walking out, not closing the door behind him, so I was forced to watch him leave.  And let me say, that's a very nice arse.
"Hey.  I brought you some soup.  And here-" I uncorked the hangover potion, "-drink this.  It'll make you feel better."  I brought it to his lips and he parted them enough to drink.  He was still basically asleep.  He looked like an angel.
He’s immediately hit in the face with a plant hanging from the ceiling.
: well what did u say afterwards?
: *kisses hermione’s cheeks like the french do*
In fact, he almost seemed like he was flirting with Harry. Which can’t be right, of course, because last he checked they were only
: *grumbles*
Draco discovers that Harry suffers from a hearty combination of PTSD and anxiety-fueled depression, and that’s why his hands shake so much.
Draco rolls his eyes.
you’re probably bored without me
The peanut butter question
“Professor?”
: … did you think that by removing the spaces i wouldn’t be able to read that
rarely
“No, I absolutely won’t stand for this.
Harry fucking Potter, Ronald fucking Weasley, and Hermione fucking granger
: make sure you wear that one cologne
What other foods are in your debate?
Somehow he took that as encouragement and said “None because they can’t change shit.”
- and two, because he woke up in Draco Malfoy’s bed half-naked. They were
And when we say goodnight after every group date, all I want to do is kiss you and pull you back into my arms and tell you to come inside, to let me hold you all night.”
YOURE GETTING YOUR MAN
Wow.  That's a confidence booster.
Why does he remember that Harry got blue yarn last time?
alright what kind of party?
Are you okay?” Ron asks.
With that, she apparated away.  I closed the door and turned to Harry.  "So you promise you weren't just using me for sex?  You really want something with me?"
He drops the sponge and lets his finger snake around the back of the blond's neck, pulling him ever so slightly closer.
“Very funny, Potter.
: oh boy
“Well, actually Headmistress, Draco wasn’t naked.
: thank god he was in gryffindor
Finished my last project.”
Professor Potter… that’s got a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?
Draco’s half-smile slips.
“C’mon, you useless toad, wake up.”
: AJDHJSJSJDK
"-Potter, take my arm."
: Sorry darling, I’m leaving you for this mysterious dragon person
Did you bring a suit with you, or are you looking to buy?”
: yeah he used to have the emotional intelligence of a teaspoon
You just haven’t got the guts to say anything about it.”
“Yes.
"Ahh, no. I lean more towards boyfriends."
anyone with two eyes can tell ur obsessed w each other
First, it’s the top of his wrist, so he takes off his watch. But when the itching spreads to his elbow and shoulders and neck, he gets concerned.
: kinky
“I own the place.
“And how do you suppose I do that?”
He should send a thank-you note, because that’s the polite thing to do, and not because his heart skips a beat at the thought of correspondence with Harry.
Sighing, he conjures a crumpled up piece of paper and pen.
: mhmmm whatever
i accidentally messaged them instead of you guys about peanut butter being a raw meat
: oof...
“You like that one?”
However, it’s unusual for anyone to come into the store at nine on a Monday morning, so when the bells above the door chimes he’s surprised.
"Draco, please!  I just need you to take him for one day!  I've got to do some things and I can't divide my attention."
Yeah?
He’s just making small talk, even if it is incredibly awkward.
“I love you too."
: thanks great answer ANYWAY
He’s feeling proud of himself and has almost made it out the doors to hide the clothes when Harry says his name.
: soggy?
The color varieties and possible combinations fascinate him, and he’s never satisfied until he finds one just right for his client.
Then he’s slapped across the face.
"He's here because I've been helping him renovate and clean his home, and he's staying here for the night because of it.  He'll be here tomorrow night too, if you want to go spend time with one of your friends," mum answered.
He turns hastily pulls the other fabrics off of Harry, throwing them over his shoulder, and sets the bolt in Harry’s outstretched arms.
: wait you said brain not hair
: was that before or after you lit my tie on fire?
“I wouldn't say it failed…” Draco scoffs, blushing.
“He hates me.”
Harry has this unfortunate tendency to interrupt his classes, so this certainly won’t be the last time.
what should I do for lunch
His hair is bloody stuck.
For a moment, it’s just the two of them laying there together, and the world around them has stopped.
“That’s really smart, actually.
: no lol
I hope you all have a marvelous first day of teaching,” McGonagall dismisses them.
"Alright!"
Harry looks startled at being called handsome, and a light blush dusts his freckled cheeks.
: RONALD
He risks reaching out and putting a hand on Draco’s shoulder, forcing them to lock eyes.
Harry Potter is standing behind him, choking on laughter, and he’s bloody enjoying it.
I passed! I passed my exam and am now qualified to speak with the Headmistress of Hogwarts! Since it's Headmistress McGonagall, I'm sure it will go well.
"Off-white?"
I guess you were thinking about smart people things after all.”
Draco’s cousin, Teddy Lupin, asks.
What were you even doing the entire time I was explaining the theory to the class?”
anyway
Yes, he’s definitely smelling the Amortentia and its infinite different enticing smells: treacle tart, the locker rooms after a quidditch game, wet wood, books and ink, blueberry pancakes… all of it adding up to one distinct yet indescribably scent.
“Hello bored, I’m done with this conversation.”
“So you did accidental magic?”
“Okay. Er- I’m gonna go now, I guess.” Harry says, breaking the silence.
"I'm gonna go get us some food and you a hangover potion, okay?  I'll be right back," I spoke softly into his ear.  He gently nodded, still mostly asleep.  "Sleep well, baby."
Having come to this agreement, neither know what to do now.
"Oh yeahhhhh... okay so it's a boy... hmmmm...  did he go to Hogwarts?"
The only rule is that it can’t cost more than €100 per person.  That's probably what the letter's about.”
“-incredibly disappointed in you two.
“Why do I not believe you?” I mumble to myself, knowing I’ll regret this.
"You must've grabbed it when you left my room last night-"  I started.  Then I stopped and my face fell.  I turned to walk back over to the bookcase but Harry grabbed my hand to stop me.
: PARDON????
: AJDBAKSJ NO AHDGAJDJ
It takes him a moment to remember that he’s been asked a question, and when he does respond, his voice comes out much shakier than he’d intended.
: [insert drarry karaoke video]
But as soon as he gets the yarn registered, the machine crashes.
He’s going to transfigure Draco’s cauldron into a toilet.
: i can’t believe im married to one of these idiots
: oh how he’s grown
: ....
Harry scoffs.
: IM SS THING FOR PANSY
Fuck.  Just my luck.  He knows it's him.
I called in my assistant, Pansy, to man the desk and take orders for me.
: theres the draco i know and love
So it shouldn’t be surprising to Harry that he bumps into someone he knows almost every time he comes here, which isn’t very often, but still.
“What do you mean, you didn’t know?” Draco frowns.
I’m not reading this book aloud to you.”
“Luna is one of the models for my fashion line,” Draco says proudly, looking at Harry in the mirror.
Harry doesn’t say anything after that, and neither does Draco.
But what’s your stance?
“I never agreed to go with you,” Draco teases.
Neville grins. “Of course!  So excited to have you here, Harry!”
: lemme fill u in dragon
“Alright.
calm your tits
When I look at him, he only holds up one finger, finishes the page, and then takes his hand off mine.
looping it around your arm a few times and hanging it on the hook is NOT the same as winding it up
Harry must look very dumbstruck, because Draco just rolls his eyes and huffs.
: HOLY SHIT MALFOY
“Go back to bed, boys.”
: AHAHAHAHAHAH
“Yes… and you still…” Draco gestures awkwardly to his cheek and neck, which Harry’s lips had been decorating only moments before.
as an intellectual I can confirm that this is definitely how percentages and fractions work
Everyone murmurs their agreement, including Draco, which surprises Harry.
“This is becoming a weekly occurrence, Potter,” Draco smirks as Harry approaches the register with two orange skeins of yarn in hand.
“You sure?
"Oh I'm sorry! I wasn't looking where I was going." Then I saw who I bumped into and smiled. "Narcissa! Good to see you!"
: alright, alright.
: hey it’s really dark where i am
“I can’t go out looking like this.”
"Oh, you're both here, good!"  She glanced down at our hands, which were still together, and smiled.  "I was just hoping to teach Harry the wall painting spell, but Draco I'm sure you can do it yourself.  I'll leave you two alone."
no youre fucking not
“Yea alright. Thanks.”
No, he’s not.
: (...)
As if this friendship wasn't bad enough, Harry saw me having that nightmare last night. He saw me weak, human. He's supposed to think I'm better than him, a strong person.
“Good.
“Harry James ‘Great-Big-Grumpy-Cat’ Potter, will you marry me?”
“You didn’t answer my question,” Draco retorts, narrowing his eyes teasingly.
: HARRY POSTED A CLIP OF HIM LICKING WHIPPED CREAM OFF OF DRACOS ABS
“Teachers, I would like to have a short meeting with you in the staff hall before we all prepare for tomorrow.”
Draco nods, obviously unconvinced, but it’s good enough for now.
As if sensing his thoughts, the man says, “Yes, it is mold, but no, it won’t hurt you.
What could go wrong?
: okay
: true okay
Anyway, that’s not why I’m here.”
"Wait Draco we can't-"
"Yep.  He came out to me and the rest of us Weasley's, along with Hermione, right after we broke up.  He's gay."
Or maybe less?
Apparently his definition of 'taking my arm' is holding my hand.  I don't mean he grabbed my hand in the normal way, either.  He interlocked our fingers and squeezed a tiny bit for a moment.  When I looked up, his expression mirrored mine: surprise.  Apparently he didn't realize what he did either.  Weirdly enough, however, neither one of us let go.
“Wh- er- what do you mean?” He stutters out.
do they know who you are?
The students love it, and Draco doesn’t seem to mind, so Harry sees no problem with this.
“Is that any way to greet a friend, Malfoy?”
Harry Potter?  How exciting."  I joked.
"You sexy bastard," I whispered into his ear before biting his earlobe and tugging slightly.  I sucked another mark just below his ear before making out with him again.
Harry glares at the blonde, resuming his place in the chair beside him and cleaning up his mess.
Draco beams, turning to Harry.
your turn
: draco wtf
Right?
anyway I’ve got to go, lunch break is over
Draco stops walking, Harry’s hand still in his.
I rolled my eyes.  "Seriously, dumbass, just do it.  No need to make this weirder than it already it is."
It was every date.
He expects Draco to leave the aisle, but he stays, continuing to stock yarn.
This prank had better bloody work.
Either find the snitch or get a room!” Hermione calls playfully from the ground.
Why is Potter Talking to Me, and Will He Stop If I Ignore Him, a biography by me.
“Oh, don’t get your feathers in a ruffle.
: we’ll bring dessert
GET IT
“Are you alright?
Stupid Potter with his stupid hair and stupid smirk.
He’s a Malfoy, what more do you expect?
so you volunteered instead
: and now you i suppose
: dya think draco ships drarry
“Since when have I ever listened to the rules?”
"Draco, I-" He sighed.  "Yesterday was one of the best days I've had in years.  I didn't think about the war or my scars once, you know that?  I didn't stress and I wasn't anxious.  Being with you at the store and teasing you... It just felt- feels- so natural.  I constantly wanna hold your hand and... last night, after we, ya know-"
: can i help with decorations harry?
He narrowed his eyes slightly, smiling.  "Fine.  For my mothers sake."
I’m of half a mind to send you on temporary leave to teach you a lesson.
“True... want me to get us something?
: yeah we’ve had to suffer for like ten years
“Potter please, leave my class be.
er sure haha
They both pretend not to notice the way Draco’s eyes gloss over at the last one.
“Headmistress, you needed to see- Harry!”  Neville exclaims.
"No Draco, don't stretch me.  I'll be fine.  Just go."
He exits the box to go congratulate his Alma Mater team, all the while wondering why he has such a bad feeling about Malfoy.
Draco looks down at his stew.
Even if it did mean something to Draco.
Draco watches the man’s strikingly green eyes sweep the colorfully organized shoppe as he responds, “To buy if that’s alright.”
I was walking through a Flourish and Blotts, just to see if they had any interesting new books, I ran into someone I didn't think I'd ever see again.
Malfoy is nowhere in sight.
Harry regrets not spending enough time with Neville when they were in school… he’ll have to make up for it this year.
It gives him butterflies in places where he absolutely should not be feeling butterflies.
that’s why I stalked potter so much
yeah like three days ago remember?
He’s pulled out of his trance by Harry’s lower half inevitably emerging from the water as well and turns his head away rapidly.
“Really?
I thought this was great, it would give me something to do and I'd finally start working on the place! If Sirius could see me now...
I see some muggle money exchange hands and roll my eyes.
“Yeah, don’t make me leave.
ANYWAY
: love
, I thought.
I er- made you this… for today. Thought maybe you’d like a set for the winter or something,” Harry says, producing a maroon and silver hat and scarf set from inside his coat.
: done
: no we probably won’t
and I think I have pretty normal feet?
It’s nice because most of the memories he has of Harry sleeping are of him having nightmares.
What did you do to my already impossible hair to make it more impossible?” He says, regaining control of his facial features.
“Hey,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s mouth, startled by the cold.
: WAIT NO COME BACK AJDHKADH U HAVE A PRETTY FACE
“…Malfoy?”
I closed the toilet lid and skittles had the audacity to fucking beep at me
: welcome
“Mushroom soup is the bane of my existence.
“Of course I was!
: i don’t wanna know
: (...)
Thank you.”
I catch up to her, standing maybe four feet behind her.  I gather up the last of my courage and gently say her name.
: why not
It’s not heated, not passionate, not sensual, but it's soft, and curious, and beautiful.
: hell yeahhhh this party’s gonna rock
"Please what?  I want you to say it." I bit out every syllable like poison.
Harry looks around and discovers that they are indeed in that party hallway.
“Anyway… I thought maybe we could borrow the quidditch pitch at Hogwarts!”
By now it was around 22:00.  Draco was still asleep.  His breathing was slightly uneven, but in a pattern.  It was so relaxing.  My arms were around him and I could feeling the steady rising and falling of his chest.  I was just breathing in the scent of him, trying not to let my mind wander.  it wasn't working.
: OKAY WHAT THE FUCK HOW DID WE END UP DOING THAT
Instead, I’m staring at his jet black hair and coffee-colored skin, enraptured by the way he glows even in the shoddy light of the airplane.
Definitely not.
The plates of food vanish, and McGonagall stands.
: *walks over and hugs a mildly anxious looking draco*
He should be angry, but the homeliness of the place mixed with the scent of clay and scones draws Draco in immediately, against his will.
Maybe they have a chance at this.
By the time we checked everything out and hauled it behind the Ikea where we could cast a shrinking spell, we were both exhausted and slap happy.
: I don’t know what to do with this information
RONPHOBIA
✴︎✴︎✴︎
I’m leaving,” he jokes, although he’s got two cats fighting over his lap and one slung around his shoulders, so he’s not going anywhere.
Harry nods in agreement, chuckling a bit.
A very beautiful tall man.
“I should’ve guessed you’d be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potter.”
Harry’s laughing at his comeback and Draco is laughing too, and he realizes that maybe dating Harry isn’t such a bad idea.
GUYS GUYS GUYS
: we’d never hurt you mione
Draco nods as if this is something any normal customer would say and then does a double-take.
"Draco!" I shouted, pulling him out of the way and onto the sidewalk with me, then holding him tightly in my arms for a moment.  He tensed, and I realized what kind of position we were in, so I quickly let go and turned to teasing to get over the extremely awkward moment.
: the dress code is fancy as fuck
“Are you asking me out?”
"No, actually."  The Weasley girl said.
Draco begins to eat again, hoping that’s the end of it.
Draco absolutely melts at the sound of the man's voice; sweet music like raspberry honey pours from between his full lips.
if you want me to leave, I can.
“Obviously, nitwit.
: i hate it here
“What’s your name?” Draco asks, opening his box and pulling out his measuring tape.
“I don’t know what you did, but you’d better have it reversed, or Merlin help me, I’ll…”
How can you start reading in the middle of the book?”
“Have you got somewhere to be?”
: guys i saw harry in diagon alley today
: cuz the party is over and all these names are confusing my soggy brain
“Maybe I will!”
f\KDJASFJKD PLZ
“He’s the mystery person you called to be the DADA teacher, isn’t he?”
Draco awakes a few mornings later to his owl, Gwen, bonking her head into his shoulder.
Since their reprimanding by the Headmistress after their incident in the baths,
Soon, he and all the rest of the staff are sitting at a round table in the center of the room.
Draco won’t answer the door.
: yea
: this is gonna be so much fun
They all nod in agreement and mount their brooms. Draco, Ginny, and Seamus are on one team, while Harry, Dean and Ron are on the other.
: AJAHKSDHKS
: i mean yeah
They head out the door and walk down the street in the chilly November air.
What is he doing, arguing with Harry, when they could be doing so many other things…
: ... fair enough
: fucking watch me
Where else?
“Are you saying you just kissed me like that to not go out with me?”
“Professor Malfoy, are you alright?”
“What did you say to him?” Ron asks.
"How in the bloody hell are we gonna get this home?"  Harry asked.
Bright, sunshine yellow with thick black letters that read
Harry smiles as she leads him into the round room.  She’s redecorated the place, keeping the mystical, astronomical theme, but less foreboding and more welcoming.
I do neither.
Thanks,” Draco grins.
: i meant us
What’s your stance
Draco nods, still taking in Harry’s figure and style.
if you drank cologne instead of whiskey again im not apparating you to st. mungos
: soggy?
: oi don’t even mention that
“That’s great, now you know exactly what to dress me in!”
He’d empty his vault to see that look again.
“I have hope for this year and for our goal of encouraging inter-house unity to end negative stereotypes within our school.
Draco looks at the dusty, clay-splattered stool and then at his tailored slacks and cocks an eyebrow.
"Alright!" Narcissa said, waving and walking in the opposite direction.
: good news!
why do I subject myself to this /j
But what does all of that amount to?
He smiles to himself and grabs a towel, clothes, and his book before exiting his apartment in a hurry.
“Harry?
HARRYPHOBIA
malfoy is like
"Me too." Draco paused before continuing, "Why don't we get a drink?  Unless of course, you don't drink."
“Well, you know, I can… er- hey, I can demonstrate to the students exactly what
Draco’s eyes widen almost imperceptibly, but Harry notices. Harry always noticed everything about Draco.
they didn’t believe me
Malfoy cuts him off abruptly, not wanting to spill out his entire soul to his childhood nemesis in front of strangers.
“Su- ehrm- sure.
He really should’ve seen it coming but drowsiness and a false sense of security distract him from the obvious, and Draco Malfoy wakes up the next morning with bright gold and red Gryffindor hair.
I don’t know if I should be offended or just appreciate that he’s finally stopped talking.
Now all he has to do is actually set the action.
Having his own entire room at Hogwarts is an incredible feeling, and he truly does feel at home.
It’s a mug.
Draco tells himself that Harry didn’t buy anything because he forgot, not because he only came to the store to check up on Draco.
“So you’re okay with this purple?”
He doesn’t like unpredictability.
So, Harry being the man he is, he’s going to rely on memory and his moderate Charms abilities to get this to succeed.
: okay
Harry is the first to look away when Draco grins.
"God no. That bitch couldn't pry Ron from my cold dead arms," Hermione muttered, then looked up and put her hands over her mouth.
Draco chuckles, a memory resurfacing in his mind that he hadn’t thought of in years.
The rush of the wind in his hair, sailing above everyone else, feeling free… it never gets old.
And with that, near-naked Harry winks - he
Oh no.
“What?
: now we can set them up and everything
Everyone cheers, including Harry’s team, because that was an epic grab.
: *fear*
Harry doesn’t even realize that Draco’s leaned in until they lock lips, gently but eagerly.
you’re fucking what now
: YES ANSHAKDHAKS
UHHHHHHHH
“With all that said, let the feast begin!”
“Draco, seriously, haven’t you got other clients?
: hell yeahhh
: this is bullying
He curiously runs his fingers through Harry’s hair, feeling how it’s strangely soft despite looking like a bird's nest.
The sharp voice of the flight attendant standing next to me brings me back to reality, where I’m being fussed at for not having buckled my seatbelt.
So I took his arm again and he apparated us to a muggle bar, where we wouldn't be noticed by any paparazzi or anything.  Except he apparated us right in front of a bus.  A moving bus.  Coming right towards us.
Draco stretches his arm out and wraps his fingers around the snitch an instant before Harry can and pulls up, narrowly avoiding the ground.
You should’ve outgrown your ridiculous rivalry ages ago, and yet here you are.
Harry seems just as surprised that Draco is talking to him, because he responds, “Crocheting.”
: 10 sickles harry asks him out first
: yeah anyway
: unfortunately no
: mood
: i managed to sit up and i have determined that i am definitely not at my flat
Wake up.
: uhm
He’s not at all turned on by the sight of Harry naked.
Whatever.”
I grabbed one of his legs and threw it over my shoulder.  As a last thought, I summoned ropes and bound his hands together above his head, tied to the headboard.  I looked at him and leaned down and whispered, "you sexy little bastard" before slamming into him.  He shouted and moaned.
: i feel like i wanna tell me smt but ur being a chicken
: stfu u love us
“Of course.  Please come in, I would like to brief you and remind you of the rules you so frequently broke in your youth,” she says with a twinkle in her eye.
Hearing him moan was my favorite thing and before I knew it I was jerking him off while fucking him hard.  It felt so good.
“You… did?”
Harry furrows his brows.
Certainly not bonding moments, or anything else of the sort.
: yea
“Good morning class- Potter, you’re on time.
“Draco…” Harry begins, not really sure where he was going with that.
I walked around the island to find two hangover potions and two bowls of chicken noodle soup and when I looked up, Narcissa was sitting at the counter across from me.
: i’ve been pining over you for far too long to let you go so easily
what did you do
The rest of the day was uneventful.  I got back home at about 15:00 and mum's company had left, so I finished off the scones she made and we settled down to play a game of wizard's chess together.
Didn’t know you had a schedule,” Draco snarks back with no actual bite.
But I have to do it alone.
Draco starts, knocking the vase off of its shelf and fumbling once, twice, three times before catching it again.
: sorry i forgot you guys whoops
"Fuck you!" He called back.
Later that night, Harry is pacing in the small living room of the flat he shares with his three cats.
: literally knew it
I’m a teacher now, I don’t have time for foolishness.
Some are simple and earthy, and others are complex and brightly colored.
Why, you two friends or summin’?”
Harry seems to notice Draco’s sudden stiffening, because he says, “I’m sorry, I know it’s hard at first.
I finished my soup and looked for my shirt, only to not be able to find it.  I decided just to put on a new one, figuring it got thrown somewhere obscure in last nights fun.
Well, until it’s done, obviously.
Dean chuckles, and Harry glances up.  “C’mon, this isn’t funny!  I have a real problem here!”
Harry frowns. “Nair?
Do I want to be more with him?  I don't know.  It's hard for me to forget all the years of bullying, but he's honestly really cute.  Rude and snarky, sure, but also sweet and protective and strong-willed.
: does anyone know where i am
You need food.”
who’s invited?
: hey you said it not me
No, that feeling is called relief.
I mean
I should get going…”
“S’this enough?”
If you give me a minute, I can get you sorted out,” the man says, standing from his workstation and cleaning up.
“I didn’t break anything, you let me in.
Draco recommends products, makes sarcastic remarks, and and graciously accepts the coffee and/or lunch.
: FUCK OFF
She hangs back, however, and so does Malfoy.
OMG HES ADORABLE
Mother would’ve told me to hold my head high and ignore him. Father would’ve told me to request a seat change for Potter.
: yeah that you like his friends too
: i want to open the curtains but it’s so bloody bright and my head is pounding
"Yes sir," he winked before putting his hands on my ribs and lightly trailing them down to my waist before yanking my pants down.  The waistband grinding over my cock made me groan with pleasure.  Then his hands climbed back up my legs, his strong fingers caressing the inside of my thighs.  My knees got week and I had to grab his shoulders to keep from falling over.  He reached under the fabric of my briefs and up to my cocked where he gently pinched it before slipped out again and pulling my briefs down too.  My hard-on sprang up and Harry drank in the sight hungrily.
: i don’t like rice
"Draco?  Draco wake up!"  I shot up in bed and looked around, seeing Harry sitting there on the edge of my bed looking slightly concerned.  His hand was on my thigh which sent shivers down my spine.
: anyway i need them to be a couple because i’m so done with harry being single and going on useless dates when we all know he likes draco
if you guys say so
He made a mess of the kitchen, but Draco doesn’t mind.
They walk in silence for a few minutes before Draco speaks again.
Draco grins.
: and done
“Yeah, of course.”
Harry mocks offense.
…unless… /j
“That’s probably the most intelligent thing that’s come out of your mouth ever.”
: do you even deserve our fireworks
I had just gotten home from Christmas Shopping when an owl flew up to my window and began screeching. So I didn't disturb my neighbors, I quickly opened the window and gave Narcissa's owl some treats before reading the letter.
And, just my luck, the second I started walking towards the stairs, he did too. I didn't want to look like a fool, so I kept walking. And so did he. We were walking up the stairs, side-by-side, and it wasn't very wide so we were practically shoulder-to-shoulder.
Suddenly, after wiping up the nose-tea mess, Mum turned to Potter.
He has no brakes. Or sense of direction.”
I don’t look at other peoples feet so I wouldn’t know
Harry beams at Draco like a child on Christmas morning, and his heart soars.
Mass murder?” Draco bites, sounding hurt.
But since he’s alone, he takes the time to wander the shop and look at all the creations.
“Because every time I postponed it, you agreed.”
: AJSKAHDKJS
“Happy late birthday, ‘you great big grumpy cat.’
no I don’t need to go to the hospital again
“If you say so.”
: isn’t it?
: sure what’s up
: who knew all it would take is some karaoke and drunk sex to get you two together
"Yeah, nice talking to you too Malfoy, I guess," she said and walked away.
: i couldnt escape him if i tried
IM NOT EVEN UPSET THAT I LOST OMG
Why do you sound happy to see me?” He says, instantly suspicious.
: STUF
"Guess you're friendly, huh?" I muttered as I handed her a treat and untied the note attached.
: i’m out to all my friends and my aunt andromeda and that’s it
I laughed and continued looking around the place, with Narcissa following me.
What’s going on?” asks the Hufflepuff Prefect, others gathering around him.
“That’s… actually smart.
: well i just knocked over a vase of flowers and it shattered, so i think i might be with you
I can't believe I agreed to this.  I'm already regretting this.  Aghhhhhhh.
you here?”
fish n chips
Mother even helped me pick out some jewelry to go with it- later that week she took me to get my ears pierced.”
Neville and Harry spend about two hours wandering the castle together, catching up and joking around.
Daddy said that it’s impossible for them to be dark because I surround myself with such great people.
Then we can pick fabrics and you can come back in a few hours to pick it up.”
Neville nods his head in agreement and glances at Harry.  “So what are you going to do?”
It’s powerful and shocking and exhilarating, and he can’t look away.
“Well, maybe you’re not quite as thickheaded anymore.”
Because if there was a problem, I can trust that the two of you would come to me, and not take it out on each other.”
Potter jumped a little when I shouted, but moved back out into the hallway, muttering under his breath.  But he didn't close the door and leave, like I was hoping he would. He just stood there.
Draco sighs.
“Please don’t scare me like that again,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s lips.
Harry cackles, adding, “Man, the look on your face was bloody brilliant.
: sorry did you say we went to a club
The students do, however, and not even the two of them can deny the rumors floating around.
: he doesn’t rmr?
He checks the hallways, then remembers he’s a Professor and can do what he likes, so he casually opens the door to the baths, feeling important.
"I'm sorry that I was ten steps off of my target, sue me!"  He replied, turning and walking into the pub.
: bet
What are you planning?”
Hoping he hasn’t crossed a line, he waits until Draco relaxes again to speak.
“Potter?”
Why is he not good at being kind?
What a d-
Good thing he thought ahead and dressed himself up a tiny bit as well.
: harry said he’s gonna confess to draco but i’m not sure he’s gonna do it so probably wait on that
: at least it wasn’t for me
: this is more important that your meaningless duties
“Sorry, my bad!” Harry exclaims, looking up to see who he accosted and locking eyes with none other than Draco Malfoy.
For a moment, there’s silence.
: hey guys!
“You said you wanted to talk?” Draco says, startling Harry.
what did I miss?
“What’s new?” Harry retorts, shuffling the deck.
"Ahh. I thought maybe you'd become an Auror, as you've got the talent."
"Well, we have been enemies for quite a few years. While I could put our differences behind us, as they were really childish, I don't think friendship is in our future."
: should i tell draco
I HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM
As I walked towards where Narcissa had been standing, I found that she was heading in the opposite direction from me.  Towards Florish and Blotts.
He glances over his shoulder to see how far behind Harry is and catches another glimpse of naked Potter.
“Harry Potter, if you don’t change my hair back to normal
Everything looks perfect, all candlelit and romantic.
He gently takes the bolt out of Harry’s arms and then turns to face him, eyes full of wonder.
The second time, my eyes wandered towards him without my permission, and suddenly I was lost in the blush on his cheeks. He certainly was not blushing because I was looking at him.
"Hmmmm," he looked very thoughtful before his eyes lit up.  "Oh!  Do you have a-" he leaned in and whispered this part, his minty and alcohol stained breath getting me high, "-crush?"
They eat the rest of their meal in silence, and soon the students are guided out of the Great Hall by their prefects, leaving the staff alone.
He frowns and doesn’t accept.
He’s drawn back to reality when he hears keys jiggle in the lock.  Draco’s back.  And from the sounds of it, he’s not alone.  Damn.
: oh boy
“How did I not know?”
: oi!
But he shakes those thoughts from his head.
Against my will, I began quietly laughing at their predicament.  Then I realized I'm still going to have to pull the dad card and break them up.
Harry feels every sob hit him like a tidal wave.
"Makes this even more right.  Enemies with benefits?"
“Are you alright?” Harry asks, now that Draco’s regained the ability to speak coherently.
“I have something for you too, actually,” Draco says, standing and heading to their room.
A potion?
“Yeah, that should do.
“Really,” Malfoy drawls.
It’s from Hermione,” Draco says, brows furrowed in confusion.
Out loud?
Harry’s head is spinning with all sorts of other memories and hints that he should’ve picked up on.  But the biggest question he has is, “Does he have feelings for me too?”
: no you will NOT, i don’t trust anything the two of you make /lh
It made me happy.”
It’s been over a week since the Nair Incident.
When he first opens his eyes, he thinks it's a weird-looking black cat, but upon closer inspection, he realizes that it's hair.
"How about I give you hints?  If it flat out tell you, it'll be less fun."
