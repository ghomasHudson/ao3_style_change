“Hey, s’alright, don't cry,” Harry said, uncharacteristically tender. He wiped away Draco’s sudden tears with his thumb. “I never thought I could be this happy, do you hear me? Thought I'd be stuck in that bloody hell hole until the day I die. But then you came along, you priss, and you made everything good again. Brought the color back.”
“Making ourselves at home, are we?” He asked, blowing a stray strand of blond hair away from his eyes. Harry noticed fondly that it wasn’t gelled, and appeared almost feathery-soft.
Buried beneath the self-hatred and self-pity, though, was one horny bastard. Seeing Potter in that expensive suit, with scruffy cheeks and tired green eyes brought out a deep hunger that Draco had failed to suppress for years now. Draco had wanted many things in his life-- his father’s approval, The Dark Lord’s appreciation (that thought sent shivers down his spine now), and the respect of his peers. But nothing, absolutely nothing, had him yearning like Potter did. Seeing Potter brought a pathetic desperation upon Draco-- a nearly painful desire to touch and be touched, to hold and to be held. Often, he would wake up with sticky boxers and sweaty skin after dreaming of Potter’s rough hands. It was...an obsession, to say the least. An obsession that had followed Draco through puberty and into adulthood.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. With a shaking hand, he wandlessly conjured up some lube and Harry’s hands were suddenly wet and cool with the liquid. Harry raised an eyebrow.
“Our Historical Spells section is quite vast, full of useful information if you’re planning on becoming a magical historian. There’s also a very in-depth collection on the Royal Family, dating back almost 500 years ago in the 1100s. Oh, and if you’re interested in Immortality, Nicolas Flamel writes wonderful works on his newest techniques! Those are my personal favorites. But of course, every piece here is incredibly educational.”
Harry snorted, rolling his eyes. “Yeah. So was Dudley. There’s no way in hell I’m going to such a pointless gathering full of rich pansies like you.”
“Fuck off and listen to me,” Potter said. Something about the genuine frustration in Potter’s tone did something to Draco, something sinful. Oh, right. He was supposed to be listening. “They’re going to attack Truro next. Or-or somewhere around there.”
“Bugger off, Hermione. I’m fine,” Harry said, shrugging his friend’s hand away. “It’s just...something I’ve noticed.”
“Because of me?! You’re the one who invited me along in the first place!” Draco howled, shooting Harry a cold stare.
Draco wrinkled his nose and tentatively dipped the shirt in the river, sloshing it around awkwardly for a few moments before pulling it back out and placing it on the ground. Harry raised his eyebrows, feeling somewhere between amused and bewildered as to how anyone could be so incredibly useless. Well, Harry shrugged to himself as he observed Draco's clumsy movements. I suppose some help is better than none.
“BECAUSE!” Dudley yelled as he ripped away the coat Vernon was attempting to place around his shoulders. “You’re ugly, stupid, and worthless! I can’t be seen with you!”
“Glad you understand that you’re not in mortal peril. Anyway, today let's just focus on you not drowning.”
“Hello, Mother,” Draco said, embracing her and kissing her on the cheek. She wore flowing, black velvet robes and her white and black hair was laced with light streaks of grey. Her lips were painted a dark shade of rouge.
Draco sniffed, and if the situation had been less serious Harry would have teased him endlessly about shedding tears. But this time, Harry took a gentle hand and swiped away their stains. Draco took a shuddering breath, leaning into Harry’s touch.
Before Harry could even so much as take in his surroundings, Ron leaned over towards his ear and whispered: “You stay behind. Hermione and I are going to walk in first, and you need to make an entrance. For Draco.”
“You...fine! Please!I need you to...please,” Draco said breathily, eyes flickering down to what he could see of Harry inside of him. Harry grinned devilishly and pulled out, agonizingly slow, only to decide that he’d made Draco suffer long enough.
Malfoy just barely nodded before pulling an evidence bag out of his briefcase and gently placing the shoe inside. “Notice how there’s only one shoe?”
“U-Understand what?” She asked, confident tone faltering for a moment. Harriet reached out a gentle hand, and stroked her index finger along Draca’s shining bottom lip.
Draca’s fingers were unsteady, but Harriet was so far gone that they were doing the trick just fine. Harriet thrust her fingers deep into Draca, just how she knew she liked it, and Draca’s noises were music to her ears.
“Hush, Draco darling,” Narcissa cooed, tucking a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. “I won’t allow your father to partner you with someone unworthy.”
Draco was restless. He stared at the half-completed homework his tutors had assigned but could not bring himself to do more of it. He sighed, falling back onto his moss-green four-poster bed with a thump. He closed his eyes as he rubbed his temples; it had been a long day. First, in the morning, he had had potions class (which was fine enough) but that was followed by the history of magic, which was less fine and more along the lines of horrifically boring. Tutor Binns had lectured for a whole hour on the reason for the creation of the seasoning potion. And then there had been that whole debacle in town with that Potter-boy. Potter was a disrespectful lowlife who didn’t know his place, however he found himself yearning to spend more time with him. Perhaps for the independence? The experience? Surely it could not have been the commoner himself.
Draco stood next to Potter in front of a tiny, cobblestone building with multiple stories. The rafters were falling apart and the door was made of cracked wood. After Potter had alerted Kingsley to the news, he had made a few more “calls” on that strange (and oddly convenient) Muggle device and had secured them room and board at a wizard’s tavern nearby. Though Draco wasn’t too keen on staying in a musty old room in a tavern full of drunkards, he had to admit that it would prove much more efficient than constantly aparrating back and forth.
“Well,” Harry said as he demonstrated. “You need to use your arms, too. Don’t let them just fly around or you’re going to stay in place. And you need to close your fingers so you can push the water away from you and gain speed.”
“You need some help there?” Harry asked, snickering. Draco glared at him and Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Very intimidating. Thanks for this, by the way.”
“Don’t be silly, Potter. I can do it myself,” Draco muttered, averting his gaze and wrenching himself away from Harry’s grasp with an absurdly dramatic flair.
Harry laughed when the knights let them through immediately, not uttering a single word; they must have been Ron’s friends.
“That’s enough, Ronda,” ‘Mione warned. Ronda, however, seemed not to hear him; she was laughing maniacally at her own joke.
There was another beat of silence, and then Draco whispered something almost inaudibly. “Teach me, Potter.”
“Good,” Harry said quietly, placing a friendly hand on Draco’s lithe shoulder. He allowed it to linger a little too long, however, and he noticed Draco’s eyes flitting over to where his hand rested. Harry pulled it away as though he had been burned, and he must have imagined Draco’s slight shudder.
“Hey, ‘Mione, don’t scold Harriet for getting laid. Not everyone has a stick up their arse like you do, you know!”
Draco opens his mouth to say something but his voice breaks and Harry grins hugely into his chest. There we are, he thinks. Not even an insult. Perhaps I’m getting through to him.
“He’s here because...we believe the wizard behind this is a former Death Eater. And given Mr. Malfoy’s...history, he can provide us with valuable input. As fellow aurors, you two will be partners in this case.” Kingsley looked at each of the men. “I expect this won’t be a problem?”
Lucius’ pale eyebrows rose, intrigued. “A servant? His power must be exceedingly strong for you to consider someone so beneath us.”
Ron puffed out his chest and Hermione snorted at his display of grandeur. “Yeah, I do! One of his Royal Knights.”
“Alright, alright!” He took a breath and tried to gather his thoughts. “I don’t...I don’t want to marry just anyone,” He mumbled, face reddening in shame. “What if they’re rude? Or unattractive? Or--”
“No, he doesn’t!” Harry grimaced when Ron shot him a glare. “Sorry, guys, but neither of you do. Why would someone so rich, so gorgeous, so bloody stuck up be interested in me?”
Hermione snorted and Harry couldn't help but smile despite the fact that he had just been notified of his impending doom.
“What?” Harry asked, heart leaping. He hadn’t been able to wear anything other than filthy hand-me-downs since...well, forever.
Draco woke up to the sound of his mother’s harp. Memories came flooding back at the sweet, liquid sound: Memories of his father pacing back and forth, back and forth inside of his chambers, screaming at employees about their inferior blood status. Threatening their families, threatening their children. He remembered the way his mother would hold him as he cried, after his father called him useless, and sing to him in hushed tones. Draco loved his mother dearly. In his eyes, she truly was a queen.
Lucius smirked coldly. “Oh, Draco. Why must you always be so difficult? Can you think of a better way to find a proper spouse?”
“Hello there, and welcome to the Regulus Black Library! I’m Hermione, and you?” She thrust an eager hand towards Harry, who took a moment to shake it.
Harry cut him off with a dirty kiss, all tongue, and Harry could feel Draco’s rapid heart beat through his thin robes. Robes, Harry thought, mind clouded by intense arousal.
Nodding to his father with as much respect as he could muster under the current circumstances, Draco trounced off, robes billowing behind him.
Draco colored, and Harry almost laughed out loud at how seriously he’d taken her. Harry had always admired how much respect Draco had for his mother. “No, no, of course not, I was just--”
Harry grimaced, fearful and morbidly curious about the details. Before he could even sit down, get settled, and chug his cup of coffee, Harry apparated to the door in front of Kingsley’s office. He knocked hard, three times, and was greeted by the Minister’s tall frame.
“Then you wouldn’t have food either, Potter. You wouldn’t even be able to eat our leftovers.” Dudley responded, his beady eyes narrowing.
Draco sighed in resignation and did as told, slowly but surely gaining speed and strength. When he used too much of his knees and not enough of his muscles, Harry would place a gentle hand on his thigh and reposition him. Harry would shake his head whenever his mind began to wander or marvel at the softness of Draco’s skin.
“You were. Well,” Draco cleared his throat and waved his hand rather stiffly, without any of the grace he usually possessed. “No matter. Let’s begin.”
“Draco! We were...you know, doing stuff in the hallway and I took the Prince’s mask off and it was...yeah!”
Oh God, Harry thought, throat tightening in sudden fear. He couldn’t lie, could he?  “I can’t use magic,” He said before he did something even stupider than telling the truth. Draco was silent for a moment, eyes boring a hole through Harry’s forehead.
But sure enough, the man in front of him was indeed Draco. More dolled up, perhaps, but most definitely him.
"Alright, alright. I’m awake.” Harry said, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. The bell continued to chime as Harry sat up and dragged himself out of bed. “I’m coming!”
“So how is it, working with Malfoy?” Ron’s nose wrinkled as he said Malfoy’s name. “Have you considered resigning yet?”
Harry glared at them, cheeks slightly flushed, because well...her friends were right. “Shut it, both of you.”
“Dudley, my son, can’t you do this for me?” When Dudley crossed his arms defiantly, Vernon began grovelling once again. “How about this, Dudders? How about I buy you a new set of silverware, so you can eat like the beautiful prince you are?
Harry continued teaching Draco the ins-and-outs of gaining momentum and actually utilizing his other two limbs for a little under an hour, all the while trying to drown out unwelcome thoughts of Draco. When the two were finished, Draco climbed out of the river, grimacing at the dirt on his smooth feet.
A wave of heat pooled at the bottom of Harriet’s stomach, between her legs, at Draca’s demand. She obliged, pressing two fingers inside of her. Draca moaned, loud and needy, as Harriet shallowly began thrusting her fingers in and out. Harriet groaned, head falling against Draca’s chest. She felt so warm, so good.
And sure enough, she was, staring at Harriet cockily while leaning up against a stall. Her eyes were cold, calculating, and her arms were crossed. She grinned, white teeth bright in the dim light of the room.  “You don’t have your little mudblood friends to defend you? What are you doing to do, without them, Potter?” Draca said, pretty face contorting into a rather ugly expression of false sympathy. Harriet swallowed, taking no offence, and took a daring step forward.
Harry was startled awake in the dead of night by something akin to a gentle sob. He sat up and reached for his wand on instinct, only to set it back down when his tired mind processed what exactly he was hearing. Malfoy was...crying. Harry picked up his glasses, and squinted to see in the dark. A strip of moonlight illuminated Malfoy’s face, which was scrunched up. His cheeks were covered in fresh tear stains and his head thrashed back and forth, eyes still closed beneath wispy blond lashes.
Malfoy blinked and stared at Harry for a moment before shaking his head, hard. Recognition dawned on his features and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. “See? You’re alright.”
Harry snorted and placed his hand back on Draco's head, resuming his rhythmic hair-stroking. “So you haven't, then?”
His thoughts immediately strayed to that rich imbecile, Draco. He was a puzzle, to say the least; A complete snob with an absurd, glorified self-image. And yet he had still saved Harry’s sorry arse (perhaps, as compensation for the drowning incident)  and asked him for swimming lessons.
He remembered with a start that it was Tuesday. Time for his lesson with a very unqualified teacher. He shook his head at his own stupidity; a petty servant, teaching him to swim? It’s not something he couldn’t have figured out on his own. Or he always could have asked his father to hire a more capable tutor.
Harry tensed up and then he was kissing Draco sloppily, breaths quick. “Next time, sweetheart.” When Draco moaned in protest, Harry shushed him quietly, biting at his pink lips. “I can’t hurt you, alright? Will you be good for me and wait until next time?” He panted.
Vernon grabbed the hem of Harry’s shirt. “No dinner for a week,” He said, spit flying onto Harry’s face with every word. “And until you make up for this you’ll be sleeping outside.”
Before Draco could reply, Harry was on top of him again, tugging at Draco’s trousers and finally pulling them off. It was freezing, but somehow Harry’s hard body radiated warmth.
“Shut it, Potter, before I change my mind,” Draco scowled, flush deepening. “I’ve come to take you somewhere. With me.” Draco fussed with the unkempt hem of his robes. “T-That is, if you want to.”
“I dunno,” Harry mumbled. “He’s pretty easy to spend time with, now. Not that he gives me much to work with.”
Eventually, the orange sky outside of the small, stained-glass window notified Harry of the time. High noon. He quickly gave Hermione, the assistant, his finished book and made a swift exit. Hermione stared back at him pointedly, one bushy eyebrow raised.
“You’ll be useless while you’re like this,” Draco managed to breathe out, every muscle in his body tense. The desire to lean in, to be flush against Potter’s warm body, was overwhelming.
“Hmm?” Harry asked devilishly, hands tracing the hot outline of Draco’s cock through his velvet trousers. “Please what?”
“Yes, Uncle?” Harry asked, staring into the darkened room. He could see the faint outlines of the lush tapestries hanging on the walls and the lump that was Uncle Vernon’s body lying among the many satin blankets atop the large, mahogany, four-poster bed.
“No!” Harry said, somewhat appalled. “They can’t kick you out, the Prince declared that everyone of any status is to be invited!”
“Of course we’d allow it,” Harry said fondly as Scorpius yelled ‘YAY!’ at the mere suggestion. “He loves you, Narcissa. Really, he does.”
“Pansy, I’ve been meaning to ask you. I saw you dancing with a girl at the ball. You know, before Harry and I...left. Who was she?”
“Whatever you say, Your Highness,” Harry said, eyes glinting devilishly. There was something about making Draco flustered that turned him on to no end.
Once Malfoy turned back around, Harriet shook her head, trying to rid herself of highly inappropriate mental images that were suddenly flooding her field of vision. Ten more minutes.
“Oh, yeah. See you,” Harry waved stiffly and bent down to continue doing his laundry. He prayed for Draco to just go before things got out of hand, but he could still feel cold, grey eyes on his back.
“Lovely,” He groaned as he took the room in. There was one twin bed with stained sheets in the corner, a single decrepit rocking chair across from it, and a wardrobe missing one of its drawers. This was a nightmare.
Harry knew for a fact that he had not lit it, because that would use too much wood and end in a one-sided feud between himself and Uncle Vernon. Could Dudley have...no, of course not, Harry thought. Dudley would never do something nice for me.
Why me? Was all Harry could think as the Prince allowed him to place his hands around his waist. He was lean, but toned; Harry could feel the warmth of skin through satin dress robes. Despite not being able to see his face, Harry had a feeling that the Prince was probably gorgeous (if his body and complexion were any indication).  Not as gorgeous as Draco, of course, but still gorgeous, Harry thought. He shuddered, suddenly realizing how sickeningly smitten he had become in the last few weeks.
Harry raised an eyebrow, grinning at the realization. “Oh? Is that why you’ve suddenly become dumb as a door-nail?”
“Breakfast, boy! And be snappy about it,” The lump responded, and Harry quickly backed out of the room and into the bright hallway. His soft footfalls on the carpeted floors of the manor made his creaking steps down the wooden stairs leading to the kitchen sound even louder. He shivered in the frigid air and rushed to light the fire before beginning Vernon’s and Dudley’s breakfast.
Draco gasped when Harry snaked an arm around his waiste. Harry chuckled at his eagerness, pulling him closer.
“How do you think they found us here, then?” Harry said softly, voice wavering. “Look, Draco, they're going to kill me. I know that. But I don't regret this. You're the best damn thing that's ever happened to me.”
“My, my,” Lucius said with a smile that did not reach his eyes. “Surprised, are we? Did you not hear that explosion only a few moments ago?”
“Fuck you,” Draco hissed as Harry pretended to gently caress his hair, only to pull. “You know very well what I want you to do.”
“No. You look like a -- I dunno, like McGonagall in her nightclothes.” Potter continued cracking up at his own joke.
“If marrying a stranger is what it takes to preserve our family’s prestige then you will do it, Draco,” said Lucius, eyes growing steely.
Hope you guys enjoy chapter three. The sexual tension is getting pretty intense xD Thank you so much for reading!
“Beautiful,” Harry whispered, swiping his thumb across Draco’s swollen bottom lip and short circuiting his train of thought. And then Harry’s hand, warm and sure, found it's way to Draco’s increasingly tight trousers. “I’d hardly touched you last time, at the ball, and you were already a mess, just like this.”
“Yeah, I suppose so,” Harry thought, mulling over the last couple of days in his head. “He doesn’t say much anymore.”
Harry grunted, increasing his speed. Draco was gasping for breath, now, as Harry’s hand twisted in all the right ways.
Draco puffed out his chest. “Easy? Took me years of Transfiguration classes to master this, I’ll have you know.”
Draco could only look Harry in the eye for a short moment before embarrassment made him look away. After all these years, Draco would still feel embarrassed over how eager he always was.
“Look, I...I know you want me to shut up. It’s just. You’re kind, Draco. And good. I wouldn’t want...erm, I wouldn’t want to be with anyone else. And I want to make sure you know that.”
“I can’t marry him,” Harry said dejectedly. “He wouldn’t want to marry me, I’m a commoner. I can’t even use magic, remember?”
Draca shook her head solemnly. “He can’t waste his precious time on anyone else but me. Oh, look! It’s Harriet and her posse of mudbloods!”
“Do you mean to tell me that that's the main objective of this lesson?” Draco asked incredulously and mildly horrified.
“Not so fast, Boy,” Vernon growled. He had finally dragged his enormous body down the stairs and was now mere inches away from Harry, who could see the small hairs growing out of his pig-like nose. Harry swirled around, swallowing.
Before Harry could force his incompetent brain to reply, Draco continued, voice wavering. “I...I understand that you probably wouldn’t want to marry me, of all people. I’m a snob. And I’m petty. Not nearly as powerful as you are. I suppose I just thought...it’s alright, I can tell father that--”
“No, I don’t. Take your money and go. I hope you’ve brought towels,” Harry said. Draco reminded him of a soaked cat, droplets of water sliding down his abdomen and leaving dark spots on the dirt below.
He started when he saw that Hermione was inside of the carriage as well, dressed in a flowing white dress that made her appear almost ethereal. Her hair was smoothed back and her eyes were dusted with a sparkling powder.
Malfoy clearly couldn’t hear him-- he was too lost in the horrors of his own mind. His chest was rising and falling at a rapid pace and he continued thrashing about, only with more intensity now. Harry tried calling his name again, and when that didn’t work he placed a tentative hand on Malfoy’s shoulder.
“No way in Hell am I asking him to dance. I don’t have any robes to wear, anyway, just huge ones of Dudley’s that make me look like a toothpick--”
Malfoy got up first, and Harriet noted absently that her hair had had gotten much longer over the last few months. God, Harriet thought as Draca’s hips swayed as she walked, how can pull off Hogwarts robes so well? Malfoy peered over her shoulder, looking delectable and almost afraid; she was wearing Harriet’s favorite vanilla-flavored lip gloss.
The Prince said nothing; he just stood there, shadowed eyes boring into Harry’s own. Although Harry was beginning to find this behavior rather strange, he did not have time to dwell on the matter for the Prince had grabbed his collar, hands trembling with what Harry could only describe as sheer want. Merlin, Harry thought as he stared at the man in front of him, awestruck.
Draco, as ashamed as he was to be wearing such a ghastly ensemble, felt absurdly giddy. He was leading a flustered Potter deeper and deeper into the woods beyond the Weaselbies' house, making random twists and turns and cringing whenever his outerwear caught on a bramble. The sky above them was slowly fading from blue to a pink and orange gradient, bathing their eerie surroundings in a warm, honey-colored light. Harry’s green eyes, although muted by the dimness, were still striking.
This continued throughout the entire journey. Girls blushed and giggled as he passed by and many men dropped to their knees and bowed. As satisfying as this was, however, Draco felt a fleeting pang of concern that someday Potter would see this, would figure out who he was. He was not entirely sure why that bothered him, so he shrugged and continued on his way.
Narcissa smiled, taking Scorpius’ hand and leading him towards the door. “Enjoy your time with Harry, my dear,” She said to Draco before making a swift exit. Harry caught a whiff of her sweet perfume.
“Fuck!” Harry sat up and ran to the sink, splashed some cold water on his face, and rushed to get dressed. Merlin, he was exhausted. What he wouldn’t do for just a couple more hours of sleep.
Harry was about to burst out laughing-- these Muggle women sure were direct. And sharing women with Draco Malfoy of all people? Merlin. But before Harry could make a sound, Draco spoke. He was smiling devilishly, teeth practically glinting. Shit, Harry thought rather absently. When did he get so charming?
For a moment, as his footsteps echoed off of the marble floors, Harry wasn’t sure if Malfoy was indeed following him. And then, so quietly that Harry could hardly hear him:
“Oi, Potter, watch it or I’ll have father make sure there’s no wood for the fire in the kitchen for the rest of the week.”
By the way, if you're wondering how Harry and Draco had a child, let's just say some magic was involved. ;)
Draco’s mouth opened and closed a few times, wordlessly. Perhaps, Harry thought, Draco had no idea how to respond to this ingrate, this lowborn degenerate that was himself. With his mouth hanging open stupidly like that, Harry thought Draco looked sort of like a fish. A rather dashing fish. But regardless of how dashing, this Draco boy was still a pointy, foul-tempered fish.
“What is going on?!” Harry said in his harshest whisper possible. "I don't appreciate being kidnapped by my only two friends!"
Harry smirked, lubing up his cock and groaning at the much-needed friction. Draco squirmed at the sight, gaze fixated on Harry’s length, and licked his lips.
want to know is if I’m invited at all. And I hope Sirius made provisions for the safety of your muggleborn friend while in your future husband’s home.” Her smile was sharp.
At least, that was the general sentiment of the Wizarding World as more babies were born, as Aurors fought the last few Death Eaters in skirmishes and won, or they surrendered and were granted pardons, as the Ministry quietly reorganized itself according to new alliances.
The strange boy didn’t show up in the attic the next night. Nor the night after that. Teddy almost thought he had dreamed the whole thing up, but he couldn’t find the yo-yo that was a present from Grandpa Weasley.
Teddy smiled at him, and his hair shortened, turning almost wavy. Both his hair and eyes turned a golden brown colour. He had an ordinary nose, and ears that stuck out a little. “It’s very boring, innit?” He asked.
, he wrote, then almost leaving a blot when he could not find the words to continue. He had been spending almost every night after dinner telling his father about his classes. What else was there to say?
Harry wasn’t sure what that was, but he could hazard a guess. “So we never talk about it? Right. All settled then? I’m off to class.” And he walked away.
“What are you doing here?” Harry hissed at him, looking over his shoulder to see if anyone was behind him. He turned back in relief.
As soon as he could, Scorpius dragged his trunk up on his bed and spelled the curtains around his bed with a charm to deter people from even looking in his direction. His father had taught him that after he got his wand.
It circled the room once before flying out the open trunk lid. Draco peered through it, heart pounding, but all he could see was the carved ceiling of his son’s canopy bed. He walked up the stairs, hand too tight on the railing, and a few steps below, he reached out to close the lid with a too-loud thud. Then he sat down a little too fast on the step, his knees shaking.
At the door, Angelina greeted Harry with a punch to his shoulder and a nod. Their one-year old son, Fred had little use for words yet, but liked to zoom around the house like he had swallowed bees, so she had little attention to spare for the men trooping into her living room. And from the looks of him, George had started the party a bit early.
Even though he was expecting it, the sight still sent Draco’s heart sinking. He watched his son feed the creature, before letting it fly up and out the trunk.
“You don’t have to do that,” Malfoy interjected, shoulders stiff. “We can have a gentleman’s agreement.”
He knew his father had prepared food, but he didn’t want to open the trunk in front of other people, so he ended up sharing the snacks that Dominique and Lucy brought with them.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at Harry. “You might as well get started on your homework, Harry Potter.”
The green light of the killing curse met the red of his stunner. Their wands connected like it did that night at the graveyard.
He scooted a little to make room for Lucy, but a tall boy with dark skin and curly dark hair snagged the back of her cloak and pulled her to the other side of the table. “I knew you had it in you, Lucy!” The boy told her, rubbing the top of her head with his knuckles, which loosened her bun.
Harry stuck out his tongue at her, but he did grab his book bag to rummage through it for his notes.
On Better Days, his father would take him flying around the limits of their yard, which seemed to shrink every year. Sometimes, there were dancing lessons, which he pretended to hate, but secretly loved.
son. It was bad enough to have one parent deny him; Draco would not do the same. It was bad enough that he had had to give up his last name. He won’t give up anything else, not if he could help it.
“His name’s Scorpius Black,” Mortimer Bone, the Hufflepuff Prefect informed him. “Which you should know since he’s probably related to you.”
And then he spied Great Aunt Mildred’s face in the front row twisting and transforming into Aunt Bellatrix. She bared her teeth at him, before aiming her wand at Harry’s stomach.
Scorpius aimed the wand at him, a jinx forming on his tongue. Just because the other boy was a wizard didn’t mean he was
“Yes, Ron,” Hermione agreed. “Whatever our allegiances, war is coming. Better that we fight here and now under somewhat controlled conditions. Maybe we could even see what the Slytherins are capable of.”
He stood with arms crossed as if he was holding himself together through sheer will. “Beaubaxtons and Durmstrang will no doubt send their letters too. But Hogwarts will be more politically advantageous for you,” he said. “We’ll send our acceptance tomorrow. Then Kreacher will accompany you to the shops. We’ll have to get you your own trunk.”
Surprise registered briefly on Malfoy’s face. “Because the ritual will protect the child,” he explained slowly as if to a dimwit.
Harry felt power explode out of him. A bright light washed over him, bright yellow tinged with red, and warm, like a phoenix had burst into flames.
“Before we begin, I’d like to take the chance to welcome you all to Gryffindor,” he spoke. “I hope it can become a home to you. Please don’t forget to look out for each other, and if you need help, you can talk to your prefects or you can come to me. That includes if you’re having trouble in a class, or outside it. Now…” He clapped his hands once. “Let me ask you what kind of defence spells do you think you’ll need as a witch or wizard?”
With shaking fingers, he lifted the latch and used both palms to open the lid. The stairs were still there, and he breathed a little easier.
Harry was safely ensconced among the Gryffindors in the Great Hall. Even so, he could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him, like wizard laser beams. He jammed another spoonful of porridge into his mouth and swallowed with difficulty. Most people had the decency to be quiet, but unfortunately, he shared the table with a bright and chipper Hermione Granger, who was just rubbing it in.
Finally, the man gave up. “If the Dark Lord entered your brain right now, he would only pick up on your panic anyway.”
Scorpius blushed, terrified that he had offended her, but she waved it off. “It’s okay. I’m used to it.” She took a deep breath. “I know one thing for sure; I’m
Thirty-seven teenage pregnancies, and fourteen of them male, plus a couple somewhere in between. As far as they could figure it out, someone mistook a very powerful fertility potion for alcohol and spiked the punch with it.
He opened his eyes to thin slits and turned his head just enough to see someone’s too-blond head on the pillow beside him. It had the familiar shape of his life-long sworn enemy. (Aside from He-Who-Liked-Anagrams.)
Scorpius walked towards the stool with none-too-steady knees. He barely noticed the intense looks in his direction from around the room.
He knew very well that Sirius had been the last Black before he died. And then he saw the boy. And he knew right away who he was. How could he not?
Teddy Lupin was standing on a chair and mimicking Mimosa Glenwood’s hair for Reasons when he saw his childhood mystery. The friend he thought he had made up in a fit of loneliness. His hair turned from the candy pink braid to a magenta afro in a heartbeat, as he pointed at the kid. “Who’s that?”
Hermione paged through a sheaf of notes she kept from past DA meetings. “I could try writing a proposal, but Harry, you can’t even sit in as an observer. Especially not with the kind of spells we’re working on. We might need more instructors from the other years.”
“Really, Harry” Hermione said waspishly. “I understand how people can get emotional over a national sport, but drinking to excess isn’t the most appropriate way to celebrate.
There was one room, however, that immediately felt like home: Professor Longbottom’s Greenhouse. The scent of dirt and green, growing things made him take a deep breath as soon as he stepped inside. He found himself smiling, though when he met the professor’s eyes, he ducked his head a little. But the professor smiled kindly at him and at every student in the room.
Scorpius was a little disappointed, but soon the Headmistress was making a speech about new beginnings, and he struggled to listen through the rumbling of his stomach. Headmistress McGonagall enumerated the rules of the castle, which Scorpius memorized as best as he could.
Father had taught him the feather-light charm, but Scorpius didn’t dare use it on the trunk. He didn’t trust himself to mess the spell up, so he used a trolley at the station. Ceres obliged by perching quietly on top. His cat looked very different from the creature he had met a year before. Her brown-red fur was sleek and shiny, though she still had a bushy tail and a perpetually grouchy expression.
Their first session was on listing the rules of expected behaviour, and on naming tools that they will come to use. None of them felt magical in Scorpius’ hands.
Harry’s brows were drawn together. He remembered Teddy’s story about meeting a friend in the attic. He also remembered the way Kreacher had stilled, eyes blinking, before saying, “You is having too much sweets at night Young Master Teddy. That sounds like a good dream.”
The gardens weren’t as perfect. The grass was too long, and the roses were a tad overgrown and slightly wilted. But the breeze carried with it the scent of sunshine.
Teddy looked down at his hand. “You’re a little too young to play with a wand, aren’t you? Do you even know any spells?”
The year started with the Sorting Hat singing a different tune. Something about Hogwarts unity. Nobody was really paying any attention. But Harry mused that maybe if the Sorting Hat could see the room now—with its non-existent eyes—then it would wholeheartedly approve. In a corner, students wearing different coloured-ties reenacted quidditch moves with transfigured buttons and pocket lint. Inter-house carousing and celebrating led to inter-house dancing led to inter-house something, something. Sparks were flying.
Draco’s eyes were darker than usual. It took Harry a second to recognize the expression. He took another step back. “I’m as big as a whale, you idiot!” It wasn’t quite true, but he was feeling self-conscious as his bump grew bigger almost by the minute.
“Duty’s important,” Harry said flatly. He had his answer and turned to go, but Ron’s words came back to him and he said over his shoulder. “By the way, we’re opening up the DA to everyone not currently expecting. I would appreciate it if you came and helped out in my stead. Bring your friends, too.”
“Stop that right now, Frederick Weasley!” She said through gritted teeth and tried to kick his shin.
There were whispers of war, but they remained whispers, especially with Umbridge enforcing her edicts down the students’ throats. And so even though a number of students were aware of the ideological rift that would soon tear them apart, they preferred to fill their heads with everyday worries, such as the pimple on their chin resisting Madame Pomfrey’s anti-spot solution, the Transfiguration exam they forgot to study for, their undying crush continuing to ignore their awkward wooing, and the miracle that occurred on some Quidditch Stadium three hundred miles from Hogwarts.
His head buzzed with new things in it, though he had noticed that Professor Potter had been patient in explaining both magical things to the muggleborns and muggle things to the magical-borns in class. He felt like neither and like both, so he appreciated it even more.
Ron turned bright red, guessing who he wanted to talk to. “Why don’t you ask your betrothed to bring his friends to sit in on the next meeting? I’m sure he would like that.” Harry eyed his friend, but Ron just shrugged at him. “They’re more likely to come if the invitation was from you. And Malfoy’s gonna be your family, Harry.”
One night, shortly after Scorpius turned eight, his father was feeling under the weather and spent the day in bed. He was too weak to do his routine spells and even in sleep, Scorpius could read his father’s anxiety, so he thought he could do them instead. He slid Father’s wand out of his sleeve. The spells he had heard most often were song-like and he sort of knew the words, though he wasn’t that familiar with the wand movements. He walked clockwise in his father’s large steps and he repeated what he remembered, and when he reached the spot he started from, something felt different, so whatever it was must have worked.
“Hmm,” the shopkeeper said, looking at him over thin-rimmed spectacles. “Beech and dragon heartstring. A fortuitous combination for a young lad. You’ll make your own destiny with it, I am sure.”
There was a furore of howlers and the newspaper headlines were full of exclamation points. Harry grimaced at a stock photo of him from last year’s tournament. Now nobody would care about whether Voldemort had actually returned or not. They were too busy dealing with all these pregnancies. He rubbed the spot above his abdomen. He wished he had the luxury of not caring, too. But he had a target on his back. Or, he thought, smiling mirthlessly, on my forehead.
Harry sighed. “I’m sure Sirius is doing a good job. But. I’m more concerned about your thoughts on all this.” He waved at the air between them.
So not a creature, but a wizard just like Father? Scorpius had never heard that word, but he didn’t want to look more foolish than he already had.
George and Angelina had their own house in muggle London, warded to the hilt and regularly visited by overzealous Ministry inspectors—mostly Percy’s doing—as it was also where George’s lab was located.
Harry marshalled his youngest prefects the following night. Iason Holloway was a fifth-year muggleborn, polite, with shorn hair and muddy green eyes and a Beater’s build. He looked older than his age, and a touch intimidating. Good for discipline, maybe not so good for comforting the little ones. His counterpart was Mimosa Glenwood, candy pink hair braided down her back, setting off the darker tone of her skin. She looked at him with naked curiosity, but kept her mouth in a cool smile, for which he was grateful.
I wrote the first two chapters ages ago, and was in the mood to leave it at that for the longest time (with some domestic!Draco fantasies) so the chapters after this might be very different in feel... and the story has grown a little bigger than I intended.
“There’s only so many stories that I know,” Draco said, thinking of the war and all the silences that followed.
Anyone else feeling ambivalent about hp fanfic right now? I still want to get this done, but we'll see how I feel after. Also, I have chapter four plotted out, but chapter five is a big question mark. Why am I writing romance anyway? lol. Please ignore my existential crisis...
“You haven’t gone and fallen for that prick, haven’t you?” Ron asked, a little less belligerent than he usually was.
Harry nodded. “Well, never mind the speech, but I’ll be posting my office hours in the common room. And please feel free to nudge anyone in my direction as needed.” He had already spoken to the upper year prefects.
Ron dragged a hormonally depressed Harry to the all-Houses celebration that night. “This only happens maybe once a century, Harry. Fred and George volunteered as bartenders, and entire swaths of purebloods promised to raid their parents’ cellars. You can’t miss a party this epic.”
“They’re a quiet lot,” Iason said. “No trouble-makers so far, though you better watch the new Weasley.” He turned to the other prefect. “Fred will probably drag ‘er into trouble.”
Sirius jumped at the chance to go with him. He was finally free to walk around anywhere and he had missed Hogwarts, so he was relishing every second.
But Teddy had been too busy “mingling” in disguise among the Slytherins, picking up Very Important Gossip to actually pay attention to something as boring as a Sorting.
He was bursting with stories when he got back home, and Father had baked him a cake with frosting. It was a Good Day.
He admired the glint of purple at the tip of Dominique’s quill, and the emerald green that Lucy was using, but refused their offers to share. Father would find it extravagant enough that he would waste supplies, though he could always say it was practice; his penmanship could use the work.
Draco bit his lip. “Some of them did. Some people are cruel to others for the slightest excuse. But there were others who loved him as he was. And he had a good heart, so animals knew to come to him if they broke a wing or sprained a leg. He looked after even the ugliest creatures there ever was. Because he knew what it felt like to be judged for your looks.”
Harry grinned at her. He understood that perfectly, having had to listen to his share of patronizing iterations of ‘my dear boy’ and ‘this is how it’s always been done, Mr. Potter’ at the Ministry. He took his seat and poured for them both.
Harry’s hands had crept to his stomach instinctively. “My baby’s in danger?” His voice broke at the end.
The two exchanged looks before Iason shrugged. “’e was filling in for the year, ol’ Professor Quorum. Told us we’d be heroes if we were lucky. Put a sparkle in me eye.”
Even then, he only calmed enough to go back to sleep after Draco appeared at his side, holding Harry’s hand betwixt his own palms.
Harry cleared his throat. “I was wondering if we could have a private conversation.” Emphasis on private.
He drank slowly but steadily, watching Ron catch up to George. But Ron could hold his drink with the best of them.
The creature straightened, face already shifting back to its previous features, though with green hair that matched its eyes. “My name is Teddy. I’m a metamorphmagus.”
idea, but it was hard to say no to Madame Malfoy—wasn’t particularly fussy. But strange magic swirled around him.
Harry summoned his house elf, pure magic crackling the air in his quarters like the beginnings of a storm.
Harry soon realized why; the anniversary of the Battle at Hogwarts was in a couple of days. Everybody would be celebrating the victory, except for those still mourning their dead. Ron probably assumed Harry’s was suffering from the same ailment.
Most days, Scorpius spent on his studies. English and Latin and some rudimentary Runes, Basic Maths, Dark Arts and Defence, Potions, Charms, Transfiguration, Astronomy, Penmanship, Wizarding History and Etiquette, and in between the endless chores required around the house. Milking the goats, weeding the garden.
He flipped the pages toward the most recent entries and groaned at the tangle of entries, a great number of them about
Harry kept his nose in his textbook and thanked all the gods that he didn’t have to do anything but show up to his wedding. Malfoy did send him dress robes in deep blue trimmed with silver. And Hermione got her promise of safe passage tucked in her invitation.
He cleared his throat, and the headmistress gestured at the chair across from her. There was a steaming pot—Darjeeling from the smell of it—and a plateful of nibbles. The room was much more orderly than when it used to be Dumbledore’s. He looked up at the paintings of former headmasters, but they were all deeply asleep.
House-elves threatened to quit en masse when entire swaths of students came down with bad reactions to the typical English brekkie. While acting Headmaster Dolores Umbridge was calling for St. Mungos staff to floo in and quarantine the lot of them, Madam Pomfrey kept her head cool, casting diagnostic charms on a selection of patients across ages and genders. Even so, she had to fan herself a little when the results came out.
“All he needs is a fairy godmother, and he can wear glass slippers and go to the ball,” Harry said one night over dinner. Hermione and Ron and Sirius had been invited, so it was a little less dignified than the typical Malfoy meal.
Scorpius learned that fact even before he mastered his letters. Every night, Father had a ritual of walking clockwise from room to room, speaking protection spells. Kreacher brought him large books every few weeks or months that he would pore over, and there would be new spells. Sometimes they made the hair on Scorpius’ arms stand up. Sometimes, the back of his neck would itch, or he would sneeze and sneeze.
Sirius ruffled his godson’s hair. “You’ll stay within the wards of the Malfoy Manor until the child is born, then you can renegotiate if you’d rather live elsewhere. I made sure any conflict of loyalties was taken into consideration.”
It felt strange to sit at the table inside the library and write a letter to his father a few flights of stairs away, but when Lucy and Dominique had taken out their special parchment and inkwells with special coloured ink, Scorpius could not think up a reasonable excuse.
Harry winced inwardly. He wasn’t exactly hiding it, but it was still disquieting to realize how many people
Harry didn’t have the attention to spare to the chaos around them. His eyes were locked with Voldemort’s, as was his wand. But still, he felt Draco moving towards him, and from the corner of his eye, the wash of green that carried with it the promise of death.
Dumbledore smiled kindly at him. “Your youth and your magic are in your favour, dear boy. But marriage is still the safest option.”
“We will spend most of our time in this room and in other Greenhouses that are spelled to a particular climate,” the professor was saying. “Hogwarts does have various outdoor gardens, some of which are out of bounds, so keep that in mind when you are exploring. This late in the year, we will focus on proper harvesting techniques first, though for some plants we have specimens in various stages of growth so you will learn to recognize them in any season…”
His mind was so busy processing the erratic beating of his own heart that he failed to notice the sudden silence of the dance hall. Once he finally gathered the courage to tear his gaze away from the marble floor, however, he was shocked to see that all eyes were on him. Is it because I’m late? Harry thought dazedly as he scanned the room. He couldn’t see Draco and his heart sunk; perhaps he had decided not to come after all. One figure, however, did stand out to him. The Prince stood in the middle of the hall, turned towards Harry. He wore a navy blue masquerade mask and matching robes that fit his slender frame excellently, and his blond hair was slicked back behind his ears. The same shade as Draco’s, Harry thought. The Prince was dancing with a young lady in a fluffy purple dress until Harry met his eyes. He seemed to freeze, then, and immediately released the purple-dress girl and began walking towards Harry, who suddenly could not move his legs. Why would he be coming over here? Harry thought, stunned. He realized with a start that he should probably bow, so he began to bend his knees; however the Prince held up a gloved hand indicating that he stop at once.
Harriet felt Draca tighten around her fingers at the same time she was pushed over the edge. For a blissful moment, Harriet’s climax clouded her mind with sheer relief and pleasure. Draca writhed against her, gasping for breath, as she too shook with her release.
If Draco had been told where Harry was imprisoned, he would have gone there himself if not for the guards constantly forcing him back into his bedchambers. He’d never felt so helpless, so incapable. If he couldn’t save the man he loved, then who was he really? Draco shook his head, remembering the sound he’d heard just moments before. Had there been an accident? Normally, Draco would have seized this opportunity to flaunt his princely duties but this time around he felt detached, numb. He sat up in bed, too still, for a few moments until he could hear frantic voices outside of his door. Footsteps pounded above him, and it seemed that whatever had happened had put the entire castle staff into a frenzy. Draco stood up, smoothing out his shirt, and banged against his bolted door (after his third attempt at an escape, his father had demanded he be shut away).
“Not just a new case, Harry. We’ve...never seen anything like this from a run-of-the-mill witch or wizard,” Kingsley swallowed. “Someone is killing Muggles. Thirty of them thus far.”
“You don’t need to lie to me,” Harriet murmured, peppering Draca’s exposed neck with gentle kisses. “I feel it, too. We’ve been doing this for...I dunno, weeks? Don’t think I can keep this up. You know, the whole rivalry thing.”
Harry raised his hands from Draco's gelled hair, where he had been absently twirling the blond strands, and crossed his arms. He rose an eyebrow. “Have you, now?”
“You know, you really should learn how to swim,” Harry said, looking at a sopping wet Draco. His blonde hair was matted to his face from the dampness and his white undershirt was clinging to his thin (but toned, Harry couldn’t help but notice) body.
“Yes, Harry, we were wondering where you had gone,” Hermione said sweetly. Ron rolled his eyes and mumbled under his breath:
Harry shrugged, trying in vain to smooth down his hair, and walked out. The moment the door shut behind him, his throat constricted in sudden dread. What if Draco had come to break...whatever it was they had, off? Maybe he’d decided that Harry was beneath him, after all. After gathering his thoughts and taking a few deep breaths, Harry walked down the stairs gingerly. His eyes immediately landed on the back of a very blond head seated on the family’s worn couch. Mrs. Weasley was bustling around in the kitchen, apologizing over and over for making Draco wait.
Draco’s pale cheeks colored immediately in response to Harry's question. “Of course I have, Potter, you imbecile!”
“I’m still the Prince, you know! I could have your family in debt by tomorrow evening if I wanted to!”
THIS CHAPTER WAS SO FUN TO WRITE BA DA BOOM, HARRY KNOWS DRACO'S THE PRINCEE!!!!!!!! And the fanfic is finally starting to live up to its rating lol. Prepare yourself for smut soon. Also, in case you can't tell by now, I love torturing readers with cliffhangers.
As he strolled through the corridors on the way to the castle’s quidditch pitch, Draco Malfoy, esteemed heir to the throne, descendant of one of the most prestigious pureblood lines, bumped into someone for the second time in one day.
Through the magic of owl post, Harry had somehow convinced his two best friends to come visit him at the Inn while Malfoy was upstairs analyzing the crime scene photographs. Ron and Hermione were all smiles this evening-- and Harry couldn’t blame them. It had been ages since the three had been able to just go out and have a pint.
Draco flushed and cleared his throat. “Apologies. I--I’m supposed to notify you that the Carrows are heading west. Potter believes the Muggle areas in and around Truro should be evacuated immediately. Um. That is all,” Draco waited a moment for a response but heard nothing. “Potter, why isn’t he answering me?” He hissed.
“I’m...fuck,” Draco whimpered pathetically. A sharp wave of arousal shot through Harry’s body at Draco’s admission; he didn’t even need to touch his cock, just being inside him was enough. That very thought pushed over the edge, Harry thrust into Draco one more time, and then he was coming; entire body tensing with pure pleasure. Draco was not far behind, screaming Harry’s name.
Draco smiled widely like a proud child and continued clumsily making his way toward him. Once the two were just inches apart, Harry had trouble ignoring the fact that Draco was so close; every pale eyelash, every fleck of pale blue is his otherwise grey eyes, was visible.
“How exactly are you two idiots going to pull this off?” Hermione asked before Harry could reply, hands on her boyish hips.
Draco sucked in a sharp breath, and Harry almost missed the slight stutter of his hips against his own. Harry raised an eyebrow. “You're already hard. You really like being put in your place, don’t you?”
“Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed, waving a hand in front of Malfoy’s face. “It’s me! You’re in a shoddy inn, you’re safe!”
Hermione rolled her eyes, lashes thick and curled. "Of course we would save you, who do you think we are?"
It had taken strategic cajoling and bribery to get Draco out of their flat in such dismal weather, but in the end Harry had succeeded.
“F-Father…” Draco stammered, a million thoughts racing through his mind at once. “You...Are you referring to Harry?”
“Now,” Harry said, possessively taking Scorpius from Draco’s arms. “What would you really like, sweetheart?”
When there was no reply, Harry ventured into the kitchen. Any anxiety he felt on behalf of his missing husband faded when he was greeted by the beautiful sight of Draco with a tiny boy on his shoulders, baking something over the fire.
Potter opened the door for him-- a gesture that made Malfoy wrinkle his nose in distaste-- and the two entered. The smell of fresh butterbeer had Draco salivating; it had been his favorite back at Hogwarts. Various witches and wizards, some dressed in rags and others dressed in pristine robes, clinked glasses and laughed together. People soon began to whisper, pointing and nudging in the direction of The Boy Who Lived, and Draco suddenly felt very alone. After a moment, he gave into the temptation to take a look at Potter, who was already shaking hands with a grey-haired witch. Draco truly resented Potter’s fame. That was, until he caught a glimpse of his fine arse in those suit pants. Draco shook his head and walked towards Potter and the witch. He cleared his throat.
“I’ll get right on that,” Harry said, turning around and walking quickly towards the kitchen. Perhaps he had gotten away?
Draco tried to still his shaking hands and wiped them on his slacks. With a thick swallow, he read through it quickly.
“What?” Harry asked with a breathy laugh. “Do you really?You mean you’ve kept it all this time and never told me?”
Draco nodded, hard, and took a determined step towards Harry. “Purebloods can smell strong magic from a mile away, obviously,” He sighed, as if Harry should be aware of this. “It can’t be helped, I suppose. I must admit that you are doing a proficient job in teaching me, and to lose a qualified teacher such as yourself would be...regrettable. Regardless of magical abilities.”
“Malfoy,” She nodded curtly, eyes sweeping over the other witch’s body. “I’d appreciate it if you’d stop shitting on my friends.”
Ron scowled but continued working, thumbing through books and reading them at a snail’s pace. Harry began doing the same. The first book he came across was about to fall apart, all torn pages and floppy bindings. The cover page, however, was still completely intact.  Harry had a hard time reading it because the font was ridiculously tiny; his vision had always been terrible.
“Can I ask you a question?” Harry asked before he could stop himself. Draco looked up from his laundry and met Harry’s eyes, raising an eyebrow.
There was a tense moment of silence and then the door flew open. Lucius’ eyes were cold and empty as usual.
The night air was cool against Harry’s skin. He looked back at the cookie-cutter houses that reminded him so much of his childhood and shivered. Playing Muggle for an evening had been nice, but it was time to return home. His world needed him, after all.
When Harry awoke, it was strangely quiet. No bells, no booming demands. He realized sluggishly that it was still the middle of the night; the sun had not yet risen and the sky was a dewy, blackish grey. And then, he realized as he sat up, it was warm.
“You are dismissed,” Lucius said, waving a hand. Draco stood up immediately, repressing a smile, and retreated back to his quarters.
Thank you for sticking with us during this entire journey. I put my heart into this fic so I hope it could make some of you smile. AAAAhh I'm gonna cry as I type this, I can't believe it's done after all this time!
Harriet picked up the pace, eventually adding a third fingers, and Draca seemed to have lost her mind. But even so, she was able to sneak a shaking hand under Harriet’s robes and clumsily get her off.
“You’re late, you useless lump of a boy,” Bellowed Uncle Vernon as he stomped down the wooden staircase.
Narcissa raised a sharp, expectant eyebrow as she waited from Draco to continue. He sighed again, more dramatically this time and waited, but his mother continued staring at him sternly as she waited for a reply.
There was something in Draco’s tone and ridiculous mannerisms that hit Harry like a freight train. The acidity was merely an act, a defense mechanism, and it made Harry’s chest ache with something he was only just beginning to identify. Harry pondered this foreign emotion for a moment. Could it be that he actually had feelings for this brat? This absurdly lovable, attractive brat? Dread clouded Harry’s head at the realization. Why? Harry thought ruefully. Of all people, why him? Draco would never, ever feel the same way. Not only did class factor into it, but sexuality did as well. Draco probably had no interest in other men. Not that he would ever go for a servant like Harry if he did. Harry realized with a start that he had not yet responded to Draco’s retort; this could have been why the other boy was staring at him expectedly.
“Answering your question,” Potter glared at Draco and then used two of his fingers to lift Draco’s thumb and press it against the number three. Draco could hardly move-- was Potter trying to kill him?
That shut Draco up long enough for Harry to grab his slender waist and lift him up high for a bit of momentum. Draco successfully pushed himself out of the water and onto the gravelly earth.
Now it was Harry’s turn to snort. “Yeah, okay, Hermione. Probably didn’t even want to kiss me, he probably just had too much punch or something.”
“I…” Draco trailed off, wriggling her hips as if to urge Harriet on. “Fine. If you...if you hurry up, I’ll stop, too.”
Hermione blushed and stared down at the book in front of her, suddenly completely engrossed in her work. Ron, however, grinned proudly.
The King scoffed, tucking a stray strand of his whitish hair behind his pierced ear. “Of course I am, Draco. Why else would I say such things?”
A knight stepped in front of Harry, nodding at him (that’s weird, Harry thought. They’ve never acknowledged my presence before) and pushed the door open with controlled force. His biceps flexed beneath his shining armor plates, and Harry swallowed; perhaps he was going to be killed in a more painful way that he had originally thought. He blinked a few times as he was gently pushed into an extravagant room. The walls, painted a muted shade of salmon, donned floral paintings and golden candle holders. A large, plush bed sat dead in the middle, pink sheets reflecting on the tile floor. Real flowers, probably freshly clipped, made the room sickeningly colorful. Harry blinked, stunned and confused. Why the hell would they be sending him here, to such a nice place?
“Is this one of your ridiculous follies, Draco?” Said Lucius, voice erily steady . Draco shook his head.
“Y’know we’re off the clock at eight, right? You’re not getting paid for this,” Potter stood again, successfully this time, and took a few wobbly steps towards Draco. He placed a heavy hand on the desk for balance and then leaned down a bit. Draco caught a whiff of his shampoo and swallowed thickly. Why was Potter so damn close? They were practically cheek-to-cheek now and Potter didn’t seem to notice or care.
The next lesson with Draco came unusually quickly. This time, he actually showed up in a bathing costume. He lacked a shirt and Harry was yet again given a full view of his pale, toned chest; his stomach was completely flat and his waist was impossibly thin. He was so clean, so pristine. Harry swallowed when he noticed the way those emerald green bathing shorts hugged Draco in all the right places, and it took almost all of his self control to tear his eyes away from the beautiful sight. Merlin, he’s gorgeous, he thought as he willed himself to actually speak.
“That’s brilliant,” Harry said while giving the tent a once-over and poking at its various parts. Although small, it was sturdy and clearly reliable. Draco snorted, although he stood up a little taller at Harry’s reaction.
“Let’s get to bed then. Ah,” Potter raised his eyebrows when a small, tattered cot materialized in front of him. “Right on time.”
Harry woke with a start not even an hour later when said clock began chiming. Harry groaned and attempted to shut the damn thing off with a charm, but to no avail. He inwardly cursed himself for making it charm-proof. And then, Harry remembered why the clock refused to shut up. Work.
“Hey,” Harry whispered, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as he approached his two friends. “Can I talk to you guys about something?”
Draco looked around wildly, suddenly realizing that Harry was no longer supporting him. He gasped, grey eyes widening in fear, and immediately began to sink.
“Hello, Ron. Hello, Hermione,” Harry said, grinning. Hermione seemed delighted at his presence as usual, waving and uttering an enthusiastic: “Hello, Harry!” Ron smiled and mumbled a quick “Hello” of his own. Harry joined the pair at a table. In front of them was a giant pile of books without covers; most were incredibly tattered and poorly bound.
“Whatever you say,” Harry continued, voice wavering only slightly. Draco did not seem to notice; he merely scowled at Harry for a few more moments.
“My apologies, Father,” Draco said, repressing his smile with great difficulty. His heart was going a million miles a minute as the news sunk in. “I...thank you. Thank you,” He breathed, voice cracking slightly. Lucius squinted his eyes and nodded stiffly.
That shut Draco up for a solid five minutes. Harry, basking in his smugness, grinned like a fool at the flustered boy gripping his hand and tugging him onward. Soon they reached a clearing framed by leafy trees obstructing the almost-twilight sky, and Draco slowed to a stop.
Draco almost opened his mouth to tell Potter that he had already been woken up, long ago. He wanted to tell Potter about the time he’d watched a teenage boy, his age back then, getting sliced into pieces before his very eyes. Or perhaps about the time The Dark Lord bound and gagged a pregnant Muggle mother and cut the fetus from her body, and all Draco could do was sit and try to keep his bile down. But he kept silent.
Draco lay beside him, ivory skin still glistening with clean sweat. His eyes, although colorless, lit up the dim tent. Harry opened his mouth to speak, to tell Draco what words were practically spilling off of his tongue.
“You’re so fucking gorgeous,” Harry mumbled, taking his husband in. Draco flushed further, all the way down to his chest. Harry trailed kisses down the entirety of that flush. If they had more time, he would’ve made Draco beg for it.
After Vernon had forgotten Harry and his letter, he turned to Dudley who was staring down at the paper in disgust, nose scrunched. “I won’t go, father!”
And then Draco’s orgasm hit him hard. Wave after wave of intense pleasure pulsed through his body, Harry’s hand working him through every second of it. His thoughts were white, and Draco could have screamed, he wasn’t sure. Once the high wore off and Harry’s hand had left him, he sunk down on the soft grass and tried to calm his breathing. Only then did he realize that his hand was sticky with Harry’s come.
Harry lay next to a sleeping Muggle man and stared at him, gaze distant. The Muggle had broad shoulders, a kind smile, and was practically a head taller than Harry. These past few months, after Ginny had dumped him on his sorry arse (and deservedly so at that), Harry Potter had taken to shagging Muggle men and women. None of them knew his name, none of them wanted bragging rights about sleeping with the Boy Who Lived. They offered a respite of sorts from the ever-chaotic magical world that Harry had been thrust into at only eleven years old. Harry sighed quietly and pulled himself out of bed, careful to keep his movements small and quiet. The Muggle, whose name he had already forgotten, stirred slightly before resuming a soft snore.
“Father, you can’t be serious,” Draco said, handing the invitation back to him. “This is ridiculous.”
“I bet that’s an exciting job. I ran into a noble the other day, actually. Are they all so stuck up?” Harry asked with genuine interest.
Draco took a moment to find his voice. He cleared his throat. “Because I’ve watched them. I’ve seen it myself. They’re incestuous freaks who get off on pain. Cruciatus Curse began to bore them after a while.”
If it had been anyone else Harry would have fought with everything he had, but the trust he had for his two new friends was unyielding. He nodded pathetically and Ron’s grip eased up on him at the same time Hermione took her hand away.
Draco sighed against Harry’s lips; shivering slightly when Harry wrapped his arm around his waist and pulled him in closer. “I love you, too.”
Draco looked down through his pale eyelashes, cheeks pink, and nodded stiffly. Harry laughed, pressing down on his hip bones forcefully and pinning Draco down in the process. “Of course you do.” He ground against Draco, who moaned helplessly.
Malfoy opened his mouth to speak for a moment and Harry could just barely make out his rapidly flushing cheeks in the moonlight. His eyes flashed dowards to wear his hand intertwined with Harry’s. He pulled it away as if he had been burned. “Don’t...don’t ever speak of this. Please.”
Draco was trying to look anywhere but at the man in front of him. Of course, he thought with a grimace. Of course he’d end up having to work with Potter, of all people. The universe truly had it out for him, it seemed. The last thing Draco needed was to spend time interacting with Potter, to further fuel this unsettling obsession. To be reminded of what he had done-- how he sat and watched while his fellow Death Eaters had tortured innocent souls. Why was Potter, the personification of all things Good, even giving him the time of day? Why was he speaking to Draco like they were simple coworkers, rather than enemies?  He turned his wand in his pocket, over and over, until Potter finally cleared his throat.
Lucius failed to acknowledge the acid in Draco’s tone as he opened the top drawer of his desk and pulled out a sheet of shimmering parchment. He handed it to Draco.
“I don’t,” Harry said simply, deciding to change the subject before he had to explain further. “So, you work for the King?”
Hermione’s eyes widened, deep and hopeful. “Did he really? I threw the invitation away before opening it.”
“Fuck me. Do whatever...whatever you want with me. It’s...you haven’t been able to for a while and I...I need you to--” Draco’s sentence was cut off by Harry’s lips once again; he ground into Draco with such force that the two of them nearly toppled over. Draco, lost in the new friction, did not seem to notice. Harry, on the other hand, held him up with strong arms. He parted with Draco with the intention of undoing the top two buttons of his shirt, only to give up and decide to use magic to remove their clothes immediately. Sometimes Harry enjoyed the show, enjoyed taking Draco apart piece by piece. Sometimes, Harry would fuck Draco nice and slow until he was practically crying from sheer need; but today, he didn’t feel like waiting.
Draco nodded pathetically, beyond words. Pinned beneath him, Draco could do nothing other than take Harry’s cock, and judging by the way Draco was clinging to him like his life depended on it, he was more than fine with that. Harry bit his neck softly and then moved downwards, grazing his teeth over his collarbone as he thrust into Draco over and over again. Draco moaned loudly at the sensation, a stream of unintelligible profanity falling from his pink, swollen lips.
“Well you’re bloody useless,” Harry said as he pulled Draco’s slacks away from his taut body. Draco seemed not to have heard him; he said nothing, mouth dropping open slightly as Harry removed his own underwear.
“I’m not surprised. Bet he can’t swim either,” Before Draco could blow up, however, Harry continued. “Dunno if I’ll make a very good teacher but I suppose it’s worth a try.”
“Bugger off, Hermione,” He mumbled shyly, still unconvinced by their arguments. Draco Malfoy would never, ever, see Harry in such a way.
Narcissa laughed; a strong, sharp sound. “I’m only teasing, my dear,” She gestured to Scorpio, who was still clinging to her leg. “I’ve come to see my beautiful grandson. Do you two have anywhere to be? I would love to take him for a walk in the gardens, if you’d allow it.”
Harry woke up slowly, peacefully, with sunlight streaming through the shutters and warming the bare skin of his chest. He stretched and sighed contentedly, reaching for the warm body that was almost always beside him, only to find nothing. Harry rubbed his eyes, suddenly not so keen on waking up. As sappy as it was, his husband’s morning kiss was the only thing that could inspire him to get out of bed in the mornings as of late. That, and his absence. So, Harry begrudgingly yanked off his covers and stepped onto the cold marble floor of the Royal Bedroom, yawning as he did so. He inwardly thanked Merlin that it was spring; he would never have been able to survive the walk to the kitchen otherwise. Harry found that after being spoiled in the warm castle for ten years, he was no longer immune to the cold like he had been when living in Dursley Hell.
We have a new case. A case more brutal than we’ve seen since before The War. Please meet me in my office as soon as you finish reading this letter. Apologies for the excess copies-- I wanted to make sure this reached you as soon as possible.
“Don’t even start,” Harry mumbled, kissing Draco’s neck before his lips. Draco whimpered pathetically and leaned into Harry’s touch, already hot and hard against Harry’s thigh. “You would get on your knees and beg for it, if I made you.”
“I don’t know!” Draco snapped before he could stop himself. Any excuse to tear away his gaze, to distract him from the sound of his last name on Potter’s tongue. “They’re clever, these two. Could be anywhere.”
Harry rolled his eyes, a feeble attempt to repress his thoughts. “Get over yourself, Blondie, and get in the water.”
Potter groaned and stood up. He stumbled over to the bed-- Draco’s bed-- and practically fell into it. Before Draco could protest, Potter was snoring.
Hermione spun around and scowled at Harry’s loud entrance. He grimaced and mouthed “Sorry!” and that seemed to do the trick; her sharp features relaxed into a warm smile. Luckily, Ron was there as well, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder if he fancied Hermione. Why else would he come so often?
Harry thought as the blackened bits of egg quickly disappeared into Dudley’s mouth. He felt mildly ill.
Draco looked like a deer caught in headlights, suddenly; like he’d done something wrong. Harry immediately felt guilty and frowned. Perhaps Draco really was as incompetent as Harry had once thought.
“I suggest you watch it, Pans, because you just bumped into the Prince,” He grinned, taking Pansy’s proffered velvet-gloved hand. Pansy giggled.
“Now, Ron,” Hermione began sternly. “That could get Harry in trouble, or you could lose your job, or--”
Draco sputtered. “A Malfoy never backs down from a promise, I’ll have you know! Now teach me, Potter.”
“You weren't under the water for more than ten seconds. How else were you supposed to get in? I’m holding you now, aren’t I?”
Harriet didn’t bother to reply, already turning back towards her two friends. Ronda was looking at her, puzzled. “I had no idea you two were…” She gestured wildly with her hands.
“Who is she, mate? What’s she like?” Ron asked, suddenly much more eager to immerse himself in the conversation.
“I told him I was the Prince more than once actually! He’s just so thick that he didn’t believe me!”
Minerva shook her head. “I had other responsibilities then, though I suppose that sounds like an excuse now.” She mock-glared at Harry. “Do better than me, Mr. Potter. That’s an order.”
He slid the yo-yo into his pocket, made sure he had Father’s wand, before stepping in, closing the lid behind him.
But when he let the toy roll down the string, it didn’t go back up. Teddy laughed, which made him angry. “It’s okay. It takes a few tries. You need to do it faster. At least the first few times.” He removed the toy and winded the string up again.
When the hat shouted, “Gryffindor,” Harry could not help but feel a leap under his chest. Something like pride mixed with the intense curiosity being kindled there.
Teddy yawned, missing what he said. “It’s almost morning. I should get some sleep, or I might drown in my oats.”
Voldemort attacks. Will the protection continue after I’ve given birth? Since we both know what they’re really concerned about.”
“Shut up, Ron.” Hermione was trying her best to browbeat them into studying but she was about ready to give up. “The real miracle is that you didn’t get anyone pregnant.”
back so you’re still in danger, but you guys don’t seem to understand what this pregnancy thing means for the Wizarding world.”
Harry shrugged. “You can have mine.” Ron frowned at the implied charity so Harry continued hastily. “I’m pretty sure Malfoy is sending me something to wear.” He gestured at the invitation. “He already planned everything else.”
Draco straightened, wincing when his back cracked and his knees groaned. Weeding the garden was one of those tedious tasks that plagued his days; he was convinced Professor Sprout had been lying about the lack of an effective weeding spell, but hours and hours of fruitless research at the Hogwarts Library—and the Malfoy Library during summer—had persuaded him otherwise. Apparently, spells could not distinguish between such arbitrary categories as ‘weeds’ and ‘useful plants,’ and to attempt to do so could irrevocably damage an entire crop.
They bent their heads over the toy, and Scorpius bit his lip, determined to master this strange skill. Time passed quickly. Scorpius only realized how long they'd been playing when the sky beyond the window changed, and the strange shadows in the room revealed themselves to be boxes, coat racks, and other normal things under dust cloths.
Later, when Scorpius finally fell asleep, he tucked the threadbare blanket around the young boy’s shoulders. His hair was black, a little unruly, and so very much like his other father’s. But other than that, Scorpius took after his side. They had the same pointy chin, the same grey eyes. He wondered if that would prove a blessing or a curse.
The last thing Scorpius expected this morning was being cornered by an older Hufflepuff on the way to the Great Hall. “Excuse me. I need to go,” he mumbled, managing to slip around the other student and walk away, but an arm stretched impossibly long to pluck at his collar. He whirled, mouth agape. The older student’s face shifted into something very like his own. Scorpius pointed at him, rendered utterly speechless.
Scorpius could recite his lineage back through thirteen generations, but Father had warned him to keep his parentage a secret as much as possible, so he just shrugged at the girls. “A distant uncle, I believe.”
Harry shakes his head and looks back towards the lake. The judges are still deliberating about something. Harry doesn’t care if he’s honest. He came back last, so he won’t be scoring great. Not that it matters. Harry never wanted to be in this tournament at all, so who cares if he wins or loses?
“Good,” Ron says just before his face turns into a scrawl. Hermione sits down next to Harry, accompanied by Krum. That explains the scrawl on Ron’s face.
Draco is silent. Harry thinks he hasn't spoken to anyone at all since they arrived. Blaise tried to ask him how he was doing when they had just arrived, but Draco hadn't responded. He stared at his hand, just like now. He watches as his finger scratches open his left forearm again. Harry wants to reach out and stop him from hurting himself.
Ron and I decided to go together because we only had one minute left before the train would leave. So we ran towards the barrier and crashed right into it. It wouldn’t let us through. We pretended that we had lost control of the trolley when a guard started yelling at us. We didn’t understand what was going on. Why had the gateway sealed itself off? I tried pushing my trolley through it while we watched the seconds tick away on the clock.
He takes a sip of his lemonade. It’s a nice day today. The sun is out and spring is in full swing. Neville and Lily are planting out some seedlings on the other side of the garden. Iris is inside with her head in one of her favourite books. Draco loves books too. He could read all day if it was up to him. He’s probably reading right now, on a ledge somewhere in the castle. Does he ever think about Harry, or about how he was in this house last break, celebrating Christmas with them all? Harry can’t stop thinking about it. Every room has a memory with Draco in it now.
“You still want to pretend that you don’t fancy him?” Hermione asks when Harry sits down next to her. She already has a book on her lap, as if she never left for the holidays.
Draco didn’t let go of my hand when we walked up to the stone steps to the entrance. Nott bothered us for a minute, joking about how I had fainted but Professor Lupin stepped out of the carriage behind us and asked if there was a problem, so Nott, Crabbe and Parkinson moved along, leaving us be. We walked into the entrance hall and I was just about to step into the Great Hall when Professor Snape called out, saying he wanted to see me. Hermione was pulled away by Professor McGonagall at the same moment. I turned to Professor Snape, Draco wanted to follow me, but Professor Snape told him to move along. I told him I come and find him as soon as possible and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before I followed Professor Snape to his office in the dungeons. It seems Professor Lupin had sent an owl ahead to notify my head of house that I had taken ill on the train. Before I had the change to reply, Madam Pomfrey came into the office and made a big fuss. I’m glad Professor Snape told her off when she suggested that maybe I should stay the night in the hospital wing, saying I looked well enough to sleep in my own bed. I think he didn’t want Draco sneaking around the castle on his first night back. I was ordered to eat more chocolate and come by the hospital wing if I still felt cold and clammy today.
Draco looks back at Harry. “I don’t think I’m ready to see everyone right now,” he says. Harry nods his head and gets up on his feet again.
We tried to tell her that she was taking on too much with all the classes she’s taking, but she wouldn’t listen to us. She just said she made a mistake and that she had to go to see professor Flitwick to say sorry. And with she just left. Draco shook his head and took Hermione’s Arithmancy book that she had forgotten and we went to grab some lunch.
“I don’t know,” Remus says. “It’s always been Sirius for me. I never had to go through getting my heart broken.”
In the evenings I hide away in my bed, with the curtains closed. When the other boys come into the dormitory they just say mean things about me, but leave me mostly alone. Zabini once told them to stop making fun of me, but they were mean to him the next day, so he stopped saying anything. Malfoy keeps saying it’s a shame that the great Harry Potter is only a half-blood and that my victory over the dark lord was probably over exaggerated. No way could a small insignificant wizard like I have stopped the greatest wizard of the age.
Scorpius looked up at him—though at the rate his son was growing, it would soon be the other way around—and Draco read the fear behind his gaze.
Two girls stood at the door. “Hi! Can we share the carriage?” One of them asked. “We just need to escape our overbearing siblings.”
And then he felt it: a sharp pain in his forehead, and Voldemort’s satisfaction rising in his throat. Harry turned around, free hand going for his wand.
Scorpius felt uncomfortable with the scrutiny, but the joy of holding his own wand soon overshadowed it.
But the wand… well that one they couldn’t afford to skimp on. Kreacher brought him to a shop called Ollivander’s and he tried out what felt like hundreds of the bloody things, until one felt right in his hand, emitting blue and green sparkles when he waved it.
This was such a bitch to write. I had writer's block for a while because I just couldn't face my own outline--which is probably a sign that the plot needed changing! Thank you for the kudos and the comments!
Mimosa rolled her eyes. “I’ll see that she gets some sensible role models. They followed along the tour like good little lambs,” she assured Harry.
The other Gryffindor boys were already in their beds, though some were still whispering to each other, when Scorpius slipped into the trunk to meet his father.
The house-elves prepared a meal for him, which he ate out in the garden. It was well-tended, and smelled of rue and yarrow, but beyond its careful hedges, he had a view of rolling hills that were wilder, filled with tall grasses and gnarled trees.
Hermione elbowed Ron, who announced that he was making a food run. “Any special cravings, Harry? I heard Mikaela from seventh year requested a squid and squash pasta.”
Walther pushed his face away even as he lengthened his nose to something sharpish to sting his friend’s palm. “Quit that, you nob! Weren’t you at the Sorting?”
“It’s a muggle toy,” Teddy answered, stepping forward and ignoring the wand Scorpius was still pointing in his direction. “I can teach you.” Then he slipped a finger into the looped end of the string and snapped his wrist. The toy rolled down and up, and the sides lit up in bright orange.
He was conscious of Malfoy’s eyes on him, in particular, on a part of his anatomy that was still sore from last night’s debauchery. He was blushing now, but most of the school were roaming the hallways like zombies, so nobody noticed.
A blunt shaped head emerged. It was a snake, light green and a pattern of blue diamonds down its back.
Father didn’t bother hiding the stairs after Scorpius had discovered it. He just pretended that it wasn’t there.
“Frankly, I didn’t expect you to say yes. I’m still pinching myself,” she said with a wry smile. She looked both older and younger than Harry was expecting, wiser and stronger somehow. She carried the responsibility well, though it had been quite a burden since the war ended, what with the need to rebuild the castle and regain the trust of so many parents whose children had been put in harm’s way.
with a contemplative finger. Scorpius had tried to describe the world outside as he saw it, maybe to share the experience of it with Draco. He thought of the row of Malfoy pensieves lining one of the Library Annexes now locked behind Ministry wards and out of his reach, maybe forever. He appreciated the gesture. Maybe the world outside was Safe after all.
Harry had reread the incidents from the previous year more closely. Fred had gotten into a lot of fights, most of them with Slytherins. There were pranks as well, but there was a worrying element of humiliation to them.
Harry glared at him, but he was secretly relieved. The lessons gave him a headache, and he had a feeling his baby doesn’t like them either.
Harry bit his lip, meeting Professor McGonagall’s eyes. Her face was stiff with disapproval, but she nodded at him, confirming what the others said.
Scorpius froze for a minute, before carefully petting the beast’s head. It let out a noise very much like a purr.
Harry nodded at the gargoyle while ascending the stairs that led to the Headmistress’ office. He didn’t know what to expect of this meeting, but it brought back memories of being summoned by Albus Dumbledore for one of those cryptic chats that, in retrospect, was more evidence of the man’s gentle meddling.
“The Blacks used to have muggle tenants, farmers, but not in the last century or so,” Kreacher explained. “There’s a muggle village close by, but relations are…
Draco had been reading the same line for hours, his chair turned towards the door. He stood as soon as he heard his son’s footsteps. Scorpius ran down the steps and into his open arms.
But now that he knew, Scorpius could not help but wonder about that world. He had a lot of questions that his father could not answer. Kreacher was sent out for more books, this time muggle ones with brightly-coloured covers, and funny pictures that didn’t move.
Harry asked after its rock and its supper, before watching it slither away. He was aware that Draco had stiffened at the first word in parseltongue, so he pulled his arm away and took a step back. “Problem?” He asked softly.
Scorpius grew up surrounded by magical objects, but most of them were old, and the spells upon them had long since faded. Father’s layer of new spells was mostly for protection; he rarely bothered to refresh the charm of an old music box, for instance. The one mirror they had showed him various angles of his reflection on command but was otherwise silent, and the snake-headed spigot in the tub only gave a soft hiss when he took extra long in his bath.
“I loathe you. Why I’m even with you in the first place is beyond me. I’d say you’re lucky to have me!” Draco says, voice dripping with what anyone else would interpret as leering confidence. When Harry meets his grey eyes,however something dark and lonely is behind them. Harry has never been skilled at interpreting the emotions of others, but this is glaringly obvious. Defeat. Self-loathing.
Draco followed obediently and sat delicately on one of his father’s silver-encrusted chairs. Lucius took a seat across from him and folded his hands together with grace.
Harry growled, thrusting impossibly deeper inside of Draco’s tight, wet heat. Draco was a vision, all broken moans and occasional curse words. Harry was already close and he could tell by Draco’s current state that he was as well.
“I'm not--” Draco stuttered, and Harry couldn't help but crack a smile. “I'm not a blushing virgin, Potter!”
Harry stepped out on his own, practically tripping in his bulky shoes in the process, and the three made their way over the daunting, wooden door of the castle. Two knights, completely still and quiet, held axes up to their chests. Harry paled; Ron, however, seemed very pleased to see them.
“I was making a point!” Draco whined, throwing his head back in exasperation. He groaned, lazily creating circles with the tip of his wand, and a pile of crumpled clothes appeared on Harry’s lap. “There you go, you degenerate. Take off those tatty things.”
“Till tomorrow,” Draco replied, watching Harry give one final wave before he jogged back up to the manor.
Harry was about to decline her offer and tell her that he was just fine on his own, but she continued speaking before he could do so.
"Sure, sure," Harry taunted, ghosting the pad of his index finger over Draco's entrance. Draco took a sharp intake of breath, wriggling slightly,and Harry idly wondered how they were going to pull this off on such a small armchair. He couldn't bring himself to move Draco, however, not when he was staring up at Harry so beautifully .
Harry did as told, stopping in his tracks when he saw who was sitting in one of Kingsley’s plush office chairs.
Malfoy’s gaze was focused intently on his own shoes, and Harry noticed a sheen of sweat on his forehead. His right foot tapped rapidly against the carpet. His eyes were more sunken in than Harry had ever seen them; they were surrounded by purple circles that just made the man look miserable. Harry felt a twinge of pity. He nodded curtly at Malfoy, who would not meet his gaze in return.
After a few wrong turns and few stuttering commoners assisting him with directions, Draco had made it to the river. He was shocked to see Potter already sitting on the edge, dipping his bare feet into the slow-moving water. He was staring at the sky, delicate features illuminated by the sun, and Draco was stunned into silence. His eyes were so green, so different from Draco’s own harsh grey. God, it had been ages since Draco had been with anyone, much less someone so beautiful--Draco shook his head, rather ashamed of himself. Was he really so desperate that he found a petty servant attractive? He grimaced, however still failed to remove his eyes from Harry's person. Finally, after noting the faint red highlights woven in Harry’s black tresses, Draco cleared his throat.
“No, Father, you know I would never jest about such a thing. Please, I...I love him,” Draco was surprised at his own words but even more surprised at how natural it was for him to say them.
“I would have been fine on my own,” Draco said, cheeks tinged with pink as his eyes flitted over Harry’s shirtless form. “Didn’t you say you had places to be?”
"You're so easy," Harry said, amused and turned on all at once. "Who knew our kingdom's Prince would be so lascivious?"
“You will not,” Lucius said, voice suddenly rising in volume. Draco flinched. “Marry vermin. Do you realize how absurd this request is? You will not allow a Muggle to lay a single hand upon your skin, Draco.”
Upon reaching the river bank, Harry sighed with relief as he set his many bags down. He watched in amusement as Draco struggled with his small load, almost tipping the entire thing over in an attempt to set it down.
Draco turned away with a swish of his green robes and resisted the urge to kick dirt in Vernon’s face. Now, he thought determinedly and he stomped away from the poor excuse of a home, if I was an idiotic fool by the name of Harry Potter, where would I hide? Draco pondered his options. The market place was completely deserted now, being well past 12 o'clock midnight, so that was out of the question. And then it dawned on him. The river! Draco began running almost immediately, cursing loudly whenever his heeled boots caught in the gravelly turf beneath him.
Pansy giggled like a schoolgirl, eyes suddenly twinkling with a youthfulness that Draco hadn’t seen for years.  “That was Hermione Granger. She’s a librarian’s assistant. She’s quite sexy, isn’t she?”
“I...I’m ashamed to admit that I am as well, petty Squib,” Draco blushed so gorgeously at that that Harry couldn’t help himself; he picked him up bridal style, long legs and all, and twirled him around awkwardly. Draco let out a shocked “eep!” only to release a string of curse words; Harry could make out “Potter what the FUCK are you doing?!”
“Oh, you know,” Harry mumbled, taking in the clean scent of Draco’s soap. “I’m just thinking about how much you love it when I fuck you, even after all this time.”
Harry raised his eyebrows and stood up, wobbling under the weight of the papers before steadying himself. “Alright then. Follow me.”
Draca rolled her eyes, pale lashes reflecting the sun oozing from the open ceilings. “Oh please. I can say whatever the hell I want here. My father will make sure I don’t get in any ‘trouble’ for speaking my mind. He opted me out of Herbology homework just yesterday, you know.”
Harry looked up, finally taking in Draco’s current state. Although he still wore one layer of undergarments, his legs were spread lewdly. Harry sighed at the beautiful image before him, shaking his head.
She rolled her eyes, which were painted green and lined with black. “So intimidating. Here’s my ‘damned’ advice, you fussy thing: Go. Find. Him.”
“Can’t even keep track of today’s date, Potter?” Draco smirked-- the insult felt a bit forced, but it provided a comfortable familiarity.
“Ugh,” Draco said under his breath. He changed into a fresh set of pajamas, more easily this time now that Potter was out cold, and tentatively climbed into the cot. It was stiff, so different from the custom mattresses Draco had slept on all his life. He grimaced and shifted, trying to get comfortable, before placing his head on the pillow. He inhaled and the smell of Potter hit him like a freight train, overwhelming his senses and his surroundings. Draco was hard in seconds, and any desire he had previously had to get some sleep left him in a flash.
“You already know how to stay afloat, you hoity-toity arse. What do you even need my help for?” Harry asked caustically.
Draco was at a loss for words. Part of him was tempted to reply with sarcasm but he could tell from his father’s cold, empty stare that he was already unhappy with him. “No, Father.”
Harry swallowed thickly; it’d been so long since they’d had enough alone time to do this, and he felt just as desperate as Draco was acting. Without any gentleness, Harry shoved two more fingers into Draco, who took them like a chant. He whimpered, pushing his hips up.
Harry grumbled and only pulled Draco closer. “Stay,” he said, voice gravelly, and so fucking sexy that Draco shivered again, a pang of arousal muddling his senses further despite the fact that he’d just came.
“You know,” Chimed in the other woman, “I love men in uniform. Really gets me going. Do you two...do you maybe want to come back to our hostel with us?
He scoffed and nodded, like it should have been obvious. So Harry numbly made his way over to the Prince, who still refused to utter a word. Strange.
Potter snorted. “Why am I not surprised? Lucky for you, I won’t fight you on it. I’ve slept on much worse.”
“Okay, okay,” Harry muttered, leaning in to capture the Prince’s lips once again. “I’ve got the message, uh, Your Highness. I’ll kiss you.”
He came to a stop in front of a black mahogany door, carved with writhing serpents- the door to Draco’s father’s office. The retainer knocked with a gloved hand and upon hearing “You may enter,” promptly opened the door for Draco and announced his entrance.
“Ah! Sorry, sorry. Shouldn’t make assumptions!” The witch fumbled with her notebook, an embarrassed flush rising to her already ruddy cheeks. She flipped through the pages. “Let’s see here...oh, dear. I’m afraid we only have one room available at the moment. I truly do apologize! We can give you a cot for the floor.”
He abruptly fucked into Draco, who cried out in relief. He thrust into Draco exactly how he knew he’d like it; all force and power. It only took a few thrusts for Draco to lose all of his control, calling out Harry’s name like a dying man. Harry, engulfed in the softness of Draco’s body, barely registered the sharpness of Draco’s nails digging into his back.
“Don’t...make me ask you, Potter,” Draco said in an attempt to preserve some of his dignity. Harry only laughed, sitting up and removing himself from Draco in a swift movement.
Harry’s chest was heavy with the realization that the book was almost finished. He would have to go to the library tomorrow and exchange it for something else. What else was he supposed to do during his fleeting free time during the night, when it was too cold and dangerous to roam the streets?
“Sure, sure. Your manners are just astounding, Prince Malfoy. Do you need me to walk you home? It’s getting dark and bandits tend to come out at this time of night. Not that you would know,” Harry mumbled, avoiding Draco’s cool stare.
Harry had to admit that he was attractive. Not that he would ever be interested in such a person, but still. He could recognize that the man was aesthetically pleasing. Draco resembled an ice prince, something cold and complex and sharp; almost like a veela disguised in glamour. Now, Harry thought as his stream of consciousness finally began to slow, How the hell do I teach an incompetent noble to swim?
He heard a booming knock on the door of his bedchambers; one that was strong and short, unlike the feeble tapping of his many servants. That could only mean one thing.
Potter had both hands on his desk now, looking directly at Draco, who was finally forced to meet his eyes. “How do you...how can you be so sure?”
After almost two hours of studying Gillyweed properties (Harriet was all too familiar with the subject, and she shuddered whilst remembering its taste), she was just about ready to keel over from boredom. Professor Sprout was a wonderful man, but he could certainly drone on and on. When Harriet remembered her post-class plans, however, she a thrill shot through her body. She crossed her legs and drummed her short, red nails on the potting table in front of her. Just a fifteen more minutes, she thought eagerly. Rapid images flashed inside of her mind, snippets from their latest encounter. As per usual, their meeting had begun as a bitter battle of both physical and mental proportions; although, every half-assed shove that Harriet directed at Malfoy was, in reality just an excuse to get her hands on her. Harriet had ended up shoving her up against a bathroom stall, disguised as an act of malice; but Malfoy had seen right through it. Harriet shuddered in her seat as she remembered the way Malfoy had parted her legs for her, so pretty and eager…
Scorpius has heard of Professor Potter. Kreacher had gotten him a history book of the War that his father only hinted at. It had answered some of his questions and raised even more. But he was always careful about questions. He had read about the great Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizarding world, and to meet him in person… was a bit of a let-down.
Jagged pain pounded behind his eyeballs. For a second, Harry thought that he was under attack, and his hand instinctively reached for his wand, but it found someone else’s wand. Someone else’s thicker, warmer, and not-at-all-wooden wand.
Thanks for everyone's comments, kudos and hits! And pre-emptive apologies if I'll make you wait a while for the next chapters. Hope everyone is staying safe!
Scorpius flinched, but nothing else happened. Teddy did it again, this time doing something complicated, so the thing swung around, lights still blinking, then rolled right up into his hand.
He had gotten a little too reckless on a job three years ago and landed himself at St. Mungo’s with a curse that took time to heal up. After that, the Ministry pushed through his appointment as Head Auror when he had been too groggy to say nay. The job was three-parts glad-handling the press, and one-part making his case to the higher-ups for more resources, and two-parts knocking Aurors’ heads together for making foolish mistakes. He had hated it with a passion, and he only realized it when the words in McGonagall’s letter reminded him that he had other options.
“You’ve always been my brave one,” Draco murmured, understanding the reason for that fear. He had thought Scorpius would be just like him, but maybe a part of him was pleased that his son would have a different fate.
“Is war coming?” Ron asked idly. Hermione and Harry turned to gape at him. Ron scratched his head. “I mean, I know
“There’s no way I’ll marry you,” Harry hissed and walked away. He pretended not to hear Malfoy’s murmur.
The little garden inside the trunk was his favourite place to be in the world. Scorpius could name every plant in it and spent a lot of his childhood weeding and harvesting vegetables to grace their table. The weather inside the trunk was borrowed from a mild countryside, and it was similar in feel to the Greenhouse.
Harry doesn’t say a word. He just stares at the front of the class where Binns has started his lecture. Not that Harry hears a word that is being said. Sometimes he hates his friends. What’s good about Malfoy struggling with school for no good reason? And why doesn’t he want to be helped by Harry? Harry would be grateful if someone would help him if he couldn’t hear a single thing. Even now, when Harry wishes he couldn’t hear his friends move on to the next topic as if Malfoy isn’t important, he’s glad he can hear them. And maybe they are right. Maybe Malfoy isn’t that important. He did manage to pass the last two years without any help from Harry and his friends. And what does Harry know about him anyway? He only knows he’s deaf and doesn’t speak. It doesn’t mean he’s an okay guy. Or worth Harry’s time. Maybe Harry should just forget about him and focus on the upcoming Quidditch match.
“How does he do that? He figured out Fleur was pregnant before they told anyone too.” Harry shakes his head and looks at Teddy, who has climbed on his chair at the head of the table and has his thumb in his mouth again.
Harry spots Malfoy at one of the tables in the back. The seats next to him are still empty. It seems that nobody wants to sit next to crazy, silent Malfoy. Harry takes a deep breath and pulls out the seat opposite Malfoy. He sits down and pulls some of his homework out of his bag. Malfoy looks up from the book he was reading. He’s got a quill in his hand and a large piece of parchment next to him. It’s filled with words, so tiny, Harry can’t read it from where he sits. Harry smiles at Malfoy and then opens his own book. He finds the page about the Full Body-Bind Curse. Flitwick wants them to write down all the proper uses of the charm, when you’re allowed to use it, and what the consequences are for messing up the wand work. Harry hadn’t paid any attention in class when Flitwick explained the charm. He was too busy plotting his plan to get through to Malfoy. So now he’ll have to read the entire chapter and figure out what to write in his essay.
Harry doesn’t hesitate and runs down the stairs. He turns to his left and then stops in his tracks. Draco stands in the middle of the hallway, with his wand in front of him. Neville lays on the floor only a couple of meters away from him. He isn’t moving. Is Harry too late? Is Neville already dead? And is Pettigrew still here? Is that why Draco has his wand out?
“I’m sorry, I was just thinking. I should try to forget about Malfoy. It’s never going to happen anyway. No need to upset Ron about it too. He won’t understand, Hermione,” Harry says.
“I know,” Harry says. “I’ll promise to do better next year. I now have a proper study buddy who makes me do the work.”
Later that day, Draco and Hermione were allowed to see me for a couple of minutes. Hermione had told Draco everything she knew about what had happened and they wanted me to fill in the rest. I told him everything, about Quirrell, the mirror, the stone and Voldemort. Hermione screamed out loud when I told them Voldemort had been hiding underneath Quirrell’s turban. Draco just grabbed my hand and held it tightly. And that just made me smile. I kind of like it when he holds my hand. It makes me feel safe.
“Oh no. No, you don’t,” Ron says. “The thing you and Hermione been keeping from me. It’s this, isn’t it? You’ve got the hots for Malfoy!?!”
Zabini shakes his head, his eyes haven’t left Harry who is still staring up at him from his spot on the bench.
Harry just needs to forget he ever knew Draco. He needs a fresh start. One without the memories and the pain inside his heart.
“Mr Malfoy, could we have a word?” Lily asks before they are out of earshot. Harry could hug his mum. She’s amazing and Harry will do whatever she wants him to all summer if she will be able to give him the possibility to properly say goodbye to Draco.
Quidditch practise was every day during the holidays. Marcus wanted us to be ready for the match on the 23rd. We’d have endless discussions about tactics and Marcus kept drilling into me that I was only allowed to catch the snitch if we were more than 50 points ahead of Gryffindor. They had a lead of 200 points, so we needed more than that to win the cup this year. Draco would hide his laughter against my shoulders every time Marcus brought it up again.
It has been hard. Hermione, Ron and Neville are fun to hang out with, but I missed the times Draco and I would just spend with the two of us, talking about everything and nothing. I missed his lessons in defensive charms and jinxes. He just knew how to get me to use my wand without being afraid of it. But he ignored me all the time, so that wasn’t happening anymore. And on top of that Nott and Crabbe had started with their jinxes and beatings again. It was again not safe for me to be alone in our dormitory, partly because Draco only came in when he was off to bed and he was always already off to breakfast before I even woke up. I didn’t know if he just didn’t know that Nott had started beating me again or if he didn’t care.
The next thing I know is waking up, lying flat on the floor, Draco and Professor Lupin squatted next to me. They wanted to know if I was okay and Professor Lupin made me eat chocolate. I told Draco that it was getting worse, that I could here mom louder this time. Draco said it was okay if I didn’t want to continue, but I told them both that I was fine. Professor Lupin suggested to focus on a stronger memory, so I focused on the time Draco told me for the first time that he loves me.
Draco shakes his head. “He doesn’t like me. Can’t hear, can’t talk, can’t get good grades, can’t even fall for a nice pure-blood girl.”
“Albus, I told you this was insane. Malfoy has nothing to do with Potter. I don’t see why he should risk anything for him,” Professor Snape says. Dumbledore answers something, Draco is sure, but his eyes are fixed on Granger. She refuses to look at Draco. Draco is sure she knows why he would be the person that Potter will miss the most. If only Draco would be able to talk to her for a second. Because it can’t be that he likes Draco, can it? That would be insane.
“Ron and Hermione,” Harry says. He tries to be excited. It’s amazing that they will go to the final. He just needs to remember that he dreamed of this from the moment he knew that the Quidditch World Cup would be in England this year. It’s amazing. And expensive. An amazing gift from his parents. And together with Ron and Hermione, it will be fun. They will stay overnight and have fun. Just as they used to do before Harry fell in love with Draco. It will be great. Even without Draco there. Harry will love it. He has to love it. Somehow. His parents spent a lot of their savings to give this to Harry. He can’t be ungrateful, just because he can’t share it with Draco. That’s not their fault.
There was a platter with milk and cookies beside his chair, and Scorpius happily recounted his train ride with Lucy and Dominique.
Head of House give you a speech when you were first years? And if so, I’d like to know what they said.”
A drinking party in a Weasley household was always a risk, but quite different from letting his guard down in a Wizarding pub. Harry trusted the wards, and the men handing him drinks—more or less. He felt his ears grow after one purple drink but was otherwise fine. None of them were in a joking mood after all.
“Do you still consider this a duty?” Harry asked him abruptly. Even after what had happened, he still needed to hear the words.
“Maybe we can get more people to join. Now that it’s not illegal anymore,” Neville chimed in from behind them.
There was a large group on the platform with predominantly red hair, so they must be the infamous Weasleys. They were loud and boisterous, and Scorpius found himself smiling at their antics. There were several adults, and children in a wide range of ages. He shook his head, thinking how weird it must be to be part of such a big family.
By the time they arrived at Hogsmeade Station, Scorpius was tired of craning his neck at the view outside the window. Dominique’s older sister, Victoire was the prefect to remind them to put on their robes. She was even more beautiful than Dominique if that was possible. Her hair shone like gold and she spoke with quiet authority.
Before Harry could re-examine the invitation, Ron answered for him. “There’s only so many places you can hold a wizarding wedding safely, so it’s either at the Malfoy Manor or Grimmauld Place.”
He picked an empty carriage, stowing the trunk under the seat. Outside the window, teary-eyed families were saying goodbyes to their children. Scorpius observed them curiously.
Father had explained to him that while he was still a minor, he had no claim to the Black family vault without permission of the current head. That meant they could scarce afford all that they needed for school. Kreacher had no qualms about stealing muggle books and other things, but there were limits to what he could get away with.
Once in a while, the headmistress would offer him the position of Defence professor. They didn’t have the same annual turnover that they used to, but most professors still lasted only two to three years on average. Harry usually skimmed that part of the letter, except this last year, when his eyes had lingered on the words.
He stopped himself from craning his neck as he watched the child sit under the hat and be sorted. His features were Malfoy’s through and through, and it was like no time at all had passed since Harry’s own years at Hogwarts. But he could see nothing of the arrogance that Draco Malfoy had exuded when they met. Scorpius’ face reminded Harry of his own uncertainty when he first stepped foot here. He looked lost and wary.
Father was afraid, so Scorpius was afraid. He didn’t understand what he was supposed to be afraid of; he just felt it.
