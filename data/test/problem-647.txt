- That’s not what… -
- One we’re not interested about! – Hermione reply.
There it is. The certain feeling that something will go wrong. I just hope the fifth department didn’t add more drama, I have very little patience with the already present one, thank you very much.
I hear Ron asking to Harry: - What’s happening? –
Blaise is the one who talks less. He just says “mh”, or “yeah”, or just nods. When he actually talks, it’s either to tease or to talk bad of someone he doesn’t like. But he communicates a lot only with his eyes and has the best glares ever! He has so many micro-expressions and I can’t wait to be able to read them as I see Draco already do.
- Hermione told me about the first day, - it’s her answer. – She was so furious… -
- Do you even remember your boyfriend’s face? – Zabini asks. – Just out of curiosity –
- Miss Reckless, - she repeats. – I noticed you weren’t on my lesson –
I probably shouldn’t make him angrier, but I have zero patience for dicks and no filters on my mouth.
- I can’t like him, - he affirms. – He’s… he’s the chosen one, the main enemy of the Dark Lord, he will probably be killed by the end of the war and… – his voice breaks.
I sigh. – It means the team is lost without my genius mind –
- That’s the password? – I ask.
- Hey! – I jump back. – You’re a terrible friend! You dare to hurt me like that! – I pretend to cry.
- I need to talk to you -.
- Welcome, I guess, - he says. – Sit down, before the tea cool down –
- You can’t avoid me, - he affirms. – We’re engaged! –
Please tell me if there errors! Or if you can't understand something! And thank you for reading this ridiculous idea! (Honestly I didn't think someone who would actually like it!)
“System, I should remember this one, right?”
- You promised to help me, - she hisses.
- Nah, trust me, - I smile. – They’ll became a disgusting couple and have three beautiful red head children –
The written Yes and No appears in front of my eyes.
- A solution? We can’t disobey our parents, you know what happens when we don’t listen to them! – this is Draco.
She laugh. – I don’t know if that scares me even more! –
Wait… WHAT?!
- Sometimes I like to look at it when I’m sad, - she says. - It makes me feel free -.
I scratch my nose, thinking. Maybe I could use a simple piece of paper. But how to imprint the right spell? Writing the words of the spell on it? Mh, no, I don’t like this idea: anyone would be able to understand what those pieces of paper are. It’s too obvious.
I jump up. – Thestrals?! Where?! I want to see them! Oh wait… well… that wasn’t exactly what I intended… -
Instinctively I take a step back and raise an arm to protect myself.
- And in your hair, - she adds.
- You’re kidding, - Draco says. I stare back.
- I think I’ll read the books not in the prohibited section for now, - I sigh. She nods and help me to find the better ones, then leaves me at my research.
- They’re both males! – he exclaims. I immediately feel fire in my veins.
Hermione becomes even more red. – Shut up! -. And she runs away down the stairs. Ron stares at her running away, blushing. He hesitates some more moments before following her.
- Don’t worry about him, - I reassure them. – I have a plan! –
- It’s a spell! – Ron shouts back. – It must being activated when the door closed! –
“Why have I a fucking boyfriend?!”
She seems really surprised by the questions. Come on, I can’t be the only student to ever asked her something like that!
She just glance at me. How hurtful! A friend who doesn’t trust me!
I scroll my shoulders. – Superpowers –
- Miles, calm down… -
No. I can’t. I quite. The tea rabbit never told me about a
Now they look at me with wide eyes. And I realize… I don’t see them as book characters anymore. I care about them. I worry for them. I don’t want to lose them. They’re… my friends. The very first I ever had.
I miss Italian schools. Too much to study and the death of nights spent with too much coffee and chocolate studying a couple of books for the tests, sure, but at least we didn’t have any essay to do…
- We need to do it more often, - I says.
- Oh, we are? Sorry, I thought it was an error for my parents to arrange an engagement with an idiot –
- Weasley’s girl, - I wave at her. – Long time no see –
Hermione sighs. – Honestly, it’s so painfully obvious, you really didn’t realize? –
At this point, I put the wand on the ground.
- It’s the most stupid plan I ever heard, - Draco says. – And it will never work –
As the last day of a shitty week, it wasn’t so bad after all!
Ginny raises an eyebrow. No, seriously, why the hell everyone can but me?!
I keep running once out, in case he’s following me outdare too. I arrive to the first floor before dying out of oxygen. I step in an empty class and fall to the ground, heavily breathing.
- Is he really your boyfriend? – it’s the first thing she asks.
- We never succeeded to stop you, - Draco sighs. – Not that one time you made Snape’s hair like a rainbow… Or that time you found a way to change the dormitory password in “bo-bo-booo” … Or that other time when you decided to swim in the lake in November to prove the Durmstrang students weren’t the only ones who could do that –
- Please take her away, - it’s all Draco says.
- Could you stop flirting for just one second? – Zabini rolls his eyes.
Ginny raises an eyebrow. No, seriously, why the hell everyone can but me?!
Oh. I… totally forgot.
It’ll be interesting…
- I don’t see why, - I affirm.
- What the hell are you doing? –
When all the students gets up to go to the lessons, Pansy starts to walk towards the golden trio with large steps and a warrior face.
- Don’t say a word, I won’t annoy any of you if you don’t give me a reason, - I say to whoever is in the carriage. I’m spying my friends from behind the curtain. Draco see me right before the carriage leaves the station and he raise an eyebrow- seriously, why everyone is able to do it?! -. I smile innocently, sighting in relief the more far we get from that annoying brat I have as a boyfriend.
- You checked: he won’t lose any lesson, - I interrupt her. We already discussed this like ten times!
I just met one of the best characters ever, Ron, nothing more. And I’m trying really hard to be her friend because it’s my dream!
- Better? – Pansy asks in a soft voice. Draco just closes his eyes.
This should be simpler. Two people liking each other, starting to know each other, and falling in love. Happy ending!
Is that a challenge? Well, accepted!
- It’s time for us to go! – Pansy gets up from the chair from where she was eating just a moment ago.
- You hate him and you find his beautiful emerald eyes annoying, - I comment.
- Our parents have arranged the marriage, - he finally says. – It’s not in your power to go against it. From now on, you must stop your flirting with others, pay me the attention and respect I deserve and get used to the idea of being my wife and obey me –
- Oh, don’t worry, - I smile innocently. – I know you’ll marry Ron and have three beautiful red head kids! And I mean, he may be not my type, but I can understand why you like him… - I wink.
But the System doesn’t say anything more.
- What are you looking at? -. It’s Luna’s soft voice.
I feel the wide smile on my face. – And I thought you would never ask… -
- I asked you if you understood the theory of the transfiguration of living beings without harming them even if we transform them in non-living objects –
Why am I like this?
- You’re evil, - I comment. – Those kids will have nightmare about you tonight –
Except when I remember that Hogwarts is a school, and students should study for tests. Yep, I tend to forget that part.
- How… how can you see them? – Ginny asks. – Oh, sorry, you don’t need to tell me, of course! – she immediately adds.
- I think you broke her, - I hear Blaise say.
- I don’t know, I’m still working on it! –
- Have I already said this year will suck? –
- We need allies from Harry’s side too, - I affirm. Pansy understands immediately.
- What have I done to deserve an evil friend like you? – I mutter from the floor, eyes still closed.
I blink. – What? Why? –
“I don’t get paid enough for this”
I check if there’s someone in the corridor, but it seems empty. Perfect!
He clenches his jaw. – No –
- Do you think I’m sad? – I ask. I realize only later I’ve been a little rude. I’m going to say sorry, when I see a little bracelet in front of my eyes. I turn to look at Luna. She’s smiling softly, her clear blue eyes looking at me directly. But I don’t feel like she’s trying to study me, it’s more like she’s embracing me gently.
I turn and… Holy crap, I can see them!
“System! The 3D map!”
- I’m in, - it’s my answer.
Next chapter: Drarry plans, more OC/Ginny because I can, possibly a little appearance of Miles-worm, and Aurora's experiments with magic!
And that’s the story of how we’ve been kicked out from the library. I can barely take my notes before a furious Madame Pince close the door behind us.
- Draco? – Blaise snaps his fingers in front of him. – Are you still with us? –
- I… -. And I understand. The best strategy I can use with her.
She grabs my wrist and takes me to an empty class. She closes the door and turns to me. - Now, listen to me! This is an emergency, a situation that goes on since first year and I’m not gonna see this continue for another year! I’ve not intention to suffer anymore! –
- Can I help you? – madame Pince approaches me with a diffident look. She’s probably deciding if I’ll be respectful of her precious books.
Now I’ve got all his attention.
- Exactly! And that means… -
She raise an eyebrow. – You mean, six hours ago? – .
- You should really stop eating that much, - he says throwing the food on my bed. – You’re not like Pansy who remains skinny no matter what she eats… -
I find myself smiling again. Miles is halfway towards me, hands raised as he was, what, thinking of throwing me down the stairs?
I open them: he really is! Draco Malfoy! From the book to my real life!
- We have to go or we’ll be late, - Blaise affirms before I can hit Pansy again.
- Tell me all about the essay, - I whisper at him.
, - I whisper. I can feel the moment the wand’s magic connects with my energy, I can feel the wand guiding it, pulling it out until the wand’s and mine magic work together and the wand lights up.
Should I be studying? Yes. Am I? No. Apparently I can't put my brain on studying because all it thinks about is this story, so here the chapter!
She looks absolutely surprised. – You think? –
- Oh -. Ginny looks at me with her horrified expression. – It’s been good to know you, Malfoy’s girl, - she affirms. – What color do you want your grave? –
- Goodnight, Malfoy’s friend, – she says, a smirk on her face.
For a glorious moment, he shuts the fuck up.
“Was that an insult?!”
I put my hands under the head to find a more comfortable position and try to relax. I’m almost asleep when I hear someone laying next to me.
- We have important things to talk about, so close those stupid books and listen to me –
Mission accomplished. The seal will last for an hour, and Draco and Harry will have the time they need to clarify their feelings! Aren’t we geniuses? (What do you mean, this is the most cliché thing of the story of cliches?? We’re desperate, okay?)
- I know a friend who does, - it’s her answer while we start to go down the stairs. – She always finds some good quiet place –
- Let them, - she says. I sigh and sit next to her. The fire crackles and warm us up and I curl up on the sofa yawning. I see a couple of students studying on another sofa -the first day? Seriously guys? – and some first year watching the lake, fascinated.
Wait. The movements! I can draw the movements of the spells to represent them!
I tilt my head. – Does Weasley girl want to show me something? –
- Have you eaten something for dinner? – she asks.
Fortunately, Draco arrives with the food saving me.
- Is that your problem? – I can’t help but saying. If Pansy’s voice is ice, mine are flames ready to burn everything. I clench my fists, trying to remember why I shouldn’t hit him. No good reasons arrive.
It’s not as good as I wanted to, but it’s simple enough for me to remember it easily. Since my memory -as my friends don’t really like to remind me- sucks, it’s better if I stick to something simple.
- You’re wronging everything, - Pansy says, sighing and putting down the potion’s paper she was writing. – We weren’t making fun of you, we were only trying to help you –
“System, where the hell is the library?”
Wait a minute. She's not a prefect!
- Okay, - I repeat.
- That’s your last chance, Miles –
The system answers immediately.
Oh no. But I didn’t do anything! Why am I in trouble even before I act out some good ideas I have?
- Sure, don’t worry, - I say. – But in this case, you’ll need to cause the distraction… -
She closes the door and makes me sign to stay silent. We hear someone walking in the corridor.
- It’s an illusion, - it’s my answer. – I’m actually Aurora’s ghost came from the death to have her revenge! –
- What do you think to do, kidnap us? At Hogwarts? Fuck off, Slytherins! – this is Ron.
- How can I help you? – I ask, trying to remember what I did to be scolded.
Ok, if you find the english worse than the other chapters, say immediately to me! I just studied chinese grammar for hours and lost half of my neurons, I don't even know in what language I'm thinking right now...
Except that I almost freaked out in front of Hermione and Ron like a stupid weak little kid.
- Miss Reckless, in my office after the lesson, - it’s all the professor says.
I know, it's more a filling chapter, but I hope you enjoyed it anyway! I'm trying my best to make you know Aurora more and more, and also her relantionship with the others!
I don’t think I felt this peaceful from… ever. There’s always a shaking, scared part of me ready to run, to fight, to defend, to use sarcasm and be ready to be hurt. But now it’s gone. Now I feel free and calm.
Until I stop trying to free my mind and just let the thoughts happen. But I don’t pay attention to them. I observe them, as they’re things that don’t concern me. Until they became a little background noise. And then… silence.
- Sure! Understood! No questions! Thanks for teaching us! –
I blink. “What? I could gain points from the beginning and you never told me?!”
- Hermione? -. Ron, Pansy and Blaise arrived. – What happened? –
(See the end of the chapter for
- What plans? – Draco sits in front of me and Zabini come right after.
I start to write down the spells I know between the cat and the bunnies I draw earlier, and then try to think about what symbol to use. It can’t be something casual, I need to remember it easily.
- You slept the whole time! What happened, too many emotions for a day? –
- That’s a very good idea! Thank you! –
- Your parents were there, - he decides to talk. I raise both my eyebrow, since raising one is Mission Impossible for me.
I could go back to the dormitory, but I could also go the library, go to the prohibited section and continue my research! That sounds funnier than sleeping and risking to meet that Miles worm of my boyfriend.
- Our parents decided for the marriage! You can’t treat me this way! – he almost shout.
Eventually, we go back to our dormitories. Eventually, we say goodbye to each other still smiling and walk away. Eventually, Pansy’s jokes on my stupid happy expression. Eventually, I fall asleep feeling light and relaxed.
- Miss Reckless, are you paying attention? – she asks, as she doesn’t know the answer herself.
So… maybe I should invent symbols to represent the different spells. Yes! That could work!
Draco sighs. – You take her to the infirmary, I’m gonna take some food from the banquet and I’ll join you –
- Those were… little accidents of my perfect memory! – I affirm. Draco snort. He must be astonished by my genius excuse.
- I don’t like it, - Hermione confirms.
I almost giggle. Almost. Because there’s no way I start my second life in the world of my dreams killing my dignity!
- You were… not completely wrong yesterday, - it’s Draco the first one to talk. – This is our life, and our parents shouldn’t control it –
Hey! Don’t judge me! I’m just dead and drinking tea with a talking rabbit!
- Good, - it’s her answer. – Wands, right? I think I remember what books you were reading… -
- I’m still hungry, - I get up before he can finish to scold me more. – I’m going to find some more food. See you later! – and I get out before they can stop me.
The three of them look at me as they can’t believe their ears.
Aurora's having a bad week, but hey! Her magic project is doing large steps forwards!
- They’re both in love already, - I say. – Why waste a love filter? –
- Thank you for the help! – I smile.
- What happened? – Pansy asks from above her potion’s homework.
“Liar! You don’t feel sorry!”
- Yes, so? –
- I’m… - he sighs. – I’m sorry for my reaction this morning, I was shocked and acted… not at my best –
So, I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Aurora is a human disaster with no filters and no self-preservation instinct!
- Wake up! – she shouts. – You need to help me in this! I will not suffer another year of annoying pining with sarcastic comments! –
- So, - I look at Draco. – Screw them. If you like Harry Potter, just go and say it to him. Choose to be with him and damn what our parents think. This is your life, not theirs –
- Did you prefer the one of last year? – she replays. – “Emerald eyes annoying beautiful?” –
How hard can it be?
- Of course! – he replays. – Because I hate him! –
- For the love of Merlin’s underwear, this isn’t about the stupid war! – I have only two weeks to make Drarry real, that’s a real matter, not uncle Voldy!
- I thought we already decided I was arrogant, - it’s my sharp answer. – Now, shut up and open your ears, for how hard I know it’s for you: our parents may have decide what the hell they wanted, but I won’t obey them. I am a person of my own will and I will do whatever I want. Either you leave me alone, or you’re on my way -. The smile fades from my face as I stare him with ice in my eyes. – And no one ends well when he’s on my way –
Any further doubts about Pansy’s evilness? Me neither.
I scroll my shoulders. I’m too tired to think about it. Tomorrow the lessons starts! I have to plan how to end the marriage, take care of some character development I always wanted to see and annoy some jerk!
- It’s for his own good, - I reply. – They’re absolutely idiots, can you imagine they figuring out it on their own? –
- Here it is! – I lift it to show her. She sighs -people tend to do it when they have to do with me- and takes it.
- That’s absolutely perfect, - it’s Pansy comment. – I would never think I would say it one day, but you two could be less useless than I thought –
Now it’s just the four of us in the common room.
“System, what are the probabilities he understands his feelings on his own?”
your friends, - Ginny affirms a second before me. Luna blinks a couple of times, then she smiles with such a happiness that I feel my hearth full of it too.
- You have no idea how furious I feel in this moment! – Draco goes on with his monologue. – He was there… Suggesting solutions and insulting me… And I felt so furious… -
Please don’t ask anything else. Please have pity on me. Please please please…
- I already called Professor Snape -.
Draco, wasn’t you the character cold and distant and sarcastic?!
A note for the future me: never take Pansy to the library.
For a moment he’s genuinely surprised, enough to loosen his grip on my arm. I take advantage from this beautiful moment: free again, I walk towards the stairs. Ugh, I need to work on my project in some quieter place to take off the drama of this scene from me. It still have the chills. Ugh, really!
- What? – I ask in a brave attempt to pretend nothing’s happened.
I mean, thank you!
- Draco, - I interrupt him. He immediately looks at me like he wants to kill me. I ignore his obvious homicide instinct. I’m very good at it. – When you feel furious towards Harry, it’s the same kind of furious you feel towards me when I cause too many troubles? Or your parents when they don’t listen to you? –
- What was that? – asks Zabini once we are far enough.
I sigh for my immense suffering, but I know I lost. I can’t win against my love for chocolate!
We look at each other for two good seconds before bursting in laugh.
How lucky I am to have friends who remind me this particular part of the Harry Potter world? If only they would tell me earlier, and not while we’re heading to the class.
- What a good thought! – Ginny finds herself smiling.
Soooooooo we find out some more about shiny Aurora's past! Of course Luna arrives, and we will se her a lot because I have not self control on characters I love...
We stop only after ten minutes of running -and my poor lungs dying -. With my surprise, sitting at the feet of a great oak tree, there’s Luna Lovegood. I immediately find myself forgetting the fatigue.
- Why? You’re so stupid to talk about secret planes to kill Voldemort in front of me? – it’s my answer. They watch me in horror and it takes me about ten seconds to understand why: I called Voldemort by his name. A habit from my world! Damn it, I completely forgot I’m not supposed to say his name so carelessly here!
- It keeps bad energies away from her soul, - Luna explains at Ginny’s confused expression.
I lay down on the grass near Hogwarts gate. The sky is cloudy this morning, and I yawn.
Let me tell you, being hit by a track is painful as hell. And personally, very much embarrassing: me, who is the one who always tell others to pay attention in the streets, stumble on my own feet and fall like a sack of potatoes in the middle of the road. And of course it’s the moment a truck must have the ride of his life in my face. Literally.
- …and I hoped it would ended soon, but it seems to be worse day after day, - Hermione finishes her tale.
- I can’t do this, - I shake my head. – I need a break, or this situation will end with a suicide-homicide –
Any doubts of who is the drama queen next to me? Me neither.
Dying? Ok, could have been worse. Being teleported in another universe from the books I loved as I child? Beautiful! Having the possibility to give your favorite characters the development you always dreamed to see? I can’t wait!
I take a quick look at my belly before deciding I don’t care and starting to eat. Nobody said in the conditions I had to stay skinny!
- You’re two terrible persons, - Zabini says in his usual unexpressive voice.
- I’m working on it, - I reply. – I’ll think of the greatest of the plans, and then you’ll help me, Weasley girl –
-…and how annoying is his voice! – Draco shouts. – And his stupid eyes that always look at me with they’re emerald color! Who gave him the permission to look at me?! And his stupid messed up hair! Why can’t he just fix them?! –
I sigh. The situation is more desperate than I thought. How the hell can I change it in just two weeks? I need more time to make my ship became real!
Before he can really break my wrist, the professor arrives and with her Draco, Pansy and Zabini.
Yes, the System is lowkey inspired by SVSSS -if you don't know it, go read it, it's the funniest thing I ever read!
I sigh. Apparently, I can’t ignore my duties anymore.
- I offer you a body in another world, a world you know very well and never expected to be real. You will gain power and knowledge, but you’ll have to accomplish some missions. And if you’ll feel like leaving a good review, remember everything above three stars will motivate the fourth division to more interesting updates. Do you accept the conditions? –
- How can you think about food when we have more important things to do? – she says, keep dragging me.
- I try! – I defense myself, because it’s true! It’s not my fault if my shitty brain focus only when and about what he wants!
I’m surprised: he actually made a linear and clear speech! He can talk, and not only insult with short lines!
I n0d, feeling a weird proud feeling in my hearth.
- Twice? – this is Blaise.
I mean, I’m not completely stupid, even if I don’t think much about it and I prefer to focus on having fun and planning Drarry, I know there’s a war outdare. My character isn’t a main character, I have absolutely no certainty I will no end like a war casualty. And I’m not exactly a fan of dying young -again.
The System seems really disappointed. That only increases my fear of what plot the planned…
I blink. Why should that worry her? Also, I totally forgot about the GUFO!
It seems impossible that he can become angrier, but I always thought records are done to be overcome!
- Not anymore, - it’s my answer. – And my brain needs sweets to survive the rest of the travel –
“Exactly! That’s the problem! Do you want a good review? Pay me for this mission impossible!”
Ginny giggles and Luna doesn’t even try to hide she’s amused.
- Ehm.. sleepwalking? -
I yawn, wondering if I could just sleep here. I’m finally taking the necessary energies to get up, when I hear someone walking in the common room.
- Harry’s my best friend, and I just want the best for him, and I never thought Draco was… Anyway, if it’ll make Harry happy, I want to help –
He gets up too. – It won’t happen –
Well, a problem for the future Aurora! The present Aurora has very interesting research to do!
I close my eyes.
I roll my eyes. – Believe what the hell do you prefer, Ronald Weasley, it’s not my problem what you choose to think. I had my reasons to get in the first carriage I would find, and it’s not spying three teenagers about war planes –
- Luna! – I can’t help but exclaim, a wide smile on my face. She looks up with the dreamy expression of someone who was completely in her world just a moment ago, and she smiles once she recognize me.
A deep breath. I close my eyes again. I think of the light. A little, tiny sparkle on the fingertip. I let my energy, my magic flowing in me and reaching my hand, my fingers… my fingertip. I open my eyes and I see the tiny sparkle on it.
- I’m sorry to interrupt your profound thoughts, but I tend to find annoying being stared at, a feeling I’m sure you can understand –
Pansy snapes two fingers in front of my eyes.
“Thank you, mister System!”
“Are you kidding?! My ship!! Of course I accept!!!”
I can’t stop smiling. I should, probably, it can be a little disturbing having someone who stares at you with a wide smile.
I sigh and slowly lower my arms. I clear my throat, hoping it will help me to feel less embarrassed. It doesn’t.
- What’s happening here? –
We wait for some minutes, in silence, sharing excited looks. Until I hear light footsteps and deep breaths. Luna smiles at something behind me and Ginny. – They’re here –
"- What are you doing here in the middle of the night? -
I get up and leave the hall, ignoring Draco’s confused calling.
Draco sits to look at us directly. – What
As soon as the carriage stops, I get out of here. I’m starving, I can’t wait for the banquet to start!
- Are you kidding?! – I jumped up. – This is the most beautiful talisman I ever had! I will wear it in a way that everyone can see it! –
I roll my eyes. – Then good suffering –
- Oh, - I fake astonishment. – But I already did, it’s to late now to stop, don’t you think? –
I hope you liked this chapter! I wanted to add some experiments with the "talismans" Aurora intends to create, but I realized it was already 10 word pages, so I just published it instead of making you wait!
- Oh, yes, - I nod. – She really is my type! –
- You just called me garbage?! – he shouts.
- You already know you’re annoying, I don’t need to remind you, - it’s my answer. She bring a hand to her hurt as she’s hurt and fall in her chair.
I sigh and prepare myself to the pain of a serious conversation.
- Have you done the essay? –
- You can’t do this! Our parents have decided! – he screams. I sigh: he really is mature, isn’t he?
- At the cemetery. When he’s back, - he affirms.
- You’re bright in happiness, - she says. – Your aura it’s full of energy. You should use a talisman to protect it from the darkness of others –
Without even realizing what I am doing, I obey, sitting in the other stool in front of him. He gives me a cup full of hot tea.
Let’s see if I can do it…
- Maybe, - I scroll my shoulders.
- She’s probably bullying some first year, - Draco shrugs his shoulders. – I wish she could do it faster: I’m starving –
- Too? – Interesting...
I blink. It takes me some moments to realize there’s no pain.
I don’t… I don’t do boyfriends! I don’t do relationships in general, but a boyfriend involves feeling, and being intimate, and…
I look at him right in the eyes. – Watch me –
- Oh, don’t worry, girls! It’s okay, I’m still here –
Well, that’s stupid! A whole different way to practice magic, and nobody ever thought to find out more?
It took us two days of planning to make this meeting happen, now it’s time to act!
- Aurora? – Draco calls me again, frowning. He calls my name with the English accent, killing all the vocals (and my hearth hurts. The only thing I’ll miss here it’s the Italian accent, I guess).
I grab his wrist with an iron grip. He looks at my face, ready to shout, only to encounter my deadly smile.
Now that the adrenaline of the panic-essay is gone, I find myself yawning. But no. I should really pay attention to the lesson, it will help me with studying later. I take my goose quill, I dip it in the ink and lift my head to watch the professor.
I’m a disaster. I know that, it’s like the only thing I know for sure about me. A freaking human disaster. Only, I hoped changing universe would be… good for that aspect of myself?
Thank you, I pass.
- You’re an angel! – I smile. – Pansy, learn from him! –
- He’s not a problem, - it’s my answer. – Thank you for the saving, even if you were saving yourself mostly… I won’t ask you what are you doing here if you don’t ask me –
- Have you… - I gasp. – Have you seen
- Professor! – I smile.
- Goodnight, Weasley girl, - it’s my replay. We can both play this game, you know?
I smile. – You’re an angel! Remember to take the chicken! And the mashed potato! And the soup! And the cake! The chocolate one! And… -
- You were having fun embarrassing others, - Pansy affirms. – Just how I taught you… - she pretends to wipe away a tear.
Pansy shocks her head. – Nope, I can’t – she gets up. – See you in the dormitory –
Wait a minute. She’s not a prefect! She’s a year younger than me!
I slowly nod. I have no idea how to explain her that I’m already taking it seriously, it’s just my brain who disagree… So I don’t say anything at all.
- Where’s Pansy? Shouldn’t she already come back with the sweets? – asks Blaise.
He stares at me for some more moments -who knows, maybe to raise suspense. He fails, if that’s what he’s trying to do.
Now the three of them stare at me. – We will become death eaters too, Aurora, - Pansy says. – You know that, right? –
Madame Pomfrey doesn’t seem really happy to have four students in the infirmary the very first day. She fix my wrist in a second, but right when I’m asking her if I can go to the banquet, she affirms I have to stay in the infirmary for the night.
Her smile widens. – I thought you would never ask –
“You’re the evil here! Why don’t you help me with studying or the lessons?”
She giggles. – At your orders! –
Wait! Bad temper, stupid face… It’s my boyfriend! That’s why I felt I should remember him!
conversation.
“What punishment?”
- There? – I repeat.
A second later, Madame Pince is next to us. – Silence in the library! –
Before I can answer, she’s walking out of the infirmary.
- Okay… - I obey before she insults me again. – What’s the matter? –
- What? – he comes back to the real world. – Sure, I’m here. What were you talking about? –
Even if I always sucked at meditating -or emptying my mind in any way- now I’m a witch, I’m working to a project and my shitty brain won’t obstacle me. Thank you.
“Not with you talking about my responsibilities!”
I look up from my third muffin with innocent eyes. – Not yet, I still need another one… -
- We’re gonna find help! – Pansy affirms. – You just wait here! –
I nod again. She doesn’t seem really satisfied. – Very well, - she gets up. – You can go, you must have another lesson if I’m not wrong –
- You can check these books, but they’re not really detailed, and I’m afraid there isn’t much in the prohibited section either –
- I go to bed, - I whisper. – Please, just… think about what I said -. I smile, but it’s a tired smile even to me. I leave them at their silence.
- How can you think that of me? – I put a hand on my hearth. – Weasley girl, you’re evil! –
up, she really is short!) – My parents work at the Ministry of Magic, and this morning I heard Harry Potter talking about you-know-who again, and I find it so offensive! To keep sharing fake news just to gain attention! –
I smile again. – Nothing to worry about! It’s a family thing, but I can handle it! –
- Finally! –
Years upon years of dodging my aunt aren’t useless now! I move fast enough to not let him touch me and run to the door while he fall in the sofa because of his own push. It’s the only reason why I can make it out in the corridor before he reaches me: I’m a fast runner, but I really don’t think to be faster than him.
- Absolutely! – I dedicate my best shiny smile. She slowly smile back.
- Do you really believe it? – Blaise is the one who breaks the silence. – Our parents will kill us if we don’t obey -. His voice isn’t even sad, or angry. He seems to have accepted it long time ago.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That is
- NO! – Draco shouts. – Because it can’t be that! I can’t! It’s the worst idea ever! –
The written choose this moment to change:
- I was going to your office right after next lesson! – I immediately say. – I… had some problems… -
- I am now! – I smile. Because of course if I see a hole, I immediately bury myself.
- Harry Potter got himself a punishment, - Blaise answers in the while. Then immediately puts a hand on his mouth, as to erase the words he has just said. It’s useless. The bomb has been dropped.
- You’re the last person who can talk about sparing from suffering! – Pansy affirms. – Aurora, we have to go –
- Sure, - Draco shakes his head. We start to walk again, before we arrive late and get my situation worse.
We wait until they walk away. Only then we realize she’s still holding my wrist. She immediately leaves it smiling in excuse.
- May I interpret that as a “Yes”? – the rabbit asks.
- It’s been beautiful, - Luna says once we arrived at the entrance of the castle. – It was like you were my friends – she smiles.
“System, you’re sure Drarry is possible, right?”
She takes a very deep breath, probably to convince herself not to kill me. – It’s Draco, - she finally says. – And Harry Potter –
- You wanted to talk with me? – I approach her smiling.
- I won’t calm down! She doesn’t respect me! You’re a prefect, cover me while I’m searching her!  –
- Just an innocent answer, - I reply. – Shouldn’t you too? –
- You will give me the respect you have to! – he’s very close to screaming. I tilt my head, asking myself if a broken wrist would worth him finally screaming and losing his face in front of everyone. I mean, it’s not the worst pain I ever felt! I think the worst pain - and it’s a difficult competition! - it’s the truck that killed me. This is nothing!
I sigh, already tired of this drama. I was coming to something! I was being able to do magic without a wand! I was making progresses!
Hermione is the one who interrupts my beautiful moment with Luna.
Draco sits in front of me, next to Zabini.
She shakes her head. – Stop this, you flirtatious little being-
- What a brave look! – I smile. – But I must warn you, the last person looking at me like that… - I lean towards her to whisper at her ear. She tries to lean back. – We ended up doing things I can’t describe to your innocent ears –
- So, - Draco sits more comfortably on the sofa. – Any suggestions how can I make Potter understand I don’t hate him? –
I can happily die now.
“Why I have a bad feeling about it?”
So, that could mean that using wands help us to access and use our magic at our will. The wand is in syntony with our magic… and help us leading it… And the spells express our will and guide the magic…
- That was an embarrassing dead, - he says. – Unfortunately, it was caused by a little mistake the division of the second district has done: you must understand, there was the most important spirit hunt of the season on tv, they got distracted –
- Sit down, miss Reckless –
For some moments, she doesn’t seem to know what to say. Then…
Blaise, who was walking next to Draco, doesn’t even ask. He nods in approval and follows Pansy and Ron out of the corridor, on the stairs.
I jolt. I almost forgot about the System! Not entirely my fault, since it disappeared from yesterday!
- Well, you lost our first lesson of Defense Against Dark Arts, - Pansy informs me. She seems to be of her usual bitchy temper, so I guess the anger attack finished.
She shakes her head. – Does Malfoy’s friend has plans about the lunch break? – she asks. She seems to be holding back herself from doing something.
This… is the most stupid thing I ever heard. What is it, medieval age?! Who the hell came up with this stupid idea?! It’s a stupid plot device for drama! And I never asked for drama, thank you so much!
- Remember what I told you in the infirmary, - she says. – You can always come to me if there’s something bothering you –
A couple of emerald green eyes half hidden behind glasses are staring me. I stare back.
A better friend would run to say to him to fuck off and don’t be annoying. A better friend would worry about Draco, Pansy and Zabini and their ability to deal with other annoying Slytherins.
But this. This…
- You can’t go against our parents will! – he exclaims.
I snort. “Before leaving any review, I want to know what plot they decided”
- No, - I stand up. – You think we don’t have a choice just because we’re their sons, because our family always told us that would be our future, but we
Thanks again for actually reading this story! And for the kudos! Comments are always appreciated!
- How’s going your sleepwalking? – Ginny says, a smirk on her face. – I heard it’s a very serious problem! -
He shakes his head and decide to not replicate. He must be shocked by my genius mind.
What an unrespectful System!
I take the bracelet. It’s composed of a lot of thin wires of various fades of blue and purple. A warm feeling embrace me.
- No –
Only when I’m sure I will keep feeling it, I open my eyes, put my hand into the uniform and take my wand.
Luna takes some raw meat from her bag. – They’re going to come in a moment, - she says. – I will tell you when they’re here –
- Have you woken up now? –
– and again, I laugh.
- Have you done the essay, miss Reckless? I’m taking them, - it’s her answer.
That’s a euphemism, but he’s trying, so I let him talk.
I snap back. – What the fuck? – is the first thing I say. Those brown eyes belong to a fascinating dark skin face with an annoying smirk and even more annoying dark messy hair. Yep, the kind of “fascinating messy”, of course.
- I do! – he almost exclaims, before realizing we’re at the library and he doesn’t want to get killed by Madame Pince. He walks until he can sit next to me.
A blonde head, two grey eyes and a pale skin.
- Why? – Draco shouts back aggressively. – After you made fun at me you want to scold me for being furious?! –
- That’s blackmail, - she says.
- Just go! – it’s Ron answer. – I need to talk to her! –
Draco seems to be very tented to hit me again. I wouldn’t stop him.
- Draco, - Blaise closes the book he was reading. – Please, tell me you don’t actually believe what you just said –
I roll my eyes and start walking to the library. I want to finish this research as soon as possible, so I can find another way to do magic without wands. When I’ll be able to do that, I’ll have an alibi to all the times I’ll cause troubles with magic! I can imagine people pointing at me with accuse, and me showing that I wasn’t even holding the wand! How can I be responsible of some magic?
- What if I just run away and your serious conversation is postponed to tomorrow? – I suggest.
- Do you expect us to believe you? – this is Ron.
I blink again. What’s all this concern about me getting hurt? I’m fine!
But no. Of course not. That would be too easy, right, fifth department? I swear they’re having fun killing all my plans for Drarry.
I blink: the whole class is looking at me. Especially Professor McGonagall.
How the hell should I handle this?!
- What? But I’m hungry, I haven’t even… -
- You really… -
I sit next to Ginny, in front of Luna. – You know each other? – Ginny asks.
When we arrive at Hogwarts, I succeeded to avoid my boyfriend the whole travel. I could have traumatized some poor first year when I entered their wagon like a storm, ordered them to stay silent and closed the door.
A little preview of next chapter!
- What’s the matter? – she repeats. – The matter is, that I’m surrounded by IDIOTS! –
- Stop pretending you don’t know what I’m talking about! – she shouts.
Damn it! Who should I ask for permission? My plan was to keep my research private! And I don’t know any professor so well to trust them asking the permission without further questions…
- Goodbye, life, - I dramatically say, running to the stairs. – Goodbye, Weasley girl! –
- I’m afraid there aren’t many books about it, - she explain, guiding me into the corridors of the library. – Oriental and Occidental magic paths are always been very different and we haven’t close contact to the oriental magic school from centuries –
Blaise is already next to Draco. – Breath, Draco, - he whispers. – It’s okay, just breath –
- Draco needs to talk to you! – it’s her answer. Before Harry seriously hits her, she throws him to Draco, who, completely surprised, end up falling at the ground, Harry over him. Blaise doesn’t even try to help him, too busy laughing at their crimson red faces.
- Maybe? –
- And his voice! And his hair! And the way he wears the uniform! How can he be messy even with a stupid uniform? –
“Oops, sorry”
- I’m not gonna tell
I sigh and give up, starting to draw little bunnies flying upon a cat -very similar to Professor McGonagall-.
- She’s not kidding, - this is Blaise. – Congratulation, Aurora, you just created a new record of your bad memory –
are you talking about? –
Ouch. An essay. Something that must be wrote with order and discipline and the ability to explain things clearly. It’ll be hard…
The rabbit stares at me for some moments, then he sighs.
The Umbridge nods, her best compassionate expression on her face. – I understand, my dear. For this time you’re excused. But next time, feel free to came to me for a nice cup of tea, I’m sure you would feel better after a sweet talk –
- What the hell are you doing, Miles?! – this is Draco. – Leave her alone!  -
- Don’t worry, don’t worry, I’ll do it alone so you won’t be accused to disobey, - I reassure him.
She’s so mature that she answers hitting me.
But they ignore my desperate look. Blaise gets up with a smile and Pansy winks at me before they leave. I dedicate them my best “you’re gonna pay for this” glare, but they don’t seem afraid. I must exercise at the mirror to became scarier!
- But… -
- I’m really sorry, but you’re not my type, - I scroll my shoulders.
Silence. What a coward…
The energy, flowing in my veins. It’s always been there, but I didn’t realize I was feeling it until I could pay attention to it. Until I could shut up the outside world and focus on the inner one.
When we go back to the dormitory, we have a plan for tomorrow morning, right before the lessons.
- Calm down, - I hear Pansy saying. – It’s not like we don’t know why you’re with him –
The next morning I finally have the permission to get out of the infirmary. I immediately go to the Great Hall to have a breakfast -and damn! Those muffins are… wow! And the toasts!!
From their faces, that wasn’t exactly the answer they were expecting. It seems like I will keep surprise people this year! I can’t say I’m sorry!
Magic without wands. Spells to be conserved. Both are incredibly useful! The first one is something nobody expect: an
- See you later! – Draco waves.
I almost chock in the chocolate. –
- We will find shoes for you, - I affirm. Luna dedicates us the softest smile I ever seen. – Are you here to see the Thestrals too? –
"Nope, she's homeless." I said, I could tell by the fact she was on the streets and hadn't showered in days. Now we just wait…
"Where are we Harry?" He asked, amazed with the view.
"What do you want Sirius?" I asked, still staring into Draco's beautiful grey eyes.
"Come on in." I said, leaving the door open for Sirius to walk in himself, no one was up here and there were no cameras to film him turning back into a man. I heard the door close and smiled, I was right in thinking the dog was Sirius.
"You're not wrong. While you were gone the Dark Lord killed both of my parents and my father had made him his heir so I don't have any money. I've been trying to find work, but it's not going very well."
"You were amazing you know?" Draco asked, making me blush slightly.
"Partially, but weed calms my nerves and helps with the nightmares I have, it relaxes me too. It's a lot of work to do two jobs and try not to be caught and hauled on back to jail." Taking another hit I could start to feel myself relaxing a bit.
"Wow, I didn't think anyone under the age of thirty could cook like that." Clint said after he was to full to eat another bite. I of course was still eating as if I had never seen food in my entire life.
"Come over to the couch Harley." He said and I smiled I loved it when he called my name. I got up and walked over, sitting down next to Draco, I could tell he was nervous about something and I hoped it was something good.
"What are we doing in life?" Will asked, leaning on the back wall near the door we just exited.
"Hey! You have to admit I don't look like it, I'm a silver fox without the grey hair." Sirius said with a flourish making us both laugh harder.
"Well, if you cared to check the time, I thought I remind you because you seemed pretty… preoccupied with blondey over here. You have to be at work in thirty minutes." My eyes snapped open and I jumped into action, not even eating breakfast and running out the door in record time, not even remembering the pain all over my face.
Main Street, London
"No, I like your butt."
"Your children are hurting my boobs." I said, massaging them, which felt amazing.
About a week after finding out that we were having twins Draco walked in on me scratching the hell out of my boobs.
"Okay." Was all Loki said and I got to work. I decided to make a lot of things, due to my current state I wanted everything. So, I made beef stew, apple pie, pumpkin pie, fresh bread, and tacos because why not?
"Well, you always feel the need to give above and beyond, but please, there are some things that you really don't need to excel at. You only need one child." Loki said with a laugh.
"Look at you, walking around like you own the place!" Said a very familiar voice from behind them. They all turned around to see Draco Malfoy, all by himself in dirty black robes. "You really think you're all that, but to me you'll always be Weasels and blood traitors!" He yelled, making a scene.
"What? Have I got something in my teeth?" I said jokingly, but he didn't laugh, his expression going from surprised to a soft happiness.
"That is not what I'm training you for! To use your magic to slowly kill yourself with these mortal drinks!" Loki yelled, making my head feel like it was going to explode.
"Well, I mean if I'm already pregnant, that means we don't have to be...careful." I whispered in his ear, giving it a little bite. I wrapped my legs around him and he lifted me up, bringing me into the bedroom and setting me down on the bed. I started to grind on him while we were kissing and he slowly took off each others clothes until we were wearing nothing except our shoes. It was some of the best sex I've ever had.
What the hell? This was extremely creepy, but my curiosity got the best of me and I opened the envelope, breaking the wax seal in the process. I read it, my eyes getting wider and wider as I looked at the words on the… parchment? Who were these people sending me a letter via owl on dried animal skin!? Just for bants, I grabbed some of the little paper I had and wrote my reply down, accepting the invitation to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I strapped it onto the owl's leg and put it outside where it flew off almost immediately afterwards. Why not? I thought, I might as well do it, it's not like I have anything else to live for.
"Harry!" I turned around to see my slightly eccentric godfather running up to me before I was hit with the manchild.
"I know, it's my favorite."
"Are you all done?" He asked.
"Where have you been girl?!" My uncle yelled as soon as I walked in. I didn't blame him for yelling, it was ten at night and I just now got back.
"This is where you've been for the past year? New York City? While the entire wizarding world crumbled? We all thought you were dead!" My furrowed in confusion, it sounded like he cared about that last part.
"We're going to the very top." I said in forewarning, this was a lot of exercise for a dog, even if he was practically human most of the time. My apartment was small with a huge window in the living room and no bedroom, just a living room, kitchen, and a bathroom. My bed was on top of a raised wooden platform only about ten feet from the high ceilings. Underneath my bed I had a white shag rug and a small table I had built. The only way get up to my bed was to climb up some beams which I thought was pretty cool, I also kept my dresser in the space underneath the platform so it was handy. I had another rug underneath my couch that looked out of the large window and was flanked by two of the wooden stands with a lamp sitting on the left stand. In the corner I also had a hammock that looked out onto the street four floors below. I could see the London skyline from almost anywhere in my apartment and I liked it. The kitchen was modern with marble counter tops, and I was surprised I could afford this place. Overall it was a small, tasteful bachelor pad that I was completely in love with. I even put in two tall bookshelves next to the door that I was in the process of filling up with thrift store books I'd like to read.
To say I was surprised when it actually was real, when there was a place called the Leaky Cauldron the harbored witches and wizards, would be an extreme understatement. I was knocked on my ass with shock, but I still went to bank and got money from my accounts and got everything I'd need for the magic school.
"So, why do you have a teenage girl in your room?" Tony asked and I sighed, knowing they were never going to let this go.
"I need to go clothes shopping again." I said, buying clothes every few weeks was annoying when your sole reason for it was not being able to fit into anything anymore. After dinner Draco started to clean up when there was a knock on the door, it was Loki! I fell into his arms and hugged him until he said he couldn't breath, when I let go, there were tears in my eyes."
"Sirius, where's Harry?" Fred asked, looking around, the edge of my lip twitch up when he passed right over me.
I took another hit, practically feeling my lungs die, but not really caring, I would rather die than have to live another second in this twisted world. Everyone I loved was either dead or against me, all except for Hermione, but I could tell that her love for Ron was pulling her to him. I didn't mind, she was more than I could've hopped for and I didn't expect for her to stay. I could tell the end was coming, we had destroyed most of the horcruxes so far, all except Ningini, and I feel like everything will break when I go back to Hogwarts in about a month. Everyone hated me, they think I'm in league with the Dark Lord and my fame is wearing off, but I don't mind, I don't need them anyway. Or at least that's what I tell myself. I stomp out the cigarette on the ground and start walking back to the Dursleys place, regretting every step. Couldn't I just leave? They don't even need me for the war! It was Dumbledore who told them this and he died a year ago. I shook my head and kept walking, until I reached the very doorstep I was left on almost sixteen years before.
"I-I'm pregnant." I said, never looking up from my bed, I couldn't bare to see the disappointment in his eyes.
"You know what we should do?" I asked a bit later as we watched the sun set in wonder.
"Sirius, do you know what happened to Hedwig?" I asked casually, looking at his face to see if he did. His mouth went from a relaxed smile to a frown and I could tell it wasn't good.
"Well, you haven't seen me in seven years, I was bound to grow up sometime." I laughed a bit, walking around them and into the living room. "You guys can put your presents under the tree." I said, gesturing to the good sized tree we had set up a day or so ago. Draco was lying in the hammock, rocking back and forth as he stared at the ceiling, he really liked doing that.
"Do you know that you have yellow… paint on your cheek, right?" She asked as I handed her her straight black coffee. Sure enough, I felt at my face and there was the odd texture of dried paint right where she had said.
"She looks different." One of the men said, trying to get a closer look.
I stormed out of the bathroom as much as my swollen feet would let me, throwing a book on my nightstand across the room at the wall. I was currently in the middle of my second trimester, but I looked like I was full term! I fell back on the bed and groaned, the bed felt so good on my back, but I could stop the thought that I had gained almost nine pounds in six weeks, that's more than a pound a week, I could barely even fit into my jeans anymore and they're made of elastic! Draco didn't even bother looking up from his book, knowing just what I was thinking about. I crawled over to him, lying down curled up to his side and nuzzling his shoulder, trying to hide my face. I don't think I could take much more of this pregnancy.
"I'm sorry Harley, you are an adult now and I have no right to dictate your life or your choices." Loki said, staring at the mat in front of us.
"I was just wondering, if you had a home?" I asked, holding my breath and watching the emotions cross his face.
"Oh, my dear, dear godfather. Draco and I met in Diagon Alley when I went for owl supplies and I brought him back here and we became best friends!" I walked over to Draco and draped myself over his shoulders, leaning heavily into him. " Isn't it great!" We both laughed together and Sirius set the bag on the bar.
"Are you still wearing the condom from last night?" I asked, he lifted up the sheets, checking.
"That was great." He said, making me chuckle. "Please, be in that mood more often." Draco said in a pleading voice. I loved it when he begged me for something. The only thing was that afterwards I was extremely tired.
"So were you." I said, feeling obligated to say it back, but there was nothing fake in my statement. I dreaded going back to Stark Tower, then I realised I really didn't have to, I could stay at the apartment with Draco. We spent the rest of the day with each other inside, it was magical. To end the night we opened a bottle of scotch and drank a bit, but before I had gone into the wizarding district and bought some hangover cures for the next day. We fell asleep in each other's arms in perfect happiness with the lights of Manhattan just adding to the feeling.
About a week later Draco insisted that I stay with him for the night and so I texted Loki and locked up shop. Draco had been upstair for at least thirty minutes while I cleaned up and so I was wondering what he could've done in that time. When I got upstairs I was shocked to see a little candlelight dinner on the terrace. When I walked out there, I saw there was wine in the glasses and a joint in the middle. We were having some kind of chicken that was amazing and we shared the blunt together, getting both drunk and high. We cleaned up using magic and hopped in bed, but we didn't sleep much.
"Maybe in a bit, you look so different." He said, still holding his present.
"Draco, stop." I said.
"Well, I don't mind." Draco said, not looking up from my chest.
"We should order some chinese food!" I said and suddenly there was silence, Both Draco and Sirius were looking at me as if I wa God, both of their mouths watering.
"I met someone." I said, sitting down across from Loki on the couch.
"I love you Harry, but not yet." He said, slithering out from underneath me.
"Now, don't take a fast breath, take it slow and deep so you don't burn your throat to much." He nodded his head and lit the pipe, I watched him breath in and then start coughing like crazy, puffs of smoke coming out with each gust of breath. I got him a drink and soon enough he was back at it until the weed was all gone.
"Is that why you're doing drugs?" He asked, still looking around.
"Real contractions," I panted, "in labor." Was all I could really get out, but it surely shocked Draco awake. He nearly jumped a foot in the air, grabbing things for the hospital and trying to become at least slightly presentable. He helped me up and nearly knocked Loki's door down in panic trying to wake him up. We were at the hospital in only five minutes and I was in a room ten minutes later, pacing trying to distract myself from the pain in vein.
"Wow I thought that only happened in shows." He said to himself which only made me cry harder. The jeans were so tight that not only did the button pop off, but the seems on the side burst as well. "Merlin, how could you breath?" Draco asked and took the pants off me, I was getting nowhere. Draco then picked me up and laid me down on the bed face down and started playing with my butt.
"It was because I know you would never kill Ginny Weasley, because I've been falsely accused of things I didn't do and people have turned on me like a flip of a switch. People naturally hate me because of my father or want to be close to me because of my money and power. All of that is gone now and I have nobody. I know how it feels and it hurts. Sorry, I'm being a huge girl, but it's true and it's sad that I had to lose everything before I realised it. The whole reason I hated you was because you denied my friendship one time, that's a horrible reason and I regretted it. You had such great friends, but it turned out they were using you to. It's heartbreaking to see what people would do for something they desire." I was speechless, I had never heard Malfoy talk like this, especially to me. Looking at him, he was different. His hair was wild and untamed, and his face sharper, his icy blue eyes older with wisdom and filled with pain.
"You know I wouldn't have denied you if you hadn't been such a prat to Weasley, he was my very first friend and I wanted to keep it that way. I was blinded by my neediness and never saw him or Hermione for who they were. Can we just start over, we're both very different people now and I think that would only be appropriate for the situation." He smiled and so did I, I don't know if it was just the buzz, but for once in my life, I didn't feel any hate or contempt for the man now sitting on my couch.
"Be quiet." I said, filling out paperwork. We were called in about twenty minutes later and I was laid down on a table as we waited for a nurse to come in. When she finally got there she turned on this giant machine and lifted up my shirt, putting a cold blue gel on my skin and getting a little stick and spreading over the surface area. 'Well, miss Potter," the nurse said pointing to the little screen, "it looks like you're having twins." I was shocked completely and dreaded when they were to be born. I looked over at Draco and watched him sway, like a tall pine in a raging storm.
"Still, you don't have to carry the child." I said as I walked past the counter I picked up a glass and threw it at the wall, but before I could get the slight satisfaction of it breaking it stopped and went back to the counter. "Don't do that!" I said throwing a plate at the wall instead, which thankfully met its mark. Midway between rounds I stopped and burst into tears, falling to the ground in the fetal position.
"How did you manage to get those on so quickly?" Draco asked.
"If you pass out Draco, I swear to god." I threatened, watching as Draco tried to compose himself, succeeding after a few seconds. I looked back at the screen, seeing it now. Two arms and legs each .
"The apartment above my bakery." I said with my head bowed.
"I know, but I do! They hurt so bad and I like being a B cup, it's nice comes with almost no pain." I walked over and sat back down on the bed and massaging my chest for some sort of relief. I walked into the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror. My stomach was now fully rounded and was more than twice the size it had been to start with.
"Better make sure you don't burn anything." I said, putting out my cigarette in a nearby ashtray. His cheeks lit up with embarrassment and he turned around to face the stove once more. I walked up behind him, wrapping my arms around him, slithering my hand down his pants, slowly making him shudder.
"Hey, watch what you say to me young man!" Sirius shouted, making us both laugh uncontrollably, it truly was a merry evening so far. I was in the middle of mixing an old fashion when there was a knock at the door. They were here.
"I don't know, but let's say from this day forward, we're friends. I'll call you Draco and you can call me Harley or whatever nickname you chose, that I approve of." I said.
"Draco Malfoy, homeless." I said with a laugh, getting up and grabbing an old fashioned pipe I got at a smoke shop a few weeks ago. "How… ironic really. The sad thing is, I know exactly how you feel." I grabbed a little box I kept in one of the drawers by the couch and filled my pipe up with some nice weed.
"When I was little I was abused and used as a slave by my only living relatives until I was seven, that's when I had finally had enough and ran away. I had no money, but I was an extremely talented painter, so I went to London in hopes of selling my work and being famous. That however, didn't work out, no one wanted my paintings and I was living off of the money I had gotten from the ones who did. It wasn't working out, but then I started getting sharpies and discarded cardboard, i started drawing on that and selling it to the hipsters of downtown who are into that stuff. They loved it and suddenly I was off the streets and I rented a small closet to live in. That's when I got my Hogwarts letter, but I feel like I would've been better if I would've just ignored the letter. Azkaban messes people up." I said, I could see Malfoy looking around at the paintings on the walls in masked amazement.
"This is so good." Sirius said in between bites.
"What, would you like some?" I asked, holding out the pipe and lighter. They seemed to think about it for a second before grabbing it and taking a perfect hit.
"God! It's like I'm thirteen all over again." I said, fighting even harder.
"Draco." I said between contractions. I was trying to shaking him awake when one struck that was one of the most painful yet and Draco woke up pretty quickly when I nearly took off a chunk of his shoulder.
"Yeah, I guess so." He was smiling still, looking at me in an almost shocked state.
"Yes! I've been looking for the past twenty minutes." I said.
One day I was working a shift at my coffee shop, Kaffeine and I decided to take a break. It had been almost two weeks after my first cigarette with Will and I've many ever since, to the point of practically chain smoking. I knew it was extremely unhealthy, even without schooling, but I couldn't stop, I was addicted. I don't know why, but instead of smoking out back I decided to sit in the alley that faced the extremely busy street. I noticed a dog lying in the garbage, either asleep or dead, but I didn't really care, wasn't my dog anyway.
"No! I'm not! Because I counted on you having a condom, but I can't seem to find it. Let's just hope I'm not pregnant because it looks like you didn't use one last night." I said, falling onto the bed. I started to cry into the pillow, I didn't want to be pregnant! God, Loki will be so disappointed in me! I could feel Draco move next to me as he lifted me up, holding me in his arms. Suddenly however, I was no longer sad, but pissed. I shoved away from him and walked out into the living room, leaving Draco very confused. Once in the main room I grabbed a glass and threw it at the wall as hard as I could, the glass shattering into pieces. Draco then came out of the room and took the glass that was currently in my hand away before I could throw it and repaired the last one.
Today is my first ultrasound at the hospital, Draco and I were getting ready and thankfully, nothing had happened with my clothes being too small for me, I took a shower and made breakfast, which I ate completely without vomiting, so that's a plus. Then we left, taking a taxi to the hospital.
"You can't just leave and stay away for two whole days without telling anyone. This isn't some kind of place where you can just run around like a child. I thought you were better than this, but I guess not. I will be expecting you in the morning for training." With that he got up and left, leaving with a thick layer of guilt over my heart. I know he was hurt by the things I said and that he cares about me. It was wrong just to up and leave without a word, but I just couldn't stand the thought of someone trying to control me and train me all over again, I just want to be free. I walked up to my room and took a shower, but all I could do was cry, he cared about me and I just threw it away. That night all I could do was lie in bed and think about all the times he had helped me, he saved me from a life of being a slave to a world I was forced into and I just threw it right back into his face. I was a truly evil person.
"Don't lie to me." Loki said, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.
Ginny was dead and it was all my fault, or at least, that's what everyone thought. Ginny was murdered by a death eater, but I was framed and now everyone hated me. I thought that Hermione, Ron, Percy, and Mrs. and Mr. Weasley had been like family to me, but they were testifying against me. They were saying that I had always been dark and crazy, saying that it was only a matter of time. Dumbledore was suppose to represent me, but he was on the Weasley's side, everyone believed I had killed my friend and that I was insane.
"Well I could fix that…" He said, reaching out a hand, but I just took my nipple and squirted breast milk at him. He recoiled quickly, taking his hand back. "You can shoot that stuff?"
"Hello, I would like a room." I said to the receptionist, my voice hoarse from years of disuse. She looked up, but, to my surprise, her expression was not one of disgust.
"This is my apartment." He raised his eyebrows a bit in disbelief. "What's that look for?" I asked.
"Harley! We don't even know if you're pregnant or not calm down!" Draco yelled, holding my wrists in his hands. I then collapsed into his arms and started crying again, god, I was a mess.
"Okay, apparate to this location about twenty minutes, okay?" I handed him a piece of paper I had written my address on just in case. "Okay. I'll see you there." And with that, I was gone, leaving him behind confused.
1st Apartment
"I've gained four pounds." I said with so much sadness, you would've thought someone close to me had died. I had always been skinny and this gain was just an overall shock to me.
"Could they come over to my flat for Christmas? I could have a tree and everything, I think it would be fun." Sirius's face lit up once more making me chuckle slightly.
"Sure, why not?" Will handed me one along with his lighter and I did just as he had, placing the drug between my lips and inhaling. After my first hit I started coughing, but I tried again and again until the smoke went down as smooth as the scotch in my hand. Will was right, it really was a good stress release.
"Calm down Harley, don't hurt me." He said, but him calling me by my name just turned me on even more. I used magic to take off our pants, one of the many perks, and felt his hard one between my legs. I moved down to giving him a hickey on his neck and nibbling on his ear making him moan. I settled down on his dick and started to bounce slowly, massaging my boobs in the process. I was mid bounce when Draco flipped me over and got on top right before I climaxed my nails leaving marks on his back. This went on for a bit before Draco came and we stopped.
"I don't know, I wasn't paying attention." I said, feeling like the teenager I really was.
"Would you like a drink Sirius?" I asked, going over to my makeshift bar.
"I'm fat." I cried, I felt stupid saying it out loud, but it was the only thing going through my mind at the moment.
"Did you go and weigh yourself?" Draco asked and I nodded, crying a bit harder at the thought of it.
"Fine, give me my jeans back before you break them." Draco said and I know he didn't mean to say it, but it still upset me. I took them off and threw them at him when he was bending down to pick something off the floor.
"Harry, it's going to be okay." Draco said one night after dinner.
The dog suddenly got up, apparently not dead, and started hobbling over to me with his tail wagging like a crazy man. Looking closer, I'd seen this dog, and suddenly it hit me. Sirius! My heart soared, I missed him so much during my time in Azkaban, if anyone believed me, it'd be him. He was sitting right next to me, his dark blue eyes staring right into my shockingly green ones full of joy.
"Didn't you have work earlier?" I laughed a bit, only one job, funny joke.
"Yes!" I got up, and picked up one of my bras that were just sitting on the floor and put it on the last hook, which was still cutting into my skin. "Look at this, this is outrageous!" I said, pointing at the fact that my nipple was now poking out over the top of my bra.
"No, I'm not. I never was. That's why I'm here, I'm hiding." I was shocked, but I still pulled a joint out of my pocket and held it out to him.
"Well, I don't think the Avengers really want a little baby running around. I have enough money to afford one along with it, so I don't see why not." I said, it seemed like a necessity, I would miss everybody, but I didn't want to stretch Tony's kindness.
"Because I can't find it. Are you sure you used one last night?" I asked, suddenly getting very nervous.
"Shut it Malfoy! You're only mad because we now have money and you don't, you're nothing but a homeless orphan and you know it!" Hermione said in a pompous voice.
"Come, I have some people for you to meet, Harley." He said, turning and walking out without another word. I followed him, walking through the halls in wonder. We finally came out into a living room with six other people in it, all of them looking straight at me.
Today I knew I had to go back to Stark Towers, I needed new clothes and I didn't want to go out and by some more. I closed the bakery and said goodnight to Draco, taking the dreadful walk back up to the tower. When I got there Loki was sitting on the couch, waiting for me. I really didn't want to talk to him, but I knew I had to. I walked over and sat down across from him on the couch, not looking him in the eyes.
"Harry James Potter, murderer and druggy. That would a nice headline." Fred said, making us all laugh.
"What's that?" He asked, looking at me as if I was insane.
"Not in the muggle world, I work at two different places to afford this place and I love it." Malfoy sat down on the couch, but I walked over to the hammock and sat down in there instead, I always loved reading in it.
It was June 19th and I was a week overdue which just put everyone on edge along with me, but I had to focus more on the complete body aches and false contractions that felt like someone was ripping out my insides. I was extremely temperamental these days and so the guys stayed far away when they could, but they still had to help me do things, seeing as my stomach was bigger than just about the rest of my body. One night I was trying to sleep, but couldn't because of my back pain when I started feeling the false contractions, or at least that's what I thought they were. The only thing was, they didn't stop after a bit, but just kept coming, the pain increasing for longer.
The next day I put on a cloak, hood up, and went into Diagon Alley under a disguise. It was only a twenty four minute bike ride, but I just wanted it over with quickly, in and out. The less time I spent there the less likely people would recognize me even with my changes in appearance. I changed some muggle money into galleons and went to the pet store, only the best for Hedwig, it would be part of her Christmas present from me. I got food, treats, a cage (I didn't plan to use it much thought) and a nice, dark wood perch that I would place right next to the window for her. As I was exiting the shop I saw the people I really wanted to avoid, the Weasleys and Hermione. They were all decked out in the most expensive cloaks, walking around like they owned the place, it really was painful to watch, They were acting just like the Malfoys, expecting the crowds to part for them and most of them did, just to stare.
"Yes, sir." Was all it said and it had me in a state of shock.
"Every single one, Azkaban really inspired me and gave me the hard emotion I was missing in my work." Malfoy was still looking at that one painting, examining every little detail of it as if trying to memorize it. "So, tell me, why did you stick up for me back in the alley?" Malfoy then looked back at me with sincerity in his eyes, something I didn't know he capable of expressing.
"Okay, but these were made for men who don't have a butt, they will not fit me." I said throwing them back at him.
"Harry! I was thinking you weren't going to show up." Will said, taking the left side of the bar.
"Wow George, you're a natural." I said jokingly. We chatted for the rest of the evening, some of us getting high, some of us getting drunk, but I did impresses the redheads of the group with my bartender tricks. It was nice to have my friends back again, I like my new ones, but the Weasleys knew who I was really was and Draco was just amazing… if you know what I mean.
"Well, looks who's talking! You just turned forty one! If anyones practically in the grave, it's you."
"You know that doesn't last forever…" Draco said, looking me up and down.
"Yup, they've me too much pain." I said lying back down on the bed.
"This is your fault!" I said, slapping him in the face, I was pissed.
"He's over at the bar." Sirius said, pointing right at me as I took a sip of my old fashioned. I didn't really like the way all four of them stared, but I couldn't blame, I looked extremely different then the papers told everyone.
"Well, silver fox, I was about to order some chinese food if you'd like some." Sirius's face went from joyful to a childish glee I had only seen a couple times before. "I'll take that as a yes." I grabbed my phone and ordered some food for the both of us from the best chinese place in downtown and we both waited slightly impatient. They got here and we both sat down on the couch, looking out on the London skyline, eating in silence for a bit.
"That's a great idea Harry, we could get presents and everything!" Sirius then started rambling about everything we needed and I finished my food before checking my watch.
"Shut up." I whispered trying not to die, I didn't want to hear anyone except for the doctor until my babies are delivered. Loki chuckled which just pissed me off even more and I sent him the deadliest glare I could come up with that seemed to scare him shitless.
"What's going on here?" Sirius asked, extremely confused with our sudden friendship.
"No, I'm going to have twins, you're going to stand next to me while I'm having the twins. You can just be quiet because you don't have to carry and deliver these children." I said in a deadly quiet voice. Draco had actual fear in his eyes, but my mood quickly change from fury to excitement when the nurse walked in with a picture in her hand. I took the pictures and looked at them the whole way home, placing them on my nightstand when we got back to the house.
"I've decided that I'm closing the bakery because I won't really be able to manage it. Do you want to move in with me?" I asked, this was a huge step, but we were having a baby together, so I didn't think it would really matter.
"Agreed." Loki said. "Mortal food is almost always so delicious." I was happy that I could serve them in some way.
To my surprise, I still looked pregnant after getting back from the hospital. I had gained 33 pounds with the twins, but without them it was still twenty five pounds and my belly sagged. Another things that had changed was that my hips were wider and my cup size had gone from 34B to 36DD which will be fun, not really, it just sounds like a whole lot of back pain. I wanted to start training almost as soon as I recovered, but Loki wouldn't budge for another two months, but I would still sneak off to the gym every morning. I didn't like being fat, when I was a child I was dangerously underweight and so I never had a belly, luckily for me I'm not very good at gaining weight and keeping it on so I shed twenty of the twenty five pounds by the time Loki was willing to train me again, and thanks to some magic cream, my skin didn't sag or have stretch marks. The baby monitor next to our bed started crying, on of the only ways I would know if the babies were crying because I put up wards so it wouldn't wake Loki up at night. I got up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes as I walked over to the twin's room. About a week ago they both turned six months old and now had distinguishable traits… kind of. They didn't look like the generic baby anymore, but I could still only barely tell them apart. I don't why other people want to dress their twins the same, but for the sake of being able to glance at them and tell them apart, we do not do that. When I walked in, both of them were crying which was nearly deafening, they are two loud babies when they want something. I went over to their shared crib, at first we had two separate ones, but they would cry and sneak into the other crib somehow. I picked up Will and smelled him, which at first seemed really weird, but now just seems like second nature, I didn't smell anything bad so he must be hungry, also there was how he was practically reaching straight down my shirt, when I checked Tyler he was the same way. I held them both as I walked over to the rocking chair and just took off my entire shirt, the twins were old enough to stop breastfeeding and I didn't really like the pain, but I really didn't feel like getting up and grabbing food at the moment. They've been crying a lot more lately because their teeth are coming in and they're teething so I'm going to give them one of their little teething things that are currently in the freezer. Once they were done I put my shirt back on and grabbed the toy, putting them back to bed. When I got back to my room I saw the light was on and Draco was wide awake reading one of his many books.
"Keep up, will you?" I said with a small laugh and went slightly slower so he didn't have to run to keep up with me. After about ten minutes, we got to my small apartment. I sighed, opening the door and locking my bike to the railing of the stairs on the ground floor.
Hours and hours of labor later I was finally pain free holding my two new babies, with Draco next to me asked the nurse if I had broken his hand in the process. Two perfect, identical twin boys born at almost the exact same time.
"Really, I thought it was a bit weird."
"I don't know if it was best to let someone who's extremely stoned cook for us." Tony said as I walked out with the two pies. Once I had brought everything out we all started eating and by the complete silence, I could tell it all was well received.
"I wanted to talk like things, and don't talk like that, you sound like a complete ass hole." I said, making Malfoy frown a bit.
"God, that does not taste very good, I don't know how they can drink that stuff!" Draco said, getting up and going into the bathroom to wash out his mouth.
"Oh no, it's just… you've changed so much since the last time I saw you. Last time I saw you, you looked just like James, but now you're… you're Harry and there's also the fact that you're now twenty years old. I mean, you're practically in the grave!" I laughed a bit, doing the math in my head.
"Well, you're on birth control though, right?" Draco asked and I rolled my eyes, he was really starting to piss me off.
"Loki?" The one girl asked. "Is she.. Okay?" Good, Lord, I found everything funny didn't I? Once again, Loki sighed and looked at me with disappointment.
"I didn't say that, I was just making sure. Look at me Harley," he said, lifting my head up to look him in the eyes, "this is going to be very difficult, but don't think I love you any less because of it." He said, it was the first time he ever said he loved me and it was like a huge weight off my shoulders.
"Now you do! Happy Christmas." He said, with an undoubtable amount of holiday cheer. I grabbed the bottle and two shot glasses, ripping off the bow and pouring him some.
"Fuck it, I'm just going to wear this." I said, taking out a stretchy short sleeved dress and putting it on, thankfully, it fit. "I'll be back in about an hour and a half." I said, grabbing my purse and storming out of the apartment to go shopping. When I got back I saw that the giant pile of clothes was gone and the bedroom was clean which improved my mood a bit. I put away my new clothes that were mainly large v necks, leggings and those pants with the elastic band instead of a waist band, one things I didn't think about was bras or shoes which would later become a problem. When I was finished, Draco was behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist and resting his hands on my bump. I turned around and looked up into his eyes, suddenly filled with lust. I jumped up into his arms, wrapping my legs around his waist and kissing him with passion as if I could never get enough of him.
"You painted all this art on the walls?" He asked, looking particularly at a large painting of a fallen angel with broken wings. The painting was really expressive, with smeared paint as is water was spilled on it, but not enough for it to be a blur, it was one of my better works with a bright background of reds and oranges and the dark form of the crying maiden.
"Nope. Why?" He asked.
"Well, I'll be back in the morning to lock up. Everything works, there's food in the kitchen. Goodnight." I said, walking out and locking him inside. I walked back to Stark Tower in a daze. Not only was I super high, but it was also because of everything that just went down, two years ago we were trying to kill each other and now we shared a blunt on a first name basis. When I got back I realised how late it was and Loki was sitting on the couch, waiting for me.
"I can't remember. Did you check everywhere?" He asked, waking up a bit quicker now.
"Harry, I've always loved you." Draco said, never taking his eyes off the bright colored sky. I smiled, snaking my body up, meeting his soft lips with my own and kissing to the chorus of Lust for Love, it was perfect. This kiss deepened, Sirius was off in his own world, probably falling asleep until I was holding myself up on top of Draco. The kiss only broke when the doorbell rang, the food was here.
"I can't afford a place like this with only one job, especially at a coffee shop. I'll get you a blanket and you can look around while I'm gone. I have some good books and some food in the fridge. I'll be back around three." I ran around, grabbing the things I would need. I dressed in some skinny black dress pants and a white button down with the sleeves rolled up. I put on some leather boots and on top of everything, my long, black wool coat, leaving it open and finishing it off with my brown leather messengers bag.
"That's it! You're gone, get out and don't come back!" I quickly ran up the stairs, I didn't know what to do, thinking about it's, just what I wanted. I gathered a small bag with my wand among other things and released Hedwig, she would have a better life without me, I just know it. I ran back downstairs and left without saying a word, I'll just leave, they don't need me and certainly don't need anyone other than myself. I wonder what the wizarding world will do without their precious Harley Potter, looking behind me I noticed Hedwig was following me and I sighed, she was my familiar and no matter how much it would hurt her to stay with me, I couldn't bear the thought of leaving her. I had been walking for hours it seemed and finally wound up in the middle of the city of Surrey, the parts I had only visited briefly because my uncle decided it was to dangerous for his little Dudykins, I liked it. The only problem was that I had no money to go and stay anywhere and so I decided the little street corner in front of a clothing store was perfect for me, there was even a little bench for me to sleep on. I laid down and fell asleep with Hedwig sitting on my arm, watching anyone who would like to come close to me. For about a day it was nice, the thing was however, that I needed food. I snuck around, stealing for shops and not getting caught, but that couldn't go on forever and my inheritance was coming up, God! Why did I have to be born in July? It all happened one day I was walking around the upper ends of Surrey and I just suddenly collapsed, blacking out completely.
"Babe, it's going to be-" Draco said by.
"Are you hungry?" Steve asked, which caught my attention immediately, not only have I not eaten in about three days, I was also extremely stoned so that was a YES. I just nodded my head and Steve lead the way to the kitchen.
"It's my magic! You could've just left me on that sidewalk a year ago, I would've been fine! You can't control me, I'm my own person! JUST STOP!" I screamed and ran out, my headache making my vision blur. I quickly put an invisibility spell on, going to my room I jumped out the window before plummeting about a hundred feet before taking wings out and flying. I had always loved flying no matter what I was using to do so, but when I flew with my wings I felt free, gliding through the air gracefully. I landed in front of my bakery and walked over to the alley, putting my wings away and becoming visible once more. I grabbed my keys from my purse and unlocked the shop, going upstairs to see Draco right where I left him, maybe we shouldn't open today. I dropped my bag on the couch and took off my jeans and put on one of his shirts, crawling up next to him in bed and falling asleep in his arms. When I woke up I was all alone, but I could hear noise coming from the kitchen. I got up, my headache finally gone thankfully, and walked into the kitchen to see Draco making pancakes. I just stood there and watched him cook, eventually lighting a cigarette. Upon smelling the smoke behind him, Draco turned around to see me standing there watching him in nothing but one of his shirts. Looking down I saw him adjust something in his pants and I chuckled, pleased by the fact that I could turn him on so easily.
"Hey Harry! You want to come take a break with me?" one of my waiter friends asked.
"I should've thought about your past before yelling, I know you don't like it when people yell at you, I'm sorry, I was just concerned about you. I didn't like it when you ran away, I thought you were never going to come back and so I waited for you every night to come home. When you told me you were staying with a guy I thought of the worst before thinking about you. I'm just happy you're not pregnant or something like that. I know if you were to stay with someone they wouldn't be dangerous or anything." Loki said and by this point I was actually crying, I couldn't believe that anyone other than Draco cared about me, it was nice not be a pawn. Loki's arms wrapped around me as I cried into his chest, there was nothing romantic about this, though it may look like it, Loki was like a father to me and I was like a daughter to him. We stayed like this until I had calmed down and then we went upstairs to watch a movie until I had to go and open up the bakery. It was truly an eventful day, I told Loki however, that if I was going to stay the night again, I would call him or text him so he doesn't think I've been kidnapped or something.
"How about I make something?" I asked, after almost fourteen while years of cooking for the Dursleys, I could practically work at a five star restaurant in London.
"Harry, what's wr-" I cut him off with a deeply passionate kiss, nearly slamming him into the window with the force of it. He moaned when I bit his lip softly, I loved the taste of his lips and there was no denying it. He threw me back so that I was laying on the bed and he was hanging over me, running his hands through my hair as our lips danced as one. I was happy that our building was around those of only about two floors because I didn't want anyone to see us, I also didn't want to be watched either. I tugged at Draco's shirt and he took it off, along with my own. I flipped him over in one playful moment and fingered the waistband of his jeans, touching his skin hidden by the fabric. I was just about to go even farther when suddenly… it was over.
After a couple of months of being thrown in the wind I found a job that would be perfect for me. A bartender, I had always loved cooking, but especially when Aunt Petunia asked me to make her evening 'tea' so I applied at a bar near the building I lived in downtown. During the day I worked at a high end coffee shop, but at night I was flipping bottles and mixing drinks for the people of London. On my days off I would paint and try to sell my work and even write a bit, this was going to work, and I didn't need any magic to do it.
"Where have you been? You were suppose to be home almost two hours ago." I immediately felt like a little teenager being caught after sneaking out all night long.
"What are you looking for?" Draco asked, looking up from his spot on the bed.
"I'm Cindy Greenwood, I work in the art industry. Do you have any pictures of any of your work?" She asked and my heart soared, this could be it, my break. I whipped out my phone, going through the gallery and showing her the picture of the broken angel.
"Ow, that hurt." He said, rubbing the back of his head, this time it was my turn to smirk.
Three years later…
"Draco, come, sit by me." I said, scooting over in fear that he just might pass out. He fell down and just started at the wall, still in shock. "Draco!" I yelled, snapping him out of it.
"I missed you to Hedwig. I'm sorry for leaving, but I didn't really have a choice." I said petting her gently on the head. I walked back into the kitchen, placing Hedwig on my shoulder and giving her a couple pieces of bacon.
"Well, seeing as you'll be staying here for what seems like the inevitable future, I guess you should know the others. My brother is Thor, the annoying one is Tony, the shorter guy is Bruce, and then there's Clint and Steve and finally, Natasha." Loki said, pointing out each one, I was surprised, I kind of looked like Natasha.
"I'm sorry for slapping you." I said, he was right. There was no way of telling if I was pregnant or not, especially after only the first night.
"So, Draco. I took three tests and it turns out that I'm pregnant, also I got an apartment in Brooklyn and I want you to move in with me." I said so abruptly that Draco choked on his water.
"Yes I do, I just don't get a lot of money for it, so here I am." I said with a small chuckle, handing the other people their coffee as she leaned up against the counter.
"Yeah, I don't have a bed in there, but I could order some furniture and it would arrive tomorrow morning. If that's okay. I get how hard it is for people who left the wizarding world with no or only a bit of muggle education on record." Draco thought about it for a second, I could tell he was shocked at my offer, but I didn't want him to sleep on the streets.
"Are you...high?" He asked, making me erupt with of giggles.
"What?"
"I did and I loved them! I couldn't believe how good you are, and it's nice to see that you don't have any paint on your face today." We laughed a bit and talked about art concepts and some of my pieces and she even put me in contact with an art dealer. This calmed me down a bit, but when I got home I still need two scotches and a make out session before I was ready. Draco and I had gone out two nights before and got a tree along with some lights and ornaments, but not to much. We even got presents for everybody and wrapped them up, putting them underneath the tree like a traditional muggle. Sirius came first, putting his presents under the tree along with ours and I put on some old Christmas vinyl I had bought for the occasion.
"God that was horrible." He said in between coughs.
"NO!" I screamed, trying to resist, but I watched as they snapped my wand in two, everyone looking at me with nothing but pure hatred painted across their faces. Why was this happening to me?
"Sort of, but that;s all I need." I said as I tried to walk forward, but failed horribly and fell down, which was a very bad idea. Draco had only heard the thump of me hitting the floor, but I felt the relief when the button popped clear off, tearing the fabric of the pants. Draco ran over to see me crying once again, my pants buttonless.
"You truly are an amazing artist." Draco said finally, it was now close to noon and the painting was only half complete. "There is one thing you are forgetting however, in your face, you have some freckles on your cheeks." Draco pointed out and I looked over at him with my brow furrowed.
"No where."
"Really?" He breathed.
"Eh, it's a new habit some would say. Would you like one? It's a good stress release." When I was in school, they never told us of the dangers of drugs and I never knew just how addicting they'd be.
Two days later I felt the symptoms of my period coming around like sensitive boobs and cramps which was a relief to say the least. The only thing was that I was also nauseous which had never happened before. Either way, I wasn't pregnant and so I didn't care. The next day I was sparring with Loki and got really tired, falling asleep directly afterward despite getting more then enough sleep the night before. The next couple days I waited, and waited for my period to start, but there was nothing, nothing at all. One night I was sitting with Draco and he came over with two glasses of scotch, but I didn't want it.
"Well, maybe not today. I have this apartment over the shop and I only use it for an office, if you want you could work at the shop and live in the apartment at the top." I said, insecure about almost everything in that entire sentence. Draco's head snapped up, looking me in the eyes to see if I was kidding.
"Don't give me that attitude girl, you're lucky we even gave you a home after your retched parents died." I felt my emotions spike, no one talked about my parents like that.
"Oh, Sirius, I have to go to work." He stopped in the middle of talking about various colors of Christmas lights and looked at me with a wrinkled brow.
"Woo! Now the party's getting started!" Sirius said, shaking his head, he was acting like a frat boy.
"Harry?" George asked, walking up to me looking perplexed.
"I thought you said that you wanted a child? And then you turn around and say you can't take this. If you don't think you can just leave!" I said with tears running down my face.
"Well, Harley, today is your day off, but we will start the training first thing tomorrow." For the rest of the day I walked around the apartment, logging every inch of into my memory until I knew where everything was happy for my new life, this was full of opportunities that I couldn't pass up, and best of all, no one knew where I was.
"You be quiet Malfoy. Harry is dark and he killed my sister! It's not our fault the ministry gave us his money as compensation, he was the who murdered his friend and future wife!" This shocked me even more, they were parading around with MY money? Also, they were planning to set me up with Ginny? She was like my sister, I would never like her like that.
"So, Harry, is this your place?" Bill asked, looking around.
"What do you mean extra parts? Is she like a guy and a girl." One of the other guys said, I remember seeing him on TV one time. With an easy I never knew I had, I charmed the shirt so it wouldn't break and took out my wings.
"I would've thought you would be living in a box somewhere seeing as you're a wanted criminal." He said.
"No, not really. What I didn't know was that she had illegal drugs in her bag and when she woke decided to use them." The guy from TV started to laugh, joining me.
Christmas day finally came and I was a nervous wreck. I needed Draco and drugs to calm me down, but I had to go to work and so did Draco since he got the job at a high class restaurant around the block. I was so proud of him, he was now a waiter/music critic/blogger and he was training to be a wine expert to go along with him. Business at the coffee shop was slow in the morning, people going to church and opening presents and stuff like that, but one person I did see was Cindy.
I ran through the halls without any resistance, no one knew who I was, my face was completely unrecognisable from what I looked like when I got to Azkaban in the first place. Going through level, after level I finally got to the ground where a huge battle was underway. The ministry against Voldemort and his death eaters, they actually thought they were going to win? I almost started laughing as I snuck past them, out into the open via a huge hole in the wall. I grabbed one of the boats there and started rowing like my life depended on it, which it did, if I was caught I would be sentenced to death. Luckily, it was nighttime and I got away without problem. I reached the shore hours later and finally got to appreciate the fresh air and the ground. Tears fell from my eyes because for the first time in years I could smell the earth and trees around me. It seemed to be summer, but we were far up north, so it didn't take very long for me to start shivering. That's when I started my journey. I nearly died only a couple days after I got out from cold and hunger, but I stumbled upon some campers and got to steal some clothes and food. After what seemed like only a week or two, I busted out of the woods, straight onto a highway. Narrowly avoiding a car, I followed the road to the nearest town where I pickpocketed a couple people to stay at a hotel for a night. When I walked in I knew I didn't ft in, I looked like I spent the last years in the woods and smelled like it to, but I didn't really care.
"Ah! My amazing dogfather!" I yelled when he walked in, laughing with Draco afterwards. "Draco, meet my godfather and your cousin, the infamous Sirius Black!" I set, going into another fit of laughter.
"It's all right." Draco said and I sighed, hoping to god I wasn't pregnant, I really didn't need this at the moment. Draco held me tight until I was finally calm once more, but I was still terrified. My period was in about a couple days and so we'll see then. After that I got up and ate breakfast with Draco, then I opened the bakery, but I still couldn't get the thought of me being pregnant off my mind for the rest of the day.
"Where are we?" He asked as I jumped down from my bed, walking over to him.
"I enlarged them with magic."
"Sure Will, could you cover me a bit John?"
"I'm seventeen." I tried to defend myself and stay serious, but it was hard.
"Will and Tyler, born June 20th at 3:54 and 3:55 in the morning." Draco said behind me, I handed him Tyler and Loki Will and went to sleep almost immediately, I was completely exhausted from the last seven hours.
"Yeah, I get it. I'm hot, but can you apparate?" I asked.
"I honestly don't know." I said with a small chuckle, to my surprise, Will pulled out a cigarette and started smoking. "I didn't know you smoked WIll." I said, slightly shocked.
Living Room
When I walked in, I was two minutes late and I nearly ran behind the counter. No one seemed to feel the need to tell my I had paint all over my face except for one kind woman.
"I think we should move out." I said, watching Loki's face going from caring to confused.
"Bye Sirius, and try to sleep."I said, giving him one last hug along with a blanket. I ran down the stairs, I was going to be late. I grabbed my bike and peddled as fast as I could, arriving at the bar just in time for my shift to start.
"Why do you care? You're on Voldemort's side anyways." I said, continuing cleaning the counter I was behind.
"Why don't we try it out?" I walked over and grabbed my own, filling it up we both lit up.
"So, what are you going to name them?" Loki asked, walking up to us.
"Well, I can always fix that." Draco said and pushed me forward a bit to start massaging my back. God, this was orgasmic. I actually fell asleep to him doing this, but I don't think he minded, he just woke me up about an hour later for dinner.
Over the next day I pushed myself into my training, but never saying a word, I was so ashamed of myself, I couldn't believe the things I had done. One day I was going down to the training room expecting some heavy book work today, but instead Loki was just sitting on the carpet. I walked over and sat down next to him not speaking a word until spoken to.
"I don't know that, they could hate me and tell everyone in the wizarding world where I was. I would go back to Azkaban and I don't ever want to step foot back in there. I'm so happy with my life, with you, I just don't want to ruin it." I put my head in my hands, shaking it back and forth trying to clear my head. I sighed, getting up. I walked over to my dresser, knowing that my worries won't go down one bit if I just sit and mope. I smoked almost the entire pipe, giving only some to Draco. He didn't mind, though, he doesn't really like me when I'm wrought with worry.
When I woke up I was in Draco's arms, which was great except for the fact that I really had to pee. I slowly pulled Draco's arms off of me and crawled out of bed, getting up I started to get ready, taking a shower and getting dressed, the thing was that there was something missing. Draco woke up to me looking around the apartment for something.
"Thank you, I don't know how I can repay you." He said, I was only slightly embarrassed at the gratitude he showed me.
"Please, he was your savior and now look where we are! Terrified of the dark lord with no hope, you condemned our hope and now we're all going to die! Also, he would never marry your sister, didn't you see how he looked at her, it wasn't with lust but a sisterly love. Would you have married her Weasley?" Ron snapped at that, whipping out his wand and firing off a spell. I don't know what came over me, but I dropped my things and tackled Malfoy, narrowly missing the spell.
"Oh no Harry! He's found us out!" Draco said, acting surprised making me laugh even harder.
"What's wrong Harley?" He asked, using the alternative to my name.
"Well, for pure bloods we usually have children within the first three years of the marriage which is almost immediately after we leave Hogwarts, so I've been prepared for this, but then there was the war so, yeah." I growled, mad at nothing, but still pissed.
"Whatever, at least you have clothes on. Where are your wings?" He asked, looking back at me with a bit of annoyance in his eyes.
"I'm training you so that you can protect yourself and use all of your magic. You are the most powerful mortal I've ever seen in all my years and I don't want to waste your magic on mundane things."
"I'm guessing we're not opening up the bakery today?" Draco said, making me chuckle.
"Draco?" I asked looking at his withdrawn form in confusion, I was horny and he had seemed pretty into it a second ago.
"Wait, do you mean your boobs are getting bigger?" Draco asked with raised eyebrows.
"Doesn't she have a family to go back to?" Bruce asked.
"Shut it Draco. Yes, this is Draco and we're friends now. He's not a little prat anymore and he's actually pretty nice, but he can leave you in the middle of things." I said with a chuckle, receiving a smack up the head.
"Of course I do, but I just had to get them on, I'll put them back to normal in a bit." I took a deep breath and reversed the spell, feeling the pants shrinking on me.
"I am not a parasite, you allow me to live here. Parasites are unwanted and freeloaders, go back to school Potter." I rolled my eyes, laughing.
"She went through her magical inheritance, it changes your body structure sometimes and can give you extra parts."
"I don't, it hurts my back." I said, looking down at it with distaste.
"Well, we decided we'd call the older one William Harrison Potter-Malfoy and the younger one Tyler Jonathan Potter-Malfoy." I said, looking down at my two beautiful children.
"Magic." I said, sitting down at the table with my pizza, the only bright side of the morning.
"Why?" He asked.
"Don't be scared Steve, she's my familiar, she understands what I'm saying and she won't hurt anyone, unless they hurt me." I said, placing pancakes on the table. We ate in silence like always, but I was especially happy now that Hedwig was back and decided that I needed some owl supplies for her. After breakfast everyone cleaned up, but I got ready, getting dressed and grabbing my bag I went out on the town. Ever since I got here, I loved New York City and America for that matter, it was always nce in the city with different people and cultures from all over the world. It really opened up your mind. I was walking along, coming back from the owl shop when someone started running towards me and grabbed my bag. I was thrilled, this was my first mugging! I turned around and started to run after him, using my superior speed, I caught up quickly and took him down with ease, grabbing my bag back, I went on with my day. I was so proud of myself for that, I used the training Loki had given me for the past month and took down someone who wanted to do harm. When I got back we started training and by the time the day was over, my mind hurt from all the books I had read.
"Sorry, but it doesn't look like it." When I looked up I saw that Sirius was holding out a bottle of the very drink he was talking about.
"I love you so much Harry." Draco said as I ran my hands through his silky hair. He was currently lying on my lap, staring at the ceiling as I read one of my many books.
"Nothing, it's just that I should've gotten my period three days ago…" I said, a sense of dead in my heart, weighing everything down making me extremely tired. My hands itched for a cigarette to ease the stress I had, but if I was pregnant then it would be harmful for the child. Slight tears streaked my cheeks as I looked at my hands, I was suppose to get my period, but I guess I'm pregnant.
It turns out hitchhiking to London wasn't that hard when everyone's heading in that direction. People who had went up north for the summer were now going back to London and their jobs so I just hitched a ride with a couple of nice people who didn't murder me and soon enough, I was standing in the middle of muggle London. The smoggy air was even more comforting than the fresh air of the wilderness, London was where I spent some of the best years of my life selling my art.
"You know, sometimes I like your mood swings." He said when I stopped with a little smirk on his face I suddenly found extremely attractive.
"Come on." I said, patting the side of my leg.
When I woke up the next day, the sun was just beginning to rise and so I put on some old t shirt and sweatpants and grabbed some paint. That's where Draco found me a couple hours later, walking over to me still in what he fell asleep in, no shirt and some of my old pajama pants that were a bit to long for him. We had slept in the same and I neither of us cared, it may have taken the sweet haze of drugs for us to confess our love, but it had been there before yesterday, before we had even become friends. We sat in peaceful silence for a bit, Draco watching me paint until it became clear. It was the two us, in each others embrace, lips touching, but it only showed our torsos, the rest of the painting was there colors of the sunset in the background, it was amazing.
"Yes, Malfoy?" I asked, trying to stop myself from unknowingly flirting with him, but still trying to come off as hot.
"Well the, what are you training me for because everything you do seems pretty obsolete to me!" I yelled back wanting nothing more than to just go back to sleep.
"It's nice seeing you again Gorge, would you like a drink?" I asked, trying to lighten the mood.
"You may not recognize me Malfoy, but some would say I was your worst enemy, most 'worst enemy's don't stick up for them like that." I said with a laugh.
"Shut up." I growled taking off both of our shirts and attacking him once more with such force, I pushed us back onto the bed where I landed on top of him, just about knocking the air out of his lungs.
"Ugh, I hate this." I said as I walked out, my back was also starting to hurt due to the twins and everything was just completely painful. I sat down on the bed, cross legged and leaned as far forward as I could, trying to stretch out my back and make it feel better. I felt as Draco scooted up behind me and put his legs on either side of mine leaning against the wall. I sat back up and leaned against him as he wrapped his arms around me, resting his hands on my now rounded belly.
"Ugh, Draco, you really know how to screw with a man don't you?" I asked, looking at his shirtless chest with lust in my eyes.
"But they hurt!" I whined trying to break free of Draco's hold.
When we walked in, Loki was sitting on the couch reading a book, but stopped when we heard us arrive.
"Yes?" I asked, wondering what he could be so nervous about!
"Hey! You two be nice to each other! Everyone come 'round," Sirius was definitely tipsy, "it's present time!" I grabbed one more drink and went over to sit on the couch. Sirius was the closest to the tree, so he handed out the presents, the twins were sitting on the rug next to him and Draco, Bill, Charlie, and myself were sitting on the couch. Everyone had about six presents except for Hedwig who had only gotten something from Draco and I. Draco had gotten me a whole two ounces of weed, along with some nice paint. Sirius had gotten me a little black dog figurine, and Fred and George had gotten me some joke stuff, Charlie gave me some nice dragon skin boots and Bill got me silver necklace that said, 'Undesirable No. 1' which made me laugh. The thing that I was the most excited about was the present I had gotten Draco. Seeing as we were both little stoners I had also gotten him some weed, but I also got him some lighters and a pipe. Not any pipe though, this one was special. The pipe was long, made of white wood that had black carvings in it. I had carved it myself (a skill I got from Azkaban) the design was beautiful if I might say myself, I had carved a dragon and a snake and they seemed to dance, curling around the pipe with a certain grace.
"Well, I said that you could work at my shop, I've had a hard time finding a cashier and I'll even pay you, you need new clothes anyway." I said, looking down at the dirty rags he was currently wearing. We continued talking until the blunt was gone, that's when we went inside and I grabbed some blankets from a closet and set them down on the only real thing of furniture, a couch.
"Shut up! You never met them and you have no right to say that!" I screamed, a lamp breaking right next to Dudley's fat face.
"Hello Harry." She said, I didn't think I'd ever see her again to be honest.
I was walking around the mortal world on one of my annual visits when I felt something approaching with very powerful magic. This struck me as odd because most of the lowly witches and wizards of this world stayed hidden and never had this amount of magic, this was very unusual. I looked for the source until I felt a spike in the magic and a small girl fell to the ground a couple feet in front of me with an owl on her shoulder. She was beautiful to say the least, pale skin with dark auburn hair, I wonder what was wrong with her? I didn't want this magic to go away, there was potential for her, I could train her and so I picked her up and decided it was time to go back to the Stark Tower. When I arrived almost everyone was in the living room, great, the one time they want to gather I'm bring back a small child from England, perfect.
"Do you think I'm stupid? Of course." I rolled my eyes, some things never change.
"None of your business, and no, she's not dead." I said, seeing the question in Steve's eyes. Without another word I walked past them to my room where I laid the girl down on the bed. Looking back at her, she's small, but she definitely was older than fifteen. Suddenly, she moved from her comatose state, writhing around violently and letting out tortured screams of agony. I quickly put up a silencing ward and started to examine the girl. After a bit I saw that she was going through her inheritance, that must mean today's her birthday and she's seventeen. I decided to leave her, knowing that she wouldn't wake up until the day was over, going back into the living room.
"Harley." He moaned slightly, I gripped it and started petting it, he moaned my name once more. With my other hand, I turned off the stove so we didn't burn the place, and we backed away, over to the couch where my purse was still sitting with the condoms I had bought the night before. Draco was on top of me and snuck his fingers up my shirt and to my clit. We both pleasured each other until we felt we were ready I grabbed my purse and pulled out a condom giving it to him to put on. In seconds he was fully on top of me going in and out, we switched positions a couple times, until we came together as one, climaxing with passion. One we were done I laid down next to him and he held me in his arms. After about ten minutes, I got up to take a shower and Draco, to my surprise, decided to join me.
"Okay so, you hold it up t your mouth like this and I'll light it, then you take a deep slow breath and try and keep it in as long as you can. You most definitely start coughing and that 's why have the water, but still you need to take a couple hits before you start feeling it." He just nodded and did as I said, and just as I predicted, he started coughing as if he had terminal lung cancer.
"You know Harry, a lot of people believed you. The twins, Bill, and Charlie have all distanced themselves from their family because they supported you and wouldn't take everyone talking bad about you. We could and see them some time if you want, I'm sure they'd be overjoyed to see you. Bill married a french girl name Fleur and Charlie is visiting for Christmas, they refuse to go and see the rest of their family and have ever since you left so they're having Christmas at the twins loft."I thought about it for a second. The twins and I had been extremely close, closer than the rest of the 'golden trio' as most people liked to call us and it would be nice to be in their company again. I had never met Bill or Charlie, but I had always wanted to, the last Christmas I had was back in my third year, but it was fun.
"I was not expecting those." He said to himself, but I somehow heard him perfectly.
"Well, I found her in England, unconscious, but I could feel her magic, it was like no morals I had ever encountered. Now, once she wakes up I decided that I'll train her because her. Seeing as I'm the god of magic, I think she'll appreciate it." I explained.
"No, I should've listen to you. I know you only have my interest at heart, but I couldn't see that. I've been controlled my entire, that's what I ran away from and I never wanted to be like that again." I said, tears collecting in my eyes, I leaned over and rested my head on Loki's shoulder, to my surprise, he didn't move.
"Sure, why not. I have no reputation that isn't already ruined, why not resort to drugs?" I chuckled for a bit, handing Draco the pipe and the lighter.
"Oh, these? Yes, neither did I, but now I'm part bat and I can't do anything about it." I said, trying to grab at one of my wings. The man looked confused and walked closer.
A couple days later I found a nice apartment on the shore with a view of the brooklyn bridge, it was really nice and fit my taste. I told Loki about it and he seemed okay with it I then signed the lease and bought all the furniture we would need, having it delivered to the place with Loki helping me put it where it needs to be via magic. I then went grocery shopping for everything we may need and stocked the apartment until it felt like home. I still haven't told Draco about it yet. Today was the day I would just lay it all on him. I walked into the bakery and up the stairs to the apartment to find Draco sleeping. He smelled heavily of alcohol and I could tell that the day before he got wasted, and so I woke him up with a quick hangover potion and made him breakfast.
I sneezed, dammit, I was getting sick, I could already feel myself weakening. I was the only one to blame though, I ran away from my abusive relatives home when I was about seven years old, they had almost beat me to death. I had always loved painting, so I thought I could make some good money selling off my paintings, but no one wanted to pay a small child for barely above average work. I didn't have any money and I wasn't going back to Surrey, my only choice was the streets. I walked all the way from Surrey to London where I thought I could get some money for my paintings, and I did, but only enough for some food and more painting supplies.
For the next day we practically lived without our clothes on, going at it again and again, if I wasn't pregnant before, I definitely am now. When I left I felt the dreadful realization crash down on me that I was most likely pregnant. I mean, unprotected sex before your period at my age? There's a three hundred percent chance of a baby. Just to be sure I walked down to the little grocery store down the street and got two boxes of two pregnancy tests, got to be sure. I then put them in my purse and walked back to Stark Towers with the anxiety of everything on my shoulders. I drank two whole bottles of water as I walked just so I would be prepared for the test and wouldn't have to wait any longer than necessary. Luckily, when I walked in I saw no one and I walked directly to my room and into the connecting bathroom. I really had to pee now so I got the little boxes from my purse and quickly unwrapped it reading the instructions and following them perfectly. I actually had enough pee for all but one of the sticks, but I didn't care as long as it gave me results. I waited five burning minutes until the results started to show, finally, they were done but I was terrified to look at them. I wanted to scream I didn't know what to do. It took a bit, but peaked and soon enough I was looking with dread growing in my stomach. Positive, every single one of them. I quickly gathered them all up and threw them away walking out of the bathroom with tears in my eyes. I fell to my bed, rolling up into a ball and holding myself tight. I couldn't hear anything around me I was just consumed with fear and sadness and so when I felt a hand on my back I nearly jumped a foot in the air. It was Loki. i wanted to disappear at this very moment, he was going to ask me why I was crying and I don't know if I could tell him the truth.
He crosses his arms, a serious expression on his face. – We need to talk –
helping! And you still haven’t told me what happens if I can’t make it in time!”
- That, my friend, was strategy, - I affirm. If she sees my like a sweet little poor girl who believes at what her parents and the Ministry say, someone who would go to her to complain about the voices she hears, someone she can easily manipulate and control and trust with spying other students, I’ll be able to deceive her!
Her expression is the answer.
- We need to make a more decisive move, - Pansy affirms. – Halfblood, I know you don’t like the idea, but every nice try we did have failed, we need to be eviler –
I get off the train, inhaling the good fresh mountain air of the Scotland. In the ocean of students, I see my friends in a corner of the station, looking around, probably searching me. I smile and start to walk towards them… And I see Miles Bletchley approaching them and aggressively starting to talk to them.
. I imprint the spell on something, give that something to them and they can activate it with a little focus and magic. It could actually work…
- Stop your pessimism! You’re not gonna ruin my plans! – I affirm.
- Weren’t you on diet? – she raises and eyebrow. Damn it! She can do it!
I share a worried look with Pansy before knelling in front of our friend. Draco follows Blaise suggestions and for some minutes we just stay silent, watching the panic leaving him slowly.
“Oh, don’t start again!”
- Okay, you don’t know, - I affirm. – Then, let me explain it for you, and stop me if something comes up to your mind –
I can feel the energy in every ink of my body, giving me life, giving me magic.
- What!? – Ginny can’t help to exclaim. Luna gently takes my hand.
I mostly bluffed, since I’m such a dangerous person. But in my world, I learned that a very good bluff can do a lot.
I turn again to him, already tired of his shit, and I see his hand going to my wrist. Where there is the beautiful talisman Luna’s made for me. That he will ruin.
So, it's not as good as I hoped, but I'm half asleep and already rewrote it thrice, so I'll just drop it here hoping to not regret it tomorrow morning, when my neurons will come back to life.
- You… forgot, - she repeats.
- This is a very unfortunate accident, - the rabbit keeps talking. – But we can’t send you back, since your body is no longer functional to host you soul. That’s why I am here, to offer you a deal –
A written appears in front of my eyes.
- Just shut up and listen to us, - Pansy affirm. If one day she’ll be gentle with me, I’ll know something is wrong.
I must force myself not to giggle and jump and scream in happiness. It could be not useful to the image I want to give of me, like a human being with a dignity and a brain.
- I will say to you next time I’ll go to the forest, - Luna affirms. – Friends… -. She smiles one last time before going to her afternoon lessons.
- I wasn’t flirting! – I defend myself. – I was just joking a little! –
- Perfect, - it’s my comment.
Well, screw them! I won’t marry just because a stupid Dark Lord of Not-Noses ordered to!
From Pansy, it’s like the biggest compliment of the whole world. Hermione and Ron don’t seem to think the same, if they’re expression are an indication.
Draco laugh at her jokes and share significant looks with Blaise when Pansy is being a dramatic queen. He could appear relaxed, but every move he does seem to be controlled, as he’s holding back every spontaneity. When he tease, he’s sharp, but when he makes jokes, he’s hilarious.
doing here in the middle of the night? -
- Stupid pining, - Pansy says. The secret door opens. I can’t help but laugh.
- Sorry! – Pansy exclaims, and honestly, she could do better to try to hide the laugh from her voice. Ron gets up and stumbles on his foot, falling to Draco who’s passing by. Draco ends up next to Harry in the ground of the class. Immediately, Pansy closes the door and seals it with a spell. We hear the two of them knocking at the door shouting angry.
- Absolutely! – I nod seriously. – Could you help me find a good talisman? They’re hard to find these days… -
- It’s just the temporary plan, of course, - I admit. – The next one will certainly work! –
- Now! – she grabs my arm drag me out of the main hall. I watch the tables full of food with desperation.
So. Where was I?
That’s when I feel it.
I blink a couple of times to come back to the real world. Professor McGonagall is staring at me, like the whole class actually.
- Congratulation! You will be moved to your new body in some moments! Enjoy the experience and leave a good review! –
He immediately grabs my arm. I sigh: again?
I roll my eyes. – I’m so scared –
- There are some good books about it in the History of Magic department, in the Spells department and in the Theory of Magic department, but if you search for more precise information, you’ll need to go to the prohibited section and for that you’ll need a permission from a professor – .
- And you say I’m the drama queen, - Pansy sits in the sofa in front of me. Blaise and Draco follows her immediately.
But. If I invent some more tricks… I could have more possibilities.
- Causing some problems, probably! – it’s my answer.
While I’m eating, someone fall next to me and give me the class schedule of this year.
Mmmh, yep, I like it. I would have
- I can’t get up, - I affirm. – I’m gonna pass out if I try to –
Only at this moment I turn around to see who I traumatized now.
- Aurora, I’m serious…! -. Ouch, he seems angry now. He must be worried I will get them involved.
We arrive at the class. I stop at the threshold, half -or more- of an idea to run away from my misery.
- Oh, you know, here and there… -
I have to work at my project. Focus on something that is not a mission impossible. Creating a whole new way to use magic is far funnier than planning a marriage for two idiots.
I don’t know how much time we stay here, in silence, in peace, observing these creatures. Slowly, the thestrals feel less scared and get closer, letting us touch them. Me and Luna help Ginny to understand where they are, and the smile on her face when she finally caresses one of them is priceless.
- You’re a little devil, - Pansy puts an arm on my shoulders. – I’m so proud of you! –
- Just cremate me, - it’s my answer. – And let my ashes in the Bermuda Triangle –
Ok, so… let’s start with something little.
- The “I’m planning some trouble” look, - he answers.
I hold the wand. –
Ok, what symbols?
(See the end of the chapter for
- Where? – I hear Pansy asking.
I’m at Hogwarts. Hermione is standing in front of me, hands raised to show me she’s not gonna hurt me. My arms are shacking and are still in position to protect myself.
- What do we have today? – asks Blaise.
- You call him by his name? – this is Hermione, if the indomitable curls are a clue.
- What essay? – I stop. Draco, Pansy and Zabini turn to me.
- I was looking for you, - Ginny walks to me completely ignoring the worm. – My brother said you can’t give up and that “the battle’s just started”, whatever that means –
- So that’s what you were doing? – .
Pansy is the one who talks the most. She can’t stay two seconds without teasing or joking or do dramatic declarations to make us laugh. She’s a sarcastic little bitch who doesn’t care if someone gets hurt by her words and doesn’t hold back what she’s thinking.
you’re doing it, but it’s a massive pain in the ass when, after only four hours of sleep, Pansy takes me off the bed. Literally.
I don’t even take two steps, that someone grab my wrist and force me to turn. I can’t stop the surprised and painful scream. I find myself staring at a very frowned face and an aggressive expression. Surprise of surprise, it’s Miles Bletchley.
doing here, - I answer to the worm. – Are you stalking me? –
The first minutes, it happens exactly nothing. I don’t feel “my soul”, nor my “inner energy”. It takes me four times of realizing I’m thinking about lessons, or the dinner, or the library, or Luna’s talisman... And I go back to the beginning and start again to free my mind.
- I don’t see what else… -
- And what are you doing here in the middle of the night? -. Reverse card, my friend!
- Finally! – it’s Pansy comment.
- It’s just that the kid isn’t actually angry, and when he is, it’s not for the reasons he keeps repeating to himself. His friends, who had witnessed this for years, decide to act to end the suffering of all, but the kid still refuses to understand what he’s feeling, he keeps thinking he’s just furious and can’t bear the other kid presence. Even when he wants so bad to keep interacting with him. Even if he’s scared one day the other kid will stop paying attention to him. Even if his feelings seem to only grow every day –
Two ginger heads are staring at me, one smiling, the other a little embarrassed.
And here I thought he was able to talk without shouting! What a disappointment.
- You already forgotten your engagement? – this is Blaise. – That’s a record, even for you –
I really think I could have a stroke right now. The last words of Pansy keep repeating in my head.
I snort and roll my eyes. Seriously, fifth department? Some better lines were too challenging? I mean, yes, he’s idiot, but there’s a limit to everything…
- Ron! – Harry approach his friend. – Where’s Hermione? –
Now she seems furious. – Shut up! You’re ridiculous! – and she walks away in large steps. Harry and Ron follow her, looking at me as I’m something they really can’t understand.
- Are you even listening to me? – Pansy snaps her finger in front of my eyes.
He seems to be close to collapse. I look at Blaise and Pansy in panic: what are we supposed to do now?! How do we managed all these feelings he’s having?!
Still smiling for this prospective of the future, I arrive to the third floor and step out of the stairs, to the corridor. That’s the exact moment I end up staring at someone else standing in front of me.
Yep. No filters.
Once team-Drarry, composed by severe-face, frowning-face, malicious-face and mastermind (yep, that’s me!) was created, we did all we could to make Drarry became real.
I let my focus expand, until I can feel the silent magic in the wand. The magic that is always there, waiting to link with me and transfer my energy into the outside world.
Hermione sighs again.
She stares at me. I smile, pretending everything it’s absolutely normal and I’m not out of the dormitory in the middle of the night. The secret is the confidence! I can do it!
Harry is incredibly silent. I remember the fifth year was the one he would be annoyed and ready to scream, but he’s just staring at me as he could find all my secrets looking in my soul.
- I’ve got an idea, - I say. – But you won’t like it –
First, it can’t be that I’m in the Harry Potter universe, the universe I wanted so bad to go as a kid that I legitimately cried for a year when my letter didn’t arrive (don’t judge! I know you did the same!) and Secondly, there’s no character named Aurora in the books! Who the hell did I become?! How the hell should I know about my life until this moment??
- She made me a beautiful talisman, - I explain, showing the bracelet to her.
He snorts.
- Yes? – I show my most innocent smile, wondering how much I zoned out.
- I’m sorry, I forgot I shouldn’t, - it’s my answer, because apparently, I have no filters nor good sense.
- Yep, Aurora’s awake, - he affirms.
Before she can add anything, I’m out of the office.
Harry turns around and she grabs his arm.
As if we can’t see how much they want to kill us, Pansy and I share a look and grab them, running out of the hall into a secret passage behind a painting.
- An accident, some time ago, - I explain. And really, it’s not a lie. I died. Thestrals are linked with death, so it makes sense. In the end, what am I, if not a dead soul who was so lucky to be able to continue another life in a different universe?
I emit a weird sound of desperation. – She will kill me… -
But spells to be conserved… It could be good for defense, not only mine, but of anyone who doesn’t really know how to do a precise spell, like
(See the end of the chapter for
- Not as much as something called revenge, - I smile back. – Who knows what can happen when you make the wrong person angry… -
- Found you, finally! –
“What a rip off!”
I sigh. One good news after the other…
Oh no, the surprise effect seems to be ended.
- You have that look on your face, - Draco says.
She sighs. – I don’t like to act behind his back –
She pushes me away while I burst laughing. If that all that it takes to make her blush, she’s less tough than I thought!
His eyes stare at me with… fear? Vulnerability?
- How can you don’t understand!? – he shouts. – Our parents are death eaters! He’s the Chosen One! –
Ginny sighs as she’s trying really hard to find the patience to have to do with her bigger brother. – See you around, Draco’s friend, - she smiles at me the last time before leaving.
I turn with a wide smile on my face: LUNA LOVEGOOD is sitting next to me! One of my favorite characters EVER!
He shacks his head and go back to the lesson.
So. From my notes, it’s clear that magic users have their wands to help them with their magic, but suppress their instinctive use of it that way. When they’re children, they feel the magic inside of them, use them driven by emotions or stress. Growing up, always using wands, they lose the habit to feel it themselves and giving it orders without help.
- This is a very serious matter, - I affirm as I didn’t hear them.
- Oh, I’ve seen your boyfriend when I went to take the sweets, - Pansy chooses this moment to kill me.
- Perfect, - my smile became more real. – Than we have a deal –
- Useless and boring, - she adds. – What do you have now? –
- Ok, Ronald Weasley, I can accept your excuses -. I get up. – But if you’ll act like that a second time, I won’t forgive you again -. I smile like an angel.
- I didn’t know it was your carriage, okay? I would never get in otherwise! – I affirm. It’s not my favorite thing, to be stared at as I am a snake ready to bite.
- It’s really late, tomorrow we have lessons! – Draco gets up too.
She’s talking, I know she’s talking, I can see her lips moving, I can hear her words… But I can’t focus to understand what the hell she’s saying. I hit my head a couple of times with my left hand.
I look outside the window: it’s already the evening!
- Leave him alone! – this is Hermione. She looks at us livid; Ron, next to her, has a similar expression on his face.
- I don’t care, - I affirm. – I would prefer to be dead after I choose for myself than alive at the side of someone I hate –
- What? –
Enjoy the ridicoulsness!
Ok. I will never, for any reason, tell the other characters a spoiler. Not even a little, tiny one!
I stare at the rabbit elegantly sitting in a little stool, a teapot and two cups placed in the small table in front of him. Around us, the absolutely nothingness: pure and infinite light.
- Oh, no, he’s just like that –
- You are one of Malfoy’s friends, right? – she asks.
The map appears in front of my eyes. I smile.
Dark skin, white eyes that look at us without fear, bat wings folded on the back. I just stare at them: they seem to stare back, to see me, the real me, the one who died in her world and arrived here. But I don’t feel scared.
- Miss Reckless? –
- Potion, Transfiguration, History of Magic and Erbology - I check the schedule.
- What is happening here? –
- Okay, - it’s all I can say. I literally have no idea what’s she’s talking about.
- Problems? – Pansy’s voice is like ice. Ron ignores her and only looks at Hermione.
Oh, but she’s probably only worried about rules that don’t get respected. Yes, that makes more sense.
“Wait… What if I don’t make it in time?”
Wow. He disgusts me every moment more.
He becomes livid. – Do you like making fun of me, don’t you? –
(See the end of the chapter for
- What do you want to do? Poison both with love filters? – Hermione asks.
- Oh, come on, - I roll my eyes. – We all know she’ll marry your brother… -
- Oh, stop it! – Pansy threatens to take my muffin from my hands and I immediately hide it from her dirty intentions.
, that’s for sure, you’re all so boring that you would probably stop me! – it’s my innocent answer.
- After breakfast, you know what to do, - I whisper to Pansy. She answers with a wide smile.
Depp breaths. I must take deep breaths. I’m fine. My aunt is not here. She can’t find me here. I’m fine. I’m fine.
- Just an innocent question, - she says then. – Shouldn’t you be at a lesson? –
I can work with that.
- Useless classes, - I shake my head.
- As I said, right? – Pansy says.
“As if I don’t know from the book…”
- Help me to erase the idiot part of you, - it’s her answer. And I mean, that’s basically the plan.
First of all, rude doing this in front of me, who can’t raise an eyebrow for her life! Secondly, how dare to call me out like that!
- He… he has… what? -. Ron shows us his best talking skills.
- That… I hate him more! –
I take back my goose quill from Draco’s hands and finish the last two sentences.
him, I just… removed him to think about more interesting stuff.
(Also, if there are errors, tell me immeditaely! English is not my first language)
After two really long minutes of waiting, here he is: Harry Potter, searching for his friends with a frown in his face. He walk into the corridor where Pansy and Ron are waiting. From the opposite part of the corridor, Draco.
- This year will suck, - she affirms. – Oh Aurora, you’re awake, finally –
- Are you becoming a drama queen like Pansy? – Draco says. – Please, spare us from this suffering! –
Potion wasn’t so bad. I was pretty good at chemistry in my world, and when we went to the laboratory, I always had so much fun understanding what I should add to the experiments to make them explode and made it seem an accident! I will understand how to it here too, but for now I simply follow the instructions Snape wrote while I try to understand what’s the logic behind the potions. It must be similar to chemistry: different components with different combination have different results. Some works, others not… Or not exactly how you wanted to. I must study all the components and their effect and find out the root of their functions, once I’ll understand this, I can start to invent some potions! And make explode others in the most “oops an accident” way!
"Ok. Whatever others say about it, it wasn’t my intention to make the Slytherin’s dormitory explode."
After another weird silence lunch with Pansy, Draco and Blaise, I run outside the castle. It’s a windy day, the air is fresh and I inspire it with a smile. I start to walk towards the forest. At this point, is the only place I actually never been yet. Something I plan to change very soon!
Ron isn't an idiot nor a bad character! And Pansy-Aurora-Ron-Hermione is a chaotic team I can't wait to write more!
- What? – it’s my brilliant replay to the someone watching to me. He looks familiar… I suck with faces, but I’m sure I should remember this one… I get up still looking at him.
- Absolutely! One hundred per cent! – I exclaim. We arrived at an empty class and Ron and Hermione are in front of us. When have we arrived here?
Thanks for the kudos! And to all who read it! And for the comments!
- Miss Reckless? -. McGonagall approach me and sits at one of the empty chairs.
I never read and studied something so quickly. The outside world stop existing while I read, understand the most important things and write them down rielaborating them. I’m so into it that I don’t even realize Draco’s trying to get my attention until he takes my goose quill from my hands.
- Every day since first year… - Blaise whispers, but even he has a better survival instinct than saying it out loud.
Apparently, there's actually someone who read this ridicolous story. And someone who like it!
Oh. So it’s one of
But no matter how much I try, I cannot process her words to save my life.
- For being an idiot? – it’s her response. I blink. She sighs, takes off some books from the loveseat and sits next to me.
- Oh, shut up, - I scratch my nose, embarrassed.
have a choice! We choose everyday how to act, and how we will behave in this war depends only on us! –
I immediately regret it when his grip gets tighter. I bite my tongue to not scream again. Despite what people could think, I still have dignity.
We end up laughing again. I feel so much better, now that the drama is out the way with all his idiotness with him. I absently wonder what would happen if Ginny wouldn’t arrive in time. Would Miles really throw me down the stairs?
- Fine. But you’re the one who will talk to them! –
I start to think that I’m not in a very vivid dream: I would never have enough imagination for this. Ok, so now I just need to remember how to speak properly.
We fell respectively on Draco and Harry to make them stumble to each other. We organized the classes seats in a way that left only two seats one next to the other for Harry and Draco to share. We left Draco finding on the ground some notes Harry “accidentally” lost after a lesson and let him give them back…
- What look? –
- Why not? – I reply, leaning on the wall with a smirk. – My personal savior: I would be so lost without you –
- What kind of problems, dear? -.
- Sorry, you are…? –
If I hadn’t promise to help Pansy -and an annoying System- to make Drarry became real, I would never, ever, absolutely never get up this morning. Apparently, spending the night doing secret research feels good only
- Don’t die for your stupidity, - It’s the only thing that Blaise says to me when they realize I’m not following them at the lesson. The other two share a look and shake their heads.
Aurora can't remember brat's faces for her life, so get used to it!
- Wait, - this is Ron. He seems to have finally overcome the shock. – Are we really doing this? –
I drink the tea without saying a word, hoping that drinking something real will help the situation to make sense. It doesn’t.
- You talked about a talisman to protect your bright soul, so I made one for you -.
- Pansy’s still eating, - I reassure her.
- What are you doing here in the middle of the night? –
I sigh: he really can’t remain in silence for more than ten seconds, can he?
Ugh, her fake worried voice. It gives me chills. And her pinky clothes? My poor eyes…
“Oh! That’s why he was familiar!”
Aurora can't understand why others would worry about her, firts lessons and a lot of troubles planning!
More Ginny and Luna next chapter, and Draco finally realizing he has a crush on Harry! And of course, troubles and experiments!
We finally arrive at the castle. I can’t stand this tense atmosphere of stares and silent conversations. Luna seems very relaxed, reading The Quibbler upside down. I find myself smiling at her.
- What the fuck?! – I can’t stop me from saying.
Red straight hair, pale skin, tall… Oh God. It’s Ginny Weasley.
Yep, I like this idea. Also, I have some good troubles I can finally start to do here without punishments if my exercises with magic keep this way! I’ll finally have some fun!
- Yes? – I smile as I’m not feeling deadly embarrassed.
I wink at Hermione, who answer with her best frown.
- How can you not even try to pay attention to the lesson? – Pansy scolds me while I’m putting my things back in my bag.
But… maybe we could learn how to do spells without wands and spells! Before studying here at Hogwarts, children often use magic without either wands or spells! It’s instinctive! But once studying here we learn how to not do this, and that is good for control, but probably hold back other powerful possibilities!
“System, is there a way to avoid this conversation?”
- We have a very important meeting with Hermione and Ron, - she affirms. – Don’t tell me you forgot! –
I share a significant look with Ginny, who seems angry as I am.
- You can see them, - Luna breaths slowly. – They like you –
- Oh, so the chocolate muffin of the morning banquet will be mine! Good to know! –
- I just… - Hermione blink a couple of times and clear her throat too. – I just wanted to tell you I will talk to Ron, don’t worry, we will help you –
This isn’t possible, right? This is absolutely impossible; this is a vivid dream… in a vivid train… That seems exactly the Hogwarts Express… with two brown eyes that are staring at me.
“What can I do with the points?”
Once I’m sure I’m not gonna die, I get up. It’s late, and if someone catches me out of the dormitory, I’ll be punished… but only if they catch me!
- Mister Bletchley, let Miss Reckless go and follow me to the head office -. McGonagall seems livid. Her voice is like ice. I’m loving her every moment more!
- Oh no, - I sit. – You have the faces of an incoming serious conversation –
And that’s how we end up sharing our pain of witnessing years of pining from both sides.
I roll my eyes.
A just produce another painful moan and close my eyes.
I blinked. It’s Blaise. – We were just joking, we know you hate it –
- Don’t! Not you too! Half-blood and traitor just told me they give up, you can’t leave me too! –
Well, it didn’t happen, so I can freely stop thinking about it.
- You’re avoiding me, - he hisses.
I prepare my best ice glare for them, ready to make them…
Wait, what?
Oh, I forgot I have the habit to scratch it while I’m thinking!
Ginny doesn’t ask further questions, but she steps closer to me. She doesn’t smile, but I can feel her will to make me feel better. I end up smiling.
I tilt my head to Ginny, the one smiling.
She glares at me for some moments, sigh and keep talking about the lesson. I breath again and quick copy the other schemes she wrote. I try, really really hard, to follow the rest of the lesson, but it’s clearly impossible. I zone out every second. It’s not my fault if I work better at practice and experiments! How other people just understand when it’s only in theory! I have to see, to feel how it works, to understand it!
I open my Transfiguration’s book, find the pages about the magic used to living being, and start.
This seems to make Miles finally shut up. – What… But… - and he can’t say anything after it.
- I… -
- And you realized it all alone? Congratulation, I didn’t imagine you were able to think! –
- Help you with what? –
- Could you stop calling her halfblood? – Ron says. – It’s an insult! –
- Death, boredom and no will to live, - it’s Pansy’s answer.
When Harry and Ron are walking in front of the door of the empty class we chose, Pansy “accidentally” stumbles trying to reach Draco and fall on Ron, who fall on Harry, who falls on the door that is, look at the coincidence, open. We hear him fall in the ground with a painful moan.
- You got ink on your nose, - she comments.
Professor is waiting for me in the office with a severe posture and a severe but worried look. Ouch. This meeting is already going bad.
We talk and eat for at least two hours. I spend this time trying to understand how they really are. I mean, they’re supposed to be my best friends, but apart from my passion for Draco as a character, I have no idea how they are in real life.
- That’s a good idea! – I smile, excited. – I have some ideas I wanted to do from centuries… -
- Infirmary, - Draco orders. – Now –
- Listen, now, because I don’t like to touch the garbage more than the necessary time, - I start, as if I didn’t even heard him.
She dedicates me her best ice glare.
- What the hell! – Hermione violently take off her arm from my hand.
I hide a yawn. And I thought theory of magic would be interesting… I wonder if there are lessons that explain why the first witches and wizards decided to use magic wands and didn’t try other paths. In the Harry Potter books all the wands are done by magic components… And the right wands is the one that enter in syntony with the magic user and his magic…
The grip on my wrist seems to only get worse.
- We’re not going to tell you anything, - Ron says, clenched fists. – I don’t know what your parents told you to do, but… -
- The sky, - I answer in a whisper.
- I’m sure she’s here somewhere, I’m not done with her! –
She tilts her head looking at me. – Do we know each other? –
Ok. What?!
- Anthony! –
Once she disappeared on the stairs, I turn to Ginny. – We need to buy her new shoes, - I affirm. – And make sure nobody bullies her again –
A little preoviou of next chapter!
My project is going well, I can do more and more magic without wands every day, and it’s becoming easier. It’s absolutely amazing, but I wonder if there’s a way to conserve a spell for later moments… Just an idea, I mean, do magic is cool, doing it without wands is absolutely amazing, but if there’s a way to… I don’t know, imprint the spell somewhere to be able to activate later without too much effort and focus… Maybe in danger situations it can be helpful!
- It’s nothing! – I smile again. I don’t like when people are worried! I’m used of getting hurt, this is nothing! Stop looking at me like that!
- I have taken the notes, if later you’re still alive to read them, - Blaise affirms.
Ok, now I’m starting to be tired. This drama is too ridiculous for me! I’m sorry fifth department, but please, write a better plot!
- You forgot you’re engagement three times in the last week and skipped lunch twice because you were who knows where working on your new project -. Pansy raises an eyebrow.
A familiar voice from the opposite part of the corridor interrupts Miles worm from whatever he was going to do. I turn: the pale, freckled face of Ginny Weasley is looking at me and Miles, frowning.
- Which is? – asks Pansy.
To my…? Ooohh, right, they’re death eaters.
When we go back to the castle, I can’t help but feeling a little disappointed. I know, logically, that I have to go to the lessons – I may have skipped too much afternoon lessons from the beginning of the year… - but every ink of myself wants to stay in the forest, with Ginny and Luna and the thestrals, in peace.
- You’re ridiculous -. This is Pansy, and I can’t agree more.
- If he stop being an idiot, it’s okay, - it’s my answer. Then I turn and get out the secret passage. The entrance hall is empty, all the students must have already left to go the lessons and Pansy must be somewhere disposing the anger.
What? Aurora? Causing troubles? How can you say that?!
If you don't feel too sick by how ridicoulus is this story, leave a comment!
More angry shouts.
“Look at what amazing review I’ll leave to your fifth department…”
- Me? – I put a hand on my hearth. – Weasley’s girl, you hurt me! –
The System chooses this moment to annoy me. Let me have a peaceful breakfast!
Once she’s not watching at us, I glance at Draco with a grin. – Who was the one who couldn’t make it? –
Pansy and Aurora team up with Ron and Hermione, funny past memories happen (see the title). Luna is back! Because I love her and I can't not write her! Umbridge is here to! Yeeeeeh. And of course, OC/Ginny, even if we're still at the beginning of a long travel... (It will be so fun to write...)
Lune sits next to me, staring with wide eyes. – Really? –
