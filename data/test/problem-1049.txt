"Don't kill them yet, Wormtail. The Captain wants them on deck alive. But a little bit of torture is never wrong.", he explained calmly, eyeing the Lord with a mischievous grin on his lips. In the darkness he could barely make out the bobbing Adam's apple of the man, while he lifted his hands to his head, admitting defeat. For the blink of an eye, the starling silver eyes of Mr. Malfoy moved to a closed door, but shot right back to Pettigrew, who was slowly drawing closer. All while the pirate slowly cut deeply into the other man's skin, Harry walked over to the door Lucius looked at before. Immediately the Lord tensed, hand twitching in Harry's direction. Something important was behind that door, and Harry was desperate to find out just what it was. But he waited another few minutes, for other pirates filling the room. He stayed to look out for Mrs. Malfoy, right beside her bed, waiting for her to wake up. Would he have left before, maybe the woman would have woken up and tried something stupid. So only when she woke up and other crewmembers held her at gun- or rather sword- point, Harry moved to the door. His crewmembers were by now laughing loudly at the couple, insulting them and some threats were leaving their lips. Some were even saying dirty things to Mrs. Malfoy, but Harry didn't worry so much about it.
There was a low chuckle at his throat, hot breath rising goose flesh on Draco's skin. "No plan, mon amour. You just looked so beautiful I had to 'old you, kiss you.", with those words, he placed a few more kisses on Draco's throat, open mouthed and wet.
"May I kiss you?", he whispered, eyes locked with those of Draco. Images of violent customers came to his mind, forcing him to kiss or do even more disgraceful things. And here Harry was, asking for permission to give him his first real kiss. The smile on Draco's lips didn't leave as he nodded and soon felt lips on his, moving delicately with his own. The gagging sound of Teddy was fully ignored as they both were in their own perfect world for a few seconds, lips moving with each other. The rough stubble on Harry's chin felt delicious on Draco's soft skin, the feeling of safety spreading to every cell of his body. When they drew apart, Harry's hands lingered a little bit longer on Draco's back as they needed and the blonde's fingers traced the outlines of Harry's hard jaw line. Butterflies erupted in Draco's stomache with a few minutes delay, making him all fuzzy and giggly.
"Reiman should really consider to buy an owl with more patience.", he said out loud to himself, before picking up the letter. The St. Mungo's stamp was clearly visible on the front, imprinted into red wax. Harry broke the seal and opened the envelope, only to find a long letter about how he couldn't leave without the boss knowing and how much trouble he caused with his actions. Still, he didn't want to see him personally, so Harry just let it slide for today. He wouldn't go in until the next morning, so he decided that he should get some important things over with. First off, he had to pay Kingsley a visit. He had to find out who the guy was that had done these horrible things to Malfoy. Apart from the fact that Malfoy couldn't talk and therefore couldn't tell him the name of the guard, he decided it was best to give his patient some more time to recover, before pushing him into memories he surely wanted to forget. Imagine being locked into a room with no sign of light, sentenced for the rest of your life. There's no hope of getting out. And the only person who might keep you sane in these times, especially with the medical condition you were already in, abuses you in the most horrific ways a human mind can imagine.
With his head held high the healer entered the horrifying building. There was a glimmer in his eyes, a glimmer only war veterans had upon facing yet another danger. After passing through a dark entry hall, enlighted by candles on the walls and a larger dirty chandelier hanging from the ceiling, Harry found himself at a reception. An old woman with silver hair and very prominent cheekbones looked up at the presence. She had the same dead eyes as the two Ministry blokes, soulless might be the best word for the expression. The healer couldn't imagine why anyone would work here without being forced to. The place was death itself. Without greeting or a smile, not like the receptionist at the hospital, who greeted everybody with a bright smile and polite welcome, the woman handed him a permission and a little bracelet made out of green wool. There was a little metallic pendant hanging from it with the symbol of healers.
Their steps echoed through the stonewalls, as door after door flew by. There were numbers on each door, engraved in a metal plate. Only a small slide allowed food to be pushed inside and another allowed wards to look inside the cells. Behind one of these could be Lucius... creepy.
"Can you tell me your name?", he asked, but when the answer didn't seem to come he added. "My name is Harry. You have nothing to be afraid of, I promise."
"Zeberus Bradshaw. He was the main guard in Mister Malfoy's district. Would you like his address, Healer Potter?", Robards asked, knowingly ignoring the rules by giving Harry the chance to get the revenge himself. The Healer couldn't have been more grateful for anyone disregarding the law.
A stunned whisper once again went through the room, every pair of eyes glued to the head of brand. But the elderly man only toasted into Harry's direction from where he sat on his chair, a smile on his face. "Noble words, Mister Potter. I'll drink to that."
Harry smirked at his boss with twinkling eyes, aware of the way he eyed up Draco. "Good evening gentlemen. I would like to introduce you all to my date, Draco."
The unnerving green eyes of Mister Rich Guy looked up to Draco through thick black eyelashes, immediately causing a feeling of being the prey in Draco. The small smile on the raven's lips countered it though. "Have you seen yourself? You are probably the most angelic person I have ever seen and you are standing halfway naked in my hallway."
"Damn, Potter. What an entrance. When did you get so fucking sexy?", the tall man asked, dark brown eyes twinkling in amusement and flirtiness. The groan escaping Harry's lips could have been assaulting to anyone else, but the man only barked out a laugh and shook his head. "Got it. I guess you need the Weasel for a drink. Go on, I take care of the paperwork."
Of course Draco was fluent enough in French to understand Harry said just that, additionally calling Draco 'a very magnificent guy', which lead the blonde to believe his opponent was, indeed, as gay as he would entitle himself. Lord have mercy.
"Padfoot, why are you trying to scare my date?", he asked quickly, big grin on his lips as he tried to walk around the growling beast. Draco, being immensely afraid of dogs larger than a purse, hid completely behind his date, only peeping over the broad shoulder to see if the dog would attack.
The darkness of the night was consuming everything, the furniture, the walls, the floor, the people lying in their beds, even people that are as white as snow and even the outlines of an old clock on the wall. What the darkness couldn't consume whatsoever, was the ticking of said clock, which echoed freely through the walls of the house. Another thing the darkness couldn't consume was the sound of loud rustling of wind, combined with strong snow falling to the icy grounds of London.
The blonde complied, taking the strong hand into his as he was pulled into a strong chest. From one moment to another, he was face to face with Harry, their noses almost touching as green eyes stared deeply into silver one's. A breath caught in Draco's lungs, he wasn't prepared for such a sudden change from laughing to tension in a matter of seconds! Though as he felt the warm breath of the smaller man against his lips, he didn't feel like complaining that much anymore.
Harry was silent for a few seconds, before eventually looking straight into Draco's eyes. "Be my date."
"You are quite scary when people you care about are in danger. But I never saw you like this when Ron was injured."
A flare of panic crossed Draco's features, undeniably a result of Harry's proposal. An understandable reaction, Harry would have been panicked in Draco's situation as well. Still, the Healer wasn't one to give up on the chance of some bonding time with his possible crush that easily. He might have been one to rapidly get scared by any sort of interaction with people he found even mildly interesting, but with Draco being in his current state, Harry felt responsible to show Draco the attraction he felt towards him. Even though he might not find himself appealing at the moment.
He couldn't take it. With much more force than neccessary, Draco pushed away his blanket and made his way over to his closet. The black cabinet held memories he held dearly. He remembered the exact moment Harry opened the door. Back then, he was scared for his life. He thought that he was there to kill him. Funny thing, Harry was now the only source keeping him alive. The blond Lord often felt like a drowning boy, his only hope being the surface of water. It was so close, but he couldn't reach it without help. Freedom, life. He couldn't reach it without Harry.
Maybe Draco was uncomfortable with their close proximity? Even though Harry thought they have already sorted that out, he tried and move away from Draco a few inches. After all, people's minds did change about stuff like that. He wouldn't be surprised if Malfoy was uncomfortable with him all of a sudden.
The sound of hard heels clicking on the polished hardwood floor of his room made Draco look up to find his beautiful mother Narcissa striding over to him, elegant as ever. The small crows feet on either side of her grey eyes only underlined her fine aging, a woman as magnificent in older age as she had been as a girl. Draco couldn't help but tell her exactly that, how stunning she still looked in her forest green robes, her hair artfully draped over her shoulder. The responsive smile he received pushed the young man to his feet, his arms carefully moving around the slender frame of his mother.
"You came.", he whispered, tracing his fingertips over the high cheekbones of the man he loved from the bottom of his heart.
The twinkling in Malfoy's eyes was reason enough for Harry to not take his usually intimidating stare too personal. Actually, the blond looked something between amused and proud. "Stop the scowl, princess. You are prettier without it.", Harry teased, patting the other's cheek and moving them back into cuddle position. Sadly, it caused him to oversee the pink color creeping up Draco's neck as well as the giddy smile on his lips.
Even though Draco was not so sure about Harry's words, he complied and followed the apparent fashion designer into the changing room. There was enough room for three people to change, so Draco didn't feel too closed in. Harry opened the buttons of the suit, revealing the artful corset underneath which, again, made Draco catch his breath. He could now see that the grey pattern was embroidered with black petals, held together by equally black cords in the back. Draco wasn't able to say anything, he just let Harry dress him in the silky shirt, let him carefully lace the corset and button up the jacket of his suit. The fingers touching him through the fine material sent a shockwave through his body every time. The corset made his waist tinier than that of a woman, made him look delicate and elegant. Everything fit like it was made just for him, hugging his features gently and giving Draco a feeling of secureness. A mirror on the wall opposite to Draco made it possible for him to look over the suit himself. He wasn't disappointed. His silver eyes shone through the material of the suit like mercury, the corset gave him the oh so desired hourglass figure and the suit made his limbs look long and elegant. Never in his entire life did Draco feel like he did right then, emotions overthrowing the professionalism in a matter of seconds. Tears slipped over his cheeks, leaving shimmering traces on his pale cheeks. Harry had a look of concern on his face as he carefully wiped them away, his hands lingering on either side of Draco's face.
"Minister! May I join you for a second?", he called out to get their attention. All of them looked up, surprised enough to see Harry Potter in the Ministry. Harry detested this place, one reason why he decided against being an Auror. Still, the Wizardng World loved him and so did Shacklebolt. So he wasn't all too shocked when they all nodded eagerly, holding the door open for him. He entered with a small smile, head now held high enough so everyone could see his face. He liked to hide from reporters, but he was proud of who he became.
The witch laughed at his comment, Potter was still charming as ever. He never failed to make the whole staff smile at his happy attitude, something one could rely on, since there was not a single day in five years in which he wasn't the sunshine of all the people here.
"I trried 'eeping 'im in ze room, but 'e almost crawled out of ze bed.", Angela explained, pushing Draco to the side of Harry's bed. Hermione, who sat on Harry's other side, covered her mouth with one hand and visibly fought to keep her composure.
"Harry? Are you a pirate?", he asked, voice nothing more than a shy whisper. His left eye shone with curiosity and fear.
A snort left Draco's lips, while he was raising an eyebrow arrogantly. "31. Of July. Don't you underestimate me."
"So what?! What if he was a callboy?! It wouldn't change a damn thing!", Harry yelled, pulling Draco to his side and holding him, as if he tried to protect him from the world. The feeling of safety it caused in Draco was indescribable. "I don't give a single shit what he was. I care about how he helped me out when I needed it, how he stands up for himself even though he is incredibly self-conscious. How he kept going in the worst possible world a human being could live in. These are the things that count. Not that he was forced to do a terrible job. It doesn't make him any less important than me or even Mister Johnson!"
To Draco's surprise, Harry laughed quite darkly and punched Nott square in the face. A tiny flutter rose in his chest, even though he immediately felt worry about Harry's hand. Those punches could really hurt.
The pained grimace on Harry's face was back, mixed with some embarrassment as the tips of his ears went slightly pink. "I hope he won't find out. One could think I finally have my rage under control by now. I'm not some stupid kid anymore." Merlin, he hated being so vulnerable around Draco.
Draco felt his stomach turning at her question, an angsty glimmer reaching the silver of his eyes. "To be fully honest, I have no idea. All I know is that I really like Harry and would try to be the best he ever had."
With a smile plastered to his flawless face, the young man jogged out of the alleyway and onto the busy streets he grew so fond of in his childhood. They were narrow and packed to the top with shoppers and tourists, but he knew exactly most people ignored the smaller alleys with the true Parisian bakerys and designers. So with excitement filling his moves, the blond man pushed through the crowd and into a rather deserted street. It was only enough for two people to walk side by side, but being alone now he didn't care as much as he did as a kid. Back then, his father had to push him in front of them, a thing Draco detested with him being a rather shy five year old. But remembering the bakery his parents took him to, a very small place owned by a woman which had his whole life looked like a hundred and ten, the memories got pushed to the side.
"Guess I did?", he answered. Draco was about to fire at Harry that he needed new glasses, when they were interrupted by the ringing of Harry's cellphone. The raven cursed under his breath and shot an apologetic smile at Draco before answering the call. The mien of the smaller man fell immediately, his brows furrowed in an annoyed expression.
The blonde man nodded hesitantly, as if the mere thought of admitting to his pain scared him. A small voice back in Harry's head whispered that most likely the guard who broke his ribs caused this fear in Malfoy. The strong hero-complex made Harry's hand twitch, a nervous tick when his magic was going wild. So he quickly focused back on his work, shaking off the feeling of anger.
"Dray. Dray, listen closely. You have to calm down. I know what you saw was scary, but I promise you we will fix it. I am here to help you through all of this, step by step.", he whispered into the man's ear, locking the door as he started hearing footsteps running down to them, most likely alarmed by the sudden noise of a breaking mirror. But Draco would only be more scared by more people. Harry could do nothing more than to wait. To wait and to feel utterly hopeless.
"Prisoner 7516 had a life sentence, but recent investigations have shown that he didn't commit a murder which caused the hard punishment. The rest of his crimes are cleared off by five years in here. Has been a long time since someone got out of this hellhole.", the shorter one explained slowly. There was something like guilt in his voice and terrifying seriousness at the last expression. Hellhole, yeah that's a pretty good description of this place.
"There is exactly one person that ever wound me up like that.", a sigh left Harry's lips at the thought.
"Oh mon petit dragon! You have grown into such a stunning man! Come here, let me give you a proper hug!", she cried out in a much lesser accent, seeing as she had married an English man back in her twenties. Surely one hundred years ago that was.
"Zen I... I see you at seven. There are a few croissants waiting for me in ze back.", Harry answered, a shy smile on his face as he got on his toes to place a very sweet kiss on Draco's cheek. "Au revoir.", he whispered, quickly leaving for the kitchen. Draco stood there, stunned, for several long seconds, only moving his fingers away from his cheek as Marie limped inside with two properly filled boxes of petit fours, croissants and a whole bunch of macarons.
With curiosity visible in his silver eyes Draco looked around through the restaurant, path leading to the starter buffet. All the food looked rather delicious, especially for Draco's more than empty stomach. He quickly grabbed a plate and filled it with almost everything, up until a hot breath crept up his neck. He almost let his plate fall to the floor, all the red flags in his brain were swinging like crazy.
"I am glad you two are happy to see each other... I will leave to your reunion and... get some sleep.", Harry told them sheepishly, earning a smirk from Malfoy. Even though Harry could already imagine the 'Yeah, you look dreadful, Potter', Angela decided to give the imagination a new aspect, by giggling and nodding.
Harry read the address over and over again. Something about it wasn't quite right. But he couldn't point out what it was. So, with another curt nod, he stood up from his chair and shook hands. "Thank you for your help, gentlemen. I'll inform you about the process."
"You have raised a wonderful son Mister Raves", he addressed to the two men, bowing slightly before leaving the room. There was a soft hum on his lips all the way to the Potions-Departement, making the receptionist there smile at his sight.
"We had a moment Hermione! Let us be, for fucks sake!", he complained, gesturing between him and his patient before crossing his arms over his chest.
"Sweet fuck, Potter, calm down! You will either make this building flip like a house of cards or me come into my pants like some teenage boy.", Blaise complained, eyes closed and teeth clenched. Ron groaned at the mental image his partner created, stepped closer to his best friend and pulled him into a firm hug.
"Oh sweet bloody shit! I forgot about Teddy!", Draco shouted, hand clasped over his mouth and fear roaming through his facial expression. Harry immediately grabbed the blonde's other hand, serious mien on his face.
Harry might have imagined the tension running through Malfoy's body, though it was quite foreseeable. He would have reacted the same way. Still, the Healer didn't want to distress his patient.
The puking wore Harry out to a point of exhaustion, the gagging didn't stop until a few minutes later. Then the young healer was finally able to vanish the mess with a quick flick of his wand. His knees and hands were shaking violently; he had to clean himself and eat something. He knew he had to, he just didn't know if he could. His body needed three tries to finally obey to his thoughts and stand up. The wizard stumbled into his bathroom, only to see himself in the mirror for the first time. He looked like a zombie. The dark circles were rather small after his sleep, but he was pale enough to make Malfoy look almost normal in comparison. His stubble grew a little too long for his liking and his hair was even more a bird's nest than usual.
As soon as he was sure to have everything he needed for the first day in his favorite city, Muggle money in one of those briefcases most Muggles carried around, wand secured at his hip, just beneath his shirt with a 'Notice-me-not' charm, better being safe than sorry, and a hand full of Galleons in his back pocket, which held an extendable charm, Draco apparated from their living room into a small alleyway in the heart of the city. There was already a scent of sweet baked goods in the air, mixed with that of flowers and fine wine. Oh how Draco had missed the scent of Paris.
Up on deck, Sirius talked with Narcissa about family related gossip and Lucius had a talk with Remus, obviously waiting for the boys to arrive. When they saw the two of them, everyone sobered up and Lucius silently pulled Draco to his side, disconnecting his and Harry's hand. Both of them groaned in disapproval and Harry quickly pulled Draco back to him, engulfing him in a long hug.
Draco nodded, being equally as interested in the presents as his cousin. Coming to think of it, he and Harry had to have a talk about what to do with Teddy. After all, Draco couldn't force Harry to take the role of a father for Ted. But that was a question for another time. For now, Draco and Teddy were both quite amazed about the presents the smaller blond received. There was everything, clothes, board games, school stuff, even a Playstation 5! The small boy couldn't quite understand the luck he had. He started playing with an electronic car he got, driving it through the house with loud giggles. Draco now stuffed all the wrapping in a trash bag, cleaning behind his cousin like he always did in the past. Only this time, strong hands gently took the trash bag from him, laying it to the side. Harry sat next to him on the floor, pulling a few presents that were left to them. In a horrible scribbling the silver letters read 'Draco', making it clear who they were for. The neatly green wrapping of the boxes looked elegant and nothing like those of Teddy. Apparently Harry didn't wrap these himself, but scribbled his name on them afterwards.
"You are worth the world Draco. I'll make you feel so so special, I promise.", he whispered, lips slightly touching Draco's forehead.
A stunned second passed, apparently reason enough for Harry to get nervous and quickly grab the blonde's hand. "Is zat a problème for you, chérie?", the other asked, his thumb drawing small circles on pale knuckles. Even as his voice was wavering, the body behind Draco was strong and untrembling.
Mister Johnson gave him a smile and nod, before handing Draco a glass with champagne. "I guess that's a deal then, Mister Malfoy. Glad to be working with you."
The thoughts about a present for Dobby remained prominent, even as the Malfoy heir finished dressing in very good fitting shorts, which made his legs look impossibly long, and a fitting green t-shirt to not leave him sweating in the unforgiving July sun. His father would have been horrified at the casual wear his son mostly chose to present himself in since he got older, but the older Malfoy carefully kept his mouth shut as Narcissa absolutely loved her son's change of style in comparison to his father. Lucius would never leave the house in anything less but a button down shirt and dress pants, but even that was a rare thing. The three piece suit was dressing of choice. Even when there was nothing more planned than a walk down the Seine, Draco wasn't surprised to see his father in a startling white suit with silver tie. As always, Lucius kept his expression carefully blank when bidding his son goodbye, but there still was a warmth to his eyes only Draco could differ. The boy hugged his mother once more, a brief kiss to her cheek before they apparated away, leaving Draco to smile to himself for a second. He loved his family.
"Come on Draco. I'll give you some of my clothes to wear, before you freeze to death. It's cold in these wet things.", Harry added and pulled the boy up a few stairs and into his cabin, right next to the Captain's and Remus'. Again, curiosity seemingly overcame the fear in the blond boy, as he looked around in the cabin with big eyes. The room wasn't very big, only enough space for a simple bed and a wardrobe, right next to a small table with a lantern on it. Everything was moving lightly from the waves, something most people found rather annoying, but to Harry, it was soothing. Harry swiftly opened the cabinet, which was filled with self-made shirts and trousers. They were nothing spectacular, only for practical reasons. Some were already ripped at the ends, due to none of the men on this ship really having the ability to sew lasting clothes. But for his temporal guest, Harry decided to pull out his best clothes. His mother made them for him shortly before she was murdered and he wore them to their funeral. Now they were getting to small, so Draco should be alright with them. Harry held them out for the smaller boy with a smile.
"I am so glad we came here, mother. It will surely be an extravagant vacation, just how we both like it."
Narcissa Malfoy now looked at Harry, a grateful expression on her face. "Thank you.", she whispered under her breath, relief audible in every word. Harry gave a curt nod and walked into the other room. The other boy had crawled out of the closet and now sat on the edge of his bed, bare feet on the cold ground. He had his arms wrapped around himself in an attempt to fight the shaking from his worn out body, weak from all the crying. The pirate held out a hand to the boy and smiled sadly. "Come on. Your parents are waiting.", he whispered softly. The boy slowly took the offered hand and carefully tip toed over to the door. At the sight of his parents he let go of Harry's hand and ran over to his parents, crying in relief when they hugged him tightly to their chests. Remus frowned at the picture, obvious discomfort playing on his features. By now, Harry knew it was guilt. Remus loved children, he had been a teacher before Sirius, Peter and, to everyone's surprise, Harry started their little rampage. Sirius always had been a pirate, but he got Captain only some months ago, when the other Captain died and made him his follower. Peter joined Sirius after seeing the amount of gold he could get and possibly because he enjoyed the power he had over other people way too much. Remus on the other hand only joined, because he felt responsible for Harry and for Sirius. When Sirius allowed Harry to join them on the ship, Remus was forced to follow, just to look after the two stubborn, reckless boys. He was the last one being able to do so, and he took this responsibility rather serious. Therefore, he never really approved of hurting other human beings, always argued with Sirius if they needed to be killed or tortured and often got his way. But now having a child involved, he would throw a tantrum.
The moment Harry finished his explanation with another wave of magic, finally knocking Ron to the ground and receiving a pained
The streets of his little town were filled as always, but people weren't chatting as much as usual. Most of them were all looking into the same direction, somewhere down the marketplace. Loud shouts and noises came from there, something rather unusual for the peaceful and boring town. Curiosity always hit Draco in situations like these. With swift movements he made his way through the crowd of people, right to the scene on the market. A big circle had formed around a group of six people, three of them being obviously police-officers. They tried to keep another three people at bay, which all looked somewhat out of place. There was a woman with hip-long curly brown hair, a man with orange or red hair and the third was out of Draco's vision. Based on the long cutlasses and pistols dangling from their belts, they could only be pirates. Nobody else wore those weapons around here without a uniform. Draco's small heart skipped more than one beat at the immediate connection his brain made. But he didn't want to get his hopes up just yet. He never saw these two on the ship back then, so he could be mistaken and they were just some random pirates. If he could only see the third guy. Frustration built within him as he moved around in the circle to get a better view, but he was hidden from every side. A silent scream echoed through Draco's mind, he had to know!
@Lillyfox5522 so here is the first chapter with Angela! Her last name translates to 'noble' (at least if google is right) and I hope it's alright that I made her French! Thanks for reading and commenting :)
Right after leaving family Rave, Harry found himself at an emergency meeting in one of their break rooms. The whole staff was gathered in there, all in a circle in front of two workers of the Ministry. They looked rather displeased, a frown covering their faces. Harry didn't know them, but from the fallen in eyes and haunted look on their faces, he was almost sure they had to do something with Azkaban. Those lifeless eyes could only be born inside these walls, Harry was sure of that.
Malfoy sent a death glare into his reaction, one of those combined with a full on sneer. Oh, how Harry had missed their bickering.
"Jesus Christ. This is the most beautiful piece of clothing I have ever seen.", he whispered, stalking nearer to the literal piece of art. He wanted to touch it, but was afraid to destroy it at the same time. Harry joined Draco with a subtle smile, chasing the expression on the taller one's face.
"You came to see me? Pray tell, is Draco Malfoy concerned about Harry Potter's well-being?", Harry teased, his eyebrows wriggling in anticipation.
"Don't be afraid. I won't let you fall.", he whispered into his ear, blond locks tickling his cheek. The younger boy nodded slowly, before walking over the plank with baby steps. His knees were visibly shaking. Harry couldn't hold it against him. The sea was indeed scary. He only didn't care since he didn't have anything to lose anymore. If the sea decided it was time for him to leave, he wouldn't have a reason to fight. But Draco had something to lose. His father, his mother. A whole life full of opportunities.
The following small talk was rather uninteresting, Draco only understood half of the stuff they were saying, so he decided to look around the place and maybe the buffet. He whispered said plan into Harry's ear, who nodded with a caring smile. "Have fun, darling. We are at the big table when dinner begins.", he whispered back, squeezing Draco's side lovingly. A stupid grin formed on the blonde's lips as soon as he turned around. Maybe he
Never in a million years Harry would have imagined a situation in which he consoled Malfoy by holding him in his arms while an obviously psychotic person stared at them through the window. Now that he
What he saw though, made his heartbeat stop for a second and then going absolute apeshit. Blond tangled hair came into view with worried silver eyes behind them, looking directly into Harry's as soon as they could. Draco was being pushed into Harry's room in a wheelchair by Angela, the woman visiting him beforehand. Harry sat up at the sight, causing another painful stab behind his eyelids.
"I'll take it as a compliment.", he moved around on his chair once again and started the motor. "It's Harry, by the way."
"You, Sir, are wasting my time! I need to work, god dammit! I need money, if you haven't already realized,
Harry had to use all of his willpower to hold his tears back when he grabbed Malfoy's face with both hands, locking eyes like he always did in these situations. With his thumbs he wiped away the stains of tears on high, pale cheekbones. "It's okay Malfoy. Look into my eyes. Great great. You're doing great.", he moved Malfoy's hand to his chest, right above his heart, "Concentrate on me. You listen to my voice, do exactly as I say. Can you do that?" A shaky nod came from Malfoy, one fist clenching into the blanket and the other grabbed Harry's blue robes tightly. "Perfect. We will breath together, okay? You have to breath deep and slow. Now, in.", Harry instructed, breathing in through his nose right after the words left his mouth. Malfoy copied it with great effort, his bright silver eyes pleading wordless to make it stop. "And out."
Draco fidgeted a little bit and held onto Harry's hand a little stronger. With an unsure expression he looked back at his parents and then back to Harry.
A sigh escaped his lips as he pulled out a robe, a linen shirt and simple brown trousers. Enough to get out of the house without further notice. The hood of his robe hid his face well enough, so nobody would stop and stare at him. After dressing up, he quickly rushed out of the house, making as good as no sounds. In his left pocket he still had Harry's dagger, something he forgot to gave him back when they parted. Whenever he went outside, the dagger was with him, so he could keep it safe until Harry returned.
Both, Draco and Harry laid perfectly still until, finally, the guy looked to the door behind him, back to Harry with a stare holding the certain message of it not being over just like that, and back to the door as soon as Ron kicked in the door and casted a body-binding charm on Zeberus. What a fucking name. Who in their right mind would give their kid a name inspired by the Greek hellhound Cerberus. Wasn't it enough to have one of those at Hogwarts? What a fucking irony that Fluffy actually hasn't been as scary as this monster right over the street.
The water got too hot, as if telling Harry not to think too much about this. He stepped to the side, turning the water completely cold and stepped back into it. The now cold water felt like no triple espresso could. He felt his lungs filling with more air, his brain and muscles waking up immediately. With no other thoughts on his mind Harry washed himself under the cold water, rubbing his orange and cinnamon scented shampoo deep into his curls. Probably the scent was a women's shampoo. But Harry committed to the fact that he loved women's products a good while ago. Shampoos shouldn't have labels. It smelled better than the 'leather-wood' scented one he saw at the store a few weeks ago. And he probably couldn't live without the hundreds of body lotions anymore, his hands were getting so dried out from all the disinfectant.
The other looked stunned for a second, then threw Draco another of those brilliant smiles. "Sept heures? I could pick you up wiz my moto.", Harry proposed, his eyes the definition of a hopeful puppy.
Muscle memory did most of the job when Harry moved the upper side of the bed so Malfoy was sitting upright and he accioed a paper bag, his brain was mostly in shock all the time. Panic attacks always got to Harry, the helplessness in people's eyes and knowing they couldn't stop it without help. The black haired male wondered how often Malfoy must have lived through these attacks until he passed out, all alone in the dark, nobody there to care.
"Are you feeling any better?", Harry asked in a whisper, drawing circles with his thumb on the blonde's hand. He received a tired nod as an answer, but Malfoy retrieved the hand Harry was holding to wrap his arms around himself. Surely the young man was cold, being so extremely underweight often meant that coldness got to them very easily. So Harry carefully stood up to get into professional mode again, shutting down all the awkwardness that would come with his following question. "Would you like to take a bath? You'll feel cleaner afterwards and it's nice and hot."
"I look... good. Like I am worth something.", a shaky laugh escaped Draco's mouth. "That's the first time in my life that I feel like more than a cheap whore."
"I don't think I can sleep tonight after seeing this... who is he?", she whispered, stepping closer with frightened eyes. Something about this terrifying figure felt familiar, but she couldn't pinpoint what it was.
The blonde almost thought he wouldn't take it, but eventually Harry's boss shook his hand with a firm grip. "Mister Johnson. The pleasure is fully on my side, Mister...?"
Now it was Harry's turn to choke out a laugh, a very loud but melodic one, giving Draco reason to feel warm around his chest. Heavens, the man had already fucked Draco up.
Draco snorted, rather unclassy, as he tried to stifle another laughter, before he continued. "Oh he told my father the grey suit made him look like a blown up rhinoceros and with the hair he should try on my mother's dress, he would surely make a great figure in it."
Draco had his arms crossed over his chest, a small grin tugging at his lips. "Draco." Harry gave a small smile and a nod, accepting the unspoken apology with it and driving the rest of the way to his house in the forests outside of London. The house had two floors, most walls made out of glass. You could already look inside of the building and make out a kitchen, living room and a bedroom on the top floor. Everything was rather open and flooded with light.
The silence following Harry's accusation could have been mistaken for the deadly silence a funeral usually held. The stares of the men were blank, each one in their own world of thoughts and imaginations. Kingsley was the first to make a sound, a clearing of throat, followed by a serious gaze into Robards' direction. The other man gave a small, distracted nod, before taking out his wand and casting a corporal Patronus. The silvery-blue silhouette of a Rottweiler soon ran off with a message of its' caster. Harry wasn't able to fully understand what message Robards sent off, but from what he understood, Robards sent for someone to bring him the logs of the guards positioned in Azkaban. The warm feeling of relief overcame Harry, soon enough causing his posture to slump and a breath he wasn't holding on purpose to leave his lungs. Kingsley stood up and walked around his desk to Harry, a guilty expression on his face.
At these words the boy sniffed and shifted slightly, looking at Harry with an unsure expression, but eventually he spoke. "Draco."
There was a moment where silver eyes just looked into emerald ones, up until Malfoy carefully moved his head to rest against Harry's chest. His hand still clung to the light blue robes, but the small action of trust sent a rush of ecstasy throughout his body. "Make the best of the moment you live in and don't worry too much about the future.", an advice Remus left Harry whenever he was close to a full moon. "The future is not planned yet, you yourself have the power to change whatever obstacle you might see when you live the moment in the best way possible." With that in mind, Harry pushed aside all of the thoughts concerning 'after Malfoy is healed' and concentrated on 'how can I help Malfoy the best right here and now'. He carried Malfoy into the big bathroom connected to the main room and sat him on a small chair, placed there to help the Healers with their tasks in cleaning a patient properly. The bathtub was formed so a person could sit upright and lay their head back on a small sink, where their hair was washed. It looked somewhat like a sink at a hairdresser's saloon, connected to a weird looking bathtub. But charms made the whole thing very comfortable, the hard material of the bathtub was charmed to feel like a big chair and the sink felt like a pillow, so it was ultimately perfect to relax and calm down.
Harry quickly managed to win the upper hand, straddling Nott and punching him rapidly in the face. A feeling of satisfaction spread through Draco through every punch, nevertheless, he grabbed Harry's hands and held them away from Nott's face.
It took exactly one hour, 54 minutes and 47 seconds for Draco to calm down. Harry knew, because he started counting with the older one as a distraction to get Draco's mind back to normal. After fifteen minutes, Harry thought he was talking to thin air, until he realized Draco was squeezing his hand a little bit with every number, signaling Harry that he counted with him. Somehow, the whole situation felt incredibly intimate. Having Draco in his arms, with the intention of calming him down from a panic attack, chest fully against his back, low whispers ordering him to do this and that. When Draco's heartbeat slowly got back to normal, almost beating in union with Harry's, there were no more sounds than silent sobbing and the frantic calls of Hermione outside the door. Second Harry pointedly ignored, caring more about Draco's wellbeing than anything his friend might want to ask.
"You know, reliving all what I saw these past days got me really fucked up. I thought after dying once and coming back to life
"Hey, buddy? You don't have to be afraid, I won't hurt you. Look, I have your teddy?", he whispered, ignoring the loud laughs of his crew just next door. The boy was obviously scared, so he tried to appear as friendly as possible. When the boy actually looked up rather fearfully and met Harry's gaze, the older boy's heart stopped for a moment. The small boy had mesmerizing porcelain skin, faintly lit by the moonlight shining through an open window. He was so pale, his father looked rather tained in comparison. But what really caught Harry's attention, were the boys eyes. His left eye was startling silver, much like his father's, but with a hint of the Black's grey color, for his mother being a Black. His iris was almost filled with black, due to the darkness of the room, but the color was not to be missed. His right eye on the other hand, was milky blue, the black dot in the middle was glazed over. It didn't hold the same fear as his left one and it was barely looking in the same direction as his silver eye. Harry quickly figured out that he must be blind on the right side, what created the startling contrast of silvery-black and milky-blue-white. He would have told the boy how utterly beautiful it was, but he couldn't because those mesmerizing eyes were filled with ever flowing tears. An almost undefeatable feeling filled Harry's stomach, an urge to wipe those tears away and hold the boy in his arms. Instead, he gave the best smile he could manage and gave the boy his little companion, happy to see that the boy calmed down a little bit.
"So, what is it mate?", the redhead asked, strong arms crossed in front of his chest and eyebrows furrowed. Harry would have been afraid, if it wasn't for this deadly headache...
"Do you... have a weapon?", he whispered really quietly. A smile formed on Harry's lips, the small boy was a curious little one after all. From underneath his linen shirt he drew his small dagger, a gift from Sirius when he joined the crew. Stories were told it was an old Caribbean dagger, the handle out of pure gold and the blade of silver. To prevent it from cutting into his stomach, Remus made him a leather scabbard. The pirate moved the scabbard further off the dagger, so the blade reflected the full moon above them. Draco whispered a small Wow, so Harry handed him the small weapon for further inspections.
Malfoy seemed torn between freezing into a life-size sculpture at Harry touching his naked body, bursting into flames through the heat that seemingly erupted from his cheeks and crying his heart out because he felt so incredibly vulnerable right there. Somehow none of these really sparked joy in Harry, even though first and second would have definetly given him a good laugh at school. The latter sparked memories Harry didn't want to relive. So the Healer quickly decided on engulfing his patient in stupid Small Talk, something he was fairly bad in.
The black haired male gave a lopsided smile. Then he looked at Malfoy with the softest eyes Tara ever saw. She saw the amount of emotions Harry felt about the other man, apart from being his healer. Emotions, far beyond from professional.
As a kid, Draco often had been to Paris, his second home in a way, as his ancestors had lived here and the Malfoy's still owned a beautiful small Manor just outside of the large city. Now that he was back, a tinge of nostalgia turned his exhaustion into excitement. The Eiffel Tower stood high and elegantly in the far distance, the Seine parting the packed city just enough to make a nice view from where Draco sat on his balcony. A warm breeze caught the shoulder length hair of the blond boy and ruffled it delicately, just enough to not ruin the perfect curls.
"Oh come on, Draco. The thing is made for you. I'm pretty sure you even are the angel from my dream. You will look like one of the models on the red carpet."
Draco was quite sure there was a blush creeping down his neck and to the tips of his ears. He had never been on a date in his life, especially not with someone he found as attractive as Harry. Something else was hidden in that statement Draco was sure he should have deciphered first, but somehow the thought of himself walking down the Seine with Harry on his side wouldn't leave his mind.
"Let's go to your's.", he answered finally, earning himself a dashing smile and another soft kiss to the cheek. Harry was quick to pull him out the front gates and onto to road, where a monstrous black motorcycle stold, prepared with two helmets and heavy leather jackets. Draco stared, bewildered, at the vehicle in front of himself. Seeing as Harry worked in a small bakery Draco expected one of those small mopets, not...
The police officers, Weasley and Parkinson, looked at each other and nodded. "Sounds about right. The little demon told us the same thing.", Weasley answered with a wave of his hand towards the car they came with. Soon enough, a ten year old boy ran towards Draco, a big grin on his young face. The relief on Draco's face was unmistakable as he pulled the young man into a tight hug, a growing smile playing on his lips.
"Please explain me your reason to do all this. Do I owe you something afterwards? Clean your house? Take someone out?", the blonde asked, fine eyebrow raised at the other male.
The woman laughed lightly at her son's comment, a long fingered hand caressing the pale cheek. "So am I. Though I believe you are old enough to wander around a bit by yourself. Your father and I decided on taking a stroll down the Seine, a little time for ourselves.", her melodic voice trailed off at the end, a shimmer taking over her eyes.
"Lucius, the boy is not stupid. Pirates fight all the time with only one eye. Don't treat him like a lost cause only because he isn't considered normal.", Harry responded, voice soothing as silk. Draco looked up at him with wonder in his left eye.
hurt you again. Do you understand? Ron is right outside the door, he will make sure this bastard won't come near you.
"Well, I guess I can imagine you don't want to talk about it. After all it has barely been one day ago you were sitting in that cell. But... I thought you might feel better knowing how bloody great you have done. And that I'm really fucking proud of you.", Harry rambled, the tips of his ears growing more and more crimson by the second. Draco on the other hand didn't seem to really listen. His shoulders were clenched, his fingers fisted into Harry's jumper and his breathing was ragged. The Healer couldn't make out the reason for the stiffness though. For once in his life, Harry decided to use silence to observe the whole situation. Normally, he wasn't one to just look, but obviously Draco was not in a situation to acknowledge anything that was going on. Maybe he was in pain?
"Even with that story being gruesome and unforgivable, you can't forget your own health. Harry, you are a Healer. There are people needing you. What will Malfoy think if he finds out you are here?"
@Lillyfox5522 I hope you like the design of Angela XD. I have a lot of fun writing her French accent and I hope you still understand what she is saying.
Though soon enough this particular train of thought got interrupted, as Madame Talouse limped briskly out of the door, her livid blue eyes lighting up immensely as she saw Draco.
"Don't worry Dray, I'm fine. They wanted me to do the first job and... I didn't want to. I ran away from the taxi and directly to the police. No danger at all."
"Boy, would you be kind enough to not hand my son any dangerous objects. He could hurt himself.", Lucius shot at him, clearly not amused by the action. Harry just rolled his eyes.
"I will do it.", he simply stated, crossing his arms as soon as the two Ministry guys looked him up and down. They must be thinking he was a young bloke who wanted to show off, but as soon as Harry showed them his scar, they nodded with a content expression on their faces.
"Scared, Malfoy?", he asked grinning, wiggling his eyebrows in anticipation. Malfoy mouthed 'You wish!', right to Harry's face and the latter chuckled lowly, happy that his former enemy didn't forget one of their favorite punch-up lines from old days. "Come on then. I promise I won't make it awkward."
Via shared her coworker's amused smile at Harry's very enthusiastic stories of the two childhood enemies. Of course both of them already heard some gossip from The Prophet about the animosity between the two, but first hand they were definetly more entertaining.
"Always better with you around Potter. Still no chance of getting that date I so desperately crave?", she asked, overdramatically reaching for her forehead as if she was about to faint. Both just chuckled at the question.
As fast as Harry's reflexes allowed, he tightened his grip on Draco, all the sounds rushing into his ears like a wave crushing down on him, kicking his headache off again. With his free hand Harry carefully caught those of Draco, not having a problem to hold his thin wrists both in his big hand. He could feel Draco's heartbeat and breathing against his chest, both so fast he was sure the man had another panic attack.
The crowd had mixed reactions. The loudest, but fewest, were screaming and hating on the three men. Most of the crowd though, seemed to think about the whole situation. They were staying silent. As if they were slowly starting to comprehend not everything was as important as they originally believed it was.
Warm orange light filled the cell of Draco Malfoy, coming from a small lantern right next to the two men. Harry was currently looking him up and down as a first inspection, before muttering some spells and tipping his wand at the piece of parchment. Sadly not to his surprise, the piece enlarged itself to fit all of the injuries properly, skimming from head to toe everything that was wrong.
After just fully ten minutes of break Potter rushed to the room of his next patient, the little boy with hurting wrists. The name on the parchment read 'Michael Rave', so he opened the door with his greatest smile and a soft 'Good evening, family Rave'. The parents of the boy looked up at him quickly, two men as Harry recognized. They were holding each other's hand, worry glimmering in their eyes over their son. The boy on the other hand was sitting upright on the bed, rubbing his wrists unconsciously, while looking up to Harry eagerly. Harry always loved it when he saw gay couples, for some reason he felt a huge amount of sympathy to them. All the things they probably had to go through, just for being able to love who they wanted. And seeing them here with a kid, bright as ever, genuinely made him smile.
He was right. Something has been wrong about the address of that guy. It was, in fact, right outside his fucking workplace. Maybe he even greeted this bastard on his way to work once. Maybe even right after he abused Draco like that. Merlin beware, this guy would die a bloody gruesome death.
The door swung open with a silent creaking noise and Harry entered the dark room with curiosity. A relatively large bed grazed the middle of the room, a bear carpet laying in front of it. Sharp teeth grazed the mouth of the dead animal, glass eyes staring lifeless in the direction of a small fireplace. It wasn't burning anymore, but the wood was still glowing, enough to heat the rather large room. The young pirate could make out that the bed was unmade, blanket thrown to the side and a small teddy bear was sitting on the pillow. With a small frown he walked over, taking the teddy bear in his hands and turning it, wondering who it belonged to. Nobody ever mentioned the Malfoy's having a child, but the room surely looked like it. But where was it?
buttoned up, it barely covered anything of the muscular tainted chest nor the strong arms, which were exposed by rolled up sleeves. Curly black hair covered parts of the chest, trailing down to a low waistband where an apron covered the front of blue denims. The large hands quickly rubbed flour and pieces of dough onto the apron, leaving them clean enough to serve their guest. The action caused Draco to redirect his stare from a mouthwatering chest to a quite beautiful face. Mentioned eyes were framed by thin round glasses, which reflected a bit of the midday sun which shone inside through a window on Draco's left. Messy black hair were once pulled back in a neat man-bun, but after several hours of baking they became lose and hung playfully around the black glasses. Not only did Draco's heart make a double flip at the simple beauty standing in front of him, it stuttered for several moments as said beauty threw him a dashing smile, strong hands now prepped on the counter.
"Ready to run away with me?", Harry whispered, looking shortly at the officers around them. A big grin crossed Draco's features.
"Some bastard in the Auror division.", Robards' bushy eyebrows rose a little higher, his muscled arms crossed immediately, ready to defend his coworkers. "I wouldn't insult any of your men if it wasn't true, Robards. May we sit down?"
Alarm bells rang in Harry's ears, loud and clear. A small voice whispered the number of the room it came from. Immediately Harry recognized the number to be Malfoy's room, so he ran over to the table with the potion-vials standing on it, grabbed all of those for him and ran back to the room, robes swinging behind him so dramatically, Snape would have been jealous. Once the young healer reached the door, he opened it with his elbow, somehow forgetting the possibility of magic for a second. Inside Harry placed the potions on a small table on Malfoy's right, all the while eyeing his patient with worry. The vitals showed high blood pressure and high heart rate, combined with Malfoy's ragged breathing and wide eyes, the healer knew it must be a panic attack.
"No shit, Sherlock! I was about to, but then you rudely interrupted my nap I so desperately craved."
Harry chuckled once again, hand running through blond hair as soon as he removed the helmet. "As much as I'd love to continue this.", he began, immediately earning himself a disappointed groan and he smiled to himself. "We can continue after dinner, mon amour. But I bet my papa is already stalking us zrough ze window, and I prefer to make love to you somewhere more privé, probablement at the second date?", he whispered, hand giving Draco's buttocks a short squeeze. The blonde almost yelped at the gesture as well as at the proposal, though he couldn't say he wasn't extremely excited about it. Not only about the fact he might lose his virginity, but mostly at the fact he would lose it on a summer trip at Paris with the hottest and nicest guy he could imagine. Definetly something to look forward to. Though it touched him somewhat to know Harry wouldn't sleep with him on their first date.
Not even as Madame Talouse limped back behind the counter and opened the display of sweets for Draco, his mind fully let go of that image. Though, he had to admit, the sweets did a great job at trying to distract. Only trying.
"I still... I still don't want any of your service...", he managed to stutter, probably with a blush on his cheeks. So, he was
"Draco... I don't believe you should do that. Not yet. Give yourself some time to get back to your normal self..."
Seeing Malfoy happy like this after years of fighting on the wrong side with a madman in his own home, then several years of the deadliest prison on earth (without even a good reason), and now with a smile on his face at the sight of his... friend? What exactly were these two? Were they in a relationship? Or promised to each other? Harry read in one of those thick books about pureblood-familys that Hermione was so interested in that those kinds of families often promised their children to one another so they would strengthen the family line... or something similar to those lines.
"Oh good lord, Lucius did a great job with you, didn't he? Please, call me Lily. But, you believe you are good enough for my baby?", she asked, her fine reddish eyebrow raised to her hairline.
Sometimes, Harry really hated the observations of his coworker. She never stopped to think two seconds about what her words could mean for someone else, or maybe she did and just didn't care. It wouldn't surprise him in the slightest.
"Oh how very thoughtful of you, young man!", her eyes lit up as she grabbed the flowers and buried her nose in them. "Daffodils and handmade pralines. I believe that's reason enough for you to call me Narcissa, don't you think?"
Harry was now grabbing the pen behind his ear and wrote something on a parchment, a list of all therapists who knew how to treat arthritic patients and names of Muggle medicine as well as some potions, each with price and some places to get them. He was always concentrated at work, giving his very best to make a good impact on other people's life. Soon after he finished, Via handed him the pain relieving potion and bid him goodbye, a smile still spread across her face. Now she was the one humming the song of Potter when he arrived.
The look on Draco's face was that of a fangirl first meeting her idol, the amount of pure shock and disbelief was almost comical. Never in his life was Draco so sure he did not deserve what was offered to him. "You can't be serious Harry! That's something a model would wear on the red fucking carpet! I'll ruin it!"
"Would you like to see the rest of the ship, dragon?", he asked, smiling all the while. Draco nodded eagerly, giggling at the nickname. So off they went, hand in hand out of the cabin and under deck. There were a few crewmembers down there, sharpening their cutlasses and eating a pot of soup. They looked up at the boys with minimalistic interest, but kept silent.
Silence filled the room, Draco not being able to answer and Harry not knowing what to say. The situation was weird. In their old days, Malfoy would have come up with some clever retort about him not even being afraid and all that. Times had really changed. Years ago, Harry would have rather died than letting Malfoy know he was afraid. But now, telling Draco about his fears and problems in general didn't sound too bad. Maybe the other would be a little comforted by it.
And right then, in front of the ridiculously big Christmas tree in Harry's arms with a job in clear view and his cousin next door, Draco knew. He knew he had found his knight in shining armor. And maybe, Harry even found his angel.
Harry as well as Draco woke up immediately when the soft surface of a pillow connected with their faces in the middle of the night. They sat up with so much force, their little attacker got flipped over and landed on his ass no three feet from them. Teddy started giggling like a little maniac, rolling over on both sides while holding his stomache. The two older men breathed heavily, but when the giggling bundle yelled a loud 'Its Christmas!', both of them started laughing. They grabbed both of Teddy's legs and pulled him nearer, tickling him with all force their sleepy bodies held.
"I believe he strikes several nerves and they cause something to stand upright in a matter of seconds."
"I will Crucio them. That's it, I will fucking kill somebody.", he hissed in Parseltongue, careful not to alarm the other men by threatening someone in their language. Draco looked at him with embarrassment prominent in his silver eyes. "I am not disgusted like you think Malfoy. I am disgusted that somebody can do something like that to another human being. You don't have to feel uncomfortable, I've seen worse.", he whispered reassuringly to his schoolmate.
"Ah, non. Ze day Marie dies I will be old enough to retire myself, je suis certain.", Harry answered, his eyes sparkling in amusement. "But I would be afraid aussie, if I 'ad to tell 'er to leave ze patisserie. I understand ze Death."
Another grimace of guilt took over Kingsley's features, marking his smooth shaved forehead with wrinkles. "I will make sure to repay him for my mistakes. By any chance, would I be able to apologize to him in person?"
"Sleep Malfoy. You need it.", he whispered, caressing the blond mess of hair again. Then he carefully moved his patient's head from his lap to stand up and carefully levitate the weak man.
Slowly, the blonde male got up, being dressed in a pink satin PJ Harry borrowed him, and followed his boys to the living room. No questions being answered about the origin of that particular piece of clothing. The big Christmas tree was something Draco somehow did not notice the hours he spent here already, even though he asked himself how on earth he managed that. The tree had twice the size of himself, standing tall in the left corner of the living room. Electronic candles hung in the branches, lighting up the entire room with their soft flickering glow, glass balls in mostly silver reflected the light. The cinnamon scent was overwhelming in this room, but Draco almost didn't care as he saw the gigantic pile of presents beneath the tree. Teddy already kneeled in front of them, searching for those with his name on it, while Harry started some Christmas music on one of these old gramophones. With slow steps, Draco crossed the room and pulled Harry into a tight hug. His mouth was on Harry's ear, as he danced slowly with the other man to the soft music.
" 'ealer Potter. Eet's a pleasure to meet you.", she spoke in a thick French accent, smile never fading. Harry quickly cleared his throat and smiled. "As it is to meet you, Madame Allard. We expected you a little bit later, if I'm being honest. I am not quite sure if Malfoy is already awake."
"You should think of it. Agencies would throw fists to have you for runways or photoshoots. Such a unique appearance should be cherished. Mister Potter, please talk the young man into taking some pictures for our new collection."
"Hey handsome. Up for some fun?", he asked in a flirty demeanor, eyelashes fluttering at the other. Draco realized the guy had startling green eyes, almost as green as venom or those green diamonds he forgot the name of. They gave the guy some mysterious aura. These green eyes did not quite look at him, more like behind him and his expression was concerned.
Angela giggled in her melodic voice, a polite wave of her hand in Harry's direction made it look like he made the best joke of the century. "Oh Potter, you reelly 'on't kno'? 'Is fazer could probable tell your food favorite. Ze treacle tarte? C'est correct?"
"Hey, it's alright.", Harry whispered, his hand automatically running through the wild blond hair on the older one's head. "No need to be afraid."
"Thank you, Harry. For saving me, too. You held your promise. Dad never does.", he whispered, his eyes far away, while he changed his wet clothes in front of Harry. The older boy didn't mind, under pirates it wasn't anything new.
"Harry, my boy, it's good to see you. What do we owe the pleasure.", Kingsley began, patting Harry's shoulder with a kind smile. The man had developed some wrinkles of smiling over the past years, something that gave him a really kind look. His head was still completely shaved, his robes still all purple. He didn't change all that much. Harry did. He grew an inch.
"I know Tara. He didn't deserve any of this.", Harry sighed. "I will help him okay? He didn't even kill Dumbledore... I failed on his trial. I tried to get the Ministry to give him just house arrest instead. But they wouldn't believe me for Godric's sake. Why am I Harry Potter when I can't even safe an innocent boy from a life sentence."
Harry woke up at approximately 4 pm, the sun was standing high on the summer day. A sound of soft clicking, beak against glass, made Harry aware of the fact that he forgot to open his window for potential owl-visitors. So the raven-haired man quickly jumped over to his window and let the exhausted and seemingly pretty annoyed brown owl into his room. She threw the letter on the nearest table, before hopping to the sink and looking at Harry with hate in her eyes. The young wizard only rolled his eyes and filled a small bowl with water, which the owl quickly drank from. Afterwards, she left as quickly as she probably came, not even looking back.
"Mon petit ours polaire!", she sing-sang on her way to the sleeping patient, who slowly opened one eye to look at the visitor. As soon as he realized who it was, he shot up into a sitting position and smiled brightly, arms open for a hug. The French women didn't hesitate on giving Malfoy a bone-crushing hug, a happy laugh erupting from her lips. The blonde flinched slightly at the obvious pain in his ribs, but didn't let go.
There was deadly silence in the room. Most of the people here were young healers, way too young to put themselves through so much dark energy. They would completely break at the weight of this place, of it's way to get under your skin and hunt you to the day you die. So there was not much thinking before Harry eventually shoved himself through the other healers to the front. He fought the darkest wizard of all time, died and came back to life, faced dementors multiple times and faced death as a baby. Nobody else would be better for this job than him.
"Shall I kiss your knuckles, princess, so you'll stop scowling at them.", Harry answered, voice wavering from the laugh he tried to keep in. Getting Malfoy's reaction was absolutely worth the trouble though, as the blonde smirked and quickly nodded his head yes, holding his hand out for Harry to kiss. Prat.
Footsteps echoed through the walls of endless houses, which were all set directly next to each other, giving the sounds no chance to escape into the silent night. The village was sleeping, unknowing of the danger within. Dim light of the moon marked the outer lines of the small houses, long shadows thrown underneath. Almost ghastly light was being reflected by the wet pavement, shining like diamonds in the midnight. The street moved in odd lines to the top of a hill, ending in front of a small mansion. Tension rose at the sight of the building, evil smirks forming on dirty mouths filled with rotten and golden teeth, hidden behind ugly beards. Eyes flickered with greediness, amusement, excitement at the least. A pair of emerald orbs stood out. Hatred, anger filled them, no real interest in the gold itself. Their owner had only reached the age of eleven, youngest in a crew full of criminals. He didn't carry a pike nor a cutlass like his comrades, only a small dagger hidden under his linen shirt. In his left hand he held a lockpick. All the way up the street his fingers were twitching, eager to fulfill his job. Pirates were nasty players. After losing five crewmembers at their last raid, Captain Black decided it would be best if they made use of Potter's talent on breaking locks. Now they were silent assassins, stealing and killing in the dead of night. Harry wouldn't have it any other way, he loved to see those petrified faces of rich bastards, scared for their life. He loved the begging of those who wouldn't look at him in another occasion. Nothing could ever compare to the feeling of power in those moments. The power he didn't possess when Riddle killed his parents. Before the boy got lost in his grief, another pirate dropped his cutlass low enough so the tip scraped the stone of the pavement. The sound was deafening in the otherwise silent village, Harry felt like his ears would start bleeding from the horrible sound alone. The boy gave an angry side glance to the man, but he only received an evil grin in return. Pettigrew always enjoyed molesting the boy. The fiery temper made for a good little fight. But this night, Harry ignored the older man. He was too excited to start a fight. Instead he stepped up the few stairs to the door of the mansion, lockpick at the ready. After only a minute the huge mahogany door opened with a soft click, giving entrance to a gigantic hallway. Potter smiled in triumph, lockpick quickly hidden back in his pocket. All the pirates entered, cutlasses drawn and bags already filling with artifacts standing around, jewelry, gold and paintings, everything that looked like it was of worth. The youngest pirate started to search the house with inaudible steps. Nobody would be down here, most rich people slept on the higher floors. So he decided to search up there. His right hand touched the handrail of the stairs. The polished wood sent shivers down his spine, a cold, lifeless feeling always came with these houses. He would never understand how people could live in these big mansions, more place than anyone could use. He knew Lord and Lady Malfoy lived in here, a very powerful family with loads of connections to the royal houses of England. And they were cruel, heartless and egoistic. Harry's parents, Lily J. Potter and James Potter, previously tried to befriend the family, not long before they were murdered. But the Lord turned them down, reasoning with Mr. Potters Indian descent. They didn't befriend anything apart from pure english people, anything else was below them. Maybe if they didn't turn them down, if they weren't so bloody rich, his parents would still be alive. They could have provided safety for the small family. Instead they were one of the many rich bastards who were responsible for the murder. With this reasoning he moved through the hallway, followed by Pettigrew. The man wasn't pretty good in being subtle and quiet, so Harry wasn't really surprised when Lord Malfoy awoke immediately at the sound of a creaking door. But Pettigrew was faster than the blond man, holding his cutlass to the porcelain skin of the bigger man's throat. A smile crept on Harry's lips, the fear in Lucius Malfoy's eyes positively sparking joy deep down in his very core.
Though as the woman turned and held out her hand towards Draco, piercing green eyes staring him down just like Harry's own, he felt all the thoughts slipping into nothing but nervousness. Harry's mother had a no nonsense kind of look, stern face and a presence which reminded Draco almost instantly of Professor McGonagall. His feet carried him automatically towards her, taking the smaller hand into his and giving it a firm shake. "It's a pleasure meeting you, Ma'am."
The concerned blue eyes of Ron were probably what caused Harry to lose it. His magic rushed out of him like several dams broke, letting streams of uncontrolled magic lose. The floor rattled as if an earthquake captured the Ministry's floors, causing dust to fall from the ceiling and people outside to trip and crash to the floor. In shockwaves, the magic rolled through the room, caused Ron's and Blaise' hairs to stand up all on their body and in addition made the old schoolmate groan at the sensation of the power of Harry's magic.
"Tara, I believe my personal life shouldn't be too much of a topic for you. Nevertheless, Draco knows he always strikes a certain nerve within me."
"I love it Harry. Would you help me to put it on?", Draco whispered, his eyes filled with soft love. The other nodded, carefully putting on the fine necklace. A smile lingered on both of their faces, shy and dreamy.
Dark grey to black clouds were hovering over the sky in round motions, forming a circle around the storm in the middle of it. The wind made it impossible to move against it, dragging at every body and living thing in its way. There was thin rain falling with the wind, a feeling like needles digging into your skin and ripping you apart piece by piece. The center of the storm was filled with lightning, never ending and dangerously enlightening the flying dementors beneath them. A cold feeling made its way down Harry's spine, thinking of the deathly atmosphere of the prison. Azkaban was located on a single island in the Pacific, enchanted so nobody without a permission can leave. However, the past has shown that it was indeed possible to break out, still the chances were almost zero without help. A sick feeling approached his stomache and chest, making it hard to breath. Like a huge weight was pushed on his torso as punishment. There were so many people suffering in this insane prison because of him. Maybe some of them deserved it, but surely not all of them. Definitely not all of them...
fighting the darkest wizard of our time I've seen everything there is. But I guess you taught me otherwise. What you survived is unbelievable, Draco.", he whispered, rolling the long fine strands of the other's hair around his finger. Draco shifted besides him, eyes looking far away and body still stiff. He didn't give any other reaction
"Draco?", Harry whispered, his voice trembling worse than he imagined it to. The other obviously tried to suppress a smug grin as he nodded, not looking up to Harry. But Harry knew. He always knew. "I know you wonder what happened... Why I am here and all."
"What, your moment lasted almost two hours?! We just heard something breaking and suddenly the door was locked and in here was complete silence! Someone could have murdered you! Or, more likely, you could have murdered each other!", she yelled at them, finger pointing repeatedly into Harry's chest, causing with the mix of breaking voice and tears in her eyes real guilt to flicker across the Healer's features. Sometimes he forgot to think about his best friends, he forgot they actually cared about him. That sounded quite harsh, but in the past years of their friendship, Ron and Hermione were mostly focused on each other and their careers, leaving Harry out for most of it. Not that he complained, he was focusing on his job, too. But still, he had to deal with his own problems and didn't include them altogether for most of them. Now it felt incredibly stupid to shut them out completely whenever he had something to deal with. Quite literally shutting out.
Work in St. Mungo's was ever so often exhausting and extremely tiering. Auror's bulging in with life threatening injuries, even years after the war this phenomenon wouldn't stop. Kids played pranks on their friends with horrific endings, bleeding wounds and unconscious boys or girls were part of the daily routine. After the trend of a new kind of love potion, invented by none other than George Weasley himself, the rate of parents with lovestruck children has increased drastically. The scent of different potions and even some sort of Muggle disinfectant filled the air of the bright halls, sweeping through the doors filled with recovering and fighting patients. And in the middle of it all was Harry, standing in his light blue robes with a clipboard in his hands, a pen tucked behind his ear and a cup of coffee currently meeting his lips. The shift was already too long, ten or twelve hours maybe and he craved for some sleep. But it was summer, meaning first that all the children were home with their parents, creating more accidents that were treated by St. Mungo's, instead of the schools Infirmary. Second of all, the healers with family took some weeks off to spend them at home, leaving the single-healers at only half of the staff. More patients and less healers meant working overtime almost every day of the week. Harry, being the ever so caring person he was, worked seven days a week, fifteen hours everyday.
"Well yes... I worked 24 hours straight. If you need anything call for Healer Boujettif. She is a great Healer and has my full trust."
"Theodore Nott... my... my ex-procurer.", Draco whispered, silent enough to let only Harry hear it. Theo, though, had other plans apparently.
A frown captured the man's handsome face, as he looked to his wife. "What's that supposed to mean? Padfoot loves my food."
"Malfoy?! Oh bloody Merlin... this is even worse than I thought. They... they broke somebody already shattered.", she whispered, tears stinging in her eyes. She didn't know much about the blond boy, except for the fact that he was a Death Eater at sixteen and had Voldemort living at his home. He was tortured and forced to help him kill Dumbledore. Everybody would be completely broken after all of this. And what did the light side do after winning? Not helping him, no. Sending him to prison for no reason at all.
"I'll come back for you, Draco. As soon as I can, I promise. Wait for me, okay?", he whispered into the smaller one's ear, kissing his forehead again afterwards. The blond nodded with a sad smile, but determination was written in his eyes. They shared a long last look, both of them had tears burning behind their eyelids. Harry stared into the beautifully colored eyes of the young Lord and the blond boy stared back, smiling softly before leaving the ship.
Being now awake and refreshed again, Harry intended on paying Shacklebolt a visit. His floo had a connection to the Ministry, so thankfully he didn't have to walk anywhere. The young Healer grabbed a hat to have at least something to hide behind, without dying from heat. Surely, even years after the war, his appearance at the Ministry would cause a lot of ruckus. And the hat might hide his still wet curls. At least a little bit. With a quick check that his wand was tucked at his belt, Harry took a deep breath and grabbed a handful of floo powder. He stepped into the flames and called out 'Ministry of Magic'. Harry excited the fireplace right out into a hallway with lots of floos, all gaining entrance to visitors. Reminded of an accident last year, where he stood in a fireplace too long and somebody flooed right into him, causing Harry to jump rather ungraceful out of the way, he quickly stepped out of the green flames and shook off some of the ash, before a similar event took place.
The man nodded eagerly, his lose strands bouncing wildly as he did so. He turned his head towards the kitchen to call for her. "Marie! Il y a un type très magnifique ici qui voudrait te voir!", he turned back to Draco, a bright smile on his lips. "I told 'er zere is someone to see 'er."
Harry laughed nervously, a hand rubbing the back of his neck. "Normally, I am. You make me nervous for some reason."
So, with a lopsided smile, he stood up and slung his arms beneath Draco's body, easily picking him up bridal style and moving him onto the bed with one quick motion. Harry carefully placed the other men's legs so they wouldn't be in the way, before walking around the bed and lying down next to the blond. As he was already denying some wishes of his patient, Harry was ready to test his luck and carefully move his arm beneath Draco's head, so the blond lay more comfortable and could maybe even cuddle up to Harry. Even though the way Draco's whole body went still at his action made Harry wonder, if he didn't already cross a thick line.
"F-Forget what I said Harry.", she whispered, closing her eyes for a moment. "We should leave you alone. Madame Allard, would you like a coffee?"
A chuckle escaped Draco's lips. "I can imagine worse than having fancy dinner with a date and talking about work. Sounds like holiday."
After a few deep breaths Harry splashed some cold water onto his face and washed his mouth out with mouthwash, before gulping down some water to get his body hydrated again. The trembling slightly subdued by then, enough to have a quick shower without breaking his neck. The hot water felt like heaven on his skin. Tension was leaving his body with each breath, his stiff shoulders softening with each second.
Both men looked up from their conversation as a very young, very out of breath man stumbled through the doors of the office, folders filled with parchment in his hands and glasses askew. His face heated up as he saw Harry, shy smile playing on his lips. "So sorry for the interruption. Head Auror Robards? I have the papers you ordered.", his nervous glance flashed to the Head of Aurors, before going back to Harry. The Auror sighed, taking the parchment from the man's hands.
"Let me soothe the pain from your throat first. I don't want you to live through more of this than needed.", he explained quickly and laid his wand to the side. After seconds of hesitation, Harry placed his big rough hands on the prisoner's throat, almost like this one time back in school, where he choked Malfoy for saying shit about his parents. But this touch was gentle, careful to not hurt his patient. The blond man flinched at the touch, but as soon as he felt the soothing warmth of healing magic coming from those strong hands, he relaxed into it with a look of pure pleasure in his eyes. Harry chuckled at the sight of Malfoy gaping at this strange touch, looking much like a moaning mess being choked by somebody for a completely different reason.
There were a lot of healers running around the small place, fetching everything they needed for their patients. The two potion-masters working at St. Mungo's had a hard time keeping up with all the injuries in summer, but most of the time everything worked out just right. Harry smiled at one of cauldrons, imagining Malfoy standing there in sixth year. The glances they shared, because Malfoy was so desperately trying to be better than him. He had felt so good back then, being better like Malfoy at potions, even if he cheated a little bit.
"That's what I thought. Maybe I can get you to the VIP section of the hospital, the food there is at least far better than down here.", he proposed, wiggling his eyebrows in anticipation. A strangled noise escaped Malfoy's mouth, followed by a snort. Though by his lightly shaking shoulders, Harry could make out that he was trying to laugh. But the loss of his voice was also keeping him from laughing with any sound, hence the weird sounds. But instead of taking pity on the poor boy, Harry just started on laughing loudly, deep from within his belly. He has always been a rather positive person and even though the depressing atmosphere of Azkaban shut it down momentarily, it couldn't keep him from being happy altogether. Even if it meant laughing at his patients dreadful attempts on laughing without use of his voice.
Hours later, Draco was pacing around their living room, all dressed in his newly bought outfit with his mother sitting in front of him. Narcissa watched her son in bemusement as he enlived one mental breakdown after another, questioning his life choices and communication skills more than once. As Narcissa tried to calm her nervous wreck of a son down, a satisfied smirk on her delicate lips as she realized her son was, after all, not the dominant part of this date, a melodic sound rang through the Manor, indicating the arrival of Draco's date. A terrified squeak left the blonde's lips, only receiving him an eye roll from his father, who briskly stood and strode to the door. Another surge of sudden panic caused Draco to run after Lucius, very much to his dismay, as he realized the very cold and posh demeanor of his father could easily scare the other man away. Although he didn't make it in time to open the door before his father did, he piqued over the strong shoulder to get a glimpse of Harry, who was standing not three feet away from the door, a nervous smile on his own face as he held a bouquet of flowers and a small box with what looked liked self-made pralines in his hands. His hair was pulled back neatly into that man-bun again, leaving only two curly strands to frame his face, underlining the simple black suit he wore with a white button down beneath (this time buttoned up, much to Draco's dismay).
The blonde pushed away from the car and towards the door, causing the other man to smile in delight. Harry moved to the door to open it for Draco like a true Gentleman would. The action caused Draco to shake his head with a smile, but being met with the warmth of the interior and the soft smell of orange and cinnamon, his retort melted into a relaxed sigh. His arms dropped to his sides, exposing his bare chest to the warmth. Knowing the sensitivity of his pale skin complexion, red dots would soon cover his body when adjusting to the heat. But honestly, Draco didn't care too much about his looks in that moment. His silver eyes wandered around the hallway, noticing paintings along the walls and heavy coats on a wardrobe to his right. The hallway ended in something Draco could only call a reading room, for it wasn't really a living room, despite having similarities. A red reading couch stood in the middle of the room with big bookshelves along the walls. A cold fireplace sat inviting between the shelves. More of the house wasn't really to be seen from where Draco stood, so he turned to Harry, only to find him smiling shyly at the floor. The blonde cocked an eyebrow, smirking at the other.
"Madame... I must ask you to be careful with my patient. You are hurting him.", Harry told her hesitantly. Angela immediately let go of the blonde, who looked at Harry with a thankful smile.
"Oh he is practically married to our Captain. We don't really care. One can be whatever they want, we go with it."
The blond male allowed his eyes to curiously gaze up to Harry, watching him with interest. Of course he had to stare at Harry like that. Stupid git.
"Draco?", Harry whispered, his lips only inches from the other man's, startling eyes looked at him and causing the blond to stop breathing.
The woman snorted, her long hair swinging as she shook her head. "You know you won't get an honest answer from Harry as long as you pout like that. Now go inside, I want to introduce myself to Draco.", she shooed her man inside, receiving a pained sounding 'Mais oui Mademoiselle' in response. To Draco's surprise, both of Harry's parents were rather fluid at English, not having that much of an accent at all.
It took me some time, but finally some update! I hope you enjoy, I'll continue soon, now that I have more time again!
"Auror Department.", he called out to the elevator, almost losing his footage at the immediate speed of the small cabin. As soon as the doors opened, Harry stomped out and through the corridors, ignoring the surprised mountains these men were in his way. Truly, the Auror department was a frightening place to be.
"Is that how being in love feels like?", he whispered, eyes searching the emerald greens of his opposite. Ha, he finally remembered the crystal's name.
Harry answered with a small snort, before giving Draco a careful squeeze to warn him of his following joke. "Something in the mirror must have really insulted Draco. I am pretty sure it's the hair. He almost looks like Lucius on that ugly yearbook picture."
The Raven barked out a laughter, leaning his head on the taller one's shoulder. "Maybe it goes away if we try more often?"
Draco complied with a bright smile, drawing the old woman into his arms and kissing her cheeks the way French people did. To his own surprise, the gesture didn't disgust him that much anymore by now as it had done when he had been a small boy. Something about kissing strangers just hadn't felt right to his childish mind.
Nott grabbed Draco by the back of his hair, slowly pushing him towards the exit. Something about the whole situation made Draco think of the horrible irony all of this held. For the first time in his life Draco felt like he was worth something. He was asked to model. Seconds after, the little bubble of a dream he was in got bursted by his past. Draco closed his eyes to the tears dreading to fall down his cheeks, when a warm hand curled around his waist and pulled him towards a strong body.
"Come on. Let's go to Via and get your potions. You can tell me some stories of you two on our way.", she proposed. Harry hummed in agreement, already thinking about the best stories he shared with the blond male. There were a lot, maybe starting at their first meeting? Or his favorite incident of all time, Draco the cute white ferret. After some thinking the healer decided on their funniest stories, including the ferret, a bloody chicken that (almost) killed Malfoy and a snowball fight at Hogsmeade with unfair advantages on Harry's side.
The redhead only wrinkled his nose at the conversation, but clapped his partner on the shoulder before eventually walking over to Harry. "I believe it's a day for some firewhiskey?", the man paused, eyeing his friend down for several seconds. "Merlin, Harry. You look like shit. Come on mate, we'll drink some at mine."
Harry started playing with Draco's hair again, scrunching his nose at the broken ends. As long as the Healer remembered, Malfoy has had impeccable hair. Seeing him with a mop of long, uncared for hair felt like a personal insult. "I think we should cut your hair tomorrow. It looks worse than mine. And that really has to say something."
"Potter, you truly are the only one here who can sing after a twelve hour shift.", she chuckled, shaking her head in disbelieve. Harry gave back a toothy grin, humming only a little louder in response before finally talking. "I just happen to recognize the beauty of a moment apart from the circumstances. Apart from it being the 200th time me seeing you today, how's life going Via?"
Therefore he wasn't all too surprised on how much Malfoy seemed to like his new program. Still it was a very funny sight to look at.
"You little maniac! Can't wake us in the middle of the night like that, I almost punched you square in the face.", Draco commented, still grinning to the blond boy.
Draco smiled with as much confidence as he could bring up, holding his hand out for the boss to take. "It's a pleasure meeting you, Sir."
"You boys have plans for dinner, I figure?", she asked, her eyebrows raised and gaze switching from a happy dancing Harry to a stunned staring Draco.
The blonde snorted, swinging his own leg over, a lot less elegantly than Harry. "Afraid? In your dreams."
He toasted into Draco's direction and took a sip of his champagne, Draco copying his moves. The blonde man was swelling over with pride, his smile was genuine and his body language confident.
"So here we eat and talk all together. Most of the time Moony cooks. Straight men are terrible cooks."
"Gods that was cute! Come on lads, dinner is getting cold in here and it smells too good to eat it like that!", the man announced, his big brown eyes gleaming in the low sun. Apparently, the red haired woman wasn't as hyperactive as her husband, though she did throw the boys a satisfied smirk.
give a needy sigh, his body pressing harder against Harry's, immediately receiving a response by hips rolling into his, pressing groins against one another. The blond groaned, his head falling down on a broad shoulder as his breathing catched up.
"Where exactly do you think you are bringing my man?", the deep, anger laced voice of Harry rumbled through Draco's entire body. The tears he held back came out with a loud sob. He didn't realize how afraid he was until Harry called him out of his trance. His life was never worth enough to really be afraid of death and he never did anything to bring Teddy in danger. But this could have ended in two more numbers on the yearly list of killed prostitutes. That couldn't happen, not now. Not when he finally had a chance to get his life back in track.
"My date. Come on Draco, you would save my ass. I need a date and that in less than two hours. You are the only possibility. I wouldn't feel bad to leave you back here alone and we could make some big people faint by going there together!", the excitement and mischief in Harry's voice caused a tiny little flutter in Draco's chest. He could go on a date with this really hot rich guy in front of all these rich bastards and finally feel worth something. He knew Harry would make him feel special. The raven definitely was a gentleman, a great guy in general. So, why not?
Unfortunately, Draco's hands were still caught somewhere in between Harry's chest and Draco's body after turning around in such a weird angle, so Draco had to roll over and hief himself in a sitting position on Harry's lap with his legs lying weirdly behind him, to be in a position he could take Harry's hand. The Healer really had to bite back a laugh, only intensified by Draco scowling at their joined hands. Yeah, the situation did seem a little bit off.
By now, Draco was wide awake, smiling from ear to ear, but Harry didn't quite manage to wake up. Still, he stretched and stood up, heaving Teddy over his shoulder. "Come on then Ted, Santa surely brought you some stuff."
"The guard is standing on the other side of the street, apartment in the third floor. I have the address on a piece of parchment in my coat outside. I knew something was weird about it. Ron, go and arrest him. Please. He saw Draco and from what it looks like, the guy is not quite that happy about it. I have permission from Robards to do whatever the fuck I want with him. So, please, arrest him until I can take care of it myself.", Harry explained, causing Draco's head to whip around and stare at him. Right, the part with Robards he left out. Most likely to Ron too...
The crewmembers looked as if they wanted to contradict, but after openly thinking about their cooking skills, they shrugged and nodded.
"You'll have to give me something to dress in.", Draco answered when his coughing subdued. He had to throw his hair back into place, for it having gotten out of control through his choking. The smile on Harry's face was so bright it might have blinded Draco if he wasn't fast enough to look away. The shorter male grabbed Draco by the hand, pulling him to his bedroom in the first floor. To Draco's surprise, the room wasn't only a bedroom. A big bench stood on the left side of the room, draped with all sorts of fabric and a mannequin standing to the right of it. The mannequin had the probably most beautiful suit on Draco has ever seen. It was made out of silvery fabric, soft and mat. The shirt beneath looked like white silk and the tie shone in the same silver as the suit. What Draco didn't see on his first glance, but definitely on his second, was the beautiful hand-embroidered corset, which was covering the shirt and only shone slightly through the holes of the buttons.
It did take Harry a few seconds before he realized the hidden insult. If it even was there. There was a lot of room to interpret a snort. Maybe too much room for Harry's muttered  to be appropriate, still, the other let out one of his signature smirks. It really had been his intention to give back some snide remark, even if he couldn't talk. The fact that Harry actually understood him was sort of scary.
Anger flashed through Draco's eyes, his hand almost automatically moved to the door handle to open it. Until he realized they were on the bloody motorway, nowhere near a hotel!
Tumor between two vertebrae in the lower back, blocking nerves to the legs completely, therefore paraplegic;
"You... you don't? That's okay, I'm sorry I-... I didn't want to push you too far.", Harry stammered, embarrassment raising to his cheeks and neck. But before he could really finish his sentence, Draco pulled the man closer by his hair and smashed their lips together. A relieved sigh escaped Harry's lips as he shared the most perfect, most passionate kiss ever with his newly found boyfriend. Teddy's giggling in the background and Harry's smile into the boys direction crossed out every question Draco would have had about Harry wanting to be a part of Teddy's life.
Silver eyes met emerald, Harry could almost see the wheels turning in Malfoy's head. Seconds after, which seemed far too long for somebody as intelligent as Malfoy, the blonde shook his head until his hair was again freed from his forehead. There was shame in those mercury eyes, even some fear if Harry wasn't hallucinating. It could have been some arrogance, too, Harry was still talking to Draco Malfoy after all. "Malfoy, you have to remember that I am your Healer, so I normally wash my patients. And sooner or later I will have to heal the infections at your bottom area. It would be easiest to do it now, but if you feel insecure about it, we can wait."
Harry honestly thought it was quite obvious, but instead of questioning his coworker's eyesight he simply nodded.
Harry started the water on a lukewarm temperature, not too hot to hurt the sore spots on Malfoy's skin, but hot enough to provide promised warmth. His former school nemesis eyed his actions curiously, but mostly dumbstruck. There was a sick feeling in Harry's stomach, giving him reasons to believe that Malfoy was never actually cared for. Surely Narcissa never really bathed Malfoy as a kid, maybe a house elve did? So maybe he expected a mediwitch to help. Or maybe Malfoy didn't expect him to be so caring at all? They weren't friends after all and Harry, if were in Malfoy's situation, wouldn't believe his school rival would give two shits about him. The answer had to wait, eventually, maybe until Malfoy was able to speak properly again. What a terrible long wait for so urgent questions.
"It's alright Harry.", he whispered, pulling the raven careful from the other man. Harry had a cut on his cheek and his hands were both bloody, but Nott looked way worse. His whole face was bloody, nose most likely broken and his left eye swollen so hard he could barely see. He was grunting, drained from the pain Harry caused at him. The shorter raven breathed heavily besides Draco, eyes never leaving the man on the floor. The way Harry's actions caused Draco's insides to turn and flutter, he was pretty sure he was fucked.
He didn't use a spell, however, but instead wrapped Malfoy up in his arms again, giving the blond Slytherin a form of protection and stabilization he surely missed from his days in Azkaban. Harry knew all too well from long nights with nightmares that even the biggest war hero needed a pair of arms around him to make him feel safe again.
"Excusez-moi!", she gasped, delicate hand on her mouth. Draco waved her off with a grin, head cocked to the side. The Slytherin looked genuinely happy, nothing like the scowling and sneering git Harry knew all too well. Coming to think of it, Harry rather liked the smile on the angular face of his former enemy. After all those years, he finally looked like a small boy again. Malfoy lost the innocent, child-like look somewhere in third year. He was still happy at occasions, like Harry almost getting roasted by the Hungarian Horntail, but it was fading all the time. In sixth year the young Slyhterin looked lost and depressed, Harry shall know after his obsession over this year. And, well, seventh year was truly another brand.
A snort escaped the blonde, at least he was as much of a cheeky badger as usual. The first comment though made him look to his left where Harry stood. Indeed, the Raven looked like he was watching the love of his life before him... maybe that wasn't even exaggerated? At least Harry stayed the whole time with him, risked his job for him and even started a beating. Probably seeing Draco with a child did the last thing for the smaller. The way Harry stalked nearer and pulled Draco into his arms, hands caressing his high cheekbones and pink lips spoke more than thousand words or thoughts could.
Draco formed a small smile on his lips, before nervously biting at his nails. Narcissa looked as if she was about to say something, but kept her mouth shut.
"Not at all. I was worried I would be the only inexperienced." As he answered, Draco moved back into Harry's body, immediately relaxing. Those already familiar hands rubbed up and down Draco's arms, causing the blonde to close his eyes and forget all about Harry's mother right in front of them. Though he did not overhear her bemused chuckle and how she called out to her husband that there was actually no need to worry about their date, as they were head over heels for each other. And he totally noticed how Harry's hand curled protectively around his stomach, warm lips pressing on his nape.
Draco held the dagger like it was something precious, a source of hope. Harry saw the small wheels turning in his head. Before anyone could talk again, the small group reached the ship. The Wolfstar was a rather small ship, nothing all too big. The wood was painted black, but it peeled off already, showing lighter scars beneath the paint. A crew of about twenty pirates awaited the group, in the middle Captain Black with his big hat, wild black locks reaching the small of his back and gun as well as a cutlass hung loosely at his belt. His grey eyes shone brightly in the moonlight, fixated on Lucius and Narcissa.
Harry casted a quick diagnosis charm on Draco, receiving once again a parchment with a long list of injuries. But none of them seemed to be urgent nor hurting, so this couldn't be it.
The other smiled gently, playing with one of the strands hanging loosely into his lover's eyes. "Be my boyfriend. My official boyfriend.", Harry asked, his voice filled with honesty and certitude.
As soon as Harry opened his eyes, he realized he saw absolutely nothing. The room was pitch black, the light from the hallway didn't even make it's way over the doorstep. With somewhat shaky hands the healer pulled out his wand and whispered a quiet 'Lumos'. Quiet, because he didn't want to scare whoever was in here even more than they must have already had and only a dim Lumos to not hurt the prisoners eyes. Curiosity got the best of Harry as soon as he stepped into the cell. He looked around in search of something in the room, but his eyes had to adjust to the darkness for a while. So he just held out his wand and smiled softly.
Well, most likely he was, Harry wouldn't know what Ron could possibly do for almost two hours, the arrest surely didn't last longer than thirty minutes.
"Aye. The boy is braver than his father.", Sirius agreed, glee visible in his eyes. Draco started giggling at the comment, mostly because everyone agreed with a grin. Lucius looked rather dumbfounded, obviously not expecting his son to turn on him like that.
Harry flinched slightly at the words, even though they weren't the worst of possibilities. Still, a young boy growing up with arthritis is somehow always a little bit disadvantaged.
Tara smiled sympathetically at her coworker. Potter was always the savior of everyone. And she loved the side of him, which always tried to please everyone and save even the darkest soul from pain. Once there was a very old wizard, a true homophobic, who screamed at Harry, because he didn't want to be healed by a 'faggot'. The Chosen One just smiled at the other and managed to heal some pain in his back, something nobody else managed until then. Even though he had harder circumstances by a completely uncooperative patient, he did it. The man never even wanted to let him go after. They wrote each other every Christmas, even now. Of course this big heart would be able to include a broken Draco Malfoy without second thoughts.
One long lazy blink answered his question, earning an even bigger smile from Potter. Malfoy watched the other man for several moments, before eyeing the water bottle with desperate eyes. Harry, being the observer he was, caught on immediately and helped the blond male to drink a few sips of water. The slender male practically inhaled every drop, licking them off his lips as if he was never to drink it again.
"Don't you worry Papa! Dad will never shut up if you start crying now.", he chuckled, hugging them tightly. "Thank you Monsieur Potter! Have a very nice day."
After five minutes of concentrated breathing Malfoy was finally done with his panic attack, completely sweat drenched and trembling. But he wasn't hyperventilating anymore, which was all that mattered in this moment. Harry was happy that he managed to calm his patient down without use of the paper bag, it was always the last way out. Both former enemies sat on the bed together, Malfoy in the middle, his waist covered by the white hospital blanket, Harry on his left, facing the blond male. Malfoy's hair was plastered to his bony scalp, stopping right over pointed shoulder blades.
embarrassed. This would mean payback. Lucky for Harry, the woman left, giggling her whole way down the corridor.
Just because the situation gave it away and he had to pay back Draco for his actions earlier, he gave the blonde's nipple a short twist, causing the other to soundlessly yelp. Again, watching Malfoy react to stuff in his current state was more than amusing, causing Harry to bark out a set of laughters, just like the day before.
. Harry didn't realize before, that the blond wasn't even looking at him, but outside the window. Following Draco's eyes, Harry caught sight of a man, standing on the other side of the street in a flat. A shiver ran down Harry's spine at the coldness in the man's eyes, the pure hate and bloodlust.
"You worked non-stop for 24 hours and eight of them you had your ass placed in Azkaban. Harry you need sleep!"
There was a small pause on Harry's side, but he quickly gave Draco a small squeeze. "Stay here as long as you want. I'll help you get a real job and you won't have to get back."
They stared at each other for a while then. Far in the background of a warm summer evening, a dog was howling in despair, a man was laughing and one swearing, while the sound of female laughter echoed through a dawning backyard. And as Draco finally realized the Eiffel Tower behind Harry's head, a setting sun creating a beautiful halo around black hair, it was too late to suppress his sudden smile. By any means, it was chaotic, something fell in the background and Draco felt the grass being slightly wet beneath his arse, but as he looked into emerald green eyes, steaming salmon between the two men, he couldn't help the need to finally press his lips onto Harry's. And for them, for only their moment, it was a perfect chaos, hands curling in soft hair, one body moving to sit on another one's lap, as tongues searched for another in a battle for dominance. Though they both knew who would win it...
The woman rolled her eyes expressively at the obvious lie. "Please, I have looked far better back then. My back is killing me by now as much as my leg is, hence young Harry helping me out with the harder work. The boy is a pure gift from heaven.", she threw her coworker a warm smile, turning the young man's head slightly red.
"That would he perfect. I am still rubbish at deciding those thing.", he answered sheepishly. The woman winked at him and nodded, walking back into the kitchen to fetch two of those large boxes they always got back when he went there. Then there was a moment of silence as Draco and Harry stood there, neither knowing how exactly to approach the obvious tension now laying in the air.
"So, I 'ave two possibilité for the evening. First, we could eat at a fancy restaurant at le Seine. Or, we go to my place where me and my parents 'ave cooked for a dinner outside, view on the Eiffel Tower.", Harry proposed, his lips brushing the hard knuckles of Draco's hand. There was a moment of silver finding green, of serious consideration of both possibilities. Growing up rich had always given Draco reason enough to eat at every single fancy restaurant around town. There wasn't anything quite special about it anymore. Visiting Harry's place on the other hand was quite intimate for their first date, not to mention he would immediately meet the man's parents. Though, thinking about it, it would only be fair. And a dinner outside when dawn was settling behind the Eiffel Tower... it was all quite too romantic to say no.
"Bring me some coffee please. I need to get some things done before this Allard girl shows up. Mainly covering up my all-nighter."
A set of footsteps made their way into the large bedroom, where two unknowing victims were lying peacefully in their king sized bed. Suitable, the two men felt like kings that particular night. Nevertheless, the footsteps drew nearer, weapon firmly gripped with both hands. The clock ticked on, with each second the attacker prepared to let their weapon fly down on the victims. The clock made a low
And with a flick of his wand Malfoy's clothes were gone, revealing the pale, bony body of the young man. A shiver immediately took over the small frame, hands tried to cover his bottom area, as well as arms tried to protect his torso and tears were flowing silently down his cheeks. Something inside Harry broke at the sight, the man looked so vulnerable and frightened, like a deer held at gunpoint. He had never seen his former enemy like that, terrified of exposing himself even for a trained eye. Even the diagnosis 'anxiety' didn't prepare Harry for the sight of this.
Via and Tara both gave a thoughtful click of their tongue. "It's understandable that you miss him. He was one of the few constants in your life, always there and always up to something. In a weird way you could trust that he would stay.", Via answered, making Tara shrug nonchalantly.
The blonde male clicked with his tongue, face in a grimace of bitterness. "There is no home Mister Rich Guy. See that bench over there? That's my home.", he moved his head towards a small wooden bench at the edge of a small park down the road.
"So, what can I serve you with, little dragon?", she asked, wicked glint dancing across her eyes. She noticed Draco darting a glance towards Harry, who stood silently on their left side and watched what was happening. She also noticed his mouth watering at the pure sight of his favorite sweets. Her rich laugh filled the small room at his helpless gesture, something what surely reminded her of his first visit. "One of each once for you and once for your parents?", she asked then, the good natured smile never leaving her as Draco nodded thankfully.
Narcissa moved slightly up on her toes to place a soft kiss to her son's forehead, a smile lingering on her lips. "Who knows, maybe you find yourself a date to walk along the Seine with as well. A nice french girl...", the blond threw her a horrified look, causing her to laugh in delight. "... or handsome french boy. You never allow me to finish, dragon!"
Here we go, another chapter out! Honestly, I have to admit I don't really follow a plan in this story. Ideas just come to my mind rather randomly and I write them down, so please forgive my unstructured type of writing XD. I hope the publication date now works, thanks again for the tip! Hope you enjoyed!
to signal midnight, the exact moment when the attacker made their weapon connect with the faces of both men lying beneath them.
Only minutes after Harry arrived, the door opened slowly to reveal Tara, one of his coworkers. She was a healer too, not as experienced as Harry though. The woman was from Hogwarts too, only two years younger than Harry and a Ravenclaw. She was incredibly smart, but not as smart as Hermione or Draco were. And she had a huge heart, big enough for a Hufflepuff. This loving women eyed Harry with a concerned frown on her face, stepping closer so she could see if there was something wrong with him.
The blond closed his eyes, drawing in a deep breath of all the different smells, only to open his eyes to a door opening (from his experience Draco knew the door led directly to the kitchen). But to his utter surprise, it wasn't Madame Talouse stepping out, but a very young
"I guess I kind of missed him. My wizarding world always included Malfoy, from the very beginning. He was the first kid I met, back at Madam Malkin's. Nobody was around and he was just rambling about Hogwarts, wide eyes and a smile on his face. I haven't known any better than to refuse his friendship, but still. It haunts me. Maybe I would have been able to protect him from all this pain.", Harry recalled with a frown, light dancing in the emerald iris of his.
With three big steps he was in the middle of the circle, catching one of the officers attention. The man began to talk, but Draco didn't care as he shoved the guy away to finally see who the third pirate was. When the startling emerald green orbs finally connected with his, Draco felt his knees going week. Longer black hair strands fell loosely into Harry's face, hiding a long lightening shaped scar reaching across his face. He had grown quite a lot, not really surprising though. He was maybe two years older than Draco after all. A breath Draco didn't know he was holding left his lips as he took a step forward, pulling off his hood in the same moment.
"You are looking way too sexy for your own good.", Harry rasped, pulling his man closer to place small kisses on Draco's neck. The blonde tilted his head to give the smaller more room to work, smiling at the butterflies erupting in his stomach. All contrary to the acid that had risen in his throat most of his life at similar actions of other men.
Silence. There was no answer, but Harry made out that someone's breath was picking up at the mention of his name. He quickly turned to the side of the room he heard the breath from, but still saw nothing.
The men looked at each other with a strange look, gritting their teeth before showing Harry to the entry hall, where a port key was placed on a small table for their leave. Dementors watched carefully when Harry approached the small object, being held back only by the permission in Harry's pockets, which allowed him and his patient to leave to St. Mungos when needed. Without another glance to the other men Harry ported to the hospital, directly into the room it was connected to. Malfoy still levitated beside him, sound asleep and completely knocked out from exhaustion. The healer quickly moved the blond into the hospital bed, covering him with a thick blanket and connecting some charms to him, so he would be alarmed if he woke up or something was wrong. Another charm showed his vitals on a board.
With that, Draco hurried out of the bakery into the small alleyway, relieved to draw some fresh breaths after the thick tension inside the room. Even if it was a rather pleasant tension. Now there was a thing left. He had to get new things to dress. Of course, there were a lot of fine clothes in his wardrobe, but nothing which suited for a date. Reason enough for the young blonde to run down the streets, up to a small shop in a wizard part of Paris. Of course not before fetching Dobby a gift card with the Eiffel Tower on it. The beautiful designer clothes in the shop were made by nobody else than Madame Zabini, mother of his childhood best friend and his second mother. The woman would be thrilled to know Draco had a date for the day.
A snort left Draco's lips at Harry's expression. He shoved his middle finger into Harry's face, a small smile tugging at his lips. The laugh of Harry following Draco's actions was rich and genuine, all with twinkling green eyes. To his own surprise, the headache was fading with each second he was in Draco's presence, a very welcoming change of events.
"I always keep my promises.", the black haired man answered, a suppressed grin building on his features as he pulled Draco closer and finally connected their lips. The blond felt as if heaven was coming upon him, rough chapped lips engulfed his own while hard stubble probably left red marks on his chin and cheeks. Strong hands pulled him close to a strong chest, while his own hands were clumsily finding their way into thick strands of black hair. Both of them surely needed practice in kissing and it wouldn't be the best kiss they ever shared with each other. But right for this moment, everything was perfect. The whole world stood still, everyone was just staring at the pair. They parted with a smile, looking into each other's eyes.
"I hope your wait wasn't too long.", he friendly said, pulling out one of the chairs with rolls beneath it but without a back to lean on, so healers could use them to sit down while talking to their patients or looking at their injuries. Harry swiftly sat onto it, rolling in front of Michael who gave him a very happy smile. "So let's see what's bothering you with your wrists, shall we?"
Robards nodded thoughtful. Shacklebolt had an apologizing look in his face, but he didn't say anything to interrupt Harry.
"So... Malfoy. You like it here? I mean, it must be nothing to what you are used to from your childhood, but then it's quite a tad better than Azkaban...", Harry frowned at his stupidity, probably he shouldn't mention the prison right away in the first real conversation. But Malfoy merely eyed him very amused over his shoulder, relaxing slowly into the bathtub. He barely shrugged. A small laugh escaped Harry's lips at the posh Slytherin, causing Malfoy to smile in contentment as well.
There was a teasing smile on Harry's face as he nodded, handing Draco a helmet which the blonde quickly put on. "Oui! It is from my godfazer. 'e is a big fan of moto's and teached me 'ow to drive.", the Raven explained, pulling a black helmet over his own head and securing it beneath his subtly stubbled chin.
Via nodded in understandment, still smiling at the man in front of her. She was never the one to be heartbroken or lovestruck, but Potter definetly was a good man and partner nonetheless. Whoever might be the lucky witch or wizard to gain his heart should consider themself as the luckiest living creature. Still she was happy to have him around, brighting up the darkest places at times.
Though, to his surprise, James laughed somewhere in the back of the kitchen, throwing a small ball of tissues at the dog. "God, Sirius! Don't act like someone is taking your cub away.", the dog eyed said man with a menacing glare, though James only shoved out his tongue to the animal. "I'll tell Moony you scared kids away for fun.", a second of thoughtful silence erupted, though it didn't look like backing down. "And that you ate his chocolate."
Harry was sure Draco's throat must hurt like shit, not to mention his ribs after being held as tight as Harry had, but without even wincing Draco gulped down the can of soup, a dreamy look on his face. Sure, he hasn't eaten something tasty, anything barely, for the past few months or years, but the way he gulped down the soup and smiled at Ron as if he has been given the greatest gift of all time, Harry almost felt as if the situation was something normal.
"Stop this! There's a child in the other room and he's scared to his bones. We didn't plan on killing them either way. No more torture, you go and bring the stuff to the ship and I stay with Moony and Wormtail. We'll follow short after, but inform the Captain of the change.", Harry explained, relaxing at the pitiful looks on most of their faces. The crew wasn't heartless, nobody here wanted to hurt a child or traumatize it. So all of them left quickly, grabbing the bags full of gold and other things on their way. Pettigrew still pressed the cutlass to Lord Malfoy's throat, but he didn't look so filled with hate anymore. Remus pulled out a coat from a cabinet to his left and threw it at Lucius, signaling him to put it on.
With these words he casted a stasis charm on Malfoy's back and gently lifted the blonde into his awaiting arms bridal style, careful to not put pressure on any of the injuries. Malfoy grabbed Harry's robes again with his bony fingers, seemingly afraid to be dropped. Of course Malfoy couldn't fully trust Harry after only a few hours of civility, but that doesn't mean Harry's heart ached any less. It would take ages to get Malfoy to trust him, what if there was no time for that. What if there was not enough time for Harry to fully heal Malfoy, mentally. Harry wasn't a Mind Healer. He was only there to cure physical damage, but that didn't seem enough. It didn't seem right. Right there, when Malfoy clung to his robes with fear in his eyes, Harry decided that he was way too far gone to be only the Healer. He was already more than that. No matter how, he would he there for Malfoy until he was fully back.
"Stay here for a second, I'll talk to them real quick. Then you can go back to your Mum and Dad, does that sound alright?" Draco nodded slowly, hope building visibly. The boy must have thought they'd kill them, hurt them in every way possible and him probably right after. But Harry wouldn't make this boy suffer for the simple reason of revenge and greed and he definitely wouldn't make this boy an orphan like himself. With these thoughts in mind he ran back to the other room, pushing through the lot of pirates surrounding the married couple. Blood already covered Lucius sleeping shirt, all from small cuts and one deeper wound at his side. His face was swollen from punches, but it wasn't all too bad, only minor injuries. Mrs. Malfoy was crying in fear, clenching to her husband's arm and hiding behind the strong man. Nobody really touched her, for her being so fragile they feared she would break at a little cut. Harry immediately stepped in front of them, holding his arms out defensively to stop the men. Pettigrew and Remus looked at him with a questioning glance, the others only huffed.
Malfoy turned in the tub to punch Harry on the arm, a small smile on his lips he seemingly tried to hide, but failed miserably while trying.
Harry walked in the front of a little triangle of people, his robes swinging harshly in the wind and his now chin length, curly, dark hair also completely ruffled through the storm. Two steps behind him were the guys of the Ministry from their visit in the hospital and lastly a dementor following closely behind to check on them. Even though Harry knew they wouldn't do anything to him now, he couldn't help but remember the feeling of his soul being sucked out by these demons. The coldness closing around his heart was almost enough to tremble, but Harry was nothing like this small boy from Hogwarts anymore. And he was walking in the front of the group because he was Harry Potter, always the leader of adventures.
While the sound of water flooding steadily in the tub caused a gentle, constant noise in the background, Harry grabbed his wand and looked at Malfoy with a soft smile. "I will undress you with a quick charm and get rid of these filthy clothes after the bath. Just don't be scared of the feeling, it's a bit weird to get undressed that way."
The rich guy moved his gaze towards the bench and back to Draco, lip caught between his teeth. For a moment he said nothing, then, he eventually unlocked the doors of his car. "Come on, get in."
Even in the darkness, Teddy's eyes shone like diamonds at the words. "You think so? I never got anything for Christmas! Santa would have to make up for a looot of years.", he rambled, letting himself be carried by Harry like a sack full of potatoes. Draco, knowing Santa Claus was surely not the reason for any presents in the house, looked after Harry with a stunned look on his face. He must have gotten up in the night and somehow organized presents for them. The love Draco already held for the other man increased with each second he spent with him.
"Can... can we forget the conversation? For now?", Harry stammered, looking anywhere but back at Draco. For a moment, he thought the blond didn't hear him, until slowly, very, very slowly he nodded. But instead of of relaxing, he pushed the blanket away from Harry's hip and squinted his eyes, as if searching for the hard-on Tara talked about. Even though the blush on Harry's cheeks immediately increased, nothing was there. The situation must have caused any thought about their proximity to shut off completely.
"No need for a hurry Malfoy. You will get enough water I promise. And food. The pain will stop and I really hope I get you back on your own feet soon enough. Everything will be alright at some point yeah? I... I promise Draco. I patch you up myself if I need to.", Harry whispered, running a hand through the blond mess of hair on the other man's head. There was an odd kind of affection he felt towards his nemesis, not truly out of pity, not even based on his job as a healer. But Harry just wanted Malfoy to be protected and in safety. Said blond glanced at the other man with a glint of hope in his silver orbs, hand slowly reaching up to place it on Potter's chest with a thankful smile, tears forming at the corners of those beautiful eyes Harry adored so much. Ever since their staring contests at school, he became practically obsessed with the honesty Malfoy's eyes always held.
The Healer's gaze, again, found the one of the Minister. But this time, he was able to hold it for his answer. "I'll make sure to ask him."
Not to throw praise on anyone, but Harry was indeed the winner of last years relaxation award in the hospital. They had a very old, very grumpy witch living here with them, because she was too old to live alone and too picky with her caretaker. So they started a challenge three years ago, of course with consent of the women. They would take weekly turns on caring for the women and whoever made her feel best was awarded with mentioned title. Harry won the award first time participating and was actually pretty proud of this achievement, because the grumpy witch named Helena actually liked him.
One of the man left after seconds of hesitation. Harry came now near enough to notice the horrid smell of excrements and a glimmer on the ground made him aware of a small puddle. Urine most likely. Extreme pity and some weird kind of rage formed in Harry's stomache. Once every two weeks? He wasn't cleaned from this for two weeks? For years now? What kind of inhumanity was this supposed to be?
Rustling of paper reminded Harry that he was actually in a room full of important people, therefore he sat up straight again and led his  gaze to Robards, who was looking through the papers the boy from before brought him. The bushy eyebrows of Head Auror Robards were furrowed and his mien got serious. Harry's interest piqued, those logs held the answer to one of the most important questions he had since he left Azkaban. Who was the bastard that has hurt Draco so brutally.
"Explain to me why the Moony guy is chasing down the Padfoot... dog... for eating his chocolate... who even
Harry simply laughed at the reaction, for a matter of fact, the surgery on tonsils was one most Muggles did as infants or children. To see a grown man, who almost served death sentence in the deadliest prison on earth while being starved and paralyzed, reacting as if someone just told him they would cut his head off, was fairly good comedy.
A snort left Draco's lips, he did get those out by now without too much of a problem, which Harry could only interpret as:
It had been a while since Draco last visited Paris with his parents. During his final years at Hogwarts, school work kept him from all vacations and practically any activity but studying in his little office, just one door from his bedroom, every time he came home for holidays. Being at school it had been even worse. But now that his NEWTs were finished and excelled with the highest of honors, Narcissa and Lucius quite literally dragged him to the local Portkey office and off they were to a vacation in Paris.
Harry was the first to shift awkwardly, his legs carrying him towards the other. As soon as he was barely a foot away, he stopped and flipped the lose strands out of his face. "So... could I take you out for dinner zis evening?", the raven haired man asked, his green eyes looking everywhere but at Draco. Though he missed the most stunned and excited expression on the blonde's face.
The Head Auror's lips twitched into an involuntary smile, though he still wrote the address on a small piece of parchment with a quill on Kingsley's table. Afterwards, he slid it over to where Harry sat, giving the man a curt nod. Harry had the unspoken allowance to do whatever he wanted to that guy. Maybe he should ask to get that written down somewhere, just in case he choked the guy to death on accident. Not on accident. Cut that. Completely on purpose.
While there was a short pause, Harry took a step forward and let his hand slide down from Draco's shoulder to his arm, signaling he would like to take the trembling hand into his. Of course, Draco allowed him to, feeling a pleasant shiver run down his long spine as their fingers entwined.
"Draco. There is no need to be afraid.", he whispered, fingers tracing the sharp and high cheekbones of the older. "You might think you look terrifying. You might think you look ugly and disgusting. But I don't care.", grey eyes met green, uncertain of the truth behind their intensity, "I don't bloody care Draco. You have been through so freaking much and all I do is being immensely proud of you. Your appearance is a part that we can get back to normal. It will take some months, maybe years, but we will get there. Your heart changed though. I mean, don't get me wrong, you are still the bloody git from school. But now, you are a bloody git I really, really want to get to know better.", a shy laugh left Harry's lips, black locks blocking his view for a second before he managed to throw them back. "What do you think? Can we be friends?", the Healer asked, hand held out for Draco to take.
Merlin, his mind must not be working correctly anymore. Of course he crossed a line, Draco Malfoy didn't
Even with his sleepy mind Harry realized how weird this comment was. Malfoy talked about him? And from what he said this women expected him to be happy about Harry being his Healer? Honestly, Harry was quite sure of Malfoy hexing him as soon as he tells him about some of the treatments they have to go through. And as soon as he got his voice back he would tell Harry off for not helping him out of Azkaban and whatsoever. He was just weak from starving and all the pain, so he didn't complain as long as he got better.
"I'm-...I'm sorry. I-I... You... Merlin you sounded like a dying seagull.", Harry pressed out between breaths and more laughter. Malfoy gave him his best glare from school, but the heat was lurking and Harry couldn't help but flash his most charming grin at the blond, all white teeth and sparkling eyes.
Upon arriving, the dementor opened several gates, all of them reaching double of Harry's height. Immediately Harry felt small, looking up to the gates of steel with a thick layer of black must on them. The young wizard grabbed his wand in a matter of defense, something he could rely on even though this place seemed to inject darkness into his veins. Darkness he couldn't fight with his wand.
"Not to interrupt your moment, Malfoy, but I should start on washing the rest of your body. I do also have a few other patients to visit once in a while."
A knock on the door gave the two friends a reason to look up from their conversation, one being obviously happier about it than the other. Harry looked to the simple white door, expecting Tara to come in and whip his ass for ending as her patient. Scary imagination.
Harry had to close his eyes at the imagination. His hands caught his weak body against the side of the couch, as soon as he leaned against it. Memories flashed Harry's mind, of visiting Azkaban, of seeing Malfoy for the first time, looking like Death himself. Of the list of injuries, of the small spark of fear and hope in his former enemy's eyes. Hot stomach acid burned in the back of his throat, soon enough hitting the floor as Harry emptied his stomach when the horrible memories finally gripped him.
Harry's inner tantrum was rudely disrupted by Malfoy tapping his shoulder, his lips forming the word 'parchment'. Why Harry could lip-read? Andromeda teached him soon after she lost her hearing, because she became very involved with other deaf wizards and witches, who mostly couldn't really talk. They formed words with their lips and did sign language. And after five years of talking to these people at weekends, when he took care of Teddy, he was able to read lips and talk in sign language fluently.
"Bonjour Monsieur. My name is 'arry, how can I be of 'elp?", the man asked in a strong, but very attractive French accent.
After stepping through the floo, Harry sank on his armchair with a content sigh. His boss, Reiman, would definitely send an owl for him. The grumpy man in his midlife-crysis was extremely sensible when it came to skipping a work day, but looking at the fact that Harry worked two shifts after another, he couldn't really do anything about it. Especially not with Tara there to talk him down. So, after all, Harry was able to get a nice night of sleep. Well, rather a nice day of sleep.
The disgusted look on both of their faces made the crew and Harry chuckle deeply, but Sirius interrupted them by stepping away, allowing the group to walk over a small wooden plank onto the ship. Draco held onto Harry's hand with great fear, all the while big steady waves crashed against the bottom of the wet wood.
To his surprise, the blonde immediately closed the gap between them again, wincing at the idea of leaving Harry's side for only a second.
"Of course the food is good, since we didn't let you cook, James.", she drawled, leaning against the door frame.
A small doorbell rang as he stepped into the petite room, smelling of croissants and macarons and so many beautiful eclairs and petit four, his brain almost shut down completely. Draco had always had a terrible sweet tooth, but fresh Parisian bakery sent him to the doctor's more than once. There were just so
Harry drove good, not too fast and not too careful, giving Draco every reason (apart from his closeness) to enjoy the short ride. Not ten minutes later, they arrived at a beautiful house in the garden areas of Paris, one of those houses Draco used to visit as a child when his parents decided on meeting old friends. Not to mention how little Draco had enjoyed most of those events, that particular house had caught his eye as a kid once at Christmas. Doing their yearly stroll around the city they had been celebrating Christmas in, family Malfoy had wandered down this exact street and laughed about a charmed snowman, which to the unknowing eye looked like a very good robotic figure of Muggles. Though as they all knew about magic, the snowman had been a rather rude thing, insulting clothes bypassers wore and choosing Lucius as a victim on their walk. The oldest Malfoy had sulked for the whole rest of the day, meanwhile Narcissa and Draco couldn't help themself and laughed wholeheartedly for the rest of the evening. It was such a vivid and happy memory in Draco's mind, ha had often used it to cast his Patronus. Now knowing the person the whole memory was attached to, the blonde couldn't help but laugh all over again. It started out quietly, muffled behind an elegant hand, but soon grew loud and honest enough to startle Harry quite a bit as he turned around to face his date.
Another eager nod came as an answer from the young boy. He held out both his wrists to Harry and watches him curiously, his smile constant on his face. One of the fathers carefully ran a hand through his son's hair, smiling proudly at his brave boy. Another smile escaped Potter's lips too, such a sweet bond naturally touched his heart.
Draco carefully tapped on Harry's arm, giving the Healer reason to look up. The older pointed his long, thin finger to something lying on the small nightstand next to Harry's side of the bed. After taking a closer look, the raven realized it was a hand mirror. Merlin, he wasn't sure if that was a good idea. In fact, he was sure it was absolutely stupid and not a bloody good idea at all.
A shaky laugh escaped Harry, his big hand running through the mess of black hair on his head. "No wife. Let's not make things up, I would be a horrible husband. I would be quite happy to have some company over Christmas... it's lonely here... Draco,
One stubborn glare of Draco later, Harry slowly handed the other the mirror, but not before sitting upright behind him and pulling him up to his chest, one arm carefully draped around his stomach. He didn't want Draco to lose his shit and hurt himself. The older looked at him as if he has gone crazy and snatched the mirror from Harry's hands. As soon as Draco looked into the mirror though, he almost instantly looked away again. His hands were trembling, eyes filled with tears. Slowly, very slowly he turned the mirror to look at it again, before throwing it through the room as if it burned him. Harry watched everything happening in slow-motion from then on, the mirror hitting the wall, breaking into hundreds of little pieces and leaving a small carb in the white paint, Malfoy's breathing catching up with his frantic heartbeat, followed by as much thrashing around as Draco's worn out and paralyzed body allowed. He tried to shove Harry away, tears spilling freely over his cheeks and landing partly on Harry's hand on Draco's stomach. Choked sobs escaped the blonde's mouth, his hands pulling at his hair and Harry's clothing. Everything happened kind of damped, Harry couldn't hear properly, the rush of blood in his ears was too loud.
"Deep breaths Harry. Whatever it is, I am sure we can solve it. Give yourself a chance to calm down and think.", he whispered into his friends ear, hand fisting Harry's jumper. Slowly, very slowly, Harry started breathing normally again, falling right into Ron's arms with his vision blacking out.
Again, Draco smiled and leaned into Harry's side, looking beautifully shy. The young raven haired boy moved his arm around the blonde's shoulders, pulling him closer. Something felt as if it connected the boys right there, an invisible bond that grew stronger with each second Harry was close to the other boy. Harry buried his nose in the blonde locks of his friend, inhaling the clean scent of freshly washed hair. He hadn't smelled that for a while now. They stood in a dark corner of the room, away from anybody else, when reality finally hit Harry. He started liking the boy, in a way he never thought possible. Physically as well as mentally they were drawn to each other, not afraid of each others touch or anything for that matter. The other pirates were long forgotten, the discussion up on deck, too, as soon as Draco came closer to bury his face in Harry's chest. His clothes must have smelled horrible, but the younger boy seemingly didn't care. A small smile graced his pink lips and reflected the fair light of a lantern. Without hesitation Harry leaned forward and kissed the boy's forehead, before taking his hand again. Maybe, after all, he could find a reason to fight again.
In a comfortable silence, Draco started with the smallest of the gifts, pulling away the tape carefully and gently removing the small silver ribbon. Beneath was a small black box with two C's on it, something Draco felt like he should recognize, but for the sake of it being midnight, he didn't. Inside the box was a simple silver necklace with a dragon on it, reflecting the light of the candles to make it look like the dragon was on fire.
"Oh Papa and Sirius will be so 'appy to know zeir création insulted Lucius.", he answered, clapping his hands as if they just won a big price. Shortly after, he jumped from the Harvey and held a hand out to Draco, his eyes twinkling in utter bemusement. "Alors, come on! I want you to meet my parents!"
The blonde drew closer to Harry, resting his head on the strong chest, his right hand spread out flat on the raven's left side, right above his heart. Harry was sure Draco must have felt his heart skip several beats. If he did, he didn't mention it. He just laid there, slowly drawing circles on Harry's chest, careful not to tickle Harry and he got lost in his own world, eyes zoning out.
The older Healer tried to give her his best death glare, apparently with no effect. Right when he was about to give in on the request, the light of the floo turned green, announcing a visitor coming through the flames. The moment a small young women stepped out of the flames, eyes a deep blue and hair dyed silver, body stature of a Quidditch player, Harry shot to his feet. He knew the name was weird. Not only was the whole pronunciation weird, he knew the name! She was playing for the Quiberon Quafflepunchers, a french team and in times of the World Cup, she used to play as seeker for the National Team of France.
The women laughed very melodically, before waving him off with a soft gesture of her hand. " 'On't you worrie, 'ealer Potter. Draco 'nows 'e will be waked by moi. Juste bring moi to 'is room."
Harry got out of the car with his eyes glued to Draco, excited to see the blonde's reaction to his monster of a home. All he received was an uncertain, almost pained mask. The raven tilted his head to the side, asking Draco the silent question of what was wrong.
Harry stepped out of the elevator, right into a meeting of the Minister, Head Auror Robards and some other Aurors Harry didn't know. They were apparently just about to get into the Minister's office, so Harry rushed to them as quickly as possible. He didn't intend on waiting hours to talk with Kingsley.
His eyes flicked from Lucius' cold stare to Draco's warm glance right behind the man, seemingly relaxing as he took a visible breath. "Bonjour, Monsieur. Marie told me I could be meeting vous, alors I brought flowers and pralinés for Madame Malfoy, as a present.", he began, giving Narcissa reason to clasp her hands in delight and push through her son and husband to receive her gift.
Harry didn't know what exactly made him obey to her. Maybe her strong stature? Or his natural respect for french women, influenced by Fleur? Or maybe it was the 24 hours of work? No matter what exactly made him do it, he was soon leading Angela to Malfoy's room. His vision was partly a little bit blurry, he really needed a coffee at least.
?", Draco shot at him with more force in his voice than necessary. It almost sounded furious. Harry winced, his dark skin tainted red on his cheeks.
in a cell. I was surprised he was still bloody breathing. The guard broke his ribs and all in all he abused Draco with everything in him. That bloody son of a bitch thought he could get away with it because nobody cared. But I care. God I will rip this guy into pieces!"
"Ronald, pray tell, did you lose your wand again?", she asked, thin eyebrow raised in a way it could have made concurrence to Malfoy.
"Don't you think I shouldn't be here? This-", he gestured to the whole of what Harry called home, "-is not where a whore belongs. Your wife would surely not be impressed to see me."
"Why was there a panic attack?", she asked, composure slowly falling back into place. Of course, the curious side of her had to shine through. It always has in these moments.
"I don't care. Keep it.", he answered, a smile on his lips as he took both boxes and pressed a kiss to the woman's cheek. "I come here again tomorrow or so. Thank you for the sweets."
"It's so good to see you, Madame Talouse. I see you are just as beautiful as you have been when we first met."
With care, the young healer casted a few diagnosing charms at Michael's wrists and then tapped his parchment once with his wand. Seconds after, words formed in black ink, describing whatever problem there was with the boy.
After performing the charms Harry sat on the now clean floor, smiling softly while pointing his wand slowly to the man's face. First he made out pale skin, sickly pale, almost white with some remaining dirt covering it. Then he made out high, very much fallen in cheekbones. They looked as if the man was a living skeleton, so incredibly prominent were they. A pointy chin and sharp jaw intensified the skeleton look, completed by sunken in eyes and dark circles beneath them. No sleep at all, that was clear. Lastly the face was completed by piercing silver eyes, looking directly into his and platinum blond hair falling onto his forehead. Millions of thoughts abruptly halted at the intense stare, giving Harry something close to a punch in the throat. He couldn't breath. Malfoy.
Draco started smiling again. After being freshly dressed, the blond boy moved his head to lean against Harry's arm, what immediately caused warm butterflies to erupt in the older one's stomach. This feeling was definitely something he never had felt and this was incredibly scary, but beautiful at the same time.
The night-sky-blue eyes of the women shot to Harry, a dashing white smile on her face. She held out a hand for the young Healer to take. Harry took it, pressing down a yawn which built within his throat.
"What then? How will I go on with the job and my miserable life after having tasted the stars?", Draco whispered, a small hiccup leaving his lips with the second confession he made. He was afraid of his future, afraid of going back to his job.
All those headlines caused a never fully leaving headache on the young Healer, leading him to wonder if anyone even wanted him to be happy. Most of the time Harry felt like a puppet on strings, being played by society to tell them their favorite fairytales. After years of living with the constant feeling of people staring at him and faking their whole behavior in front of him, Harry learned the best way to cope with stuff like that was, in fact, doing his own thing and making himself happy. Everything else would come to him in its own pace.
"Don't you worry Harry. You care so much about everyone. Malfoy will be just fine with you as his healer. You didn't get that award for 'Best Healer Of The Year' for nothing.", she smiled softly, ruffling the messy black hair on his head. How soft these curls were and how incredibly unlucky that no woman could ever claim them as theirs.
Nott was by now fuming, his knuckles white and his head red. "Don't fucking try me Potter. That cheap bitch isn't quite worth your composure in front of everyone, including your boss, is he?", Nott spat, hitting the weakest point Draco had once again. Right, he wasn't worth any trouble.
Draco's hands were forming fists at the words of Theodore Nott. As in the past, he couldn't do anything against the guy. He had hoped he would have more time before having to come up with an idea how to save little Teddy. But it seemed like he had to think of something right then and there.
Harry nodded eagerly, his smile bright as he bowed lightly and kissed Narcissa's hand. "I would be 'onored!"
The winning grin on the blonde's face was worth an award to make in reasonable, as he squeezed Harry's buttocks slightly to underline his answer. "I don't fucking think so, but I am more than ready to try."
Harry felt like he might black out from embarrassment once again, since the guy Tara was talking and not even lying about was currently right in his arms. Fucking great. She couldn't have chosen any worse scenario to come up with something like this. Not only that Malfoy seemed frozen in complete and utter shock, the fucking guard was still standing right over there! What was taking Ron so goddamn long?!
The blonde nodded into his date's shoulder, slowly stepping back and throwing Harry a flushed smile. The Raven winked at him, lopsided smile on his own face as he moved the Harley into their driveway and shot a warning glance towards the window, where surely a man with equally black hair and glasses stood, grinning wildly at his son and waving. Harry rolled his eyes and gestured for the door, which was shortly after opened by a red haired woman wearing a beautiful green dress, behind her, the father bounced up and down, hair flying wildly as he did so.
The couples always crossed the street to make sure not to have any contact with the lowlife Draco was called out to be. In the beginning, Draco was ashamed of people looking at him as if he was disgusting and dirty for selling his body. Everyone did, except for the smallest kids who crossed his path. They were mostly concerned about him not having clothes to dress in or ask him if he would like to have their sandwich. Sometimes, Draco almost took the little sandwich, up until he saw the parents of the kid, pulling it away from him and ordering the little dwarf to never talk to scum like that. But the years changed him. Draco grew out of the shame, he realized a shy and insecure guy would only attract worse men. So instead the blond male decided on staying completely professional while doing his job and only let his emotions flow as soon as he was in a cheap hotel room for the night.
The young Healer was about to carefully remove his arm again, blush creeping down his neck so brightly Malfoy must have been blind to not see it, as he faced Harry to the point of his breath adding to the hot sensation on his neck. The two minutes of Gryffindor courage were now totally over, he felt sweat forming on his forehead, but before he could withdraw his arm, Draco did something Harry didn't expect even in his optimistical seconds.
"Holy... shit Malfoy. These bloody bastards... don't look at me like I never swore in front of you. Merlin, you look like Death himself.", he whispered, carefully moving one blond strand behind Malfoy's ear with tears in his eyes. "I will help you alright? This nightmare is over, once and for all. You will never be alone like this again." Of course Malfoy was his former enemy, they hated each other back in school, but Potter already forgave his classmate for everything he had done. The boy had no other choice... and he clearly didn't deserve this just because he tried to survive. He never even deserved to be locked up in Azkaban, Harry knew that.
The woman spoken to smiled brightly at Hermione and nodded, holding her hand out to pull the other out of the room. Harry's best friend quickly took it, leaving the room hastily without looking back. The way Draco now hid his body behind his thin arms almost gave Harry reason to lecture Hermione about basic social interaction with victims of such abuse. The Healer had to take a deep breath, before eventually throwing Draco a shy smile.
Emerald green eyes found the deep brown eyes of the Minister, holding a stare for several seconds. Eventually, Harry looked away and sighed. "I told you he was."
When they arrived at the fancy restaurant in the middle of London, Draco's hands got a little bit sweaty. There was no going back now. Harry parked at the entrance, quickly stepped out of the car and jogged to the other side to hold the door open for Draco. The action made Draco smile, as he stepped out of the car as well with Harry's help. He put his hand on the smaller man's arm, like a princess did with her prince, and let Harry walk him inside the bigger ball room. Loads of people were standing inside, talking with each other in small groups. For every rich guy was at least one model with a minimum age gap of twenty years. Something Draco realized exactly in this moment was: All models were female. There was not a single male date.
"Don't you worry. He is always like that.", the blonde cleared with a smile, his hands pressed together firmly behind his back.
With that, Narcissa turned and placed a small kiss to Lucius' cheek, a wicked glint in her eyes. "Either smile or help me find a vase and let the poor boys go on their date.", she ordered sternly, her chin held high as she met his unforgiving stare for several moments. Without another word, he nodded and followed his wife inside, shooting Draco not more than a warning glance. It wasn't the support mother had given him, but Draco knew well it was everything his father was able to. And he was thankful for him to just let it slide without another comment. Taking another deep breath, Draco stepped fully out the door and closed it behind himself, taking a moment until he met Harry's eyes. The other was shooting him a worried glance, though he saw amusement hidden behind the obvious.
