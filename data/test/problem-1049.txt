I jerk.
I put my fork down.
Things have been going just fine, up to the point when we took our clothes off... And then - not so much. It just wasn't going anywhere, and I could do nothing about it. I don't think I can give her what she expects me to; I can't be what she expects me to be. I am already not.

. To the tiniest things, signs, sensations. To the whisper of the breeze and it's direction. To the talk of trees in the distance. To the air cooling down on my skin, telling me the sun is gone, telling me it's getting late.
"Malfoy," he repeats, "it's you. I had to check, hadn’t been sure I was in the right room."
I'm here for coffee and a toast and a chance to be alone. To savour this moment, to revel in joy, all the way grinning like a loon. I am happy, I'm bringing him breakfast, and I want to be back before he's awake.
"You know full well I didn't invoke it, Mr. Potter. It was only your own kindness that had helped bring Draco back."
I turn my head to the other side, and...
stiff and big, standing defiantly forward... black hair below his navel and firm stomach and flat belly, so vulnerable,
In the dark, I still can see that he is without his glasses. I smell his coarse woollen sweater and his warm skin and...
"I've passed, Harry!" She is bouncing, her face lit up with joy; she looks like a drop of sunshine. "They had made me an offer!"
He steps very close, leaning in… and I feel his fingers pulling the collar of my shirt up. He puts the tie around my neck. I swallow. I don’t know what’s the matter with me, but his proximity is doing things. To me. Goosebumps are rising over my forearms under the fabric, I keep myself from inhaling his smell in a lungful. The deft movements of his fingers at the base of my throat make me hold my breath, until he pulls the collar down, adjusting it over the tie, and steps back. I’m not sure what has just happened, but I’m relieved when he withdraws.
"I'm fed up with this shit," I say, approaching him.
The whole thing has made me a bit sick.
"And anyway, it won't change his decision to send me to that facility... Theo is not his main concern."
"Alright?" She laughs quietly, giving me another stroke through my jeans.
At first, I thought it was a cruel joke… but Hermione has never been cruel. Then I thought that my memory was playing odd tricks with me, or was it my eyes?
So Kreacher apparated me out of Hogwarts and brought me here. Potter hasn’t visited ever since. My only company in this creepy old place is the creepy old elf. The house drives me mad. Huge, ugly and dingy - scary. I chose the living room's sofa as my sleeping place. I don't care for the upper floors, for the grand staircase with the house-elves' heads on pikes along its walls.
Something in Draco’s eyes softens. It might be a trick of light playing in the man’s eyes, but Harry wants to believe that it’s not that. Draco licks his lips, hesitates for a second, then rolls up the left sleeve of his long coat with jerky movements. All the while Draco doesn’t look away from Harry, doesn’t shy away from whatever is happening right now.
Harry blinks, despite the world that he sees being a blurry mess. “Cru--?
“Ugh, no. If the nipples are numb then mealtimes are weird. I asked Molly for advice, since the muggle ones are useless, and she was just
He rubs at the lightning bolt scar that once was and now is just a pale patchwork of jagged lines that never tan. It hasn’t bothered him ever since Voldemort’s body fell dead on the cracked stone of Hogwarts’ floor, but it’s a reminder anyway. A reminder of what Harry was raised to be. Not a child, but a sacrifice. A pig for slaughter, as Snape had once put.
Harry swallows. “I’ll see you again soon, mate.”
“What, exactly, did you mean when you wrote that the revealing of personal information stored inside the journal is unavoidable?”
“Very well. Good. But just so you know, I don’t always tend to treat the people I hav-
To that Draco says nothing, just smiles self-satisfied and just this side of smug. Before he leaves Harry pulls Draco down for a quick kiss. They linger, of course they do, like always, but then Draco walks out the door with a promise to see each other soon, perhaps even later. Harry watches the rain swallow his boyfriend and wonders how long it will be before Draco realizes that his coat is still hanging here, in the shop.
The laugh that breaks past Draco’s lips is one of surprise, of disbelief. The coat sleeve falls and covers the dark mark as Draco lets his left arm fall and the right comes up to mess his hair. “Which one of them all?
Harry stammers a little bit over what to say, then swallows. “Thanks.”
“Well, what do you want to do with the possibility?” Remus asks as he has finished dabbing off tea from his mustache.
It takes a week to get the journal clean of the magic that had both tried to protect it and destroy it.
. I think she hates me.” Ron sets his lunch on an empty coffee table that Harry pulled out of the storage.
Remus’ words had sat heavily on his mind for the whole evening and night after Harry left the man’s house. He is still unsure if this will, or can, go anywhere, but there is no harm in trying, in reaching out and offering an
Levante Alby is a short, old witch that, when she first sees Harry, merely blinks once and immediately moves on to what needs to be done and how it will be done. Her hands are surprisingly steady as she points out the instruments around the dark shop, the books that have piled up on the
Harry only nods.
The war has been over for years but some shambles of it live on in Harry and he doesn’t know how to deal with them, how to heal them. Hermione said that therapy helped her, Ron gave his all in the auror trainings, later through actual auror work, and that mellowed out the jumpiness he had inherited from the final battle.
Lightning bleaches the sky white. As white as Harry remembers the King’s Cross Station was when he died. He watches the veins of the lightning blink in an out of existence and swallows.
Draco ruffles Harry hair before sitting down. He is careful with the takeout boxes, still somewhat unsure about the texture of them. “How is Granger and the Grangerling?”
“No need to apologize, Mr. Potter. I was also just making sure.” Levante’s lips almost pull into a smile. She then picks one book out of the pile that need to be sorted out and hands it to Harry. “This one will be easy, but I want to see how you will take care of it.”
It doesn’t take much for them both to relocate to one of the sitting rooms of the Malfoy manor. The inside has been changed as well, from what Harry manages to catch during his walk through the corridors. If the lines of Draco’s journal that he had to see are to go by, then Draco and Narcissa both probably felt eager to remove the past from these walls and change the house to something new, something better and more welcoming than what the memory of Voldemort and Lucius made it out to be.
A feather flutters atop Harry’s work desk as the owl flies away. He hopes it’s a token of good luck.
this time around.
The kiss is hungry and wild, all teeth and no class. It’s dirty, with saliva dripping down one side of Harry’s face. Draco pulls back just enough to then kiss over the faded spiderweb scar that used to be a lightning bolt, a symbol of the impossible and a mark of damnation, no worse than the dark mark.
. Perhaps, like he had told Draco the last time they met, not fully and completely, but he does know desperation and poisonous, consuming anger that comes with grief and trying to process loss and own weakness.
Ron thumps his shoulder against Harry’s. “Have you furnished a room at Cliffside Lookout for your godbaby yet?”
Some of the books there feel like dark magic, some are sad. Maybe, Harry think to himself as he picks up a book that feels slightly
“No?” Harry’s not sure. But he also doesn’t want to push, doesn’t want to become the same kind of obsessive as he had been during school, at times when he got hung up on one certain thing.
Meeting Remus is always a little bittersweet.
, Harry.”
Draco hides a laugh behind his cup, though his eyes crinkle as he grins. “Thanks for the shitty handjob then.”
It takes longer than he thought it would to let the last of Draco’s slanted handwriting settle in place. The journal hums, welcoming.
Harry blinks in time with the jingle of the bell. The world outside of the shop moves on in a colorful blur, though Draco seems the only thing that is sort of outside of it. Like the wizard doesn’t belong, or maybe doesn’t
“I’ll never figure out how you and that elf got to become friends, mate. But good for you, at least someone is babying you in our place.” Ron nods towards the kitchen, where Hermione is swearing up a storm about something. The wizard laughs.
I may have still doubted it when you grinned at me at the Ministry function, the tip of your cigarette glowing as you took a drag.
"Hi!" He grins.
"No it's fine, I'm fine," he said. He apparently didn't want to discuss whatever it was on his mind.
"I think so." I reach for a biscuit.
"Harry..." Granger steps forward, making me step back.
"Now what?" I drop his hand, and he takes the empty vial away.
"They... the Order, I think," I continue, "they brought him into the house of Black and he stayed with us - with
Last night after my breakdown, Potter made me go to bed, saying that we'd most definitely talk about it in the morning.
This is insane. Utterly crazy. I want it, I do... but... I don't know...
I sit against the wall, tears streaming down my face, and wait for the dreadful news to come.
When I wake up at dawn, I see Granger sleeping in the opposite bunk above Weasley, and Potter's bed is empty. The image of him guarding the entrance, sitting outside with his wand drawn, somehow makes me feel safe. I turn on my side and sleep.
It feels so good - to be allowed to kiss him now, like this. It's been about two weeks or more; at some point, I've ceased to count the days.
to him on those days. Something savage and hungry, as merciless as that first day when he wanted to shut me out of their protective sphere. It scares me.
"How long?"
He and I don't talk much at all since the hearing began. Still, his presence makes me feel safe. I need it.
I don't remember falling asleep.
Abigail spins the bottle. It points at another girl. To the laughter of people, they kiss in the circle.
long and slow, all the way down, until there's no further to go, and our bodies are pressed flush. I exhale.
"Malfoy... What?.."
"So... Yeah." I held out my hand.
What did he say?
Here within these walls, all that feels like a distant dream. A weird dream, as though Harry was never
"Though, you know..." Potter bites into his biscuit. "From what I'd seen in that place... no wonder people go mental."
"No! I just noticed he's changed, he's helping Potter, isn't that nice of him?"
"I'm sorry, Gin." I looked at her.
"Harry!"
It's the theory they base their system on: the sins of the fathers make their sons gay. Alcohol, drugs, violence and even divorce in the family inevitably lead to homosexuality, they say, selling this bullshit to those willing to pay for it in the hope of being 'cured.'
"No, I mean... I don’t mean like

Shocked, I gaped at the three of them. Whatever happened, I never thought it would come to
"I shouldn't just sit here, waiting it out, until my Mother gets hurt because I'm a coward."
And before I know it, he grabs my neck, pulling me into the kiss.
"Get out!" I shout. "Get out of my face!"
'Squeak-squeak-squeak...'
"Er..." Potter scratches his head. "He
How many times would I evoke this moment in my dreams? How would I wish to meet you just like this: with someone—a beautiful, brilliant someone—someone like you by my side. When it will finally happen, I'll realise I won't care. I will be free.
"Deliver it to Noir," I whispered, stroking its feathers. I had no idea if it would work, if this owl wouldn't return back to me in an instant or refuse to leave at all.
do you think you are doing?!"
"So." He crosses his arms over his chest. "Well... that time when I... used Sectumsempra on Malfoy in the bathroom..."
"What's the matter?" Ron frowns.
You threw the cigarette butt away, I downed the contents of my glass.
The door clicks shut.
"Still what?"
Potter.
When he finally kisses back...
"I am aware of the unfortunate bathroom incident between you and Draco."
I hear Potter moving around his room, the floorboards creaking under his footsteps, until the noise dies down, and the room goes silent. I come close to his door, leaning my forehead against it. I don't know for how long I stand like this, but when I finally bring myself to press the handle and enter, the room is dark.
“You’re shaking, are you cold?” He steps close again, probably to peer me into my face. “You aren’t going to pass out on me?”
Why would you
"You? Of course not." I roll my eyes.
He shoves his jeans and pants down, getting rid of them in one swift movement. He is hard.
"Yes, Father," you repeated for the thousandth time; it was the only thing you were good for.
He came again.
you ugly, old..." the voice rises, and the portrait falls silent.
There he is. Eyes luminous-green on the face I know better than my own. On the face I lov...
"I strongly recommend you to think twice, Potter." He perches at the edge of the desk.
He was probably right, for all you knew. But even you weren't that daft not to know that he would never wear this particular shade of jade with a dark green.
." She looked at him, her voice suddenly serious. "I need your help."
"They broke the Taboo, said the Dark Lord's name." Greyback grabs Granger by the arm. "The Mudblood and the Weasley. They are on the top list, I want my reward."
Your heart is quiet.
"Why would you be such a dick?!" He says. "I've never made this about your blindness. Do you expect me to start now?"
We are having dinner in silence, and Potter is frowning, avoiding my eyes.
For a wild moment I still thought I was looking at you. The same shaped eyebrows on a clear smooth forehead, the same delicate cheekbones, aquiline nose.. the same precisely cut bow of lips. It was
"To my room." His footsteps walk away.
“Yeah, sure!” He takes the glass out of my hands and gives it back, heavy with Firewhisky.
"Well, you shouldn't." He closes the door. "I'm not going to."
My heart will skip at the sight of the open book under the coffee table. Slowly, I will approach and pick it up. I won't need to see the title to know that it is yours. The one you were reading before you left.
No. No hope. Fuck hope. I killed all the hope that remained, and then checked thoroughly and killed it again. I didn't hope anyway.

He just rolled his eyes and came up to lie on his side next to me.
At the girl WeasLEY
Enough. You need to lie down. You run down the corridor to your room.
He may think that his hint had helped me to figure him out. He may think that now, once I know who he is, I don't want anything to do with him. He surely thinks that he was right, that once I knew, I'd end everything between us, just what he told me he was afraid of. And I've done exactly that.
I come close again, walking around, and press myself into him from behind. Only now I realise: all this time he's been holding his hands clasped behind his back.
"What?"
"Sorry." I bent down for a kiss, but he turned his face away, and my lips bumped into his ear.
When Potter returned in the evening, I wanted to give him money, but he refused.
She shouts.

The alarm goes off in the air, making me swear and jump. It's seven in the morning. Fuck, it's morning.
I touched your arm. "Where?"
"It looks like a bit too much."
I swirl around.

He's right, I've ruined everything. And how on earth am I supposed to fix it?
My ire instantly flared up. "You have no idea what you're talking about, you dick!"

"Maybe," I say, not taking my eyes off the clock. Though I know perfectly well that he hasn't. I know my Father.
lying there. Something wrapped in cloth, and...
I prefer to play when Potter's not home. The thought of him listening to my music makes me shy and anxious and oddly vulnerable, as though my playing may let him into my thoughts.
I stand up.
I haven't talked to him since the night when I confronted him and Zabini. I probably should; I don't know how. How to even approach him after everything I shouted in his face? I don't know. I'm still not entirely sure if I'm even right, if Noir wasn't a joke. But I hope.
My palms are tingling.
"Well, it's quite literally his birthplace, meaning Gryffindor was
When I finally blinked through the pain and looked up, Weasley held me at the wand point, and Potter's wand was pointing at Weasley.
"I don't know," I repeat. "Now, that you two are a
and when I finally expect the worse, the two of them draw their wands.
After the night spent on the sofa, I got up tired but feeling as brilliant as I haven't felt in ages. There were people in the Common Room, going for breakfast, giving us looks, but no one said anything.
So smooth to the touch.
"Do you? You never told me."
Warmth blooms in my chest, as steady and sure as a heartbeat.
He puts his hand on my hip.
He points his wand at Harry. "Cruci-"
"Yes, I'll knock," I said.
Until he did just that.
"Do you mind?" I ask.
He's inviting me for dinner, and he doesn't know when. It's Potter, he is...
“Harry!” Hermione grabs my hand as soon as I step into the Common Room. “Come, sit with us.”
He spread his arms.
Malfoy steps away to sit down and I am standing alone like an idiot.
"What?" I think I've misheard.
looks back and forth between his friends and then finally meets my eyes.
"Don't leave me."
Fuck, why did Potter have to bring these two here? Was it absolutely necessary? They hate me, and not without a reason, I must admit. If Potter is counting on their help with the solution as to what to do with me, he is mistaken. His friends will only make everything worse. Worse for me.
"I do." I look up at her, and there is such pain written across her face.
wrong. Someone like me is bound to never have a normal life."
"No." Malfoy shakes his head. "No." He lies down and covers his head with a blanket.
I look at him. "How do you feel?"
"No," he agreed. "But you're a sap and would like me to say that."
is just a word, a sound. It means nothing. Not anymore.
He's right, everything has changed.
"Please do." I wave my hand at him. "Do take the utmost care of your wife until she is recovered and give Narcissa my best regards once she comes to her senses."
"Dead."
"How fucking dare you?!" I try to wriggle out of his grip. "Violate my privacy!"
The next second I straddled him, pressing his shoulders into the back of the sofa. His short laugh turned into a gasp when I was rubbing against him whole. That damned jacket cut into my armpits, so I wrenched it off, throwing it on the floor.
This is all the courage I need.
Not daring to touch you, I will wait. We will both wait for your decision. Until you'll wince and make that tiny last step forward, wrapping your palms around my neck. Your lips will ghost over mine as you'll press our foreheads together but still won't kiss me. Instead, your arms will slip down over my shoulders until they lock around my back in a desperate grip. Only then will I finally allow myself to return your embrace. I will bury my face into your neck, just above the softness of your scarf and inhale, mad with memories and longing. I will dig my fingers into the coarse fabric of the coat on your back, savouring the feeling of your hard body under my palms.
I touch his hand and flinch. It is stiff and icy cold. I press my fingertips to the base of his neck, where I think a pulse point must be.
And though we'd begun to get along, at least a little bit, and I was beginning to even
"Glasses?" He smirks. "Come over and get them."
I swallow and close my prickling fingers into fists. "Oh… I don't know… this and that," I manage, "a bit of everything, really." I'm suddenly hot, there's an urge to take my cardigan off. "What do you smell?"
"And I want you to take this off." I lift my right wrist.
He says in annoyance, opening the door. "But clearly you don't need it--"
"Do you care?" You hooked your calf around mine.
Looking at her sideways from your bed, you saw she was nodding. She wasn't surprised.
Huddled together, we stand like that for an eternity, and I would call it happiness, but... I can't. It's not happiness, it's never happiness if
He did.
"Eighty-seven! Eighty-eight!"
This was all it took.
I nod. I am happy to see her, too.
"Thank you, Kreacher."
"Yes."
he's peeling an orange and sweet needles of taste burn on my lips…
More people entered, I saw Ron and Gin and shimmer of Parkinson's scales.
"I'm sorry, Ron," I repeated, "it's just... I trust you, it's not that... it's terrifying to say the thing out loud when no one expects you to, when everyone expects the opposite."
And down down down…
I thrash and scream. I try.
"Come here," he says, throwing back the blanket, "don't worry... I don't mean... anything, just..."
"Keep your voice down. He lost his sight a few weeks after he killed You-Know-Who."
"Good." I exhale. I'm so tired. "Otherwise... my Mother... you know-" I want to cry, and I'm not ashamed to cry in front of him, not anymore. But somehow I can't. It feels as though I don't have any tears left.
"I was jealous." I squeeze his hand.
"Yeah, sure. Do." He nods. "I'll be in my room. Just... you know..."
"Good," I said. I felt sick. "Thank you."
"Well, see you around." She moves up the staircase, levitating her trunk behind.
"Thanks."
I start awake.
Rest on his face.
"He said, I only had to let them in and lead them to him, and he'd take care of the rest." His face is devoid of expression.
My face is wet, my face is on fire, I close my eyes, letting my guilt burn bright... A scream boiling up my throat, I fall.
I don't let go.
The rings are shining.
I point my wand at the radio. “Fawkes.”
"Sit," he ordered. You dropped into the armchair.
"I'm not!" I protested, though deep down I knew I was.
Potter looks me up and down. I cross my arms over my chest to cover the Mark on my left forearm.
I open my eyes.
"What?"
Whatever it is - I know -
I should go back to my dorm and lie the fuck down because the pain in my scar is splitting my head in two. Instead, my feet carry me to the Astronomy Tower. I emerge at the top into the small empty room, the place where everything had turned into
"Potter!"
I don’t open them.
Footsteps approach, something heavy drops on my desk, there’s a scrape of the chair pulled over the floor.
He's sitting on the windowsill with his hands tucked under his thighs.
are seen there..."
it’s stupid to talk over the water with my back to him, and anyway, why am I making such a big deal out of it? “Are you going to the Halloween party?”
"Where's Ron?" I ask, my tongue feeling like paper.
do you think you're doing, Potter?"
“Yeah. What do you have there?”
"You bastard." You batted my hand away and gripped your cock, wanking yourself roughly.
He rolls his eyes. "Of course you didn't."
She stopped abruptly, making you almost bump into her back. You steadied yourself against the wall.
"Sorry." Your voice cracked. Your throat was raw, full of dust.
“It does.” He links his arm through mine. “I’ll be sporting a black eye tomorrow.”
Owls ‘To Harry Potter’ arrive daily.
"Do it, Draco," a voice says.
The clock on the wall shows half past seven. Now what? As much as it pains me, I have to find Potter. Putting my shoes on, I leave the room.
The door creaks but then stops halfway. “You’ve left the lights on.”
In the darkness, I barely see anything but the side of Potter's head, pressed against mine. His swollen cock is slick and alive. I can easily imagine it - red and dark - as big as I once saw it. His hand is clumsy on me, unsteady, but it is enough. Everything rises to the surface, and I am unable to hold it back. Potter
"Come here," he says and pulls me down.
The kitchen furniture creaks in indignation.
Theo had turned the story around, telling your Father that you had tried to rape him and then Crucioed him when you hadn’t got what you wanted.
With a flick of my hand, my shirt flies across the room and the glasses follow. I put them on, catching my own eyes in the picture, my smile unabashed,
I cover my ears with my hands and press hard to block out his screams. In silence, as though in slow motion, I watch Weasley's father approaching, and his sister, and Weasley himself with Granger by his side. He drops her hand and stumbles forward, his mouth open wide...
"You alright?" I lay face-to-face with him.
The drops fall into the wound. "...four...five," Potter counts.
I feel his hand on my arse, stroking, sliding back and forth, as his thigh slips between my legs. I don't really know what to do - I've never done this before - but I am bold with desire, or wine, or both, and it seems there aren't that many options but touch and kiss and
"You've changed." He cocks his head, surveying me from his high seat.
I'm in bed. And I don't remember how I’d got here.
"Wait." Finding his cock, I lean down and kiss him. "Like that."
"No problem," he said after a brief hesitation and moved close. "Here." He took my hand, guiding it into the crook of his elbow.
That was at the beginning. When you stayed almost every night. Before little things started creeping in between us. Before we started to fight. And even after. You always came back.
"Hi," I say, grinning back, and lean in to kiss him again.
"And... gay," I add.
"I'm fucking
"Would you please, read it aloud?"
, and I'm gonna apologise again."
I don't know how long he stood there, but while pretending to be asleep, I passed out for real. When I woke up, Potter was gone.
Your thoughts are swimming lazily.
Potter's face is smeared with dirt, his hair dusty as though debris fell on his head. Granger is no better.
"But..." Granger gives me a dirty look and turns to Potter. "Are you
The more they do that, the more I hate it, the worse I feel.
The door of the Great Hall bursts open, and people flood in. They are not students, they are adults. I see Lupin and a woman with short purple hair, a tall black man and the Weasley twins, more and more of them coming in.
I only manage to reply: "Yes, thank you, yes, thank you, yes, thank you," under Potter's heavy stare.
His palms are sliding over my body, down, down, his touch making me shudder and close my eyes.
Hermione squeezed my hand in reassurance, but she was only trying to cheer me up, knowing that in fact I'm right.
hungry, dangerous. Holding my gaze, he wrenches at his belt and unbuttons his flies, pushing his jeans down in one swift movement. Went he straightens up, with a jolt I realise that he's removed his pants, too. I gape at his nakedness, at his hard cock standing forward, at the locket gleaming golden against his chest.
Our eyes meet and he flinches, a shock of recognition surging through his gaze.
"Master is been return," the elf announced into the empty entrance hall.
'Squeak-squeak-squeak...'
"Potter?" He stops. "Are you?..."
"Sit here for a while?"
"Would you just... stop for a sec?" I grab at his sleeve. "I apologise, okay? I shouldn't have said that, I'm sorry."
You had still been so shocked by what Theo had done that you hadn't even thought he might tell anyone, let alone your Father.
I think, falling into the void of his bewildered eyes.
suck and spit, again and again; the patch of snow before me turns pink. I don't know if that's enough, or if I'm doing it right. I bite off a tiny chunk of the bezoar and hold it in my mouth, trying not to gag as the chalky gluey substance spreads down my throat. I spit it into the wound, smearing it with my thumb, and shove the rest of the stone into his mouth, waiting for a few moments before casting Ennervate.
"Alright?" I peer into his face.
"And who might you be, young man?" [19]
"Would you like to?"
— Let's go back in time.
"And you know me so well?"
She hugged me and held me and whispered: "I love you, too."

He closes the door, heading across the room until he stops right next to my bed.
But I know your scowl
"I bet you even helped to write them, having a good laugh about
A sea of heat and red and death, eating, consuming everything around. The stench of smoke throws me into a fit of coughing, and I realise that the Vanishing Cabinet is probably gone by now. No, I must get Harry out of here... But Harry is away, and I'm going to die, Harry is not here... I fall on my knees between Crabbe and Goyle.
"No, move closer," he says.
he said.
I read them, growing hot in the face in the middle of the Gryffindor table and for the life of me, can't share their contents with Ron.
"No," he finally says, not breaking eye contact, "in this Dumbledore wasn't mistaken."
"It is for you to decide."
I shuffle back.
I begin. “No. Erase that.”
I grin. "That’s not a colour, it's a spice."
I reach for the string around his neck and tug the tiny leather pouch from under his sweater. "Accio bezoar!" A spongy yellow stone slams into my palm.
I could probably try and evoke the memory I lied about. The one with Ron and Hermione right after the defeat of Voldemort. But I doubt it would be enough to cast my Patronus at all. Probably because I know now what happened to me next. It's no longer a happy memory.
“Yeah.”
He had no idea what it meant to me - his blind acceptance. If Ron stood by me, I could do anything, anything at all.
They don't stop.
"I want," I say.
Malfoy’s words are coming back to me.
I wipe my eyes angrily and stand up.
to get it over with sooner. Or to not send it at all; or to send it in a year. I don't know. Anything to calm the fuck down a bit.
I shiver and wrap my arms around myself in the sleeping bag; my stomach rumbles. I'm cold and hungry, but there's no food. My warming spells are utter shit, I'm useless, and they don't hold. It's dark and raining heavily outside. Though tired I am, the sleep wouldn't come. I've been tossing in the sleeping bag for hours.
I hug the pillow.

Bewildered, Malfoy stares at me, kneeling on the floor.

In silence, reluctant footsteps approach
"What is the last one?" I ask instead.
"Fuck me."
One year ago to the day. The two of you are standing side by side, clad in Muggle jeans, identical plain white T-shirts and black bow-ties. You lean against a railing, the Houses of Parliament in the background. You are showing off your left hands to the camera, wearing identical white-gold wedding rings.

I got used to it. Got used so that when you were suddenly not there, it felt as though I disappeared, too. As though you took me away with you, once you had left.
"You turned."
"Can you please take care of Malfoy here in my absence?" I gesture at the bed where Malfoy is gaping at us. "I mean... bring him food, and all... he may need." Hell if I know what Malfoy needs, it's not that I care, but I promised Dumbledore. "He must not leave this room until my return. I'll be back in a few days, I think. I have a... lot to do." I want to crawl into bed, take a Dreamless Sleep potion and sleep for ages, and forget this entire nightmare as if it never happened. I plan to do just that - the sleeping part.
I hesitate. "No." I can't leave him, not now, not ever.
His heartbeat under my palm is fast and steady, measuring the moments with a heavy rhythm. I slide my hands up and over his shoulders, finally stepping back.
“Have this one.” I offer.
Death Eaters around us burst with laughter.
"Merry Christmas, Sirs," he said, putting the tray down and conjuring two flute glasses out of the air. "Champagne is been serves tonight to every persons of age at Hogwarts. Sirs is being leave the Ball. Filly is bring champagne to Sirs."
"It died." I wince, spreading my fingers out. "It's dead."
"Unlike you, not because I was a better person." I shrug. "I never needed to. My family was disgustingly rich, and I had literally anything I wanted. There was no need to steal; all I had to do was ask my parents. So I really have no idea
I wash the soap off my chest and shoulders, sudsy water soaking through my pants. I need to wash it out. Fuck. Turning my back to Malfoy, I reach under the waistband, trying to make sure there’s no soap there.

"I don't accept your apology. Fuck off." Malfoy winces and slides carefully down to lie on his back.
"Maybe we'd better haven't..."
memories - they're all I have.
“You won’t be getting in the way, Harry,” Hermione says in exasperation. “Besides, I don’t think Ronald will be brewing either.”
, Harry," she sounds calmer than she looks, "why would you be such a coward? You should have told me long ago, and I would've left you alone."
"Sorry, I had to knock you out a bit, once we'd landed. Had to arrange some things first. I informed your Mother that you’re here."
"I get it." He throws me a brief look. "You are probably right, but I need to check first."
and scream
"Wow!" I stop in my tracks.
"After you." He bows, inviting me in with a wave of his hand.
"Yes, get close to him." Harry scrambles on his feet and pulls me up. "I have to go." He squeezes my hand. "Take care." He doesn't let go, he stares and stares at me, until Granger says:
I look at him.
The next photograph, and the next, and the next, growing the pile of
The awful,
"Your Patronus," he says in a strange voice, “it’s…”
I know perfectly well how Fidelius works.
Harry almost smiles. “Yeah. It’s that kind of night again.” He pauses, thinks of the things he should be doing and the ones he
“Thank you, Ms. Alby.” Harry feels proud of himself.
Draco comes with yet another summer storm, his hair splattered against his face and clothes dripping water all over the shop’s floor. Harry watches the other man wave his wand sharply to cast a few drying charms on himself.
Harry smiles, almost. “I already told you, I’m past petty school pranks. I liked you then, I like you now. I mean, it doesn’t have to go anywhere, obviously--”
Harry furrows his eyebrows, pauses. “What I want to do with it?”
But it still is bittersweet to see Remus, sometimes.
“I knew you were doing that on purpose.” Remus spares his son a glance and then looks behind him to make sure Tonks is nowhere near hearing range. “Better not let your mom hear. We’re all safer that way.”
“How do you want to do this, Potter?” Draco asks after a quiet moment.
Hermione rolls her eyes, her annoyance already forgotten by how much she seems to feel towards Ron. It’s clear in the softening of her face, the adoration in her eyes. “Such a Weasley indeed. Harry, what tea do you want?”
, he will soon start to think about these books the same way Ollivander thinks about wands. Like they have their own personalities, a specific mind of their own.
sharply, the sound too loud and grating into the shocked silence that Draco has left behind, and Harry doesn’t know what to do with. Harry needs to sit down. He needs to sit down and understand what Draco had been going on about and the implications left to hang in the air like traps.
Draco’s finger wipes away spit from Harry’s bottom lip. “Mine, I don’t even know where you live.”
Right now, as he slowly wraps his head around the fact that Remus called Voldemort a
. But Draco seems to be a different sort from Harry’s usual types and experiences. “I don’t know.” He decides to be truthful. “I feel like I have kind of sucked at dating until now, so not sure. Just see how it goes, maybe?”
, even the ever so noisy
The Dark Mark is still so stark on Draco’s arm.
Hermione huffs from her hospital bed. “Maybe, but she’s
The high-pitched screams of the people before them don’t dither Harry from getting into the seat after them. Draco gets in and sits down slower, more carefully than Harry had, though he is looking rather distrustfully at the handlebar that comes down and straps them to their seat. When the ride starts Harry glances excitedly at Draco from the corner of his eye.
A part of Harry misses the barrage of questions and suggestions.
“I told you.” Harry swallows, coughs. His throat is sore from all the screaming.
The apartment Ron and Hermione now share is homely. The colors are warm and there are many pictures lining the walls, from Ron and Hermione’s childhoods, to moments captured during their school years. Harry looks at the picture they have put above the fireplace, one that someone took not long after Voldemort fell, where all three of them are clutching onto each other, dirty and crying.
it. Though, even without his help everything seems to be working out nicely enough. Hermione even let Draco hold Rose for a little while, was even more amused when the little girl puked all over Draco.
They share a moment together. Hermione shuffles out of the living room and sits next to Ron, leans on the man’s shoulder as she hides a yawn behind her hand. The witch is sleep-soft and slow, everything about her warm and calm yet again. She reaches out to hold Harry’s hand in her own, a reminder that they will always be the Golden Trio, always together and there for each other no matter what.
The pause stretches on. Harry fidgets with his fingers.
? What are you talking about? I just saw a couple of lines about how hard it was then, because of Voldemort and your father.”
The door to his stop opens and the bell rings again. Ron’s quiet greeting is muffled, but Harry hears it anyway. He doesn’t step away from the journal and simply waits for his best friend to come to him. Ron’s fiery red hair contrasts harshly against the muted, dark colors of the repair shop.
Harry hums. “Well, I’m not sure, as I haven’t worked with books this curse damaged before. I want to say two weeks, maybe three? Something thereabouts.”
“Well I wasn’t the one who told me, and I quote, we got to this hospital, or I end your life, Ronald Bilius Weasley. You know I’m still learning.” Ron dutifully keeps the icepack on his eye.
“Same as always, thanks.”
Draco crosses one leg over the other as he sips his own drink. It smells like cinnamon. “Yes, well, they reminded mother too much of father. She let a cousin that likes birds have them and they are much happier there, from what I last heard.”
Draco takes this in with thoughtful silence. It stretches between them for uncomfortably long.
“No need to hurry.” Draco says back, softly.
Hermione doesn’t answer anything back, but the kettle whistles sharply, so she must have done just as Ron suggested. Soon there is a cup of tea in Harry’s hands, cookies on the tiny table before him and Hermione’s far too knowing look directed his way.
There are no more peacocks grazing in the lush gardens.
Hermione is quiet. With age and everything that they have lived though she has thawed out the need to know and ask a million questions, sometimes. Right now she just sits back and listens, content to let Harry work out the tiny details, the words that not always come out right.
“Of course, Malfoy.”
Ron ambles back into the living room, hair wet and water dripping on his shirt. “Should we be talking about numb nipples right now?” He scowls down at Hermione. “There is a child in the room and all that.”
Despite the need to check up on his friends Harry doesn’t do that. Ron and Hermione have their hands full with Rose, with Hermione still recovering from the birth, with learning how to care of a newborn.
“Now who’s playing dirty, huh?” Harry thinks his breath is wet against the curve of Draco’s neck. He wants to bite it, leave indents of his teeth there as well, for all to see.
changes nothing.”
“For me to restore it to what it used to be before, pages and text, I need to dismantle the wards and spells on it. Because of the damage, physical and magical, I’d need to get rid of
Harry is still tired. Tired of old, schooltime spats started by childish jealousy and foolish pride. He had forgiven Draco a long time ago. So, he simply smiles politely, the way sellers and shopkeepers smile when they greet a new customer. “Hello, Malfoy. How can I help you? If it’s about a request that has been made a while back, I will need the case number to check if it’s already done or not.”
Ron falls into a chair with a sigh. “Don’t get me started on that. I’m glad they have kept me on paperwork while Rose is still little and I’m not out chasing some Polish contraband smuggler.”
It’s a good day, even with the rain.
, his
Draco has finally looked Harry in the eye, the grey of his irises strangely sharp and bright in the shadows of the shop. Harry doesn’t react at the intensity of the gaze, the evaluation of his truthfulness and trustworthiness that is taking place. He just sighs. Why is it so hard for some people to let go of the things that happened at Hogwarts, the things that matter even less now than when they happened.
Harry curls into an uncomfortable chair and bites into the tiny pie that Draco’s house elf brought out for them. He can’t seem to look away from Draco, can’t stop thinking about the unexpected happiness that has seeped into his bloodstream unnoticed. Nothing is fixed, but the jagged edges inside of him have been smoothed out just enough to feel the difference.
Harry doesn’t quite understand himself why it sometimes hurts to see Remus, why he feels guilty for being the reason why the older wizard is the only one left alive from the Marauders. Maybe it’s the dark thing inside of him, maybe it’s the stupid hero complex that Ginny still teases Harry about, that makes Harry wonder if all of this mess could have been prevented if he simply wasn’t.
“You’ll like it! It’s gonna be like flying on a broom.” Harry pulls Draco towards one of the looping tracks that rise high in the sky.
Pleased as a cat Harry tiptoes his fingertips over Draco’s chest, rests his palms in a loose hold around the man’s neck. “I am a menace.”
miss those days. When you got into one of your Malfoy moods it was like watching a gay train wreck, even if little, icky younger me didn’t know a thing about gays.” Ron balls up the paper takeout bag and lobs it at Harry’s head, laughing louder when the throw hits target straight on. “Besides, what’s better than an existential crisis and having the money to fund it?”
. I knew both of your parents through their awkward flirting and crushing phases, I do recognize them in you enough to notice these things. And teenagers are not as smooth as they think they are.” Remus taps his nose once.
Ron merely sticks his tongue out at Harry. Hermione calls them both children.
The man’s fingers are slender and shake slightly when he retrieves the leather-bound book. It looks burned, the cover and page corners curled up into themselves. Draco handles it gently, carefully he lays it before Harry on the desk that has the bookkeeping journal and an old cash register on it.
Draco tastes like cherries.
The sun rises slowly and Harry watches as the world becomes brighter by the second. He wonders if he will also be able to do that, one day.
carved into her skin, covered by a tattoo of vines crawling along her arm. It’s a baseless fear, one that Harry knows should no longer matter, he should get help for at some point, but it’s still there. It makes his hands tremble and heart beat faster than normal.
“You sure you want to touch that?” Draco asks. His tone makes it seem like the mark is disgusting, dogshit that someone has smeared over his skin.
“I will be most honored to.” Remus kisses Tonks’ forehead.
“Malfoy.”
“You sound like daddy when mommy scolds him, uncle Harry.” Teddy giggles where he has hidden his face in Harry’s armpit. “And then mommy makes this long
“Even with that, yes.” Harry feels sad, just so very sad. “And I doubt that you let it be put on, not when you had that monster living in your home.”
The kitchen is cool. Harry mumbles the incantation for a heating charm as his bare feet pad across the cold wood.
Sleep is another thing that sometimes just doesn’t come and Harry spends the night sitting on the porch of his tiny cottage and watching the stars, holding onto a warm cup of tea just to feel like he really is
“How long?” Draco finally asks.
“Hey, mate! I brought lunch! Merlin’s balls, though, eating here with that supervisor of yours was damn
as it moves on its own. Some of the machines look to be muggle, but ones that don’t use electricity and are worked by hand. On one shelf there are various jars of paints and brushes, glass containers with various potions, all new and restocked recently. Harry recognizes some of them, vaguely, and only thanks to the quick and easy lessons during his training courses. They didn’t get too deep when talking about potion usage for certain types of book damage.
Trauma and fear are things that cannot be compared.
Draco swallows and his Adam’s apple bobs. He’s still pale, though the shadows playing on his skin and the white shine of his hair make the wizard seem sickly. There is something fragile to Draco. It’s in the way his shoulders stay tensed up, the immaculate posturing, the lips that have been bitten a painful red.
Draco looks better when he smiles, a true one and not the politely cold smile of a pureblood. The wizard then takes his journal and smooths his palm over the cover, as if to keep his hands full and busy. “Even worse.” It’s teasing - unusual but not unwelcome. “Thank you, for this as well, Potter.”
Draco relaxes and leans his shoulder against the doorframe and sighs. The same confidence that Harry associates him with has returned. “Sure, yeah.” He pauses, then shakes his head. “This is so bloody weird.”
“What you wrote to me. It’s true, yes?” Draco asks. The question is very familiar.
“She looks like a dried raisin.” Harry is holding the newborn carefully, as per the nurse’s instructions.
The wind that blows is chilly, but Harry doesn’t even notice it. He finally laughs, a quiet and surprised thing that seems to catch Draco off-guard as well. Perhaps it’s what was needed to break the awkward tension, the awkward fumbling around, not knowing how to proceed and what is the right thing to say.
“Draco is scared of your mum.” Harry grins.
After a few more rides Harry buys himself some cotton candy, which Draco accepts small bites from with a suspicious glance at the fluffy sweet. They walk around enjoying the atmosphere, watch the teenagers having the time of their lives and older couples enjoying themselves with the slightly rigged prize games. Draco talks more about what had gone after his father’s passing while Harry opens up about his slowly growing dislike towards some parts of the wizarding world.
Ron raises his eyebrows. “Our Malfoy? And he was fine with you working on his stuff? Huh…” He squints at his bottle of butterbeer in hopes there is some left.
and not drifting away.
“Never heard of her.” Ron has licked off the crumbs from the corner of his mouth and is already eating another biscuit. “Do you know what you should do? This yogi thing that Hermione does now. It’s all about breathing and funny poses.”
The witch speaks in a rather loud voice, her English accented in a way that Harry does not recognize, but it feels familiar and heard. She reminds him of McGonagall, with the way that Levante doesn’t seem to care of Harry’s supposed achievements and fame, but only the work he already has and will put in.
It’s a letter that Harry has no intention of sending. It’s too personal for both him
Hunger is evident in the way Draco grins, the darkening of his gaze. His fingers are gentle as they tangle into Harry’s hair, firm when they tilt his head back just enough for a better angle. “I don’t know, should I?” Draco kisses Harry’s jaw, then on the lips once more.
is not enough to get him through the night. He turns around, tries to see where Kreacher has left the candles that Harry uses on nights like these. The location is always the same, but Harry always looks for them anyway.
The storm rages on and the clock ticks past three in the morning. Harry drinks his tea and wonders if he will ever manage to sleep through a storm again. His glasses are too tight on the bridge of his nose, so Harry pushes them up, wrinkles his nose when the scent of rain protrudes in every nook and cranny of Cliffside Lookout. Refreshing. Like a new start, the old washed clean of dust. It’s strange, but Harry doesn’t much enjoy the scent. Something about it feels fake.
They hug. Harry holds tightly onto Remus, gathers himself and then pulls away. Remus rolls his eyes and ruffles Harry’s hair, making it even more messy than it already was. There is something unsaid in the soft, warm way that Remus regards Harry, something that doesn’t need to be put into words. Harry waves as he leaves, refreshed and light, wondering about the next visit to the Lupin family. His family.
The snort that Draco makes is the furthest thing from attractive. The man covers his face with one hand, his shoulder shake with laughter. “
Tonks grins wide and happy, Teddy now placed comfortably on her hip. “You better, babe.” She then turns to Harry and winks. “Heard you’re doing good at the new workplace? Ron’s acting like a proud dad at work, that tosser.”
The shop is as quiet as always.
When evening settles in Harry walks into the dining room wearing only a long, button-down shirt of Draco’s and nothing else. Draco can’t seem to look away from his legs.
The blanket falls on the floor, with their clothes and wands. Harry gasps and arches off the bed when Draco gets low enough, grins against his hip and promises to make it good, make it
When Harry is allowed to visit, the only one Hermione had trusted to be allowed to come to the muggle hospital she chose to give birth in, together with her own parents, he first sees the witch grinning down wide and amazed at the sleeping bundle in her arms. Hermione is still sweaty and her hair a mess, bare legs open wide under the blanket and her feet hanging out the sides.
“Tosser!”
Harry likes how the elderly witch talks about the books and the craft. He had gone through training, of course, but being in the presence of someone that clearly thinks the world of the profession is a different feeling. A different take on the job.
to get rid of the bags and containers. He sighs before getting back to work, no longer in as happy a mood as he was in while his best friend was around. The journal is a tricky thing with too many spells melted into one mess, made worse by whatever had been done to it and the passage of time.
“Ron! Why is there jam in my sugar pot?”
A couple more hours and Harry smooths his hand over the cover of the journal, now clean of any kind of damage. He has restored the original and only charms, the ones that keep thoughts hidden and private, let only Draco see the insides of the memories and thoughts put inside the pages for safekeeping. The journal hums with magic, calm and simple.
Remus sips his tea, then mutters angrily under his nose when some gets on his mustache. Harry hides his laugh behind his own cup, one that is chipped and glued together with superglue despite being a part of a home where two fully grown magic users live. But it gives the Lupin home its comfortable feeling, the kind of warmth that Harry enjoys immensely.
Something not quite like hesitation flashes over Draco’s face. Maybe fear. The man swallows, clears his throat. “I, uh, we… Have yet to talk about it?”
Harry bounces Teddy on his knees and looks down in slight shame. “Sorry. Force of habit.”
Draco jumps at the words, scowls Harry’s way. “It’s not
“Well, he and his mum have had pretty shitty after-war years. The aurors still need to go and do check-ups on them, like, once every three months to make sure they are behaving. Though, with Malfoy senior gone they aren’t as concerned anymore, from what I hear through gossip.” Ron burps rather loudly. He leans back in the rickety chair and sighs long and drawn-out, having had his fill.
The pile on top of the
“My house or yours?” Harry gasps when they pull apart, laughs at how messy the man before him has become.
It doesn’t matter if the other wizard reads it, matters less if there is a reply to it. To Harry what matters most is that he has put his forgiveness onto paper, made it physical and real and sent it away. He was being true when he told Draco that is has been years since they were on different sides of the war, or so it seemed to them at the time, and he has forgotten, forgiven, moved on. But some things need to be told more specifically, with more than just a vague statement.
Somehow Harry has managed to summon paper and pen to himself, both of which now lay in his lap, waiting to be used. The first questions Harry scribbles onto the paper with messy letters, lines shaky as the fear has not fully gone away. But the more Harry writes the easier it gets, the questions turning into confessions and wonderings about just how much Draco could relate to Harry, and other way around as well, perhaps.
Harry frowns down at a couple of pages that have been damaged particularly bad, trying hard to make sure the magic is a constant,
All the horribly sarcastic replies that spring to Harry’s mind are lost to the raw
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose. It’s been a rather long week, adjusting to Teddy and Teddy adjusting to him. Aside from figuring out just what all a toddler needs and how to care for one, Harry has also been struggling through the swinging grief and confusion that Teddy began to endure once he seemed to realize that he wasn’t going home to Andromeda. He’s hard to put to sleep, hard to wake, hard to convince to eat, and more than a dozen times already Harry has found himself just hugging a sobbing Teddy as they both try to figure things out together. All that on top of his training has Harry barely conscious at any given moment.
"I don't want to hurt you."
it was, it is, how indifferent he really feels about them all being gone now, how it feels like a chance at real change, how free he feels. After an entire childhood spent performing like an animal for his parents to award him a single pat to the head, a hasty kiss to the cheek, Draco wonders, fears,
Harry staves off a groan. Of
Nothing.
“I, er...I’m surprised you’re here,” Harry says awkwardly.
"Did I?" Harry asked. He hadn't remembered that. But with his haphazard sleeping habits, he supposed it wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility. "Hey, Hermione, could I borrow your Herbology notes?"
Groaning, Draco lifts his head to finally look at Tom directly. “You sound like a motivational banner.”
“Honestly, Ginny, you ought to have least worn your hair down,” Mrs. Weasley frets somewhere behind Harry. “You look far too severe with it pulled back like that.”
"Not in the hospital wing. Before all this." Harry sighed and set down his fork, giving up on the eggs that sat like stones in his stomach. "I went for a walk after hours one night and found Malfoy in the Astronomy Tower. We talked. He thinks he deserves to be attacked regularly."
Eyes locked with green in a silent battle for dominance, Draco glares for longer than is strictly sane before curiosity gets the better of him.
Draco watched her eat her way through her cereal as he sipped his coffee, not really seeing her. He couldn't
Certainly he isn’t invited in any case. This is clearly a blanket flyer. It’s being mass-distributed and not even by magic. The wizard shuffling down the corridor likely doesn’t even know Draco lives here.
Terror gripped Draco's heart, squeezing it tight in his chest as he began to struggle for breath. But he could only take a few weak gasps for air when the little girl shouted, "
Hermione sat down in the empty seat beside Harry, eyeing him worriedly as she reached to finish buttering the toast he had abandoned.
Draco nodded, his head still hanging down. Now that his world had returned to normal, hot shame filled his belly. Nothing had happened to cause such a reaction. Nothing ever happened to truly cause these episodes that sprinkled over his past several months, but never before had Draco a witness.
"Ouch."
The last of his family, dead.
“Ha-wee!” Teddy is already on Harry’s leg, squeezing tight to try and pull himself into a real embrace. Harry obliges, sniffing carefully to try and place the aroma around them. “Ha’ee birday!”
The cut was along all four of Malfoy's fingers, slicing downward but hardly deep. Harry sighed with relief. He could fix this. He pulled out his wand and aimed it at the wounds.
said about him needing to catch on to the basics and him not controlling his magic?”
"Okay, this is definitely impossible."
A tall woman with a square jaw stood and waved to the continuing applause.
"Move over," he whispered through another yawn.
“Come on,” a soft voice breathes somewhere in the darkness, close.
"Malfoy, hey. What's...what's up?" A pause. "You alright?"
"You're being childish."
"He could have turned things around for us, but instead he dragged us through hell, and it was up to my mother to drag us back from it." Bitterness coated every word.
"Er...what are mollies?"
"Well, Ron would have been asleep for a week after being up all night and two days," she said, tipping some eggs onto Harry's plate alongside the toast. "But you've always been different when it comes to stress and sleep."
Luna smiled vaguely as she stepped around Harry to continue browsing the shelf. "Mollies are tiny, beautiful creatures that are strictly male. They have a powerful magic that invokes love and lust."
"Are you alright?" Harry asked. "Did you not...was it not...?"
Tom chortles, an honest
Draco stepped into the nearest bathroom to clean himself up a bit. There wasn't as much blood as he had assumed, much to his relief, and though his nose didn't appear to be visibly broken, Draco was likely to have a wicked bruise on the bridge the following day. He splashed some water on his face and wiped the blood from his skin. His hands shook.
Harry wasn't sure who was more shocked - Draco or himself. He had let himself into Andromeda's house as she had requested in her letter from the day before, but nothing could have prepared him for walking in on his enemy-turned-boyfriend playing on the floor with his godson.
"I wouldn't if I were you," said a tall boy with dirty blonde hair. He was a Hufflepuff, and if the acne was anything to go by, at least two years younger than Draco, who rolled his eyes.
“Not since I’ve had him,” Harry says, thinking quickly. “But I think he went to the park today and is a little more tired than usual.”
“Coming!” Harry calls, struggling to his feet on jelly legs with Teddy like a boulder in his arms. He hurries to the door, giving Teddy a little shake. “Teddy? Teddy, wake up. The Care-Seekers are here.”
"What on earth were you thinking? Not only are you out of bed after hours, you are out of bounds, and drinking, no less!" She sighed. "What were you thinking?"
Having to grind through my entire damn childhood with a wizard whose job it is to go through those memories and point out why everything in them is
"Well, yeah."
"You know," Draco rasped after a moment, "that was...this is excessively messier than I...than I thought it'd be."
Draco hadn't said it back, but still.
"I'm feeling the love."
Teddy just grunts and turns his face from Harry, snuggling closer. Once Teddy started sleeping better, which has
“Hush, I think they’re about to start.”
“Ah...” With a frown, Draco looks over at Harry. He looks back just as uncertain as how to answer. They haven’t spoken at all about what will happen when Draco’s lease is completed. It was mentioned at the very beginning that finding a place with a bedroom for each of them might be in the plans, but that was a whole month prior to moving in together at all.
Teddy only purses his lips, twists in his chair to face away from the bowl entirely.
"Yes, Mrs. Weasley," Harry said. "Not a drop, I swear."
"Why were you and Hermione late, anyway?"
"I already have them." She pulled out a small vial filled with green. "It should only take a minute or two to do this properly."
Malfoy laughed humorlessly. "I guess you could say I quit for the same reasons, but if I were honest with myself, I resigned to save whatever pride I have left. Even my own House wouldn't want me representing them, I have no doubt."
"I've talked with him."
"Malfoy, look at me." Nothing. "Malfoy!"
"How does that work?" Harry asked, feeling vaguely alarmed at the idea. "We're not...we're not going to make a baby by brewing this thing, are we?"
Reaching over and grabbing Teddy himself, Draco draws the boy into his own lap, stands tiny feet on his thighs to catch his eye. “Teddy, are you full or still hungry?”
Harry rested his head in his hands at breakfast Thursday morning, trying to keep himself awake so he wouldn't be late to Potions while also wishing he could just fall asleep there at the table. He hadn't slept much since Draco had officially broke things off with him and shoved him in the corridor, but Harry had been true to his word to Professor McGonagall and hadn't left his dormitory at night anymore. It was bad enough when Harry had been filled with a righteous fury over being rejected for something he saw as trivial, but now Harry was actually listening to Hermione and the headmistress, being mature and giving Draco the space he obviously wanted.
Twenty minutes later when Ron and Hermione entered the classroom, Harry ignored them. He was still so furious with them that he didn't notice Malfoy sitting beside him until he spoke.
Draco smiles. “See you tomorrow, little one.”
“I’m so sorry, little one,” he whispers into Teddy’s shoulder. “I didn’t mean to scare you. I...I never want to frighten you. You know I love you very much, yes?”
“Thanks again, Fleur,” Harry says, turning back to her.
Thankfully, Ron and Hermione had been prepared, it seemed, and they had booted each of these particular fans from the compartment without tact. Harry hadn't been able to properly articulate his gratitude, but he felt confident that they knew. When the train stopped and the trio had found a carriage, it had been an intoxicating relief to be among true friends.
Harry snaps his head around at Mr. Cook’s voice. He’s peeking out of his office, waving a hand at him with a somber sort of grin.
“Just...” Malfoy exhales. “Let’s get you in the bath, alright? Can we do that while we talk?”
"I..." Draco sounded a bit dazed. "Yes?"
Harry bloody Potter had no right, absolutely no right.
Now Harry was hours into deep research, and most of his nearly-complete essay was just fabricated facts that he had been too impatient to properly find in the library books. At least Ron's was just as horrible, Harry thought as his eyes strayed from his parchment and to the nearby fireplace.
But, with a copy of the contract rolled up in his robes several minutes later, that’s how Draco finds himself signing his name under Potter’s. As of 11:48 that brisk Saturday morning in late March, they two are legally bound by the Ministry of Magic itself to work together for just over fourteen months. There is no deadline for Potter to be approved for full guardianship, leaving their entire arrangement hanging on the rocky promise that Draco and Potter can play nice enough, long enough to keep Teddy from being given to a family of strangers. Little fingers grip Draco’s robes as he signs his name alongside his bitterest rival, reminding him that if it means keeping Teddy, Draco can make this work, Potter be damned.
"Yeah..."
"Oh, Merlin," she gasped softly. "I...I wouldn't even know where to begin, Harry...I...I just don't know how to help, especially since we don't know what caused it."
Draco.”
Heat filled Harry's cheeks, though he wasn't sure if it was caused by Draco hearing that Harry had told Hermione about his feelings for him or if Harry was just thinking about the morning they had shared.
Harry stepped quietly around the corner that gave way to the Astronomy Tower steps. Professor Carraway, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was on nighttime patrol that evening, and she apparently took her position far more seriously than the other teachers. She prowled without a lantern, keeping quiet as she crept around the school, making it hard to listen for her and avoid detection. Harry had seen her a corridor or two away and only just passed her without raising the alarm.
Fuck it.
"Well, the Ministry doesn't legally have any real authority over the papers, though I quite agree with you. But you ought to know that there is no actual investigation happening. No one with any reason could truly believe that Mr. Malfoy or his mother would risk imprisonment simply to befriend you."
"That was more a comment about the state of my arse, not the size of your dick."
When the tea was all gone and only a couple sandwiches remained, Harry and Draco were stretched out on their stomachs on the floor, letting Teddy crawl all over and in between them. He was far more active than the last time Harry had seen him, when Teddy wasn't yet five months old and seemed to specialize in staring. Now he was less baby and more toddler, moving and trying to walk and grabbing at absolutely everything within reach. Such a happy baby, Harry thought as Teddy grinned up at him.
“No. No hungee.” Teddy crosses his arms, turns his nose up at the noodles in front of him, and it takes each and every ounce of Harry’s self control not to scream with frustration.
"Still good?" Harry asked.
“Oh.” Teddy’s faces falls, but he does finally stand up, reach out to be held. It breaks Harry’s heart every time he has to remind Teddy that his old home, his family, everything he knew before last week, is now gone.
“Look,” Harry begins. “Everything is going perfect-” A very familiar shriek filters through the cracked door. “-ly.” He grimaces. “Dammit...I’m sorry, Ron.”
Sighing, Draco drains the wine. “How could anyone expect to be happy where I am?”
"Thank you."
“Wh-” Potter shuts the door behind them and hurries over to snag Draco’s arm, halting his advance further into the flat. Not that he would have gotten far. The place is obscenely crowded. How is Teddy expected to grow in such a space? Draco wrenches his arm away from Potter before a true grip can be made.
A thunderous sound exploded ahead of them, somewhere around the corner.
“You were right about the park,” Harry repeats flatly. May as well own it, he thinks. “Teddy turned a set of stairs into a slide and got another kid hurt. The mum was frantic, thought the country was going to the bin. So we left, but Teddy was screaming like a lunatic so it looked like I was kidnapping him. So you were right. I shouldn’t have taken him.”
It took nearly ten minutes but Harry finally reached the portrait hole and climbed in (after angrily shushing a curious Fat Lady) and sneaked into his dormitory. He slowly laid Malfoy out on his bed and glanced around. It was too dark to see, but Harry could hear the calm snores of Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus from behind their curtains. He breathed a sigh of relief.
Malfoy just continued to stir.
"Bloody great," Harry snapped.
"Your mum wouldn't want you to be sad on her account."
"It's not very different from raising a normal baby, really. It just affects how often I can take him around muggles," she said with a shrug. Andromeda took the tin from Draco's hands and turned to his mother. "Come, Narcissa. I'll find a home for whatever this is and you can help me make some tea. You play nice with my grandson, Draco, you hear?"
There was an uproar at the nearby Gryffindor table, and Draco's heartrate easily doubled. Sense couldn't be made from the shouts that erupted, but Draco knew fury when he heard it.
“I believe you knew of the arrangement between the Malfoy and Tonks families?”
It’s Monday evening.
Burying his face into Draco’s legs, Teddy pulls at the robes there to cover his face, shield himself from view.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Quite a way with words, haven't you? Do us both a favor and fuck off already. As I said before, I have better things to be doing."
Harry's stomach churned at the thought of Ginny. It had been weeks since they last spoke, but the memory of that last conversation still played uncomfortably in his mind when his memories clouded him too much to sleep at night.
Harry’s chest caves in minutely. There’s pressure pushing outward in the cavity of his ribcage, and the air feels thicker for how hard it suddenly is to take in. He shifts to sit up straighter.
"Oh, shut it." Annoyance flashed across Malfoy's face as he made to turn away. Harry reached out and grabbed his hand before he could think twice about it.
It was to help Malfoy, really. Harry couldn't just leave him to sleep on a freezing floor at the top of the Astronomy Tower. But he also couldn't get into the Slytherin common room and hope to find which bed was Malfoy's in the dark. Too, Gryffindor Tower was drastically closer, and Harry could get inside.
“And this is an orange star.”
“Once upon a time,” Planters says, “there was little Aurors needed to know about the place. You capture the dark witch or wizard, take them there, and leave them in the spindly hands of the dementors. Now, the Ministry is in the final stages of creating an entire subdepartment to fill the prison with Aurors of a special caliber to maintain the facility properly.”
"Harry," she said, shaking her head slightly. "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but no platonic friend would carry their friend, asleep, halfway across the castle and crawl into bed with them. That's not how friendship works, at least not with boys. I mean, what would you have done if you found Ron asleep somewhere in the castle?"
Hermione put her hand over his, though Harry suspected it was mostly to protect the stems. "You didn't read the article, did you?"
Ginny stepped over to them, holding her own glass of champagne, though hers was mostly full and likely only her first or second. She met Harry's eyes and smiled. It had been well over a year since their official break up and argument in the Hogwarts courtyard, and Harry was pleased with how far they had come. It had taken Harry graduating and them enjoying some distance, but by Ginny's seventh year Christmas, things had become familial again, much to Harry's relief.
"What makes you say that?"
Encouraged, Harry shifted his hips and pressed down more deliberately.
“Go on, Mr. Malfoy. Step careful.”
“Potter-”
with the absolute waste of space, Potter managed to make Draco’s horrific situation even worse.
A warm breeze swept by, tickling the scabs that freckled his exposed arms. The Astronomy Tower was among the tallest points at Hogwarts, giving way to what many would consider to be a breathtaking view of the Forbidden Forest and distant mountains. For Draco, however, the Astronomy Tower only gave way to one of his most haunting memories.
“Oh, come on, Draco, let loose a little. It’s just a sauce.”
"Well, maybe together we can do a little better at moving on than we have alone."
"It might be, yes." The Fat Lady swung open her portrait, and Harry felt himself being gently pushed through. "Now off to bed with you. And if I catch you out of bed after hours again, I
He had spent all of Friday night and the entirety of Saturday at Malfoy's side in the hospital wing, watching anxiously as the bruising gradually faded from his face. Madam Pomfrey had been uncharacteristically patient with Harry's vigil, but when she had found Harry slumped over in his chair as the sun set Saturday evening, she had kicked him from the wing and insisted that he catch some sleep in his own dormitory.
“You hardly know him. You think a few hours here and there are enough for you to properly care for a living, breathing child day in and day out? It’ll be a miracle he doesn’t starve.”
“What? I do,” Harry says, making a face. “Besides, I work tomorrow. I couldn’t force him to eat those noodles even if I wanted to anymore.”
Malfoy had been nothing but a total pain in his backside for seven years, but Harry couldn't believe that someone truly evil would wear so much fear so often. No, Harry had more or less come to the conclusion in his time since the war that Malfoy, though hardly an excuse for his choices, was just another victim of the war Voldemort began over fifty years ago.
Between accidentally Apparating to the manor’s old plot almost daily, keeping up with his work at the Apothecary, and worrying about Teddy, Draco finds himself rapidly becoming an insomniac. The days following his brief meeting with Ms. Dribble have been excruciatingly endless. Time drags on and on in ways he never believed possible. How long is he expected to wait for Potter to miraculously grow a brain?
Harry laughed, and they quickly dressed and washed up a bit before stepping out into the hallway.
hungry.”
He heard footsteps running down the corridor. Harry's hand search Malfoy's chest, finding torn fabric and a long scratch across a sunken-in and pale chest. Hand quivering slightly, Harry reached into the fabric and pressed his hand to the chest in search of a heartbeat. It took only seconds, but he found one, faint though steady. He sighed, and Luna stood up to turn her attention to the sixth years.
"But Malfoy kind of turned that around. Even before you guys were talking and I...well, before I really noticed it, I could tell that something about being back here was bringing you out of the cloud you had over you all summer. I thought it was just being back at Hogwarts, but I think it was something about Malfoy all along."
"Have you seen Malfoy?"
Which was why he had excused himself in the middle of his Ancient Runes lesson the second Tuesday after break to use the bathroom in peace. But peace didn't come with his return journey.
"You are completely insufferable."
“Move?”
“Wow,” Harry says dully. He sets out a small bowl of yogurt for Teddy, removes the plate of enchiladas and adds it to his own. “How very...you.”
“Malfoy’s totally mental, I swear. I don’t know how you stay sane.”
“He’s quite busy-” Harry tries.
"What?" Harry looked up from Malfoy's lips. "No, that was Crouch."
No more parks for a while. Teddy will just have to settle for the times they enjoy the grassy meadows outside their flat with just Harry and Draco for company until he’s older.
It had been a rather enjoyable ride, sharing a compartment with Harry, Weasley, and Granger, whom Draco had grown comfortable enough with to call Hermione. The hours had been whittled away with easy conversation and various games of Exploding Snap and wizarding chess, which Draco had always been rather good at, much to Weasley's unpleasant surprise. But most importantly, Draco had been able to bask in Harry's company without issue or worry.
"Finally!"
Show time.
“Plenty are,” Tom says as he replenishes the wine. “There are a lot more might even envy you for the security. Regular money, somethin’ to do durin’ the day.”
"Sit down, Harry," Hermione said, yanking him down into Ron's abandoned chair. Harry's new seat, one that faced almost directly away from Draco, was likely to be both a blessing and a curse no matter how the next few days went.
Harry pretends not to have heard Ms. Dribble, waving them both in with a smile. “Come on in.”
Draco's mother had tried for weeks to convince him that his father had done everything he had to try and protect them. Perhaps he had, but Draco knew that if his father hadn't been so weak, so prideful, so pathetic as to have ever been in the Dark Lord's service, the past seventeen years could have been so different. Even if Draco had still been raised to be the snarky little arsehole that he was, the Malfoy name wouldn't have been drug through the mud that now clung to Draco's every molecule. Had his father actually changed his ways after the Dark Lord's disappearance all those years ago instead of just pretending, maybe Draco wouldn't have been thrust into the positions he had been. Maybe he would have grown to be less of the evil prat that deserved every ounce of loathing that he knew was coming his way the second he stepped onto the train the next morning.
"You're going to stand there and tell me you didn't enjoy every one of those teeth sinking into you?"
Malfoy removed the ladle, allowing the potion to simmer, and looked at Harry. It struck Harry just how exhausted Malfoy looked, being this close. His pale eyes were rimmed in red and skin tinged in grey hung in deep bags beneath. His left eye that Harry had noticed was swollen at the feast had developed into a full blown black eye the day before, and it only looked worse for wear today now that the swelling was mostly gone, giving the discolored skin there a deflated appearance. Pale skin hung from his high cheekbones and his lips hardly held any color, giving Malfoy a very haunted appearance. Which, Harry realized, was probably not only the best description for Malfoy's appearance, but also the very cause.
Malfoy nodded minutely and silently began to set up his cauldron. Harry hesitated for a moment before going to the store cupboard to collect their ingredients. It took only a few minutes, the potion requiring so few items. Before long, Harry had returned to the desk, where Malfoy had the cauldron near boiling already. Neither said anything as Harry laid out his haul.
“Moh-ming, Daco.”
Teddy gives him away. But as Draco’s frown turns to him, Harry tries to appear nonchalant. “It wasn’t a
"Damn."
"Come. We have quite a few staircases to climb."
“Does he just not let you know? Maybe you ought to try reminding him instead?”
His flat is dark and quiet. The silence reminds him of the manor growing up, how it always sounded unless he was practicing his violin. It was the only thing that would slice through the tensions that lingered in the stagnant air. Feeling his hands beginning to shake, Draco tears open a window to allow a breeze.
"Now why not?"
the little boy that makes everything
"What?"
Malfoy's eyes were slightly narrowed as he stared down at their hands, and it seemed to take a great effort for him to force his eyes up to meet Harry's when he answered. "Uh...no. I can find anything I could ever want at Hogwarts. I just thought I'd check the place out is all. Didn't want to go anywhere too crowded."
“This lazing attitude is why you failed Potions.”
"Oh."
"Damn," he said after a moment. "I think that was my last quill."
"Can I get some real sleep tonight, you think?"
"I was talking to you."
“I know you will be, dear.”
"Well, it's what amounts to the wizarding world's version of surrogacy."
"I think maybe you just haven't been listening to me for the past seven years."
A cold hand gripped Draco's then, and he tried to open his eyes. Blinding light assaulted him, intensifying all the worst sensations he had been experiencing since finding consciousness. His whimpered involuntarily, eyes falling closed again.
"It's going well." And only because he thought it rude not to, he asked, "How's...uhm, how's Teddy been?"
Ms. Dribble frowns. “Does he often take a nap so late in the day?”
“Oh, your stupidity is only matched by your ignorance, Potter! I will not-” Draco shifts and feels Potter’s arm still bracing him against the wall. “Get off me.”
Terror seized Harry, springing him into action. He lunged across the tower, crossing the surface in barely a second. His arms thrust forward and wrapped around Malfoy's chest. For one terrible moment, Harry thought his momentum would send them both tumbling over the ledge, but he was able to plant his feet and swing himself back, dragging Malfoy with him. In his desperation, Harry had thrown his entire body into the action and the force sent him crashing painfully into the stone floor, sliding him a few feet as Malfoy's body crashed on top of his with a surprised grunt.
It’s 4:28.
There was a general murmur of agreement. Slughorn grinned and disappeared into his office. He returned a moment later pushing three large cauldrons on a cart. Strange and strong smells filled the room, simultaneously singeing and caressing Harry's nose. He fought a sneeze.
“Mmmm, I remember when my own did that. Drove my wife crazy,” Mr. Cook chuckles. “And eating? I know you had your concerns there at first, Harry. How’s he doing now?”
Harry was right. Draco did seem to sleep better there than his own bed.
"It would just defy logic and the justice system. I know it used to be all over the place," she said, correctly interpreting Harry's frown, "but I have a lot more faith in it now that Kingsley's Minister of Magic. Besides, if they were doing any of the things that are being whispered around, there'd be more than just one vague article about it."
"I used to read a lot," Malfoy said after a second. "Now that I...uh...have more time, I thought I'd pick it back up."
"She seems to be making friends better than she originally thought she would."
His hands stop strumming, letting the final note hang in the air as he continues singing softly. Eyes leaving Harry, Draco offers a grin to Teddy.
“Will you just stop?” Draco snaps.
Hermione rolled her eyes as she bent over to press a soft kiss to Ron's mouth. "We were only gone maybe a half hour. And most of that was just getting to and from."
"But Draco," Hermione said tentatively from the doorway. "They're not-"
But Harry knew. He would never be able to rid Malfoy's terrified face from his mind. There wasn't even a particular time that Harry recalled each time. When Harry sliced him apart int he bathroom sixth year? When he caught Malfoy sobbing into the sink just moments before? When Harry saw through Volemort's eyes and saw Malfoy fighting tears under Professor Burbage's damaged body? When Malfoy entered the cellar last year? When Lucius turned a stern eye on his son in Flourish and Blotts before their second year? There was no end to the number of times Harry had seen that face.
Harry began to read, his voice confused and annoyed. "'Harry Potter, the Chosen One who defeated You-Know-Who nearing on eight months ago this New Year's, was spotted outside of this corner store near London accompanied by none other than Draco Malfoy, infamous teenage Death Eater and son of Narcissa and the late Lucius Malfoy, both of whom have long been known to be in You-Know-Who's Inner Circle. The photo clearly shows a companionship between the unlikely pair, but it is really as it appears?'"
Apparating just outside the front door about six minutes after four, Harry steps into the living room of the cottage. There are photos along the entry table, above the fireplace, mostly of Bill and Fleur and their families, but none of them do the justice for Fleur’s bulging belly that’s always growing, always a surprise when she turns to face Harry. She’s just as fiery but somehow more radiant, a mystery that Hermione thinks is both illogical and beautiful. Harry mostly thinks it’s bizarre how Fleur can hide an entire baby in the little hill at her front.
They each took one, Draco and Potter both immediately taking long drinks. Draco shivered slightly at the warmth. Awkward silence filled the table as they all seemed to be glancing at one another, daring someone to break it.
Draco didn't move. He hadn't been able to eat properly in nearly two years, and what little he did manage to choke down usually found its way back up again. The girl beside him wiped her eyes a few times but also didn't move to take any food.
Teddy falls back onto his bottom with a giggle. The smaller girl falls forward, though, and her chin smacks the wood with an audible pop before she slides the rest of the way down, crashing into Teddy with a tearful shout.
Harry, along with Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, and another 10-15 students of varying age and House had been brought together to go over certain students' criminal files. Not all those students accused of crimes had been given to the committee. Most had willingly and openly confessed, stubbornly defending their actions and more or less proclaiming devotion to Voldemort's ways. Those students had been charged and sentenced to a mandatory three years in Azkaban's newest juvenile facility. Some of those students had been as young as 14.
Charlie raised his brows at Harry, who only shrugged sheepishly in return, not knowing what to say. Reluctantly, he turned his eyes back to Ginny, but she had taken to glaring at her plate, hands firmly in her lap.
Harry grinned. "Absolutely."
Despite himself, Draco scoffed. "I find that a bit hard to believe."
Half an hour later, after splashing the coldest water he can draw from the tap onto his face and pulling on a fresh pair of navy robes, Draco stands outside the derelict building that houses his weekly torture. It’s a St. Mungo’s affiliate for all the mental health services, where all the therapies and similar for the wizarding world are addressed. All one needs is their wand and they can walk directly through the barricaded doors and into the office.
"How about I chop and you stir?" Harry suggested. Malfoy nodded again, and Harry set to work on the butterfly wings while Malfoy opened the moss oil. At least Malfoy seemed to be feeling better, if his steadied breathing was anything to go by, making things considerably less uncomfortable.
Draco moves to the kitchen, clattering quietly as he unloads a few things, opens the fridge. He returns a moment later, carrot sticks in hand and brow quirked.
"It'd be funnier to let them."
"Draco?" Harry's voice was right in his ear, Harry's hand over his under the desk. "Draco, breathe."
"If you-" Malfoy cut off as his eyes met Harry's, barely a foot between them with their hips touching. Harry swallowed and saw Malfoy do the same before speaking again, his voice a half-octave lower. "If you can read through these, I'll test the poisons. When I find something that...that catalyzes, you can tell me what the poison's ingredient is."
"He just thinks that staying away from us...staying away from me will keep his mum safe."
Feeling cheeky, Draco practically sings, “It’s worth it to for-” He hiccups. “-get what a piece o’ drag’n dung I ‘m, ‘arry. Even if jus’ for a few...a few hours.”
"Uh..." Harry gently shook Malfoy's shoulder and he spoke softly. "Malfoy?"
Professor McGonagall patted his arm. "Things will either work out or they won't, but you ought to give Mr. Malfoy more time than a few days to think things through and find out how his mother is doing."
"Don't talk to her like that!" Ron snaps. "And no. I'll let you go once we're inside your room." He drags me up the staircase.
"No problem, mate. I love you, you now?" He leaned back to look at me. "But
I slam the door shut.
"Well, it makes sense… Do you take it on a daily basis?"
He breaks the kiss to look at me.
Potter doesn't appear with me in court. Granger had advised against it.
I don't want to remember.
"Great!" I sit back in my chair and hear him gathering the vials from the desk. "One last question, though… what exactly are we brewing now?"
"I know," he says.
He’d better not know.
"Not at all.”
"This situation is so fucked up, actually..." He looks up. "I had
kill me. You probably should have - in the bathroom - and been done with it!" I shrug his hand off and start to walk away, my vision blurry.
"But... to kill Nagini you would have to..."
"They're
Our further attempts with the potion don't make any progress. He doesn't understand why. I don't tell him that my memories now are tainted with jealousy, rotten with greedy bitterness, they are not enough to cast a Patronus that would make a difference.
"I was him, Vol..."
I know immediately: Harry is at Hogwarts.
~ It's not. Yet, we cannot change the past without changing the whole world before and after.
"Oh, really?" I laugh. "I rather thought you wouldn't want to get your hands dirty."
"You want me to pretend that I hate my father!" Jared raises his voice. "I don't hate my father!"
Holding my breath, I
Late at night, after I have just gone to bed, there's a knock on my door.
"Ouch!"
"Thanks, Kreacher," he says to the ancient elf, who is stirring something on the stove.
"Come in," I say, expecting Ron or Hermione, and feeling the wards shift, allowing the visitor in.
"Now, it makes sense. Remember I asked you, why wasn't your Dragon flying?"
"Fenrir," Dumbledore says and raises his left hand in greeting.
This house only needs a bit of attention, I think, spilling the music from under my fingertips. The room is growing brighter, beaming at me, and I smile back. And when the final note fades out into silence, the lights don't switch off.
"Thank you, Potter."
The verse long-forgotten falls off my lips - swift and clear - streaming like tears down my face.
"Okay."
to be spared of Potter's presence. He wouldn't stalk me around once I got back to my dorm, would he?
"It's not true," you said to her back, silhouetted in twilight against the window.
"Poor Harrykins," she says over me, when I'm rinsing my mouth at the sink.
"Sorry," I say, not daring to breathe, aware that I should probably withdraw and stop hurting him. I most certainly should.
the sign drawn above it. He drew it himself, he gave us a clue! The Cloak - I already have it, so..." He looks at me. "The only thing is left to find is-"
"I don't know?"
"You don't have to..." With a flick of my hand, I send ripples across the water, watching as they shine and flow to finally touch you, caressing the tender skin on the inside of your wrist.
Too late. Under the pressure of your heel on the pedal, the thing launched forward with a roar, and my hands gripped you around the middle.
"Draco, look..." Potter says at breakfast.
comes the awful thought. Mother looks at me and I know she is thinking the same.
"So," he says, “the locket."
She was sorry, she pitied you; she didn't know how to help.
But everything is written there, there's not much I could add. "Have you read The Tale of the Three Brothers?" I look at Granger.
We do. I lower myself back into the armchair. Granger and Weasel sit on
"Potter..." Malfoy begins, but I don't listen.
I don't understand why half of them are cheering, and the other half recoil in disgust. What use can either side make of a dead man, anyway? A dead man is less than nothing to everyone except his parents. He must pick a side - he must do it
“Yeah… the way you looked after… like you were going to pass out.”
“I said I’m
"See you." I nodded. There was a sudden lump in my throat.
I think I hear voices outside, or probably just dreamed them up.
I blink, my smiling face distorted amidst the fire is etched under my eyelids. I keep my mouth shut and cover your hand with mine, sparing me, sparing you...
Because I'll never be able to let another man come close to me. Why couldn't I just pretend, go along with Father's game? At least I would still have remained a Malfoy.
I'm not looking anyway
Malfoy says nothing for a while, then: “Your friends are so protective.”
the you that wouldn't be you. The not-you you. The one you would never be.
Silence falls for a few moments. There's a bad feeling in my guts.
He turns to me. "How so?"
"Doubts?" I frown. "Whom do you doubt?"
“Would you mind removing your bag?” Malfoy whispers.
“A shower?” Feeling strangely light-headed, I reach for the hem of my quidditch jumper, pulling it over my head.
"Sorry, sir."
If there's still anything to face.
It's been a month, and I feel better.
"Okay, I think I could try."
It's a trick.
If someone told me a half a year ago that I might eventually like Malfoy, I would have laughed in their face. To like him, to really like him as a person? When the hell freezes, I would have told them.
I spring on my feet. "How are you going to
Kill it. Just
"I told you, I won't talk about it, Mother." You tried to turn to your other side, but she gripped your shoulder.
“Let’s go. We barely have time for breakfast.”
Later, watching his sleeping face, I thought how everything had changed, how many changes this New Year is yet to bring us - changes that I want to discover, waking up beside him every morning.
His eyes are green
Bushes flash past in a blur as I speed up.
"Which brings me to another issue." He waves his hand, and I brace myself for whatever is to come.
He drops his bag on the desk, pulling the chair out, and finally gets himself seated.
“What is it?”
I pray to some unknown entity,
Closing my eyes, I touch the keys, running my fingers over them lightly, and begin to play.
“She’s quite tall,” he continues, unaware of my inner turmoil. “Almost of my height, an inch shorter, maybe. Just like you.”
he says.
Barely, but still.
I will think.
"Come in," he repeats, sitting up in the bed. It's not as dark as it has seemed to me at first. The soft glow of the streetlamps is streaming from the window.
It should be. It's not. I pretend to myself that it is.
"It's fine, Kreacher." I raise the paper out of his reach.
Holding back with all my might, I speed up, becoming frantic, becoming breathless, moving and moving, until I can no longer last. My pleasure makes me shudder, makes me jerk and dig my fingers into his shoulder. I go liquid, my body flowing, and he takes it all.
He mumbles under his breath something like: "No taste in fine things," but follows.
I am aware of him standing above me, but dare not look up. I curl on my side and breathe until I realise I'm crying.
“Curious?” I shrug. “Hermione told me she’s incredibly beautiful.”
If I could.
you stand where he stood?! Tell them how it happened that night. Tell them how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you!" He points his finger at Snape. "And killed him. Tell them!" [11]
You were about to head to your seat, when Mr. Vice stopped you.
"Yes, and you'd be able to as well, if you weren't hopeless.”
Fierce and steady.
." He bows and heads to the exit.
and when I clicked it, a..." Weasley shrugs. "It sounds crazy, I know, but..."
“Yes, please.” I grin, and he thrusts a glass in my hands. “Thanks!”
I'm not gonna stare
"Yes." He was arranging the potions kit on the desk. "Daphne's sister, why?"
Why didn't he do it? Why leave me like that - groping in the darkness for the shreds of knowledge that elude me at every turn?
"Draco?.. Are you asleep?" Potter whispered loudly.
"It doesn't matter that Harry's gone!" Longbottom begins. "People die every day. Friends, family... Yeah, we lost Harry tonight, but he's still with us,
“No problem,” I reply, and he is gone.
My head bursts.
I only have a moment to acknowledge the odd
He wraps his arms around me and strokes my hair and presses gentle lips to my temple. "Draco, my Draco," he repeats, "my..."
"I'm sorry, but... there's no other way. I'll talk to Hermione."
But Ron’s words, however, stay with me all day long. If our positions were reversed, if he were exposed and I stayed anonymous. Would I step forward? Would I reveal myself? I don't know. It's easy to demand it of him, once everything's happened, and I have nothing to lose.
notion from, Draco?"
Kreachers serves food and never talks. Potter had ordered him not to. Days pass in the gloomy silence and sounds of the elf moving about the kitchen. Nights pass in distorted sleep and nightmares.
"I don't know." I fumble with my jeans, putting them on. "Just asking. In case you brought Astoria with you." I reach for my socks. "I don't think I'd want to do this stuff in her presence."
"Friends? Caleb seems a bit more than a

case. So technically it's the same, and they've put the two cases together. So now I'm investigating your disappearance for your Father."
I ceased crying long ago. In that tiny bedroom at Hogwarts, in another life, I wept all my tears out. I am barren and hollow and not alive. What's the point? I sometimes ask myself. What's the point of hiding and sitting here, if I could leave the house and breathe... or get caught, or killed - I barely care.
"Do you have something strong? I mean... a drink - Firewhisky?"
Several minutes pass in silence, disturbed only by a heartfelt whispering of a prayer around the circle. The crane of your neck is uncomfortable, and your knees begin to ache.
"Lie down." Potter reaches out, trying to push me back onto the pillow.
"Competitiveness? How even... you are
I brace myself, and Granger near me suddenly grips my sleeve. I shrug her off, I need my wand hand ready.
He summoned his backpack and the sleeping bag from his bunk, stuffing it jerkily inside. His woollen sweater followed and a small leather pouch he often wore around his neck; he grabbed his second pair of jeans from the floor, stuffing everything angrily into the backpack, while the three of us gaped at him in silence. His silver shield charm still glimmered around me.
"Don't leave."

. Fresh and cool and so
Nott's handwriting didn't resemble Noir's in the slightest. But handwriting is easily modified, isn’t it? And Nott seems to be smart and reserved enough. He is neutrally polite with everyone, mostly keeping to himself. His grades are high, and he may be exactly that calm, composed, bookish type I imagine Noir to be. Deep waters. And
I grin, turning us around to press him into the wall, and slide my hand down his stomach. I've never done this to anyone before, but there's the first time for everything.
"And take
Later, thinking about it, you couldn't remember exactly what had happened in detail, your memory supplying you with only distorted flashes:

"Should I er..." He asked, standing awkwardly in the doorway. "Maybe I'll sit for a while with you? Do you mind?"
"I'll tell him. Tonight. Is it okay?"
The Saviour's word against Mother.
Every strike makes you wince and want to cover your ears. You are thinking vaguely about your own Father. Would he have done that to you? If he believed in all this nonsense, he undoubtedly would have.
and eventually cease to exist.
"I am so sorry all this is happening, my dear." Mother stroked your hair.
"What the fuck do you want, Zabini?"
"Hermione!" Potter shouts in panic. "Hermione! He fainted!"
Malfoy is all irritable today. Though not refusing to play, he avoids looking at me and replies mainly 'yes' or 'no' when I say something. As soon as we meet in the air, every time he turns his broom around, leaving me looking at his retreating back. I cannot stop staring at how his hair is gleaming in the sun, cannot stop noticing how graceful his movements are, how strong and sure his posture looks on the broom. I am afraid of being too obvious, anxious he might notice, anxious twice because now he knows I may look.
Dittany in my bag,
"Fuck."
There's a deadly silence, while I'm hanging on the precipice, before Malfoy gets to his feet.
“I mean… she kind of throws herself at you, all the time, haven’t you noticed?”
"Fuck!" Potter swears. "My hands are shaking."
"How convenient," I sneer. "Don't be a hypocrite, don't deny you enjoyed it."
Granger cries.
The taste of alcohol on his tongue hits me, and his mouth is so hot. In shock, I realise that I am kissing back, and my knees would give way, if only his palm at my nape wasn’t holding me firmly in place. His tongue is insistent, he exhales in my mouth, and there's the urge in me to grab him and hold tight. His smell is maddening, my head is swimming.
Because it's the only thing I can do to make it better.
"Yes." I hear when he starts pacing. "Meanwhile, you should practice casting your Patronus, so that when the potion is ready, you're ready, too. You should probably choose another memory."
Who sent him that stupid card
"You’re asking
"You seemed to be fine recently." She touched my hand.
"And if I fail?"
If you let me.
I close my eyes and concentrate, evoking the memory I've been recently holding close to my heart, cherishing a secret, guarding it even from my own prying thoughts.
"Probably he's changed his mind?" Potter says.
"You may do this to your heart's content." He shifts his head on my lap.
"Otherwise he isn't going at all." Potter was adamant.
However, my investigation proves pointless. I don't see that elegant spiky handwriting that has become so familiar to me. That
"Yeah!" I throw back at him. "Snogging her is a better way, you got it right."

He shakes his head.
From our side, I look across the Great Hall, at the dark crowd ready to pounce as one monstrous beast... and among them a glimpse of white... two bright blond heads next to each other, turning, searching, looking around, peering into our side. I take a half a step back. I won't think about it just yet.
“Watch where you’re going, Potter!” Malfoy’s voice bristles when I bump into him after dinner, on my slow way up the staircase in the Eighth Year Common Room.
Harry is asleep in the bed right next to mine. On his stomach under the blanket, his face obscured by the disarray of his hair, he breathes quietly, hugging the pillow in his sleep. I peer at him, trying to tell if anything's wrong. His face is clean, and so is his hair, he's wearing a white T-shirt. I see nothing amiss.
I would have advised them to check their head.
as ridiculous as you think, you could go to the party now!”
The footsteps are light, barely audible on the carpet. They approach and stop by the bed, and now you see a dark silhouette against the window.
Though my stomach is in knots, I somehow manage to already be half-asleep. Pomfrey has dosed me with something strong again. My eyes are closing. This time, I can't fight the sleep back.
"You see… I kissed that person… once. It was just a peck, it wasn’t the right time and place... I got embarrassed and didn’t say anything, and that person never said anything either.. So I thought…”
he says, straddling me in bed, and the stars on his face are shimmering.
I know it. I knew it all along.
I have to do
On wooden legs, my heart wild, I enter the Great Hall.
"Ouch!" Someone bumps into you.
"Do I really look like him?" he will ask me, his hand light at the small of my back.
Malfoy finally emerges, very pale in the face. He looks through me as though I'm not here and walks out.
A sudden noise and a commotion in the doorway make you turn. You see the staff uniforms, and among them two guys are being dragged inside.
"Well, it does. It
I tug the trousers down, and only when they finally rest on the bench, I look up.
"No... thank you, Dean... thanks." I back off.
"Fuck," Draco said quietly into my neck. Behind me the fire was crackling, loud in the silent room.
With my eyes closed, I felt his presence looming over me. I was too weak to even squeal, the tiniest movement was agony. My chest was burning, my neck, my stomach, my lower belly. Although Snape had patched me up, it would take time to heal. That vile thing Potter threw at me was eating at my skin from the inside.
"Is this
"But you are his
As soon as you sat down on the sofa in his living room, he excused himself.
"Yours isn't that bad either."
I sat with my legs up in the armchair, Potter drank his tea at the table across from Granger, and Weasley lay in his bunk, staring at the ceiling. At some point, he just got up and left the tent.
The world around me snaps into focus, making my perception vivid and sharp. Bewildered, I feel every brush of air against my skin, colours around me suddenly brighten. Something is clearing in my head, as though a veil that has been dulling all my senses is being pulled off, making me alive again.
"What's the matter? Aren't you glad?"
"Draco, where's Potter?" Mother repeats.
He bucks up into me, opens his legs wide and whispers: "Come on."

I believed him to be a better person. Better than that. Stupid of me.
"No idea! Absolutely no idea, mate."
telling him something with that leering smile that annoys me to no end. It's only when she places her hand on his shoulder, pressing her lips to the side of his face, his head suddenly snaps up to look directly at me across the tables. Automatically I lean into Gin by my side, placing my palm on her shoulder. I don't know what we are playing at... but when she turns to me in question, I shoot a glance at Malfoy and kiss her on the lips. I’m satisfied that he sees.
Harry died and everything died with him. I died. The world ended, how dare you say it doesn't matter?!
I don’t know if he’s joking or not. Probably both. It’s hard to tell.
When I slip into the living room, it's completely dark. I take a step forward and stop dead because there's rustling on the sofa. A sigh and... hot breathing, and... kissing sounds...
He must be there, among the people, he must be warning them about the Death Eaters’ attack. There - in the middle of the crowd - I'll find him. He is telling students not to be afraid, he is giving orders - to McGonnagal and Flitwick and Snape.
"I know," Potter says. "It's so... awkward, you know..." He picks at the grass that grows between the stone tiles. "We've always been together, you see, the three of us. Until now, when they... when they're
"Well that's

Was it the locket, or loneliness? Despair from losing his friends? Probably a bit of everything.
The sound of the pewter lid dropping into place is suddenly deafening as it cuts the smells off. Next to me, Malfoy exhales shakily.
I dictate to the sound of the quill scratching against the parchment.
the sleeping bag."
The stand below cracks and falls. The diadem melts before our eyes, turning liquid, getting consumed by flames. A terrible scream, a wail of pain and agony fills the room until the thing dissolves without a trace and disappears.
"Good evening, Bella," Dumbledore says mildly. "What a pleasure to see you."
"Where is Potter? They say he wasn't there with you when the Snatchers got you today."
He grips my wrist. "Calm down, Potter, no need to knock it over."
"Holy shit! Are you manhandling me now?" I push him away. "Who the fuck do you think you are?! Give me my map!"
his eyes were insane.
You stood up and approached the desk. The grim swirling contents of the basin looked smoky-grey.
"Come in!"
He obeys.

"Pot-" he begins, his face bewildered, but I don't let him finish. I launch forward and grip the locket, wrenching the chain out of his grip.
"I have them, too. Sometimes."
"Your mother has already
"Thank you," I say, "yes, actually... now I should leave Potter's house..." And the words are suddenly heavy in my throat. I'm not sure whether it's because of the house or its Master. I'd better not think about it.
— Why not?
“I’m sorry,” I whisper, touching my face to his shoulder.
The only thing I am sure of is that now is forever.
he used against you not so long ago. The one that killed that very part of him in you. We believe that - hmmm - the Horcrux in your head had meddled with your brain and the nerve-endings throughout those years, and its removal may have caused damage to your eyes."
Not waiting for his reply, I head up the staircase.
"Aha!" I say triumphantly.
"What?" What is he talking about?
"No?..."
Granger shrieks, her whole body arching in agony.
“And without a Patronus?” I ask.
The chair creaks. Keeping my breath even, I don't move in the hope that my face doesn't betray me. I feel his stare. It's weird: my skin itches - my cheeks, my eyelids, my forehead - his gaze lingers, roaming over my face.
I try to eavesdrop by the door, but can't make out any sound. They have been at it for about an hour now.
“Would you at least tell me what you’re doing?” I whisper.
Until I finally realised that the man chatting with Ron by the fireplace wasn't you.
The jade scarf, the dainty flowery whiff of a perfume, his absence, his evasive eyes, his frequent visits to his mother, his weekend shifts in the Department of Mysteries. The necklace. A weightless web of golden strings, pouring diamonds into his open palm; the waterfall of sparks sluicing down to kiss the secret Narcissus sign on the inside of his white gold wrist.
"I don't think..." I swallow, still not meeting her eyes.
to come back, are you mental?"
When he nods at me, and I nod back...
"Thanks, Kreacher," I say. I'm not sure how I feel about Potter's hospitality.
"Are you all right, sir?" My voice comes out shrill. I am so shaken with
"I always wanted to touch it."
Yaxley grabs the door handle.
My eyes snap open, and the sun’s reflection off the water hits me right in the face. I squint at you across the pool.
“Maybe you shouldn’t drink that much?”
Potter wouldn't come. He left me here for good. He left me here to rot. I undressed and filled the bath with hot water and climbed in, and it felt really good... until my gaze dropped to my left forearm. I squeezed my eyes shut and wept. Not for taking the Mark, no. Maybe a little, though. For the mere pain alone, I would have never agreed to take it if I knew beforehand. On the eve before I was branded, my Father told me that if I endured the pain without screaming, it would very much please him. I promised I would try.
"Don't say his name!"
If we get caught or killed, at least we'll be together.
There is nothing but silence and Harry in front of me. Alone in the middle, he slowly lowers his -
"Draco, dear..." She squeezes my hand over the table. There's such pity written over her face. My Mother knows too well what Family means.
I tug at his belt buckle, unfastening it, and jerk his jeans and pants down in one movement; his cock springs out.
He's right, of course. I'm trapped, and either way it's only going to get worse.
I am.
You’d never been intimate with a man. Not like

fiercely.
"Hi," I say and it sounds nervous to my own ears.
"No." I slide my hand around his arse, turning to face him. "But I hoped." Yes, I did. Wine has made me bold. Not bold enough to outright proposition him by the fire, but still. "I undressed just in case."
"I don't know."
"Okay, okay, sorry," Ron says hastily, raising his palms.
“Not doing it.” He studies me through narrowed eyes.
I bend down, putting it on the floor and
But almost. It hangs, connected to his body only with the thin shred of skin. Blood, so much
"Ron, I can't!" Granger shook her head. "What are you saying? We
"Draco, I am so sorry... I blame myself for all this, for not acting earlier."
"You are too much, Potter," you would tell me. "Giving too much, demanding too much." You would brush my hair off my forehead. "I don't think I'm enough for you, or will ever be."
How is it even possible? How can he say such a thing so casually?
"No."
Saying nothing, he turns, walking back into the room.
"Unless you--"
"Potter, I'm sick of you and your apologies. I'm calling Pomfrey." He reaches out to touch a tiny bell on his bedside table.
"What's going on here?"
“The what?” I bristle, trying to cover it with a mocking laugh.
He grips me, clutching, reeling, we almost fall when Mother puts her arms around us both. All this time I thought about Mother. I missed her the most and him – very little. He clutches at me, and I feel myself a little boy. Father. My Father – tall and proud and strong. Now I know I missed him, I know I longed for him, too.
I want to open the fucking door and enter as quickly as possible, but the handle is on Malfoy's side and to reach for it I have either to step around or lean across him. Which I'm absolutely not going to do.
"I wanted to… express my gratitude for your testimony at my trials. And to thank you for saving my mother."
I approach, pushing through the wall of backs that conceals him from me.
“No problem.”
Bella has always been suspicious. Of everyone and everything. She's recently grown jealous of Severus and the role I gave him, jealous of the place he's earned by my side. However, it won't do to dismiss even the tiniest thing.
was written on the badge on his chest.
I kiss him.
"Be careful." I pull back and look at him; I want to drink his face in, his eyes, every tiniest line. "Promise me you'll be careful."
"But, the ungrateful sinner I am," he continues, and his head snaps up to look directly at you, "I find myself constantly thinking about men."
No. I must erase anything, any trace or reminder of that traitorous flutter in my chest that used to come in disguise of a friend and stay to torture me.
"What?" Aunt Bella finally turns to him.
He opens his mouth to say something, but then shakes his head. Throwing the box at my feet, he bends down to pick up his broom and walks away.
"Tonight." I nod. "Tonight would be fine."
I want to step back into the cave, but Weasley looks up and flinches.
No one is going to help me. Neither Potter nor Dumbledore.
I've made a headline today, and half the
enters with Parkinson on his arm. In a black tuxedo and a bow-tie that look utterly Muggle, he holds himself stiffly, staring ahead. Heads are turning. It looks as though Parkinson is the one walking, and he's being dragged along, putting his feet one in front of the other. I feel for him. I know better than anyone what it feels like: to be under the fire of hundreds eyes.
I pull back in a rush. Severus flinches. I know his head hurts.
"What happened to him?!" Potter shouts somewhere from behind.
"What?" My hand still rests on the hard leather of his Quidditch gauntlet.
I hear him rising up from the armchair, the whisper of his footsteps over the carpet, first his perfume approaches, and then he takes the tie out of my hand.
At a loss, I am staring at the note, feeling such emptiness inside, as though my entire core has been ripped out. My throat hurts, and my face is crumpling. I realise I'm crying only when my glasses blur from the inside.
"See you, Malfoy," I say to his back and leave.
"Harry Potter is dead." The Dark Lord smiles. "From this day forth, you put your faith in me. Harry Potter is dead!"
had said, he wouldn't have behaved like that, be all
"This furniture is freaking tall," he exhales, putting down a bright box and a mug on the counter. Potter himself is around six feet, but the shelves and the cupboards hang really high around the kitchen.
Holding my gaze, he stands up, his pale bare feet vulnerable against the tiles. His fingers begin their run down the buttons, bringing down his defences with every move. The plain of his chest, pale shoulders; the shirt is off.
Greyback pushes Granger forward.
"Harry, quickly!" Granger flies past, and we catch up with her. She points her wand at the opposite wall that approaches at us at a great speed. "Bombarda Maxima!"
"Sorry," he says, sitting down across from me at the table, "nice sweater." He smirks.
At the thought, a slap of guilt raises familiar self-disgust in me — an old friend. They care, they mean well, they try to do what's best, when have they ever done differently?
And seeing it now - ugly and black - is a shock. Unapologetic evidence what he'd once been. The proof, the stain that will never be removed, no matter how he may change.
"What?"
"Wha..." Greyback props himself on his elbows, but her shoe kicks his side.
I trace his eyebrow, sliding my fingertips down over his temple… along the side of his face and jaw… his chin is pointy - of course, it is - I grin, I
Just like now, when Gin's hand travels down my stomach to finally rest at my inner thigh, dangerously close to the bulge in my trousers, or rather where a bulge is
"Okay." Gingerly, I take the first step up the staircase, and when my foot touches the stone, we fall into our quick pace again.
We are not hiding or anything, or pretending that there's nothing between us. Since the day Weasley destroyed the locket, we've been very obviously a couple, no less than Granger and Weasley are. But we don't go around snogging in their presence or anything like that. Sometimes Harry will take my hand or lean against me by the fire, and we sleep in one bed now. That's all.
"Can I see Mr. Draco Malfoy, please?"
Exhausted, I fell asleep immediately. I don't know when he left.
It bursts in a blinding silver, soaring high, filling me with joy, making me howl in despair. Searing-bright, it is more powerful than anything I cast before, but somehow it feels lacking, taking a part of me away. It is alien, but very familiar, too, unlike any Patronus I've ever cast. Swooping in a flash of silver, it dives into the sky.
"Actually... I've been meaning to tell you... I mean... I wanted to thank you, Potter..."
There's no Snape.
[19] – dialogue between Voldemort and Neville Longbottom, from the film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows”, Part 2.
"Oh, nothing's wrong." Turning away, I stuffed my hands in my pockets. "Except that you prefer to spend your time with your books rather than me every time you’re here."
"Yes?" His voice is odd.
Something shatters in you.
With one last glance at Draco's body, he is gone.
"Dismissed. All of you! Leave me alone, I need to think."
Only then do Malfoy and Parkinson reluctantly break the kiss and dizzily look around.
"Okay," Potter said, "Malfoy is going under the Cloak."
Ron puts his arms around us both. "Harry… how?"
There is Ron hugging Molly… McGonagall beside them wipes her eyes… Hermione holds Ginny's hand... there is George, George,
Unraveling the spells takes time. As Harry had told Draco, he needs to get rid of all the magic seeped in and around the journal. Thanks to the magical damage it’s hard, especially when Harry doesn’t want to damage the journal any more than it already has been. One spell at a time, one curse residue after another Harry untangles the mess.
The tiny elf blinks large eyes at Harry, bows quickly and then pops away with a loud crack.
Doors jingle and he sighs when a couple more page numbers slither around and mix up with dates on the open page.
Come morning and there is no reply. Not that Harry expected one.
The war has been over for five years now, but Harry is still stuck in it, in some ways.
Harry feels warm, surrounded by this little family. Remus is the one thing he has left that connects him with the past, with James, Lily and Sirius. Maybe Remus feels the same, maybe not, but there are times when the wizard looks at Harry with something unreadable in his eyes, a mix of pride and pain that is hard to take in.
When Harry glances back at Draco the other man takes a deep breath. It’s not arrogance that Harry meets, but uncertainty, fear. And he understands.
When Harry starts work on the pages themselves, one by one, he tries not to read what he now realizes are Draco’s most personal thoughts, the feelings the other wizard had gone through during school. When the times were good, from what Harry can tell, the echo of the feelings that the journal had preserved are happy and light, but the further down the journal that Harry goes the darker and more negative they get.
Maybe he also owed that to Draco all this time.
Somewhere in the middle of the ride Draco’s hand settles on Harry thighs and squeezes every time there is a sharp curve, a sudden drop or rise.
Once Harry had thought the most of Dumbledore, had respected the old wizard in a way that Harry had never respected anyone else. Now, these days, when Harry has too much time to think and too much jaded edges moving inside of him, he can finally admit that his respect has morphed into anger. Into a hate of kinds, maybe even childish in some ways.
Harry glares at his best friend, but doesn’t say anything. Rose babbles in his arms as she waves her tiny, chubby hands up and down quite quickly. She’s incredibly cute with her red curls all puffed up. She squeals when Harry makes a face at her, her laughter shrill enough to make someone wince, but her parents seem completely unbothered.
The lingering uplifting happiness that had settled onto Harry after Rose’s birth is still there, present as he finally starts to properly work on the journal that Draco brought it.
Kreacher grimaces. “How should Kreacher know. Kreacher is not master Harry.”
The old man huffs as he drops the letter before Harry and pats his back. “Damned stairs and cobblestone. I got my summons for the book I gave to you people a while back. Couldn’t come sooner, my bossy daughter in law put me on bedrest. I survived until now, a bloody flu won’t be killing me anytime soon.”
There is a knock on the door and Hermione’s mom pokes her head in. She smiles at the three of them, then ushers her husband in as well once she has determined that everyone is awake, there is no Ron murdering going on. Harry gets up from his seat and offers it to Mrs. Granger.
“Do you know for sure?”’
When Harry pulls Draco moves in willingly, easily. They kiss slowly first, then faster as their need bubbles up and over from the years of pinning and wondering about the possibilities not taken. Harry gasps against Draco’s lips and there is tongue licking along the corner of his mouth, into his mouth again. Draco kisses without the pose and finesse that he puts upon as a proper pureblood heir, but, in turn, with a messiness and desperation of a man that has waited for too long already.
Ron just rolls his eyes and turns back to Harry. “Whatever it is, you should do it. If it can get Hermione in a better mood after a sleepless night, then it can do anything. Those muggles are damn crafty when they want to be.”
“Take a picture, will last longer, Malfoy.” Harry enjoys the teasing. Doesn’t matter if it’s with words or actions anymore.
Harry carefully leafs through yet another book, this one an order from the ministry, checking the page numbers to make sure they don’t skip and play around where they shouldn’t be. The book had some major spell damage, a strange backlash as a result of experiments gone awry. Harry did not ask for details. He remembers Department of Mysteries too well, knows that whatever goes down there it’s better to not know.
Another lighting strike lights up the stormy night. Harry huffs when he realizes that one
he had felt when there was nothing he could do to stop that. Just beg someone else to do something,
Ron already has his mouth full, cheeks bunched up and sauce on the corner of his lips. “A lot of different curries, from that muggle Indian place that we like. The case I got put on is annoying and I wanted to get away from the other guys.”
When Harry apparates home Kreacher gives him one long, narrow-eyed stare before manhandling Harry into a chair and leaving to make tea. Harry breathes through the fear and panic, drinks the tea that Kreacher brough straight away to feel the hot liquid heat him up from the inside. It takes a while to gather himself into something calmer, less jumpy and worried.
a soft-looking knitted blanket and drapes it over his girlfriend gently. “And don’t worry, I will give Harry the birds and the bees talk in your absence.”
“Mum’s gonna cry.” Ron unhelpfully notes as he gently pokes his daughter’s chubby cheek. “She’s gonna loves this wrinkly, brown raisin and send us so many knitted clothes and then tell me I’m doing a shite job at holding her right. It’s gonna be amazing.”
Cedric is not the only one that was buried too young. The children of Hogwarts were the brave ones, kids barely legal and some even not yet that, that looked Voldemort in the eye and told him no, you will no longer scare us, you will not go any further. Harry fought with them, always tells whoever is asking, that they were the backbone of that last battle, the ones that ended the war that their parents had started.
Rose claps her hands and manages to surprise herself with this great achievement. Harry coos at her for a little before giving her back to Ron, who boops her little nose with one finger. They chat for a while longer, about work and how the new schedule works out for Ron. Harry shares a couple of funny stories about the ladies that come in his shop with questionable books in need of repair.
They all share a laugh. The nurse comes back again, holding an icepack for Ron to put over his eye. While Ron is being slightly embarrassed by the whole ordeal, the nurse rolls her eyes and simply says that she has seen far worse done to husbands by their wives during the delivery process.
“You can still refuse. I haven’t started anything yet.”
that Draco would not come her in person, but chose to reply via owl as well. It’s hard to explain these things in person, not that Harry has had a lot of chances to do so to begin with. Most of the customers already know that restoration entails unraveled secrets, thoughts meant only for the old pages being seen, in some capacity, by Harry’s eyes as well.
of a possibility. Harry has done many braver, more daring and stupider things before this, writing a letter is easy in comparison.

. None of them knew where tiny Cliffside Lookout is located, and Harry is glad.
“We’ll, that’s good, Harry. I’m glad you’ve found something that works for you.” Remus really does look proud, maybe even relieved.

me, more than most of them ever did, or would have dared to do.”
Draco. He’s not close enough to the other wizard and the journal is his work. Work that needs to be done without emotions, even if what he sees is heartbreaking at times. This is not the first letter that Harry has written since starting his work with these books and diaries that need to be fixed. It’s not the first time that thoughts and words of others have affected Harry in a way that he feels more than he should.
“It’s because you guys are useless and annoying.” Hermione says sagely from her hospital bed. She has her daughter sleeping in her arms again. “Also, you were about to break at least fifty different laws concerning muggles and I needed you to shut up.”
“You truly are a bleeding Gryffindor even now, Potter.” Draco almost laughs. His lips are pulled into an incredulous smile, or something that might be that. “But you’re right, I suppose. The Dark Lord ruined those around him in different ways.”
“As little as I possibly can.” Harry doesn’t promise and give concrete numbers. They don’t matter.
Before the final battle he would have said an auror. Before the final battle there were no ghosts of the dead friends and family haunting him, the echoes of those on Voldemort’s side that sometimes stared at Harry from dark corners, their faces covered in blood and dirt.
Sometimes, Harry laughs to himself, it feels like he has been stitched together and left all wrong.
At the time, perhaps starting even from so much as his first year and even almost until the end of the war, Harry thought, despite his crush, that Draco was just a stuck up shit who used his father’s name for selfish reasons, for the

desk, some dusty and some squeaky clean.
None of the people that they pass so much as look back as Harry leads Draco towards one of the roller coasters at the amusement park. Harry grins wide at the look of confusion and startlement that Draco has adapted, out of depth as he is.
“I think I’m just getting better. And happier.”
Harry thinks about how Draco ran from the shop, about the panicked look in the other wizard’s eye. The baggage they are both carrying. “What if… what if the other person isn’t okay with me and this…

the next day. Harry has learned to enjoy his meals, to take his time and not hurry.
An ancient Malfoy elder from one of the paintings nods along. He doesn’t say anything, but does give Harry a judging once-over before gliding out of the frame and leaving only an empty background behind.
Harry notes the suddenly pale look of his best friend and wonders if he should intervene. But decides it’s better to sit back and watch things play out, especially when the poor sugar pot is probably not the only place where Ginny and George have left surprises.
Just as Harry is about to disapparate he sees two women walk to the cemetery. Thankfully, they haven’t noticed him, both too busy whispering between each other. But even with her back turned to him, Harry still recognizes Cho Chang. The witch looks tired, the kind of tired that comes with rewarding work and having lived through the things that they did. Clinging onto her arm is Marietta Edgecombe.
Remus’ nose twitches as the man sighs. He doesn’t look annoyed or angry, just reluctantly amused. His nose twitches again and he stands up to gather up some of the sandwiches on another plate. Harry soon hears the
Harry still has a little bit left. Years spent in Hogwarts, then the rest on his own, have managed to teach him that food is no longer something that he needs to be eaten as fast as possible, in fear that it will be taken away or just not
“Yeah, uh, the book restoration. It’s pretty great, actually. I like the quiet and peace, you know? No weird looks or people that try to suck up to me.” Harry makes a face to get Teddy to giggle, although he is nowhere near Tonks in that regard, obviously.
“Even with this? Even when I, I
“When’re you gonna meet my mum and the Lupins? Ya know, the whole parent introduction?” Ron asks when all the food is gone and only tea is left to finish.
Harry goes back to work.
Ron’s black eye has long healed by now. Though right now he has baby powder in his hair and Rose’s drool on his shoulder. “I told you, gay train wrecks. And now it might be a reciprocated train wreck! Your life’s truly looking up, mate.”
“Master Harry is good at agreeing but not doing.” Kreacher comments as he snaps his fingers to straighten out an overturned chair.
Harry looks away from Draco and towards where he had placed the journal for the time being. He had thought,
Remus and Tonks share a look before glancing down at their proud-looking son. Harry hides his amused grin behind a sandwich, all too familiar with Teddy’s extensive vocabulary, mainly thanks to Tonks. Not that the parents seem too bothered by that, they just sort of accepted the fate of being constantly reprimanded by the grandparents about their and, in turn, their son’s bad habits.
With a raspy hum Harry opens his mouth and bites into the mark, licks the indents that his teeth have left behind.
Harry rolls his eyes with great exaggeration. “Don’t worry, I’m good with
“For God’s sake, Ron, I can go and make myself tea without tripping. Sit down!” Hermione has her eyebrows furrowed; the expression made even fiercer by her exposed forehead. The bun atop of her head is frizzy and barely held together with more than one hairband.
Harry chuckles. He feels Draco’s erection against his leg, makes a noise of satisfaction when the hand on his hip grabs onto his skin, holds on tight enough to perhaps leave more marks behind, atop the ones that are there already. A moan slips past Draco’s lips when Harry leaves another hickey atop the Dark Mark, remarks the brand as his own, eats away more and more of its power.
Hermione simply grins. “I’m good. I’m still on pain medication, so I don’t feel anything, but I’m pretty sure everything down from my hips is a war zone. I think Ron let Molly know, but better safe than sorry.”
Harry chuckles. “It’s alright, sir, we keep the books safe and sound until their owners do come.” He checks the identification number on the letter and goes to check the finished projects. He finds the old man’s book fairly quickly. “Here you go. The pages eaten up by rot are all brand new again, as is the text within. I put in a charm that will keep water off from it, protect from dampness and so forth.”
“Hey, Malfoy, wanna go on a date?” Harry breathes in the wind. Perhaps the best way is the simplest way to go.
The sheets tangle around them and the room smells, is so hot. Harry gives into the need to be loud. Draco takes pleasure from every noise, every tiny moan and gasp, the curses that are whispered against the pillows. When Harry winds up sitting in Draco’s lap, his sweaty body bared to the warm air of the room the wizard just lays back and lets Harry take charge of everything.
“Harry, both you and young Malfoy were two dumb idiots then and have, by now, hopefully, outgrown the phase of thinking that anything the other does is some kind of a scheme. At worst you will be rejected.” Remus is laughing fondly as he speaks, sounds a little exasperated, “Besides, you fought and ended Voldemort, asking your crush out cannot possibly be as shite as that whole problem.”
Draco stays silent. He has looked away from the book only once, when Harry was performing his spells. The man’s jaw flexes, his eyebrows furrow in thought as he goes over the options. Probably wonders how safe the book will be here, with Harry left to take care of it.
The bell by the door tinkles gently as someone walks in. Harry puts the book he had just started to examine on the workstation before him.
“Did you mean it. The note.” Draco doesn’t quite ask. He sounds unsure, despite the steady voice and quietness that the words are spoken in. It’s the abruptness and stiltedness that give him away, rather.
talks while he is trying to stop me from bleeding out!” Ron tries very hard to keep a straight face, but can’t hold the laughter in for too long.
The sun rises above the horizon slowly, the sea sloshes against the cliffs loudly and Harry breathes in the salty air. The cottage had been nothing but a forgotten Potter property, kind of falling apart when Harry first showed up here and decided that this will be his new home. Away from the wizarding world and
Mr. Granger nods very solemnly from Ron’s side. “I remember when Mary had you, she broke my fingers during the birth. You got away pretty scot free, son.” He squints his eyes at Ron’s black eye critically. “Wish I had some of your potions at that time, though.”
Harry knows the wand, has held it and used it. It’s a strange fact to recall.
“You know, now some of Malfoy’s shite seems to make sense, if I think about it as him being weird about his crush on you. Like you were.” Ron points his wand at Hermione’s shirt to clean it, then raises it up at his own hair. After a moment of hesitation, he reconsiders and goes off to the kitchen to wash the baby powder out.
Harry sips his mango lassi. “Not really? Well, Malfoy came in yesterday.”
“Hello, sir. How may I help you?” Harry doesn’t smile, doesn’t think it’s the kind of shop where it’s needed.
Levante inspects the finished product with a critical eye, the eye of a mentor. She hums, then smiles. Her hands are gentle when they pet the diary’s cover, like one would an old friend. “Good work, Mr. Potter.”
Harry takes off his glasses and busies his hands with cleaning them. “The, uh, about the time when I was on a run after and before escaping from your, I mean, the manor. Parts from fifth and sixth years, as those were the most damaged and I had to make sure the text didn’t scramble up.”
Harry wonders if Draco is as well. With the same kind of tiredness that leaves everything in its wake cold and broken, worn too thin.
Harry places the journal on the desk where all the complete projects wait for their owners. He takes a template and fills it in to let Draco know that he can come and get it back. The black owl that takes the note away hoots softly before taking flight.
“You need to sleep, love. This is on par with exam-time you.” Ron
“How… huh?”
The clock dings seven and Kreacher finds him curled up by the dining table, the mug empty of tea and dark bags under his eyes. The house elf sighs long-suffering and sets about to make breakfast. Harry finds amusement in the indistinguishable mumblings of the old elf, relaxes under the shifty, judging glares that Kreacher sends him from time to time.
When Ron has gone back to work Draco holds Harry’s hand in his and kisses the knuckles one by one. “You’re quiet today.”
of Tonks’ prosthetic leg as she comes down the corridor. Her nose is already scrunched up in laughter, hair a lilac color that Teddy copies the second he sees.
Before him stands Draco Malfoy. It has been a while since they have met and been truly alone. The trials after the war were hard on them, even if Draco and Narcissa were both genuine in their gratitude when Harry testified for their freedom. The, sometimes, they meet at the charity and remembrance balls where the Malfoys and Harry simply exchange polite greetings, maybe a

that was tacked to the same things that his friends were yelling was desperate and full of trust. It seemed like a hallucination then and after the battle, but because of the journal now Harry thinks it might have been real.
Harry is simply sitting back and enjoying the friendly ribbing going on between his best friends. He doesn’t want to get into it, if only to not be attacked from two sides at the same time. They all know each other far too well by this point to have a fair fight.
“I mean, you have never been that subtle. Oblivious as well, at times.” Hermione’s hair is a mess atop her head and her shirt has dirty spots all over the front, still moist.
After the funeral of Lucius Malfoy, the meetings during these events stopped, since Draco chose to not attend and Narcisa had left the country, from what Harry knows.
“I’ll get your journal.” Harry turns away from Draco.
“Honestly, Harry, Remus is like your third father.” Hermione has ink on her cheek, a muggle pen stuck in her hair.
Harry digs into the curry with an acknowledging hum towards Ron’s ranting. As per department rules the man can’t get too into details, not even with friends and family, in case something gets out to the wrong people, but Harry doesn’t mind the vague comments and general whining. It’s the same as with some of Harry’s own books, after all. He does snort spicy curry up his nose when Ron starts ranting about something that the new head of auror department had done, which lead to a department-wide panic.
And Draco echoes the sentiment in the journal. The few words that Harry saw were ones of fear and regret, words of someone raised to think of Voldemort’s cause as right now having to come to terms that it really is just senseless violence and one man’s need for power and terror.
hum around him and guides the words properly into the blank spaces. Some of them don’t want to go back, so they fight back against the magic that is trying to lead them. Harry tightens his hold on the magic, swears under his breath when something fights back.
Hermione has meanwhile laid down on the sofa, massaging her breasts. “I love my daughter, but I don’t love breastfeeding. Everything is sore and uncomfortable.”
There are takeout bags hanging from Draco’s fingers, the crinkly plastic of muggle making makes enough noise to fill the entire shop. Not a second later Ron steps inside as well, hair wet from rain and face splotchy red from the wind that has been rattling the windows all morning.
“I have a tiny one, minus the skies, now.” Harry laughs to himself as he busies himself with a kettle.
“I…” Draco seems taken off-guard. “No, I… You’re right. We’re all adults now, I suppose.” He looks down at the book, bites his bottom lip and then faces Harry again, assured and calm, the same act of a pureblood heir as he was minutes ago. “I’ll leave it in your care, then. Let me know when it’s ready and how much I will need to pay.”
Draco comes to the shop instead of answering via owl, as Harry would have expected the wizard to do. There is something panicked and wild hidden behind the mask of careful indifference when Draco takes a deep breath before speaking.
, don’t remind me of that, Potter. It was both mortifying and fueled my wank sessions for a long time to come.”
The door jingles and an old man comes in, a letter clutched in his hand. “Ah, young man, hello to you.”
Harry knows his cheeks are probably pink by how warm they feel. “But there is history and I don’t know.”

hangs in the air like an ominous warning.
that Harry answers when someone asks him what he wants to do.
“Ah, don’t look at me like that, Harry. I thought we had this talk ages ago already.” Remus shakes his head and the tiny smile on his lips, despite the scars on his face, makes the man look so much younger.
“So, you’re saying that you both are probably like each other, but there are some possible past hurts and present awkwardness around to properly do anything about it.” Remus summarizes the situation easily over yet another afternoon tea meeting.
“Sure they have.” Draco grins and his eyes glint. “I don’t mind just going along with what feels right. Everything has been about rules and following orders for so long… Perhaps spontaneity is what I need, and it does certainly work best for you.”
“Is it the one with the drugs? Or unknown origin kneazle hybrids?” Harry joins the two. He places a pot of warm tea in the middle of the table.
Kreacher doesn’t look pleased. The old elf grumbles under his nose for a moment, tiny eyes narrowed. “Fine. If Master Harry so wishes.”
“Merlin indeed, Harry.”
Harry laughs. Quietly and raspy, as if the sound is foreign to him, but he laughs. The tiny note sits still on the desk before him, the paper smooth and without any ink stains. It’s just one, simple sentence that packs more than it seems, more than Harry thinks it should be allowed to get across.
want something, would the other wizard appreciate Harry butting in now, trying to use this chance? Will it seem like that? It’s true that Harry has tried to get it across that times have changed and he has moved on from all things war and foolish rivalries, but Draco seemed to have been under the assumption that Harry felt nothing but sexual frustration, at best, then and now feels maybe a neutral nothing.
Harry waits.
Kreacher hums. “Master Harry better be sleeping the next night.” An unsaid
Harry takes the book, still a little unsure how to act around the elderly witch, but he takes the book, cradles it gently as he carries it to the workbench and takes a deep breath. The first spell comes out as he was taught in the courses and slowly Harry loses himself in the work. It’s not an old book, but valuable to the family. Damaged by floods, ink washed into nothing or grey, unreadable blotches across the pages. It takes longer than it would to someone who has worked years in the profession, but Harry fixes the book, or rather – the diary, to what it used to be eventually.
“Yeah, yeah I am, Kreacher.” Harry looks down at the short, one-sentence note that he has penned with far greater difficulty than it should have been. He takes the cup of tea and breathes in. “Should I send this one?”
The shift comes as a surprise and soon Draco looks down at Harry, his blond hair a curtain around his face and arms unsteady as they tremble on both sides of Harry’s face.
The naan bread is still warm as Harry bites into it. He chews for a moment as he thinks. “Sometimes I miss the days when Malfoy was up to something. Now it’s just boring adult shit and the occasional nervous breakdowns and identity crisis.”
Draco wrinkles his nose cutely. “It seemed much faster from the sideliaaaa--!”
sound and shakes her head, like granny does when I break her ugly teacups.”
“Kreacher is good at calling me out on my bullshit.” Harry retorts.
Harry has never told this to anyone else, but he noticed Draco in that last battle. When he dueled Voldemort, with the curses and spells that were being cast around him, through the pandemonium of
“Oh, you’re such a nice boy, Harry. Bless your heart.” Mrs. Granger pats Harry’s shoulder and then immediately turns to Hermione and coos at the sleeping baby girl. “Oh, look at that hair! Luis, look at that hair! Mio, oh, she is so adorable. How are you holding up, honey? We sent an owl to Molly before coming over, since we weren’t sure if she knows, by the way.”
Because of the curse damage Harry is forced to pay closer attention to the last entrees of the journal. He sees Draco’s frantic wonderings about Voldemort, the man’s fears of his family and his own fate if there would come a time when the Malfoys were no longer valuable or good enough servants.
Whatever Draco wanted to say gets cut off mid-scream as the cart goes over the peak and crashes down, following the rails. Harry woops next to Draco, his hair a mess and eyes squeezed tightly shut because of the wind that hits his face. Draco is still screaming, but now it’s out of excitement instead of the initial surprise.
“Leave my dude Michael alone! Me and him have very deep and
“Hello, how can I help you?” Harry asks as he rounds a shelf that stretched from floor to ceiling.
Harry lets him. He has also mellowed out after everything, after dying and coming back and trying to find himself again.
Harry’s forced to cut some of the old pages out with muggle tools to take care of them separately from the journal itself, as some of the texts, both lost and still lingering like shadows on the said pages, are finicky and might influence the rest of the journal’s restoration process.
dried raisin. She already has the Weasley hair and I bloody love it.”
In the evening Harry is desperate to see his friends, to see that Hermione is healthy and happy, even with
“As weird as that one awkward handjob we had in fifth year?” Harry quips back easily.
Harry first follows the faded edges of it with his fingers, uncaring of the shiver that makes Draco’s whole body trembled, or the tensing of the man’s arm. He simply maps out the skull and the snake, hisses under his breath just to see if the tattoo still answers.
“Master Harry is not sleeping again.” Kreacher croaks from behind Harry, his wrinkled face pulled into something scolding and worried. Harry has grown on him the same way he grew on Harry during these five years.
“Ah, you hate talking about that, huh?” Draco sounds more to how he was during school, a little amused, a little like he can read through Harry easily.
Harry doesn’t know what to say in reply. He resents others for putting that burden onto him, especially because anyone could have killed Voldemort had they tried, had Dumbledore not kept all the cards so himself until the final moment.
It’s the middle of the night and there is hurt inside of Harry. It’s a little bit physical and a little bit emotional, an emptiness that eats him away when the nightmares come and when he jumps at sudden movements in the shadows. There are scars that pulse with the memories of what left them, and Harry wishes he could forget, but also wants to remember these things forever.
But then he remembers the ghosts of his parents and Sirius in the forest, before he willingly went to die and Harry shakes the thoughts away. Lily and James loved him enough to die for him, Sirius loved him enough to spend years in Azkaban and then willingly take what was meant for Harry… Their sacrifices should not be for nothing, for Harry to feel like they were wasted efforts.
Kreacher grumbles some more, but then disappears to get Harry’s work clothes ready. Harry eats his sandwiches and watches the morning light dance across his windows, the tiny flares that twinkle across the kitchen ceiling when the light hits something shiny and reflective. Maybe better days are coming.
Ron slaps Draco on the back. “Hey, Malfoy, you good?”
Despite how rational Remus’ words are, there is still uncertainty that plagues Harry’s head as he thinks this over. Even if Draco
“Which parts did you see, from my journal?”
The letter to Draco Harry puts in a box, together with the others.
Draco swallows again, exhales. “Ah, no. I saw that the shop has opened again, so I wanted to… wanted to put in a request.”
Harry takes Draco to the muggle part of London for their dates, wanting to show the other man a part of his own life, the part that is both a painful, dark memory and an escape from the suffocation that the wizarding word can sometimes become.
“I’m not going to do anything to it, apart from what I do with any other book that I have worked on. I’m over our dumbass feud already.” Harry thinks his words taste sandy, overly practiced and rehearsed. They are the truth, but he wishes he wouldn’t have to say them.
Hermione chuckles, pleased. “Oh, that does sound lovely. And you’ll be close to George. Do you know who will be there with you during the probation?”
“Evil.” Remus mumbles against Tonks’ shoulder, though his eyes shine in mischief.
When they get off Draco is wide-eyed and his hair a mess, cheeks flushed a healthy pink. “That was marvelous!”
talk as well.”
to do. “I think I will go visit Cedric tomorrow, so no need for lunch.”
bed sharing going on.” Hermione rolls on her side and pulls up her legs.
“You’re overthinking. It’s not that deep, as you young people like to say. Or my wife, at times.” Remus repeats himself. The amber of his eyes is warm with affection.
Tonks sits in Remus’ lap and reaches for a sandwich. “If you get any dirt on old pureblood families do let me know. I’m always up for juicy details, but mom doesn’t tell me any anymore.”
He stands by the bookcase full of memories and things that Harry thinks of as precious. Mementos, as Hermione once called them.
crushes on as I did you. You were just impressively annoying and too Gryffindor for me to bear.” Draco’s cheeks have colored slightly pink, despite the confident air around him. “
“Same, though.” Harry admits easily enough.
Harry doesn’t know how he looks like right now. He swallows but that doesn’t help. The mark is a reminder and a curse, a cattle brand that burns those that bear it even now.
“Fuck.” Draco breathes and shifts his hips upwards. “
Harry’s fingers still itch with the need to write.
“Sure, Kreacher. I’ll try to sleep tonight.” Harry feels amused by the elf’s weird mothering.
After the graveyard, where Cecdric’s grave is always decorated with flowers and gifts, with his forever young picture smiling wide and cheerful, Harry feels less tired. Less tired, but definitely sadder.
Draco sits properly, one leg crossed over the other. He has taken off his jacket and placed it over his lap. “After the trials I’ve been nothing more than a dirty Death Eater, even if you vouched for me. I always thought my blood somehow made me… better, I suppose. But society proved me wrong.”
“Master Harry is supposed to be working today.” Kreacher snaps his fingers to levitate a plate of sandwiches over to Harry, mouth pulled into a judging line. “So why is Master Harry already up?”
this be put on me?” Draco extends his arm towards Harry. It shakes.
Ron shakes his head. “Oh, I’m not gonna take any this time around. ‘Mione said if she goes through pain then I have to as well. We made a pact.”
Draco meets Harry by the front door. The other man is as put together as he has been the last couple of times they have seen each other, only this time the wizard is dressed in a soft, beige sweater and muggle jeans. Harry stops by front steps and waits, unwilling to break any boundaries just yet, even if only on accident.
Ron is trying to very gently clean off the smudge without Hermione really noticing. “Better three dads than six siblings.” He manages the feat, but blushes slightly pink when the witch rolls her eyes at him.
“You were right about the muggle world. No one does care about us here.” Draco remarks and his voice is low now, a rasp against Harry’s lips. “I can snog you like this and the only thing someone might care about is our gender.”
“We all had it hard during Voldemort’s time, Malfoy. Just because my experience was generally fucked, doesn’t mean yours was any less shitty on accord of you not being a part of the undesirable groups.” Harry knows he’s also scowling, the furrow between his eyebrows a rather telling sign.
“Yeah, I thought he’d either walk out or get someone from the main office.” Harry glances at the book that he has yet to even start properly working on. “Seemed very, don’t know, glum, I s’pose.”
The clock ticks and outside of the shop life moves in in a jumble of loud noises and colorful blurs of magical folk of all ages hurrying along with their chores. The monochromatic world around Harry is calm, even with Draco’s presence in it. There is still something fragile in Draco’s gaze when he looks at the journal, as he seems to think things over.
That’s a loaded question, for how simple it pretends to be. Harry turns the cup in his hands round and round, eyes downcast to not see worry painting his friends’ faces older than they are. There are many answers he could give, the ones that he uses when Molly asks, when other friends ask. But just like Harry finds it impossible to lie when Remus is the one on the other side of the table, he cannot lie now either.
Harry snorts at the narrow-eyed stare that Ron sends Draco’s way, but doesn’t get in the middle. The slowly building friendship between his friends and Draco is not something that Harry wants to get in-between of, or influence in any way. It won’t be the same if he makes or
Harry wipes sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his shirt. He’s alone in the shop, Levante having left the day before to the main branch, her handshake strong and words hopeful for their future cooperation. Harry himself is also proud, even if he has yet to do anything major. But these books hold a certain kind of old magic that he enjoys feeling and handling, repairing or soothing out the twisted edges of it.
, Harry remembers Draco helping where he could, shielding a crying girl that had the front of her uniform sticky with blood. In those final moments when the air was but a buzz in Harry’s ears, the pressure to finally
Harry sighs long and deep. “I don’t know. Tired.”
“It can be restored.” Harry straightens out and puts his wand away. He glances at Draco from behind his unruly fringe and over his glasses. The other wizard is slightly blurry, but Harry thinks it’s better to see the world in mist than whatever he might see on Draco’s face. “It will take time, I’m not sure how long yet. Or I can send it over to the main office where they might do it faster.”
had of ending everything.”
Living with guilt is torture that Harry knows too well. He doesn’t wish it to anyone, especially not someone that has paid with enough sacrifices after the war that had not been his either. The war should not have been fought and won by Harry and the other kids, even if they were the ones to end it, ultimately. Harry never bothered to think about the kids that were on the other side, weather they were a part of that voluntarily or against their will.
Ron laughs hard enough to almost fall out of his chair. He snorts even louder when Draco starts to protest the fact and the talk then devolves into weird mom things that they both share. Harry gathers the dirty cutlery and cups to wash later and breathes in deep.
Harry mulls over what little he remembers of the letter, squinting into nothing for a little bit. “Ah, a witch called Levante Alby, I think?”
Harry leans down to examine the book. There is strange magic on it. He doesn’t touch it yet, but does tap it gently with his wand, mouths the words for the incantation to detect how damaged the book is. There are curse residues on it, a malice to it that Harry has only seen during his courses. But it’s not an impossible job. Just hard and, probably, long, as it would be Harry’s first time working on something this complex.
“Somehow, Potter, I don’t trust you.” Draco drawls. His fingers, though, tighten around Harry’s and he looks up at one of the more extreme roller coasters with some interest.
, Harry heard everyone screaming, heard Draco’s yell between the cacophony of voices. The
Ron raises his hands in surrender. “Sorry, ‘Mione. It’s just, you know, like nerves?” The redhead looks confused over his own words.
“You love your family, mate, don’t lie.” Harry laughs even though the sooth from the fireplace get in his nose.
Michael Corner. I knew it was a bad idea when he was appointed your personal medwitch.”
Draco slides his free hand down Harry’s back and settles it on his hip, squeezes. Harry pulls his boyfriend’s other arm close to his face, licks the Dark Mark, bites where the snake’s tongue is stuck in a perpetual hiss. Underneath him Draco’s breath hitches and stops.
Draco takes his journal, but doesn’t open it. “At the manor, when I lied for you, I thought that that would be it. Aunt Bellatrix could smell out lies so easily and yet… She didn’t, then.” He closes his eyes and grimaces. “But you were the only hope that we all, that
“Well, yes.” Remus puts down his cup and holds his hands over his stomach. The man then leans back in the chair with a tiny wince. The full moon is coming up and with it the aches and small pains. “Do you want to let it rest? Or pursue it? It can’t all fall onto the other person.”
“You’re overthinking it.” Remus butts in with an amused chuckle.
Draco has written about the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione were caught and brought back to the Malfoy mansion. It’s then that Harry needs to take a break himself, because the memories that he tries not to go back to are painful.
.” He makes a face, a grimace of sorts, then rubs between his eyes. “Fuck. Just, don’t look too deep into what you might or might not see.”
It’s the emptiness, the sense of
“I got an owl back that they would be happy to have me. I did pass the courses and all that. They have a tiny shop in Diagon Alley, by the Knockturn entrance, you know the one that was shut down for a long time after the war? I’d be there all on my own after probation, which is nice.” Harry sips at his tea. The warmth travels inside of him, through his bloodstream and warms the wizard from the inside.
Harry doesn’t know when his hand has moved to clutch unto the flawlessly ironed dress shirt Draco had chosen to wear. “Does that mean you’ll keep on kissing me?”
“They’d be proud of you, you know?” Remus says when they stand by the door of the Lupin house. “Of everything you have done and are doing right now.”
As the old wizard leaves Harry can’t help but chuckle at the way the man aggressively pokes at the raised cobblestone in places, most surely cursing them out. A young woman soon joins him and entwines their arms together, leading the old wizard towards the exit of Diagon Alley. Despite the annoyed furrow between his eyebrows, the old man goes with her easily.
Levante turns her wise, grey eyes towards Harry when she has finished explaining how to retrieve words lost to time or damage. “This work is hard and, some would say, boring. It’s only boring if you think of it as boring. It’s also relaxing, and I think you, of all the people, need that, Mr. Potter.”
One of the instruments
, Harry finds himself stuck between mortification and begrudging amazement.
Draco’s finger traces the circle of the cup’s edge as he listens along. “With your track record, seeing how it goes usually works out for the best.”
He watches the two witches for a while, to make sure they are far away that the pop of his disapparation will not disturb them. Harry has not spoken to Cho since his fifth year and he doesn’t want to start now, even after everything.
“It’s fucked.” Harry agrees.
The graveyard is quiet, as most wizarding ones are. In this one there are some more of those that fell during the last battle, so Harry visits them as well, repeats his
Harry can only snort in disbelief. It’s not the first time that the house elf has said this either. “Yeah, probably.”
“Still you.” Draco kisses along the side of Harry’s face, sloppy. “Always fucking you.”
a pureblood’s house.
The heaviness of Draco’s gaze makes shudders run up Harry’s spine. When their eyes meet Draco blinks once, slowly. Here, in this muggle amusement park, hidden away in a corner and out of the way from the excitement of all the people around them, Harry feels like the only thing that Draco sees and acknowledges. The kiss is quick, light thing that doesn’t linger, just promises of something else to come.
Harry breathes in deeply. “
“Not a Gryffindor’s heart, just mine.” Harry feels relief for some reason.
