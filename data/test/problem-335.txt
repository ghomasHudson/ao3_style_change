Harry remained still seated, looking at Draco uncertainly. As their eyes met, Harry could see Draco was probably sharing his feelings as he tugged the sleeve of his old Slytherin team’s Quidditch shirt nervously, his whole posture stiffening all of a sudden.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and let the events of the previous day run through his mind like some sort of a Muggle film. Ever since Potter had appeared at his cell, the day had felt like an utterly unrealistic and ludicrous dream, and Draco was quite uncertain if he still should consider it as such as it wasn’t exactly unheard that people would start hallucinating when they were extremely hungry. But hallucinating affected usually mainly the vision and not that much the other senses, right?
Harry laughed, throwing his clothes and other stuff in his trunk all around the room. “Yes, actually. But it’s kind of old news, we’ve been roommates since we were eleven, remember?” he said. “How’s Blaise?”
“Yeah, I had noticed that. I just thought it was one-sided,” Hermione said pensively. “Harry, is everything alright?” she asked when she noticed Harry had gone tense and started clenching his fists.
“Er, sort of,” Harry said. “It was rather he telling me about things I didn’t know how to react to. I mean, what can I say to someone who’s been disowned by his own parents?”
,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not a valid reason. After everything we’ve shared and experienced together since the first year, you still chose to keep something this big from us. That’s not okay.”
“We don’t have to like him to be able to empathize with him,” Hermione said. “It’s not okay how he treated us, and I may still think he’s a prat, but he’s gone through so much I’m worried how he’s going to have the strength to bear all this.”
Malfoy led them to a spot under a group of maple trees, far away from the other guests. They sat down and leaned against the same tree trunk as Malfoy opened the bottle and offered it to Harry.
“Well, then I couldn’t care less, you know. Charlie is also gay – or maybe bi? Anyways, I have nothing against the, erm, queer people,” Ron explained lightly. “But ‘Mione, it’s not really okay to out people like this.”
“Well, yeah,” Harry muttered, shrugging. And he was. Scared. Draco had never even been on Harry’s side and now it felt like he was slowly slipping further and further away, and Harry didn’t know how he could reach him.
“We – er – I mean, I didn’t want to cause any trouble,” Harry said a bit awkwardly, running his hand through his hair that was sticking out to all possible directions after the floo ride. Even though all the Weasleys had shown so much fondness towards him and called him a family member already for years, he couldn’t help but still feel a bit outsider anyway, and he wasn’t sure if that feeling would ever leave him properly.
“Mr Potter, may I ask what on Earth you are doing here?” the Auror asked, looking confused and turning his gaze slowly from Potter to Draco, who Potter suddenly began to squeeze tighter against himself as if to heroically protect him or something. “
“The day he let the Death Eaters into the castle, he chose to follow his father and other Death Eaters even though I had told him it’d be over if he left me.”
“Should we go now? We’ve got to wake up quite early tomorrow,” Draco said after a couple of hours, looking rather sleepy.
Harry and Ginny were sitting on armchairs in the packed living room at the Burrow, where Harry had arrived already a few weeks ago. The whole house seemed to be full of life as along with the permanent inhabitants there were now also Harry, Hermione, Bill and Fleur, and even Lupin had wanted to pay a visit that day to celebrate Harry’s birthday. Although this year it was a rather gloomy day as there seemed to be more and more bad news about disappearances and deaths every day, all probably caused by the Death Eaters.
“The funeral, pureblood traditions, stuff like that,” Hermione said. “I found out organizing a funeral is only rarely used these days. It was still much more common two hundred years ago, but after that, it has slowly become a tradition only the strictest and most tradition-devoted purebloods use. But disowning and shutting out from the family, with or without a funeral, still lives strong.”
“Well, actually, there’s a packet I should pick up. Ordered some Muggle stuff, and they couldn’t be delivered here, thanks to Umbridge and her Educational Degrees.”
“Too late now. Not to take them must be one of the biggest mistakes of my life I’m regretting,” Blaise said dramatically. “You being so clever and all, why don’t you tell me who he is?”
“No, just whatever you’re taking,” Harry said, still feeling the rum tingling in his throat and mouth. “But not tequila!” he cried to Ron’s receding back. He didn’t have very pleasant memories of his first time trying tequila last summer.
Harry awoke to his alarm beeping loudly. He was still in Draco’s arms, and he felt Draco move and groan in protest.
“Easy, there.” He smirked. “You really ran all that way without tripping once, and yet you fall when you put your trousers on.” He snorted. “Better yet, you battled a Dark Lord and
bad. In Harry’s opinion, the Slytherins weren’t doing much except defending themselves. Although, Harry supposed that his opinion was rather biased these days.
They spent the dinner laughing and drinking. Malfoy did order a Buck’s Fizz, but after downing the whole glass, he ordered a bottle of wine for the table, which Harry found incredibly amusing. They were never silent (except for when the food arrived and they spent a few minutes simply appreciating how good it tasted) and Harry was sure they were being loud enough to counteract the muffling charm, but he didn’t care.
Harry skimmed the article and rolled his eyes. “You know, you’d think they’d do a bit of fact checking before they published these things.” He tossed the newspaper on the bed and turned to Ron and Hermione. “Shall we go down to breakfast?”
By the time Draco had finished wheezing, he had to wipe tears out of his eyes, and his voice was breathless. “You just love taking risks, don’t you?”
It had just slipped out, he hadn’t meant to say it. He was surprisingly used to telling Malfoy the truth now, and he had said too much. No one actually knew that about him. He supposed Ron and Hermione knew, except that what he had told them was fake. But, Malfoy? No, Malfoy wasn’t supposed to know - this would ruin everything, he was supposed to think Harry liking men was a lie.
“Harry.” Theodore smiled, and he spoke, getting straight to the point. “I was hoping to call in one of my favours.” Theodore said, his voice sure and bored as always.
day. He was finally going to tell him. Harry Potter was about to confess his love for Draco Malfoy. For the first time ever.
Draco pulled away slightly, his grip on Harry’s waist loosening slightly, so Harry gave him a bit of room and sat up slightly, still on top of him.
“Well, they like to imagine they’re real,” Harry said, clearing his throat slightly, “But, they don’t actually believe it. They tell ghost stories for fun, though.”
Malfoy was still leading him, and Harry found himself rather impressed by how well he was doing, considering Harry was quite possibly the worst partner one could ask for. “I don’t owe you anything, Potter. I just saved you from expulsion. If anything, you owe me.”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He wanted to hang up or scream at Draco or cry. “Oh.” He said, unsure of what to do next. “Okay. Yeah. If you want to.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, his face becoming almost unbothered. “I thought we were over this fight. Didn’t we just have it last week?”
It was a couple. They looked as though they were still in the middle of redressing as they walked out the library, and they were certainly too preoccupied with each other to notice anyone else was in there.
"I don't... really know how to start." Malfoy said, fiddling with his sleeves. "I guess, I'll just tell you everything."
.” He spread out his arms as though to prove his point. “It’s luxurious. You’ll have to teach me that charm.”
Draco glared at Harry, but it lacked malice and Harry could still see the way his mouth quirked up slightly as he did so.
Pansy rolled her eyes but took the clothes anyway. “Did you go through my stuff for -” Her eyes widened as she realised he had given her a thong to go with her pyjamas, and she promptly started swatting at Draco as he smirked. “You creep!”
He felt odd, waiting there when he wasn’t working. Sam had been teasing him endlessly since he had arrived - he had asked them to cover him for the day and they seemed to instantly know why. He had been waiting for 10 minutes already, although a glance at his watch told him that it still wasn’t 8 yet, and he had to stop himself from leaving the cafe and sprinting as far away as possible.
Blaise stretched as he spoke. “It’s not my fault that you guys got bad dares.” He stood up and flashed them a grin. “Although, I will admit that your dare was pretty funny, Potter. No wonder you’re in Gryffindor with all the bloody courage you have.” He yawned. “I’m off to bed.”
“Draco!” Harry said as Draco opened the door, before almost knocking the blonde over with the force at which he hurled his body towards him. He grabbed his face and kissed him hard, feeling Draco’s smile against his lips, and backing Draco into his apartment, shutting the door wandlessly.
When they made it to potions, they partnered up and finished the lesson with a potion that Slughorn almost swooned over.
Luna didn’t ask what was wrong. She simply hugged Harry as he shook and then made him a cup of tea. They sat in the Ravenclaw common room for a while, not speaking, until she suggested they go to visit the Thestrals. Harry hadn’t seen them since arriving back at Hogwarts, and he found them strangely comforting. Of course, he hadn’t needed to say that to Luna, because she somehow just knew anyway.
“You know what? Let’s not bother going out tonight, I think we should stay in instead.” Harry said, practically drooling.
Draco thought for a moment, his eyes fixed on the mark. “Fine, let’s sneak out to muggle London tonight. That’s a damn good present, Harry.”
“Relax, Ronald. There’s barely anyone around at this time of the year.” Draco said, although he couldn’t hide the smirk that was still on his face.
“I know, but… it’s… I also have…” Draco trailed off, and seemed as though he was at a loss for words.
Harry watched with wide eyes as he felt Draco hold in laughter from beside him. “What’s so funny?” Harry whispered, turning to Draco.
“So, Harry, I believe it was your turn to choose someone.” Draco said once everybody was sitting down.
Every time Malfoy took a sip, he closed his eyes for a moment, as though he were savouring the taste, and Harry tried not to think about it.
Draco grinned and Harry was so lost in the sight that, for a moment, he forgot that they weren’t alone. He mentally shook himself out of his thoughts and turned to see Pansy’s smirk.
Draco grinned. “I saw an opportunity and I took it.” He shrugged. “The favour was much appreciated, Harry.” He nodded to the Firewhiskey bottle that was working its way around the room. “Are you having some?”
George eyed up the Slytherins, a frown taking over his face. Harry held his breath. George had not been doing well since the war, and three Slytherins in his house could affect him badly. He felt Draco swallow beside him, and Harry instinctively moved in closer to him.
By Friday, the House Elves had started to send him packages of food, which Harry found both comforting and disturbing - his absence was being noticed. He wondered what people were saying about him, but quickly realised that’s not what he cared about. He cared about what
Harry laughed. “Damn, I think we both cover all three.” Malfoy grinned. “How did you know about this place?”
He saw it in everything now; on the train home for the holidays, when Malfoy had yawned and laid his head in Harry’s lap; when he had kissed Harry goodbye and told him “think of me” with a smirk; when Harry had greeted the Weasleys at the Burrow and could think nothing but
Tracey was the next Slytherin to come to Harry in a panic and, after Daphne’s panicked state when she asked to cash in her favour, he prepared himself for the worst. She had burst into the Gryffindor common room with a rather mouse-y looking boy in Ravenclaw robes, her eyes searching around the room. When she had finally seen Harry, she rushed over to him.
by you! Not to mention, he stayed with you as his father made disgusting public comments about the two of you, and now he’s fucking heartbroken over you! What can’t you see here, you oblivious idiot?”
Wow, it's been a long time since I've last updated - sorry! I lost momentum when writing for a little while there but I'm back in the swing of it so you can expect more regular updates from now on. I hope you enjoy!
“Potter and I have been… having the same dream.” Malfoy said, his voice slightly panicked. “From different perspectives, of course.”
“Right, yeah. Basically, when Voldemort tried to kill me for the first time, he accidentally made me into a horcrux. A part of him was… Sort of living in my head. And, because of that, I had some of his… qualities. Like, I could speak Parseltongue.” Harry hadn’t told many people about this, but he knew he could trust Draco with it. “And, I guess… I don’t know… I assumed that I wouldn’t be able to do that anymore, since he’s gone. But, what if… What if I’m still… Like him?”
“Ron Weasley.” He said, holding back a laugh. It wasn’t a question - he didn’t think it was a good idea to ask Draco any more questions at the moment.
Malfoy waited patiently as Harry made the drink, watching intently as Harry ground the coffee beans and started working. He didn’t say anything as Harry brought out the chocolate powder, or when he brought out the blender and he didn’t even blink when he saw the chilli powder emerge from below the counter. He momentarily raised his eyebrows when Harry went into the fridge to grab the butter, but he still made no sound. It only took Harry a couple of minutes - when he had first tried this recipe, it had taken him a while to master it, but now it was like second nature to him - and once he was finished, he handed the cup to Malfoy with a wary smile.
Harry felt his eyes fill up with tears and he forced himself to hold them back. He swallowed and nodded. “Thank you.” He whispered. “Draco…” He had so much he wanted to say to Draco about how he had forgiven him and how, in his moment of clarity when he was dead, he had also thought of Draco. Of how much he deserved forgiveness. But Draco shook his head before he could continue.
Harry cleared his throat. He looked over to Draco, who was finding this whole interaction hilarious according to the smirk on his face. Harry smiled sheepishly back at Ron. “It’s not what it looks like?”
When they entered the great hall, they did so quietly, not that it mattered. All eyes were on them as soon as the door creaked open and McGonagall was eyeing them with annoyance. They all took a seat at the Slytherin table, squishing in to ensure they all fit on the end.
Harry had waved goodbye to his family on boxing day. He was planning on staying until lessons resumed at Hogwarts, but the Slytherins were leaving on boxing day, and Harry was feeling rather tired after the night he had had yesterday.
He stormed through the eighth year common room - past the stares and the “are you okay”s and, oh yeah, he supposed he did look quite awful right now - and made his way to Draco’s room. He knocked on the door so hard and so fast that he was sure his knuckles would bruise if he continued for much longer, but luckily Draco answered the door rather quickly. The look on his face was a mixture of concern and annoyance, but he let Harry in without a word anyway.
Malfoy was still smiling, which Harry found extremely disconcerting, but assumed that his own face wasn’t all that nice to look at right now, either.
Draco’s voice was muffled when the Veritaserum pulled his answer out of him. “I’m not sure how to answer that - there’s been more than one.” He groaned, and Harry looked down at his quickly reddening face. “Blaise, please, no more questions."
“Come on, Harry.” Draco gave him a small, slightly concerned smile. “Where’s that good old Gryffindor courage?”
“Everyone needs to change into their pyjamas.” Draco said, his voice leaving no room for discussion. “Harry can’t be the only one who’s comfy.”
had not defeated him. This matter isn’t up for debate - you owe me a favour, and I am here to collect. Allow Narcissa Malfoy to sign off Lucius Malfoy’s assets on his behalf, or I assure you, I
“No, no, it’s great.” Malfoy was still smiling, which Harry wasn’t used to one bit. “Is this one on the menu?”
It was at that point that Malfoy stopped walking. He stopped and stared at Harry for a few moments, before asking, “You saw that drawing?” Harry had nodded at that and Malfoy had blinked and nodded back slowly. Then they started walking again, and didn’t stop until they got to the library.
They stood in awkward silence for quite a few moments before Harry finally sighed, rolled his eyes and took out his flask. He splashed a rather large amount into Luna’s cup, not caring if it would taste bad, then held it out to Malfoy.
Harry was exhausted. He had been sharing communal areas with the Slytherins for seven long days and he was
He was in potions, sitting at the back of the class as he always did, and Malfoy was sitting in the seat in front of him as
Harry wanted to ask why, but Malfoy pulled him slightly closer against the light breeze and Harry forgot what he wanted to say.
Harry nodded. He supposed small talk would be the best way to go. “Yeah, I’ve been meaning to take a trip to France, actually. I’m sort of sick of the British weather.”
Malfoy glared at Harry, but it lacked its usual venom. “It lists a number of spells that have reportedly been cast whilst the caster is unconscious.” He slid the book to the middle of the table, pointing to the list. “And Legilimency is listed.”
Harry rolled his eyes. He was tired of this routine. Every time he asked to speak to Malfoy, he reacted like this.
They pulled away after a few moments, and Harry tucked his forehead on to Draco’s shoulder, which was quickly becoming his new fake favourite spot. After a few minutes of stunned silence and a few hushed whispers, the Great Hall resumed its usual chatter and Harry and Draco ate their breakfast, speaking to each other with adoration.
Harry was about to tell them that he would leave, but Malfoy spoke first, maintaining eye contact with Harry as he talked.
Harry nodded, smiling. “Yeah, I’ve been experimenting with a lot of spices in my coffee. Turmeric actually works surprisingly well in hot drinks. I also put some black pepper in there, which you wouldn’t think would…” Harry realised he was rambling. “Sorry. That’s boring.”
idiots. How couldn’t he have seen this before? He had used up all of his magical energy to help the prat
Harry smiled. He started off at the beginning, keeping his voice quiet even though the silencing charm meant he didn’t have to. It wasn’t long before Draco’s breaths became deep and even and his face softened. Harry smiled at the sight and took his glasses off, placing them and the magazine on his bedside table. He sank down in his bed, and rolled over to face Draco, closing his eyes and slowing his breaths, not thinking about the fact he was in bed with Draco Malfoy, yet again.
For the first time in a long time, Harry and Draco walked in silence, not brushing arms and not laughing.
Malfoy’s smile widened. “Well, it’s excellent. More people should be putting butter and coffee together - they’re two of the greatest perks of life.”
doing, Harry?” Harry found himself backing up as Draco walked towards him, until he felt a wall at his back. “What the fuck was that in there?”
So, Sam had stuck around for a bit longer today, helping Harry out when he found himself slightly out of it. And, unfortunately for Harry, they were still there when Malfoy arrived.
He nibbled at Draco’s ear, which seemed to be the last straw for Draco. He let out a moan, and pulled Harry in for another kiss, a long one this time.
had nightmares. But then, the stag showed up, and I… I slept well. I started sleeping all the way through the night.”
“The next time I see you fighting - physical or not - I will be forced to give you detention,” She said, and Harry thought,
When Harry had returned to Hogwarts after the war for an additional eighth year, he had been expecting some challenges. He was expecting nightmares and grieving and apologies. What he
“What the fuck?” Draco seemed to wake up slightly at that, his head lifting and his voice becoming sharper. “God, we’ve fucked up our sleep schedules.”
When he had arrived at the Burrow, after all the reunions, he was bombarded with questions from the family, which were all along the lines of, “is it true about you and the Malfoy boy?”, “since when do you have a thing for blondes?”, “a slytherin?!”, “i always knew you went both ways!”, “so, is he a good kisser?”. Harry had simply laughed and said, “Sorry I didn’t tell you sooner”, leaving the Burrow in complete silence for the first time in… well, ever. He had waited for a response, any response, but everyone had simply stared at him until Ron said, “Bloody hell, if I had known this would shut them up,
He wasted the last few days of his Christmas holiday trying to distract himself from Draco. He helped Molly cook and clean, and helped Ginny with her holiday homework (as well as finishing every last piece of his) and discussed more muggle objects with Arthur than he had ever discussed in his life.
“Seems very reasonable to me.” Draco’s whispers were breathy and quiet as Harry gently nibbled on his neck, but his voice seemed to echo in Harry’s mind. “And what else?”
to know what Malfoy’s tattoo meant, but he was ignored every time he tried to find out. Of course, he realised that the ball was tomorrow, and his best shot at getting Malfoy’s attention was at the one place he was required to be.
“Hey, Malfoy! We brought you something.” Ron grinned as he spoke and Harry and Draco stood up to greet them.
Draco groaned. “I’ve gotten so used to being here with no one around. The halls are going to be so fucking crowded now.”
Harry let a small smile stay on his face and he swallowed past the lump in his throat that was forming at the mention of those who had died at the hands of Voldemort. There was a silence for a few moments before Arthur started talking about his work at the Ministry and all the reforms that Shacklebolt was overseeing. Harry was grateful for the distraction, but he couldn’t quite shake the heavy feeling that was seeping into his bones.
Malfoy’s hair was ruffled and his eyes were wide, but his familiar smirk stayed put. Harry trailed his eyes downwards and Malfoy seemed to shudder, even from above Harry. His chest was scarred, as Harry had expected, but what Harry hadn’t expected was how it would affect him. He had expected guilt and apologies, but instead, he felt nothing but pure lust. He had marked him before, and he was about to do it again. This was his chance to swap pain for pleasure and, fuck, was he excited to take it. As his eyes continued downwards, they stopped briefly on the Dark Mark, but,
Arthur stood up, smiling as he did so. He nodded to each of them, moving to shake their hands. “I’m glad you’re all here.” He said, and the smile on his face suggested that he really
“You get used to hearing it. Or, at least, I did.” Draco said, leading Harry through the corridors. “My father said it a lot.”
The three of them laughed at that. Harry was still in his pyjamas, but he didn’t care. He was used to people staring at him, especially when he was with the Slytherins, so it wasn’t much different from usual.
Harry took another swig. He glanced at his friends, who both shared another look, but they continued dancing anyway. Harry sighed. He decided that he would wait a while to talk to Malfoy. Too many eyes were on him right now, and McGonagall would likely hex Harry for getting too close. And… well, Malfoy had already started dancing with Luna, spinning her around, both giggling as they went.
At least, for Draco, being friends with Harry had come with its benefits. Since they had started hanging out with each other, he had only been hexed a few times, and Harry had ensured that none of them would ever do so again, yelling all kinds of threats at them until they practically sprinted away to the sound of Draco cracking up (“You’ll kill them like you killed Voldemort?” He had wheezed to Harry later, his laughing distracting him from saying Voldemort’s name, “Isn’t that a tad far?”)
Draco smiled at the use of his first name. “It’s been good. At first, it was a bit weird, but then me and Harry got together and I figured it couldn’t get any weirder than this.”
For a week, he forced a smile and moved on, decidedly refusing to look at Malfoy. It would help if he was able to get a good night’s sleep, but that was pretty much impossible for him. After the war, he was used to having nightmares that would leave him screaming himself awake, but now… Now, it was different. He was scared to fall asleep. He couldn’t remember his dreams, but they felt weird and… off. It was terrifying and it reminded him of when Voldemort was in his head. He would wake up feeling confused and hazy, and he felt as though his scar was hurting again, although he knew that was impossible. He almost convinced himself that Voldemort had risen from the dead, but it still felt slightly safer than when the noseless twat was around. He just felt uneasy. He tried to stay awake at night, his eyes drooping, and forcing himself to read yet another book. But, by morning, he found himself waking up, yet again, with no memory of falling asleep or of what his dreams contained.
Harry was sitting on a bench in the middle of the park. Wind was blowing harshly towards him, pulling tears from his eyes as he waited for Hermione to join him. She had a day off today, but Ron was still working on a case. It was probably for the best. Hermione had a gentler touch when it came to breakups. He had asked Sam to cover the cafe today and they were more than happy to do so, considering Harry had called them crying.
For the following few weeks, the newspapers continued to write long articles about Harry and Draco’s “scandalous partnership” whilst whispers followed them everywhere they went. Harry wasn’t surprised by Ron and Hermione’s protectiveness over him - they warded off anyone who came too close with threats to hex them into next week and they walked him to his classes whenever he asked them to (and whenever he didn’t, too) - but he
Harry heard his sarcastic drawl as he read his words, but his grin widened as he read the last line.
, and signing his name at the bottom. He took a deep breath before sealing up the letter and handing it to the Weasley’s owl. He watched as the bird took flight and carried away the parchment.
Harry trailed his kisses up until he met Draco’s mouth, kissing him hard and slow. “I think,” Harry said when they broke apart, “One of us,” He moved to Draco’s ear and whispered seductively, “Shouldn’t be able to walk tomorrow.”
“Well, that’s a lie, actually.” Draco said, his signature smirk on his lips. “Pansy brought over that insufferable Gryffindor from the year above, what was her name again?”
Harry shook his head. “No, you’re running away. This got too serious and you’re not fighting to keep it.”
Harry smiled at the thought. “A bunch of Gryffindors at the Slytherin games night. That’ll be… interesting.”
, he told himself. Although, he couldn’t help but notice the slight sense of disappointment in the back of his mind. He pushed down the nagging feeling as much as possible and took a deep breath.
Harry laughed. He really had missed Draco’s voice. “My time away from you has been tragic.” Harry said, decidedly not thinking about the fact that it
“One more time.” He said, his hands on Draco’s hips. “For old times’ sake.” With that, he kissed Draco again and turned him around quickly, so that Harry was pressing Draco against the wall now.
There was a long silence where no one spoke, but Blaise eventually sighed and said, “Well, fuck, mentioning the war sure does make everyone a bit less
“Yes, but now Shacklebolt’s the Minister.” Harry thought this may actually work. “He doesn’t like to cut corners. Maybe, if I talked to him, he would be okay with going through the whole process. And Lucius is in prison - usually prisoners in Azkaban don’t sign things, their trustees do.”
Harry blinked. He heard Draco let out an awkward cough and Harry sighed. “Umm… I wanted to make sure the decorations were right.”
anything, they had to drink, whenever someone touched the ground when they shouldn’t, they had to drink, whenever someone forgot to swap clothes with the person they were kissing, they had to drink, and
Harry took a deep breath. “Okay… So… Remember when I first asked you to do the whole fake boyfriend thing?” Draco nodded, a crease staying firmly between his brows. “Well, I said that…” Harry took another deep breath, and then started speaking all in a rush, afraid that if he stopped, he would never start again. “I said that I chose you so there was no chance of me actually falling in love with my fake boyfriend, and well, I suppose that I should have chosen someone else because… Well, because…” He sighed and shook his head. “I fucking love you, Draco. I’m in love with you. Deeply. Unfortunately.”
Once they made it to the door, they all took a collective breath before stepping inside, the warmth and noise hitting them quickly. Molly smiled at them instantly, coming to hug all of them at once, leaving the dishes to clean themselves.
Harry thought about it. It made sense. After all, he wasn’t sure what he would do if Draco asked him about his childhood and he had no choice but to answer. He wasn’t quite ready to share that with him yet. “You’re right.”
“You didn’t deserve that. No one does… I should never have… It wasn’t your fault…” Harry was rambling, so consumed by his guilt that it took him a moment to realise that Draco was speaking.
After a few more minutes, a comfortable silence fell between the two of them. Harry felt as though the seven minutes were almost up, and Draco must have felt the same way, because he spoke rather quickly.
Their plan had involved an eventual breakup at the end of eighth year that left both of them free from their fake relationship, Draco with an improved status in society, and Harry without a group of girls following him everywhere he went. But, Harry trusted Draco so much now that he couldn’t imagine being apart from him. He didn’t know what to do, and he couldn’t even talk to Ron and Hermione about it. So, instead, he decided that he and Draco would cross that bridge when they came to it. After all, as Draco had pointed out, none of Harry’s plans ever worked out, anyway. This year was supposed to be fun, and he intended on keeping it that way, even if that meant hiding his feelings for Draco.
Except, now he had done all the paperwork and a deep clean and it was basically dark now, but he decided to sit down for a coffee. Decaf, of course, nobody drinks coffee when it’s dark. And he was about to leave, he really was, but the bell chimed. And, if he was here, he could serve one last customer past closing time. And it was Malfoy.
“There’s got to be something. I know they’re not normal dreams, Nott. I woke up with bruises from Draco’s fingers on my wrist. Normal dreams don’t do that, do they? There has to be something wrong, something you’ve missed. Something you’ve overlooked, something you’ve not tested for?”
The bastard is looking at you, one eyebrow arched and a challenge in his eyes. His lips are inches away from yours, and you could bite them to stop the words from coming out, you could kiss them, you could crowd him against the wall and...
“He’s an idiot, but Lord help me, you are too!” she replies, jabbing a ghostly finger at the centre of Harry’s chest. “Do you know what I would have given for a chance at love when I was alive? Can you even understand what it feels like for everything you want to be completely impossible? Completely unspeakable? You think you know because you’re so very sad and the one boy you love so very much is being an absolute cretin, but you have no idea. No idea. I’d have had to marry a man, had I lived. I’d have had to kiss him and lie with him and bear his children without ever loving him a single day in my life. And you know what? I would have given anything to find a girl with whom I could make it work. I would have killed for that chance Harry, and I will not watch you throw it away like it’s not worth fighting for!”
“I couldn’t stand the thought I was loved, back then. I didn’t think I deserved it. It hurt too much. I couldn’t tell you I loved you either, I was so afraid to let you down. In the end, it’s exactly what I did, isn’t it?”
“I’m sorry too,” Harry whispers. “I’m sorry that it ended the first time. I’m sorry that I hurt you. I love you, Draco. I always will. I respect that you need to leave. It’s okay. I wish we had more time, I wish life had been kinder too.”
I don’t know what I expect from him, in that moment. I expect him to take me in his arms, maybe. To kiss me, even. To say something witty or cutting or self-deprecating.
“Oh, I can’t understand,” Draco hissed. “No, I wouldn’t understand what it feels like sacrificing myself, would I? But let me tell you something, Harry—you’re never going to get better if you don’t stop putting every single person in the entire world before yourself. You’re never going to stop having nightmares, and you’re never going to stop feeling like you’re made out of guilt, and you’re never going to figure out how to be happy. And I can’t be there to hold your hand through every anxiety attack because you felt like sacrificing yourself—again—for people who couldn’t care less about you. That’s not fair on me, is it? You go play hero for a crowd, then you come back and you expect me to pick up all the pieces of you and somehow be okay with it. Well, I can’t. It’s too much for me, Harry. I can’t always be your crutch. You need to learn to stand on your own.”
She doesn’t say anything else—not hello, or how are you, or I need your help. She doesn’t request a chair or follow up that statement with anything at all. She just says she’s been drugged as the words have been sitting like knives upon her tongue for days and waits.
“I…” Hermione starts, then stops. “Well, I forgot to eat lunch. Theobalt from Ancient Manuscript finally found the time to bring me that 14th-century treatise on mind magic I requested a couple of months ago and I just couldn’t wait to open it. I nibbled a couple of biscuits from the packet I keep in my desk drawer—not while I was reading, of course, I have manners,” she adds with a pointed look at me. She always used to give us grief when we opened our school books at the dinner table and stained them with all manner of edible matter.
You’d been lying on the floor of your bedroom again, crushed under the weight of every emotion you’d ever felt in your entire life. There were ants in your bloodstream and your heart was beating like a tribal drum against your ribs, and you were half-convinced you’d have thrown up your liver and lungs if organs worked that way. And you knew how to deal with that, you did. All you needed to do was hold on until it passed, was fight the waves of nausea and choke back the tears. (You couldn’t.)
By the time the officials take a polite leave, Mrs Brodard is learning a TikTok dance in the piano room under the careful tutelage of a pair of Muggle-born siblings and Agnès is animatedly discussing a makeup tutorial with a young squib boy in a flowery dress and bright blue Doc Martens. Draco is standing in front of the French door and staring out onto the park, bushes and brambles long gone and replaced by a lush lawn that stretches past the tall shade of the Lebanon cedars and out onto green pastures. Harry reaches for his waist. It’s a familiar gesture by now: they’ve learned to find comfort in all the quiet touches of everyday life. Draco turns and smiles, pride and happiness and love glowing on his face all at once.
I hear a frantic voice asking me if I’m okay. I know that voice, but grief and loss take up all the space in my brain and I can’t remember who it belongs to. A hand grabs my wrists and pulls me flush towards a warm body. Hermione, my mind supplies as my face is buried into dark curls.
He’s fucking himself on your cock, and you’re crying out his name, the carefully distant “Malfoy” blurring into the round syllables of “Draco”, because he’s been Draco ever since you first fucked against a wall in the back alley of a dingy pub and you’ve only been kidding yourself ever since. He’s moving excruciatingly slowly, lowering himself down the length of your cock, stroking himself, eyes half-lidded and pleasure-blurred. And if you could think clearly, you’d realise he knew exactly what you needed him to do. He made you give up control, he made you let go entirely. He made you feel safe and warm and seen, in a way no one else seems to be able to.
Please note that this chapter is explicit. If that's not your thing, you can skip to/wait for the next chapter.
“It’s magical, Draco, and well... You helped with Grimmauld. It’s your job, isn’t it? Fixing magical houses. It’s what you do. It’s a purely professional request, I assure you. How much do you want for the job? I’ll pay you.”
“Can you tell me why you think that?” I ask, shuffling the case files on my desk in search of a quill.
In his letters, Draco had felt like an endless stream of promises and secrets, like the sun in the sky, like a fire in the night. Draco had felt like a kindred spirit, like the only other person in a world populated by the painted-on smiles of mannequins. Draco had understood the pain, had understood the rage, and when he kissed Harry in a moonlit forest, surrounded by trees and silence, Harry thought his heart was going to burst open with brightly coloured happiness-confetti.
“Not using anything against you, just missed my boyfriend,” Harry said, pushing Draco against the wall before he started snogging him properly.
“He bought you drinks the whole night?” Harry asked suspiciously, feeling a stab of jealousy. Merlin, he couldn’t afford to be jealous, it was he who had proposed being friends after all. Besides, Draco probably meant what he had said; the guy, Chris, was certainly only a friend and nothing more, right?
Harry felt a bit relieved. “I know you can’t be nice to me publicly, but if you’re with me, I want you to be only with me.”
, which made them both feel uneasy. Harry wished he was alone in the compartment with only Ron and Hermione, so they would’ve been able to discuss if that could mean Malfoy had a hunch about Sirius.
“Of course you didn’t,” Hermione said hastily, looking a bit nervous as if she wasn’t sure how well Harry would take someone teasing him about Draco. “But I agree with Ginny, it’s good you’re talking again.”
“Yes, I’m sure. We’re, erm, friends of sorts. So, no need to worry,” Harry said, trying to reassure the elf. “Thank you, Dobby.”
“Oh, nothing out of the ordinary, this one is just sulking as if it was the doomsday,” Ginny peeped, pointing at Harry with a mischievous smile on her lips.
Harry didn’t do it only because he was curious. He knew he was that, too, but the main reason why he started following Draco was Harry’s increasing worry for him. After Katie Bell’s incident, Draco had started to become more and more distant and anxious every time Harry saw him. He hardly ate anymore, he had gotten dark shadows under his eyes, he skipped classes, and every time he managed actually to go to classes, to the library or just walk in the corridors, he had a glazed and lost look in his eyes. It wasn’t any better when Harry and Draco met in private. On better days, Draco was gloomy and unresponsive, although he was present at least on some level, whereas on worse days, Draco seemed to be completely out of reach, not hearing Harry talking to him nor reacting when Harry touched him. Those days made Harry feel horrified and utterly useless, and no matter what he tried, he wasn’t able to coax Draco out of his grim reality Harry knew nothing of.
They ran back to their cloth piles, giggling the whole way like five-year-old kids. After casting a few Drying and Warming Charms and putting their clothes back on, they both started to feel the calmness engulfing them both mentally and physically. The blood ran hotly in their veins making their muscles relax, and they started to feel pleasantly drowsy and content.
Harry touched his lips softly, still feeling Malfoy’s kiss ghosting on his mouth. He had no idea where the urge to touch Malfoy, kiss him again and try to know him better had suddenly come. Although, now that Harry thought again, there had always been some strange energy between him and Malfoy. Even though Malfoy was a true pain in the arse, Harry had still always noticed him, been so aware of his presence and felt some kind of pull towards him. Malfoy was attractive, even Harry could admit it by now.
“Yes. Tried to slip away but it seemed like Finnegan refuses to take a no for an answer,” Draco said, half-annoyed, half-amused.
“McGonagall told me you’ve failed to do Transfiguration homework twice in a row. Why didn’t you tell me? I could’ve helped you,” Harry said, snaking his arms around Draco’s waist. There was something wrong, and Harry wanted desperately to know what.
“Or no, well, what I mean is that it doesn’t matter if you fancy boys, girls or both. I’m just really, really happy you’re being open with yourself, and that you wanted to confide in me with this. I was just surprised you were ready to talk about this.”
“One of my weakest moments, it’s never going to repeat,” Draco said, turning the pages again. “And who, in Salazar’s name, do these people think they are?” he asked, pointing at two astronauts next to a space rocket.
Malfoy’s behaviour towards Harry had also changed, and now Malfoy had decided to ignore Harry pointedly. He sat every meal in the Great Hall with his back facing Harry, and he refused to even look Harry in the eye when they bypassed each other on the corridors. Even Snape looked seemingly confused and disappointed when he couldn’t hear Malfoy and Harry’s usual bickering even though they were paired in the Potions again. At first, Harry had tried to get Malfoy’s attention, but he had soon noticed it was a lost cause, so he thought ignoring the git would be the easiest option.
Harry sighed. “Well, erm, Draco kissed me at the beginning of autumn, and then it got quite messy and then I realized I had feelings for him, too, and then we started seeing each other.”
. The thing they had had before the War and that was now still in a sort of dormant state, hovering between them as a pressing, grey cloud that was just about to rain or storm. Harry just didn’t feel like he was ready to even discuss that…
“Yeah but that’s the whole point. If this contraption was wizard made I wouldn’t bat my eyelid, but how in Salazar’s name can this be
“An improvement, you think? I’ve got so much more troubles to refrain from just grabbing your shirt and kissing you in front of everybody these days. You think your friend Weasley would appreciate that?”
At first, Harry couldn’t believe Wizengamot’s decision to be true. It had to be only a joke as it was completely against all the ideas and values the light side had fought for. But when Harry read from the Daily Prophet about the first Death Eaters to be executed, the Carrow siblings, only a couple of weeks after the War had ended, he felt like someone would have abruptly pushed him headfirst into the cold water. This couldn’t be true. This didn’t make any sense. Harry hadn’t been ready to die for the Wizarding world so that they could dirty their hands with the opposite side’s blood after the War.
Draco regarded the thin ice cover on the lake while images of his episode came streaming back to his mind. This time, though, the panic didn't take over, even if he still felt rather anxious. He had seen all that coming, even though he had managed to lie to himself for a long time. Draco sighed heavily. He knew that there was no way he could continue lying to himself, not anymore, not after that night. Somehow Draco felt even a little relieved. At least he knew now what was happening to him. Or rather to the insides of his head.
Draco nodded. “I explained everything to them. I thought it was best that way.” He smiled again. “Otherwise, I reckon they would have tried to kill you. They were pretty fucking angry at you.”
“Are you sure it was a stag?” Hermione asked, frowning, as she always did when faced with a problem that she needed to find an answer to.
Malfoy laughed. “Yeah, but this stuff isn’t rational. Seriously, don’t worry about it. It’s normal and you’ll be okay.” Malfoy gave Harry’s hand one last squeeze, then placed it down on the table with a smile.
Malfoy paid the bill when it arrived and Harry tried to protest but then Malfoy moved his leg again and Harry fell silent as he finished his brownie. He wondered how the hell he was going to be able to walk when he was like this, but he didn’t have long to consider it because as soon as he had finished eating, Malfoy dragged him up by his hand and hurried him out of the restaurant.
been expecting was the amount of anger that his fellow classmates seemed to be capable of possessing.
weird?” Pansy said, her head resting in Ginny’s lap. “Blaise was getting on rather well with Charlie Weasley.”
“How’s Draco doing?” Harry tried to ask casually, tried to pretend he hadn’t been trying to ask Ron for days, but Ron knew him too well and his eyebrows furrowed.
Draco rolled his eyes and swatted Harry with the nearest book he could grab, but Harry was very aware of the fact that he didn’t deny it.
Dean and Seamus found it hilarious, as they were likely the ones who had made it, and so did Harry. He burst out laughing when he saw it and ended up moving it above the portrait of the Fat Lady so everybody passing by could see it. She was less than pleased, but couldn’t exactly do anything about it, so she settled for complaining loudly whenever anybody commented on it.
Draco seemed to know exactly what Harry was thinking, because after a moment, he said, “This isn’t my real room.”
“Well, I…” He began, and he moved closer to Draco, taking his hand and lacing their fingers together. “
The rest of their breakfast was filled with not-so-subtle jokes about Ron’s face, last night’s revelations with Veritaserum, and nervous glances at McGonagall (although, that was mostly Hermione). Harry didn’t even think about the way that Pansy and Blaise were still muttering to each other about god-knows-what until they stood up to leave. Because that was when Blaise had dipped Harry and kissed him hard, rather dramatically.
Malfoy had been telling Harry stories about his summer in France spent with Pansy and Blaise. He was a good storyteller, Harry thought. He added a dramatic touch to his stories that left Harry wheezing, and he told every little detail as though it was the most important part, running his sentences together until he’d almost forgotten what he was originally saying. He had already heard about Malfoy’s time spent at the nude beaches, where he found himself burnt in the most painful places possible, as well as his dinner with a most respectable French pureblood wizard who insisted on Malfoy staying the night and kept on trying to get into the guest bed with him (Harry almost pissed himself at that one - Malfoy’s French accent was spot on), as well as about ten other stories, each of which Harry loved as much as the last. Malfoy was currently talking about one of his nights out with Pansy and Blaise, and Harry was intently listening, his hand propping up his head as he leaned in to Malfoy to ensure he heard every part.
Harry looked out of the train window, watching as the fields rolled by. Soon, he would be at Hogwarts - at home - but he wasn’t excited. This was the last time he would be riding this train to the castle, but he couldn’t enjoy it. All he could focus on was Draco sitting next to him.
He took another deep breath and shook his head, unable to believe he was about to do this, but began to walk towards Malfoy, nonetheless. His heart was racing faster with every step he took. By the time he made it to Malfoy’s table, he was convinced he was having a heart attack, but still smiled at the blonde boy when he looked up in confusion.
Harry grinned. Dean chucked him his pile of clothes from the sofa and Harry smiled gratefully at him. Draco turned around with a smirk on his face. “Merlin, that man would do anything for you.” His eyes flicked down for a moment as Harry was pulling on his boxers and Harry tried not to react to it.
The next stage of their plan came into place when they went to Hogsmeade together on Saturday. Practically all of Hogwarts was there, and they decided it was the perfect time to take their fake relationship to the next level. They were sitting in the Three Broomsticks with most of the seventh and eighth years, enjoying a drink. They had chosen a table that was separate from everyone else, but still visible to most of the others - Harry decided it wasn’t quite time for Draco to be hanging out with all of his other friends yet but wanted to ensure that the rumours would be flying tomorrow.
He considered going another way - there were a dozen other routes that he could take back to his room and the last thing he wanted right now was to see Malfoy’s fucking smile - but, he ultimately decided to keep on walking towards him. He wasn’t going to let the bastard commandeer the quickest shortcut to his own bloody room.
“I slept in my parents’ room that night. And, the night after that. And, the night after that. Until, eventually, they brought me into my own room and told me they would stay by me the whole night as I slept to make sure I was okay. My room was freezing - I hadn’t been in it for days - but, I went to bed, anyway, feeling their presence in the room and drifting off to sleep knowing I was okay.”
He thought about Malfoy for a moment. Luna said he was good to her. And he would travel to the ends of the earth for Luna.
Harry was not prepared for that. ‘Surprise me’s were rare and Harry had never pictured Malfoy as a ‘surprise me’ type. He seemed to be quite a fussy person, if Harry’s memory served him well, and he was
Draco took his hands off Harry’s wrists, but Harry didn’t dare move them. In a swift motion, Draco pulled Harry’s pants down, moaning at the sight. He looked into Harry’s eyes for a moment, smirking, before moving down Harry’s body, kissing him, until he got to Harry’s cock. Harry groaned in pleasure. He moved his hands from above his head to grip Draco’s hair and felt Draco moan against his dick at the feeling.
Harry cupped Draco’s face and stared into his eyes, speaking slowly. “You’re right, it doesn’t change it. It doesn’t change the fact that your father had this planned out for you before you were even born. Or the fact that Voldemort threatened your family. Or the fact that you didn’t have a choice.”
“You did?” Draco frowned, taking the parchment and scanning through it quickly, before gasping and looking at Harry again. The joy in his eyes made Harry forget everything. He forgot all of his pain and thought,
to be this close to him, and he should have moved away by now. As though he could read Harry’s thoughts, Draco pulled away from him, but he stayed close and Harry could still feel his light breaths on his neck.
“Guess this is the end.” Harry put as much malice into his words as possible, but found it difficult to speak to Draco in such a way.
Except, Harry saw Malfoy yawn the next day as they sat at their table. He covered his mouth, polite as ever, and put down the cup in his hand. He rested his head on his hand as he listened to Harry speak, and Harry watched as Malfoy’s finger ran over one of his scars. It was a subconscious movement and Harry doubted he even realised he was doing it, but
Harry nodded. He was a Gryffindor who Harry wasn’t keen on. He had seen him shove around a first year the other week, and he hadn’t stopped until McGonagall gave him detention.
Harry turned to him, excitement filling him. “I’m getting Narcissa’s assets back. And I’m getting Draco back, too.”
And then, Malfoy wasn’t kissing him. He was pulling back and speaking, his voice low and rough and delicious.
. “We’ve noticed an unacceptable level of rivalry between houses, especially since returning this year.”
“It took them a few moments to hear me. It took them a few moments more to come through. And it took them all of one second to realise what was happening and hit the man on the back of his head. But, it was the strangest thing, when my dad lunged forwards, he fell through the man, not able to touch him. I watched as the man disappeared before me, into the shadows, like he had done before, except this time it felt as though he were still inside the house. It felt like he was in every shadow of the house, watching me. I couldn’t sleep that night.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Please, they won’t back down from a challenge. Especially here, of all places.”
“Not so bad yourself, Draco.” Harry grinned, very aware of the fact that all eyes were on them. “Oh god, people will be expecting us to go on dates to Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop now, won’t they?” Harry said quietly, his forehead still against Draco’s as whispers filled the room around them.
Harry was in hell. He had been watching Malfoy laugh and smile with his friends for a whole week now and he hated every minute of it. McGonagall somehow seemed to always be around nowadays. He would glare at Malfoy for a moment, a mere second, and she would be watching them, making sure Harry didn’t get too close to the blonde. Harry was sure his friends were getting very bored of his complaining, but he didn’t care. He was in hell.
Harry stopped in his tracks when he realised that Ron was already awake, looking at Draco, his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open, toothbrush just barely staying in his mouth.
Draco looked up from the ground and gave Harry’s hand a squeeze. He led Harry to his bed and they both sat down cross-legged and facing each other. Draco was wearing short sleeves and Harry noticed his tattoo. The flowers looked as though they were dying, some petals barely hanging on, and the white stars were barely visible, having been dimmed. Harry knew what this meant. Of course, he wasn’t surprised that Draco wasn’t happy right now, but he found himself feeling very affected by this. It suddenly hit him that when Draco had chosen this tattoo, he had chosen to be vulnerable and show other people how he was feeling. He didn’t do that often. He seemed to always be wearing a mask when he was in public.
Ginny shifted slightly in her seat, but Ron nudged her and said, “Go on, Gin. It’ll be fun!”, and she nodded reluctantly.
By the time Malfoy came back into the shop the next day, Harry had promised himself that he wouldn’t mention the scars - they were getting along well and speaking about the war wouldn’t help things. He had been planning on keeping his promise, he really had.
Tracey Davis was an alright kisser, although Harry suspected she was rather nervous. It didn’t last very long, which she seemed grateful for, but it still had the desired effect. Noise surrounded them as soon as they kissed and Harry wondered how much longer he would be doing this before people would work out what he was up to.
“Thanks.” Harry muttered, but he didn’t trust himself to say anything else so he waited for the others to pick a new topic of conversation and move on.
“So, really, the Sacred 28 is now the Sacred 14.” Harry said, looking at the list warily. “That’s still a lot of families.”
“It has come to my attention,” She began, silencing everyone in the process. “That many students have been ignoring our new policy on interhouse unity.” A few murmurs were heard, but she held up her hand and silence fell. “I wish to make it clear that I
Harry laughed. He found Malfoy’s company so easy, which he was sure his 17-year-old-self would find ridiculous, but he didn’t care. He was happy like this. He was happy with Malfoy.
“Good morning, Theodore.” Harry said, smiling in Neville’s direction but not distracting him from his reading.
, Harry thought. He was the one who had gotten Harry into this mess and yet he was completely unaffected by it.
Malfoy must have noticed that because he continued. “The thing between me and her was never real. I’ve tried to make me like girls, but it’s never worked out,” Malfoy said, sighing. “It felt wrong, thinking about you when I was kissing her. So, I ended things with her. And being in a fake relationship wasn’t fair to her, either.”
“Hey, I could go flying with you! If it’s okay my broom isn’t as fast as yours,” Ron said, mouth full of toast and sausage.
“Of course I won’t tell anyone, you git. You know I support you no matter what,” Ginny said, reassuringly. “So, who is it?”
After that, Anne stopped interrogating Harry, which made him relax quite a lot. The conversation flowed mostly from everyone’s Christmas plans to the group’s other nights out and who had done and what then. Harry’s favourite part was probably the stories about Draco’s first experiences with different kind of Muggle stuff, and Harry couldn’t stop laughing when Anne and Olivia told him how Draco had been so startled by the automatic doors in a supermarket he had almost fallen and cried out for Merlin, God and Jesus, all of them in the same sentence.
“So, a vodka drinker then?” Malfoy asked, watching pointedly Harry’s glass that was now filled to the brim.
Good, now just a little more. He could do it, he knew he could. Just a little bit more, and then he’d be free again.
“Oh, nonsense. Did you really think we’d invite you here to celebrate Christmas with us and let you avoid our traditional Christmas presents?” Molly asked, smiling softly at Draco.
“It’s nothing, really,” Harry said, a bit embarrassed as he tried to pull his hand away, but Malfoy just held his hand even tighter.
Harry flinched. He had said to Ron and Ginny it was okay if they told their other family members about Harry and Draco as he didn’t want to make them keep it secret, especially now that the Weasleys were so close to Andromeda and Teddy. Harry hadn’t just talked yet about the topic face to face with other Weasleys than Ron and Ginny, and he didn’t even know how much exactly Molly and the others knew.
“Oh yes, wasn’t that a fun time,” Ginny said, staring gloomily at his brother. “He could try to learn from Fred and George for once, they barely bat an eye when they hear what I’m doing and with whom. Even Hermione’s being nice to Blaise.”
“I think you should tell him, too. I hate to keep this kind of secrets from either of you and, besides, it’d really make you feel better as well. I’m sure it’s safe to tell him.”
Ginny had clearly sensed Harry getting more tense and anxious because she took Harry’s hand and squeezed it comfortingly. “It’s fine, we’ve found a spot far from everybody else,” she said.
Draco stiffened when Harry came closer but he still didn't pull away. “Are you sure you know what you’re talking about? What if I hurt you again?” Draco asked hesitantly. How could Harry trust him when Draco felt like he couldn't trust even himself?
“Ah, I see, your dear Auntie Bella has taught you Occlumency. At least you’re not as hopeless a case as your paramour,” Snape said coolly. “Tell me, Draco, does Potter know about your little plan?”
“Oh, and Ginny. The first time we were all hanging out together she looked at me like she was sure I had cursed or poisoned you,” Draco said, laughing now against Harry’s shoulder.
“Don’t want to talk about that,” Harry said, looking grimly at the ground. “Nothing too bad happened, really, let’s just say they didn’t… consider me as a part of their family.”
“So you’d use me as some kind of a weapon to get your will through? No thanks, go and find another charity case for your mission.”
“Maybe we should do something about it. It’s not fair the whole school is rather prejudiced towards one House. Even some of the teachers treat the Slytherins differently, and they’re the ones who’re supposed to be the adults here,” Hermione said, her eyes glinting the way they always did when she found injustice in the world and wanted to repair it.
I don’t want to spread an idea all the Jehovah’s Witnesses would do something like this and shut one completely out of the family because I honestly don’t believe all of them would do it (although I’ve read too many stories about people who have been shut out one way or another for different reasons). And it’s not like it’s a problem only amongst Jehovah’s Witnesses, there are many other conservative religious groups that do this as well. It was mainly the idea of organizing a funeral for a living family member that stuck in my head. Never read any other group doing something like that, especially these days. And I don’t know how much it happens, I only know it happens.
“You don’t even know what Muggles can do, they’ve created quite complex systems and societies,” Harry said. “Besides, I don’t think it has anything to do with what they can or cannot do, it’s more about the fear of something unfamiliar. From both sides.”
“No, of course not,” Harry said, turning his eyes to Andromeda’s hazel-brown ones. “I just don’t understand. You don’t know him at all. Are you sure you can trust him?”
“It just keeps the cut clean and helps it to heal. And now I can’t smudge everything with my blood.”
Molly, on the other hand, seemed to be extremely happy having two of her sons and Harry staying over, and she had prepared them a proper feast with so many dishes they had no chance to eat even half of the food. As the night proceeded, Harry started to slowly feel more relaxed listening to Arthur explaining about the latest Muggle artefacts he had bought and George explaining about the newest Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products he had just started to sell in his shop. The loss of Fred, and all the others, was still heavily present, but just for a moment, it was nice to be able to talk about small, mundane things that brought some happiness into everyone’s lives.
“To Draco’s defence, he’s barely off age, and it’s not like any of us would’ve had big parties when we were in our teens,” Olivia said solidarily. “I didn’t even get to watch TV because it was considered as the Devil’s invention to mess up with our heads.
“Are we having guests?” Draco asked, nonplussed, as he viewed the robes, but his mother had already left the room.
Harry looked at his friend, feeling flabbergasted. “But they can’t… This doesn’t… Oh, for fuck’s sake, I wasn’t ready to die for them so that they could start killing more people completely wantonly! The killing was supposed to end when the War ended!”
Harry turned his eyes to Draco. He had known Draco’s thoughts about the blood system and non-magical people hadn’t been just light, meaningless taunting, he truly believed in what he was saying. Still, it was strange to get to know Draco and start liking him meanwhile he was talking about things like blood superiority as if they were pure facts.
“I know. It was such a nice time,” Ginny said, smiling a little. “I’m sure it’s going to get easier at some point again. It can’t go on like this indefinitely,” she continued, nudging Harry in the side.
Harry wasn’t exactly in the mood for presents but he took the present in his hands anyway. It was as neatly wrapped as the one on Christmas, but this time it was in purple wrapping paper with a silvery ribbon. Harry opened it hastily, throwing the wrapping paper aside.
“Hi,” Harry said, placing his hand on Draco’s shoulder and making Draco startle. “You’re here as well?”
When Draco got finally out, he was sure the air had never smelt as good and fresh as it did that day. For a moment he just stood outside, taking lungfuls of air and enjoying the sun playing on his face. It was probably the first time after the War he had even registered things like how the sun felt on his skin and how good it actually could feel just to breathe. The War made one strangely forget it really was possible to enjoy your senses instead of realizing their existence only when you were in mortal danger.
Harry tried not to laugh. “Muggles can’t do magic, remember? It’s because of magic our pictures and paintings can move and even speak,” Harry said. “Though Muggles do have this thing called television. There they can see moving and speaking pictures as well.”
They didn’t say a word as they slipped under the covers and threw most of the pillows off the bed. Once they both were laying on their backs, next to each other, they were still feeling rather awkward as they stared at the canopy in silence.
Abruptly someone gripped Draco's trembling shoulder. "Draco, look at me,” Blaise said calmly but firmly, obliging Draco's eyes to his.
“Of course we were. We, or, well, you especially, didn’t have a choice, either. I can honestly say I don’t know what I would’ve done in Malfoy’s position,” Hermione said.
“Not really. But now that you mentioned it, I think they fit quite well for an almost-Slytherin,” Draco said, handing the present to Harry. “You don’t get to open it before Christmas. And you know I do get to know if you’ve cheated.”
Malfoy crashed his lips against Harry’s, trying to kiss him fervently. Harry froze as he felt Malfoy’s warm mouth moving against his. It wasn’t at all like Harry had thought his first kiss would be, tender, clumsy, shy and thrilling. Something beautiful that would make him have butterflies in his stomach. There was nothing beautiful in Malfoy’s kiss. It was desperate and even violent as Malfoy was pushing himself too hard against Harry, gripping his arms too tight and moving his lips and teeth too harshly against Harry’s as if pleading Harry to answer the kiss.
They didn’t make it higher than a couple of steps, though, before Draco could no longer put any weight at all on his feet. Potter was probably about to offer to carry him up the stairs, but as he noticed the threatening look on Draco’s face, he decided to Apparate them instead straight into the room that was apparently supposed to be Draco’s bedroom, even though they both knew very well Apparating wouldn’t be a good solution in Draco’s current state.
To admit being gay was hard. Draco's unconscious mind had given him hints for years, but Draco had simply ignored them and tried to bury them somewhere deeper. He couldn't be gay. There was a huge contradict in Draco's mind, and he didn't know how to handle it. How could one be something they weren't supposed to be? Draco was well aware of all the expectations towards him, and those definitely didn't include courting another bloke. Draco was supposed to marry a nice, pureblood witch and produce an heir, simple as that. If he didn't meet those expectations, he would let his family down and would most likely be disowned and thrown out of the family. Or actually, of the whole pureblood culture and basically everything Draco was familiar with. There wasn't a bigger shame for a proper pureblood family than a son with some sick… proclivities. Draco's father had always made very clear his opinions on poofters. They were as worthless as muggles and Mudbloods, or maybe even worse. And Draco had already been such a disappointment to his father by letting some Mudblood girl top him on school grades. Draco's greatest desire had always been to be worthy of his father's admiration and acceptance, so he couldn't just let his father down, not anymore.
But Harry didn’t let go. It oddly reminded him of the almost exactly similar situation nearly a year ago when Draco had made Harry show him his
“Draco, here’s a picture of you,” Andromeda said, handing Draco a picture she had found from the pile. “Your mother sent it to me when you were one year old. After that, I heard nothing from you nor my sister.”
“I’ve almost killed two people!” Draco exclaimed desperately, making Harry inhale sharply. There was no way to go around this, not anymore. Harry felt like his mind was suddenly whirling as thoughts and images about Draco’s behaviour during the whole year filled his head. The worst of all was that Harry knew he had known the whole time, ever since the cursed necklace. He had just managed to be so stubborn and seen only what he had wanted to see.
“Er, so, Strengthening Solution. You’ve done this one before?” Malfoy asked, stumbling awkwardly over his words.
Ginny nodded. “He told me about you two from his perspective. And even about the time before the thing between you and Malfoy officially started. It’s good for Malfoy to have a friend like him.”
After a couple of seconds, the moment was gone. Malfoy let go of Harry and took hastily two steps backwards as if Harry was something utterly sickening. Harry watched at Malfoy’s face without being able to say anything. He looked suddenly shocked, lost and frightened, as if he had no idea what he had just done or where he was at that moment. Malfoy’s hands started to shake as he took more steps backwards.
Malfoy chuckled. “Tell me you want me,” he whispered as he started to rub his and Harry’s erections together.
“Merlin, Draco,” Harry gasped as he felt Draco’s lips on his neck and Draco’s hands founding their way under Harry’s shirt.
As Malfoy noticed Harry, Ron and Hermione approaching, his eyes looked anxious, but his lips curved into a familiar smirk. “Ah, Potter, Weasley! It’ll be interesting to see if Gryffindor is allowed to play, won’t it?” Malfoy said haughtily. “If it’s a question of influence in the Ministry, you’ll definitely have no problems with your outstanding connections. My father tells me constantly how much he appreciates the work Arthur Weasley is doing for the whole Wizarding world, regulating all that threatening and improperly used Muggle stuff. Such a dangerous job, would lose my night’s sleep if I didn’t know your father is there protecting us all from the horrendous Muggle contraptions, Weasley,” Malfoy said as other Slytherins were shrieking and howling with laughter. “And as for Potter… My father says it’s a matter of time before the Ministry has you carted off to St. Mungo’s, apparently they’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic.”
“I’ve written a letter, okay? That should be enough to represent me,” Harry said, annoyed, hoping his friends would give up soon and drop the subject.
“No idea,” Ron said, shrugging. “But there must be something going on. You don’t make that kind of decisions lightly.”
“I’ve got no answer for that,” Draco said, fiddling with Harry’s locks. “But I’m happy that you came.”
“Oh, for Salazar’s sake, you two can’t be serious,” Zabini said, hitting his forehead with his palm dramatically.
Harry startled and turned around, trying desperately to see who had called him, but in vain. He was wrapped in a thick, threatening, evenly grey mist, and no matter how hard Harry tried to focus his sight, he couldn’t see anything else but oppressive, wavy greyness all around him.
chances to change,” Potter said. “I just don’t want to live in a society where it’s okay to kill as a punishment. I don’t want any more killing in the name of the War.”
Even though Harry didn’t have detention nor Quidditch practise anymore, friends, homework and DA kept him so busy it was hard to find time to meet Draco. And when Harry happened to have time, then Draco had his own Quidditch practise or some prefect stuff.
“I don’t even know what to say to that,” Harry said. He found it hard to believe Zabini, not only because he didn’t know the boy at all but also because all Zabini was saying sounded so surreal as if it was from a really, really odd movie.
“Of course you’re not,” Harry muttered, turning his gaze at Andromeda. “Did you know Sirius and Narcissa used to organize us some sort of playdates when we were still babies?”
“Tomorrow at the Quidditch pitch,” Harry said and grimaced, referring to the Slytherin versus Gryffindor match. “Could show you the place I was talking about after the match?”
“There”, Zabini said, sitting back down as Harry and Malfoy entwined their fingers together. “I’m not scared of seeing homosexuals expressing affection towards each other.”
“I can’t believe I agreed to all this,” Draco muttered as they arrived at the shore where a small, wooden rowing boat was waiting for them.
Draco looked at Harry, disbelieving. “You can’t be serious. He’s only overreacting, he always does that,” Draco said. “Besides, there’s no way I’m going to let go of you now that I’ve finally got you.”
Draco had known there was no way Harry would take part in his trial, but he had still felt his heart sinking when Harry’s letter had been opened and read out loud instead of Harry being there present as flesh and blood. Harry had written about Draco in a good light, telling how Draco had actually tried to help them and shown signs of regret when lowering his wand in the Astronomy Tower, but the tone in his letter had been so cold and business-like, as if he hardly knew Draco.
“You had an argument with the Sorting Hat?” Draco said incredulously. “I didn’t know it’s even possible.”
Ginny sighed. “I can’t say I’d like him or trust him, but the things Blaise mentioned about the pureblood culture… Let’s just say I can only imagine how Malfoy must be struggling.”
The expression on Harry’s face turned a bit uncomfortable. “It’s just, well, my parents had bought this for me before they died. This is the only thing I’ve left from them, apart from a photo album Hagrid gave me the first year and my father’s Cloak, of course,” Harry said and buried his face to Draco’s hair. “I know it’s a bit silly to carry around an old children’s book.”
As there weren’t that many Muggles nor wizards living up north in Europe, Harry and Draco had booked a room in an ordinary Muggle hotel that was packed with people from all over the world who were eager to try skiing, see the Northern Lights, go on husky rides, stroke reindeer, try ice-fishing and whatnot. It didn’t take long before Harry was also tempted to try all those things, and the first days passed surprisingly fast, coldness and darkness all forgotten. Draco, of course, appeared to be some sort of a professional as he had spent holidays in the Swiss Alps with his parents, both cross-country and downhill skiing, and he seemed to have the time of his life watching Harry fall over and over again on skis. The snow was so soft, so the falling didn’t usually hurt at all; it was just Harry’s pride that got a bit hurt.
of being able to do so, and when Harry pulled him into his arms whenever Draco was feeling anxious and broken. In Harry’s words when Harry told Draco how much he cared and loved, and how he kept telling Draco over and over again how he would want to listen to him when he was feeling like his world was falling apart. And in Harry’s way to show how much he wanted to be a permanent part of Draco’s life, wanting to get to know his friends and let Draco meet his, inviting Draco to family dinners to the Burrow, and talking about moving in together some day in future and adopting lots of cats or bunnies.
“Well, he didn’t say it right to their faces, obviously. He and Blaise kind of slithered away every time the Carrows asked them to torture someone.”
“It’s nothing to worry about. Just a lot of guests coming and going, is all,” Draco said, trying to make his voice sound light and carefree.
“So it’s all about you then, is that what you’re saying? You have a long habit of keeping big, dirty secrets from your friends? What do you think they’re going to like when they get to know you’ve been hiding something like this from them?” Draco knew he was now just asking for a punch on his face but it simply felt all too easy and familiar to try to irritate Potter.
“And if the three of you could concentrate on the lesson and discuss your private matters in your leisure time,” Professor Grubbly-Plank said, raising her voice and watching pointedly at Harry, Ron and Hermione.
Greg and Vince chuckled on both sides of Pansy while Pansy crossed her arms wrinkling her nose. Blaise huffed without turning his gaze from the doors. "As if Potter needed your help to make an utter fool of himself. How many was it again, Draco? Was it eight new hexes you dug from the library books and studied for weeks? And just for this evening, only for Potter.”
Malfoy strode quickly with his long legs, reaching Harry in no time. “Again, out of bed after the curfew, I don’t know what to do with you anymore,” Malfoy said, to Harry’s surprise, in a teasing tone instead of malevolent. “Care to tell me what you’re up to?”
It was not until Harry landed when he first realized how cold it actually was. It was hard to notice it up in the air when the thrilling sensation of freedom filled his mind completely, but when he was back on the ground, there was no denying the bitter autumn evenings had made their way to Scotland.
Draco was completely quiet and compliant as Harry led them out of the castle and towards the lake. Now, though, Draco being quiet and unresponsive didn’t make Harry as anxious as before as the warmth of Draco’s body reminded him that Draco was alive. No matter how thick walls Draco had around him, he was still there, and it must still be possible to reach out to him.
He had been practically freed of all charges only a few hours ago, thanks to all the witnesses and Harry’s letter. He only had to attend Hogwarts for the eight year as for some sort of punishment, and then he’d be free to do whatever he wanted. Well, obviously inside the limits of what the wizarding society would
“Exactly. That’s why we think there must be quite a lot we don’t know about him as you fell in love with him, and even Ginny seemes to be quite fond of him,” Hermione said.
“Don’t,” Draco said, cutting Harry short. “We weren’t exactly on good terms around my birthday and then you lost your godfather, for Salazar’s sake. Do you really think I’d expect you to remember to get me something for my birthday?”
“I’ll try my best,” Harry said. “Though I guess it’ll be he who’s going to have to take care of me and not the other way around,” he went on, muttering and making Draco snort of laughter.
