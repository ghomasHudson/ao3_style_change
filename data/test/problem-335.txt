The green eyes widened, "Tried?" Harry stared confusedly as Severus looked very curious at the wording.
“lunch should be almost done Julian so potions first” Severus chuckled as the boy pouted when he climbed into a chair, but did as told and drank the potions “good boy, drink some tea to get the taste out” he said as he went to check on the meal. The twins watched the wizard with interest as he served the meal and sat down to eat too.
After everything he didn’t deserve to be shown respect or kindness and he certainly didn’t deserve the sad apologetic looks in the kneazles’ big golden eyes and those false blue eyes as if they had a reason to need forgiveness …
The minister pretended not to see the moment of anger and hummed “a werewolf would be protective of children … hmmm … I’ll have to discuss this with him when he comes to see Sirius Black” Cornelius looked down at Julian with a smile “I’ll keep you informed on everything. There won’t be any point in coming since it’s pretty clear he’s innocent, but I’ll give you the date-”

With Brian's interference, Tanzanite found a safe opening and bolted forward carrying his human with him, though Julian quickly found out why he was warned about touching Tom when his occamy brought him too close, "Damn, it burns." He hissed as his hand brushed Tom's magically charged skin, but tried to ignore it and kneeled next to the terrified teen. "Tom! Please calm down! No one here wants to hurt you!" Julian raised an eyebrow as Tom seemed to search blindly for him as excitement flickered in the scared soul. "Do you recognize my voice, Tom? It's me, Julian. I know it's strange, but you're safe here and you can calm down." He yelled and after a few seconds Tom's magic settled down as Julian quickly caught Tom who nearly hit the floor in exhaustion.
“of course not, but the Malfoys and Blacks have been going to Hogwarts for generations plus Australia is so far away” Narcissa argued as she looked at the pamphlet in her husband’s hands.
"Yes. Dumbledore' s condition is very serious, but mainly just affected by motion, touch and magic. As long as Crookshanks doesn't jump on him, it'll be fine … where's the Bloody Baron?" Cache asked finally noticing that Ron's ghostly chaperone wasn't in the room.
“light did this you say?” Severus mused as he inspected the vial his apprentice gave him. in the vial was a clear potion that had the occasional flicker of vibrant colors dance around.
“now lets see, where should we start? How does it feel to cast a tracking charm?” he tapped the frog and said the incantation. To his surprise he felt a small bond with the object, but he still checked to be sure and sure enough there was a gray glow where he tapped “wicked … now to remove it” he whispered another incantation and jumped in shock as he felt something like a rubber band snapping him in the chest. With a quick check it was confirmed … there was no glow!
“Trocar, he said his family and this Ms. Figg were not expected to return for 10 or so days right?” asked Maria once the door to Harry’s room closed.
“alright” Severus said whispered back “Julian stay with the group this time. I need to show your Dad something” he said and Silvia and Sophia followed the two wizards.
Once the Leaky Cauldron was in sight the cloak was put away …
Harry took a slow sip of his drink to stall as he figured out what to say, "
Now Harry had to get back. After slipping the ipod into his pocket and making sure it was out of sight he entered the Dursleys’ home. Once he put the groceries away he finished his other chores without making a sound as his aunt was chatting on the phone with a fellow gossip hound.
“I see. That was only a week ago so it makes sense that he’d still be feeling the effects … you understand why we don’t take kindly to someone else making potions for Julian right?” Silvia stated bluntly getting a scolding look from her twin for her lack of tact.
No one has said anything beyond praising him for stopping the Dark Lord …
The goblin grinned sadistically as he looked at Minerva “we’ve been waiting for someone like you” he snarled. This is what they needed. Both Harry and Severus didn’t know exactly what was going on or were too young to be taken out of Dumbledore’s grip legally. Having a third person actually knowing Dumbledore’s involvement will solidify their entire case …
"Myrtle Warren." The ghost said cheerfully, but then seemed to drift deep into thought, "I'm not sure how I died. I was over by the sinks waiting for someone and it moved. Next think i saw was a big golden eye and felt a pain in my back. Then I was dead."
“well that was exciting” Dumbledore said jokingly and finished the announcements. It seemed peaceful until the owls came flying in with the Daily Prophet. Dumbledore nearly had a heart attack right there. On the front page was the news involving the contents of the muggle newspaper. Every last detail of Harry Potter’s life was splashed across the page from the abuse to the runaway message and it put him exactly where he didn’t want to be. In people’s suspicions “excuse me everyone. It seems I’ve been gravely misinformed on Harry Potter’s welfare. I will go attend to that and see how I can be of assistance” he quickly announced to the stunned onlookers who were staring at him not sure what to think anymore.
A little creepy, but if it meant Hedwig could fly freely then this the one time he’s thankful for the hero worship … only this once … of course if he returns with Poppy a any point he needed to disguise Hedwig so no one recognizes her, but that issue is covered. He’ll just make another set of his own disguise potion and change Hedwig’s coloring now that he tested his for a good amount of time.
Green eyes looked up at him pleadingly without glasses to obscure them “can I take Mickey with me?”
Dumbledore paced his office both seriously pissed and in a panic. He was pissed because he paid Molly good money to have Ginny seduce Potter, but the little wench ended up in the wrong house! The panic was because he realized he screwed up big time by telling everyone that Potter was sick! Anything else would’ve been better, right?
The little boy flinched at the potion master’s harsh tone. He touched his forehead wondering about the person who left the piece of soul in his head. A quick glance at the color wheel made him curious. With careful movements he tapped the gray section, which was the color not described and the little magnifying lens moved over the gray section …
“I heard an explosion. What happened Albus?” the potion master asked with the most convincing false worry ever encountered.
Harry shuddered “Draco could be right … I feel used”
Isaac rolled his eyes in amusement,"That sounds like everyone." A Knock at the front door caught his attention. "I'll get that." He said and left with Fran following him to help if it was more things to move into the house.
Survival … he could feel that there was much more to Cache’s story.
One year he had to put Christmas lights up all over the home and happened to notice the small circular window was broken in a way so that it couldn’t lock, but he never saw in the dark room. It was also easy to figure out where the access panel could be considering there was only one room on that side of the house next to the bathroom … the coat closet or his new cell as it would seem. He confirmed it by cleaning the closet a couple years ago and poking the ceiling there with a broom handle until something moved. It was something he kept in mind ever since in case it came in handy.
“only two bloody weeks! …” Draco took a second to wonder what that might have been like, but it was very hard “I find it hard to imagine since I was raised by my magical parents in wizarding world, but I wouldn’t be surprised if you were overwhelmed … so you were raised by muggles then” it wasn’t a question. Draco knew that it only made sense and it might explain why he was scarred. His father always said muggles could be cruel. A small part of Draco wanted to comment on scar removing salves, but it seemed impolite to bring that up now …
“sorry Severus. We went to Diagon Alley yesterday and … well we saw some old comrades. I don’t think they saw us, but it was unnerving to say the least” Lucius admitted.
Arthur's eyes narrowed, "Acting that way won't help your punishment go faster. If you keep that tone up I'll ask for it to be extended, understand?" He said sharply making Ron hang his head in silence, "Good, now I have to talk to you, but we're going to Gringotts-"

“my my that was quite entertaining” Dumbledore twitched in annoyance as he turned around to see an aristocratic man with long blonde hair smirking at him with Draco at his side also smirking.
“of course” Brian pulled out the chest of figurines all of which came to life and began moving near the boy or to each other “now what is .. this one?” Brian asked and pointed to the figure of a unicorn.
The potion master got up to see and nodded “yes, this is the reaction you have to see before you place it in the moonlight” Severus somehow knew the werewolf tried to take the his sandwich so he shot a hex over his shoulder and pretended not to hear the werewolf yelp leaving the potion master’s food safe “once the moon comes out we’ll see a unique reaction that stimulates the potion. Without the moonlight it wouldn’t detect the stronger spells in a person and if something went wrong, like too much moonlight, it could be toxic. It must stay under for exactly 30 minutes of full moon light. Stir once counterclockwise every hour until the moon is up”
Next moving his and Hedwig’s charms, but to what? It would have to be something that can be hidden on their bodies until they didn’t want it. If they were seen by the person who put them on them that will realize something is wrong especially if they don’t feel the tracker when he or she is looking right at Harry!
“sweety I’m a vampire. We rarely sleep so the bed is usually free” Trocar shrugged and stepped on Frank’s foot before he could make a perverted joke involving other uses for a bed.
“the goblins have a system of their own. They don’t cover things up or show mercy … and they’ve bed looking for that one person to shatter everything Dumbledore has been hiding behind. Give it to them and he is done” Severus stated firmly.
Suddenly a thought came to mind …the very first day at Hogwarts he saw Dumbledore lighting candles without a wand. Hermione said it’s not possible, but Dumbledore did it. It’s worth a shot at least. He sat down on the cot and heard Hedwig perch on the cot’s metal frame.
With a subtle twitch Severus nodded “yes, I would react the same. One botched batch of potions could be catastrophic especially if it goes unnoticed. All the more reason for you to take offense considering I’m not as knowledgeable as I thought I was, but if it helps Gringotts did approve of my skills as far as adoption potions go and they seem to be the only creatures aware of what the rest of the world is like … and secretly laughing at all of magical UK”
Frank barely noticed Trocar fussing over Harry as the goblin handed the figure, that looked like a nesting doll, over to the young wizard “how many could there be?”
XXXXXXXXXX
“yes, good thing they’re dead” Lucius smirked as he thought of what the muggles must’ve gone through. Out of the corner of his eye he spotted Draco coming down the stairs with Dobby floating the school trunk behind them “set it near the floo so you’re ready in the morning … Draco?” Draco just seemed to ignore his father as Dobby set the trunk near the stairs and Narcissa started giggling making Lucius raise an eyebrow “what?”
"You taste so good … your ass is hugging my finger." Harry said between long licks of Draco's hard weeping cock.
Severus sighed “unfortunately yes, which means it will get worse with each moon cycle for about a year until he dies. The UK doesn’t have a cure for it because it’s a potion that needs runes ”
“the headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore, paid Harry’s relatives to treat him horribly and received reports from a squib on his treatment … a rather bitter squib at that. Apparently many muggles tried to help, but they were fooled through magical means” he growled as he recalled his talk with Ms. Figg.
Hermione seemed a little stunned, but then huffed “maybe you shouldn’t laze around chatting then” she said a little less harsh compared to the usual tone and stalked away.
“not really, Severus was trying to calm my fears about everything so we were talking on the balcony” Harry commented as he patted the toasty kneazles making them purr happily.
The young wizard smiled as the kneazles purred … it seems they liked the names …
Trocar frowned “how did you get all the way here?”
Griphook handed Severus a letter “a letter from the Malfoys came for you Lord Prince” the goblin said and the reaction was priceless …
Draco's eyes widened, "Wait, is that moonlight?"
XXXXXXXXXX
Cache leaned back against the chest of the dark creature “I tried to tell my headmaster about my … home life, but he shot me down and said I had to return, that my aunt provided blood protection” Harry felt the vampire stiffen do to the bitterness in his voice “but I knew if I just returned after learning some magic I would be killed so I went to the only other professor I trusted, my potions professor, who hated me for some reason related to my father, but he did save me so I hoped he’d listen”
A set of students did manage to sneak around the edge of the Forbidden Forest to see the basilisk up close and the Minister noticed too late. The basilisk smelled the students, hissed furiously and lunged faster than the Extraction Unit could even attempt to secure the powerful creature ...
“What? That’s quite serious! Why weren’t they taken to- … oh, that’s right.” Poppy sighed as she recalled where Cache lived. The dark creatures would not have been allowed in to St. Mungo’s. “How’d it go?”
"What?" Hermione gaped in shock that Ron would say that out loud.
"I'm speaking"
“cute aren’t they?” Neville nearly leapt out of his skin as he spun around to meet a tall blonde blue eyed healer “sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you Neville”
That comment caught Severus completely off guard. Why would his presence be needed there? Sure the potion masters are allowed to sit in, but to have his presence arranged. Did he know the person adopting the child? That would explain why he would be wanted there, but who did he know who is adopting … no one and he knew no children being adopted. So suffice to say he was curious to see what was going on. After what seemed like a very long walk through twisting hallways they stood in front of a door he knew was the exam room …
The concerned mother frowned “he’s a little worse than when I floo called you last night”
The conversation went unheard for the loud cheering continued and it went on until finally Dumbledore called for silence “with that out of the way lets move onto the sorting!”
“Aunty Silvia, Aunty Sophia!” Julian smiled and was scooped up by the twins who held him between them.
“I’ve never seen kneazles like this” Tom noticed that the felines were skinny just like their human owner “would you like ladies like something to eat?”
“I’m speaking”
Brian sighed “Dumbledore wants the ‘Boy Who Lived’ under his thumb for some reason”
“unfortunately a soul scan isn’t possible right now” Brian sighed as he placed some cheese on the food “the goblins tried yesterday, but they can’t see through the bindings on his magic to do the test-”
"I'm speaking"
Harry paused to think and nodded “I have a brewing job at St. Mungo’s. the pay is very reasonable so I’ll manage … umm can I ask you to postpone telling Dumbledore until Tuesday?”
"An animagus form now … Severus, how is Sanguini? Is he in the same state as the others?" Harry asked making Isaac aware of the other vampires frozen in place just like his papa.
"Just Isabell. She's playing with your three other munchkins in the front yard. Fran is here too with her mother." Isaac said as he started taking the glass vials, flasks and beakers out of the box and lined the shelves.
“yes I guess I am” Cache twitched, his height might have been an a potion related issue … oops.
Dinner was pasta with meat sauce and a mix of veggies for himself and meat with a little bit of veg for his kneazles. He savored every bite. Eating was getting easier, but he still can’t eat a full meal without taking a few breaks. Neville may have helped him eat a little more during school, but it wasn’t until now that he has had the chance to eat full meals and get used to it. Sure he had access to food at Hogwarts, but he couldn’t get used to eating enough and stress from school, exploding potions, a mean professor and a homicidal Dark wizard trying to come back to life … none of that did any good for his withered appetite.
Big bedroom with a king sized bed and huge walk in closet…
“so what does this mean? That we have to find seven pieces of the Dark Lord before he … returns?” Severus asked finally coming out of his stunned daze. The second Harry told the full story and the goblin used the word ‘anchor’ he understood the gravity of the situation.
Severus Snape raised an eyebrow as an owl landed on his window sill “now what could this be about?” it was the summer so it couldn’t be school related. He took the message and took note of the Gringotts seal before opening it “I see … an adoption potion is needed”
Then his ipod and earbuds, which will be an issue since he was using Dudley’s extra charger. It wasn’t important now especially since there wasn’t any electricity in magical world, but Harry wondered if a few runes could fix that. He did have those books too …
Aster smirked “they have been able to do this spell for years and they don’t even get wands until they’re 13 like most students outside the UK. Some never do because wandless seems so natural like parseltongue is for the hundreds of snake speakers all over the world” she said absentmindedly, but Brian, Severus, Julian, Draco, Narcissa and Lucius knew she wanted to make that point fast. That fact may have been too much for the Hogwarts staff for they looked beyond stunned and seemed to wander off in a daze they heard Severus open the doors to the castle to show his new brides around.
“fine with me” Percy huffed fed up with his little brother’s behavior and just let go of Ron’s robes, which resulted in Ron tumbling to the floor.
“of course Neville. Hopefully it isn’t going to be that bad” Cache commented before wincing when Neville made a deadly mistake … he yawned.
“hopefully this will make an opening” Dumbledore said as he went to his own personal cabinet on the wall and pulled out a loyalty potion he made. Once there was an opening he will slip it to the boy and his adopted father.
Leaving and not returning …
Sleep was calling him so he went upstairs and slept in the guest room again …
Blaise huffed in amusement as the two Gryffindors left and went into the compartment dragging his trunk with him “so this is where you were Draco and I see why” he said as he calmly patted the now calmer kneazle on Draco’s lap “you always were a sucker for fluffy cute things” the dark skinned Slytherin raised an eyebrow when he noticed Neville smiled kindly even if it was strange to find him here with Draco.
’ he hissed in parseltongue.
“personally I don’t think they should’ve asked you. Merlin knows you do enough around here” Trocar huffed and shot Severus a look.
“so he’s a healer? He couldn’t be much older than me” said Draco who was a little shocked.
It took a second for Dumbledore to understand, but when he did he screamed. No one was around to hear it at that time, but it was still an epic meltdown …
Ragnuk hissed something in goblin speak and Ironclaw zipped out of the room “I’m sorry, but this soul scan, though not truly necessary, can’t be done because someone has sealed off a large chunk of little Julian’s magic meaning the runes can’t see passed the bindings. I told Ironclaw to inform your local Gringotts” he said seriously. The humans looked furious save for Julian who didn’t fully understand what that means “normally I would have this fixed immediately, but despite Julian’s recovery so far he isn’t strong enough for us to remove the bindings”
” Ms. Figg exclaimed happily. Harry gaped from under his cloak. Three weeks! They intended to lock him up for that long?! It’s a good bloody thing he knows how to get out!
“it’s fine” Draco shrugged as he covered the necklace with his collar “normally my father is the one they keep tabs on and the Death Eaters are only concerned when we try to go to far for too long. it would be strange if we didn’t move at all and this is a place where I might run into someone who knows about it”
“that will be changing from now on. I’m sure Percy wouldn’t let Ron lag around in the dungeons and neither would the Bloody Baron, but would you like one of us to walk you to the dorm?” Severus asked.
The shocked headmaster muttered a ‘see ya kid’ as he watched the kid take his mother’s hand and walk away. Not fair indeed, his school starts at five years old! He just figured Percy was having trouble with that particular spell. After all every kid had that one subject or spell that gives them trouble and may take more time or that that spell was done later at Hogwarts than his school … the later was sort of true. The boy hasn’t even started school yet!
“if we had this little sweet heart we’d be able to do anything too” the wins said in perfect sync as Silvia, who was sitting closer to the boy, reached over to tickle him. Julian giggled showing more life than he ever has … it was good to see him happy. They continued their meal in a peaceful silence.
While the Dursleys were away on a long trip this prisoner, who was believed to be their nephew Harry Potter though the diary only referred to him as ‘freak’, managed to escape by using exposed wires in the attic to blow off his cell door. The attic access panel was apparently over his cell. It was a good thing to because the investigators believe he would’ve died either from the record breaking heat waves this summer or starvation and dehydration. Not to mention any injuries he may have been given before his family left since it was clear they loved hurting him.
That is until the blackout shades suddenly opened revealing that the sun has just gone down …
Every other night Mickey would trot over to get Brian because Julian was having a bad dream, but this was different. Julian was rubbing his eyes in pain. The wolf bounded into the room across the hall and nuzzled Brian awake. Sensing something truly urgent Brian instantly bolted out of the bed and went to his son’s side.
Trocar sighed as he forced the whimpering werewolf down on the couch “Frank did something to his jaw last night. He’s in pain”
The goblins approached the bed ignoring the frantic wide eyes darting around for an escape, "This was a long time coming." Slashclaw said and nodded to Griphook.
century mindset and connected with the rest of the world then you’ll see a lot more happy tourists. Glad to meet you Tom” the headmaster waved over is shoulder at the stunned pub owner and continued walking down the road to look for a muggle hotel or a spot to sleep.
Remus watched Harry walk away knowing he was a strong young wizard who could handle himself, "I dread to think what else I've been wrong about?" He pondered sadly as a ministry owl landed in the coop downstairs with a letter addressed to him …
The apprentice raised a puzzled brow. It was a little strange that they both knew already, but shrugged it off and set the reports down, "The reports on the Nerve Tonic are very positive. You should be home by Yule-"
Aster scoffed “he ran away … well he had better come back with the full story” she muttered in irritation as she glared at the spot where the headmaster last stood. A little whimper from her little patient brought her full attention back to the wounded child “hush now sweetheart, you are safe. Go to sleep” she said softly as she pulled out a candle and lit it. The candle released a smell that quickly pulled the child into a deep painless, dreamless sleep. If this poor little child could drink a potion she would have had him do that instead, but he was in no condition to move or consume things on his own so the candle potion it is.
Lucius forced himself to focus “what do we owe you?” the man was willing to pay anything at that point.
“hey guys what’s up?” Harry asked as he gave Hedwig a couple treats. She had a long flight to get to Neville so she deserved it.
“oh, that’s right … I’m sorry” Minerva apologized sheepishly. It was easy to forget that a few of Voldemort’s followers were still active even so long after the war. If any of them tried to seek Severus out for help and noticed how he was teaching with Voldemort’s sworn enemy they would immediately realize that he was a spy. That would be dangerous for both Severus and the person he’s marrying.
A sad smile came to Harry's lips, "It wasn't an easy rime. Sunlight was terrible for vampires even half vampires. The full moon caused so much pain to werewolves. It's a whole mess your parents are very happy that you never have to go through."
“Lucius/Dad!” Narcissa and Draco went over to him, but he paid them no mind as he got up to quickly write a letter …
In his mind there was only one solution … blame someone else and pretend to clean up their mess. It will take a little time to set someone up, but it could work. He can take all the donation money and say someone else informed him of Potter’s condition and he gave all the donation money to that person. No trace of Potter or the money will be found and that person will be blamed for kidnapping, abuse and theft. That’s when he, the great Dumbledore, comes in and declares a rescue party be formed to find Potter. No consequences for him, but he’ll get all the money, look like a hero and eventually, with great care, he can have Potter back under his thumb again. It just so happens he had the perfect person to blame. …
The Weasley Lord saw that both of them were serious and sighed, "Very well ..." He opened the door and lead them in.
“yes, so we have some time to find them, but despite what they did Harry hasn’t given much information on where they live. He only talked about the inside of the house” said Trocar.
Poor Tom started tossing and turning in the middle of the night. No matter what he did he couldn't fall asleep. There was this strange feeling of something that he forgot and it must've been about that last memory. He tried not thinking about it, but everytime he closed his eyes he saw that foggy memory flash across his mind. It was as if something was begging to be remembered.
Draco barely noticed the soft sheets of the bed under him until he felt that hot body on top of him, "Harry! Ahh! If you do-ahh!" Draco moaned hotly and his back arched off the bed as a hot month descended on a nipple. "Ahhhh! Harry I'm-Ahhh!" With gentle twist of one nipple, a nibble of the other and a buck of those hips against each other all at once Draco came hard. "Oh Merlin! … Harry?"
“ok” Draco said without really realizing it since he was too focused on Julian’s lips.
“please call me Harry, Master Griphook … wait, what do you mean vaults? I was told I had only one. And what do you mean by ‘took me so long’? I didn’t even know I was being contacted” said the very confused wizard as he sat in the seat across from the master goblin.
Sad … the word that popped up in the glass was ‘sad’, but that was confusing. Julian tapped the yellow he saw in the unusual soul piece even though that color was explained already. The lens moved again …
Quietly he shut the door to his cell and preformed the light spell again. Once everything was illuminated he frantically put the bottomless bag on the bed. It was taking all he had not to start panicking. His hands trembled as he shuffled through the numerous books he had.
“control of what exactly?” Severus asked. It had only been one day since the adoption closed and Brian contacted him through Gringotts saying there was a simple change in Julian. Despite the fact the letter said everything was fine and that a professional was contacted Severus made a point of leaving the second the potion he had brewing was done. He somehow managed to get there before Stephen …
Severus breathed a sigh of relief as he felt his body stop fighting and he was released from the werewolves’ grasps “well that’s one method we could use to give your professor the potions”
The red eyed teenage boy smirked flashing his fangs, "Mom told us to help you and Uncle Harry and make sure you don't push it."
“I will be happy to spread the word” Lockhart exclaimed and flounced away not thinking for one moment that he was tricked into getting people to take the very potion that will remove his own.
Frank glanced at Harry as he walked out of Gringotts and saw him talking with some people. The two exotic kneazles could be seen watching the scene from the roof of a shop so with Harry in safe hands … or paws … the werewolf made up his mind. Frank followed Remus away from the wizarding bank and stayed back enough to not be noticed or smelled as they went down the cobblestone streets.
“all three apartments open, 423, 410 and 405, have silencing charms for privacy, separate heating and cooling charms run by runes, separate floo systems and alert wards to prevent someone other than you from getting in, but they’ll react if you need help too” Sanguini pointed up as they went up to the third floor “the fourth floor is unique because it has large skylights and balconies. They also have large bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and living and dining rooms. Each are about the same size and cost 150 galleons a month with the first payment being after 4 weeks and are for one person, but they don’t have potion labs”
Brian looked down at Harry “want to take it now Harry?”
The young wizard raised an eyebrow “you mean Harry Potter?”
“Uncle Sev!” the little boy yelled as he waved and was pulled up into the man’s arms.
“I don’t know about that … maybe we need to check after some time passes. Until I’m sure I won’t make another batch” Harry said as he put his shirt back on. Maybe it was stubbornness, but he wanted to give this potion a chance. With his mind preoccupied with what happened with the potion at the moment a certain new scroll laid on the bookcase completely forgotten …
Brian chuckled as he finished his ice cream cone “I think I know … Julian this is the one and only time I want you to do this, ok?” Julian nodded well aware of the seriousness in his Daddy’s tone “put your hand through the wards and try to pet the Occamy” he said as tossed their trash away in a nearby bin.
“TROCAR!” Frank yelled as he went through the door and ran over to the vampire. “Are you alright? Sanguine already flooed to Gringotts to get blood. How much do you need?”
Minerva looked up from her desk when she saw that Cache and Hermione were back, "I got an owl from the Minister explaining that you agreed to testify. If you'd like Cache can escort you over the weekend."
“we can’t arrest him” Remus growled wanting any excuse to hit Dumbledore who transfigured himself, but neglected to change his scent with a special cloak until after Moody and Remus flooed into the same bar as him just in time to spot his new look.
Trocar introduced Armel, Maria and Sanguini to Neville and they began chatting.
“that’s perfect” Harry snickered and emptied all the food he wanted out of the frig and pantry and put it in his bottomless bag. Finally he looked at his three pets who each looked amused at his actions “what? I had a lot to vent” he shrugged. He knew neither the Dursleys or Ms. Figg will get out of this unscathed. By the time they get back all of the wizarding world will be after them in order to find the ‘Boy Who Lived’.
Cache looked up from the desk where he was gathering some papers and putting them into a bottomless bag, "Yes? What's wrong?"
Maybe Harry did get away …
Narcissa sighed as Severus clearly refused to say more on the subject and took the sleepy child from her husband’s arms so he could try this potion. They watched silently as Lucius rolled up his left sleeve and poured the potion over the mark. He flinched as he felt a slight burning sensation, but it went away quickly clearly already doing its job. The dark mark first started to blur at the edges and slowly dissolved away.
“then you have no need of me. Go back to your pampered life. Just have your summer assignments completed. Not that I expect much from you for potions. You sadly take after your
” Harry raised an eyebrow as he heard Petunia through the open above the patch of weeds he was now working on. She was still talking on the phone with someone. Fun? What will be fun? Of course it won’t involve him. In fact, he had a sick feeling that he will be locked up.
Frank groaned “we’ve been through this. Hogsmeade set up a law banning dark creatures not long ago and there are wards to enforce it. We can’t follow him there … besides he needs privacy to snog the Malfoy-oof!”
“Moody … maybe we should start farther back … lets return to the UK, but lets not tell Albus. School just started so he’d be too busy” Remus said strangely compelled to return and start searching there without telling Dumbledore. Moody believed that it was a wise idea and agreed …
XXXXXXXXXX
Trocar appeared next to the couch “just make dinner Harry” the vampire said and shot Severus an annoyed look “our guest shouldn’t get a choice after that stunt” he huffed still not happy that Harry was so freaked out.
Bloodbarrel frowned at the sight of the blood “10 seconds left little human” he noticed the tall potion master start pulling out potions ready to help the healer take care of the boy, which was good. Julian would be sore for a while if he didn’t have such caring guardians. Actually he was surprised Brian managed to keep himself from jumping into the circle to get his son … although the pale look on the headmaster’s face meant he wouldn’t stop himself for long.
Poppy rolled her eyes “I’ll see you Severus” her face left the fire and he potion master pulled his head out. From what he gathered today Cache was badly abused and somehow he got away.
Cache frowned as he saw several gloomy students in the hallways, "This isn't right." He said, hating that so many kids were hurt and scared because of these recent happenings.
Hermione scowled as she walked into the potion class and saw Cache standing in the front with the professor “this jerk is starting to bug me” she grumbled quietly as she sat down next to Ron.
Stephen frowned glanced at the potion master as if asking permission before he explained. Severus wasn’t an idiot. He knew where this was going and nodded knowing Julian would learn this eventually “ok … Julian you made a good point. Lets first look at colors then the aura shape. Red was temper. Severus is easily angered by certain things and he is very strict, but this is where the shape comes in. You said his aura doesn’t fly around, but you do mean its more like a glow?” Julian nodded as he glanced at Severus almost nervously as the man would be mad at him “that’s good. The tight aura you see, Julian, is a sign that he has very good control. Severus here won’t go flying off the handle no matter how mad he gets. Your Daddy isn’t so controlled, but he’s very laid back. Now what about me?”
“impossible? Who here has had a case of accidental magic?” several of the students raised their hands in response to Cache’s question “isn’t accidental magic, magic without the use of a wand? We’ve all used
As she stood with the new first years, who were momentarily forgotten in favor of the gossip, Ginny pouted at the sad announcement. She had hoped to meet her brothers’ friend. Though Ron claimed to be Harry’s best friend he seemed to know very little as far as actual facts about the ‘Boy Who Lived’ as a person. Fred and George had much more to say and only ever said nice things about Harry, but this sickness sounded really serious.
“yeah … no problem, I don’t want to cause trouble. Anyway my first check came in so I can do some shopping” Cache said as he walked with the vampire.
“mandrake is in so lets start” Harry muttered to himself s he dumped the last of the Mandrake root on a tray and put it in the oven. Mixing the first three things as instructed turned the liquid white and four clockwise turns created a gray steam “all good so far” he pulled out the now crispy mandrake root and slid it in as the potion bubbled.
Why hide that he was gone?
“how can I help you?” Harry spun around and came face to face with a very pale handsome man with dark hair wearing old styled robes and a cape “I am Sanguini, the owner of this establishment” The most notable features were the slightly pointy canines and red eyes … according to the book on magical creatures he read this man was a vampire …
“hey Draco!” Julian smiled.
Harry reached up intending to grab the jar of beetle eyes, but he didn’t get to the jar. Just before he could grab hold of his target his baggy sleeve got snagged on a sharp edge on the shelf pulling his sleeve all the way down revealing his scarred arm.
Severus smiled “I’m sure we’ll be able to find a place all to ourselves” he said knowing a good deal of the castle isn’t used even with all the students here so he won’t have to kick out Slughorn to take his professor’s quarters back, which will only go against their goal of fixing the education system. After all removing a teacher will only hurt the students further and make this more difficult so it’s off to find a honeymoon suite all for themselves. Just as they were about to turn the corner into a hall filled with classrooms that were never used they heard a jingle of a bell and felt a breeze “that’s strange. The classrooms here should all be shut- …this is not what was here before”
Draco Malfoy was definitely mad … Harry did try to talk to the blonde Slytherin and explain that he didn’t know about the House cup, but Ron made a harsh comment and ruined everything.
And what person makes the defenses around the stone so weak that three kids could get in without alerting anyone?!
"Aww you're a good little one!" Narcissa cooed as she rocked the little half vampire licking a bloody cut on her arm.
"Yes." Severus said as he looked at the door that Trocar left through to leave Harry's apartment, "I don't know what you stumbled on, but we should study it further." Severus said, deeply intrigued by very real tears that were brimming the vampire's eyes. There wasn't a lot or even enough to make a tear fall, but it was much more than the odd shimmer that happens when vampires are normally sad.
As the healer tucked in Dumbledore she huffed, "it was already set higher because the brewer was testing on himself and other willing people and all having success. You can't make a request until you check for side effects-"
The Malfoy family head whirled around nearly tripping on his desk with how fast he was moving “Severus? What’s going on? Is something wrong?” he asked his friend who was leaning on the door frame and looked like he ran full speed across six Quidditch fields to get here.
Julian looked around nervously, but saw Draco and Mickey without a partner and went over carrying his cushion “can we be partners?”
Minerva rolled her eyes “that fool … I heard about him losing to your apprentice. You know I’m starting to think he doesn’t actually know what he’s doing”
Severus surprised his friend further by smiling kindly “thank you Narcissa. These clothes are better suited for Australia and they seem to suit me better than solid black” he said as he casually sat on the floor with Draco who looked frail despite being cured five months ago, but smiled none the less.
“really?” the little boy’s eyes widened with curiosity.
Cache nodded, "I'll keep that in mind." He said before looking at Remus, "I can't say I blame you for anything especially knowing that Dumbledore was involved. That bastard has a talent for twisting everything his way. At least, he did." Cache said with a smirk getting amused chuckles, "As for us and whatever relationship we may have will have to wait to be discussed when things calm down."
(I’m thinking)
“I didn’t think you were lacking a sex life. Mothers deserve some fun too you know” Cache said with a smirk proving that training as a healer has removed any filters in his mouth. Trocar gaped not expecting Harry to say that and Frank howled in laughter with the others. Even Neville snickered slightly. The Longbottom heir was taken back to the complex with Harry and his disguise was removed before being shown to Trocar’s apartment.
“I’m not even going to ask how you two got through a locked door” Cache chuckled as the clearly confused man and woman kept muttering as if they had no clue that their figures were stroking the kneazles’ fur. Lyra hopped off the chair next to the man’s bed and Libra jumped off the chair next to the woman’s, but the woman started crying at the loss of the fur.
Before the portraits could see them Severus cast a ‘not notice me’ spell “yes actually” he answered casually.
XXXXXXXXXX
Brian chuckled at his friends’ stunned expressions “I don’t think he means he knows me personally”
Neville smiled as he spotted Cache holding a twig of mistletoe outside the Great Hall “hey Cache, why do you have mistletoe with you?”
Severus felt his fist clench. Those people are horrid! “that won’t be happening ever again … Lets start working on something different today”
“what did that greasy git do?” snarled Ron.
"Doesn't that prove it?! If Dumbledore gave me money then he must've potioned me like the others the Daily Prophet reported!" Hermione argued before glaring at Cache, "and why would Poppy be so persistent if she isn't trying tell me about a potion?" She said with a smiled thinking she argued her case, but her smile faded at the look on Cache's.
Of course the ministry is completely untrustworthy so the young wizard was smart for not going there. The vampire highly doubted that they would be helpful despite the fact that underage magic being overlooked would be their fault. Hell, he wouldn’t put it passed them to use the theft as an excuse to put Cache away in Azkaban or have him disappear just to hide their bumbling. Going to the press also won’t help because the ministry has spies everywhere and Dumbledore … he already made his opinion clear there
“perfectly, they gave him away without a fight and I just barely avoided hexing them into the next century … he’s my son now and the adoption potion will be ready soon. Gringotts is making the request” said Brian as he sat in the chair to Harry’s bed and gently touched the boy’s hair as he whimpered in his sleep. Harry relaxed into the touch “what color are your eyes little one? I think green”
that they found me and secretly got me to my godfather."
"Considering what was going on … If Severus comes out of this pregnant again and I have to tell him he can't brew for another two years or so …" Harry trailed off, but the potential danger was clear.
Frank deadpanned “well you aren’t completely wrong. Sanguine wants a bodily fluid, but it’s the white kind not the red kind”
While everyone was enjoying themselves Frank slipped out the door with a piece of cake. The werewolf walked down the stairs. He grabbed a loaf of bread from the kitchen and went to a door in the back near the owlery. Another set of stairs was revealed when the door was opened. Frank continued down into the surprising cozy lower levels with the cell rooms. The cell rooms didn’t look any different from hotel rooms. There were no bars for door just regular wooden doors that are reinforced with powerful wards that keeps the door closed during the full moon. One painting on the wall in the hallway was of a Mockingbird …
“awww it’s perfect Julian. How did you pick your middle name?” Aster asked as she took a seat at the table near Julian, but not too close since the little boy still seemed shy around her.
“yeah … I should be locked in that cell now and would be if I didn’t find a knack for wandless magic … it’s been over a week I think I’d be pretty weak, but that isn’t the worst … no, not by a long shot … the ministry never came to investigate so I couldn’t go there for help, the squib I mentioned was talking about reporting to a wizard and keeping tabs on me as well as abusing two kneazles” Trocar glanced at the two kneazles sliding across the floor on their dog beds “once they left I escaped. I desperately devoured book after book to learn everything I could, to find a way to escape and take care of myself. I found away around the many problems … those four vials on the table, the gold, blue, red and white are what made it possible for me to leave without being recognized”
“moonstone huh … potion masters usually covet those” Trocar said and his red eyes spotted a scar peeking out from under Harry’s sleeve “Harry … I know there isn’t any point in saying this, but you know there are means of removing scars, right?”
“no no no. My apologies, I didn’t mean to imply that. You see I have family in Australia and they keep me up to date on the events including various school events” Cornelius said as he gestured for them all to have a seat.
It didn’t escape Severus’s notice that Trocar didn’t make anything for him to eat, but then that may have been why Cache brought more food for lunch so he just ate the rest of that. A glance at his apprentice revealed an apologetic smile and he knew the blonde predicted this. Severus wasn’t sure why the vampire was acting like this, but he wasn’t going to pay it any mind.
“actually it’s only necessary to find the six horcruxes and destroy them before Voldemort gets a real body. Then the main soul piece will disappear on its own however YOU do nothing” Griphook snapped as he gathered all the figure’s upper halves and arrange the parts on his desk so the proper upper half of each figure was set next to its proper lower half and the small sobbing figure was set at the end of the line “this is not a task a human, especially ones inexperienced with soul magic, should have any involvement in. The goblins here at Gringotts will handle the procedure. If you wish to help you can give us insight on the Dark Lord’s activities. Since you, Lord Prince, were once a Death Eater you may know about certain objects that the Dark Lord took a special interest in or gave to people for protection. Those items may be horcruxes. Does anything like that sound familiar?” the goblin asked as he scribbled a note down for the request of a ritual and a potion and let the note fly off.
Suddenly the wizard froze in mid step as a terrible chill washed over him. It had nothing to do with the warm breeze … no … this was something else entirely. There was something … someone, pulling him. A weak tendril of magic tugged at his own magic … crying for help.
You know Brian always wanted a child of his own and it feels right now, with Harry …
“He told you?” Remus blinked in shock at what he heard.
XXXXXXXXXX
Aster looked up from the bedridden little boy when she saw him enter the room “how’d it go?”
The sound of the bones breaking so they can be healed properly made the healer sigh in relief. Soon all his bones will be healed and he will be much better.
“He was a professor … he wouldn’t do this.” Hermione said, not ready to consider the possibility that not all authority figures were as amazing as they were portrayed. She even still believed in Dumbledore, despite what the newspaper revealing information that completely contradicted.
It was the diamonds! They were reflecting sunlight from the open shelf over the kitchen counter and onto the potion. Potions were brewed in artificial light except for moonlight and diamonds are for soaking so he never thought this could happen. With a little wandless magic the diamonds were turned making a strip of rainbow light to flicker away from the potion. The bubbling stopped leaving a clear water like potion with slight wisps of color in it as if the light was trapped in there …
“that was delicious. Thanks for treating” Cache said with his lip twitching in amusement as he noticed that in the split second it took for him to put the kneazles’ empty bowls away Draco had spelled any of the sticky red mess clean. There was no evidence of the Malfoy heir sucking down an entire jar of Bat Blood Soup … and despite the earlier offer Cache didn’t even get to try it … not that he minded since Draco did stubbornly insist on paying for everything.
“fine … this is where things get irritating though” he grumbled and made a point of finishing his meal slower than necessary …
“nice music” Frank Longbottom muttered as Cache tucked him “my son” he said a little more clearly than before as his eyes locked on Neville. A blush crept to Neville’s as he sat down on the chair between his parents. His parents seemed a little more stable than they usually would. It was nice …
“some times a point needs to be made using very blunt means … why did you two ride Tanzanite here instead of the train and where’s Sasha?” Narcissa asked curiously as they lead the group into the castle.
“Remmy …” Sirius muttered weakly not realizing he interrupted the minister as he spotted the werewolf hiding sheepishly in the corner of the room.
Finally the clothes were packed into the suitcase and placed with the owl cage and the duffle. All were shrunk and put into his bottomless bag. Lastly he put his trunk in the cupboard and locked it up. He fell asleep on the guest bed one last time after meditating a few minutes to get his mental defenses going.
Neville looked into the blue eyes that he knew were actually green and smiled in pure relief “you are safe … what’s going on?”
Severus looked up from his tea slightly startled by the admission “he’s been watching out for you” he said in an even tone. This wasn’t something he expected.
It will be difficult to get him to talk about what is going on, but for now he’ll focus on teaching the boy potions …
As he set up the cauldron he wondered who the child was and what situation brought about the adoption “maybe I should meet the new parents this time” he wasn’t sure though. Gringotts did excellent background checks so it was guarantee that the child was going to a good home. With that in mind flicked the burner on and started the potion …
The pond became crystal clear and much deeper …
He sighed somberly, never letting the tiny hand go as he knelt down “he is afraid of the dark, small spaces, cats, dogs and spiders … all for good reasons. His aunt dumped a bucket of spiders on him one time before locking him in the cupboard. He was chased up a tree by a nasty dog. That squib you mention used him to round up her violent cats. As far as his punishments go it always shed blood and broke bones mixed with varying degrees of starvation. He never had a proper bath or have been without pain or even left the house since he went into their care. I saw a flash of when he was dropped off at the Dursleys. A woman was saying that she didn’t like leaving Harry with them, but a wizard, I assume Dumbledore, convinced her otherwise … he saw his parents die by the killing curse and he knows nothing of magic or really his own name, which he thinks is ‘freak’ … you should move him before he wakes up”
XXXXXXXXXX
(how did I not hear them?) Harry shock off the thoughts and kneeled next to the tub “I drew you both a bath” they looked at him curiously, but eventually inched towards the bath “would you like some help?” the wizard asked the larger kneazle with the limp. The first response was a growl forcing Harry to back up, but the feline seemed to relent after seeing the wizard help the other one in so Harry gently picked it up and lowered it in the warm water.
So Harry got his wand and did as instructed …
"There's no bloody way that's possible! Bill! Dad hurt Scabbers!" Ron yelled at his brother who he saw coming down the hall towards them.
Lucius felt his body sag slightly out of pure relief “you were a spy”
"Yes, my apologies. Vampires are not normally seen in a good light so I admit that this is different for me." Minerva commented feeling a little more at ease with the knowledge that Cache didn't seem worried at all. In fact, she was curious on how insightful the boy was. Was he insightful enough to hide another life along with surviving with dark creatures? "I know how much you trust the creatures you live with, Cache. You lived through a hard life according to your words from last night so I should, at least, trust the ones you say saved you … may I ask how long you've lived with Trocar? It was definitely long enough to learn to trust him." She said finding it interesting that someone so young would choose the place you did unless they had no place to go and needed to hide. More importantly she wanted to know if Cache moved in around the same time as Harry Potter's disappearance.
Cornelius looked through the documents and nodded in satisfaction “this proves it, but this means someone took away your safety, which lead to this and it has to do with this letter from Hogwarts … actually now that you’re here Daggerfang, may I ask if I can see the Potter parents wills? Perhaps the magical guardian they assigned is responsible”
” Trocar asked worriedly through the door.
"I'm also proof that you're protective of kids. Of course, I'm not a child anymore …" Frank said as he walked up to the vampire, "and while you still treat me like a kid who needs mothering occasionally you haven't looked at me like a kid in years." Frank smiled making Trocar look away clearly a little flustered. "Now may be the time we've been waiting for … I'm not going away again no matter how hard you try to push me away."
In a daze he went over and opened the door revealing shelves upon shelves of neatly stored potions and ingredients.
“I thought Uncle Severus said I wouldn’t get one” the young confused boy panted as his Dad looked at the letter. Brian’s eyes widened when he saw the letter was addressed to ‘Harry James Potter’ …
Cache frowned “Trocar … if you don’t mind my asking how were you turned?”
XXXXXXXXXX
Harry’s mouth dropped, a vampire wants to teach him! “I would like that … why me though?”
“yes” said Cache who was trying really hard to stay calm as he sat down on the low table. Why did he have to run into yet another person he knew?!
They continued moving into the house, which was connected to an equally large manor by an smaller building between the two manors. The smaller building was actually a large workshop and potion lab that will be shared with the person in the other manor, Severus Snape. It was perfect for the freelance potion masters to research and since it was not far from Knockturn Alley they had access to everything they'd need even babysitters.
Cache chuckled as he grabbed Neville's shoulder, "Slow down, Nev. I need to use my ring to get in the back room." He said as they, at a far more careful pace, moved passed the healers currently brewing. "I need drop off some Skele-gro so you go on in." He said as he tapped the handle with his St. Mungo's ring.
“you did?” Julian looked up shyly.
“I understand, but now that I know about this dorm I will be visiting much more often” Sanguini vowed before claiming Severus’s lips again and vanishing in a blur as he raced back to the apartment complex knowing that if he lingered one more moment he would’ve taken Severus right then and there.
“deal” Severus said in amusement. The fact that Lucius never met the Dursleys and wouldn’t make any connections was the only reason the professor agreed. If there was even the smallest chance Harry would be revealed before he wanted it then Severus would’ve refused no matter how trustworthy he knew the Malfoy was.
Remus watched the healer walk across the lawn until she reached the sidewalk and apparated away, “I don’t need to worry about giving Sirius a potion for a while … I’ll start breakfast soon.” He mumbled tiredly as he drank the pain killing potion and applied the ointment taking the healer’s words to heart.
“Cache … how would you like to learn under me? I could find someone to train you in potions too if you want” Poppy asked, this boy was a natural healer. You don’t let a chance like this slip through your fingers!
Harry watched as Sanguini pulled out a necklace that a simple green stone hanging from a silver chain. The vampire placed the necklace around the tense potion master’s neck an fastened it and with care pulled the black locks away from the chain while letting his fingertips caress the soft skin earning a shiver “ummmm … I’m going to step out for a minute” Harry said feeling like he was intruding on an intimate moment.
The conclusion he reached prompted him to take the book and head for the floo. He barely heard Narcissa call after him as green flames enveloped him taking him away. Without fully realizing it, he appeared in the floo in Dumbledore's office, but the old fool didn't seem there so he didn't care about his intrusive action. Lucius stormed out of the office and through the halls. After startling a few students who didn't expect him to quickly stride passed them, he found Severus' honeymoon suite.
A trick …The boy couldn’t help but think this was a trick as he cautiously uncurled from his defensive position to look around. A gasp escaped the child’s lips as he spotted the fluffy wolf toy next to him. Harry’s tiny hands held the soft toy close to him as if he thought it would disappear. With he soft toy comforting him he risked looking around he room.
After taking the potion nothing obvious happened and everyone went on with their own things to see if what it did was more subtle. Draco went around the apartment to monitor the volunteers and Harry started writing the notes. As Harry was cleaning up for the next batch a frantic Draco ran back into his room.
Cache leaned over and whispered “be honest, do I look that bad?” he said quietly as the entire hall erupted with whispers and chatter … Severus snorted in amusement, but didn’t respond …
On the inside Harry was kicking himself for not thinking. Harry hasn’t seen Neville until this moment and he let his guard down. His heart was racing as he considered what to do. Should he tell Neville everything? The Longbottom’s mother was his godmother so he had a right to know, right? Not to mention Harry did just slip up. However, it would put the one human who tried to help him during school into danger. He didn’t know what to do …
“really, you’re actually the same age as us. When did you become a potion master?” Sophia asked.
Cache shrugged “sure” he said as he flicked his wand letting Lockhart hit the floor when the spell was canceled.
“Sanguini was very wealthy when he was turned so he started making several safe and heavily warded places for vampires and werewolves. Maria and myself chipped in too and we all came together to create networks. The rent was low so it was affordable for everyone could pay if they wanted to stay. For those who couldn’t pay with money they paid with skills or knowledge. Werewolves could use magic so they’re asked to charm various things and so on. When people, light and dark witches and wizards, began killing vampires pairing up with a werewolf for safety also became an exchange for shelter. We even found each safer jobs even if it was usually part time. I was the one who found Frank his first job …” Trocar said cheerfully, but then trailed off as he looked Frank in the eyes before quickly looking away. Frank, however, didn’t stop watching the vampire. Both Malfoys could see there was more to these two creatures’ past than a simple friendship “I found the main rune sequence. Could I have your staff Lucius?” he said as he felt the magic from the rune under his fingertips.
“I’ll take Veritaserum! Anything you want just please let me see Harry” Sirius exclaimed frantically practically sobbing at the chance being given to him, which startled everyone who thought the man was a hardened killer.
Finally it was clear what Gloria was …
(a book given to them by the Dark Lord) Severus mused. Could it be a horcrux? He pondered the notion as he flooed to Hogwarts. If that was the case then he had to stop at Brian’s to get Julian’s orb tomorrow before visiting again …
With a full stomach Harry started the process for making a set of dreamless sleep potions. After that dream from last night he wanted to be ready. He will need his sleep if he’s going to keep it together through the next couple weeks. With that potion going he settled down to continue reading the Transfiguration book going over Animagus …
"Why's that?" Lucius asked seriously.
Calming potions are also on Harry’s ‘to do’ list since he doesn’t expect Severus to take this quietly. Speaking of the potion master it seems Sinon left without waiting for an answer. Of course there probably was no need since he’d see Severus the day after tomorrow, but he’ll send ‘Ami’ with a thank you tomorrow anyway.
Vernon chuckled “no worries, we have everything worked out. Oh, let me help with your luggage” the big portly muggle lifted the luggage with a grunt and carried it in the squib’s home. Once Ms. Figg had her things they continued to their own home in the disappearing sunlight. When they got there they saw a girl with long blonde hair in a white dress that had a pink bow. She was going around barefoot.
I'm thinking)
Fred and George also didn’t like they didn’t see Ginny follow the other first year Slytherins. The fact that Ron wasn’t seen after the meal made them nervous. They searched their robes and pulled out a parchment “I solemnly swear I’m up to no good” they both whispered …
"Well no potions for you for a long while." Harry said.
XXXXXXXXXX
Either way he was way too tired to think anymore. He was going to have a difficult summer as it is. The questionable loyalties of the people who claimed to be his friends will have to wait. The Dursleys were the biggest issue right now…
Severus gave a disappointed sigh “and you can’t break the magical contract without a consequence, right?”
“Trocar made me promise to remember meals since I’ve been getting distracted” Cache commented as he set up a kettle for some tea. A strange sound from the active cauldron made him go and check “it’s the clouding phase right?” he asked as he saw the gray solution developed storm cloud like bubbles in the center.
“I have a few matters to discuss with you” Griphook commented as he shut the door behind Severus and took a seat at his desk “you are in luck. We found a soul fragment in on of our vaults. Of course I can’t reveal which vault or who owns it or what the soul is attached to, but if you return with the soul orb we can retrieve it for you”
Frank nodded “that should be fun, our wolf forms could use some chew toys for a change … there is one thing don’t understand”
The child’s green eyes nearly popped out of his head as the large, 25 foot long or so, reptile strode onto the shore ‘
“yes I left Cache in charge“ Severus said as he calmly pulled out his potion while sneaking his wand into his other hand without Minerva seeing. This was about to get very dangerous …
Harry signed the papers for he accounts and used his magic to lock it since magic is unique to each wizard. He received the key for vault number 777 that was under the name ‘Cache Devant Vous’ and set it up so that 499 galleons, 16 sickles and 28 knuts is transferred to there from Harry Potter’s trust every week along with everything he gains access to as he grows older … and Cache can do what he wanted with his money, even get a home or job.
The potion master said nothing for a while and just contemplated how incredibly lucky it was that Julian was still in this world “who was his guardian?”
So far using a wand for this task wasn’t working so trying without it might be the trick. After reapplying the charm Harry set his wand on the cushion next to him and placed his right hand over the frog. He said the removing incantation and carefully tugged … he could feel his magic gently pulling the charm upwards instead of tossing it away!
Each person there were colleagues at Legerdemain School of Sorcery. Aster is obviously the healer who also teaches the Emergency Healing class and sex ed. Brian is the headmaster. Stephen is teaching Mind & Magic, which teaches kids about feeling the magic around them, connect with nature, create mental defenses and reach their spirit animals. He also teaches advanced classes in wandless magic and special classes for seers or children with unique senses to help them control their power.
“familiar means magical animal friend right?” Harry asked cutely as he licked a drip of cheese off his lip.
A frown threatened to appear on Severus’s lips, this was already sounding bad “what happened at school?” Severus asked getting a sick feeling that he wasn’t going to like the answer.
“that’s right … are your eyes any better? They look bloodshot” Severus frowned in concern as he saw Cache rub his eyes.
“Peter Pettigrew” Sirius answered.
Vincent nodded and glanced at Blaise, "and you know he had a tendency to pick fights with Gryffindors. We wanted to have his back … as for the trackers … our fathers made us watch you, but they only meant watch. Anything beyond that was our decision … and we wanted to be friends-"
An amused smile slipped onto Harry’s lips “Neville … this place I’m living in is Eventide in Knockturn Alley. I see you know of it” he said with a light chuckle as the look on Neville’s face screamed one phrase ‘are you insane?’ “They never hurt me and that’s much more than I can say for most humans I know … I’ve lived here for a month … with vampires … with werewolves … I shopped in the ‘dark’ stores nearby and I’m still here Nev. I’m still human. No fangs. No bite marks. No urge to howl at the moon … really I take it personally. I’d make a great vampire. What am I chopped liver?” he asked with a look of mock hurt making Trocar laugh.
Harry grinned as he removed “wow, a set of diamonds and … you found it! ‘Ancient Sins Against Nature V1’. Thank you both” he exclaimed hugging Mike.
The only real difference was that no one knew Cache. No expectations. No lies. No famous scar. No father who apparently left a bad impression for people to put on him. Cache was a blank slate.
Harry slipped into his school uniform pants again, drank a Height restorer and looked at the remaining ingredients … it might be possible, but he was too tired to think of the potion theory.
“this isn’t working” Harry sighed as he leaned back in his chair and put his pencil down. It has been five days since the Dursleys left and he hasn’t found out a way to get to Gringotts without possibly getting caught. He has been writing down theories, but nothing added up right “I need an extra ingredient” he musings were broken as the two Kneazles bolted down the stairs playing with a bucket. One of the buckets that the Dursleys so
“considering what happened it’s amazing that I’m alive at all” Cache smiled before being cuddled by two worried kneazles “awww were you guys worried”
“we can eat there. I bet Tom will love you two” Harry chuckled as he open the door to the pub and let them in first
"Tantrum … an interesting word choice to describe what happened." Ruby mused as she directed her sharp brown eyes at Remus who flinched, "what exactly happened?"
“I may never be able to repay him” Lucius chuckled as his fingers laced around a small notch of wood handing from a gold chain around his neck. That little notch was all that was left of his old staff. It was also the piece with the tracker on it. He was a skilled wizard in his own right so while he can’t move the tracker he can use the spell to reveal it and use an accurate cutting spell to whittle down the staff. The rest of the staff went up in flames.
“how did you discover this Harry?” Severus asked curiously as the group stepped into the wizarding bank, which was letting in sunlight near the front right where the floos were. Neither of the vampires let that stop them although the potion master was positive he heard a faint sizzling sound so perhaps one of the vampires didn’t cover themselves well enough … do they serve blood here for this kind of thing?
“bloody hell … this is strange” he gasped. With shear determination he inched his way downstairs and sat at the book covered table “the book said I’d feel a little sore, but only after three doses” he bit out through pained pants. His body burned all over and he felt weak. The only thing he thought would help would be a nutrition potion so he took the second and third doses early with a pain reliever and relaxed with a transfiguring book for a while to give his body time to recover.
Silvia grinned as she dabbed some salve on the last scars on Harry’s back “have you decided on a new name?”
Hermione made a slight noise as if she was trying to not cry, "We … we did something stupid and Dumbledore paid us. The goblins didn't apply any interest, but we still owe a lot." She choked out.
An ominous chuckle escaped Severus’s lips as he looked down at the five cowering fools “the people who try to starve a child to death end up eaten by the child’s protectors … how poetic … at least we have a full day to get reacquainted Petunia” he said thoroughly enjoying the look of terror that crossed her face before the door was closed again sending the prisoners back into darkness …
for Julian” Severus bit out sarcastically.
"Do you really disagree?" She asked as she gently nudged Alice Longbottom awake, "Potion time, Alice! … on dear Merlin! You sat up by yourself!" The healer yelped happily as the woman who has been bedridden for so long showed more control of her motion in years. Alice was still twitching and wasn't focused, but it was something. The healer helped keep her head still and poured the potion in, "All done! Ready, Frank?" She asked as she helped Alice lay back before going over to Frank Longbottom's bed to ready his dose.
“you seem to have gotten some sun. You’re less pale” Lucius said almost suspiciously.
Why wouldn’t his mind just stick to the lightening bolt area and dead trees to represent his trauma over coming face to face with a dark lord? What was that cloud? Why did it make his scar hurt?
“I’m much better thank you. Is that what you wanted to know?” Cache asked as his kneazles were looking at the talking paintings like they were toys.
Cache blinked as he looked away from the salve being put on his hand “oh, I never did say did I? it’s free, you don’t owe me a single knut” he chuckled as he flipped the coin the air and caught it easily with his good hand then he gave it to Draco “one cursed coin, don’t lose it” with that comment the hand was bandaged and the medic left taking the potions with since Cache declined the offer for a pain reliever.
The goblin left Severus in the room and moments later another goblin came in “you certainly like to wait Heir Prince. I am Ironclaw the manager of both your private vault and the Prince vaults”

“are you seriously asking if I want to meet a child with talent?” Severus stated dryly “I’ll stop by at 1:00 to see him” he will finally meet the boy he has been worried about all this time.
“he isn’t … not really at least” Trocar frowned as he was met with expectant looks “Harry doesn’t like showing his scars at all. There was a little slip up in Gringotts where the Malfoy family saw his arm, but just because he doesn’t freak out doesn’t mean he’s fine … he just tries to pretend that nothings wrong and frets a little about what people think later though it has gotten much easier for him each time. Now it’s almost cathartic for him to reveal something painful about his past when he forces himself to talk, but Severus Snape is a very different issue. That man spent an entire year seeing nothing more than a spoiled brat when Harry is far from that. Now Harry has a chance to pick apart that impression so that when Mr. Snape takes the potion to detect the compulsions and has them removed he has the full story. Each scar Harry reveals is a slap in the face waiting to happen … not that Harry’s doing it to be cruel mind you”
Stephen grinned and hugged Aster “don’t be sad. I’ll stay if you’re lonely” Brian chuckled as the healer playfully shoved the empathic wizard away. Stephen laughed as he ducked a pillow thrown by Aster and stood next to Harry’s bed. He gently took the tiny hand in his and fell into a trance for a few seconds “dear Merlin …” Stephen said as he came out of his trance …
“adoption potion?” Harry mumbled as he tried to fight off the sleepiness.
Darkness settled making the crickets quite talkative as the young wizard read with a stubborn determination. This charm was the first thing to be dealt with!
“I’m coming to” Draco said as he and Sasha flooed away with the group leaving his mother behind. They appeared in huge hallway that had several large fireplaces going along the walls.
"Dad?" Ron blinked as he spotted his father enter the Great Hall and the impudent brat sneered as his father came up to him, "What do you want?" he snapped like a whiny kid sulking over being punished, which he was.
Dazzling green eyes glanced around the room in excitement before blushing shyly “it’s brilliant, thank you” Mickey was howling in excitement.
Draco raised his hand and pointed at the ‘mistletoe berries’ piled in the jar “frog eyes, the pupils shrank so they only look like berries”
“What?! Excuse me, we’ll talk later, Minerva.” Severus said before leaving the confused transfiguration professor alone with the two goblins.
"Of course! We had to watch him! Someone had to keep him safe when he pisses people off!" Greg barked.
Griphook scoffed “anything really. Books, jewelry and people …” the goblin glanced at Harry who seemed be as prepared for this as he’ll ever be.
“indeed” Severus hissed and scowled as he rubbed his temple in an attempt to ease his headache that wasn’t being eased by the pain reliever. The pain was most likely caused by the spells being removed so it has to stop on its own “the spells on me would’ve had a terrible effect on me … if you told me there’s a chance I could’ve fought the mind controlling because of my Occlumency ttraining, but for how long … I don’t know and I don’t know who put them on me so I could’ve done or said something to the wrong person without knowing”
Severus couldn’t stop the blush that spread across his cheeks nor the flutter in his heart so he leaned up and kissed the vampire ”we’ll see. Right now I actually am busy”
"What about- … oh right. You were told about Sirius' …" Remus fumbled for the right word, "tantrum." He said sheepishly as the older witch took a seat in the living room.
It was nearly unseen except by Harry, but Draco did look hurt by the comment “for your information you filthy mudblood, Cache is a friend and friends tend to do things together. Though I suspect you’re unfamiliar with the concept considering you aren’t buying anything for Potter with it being his birthday and all” Draco saw the witch flinch sight and smirked, he knew it was true “I don’t know exactly what’s going, but I know you and Weasel are not Potter’s friends. You better hope he doesn’t figure that out too”
“I don’t think you understand Severus” Cache said knowing that the first sign that the potions are working is that the body stops fighting to keep the spells in control. It will take a moment more for his mind to clear “I just did”
Once the food came Harry pulled two food bowls out of his bottomless bag and put the meat in it to distract the kneazles “Poppy said that she wanted me to meet someone who was considering teaching me potions, would that be you Mr. Snape?” Cache asked as he set the food bowls down and let the kneazles start eating.
“I …” Arthur took a deep breath, “I want to file for divorce and file charges against Albus Dumbledore for-”
The rest of the meal was spent in silence until the meeting Minerva suggested, “We have a few issues to discuss starting with a replacement for Lockhart. Any suggestions?”
“awesome, thanks David. Bye” Cache waved and left to continue looking through the rest of Knockturn ally taking note of when all the stores open from the signs in the windows of each store. It looks like there were some apartments too! Once he came back he was definitely going to check out those and the book store and potion shop too, but not today. He still had to restock on food and visit that Emporium … and his kneazles could be worried.
“Julian River White” the green eyes glittered with happiness and for the first time looked Aster in the eyes before quickly hiding his face shyly. Brian smiled at his son’s actions. Little by little Julian was coming out of his shell.
“WHAT?!” Ron screamed.
“that was a pensieve worthy moment” Griphook cackled as he switched out with a goblin who was actually a clerk
"Still not using Severus' floo huh …" Draco commented as he carried his owl's cage as Harry brought his trunk into the apartment. He was still curious as to why Harry suddenly became so hesitant to go into Severus' living quarters.
“Julian tell me what’s wrong” Brian urged the small child in the bed.
“what happened now?” Poppy said harsher than she intended.
Just as Cache set the two chocolate cauldrons down on the picnic table a voice behind him was heard “I should’ve figured you would go this far away from the mob of shoppers”
“yes” Severus answered honestly. Never had he mentioned his plans for his godson’s tormentors, but they must’ve realized it eventually.
It was a birthday party. Harry never had one or even celebrated his birthday really. Draco and the residents of Eventide were the first to care. Tears were threatening to come out of his eyes, but that didn’t matter. Harry was happy. Trocar didn’t even let he boy remove the disguise before pulling him to the large pile of present and beautifully decorated cake in the living room. No cared about how he looked and constantly taking off the disguise is were mistakes can happen so they did agree that the disguise shouldn’t be removed often … Harry just forgets sometimes …
Ginny was the last student to be sorted and she excitedly at down. Once the sorting hat perched on her head the first Weasley in history was named … “Slytherin!”
At this hour no one was up so the blonde blue eyed wizard and his two kneazles went towards the Leaky Cauldron completely unseen. The more he knows about himself the better. He wanted to know if he was a natural healer as soon as possible and how it could benefit him. Just from the one healing book he started he knew it might be what his career would be!
Over the next few hours he instructed Cache on what exercises to work on and how much to do. The boy diligently completed each activity without complaining and they switched to history and law as it became lunchtime. The lessons only stopped when someone knocked on the door … it was Sanguini …
“there’s a tracking charm on me?! Bloody hell!” Hedwig hooted angrily and flexed her talons at her owner’s declaration. Someone was tracking Harry? Oh hell no! She was ready to rip someone’s eyes out. He quickly grabbed the charms book again and continued reading. As tempting as it was to skip to the answer for removing the tracker he didn’t want to miss one detail. After all there’s no need to rush.
“from a scroll” Harry commented vaguely albeit he was a bit distracted with this most recent change and hoped this can be solved without any more drama.
Poppy came back with a ring that had a wand crossed with a bone craved on it “this will only work for you, but don’t lose it. You have to wear it to get in the lab and since you proved yourself you can use it as a stamp with candle wax to get test potions into the experimenting lab. Now you can make potions at home and send them in, but you must stamp it. Experimental potions are different. You have to come in when notified about results and show that your stamp signature matches the one on the test potion to receive the results or you don’t get the results. Understand?” Cache nodded “good here’s your ring. Just use candle wax to use the stamp. We start lessons … after this weekend, every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. We’ll just meet in the lobby at 8:00 and I’ll bring books for you to go over on the first day”
Cache chuckled as the man paid “I’ll see you tomorrow Severus” as the man exited he wondered why he felt like something seemed strange about the man was acting now “do you think he’ll teach me that billowing robe trick too?” the kneazles rolled their eyes as they handed over their empty food bowls …
Light gray dry tongues flicked out to catch the drops much to Harry’s relief. Two pairs of golden eyes snapped open and eyed him warily “I won’t hurt you” the wizard said softly and slowly backed away making sure they could see his hands at all times. He opened two windows and propped open the backdoor making it clear that he wasn’t stopping them from leaving.
“fuck that excuse! That only means you would need a nanny to watch him that one day, at most two days, a month for your change and recovering from it! Other than that you could’ve raised him just fucking fine! It doesn’t mean you should cut yourself out completely and leave your cub with random people! What kind of werewolf are you to allow that?” Moody growled angrily as he slammed his fist against the wall. He was getting fed up with this attitude and lack of knowledge.
A long stretch of time passed and a large block castle with four block towers was built around Draco before the Malfoy parents came back to their senses …
“Crowning!” Trocar yelled as he saw the baby’s head coming out of Jenny. Harry jolted back to his work and finished the worst of the werewolf’s wound before rushing over to Jenny to help deliver. He noted that Mike’s contractions were getting closer and closer together so he’d soon need to preform a C-section to get the baby out.
“I am Ironclaw. I will be acting as a witness so once the potion master, Severus Snape, the goblin Griphook who handled your case thus far and the head of our bank, Ragnuk, all arrive we can start. Refreshments or snacks?” the goblin offered as some drinks and little cakes and cookies appeared on the table. Brian chuckled as Julian shyly took a cookie and said thank you …
Ron yelped and rubbed his head where it hit the floor as he shot his brother a glare “fucking bast-”
Once everything settled down Harry took a deep breath, gave himself a moment to concentrate and tried again ”Lumos”
Neville came out of the bathroom and started packing too “you ok Harry?” he asked softly so the many other Gryffindors didn’t hear,
That means Brian had better be careful and Severus too if they find him. Although the UK potions master has been wanting to meet the Australian potion masters who made the potions for Julian so … lets hope it ends well …
XXXXXXXXXX
Brian’s entire body turned blue!
"The Minister asked me to ensure that someone was present. It was a rather urgent matter so please understand my inability to meet you here personally." She said noticing the small amount of annoyance in the vampire's voice. The thought of a pissed off vampire being in her office concerned her a great deal especially with students not far away.
The potion master was furious though he skillfully hid it “it seems the incompetence lies with your professor with your professor, but no matter. I will be teaching you from now on. Do you have any ideas on where you would like to start?”
Ron spun around to meet the chest of someone. His eyes traveled upwards to meet the blue eyes of the person some call Cache “I errr …”
The large garage opened revealing a medium sized cargo plane …
"He may be your apprentice, but at least ask Severus first before blabbing. He might skin both of your hides if he finds out." Draco warned getting nervous chuckles from Harry and Isaac.
“you seem to have everything set so I’ll leave you to it. I’ll come back the day after tomorrow to remove the IV so he hopefully won’t wake up with it still in. I am using the full course nutrition potions, but he will still be hungry when he wakes up and if he’s in pain one spoonful of pain reliever twice a day at most no more. Tell me once he’s awake ok?” Aster said softly as she headed for the door.
“what are you all fawning over? Those things aren’t real kneazles not like my Crookshanks” Hermione snapped as she pointed over to her cat who was on top of the Gryffindor table licking itself and successfully disturbing those who were still eating. It seems she wanted to snow him off and brought him to the Great Hall.
“that is where you are wrong. Your mother was disowned after you were born so you still are the heir. She refused any and all contact from your grandparents who tried to sue to gain custody of you. On the day she died your grandparents were long gone, but the magical guardian who was appointed to you and supposedly removed lots of money for your care should have explained all this. When you became an adult he was locked out of the vaults and strangely we found that we couldn’t get a hold of you” Ironclaw said as he tapped his long sharp nails on the desk in front of him. clearly the goblin was already aware of what or, to be more precise,
“I made a mistake.” Harry said and his kneazles nuzzled him comfortingly. Severus felt his heart sink thinking that Harry meant something with the births and the babies died, “I gave both babies to Trocar and he refuses to let them go.” Harry groaned getting a chuckle from the three patients including Mike who looked pale after having the baby removed.
“oh … good, you worried me for a second there … if you’re going into potions too you should check out their testing room. I hear you can test new potions there or get a job selling potions” Tom suggested.
“cool … hey Dad can I visit Julian?” Draco asked clearly not as innocent as he sounded.
(Crap! I forgot to pick a name! think, think … think faster!) for some reason his mouth spat out “Cache Devant Vous, I just moved here. I came to check out potion ingredients” the name he choose seemed right, it was a little French he learned when Vernon was practiced to meet a French speaking client … he was looking for a promotion by getting more than one language under his belt. Harry got more out of it than he did and no, he didn’t the promotion …
Neville watched with a horrorstricken look on his face for a second. Harry did a turn to show the scars on his back, but nothing more. Neville was smart enough to know the green eyed wizard had scars below the belt as well and didn’t ask to be shown more than what Harry allowed. As the shock wore off Harry noticed there was no pity in his friend’s eyes. There was only a silent demand to know everything.
Harry liked it and it was decided … Cache moves in tomorrow morning with his kneazles and owl where he’ll be keyed into his room’s wards …
The bank statements proved some suspicions he had about Hermione and Ron … they were being paid. The first payment was made right before school started “I knew something about Granger and Weasley wasn’t right. They’re being paid to be my friends … and with my own money!” it infuriated him! He wished he made friends with Draco instead.
“you know the incantation is only meant to reveal trackers so it’s possible that this Bellatrix tied the curse to the tracker, which would explain why it started glowing too. I might be able to remove it too with the tracker” said Cache calmly despite not liking this situation Draco is in.
Cache smiled and held up his hand, which was still slightly glowing, "This is the shield charm. It covers your entire body as you can see. I'm using a lot of power so you can see it, but this much is not needed and normally you can't see it."
The rain, animals and bugs were kept out with special wards mixed with spells and the temperature was controlled by runes on the walls of each room. It was also impossible to fall off do to several safety spells spun into the rails, stairs and bridges. Brian White may be an adventurous man, but he wasn’t stupid. As a headmaster with the job of watching children, safety was always the first priority. The only way down to the forest floor was an odd looking set of wooden elevators that hangs off to the dining room porch and floats up or down.
I’m thinking)
There on the perch above Ami/Hedwig was a dark owl Harry recognized “It’s Severus’s owl, Sinon” he said as he got up to collect a small box that was hanging by strong twine from the owl’s carrier. Sinon must’ve flown in through the open balcony door instead of going through the owlery. Hedwig didn’t seem to mind the owl sharing her perch, but maybe that was because it started drizzling outside.
XXXXXXXXXX
What Neville didn’t know was that the thin line of undamaged skin going from the middle of Harry’s left shoulder blade to the middle of his back was not luck. In fact that little strip of flesh may be the proof of a future cure for his parents’. However Harry never mentioned it just in case it didn’t work …
“I … I never lied to you professor” Harry said nervously as a foreboding feeling filled the room. Trocar and Armel moved to stand next to Harry with their fangs bared protectively, but it wasn’t enough to stop what happened next …
Interestingly enough the crystal ball shut off not revealing Julian encountering Quirrell or the conversation between Brian and Julian or even Remus who managed to hobble out of the office chasing after Sirius’s scent without the old wizard seeing him …
This poor guy stumbled into the thorny grip of some Devil’s Snare and was covered in hundreds of gashes. The worst were the ones around the throat where the plant attempted to strangle him. Cache watched as Poppy and four other healers saved the guy, but Poppy left one tiny cut on the man’s foot for Cache after he proved he knew the incantation she told him.
"The Crippens are the only other muggle people I know and they made it possible for me to be here by getting my trackers out of the country, albeit unknowingly. They're good people and they only reported that Harry Potter contacted them claiming that he found his godfather and was safe." Harry said, but found himself meeting the no nonsense look in the silver eyes and chuckled. "Ok, ok. The reason I went through them was to imply that I was still in muggle world."
Poppy paled “dear Merlin! What the bloody hell is going through his head?!” she snapped as she grabbed a bag full things she may need and followed after her panicking apprentice to the floo in the lobby two floors down “how did this happen?”
“damn … what do I -… do now?” Dumbledore choked out. There was no time to prepare a ritual. He can’t go and hunt down Severus to make a Poly Juice potion without even a hair. It’s also moments before the mob of students comes through the gates. Without any option left he used his wand to clean up the mess and unfreeze the paintings. Everything, save for a few burns on his skin, was cleared by the time he heard a knock on the door “come in” he called and one Severus Snape entered.
“freak” Harry responded.
"Any student having issues with money can make a deal with us. We will find low prices on what you need, offer scholarships and find you summer jobs to help. This, by the way, is only the beginning of what Gringotts can offer and it's something you should've discussed with us face to face instead of using that wallet. Speaking of," Gritmace made a 'give me' gesture with his clawed hand. Hermione stiffened, but reluctantly pulled out her wallet and handed it over. "I will have a new wallet made for you after we discuss what should've been discussed in the first place-"
XXXXXXXXXX
“of course” Hermione huffed a bit annoyed that he thought she knew nothing.
“it was no trouble. So when are you going back to school?” Brian asked.
XXXXXXXXXX
Severus nodded “indeed … I gave Griphook the Gaunt ring and the locket since they were goblin made and heirlooms. They’ll take care of it and I was informed that there was a horcrux protocol in all Gringotts banks so if I suspect that a specific item was used the goblins could enter the vault with the orb and legally take the horcrux for me. A piece of someone’s soul doesn’t belong to anyone even if you own the item the horcrux is stuck to. If the locket was used I suspect the other founder items were used save for the sword of Gryffindor. Griphook is setting up an investigation to see if anything can be found … and now that Hogwarts is out for the summer I have time to handle arrangements so Gringotts is transferring my bank accounts over to Australia”
"Fine." Trocar pouted and zipped over to Mike for feeding as Harry put the potion in his eyes to turn them blue before giving Mike and Greyback a selection of potions including a Pepper up and nutrition potion to help the new parents.
Cache nodded, "Yes. The door to the Janus Thickey Ward is monitored and everyone recorded going through the door was put under veritaserum. Since everyone was cleared of attacking Dumbledore and no patients in the ward could walk it was ruled a natural blowout, which can happen. It was very serious for a natural one, but no one could've done it. However, I spoke to the Minister and … you both need to be prepared for what you'll see. The blowout wasn't just severe enough to make it dangerous to move him or even use veritaserum, but it badly burned him too. It won't be pretty." He said watching Hermione and Ron carefully hoping they unstood what they were going to see, but he knew it will be a shock no matter what he said. "Ron, your dad is going to meet us right outside the floo and take you both up to the Janus Thickey Ward. Neville, your parents and the other Janus Thickey patients were moved to the lobby level and are safe in the back room of the lab. Ok … everyone ready?"
