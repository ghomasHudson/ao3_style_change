And so fall changed into winter and Draco continued looking forward to seeing Harry again. He was aware that he had a crush but he didn’t act on it. As far as he knew Harry wasn’t interested and coming onto him might only push him away; better to take what he could get and let the rest stay a fantasy in his head.
“Good morning my dear. Are you feeling better yet?” Draco whispered, receiving a satisfied hum as reply.

To his own surprise, Draco woke without much of a hangover. His head hurt slightly, but that could as well have been due to lying weirdly sometime in the night. Checking the time, he briefly considered staying in bed until lunch and then heading to the kitchen while everyone else was in the Great Hall, but eventually he decided against it. If he was to wait for lunch, he might as well go into the Hall, maybe he could tease Pansy some more. And he should probably talk to Blaise. Even though he wasn’t sure what exactly went on between Blaise and Neville — or how Hannah Abbott fit into the mix — he knew they should talk about the kiss.
“Fair point, I will give you that. Nonetheless I am willing to help you now and I am here of my own accord so stop being a prick and give me your hand, you’re shivering,” Harry demanded and Draco wanted to resist, but Harry unceremoniously grabbed his arm and pulled Draco’s hand into his own. The moment their skin touched, Draco felt at ease again. A low sigh escaped him.
Harry got pulled from his thoughts when everyone scrambled to their feet and tables were levitated to the side. Apparently they had reached the practical part of the lesson.  He joined Ron and Hermione in one of the corners awaiting the instructions. Hermione quickly and easily conjured a corporeal Patronus before simply conjuring three huge pillows for the trio to sit on. Harry and Ron followed her example and sat down next to her.
“Ever heard of a warming charm Potter? I know it might be a novel concept to you but they do exist,” came the condescending answer out of the armchair opposite him. Harry felt the need to point out that robes were a thing too and did so only moments later. To his surprise the other answered without malice or disdain in his voice.
“So you HAVE been hiding something from us!” Pansy exclaimed in outrage, pulling Draco and Harry from their little cocoon.
Draco let out another snort at the noticeable effort to remain secretive. “Them, Pansy? Really? Don’t play that shit with me, you’re almost as gay as I am.” He hesitated a moment and then decided to continue anyway, “Or since when does Hermione go by they/them?”
“In case I hadn’t made that clear last time, Potter, You can’t help me. Nor do I want you to.” Malfoy hissed, his eyes sparkling with anger, “So leave me alone.”
“Because I’m me.” Harry bemoaned. “Because it will be a big deal once the paper catches wind of it.” A short pause, as if he was unsure of whether he should tell the next part or not. “Because I like this guy and I don’t want the papers accusing him of ‘turning me gay’ or imperius-ing me.”
“Congrats?” answered Malfoy in between bites. Moments later his eyes went wide, a blush crept up his cheeks. He put the fork down. “What did I do?”
Relieved, Draco thanked the professor and then excused himself. There was no need to have yet another meltdown in front of her.
He had made exactly 2 steps when he heard someone calling his name. He turned and saw Harry running towards him.
The way from his dorm to the common room was too short to come up with any answers. With his thoughts still racing and his heart beating too fast he reached the study table. Pansy was already sitting there with Granger on her left, leaving the other side of the table to him. Draco gently put his books down and let his bag slide from his shoulder.
“Could you maybe help me up please?” he asked reluctantly and through gritted teeth, the effect being ruined by his unsteady voice and the shaking of his extended hand.
Hermione said her goodbyes and gently pulled Draco out of the classroom and towards their common room. Some studying seemed the perfect opportunity to get Draco to focus his mind on something else.
Confused Draco looked at her and then he realised that Pansy just gave him the game’s equivalent of a skip. Still he thought about the question for a moment.
The ‘problem’ had made itself known around Halloween, when the weather was positively chilly. The charm work inside the castle walls had apparently been affected more than originally presumed, leaving many classrooms without weather protection. Like a net unraveling, the failing temperature charms were seeping into other parts of the castle and by the beginning of December not one common room was left unaffected and McGonnagall had had enough.
Mere minutes later Harry was grinding against Draco, groaning and sending shivers up his spine. As Draco pulled Harry’s jumper up over his head, Harry stilled and concentrated briefly. Seconds later they were naked and Draco suppressed a moan at the blatant display of wandless magic. He captured the other’s lips again and let his hands wander over the bare skin of Harry, pulling him closer still. Their cocks rubbed against each other leaving them both panting.
Silently glaring at each and every student present, Draco thanked Merlin and Morgana that he still held some power within Slytherin house, as each and every student turned away at his clear challenge. Every one of them, except for Pansy and Blaise, who were staring at him with shocked expressions. Deciding to ignore them for the time being, Draco nuzzled Harry’s hair with his nose and murmured, “You know that everyone can see you, right?”
When Draco didn’t verbally react to her statement, she went on. “There is a reason why your parole is set the way it is, why Narcissa merely has house arrest even though your father will spend the rest of his life in Azkaban. The Wizengamot believes, as do I, that you will be a functional member of our society given the chance to actually be yourself. And given what I have seen of you in the last two months I have no doubt about it. You have already changed into a person of your own, visibly resenting the ideals your father has forced upon you. This will only strengthen over time.”
“Welcome to Dragon Cakes and Coffee, what can I get you today?” He said cheerfully while he placed the tray on the counter, his head snapping up when he heard the incredulous, “Malfoy??”
Almost content, Draco headed towards the closest hairstylist. He had had to take off the hat in order for Leah to pierce him, and after she had finally stopped laughing enough to listen, he had explained his original reason for heading into town. Still chuckling slightly, she had explained the way, reminding him to be careful with his ears.
“As a general rule you have the right to refuse to talk about anything you don’t want to talk about. There might be moments where I will ask why you chose to remain silent, especially if you decide on starting your healing journey with me, but you don’t have to tell me anything.”
The episode on Saturday had left him exhausted enough to sleep through his ringing wand and consequently, to him missing breakfast on Sunday morning. With his only real source of daily food gone, Draco began to panic. He couldn’t go to meal times like a regular student, last night had shown that, but he needed some food; he was famished. And despite what Pansy thought, he wasn’t trying to starve himself.
Draco nearly couldn’t believe his ears. “That’s all?” he asked in disbelief, “No comment about those horrid muggle trousers? Only that my impromptu haircut needs some cleaning up?”
At the mention of a mind healer, Draco’s brain provided him with the memories of Lucius sneering about ‘those weirdos’ that were in need of such utter nonsense. So he declined the offer with a simple, “Thank you professor, but no thank you.” and let his eyes flick towards the clock. If he wanted to make it to muggle studies in time he had to leave now.
When they broke apart, they were both breathless, “Sorry, I’ve wanted to do that for weeks.” Harry admitted. Draco simply pulled him back in into another kiss, cherishing the warmth of Harry's lips against his; taking in the intoxicating mix of sandalwood aftershave and the fresh December air around them.
“Not necessarily. I’m not exactly opposed to it but I am more into marks. Lovebites, bruises, rope marks…. that kind of stuff. That and some power play, some bondage.” Draco shakes his head and with more determination asks, “You’ve never tried choking then?”
Harry carefully crawled backwards towards the edge of the bed and kneeled down on the floor. He reached up, grabbing the tops of Draco’s calfs, pulling him so his hips were at the edge of the bed. Harry gave the cock before him an appreciative look before he lowered his head to the base of Draco’s cock, breathing in the pure essence of him, groaning at the intoxicating scent. He kissed the crevice between thigh and groin before taking his tongue and licking unhurriedly from the base to the tip of Draco’s cock. When he got to the tip, he twirled his tongue around the head before taking it fully in his mouth and sucking.
A moan escapes Harry at those words and he involuntarily bucks his hips up. Draco tsks disapprovingly and uses his knees to pin Harry’s hips down, while his left forearm pushes Harry’s shoulders into the backrest, effectively rendering him immobile. Harry has to bite his lips to stop another moan from escaping.
As if it were obvious, Potter only motioned between the two of them. “It’s you and me. You have hated me since forever.”
I didn't actually plan on making Morris this horrid but it somehow happened so... Sorry I guess? At least it doesn't end that bad??
Harry playfully slaps Chris on the arm and then turns serious with a sigh. “Honestly, I don’t even know anymore.”
“I didn’t know if it was okay to touch you. I read that some people react badly when you touch them while panicking and didn’t want to make it worse.” Pansy said in explanation and Draco nodded. Both telling her he understood as well as allowing her to pull him into her arms.
The scent of too much incense burning at once wafted into his face when Harry entered the Divination classroom. He wasn’t sure why he still took the blasted class; prophecies had already dictated too much of his life.
McGonagall sat her teacup down and folded her hands. “That is perfectly understandable, Mister Malfoy. Most teenagers have to face the values they have been taught at one point, even if only to accept them as their own. You happen to have had those values forcefully reevaluated for you by others, which complicates the process a bit. But it is a process. Take the time to find your own values.”
A few chapters later he got interrupted again. This time it was Potter, who cleared his throat and leaned against the armchair across from Draco.
Afterwards Draco had lain in Harry’s lap, not unlike the position he was in right now. They had caught their breaths and had a very awkward talk about their emotions and their relationship.
Instinctively, Draco raised his arms to cover his head, trying to protect himself from the violence like he had done so many times in the first few weeks of the term. However, Morris was taking none of that and tied Draco’s arms to the chair with a silent
He wasn’t willing to explain that Mister Malfoy was his father, not him. That that was what his father had expected his “underlings” to call him, what his father had told him to carry as an honour. It didn’t feel honorable anymore, just dirty. The war and his family's actions had erased all traces of respect from his former pride. What remained was nothing but a reminder of his mistakes. And a reminder of his father.
Malfoy stays rigid for the whole demonstration, only moving occasionally to tap twice on Malcolm’s arm — the signal to stop and loosen the hold. Malcolm had taught it to them when they had started to learn lever holds.
That was when it clicked in Draco’s head and he felt himself grow pale. Burning room, seventh floor, Hermione and Potter.
“You have all done well enough that we will start with actual training fights. We will start in a kneeling position and your goal is to pin the opponent onto their back. As is customary within japanese martial arts, there is etiquette to be followed. At the beginning and at the end of each
The interior was kept in shades of dark blue and black with occasional details in cream white. The absolute best part was the ceiling though, thousand little stars glittered and made it seem as if they were underneath a clear night sky. Draco even recognized some constellations.
Pressing his shoulder blades into the backrest, Draco thrust into Harry, who dug his fingernails into the pale chest, as the head of Draco’s cock hit his prostate. Gripping Harry’s hips even tighter, Draco thrust into Harry over and over again, the slapping of their skin mixing with their panting and their moans.
No matter how many times Pansy, Blaise and Draco had joked about their collective queerness, all of them had had the foresight to not be too open about it before this year. There had been expectations on all of them. A marriage, no matter how loveless or arranged, had always been looming in each of their futures, but those expectations had burned within the aftermaths of the war.
Draco blamed Seamus Finnigan for his current predicament. They sat in a loose circle around one of the tables in the common room, the couches and armchairs pushed together. The table was filled with bottles of butterbeer and shot glasses, only a small circle in the middle was clear, leaving enough room to spin a wand.
There were less people present than he had expected. Hannah, Blaise and Neville sat on one of the couches, with Hermione and Pansy sitting opposite them, Susan Bones and Terry Boot in armchairs on either side.
When the day came to an end, Harry took the stairs up, passing Neville and Dean’s door to his dreaded room that he had avoided all day. He knocked this time, but didn’t really wait for an invitation, ’let Malfoy be angry’ he thought.
It turned out that the market wasn’t a farmers market as they expected, but rather a Christmas market, which made Draco somehow even more excited. As if the mere existence of Christmas markets was wonderful and the fact that Draco could visit one was a miracle.
It was late afternoon when Harry really realised why Malfoy had been so scared. Not only had his moaning disclosed that he liked Harry, but that he liked
Granger was another problem. Draco had written letters to everyone while on house arrest and his letter to Granger had taken a toll on him. He knew he had treated her worse than most, bullying her because of his distorted racism as well for personal reasons. He had since grown as a person and realized how wrong his views had been, how he had been jealous about this supposedly “inferior”
Before he could find it though, Malfoy let out yet another moan, followed by a mumbled “please…..fuck me, please. PLEASE!” Harry froze. This was worse than the bloody cuddling.
“You haven’t been eating in the Great Hall for weeks now.” No question, no accusation, just stating facts and Draco was shocked that she noticed. But then again, she had agreed to supervise his parole while at Hogwarts. She probably had to notice.
“No way,” Malfoy said, “I am NOT sharing a bed with you. Not happening.” Despite his words Malfoy didn’t move out of the doorway. His voice shaking slightly, the normal haughtiness and sneer seeming off, “Don’t you have your own house you can go to? Visit the Weasel? ANYTHING?”
The fourth floor in the Western tower was guarded by a landscape painting. The beautiful scenery of a sunrise in an English countryside wasn´t as effective as the hidden entrance to Slytherin, but since it was activated only by the magical signature of the “8th year students” as they were called, there was no possibility of anyone entering without permission.
Harry winced at that. He had originally planned to spend Christmas at the Burrow, but after his break up with Ginny, his plans had changed. It’s not that any of the Weasleys blamed him for the breakup but things between him and his ex-girlfriend were rather awkward, and Harry could do without living with her for a month.
‘Some couples reported the bond to be almost sentient. In the case of Willibald Wodlington and his wife Emmaline there are multiple documented instances of the bond flaring up despite the continuous contact between the two. The pair discovered that the bond does differentiate between the forms of contact and their inherent intimacy.
A soft smile graced the witches face and for a moment she reminded Draco of Pansy. Fierce, loyal, smart.
“Draco, you could have said something. You know I'm here for you, darling. Please, don’t shut me out…” Pansy tried.
After a moment Draco’s eyes went wide. “I said your name, didn’t I?” he asked, blushing again and it was Harry's turn to be confused by the question. Draco squeezed his eyes shut for a moment, steeling himself for what he would say next.
A blush crept up Harry’s neck and cheeks. “uhm. I- Sorry.” he stuttered, and quickly cancelled the sticking charm and wards, but to his surprise Malfoy didn’t apparate away instantly, he simply stood there and watched Harry. Moments passed and Harry shifted uncomfortably under the calculating gaze. “You- uhm, you wanna come in? Could I offer you tea or something?” The offer was stupid and he knew it. With the manor close by, Harry doubted Malfoy would ever ac-
As for topics covered this time: mental breakdown, needles, tattoos and piercings, coming out, and verbal attacks/insults.
“We’re planning a party for next week, before we all head home for Christmas.” Hermione explained, “I actually wanted your opinions on where to hold it. I think it would be nice to invite some of the 7th years and that would mean we can’t have the party here, like we usually do.”
“You’re so good Harry. You are perfect. Merlin the sounds you make…” Draco praises and a few moments later Harry realises that his hands had flown up to Draco’s shoulder blades and were currently digging into him tightly. He sheepishly tries to loosen his grip but Draco only shakes his head, “Leave them” he orders.
Clearly not having expected them to cave so easily, Hermione’s eyes widened in surprise and moments later, she smiled brightly. Squealing slightly, she nearly vibrated in her seat. “I knew it! Oh Harry! I’m so happy for you.”
Harry slowly stood up again, his hands going back to his jeans and as he watches, Draco reaches a hand down to his cock. He was already so close he could probably come from just watching the Adonis of a man undress himself.
Before his mind could blow his fear out of proportion though, Harry timidly said, “Yes, please.” and the butterflies spread from his stomach to his whole body. Happiness flooded Draco and he revelled in it, enjoying the feeling.
“So, I don’t know if you’ve heard of it yet, but there are talks about another get-together after the Hogsmeade trip. Mostly the same people as last time, but I still wanted to tell you in advance in case you needed the time to mentally prepare yourself for it.” Hermione said.
Draco was surprised that he had noticed that. “Some Potions require a specific oil base, but mostly it’s just been lumped in together. It has both historic and property reasons.” He started the explanation.
Feeling his chest untighten, Draco realised he must have missed the latest statement but since he didn’t feel compelled to drink, he didn’t bother asking Pansy what it had been. Instead he focused back on the game, it was one of the younger Ravenclaw’s turn.
“Cast an observation ward and you can basically do anything else.” Draco said and Harry followed his advice mere seconds later. Sitting on one of the tables they weren’t currently using, Draco observed Harry as he began cleaning the cutting area. With each passing second the Gryffindor seemed to grow more fidgety.  When the workstation was clean, Harry kept his eyes firmly trained at the smooth wood.
“Just outside of Diagon Alley. And you might not know it as it isn´t officially open yet. They open next friday. And before you think I threw around my name: I didn´t. I just happen to know the owners.”
Draco quickly reassured her and promised that he would think about it. To his own surprise, the prospect of an evening together didn’t feel threatening. On the contrary, he was rather looking forward to it.
“I am keeping us secret for you. Because you don’t want everyone knowing yet and that’s perfectly fine! Your reasons are solid and I probably would have asked the same in your position. But this is Hermione we’re talking about. She will be happy for us once we tell her, and you know it. I’m fine with telling our friends about our relationship when you’re ready for it.”
Potter sighed and answered, “I… kinda need help with Potions.” There was a blush spreading across his cheeks and Draco could basically feel Pansy trying not to laugh.
“No I don’t,” Harry shot back, which was technically not true. He had Grimmauld Place, but the place was filled with too many memories he didn’t dare unpack yet and therefore, he had no desire to go anywhere near the place. Even back during the summer he couldn’t bring himself  to enter the ancestral home once, so he stayed at the Burrow and later on Hogwarts.
Immediately awake, Harry realized that not only was he on Malfoys side of the bed, but also that Malfoy was cuddling him from behind. Hastily, Harry scrambled to his still damp side of the bed, and turned off his alarm. Glad to be away from Malfoy, Harry left the room quickly before the Slytherin could fully wake up.
“It wasn’t me! Ginny dared him to do it, although none of us expected to get that much of a show out of it.” Pansy justified and Draco realised he was screwed. If the mischievous glint had nothing to do with starting the situation then Pansy had figured out why Draco had allowed it in the first place.
“Can’t you just go to your fucking manor if sharing a bed bugs you this much?” Harry found himself asking hopefully, although he knew that Malfoy indeed could not go back to the manor. The ministry had confiscated it along with most of the Malfoy funds for the time being.
A smirk appears on Draco’s face and with a slight shake of his head he admonishes, “Oh Harry. If I had wanted you to undress me, I would have told you so. Now, be good and watch me.” and Harry watches. He watches as Draco slowly reveals pale skin and lean muscles. His cock is throbbing by the time Draco pulls off the dark shirt and carelessly tosses it aside. Instead of starting on removing his trousers though, Draco gathers his hair together and puts it into a messy bun, anchoring it with his wand. Harry moans and pulls at his restraints again, Draco looks ethereal, sitting on top of him, wearing just his black trousers and grey eyes wandering over Harry.
Shocked that McGonagall was apparently offering him access to the kitchens just so that he could have a decent, hot meal, Draco blurted out “Pansy and Hermione are working on that, They’re forcing me to breakfast tomorrow.”
It took him by surprise when instead of shrugging it off or claiming that it was the right thing to do, Potter caught his eyes and stated, “You are worth saving. You don’t owe me anything.
Despite it being a vacation, Harry got up early the next day. He ate his breakfast at the kitchen window with his winter boots on. Halfway into Harry’s second cup of tea, Malfoy appeared in between the trees — jacket-less yet again — walking the path that led past the cottage. Patiently, Harry waited for Malfoy to come into proximity, observing every move until then. The moment he was certain that Malfoy was within bounds, Harry threw up an anti-apparition jinx and stormed out of the house.
“Can I hug you?” Draco blurted, unable to resist the need to comfort the other, and not knowing how else to do it. Upon Potter nodding, he scooted closer and pulled him into his arms, uncaring about his undone shirt. He buried his nose into the dark mess of hair, letting his own tears fall again while murmuring, “It’s okay. I forgive you.” over and over.
But between his homework and his nightmares, he was lucky if he got more than four hours of sleep at night. The circles underneath his eyes were dark and even a glamour couldn’t hide them completely.
“Never have I ever slept with someone who was more than 5 years older than me.” was Weasley’s contribution and Draco watched in amazement as Hermione cursed and took a shot.
The light reflecting off of her ear caused him to look at her properly. “Does it hurt?” he asked without thinking.
“You really don’t know?” Again no words, but Harry manages to slightly shake his head. Malfoy snatches the empty glass from Harry’s hand, placing it on the side table, and swiftly straddles him. Leaning close to Harry’s ear he whispers, “I could make you see it, you know? I could show you just what you make me want to do to you.” He pauses, letting his breath ghost over Harry’s neck, grinning at the slight shiver running through the darker man’s body. Draco leans back in, “But you never answered my question.”
“You do realise that Madame Pomfrey can heal all of that, right? And that McGonagall would help you if you were to tell her about the bullying?” Hermione reminded him with a sad smile.
Draco in return only huffed and shuffled into the bathroom, clearly not a morning person. Harry carefully categorized that info, although he didn’t know why he bothered. Harry left the room so his roommate could wake up properly, and went to put his prepared bread in the oven.
Draco was overwhelmed — he wasn't going to Azkaban. The wizard kept going on about finer details of his sentence but Draco barely focused on him. He had just received the slightest chance to right his past wrongs.
He was just about to reach up to stroke his hands through the black curls, when the timer chimed to signify that the potion was ready. Both of them flinched at the noise and they pulled apart. Desperately pulling himself together, Draco cast a few diagnostic charms on the potion and deemed it acceptable.
The doorstep. He couldn’t cross the doorstep. In his chest, his heart tried to escape his ribcage and he belatedly realised that he had stopped breathing. Hastily he inhaled.
The boy seemed excited at being treated like a normal customer, if his smile was any indication. Again he looked at his godfather, his eyes big. “You can pick 10 cookies, if you promise me to not eat them all at once,” Potter said and Teddy jumped with excitement, promising to do as he was asked. Potter chuckled and signed for him to get to choosing.
Instead of listening to Draco, Harry pulled him closer by the hips, pressing their torsos flat together and claiming his lips in another bruising kiss. The intensity led Draco to see stars, and when Harry began thrusting his hips slightly so that he was grinding against him, he moaned. Forgetting all about his previous worries, Draco moved his hips to match Harry’s and hungrily captured any moans escaping the other’s lips with his own.
Harry inhales some of his drink and coughs violently. “What??” he says once he’s recovered somewhat.
It was clear that he thought Draco personally at fault for the family members he had lost in the final battle. The blonde couldn't blame him. It
They sat in a companionable silence for the most part. Granger had asked for his opinion on one of the more ambiguous runes once, but had kept to her own task otherwise. But Draco was stuck, the sentence in front of him made no sense.
“We’re still meeting Monday for theory lessons, right?” asked Harry as he charmed the cauldron clean. Draco only nodded, too focussed on keeping his body from reaching out to touch Harry.
It took a few minutes for Draco to stop crying but when he did Pansy asked him again to tell her what had happened. Desperately clinging to his composure, he told her the gist of it. His admission was followed by a few moments of enraged silence before Pansy had collected herself enough to command him to strip his shirt and let her check for damage.
Draco could feel himself getting close to the edge but he wanted to feel Harry come undone before him. “Touch yourself,” he moaned, desperation making his request less demanding than intended, but Harry complied nonetheless. The sight of Harry on top of him, fisting his hand over his own cock would be seared into his mind forever..
“Alright, in that case I’ll give you a small run down of what mind healing can look like. Within magical mind healing there are several different fields specialising on different aspects or illnesses. The starkest difference is that there are so called ‘invasive’ and ‘non invasive’ fields of expertise, which differ in their used tools and methods as well as application of course. If you’re lucky, you’ll never have to really deal with the invasive specialists. They’re the only one’s sanctioned to use ‘invasive’ methods like legilimency, hence their name, and mostly deal with extensive curse damage or trapped minds.
Reassured, Draco sunk back into her embrace, he didn’t have the mental strength to deal with the Great Hall on top of everything else. Still he felt guilty. He had seen the pride in Pansy’s eyes whenever he had joined her for meals in the Great Hall and completely skipping dinner just felt like giving up.
“That’s assault! No worse, that’s a hate crime!” Hermione talked herself into a rage. “You need to talk to someone about that! You should tell McGonagall or I could talk to Kingsley if you want, but you can’t let this go on! You have what? 18 months left on probation? And you were just gonna suck it up and let him abuse you??” She stared incredulously at him.
At her mention he looked to the two students sitting to his right. They were working on the same parchment and sat pretty close to each other, completely oblivious to their surroundings. While he looked, Blaise gently nudged the small Hufflepuff with his shoulder, making her giggle. The gesture seemed oddly intimate. When had those two become so close? And hadn’t Pansy mentioned something about Hannah spending a lot of time with Longbottom?
Harry feels his cheeks heat up, feeling as though Chris had caught him staring at the retreating blond. “Uhm… yeah. We went to school together.”
Friday evening saw Harry as a bundle of nerves. He had spent the day replaying the way Draco had looked at him during potions as well as fantasizing about kissing him. Harry was pretty sure Draco couldn’t have heard him or known what he smelt in potions class, and so Harry had settled on ignoring the whole matter for the duration of the Patronus lesson. He would figure something out over the weekend.
Malfoy catches him twice more, choking him lightly and telling him the way out a moment later. Harry is fully hard when he frees himself from yet another choke hold, but Malfoy is too slow to get up this time and Harry uses the moment to catch Malfoy in his own choke hold. He reaches around the pale neck, grabs the thick collar of Malfoy’s
Without bothering to look at Draco once more, Morgon Morris left his office, leaving the still panting student behind.
So as a result, Draco had spent the better part of charms staring at Harry’s back and thinking back on their previous evening. Only when Harry stopped at his desk, asking if he was ready to go, did he get up and leave the classroom.
After Draco had eaten the last of the pumpkin bake, Pansy gingerly searched the pockets of her robes again and pulled another albeit shrunken plate out of it. She unshrunk it and vanished the protective bubble around it. A rather big piece of chocolate cake was revealed and unceremoniously handed to Draco, who stared at Pansy in disbelief. Moments later disbelief turned into suspicion, “Is this to bribe me to go to the party tonight?”
Harry closed his mouth at that, unsure of how to respond; that was certainly not what he had expected. “oh….uhm… o..Okay,” he finally stumbled out.  And out of utter confusion he added “Good night then,” before once again turning his back to try to sleep.
After a while the begging arose again, “Draco. Please. Please. I’m ready. PLEASE!” but Draco made no move to remove his fingers from Harry’s arse. Frustrated, Harry pushed Draco into the sofa, forcing him to pull his fingers out. Without any great preamble, Harry grabbed Draco’s cock, conjured more lube, and lowered himself onto it, moaning loudly. Draco threw his head back, moaning loudly as well , as the stimulation and the change of position hit him. Hands reached towards hips and he grabbed Harry as he tried to refrain from bucking up into him.
Forcing himself to be still, Harry leaned against one of the tables and used the opportunity presented to him to study Draco’s face in detail; the perfectly shaped eyebrows, the straight nose and the pointy chin. A small smile spread across the pale face just as Harry imagined what it would feel like to run his hands through the fine blond hair that framed the face. With his attention drawn to the lips, Harry's thoughts circled back to the image of kissing him.
Instantly Harry blushed and hastily backpedalled. “I mean, only if you want. I just thought- You didn’t seem to mind- I didn’t- I- Forget it.” By the time his stuttering came to a halt, he was beet red.
His planning of course had nothing to do with the fact that they were truly alone in the Room of Requirement and that he hoped for another chance to touch Harry. He had spent the whole weekend  thinking about Harry, about his missed chance at carding his hands through that messy hair. During meal times and whenever they had both been in the common room, Draco had watched Harry intently, trying to discern his relationship to any of the guys in their year. But he had only seen him talk to Blaise and Neville a few times.
Harry woke to water in his face and a throbbing feeling in his arm. Reflexively he grabbed his wand from under his pillow and pointed at the attacker. Moments later he recognized his attacker to be none other than his unfortunate bed mate. “What the hell Malfoy?” he sputtered, looking around to see it was still dark outside.
While it is unclear if Mister Malfoy also abided wizarding customs by properly courting his betrothed, it is clear that both wizards are very happy with each other, as visible on the picture on the right.
With the potions portion of the day dealt with, Draco found himself looking for excuses to continue talking to Harry. “How did you like your holidays?” he asked, feeling stupid. That feeling quickly disappeared when Harry’s face lit up.
“Could you please call me Harry? We’ll be stuck with each other for a few more weeks at least and...” Harry hesitated “it just seems silly to be close enough to come out to each other and still stick with last names. Plus the whole bed-issue…” He didn’t finish that thought, just gestured between the both of them.
Draco found himself following her into the office space adjacent to the classroom, settling into the armchair across from her desk. Moments later there was a cup of tea and some biscuits in front of him. He nibbled on one, trying to ignore the silence and the stern eyes watching him.
Clutching the strap of his book bag tighter, he moved to sit with Ron at their usual table. While he waited for the lesson to start, Harry placed his head on his arms, closing his eyes. The smoke always made his head hurt.
“Thank you for yesterday.” Draco said, hoping he had conveyed his gratitude in a way Potter understood. He allowed himself to linger a second longer and let his hand fall from Harry’s.
When they had rounded the third corner, the tears had finally stopped falling. After the fifth corner Draco found it in himself to speak up.
Their second kiss was almost better than the first one; less sweet and more open. Harry could see himself getting addicted to kissing Draco, it felt heavenly.
His heart beating faster, Harry ditched Ron and Hermione with the excuse of needing a piss and ducked into the closest bathroom. Safely ensconced in one of the cubicles, he pulled out the wrinkled parchment Draco had just shoved into his bag.
“I consent.” Blaise said and Draco lifted himself out of his armchair. The few steps towards Blaise he reminded himself that he was doing this for Potter, that he owed Potter his life. He reached the couch and expected Blaise to stand up and meet him.
When Harry slipped into bed that evening, Draco sent him a little smile before wordlessly dimming his Lumos. They bade each other good night and Harry slipped into a dream without much trouble.
“Welcome to Starlight and Moonshine. What drinks may I offer you?”, she said, handing them both a drink menu.
Hermione cornered them a week after they had officially gotten together. 10 days if one counted their first sober kiss. During the study group she just casually plonked herself down at their small table and swiftly cast a muffliato.
On Friday morning Harry woke with the certainty that he had gone and fallen for his former nemesis without realising it.
Neither of them knew how long they kissed, only that they were both breathless and slightly dizzy when they finally pulled apart. Draco lifted his right hand from Harry’s chest and gently traced his cheek, before softly cupping it. He pulled Harry in for another kiss, almost chaste compared to the previous one and cast the incantation again, lips moving against Harry’s. Harry could feel the magic leaving Draco’s wand and, without looking, was certain that he did it, that Draco had managed a corporeal Patronus.
Apparently ignoring the implication that he would almost certainly make simple mistakes, Harry began assembling the ingredients.
“I´m not worried about the food. If the wine selection is anything to go by, the food will be adequate enough. Doesn´t answer my question though. Where are we? Why don´t I know this place?”
Pansy Parkinson shot Malfoy a meaningful look when she passed them and once they were alone Malfoy adressed Harry, “Does the offer still stand?” He asked reluctantly, looking at his shoes.
“It’s not that bad. Snape was able to  heal most of them in time so that you can only see faint traces if you know where to look.” Draco tried his best to reassure.
It's happening !! IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING! It only took 42k words to get here, but we ARRIVED! Please tell me you are as excited as I am.
Kissing Harry still felt like it had back in December, when he had been tipsy and Harry had been positively drunk. It was warm, electrifying and intoxicating. Only now there was the added bonus of knowing that it wasn’t some drunk dare, that this was genuine and that this could lead to something, that there was a ‘them’, and it made his insides flutter with excitement.
“Okay then, have a lovely day. Draco, Harry” and David was gone again. They got up and left the café.
He wouldn’t have to sit through another 15 instances of being interrogated, insulted or assaulted. He was free. Or at least he felt free. Meeting with Professor McGonagall didn’t seem impossible, it didn’t even seem bad. Hadn’t he started confiding in her weeks ago?
The confusion only multiplied itself and Draco couldn’t stop himself from asking, “Show them to me?”
It had been a surprise for most of the students that McGonagall had continued teaching transfiguration despite her headmistress duties. While she didn’t teach all years anymore, she still taught NEWT level classes until the new professor had settled into their new job fully.
. With his eyes still firmly trained on the edge of the desk in front of him he said, “I’ve been keeping out of trouble. Nothing has happened that is worth reporting.”
He tried to reassure Malfoy, telling him that it’s okay but the shaking didn’t subside. Hesitantly Harry placed his hand on Malfoys shoulder, awkwardly petting it. Instead of recoiling from the touch, Malfoy leaned in to it, so Harry wrapped his arms around the crying man and simply held him.
Realizing the extent at which his touch affected Draco, Harry nudged his shoulder again and said, “Okay budge over, the more contact you get the faster you heal. Plus I’d like to sleep for a few more hours and this chair just isn’t it.”
“Do you have any plans today? I was thinking, since we rainchecked our dinner yesterday, may I take you out to breakfast instead?” Sitting on the bed still looking rather sleepy, Harry nodded his head, “I would like that” he said with a shy smile.
Draco’s hand stopped petting Harry’s head. “You want to go public?” he asked in shock. “Tell everyone and just… deal with whatever the press comes up with?”
Pansy was true to her word, when Draco reached the study table in the common room there were only 4 people present. Pansy, Granger and Hannah Abbott he had expected, Blaise however was a surprise and a pleasant one at that. He would at least treat him well enough and while they weren't considered close anymore, they had been at one point.
This might be the first Monday where I am not uploading shortly after midnight. But it is technically not even that late in the afternoon, so here is another chapter. As I mentioned, my wonderful beta was on an editing spree the past few days so expect another chapter sometime this week.
“That’s not what I meant! You carried yourself with confidence again, you looked ambitious again, rather than just silently suffering. There was a spark in you. I missed seeing you like that.” Pansy sounded wistful.
Now they lay side by side on the fluffy carpet in the Room of Requirement, Harry’s head on Draco’s stomach and Draco’s hand carding through Harry’s hair. Despite the unruly look of it, it was surprisingly soft and Draco had discovered it to be rather calming to run his hands through it. The cookies lay on a tray next to them.
Granger interrupted him, “It makes no sense! Ashwinder eggs are highly reactive when added to a potion below a roaring simmer, yet it specifically says to add the eggs before the potion can reach room temperature!”
Or so he kept telling himself with each step towards his room. When he was two feet away from the door, he couldn’t ignore reality any longer. Things could have been worse, but rooming with Draco Malfoy of all people definitely wasn’t ideal. Damn McGonagall for choosing the roommates and damn McGonagall for refusing to let Harry switch rooms; He had asked.
It had been 10 days since he last saw Harry and his initial worry had changed into him often sporting a rather uncomfortable erection. “Damn you Potter” he grumbled continuing to wipe the counter with more force than was strictly necessary.
“Harry, look at me.” he orders and Harry does. He looks into the grey eyes, almost black with lust, and sees the urgency, the pleading. “We need to talk about this. I won’t choke you - won’t touch you - if I don’t know for sure that you want this.”
A small cobblestone path led to the entrance of the little sanctuary Harry had booked for the next week, surrounded by evergreen bushes and leafless trees. Shouldering his bag, he entered the little stone cottage and looked through the rooms. There was a small kitchen, not even big enough to contain a real table, a bedroom containing a double bed and small dresser, and a bathroom. The largest room was undoubtedly the living room, with its rather disproportionate fireplace and huge windows.
“You know, if you really want to come out, you could do a test run with the study group. You know they are not homophobic and most of them must be suspecting it anyways after the Never have I ever game.”
It had been an uneventful Tuesday until he saw Potter just before he entered the shop. He was alone this time and Draco commented on his missing side kick once the Gryffindor had reached the counter.
It had been a shock to realise how fundamentally his opinion of his father had changed and the comparison still hurt.
Harry headed for the kitchen, hoping to be alone with his thoughts for a moment. After a moment, he took out some flour and yeast and started making bread; the kneading helping him find clarity in his mind.
Without a second thought, Harry laid down next to Draco, their shoulders and arms touching. The hospital bed was a bit small for both of them to lay on their backs and Draco felt so good lying next to Harry, that he could only keep up his farce for a few seconds. He turned on his side, facing away from Harry and mumbled, “Fine, have your cuddles then.”
Memory-Pansy said in his mind and Draco corrected his assessment. He wasn’t a coward. He was trying.
We’re only at chapter 4 and Harry Potter has already made an entrance. Although he doesn’t really do much, but he is THERE! He might even get a personality in future chapters?!
He settled onto a couch in the common room, book in hand. From his position he could see the entrance of the common room as well as the hall connecting the dorms. Two pages into his book he got ambushed by a very angry Pansy.
Nodding, Draco thought about the advice. “I catch myself still thinking like them sometimes.” The admission burned his throat, but McGonagall didn’t interrupt him. “I know my father isn’t a good person. I think I knew that for quite some time. But… He is still my father.”
The sound of someone entering the room let Draco flinch and hurry to cover himself. He was acutely aware of his bare forearms as he hastily pulled his t-shirt over his head.
For a few moments he considered just relishing in the warmth of the sleeping body in his arms and maybe drifting back to sleep until the situation set in. He was in the Room of Requirements, cuddling Harry Potter after having, for the lack of a better phrasing,
“I see the way your behaviour has changed in the past weeks. I see the way you interact with your classmates and especially Miss Granger nowadays. What a coincidence that the moment you are free to renounce the views of your parents, the moment you are free of your parents to be frank, you become friends with someone you were previously not allowed to be friends with. It took me a moment to see it to be quite honest with you, but I don’t believe your ideals to be harmful, although they might be a tad ignorant.”
The familiar gesture helped Draco to calm down, and after a few minutes his sobbing turned into sniffing and his breathing became a bit more regular.
“Let me at least get Hermione to look over it? She must know some diagnostic charms”. Pansy all but pleaded with him. Draco relented.
Draco shot her a grateful smile and nodded, “Yes please. I think I managed to translate the first five sentences but I am not really sure of the fourth one. After that I am lost as well.” They got to work.
“In that case not being set on the idea might actually help you.” Leah laughed. “I would recommend you talk to Toby, he is our cover-up specialist. He should be here in about 15 minutes. Do you want to wait for him or do you want to schedule an appointment?”
“When it gets to my arms and legs it almost tingles, seeping into every last inch of my fingers and toes and I…I feel like I'm glowing; as if my happiness is seeping from every pore out into the world without really leaving me. And then I just…” Harry grabbed his wand and gently cast, “Expecto Patronum.”
Harry shrugged and turned back to cuddle closer to Draco once more, mumbling, “It was long overdue.” before hiding his face in Draco’s shirt once more. Cherishing the feeling of Harry in his arms, Draco relaxed into the couch.
“Uhm Professor?” Hermione was clearly hesitant, eyeing Pansy and Draco carefully, “Would it be possible for you to get those details off of Pansy instead of Draco? She knows most of it, if not all, and it would spare Draco from having to revisit those memories.”
It was indeed morning according to the Tempus Draco cast, and breakfast would start in a few minutes . Pansy and Hermione would probably be waiting for him and after the rather sparse dinner due to nerves the night before, he actually felt hungry.
For the first time, I don't think that there are any real trigger warnings for this chapter (if I'm wrong TELL ME!!), so I guess it is safe to say that things are looking up?
Draco was about to speak up again when Hermione chimed in. “We were really surprised how you opened up. In a good way, and we thought we could maybe try to gently force you a bit into a… new step towards normalcy?”
When they entered his flat Draco led Harry over to the couch in his living room then went to set the kettle on the stove to make some tea. When the tea was done, he pushed the warm mug into Harry’s hands and set some scones on the living room table before he joined Harry on the couch. He grabbed a scone and offered the second one to Harry who silently took it.
“That wasn’t too bad now, was it?” she asked the moment they entered his dorm. Draco could only hum in agreement, not really being over the shock of apparently being friendly enough that Granger —
Draco realized he was staring and cleared his throat. “Hello Potter. What brings you to my little shop?” he asked, trying to be his usual customer service self.
Draco thanked her and focussed on Luna. He had already had this talk with her, although via owl. Luna had been one of the few who had actually responded to his owl and they had spent a few weeks clearing the air.
Draco lay in bed, unable to sleep. The events of the past few hours still racing through his head, keeping him awake. The study session had been surprisingly fun, he had forgotten how exhilarating a good academic discussion could be.
As Pansy had promised, Hermione brought them some food and Draco invited her to stay, which she gladly did. Sitting on the chair in front of Draco’s bed, while Draco and Pansy ate, she observed Draco carefully. There was a furrow in between her brows, which Draco didn’t notice.
What felt like hours later, the two pulled apart, desperately gasping for air. Harry leaned his head onto Draco’s shoulder, his legs still bracketing Draco’s, while Draco had his hands resting lightly on his waist. They just sat there, relishing in the bliss of the rather fantastic snog they just shared.
Just outside Draco reached for Harry’s hand again, “I like you too... More than. I didn’t get to-” he was quite suddenly cut off when Harry pulled him closer and leaned in to kiss him.
My love and gratitude once again for my most wonderful beta Monika. Honestly, without her I would have never finished writing this
“Who said anything about being drunk?” retorted Harry as he put his wand back onto table, hoping that his smugness hid the underlying nervousness. Draco’s eyes skimmed across him, assessing him. A few moments later he got off the couch, slowly walking towards Harry, “Tell me then. How far have you gone Potter?” He came closer and his voice was sultry and low, smooth like velvet, “How much of your little fantasy is just that — a fantasy?” Another step closer. “Have you touched yourself to the idea of impaling yourself on my cock?” Closer. “Played with your hole, imagining it was me stretching you wide open?”
Harry felt his face grow hotter, “Just because I haven’t done it before, doesn’t mean I don’t want to.”
“SPILL!. Who was it?” Weasley prompted immediately, clearly remembering the ‘If you drink alone you have to spill’-rule.
With the sudden realisation of their position came the awareness that he was hard. It took all his willpower to break the kiss, unwilling to rush into what must be Harry’s first exploration with gay sex. Panting slightly, Draco warned, “If you… don’t want this to… escalate I’d… suggest we stop.”
“No need to get ahead of yourself. We might be done with discussing the limits, but you had some liquor tonight and playing under the influence isn’t safe. Especially choking.” Even though Draco’s tone starts off playful, it turns stern halfway through. He slips off of Harry’s lap, pulling the other man up with him, and leads them away from the sofa.
“That is mostly my hand and sometimes my foot too, and only if I want to keep lying on the floor. The impact energy has to go somewhere and so I let it go into the floor. Look.”
Tears were once again threatening to fall and Draco merely nodded in gratitude. An uncomfortable silence lay between them and Draco could feel Potter's eyes on him, while he held onto the last instances of self control he had.
“That's why you’ve been avoiding me??” Pansy sounded outraged. Swiftly she turned him around. “Draco, I want to be your friend, not your bloody lover or wife!” Her eyes showed how hurt she was by his distance. Merlin, how he'd missed her in the last weeks.
Time was hard to tell within the Room of Requirement but based on just how rested Draco felt, he thought it might be morning or sometime after breakfast even — he hadn’t been this rested in months.
Pansy revelled in seeing her best friend smiling again, and when Draco had laughed — actually laughed — the other day, her heart gave a little tug. It was good to be able to hear that sound again.
Confused, Draco looked around for any hint of the time. Guessing his confusion Harry continued, “Sometime early morning on boxing day. I came in just after dinner yesterday.”
It wasn’t as if Draco had no appetite or hunger, he was just afraid of what would happen if he sat down at that table; afraid of the students, afraid of their words, afraid of their actions.
Finally allowing himself solace in his mothers touch, Draco leaned back into her hand, concentrating on sorting through his jumbled emotions, focussing on calming and breathing.
A moan escaped Harry’s lips and he was acutely aware of his throbbing cock when he nodded ever so slightly in answer to Draco’s question. Even if he had wanted to answer verbally, he lost the ability when Draco straddled him. Soft hair tickled his collarbone when Draco leaned down to murmur into his ear, “Maybe even charmed a dildo to fuck into you?”
“Granger? I doubt she wants me to go anywhere near her let alone sit down to have a chat with her!” he hissed. He didn’t miss the triumphant smirk playing across Pansy’s face when she answered, “I’ve actually already talked to her about that and she would appreciate your help.”
The Room of Requirement was thankfully void of any pink or frilly hearts. Some of the seventh years had thought it necessary to decorate the castle for Valentines day, and Draco had taken one look at the small glittery hearts falling from the ceiling in the Great Hall before quickly turning around and leaving.
And lastly 6. If you drink alone you have to spill. Meaning: If you are the only one to drink at a statement and someone asks for details? You have to tell. All within reason of course. Questions?”
Also this time there is no real new triggering mention. If you made it this far into the story you are definitely not triggered by references to disordered eating and a shitty homelife. Although there is a mention of Sirius being dead.
Draco sat on his bed, pulling his legs to his chest. “I… can’t. Not with everyone there. I tried to go yesterday, really I tried. Only made it halfway there…” he buried his face in his knees.
Pansy accepts his outbreak with a sad look in her eyes and then simply catches him up on the latest gossip while he eats.
They stood in the middle of the market for a few more seconds, faces alight with giddy smiles, arms still around each other, before Harry gently pulled from the embrace. He caught Draco’s hand in his and together they continued browsing the market, sneaking glances at each other every now and then.
“Just remembered my next parole meeting. Don’t worry about it.” he dismissed, before quickly trying to distract her, “Any particular reason you haven’t nagged me to accompany you to Hogsmeade yet?”
He pulled his pajamas out of his trunk and grabbed his toothbrush before heading to the bathroom to get ready for the night. When he came back into the room, he saw that Malfoy had also changed into pajamas but showed no other indication of going to sleep as he sat on top of the covers still reading.
Not wanting to deal with any of the hate he was sure to receive in a wizarding establishment, Draco opted to visit a muggle hairstylist, once again unbelievably grateful that his muggle study tutor had insisted on visiting the closest town with him last summer. It must have been a bureaucratic horror to get the permission back then, when he was still on house arrest.
By the end of the lesson almost everyone had been able to produce some form of silver mist, except for Malfoy, and Harry had noticed. And as Malfoy passed him on his way out, Harry unthinkingly grabbed his wrist and said, “I can help you.”
Draco motioned for her to elaborate, while unwrapping the first sandwich. Pansy stepped a few steps back and leaned against a bedpost, “We need your help with the potions assignment, it just won’t work and I know you finished that damn thing already”
“Pleasure to meet you.” Draco said reflexively, bowing slightly during their handshake. At Professor McGonagall’s cue they settled into the small sitting area in front of the fireplace.
Harry felt himself blush too. “Uhm… yeah.” he admitted hesitantly. To his surprise Draco started laughing.
that. It wouldn't be pleasant, but still far better than Azkaban. After all, returning to the Manor couldn't make his nightmares more terrifying.
Despite his calming words it was Draco, who grabbed Harry by the hand and almost dragged him from their rooms. McGonagall had given them the shrunken, transformed and renovated former eighth year common room and dorms,and both were rather excited at being back at the place where their romance began.
“I think it is important to integrate some of the concepts of structured education into the curriculum and have the students discover interdisciplinary connections due to joined lessons or overlapping curricula.” stated Mister Potter.
Draco fidgeted with the strap of his bag until he became aware that all eyes were on him. “Uhm.. I need to talk to you about my parole meetings.” he opened, all courage leaving him instantly. Desperate, he turned to Pansy standing slightly behind him.
They had seen maybe half of the stands when Draco turned to Harry, “Thank you for coming with me. This is wonderful.” He said, smiling so warmly at Harry that the dark haired man felt his heart clench.
“Thank you Mal-… Draco. I accept your apology.” Hermione answered, only stumbling slightly at the use of his given name. Draco felt all the air leave his body, his head dizzy. He had never hoped to hear those words from her mouth.
“Now now Mr. Malfoy. As you said, he is still your father and from what I gathered he played a big part in your childhood. It is only normal that you love him, no matter the person he turned out to be.”
Laughter escaped Draco. Harry had once again done the impossible and turned a potential catastrophe into a minor inconvenience.
“What about preparation methods for dry ingredients?” The questioning look in Potter's face was all the answer Draco needed. “Nothing at all?” he asked and watched in astonishment as Potter appeared to blush a little.
“Ah Draco, right on time.” said Professor McGonagall, motioning for him to step in. “Draco, this is Healer Gemma Hayes, she specialises in non-invasive mind healing.”
“You can. Though the moment it becomes too much we’ll go back to the dorm, okay?” She gently pressed his shoulder and they kept going, joining Hermione who had waited a few steps ahead.
His thoughts drifted off and he absentmindedly continued eating his porridge. He nearly spat it out again when he remembered the early stages of the morning, remembered cuddling into warmth and imagining arms embracing him. What if he hadn’t imagined it? What if Malfoy had had his arms around Harry?
Despite being resolute in conquering his fear of his classmates, it took him nearly a week before he managed to actually act on it. He had eased himself into the task by spending some free time in the common room reading a book, instead of his bedroom on the weekend. But as it was a Hogsmead weekend it didn’t really count, there had been no students present.
After they had left, Draco’s day continued as normal. When he had closed up for the day and started cleaning he couldn’t reign his mind in anymore. The resemblance between Potter and the man in his dream was disturbing. He couldn’t deny it: Potter was attractive and coincidentally exactly Draco’s type. He could only hope that Potter would return.
Once he heard the whistling of his kettle he went back and prepared his favourite black tea in one of his thermos’. He quickly changed into his white trousers and shirt and pulled a pair of black jeans and a grey button down out of his closet, carefully putting them into his backpack. He grabbed his tea and a coat and was on his way.
“You didn’t.” Draco had never heard Potter talk this gently. “It’s not your fault. You didn’t cast the Fiendfyre, you nearly didn’t survive it yourself. It was war and Crabbe was one of its victims. It’s not your fault.”
Halfway up the staircase Draco collapsed and started crying. He didn’t know whether they were tears of anger, frustration or simply due to the excruciating pain, all he knew was that he was crying on the stairs and had no way to change that.
He carefully packed his presents away and slid back into bed, hoping that sleep would help with his terrible headache.
There was a slight confusion around the circle, people were waiting to see if they would be compelled to drink, while Draco, Pansy, Blaise and Neville had downed their shots already. In the end only Hannah, Hermione, Luna and Weasley also had to drink. Draco considered it a successful turn nonetheless, his mind beginning to slightly lull as the consumed alcohol hit his bloodstream. He felt himself gradually relax.
Pulling his mind back from the unpleasant route his thoughts were taking, Draco became aware of his surroundings again. The pair of them were still sitting on the floor where Draco had crumpled.
