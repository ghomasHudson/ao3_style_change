“So what if I did,” Harry replies childishly, crossing his arms and daring Malfoy to say anything.
Draco opens his eyes, and looks at him in a long and searching way. Their faces are so close that he can see Draco’s pale eyelashes, the intricacies of the bruises on his cheek, just how pink his lips are. “If you don’t want me to kiss you right now, you should leave.”
The shadow of fear on his shoulder quivered at the touches but Draco kept his head up and let the vines pass through his fingers. He felt from the forest a pervasive good will, a quiet promise that she was going to protect him. He couldn’t explain why he was so certain, except that he was not the wrongest thing in the forest and that alone was comforting.
“I have lost months, maybe years off my life this morning alone,” Draco says morosely, taking a gulp of tea. “Should we be pretending to date? Will that throw them off the trail? I hate this, this is not my job. Your job is bad, Potter, and I loathe it.”
“Come sit!” A pink haired girl grabs him by the hand, pulling him onto the wood floor next to her with a grin. “I’m Emma by the way.”
Harry is pretty sure Malfoy doesn’t want him to stay, but he doesn’t want to deal with the rain so he lingers at the counter for a moment. “I’ll just wait here, if that’s fine?”
“Fine,” Draco said. “But you still can’t tell people it’s my favorite color.”
It’s still raining outside in a regular little drizzle that makes overlapping patterns in the puddles. Draco tells him his address, yawning as he takes Harry’s arm. They swirl through space with a crack and then land in another rainy part of London, one of the quieter offshoots of Diagon Alley next to a dark line of shops with the occasional warmly lit second floor.
“Rosemary’s art piece?” Hermione prompted, staring up at the blue and yellow yarn in bemusement. “I’m not really sure what’s she’s trying to accomplish but Luna and some of the girls seem quite excited about it.”
Draco tenses underneath him. Harry holds onto his waist and looks up to see him working around lies he can’t bring himself to say, like discs of metal in the mouth.
Harry realizes with horror that as long as Draco is looking peaky and odd at his dining table, Harry should probably be trying to make polite conversation with him. Harry ends up asking him what potions he has brewing and they get embroiled in a debate about whether or not Harry would be bad at potions if Snape hadn’t been their potions professor. Harry cites decent grades in his other classes and his stellar performance under Slughorn’s tutelage, which Draco doesn’t need to know can be traced directly to the Half-Blood Prince’s Textbook. Draco dismisses this entirely on the merits that Slughorn showed Harry undue favoritism, which Harry thinks is a little rich considering how much Snape favored Draco. Draco is arguing that Harry’s negligible talents (risk taking, sheer power, and bullheadedness) are entirely unsuited to potions which requires intuition, rule following, and attention to detail, when Harry realizes that he’s on his way to being late for work and hustles Draco back through the Floo, still constructing his final argument.
Harry sighed into the blankets, almost crawling underneath them just so he could hide better. “I couldn’t... I couldn’t feel anything? And now I’m feeling things but they’re not the things I want to feel.”
“Potter,” Draco says. Frankly, he thinks he should be congratulated for not just throwing caution to the wind and moaning Harry’s first name into his ear as their first time ever addressing each other as such. “All our friends know we’re fucking. They definitely— They definitely know we’re fucking and we’re never going to live it down.”
In dreams:
“Pity you didn’t stay that way,” Draco replied, holding on tighter still, like he was thinking about lashing out. Harry considered reaching for his wand, but despite all of Draco’s blustering he didn’t feel all that afraid. Even at Draco’s most desperate he still couldn’t bring himself to hurt.
Draco finishes his champagne and starts the slow trek out to the porch. He deserves a ten minute break.
Dara rolls her eyes. “No you don’t, and this has old flame written all over it.”
“So we’re going to start with a box,” Draco said, going up to the blackboard and picking up a piece of chalk. “You could visualize it, but I truly don’t think we’re past chalk outline.”
Harry’s feet squished in the mud and he worried briefly that he’d get stuck in the mire, only the steady slosh of the mangrove roots as he passed giving him any kind of reassurance. He stopped to take off his shirt and trousers, laying them across a low hanging branch, resigning himself to wading in just his pants. While he knew his way around a drying charm, he didn’t fancy the feeling of wet pajamas on his skin.
“Oh,” Harry says. “You’re asking for my help?”
“You tell me, it was just a guess,” Harry says, setting his wand in the chair next to him and waiting for Draco to cast.
“Yes, yes, I was a little dead,” Harry says, aiming for ‘affable,’ and judging by Dara’s face, ending up far closer to ‘irritable.’ “We’re actually here to ask about your neighbor Rob. We heard you had some complaints regarding his toads.”
Draco spent that first forestless day in a fog and Harry spent it lost in a mist. It was a gloomy sort of mist that he was doing his best to hide behind a chipper expression. Harry had slept, which was something, but Draco had completely avoided looking at him over breakfast, oblivious to the stares Harry sent him all morning.
I’m a little worried about you. I know the Prophet really doesn’t do much to try and get your good side, but those pictures of you stumbling home were not your best look.
at him. Maybe probing at is the verb. Potter is too close for his face to be turned towards Draco. “If too many things are happening I don’t really know what to do like, my senses can’t handle it.” There’s a silence that Draco’s mind fills with a million irritated question marks. “Side effect of dying for a bit I guess.”
“When was the last time you did your dishes?” Hermione asks, tapping her foot on the tile as she appraises the pile of plates near the sink.
She whirls. “You’ve got it?”
Luna looks appropriately sympathetic, which does make Harry feel a little better, despite the fact that he’s not entirely sure how she’ll react when she figures out who he’s talking about. “And does your mystery person feel the same?”
Harry groans. “And the picture, Merlin. It looked like we were...” Harry trails off, taking a bite so he doesn’t have to finish the sentence.
“Do you want, I can-” Harry rushed over to the desk, pulling out a bundle of tissues from the tissue box and running back over to present them to Draco, who was still staring out at the snow.
Although Draco didn’t see any animals in the forest, an irregular rustling followed him in the undergrowth and he felt a mumbling sort of sentience beyond even that. The forest smelled like fruit left in the sun, like sweat, like the slow turning of the seasons, like cutting something open for the first time.
Harry splutters for a moment, wishing they could go back to when Malfoy was pretending all of this was normal.
Draco is looking at him like he can’t figure out if he should be making fun of him or not. Harry thinks if Draco did make fun of him, he would quite deserve it. “Quite normal,” Draco says finally. He opens his mouth again like he’s going to say ‘Harry,’ then seems to think better of it.
“But forever?” Harry replies, because Draco settled down somewhere quaint is a surprise.
- Magic of the Old World, Cassandra Sprat
“Hey,” Harry says. He doesn’t seem to know what to do with his hands. Once Draco notices this, it occurs to him that he has no idea what to do with his hands either.
“More small blessings,” Ron added, crumpling a piece of parchment and throwing it in the vague direction of the trashcan.
“Hand jobs are a game and I’m winning,” Draco says, which makes Harry laugh.
“Is it Malfoy? The daddy issues?”
Draco looks shifty, and Harry has the feeling that talking about his feelings is just as difficult for him as it is for Harry. “I’m still figuring out how to be a good person. It’s very strange, living with the fear that you’re going to slip back into that, that if you’re too cruel you’ll be awful again. It’s difficult when witticisms are your only emotional defense.”
It’s not a real choice, safety or staying. It’s not a real choice but sometimes Harry wishes Draco had made it, just so someone would.
He’d never thought of himself as overly good looking but Draco wanting to kiss him couldn’t be anything but aesthetic, nothing else made sense. Maybe Malfoy would have been into how fucked up it was, the feeling that they were doing something forbidden. Harry was, a little bit.
“I’m not a girl Potter, don’t get yourself confused,” Draco says tiredly, blending the  shimmer on his upper eyelids.
“That’s a lovely mint, Anthony, great choice,” Harry told him as they waltzed around the room, nearly bumping into Neville and Hannah in the process.
“Sorry, I didn’t realize your fancy dance school was such a big secret,” Harry replied feeling a bit annoyed at being arranged like a doll. “Afraid I’ll go get myself some lessons and usurp you as queen dance bitch?”
“That you’re a swot,” Harry says.
“Gotcha,” Harry replied, giving him her best supportive smile.
Hermione’s gaze went both gentle and sharp at the same time. “You’re still not sleeping?” It was sympathetic but somehow disbelieving, like he should have been better by then, like his healing could be as meticulously scheduled and color coded as her life. Highlighted in blue, two months in: ‘can sleep through the night.’ Highlighted in pink, three months in: ‘doesn’t say weird things about the war anymore.’ Highlighted in yellow, four months in: ‘is Harry in the way we expect him to be.’
“I did think maybe it would be Pansy, but,” she shrugs delicately, apparently satisfied. “He’s much better than some of the other boys.”
Harry steels himself against the jostle of the Floo Network, stumbling out into the living room and calling out a hello. There’s a brief clattering of pans and a “Hello Harry!” from the kitchen that’s most likely Luna.
“Nothing,” Malfoy responds. “We didn’t have to fix anything.”
“Pink is just a good color,” Draco said, her voice dropping like she was telling a secret. “Thanks.”
“I know,” Ron replied. “All you can really do.” Harry could feel the affection in his voice thick as the air in the forest, the quiet camaraderie that still tied them close. “Wanna go do something?”
There are hollers of assent and then they’re smashing through the doors and tearing across the atrium which, as could be predicted, is absolute pandemonium. Harry nearly takes out a wizard carrying a merrily smoking potion and stops only to help Dara up after she jumps over a small end table and crashes into two other harried looking employees like they’re bowling pins. The ominous warning message is blaring on repeat, only adding to the panicked cacophony of the large, echoey room.
5. Seventeen snitches in Hogwarts history have flown into the Forbidden Forest instead of staying on the playing field.
“The hand game,” Ron says slowly. “Fire, water, blood, you know?”
Dara sighs and looks up at the ceiling. Harry looks up at it too and sees that it’s boring and white, just like the rest of the room. “You know, I’m only saying this because we’re probably going to get Obliviated and forget this ever happened, but it wouldn’t kill you to actually let yourself have something you want for a change. I’ve watched you sidestep more romantic prospects than anyone, and it’s like you don’t even know you’re doing it. I used to think it was because you were still in love with Ginny, then I thought maybe you were ace or aro or something, but I don’t think that’s it. I don’t get it, dude.”
“Clearly,” Draco snips.
“Truly Hermione in top form,” Ron adds, resting a hand on the back of her neck. She looks up at him and preens, just a little.
“I like you better when you’re not trying to give me life advice,” Harry said.
Draco nods, looking, for lack of a better word, friendly. “Are you French, Jordan?”
Harry was silent, listening as her breath fogged up the glass, muffled music creeping down from the Great Hall. It felt almost like an honor, Draco telling her stories of before, like she was giving Harry a part of herself wrapped in pretty Christmas paper.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Draco.”
Draco hmphs but doesn’t press the point, so Harry digs around in his bag for his change of clothes. He knows they won’t fit Draco quite right, which he’ll probably get at least one laugh out of. “Put these on.”
“To be fair, the hospital windows aren’t the worst place to watch Quidditch from,” Harry joked, remembering the many times she’d been laid up there while the Gryffindor team played.
They walk the street in silence and it feels awkward even as Harry tries to pretend that it’s fine.
“Could you tell me where the archives are?” he asks, prompting the elderly witch at the counter to squint up at him from under a pile of gray braids speckled with delicate gold insects. When he looks at one too closely, it winks its wings at him.
11. When Voldemort died, everything was supposed to be over, but it wasn’t. Neville had said it, about snakes, that every time you cut off a head two new ones grow in its place.
Harry prodded the bruises on his neck in the bright morning light of the bathroom, his feet cold on the tiles and a terrified twisting in his stomach. He’d tried to spell them off, even resorting to stealthily sorting through the skeevy magazines under Seamus’ bed in hopes that he’d be able to find something to help.
you kiss Harry?” Hermione asks. Draco recognizes the desperate efforts of someone trying to steer the discussion far, far away from the threesome she’s definitely had with her two most beloved friends.
Draco blinks over at him, a gentle smile alighting on his face as he crawls over to Harry’s side of the couch, situating himself between Harry’s legs. He runs a hand across Harry’s jaw, watching him like he’s trying to figure him out. “You sure?”
“Of course,” Harry says. “Do it.”
“Have a biscuit,” she commands. He and Dara hesitate for a moment, but both reach for one as her glare intensifies.
“I’m sure,” Harry replies. “Thanks for coming with me. It’s easier not being alone.”
Harry watches his pale fingers as he sketches, a pattern of geometric shapes in black ink that doesn’t form anything.
“Oh yes you are,” Draco says loftily. “A veritable oddball.”
He gets an affirmative response and has to rush home to tidy up the place, knowing that he’s being obsessive even as he arranges the newspapers carefully on the couch. Draco’s already seen his flat but it feels important now, just like everything else, and he finds himself standing in front of the mirror trying to tame his stupid hair even though he knows it’s a losing game.
He opening his mouth to say something, anything, but only hitched in a breath that tripped into another until he was hyperventilating.
“Je t’en prie,” Draco says. “La famille étendue de Malfoy est française.”
There was something spicy in the air, like cinnamon and cumin and one of the smells from the lake, still warm and familiar. He wondered when Harry would come and couldn’t begin to think of what he would say to him, not after what they’d done, not after the way that Harry had triggered something soft inside him.
Harry smiles, walking over to kiss him again. Draco smiles against his mouth and his fingers find their way into his hair, messing it up like he always does. Harry tugs Draco down from the counter so he can press him against it, hands on his jaw and the small of his back, always trying to love him harder. He thinks briefly that the shop wasn’t really the safe space and that it was Draco all along, even though none of that makes sense.
Draco laughed at Harry’s expression, a delighted cackle that Harry had never heard sound so charming. “It’s just the forest, Merlin you should have seen your face.”
The undergrowth rustled as he moved and a few mouse sized creatures ran across the path. It should have been creepy, but it just felt instead like old halloween decorations left out for him to find.
“They really were impeccable crepes,” Draco says. “And I’m a snob.”
“You know I didn’t think I wanted to kiss you,” Harry replied, too fast and bungled up. It sounded like tree bark, like the dirt on the paths and Draco was briefly terrified that Harry would turn into a tree and leave him, so Draco clutched him tighter. “You’re the only thing I’ve wanted in months.”
This one had been off to such a calm and regular start, which should have been Draco’s cue that something was about to go terribly, terribly wrong. Draco had identified this as the kind of night where he’d eat all the snacks, have at least one weirdly intense conversation with Blaise, Hermione, or Luna, and be curled up in bed by midnight.
“Ron’s mum, for Christmas,” Hermione said, giving Blaise a smile. Ron looked like she couldn’t decide whether or not she wanted to focus on Hermione or Blaise, although she did grin at Hermione at the mention of Molly.
“Point,” Draco says, and presses him against the wall to kiss him soundly. Harry shivers against the chill of the tile, gasping as Draco presses their bodies together, sliding a warm thigh between Harry’s. Draco brings his mouth to Harry’s ear, sucking on his earlobe. “And it’s probably when you get a little righteous.”
She still smelled like vanilla, that warmth that Harry had begun to associate with her, and her skin shimmered just a little underneath the lights like she’d dusted herself with pixie dust.
3. Say his name over and over until it feels like the only thing you know
“Yes,” Harry says, looking quite content with himself. “You like it though.”
“Oh Harry, your face. It’s like Christmas,” she says, and Harry starts to tell her to go soak her head as the doors crash open, revealing Draco himself, wand raised and pale hair all askew. Harry has never seen him look so disheveled, his soft-looking jumper rent completely at the shoulder, revealing a long, bleeding gash that splits the pale skin beneath. He’s gotten dust all over his hands and face and has a long smear of blood across his cheek, standing tall and wild eyed in the doorway. Harry’s brain helpfully informs him that the overall effect is kinda hot.
“Hermione,” Harry said. He’d stood up at some point. Everyone watched. He almost never spoke at these things and Hermione was looking at him like she’d already decided she wouldn’t back down. He hadn’t known what to fucking say to her. He didn’t want her to back down. He’d wanted it to end. “Hermione.”
They fell asleep among the flowers in the early hours of the morning and when they woke apart at the edges of the forest the tiredness didn’t hang from their bones the way it used to. Draco recognized the feeling from the sleepovers of his youth and smiled all the way back to the Slytherin common room. Harry thought it felt a little like his first year at Hogwarts: all blurry eyed tiredness and the warm memories of friends close by.
“Hey Draco, who’s this?” He asks, his hair quiffed up high and his eyes bright blue.
Harry nods, sneaks out through the curtain, giving Belinda a goodbye and an apology as he does, even as she shakes her head fondly at him. He wonders what she thinks of all of this, if she thinks they’re high school sweethearts back together or if she has some idea that their past tangles like underbrush and scratches like thorns.
Draco turns his glare on her.
Draco signals at them, and they all steel themselves for when he throws the door of the bedroom open.
“What?” Draco asks, frowning.
Harry looks at Hermione.
Draco doesn’t stare long, merely looks around at his family. “I missed you.”
“He was a part of it before.” Narcissa says quietly. “And if I hadn’t informed him of certain things – like the Horcruxes, might I say – he would be worse off than he was.”
to go back, wants to either live to see the rest of their lives together or die knowing his love is alright, knowing he knows he loves him. Harry feels as though he hasn’t told him he loves him in so long. Draco needs to know it.
He stands up and when he passes Lupin, the professor smiles lightly at him.
Draco doesn’t try to escape.
“No, you’re not.” Snape says calmly, pushing Harry back down into the chair.
do it.” Hermione says.
“Albus,” McGonagall nods. She hasn’t told Harry much about him, other than the fact that he’s one of the most powerful wizards in the world. Harry isn’t in anyway inclined to doubt her. “Potter, this is Albus Dumbledore. Albus, this is-”
They meet Mundungus Fletcher at their usual spot – it’s really,
Draco bites into his toast.
Draco doesn’t hear the rest of his sentence. He can’t think past what Harry’s already said.
The bastard’s been training him on Occlumency – even
“That’s another thing.” Pansy agrees. “This is absolutely abysmal.”
“Well get it out of here!” She screeches.
with.
As soon as he’s gone, Harry turns to him. “Are you okay?”
In other news, I'm having a friend brakeup, so i'm sort of :'(
Draco frowns. "Well, it's just - you said we'd be trying to have kids soon, and-”
and he didn’t
“Are you alright?” Ron asks worriedly.
“When does the Dark Lord plan to kill Potter?” he asks finally.
It never brings anything good, and you can never stop it
“Seventeen.” Jae corrects.
When he encounters Greyback – leaning over Lavender Brown, whose face is scratched badly, but she’s alive – Greyback flashes bloodied teeth at him. He’d been drawn to the empty hall by the screams.
them, and he’d do anything for them, and they would for him, too.
“Mr. Williams! Mr. Franco! Mr. Caron! Mr. Lee!” She stops then, so Draco looks back to where the three Gryffindors were standing, only to find the space empty. He looks around.
“Err,” Harry says. His cheeks darken under his tanned skin. “If you’re up for it, we could continue working on your Patronus when you come back.”
Harry doesn’t know exactly what had changed. Maybe it had been one too many late nights for both of them, or how much time they spent together after they’d been paired up as dueling partners, both the top of their class. Harry had thought he’d greatly enjoy the chance to knock Draco on his arse – and he had, thoroughly – but he’d also been grudgingly respecting of the fact that Draco had been the only person to last more than two minutes dueling Harry. They’d dueled nearly an hour before Draco had slipped up.
Draco shrugs. “Everyone seemed to think so.”
“I was thinking about the whole Voldemort thing, and whatever, and do you think we could kill him like a muggle? He’s supposed to be powerful and everything, but if he doesn’t know about Muggle things we could just like – hit him in the head with one of those wooden things muggles use for balls? Or poison him? Imagine how embarrassing for him, the supposed ‘most powerful wizard’ of all Britain, dead because he slipped in the shower. Also, do you think his Death eaters have some sort of dress code or something? They’re always matching…” he trails off as he catches the way Harry’s looking at him. His whole demeanor has softened, relaxed, and he’s looking at Draco with something the blond can’t quite make out. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Yes,” Draco replies, moving so his feet are underneath him and he’s curled against the side of the couch.
He wondered if real Harry would kiss like that too and the thought made him so dizzy he pulled away, eyes nearly crossing as they came open. Harry still had his eyes squeezed shut, his face flushed and his mouth open as he panted. Draco didn’t really think about kissing him again, he just did, to keep the moment from solidifying and trapping them in the amber. He pressed their already spit slick mouths back together, accidentally tender.
“Just her clients, I said one of them was under investigation but didn’t specify that she was a suspect. She didn’t seem to question it.” Dara gestures dismissively, giving a twitch of an eyeroll. “She went on a thirty-minute-long tangent about which bugs she personally thinks are the most beautiful. It could not be derailed. I tried. Trying to get her off topic just made it worse.”
The street is quiet in the early November gloom and Harry wonders if this is the universe’s way of telling him to turn around and go home.
“Please, I—“ Harry says, the rest of the words swallowed in a moan.
“Hello?” he calls out, stashing the milk in the fridge and peering into the other room. He finds Draco sprawled out on the couch, Antiques Roadshow playing on the tv. Draco is drinking tea out of one of his mugs and he’s wearing pajama pants of Harry’s that barely skim his ankles.
Harry sighed, trying to straighten her posture back out without seeming like she was trying too hard.
“Sit down, you’re hovering,” Draco says, waving him towards a trim little armchair. Draco’s apartment is as staid and tidy as the rest of him, but the longer Harry looks, the more strange treasures he sees lying on shelves and tucked next to books and other reasonable things. Harry spots, inexplicably, what appears to be a framed, crayon drawing of a princess and a knight, and bites back a smile when he recognizes Teddy’s handiwork. “All the dragons accounted for?”
“What?” Harry asked, sticking his wand in his back pocket.
“Okay!” Ron yells. “So they probably think we’re going to take one of the back exits, but, they’re dumb. We’re about to hit the atrium, it’ll probably be chaos. Dara, Harry, you don’t have wands, so stay between me and Malfoy, we’ll be headed for the closest door and as soon as we’re outside the wards we Apparate to my house. Everyone clear?”
“Do you think you could trick me into it?” Harry asks, realizing only after its out of his mouth that it sounds like a challenge.
Harry suspects that his bathroom is about to acquire a substantial collection of very fancy hair and body potions. He suspects that he’s going to end up with a separate shampoo and body wash, which is probably for the best. He also has the suspicion that perhaps he will finally have to learn the different names for all of the wizarding ties that exist, and maybe learn one to two things about wine.
“Looking forward to Britain’s New Most Promising Dark Lord,” Draco says. “They’ll put it next to the ‘Most Charming Smile Award’ in Witch Weekly. Perhaps it will get a whole spread.”
Draco narrows his eyes. “You’ve already nicknamed it.”
Harry placed her hand carefully on Anthony’s shoulder as he moved his to her waist, both careful not to touch each other too much.
“I said wait,” Draco says mildly, watching him with lidded eyes. “I only have two hands, so I wouldn’t try that again if you want to get off anytime soon.”
“Promise?” Harry asked, wondering if perhaps she was overestimating her slowly burgeoning dance skills. Having shitty adoptive parents meant she hadn’t had the dance lessons that many of the other girls did, so she had a lot of gracefulness to make up for.
“Not killing each other isn’t getting along,” Draco replied, something almost amused in her eyes.
It’s the barest bones of a compliment, but its more than Snape ever said. “I’d hope so.”
“It’s called a submarine,” Harry said, quietly enough that Draco almost thought he’d misheard.
“Just the forest, doesn’t matter,” Draco said, and Harry hoped that meant the marks would fade in the morning light of his dorm even though they hadn’t last time.
She smiles over at him, and Harry is almost sure she’s testing him somehow. He doesn’t know what the test is and doesn’t know how to pass. “How have you been Harry? I heard about the unfortunate business with you leaving the aurors.”
53. “I don’t want anyone else to die for me,” Harry admits, the kind of selfish admission he only makes to Luna, who already understands him far more than he’s comfortable with. “And that’s what he’s trying to do, whether he’ll admit it or not. I don’t know, so he feels like he’s finally doing something good. Like he thinks risking his life is the only good thing he can do. God, that’s fucked up right? That’s not true.”
Ron crosses his arms. “Ok, I’ll bite, they don’t know which house to go to because they’re fucking and they didn’t plan it in advance and don’t want to say so in front of us.”
“Hey,” Harry says, coming around to where Draco is thumbing through a file cabinet of old issues of the Prophet, repeating to himself that he’s here for casework and nothing else. He wants to pretend that he doesn’t know why he has to keep reminding himself that.
Ron wiggles his fingers experimentally. “Awesome, love my new hand. Palfoy, if you would come help me make some lunch, that would be great.” Ron is doing an admirable job of pretending that this new configuration of friends sitting in his living room is incredibly normal. The fact that Draco and Ron have effectively worked together is easily the funniest part of all of this, and it’s taking all of Harry’s self control to not make a bigger deal about it.
“I thought you hated my father,” Draco says with a hint of his old drawl. He feels distant and Harry thinks he might be trying to hide his hurt. He never knew how Draco’s relationship with his father really was, although he read articles in the aftermath of the war that alluded to abuse and cruelty. He thinks it might have just been complicated.
“So you can’t even be cordial to me? You have to be fucking rude constantly?” Harry asked, knowing that her voice was approaching a yell even as she tried to keep it down. “We haven’t even talked this whole year! We haven’t talked since, I don’t know, I pulled you out of a fucking fire!”
“How much do I owe you?” Harry asks, pulling out his wallet.
“Night, Draco,” Harry whispered back, and then they were both buffeted away from each other and out of the forest, with gusts of air that hung heavy with treacle tart and roses.
“Yeah,” Harry said, climbing over a log until they were face to face, light up by steady wandlight.
“Did he go to school with us?” Luna begins, her blue eyes piercing as they study his reactions.
The first time they fuck is terrible. Their bodies are not made for each other and Draco gives nothing, doesn’t seem to want to kiss him, will barely touch him. Harry is afraid to press against Draco’s skin because he's half terrified it will peel away like the film on old milk.
Not Loving an Evil Boy:
“Are you going somewhere?” Harry asked, still lying down on the velvet ground, still shaking, still wishing for more.
“Well. We’re going to want breakfast eventually,” Harry says, nestling his chin against the top of Draco’s head.
“No,” Harry replies. Their relationship collapsed like an old house, their arguments rotting the floorboards and the way he couldn’t understand her tearing the walls from their moorings until it collapsed around them. “I really ended up hurting her actually.” Draco doesn’t reply and Harry makes an effort to explain. “She wanted more from me than I could give her and I think it really bothered her that she couldn’t fix me. It was awful, Ron didn’t talk to me for a month.”
He lays down, slow and steady until his head bumps the wood paneling of the porch. He can see just enough stars and constellations he knows the names of to comfort him. Draco, right above his head, mirroring himself back to him. 1/2 of the Draco’s in existence are indestructible and made of fire and will last until everyone has forgotten about all the people hurt by the other 1/2 of all the Draco’s in existence.
She scampered across the rug and dumped herself next to him, cuddling against his chest with a happy little noise. “It’s all okay now,” she said absently, as they both returned to their books.
“I hooked up with someone I really shouldn’t have,” Draco said slowly. “Really, really shouldn’t have.”
“Let’s do it.”
“Go apologize.” Anthony appeared at her side, holding Ernie in a loose dance hold. Ernie’s elbow was pointed towards the floor and he still looked terrified that anyone was expecting him to dance. “I don’t know what happened, but even Malfoy isn’t immune to apologies.”
“Great, thanks,” Harry says, taking the box. “Your wards look good by the way, it doesn’t look like anyone’s broken in, or even tried. I’ll let you know as soon as the reports on the potion come back.”
This is horrible, Harry. I’m going to die and it’s horrible.
Harry looked over at him in alarm. “Your cellars had spider webs like this?”
There was something unnerving about Draco, and Harry couldn’t place what it was. He thought it might have been his own vague conviction that Draco was lying, about something or someone. It might have been a side effect of being a mirage, but Harry couldn’t be sure.
“I might have a meeting,” Draco says, feeling slightly panicked. He has a very, very strong feeling that across the kitchen, with his hand all the way in the chip bag, Harry is staring at him. He can’t confirm this, because it would break his no-looking-at-Harry rule, but he knows what it feels like when Harry is staring at him, because it’s actually a very normal experience for them.
“What’s your favorite color now?” Harry asked, unable to stop herself from grinning.
“Calm down, I’m mostly kidding.” Harry puts up his hands in a gesture of surrender. “She’s probably not a suspect, but I do need to talk to her just in case. She might know something and even if she doesn’t, we need to keep her in the loop to make sure she’s safe.”
“Of course not!” Harry replies indignantly, unsure whether or not to be pleased at the reaction or annoyed. He takes a long swig of his coffee, feeling completely ridiculous. “So technically, you both helped us out.”
“We’re proud of you,” Harry tells him, and then Scorpius is alive, again, and there’s Hogwarts and Headmistress McGonagall and Teddy throws him his wand and Voldemort is dead, once and for all.
Her voice breaks, and she cuts herself off, looking away angrily.
“So he’s immortal.” He says.
If Draco knew Bill any less, he’d say the news caused no reaction, but catches the slight shift of his shoulders, the way his jaw tightens.
“I’m scared.” Luna admits lightly.
He’s staying, though.
ours if Draco has anything to do with it! How could you hide this from us?! I would’ve never-”
Ginny knows there’s no changing his mind, knows what could happen. That they might not see each other again, if anything happens to either of them, so she does what she can. She sits next to him and hugs him.
“At least, they were when I was young. Even my father.” He sighs, tugging at his beanie and leaning back from the counter, shoving his hands in his pockets. “I don’t know why I’m telling you any of this.”
“Is it?” Draco asks, tilting his head like a bird and waiting.
The bell rings decisively as he leaves the store and he’s making his way back down the street when a voice startles him.
Harry shrugs again, always at a loss. He tries to scrape some semblance of a reply together, wants to come up with something that could justify any of this vague feeling of wanting. “I think part of it is because you don’t really care if I like you or not. You’re honest.”
She looks less nervous than some of the kids he meets, maybe because she looks to be a little older than the others, edging closer to eleven or twelve.
“The expert is actually Hermione,” Ron clarifies. “For her Ministry connections and superior intellect, not her daddy issues.”
Harry gives him a look that says he very much doesn’t believe that. “I think you’re very weird and very bad at talking,” Harry says. “I think you’re also funny? Also very hot. Obviously. Everyone knows that.”
“You’ve really made a mess,” Draco says, and Harry reaches for him, draping himself over Draco’s back as he stands in front of the mirror, notching his chin over Draco’s shoulder. “Really?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “What didn’t you sneak into, really. And it wasn’t cold if you knew how to use a warming charm or a blanket.”
Luna turned to him, nothing in their face approaching surprise. Harry didn’t know how they looked so pleasant all the time, but Harry thought it was a credit to them. “We are, would you like to help? We need more knitters.”
“Congratulations, Neville,” Hermione adds, as Luna shoots a bunch of rainbow glitter out of their wand onto the carpet.
“Can you just try? Please? Draco’s going to kill me,” Ernie said, his voice pitching up a few octaves. “I know you know what’s she’s like, I saw you watching.”
“Not particularly wolfy,” Draco says, setting down the napkin he’s pulverizing and nesting his chin on his palm. Harry realizes with a jolt of relief that he’s actually going to answer the questions put to him, which is never a given where Draco is concerned. “As you probably know, the potions have improved quite a bit since the war. Most werewolves choose not to transform at all.”
“Come and visit me after,” Harry says, pressing the shortest kiss to Draco’s mouth and pulling back to smooth out his shirt. “Sorry, fuck, this was so unprofessional.”
Dara grins like ‘I thought you would never ask’ and grabs a poster from her desk. “Perhaps you have forgotten in the wild, lustful honeymoon phase of a new love…” The paper unrolls, unveiling a heavily annotated map of wizard and Muggle London. “But we have a dragon smuggling ring to rustle and Khoury just got us some new intel.”
If the x axis was the distance between their faces and the y axis was Draco’s heart rate the graph would be a steep, steep line going up and to the right.
Best,
“Just some petunias,” Harry says, pointing out the plants Draco had forcefully reclined on. They’d found him tearing down the street in a residential Muggle neighborhood: a lithe, white wolf with wild gray eyes. After a half an hour of chasing and a well-aimed dart, he’d finally tumbled into someone’s garden.
The boy blinked up at him before shaking his head and replying with a mumble. “But he’s a Death Eater.”
“You could actually ask a girl, you know,” Anthony said. Seamus nodded in enthusiastic agreement.
“Still the same,” Draco said, schooling his face into careful coolness. He found himself happy to see Harry and the surprise of it was making it difficult to keep his guard up. Last time he’d wanted to bicker like they used to but he wasn’t sure what he wanted this time. Maybe he just didn’t want to be alone.
“Quit zoning out,” Draco snapped, and Harry found herself wrenched back into reality by the high pitched rasp of Draco’s voice. “You’re abysmal enough when you aren’t distracted.”
“Probably because I’m your friend and partner, jeez,” Dara says. “Don’t bite my head off about it. I’m just saying you clearly like him and that once we get out of this mess you should put on your big boy pants and say something about it.”
“Extremely right,” Ron says. “Malfoy, would you like to begin?”
“I don’t know,” Draco says. “Like if a blueberry muffin was a person. A very intense blueberry muffin.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, feeling guilt and desire pool in stomach until he couldn’t tell the difference between the two. “No, I expect not.”
He couldn’t explain to them that Draco was trying, that he wasn’t so hateful anymore, that Harry couldn’t explain most of his attraction in the first place. He was beginning to wonder if sleep was worth all this, if the way he was getting better in some ways was ruined by the way Draco was tearing him apart.
“One scathing criticism at a time please,” Harry replied, making an effort to tighten her grip on Draco’s hand, only her survival instincts keeping her from trying to cut off Draco’s circulation as a way to be difficult.
“When?” Harry asks.
“But why would they all be working together?” Harry asks.
“I can give you one, if you want,” she says, reaching up her arm and pulling off a flower. Draco gives her a quiet smile as she hands him the flower.
The party was, in theory, a good idea. Everyone was so full of good ideas after the war, lobbing thing after thing at the wall until one of them stuck. Draco thinks that it isn’t that everything was and continues to be wrong, but that everything flew in different directions and they haven’t found all the pieces yet. Draco thinks in metaphors a lot now, thinks in analogies and graphs in a constant struggle to make sense of things.
Draco lowered himself slowly onto Harry’s chest, his arms resting on the ground and his chin hooked over Harry’s shoulder, rising and falling with his own breathing. Harry himself barely dared to breathe, just stared up at the waving branches and tried to temper his mounting hysteria.
Draco sips at his tea and sits up straight. “Care to go again?”
“I want-” Harry said, words almost beyond him. He buried his head the crook of Draco’s neck, trying to even his breaths as Draco rocked against him, driving him into the velvet soft ground. He wished he could feel Draco’s skin, wanted to feel Draco’s hands on his cock but didn’t want to stop long enough to ask.
“I’m not casting the cruciatus curse on you,” Draco says, though Harry doesn’t think he sounds as firm about it as he could. “How do you think that would look? What if I went too far and you ended up crazy?”
“Legilimens.”
“Harry, look at me,” Draco said, insistent and pressing his forehead hard against Harry’s. His words were staccato and undercut with a boiling hurt that Harry knew too well in his voice, too well not to try and kiss away. “Do you want me?”
“Are they wizards?” Harry whispers back, gripping the wine glass with unnecessary force.
Harry lets out a sigh and scrunches his face up. “I feel ridiculous. Dress robes for tea, honestly.”
“We have, Headmistress,” Draco replied, her voice erring very far towards insolent. The flush of color had returned to her cheeks, and she was darting glances at Ernie that were verging on furious. “Ernie had said that he was going to practice and he has stepped on my toes thirteen times and I have run into my fellow classmates eleven.”
“Well that’s a first,” Hermione chided.
Harry looked at Hermione in surprise, amused by the strong set of her shoulders. She looked like she did when she was championing a new cause, a light in her eyes like she was trying to fix something that wasn’t quite right.
Draco gives her the two finger salute. “Everyone! Announcement! Pansy’s a homophobe.”
Draco picks up the photo, giving it a suspicious glance. “She’s one of the only vendors of wolf-based potion ingredients, but she’s a bit too into wolves for my taste.”
“I’m not very good, I’ve only done scarves in the past,” Greg said, looking a bit uncomfortable.
“I know,” Draco said, in a clipped tone. Harry couldn’t remember the last time she’d seemed quite so closed off. Draco Malfoy was a lot of things, but quiet and restrained was not her usual. It was probably good, but it just made Harry want to prod at her.
“It just looked like you’d done it before,” Harry says, unable to lie, unable to justify. He wants to apologize but he doesn’t want to leave, not with Draco making himself shine in the unforgiving light. “It’s like when the girls did their makeup before dances and stuff, you’re so sure of yourself.”
“Don’t you get to decide what Malfoys do and don’t do?” Harry said with that same tiredness, and Draco wanted the forest to swallow them both up so he wouldn’t have to work so hard to keep Potter out of his head.
The lake in front of Draco was a perfect circle, large enough that he had to squint to see across it. In squinting, he realized it emitted a cheerful green glow bright enough that he didn’t need his wand. Draco knelt down to touch it, at first tentatively and then with more vigor, his hands coming up shimmering with the glowing water.
Draco kissed just like he did the night before, shining with wild magic and grasping hands. Without the ground to catch them, Harry had to hold them tighter together, his grip on Draco frantic as he unbuttoned his pants and slipped his hand inside, gratified by the sounds Draco made into his mouth as he touched him. It was like the night before, except that the quiet moans from Draco’s lips hadn’t been so tied to his own sloppy movements, to Draco pushing into his hand and shuddering against his body like Harry was the only thing holding him up.
“No, not yet,” Draco said, her eyes not quite meeting Harry’s. It felt like an incomplete thought but she didn’t add any more, just danced until the song ended before dropping Harry’s hands. “I think I’d like a bit of a break.”
In a more general sense, it’s also beginning to occur to him that they’re going to have a truly heinous amount of paperwork in the morning, which will most likely consist of individual forms for each and every one of the Ministry sconces they broke in their heroic escape. He’s also at some point going to have to break the Draco-news to Dara, who will find some way of making him put a Galleon in the Pizza Party Jar for his Draco-kissing crimes.
Draco’s grip on her hand tightened, a warning sign Harry thought she might just ignore. “Did I not say that it was none of your business?”
“It feels weird,” Harry complains as Draco starts on the second eye, and he does that cough-laugh thing again. It’s the most comfortable Harry thinks he’s ever felt with with him but he doesn’t know why. Maybe because neither of them have said anything rude, maybe because there’s no one else to see them, maybe because there was something stripping about walking in to him with red on his lips.
“Why?” Harry asks, then kicks himself for not just saying yes.
He wondered if she knew how alive the forest was. He had a feeling that she might know much more than he did, but was afraid that the game would be up if he asked her. It was an odd sort of secret, because it wasn’t bad, not really, but he had a strong conviction that telling other people would spoil it somehow. He couldn’t tell if it was the Draco bit or the fact that the forest seemed to be recalibrating him at a primal level, but the fact remained.
“It’s not as big of a deal now,” Harry tries, knowing he shouldn’t be arguing. “Bill has all those scars and there’s that girl in Wiz Mix, nobody cares that she’s a werewolf. No one minds as much anymore.”
The castle also knew that Harry kept, in a dusty, un-examined corner, a pair of gray eyes. The castle was fairly sure he hadn’t meant to put them in there, that they’d crept in from the brain or the sternum and gotten stuck, but they were in there all the same.
She drops the garland, dropping all pretense of decorating. “You two went to the hospital together? That’s it?”
29. Draco was looking at Harry like he was asking to be looked at in return and Harry could do it, this simple thing, and then the flames began. They started at the back of Draco’s throat and licked outwards to envelop his shoulders, his head, his chest and his hips. Then there were his hands and his shoes and then there was a pyre.
Harry laughed helplessly as Draco detached herself from Harry’s embrace with a pleasant smile and went swishing over to Pansy, Blaise, and Greg, who were playing hand games near the other end of the room.
“So what indeed,” Malfoy replies, leaning back and resting his feet on the rungs of the stool. He’s wearing muggle shoes, ragged old Converse instead of his old loafers, and their apparent age is more startling than anything else. He wants to know how long Malfoy’s been hiding here, and why.
“Yes, please.” He says anyway, heart aching, knowing it means more to him than it does to Harry. “The castle is suffocating me.”
“I want Unicorn Marshmallow, please.” Ginny says.
it.” Draco pleads, but Harry shakes his head.
“I don’t think they’re talking.” Ron says. “I can’t hear anything.”
“Well.” Granger begins, and Draco senses she’s going to answer his question, so he rests himself on his elbows and looks at her. “Voldemort made Horocruxes.”
They sneak out of the dorm – not an easy thing to do with Hannah Abbott and Ernie MacMillan right in the common room reading books to the first years to calm them down – but they manage anyway.
“Oh.”
“Of course!” Draco says immediately. “I’d love to be your best maid!”
“You don’t need to ask!” Draco says, exasperated. “I am

Aaaaand, apparently bub does NOT mean what I thought it meant, so I'm changing it to babe :D
“So,” Thomas grins from where he’s sitting on Adam’s bed with his arms wrapped around him. Draco shoots him a warning look. It’s the first time Harry’s been around his dorm mates – he’s sitting on the bed while Draco finishes packing – and he just

“You’re dismissed, Mr. Weasley,” McGonagall says curtly. Both Bill and Draco look at her, and she gestures to Draco. “The youngest. If you receive anything else, you come straight to me. Alright?”
Pansy grabs his shoulders and pulls him away from the wall.

“Can you just –
“Me, too,” Draco admits. “I - I'm sorry about the debate. It was a bad idea, and I should’ve just talked to you openly about why I was scared. I – I think I know how to fix this.”
It’s funny. He thinks. He’s not sure. This whole situation has given him a rather odd sense of humor.
Draco grimaces and whimpers, then burrows deeper into the pillow.
“Point to Draco,” McGonagall says, nodding, and Harry shakes his head.
Harry still remembers it, the first time he saw Draco; everyone had known who he was. Anyone even remotely familiar with the Riddle case knew his face better than they knew their own. Harry had practically seen Draco grow up through pictures and magical security feed, in his parents’ pinboard at home, where they kept everything relevant to the Riddle case. Even now, that James and Lily are retired from the force, they keep their pinboard up.
“Thank you,” he says.
“You’ve been

Every evening, he sits on his bed and toys with Malfoy’s Floo address, debating on what to do, trying to imagine what sort of life he might have if he calls him. He almost does, three times, before he stops lying to himself. It was a nice illusion, the one that Malfoy showed him, but that was all it was. He’ll never join him, no matter how angry he is at his family – and make no mistake, they

“Alright.” Hermione nods. “And Hufflepuff’s cup might be here, too, but we’re not certain. We’re trying to track down the rest of the Horocruxes, and McGonagall’s found most of them, except for Riddle’s diary, Slytherin’s Locket, and Marvolo Gaunt’s ring. We think they might be hidden in Malfoy Manor.”
Harry curses under his breath, and Hermione steps into the bathroom carefully, stepping over the broken mirror and Dolohov’s broken wand. She kneels over him, grabs his wrist, and places two fingers on his neck.
“I can go out with whoever I please.” Draco says, clipped. “It’s not your decision. And I’m not going out with him again, anyway. He seems to be under the impression that I’m

“He’s old enough.” Lucius snaps.
“Why would I know?” Draco frowns. “I’ve never been there.”
“Yes, but I don’t
Parkinson controls her reaction exceedingly well, but Harry can still see the twitch of her lips in an almost-smirk and the slight raise of an eyebrow in surprise.
“He’s his son.” Hermione says.
“It happened.” Draco shrugs, picking at the hem of his sleeve. “It’s not your fault. And anyway, it’s over now.” It’s not, not completely, and they both know it. Still, Harry knows Draco doesn’t like talking about it, so he doesn’t say so. “Did you go to McGonagall about the nightmares?”
“You’ve read practically everything-”
Draco huffs again and rolls his eyes, until a devilish smirk takes over his lips.
“I was here.” She says. “When you were talking to that blond boy, you know?”

Also all the teachers at Hogwarts know bc they know he looks like Lucius Malfoy (though it's not as noticeable bc instead of slicked back, his hair is loose and wavy and he has a very different personality)
“Yeah,”
“Hi, honey.” Molly kisses his cheek as she steps into the kitchen, stepping forward to kiss Ginny’s cheek too, completely unfazed by the scene in front of her. “No cursing each other before breakfast, you know that.”
Everyone stares at him.
“Ron-” Hermione winces.
“Ginevra knew since the beginning of the year!” Malfoy snaps impatiently. “She said so in the hospital, while you were asleep.” Malfoy stretches his hands in a ‘look around you’ gesture as he waves his wand. Hogsmeade changes around him, and he finds himself in Malfoy Manor, a horribly familiar blonde woman that Draco can’t place petting his hair and kissing his forehead, Lucius Malfoy beside her with a smile on his face. “With us, Draco, you can have
“Fleur’s and Bill’s wedding, do you remember that?” Draco begins twisting his hands in his lap nervously, scratching at the skin until it goes red and raw. “Of course you do, it’s in a month and you’re invited and-”
Draco smiles crookedly.
Ginny scoffs and rolls her eyes. “Yes, because he won’t notice if we sneak into the bathroom while he’s showering…”
“Fine,” He says, desperately trying to ignore the way Potter’s arm – his shoulders broadened this summer, and he’s grown a foot and a half, and he looks so good Draco wants to hex something – brushes against him every time he moves. “Yours?”

“Yours’ll probably be a dung beetle, because it’s what you are.” Draco shoots back, cheeks burning hotly.
“Hey, brat!” Fred calls. Draco looks at him. He hadn’t noticed, but apparently his parents are done shopping and they’re heading to the next place. “We’re leaving! Come on!”
“Are you sure?” Harry asks, grinning.
“Well,” he drawls. He wants to say they’ve never done it in the kitchen, but it’s a lie, because since the quarantine started they’ve pretty much lost all sense of decorum and propriety. “Doing it in the kitchen was fun.”

He takes another sip of his milkshake.
Harry wants him to believe that more than anything.
But she agrees, which is how Harry ends up cramped into Zabini’s bed that night, along with another three people, desperately trying to ignore the moaning around the room. Okay, apparently Draco really is just going to have sex with Theo, even with Harry in the picture. He tries to ignore the sharp pang of pain that runs through his chest. He's not angry, per se. It's not like they agreed to be exclusive or anything, but he can't help the sharp bitterness and disappointment that's been sitting on his throat since this whole thing started.

“Yeah.” He says. “Yeah, of course. I’m with you.”
“What?” Ron asks. “What happened in third year?”
“Then you’ll have to find a way to bring the boy to the Manor, Severus.” Says another voice. Draco doesn’t recognize it. “Both Potter and my son.”
They’ve slipped into an easy sort of banter that Draco enjoys. He almost thinks it’s flirting sometimes, right before he shakes his head and chides himself for being dumb enough to think Harry would be interested in him.
“I told you, you would become my dinner, blondie.” He says, and begins stalking closer.

“So,” Draco says, avoiding Harry’s eyes because of how intensely he’s staring at him. Harry leans against the bedside table, very close to him, and Draco looks at his shoes, suddenly very interesting. “Err. Nice weather today, isn’t it?”

“What’re we talking about?” Pansy asks, popping her gum as she appears out of nowhere. She’s wearing fishnets, heavily ripped muggle denim – she’s gotten into wearing and watching muggle things just to piss her parents off – and a crop top from a muggle band that Draco doesn’t recognize.
“Don’t try to change the subject.” He growls. Well, that didn’t last long.
about Draco-”
Draco rubs at his eyes furiously with the edge of his sleeve; he thought he’d be able to hold it together longer, but not with Ginny, not with his sister. It feels impossible to lie to her.
Harry looks surprised. “What? No!”
“Don’t you want to know what it is?” Bellatrix smirks when Draco doesn’t respond. He stares at her, even if he knows that that will make her angry. Instead of yelling or frowning, as she usually would, her smirk widens. “Your brother is here.”

When Scorpius goes back home for the summer, he’s greeted with open arms.
It’s been quite a while since he’s woken up screaming, but it used to happen very often when they were younger, though he usually sneaked into Bill’s bed.
Draco sighs, but they go to the Great Hall together.
“Do you want to stand in the dance floor and pretend to dance just so I can hold you very close to me without having your mum smack me with a spoon?” Harry rectifies, and, despite himself, Draco smiles lightly.
“I was in the Occlumency lessons, with Snape.” He says, taking a deep breath. “And I saw something.”
“No,” He says, quickly grabbing his shoes. “It’s fine. I – I have to leave, I’ll, err, see you both later – I’m glad you’re-” he waves a hand towards them. “Happy.”
They stay quiet for a moment.
“Have you told anyone?”
Pansy flips him off.
“Well, yeah!” Draco says defensively. “Cooking for someone means you love them!”
“Yeah,” Draco says. He hesitates, and then, “Do you remember last year?”
“Can I read it now?” he asks.
“Will you be spending the rest of the summer with us?” Molly asks.
He does know. When he was younger and he realized his feelings for Potter, he’d taken to calling him by his last name because it seemed less personal to a ten year old Draco, as if that would somehow help him get over his crush. It didn't.
“Hello, Draco.” She says softly. “My name’s Narcissa.”
“Get some sleep,” Harry says. “And I’ll see you tomorrow?”
“Miss Lovegood, that’s amazing!” he hears Lupin say, and when he turns he sees a hare hopping around happily.
“No,” Draco says hastily. “I mean, it’s fine. I’ll be quick. You go to dinner.”
“You should talk to him. I’ve already told him about it, you’d just have to establish a time. Practice it as often as possible, if you will. It’s very important, especially this year.”
“Time for a little research, don’t you think?” He says.
“How have you been?” And it’s such a

, he thinks in a daze. It’s always been them, Scorpius-and-Rose, joined at the hip since she saw his little baby face, Scorpius-and-Rose, reading until dawn and quizzing each other because they’d be damned if there was anything they didn’t know, Scorpius-and-Rose, entering the Chamber of Secrets for Hugo because he’s Rose’s annoying little brother and she’d die before anything happened to him, and if Rose is dead then Scorpius is dead, too.
Ron frowns and makes him sit on his bed.
They’d made a deal; after every Quidditch game, Draco goes to his bed, they shed a shirt or two, occasionally their wands, put up a silencing charm and play a moaning tape over and over – really, how no one has noticed is beyond him, they are always literally the exact same moans – and they stay in his bed for a few hours, watching a movie, reading a book, doing homework, or whatever it is they have to do.
“You did?” Draco asks, surprised. His parents had been furious, along with practically every teacher, except Flitwick. He’d mostly been impressed at Draco’s, Pansy’s, and Blaise’s charm work. He’d given them House points for it, in secret.
“I know about the Order,” he says. “I read it. My father had a picture.”

“Or,” Ron continues. “I can chain you to your bed and then you can sleep in the Hufflepuff dorms.”

“So what the hell do you want me to do? Tell you the truth? You don’t let me speak for long enough to do that-”
“No one would judge you.” She says.
The room’s tense for a few moments.
“Of course I know!” Draco says, embarrassed, even though he doesn’t. His parents never really talked to them about sex. Bill tried to, once, Draco pretty much plugged his ears and ran away.
“What did you think we were doing?” Harry asks.
“Shit,” Zabini hisses. After he gave Theo Draco’s wand to give back to him, he didn’t imagine this was what he’d use it for.
Draco sighs and raises his wand.
Ron drops down on the couch and gives half a shrug. He thinks he should feel better than he does; he just got his brother back, and he’s not wondering if he’s dead in a ditch somewhere anymore, it’s just… somehow, he’s still worried that something’s going to happened, that something already
“Uh, yeah. Almost. I’m – we’re – yeah. In a bit.” Draco does his best to smile.
“You’re lying.” Draco says weakly. He has to be. His family would never do that. They wouldn’t.
“Draco,” He says. “Draco, are you alright? Can you hear me?”
“I, err, just remembered I forgot something.” He says.
?” Ron roars, equally as loud. “Merlin, Gin, do you think this is any bloody fun for me? I only lied because I wanted to protect you-”
“I’m not ruining my life,” Draco snaps.
“Yeah. I’m going out with Gin.” He says. They do it every few weeks to catch up, even if they talk every day. “Why, did you have something in mind?”
And he walks out.
“Oh.” Harry says. “That’s… good.”
Bellatrix looks furious.
After Ron falls asleep, Draco tosses and turns for a few minutes, attempting to sleep, and when he doesn’t manage it, he sighs and sits up.
Fuck.
“Well, Fleur’s a Veela. And she’s a girl.” He shrugs. “It’s happened to her a few times, and she really helped me. We started talking, and now we send weekly letters.”
“The owl?”
He does, but again, he doesn’t respond. She gives him a curious look, like she can’t quite figure him out, and he looks away quickly.
“So they can lie to your face again? So they can twist this to make it seem like they did nothing wrong?” Malfoy asks. “They’ve never loved you, Draco, and no matter what you do, they never will. You’ll never be good enough for them.”
Parkinson and Ginny aren’t here; they stayed in the library, comparing notes and telling each other what their group knew, and Ginny will fill them in later.
Draco hands him the letter. He’s been carrying it around in his pocket for weeks now, too scared that someone will go through his things and find it.
“You can’t,” he says.
“I can’t have a long happy life while innocent people out there are dying!”
“And what could’ve caused that?” Their mom asks anxiously.
He can’t just walk up to Draco and explain everything to him when the insufferable brat has been hiding things from him since he told him he loved him.
“It was expensive,” Mundungus assures them. “And you’re not going to find a lot of it, ever. It’s a one of a time opportunity.”
“Fuck you,” Draco says without heat. He’s petting one of the trees, talking and singing to it. It’s part of detention, and Sprout says it makes the trees happier, healthier, quicker to grow.
“I don’t know.” Draco says. “She made me leave before she did, but she must’ve. Unless the Aurors took it.”
not going to be young forever, and a guy is only fertile for so long.”
Blaise rolls his eyes. “Yeah but with a little wax and a wand I can do Rita Skeeter’s family crest and it doesn’t mean I am her.”
, I just said it so she’d leave.”
She gives him a hard look.
She rushes to continue. “He doesn’t know it’s about you! He doesn’t even know why we’re doing it at all.”
“We, uh.” Draco begins, but she interrupts.
him, you know? Like I’m seeing everything he is. I see the death eaters. Pettigrew, too, and I’ve never seen him.”
“He’s a weak man, your father. I loved him with all my heart, but even then, I knew. He doesn’t lack magical power, no, but he does lack willpower, he lacks a spine.” She huffs angrily. “And then it was over, and he was sent to Azkaban. Even then, I loved him. After a few marital visits,” her cheeks darken slightly. “I got pregnant with you. And I still loved him, but darling, I love you more. I knew how you’d end up if I let him raise you. I knew the position he’d put you in. I couldn’t let that happen.”
Harry couldn’t believe it when he’d seen Draco in the Auror Academy. A face he knew so well, a face he’d memorized, suddenly standing right in front of him and Harry could do
When the door closes, McGonagall speaks. “Professor Lupin, Professor Snape, Professor Flitwick, Madam Pomfrey, if you’d all ask around the Gryffindor students to see if anyone saw anything, please.”
Draco nods. “Entirely.”
there instead of standing and running like he wants to.
“What do you want, Smith?” Draco asks, rather aggressively.
“Talk to me!” He snaps.
. I can’t – make it go away,
She reaches through the table and cups his cheek, and Draco pulls away. Her face pinches, pained, but she drops her hand.
“Dobby will apparate you.” Narcissa says. “He called me.”
McGonagall comes half an hour later to floo him and Ginny back to Hogwarts, and though he doesn’t want to, he goes with her as soon as she arrives. He needs to get away from the tense atmosphere, Fleur and Bill still pacing like crazy, Draco still in pain, no one sure what to say or what to do.
Draco looks up expectantly, as does everyone else.
“Of course I care! I’ve been worried sick about you for weeks and you don’t even bloody bother to-”
“They’ll figure it out.” she says. “They’ll know I stole them, and they’ll know you’re the only possible key. They’ll want you to join their side, and if you don’t, they’ll want to force you.”
And the fighting begins again.
He merely shrugs.
Harry nods as he ushers her out of the room, closing the door after she’s gone. He sighs, turning back to look at Draco.
Draco’s in yellow badger pajama pants and a grey jumper that used to be Fred’s, so he’s rather easy to spot, as are the rest of his roommates (all with some sort of yellow clothing and various other bright colors), but that’s not really a problem when they know all the passageways through the castle.
Harry, do you want to demonstrate?”
Harry smiles; five years, four graduations, a new flat, three pets, and hundreds of hours of therapy later, but they’re here. They’re finally here, and it’s not perfect, but it’s as close as Harry’s ever gotten, and he doesn’t think he could wish for anything more.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What date?” Ron and Harry ask at the same time.
“The only possible reason they’d want to come here is because of your brat, Lupin.” Snape drawls. “Wouldn’t it be safer for everyone else if he were to leave?”
Draco hums thoughtfully. “Maybe. Have they been getting better?”
“Err, yes.” Harry says, giving a sheepish smile. “One year.”
Harry finally looks at him. “I’m talking about the fact that we were going out and I thought we were exclusive until I heard you shagging Theodore Nott!”
“I can’t leave either,” Draco says. He feels somehow hollow and incredibly furious at the same time. The anger and the pain that are sitting in his chest like a rock is something he doesn’t know how to deal with, not like this.
“You’re - saying words.” Draco says faintly, as Mrs. Thomas continues.
“Fine,” Potter says, rubbing at his eyes, leaving his glasses crooked.
It doesn’t take him long to reach one wall. He doesn’t dare stand yet, so he instead crawls along it until he bumps into a corner. He makes a turn and crawls along that wall, then the next, and the third time he turns, instead of a wall, he finds metal bars.
Medically though, the headaches – blinding, with how much they hurt, rendering him incapable of doing anything, even speaking – are mostly gone; they’re only back whenever he tries to think about the past three days, of which he remembers nothing of.
“So, err.” Hermione begins. “How have you been?”
Harry can’t think when he sees Bellatrix Lestrange’s wand against Draco’s temple, so he doesn’t. Instead, he lets out an almost inhuman sound; Bellatrix Lestrange, along with all the other death eaters, is thrown against the wall. The windows shatter.
After
“No, we’re not.” Draco says. “Because I’m adopted. And you all knew.”
“Do you think they’ll send Aurors here?” Adam asks excitedly.
Ron gets a dreadful feeling in his stomach, even if he knows it’s ridiculous to assume it’s anyone he cares about; Hermione would never get in a fight – she’s smarter than that -, Harry would, but he’s here with him, Ginny’s more creative for harming people, and it’s not really like Draco; he’s a bastard, and he always gets even, though in a much less obvious way.
“Doesn’t mean it’s not true.” Ron grumbles.
“You are

“Okay,” Noah says as they all sit on their beds. From behind his closet, he pulls out a muggle pin up board. They use it whenever something happens, and this situation grants it. “So,” he takes one of the pins between his teeth and opens the drawer they have, full of information on a lot of things. He puts up Thomas’s drawing of Snape and pins it there. “Snape has a mystery godson.”
Draco shares a dorm with him, Thomas Franco, Adam Caron, and Jae Lee. They’ve become close friends over the years, and Draco’s thankful that he gets along with his roommates.
Harry shakes his head.
Remus elbows him back. “Says you, who was openly sobbing about it not two hours ago.”

screwed up, this is the worst one. And so he does the only thing he can think of. He runs away.
“Okay,” She exhales. “How do we get rid of them?”
“You know I can’t do that.” Harry shakes his head. “Come on. You’ll get to meet this cute grandkid of yours. You’ll see Sophie again. You’ll be there to love them, the both of them!”
Draco loses track of things, during the battle. He sees the Dark Mark, he fires spells. He sees Hogwarts’ Crests, he doesn’t. He sees Lupin, at some point. Sirius Black, too, fighting back to back in a way that can only mean they’ve done this before, and Draco can’t imagine how they’ve managed. He doesn’t think he could ever do this again.
“Wait, wait,” he says. “I forgot – I have an essay due tomorrow – it’s thirty inches – I haven’t even started-”
would never lie to you.”
Draco hugs his mum back, and she smiles and pets his hair lightly before moving on to hug everyone else. When they get to the burrow there’s a similar flurry of hugs in which Bill smacks Draco and calls him ‘a bloody idiot’, with which Fred, George, and Charlie agree.
He takes something tiny out of his pocket, and when he Engorgio’s it, Draco realizes it’s a huge Honeydukes bag full of candy.

Harry tries to look half as excited as he knows Draco would at the prospect of a structured debate about whether or not to set off a bomb, but he’s not quite sure he manages it.
Draco’s spine tightens, and he shrugs Ron’s hand off. He slides down to sit on the floor, and after a few seconds, Ron does the same.
Bill takes a moment to just
Before long, he finds lying on top of Harry, still kissing lazily, and as soon as he realizes their position, he pulls away from the kiss, though leaves their bodies flush against each other.

“Don’t I?” Harry says, and anger shouldn’t be such a good look on him. “We’re friends-”
“But if it’s not from Malfoy, who could it be from, and why does it have his crest?” Draco asks.
“Why not?” Harry asks, exasperated.
“You’re lying,” he chokes out through gritted teeth. The healer gave him potions in case the headaches were back, but Draco left them in his room back at Hogwarts.

“You’re a bastard.” He says. “And I don’t have to share my thoughts with you.”
And she doesn’t wait for them to answer before she’s out the door.
He does not feel fine. He’s mortified beyond belief, and he wishes he were anywhere else in the world.

of being a good parent,” Hermione says. “If you’re not sure you want them, they’ll make you miserable.”
She points him to Ron’s room, and he slips inside soundlessly. It’s very dark and he can’t see much, but he sees what he guesses is his brother’s bed, since it has several Weasley jumpers half in, half out of the trunk.
Adam hums. His eyes widen dramatically.
“I can take that.” Hermione says, opening her hands.
“Yes.” Harry says, cheeks reddening. “Some Gryffindor nerve, huh?”
“You can’t lie like that to me again,” Draco says, snapping Ron out of his haze. “I won’t stand it. You’re supposed to be my brother.”

help you out of it.”
“Brat,” Harry says, but there’s a teasing smile on his lips. “I’m serious. You’ve been very quiet lately.”
“The Dark Lord is getting impatient.” Lucius Malfoy answers. The voices are getting closer, and soon Snape comes into view. He’s holding a small mirror, looking into it, and Draco can only guess Lucius Malfoy is in the other side. “He needs to kill Potter before he gets stronger.” Hermione makes a small noise, and Draco slaps a hand over her mouth. Snape’s head snaps towards them, and Draco holds his breath. “You’ve said he’s powerful, have you not?”
Hermione tries to smile, but it comes out wavering. “About Horocruxes.”
Draco breathes through the sudden panic.
“You know how I haven’t really been able to do the Patronus charm?” he asks.
, and she wants to talk to him, everyone else be damned.
Sprout’s frown deepens. “I assure you, Mr. Potter, I will think of something.” The look on her face softens. “Is there something you’d like me not to tell Mr. Weasley?”
“It’s almost sunrise.” Hermione says. “Don’t you want to stay? I don’t want you to go back alone.”
Harry catches sight of Hermione bouncing her foot awkwardly.
When the death eaters arrive at Hogwarts, Harry is ready. He’s shaking all over, pent up energy, and righteousness, and
“They’re not dead.” Hermione warns. “They’ll wake up.”
“You think I’m not
he tells himself ruefully,
Antonin Dolohov is lying on the floor, face bruised and bloodied, unconscious.
“We should follow him.” Draco says immediately.
She glares at him. “Leave.”
Draco’s friends are also looking around, seeming equally confused, and Draco vaguely registers Professor Sprout asking a question.
“And my son?” he asks at last.
we’re not doing that.” Ginny says, frowning. “It’d be creepy enough to sneak up on him in the shower, getting him to have sex with someone just to steal from him would be creepier still!”
“Potter.” Jae says.
Later, in Remus’s room, Harry’s freaking out.
It’s said with as much impertinence as he can get away with. He doesn’t know if Lupin is amused, or angry, or worried, but he merely sighs and nods, and so Draco turns on his heel.
“Merlin, Draco, if you want to play dumb bloody forget it.” Harry mutters as he begins walking away.
“Well,” McGonagall says. “That was interesting.”
.” He snaps. He’s shaking. He hates her for saying that, more than he’s hated anything else in his life.
“Like what you’re all doing is any better.” Zabini sneers. “At least we’re ashamed to lie to his face, you’ve all been doing it for weeks without a problem.”
Potter looks at him skeptically and runs a hand through his hair, making it even messier. Draco’d like to swoon now, but he doesn’t.
sound like that-” Draco interrupts, blush intensifying and spreading down his neck and shoulders.
“Merlin, Draco, it was only a few dates, but you can’t just-”
So Hermione watches quietly as she does it with another two magpies – each one giving her one of the horcruxes – and, soon enough, she’s holding all three.
Harry nods and swallows.
Draco has no idea what she’s talking about, but before he can say so, she quickens their step, nearly making him stumble.
It’s tiny, and sort of ugly – he hasn’t laughed in a long time – but it’s there.
“A thirty inch essay?” she scoffs, giving him a look, dusting dirt and filth off her robes. She’s wearing dark, plain robes, with a hood that allows her to hide her face. He’s wearing a similar attire. Their resemblance to death eaters isn’t accidental; fear really motivates people to give them what they want. “That was your excuse?”
Draco sighs. This quarantine is taking its toll on Harry; in the last few years as an Auror he’s gotten used to being on the field all the time - because it’s what he likes - and even when he’s home, he always takes Draco to Quidditch games, or restaurants, or the park, so he’s not used to being home like this all the time.
He really wishes he hadn’t asked.
“We’ll do anything, mate.” Ron says. “Whatever it is. You’re
“Hey brat,” His brother smiles fondly, squeezing at his shoulder before sitting down on the chair next to Draco’s. “Mom and dad were called into the ministry by the Aurors. What happened?”
“Potter,” Pansy greets coolly, despite the rising color on her cheeks. “How’s your weekend been?”
Draco looks back at Greyback, still in pain, curled on the floor.
His hands tangle in Harry’s hair to drag him closer, and instead, Harry pulls away, panting lightly.
“I hear you

“We still are-”
Potter thinks he’s
– and then leaves, going back to Potter.
It doesn’t really seem like he has a choice – he doesn’t know where he is, he doesn’t know how to get back, and he’s listening to everyone around him and doesn’t understand the language – so he merely begins walking when she does, though he refuses to take her arm.
“I was curious.” He defends himself.
“How very… Slytherin of you.” She says finally. She bats her eyelashes. “Why ever would Malfoy want Draco?”
.” Noah says. “Because we haven’t listened to you rant about him for years.”
“Nothing,” Harry lies. “He wasn’t helpful, at all.”
Remus laughs softly. “No, Harry. You didn’t do anything wrong. How did he react?”
“We are
say structured debate-”
Harry exhales shakily, feeling both a million times better at having Draco in his arms and a thousand times more uncertain. He can feel the tension of it, the way Draco curls himself around him differently, and though he thinks he should’ve expected – he did, sort of – it doesn’t make it any less painful to watch.
She shakes her head quickly and takes a step back.
They all look up, and, surely enough, there’s an owl approaching, but instead of flying into Hogwarts, it lands next to them.
didn’t think to mention this?”
Harry tunes him out as he continues rambling, instead using his time to rub the tip of his nose against the line of Draco’s throat, teases his lips against his clothed shoulder. Draco hums again, and he sits between Harry’s legs when he straightens back up. Harry wraps his arms around his boyfriend’s waist, and Draco burrows himself deeper against his chest.
“All right then,” Draco said, beaming. “It’s a date!”
“I don’t want to hear a word about how public transport is better than having your own car, Potter,” Draco said, sending a withering look over his shoulder as they came to a standstill. The motorway now resembled the car park they’d left behind, only much longer and with a good deal more honking.
Harry conceded, and after paying, they headed out to Zacharias’s silver Volkswagen. Zacharias insisted on placing Harry’s football gear in the boot himself, even making a show of opening the bag and asking Harry what was inside.
As the laughter died down, the eyes of the group swivelled toward Harry and Draco, and Harry gave an awkward wave. Hermione leapt from her seat to hug him, her belly large and round between them, her coils of brown hair tickling his cheek.
“If you’re going to break up with me, at least have the decency to do it in person.” Harry’s voice grew progressively louder with every syllable he spoke. He was shaking, and he couldn’t tell if it was from sadness or anger or the sudden gale of wind that had whipped past him. “It’s pretty shitty to find out your boyfriend used you from a newspaper.”

“Oh, really?” Draco drawled, batting away Pansy’s two-fingered salute. “I’ll remember this next time you need to borrow my
Ron sighed and stared down at their unfinished game. “All right, I’ll walk them out. If you wouldn’t mind waiting a couple minutes, I’m sure Hermione would like to say goodbye to the both of you.”
“Sorry about that.”
Harry shrugged. “I’ve never had to call one before, but I’d expect so. That’s all right though; I did lock myself out. That’s the price to be paid.”
“Harry, it’s so good to see you!” she said, reaching out for a hug. “I suppose you’re here to try the new tea I found? It does wonders for your hearing. Truly, I never realised how paint
, Draco’s text instructed.
“I have an iPhone too, so if I could borrow your cable, that would be fantastic,” Harry said, wearily sinking onto the couch. The water from his clothes seeped into the fabric, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to care.
“If you tell them, I swear I’ll end you,” Harry said out of the corner of his mouth, then softened his words with a kiss on Draco’s cheek.
“Harry, it’s so nice to meet you,” Narcissa said, the twinkle in her eyes growing brighter. When Harry glanced back at Draco, his complexion had grown a bit brighter too, and a tentative smile had formed on his lips. “Would you two like to come in?”
Harry did the same, but a dribble of water trickled down his chin, and he hurriedly dabbed it away, fighting the wave of mortification that had just encompassed him. Shittiest night in history, indeed. He hazarded a glance at Draco, but he didn’t seem to notice what had just transpired, or at least had the decorum not to say anything.
“Yes. Really.”
He returned a couple moments later, holding out a soft blue pillow and thick green blanket in one hand, and a toothbrush and sample-size toothpaste in the other.
happiest. I want to give this a fair shot, if you do too. But regardless of what you decide, I think I’m ready to come out to my parents. It’s time I live for myself, instead of for my father. And if he can’t accept it, I’ve learnt a lot about found family from you, and I have some good friends. I think I’ll be all right. Also, for what it’s worth, after I turned in that article, my supervisor agreed that I was more suited to political work than sports, so I’ve transferred departments. I can promise you nothing like this will ever happen again.” He sat back, his expression apprehensive.
“Of course,” Harry said, jumping to his feet.
Draco shrugged. “My boss won’t mind if I come in late.”
“Woah, woah, woah.” These words burst from Cedric Diggory, a ridiculously attractive starting forward to Harry’s right. “That’s quite an accusation, McLaggen. Give Potter a chance to explain.”
“Are you almost here?” Hermione blurted, blowing past his greeting. Harry could hear chattering in the background, and the tinkle of a laugh that was unmistakably Luna’s.
“No, you tosser.” He rolled his eyes. “I mean, yes, they’re divine, but no. About how it’s been better here, for the last couple days. And I was wondering, would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow night?” Draco rushed through the last part, and a trace of pink bloomed on his pale cheeks.
come back to Britain to personally throttle you.” She smiled sweetly, as if she hadn’t just made a threat on Harry’s life. “Understood?”
Harry raised his fist and knocked. Where else did he have to go?
“I know, I’m sorry,” he said. “But at least it looks like you’ve been able to survive all right without me.”
As they heard the sound of the door unlatching, Harry squeezed Draco’s hand one last time, then made to let go, but Draco clutched him tighter.
,” Harry said. “And I hope you don’t make a habit of kidnapping your dates like this.”
He was ordering his regular, a flat white with a cardamom bun, when he got a splendid idea.
“It gets worse,” Harry said, running one finger across the byline with Draco’s traitorous name.
“It’s not a bother,” Draco assured him. “That’s what neighbours are for, isn’t it? Helping each other out.”
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “You still have my football gear in your car.”
the day the news had broken.
Harry snorted. “No, no ‘Diggory’ keychains for me. This is from the day we met. Turns out Smith didn’t take it, after all.”
Zacharias waved his concerns away, and that was when things started to go downhill. Somehow, he managed to dominate the conversation with comments on his studies of Biblical Greek at Oxford whilst also gawking at Harry’s lightning-bolt scar and apparent fame. Harry only received a reprieve in the brief pauses his date took to wolf down his spaghetti bolognese, and he unsuccessfully tried to resist the urge to check the clock behind him for the next ninety-one minutes.
Harry shrugged. He didn’t know why he’d brought this up, but he felt suddenly exposed, his darkest memories floating in the air between them. “Thanks,” he finally got out. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, what brought you to London?”
Harry laughed. “No offence, but I hardly think you could handle a run right now, and I need to get started.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron said again. “I really liked him.”
, it said.
“Well, I won’t say no, if you’re offering. I should be out of your hair by the time you wake up.”
Draco coughed, then took a long gulp of wine. Harry’s eyes traced the line of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed. “Sorry. No, the most exciting news at the office is that my boss got a dog, and the public cares about that even less than I do.”
“Pretty good! And you?”
He heard a knock on the door just as he was sliding the finished eggs onto their accompanying slices of toast.
“That’s all right.” Ron gave him a small smile. “A little bit of water never hurt anyone.” Harry choked out a laugh, and Rose toddled over to join them, wrapping her arms around Harry’s knee. They all stood there for a moment, silent, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder how he had found such an extraordinary best friend.
“About the danishes?”
They all stood there for another moment, Draco flushing spectacularly, Pansy smiling deviously, and Harry glancing back and forth between the two of them.
“If you wouldn’t mind, that would be wonderful.” Draco stepped out of the doorway and Harry followed him inside, wondering how a flat of the same design as his could look so impossibly different.
“In your dreams,” he muttered as he rifled through his bag for his keys. They weren’t in their normal side pocket. Harry frowned, then kept searching, more and more frantically. He double-checked his jean pockets, then triple-checked them. He completely emptied his bag, shaking out each rumpled jersey and sweat-stained pair of shorts.
. Because you care so fiercely about those you love, and you aren’t afraid to be vulnerable, and you’re unbelievably cheeky, and—”
“Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.” Draco paused. “Would you like to come in?”
“Posh, aren’t you?” his neighbour teased as he hurried into the back of the flat. Harry couldn’t help but stare as he retreated; Draco’s trackies were too big for him, the waistband rolled several times over, and that pen still stuck out behind his ear. His clothing choices were made extra puzzling by the furnishings of the place: chic and modern and minimalistic, like Harry’s neighbour lived in a catalogue instead of a home. This flat couldn’t have contrasted more with Harry’s, considering they had identical floor plans. He was pretty sure there were no fewer than three takeaway containers on his own coffee table, and he had an abandoned pair of shoes in every room, including the kitchen. Oh dear, he hadn’t left a pair of cleats on the counter
Draco held his hands up. “Shoot me.”
Practice that day was especially brutal, and Harry forgot about his boyfriend entirely as they ran drills to Coach Scrimgeour’s shouts and his teammates' grunts. During Harry’s water break, his eyes idly flicked to the place in the stands where he’d left Draco, but he must have moved to his preferred spot farther down the pitch, since he was nowhere to be found.
“What are you trying to say?” Harry’s words sounded as if they had travelled through several layers of phlegm before they surfaced, and he coughed, self-conscious.
Harry shuffled off the train when it reached his stop, but walked straight past the building that contained his—and Draco’s—flats and flagged down the bus to Dulwich Village instead. The wind had picked up, blowing the stench of the city’s refuse up from the river, and the morning’s promised rain finally began, a lazy drizzle just heavy enough to dampen Harry’s shirt and ruin his hair, or at least make it worse than usual. He clambered aboard, then sagged into the first available seat, trying not to consider what would happen next. The jostling of the bus made it easier not to think about anything, and Harry stared unblinkingly out the window, the buildings he passed obscured by the drumming rain that bounced from the asphalt and splattered the smudged glass. As he approached Ron and Hermione’s street, the rain flung itself from the sky with more vigour than ever, and Harry cursed himself for forgetting his umbrella once again—it had been mouldering uselessly in his locker since the night he had gone on that horrid date with Zacharias and then met Draco, almost two months ago. The newspaper he still carried crumpled in his fist, and he stalked off the bus into the waiting downpour, his heart heavy and aching.
Harry shrugged. “It might be my fault. I don’t really know. My ex is just the one who wrote the article, and he—it was published the day after I, err, invited—but I swear I had no idea about Coach Scrimgeour or any of it.” He was met with a tableful of frowns and sympathetic looks. “I really am sorry.”
Soon after, they turned around and made their way back to their flats.
no. He marched up to the hostess and asked if she could show him over to the table reserved for two under the name “Harry Potter,” and she did so, with the bedazzled glaze in her eyes that meant that she knew just who Harry Potter was. He’d always been a stellar football player, and everyone in the sports world had known his name for a few years, but his fame had kicked off in broader circles after he’d been recruited to the English national team. Stories circulated about the
“And what a terrible wait it’s been, since then.” She sighed, then grinned up at him. Harry rolled his eyes, then stepped back a bit to allow Draco into the circle that had formed. When Draco joined them, Harry squeezed his hand, and his boyfriend’s posture relaxed a bit, filling Harry’s heart with something unfamiliar but warm.
Draco tensed, so subtly Harry might have missed it were they not holding hands, then shrugged, feigning nonchalance. “I don’t know. Most of them are back in France.”
Harry chuckled. “So, since you’ve met my family, when do I get to meet yours?”
He waited, expectant. Harry was still trying to process the entirety of the confession, the ins and outs of all of it. He had no clue where to start, but he knew he needed to. Draco looked like he might spontaneously combust if another moment passed in silence
“So I knew I had a conflict of interests, as it were, which I was studiously ignoring. I thought maybe the tipoff was a dead end after all, and things could continue as they had been. But when I accompanied you to practice, I found the missing link that I needed to report to the police and publish the evidence. The problem was, I didn’t want to anymore, because I didn’t want to hurt you. I swear I didn’t. I had no idea what to do.
“I like cooking,” he mumbled, defensive.
Draco still hadn’t responded by the time practice ended. Harry frowned down at his mobile the whole Tube ride home, hoping that Draco’s work emergency wasn’t too serious, whatever it was.
Nonetheless, Harry would have been lying if he said he wasn’t relieved when Pansy announced her departure: she apparently had plans to meet up with the famed Millie later that night. She kissed both of their cheeks once again, whispered something in Draco’s ear that left him laughing silly, pointedly told Harry to remember what she’d said, and then she was gone, except for the scent of camomile and cigarettes in the front seat of Draco’s car.
“What the hell?” Harry muttered, still waking up. “Smith, where are we?”
“Five thirty,” Harry replied, beginning the process of extricating himself from the bed.
Without a coach and with the tension building between members of the team, practice didn’t get too far. Harry hadn’t been able to focus at all, missing the ball entirely in several basic drills, and his teammates didn’t seem to be faring much better. The assistant coach finally dismissed everyone less than an hour after they had begun, and they all tramped back to the locker rooms, silent.
He jumped back and let out an embarrassing yelp when a letter flopped from where it had been tucked in his doorway and onto the ground. He frowned. How had he missed that?
“Almost… where?” Harry tried.
“To our
Harry’s relief at the early release vanished as he trudged to the train station, the clouds overhead scuttling even lower than they had a couple hours earlier, pressing down on the tops of the buildings. The air felt hot and oppressive, and it curdled in Harry’s lungs with every inhalation. His thoughts had raced too quickly during his training for him to track them, let alone the ball at play, but now they crystallised into painful clarity: Draco had used him.
“Are you the plus-one?” Hermione asked, reaching out to hug Draco as well before he had time to nod in reply. “I’m Hermione. It’s so nice to meet you.” She gave him a wide smile, which Ginny replicated.
Harry offered up a sheepish smile and a Tate Modern bag brimming with prints and books and the like. Ron grinned back at the pair of them, his freckles dancing on his cheeks. “We’re just happy you could make it,” he said, opening the door wider. “Everyone’s out back, if you want to come on through.”
She extracted a cigarette from her purse, lighting up with practised insouciance. Harry squirmed under her gaze as she studied him again, eyes dark and penetrating. Pansy inhaled deeply, continuing to stare at Harry, who was beginning to wonder if he had something on his face.
Harry’s mouth opened and shut of its own accord. Not knowing where to start, he wordlessly handed Ron the soggy newspaper.
“Bristol isn’t even properly on the coast.”
There was still nothing.
The door creaked open, and a barefooted, apron-wearing Ron stood on the other side. “Harry!” he exclaimed, reaching over for a hug. “It’s great to see you, mate!” He turned to Draco and frowned slightly, his forehead wrinkling. “And this is?”
He came home late that night, arms straining to carry a football bag, an abstract painting of a fruit bowl, and a potted pansy. He hadn’t had the heart to tell Neville whom the flower reminded him of.
“They did that because it’s dangerous, Pans,” Draco said.
“How long have you lived here?” Draco asked.
“So, how’s your week been?” Harry tried. “Covering any crazy stories?”
Draco was waiting for him outside the stadium, leaning against the side of his car with the projected sophistication of someone in a sports car advert. The sight of him still sent Harry’s heart stuttering. Despite the grey sky and the rain cascading around him, it was bright outside, the sun’s glow visible behind the layered clouds.
He was so preoccupied that he nearly ran face first into a teenage girl on his way to Liverpool Street Station, but the situation was quickly rectified when she thrust a receipt at him to sign, and after a brief conversation he was on his way again.
“Hi,” Harry said, holding out the wine bottle. “The coffee shop was closed by the time I made it home tonight, so I thought this was the next best thing.”
“Hi Mother, Hi Father,” Draco said, voice taut. “I’d like you to meet Harry Potter. He’s my—he’s my boyfriend.”
“And it improved significantly a couple days ago,” Draco admitted, giving Harry a sidelong glance.
Draco’s restroom was as meticulously clean and clutter-free as the living room had been, his bath mat the same dark velvety grey as the sofa. Harry wondered briefly if it was strange for him to notice such a thing, then resumed making himself presentable-ish with renewed vigour.
The key he’d thought he lost on his date with Zacharias Smith had been in his locker the whole bloody time.
“You’ll never guess what I found,” Harry called out by way of greeting, waving the key in the air. He tossed it over, and Draco caught it nimbly, one-handed.
“I don’t follow it, precisely, but I know a thing or two,” Draco explained, drizzling vinaigrette over his salad. “Anyway, we don’t have to talk about the game. I just thought that if you wanted to go through the play-by-play, since winning against another national team is no small feat, I was a willing audience. That’s all.”
“Draco, this is incredible! How long did it take you?”
After he heard the door click shut behind Draco, Harry got to business. He brushed his teeth at the kitchen sink, then laid out the blanket across the sofa. He knew Draco had told him he didn’t need to worry about staying late into the morning, but he didn’t want to impose any more than he already had done. His neighbour had already been far nicer to him than, well, anyone had been, since he’d become a name and a face people knew, and he didn’t want to ruin it now.
“What?” The question came from Cormac McLaggen, the wide-shouldered goalie who had handed him
transport is no longer running.”
Harry sighed, tilting his head against the back of the sofa and letting his gaze rest on the silver light fixtures shining down on the pair of them. When he looked back at his neighbour, a gold aura seemed to frame his face. “The short version is that I was set up on the world’s worst date, and he sort of kidnapped me. My best guess is that my keys got left in his car.”
“Don’t you have to go to work too?” Harry asked.
Draco nodded. Harry shifted even closer, their lips a hairsbreadth from one another. If he tipped his chin up a fraction of an inch, they’d be kissing. Warmth pulsed between them, and it was simultaneously the most wonderful and most excruciating thing Harry had ever experienced. He traced his hand down the planes of Draco’s face again, trembling; their lips brushed one another, and then the dam broke. Harry clutched Draco’s hand tighter; Draco pulled Harry closer into him as they kissed, his fingers making their way into the mess of curls that lay at the back of Harry’s head and tangling there. Harry thought he would melt and evaporate and burst into flames all at once, because this was everything, and it had only been one door away this whole time.
Draco’s light was on when Harry returned home that evening, a golden beacon flashing from the third storey balcony. Harry gazed up at it and shuddered in the evening air, still heavy and hot from the day’s thick blanket of storm clouds. They’d opened up a crack for the first time that day, exposing a shard of inky sky and a sliver of dewy moonshine. Harry stared at it for a long moment, then gathered his nerves and marched up the three flights of stairs.
“It’s been… better than I expected,” Harry admitted, stepping around the coffee table to sit next to Draco, who was still visibly tense. He relaxed slightly as Harry settled in beside him. “Having the new coach. And the team has got a lot closer because of the time we had without one. You’re right that Coach Scrimgeour’s dealings needed to be made public, too. I’m still upset at you, mind, for not telling me any of this. I would
“Is this the boyfriend?” she asked Draco whilst leaning in closer to Harry, a small frown perched beneath her pert nose. She dragged his glasses down his nose with one finger, her eyes peering deeply into his for a long, heartstopping moment. Under her gaze, Harry felt the distinct sensation that his limbs had got jumbled, that his nose and his hands were much too big for his body.
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron said exasperatedly. “What was the point of mentioning it if you weren’t going to tell us?”
Harry wanted – well, it didn’t much seem to matter. Malfoy clearly didn’t feel the same way. Harry tried not to let the rejection sting to much.
Their first kiss was all blood and fire and clashing teeth. This kiss was soft lips and pressure and Malfoy oh so gently taking him apart.
“What the…” he sputtered, realising with a surge of guilt that Malfoy hadn’t actually told him he wanted to kiss him, hadn’t said a word, and that maybe after the last time, Harry should’ve taken the hint… He remembered, too late, the talk Hermione had had with him and Ron about consent… At the time it had just seemed like another one of Hermione’s campaigns.
The first time Harry had kissed Malfoy, it ended with much yelling and a trip to the hospital wing.
“What are you talking about,” he said, absolutely flabbergasted. “Like - I don’t even know what you’re saying right now.”
"Pansy Parkinson?" Harry asked, interest piqued. "What did she say?"
"Ronald, what did I say about calling Draco that?" Hermione said, a faint blush colouring her cheeks. "And you're wrong, for your information! Of course I feel bad for Harry. It's just, I was talking to Pansy, and she really made it seem -"
A week later, Harry sat in the Great Hall under a grey and rainy sky, which matched his mood perfectly. Even the owls were quieter than usual, bedraggled and wet feathers dripping on the tablecloths while their owners dried them off with charms of varying success.
Harry slumped against the wall, rubbing his eyes under his glasses. There was a pit in the depths of his stomach that was filled with sadness and bubbling embarrassment. Had his feelings been that obvious? A little voice in the back of Harry’s head that couldn’t help reminding him that Malfoy had just admitted to being gay. Malfoy was gay.
But for the first time it felt like there could be something more, like Harry could have something, something for himself, something warm and bright and happy.
“Hey,” Malfoy responded thickly. He pushed his hair out of his eyes, the thick, untidy sprawl so different from when he used to slick it back that Harry felt another one of those pesky surges of affection.
“Oh, are you,” Harry said, and he’s truly, properly mad now, and he’s not even sure how it happened and he didn’t want to be yelling at Malfoy in front of the entire Great Hall but here he is. “For earlier? Would that be when you nearly bit my lip off? Or maybe, when you nearly let me believe I had forced myself on you, and you had just let me kiss out of some, I dunno, misguided sense of pity when you were clearly enjoying it? Or maybe, MAYBE, it was when you just walked away with nothing more than a “see you, Potter,” before ignoring me for a week? Is that what you were talking about, Malfoy?”
But Draco didn’t want him like that, he reminded himself. It was just a kiss, for him.
“That’s – That’s awful,” Harry said sincerely.
But he knew that was wrong; he didn’t kiss Malfoy because he wanted to save him. Kissing Malfoy was the most selfish thing he’d done in years.
Hermione pursed her lips. “Well, I didn’t expect Harry to come back looking like he’d killed someone! Clearly Pansy’s information was wrong,” she huffed. “Anyway, I don’t see what it matters now, as Draco has made it very clear that he doesn’t want Harry to kiss him. Right, Harry?”
“Nice?” Harry sputtered. “I – “
“Fine,” Harry said. Malfoy stared at him, swallowing. “Well,” Harry demanded. “Get on with it.”
He’d made it nearly to the doors when he heard his name being called, the breathless shout of “Potter,” that made him stop in his tracks.
Malfoy swallowed, and Harry’s eyes were drawn to the way his Adam's apple bobbed in his throat.
The second time Harry kissed Malfoy, it wasn’t his fault. (Or at least that’s what he told himself, trying not to get lost in the silver-grey of Malfoy’s eyes.)
“I’m sorry for all of it, Potter. I had some things I needed to figure out, but I shouldn’t have gotten you involved and I actually enjoyed kissing you and now I’ve screwed it all up and I’m sorry, okay?”
(Harry didn’t think he’d ever heard Malfoy call him by his first name before. It did funny things to his stomach. And… other parts.)
“You’ve gotten it out of your system,” Malfoy continued, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “And now we can go back to being reluctant, well, friends, I suppose, in the spirit of reconciliation, and we can forget this ever happened.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed. “I told you - well, I suppose you know, now. And I was sure that Draco like you…” She trailed off, looking pensive.
He’d punched Malfoy, too. (But only after the git had hit him first.)
He wasn’t sure how he was supposed to forget him.
Malfoy’s lips were soft and warm and there was a world of difference between this kiss and their last; their last kiss had been all anger and teeth and had started and ended with fighting. This kiss was all pressure and warmth and the slow movement of Harry’s mouth against Malfoys.
Malfoy gave him a kind, if pitying, look. But as Harry studied his face, he thought he caught a glimpse of something else in his eyes – pain, or a strange vulnerability, quickly masked. Malfoy walked away, tossing a quick, “see you, Potter,” over his shoulder.
“Can you just like, shut up for one second?” Malfoy said, and suddenly he looked nervous. “Okay, Potter? Because I just - well, I just wanted to talk to you, without the other two-thirds of the bloody Golden Trio watching us!”
“Yes, well, it’s such a jolly good time to humiliate the Death Eater, you know,” Malfoy said bitterly.
“You didn’t bring up the War, did you, Harry?” She’d asked. “You know how hard it's been for him since the Trials.”
“Right,” he managed, mind spinning.
Then Malfoy bit down, hard, on Harry’s lip. Harry yelled, rearing backwards, the iron-laced taste of blood filling his mouth.
“Malfoy, I…” He’s ready to apologize, frantic, ready to see the anger in Malfoy’s face. But Malfoy’s face was drained, pale… Harry realized with a burst of shock that Malfoy looked deeply, terribly sad. And somehow, that was a million times worse.
It was a hint to the nature of Ron, Hermione, and Harry’s long friendship that they didn’t even look surprised when he showed up in the common room dripping blood.
“I didn’t mean – well, I’m sorry, Malfoy,” he said softly.
Harry did know. Maybe that was why he’d kissed him.
Harry just had so much want inside him, it was filling him up and he was pretty sure one of these days it was going to spill out onto his face and then everyone would know that he was in love with Draco Malfoy.
But then Malfoy was kissing him, and Harry found that he didn’t really care about what he had been trying to say anymore, because Malfoy was cupping his jaw with his hand and kissing Harry soft and sweet and slow, like Harry was his everything.
Harry was too full of feelings to really hear Malfoy – embarrassment and confusion from his rejection, relief from hearing that he hadn't just forced himself on the other boy, and anger at whoever had messed with him.
How was he supposed to not kiss him when Malfoy sat so close to him, when he looked at him like that, when he called him Harry in a low voice.
“Got it out of my system?” Harry suddenly felt as if he had been dropped in the middle of some sort of nightmare. He had no idea what Malfoy was talking about. Why was he going on about being friends? Harry didn’t want to be friends. Harry wanted to hold Malfoy down and kiss him until the other boy was gasping and breathless. Harry wanted to wake up with Malfoy wrapped around him.
Well. Hearing it possibly confirmed made the whole situation entirely different. He supposed the only thing for it was to try to talk to Malfoy, as much as that idea made him nauseous. He could really use some of that old Gryffindor courage.
“Well, Potter,” Malfoy said briskly. “I suppose now that you’ve had your fun, you’ll leave me alone? I let you kiss me, it was nice – “
Harry realizes that he’s being given a confession. He realizes that its making him feel better, barely, that someone else knows. Ron knew, but only a little, Hermione maybe less. Ginny knew, but he’d never known how to ask her.
“Excited to poke around in the ruins of all my other romantic relationships?” Harry snaps, almost willing to ask Draco if he can try Legilimency one more time. It would only give him a headache, but maybe it would make him feel less stupid.
“That would have been my call, two days scrubbing desks for that kind of attitude,” Ron added, fist bumping Harry in agreement. “Calling Ernie hopeless is cold.”
Hermione, as it turned out, was paired with Blaise Zabini, earning her a maudlin look from Ron that sent her into giggles. Ron ended up with Justin Finch-Fletchley, who Harry remembered being a fairly good dancer if nothing else.
“They’re your memories, if you aren’t responsible I’m not sure who is,” Harry says, growing tired of the way that Draco works so hard to hold himself at arm’s length. They’re partners, they can’t tip toe around each other forever.
“Harry’s from America, he’s talking about American football,” Draco offers before Harry can blunder through an answer, prompting Harry to kick him in the foot, because he doesn’t know anything about american football either.
“Alright, hun,” Belinda says as he slinks back out, feeling found out and nervous about everything. He’s not entirely sure what he’s looking for but a run down repair shop is a better lead than he’s had in years.
“Nope, can’t get my head to be quiet,” he replied, swirling his pumpkin juice in his glass. He needed to stop zoning out, so they’d stop having this conversation. He gave her his best smile and felt something in him exhale in relief when she took his hand in hers.
“Is he always like this?” Harry asks.
After a silence in which Hermione stood her ground very deliberately, Ron tensed, and Harry silently pled with Draco to be nice, Draco seemed to find her words. “Is it supposed to mean something?” she asked in genuine confusion, “The colors are nice but I really don’t understand the point?”
“Maybe,” Harry replies, and it’s the truth. “I don’t like guys. I don’t.”
Draco sips at the last dregs of his milkshake and doesn’t respond. Despite the seriousness of the situation, Harry is still moderately impressed by the speed with which he’s put away so much ice cream.
“Yes I am,” Draco says, then frowns. If he survives this party, he’s going to take a long bath and contemplate the series of unfortunate choices that landed him in this situation. This was not the plan. The plan was to be coerced into kissing Harry in a way that allowed him to remain cool, collected, and entirely blameless. “Yes I am,” he clarifies, “Because I don’t want to kiss Harry? I am not interested in kissing Harry. Under no circumstances would I be interested.” He finds himself looking at Hermione, who looks moderately stunned and like she feels a bit sorry for him, which is the last way any member of the Golden Threesome should be looking at him. “Anyway, now that we’ve settled that, everyone go back to your party games. Ginny, why do you have those kiwis? For what reason?”
“Nose,” Harry says.

“You’re hurt,” Draco says finally, reaching out to rest his fingers resting lightly on Harry’s chin, tilting his face up so he can examine the cut. It hadn’t been deep, but it had bled all over his uniform when it had happened. It was comparatively much better than last year, when he was laid up for a week while his body remembered how to work with all of his blood on the inside. There hadn’t even been broken bones this time, only a variety of scrapes and bruises and the stiffness of a fading fight.
ible. It feels like being splinch
“I only wear cashmere,” Draco replied airily. “But it does look warm.”
Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes, which will only make Draco bristle further. “I thought as much.”
“Ravenclaws,” Harry said with a shake of her head, and Ron and Hermione nodded in agreement.
As he and Ron made themselves comfortable at the Gryffindor table, Harry wondered briefly why he and Ginny hadn’t gone the same way. He couldn’t pin point a specific reason for why he never felt that pull again, though he’d tried to explain it to Ginny, who had looked at him with sympathetic eyes like she understood better than he did.
“Approval,” Draco said, reaching out to touch tree bark, suddenly certain. He could feel, just under the bark, just beyond the physical presence of the tree, the pulsing magic of the forest. It felt almost familiar somehow, like it was a fun house mirror of his own, like they were almost kindred.
He blows almost-smoke-rings and rubs his fingers over the dead flesh of the dark mark. It used to be so sensitive, used to feel like fire when he brushed up against it and now it doesn’t feel at all, which is disorienting. If he smokes three cigarettes it’ll be good luck. One for Mother, one for Blaise, one for Pansy. One for today, one for yesterday, one for tomorrow. All three, just for him.
“Could have fooled me,” Harry said, and then felt a rush of guilt at the discomfort in Draco’s expression. He didn’t look disgusted, more lost, like he was walking into something he didn’t understand. “Sorry, that’s not fair.”
“I didn’t want that either!” Draco shrieked back, her hands balled in fists as her cheeks went bright pink just like they always did.
“Hello! Ministry business, please open up!” Dara calls, giving the door another authoritative series of knocks.
of this is fair.
Malfoy, maybe Draco, shrugs. “Maybe I don’t want you to, Mr. Hero complex.”
It wasn’t until all his housemates had gone to bed that he pulled on his loafers and tip toed out of his room, through the deserted common room, and out to the Forest.
Harry thinks she might be inferring something, but he doesn’t have the energy to correct her, especially not when Draco sits down on his other side with a stumble.
Draco nods sagely. “I should go as well. Thank you for your help, both of you.”
It’s a whisper of fear and barely being able to reach the top cabinet. It’s a deep crushing sadness. He had forgotten it. He had forgotten the sadness. He wants to leave. He wants to leave. He wants to leave and he is so sorry, someone is so sorry, and he’s pushing and they’re spiraling up again, out of memories until he’s sitting in a chair across from Draco feeling absurdly torn apart.
Harry,
“It’s performance art,” Ron said, tugging a bit at the yarn so Ginny listed to the side. “We’re trying to one up the Ravenclaws.”
“We should head inside, it’s getting cold,” Harry murmured when they broke apart for breath, their lips numb and the warming charm beginning to dissipate as its caster became too distracted to maintain it.
Harry has questions but he doesn’t ask them, even though they’re burning in his throat, and maybe he’s not as fiery as he used to be either. There aren’t any words that convey both that he’s sorry about everything and also that seeing Malfoy makes him feel like he’s eleven again. There’s no way to ask ‘don’t you feel like we’re somehow connected, like we were points of symmetry on different sides of the same line?’ or ‘wouldn’t things have been different if you hadn’t been such a self-obsessed prick or if I’d just taken your fucking hand?’
“You could ask Anthony if he’s out a date. You didn’t seem to hate dancing with him too much,” Hermione said. “If he’s forgiven you for inadvertently sticking him with Ernie.”
“What are you doing for Christmas?” Harry asks offhandedly, kicking a ball of ice down the sidewalk, arm looped through Draco’s. Draco is trying his hardest to protect the flowers and he keeps dipping down to smell them, although Harry thinks he might be pretending not to.
“Yeah, yes,” Harry says, as if he’s only just then remembered how to string a sentence together. “Definitely. Let’s go.”
“Granger maybe?” Draco asked ponderously, locking his heart tight, not thinking, only performing. Once, he had been very good at it. “Wouldn’t surprise me, neither of them have much taste.”
Draco laughs softly and Harry grins into his shoulder. “It’s going to be okay,” he mumbles into the fabric of Draco’s sweater and is answered with a kiss pressed to the skin just below his ear.
Real Harry had always seemed to like the forest. He had been so irritatingly calm when they’d been taken there for detention with Hagrid, and Draco wondered if he still liked it so much after all the evil that had happened there. He didn’t actually know how Harry felt about the war, how he was doing, and it bothered him to think both that he didn’t know and that he cared about knowing.
Her pout deepened and she leaned up against him to try and offer comfort. “But you’re sleeping again.”
“Save me from Death Eaters and we’re still on a last name basis?” Harry teases a little aggressively, following him back through the curtain into the fluorescent light of the shop. There are certain moments from the war that stick out to him and that’s one of them, the fear in Draco’s face as he mumbled that he couldn’t be sure whether or not it was Harry.
“See, you are a sad boy,” Ellen replies, and Harry can’t tell if she knows who he is or not. He suspects that Ellen is Draco’s squib friend, but calling him a sad boy doesn’t mean she knows he defeated the dark lord and he doesn’t know how to address that.
“Harry, we won!” she said, once she’d looked up and identified her rescuer. Draco leaned up against her, resting her chin on Harry’s shoulder without preamble, as if this was something they had done before and not the weirdest thing Harry had ever walked into. “You are much better than the Ravenclaw seeker but you are not a good dancer and you are not funny.”
Draco made his way quickly through the forest, past the low hanging fruit and the warmth, his heart in his throat. The day had slipped by in a queasy rush of Harry and speculation and the constant checking of his watch before he finally slipped out. He could feel terror, the emotion familiar and metallic at the back of his throat. He’d gotten the knowledge he wanted even if it made the whole thing a deception. He knew Harry should know, but also that they’d only slip out of the forest unscathed if he didn’t. It was too late for Draco, but maybe not for him.
Draco blinks at him, exhaustion and confusion mingling in his expression. “You’re such an aggressively good person,” he says finally, refocusing on his doodling.
Draco was too tired to be entertaining thoughts of Potter’s eyes. The truth was that when his life began to tear at the seams he’d begun to hide from going to bed like a child. He’d wander and moan and hide from the bad dreams like if he didn’t go to sleep they wouldn’t come for him. It was in this way during the late fall of their eighth year that he discovered the Forbidden Forest. Or, alone in the night, allowed it to discover him.
“A surprise for me too,” Draco adds. Watching them go back and forth is bringing Harry so close to the brink of hilarity that he almost can’t stand it. He thinks if they wanted to make this a very serious debrief, they could be trying a whole lot harder.
I wonder if they’d let you visit the manor if you asked. I feel like that’s the sort of privilege they’d afford to you. They have it under guard now, I think if they weren’t so afraid of the house they’d have sent us all to Azkaban already. They’re so skittish, I suspect they’re under the impression that as soon as the Malfoys leave the Manor there will be some horrible House of Usher event and the whole thing will collapse into the ground. I almost hope it does.
Draco smiles, looking more than a little bit pleased with himself. He’s started jerking himself off and looks far more self-satisfied and beautiful doing it than Harry thinks should be allowed. “You don’t just want to watch me?”
54. “Blood runs thicker than water,” Harry says, long after it stops being necessary, just to hear Draco say his part back.
“Clearly not!” Draco said, lashing out to hit one of the branches, and then scowling at it when he got it briefly caught on his sleeve.
After dinner he went back into the forest with a crushing sense of deja vu, walking to some kind of death through darkness. The weather was snapping back down close to freezing, Harry’s nose chilly against the wind and his breath curling and smoky in the night.
“Mother takes tea very seriously,” Draco says, then tilts his head a bit to the side like he’s thinking of something else. “We indulge her.” He seems to shake the thoughts from his head, holding his arms out for Harry to take. “Ready to side along?”
Draco worries his bottom lip with his teeth and then the side of the chair with his fingernails. “So you can keep an eye on me.”
“Don’t fucking do that!” he said, sounding so genuinely alarmed that the snake slithered off of him and draped itself around a nearby branch to watch.
“You can go home if you want, Dara,” Harry says, digging around in his endless Auror pack for a shock blanket to cover up the arse in question. “I know Jess has her recital in the morning.”
“I really do,” Ron said, squinting at the bruise. “This is some dark fucking magic.”
“You should tell him all of it,” the snake said, soft silvery voice in his mind. “He’d care, he’s like that.”
Draco’s holds completely still as he comes, making a series of vulnerable, breathy noises into Harry’s shoulder. Harry, mercifully, doesn’t say the first thing that comes to his mind, which is “Oh, did that work?” as Draco relaxes against Harry’s chest, sliding his arms around his middle. Harry is fairly sure this is a strategy to prevent him from being looked at, which won’t do at all, so he wiggles out of Draco’s embrace. He looks incredibly debauched and not considerably cleaner than when they’d gotten in the shower, his eyes glassy and a bright flush decorating his cheeks.
“What does she think you’re doing?” Harry replies, then feels like he’s overstepped.
“I can’t figure out if I should be asking you what the sexiest thing I do is or telling you to kiss me if you actually want to shut me up,” Harry says, taking Draco by the hand and pulling him through his bedroom and into the bathroom.
“I didn’t know she was so into dancing,” Hermione said, using her free hand to comb her fingers through Harry’s messy hair. “It seems to go beyond her normal melodrama.”
“Just watching everyone,” Harry said, just a little pleased to have Draco’s undivided attention again. Watching her interact with the Gryffindors was thrilling, if quite stressful. Draco seemed determined to play nice, but it was still an exercise in hoping no one snapped and decided to fist fight. “I can’t knit, so.”
Some part of me hopes you’ll feel it when I die. I hope it feels like a string you’ve been holding onto finally snapping and bouncing back to sting your fingers. I don’t even care if you know what the feeling is or why you feel that way, I just want you to be aware that something has passed. I can’t fathom that you wouldn’t feel it.
“Noted,” Harry says, just as a bright green frog and/or toad comes ribbiting across the path. He absolutely should have checked the particulars of this before they came. “No problem with that. Totally fine. May we come in and ask you a few questions? We’re part of the potion regulation division and know that you supply ingredients to a few different potioneers, is that right?”
“Sorry its just, I don’t like her? I think she’s infuriating, sure, but it’s not the same thing,” Harry replied, glancing up at the clock to find it was ticking close enough to eight that she could flee. “It’s time for my dance lesson anyway. Let’s hope I come back with all my limbs.”
“So I see,” Draco replies, looking like he’s trying very hard to tamp down his smile as he takes them, giving them a smell. “Lilac, Phlox, and red Rose? How romantic.”
“In real life you hate me,” Harry said, wishing that all of his arguments didn’t seem quite so weak in the dark. “It’s not okay for me to be doing all this with you, even if-” He stopped, tried to collect himself. “It’s not fair for me to come here and kiss you if the real you doesn’t want to kiss me. It’s not fair to me or you.”
Snape is quiet. “I have not seen him since he came back. He might be.”
“It is,” She snarls. “I should’ve been smarter – I shouldn’t have let him trick me like that. I knew he didn’t want me. He couldn’t.”
, knowing that his family is safe.
He shakes his head and gets off Harry with shaky legs.
The events of the wedding – however long ago that was – come back to him in what feels like a punch to the gut. He turns to the side and vomits.
in the same bed. That’s it!”
Hermione frowns and rests her elbows on her knees.
“What?”
“It probably makes it hotter.” Noah says.
“What?” Ron asks. “When?
He sits in the edge of the Black Lake – and he
“What?” he asks, uncomfortable.
“Shut up! Why would I want to hear that?” Ron says. “I don’t want to hear

have kids.”
Then, Narcissa orders food, and the waitress leaves again.
Parkinson’s cheeks redden, and she looks away. Harry thinks she might look sad, but he can never tell with Slytherins.
“Well, I assume you don’t want it there,” he says with raised eyebrows. “So how do we get it out? Do we have to, like, send you to St. Mungo’s or something, because I’ve got to tell you mate, their food is absolutely ridiculous.”
“I’m sorry, Gin.” Ron says finally. “I shouldn’t have made that choice for you. And I should’ve told you everything sooner.”
McGonagall’s lips tighten. “And Mr. Malfoy-” everyone freezes. “Weasley. Mr.
“Alright, alright!” Ron snaps. His whole face is red, and Harry, Hermione, and Draco all burst out laughing. “I don’t want talk about that. I don’t want to even
Draco pulls away abruptly.
you-”
Draco flips him off.
“Are you okay?” he asks. “Where have you been? Does anything hurt?”
“You don’t have to stay,” Mrs. Thomas tells him. “You can just walk out. Tell that husband of yours that you love him.”
Draco nods jerkily. There’s a few seconds of silence in which Ron takes in Draco’s face fully. His nose is still bleeding, and his lower lip is split. There’s a cut across his right eyebrow, and there’s a quickly darkening bruise around his right eye. There are bruises on his jaw, and a small cut across one of his cheekbones.
Draco nods. “What’ll we do next?”
“I knew, too.” Ginny confesses.
She evidently sees Draco’s and Harry’s confused faces, because she pets the pink thing in her arms and waves a hand.
“Yeah. Yes, I’d like that.” Draco says, smiling.
Draco chews on his lower lip thoughtfully.
When the class is over, Draco walks to Lupin’s desk, only to be ignored until the room is empty.
McGonagall gives him a disapproving look, and Harry crosses his arms defensively.
Nothing has caught Draco’s eye yet. He doesn’t know if something should’ve.
. “If the memory doesn’t work, maybe you should change it. Isn’t there another one where you’re very happy?”
McGonagall gives him a look. “Mr. Weasley
you’re
Ever since he started spending more time with Draco his feelings for him shifted from friendship to something bigger, but he doesn’t know if it’s love. He doesn’t want Draco dating anyone who isn’t him, that’s for sure, and alright, whenever he looks at him there’s this sort of fluttering in his chest that sort of makes him feel like he might fly, right there without a broom, and when everything’s too much Draco just makes it somehow quiet down, be manageable, and he makes his nightmares go away, and he’s kind, and gorgeous, and funny, and an insufferable brat when he wants to be, and Harry’s three hundred percent sure that’s the man he wants to spend the rest of his life with, have babies, adopt six million stray dogs because Harry can’t ever say no to them, but that’s not
“I swear to all Gods,” A deep voice says. “Harry had told me you tended to find trouble, but this is just ridiculous!”
McGonagall’s eyes flash angrily in the same way Draco’s did this morning, and Harry almost feels like laughing. The pounding pain running across his scar stops him though. It hasn’t stopped hurting since it flashed while they were in the middle of their visit to Dumbledore.
“Nothing really happened,” he says, shrugging. “I almost failed Potions.”
Ron is beside him now, and he’s saying something, but Harry can’t concentrate on it.
know, is that climate change is something very real that’s happening. The environment is collapsing, and the best thing we can do to help it is
“Parkinson!” Harry snaps, and Ron realizes Parkinson and Zabini are standing there, looking worriedly. “What the bloody hell is going on?”
“Hey Blaise!” they hear Draco’s voice from outside. “Have you seen my wand? I’m leaving.”
what Draco wanted to avoid, so he opens his mouth to protest. Before he can, however, they’re already walking out.
“Harry could never think that of you!” Ron says. Draco peeps at him through the gaps of his fingers, and Ron grins a bit. “Well, maybe he would. But not because of that.”
“Voldemort made Horocruxes.” He says. “They’re – you put pieces of your soul into things, and they keep it there. It’s made him immortal, at least until they’re all destroyed.”
He’s hurt that his parents never told him, and he wonders if it matters to them. If they wanted him at all in the first place. Did they want to keep him? Did someone in the ministry force them to take him in because he’s the child of a former death eaters?
After
They’d threatened him with it; even gone as far as to use one of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes’ ‘realistic werewolf bite’ on Draco’s arm to convince him he’d bitten Draco. He’d eaten it up like candy.
“Where else would we hide?” Zabini asks, rolling his eyes. “If we leave the room and either of them change their minds, they’ll know the wand’s gone.”
Hermione lifts a shoulder. “We look for the Horocruxes we can. We can begin trying to destroy the diadem, see if something works. But until they speak to Dumbledore… there’s not much we can do.”
“Yeah,” he says, distracted. “Maybe in a bit.”
Ron had been both surprised and confused – since when was Draco in love with Harry and why the hell hadn’t he noticed? – but Gin and Hermione had immediately started squealing happily.
“It can be anything.” Potter shrugs. “A birthday, maybe? Christmas, some sort of Holiday?”
time. He feels too skinny in her arms, lighter than he used to be, and it’s all wrong. It feels all wrong.
Ron is suddenly hit by the terrifying idea that she might come back after the war’s ended. That she might want to take his baby brother away from them. He couldn’t bear it. He wouldn’t let her.
love you-”
“That doesn’t help.” Luna is the only one who looks unaffected.
Harry stands too, glaring, and Hermione steps out of their way, frown deepening.
They get out of people’s way – Diagon’s completely full with parents buying their children’s things – and stand outside of Flourish and Blott’s, where Draco’s family goes into.
The scratching intensifies, and Harry takes his hand to stop him. Neither pulls away, and it’s sort of awkward, holding hands, but Draco’s almost swooning over the contact, however small it is.
He doesn’t know how to exist without her.
” Molly asks.
The first thing they do is
Pansy shrugs. “You can call me hopeless all you like, but if you cook for me I’ll literally cry of joy.”
“It was not that close,” It was. “And not all Ravenclaws are nerds!”
And Harry looks at them and he realizes that no matter what happens – if he’s a Horocrux, if he’s not,
“Yeah. No record of him again. It’s useless. I shouldn’t have even told you about it.” She says quickly. “I’m starving, and the food here is atrocious. You guys stay here, I’ll go get us something to eat, yeah?”
At McGonagall’s disapproving look, he tries an innocent smile.
She’d never. She’s been threatening Draco with that since he was a first year and he used to love sneaking out to the forbidden forest to feed the creatures – honestly, it’s a miracle he didn’t somehow end up dead – but she’d never actually do it. Draco’s pretty sure.
He certainly never thought he could do this.
They’ll have to kill Nagini, they’ve already talked about it, but they haven’t talked about killing Harry.
The anger’s faded by now, mostly, but all that Draco’s left with is a sort of emptiness that’s expanded through his chest and the worst identity crisis he’s ever had. He’s not a Malfoy – he refuses to be – but he doesn’t feel much like a Weasley either, so he’s floating in a sort of limbo he
He flees to the safety of his bed, and only gets up when he has to shower to meet Ginny in Hogsmeade. He dresses in a warm jumper and muggle denims and meets her in front of Honeydukes.
Draco feels his cheeks heat, and his stomach flutters. He could honestly hit himself with how pathetic he’s being.
“There’s no point in
They change into their pajamas, and afterwards, just lie in bed quietly.
“Hypothetically, let’s say they do. Why is it bothering you?” He asks. “Everyone knows things we don’t. Just like we know things they don’t.”
“Mate?” Ron hands him a glass of water. “Drink up, and then talk to us.”
“He married Potter!” Nott spits out the name like it’s physically hurting him. “He married Potter, he had a son! You knew the prophecy-”
“I know,” Draco rubs at his forehead. “I just – I don’t know. I feel like they’re hiding it from me specifically.”
“Fine.” He mutters.
There’s a beat of silence.
“I’m telling the truth and you know it.” Malfoy says behind him.
Harry laughs. “I am, too.”
Draco frowns and follows him, because however furious he is, he wants an explanation.
Ginny’s looking for him, too, and she catches his eye. She gives him what he supposes was supposed to be a relaxed smile, but it comes out more troubled and worried than she meant it to. He smiles back weakly.
“No.” Hermione says disgruntled. “The charm failed, and it didn’t notify me when he changed locations. However, I think it might still be active.”
“What?” he asks, disoriented.
“Yeah.” He says. “I’ll do that. Definitely. Practice.”
“Shit,” Zabini mutters, grabbing the wand from Hermione. Harry throws his invisibility cloak over Ron and Hermione, and moves to get under it.
Draco glares and flips two fingers her way. She just laughs even more.
McGonagall gives them the scolding of Draco’s entire life. He has to sit in the chair and just
“You’ve known since you were seven?” Molly asks. “You never said anything!”
They’re all standing around awkwardly while Draco sits in his bed, and he cocks an eyebrow.
“We’re here for you, Harry.” She says. “Don’t be stupid. You can talk to us.”
It’s true, and Harry feels a pang of guilt go through him. They’ve been sleeping in the same bed for a while now, and Harry always stays in bed until Draco wakes so the blond will think he sleeps as much as he does, but truth is, he often doesn’t sleep at all.
“I, uh.” She seems to steady herself for a moment. “I knew.”
“Why were you with Smith anyway?” Harry asks. “Is that really who you’re hanging around?”
“I love you,” he says, a little uselessly, a little hopelessly. “And I wish you were here.”
Harry tries, he really does, but when he feels Snape pushing into his mind he doesn’t even know
Her face is hard, and Draco somehow knows, this is not a woman that can be messed with. She reminds him of Ginny, and Pansy, and Hermione; fierce, decisive, deadly when they have to be.
“Then what’s the problem?” she asks, because she can always tell; they’ve been best friends for practically their entire lives, it’s insulting for him to think he can hide things from her.
He can see Harry’s vivid green eyes even in the dark, staring at him from the next bed over.
"Good morning and Welcome to Florean Fortescue's," Says Florean Fortescue with a smile. Draco appreciates that he's always cheery. "What can I get you?"
“They all expect it.” Malfoy says. “They raised you and even then, they all expected you to turn into a death eater. It’s what they all think of you.”
“I can’t do this while you’re shagging Nott.” Harry tells him.
He thinks of Draco, and he
“Whoa!” Harry catches him by the waist, hugs him tightly. “It’s alright. It’s alright, I’m alright, I’m fine.”
He knows Smith is the one who started the rumor about Draco blowing Theo in the showers the year prior. And it was complete Hippogriff shit, and Draco knows Smith knows it. The only reason he started that rumor was because Draco refused to go out with him, and Smith had called him a slag for it.
“No, not really.” Harry grins. “
It will, Harry thinks, but he doesn’t say anything. The Slytherins don’t respond either.
“Is he the only living Malfoy?” Pansy asks, ignoring their bickering.
“I’ve already
It’s… everything. Draco doesn’t know how to describe it. It’s urgent and relaxed at the same time, it’s soft, and firm, and warm, and kind, and
“It could-” he begins, but before he can continue, there’s a hand at the back of his neck, gripping tightly, and a long-suffering sigh.
Draco scoffs and rolls his eyes, but he can’t think of anything to say.
There aren’t a lot of people in the street – no one wants to be outside with everything that’s been happening; there’ve been several death eater attacks since they escaped back in September, and people haven’t been feeling safe – and the ones that are outside are talking about the death eaters or Voldemort.

“Smith wouldn’t leave me alone.” He says. His jaw tightens and he upturns his nose, something he does when he’s daring Ron to tell him he’s done the wrong thing. “She told me to take care of myself. Breaking Smith’s nose is as close as I can get to that.”
dying,” Sirius snaps. “And you cannot save every one of them.”
Thomas rolls his eyes and shakes his head. “We’re not talking about this, okay? This isn’t even a possibility. Nice ghost story, and all, but we should just go to sleep. The teachers will probably explain it to us in the morning, okay? It’s fine. We’re all fine.”
There’s a touch on his arm, and Draco rips around, anger like a wave at being interrupted, ready to kill whoever’s broken his concentration.
Harry frowns worriedly. “I said you should get some sleep, you look exhausted.”
“I’m glad,” he says, even if he knows it’s a lie. Part of being with Draco is, sometimes, letting him lie. Letting him keep his own space.
“Merlin, the mood here has sure gone downhill.” Ginny mutters. She forces herself to smile brightly. “How’ve you been? What’s been going on with Harry?”
He catches sight of Ginny, too, even though she and Draco were told to go home by their parents. It confirms his suspicions that her and Draco soundly ignored that order, and he doesn’t know why it makes him smile, however briefly.
“That’s not going to work, princess.” The man informs him, and, as he’s dragged outside, Draco freezes in horror.
“I just-” Harry stops and exhales roughly, but he doesn’t look at Draco. “Look, it’s okay. I don’t – you don’t owe me to go out with me or anything-”
“Are you alright?” He asks.
“Let’s go.”
“Mate, I’m trying to eat here,” Ron complains, throwing a couple of crisps at Harry.

something, and not simply waiting for death, like at the manor.
“He woke up a few hours ago.” He says. “But his head hurt. The healers didn’t manage to take all of the pain away, but enough for him to fall asleep.”
,” more like forced, by the tone she says it in. “That they send Dementors to guard the castle. They’ve no reason to harm you, but do try to stay away from them.”
Draco thinks the image would’ve amused him, at some point; Greyback in a red leash that Voldemort is holding, sitting like a good crup at his side. Right now, it doesn’t even make him smile, but knowing that it – at some point – would’ve, is comforting.
“Hi, Dragon,” She murmurs.
“We don’t have a lot of time, love.” She says. “Do you remember, there’s a nursery song you used to love? About the Magpies.”
, he can’t think.
He leaves her office feeling more helpless than he felt when he went in it.
to sleep with. Charlie’s, Bill’s, and Percy’s rooms are not being used at the moment, but Draco’s not dumb enough to go into any of them. Charlie’s left enough Dragon related things there when he’s come back home, and some of them are very fragile, and Bill’s a fucking curse-breaker, and he’s not very neat. Draco doesn’t want to end up cursed.
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooo...... spectacular enough blow up??

“McGonagall and Remus… they think I’m a Horocrux, too.” He says. “When he tried to kill me and it rebounded, he left a piece of his soul in me.”
“He didn’t show me the others, after the first one, but he thought they were from a spy, or a prisoner.” He explains. “They just said what the death eaters were up to.”
Her lips purse. “Your dads wanted to protect you. Draco and Potter died to protect you.”

“I don’t have to touch you.” Luna says. “Can you speak? I want to sit next to you.”

?” the other three shriek.
“I won’t.” Draco says.
As it is, against his better logic, he runs his hand softly through Harry’s hair, smiling lightly at the approving moan he gets in return. Of course he’ll be here when Harry wakes up. He’d never deny him anything.
“Hey,” Draco says, and Harry immediately brightens up.
about my little brother’s sex life!”
They continue quietly freaking out until they both run out of breath.
“Alright, alright.” Molly mutters. “You all need a warm meal and then a nap. Come on.”
“Point to Harry.”
Fleur laughs and throws a pillow at him.
She comes closer, and Draco can’t bring himself to move. She’s wearing black robes and a black hooded cloak, and when she pulls back the hood she’s blonde and looking at him with tear-filled, icy blue eyes.
“Well, I don’t,” Draco says. His face abruptly brightens, and he gasps. “You know what we should do?”
“I’ll begin.” Draco says. “I don’t think we should have kids, Harry. We’ve been married for a
?” Both Harry and Ron ask.
“Children,” Hermione says. “Don’t do it.”
“Don’t,” Draco murmurs, curling into his side. He looks young, small, terrified. “Don’t tell them anything.”
“The diadem!” Draco says. “The Horocrux, I did it, I found a way to destroy it!”
Remus and McGonagall look at each other, a silent conversation between them that Harry can’t understand.
“She’d say yes,” Draco continues, as if Ron hadn’t interrupted. “If you asked her.”
There’s suddenly a hand on his forearm, and Draco flinches violently, scrambling away from it immediately, pressing himself against the wall.
And well, that statement makes Harry more jealous than he’s been in his life. Part of him says that it’s not
of them? I knew I shouldn’t have let you run away from that conversation-”
Draco doesn’t respond.
“Ron, I figured it wasn’t my place.” She says, looking away and brushing her hair away from her face. “I didn’t-”
“Let’s start looking, then,” she says.
She trails off. Cocks her head. Looks at Harry. Hermione and Ron look at him, too.
about?” Draco asks.
Sooo i've had an insane first few weeks of school but don't worry babes, i haven't abandoned this story <33
The man grins, and he lets go of them as soon as they exit Knockturn Alley.
Draco needs her to slow down a bit, to stop shoving information down his throat. He needs a bit of time to process, to think about this and figure out what he thinks about it.
“Hi.” He says. He tries not to sound like a complete idiot as he continues. “Are you – is it – how are you?”
“You’re not.” Draco says drily.
“I love you, Draco.” She says. “I love you, you must remember that.”
Draco begins moving.
After another worried look at him, Potter clears his throat.
“Does something hurt?” She asks worriedly. “Is everything alright? Charlie healed you, but if there’s something wrong-”
“And I’ve wondered so many times if I made the right choice, and I know I did.” She says. “It hurts me so much, but I know I did. The Weasleys, they

him then, for a long time.
“Okay, so not a very smart prisoner,” Pansy says. “Or maybe they thought you could do something.”
“It’s not that simple.” She says harshly.
It’s too quiet, but everyone hears it anyway. They all hug at the same time, and though still uncomfortable, Draco looks somewhat relieved. Then he sees Harry.
“No, he doesn’t. We’re just friends.” He says. “And no, Ron wouldn’t.”
“To your classes, now.”
happy
“Sending an owl.” Ron responds gruffly.
“Alright,” Mrs. Thomas nods, amicably enough. “But you two get on that, dear, it’s best to begin having kids as soon as possible.”
Snape doesn’t respond.
His struggles, now renewed, become more insistent, but Greyback only laughs and digs his claws in tighter until Draco whimpers, eyes filling with tears. He blinks them away quickly and tries to balance himself so that he’s walking instead of just letting Greyback drag him.
“Oh, don’t act all high and mighty!” Ron snaps. “Don’t act like what you’ve been doing is any better! Lying to Draco’s face and then turning right around and getting angry at me for doing the exact same thing-”
“You – you do know how it works though, right?” Harry asks awkwardly. “I mean, the basics?”
“No,” Harry agrees. “But you
Harry hums in agreement. He gets through potions without earning himself detention – though just barely, he almost throws his cauldron at Snape’s head – and then they go to lunch.
Someone left a note of it in his potions book. He doesn’t know who, and he doesn’t know how they knew, but he knows he needs to figure out who it was, and why they’re helping him. The adults don’t want them to be a part of it, he knows, and he also knows he’s in his sixth year, which means Rose is on her seventh year and it’s their last year here together. They need to figure things out
Things feel a lot more real after that.

want it, it’s just – at home, everyone is used to him; they know he’s a huge nerd, that he’s shy, that he needs glasses but forgets them more often than not, that he’s allergic to nuts and cacao and that he has dragon slippers that roar when he walks. Here, people either ignore him – which he’s fine with – or stare at him like he’s some all-powerful wizard because of what happened when he was a baby.
Draco realizes what he’s just said and stops breathing.
Healer Clearwater comes into the room along with a Mediwitch before Draco answers, and she ushers them away while she waves her wand with various muttered spells and takes Draco’s vitals.

There’s a loud scream, and then everything descends into chaos.

And dinner.
?” He asks.
“I-” he begins. “Oh.”
Draco’s mouth twists. “Why would a known death eater’s family crest get me to open a letter?”
“It’s not forever and ever.” Draco rolls his eyes, cheeks tainting faintly.
“If you don’t-” he begins.
“Mate, she’s Minerva McGonagall.” Noah says. “She could kill someone and I’d trust her judgement.”
Draco’s face is dirty, bruises mottled all over it, both fresh and new. The most recent one is on the side of his face, a week old at most; it looks oddly round, like a stick, or a pipe, the darkness of it contrasting strongly against already previously pale skin, that now seems even paler.
“Nothing.” Hermione waves it away. “It’s fine. Potions?”
Everyone looks at Potter.
“Mr. Weasley,” McGonagall takes her seat again. “I need you to be honest. I won’t tell the aurors, but I need to know. Have you been in contact with Lucius Malfoy before?”
“It’s not your business!” Draco stands angrily; he’s shorter than Ron, but when he stands he can at least not be properly looked down on. “You don’t even care!”
my husband sometimes, but we all have our rough patches.” Harry’s pretty sure one isn’t supposed to want to murder their spouse, but he’s not going to contradict her in the middle of her rant. “After that you sort of get used to hating them, so it gets better! Are you two-”
“He still avoiding you?” he asks.
“Do you feel that way?” Harry asks, frowning lightly.
“Blaise Zabini,” Scorpius tells them.

Draco shakes his head.
Draco snorts and shakes his head, half-shoving Harry’s shoulder before passing him the chocolate bar.
He fires the killing curse knowingly, at everyone who tortured him those long months at the manor. He sees his classmates –
Draco’s head is spinning.
Draco’s cheeks darken, and he looks away. “I duplicated it before I turned it in.”
For all that they tease him for being a Hufflepuff and say that he’s a softie and that he needs them – big, strong, Gryffindors to protect him – they all know that he shoots the meanest stinging hex any of them have experienced.
Draco takes a deep breath and nods. “Alright,”
“Thomas thinks Snape’s secret godson is Neville Longbottom. We say it’s absolute hippogriff shit.”
himself for it because he knows it’s cowardly.
Ron shrugs stiffly. There is silence for a while, and then, he sighs, rubbing at his forehead.
“Where the bloody hell were you?” he asks tightly, glaring at Draco.
“But his followers aren’t.” Noah says carefully.
about?” Draco asks.
“Not your business, Potter.” Smith sneers, and though his grip on Draco’s wrist lessens, he doesn’t let go.
Pansy eyes him warily and then looks back at the letter. She finishes reading it and passes it to Blaise, who reads it quickly.
Draco’s tense, Harry knows, even without looking at him. Riddle’s criminal organization has always been personal for him, because he practically grew up in it. His father, Lucius Malfoy, has been Riddle’s right hand man since the start, and Draco was being groomed to become everything his father was.

“About how Draco wanks while thinking of Potter,” Blaise says solemnly.
“He said yes!” Harry says, turning to him excitedly. Remus is glad to see him acting like this. With everything that’s been going on, Harry’s been quieter and quieter, and Remus wants him to be happy. He deserves it. Even if it’s the Malfoy kid.
“Hello, nephew.” Her grin is terrifying. “You and I are going to have so much fun.”
“Hullo.” She smiles.
“We need to warn McGonagall if we’re going.” Ron says. “It’ll be-”
Draco scowls at her weakly.
“Alright.” Ginny says uneasily; she closes the door and Harry can hear her walk away, and he sighs, relieved.
“If you-” Snape begins.
it is that happens next – these are his best friends, and they won’t leave him alone.
“You did more than anyone could’ve reasonably asked,” Draco tells him. He grabs his cheeks and kisses the top of his head, and then Harry kisses his temple. “You did more than you should’ve been responsible for.”
The sky outside is quickly darkening, and Draco chews on his lower lip. “Let’s go,”
“Sometimes the best thing we can do for our family is
Pansy sends a questioning look at Blaise.
“How long?” Draco asks.
“Yes,” He whispers.
Harry’s not, Draco knows. He’ll never see Draco that way.
He trails off.
“I won’t let him.”
She doesn’t appreciate him telling her so, but Scorpius doesn’t particularly care.
“There are a few things you need to know.” She says. “About who you are, and where you come from. More importantly, about why I left you.”
“I can’t. I – Voldemort wants to kill
“You look very tired,” Harry says worriedly. “Have you been sleeping well?”
Draco cracks a smile against her shoulder, and though she doesn’t see it, she feels it. “Honestly I thought you’d know better by now. No matter how many stupid shit I do, I don’t die.”
Granger hums thoughtfully.
“Alright,” he agrees. “So we’ll just have to do it in private, won’t we Harry?” he hums and runs his fingers teasingly through Harry’s chest. Harry’d like to pretend it doesn’t get to him, but, frustratingly, it does. He’s not a virgin, damn it, the ‘
“That’s good,” He says gently. “What did he say?”
“Mr. Weasley,” Lupin calls him after class one day. “I gather you’re having trouble with your Patronus?”
“What?” Harry asks.
“Uh.” He says. He puts on his best ‘good boy’ smile. “Hi Professor Sprout.”
“I – you – he-” Draco doesn’t even know what to say. “I thought he was you!”

, and Harry wants so badly to stay there. He thinks of Sirius and Remus, thinks of Ron, and Hermione, and Ginny, and knows he can’t, even if he wants to.
“Maybe he planned to smother him with a pillow.” Ginny shrugs. “Could be cleaner?”
Draco chokes on his toast.
There’s no name on the envelope, but Adam squints at the wax seal and runs a finger over it softly.
The Order of the Phoenix is reinstated, Scorpius knows. He also knows that he is banned from it. He has a long, loud argument about it with Remus and Sirius.
He’d woken up with this note on his nightstand; he doesn’t know who put it there – his dorm mates say it wasn’t them – and it didn’t take long to realize they’re Horocruxes. They already knew about Hufflepuff’s cup and the diadem, but they hadn’t known about the others.
“No curses. Nor any trace of magic, really.” Lupin says as he comes in.
of us dying,” Draco says, and his voice breaks. “I can find a way to destroy the Horcrux, I can, Harry, I know I can-”
“It’s a complicated charm.” Lupin notes. “You’ve nothing to be embarrassed about.”
He’s so
. At least not with everything that’s been happening.
Draco hums, non-comital.
“I am real.” Malfoy stands up too, even as Draco begins walking away stubbornly.
. But this does
“Eight for a wish, nine for a kiss, ten a surprise you should not miss,” she’s sounding more and more panicked by the moment, and her grip on his arm is tightening, but he doesn’t know what’s going on, how to help. “Eleven for health, twelve for wealth, thirteen beware it’s the devil himself.”
Draco found the diadem nearly a week and a half ago, when he spoke with the grey lady – but after a week of endless experimenting, he still hasn’t gotten any closer to destroying it, so he’d called Ginny in.
“Oh, don’t give me that look, Potter,” Malfoy sneered. “Don’t go getting the idea that you forced yourself on me or anything. Don’t get me wrong, I like blokes as much as you apparently do, and you’re fit enough, I suppose. And who wouldn’t want to kiss the Savior? You just shocked me those other times, is all. And, well,” here Malfoy looked a little embarrassed. “I thought maybe you might have been having me on, you know. To try to humiliate me. Wouldn’t be the first time that’s happened,” he muttered.
And he knew that this didn’t fix anything, that just because they could finally admit that there was something between them didn’t make them a perfect couple.
Like maybe - just maybe - Malfoy felt something like how Harry did. And Harry could hear the shocked gasps and whispers of the students behind him, as he wound his hands in Malfoy’s hair and let himself melt into Malfoy, into the height and strength of him.
He had been so sure that Malfoy wanted him to kiss him. But he hadn’t asked.
If there was one thing Harry couldn’t stand, it was when Malfoy didn’t make any bloody sense.
“No.” Harry scrubbed his hands through his hair. “No, it’s not, because I care about you, and you - you messed me up, okay? It hurt when you walked away. I haven’t - I didn’t -”
“I actually was wondering if it would be possible for us to talk, Potter, if you think you can handle that?”
Ron, who’d had to pull them apart, asked Harry what he’d done; “he’s not that bad anymore, y’know”, he’d said through a mouthful of toast. Even Hermione had remarked on how pale and shocked Malfoy had looked.
I’m in love with Draco Bloody Malfoy, he thought to himself.
“I -” Malfoy seemed to deliberate with himself. “I like you, Potter.”
Malfoy had kissed him back, and told him he was gay, and Harry wasn’t sure how he was supposed to forget the taste of Malfoy’s mouth, or the little noises he made when he was turned on.
“I - it was going so well,” he said weakly, not looking either of them in the eye. “I really thought he wanted it, but - well I didn’t ask, and I should’ve, Hermione. I know. But I just - and then he bit me.”
“No luck, mate?” Ron asked sympathetically, while Hermione pulled out her wand and briskly healed Harry’s lip. Harry dropped into an armchair and held his head in his hands.
Harry was painfully aware of the silence of the Great Hall behind them. “Do we really have to do this here, Malfoy? In front of the entire school?”
Leaving Harry standing there, dumbstruck, with blood filling his mouth.
