Harry doesn’t know precisely when others start coming more than he goes, but if he had to guess it’d be around when Teddy brings home Victoire and their firstborn daughter. The babe bursts through the fireplace shrieking, alighting the whole cabin aflame with her wails. Harry takes her from her frazzled parents and rocks her in his arms. He thinks that maybe having the time and space to love and be loved is the best magic of all.
Draco takes out the stamp pad from his drawer, unsure how to say that he half-expected a notice of Potter’s demise dropped off with his coffee this morning. He scans over the parchment before stamping it firmly and handing it back.
"It's the bloody Room of Requirement, isn't it? And it appears I'm in need of a corporeal set of hands."
"Close your eyes, then," Draco snorts from Sirius's bed. Harry wants him to take his shoes off, but he also doesn't want to fight.
"Dean says this place is good," Ron says, tucking into his seat and reading through the one-page menu with the same concentration he typically reserves for chess.
"It's the 23rd," Pansy said when she stepped through the Floo no less than ten minutes late to her own party. "A day of celebration. Your house was the obvious choice of venue. Good light, plenty of odd talking pieces, an eccentric recluse. That's you, if I wasn't clear. Relax, darling. Can't you see this house is dying to be seen? She's far too chic to keep hidden away."
Harry said he didn’t care what I looked like, I was rotten to the core. But in a good way. Everyone rots in the end. It was only trouble if you tried to stop.
Draco? Come over and sit next to me, will you? That’s a good boy. Breathe. You understand, don’t you? It’s for your own good. There’s nothing to forgive.
"Jesus," Harry says. "I'm sorry, alright? Don't have to bite my head off over every little thing I fuck up."
"That's what I love about it." Harry leaned in, heavy on Draco's shoulder. "But I have a confession. I stole my copy from you."
“He’s a vain one,” the guy next to Harry says. Dean’s Muggle friend; Harry forgets his name. “Showers every day. Gussies up his hair with product, even.”
Harry heads upstairs and finds Draco sprawled out over his bed, asleep under a ceiling still magicked to a perfect sunny day from that night a week ago. "A bit excessive," Pansy declared, but Draco said Harry could have anything he wanted.
Potter asked him where he was going, to which Draco replied, “Sorry I must have the wrong floor” and “Sorry about your divorce” and “Sorry about my whole life yeah okay good catching up,” and tried scrambling around Potter before remembering he was a bloody
Ginny stands and waves. Ron drops by their table and eats a fistful of chips in one go, which he washes down with the rest of Ginny's negroni.
Friday comes slow and goes even slower. Harry is bored enough to leave his house for a jog and let the paps chase him the whole five kilometres. He's still wired when he gets back, so he hops on his new stationary broom—a gift from BroomBod, delivered that morning—and does an hour ride. It's not fun (nothing like flying outdoors), but gets his mind off things. Afterwards, he goes through the motions of an actual shower, with water coming down from the faucet, for the first time in what must be weeks.
Harry Potter's dick felt about as good as anyone's, saintly or otherwise. The perfect girth for his own fist. Who'd have known that hand jobs would be the great equalizer. I sighed into the sheets, stomach tightening as the tension built, little zip-zaps fizzing down our spine and shocking us into completion.
Harry had owled his usual escort to meet him at the station by way of the Hogwarts Express. The attendant took his one bag and asked if he'd take a photo with him, for his niece, to which Harry obliged, crossing his arms and scowling at the camera in a way that, these days, was more patently him than his scar. The attendant handed him the photo to sign, and Harry obliged once more, though his quill stilled over his image. Never in his life would he understand what possessed people to want Harry Potter scribbled over a photo of a bearded man wearing dark sunglasses and a striped sweatband.
"Say it, and you can fuck me however you want. I'll even throw in a free blowie. I know how much you liked
These days, I use a gun. Untraceable. The numb nuts they hire at the DMLE don't know a bullet from a meat thermometer, let alone what I can do with six rounds and the right timing. And I've always been good at timing.
“I have this place under Fidelius, but there are ways to get around it. Once they know the proximity, they can —”
Draco went home and shelved the fresh additions, delighting in the glow they brought to his favourite corner of the house. He was sitting in the window and waiting for his tea to steep when he remembered a cozy book he read a week ago that would be perfect under the nook, warm as a blanket and twice as soft. He spent the night searching for it everywhere, under sinks and behind planters, between bags of rice and flour—nothing. He could've sworn he left it on his bedroom table, but still—nothing.
"And you did as you were told. Wild. Let me guess...it was either that, or he wouldn't suck your cock."
"Harry, you're not seriously going to—" Draco starts but shuts his mouth in a snap. His face relaxes, and he forces a smile. "I'm late for dinner, but I'll see you at the bar after," he says in an exacting, tempered voice. He shoves past them, disappearing down the hall.
Neville Longbottom showed up at Draco's door on the second to last Thursday of September and said, "Well? Are you going to let me in?" Then he shoved his way in and made himself at home before the fireplace.
"I stand by my innocence," Draco sniffed. He steadied his gaze on Harry, waiting for the usual witty repartee. But Harry's mouth stayed shut, his hands fidgeting with the hem of his jersey. His eyes met Draco's for a brief second, and then he was pulling the jersey off.
"Eager," Draco parrots. That wanker, always looking for an easy comeback. But he obliges, shifting Harry's weight over them so that the blunt tip of his cock presses against Harry's entrance and slowly, smoothly, presses in.
Lazy off-season mornings. Trips to the coast, dinner with friends. Telling the ref off even when his boyfriend's clearly in the wrong.
So it was like this, day in and day out. Mornings jerking off, a late breakfast with Kreacher. Walks out in the neighbourhood. The occasional dinner at the Burrow, where there was always enough said to say nothing at all. "You don't owe them anything. Not even the people you love," I said when we were back in bed again. Then we jerked off, little zap-zips so good, they left us shivering. Time passed like a dream. I'd have missed my own verdict if it wasn't for a chance glimpse of the headlines from a newsstand on a croissant run.
We went downstairs to the kitchen, where I reheated the chicken I made last night, and we ate it with sliced apples, because I forgot about the salad. Then we went to bed, and the next day arrived in the night.
good at buying stuff. I'm good at other things too," Draco says, pushing Harry down onto the bed and straddling his waist.
"I'm loyal," Harry says, getting to his feet in a panic. Bile rises up his throat and sours his mouth. "I'm not—"
The moment the Floo wards lock behind Ron, Harry skips the shower and heads straight to his bedroom. He takes the memory of Malfoy at the club into bed with him and savours it, rubbing his hand on the rough denim over his crotch and imagining Malfoy's mouth, hot against it. "Come on," he whispers into his pillows as his jeans constrict until he aches.
They wait outside because it's too hot, with their faces still flushed from the run. They watch the neighbourhood pass by them, some with their dogs, some on their phone. Then, finally, the barista calls Draco's name, and Harry gets up.
The kittens don’t like Harry yet. It’s only his third time over, and they’ve still a hiss of feral from the streets.
Malfoy's hair is hot violet-pink under the neon lights, shaved on one side but cascading long down the other. His arms are thrown around the thick neck of some bloke, and he keeps his eyes squeezed shut, his mouth moving to the music. Harry shifts his stance as he watches him, reluctantly intrigued and unable to look away.
"I almost like it better that you didn't know. Like it's fate," Draco says. "Like if it's out of my control, then I can stop second-guessing things and just give in to what I want." He takes a step closer, the vase still between them.
Harry follows all the way back to Draco's street two blocks off the park, where the streets quiet down, and there's plenty of parking for the lone coffee shop on the corner. Draco stops in front of his door, his chest heaving.
She nodded rigidly. And then I saw the room for what it was: rebellion, in the only way Mother knew how. She was like me: trapped. Except she was letting me escape.
"So we'll go back to my place instead, it doesn't matter. None of it matters, as long as I can get off."
Dobby rouses at his name, blinking open big brown eyes and shaking out noodly purple legs over sloppy initials—DLM. “Is Dobby really seeing Harry Potter?” he squeaks, his ears twitching.
Draco stops and stumbles on his own feet. He hunches over, catching his breath with his hands over his knees.
Harry drags his tongue down Draco's ear. "Let's go upstairs," he whispers. Draco shudders beneath him, nodding.
Harry writes up the report in his mind. “Patient docile. Potion effective. Philosophical babble—side effect.” He wonders if it’s a minor enough side effect that they’ll write it off, ink it on the bottle in small print. It’s not Harry’s choice, and Draco’s not hurting anyone. But he is hurting; Harry can see that because he knows Draco these days. He knows how much it hurt when Draco woke from the war a werewolf. How the lines hardened on his face like he aged twenty years in one. How they soften under Harry’s touch, like wax. Softening, but never melting. Pliable, but never yielding enough to reveal the child that hides within.
It's a weekday and still early in the night. The bartender keeps asking if Harry's waiting for someone, but Harry keeps shrugging and twitching and drinking and tapping his fingers on the counter until the bartender says, "If you like blonds, then my friend is one."
"That's a superb idea. Thanks very much, don't mind me as I take a peek—" Harry backed up, and there was the sound of hurried steps up the stairs.
"No thanks," Harry says to Hermione when she offers him her handkerchief. Parvati waits under an arch overflowing with pink and peach peonies as Lavender walks up the aisle with her mother, an instrumental rendition of Celestina Warbeck's
A gnome peeks up from under a lemon bush. Harry thinks about chasing after it, spinning it out of orbit and watching it fly at some specific km/h privy only to the universe. Whatever he feels for Malfoy, it’s not what Ron holds for his daughter. Harry’s just a fan.
It’s one of those situations that makes you think, of course. Like — of course pi is 3.1415 and so on and so forth. Of course the universe is expanding at approximately 70 km/s/Mpc and of course the scale of space itself is what is changing. Numbers like that don’t budge when you beg. Euler’s constant is exactly that — a constant. Some things never change.
"Sorry, love. Had a bit of a connection drop getting out of the tube. You know how flaky Floo powder gets underground."
Fingers card through his hair and down his neck, soft as the tap-tap of piano keys half-pressed down, ethereal in their half-existence. There is a Ferris wheel outside, Harry says. It wasn’t there before. Do you want to see it? Do you want something to eat? Do you want half my sandwich and have it weigh you down inside like a responsibility. Do you want to be whole again.
. Ron nearly died when I said I was thinking about quitting Quidditch. He's all, what would you even do after? I dunno. Maybe lie in for once? Go a week without my leg cramping during sex? Fucking live my life?"
Muggles paid a thousand pounds for a single, one-ounce Galleon coin. Draco bought a copy of every book at Waterstones and filled up the shelves in the second bedroom. But there was still his bedroom, the third bedroom, the fourth bedroom, not to mention the downstairs—so many shelves and never enough books. "Let's try the second-hand shops," Pansy suggested, so they compiled a list and tore through Muggle London, buying torn paperbacks and coffee-stained anthologies by the bin.
The bagger gave me the plastic anyway. His smile said I only got away with it because I was cute. Mother said that, too. That I had a face of an angel and the hair to match. For a while longer, anyway. (I was going bald.) Harry said he didn’t care what I looked like, I was rotten to the core. But in a good way. Everyone rots in the end. It was only trouble if you tried to stop.
Draco takes Harry by the wrist and kisses the back of his hand. His throat is thick, but he doesn’t cry.
The acceleration of gravity on Earth is something around 9.81m/s2. “But why?” you may ask, and someone may tell you about big G and little g and relativity. “But why?” you may ask again, and someone else may explain to you redshift and background radiation and maybe even show you a cool simulation of a black hole eating a supernova (gravity is dope), but the real answer is all the same: because. In any other universe, the numbers may be different, but in ours, they are what they are because they’re the numbers that make everything else make sense.
God, Ron. He was a total swot to Harry at Dean's new restaurant. Like he kept having to hold his tongue back, that's how much he couldn't stand Harry.
like Ron. You'd think dating your childhood best friend would mean near-telepathic communication by twenty-two, not weeks-long sieges of shoulders turned stubbornly away in bed and silent mornings of breakfast for one.
Harry shrugs. He doesn't get the Muggle fixation on moving pictures. Nobody liked Dennis Creevy until he made a movie about superheroes. Now everyone wants to kiss his arse.
Draco pulls back, lashes wispy over the delicate skin under his eyes. They flutter then still, grazing over Harry's mouth, tongue darting out to wet the corner of his lips. "Again?"
Draco's cheeks grew hot. "I don't know myself either, alright? I just know I need them. Merlin, I knew you wouldn't understand, I—"
Running off to Alazambar two years after the war should've solved all of Draco's problems, but the past keeps looping back like an LED billboard, deja vu every thirty seconds and every man looking like Harry Potter until they don't.
"Huh," Draco said, momentarily distracted as he stumbled around a pair of jeans propped up from when Harry had clearly stepped out of them some days or weeks ago. Draco was about to make a remark about the single, stiff sock by the bedside table, when Harry clocked him on the shoulder.
The tapestry. The locket. The diary. Burn it. Starched sleeves soaked in bad thoughts from bad blood. Bloodlines spilt over bathroom stones jagged mirrors and fire. Chase the rancour of Black blood! Burn him, chimaeras, choke his breath, devour his soul!
"You have no idea. Harry makes us do No-Magic Mondays. And he's as bad as I am, honest. Last week, he had us bake a quiche, but we don't own a single measuring cup. Or a baking dish. And he wrote down the temperature in Fahrenheit, thinking it was Celsius, so you can guess how well that went."
"Thought you'd want the company. All alone, in this massive townhouse. I'm surprised you don't have ghosts hanging around yet, given all the Order shite that's happened in here. We had to close up my Aunt Beatrice's house when she passed, and it was
Breakfast is yoghurt and blackberries from the woods, drizzled twice over with honey. Harry licks his spoon clean before opening the cabinets again for a loaf of sourdough, butter, marmalade, two pieces of chocolate, a pomelo. Draco peels the pomelo by hand, tugging off the pith strand-by-strand between his index and thumb until light swallows the shade and he starts to sweat from the heat.
Draco lives and breathes Arithmancy in the aftermath of the war. He studies it in lecture halls, in the university libraries. He practices it each day from the moment the morning rouses him awake. What is the probability that he will get out of bed today? What is the likelihood that he will have clean socks? He starts with simple questions—questions that don’t require the rigours of numerology—and finds solace in the certainty of their answers.
Harry couldn't recall much of the wedding either, now that he thinks about it. The champagne was good. And no one expected much from the bride's ex-boyfriend, anyway.
“Nothing,” Harry murmured. He pressed Draco onto the bed and kissed him slowly. His body moved like it was pushing through amber, ensnared in sticky sweetness and cooling slowly.
That night Draco stands in front of the mirror. The man who stares back is pale but warmed by candlelight. He finds that he doesn’t mind the way he looks. But he knows that what he sees before him is a pale reflection of reality. Mirrors only show you what you want to see, and Draco sees a man in another universe where Harry Potter forgives him because he’s done something good with his life. Draco knows the dangers of delusions, so he wills for his face to grow gaunt and sallow, the way it had looked in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, or the way his father’s had looked in Azkaban.
"He hasn't yet, technically," Harry said. With a sigh, he tidied up the log books before crawling into the tunnel behind Dumbledore's portrait. Then it was three left turns and a final cobweb in the face (secret passageways really weren't as cracked up as his younger self made them out to be), and he was there, twelve paces from the Room of Requirement and watching the knob pass through Draco's translucent hands.
A week passed with no change. Pansy left out a bit of milk and bread for him every night. On Saturday, she asked if he couldn’t set her up with a weekly allowance from his vaults for his expenses. “Nothing big,” she said smoothly, presenting him with crisp scrolls fresh from Gringotts and an ink pad for him to press his forked claw into, to sign.
"Draco," Harry says. "Good to see you." He tries standing, but he's wobbly from the weed. Besides, he doesn't want to. He'd rather sink into this sofa and become one with it, another piece of furniture in Draco's life. Then he'll finally belong.
And there goes another three years trying to explain broth when all you wanted to explain was salt. And it wasn’t even about the salt. It was about the sea, and the vastness of it, all that space that wasn’t salt, and all that space that wasn’t planets or stars but was just space.
Draco’s voice was never too loud, even when he spoke normally. Harry must’ve gotten used to it, like how he’d gotten used to the clock, one steady tick after the next, counting down the seconds until it was time.
“Fuck the case,” Draco declared, climbing into Harry’s lap. “I don’t need you to save my life for us to fuck.”
Harry tries tracking Malfoy down after, but Malfoy's far busier than him. Harry loses sight of him, and when he checks back, Malfoy's already gone home.
of books." Harry gestured at the books spilling out of the shelves, dangling down by their covers as though pleading to be chosen next. "Don't tell me you've read them all."
Why? Why did losing three books matter so much when he had a thousand more to choose from at home? Why, in a world full of people, was Harry Potter all Draco wanted? The answer was simple: because he loved them.
"Great-Aunt Lucrecia's. I thought I threw that out," Draco said. He rubbed a hand over tired eyes before rummaging through the shelves for his new ceramic mugs. He found two gold-rimmed tea cups, stamped in the silver Malfoy crest.
Hermione brings Crookshanks with her to the cafe when she breaks up with Ron. The kneazle is under disillusionment, of course—Hermione picked a Muggle part of town, far away from their flat, and she isn't
They take Harry's car to Nylon "for the full experience." Ginny rides shotgun and Ron sprawls out in the back. Harry flips on auto-drive since he's sloshed already.
The hour swings past seven. Across the street, I can hear the swish/clang of Madam Malkin closing up shop, punctual as always. I’d be doing the same if I hadn’t Harry Potter smudging fingerprints along the length of my display case counter. He stalls his wandering to linger over my wand, nestled haphazardly in the valley of an open text:
Draco nudges him again. Harry shivers, his skin crackling with static. He cups Draco’s face and counts the freckles under the eyes. Then he closes his own, feeling the water expel from his ears in tiny streams of bubbles.
Harry rocked his hips, Draco's cock somehow sinking even deeper in him. "That's right," Harry said, his voice still composed. "I knew. It's lucky I like getting fucked, you see. You thought you won, but you didn't.
“Potter? What are you doing here?” Draco gasps, standing up. There’s a warmth near his crotch as Pansy spells away his spill (bless her).
The space left is as dusty and dim as the inside of a coffin, long enough for a skinny orphan to lie down, though it's hard to imagine that as Harry's head hits the top of the doorframe. He pushes the door firmly shut. "Let's not," he says. "Bloody hate closets."
Harry Potter: arch-nemesis turned probationary pub partner, turned shitfaced drunkard eating pizza on a public toilet.
"Dear Merlin," Molly murmurs, looking away to give the teeny gremlin some privacy. Someone turns on the telly from a second-floor window and the pavement crackles with the distorted dialogue of some melodramatic Muggle movie.
Draco drops his gloves to the tiles, his arm guards following shortly after. Harry loses his words somewhere between the shin guards and the jersey, eyes rapturous down the curve of Draco's spine to the twin globes of his bare arse, begging to be cupped in each hand.
"I'm not your Healer," Harry laughs. Though self-medicating sounds like a pretty solid plan. He Vanishes their empty takeaway boxes and gives the counter a good Scourgify, not recalling if he cleaned it since the last time he had someone over, and they—well.
“… and the dragon figurine contained a small Muggle recording device that circumvented magical interference at Hogwarts by way of a radiomagnetic repulsor—”
Of course, of course, of course. How obvious can the future be before you realise it's repeating itself? I am my father's son, and Malfoys are destined to die wanting. My father, for power. Of course, what I want is Harry Potter's love.
Draco’s shadow has always crept close to his steps. Some days he thinks it has a face with the jagged cliff of his father’s nose; or Fenrir’s greedy maw. A muffled clang turns his attention toward his darkness, stretching long down the empty seventh-floor corridor. Today it wears Potter’s eyes.
Harry rubbed a naked pec with a distracted thumb. Behind him, Viktor Krum winked from a poster. "I suppose there's only one way to settle this," Harry said after a slow, contemplative second. "Let's fuck."
, and it’s not hard to imagine him slumped over his desk, quill stalled to sudden slumber, the parchment an aged, yellow relic under the bright light of a laptop screen.
"Sorry," Harry blurts out. "Sorry for being a dick. I was a dick to you for years at Nylon, and you've only been nice."
Harry's cheeks heat. "He's just helping me with the redecorating," he says. Besides, they're at the point in the renovations where Harry sees more of Pansy than Draco. How can there be so many different types of fabric and prints for curtains alone? They took two days and a bracket showdown before finding the perfect one: not-floral, not-white, not-tasselled. Blue.
In retrospect, Diagon Alley was a poor choice of street-address for a wizard hiding from his past. But having Pansy by his side had always felt akin to holding up a shield. An angry, mouthy shield. A little braver, Draco ventured out to Flourish and Blotts that afternoon, where he bought seven books with velvety emerald covers that evoked memories of the Slytherin common room.
"Oh! I haven't known him for terribly long. I only moved into that flat a few months ago. He and Spencer have lived there for a few years, though. They both work at BroomBod. The stationary broom company?"
"They made me think of you," Harry says because it's the truth and hopes that it's enough for Draco to see how much he wants him.
"Who said I only wanted one thing? You're making a lot of presumptions," Harry said, his voice hitching. "You don't know me at all. You don't know what I want—"
All Harry can think is to get his hands under it. He shoves Malfoy into the townhouse and pushes him against the closed door.
Harry had gotten as far as the Portkey station. He said, "I wish you wouldn't go." He said, "I don't want to live without you." And then he said goodbye.
“He’s gonna do that Malfoy thing,” Tony Hawk says over the speakers just as Draco plummets down the ramp. “Frontsize nosebone. Kickflip Indy Mute 540. Kickflip Indy to Fakie — OH MY GOD —” the crowd roars, and Harry with it, screaming nonsense —
In truth, all that spacetime local geometry talk just went in one ear and out the other. No matter how many times Draco explained it, the universe refused to hold shape in my mind. I likened his research to taking a drink of sea water and going, yeah, it’s salty, but not like salt on a pretzel; more like salt mixed in a broth. And then someone asks,
“You haven’t asked me why I’m here, how I found you. Who was after me. I could’ve killed someone, I could’ve killed Ronald Weasley —”
"They're not my type," the bartender continues gamely whilst pouring fresh drinks, "I prefer my blokes a bit more freckled, and, well…ginger." He winks again.
"I fucking hate you," Draco growled. He tore off his jersey and, fed up with the buttons, Vanished off the rest of his clothing as he stalked toward Harry.
Electric. That's what it was like between me and Potter in Courtroom Ten that summer after the war. Pansy thought I was delusional. "You can't keep living in your head like this," she said, slapping me across the arm. The Auror on duty yelled at her to cut it out, but I didn't mind; she smacked a pack of cigarettes right up my sleeve.
Ron snorts. "I'm telling you, you've got to hire an assistant." He makes Harry watch him take a long, suffering sip of his wine before saying, "It's Dean's soft opening, okay? For the restaurant. It's a big deal for him. Be nice to my brother-in-law."
No one’s come through since the storm, so it’s slow-going on snowshoes. Draco would take the boat if it were summer, or Apparate if he were desperate—Harry did that, sometimes—but Draco likes the wind’s bite and how every step sinks, leaves a mark; every stride a slough when he could’ve had it easy. It makes him think he’s less of the boy he used to be—like every foot forward is another foot further from his past.
Joy is an ugly taloned beast breaking my mouth open in a grin that shows all my teeth. I’m a brute when Harry calls to me; grotesque every time he sighs my name in sleep. He beckons to the joy in me, and it possesses me, makes me a monster.
The first thing you see when you go by the lake is the sky canopied bright over the basin. The big blue over Wiltshire sweeps past the horizon as though reaching into the future. But this sky, it’s not so big. It’s safe.
"That's not how fucking works. Fucking's…" Draco waved a hand in the air. "You either fuck or you get fucked."
"Now, hold on. I don't know many pointy blonds in my life, but..." Ron starts, his brows furrowed in slow-dawning mortification.
Ron makes eye contact with a server and grins before flashing Harry a dismissive look. "Don't be such a prude. When you grow up with six siblings, you're bound to overhear many natural and beautiful acts of—"
"Yeah, how did you not know? Your fridge was empty for months before I started dropping food off. You lost so much weight that the Prophet thought you were going for some kind of method acting role. Nevermind the fact that you couldn't act to save your life—well, except that one time, at the Manor—"
"My flat is tiny. And," Draco gasps to a particularly rough jerk of his cock, "and my room's a mess."
"Potty," Draco said, his mouth never failing to fall open at the wrong time. "Not you, um. You're—Potty. Not Potty.
Draco blinked. "Yes, I—" The Quidditch leathers dropped to reveal nothing but dick underneath. Draco swallowed, then blinked again, and—
I spotted Draco Malfoy outside St Mungo’s and followed him all the way back to Malfoy Manor, where he was alone. It was easy to tail him. I wore my Invisibility Cloak most hours now. I got comfortable enough to forget I was wearing it. Scared the right shite out of Hermione sometimes.
"Okay, okay," Harry mumbled into Draco's elbow. "It's 'cause I liked how the book felt in my hand. Like a soft thing with hard edges. It felt good to hold. It reminded me of you. And I liked that."
"Anyone else, and I'd be checking them into St. Mungo's," Ron says with a sigh, "but I wouldn't be your best mate if I didn't know that you've always acted on instinct. So why did you let him go?"
Draco loved nothing more than a world where all the choices were made for him. He lost himself in the lives on the page, so utterly immersed, he didn't notice Harry enter the room until the bed dipped.
Ginny says the rooms will fill, but all that collects is dust and takeout boxes, piling up in the corners. Ginny sends over a stack of furniture catalogues, and Harry thumbs through them in a daze. Nothing
Draco sighed, laying a head on Harry's shoulder, silvery wisps of hair tickling at Harry's neck. "This corridor gives me the creeps. You couldn't add a few candles in here, bright it up a bit?"
. Doilies and delicately crocheted tea cosies bring up nothing but the Dursleys. Dark, tasselled curtains remind him of Sirius and wingback armchairs of Snape. Harry tried the opposite of everything he knew with his last decorator, but he hated that, too.
Draco says that you should wash up. There’s blood under your nails and matted in your hair, and Draco doesn’t mind, honest, but Hermione will ask, and you know how she worries.
, he fucked just about every week, so why was he clamming up like it was his first time? It was Harry's fault, Harry and his soft face looking like he was on the verge of
"Wait—" but the world condenses to a single black point, and they're in Harry's room: four-poster bed, fireplace, the wireless left on something soft.
"Draco Malfoy didn't know what he was doing," Harry Potter's mouth said at my trial. "He was young and immature and fell in with the wrong people. He's very sorry."
“Malfoy,” you denounce as the sweat chills over your brow. You wipe it off on your shirt, a glimpse of your soft belly under twilight.
"That's how I thought about 'Mione," Ron says. He raps his knuckles on the table. "She wanted time to herself; I gave her time to herself. Don't be pushy about it, I kept thinking. I dunno," he sighs. "Sometimes, I wonder if things would be different if I tried to get her to see my way. She'd develop these misguided assumptions like I was deliberately trying to provoke her by not folding the laundry or some shite. I usually got too mad about how off the mark she was about me, so I never tried convincing her. I just kept thinking, it's her damn fault she doesn't see things my way."
“Dolohov.” Draco sets the mug down on the table and wipes his lip. When he’d gotten hold of the coffee, Harry can’t recall.
"Kiss me," Malfoy says, so Harry does, all tongue and teeth. But Malfoy's lips are pillow-soft and unexpectedly yielding, his arms looping around Harry's back and holding on with the lightest touch, nearly an embrace. Harry's own grip eases from the back of Malfoy's head, blond strands falling between his fingers. He closes his eyes, the velvet of Malfoy's tongue coaxing his jaw slack and his mind blank. He slips from his hands to his elbows. And then he tenses.
"Don't mess around," Malfoy whines. He twists his head back, his bare arse grinding into Harry's cock.
The people pass by good days and bad, though largely in-between. A woman breaks up with a man, and the man grabs their kneazle and runs
or else he was going to cry, and wasn't that embarrassing, how losing a book felt like losing an old friend.
Kissing Potter feels like running your tongue over a flat stretch of desert so unyielding that the ground cracks under the pressure of air. Potter’s lips are chapped to the point of ruin, his teeth harsh and unrestrained, like, like, like surprise cacti on the horizon —
They’re together two years before Harry tells his friends. It’s snowing outside, and Harry lays open and quiet all winter, waiting for them to tuck his insides back in for him. “Didn’t seem worth it,” he echoes when they ask
and isn’t that interesting too, how the shape of worth changes with the seasons, changes when you’re in love?
Draco wears a smog-grey jumper when he picks Harry up that morning, though he has no logical reason to do either. His wardrobe holds fifty-five jumpers in varying colours, textiles, and states of disuse, and Harry can Apparate to St Mungo’s on his own, as he has demonstrated time and time again.
Harry takes in the cerulean blue walls, stylistic waves painted in white and charmed to ebb and flow with the wind. The restaurant's busy, and there are groups of people waiting outside for a table.
For his mother: 6.53-carat tennis bracelet with dragon tail clasp, charmed with the usual perfumes & protections.
"Do you think they started hating me after I split from Dean? Or have they always hated me and just been too chicken to show it?"
I tried joking, but Potter had hidden himself away again, giving me full reign of his limbs. I wriggled his toes; they cramped at the tip.
"Thanks to you, we hit a record number of co-riders. Unfortunately, we did not have the resources necessary to support the new demand, which resulted in a temporary outage of our services. But if you warn us next time—"
"Eh," Ron shrugs. "Ginny convinced me he's not a terrible guy. Did you know that she's seeing Parkinson?" He shudders. "She scares the fuck out of me. I keep on wanting to cover up my balls around her."
It doesn't matter in the end because Malfoy makes his way to them, though he doesn't look happy about it. He doesn't even meet Harry's eyes. He only has eyes for Ginny, his hand tightly on the woman's wrist. Who
Girlfriend is an exaggeration. They haven't even held hands yet, but Ginny wants to badly enough that she's getting a divorce.
Draco asks this question on the first day of winter. The answer comes fluttering from his heart, like a tiny bird warm with hope.
“People throw them out, and they clog up landfills. They choke birds. It’s impossible to get rid of them.”
" Draco shrieked, voice shrill and cruel against the same ancient stones as when Harry had first followed Draco down this corridor a lifetime ago.
, baby." She winks at the man across from her. His eyes are blue, and he's a bit of a paunch on the belly. Cute.
“The way it hides darkness in the depressions of your face,” Draco continues, jaw slack and nearly prophetic. “The way it projects your shadows up walls and looms them large, inescapable.”
"I don't think you're actually evil," Harry finds himself saying, "but I still think you can do better than politics."
"Draco's been doing a lot for Hermione's campaign." Ginny's still chewing on the popsicle stick. It's already starting to annoy the hell out of Harry.
Draco turns to stone, his eyes round and blank, rigour mortis with fear. “Apparate,” he whispers between clenched teeth when Harry does nothing but listen.
They lose Ron between shots six and not-enough-fingers-to-count (how many does he have on each hand again?). Ginny's shimmying against Harry in a blur of denim and silver when suddenly, she freezes, her abrupt stillness jerking Harry into a single second of clarity where he makes out Malfoy entering the bar with some woman on his arm.
" Ginny drums her fingers, her nose perking up. "You still have those joints from California? Or at least get me something to drink. Nothing too strong—it's goddamn midday—but, a mimosa, pretty-please? Something to take the edge off. I've had the worst headache all weekend."
"The club didn't bother pressing charges, so…" Dean shrugs as though to say that he has far more important things to do than babysit a bunch of drunkards, powerful wizards, or his ex-wife.
The summer after brings a lightness that carries Draco all through his trials and into the next year. The others hiss and spit but they don’t see how he’s free now, how it can only get better for him from here.
Malfoys never borrow. Draco learns this the first time he reaches for Father’s quill and receives his own instead. It’s an easy lesson, and he swallows it comfortably as he does the word “mine”:
Pansy huffs into her Floo-Along, the flames shifting and tickling her ear. "No, of course not. That's the bloody joy of being rich, isn't it? That I can do whatever I want and it's all my choice. But I don't need to tell
I woke up in Courtroom Ten the next day and thought I dreamt up the whole thing until I caught sight of my body again, bound in that chair, my hair greasy and dirt under my closed lids.
"I could sue you for the number of times I've stabbed my knee on the edge of that monstrosity," Ginny says.
Malfoy's cock fits perfectly in Harry's grip, the exact length of the vertical span of Harry's palm. Harry splays his fingers and swirls his middle finger over the head, smearing precum, before lifting the finger to his mouth so he can suck the salt off.
"Do you actually eat any of these? Or do you just let them sit, like some museum artefact? Private collection of Harry Potter's discarded sandwiches and chips. Notice the teeth markings in this one, that's from the Awful Toothache of 1999—"
. There's something about the privacy of a public street, of being outside. Like no matter how loud you shout, the words won't echo back to haunt you. You can just let it go, and laugh.
Hermione asks Harry that same question often enough—her expectations neck-high as always—but Harry expects to fail her. Malfoy, though, Harry can't brush it aside as readily. Harry groans, exasperated, and shoves off, turning to the kitchen and motioning for Malfoy to follow.
"We finished the last of the tiling this morning. Once the guest mattresses come tomorrow, your home is complete," Draco says.
Harry leads Malfoy to his gym. The weather system is still up from the last time he rode, and a storm has coalesced in his absence, violent winds whipping the door tightly shut. It's only with a considerable amount of exertion that Harry pries the door open with a loud grunt and coaxes the clouds dry and the sky blue.
"Draco Malfoy didn't know what he was doing," Potter said later that night when he showed up at my door.
Draco swallowed, then coughed, hoping to hack up a sensible lie. But one look into her eyes, and the truth came stumbling out.
Harry draws his gun and shoots. The bullet soars neatly between blue eyes. A perfect line of red blooms down the middle of Dolohov’s mouth, still open. His eyes roll back.
By then, it's only a quarter past noon, but Harry sinks back into bed anyway, phone in hand. He catches up with himself. His calves look good coming down his front steps that morning, and he's got about a thousand notifications from people tagging him in their BroomBod screenshots. "Can't believe I took a ride with
The faucet twists off. Harry scrambles out of bed, heat rising up his neck as he digs around the sheets. He pulls on his pants just as the door squeaks open, and Draco walks in, dewy-faced and his mouth slightly parted, a towel slung low around his waist.
"Thanks, thanks so much, Mr Potter," the attendant said and helped Harry set up his folding chair between platforms nine and ten before leaving for more essential matters. A little boy wearing a Puddlemere jersey asked for Harry's photo, and then some more time passed.
." A heart-wrenching tale about the loss of a lover. And while Draco's friendship with Crabbe barely encroached on love, that particular story saw straight to his grief. Flawed, awful Crabbe. Draco couldn't explain why he loved him. All he knew was the book made Crabbe's passing a little more bearable, and he needed it back, lest—
Harry rolls Draco over on the bed. The room shifts around them again, the bed sinking down to meadow and the canopy opening up to a sky in perpetual sunset.
Eltanin fixes him with a quizzical stare. "Do you want to come inside? Actually, can you sign my BroomBod? Otherwise, nobody will believe me when I say that Harry Potter showed up at my door with a bouquet."
Harry's hand snaps out and stops him by the wrist. "Leave it," he says. "It looks better this way. Minimalistic."
"No, no, I saw. I just didn't—I just didn't properly think about it. Of course you would watch movies with them. You're Parkinson's best friend, and they—how did they even—"
The Ministry left me the Manor and everything in it except my parents. Potter saved me from Azkaban, of course, with two lines read from a scrap of crumpled parchment, my salvation scribbled on the back of some old, lint-covered receipt on the way to my trial. He said, "Draco Malfoy was a child", and everyone believed him like he wasn't seventeen himself.
Harry does a lap around the room. He thinks about getting back on the BroomBod, but he doesn't want a repeat of the same incident as earlier, and he sure as fuck doesn't want to call someone every time he wants to work out. He calls Hermione instead, the old-fashioned way, through the Floo. The flames flicker green until the fire dies without a reply. So he dials her on his mobile.
Run-on sentences, broken up with laughter; their vows a messy to-do list of hopes and dreams. Harry finds himself searching for Draco in the crowd and spots him a couple rows ahead, a glint of gold under the afternoon sun. Draco looks back briefly, a small smile flashing that, when gone, takes a part of Harry with it.
"It's beyond me why you believe insults will convince me to do anything for you, but even if you asked nicely, I certainly wouldn’t help you stalk your latest fu—," she coughs, "
Harry unclenches his grip and watches with satisfaction as Malfoy stumbles back into his chair. “Confess, and we’ll shave five years off your sentence,” he says. “Wear an Oculus Cam, and we’ll let you walk out the door today.”
Draco looked down at his hands again. They were soft and pale and like new, like they’d never been used.
a dozen models," Harry says, which isn't entirely true. They slip into his DMs often enough that he gives in and replies if he's horny and they're particularly athletic. It doesn't take much to want someone to come over. But Harry's bored of models now, the same way he's bored of Ron's constant nagging, bored of his Weasley monogram knitwear, bored of the same fucking grin that greets him when he hands his fire-truck red Bugatti Chiron over to the valet every night. He wants to find—well, he isn't sure what he wants. Anything but models. Harry is in the mood for…messy.
Harry shapes the water molecules in his hands and lowers the atmospheric pressure until fluffy, fat clouds hang at eye level.
Twenty minutes passed before Harry walked Draco to the door. The rain had started up a slow drizzle down, and Harry wondered what it’d feel like to be soaked in it, so he stepped outside.
The plates were gold-rimmed and scalloped. The forks were small and silver and turned every bite into three. Harry stabbed his into the cake so that the chocolate oozed out. He wasn’t hungry; he’d stopped smelling things after the war.
"Oh, never. Bickering all day and night. Broke up a few times, even. Though we always get back together."
against his chest until the faint scent of lemon lulled him to sleep. If the characters in the story could forgive each other for mistakes made in the past, then maybe Draco—
Harry laughs around the piercing pain in his chest. "Merlin, I feel awful. He asked me if I hated him."
It's ten minutes to the toilets and another ten to Harry's bedroom. Malfoy is all over his neck as Harry reaches between them and tugs Malfoy's shorts off. Harry groans, licking his tongue all the way into Draco's mouth, before dropping to his knees at the foot of the bed.
In summer, your blood boils under the sun, smothered beneath an invisible beast that only lets up in the dark. The fear simmers out of your bones; the sun so long to sleep that it catches you by surprise when it does, and you find me at the end of your shadow.
puffy along the edges as though, despite all the years, still angry. He soothes a fingertip over the words, sending shivers down Harry's spine. After a long moment, he looks up. "You live in an empty box, and you sleep on a bare mattress on the floor. Your sheets are transfigured from takeaway tissues, and the shower is broken, so you cleanse yourself with barely competent First-Year level Scougifies."
"Fine," Draco said and stomped off, only to stroke a remorseful hand along the walls an hour later. The house was all he had. And so he convinced his house to hammer up the last shelf in his bedroom before leaving to find books to fill them up.
Harry watches her spit the rest of her bite out into her hand before vanishing it away. "What are you doing here?"
“Nobody likes my flat,” Draco laughs. “There’s barely room to breathe. Everything smells like kitty litter, and the toilet only flushes if you’re nice to it.”
The train pulled up fast as it ever did, though, to Harry, it seemed to slide forward in slow motion, every second stretched until it finally stopped fifty feet in front of him. The doors opened.
"I see what you meant about the book," Draco told Harry over a low bookshelf at a second-hand shop in Chelsea the following afternoon. Draco had convinced the house to add new storage beneath the kitchen nook, which meant: new books! And Harry had come too. He was always in Diagon Alley for some reason or another. Picking up onions for Hermione was today's errand of choice.
“Yeah,” Harry admits. “Me too. Like my own hand.” He kisses Draco on the thumb, then the wrist. The explanations can wait.
Trash it. Tear it up. Don’t like it? Try again. Two steps forward. Three leaps back. Say the wrong thing? Time: turn it back. The same face, without the scar. The same arm, without the Mark. Draco could live like this forever. Trying, retrying. Never getting it right.
Draco’s original plan had been simple: reclaim his books, then leave. But now that he was here, he found he wanted to linger, to run a hand over all the wallpaper, looking for both what Harry kept and what he covered up.
"The Manor," Draco whispers, thinking of Father, of Mother. What will happen when the Dark Lord discovers—
Harry cleans up the broken glass. He helps himself to her gin and pours them another round of drinks.
"Fuck, I don't know," Harry admits. It's probably good that he doesn't catch Malfoy because he can't decide if he wants to slug him or snog him.
"Did not," Harry insisted with a cross shake of his head. "Was jus sitting 'ere. Ya know. Finders keepers. You lose you snooze."
Fuck. But it's too late—Ron's mouth tightens, and Harry knows the night's over for them. Ron blows up if he so much as breathes the same air as Malfoy. He says Malfoy doesn't deserve his presence or whatever indignant shite he spews whenever his righteousness gets the better of him. Harry hasn't forgiven Malfoy either, but he's learnt to deal with it in other ways. A quick wank in the toilets usually does the trick.
"Three other bartenders are working right this second, for the record," Ginny whispers in Harry's ear as they take their seats at the bar.
Harry takes a final look at the blank wall before Draco leads them to the kitchen, where Draco Vanishes the pantry. The laundry room is next, then the guest bedroom and linen closets, each replaced with a perfectly blank wall.
The door opened with a click. A gentle hand squeezed Harry's, almost warm, before wind brushed over chapped lips. "Thank you, Harry," Draco said. "I love you."
Harry hangs up. What is he thinking? He's a fucking disappointment to everyone he knows. It was only a matter of time before Draco gave up on him too. He isn't sure why he thought Draco would be different. It's only—Draco hated him
"Come on," Harry said. He jerked Draco's arm hard so that Draco fell over him, then twisted to straddle Draco's waist. "Come on," he muttered again, tacky hands holding Draco's cock up as he hovered over Draco, teasing.
“I think it was a pretty good choice,” Harry says with his eyes unblinking and a curious lilt to his smile. Draco has the terrible, heart-fluttering fear that Harry’s toying with him like how he did all through eighth-year before Nana died and left Draco her cottage. What was it about that year that swims so easily into now? The same feelings washed ashore once more.
"I don't want to be just friends!" Draco yells. He slaps a hand over his mouth, shocked as anyone by his own words.
"I was three years under you at Hogwarts." Eltanin wrinkles his nose, but he doesn't show any sign of annoyance beyond that. It's a wonder the amount of bullshit people will put up with when you're famous.
Harry wants to say something about how peculiar it is to sit across from Draco Malfoy and want nothing more than to hold his hand. Nobody would believe he skipped out on the War Memorial for a tiny flat with his childhood bully and a bucket under the leaky ceiling. This shouldn’t happen at all, given their past, but a yawn overtakes his thoughts, and he blinks in the aftermath of it, drowsy and content. Maybe Draco would let him stretch out on the bed too, and sleep. He’s got nowhere to go except here.
Luckily for him, Ron's an easy mate to distract. Get him to slide his big hands around the waist of a pretty bird with a soft mouth, and he'll show her to the back, press her up against a wall; maybe take her all the way home and ask if she wants to stay for breakfast.
“He could’ve said that of half of London,” Draco said, eyeing his fingernails. “There’s nothing special in how you take your tea. There’s nothing special about you, really. You’re about as dull as a bag of plain crisps.”
"Hate it. Don’t stop." Harry’s eyes were watering. Draco braced himself and pushed in again, pleased with the stuttered gasp that escaped Harry, that he was the one who forced that gasp. Draco was a grown man now, and Harry wasn’t going to forget it after tonight. Draco was going to erase all memory of his simpering, childish days from Harry's mind. With his dick.
“I saw Malfoy again,” Harry tells Ron the next day on Ron’s back porch. “Not like, saw-saw,” he corrects. “Just saw his run at the X Games.”
. I thought I was going to die if I didn’t eat something before I Flooed. You know that feeling when you’re in the in-between with the Floo. They say it’s better to close your eyes and breathe, like passing through the brick wall of Platform 9 ¾ for the first time. Leap of faith, better to not ask kind of deal because where
"Nevermind," Draco said, embarrassed that he recalled their conversation so perfectly when Harry didn’t even remember the title under discussion. "Have you got the onions for Hermione, then?"
She cuts his hair later in the bathroom. She uses a razor and shears it all the way to the root. "Like mowing a lawn," she says, "if I were a Muggle." But she's not, and he's not, so all of his hair grows back in an hour.
"Don't tell me you're siding with them," Molly says to the little white-haired furball. "Well, lookie-loo, they kicked you out too."
Draco taps his fingers against the counter. "You may not be familiar with the concept, but it's okay to make mistakes."
In the brave light of after, stories bloom unbidden from his chest, pushing up and out his mouth, each more indulgent than the last. “Draco does this thing where he peels his oranges with his teeth. Narcissa hates it. She…” He gets lost in the retelling; travels down too many arterioles in attempts to explain why it’s entertaining, or funny, or worth sharing (although they get it, they say, smiling). In truth, Draco is never that interesting
No one should be allowed to find such a skinny-arsed, unsanitary bastard so bloody attractive. But as it were, Draco would donate a family vault to climb onto that lap full of cheesy carbs and kiss those greasy lips, tomato sauce and all.
It's hard to choose a colour even when there are so many to choose from. Harry says no to sky-blue, no to canary-yellow. No to flushed-pink and no to fog-grey.
"Fuck," Harry mumbles. He tries moving his hips, to get them deeper and graze that—"Fuck," he moans, his spine rounding, head falling onto Draco's shoulders. He takes a stuttering breath. "Fuck. C'mon. Are you gonna fuck me or what?"
Harry doesn’t say anything because he isn’t sure Draco is entirely himself. They’re testing a new formula of Wolfsbane. One painless night spent alone in a windowless room, and the rest of the month is yours to freely live. That is the hope the potion sells.
I spent maybe two or three hours in Courtroom Ten every day, sometimes for myself, sometimes for my mum or dad. It was all supremely dull. Nothing killed a good murder like legalese. Not that I
"God, you're stubborn," Harry said. "Fine. I'll give you this one." He gripped Draco's shoulders, hugging Draco’s hips with his knees, and rolled over, pulling Draco over his chest. Draco's cock slipped out just a bit, before sliding it back in. Snug. And there it was, what Draco wanted this whole time. Maybe his whole life.
"We're in no rush," Harry says. He walks over to the Wireless and fiddles with the copper dials until an r&b station he likes comes into focus. He steps back and takes a moment to appreciate how the music warms the room, his room, his things.
Harry's eyes were a little wild, his mouth slightly ajar. He shook his head. "It's nothing. You've got ink on your face." He strode forward so that he stood close enough for Draco to smell the lemon in his hair. And then he took Draco's chin in his hand. A long moment passed.
Harry wanted to pull Draco in by the coat lapels and press his face against Draco's neck. Harry wanted a lot of things he couldn't have if he thought about it too hard — so he stopped thinking and held out his arms.
Was it really that simple? Harry pulls Malfoy from the Fiendfyre. Malfoy fails to identify Harry's bloated face in the dungeons. And like that, they're bound together, destined to drive each other mad for eternity.
. Potter bought them matching cowboy hats and corndogs, and they sat in the crowd waiting for Lil Nas X to show up, which he never did. This was fine because they missed half the show anyway to make out in the toilets. But then Draco had to ruin it all with a neverending confessional about how badly he wanted to be Potter in school, how he regretted his actions, how he tried so terribly to be good so that Harry would notice him again. And now here they were, and all Draco could talk about was himself, all this I I I me me me like the only person he knows how to speak to properly is himself.
“You could’ve sliced him up like you did with me—blood dripping down his snakey face before you snuff the light out of his eyes. You don’t need to drag it out. Two seconds is enough for a lifetime’s worth of satisfaction, I reckon.”
The sky’s a muddling of mauve and mulberry; the sun in iridescent downfall. Some kid down the block’s blowing bubbles, and one floats up, brushing against Draco’s cheek, before popping. It doesn’t make a sound, but Harry winces; feels it ricochet against his ribcage.
“Merlin,” I laugh. I pull him in by the elbow, where the thread is thinning. A while longer, and it’ll tear. Then we’ll patch it up.
"Number 12 Grimmauld Place," Potter said when I stepped us into the fireplace, and off we went, spinning through the tubes until we stumbled onto his hearth, a whole two people in one.
Malfoy lives with two roommates that Harry doesn't recognise but appear to be wizards from how they step into the alley to Apparate. The portly brunette leaves at around five in the morning, and then Malfoy follows after, at seven. Then, nothing happens for hours until dusk falls, and out the door emerges a black-haired bloke that Harry realises with some alarm is the bartender from Nylon. Harry waits ten minutes, and then he carefully slips past the wards and into the flat, though the cat scares him out before he gets a good look around.
"Nothing. Not nothing. Merlin, I'm jealous of your fingers," Draco says. "C'mere, Harry. Come sit in my lap."
Ron throws back his head and laughs. "A bloke who looks out for your safety. Alright, I can get behind that. What'd you two do? Where'd you take him?"
"It's like you're a bloody first-year," Draco mock-grumbles, covering the walls in repeating neon-green tiles of a hairy dick. Harry snorts, rolling over to look down at Draco, whose face is scrunched from holding back a laugh too. Harry watches that face morph into an expression just short of relaxed. His gaze drops to Draco's mouth.
He drops his head into the crook of my neck. I wrap my hands around his waist. His collar tickles, the yarn stretched and lived-in with the kind of wear that makes you think, yeah, somebody loves it, alright. Maybe too much. I don’t know if I’m talking about Draco, or the jumper, or both. It’s hard to stay annoyed with what’s mine, is all I’m trying to say.
Draco sighs. “All that blood is so damn pretty.” A wet shimmer coats his bottom lashes. “I’m sick, I know.”
The valet takes Harry's car. Ginny shoves through the double doors of the back entrance with a yell so loud that the club stops to turn to them.
"So...can you get me his address?" They ask for it on the volunteer registration form. Harry remembers filling it out and having to ask Hermione for his postal code.
“It’s diner coffee. Sat out warming in a twelve-cup carafe since last night, if I had to guess. I’m not missing out on anything.”
Harry wets his lips. "I don't want your pity," he forces out between gritted teeth, though at this point, he would take anything. He would pay for Draco to hold his hand and tell him what colour to paint his walls.
"Touch me," Draco says. Harry's hand is halfway there; another second, and it's wrapped around their cocks, already slick from precum.
"Yeah, I have my doubts too. I won't be surprised if it's all for show. You know, so that he can put on his resume that he supports Muggleborns now. Prove that he's not following in his daddy's footsteps."
Harry wrapped a hand around the door frame and gripped as though determined to stay. "She only wants to borrow it."
He sleeps three hours a day. He drops out of his classes. He reads every book in the library and resents the wasted time when he finds nothing within their pages. And with every day, a nagging question grows within him.
“Found you,” Harry says or doesn’t say. Draco can’t be sure because, in his next breath, Harry orders drinks for him and his dozen friends, as it is his birthday.
I left the plastic bag up even though I knew it was bad. I liked to watch it sway in the open window. A thing that couldn’t die. Not like me, who was rotten to the core.
"Yes," Draco said. "But as you can see, I can't open a bloody thing with these useless things." He shook a fist.
Harry transfers to the DMLE Investigative Division after three years as a garden-variety doughnut-eating sidewalk-loitering Auror. It’s a perfect fit, like his first time flying: the gentle rock up to the skies, the broom an extension of himself. And then the Snitch. Oh, the Snitch.
“Mm.” Pansy wiggles her head and shoulders as though it’d let the alcohol percolate through her faster. “You
"Pansy probably paid them off," Ginny whispers to Harry. To Dean, she yells, "Thank you for aiding my prison escape, dear ex-husband!", and cackles when Dean turns bright red, his head spinning around like an owl's scanning for anyone who might have witnessed his embarrassment.
war crimes—my solicitor built a woefully convincing case that I couldn't kill a Flitterby—but couldn't a bloke contain a multitude of feels? Why couldn't I despair with the same bloody breath I used to yawn?
"Bloody hell," Harry says. He pulls out and flips Malfoy over with rough hands so that he can look down at that pinched, ugly face. "So are you. What the hell do you want?"
He catches me in front of the mirror. I try to fight him off, but he's strong, or maybe I'm weak. My wrist is thinner than I remember, closed tight in his fist. I stop moving. If my mother taught me anything, it's to know when I've lost.
Harry can hear Draco breathing in quick, panicky bursts, though neither says anything for a long minute.
Ginny refries the potatoes with rosemary and red pepper flakes. She’s almost done with the eggs when Luna floats in big-eyed and blinking and says that she’ll make griddle cakes. Draco fiddles with the coffee machine and sets the table and cuts apples and hovers when there’s nothing else to do except wait for Luna to finish. There’s a joy when his hands are busy, but his mind is not, and he savours it as he heaps sugar into Harry’s coffee and swirls the spoon slowly, as though he’s brewing a potion. Twelve turns counter-clockwise, for love.
Draco watched Harry leave with some relief. So what if he couldn't explain his books? He didn't need to justify himself to anyone, least of all
"Well," Draco hesitated. "I might want them someday." He fell into an impasse again, stuck trying to explain something he only felt. If only Harry was more like Pansy, who never asked questions. No, Draco didn't really want that. He only wanted Harry to be Harry.
Time flies easy, broomback—buildings, matchstick-height; the castle between two fingers. Beyond the forest are mountains, and slumbering between, a mustard meadow a smear of yellow and green. Time flies easy, broomback—weaves between then and now; leaves time for what could’ve been. It’s in these gaps that he meets Draco, again.
It's only during a lull between tracks that he hears the incessant ringing of his doorbell. He casts another amplification charm, but it's too late. Whoever's at the door has murdered the vibe.
"I didn’t touch Weasley's stick," Draco growled, then gasped, the breath knocked out of his chest as Harry slammed his hips down, enveloping Draco's cock in velvet heat. "Why you think—"
Draco stood so close that his sneer was all that Harry could see. Harry wanted to kiss that ugliness right off his face, so he did.
“Draco. He told them how I take my tea. He told them that I go down to Tesco at least twice a week, past midnight, to buy a bag of crisps.”
"You can't." Hermione licks a dribble of mayo running down her pinky. "Not while I'm running for Minister, anyway."
"The biggest mistake of my life," Harry murmurs into the dewy curve of Draco's soft navel. They'd made it onto a bed, finally—only took three shots and a promise of a blowjob—and Draco said that thing about Harry's lips again that got Harry buckling to his knees with his mouth full of spit, at least until Harry caught sight of the scars.
Draco was waiting for me back at the hotel room with the view of the ocean. He wanted to see, so we sank down into my memory together. I don't know why I never watched them before. There’s a certain detachment to the viewing. Like when I'm out of the moment, the grime of death’s wiped clean, and I’m acting as the cool hand of justice. It all looks staged, like death scenes in Muggle movies where every gun wound was just red goo squeezed into a condom. All that blood couldn't be real.
He was at the library when he turned down the aisle and ran into Harry Potter. Their eyes met in a frenetic spark of recognition. Then Sickles and quills began spilling out of Harry’s pockets, and Harry was calling out for Draco to wait up.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione says. Her voice warms now that she knows she's won. "Get a grip, will you? Your life won't suddenly turn around because you're in another hemisphere. You're far too rich for that."
Draco Malfoy? Molly slaps a palm over her mouth to stop from gasping. She's right, because at the next tree down is Draco Malfoy, pressed against the white bark of an Indian laurel by Molly's very own Harry.
"How is it that I'm the only one who doesn't have my shit together?" Harry yells, embarrassingly honest in his anger. "I'm not like you. You were never part of some deranged prophecy. You never had a piece of Voldemort
Petro mewed all over Harry before he left that night. Draco glimpsed a strange, bulky shape under Harry's coat when he was laughing and trying to set the cat down at the same time. What could Harry be hiding? Draco ruminated on the possibilities throughout his bedtime bath before toweling off and pulling off his robe. He nestled into bed and reached for his copy of
This nonsense is for @floydig, who won @avenueofesc’s @drarrystrugglefest word count betting pool. I tried to make something you’d like but um here you are.
Draco wore a silver barrette. It was one that Harry recognised from Hogwarts. His eyes were kohl-lined and dark while the rest of him stayed pale. He stared past Harry's shades straight into Harry's soul. And then he started drifting forward.
He twists open the cap. “Merlin!” he hollers when the coke fizzes to the brim. I steady him before it slips from his hand.
Harry drives back to Nylon, like he's done every night this week, and waits. The bartender brings him a gimlet and asks how his day was. Harry replies with one-word answers, his jaw clenching tighter with every passing minute.
"Yeah, he is. I just blew his two brain cells, so it'll take him a while to recover. Look, we'll have—" Ron rattles off about five menu items, none of which sound appetising to Harry. Though that's nothing on the restaurant. It's only that Harry hasn't properly tasted food since Draco left.
A crash in the bush, ten metres away. Two men: swearing, shouting, branches snapping under heavy boots.
Death creeps in our bedroom day by day in the long, spindly shadows of dusk, tugging at the seams as my beloved unravels before my eyes. Soon, the beast will ask Draco to pay his dues, and I, his subject, will watch.
“Your cheek,” I say. I made the first cut—a stray shard of porcelain during a nasty fight. I didn’t do it on purpose. I
Crookshanks springs onto the table in an angry yowl. Hermione meets Ron's eyes over the kneazle's gnarled head and sees Ron's lips thin in fury.
Harry stood up and paced before a bookcase, eyes scanning down the spines. "It's all for show, then?"
"Pretty," Harry says about the bracelet. He thumbs the thin chain, the small diamond studs. Two fingers encircle Draco's wrist, briefly, before Harry lifts it to his lips, his stubble dragging down the back of Draco's hand. "Pretty," he says about the diamonds, about Draco. Dainty. Delicate. Indestructible.
Harry groans; Ron's bloody unhinged. He shoves a twenty into the woman's hand for her trouble before manoeuvring Ron out of the club, his gaze still locked on Malfoy. He's at the exit when Malfoy finally opens his eyes and stares back. But Malfoy doesn't look surprised at all — no, his eyes are narrowed, and his smile beckons, like a lure.
The list was written on the back of a letter to Draco’s mother. There are eight names indexed total, each an invaluable piece stolen from the Reina Sofia.
The dinner wraps up. Dean stands on the bar and gives a speech about how he couldn't do it without a bunch of Weasleys and his mum (Ron rolls his eyes at his own name) and announces the afterparty at Thestral & Gold. Harry already knows from the bar's name that the party's going to be a total snooze, so he bows out, saying he's had a long day. "Exhausted. Photoshoot earlier," he explains to Dean, leaving out the part where it only took him thirty minutes.
We go on a drive today, to the hills. It rained a few days back and washed the slopes green with fuzzy newborn grass, curling into the earth more like moss than the wild, wind-whipped blades come fall. I love the hills this time of year, the cold still cutting but the sky above a blazing, bright blue and every breath like a drink of spring, fresh and raw and alive.
The door bursts open. The solicitor breezes in with his arms full of release forms, and Malfoy is back on the street in a matter of minutes.
"I'm pretty sure that I overpay him for this service," Harry whispers back, jabbing her with his elbow.
," Draco said, then repeated it louder as he followed Harry to the Apparition Point, where Harry grabbed his arm and Apparated them to his bedroom.
Harry rolls over on his bed and flops onto his pillow, his hands balled in frustration. A steady strum of
Harry slipped a thumb in his jean pockets. He didn’t quite meet Draco’s eye. "Pansy says you're going crazy over a few missing books."
Harry comes in from the kitchen and hands Draco a glass of coffee that's mostly ice. Draco tilts his face up, to be kissed.
"Fuck. Fuck, fuck," Malfoy whimpers and reaches down to pull at Harry's hair. "Fuck, your mouth, god. Fuck. Harry."
Draco sits down at the table and stares at the peach pit until the bathroom door opens and a steady roll of steam fills the room until everything smells of sun. The mist doesn't look anything like Harry Potter. Until it does.
"I live in an empty box," Harry says at the end of it. His living room is a long rectangle, the same grey as a mausoleum.
It isn’t until Draco’s five-year mark that he’s finally let on the field. Even then, he’s only allowed because they’re severely short-staffed, and Draco, despite it all, is tenured. Potter’s surrounded when they swarm the Muggle warehouse, twelve guns emptying into his chest as he holds out his wand mid-slash. There’s an acrid smell of burning skin, and Draco’s vision bursts in blues and reds, loud bangs, his own hoarse voice shouting something in between a Protego and a Stupefy.
“But you said,” Draco says into the crook of Harry’s neck. He yawns and forgets the rest of his sentence.
“I’ll miss you,” Harry says to the smog-grey dread in Draco’s eyes, though Draco only laughs and says that Harry won’t get the chance; such is the irony of fearing the end of all fears.
"Why would I run?" Draco frowns, though the urge overwhelms him all the same, like a swift breeze threatening to sweep him away the moment the door jangles closed.
Harry walks beside me along a dirt trail grooved with cow hooves, clutching a coffee cup in one hand and mine in the other. It’s easy walking today, nothing like the steep inclines of a proper mountain, and we go slowly up the gentle, rolling mounds, more a ramble than a hike. I catch him blinking, his attention in the distance as though trapped in fog, and I want to ask if he’s lost in the worries of work again. But then he turns his awareness to me, the corners of his eyes crinkling and his gaze unfaltering. Like I’m the only person in this world besides him.
Harry had the sudden, horrifying recollection of scrawling, “Can’t stop thinking about ur arse. Come down to Leaky. It’s my bday u ugly git.”
Malfoy rounds on him, straddling his thighs in one smooth movement. "Do I need to suck your cock to get you to make
"He can have them," Ginny yells in the small space of Harry's car. "All they do is nag nag nag. It's all so
Ginny orders them another round and a reluctant plate of sweet potato chips after the server insists that this isn't a
"Ugh," Ginny says. Her fingers struggle to detangle the knots at the ends of her hair. "I’ve got to get a new conditioner."
The snow’s good today. Fresh. There was a storm over the weekend, and the wind wiped the lake clean; made the snow all soft again. The kind of soft that makes you want to take a nap in it and disappear for a while.
Pearl-white paints over fog-grey. Paint it over, Harry thinks. Paint it over, and maybe you'll love it again.
The blond man sits in a booth until another man hits a gavel on the surface before him. The room empties of sound as a single hooded entity enters the vaguely empty room. Harry watches the hooded entity lift up the chin of the blond man, and all he thinks next is:
"Thanks," Harry says. "Um. I don't want to be a stalker or anything, so I guess just mention that they're from me."
Outside, Ron asks if Harry wants to go to another club, but Harry feigns a yawn and says he's got all the excitement he needs for the night.
Draco charms their cups cool, the paper thickly insulated to protect from hurt. He puts his wand away. "Would you prefer that I sneer?" he asks.
I bite back my “No”. I don’t know why it makes me nervous—the streamers, the silver balloons; the way his tongue curls around my name like he’s saying, darling, or dearest—words I dare to reach for only under cover of darkness but that he displays so plainly, as though hung up.
Draco stood before Harry’s desk. “It’s almost impressive, really, how much you care for this country, despite how little it cares in return. The howlers alone—”
A funny feeling bursts in Harry's chest, as though someone squeezed his heart until it ruptured, simultaneously warm and painful, and sick as an open wound. He clamps down on it, letting out a too-even chuckle. "I think I deserve to get my dick sucked, then."
Harry jabs Draco with a sharp elbow. He clears his throat, though it does nothing for the grimace carved on his face. “Congratulations, Ian Weasley. You’re a wizard.”
Harry showed up the day after and ribbed Draco all afternoon before leaving to catch a match with Ron. Draco had dinner alone and then went to bed. He spent all next morning pacing in his kitchen. At noon, he owled Pansy for Harry's address. Except there was no home when he arrived, because of course Harry Potter would secret-keep his house. Draco Apparated home and picked up his copy of
Harry looked up. Draco dabbed his face with a serviette, little crumbs smearing dark against white linen, like comet tails.
Harry's thumb grazed over a nipple, a thoughtful expression flickering over his face. "Why not? You're mad, I'm mad. Let's do something more than yell ourselves hoarse over it."
"It's a wonder how you don't lose more books, with the way you throw them about like that." Pansy said. She lounged across the drawing-room chaise in a silk bathrobe, a magazine in one hand and the other stroking the silky fur of Petro, their black cat. The cat had turned up during the party and never left. Nobody fed him, and yet he was around all the time. Draco would have suspected that the cat was Harry's animagus, if he didn't know for fact that Harry was a snake animagus. Harry had shown him. His little forked tongue was very, very cute.
Eltanin hands him the blunt with a sigh. Harry brings it to his lips and inhales, letting the smoke fog his thoughts. Eltanin is chatty when high—chatty all the time, honestly—but Harry keeps his mouth shut because he's afraid he'll puke if he doesn't.
beat through his chest. Did his sheets smell of Draco, or was that in his head too? It was a wonder how an absence can be so consuming.
Draco gets off when the train stops again. A dark-haired man struggles with his metrocard up ahead at the turnstile. A woman rolls her green eyes at Draco behind circular-rimmed glasses, muttering about tourists. Above ground, Draco unlocks his broom from the rack and takes to the skies, the sun setting in yellows and greens behind a jagged range of skyscrapers, a lightning bolt flashing across an advert for a potion that's more water than water.
"Oh, no, nothing like that." The woman gives a bright, false laugh. "You really are quite an influencer. Our Star Athletes program is designed for celebrities like you, who—"
“I’ve brooms back in the hut,” Harry offers in a jumble, words tripping over each other in their rush to get out, “The new Cometheads; they’re practically weightless. You’ve got to try them.”
Draco makes no move to remove his wrist from under Harry's hand, so Harry thumbs at the joint before raising it to his mouth and kissing it softly. He's too exhausted to think of what this all means or where it's going. Whatever it is, it's good, so he just holds on until he falls into a dreamless sleep.
Ginny launches herself at Parkinson. Harry tries to hold her back by her sleeve; as much as he loves a fight, Ginny wouldn't forgive him for letting her embarrass herself—except…except…
"I — " Harry blinks, surprised. "Yes? You don't need to pretend in front of me. I know exactly who you are."
—before poking Draco's forehead for no good reason except that he wanted to. "I like this book," Harry said, opening to a page on black mambas. He nudged Draco. "Your turn."
“It’s not,” Draco shows him, brushing glitter over Potter’s hands, his scars. All his dazzling features, every inch of him a benediction.
“A lot about you surprised me,” Draco said. “It’s.” He laughed a little; two breezy puffs of it. “It’s embarrassing, honestly, how every petty assumption I made about you ended up being a throwaway in the grand epic of your life. Like the time that hippogriff bit me—”
Draco's kitchen is very nice. Adult. Lots of scrubbed-white subway tiles; navy blue cabinets with brass fixtures. Everything is put in place, except for the refrigerator, which has a whole album's worth of photos stuck on it in every which way.
"Not really," Harry says. He holds back a glib comment about how nothing's scary when he's died once before because it isn't true at all.
I spied Dolohov out my window one day and followed him three blocks to his townhouse, where he wiped his shoes on a welcome mat before shutting the door behind him. The living room lamps were lit, and I could smell meatloaf from the open window. Can you imagine that? A Death Eater, living three blocks from Harry Potter and walking around like he owned the bloody place. He must have thought I was soft.
"Let's do it, then," Harry said, standing. The door stood before him. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and reached for the knob, twisting it under his hand before he could change his mind again.
Harry loves to run his fingers criss-cross over the scars on Draco’s chest. The habit is borne from shame but morphs into instinct with time. No matter when or where, Harry’s fingers will itch their way under Draco’s shirt until they find the seams of old wounds. Draco never fails to lean into the caress, his breath light and inviting, as though urging Harry to open him up again and make sure he’s still good on the inside.
Draco’s Muggle flat is a hotchpotch of three oddly-shaped rooms that sum up to about twenty-seven square meters total in living space. The kitchen table is a fire hazard rammed up against the oven door, but Harry sits at it gamely enough, his legs squished between cans of beans and a box of instant ramen.
think you can do better than having sex with whoever decides to show up at the club that night," Hermione sighs. "Watch out for yourself, okay? Love you."
A calico fluffball stretches in great yawns over Draco’s bed in the other room. Harry can see it moving dimly from the doorframe, her paws kneading the croqueted coverlet fondly. “The kittens like it,” Harry says, turning back to Draco.
"Terrible," Harry says, licking his lips. They're the only two left in the locker room. Hell, it's not even Harry's; he followed Draco in just to tell him off some more, and the rest of the team had scrammed faster than if they'd heard a tornado siren. "Terrible downwind.
The man at the counter finishes his last slice of bacon. He wipes his fingers on a paper napkin and burps his satisfaction before turning on his stool, a hand reaching for the duffel. He locks eyes with Harry. And then his expression changes.
The dressing down comes as soon as they slide into the booth. "Molly's been intolerable," Hermione confesses as she fills up their glasses with an Aguamenti. "She keeps arguing that Muggle divorce wouldn't be so popular if the Statute was still in place. As if I'm the reason why your wartime teenage romance didn't work out! And I can't even tell her off for it because I
"Yeah?" Harry asks. "What did you like about it?" He slams the door to his car. The car beeps once in annoyance before driving off to park itself in the back.
"No, not evil," Harry says. "I'm trying to date him, for Merlin's sake. Why would I think he's evil—"
Harry scratched the back of his head with a sheepish hand. His shirt—the same as from Hogwarts, except now two sizes too small—stretched across his chest. He looked incredibly stupid, and Draco felt incredibly stupid for looking.
Ginny holds Pansy's pug face in her hands. Their faces mash together for so long that Pansy's pasty cheeks go red from holding her breath.
"Err—actually, could I get—" Harry pauses, finger still extended, though he cannot for the life of him remember what he usually orders. He doesn't recall ever ordering, actually. The drinks simply...come.
They'd breached the twenty-minute mark of their usual post-game brawl when Ginny walked back into the stadium and yelled, "They're closing up, you fuckers!"
He never thinks of me, but all my thoughts are his. Breathless, some nights when my unease grows monstrous from self-doubt… his back presses into my chest but somehow remains distant, a hollow echo in the disquiet. “I couldn’t live without you,” I say. “I’ll die without you,” I promise, a long yearn. And even in that, he bested me — his death over mine, like a challenge.
"It's not for sale," Draco growled, snatching the book from the stack and stalking toward the stairs in time to see Harry Potter, grade school nemesis, best and worst of all wizards, unlacing his trainers at the door.
Number Twelve squeezed into view. Draco followed Harry inside, his eyes dragging over two trainers and a pair of boots, an umbrella stand, and keys to a motorbike thrown in a bowl of lemon drops.
What is it about a roof that oppresses? Walls like ribs caging a heart. Jaw clenched when what I want is to chew life up and hold it heavy in my gut. Mine.
Harry nudges his cock between Malfoy's thighs and exhales slowly. Merlin, it's good, even when it's boring. Sex is so damn simple.
"I don't think— " Harry starts but shakes his head, changing his mind. "It's great," he says. Watching Eltanin handle Draco's daffodils makes Harry's hands itch, but he can't be choosy. The flowers are in Draco's kitchen, regardless of how they get there.
He's changing, but mostly, he's running. Every morning, six-thirty, five kilometres. Six. Seven. Eight in the rain, and still Harry keeps up, droplets pelting down his face, soaking through his shirt until he's shivering in line for coffee. Draco charms Harry dry as subtly as he can, wrapping his shoulders with an extra charm so that they'll relax down from his neck.
"But isn't that what books are? Shards of other souls that reveal your own reflection, if you're lucky?"
"Let's start with the smallest space," Draco says. He pulls the door open with a jerk, and Harry, coughing, sends three doxies back with a wordless Knockback Jinx.
"Uh-huh," the youngest one says, suddenly shy. "Mummy says you're why I can go to Hogwarts and not be scared anymore."
I'm walking down Diagon one day and catch Neville taking a sharp turn on Knockturn Alley. He had on a cream-colored coat Hannah bought him the year before for their third wedding anniversary. He was so proud of it. It got a whole two lines in the Christmas letter they sent out with a button to vote for him for some position or whatever. I couldn’t keep track; the wanker was always trying to get to the next position up at the Ministry.
with ghosts. Of course, she was one of them...anyway. Someone's got to check in on you once in a while."
"Fuck." Draco bit his lip, straining for composure as blood pooled to his groin. His cock hit the back of Harry's mouth. It slid in an impossible centimetre deeper and Harry gagged, throat constricting around Draco's cock for a second before he struggled to pull off to breathe.
"You come to me," Harry said. The pizza flopped distastefully in his grasp, the cheese already congealed.
"For." For staying too long. For lingering. Harry gestures in the empty space between them, unable to solidify any of his fears into words. He buttons his shirt instead, zipping up his trousers on the way out. Some agreements are better left unspoken.
It was three days ago when Draco came to me with the idea. I was already in bed, but he stood by the wardrobe still, itching at his wrists with a nervous bite to his lip. He said, “I couldn’t figure out what to get for your birthday. What I want to give you may well be impossible. But we can try.”
Draco took a hesitant step through the doorframe, reluctant as though he were passing through a portal to another dimension. “You’re a good Minister. The best, even,” he said, his eyes earnest in a way that Harry’d only seen before, in his dreams, right before he’d undressed Harry down to his heart.
The whole package shows up on Harry's front steps on a day the rain's coming down in sheets. Draco comes in dripping on Harry's shoes piled up at the entryway, his own raincloud a mess of tears down his cheeks. "You're a fucking coward, Potter," Draco sniffs, his arms wrapped around himself, quivering. "Can't handle a few scars without—"
"My name's Harry," Harry said, his breath coming out controlled. "I know you're dense, but Merlin. Put another—"
The Great Hall of Hogwarts came pouring through the foyer. Ernie MacMillan and Hannah Abbott came hauling in a cauldron of soup. Three Weasleys popped in with pockets full of pranks. Then the Ravenclaws turned up with a Wireless in tow, belting
“Even in your daydreams, I wear black.” Draco pulls at the gauzy webbing around his neck. “Would it kill you to dream up a nicer fabric?”
The problem with shots was that two was fun and four was fine, but six and seven and eight turned nine and then you found yourself stumbling in an unlocked stall that was very much occupied by a Harry Potter sitting on the toilet with a box of pizza in his lap.
Harry dropped by in his sweaty Quidditch gear, broom still in hand when he found Draco inking in catalog cards at the kitchen table. "Busy?" he asked
Malfoy lives in a Victorian terrace with two roommates, and his jumper's threadbare though his hair is still nice. Why?
Underneath, the walls are a stale yellow. Harry drags a finger through the dust over Sirius's mirror, sees a corner of an eye, chapped lips.
their voices faraway like from the bottom of a canyon. But the sun dawns with time, and Harry with it, heavy and warm, as though Ron knit a jumper between his kidneys before he stitched him back up.
"Feels good," Harry whispers into the crook of Draco's neck. He pushes up to sitting, the mattress dipping as he shifts his weight.
"Right," Draco said. "Hand it over," he sighed, extending his hand. Was he really going to eat toilet pizza? There was no fighting it; the answer was always yes when it came to Harry Potter.
He lets me go to trace a finger down the old scar. “Came here straight from St Mungo’s. Drove me crazy, thinking of you,” he says. He wets his lips. I want to kiss him so bad that it’s hard to breathe.
I don't know why I tried. Boredom, maybe. The better question is why Potter let me. There he was, every day for hours on end, sitting through trial after bloody trial with his back straight and his eyes as dead as a marionette's. I followed the jagged scar down his brow and wondered, like I'd done for years, what went on in that perfect potty brain of his. Until one day, I simply—slipped in.
"He'll turn around," Harry says. "He's obsessed with me. He's always been." Harry doesn't know where the confidence comes from, but the more he says it, the more it sounds true to his own ears. If he doesn't believe it himself, then who will?
“Just helping him out. I’d do the same for you,” Harry said again and again, and, again and again, I swallowed around a funny feeling of despair.
Draco says I can have it back. He says he’s very sorry. He says he meant it as a gift, so I can see my mother with my own eyes, in a sense.
strums through Harry all through dinner. "Everyone deserves to be loved," announces Susan in a champagne-doused toast, so why not Harry? He won't ask for all of this. He doesn't even want a vow. Just something, anything declared out loud.
The bar is empty except for Draco and the barman, and they’re chatting — though Harry can tell it’s all bilge from how Draco lounges back with part of a hand swept through his hair, forgotten.
In Draco's dreams, he is running. Running forward into the light, the skin peeling off from him until he is eleven again, then ten, then five, crawling, crying, sobbing, his skin growing wrinkled and old, his hair sprouting full-white, and he's seventy, sixty, fifty, stocky limbs willowing down, slender until he's twenty-three again, and he's run all the way back to himself, full-circle.
The following week is so unbearably dull that Harry barely remembers what happens on which days. He does a photoshoot for Wheaties, then he models for a perfume that smells like arse. Ron says that if Harry keeps accepting sponsorships, nobody will trust what he endorses, which Harry thinks is a good thing. Harry's reputation could use some humbling. Then maybe he can ride a stationary broom without the world falling to pieces.
Eltanin finishes trimming the stems and sets the arrangement on the counter next to a box of cream-filled biscuits. He digs through a few drawers, continuing his search for a pen, until Harry finally bores of watching and transfigures a red marker out of butcher paper scraps.
Draco wears a lilac hoodie and stonewashed shorts that cut high up his thighs. His neon kicks stick out the window where he's propped them up. The sun/shade cleaves him through; two-toned light and dark, the left part of his long hair a halo and the right shorn clean off.
"Want any?" Harry asks. He walks to her barefoot. It takes him more than a few strides because his kitchen is so excessively massive.
Harry poses for photos with Hermione. He dutifully answers questions for the Prophet reporter, who, in turn, refrains from asking any about his personal life. Harry poses for a few more photos with Hermione's staff, and finally, after another hour or so of wrap up, Hermione finds him and envelopes him a hug, her eyes wet with tears. She says, "I don't even care if I win anymore. I'm just glad you're back on my team."
A growl builds at the back of Harry's throat. He hates it when Ginny acts like Harry's the biggest idiot in the room.
Harry turned back to me and took my hand into his. His palm was rough, like wool. “I know you didn’t.”
. Draco sat down on the edge of Harry's bed and took the book in his hand. It was as beautiful as he remembered it, the worn mustard canvas, the blue of the end band, the silver-patterned paste paper that shimmered as though wind moved through it.
"How many bartenders are there at Nylon?" Ginny casts her eyes across the room, trying to catch the attention of a server.
Hermione's words come out in a heaving sob, the disillusionment cracking with her concentration, her grip tightening painfully over burnt-orange fur.
Seasons change, edging him closer to the close with every passing snowfall. Yet when Draco leans on him in front of the fire, he feels sturdy as a tree, his roots reaching far beyond the Floo to evermore.
"What—oh. I lied. I broke it off with him a couple of days ago," Draco says. "It wasn't fair to him. It was pretty obvious to everyone that I was still hung up on you, but I thought it would be easier if I kept pretending—"
Malfoy looks back at him, his mouth agape, before swinging his leg over the handle. He closes his eyes as his face passes through a cloud, his arse bouncing over the seat. Harry summons a stronger breeze, and those twin globes bounce again as though on an invisible cock.
"I didn't sell it," Harry says about the weather system. "I know you said that it's the sensible thing to do, but I don't really want to."
"I'm just..." Draco sighs. Pansy can practically see him running an agitated hand through his hair. She's tickled over how much he cares about her, however misplaced.
"That's not true," Draco says. "I never believed in the prophecy. Believe me, I didn't. Father made sure of it. But, near the end, I started to believe in you."
It was a crisp morning in early September, and Diagon Alley filled with families finishing their back-to-school shopping. The door shut behind him, and Draco took one step forward into the fray. Then he backpedaled all the way back inside and hid in his room for the rest of the day.
Funny how you’re dead now and my Patronus comes to me like water from a river, flowing effortlessly from my wand with every memory of you. I see you in treacle tart and bacon, in the glint of the sun. In the sudden gust of wind that rocks me on my broom. And in the dead of the night when I’m the most alone, I feel your strength lending me the courage to move on.
Having Harry around is like watching a lion sleep. Sweet that you forget his teeth, the power coiled within his thighs.
What Harry likes most about weed is how all emotion slows to a roll, drifting by one at a time so that he can reach out and touch it, feel it, hold on to it. The joy of Draco’s knee against his as he fumbles with the rolling paper, finesse lost to fingertips crusted with kush. Fear and expectation drowned out to a half-parted mouth, an unhurried transition horizontal onto the sofa. When was the last time Harry could focus like this? Latch on to Draco’s face and lose himself in the shell of an ear, waiting for it to echo back his devotion.
"Well, it's nice to see you too," Draco said. He smiled like it was easy to. And then it slipped away to something more befitting the two of them.
The valet at Nylon takes his car with the same Lumos-bright grin as always. Harry's grateful it's not awkward, but why should it be? Who's going to hold a grudge against someone who sucked you off but refused to let you return the favour?
was what I’d written. So Draco came and dusted and kissed my temple and left for a late lecture. And, just like that, I could breathe again.
"Shit." Draco thrusts in vain, trapped under Harry's legs. Harry lifts his hips, Draco's cock slipping out of him until his arse just catches the rim, before slamming his hips back down. Draco wraps his hand around Harry's cock, and they catch a rhythm they're accustomed to now, fast so they can make the post-game interviews, so they can get on with the rest of their lives. Except Harry doesn't want to move on from this, not when Draco's offering the possibility of forever.
"Did I try the door—" Draco harrumphed. He reached for Harry's shoulders, to shake them, but his hands passed right through.
"She's alright," Harry says. "She helped me loads with the decorating. The trick is to let her do all the talking."
In the years since, Draco sees Potter plenty, though always from a distance. Meritocracy pushes Draco only so far, so he ends up with a desk position within the Aurors, signing off this and that, and playing the bad guy for the puppetmasters upstairs when the answer is no. Potter is infuriatingly polite, his voice measurably calm and his dismissal always impersonal. The others follow his lead, their words and actions a shallow replica of their Saviour, and with that example set, Draco leads a middling, tolerable existence.
morning, with little beyond your lover's eyes and the murmur of nonsense between him and you; soft as kitten paws, strong as trust.
bloody judgemental since you started dating Potter. It's like you sucked the sanctimonious straight out of his holy saviour cock. What happened to the Draco who jerked Theo off right under McGonagall's nose during Transfiguration? Now it's all ‘
"Sure you do," Hermione says. "That's why you're moping around, scheming up all the ways you can hate him back in your bed. Because you
It scared Harry how love worked; how Draco could get away with acting like Harry was the crazy one when it was his father who’d exploited Harry for fame.
"Sure you do. Why else would you drive around in a ridiculously expensive Muggle automobile, show up to the same loud bars, and pull increasingly outrageous shite every weekend? Because it'll keep the paps off of you? No, I think you like the attention. I think you're lonely as fuck, and all you want is somebody to look at you."
Harry reached for Draco's dick. His body tensed upon contact. "You’re not even hard," Harry said. "Are you a virgin? You know you can't fuck anyone with a floppy dick—"
After the war Harry is clumsy in a way that seems light and easy and not at all embarrassing or irritating. He bumps shoulders and knocks wrists and trips ankles and then he picks himself up and says sorry, but then he smiles so soft and loose that Draco can tell that he’s not sorry at all. So when Harry stumbles and lands a kiss straight on Draco’s mouth and apologizes, Draco says, “No, you’re not”, and then kisses him back, thinking how nice it is to not have to think so hard before making decisions anymore.
"You give so much without asking for anything back. Take Granger's campaign. You'll campaign for her even though it kills you, and you get nothing to show for it at all. I just want to see you get what you deserve."
," Draco said. He handed the book to Harry, who stroked the embossed title with gentle fingers before passing it back.
“So I’ve come down in person to savour the utter disappointment on your face when whoever you meant to send this owl to never showed up, and it was just me, your childhood nemesis—”
Across from him, Hermione nicks little nail imprints into her pickle, her leg shaking up an earthquake. "You can't know that," Hermione says. "The numbers say—"
"Sort of," Harry says, distracted by a glint of gold from the west entrance. The blond shoves past the bouncer, revealing another disappointment.
My own affections fester within me, building momentum until it’s a tornado of turmoil tearing through my chest with nowhere to go.
"Yeah," she says. "Yes. Ah, sorry. It's another speech." She wipes her nose with the back of her sleeve, then Scourgifies the snot away before handing him the parchment. "God, I hope the cameras didn't catch me with snot all over my sleeve."
"I have a system," Draco said. "Comfort reads by comforting objects. Fun stories where the light shines brightest and dark reads in dark spaces—under beds, behind closed cupboards."
The other day Harry mixes up the bottles at the apothecary and picks up a Forgetfulness Potion instead of his usual Sleeping Draught. The potioneer at the counter gives him an odd look when Harry takes out his coin purse to pay for it, but Harry disregards him because the potioneer is Draco Malfoy. That night, when Harry gets ready for bed he notices the tag on the potion, blue instead of the usual yellow, and realizes the mixup. But it’s already past midnight, and he’s had a long day, so he pretends he doesn’t see it and knocks the potion back in one gulp.
The scar curves up Draco's chin and cuts across the lower lip in a jagged white line. "You have two hands," Harry reasons, his eyes on Draco's mouth.
“Err,” Harry said, looking around, confused. “The radiomagnetic repulsor, which may be recognisable by some professors at Hogwarts, as—” He scowled. “Draco, your line?”
Eltanin glances at the wall clock, his lips pursed in thought. "Actually…" he says, his smile quirking playfully again, "do you want to smoke a blunt?"
I lost my godfather to the Veil when I was young. His passing hit hard, his absence like fragments of my future torn off and left to fray. “Such a pity,” others said, and I would nod, a silent rage unwinding in the back of my throat.
Last week, I threw a pumpkin out the window. It didn’t do much. Just kind of exploded and then laid there real quiet, like it didn’t mean to do that. Not that it mattered. It was noon. Nobody was around to get pumpkin juiced or anything. I watched it rot under the sun all afternoon until Harry came strolling home and stepped around it to get inside. He hollered up, “You threw that pumpkin out?” And I said, “Yeah,” plenty loud right back down. I heard him rummaging in the closet downstairs, so it wasn’t a surprise or anything when the front door slammed again. He scrubbed that sidewalk whiter than it’d ever been. Then he came back inside and stomped upstairs to the bedroom, where I waited with my arms still dangling out the window. He walked right up to me and kissed me, and asked how my day was. “Fine,” I said. “How was yours?”
Harry let out a peal of laughter. "No, but god—can you imagine. The look on your face—don't tell me, you
Harry Floos home after and changes out of his joggers, standing before his bathroom mirror to comb his hair and shave his beard. He takes out the bottle of cologne that Ginny bought him when they were still together and holds it in his hand, considering, before shelving it back in the cabinet.
It is forty minutes later when Harry’s Auror partner Ron Weasley asks him if he is alright. Says, “it can’t be easy to watch anyone go like that, even if you hated him”, and “I know I’m definitely feeling something; you don’t have to hide it if you do too”, and a few more words about how it’s totally okay if Harry isn’t okay.
Harry waits. He’s very patient now that the days have slowed. All those extra years in his life that need filling up.
“I didn’t know Muggle things could be good or bad.” They couldn’t hold a curse. That was why I liked them.
Draco growled, trying to sit up and flip them over, get in control again. "Let me fuck you," he said. "Let me fuck you proper. I'll show you, show you what it's like with a Malfoy—"
Harry swallows back his denial. He's sick of all this truth talk. "Look, I'll reconnect the bloody broom. Can we fuck already?"
Draco's face is pinched, his mouth open and drooling. He's not pretty but he's all for Harry. "You're going to burn me up inside," Harry murmurs as he slots their mouths, their tongues sliding together. He's so close that he just might die.
Harry slides both his palms behind Malfoy, under the elastic of those joggers, and squeezes. Malfoy gasps, twisting back in time for Harry to capture his lips. Harry slides onto the broom behind him, wrapping an arm around Malfoy's waist to grasp at his cock.
It's wrapped up in thirty, though an exec hauls Harry aside and pitches him their new Star Athletes program for another fifteen.
“You’ve got something in there,” Draco informed Potter, to which Potter only smiled and held up his hands like he had nothing to conceal. So Draco had him take off the coat, the waistcoat, the tie, the shirt, the undershirt — too many layers for a healthy man under the precise laboratorial temperature of 23.8'C — until finally, Draco’s hand met flesh, and there was nothing left to uncover except for Potter’s heart flashing blue from the alarm system.
Draco flicks his wrist and Vanishes the paper away, declaring, "Nothing new in the paper today." Into the coffee go two heavy pours of cream, followed by an accidental splash of citrus when Harry cuts an orange down to generous portions. Out of the corner of his eye, yesterday's Draco twirls Harry into his arms over and over again, the Italian coast foaming at their feet. Harry grins, nudging the frame with a playful pinky as he gathers the mugs in a levitation spell (one yellow, one chipped).
"With the biscuits, please? Remind me, what book were you talking about again, with the two flowers?"
Ron and Hermione live atop a steep hill with a good view of the city from one side and more hill on the other. It was a hassle to get anywhere on foot. Here, however, the streets flatten out to a smooth plane, the road quiet and empty, the trees evenly spaced apart.
"I'm going to kill Pansy," Draco murmured, overwhelmed and angry, and stalked up the stairs in search of her. But there was no one upstairs, and Draco, too tempted by the quiet to resist, crawled back into his own bed and hid behind a book.
I couldn’t meet her eyes, so I looked at her hands, watching her fiddle the peridot on her pinky. I wasn’t sure if I should’ve gleaned its significance. Then she coughed, and I realized that her mask had slipped.
Potter leaned on Draco’s hotel room door with his hands in the pockets of his coat as though he were cold, though the corridor was perfectly room-temperature. Draco took one look at him and turned on his heel, though of course Potter caught up.
I was happy. I was the happiest I’ve ever been. But I didn’t know how to explain that happiness wasn’t worth the pain of its end, because nothing good lasts forever. Every memory sours with time.
"Don't tell Hermione." Harry's chest thuds. "Why would you tell Hermione?" Why didn't he let Ginny finish her sentence?
Too hot, too damp, too cold, too dry — Harry can’t ever seem to get comfortable at Hogwarts anymore. It becomes especially bad in winter when the air dries out so severely that any time Harry pulls on a jumper, he pops out looking like Bellatrix’s nerdy younger brother. Hermione says it’s because one of the Death Eaters messed up the HVAC when coming through the Vanishing Cabinet the year before, so Harry takes that to mean that it’s Draco Malfoy’s fault, again. He stops Draco in the halls and shoves him up against the wall by the robes, his skin prickling, Draco’s hair standing up like a dandelion poof. “You feel that, Potter?” Draco asks, and Harry shivers. There’s always electricity between them, he doesn’t need static to remind him of that.
"Right? Bloody suspicious that I always end up with the same one," Harry whispers back, but Ginny's already flashing a wide grin at the bartender.
Draco leaves the perfumed invitation on his bedside table half-folded in a paper doily, pink ribbon unknotted and crumpled to the side, the morning light a hot slice of summer lancing across the front.
“Then he said that the Humplevorts were down his trousers, so I had him take them off,” Luna says. The fire licks at her smile; ignites it.
Mother’s Paris parlour was a riotous affair of colour. Verdant walls grew busy bouquets of chrysanthemum and baby’s-breath. Peacock feathers and peonies filled vases of jade and green glass. They crowded the fireplace mantle, jingling whenever the Floo flared to life—which wasn’t often—as I was the only one permitted in. Limiting visitors to family was the sort of psychological self-flagellation that tradition bequeathed a widow. But still—the decor was unexpectedly garish, especially after the greys of Malfoy Manor.
"Attics are alright," Harry says, "though I don't have a real need for them. I use all my stuff." And attics were for memories, if Harry went by the boxes of generations-old photo albums and childhood crafts stacked high at the Burrow.
"Ron's given up on me," Harry says. He checks the rearview mirror before changing lanes. The driver behind him flips him off, and Harry gives them the finger right back. "Hermione, though."
Draco took out his own Sickle, the one he kept around because it was heads on both sides—a guaranteed win. "I'll toss," Draco said, rubbing the trick Sickle between his fingers. He tossed, called heads, and won. Dead simple. And now he was going to fuck Harry Potter.
He holds up a live feed of our living room from his mobile. Stella, our crup, is making a meal out of our cushions. But all I see is him and his sloppy, too-wide grin. He’s a miracle.
The pizza: delicious. Was there a more perfect creation than baked dough and sauce and cheese? A gift from the gods only second to Harry Potter himself. Draco closed his eyes and followed his nose, his head dizzy and his movements off-balanced.
Running off to Alazambar two years after the war should've solved all of Draco's problems, but the past keeps looping back like an LED billboard, deja vu every thirty seconds and every man looking like Harry Potter until they don't.
for @drarrymicrofic prompt: wait. mob boss wife vibes heavily inspired by that vince vega mia wallace scene in pulp fiction.
Ron puts down the menu and reaches for his water glass. "The takeaway in your fridge? Where do you think it comes from?"
No, not quite. Draco's been an itch under Harry's skin since the day they met. Whatever Draco is, is more than quid pro quo, though Harry doesn't understand how.
"The sky was blue too, over Wiltshire,” Draco says. “On occasion, anyway,” which is to say that their childhoods were nothing alike, nothing drawn in parallel, nothing to pick out and say, “Me too! We’re the same, after all.”
They move to the living room. The fireplace ignites upon entering—it's charmed to do that—giving the otherwise stark room a strange, warm tint.
"That's not—Harry, I'm never too busy for you. I have no idea what I'm doing with the campaign. I mean, it's not like I've done it before. Sometimes, I think I'm in way over my head—"
"You asked," Harry laughs. God, he feels good. Sometimes he just wants to push Ron to his limits and watch him squirm.
Draco licked up the long line of neck, his breath hot and ragged. "Who's the virgin now," he taunted. His thumb traced up Harry's cheek, brushing away sweaty bangs in time to see Harry's eyes squeeze shut as he came all over Draco's fist.
at Hogwarts, but now he picks up Harry's calls, even when Harry's been a shit to him. Was it really so farfetched to assume that Draco would always do exactly the opposite of everyone else?
A cruise ship came in today, and off it ran wizards and Muggles and everyone in between, like sprigs of basil in twos and threes and more. Draco is twenty-three and prepared for the crowds as he is every July, the ice bucket double-charmed and fortified, a triple shipment of limes stocked, and extra lounge chairs laid out on the beach where only stray dogs slumber on ordinary days.
Draco doesn’t like mirrors so it’s not until Harry comes home late one night asking if Draco saw the message he left that Draco realizes what he’s been missing. Draco is already in near tears with worry. He thought Harry was dead. But when he tries to explain that he doesn’t look into mirrors, that he hasn’t since sixth-year, what comes out is a sort-of lie about how he must’ve missed it, and how it won’t happen again.
“King James.” Harry crooks a finger, beckoning, and the room whorls around them in a dizzying smear of crimson and gold. Draco lands on the cold metal plate of Harry’s cuisse.
If it were anyone else, Harry would've gotten in their face about it already. He'd say something like, "If you wanna fuck me, then you gotta kiss me too." Or "Listen, my bed would be loads more comfortable for your knees." Or, even, "Dinner?" But Draco isn't just anyone, and that's the whole thing, isn't it? One hand down Draco's chest, and Harry's in the second-floor girl's loo again with his robes drenched in Draco's blood. It's a fucked up thing to have done to someone you want to love.
They kiss and kiss and kiss, and Harry doesn't know how to stop. He chases it even when Malfoy digs nails into his wrists and pulls away. When they can breathe again, Malfoy runs fingers through his hair and comes out with a handful of spaghetti. His shoulders shake with mirth. Then Malfoy says it again—
"I feel like I'm robbing a mortuary," Ron says about Harry's bar at 12 Grimmauld Place. He's not far from the truth. The countertop is a white, veiny marble, corpse-pale and clammy to the touch. Ron pours them each two fingers of bourbon and makes a face at the dust on the glass before knocking it back.
"Booty call," Harry says, to which Ron squawks but doesn't correct him. He acts properly apologetic for leaving Harry by himself, which is ridiculous because what is the point of all this money if it isn't for buying company? And Ron is as dull a slug as any.
Malfoy blinks, his long lashes brushing beneath bruised lids. Harry lifts his hand to rub the bit of sleep left in the corner of Malfoy's left eye but catches his thumb on Malfoy's lower lip instead. They're smooth and well taken care of but already a little red. Harry wants to ruin them with his own. He takes a stumbling step forward, bracing his arms against the door and lurching toward Malfoy's face, hoping Malfoy picks up the cue.
"I don't know anything about numbers," Harry says. He pulls the cigarette from her hand and Vanishes it.
She slaps him across the face. "NO WAY. Oh, shit, sorry—" she takes the sting off Harry's cheek with a wave of her wand, "—but, Malfoy, really? Merlin, I can't believe—"
"Terrible," Harry scowls. "The biggest mistake of my life." He pulls open Hermione's fridge. Inside is two beers and a box of seltzer water. His reflection bounces off one of the cans, and he catches it for a second. "Most fuckable prettiest lips in the league," Draco had said, right before he shoved his cock between them.
“Have you ever considered the glow of a candle in a dark room,” Draco says in the still space between them, his eyes a shining yellow as unblinking as the moon.
Hermione smiles in near tears. "You've never actually said that you believed in my campaign before."
Harry finished off the slice and threw the crust behind him with a regal flick of his wrist reminiscent of a pizza rat king sitting on his toilet throne. He pulled another piece from the half-eaten box and lifted it to his lips, his eyes never leaving Draco's. Then he paused, his brow furrowed as though seeing Draco for the first time.
Ron bangs his teaspoon. "Stop doing that," he says. "You look bloody maniacal, petting your purse like that."
that space? Do we get reassembled or put back together, or is that Apparition? Can you imagining flowing through the Floo and getting mixed up with someone else, maybe something else, and you come out half-Granger-half-meatloaf-sandwich?”
Harry tried to find out once, long ago. Flew up and up and up until his fingers froze numb and he couldn't breathe anymore. It wasn't fun.
Woodfire ash and glow. The warm hum of a song cottoning in the ear. A cascade of crimson silk under my fist. Laughter gurgles in my throat; boils over when the woman takes me in her arms and I look into her eyes, green as the last flash before the world goes still.
He was always scared. He was scared of the dark, of hippogriffs, of what Voldemort would do to his family—his future. “I’m always scared,” he said when I asked him if he was scared when Scorpius was born. When he’d first kissed me, and his father had disowned him. Twenty years and some things never changed. He was always scared—cheeks aflame; heart fluttering double-timed to mine.
Molly lets the crup down. A glimmer of green catches her eye, and she turns to it, staring into the half-shuttered windows of a cafe. Her reflection stares back, solemn under dusky streetlights.
"Me too," Harry gasps and squeezes his hand tighter, unable to stop the building pressure as Draco squirms over him, breathing harshly into his ear.
Day after day he asks increasingly complicated questions. Questions like: will he pass his classes? Will his mother be well when he calls on her? Will his father survive the winter in Azkaban? Uncertainty begins creeping into the answers: probably, likely, not likely.
Harry clicked his tongue. "I'm sure it's all a misunderstanding." He waited for his student to leave before sharing a knowing look with the portrait of the late Headmistress McGonagall.
Eltanin rolls his eyes. "Draco's not usually like this," he whispers conspiratorially to Harry. "I don't know what crawled up his arse and died, but he can suck it for all I care."
Most people insist I didn’t really kill Voldemort. They make arguments like, I refracted back his own curse, or he was going to kill me anyway, and that was what mattered. All of that is true. But another truth is, I would have choked him dead with my bare hands if he hadn’t fucked up and did half the job for me. That’s the difference between me and Hermione. I murdered my first man at seventeen.
Inside are tables stacked with chairs and a funky retro menu board. What a funny little cafe. She'll have to tell Ron about it when she gets back.
It’s incredible how little you need in your head to pass as a functioning adult human being. There is a door, so open it. Step outside and pick up the paper. Go on ahead. It’s there, waiting for you. Feel the weight in your hand: unsubstantial; smooth. It’s an innocuous little thing, isn’t it? If left unread.
“Where?” Draco asked. The ends of his mouth kept twitching, though he tried to hide it behind his hand.
"What do you want to do today?" Draco asks later in the kitchen. Ron's left a box of asparagus wrapped in strips of wagyu beef, and they eat it with a side of fried eggs and orange juice.
“Right,” Harry says. From the stands, Draco is a tiny matchstick on top of the vert ramp. Harry knows it’s him more than he can see that it’s him.
Harry hates politics, and it's all they ever want him to do. He's getting a headache just listening to Ginny talk about it.
When Draco was maybe ten feet in front of him, he stopped again. He appraised Harry for a few seconds with his mouth curiously pursed before saying, "What's so funny."
"Don't say it like that," she says. She pulls on a bright yellow hoodie that's cropped at the waist. "It's only that she's helped me realise things."
"You make it easy to hate you," Harry says. "Even I know better than to show up at an ex's restaurant."
With my eyes shut tight, the choice is clear. I follow my nose down the copper beneath his neck, and bite.
Draco says his room's the third one from the elevator, though it's not like Harry needs to know, because he follows him there. "Do you like this," Harry says to the arch of a spine. "Do you like me," he asks the skin of Draco's neck. Do you, do you still like me when I'm drunk. Do you like me enough to say it to a crowd.
Harry's still thinking about the great outside while he showers. What makes a Pensieve work? Could he take a good memory—flying over the Great Lake, maybe—and ride through it? Would it actually work out his physical body?
The valet won't give Harry his keys, so Harry pays him to drive him home. The valet is blond and pretty, with a cupid's bow mouth, though his chin is too soft. Close enough. Harry coaxes him to the back of the Bugatti, where he nestles his nose between golden pubic curls and sucks the valet off with sloppy, wet slurps before pushing him out of the car.
I’m in a room and seeing another from when things were golden-hued and begonias bloomed where you walked and bells rang when you laughed and your eyes shimmered like the silver reflection of a lake in the distance. I want to go back to that time so badly that my whole chest sticks to itself like a wad of gum. Like I’m stuck in the past, skipping breaths until I can be with you again.
Draco looks back over his shoulder. "Do you wanna complain some more? Or you can fuck me. I've got fifteen minutes before the post-game, your choice."
Sunshine drips from Draco's face like tangerine juice beading down a glass, Sunny D but without the fake stuff
Potter takes the report and continues to his desk. Padma stops him, and Draco watches them laugh over something Potter says before Padma moves on, smiling. Ron sits on Potter’s desk an hour later, loudly joking about the birthday party he has planned for his daughter. The alarms blare sometime in the afternoon — illegal potions, two dead and counting — and Potter sets down his coffee, reaching for his wand with the same coolness as he would for a pen or a biscuit.
The skin between his eyes. The minutes between his hours. The moments between our meetings. How do I explain that the spaces between his days and the nights he spends alone are, in a way, still mine? That I love him for everything he does as much as for everything he doesn’t? How do I explain that the shape of his being is more than his body; that, to me, he is the universe?
"Fuck it," Harry says and casts an amplification charm over the bell-shaped speaker. The verse comes in booming:
“We talk about how our mums and das don’t live together,” Albus explains during spring recess a few months later, porridge-crusted spoon danging from his mouth.
All this fame and all it buys is drugs and sex with strangers. It isn't that Harry doesn't respect women—he's gagged on a fair share of cocks himself—it's that he doesn't respect anyone, really. Least of all himself.
The redhead grabs him by the scruff. “Hold on, okay?” The two make eyes at each other until the wifebeater guy backs down with a snarl. The redhead turns back to Harry. “My mom was a Weasley. What do you want?”
"The bloody train wouldn't let me on," Draco said, huffing. "I waited around all week, but the door never opened once. I closed my eyes when I couldn't stay up anymore, and when I woke up again, I was here."
“You pulled your hood up. The grey one that practically everyone owns a copy of. Even Mum Weasley couldn’t recognise you wearing that.” Then he yawned like he was waiting for Harry to leave, so he could go to bed.
"I have several blond friends…but yes, the one I had in mind is my roommate. He's the type that Harry—can I call you that?—usually goes for. You know, blond, pointy."

Draco snaked a hand down Harry’s pants (which were under Harry’s trousers, in case you were wondering).
Harry follows him to their closet, where Draco pulls out a frame wrapped in brown parchment. Harry knows a little of what to expect, and his head’s dizzy just thinking about it, his fingers clumsy like he’s forgotten how to use them.
They sentenced me to a year's worth of community service. The chains came off my hands as I flooded back into my own body. I wanted to cry. I yawned instead.
It isn’t something either of them would have done, on their own. Scorpius reads it in a picture book. He says, “Please?”, and a small village rises from lumpy pillows and wrinkled sheets.
He works on his father for all of spring and summer, asking questions like: Will his father survive if he bribes a ministry official? If he sends chocolates on Christmas? Or every Sunday?
"I can do another speech," Harry says. He picks up the parchment: income equality, climate change, powdered dragon puff deregulation. It all sounds very smart. Harry tucks it into his pocket.
I found the mirror in the dungeon cell, positioned directly across the cot where Luna had slept those grimy last months of the war. Of course, I knew what it was. The Mirror of Erised is as old as magic itself, an artefact more holy than material. I didn't touch it at first, but I looked. And that was my mistake, wasn't it? Or maybe it was my saving grace. It's hard to know pleasure from pain when I cry all the same. Maybe it was both.
That was three days ago. Tonight, Molly is walking her youngest son's crup alone, at nine-pm, because her youngest son's girlfriend kicked her out. All over a bleedin' dinner, too. Okay, sure. Maybe Molly shouldn't have cooked up a whole roast when Hermione said she was bringing home pizza. But who in their right mind would ever choose glorified cheese toasties over their mum's home cooking?
Harry stretched his neck long, his face turned to the sky. He felt like he was being pushed up through the dirt, his throat thick and his hair streaked sloppy over his eyes. He wondered if, finally, it was spring.
Malfoy's cock grows thick, and Harry chokes as it hits the back of his throat. Harry kneads fingers into Malfoy's arse, pressing him flush so he can't pull off. Malfoy whines and whines and whines, but it comes through muffled because his thighs clench tight around Harry's ears. Harry can't breathe, and he can't hear, and his eyes blur, but he doesn't let off until Malfoy comes so hard that cum drips out of Harry's nose.
The bathroom they share in Grimmauld Place is lined up to Draco’s chest in pale yellow subway tile. The rest is wallpapered in white narcissuses that remind Draco of his mother. The wallpaper looks fresh even though Draco knows Harry didn’t put it up himself. It’s obvious which rooms Harry redid and which ones he hasn’t. When Draco walks between them he feels as though he’s being ricocheted between his past and his future.
He upended his trunks in search of more books. Books! Where could he acquire more—Flourish and Blotts? No! He needed more bookshelves, first.
Harry traces a wrinkle down Draco’s palm. He crosses it with his own, his other hand curling down Draco’s waist. When he closes his eyes, he can see their heartstrings all around him, tangled up together. What he remembers is: now.
"And you simply willed it into being," Eltanin says. He shakes his head. "Voldemort didn't stand a chance. Do you really not know how impossible the feat you performed was? I suppose your friends are accustomed to it, but Draco must've said
matter? I've had my cock in you, and you don't even bloody recognise my best friend, nevermind that she went to the same school with you for seven years—"
"Bloody ouch, Hermione. Can't you let a bloke wake up before you start tearing into him? If you wanted to kill me, you could've done it years ago."
God, Malfoy. They didn't exchange a word at the club, but Harry already wants to take his cock out and shut Malfoy up with it. He undoes the button and lets the zipper split itself open the rest of the way, his cock jutting out and springing back slightly, the tip already slick with precum. He licks his palm and imagines Malfoy swallowing his length, hot and wet and choking enough for his eyes to water.
Harry kisses him. The world bursts in colours around him, light, dizzying and forbidden as a shaken can of soda stolen from Dudley's school bag.
Harry’s shift starts early so he leaves his good mornings on the mirror in pink lippy. The lippy is one that Ginny left behind; the messages are for Draco.
I spread Potter's fingers. I cracked his knuckles. I locked eyes with old Mrs Longbottom from across the courtroom and gave her the stinkiest stink eye I could manage with Potter's thick brows. Still no reaction. When the Chief Warlock banged his gavel and ended the day's session, I got onto Potter's feet and followed everyone to the Floos.
BroomBod has classes in thirty, forty-five, and sixty-minute increments. Harry selects sixty and regrets it in the first five. The trainers try to pump it up with music and overly-enthusiastic mantras, but there's no rush from nose-diving towards a Snitch or flying buffeted by the rain. Maybe if Harry conjures a gust of wind, the damp dew of clouds, then he won't die of boredom.
Draco had a good body, almost unjustly so, if it weren’t for his bony elbows. Sex with him bruised me up, but I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t what was good about it. It was a distraction from the nightmares.
"Hi," he says again, the next day, the next, the next, the bright crimson soles of his trainers flapping ahead until he disappears, around a bend.
, he said in my dreams. Here, his hand only roams down to the base of my neck, where it sears into my skin like a brand.
Harry peels off the Statis charm and sniffs. Passable. He catches another before it smacks into his face. Then another, and another. Malfoy sends over twenty boxes in total, fifteen of which haven't spoiled, and pulls out all of Harry's good china (a gift from Molly, who should have known better) from dusty cabinets so he can plate the selection. There's caviar and oysters with generous squeezes of lemon and hot sauce, half flanks of steak oozing hot from a reheat. There's a half-empty bottle of Fiji and plastic containers of guacamole, kao soi with a side of garlic bread, toro and uni and hamachi over a bed of reinvigorated chips, duck tongue and lengua from that time Harry got curious and didn't regret it.
He thumbed the page with a hesitant hand. "I'm only about halfway through, but it's all very exciting. Lots of action, and they've developed a secret code of communication with each other using flowers and mind-reading. Right now, they're trying to overturn the government, but they're arguing about ways to do it, which created a bit of a rift between them and friends they used to trust."
Harry blinks, three dizzying points of light swirling his vision. He shakes his head. Right. There's Parkinson with her hands on her hips, looking like an anaconda escaped from the zoo. Harry hadn't recognised her with her hair dip-dyed pink. And she definitely didn't grow those boobs until after Hogwarts. Except, why does Harry care about
The bartender pushes a third drink toward Harry, who downs it before standing up to leave. No use in wasting good alcohol; Ron would be proud of him.
Cherry lips stained dark & sugared against skin smooth as cream. Harry imagines them sticky against his mouth; each kiss sweet & slick on his tongue, cool until it flambés down his throat, where he’s choking with want. Touching Draco feels like drowning, like his every breath, burning.
“I met Reynolds at a party my father threw after everything went to shit. He was the only guy young enough to remember the first time he fucked someone, so, yeah. I talked to him.”
The girls leave Harry, and blessedly, the rest of the patrons do too. Harry continues on, throwing coins into guitar cases and stopping by the empanadas stand for a snack. The wind whips through his jumper, and he breathes it in, letting it fill his lungs. Then that's when he smells them: lilies.
Ginny comes over a couple of hours later to get away from Dean while they're still dividing up their assets. She's disgusted by the kitchen island. Who wouldn't be? Harry didn't bother covering it with a Stasis, and now the food's beginning to rot. Still, he doesn't clean it up, even though Vanishing it all away is as easy as wiping his own arse. Having it there brings him a certain solace, like looking into a mirror and seeing exactly what you expect.
Harry laughs. He has no idea what he wants to say, but Draco doesn't need to know that. "Alright," Harry says. "We have a deal. You first."
Harry catches Malfoy's wrist in his hand on an impulse, though he has no idea what to do once he has it. So he lets it drop and rolls over onto his side, feigning sleep while Malfoy gets dressed to leave.
“The eggs I acquired from a farm in East Anglia. The chocolate, precisely five-hundred milligrams of it, I had delivered from—”
Malfoy shakes his head, his left hand kneading anxiously over his chest. "Look, I don't want to be here either, but—"
"Ah," Ron says, leaning back. "I can see how that works." The server drops off a plate of tuna poke. Ron grabs a crisp, chewing. "So, what went wrong with Malfoy?"
He arrives at the venue with five minutes to spare. Someone magics his hair neat and his stubble trimmed, and then he's whisked to the podium, where he says a few words about how great Hermione is and will be for everyone in the world. His speech rings true. Hermione
"I know," Malfoy says. "I thought I heard wrong when Stella said that you were using it. You just didn't seem the type. Too wild." Malfoy pushes his hair back to smirk at Harry before turning to the broom. He waves a hand through the atmosphere again. "Can you adjust the conditions so that it feels like we're a dozen metres up?"
Upstairs, Harry opens a window and spells a breeze through, smelling of grass and lemon. Draco watches him from the bed, a curious expression playing across his face.
It’s a hot day outside. Harry hears the potioneer calling his name, although he doesn’t know why. So he smiles and asks, “I’m sorry, do I know you?”
Harry wondered what it’d be like, to be buried under it, to have soil fill his lungs. Would saplings take root in his chest? Would he be a home to life, again?
Stuff starts accumulating in the cabin; things like silver spoons, silk pants, photographs, a crystal peacock. It’s all stuff that he’s pretty sure isn’t his but still feels like his when he sees them. Like how someone seems like yours because you love them (when in reality, nothing owns anything (except maybe time)).
Last night, someone came through Harry’s mind and gave it a good scrub for his own good. When I say scrub, I mean that someone took a rag to every thought and scoured off all the lovely messy colour until every last one was plain white and cast no shadow. If you lick it, it would taste exactly like an empty room.
"Fine," Draco huffs. "I suppose you're right. Don't laugh at me, okay? Vol—Merlin, why is it so difficult.
That summer, his cock in our fist, sparks in my heart when we bought him trainers that didn't squeeze his toes. He kept surprising me, little reminders here and there that I existed outside of my own mind. Or his mind. Whatever. It was nothing I wanted, and that was what made it good.
Draco’s clawed hand hovers over the flame as it licks up toward him. Any closer and his palm will start to sweat as though he’s melting.
"But as for me, I have no idea," Harry shouts over her. "I'm no good at anything except murdering evil dark lords and beating Malfoy to the Snitch. Who would I have left if I didn't hate Malfoy anymore?"
Harry does know. The wizarding world is small and stifling traditional; there’d been maybe one divorce in the last fifty years, before the Malfoy-Greengrass Potter-Weasley doubleheader. It was a literal double header: they’d shared a line on the front page of the Prophet. Rivals, even in marital separation. Jesus. Harry needs a drink, just thinking of it.
The crup whines again, circling between Molly's legs. She picks up the fuzzball and gives him a good scratch behind the ears. "Alright, alright," she says. "I forgive you." He's a cute bugger, she'll give him that. Got a face that can get away with anything. Just like her youngest boy.
"Do you hate this?" Draco lifts his arm. His sleeve is a gauzy green, the kind pine trees are made of.
The man sitting on trial has hair and eyes and just one nose. He has a neck that tilts his eyes downcast. His mouth has corners that hang down his chin. He is on trial, which means that he sits in a wooden booth so that other people can ask him questions.
. Whatever's in your head is ridiculous," Draco says. "You're about as charismatic as they come. You've had people believing in you since you were eleven."
"I bought out my fucking neighbours," Harry hollers back. But he lowers the volume with a flick of his wrist.
“I KNOW,” the stranger shouts back, hoarse but electric: zap-zap snaps down Draco’s spine. Draco turns ten degrees per beat until he meets Harry’s eyes, strobing neon voltaic green.
ask for his name?) slides three plastic cups in front of them. Ron and Ginny, in a rare moment of Weasley-sibling unity, knock the entire contents back before smashing the empty cups down on the bar.
Harry’s mouth quirks. “Right.” He continues around the lilies, careful to avoid the skull. The snake unfurls leathery wings, eyes glinting jewel-green. Harry moves on, up Draco’s arm, to his mouth.
Fresh-ground coffee, brewed in a Chemex Harry found in a ratty cardboard box pushed to the back of the Potter vault, behind a tall stack of Gringotts gold. Two steaming mugs and yesterday's photograph beside it, encased in an empty wooden frame left on Dumbledore's desk. Tomatoes from Molly's garden, and cucumbers and radishes too, with still-warm slices of sourdough and a creamy ball of burrata slit down the radius and spilling out to be served.
Harry walks through the neighbourhood the next day with no plan in mind besides curiosity. Someone's playing music that's more pleasant than provoking from the other end of the park, and he follows it until he stumbles on a farmer's market bustling with produce and people. He tries samples of strawberries and peaches on bamboo toothpicks and poses for a photo with three primary schoolers, who burst into giggles if Harry so much as breathes.
Harry Apparates to Draco's door and knocks. Eltanin answers, saying Draco's out, but he'll take the bouquet and leave a message if Harry tells him what to say.
"Well." This is the part that gets dodgy. Harry isn't the type to give up, and yet... "I don't want to be a creep," he decides after a moment.
He loves me with damp eyes and trembling fingers, with stiff shoulders and a sweat-slick brow. He loves me, though he’s never confessed in the light of day when the sun illuminates the impossibilities.
Ron interrupts him with a deliberately loud suck of his horchata, but he's all big-eyed when Harry shoots him a look. "What?" Ron shrugs. "It's a reasonable question. You hated him for a long, long time."
Eltanin turns up the Wireless to something loud that is more a rhythmic pulse than a melody. Harry recognises the song as the one playing when Draco got down on his knees and sucked Harry off in his shower all those weeks ago. It's stupid how much everything reminds Harry of Draco. He can't even wake up without missing Draco in the sheets with him, and then he goes and sinks himself into a sofa that smells like Draco next to a roommate that won't stop talking about all the good things Draco's ever said about Harry. Why does Harry do this to himself?
The door jingles. A man in a red t-shirt enters with a cap pulled low over his eyes. He walks up to the counter and drops a duffel at his feet before sitting down.
"That's not it," Harry says quickly. He steps forward to tug the sodden cloak from Draco's shoulders. "You need to get out of this, otherwise—"
Harry parks the car in front of the big restaurant window and holds down the horn until Hermione looks up from where she's waiting inside and scowls at them.
Draco propped himself up on one elbow and pushed into Harry, angling for his prostate, his eyes locked on Harry's face as he watched it twist with pleasure. He wrapped a hand around Harry's cock between them before thrusting once, cradling the back of Harry’s neck in his hand. “How’s that? You like it? Like that Malfoy dick?”
Yesterday: Hermione's cat got loose; Ron had a heart attack when he found him in his work bag. Kingsley wants Harry to give another speech. Classes are boring, Junior Auror duty is boring, people suck. Also, the canteen food was nearly unpalatable — pizza! More like congealed cheese over bread.
Harry traces the blurred borders of Draco’s body from his feet down past his mouth, his eyes. He looks back at the pinhole and imagines Draco on the other side, straight-backed and serious and solid all the way through. Here, he’s a smudge of a soul, curling in Harry’s heart.
The alarms in Draco’s lab at the manor went off as soon as they landed. Draco should have known Potter was reckless enough to side-along unannounced, but, in his defence, he was distressed, and the alarms were
"He has to work tomorrow," Draco says, his nose held high. Why did it take Harry so many years to see how much vulnerability Draco hid behind arrogance? All Harry wanted to do at Hogwarts was punch that nose off of Draco's face.
Delicate like the gossamer close of lids, the pale flutter of lashes; delicate like the gauzy cling of lace up the neck. Delicate fingers, slender and exacting, reaching through jagged ribs to the coarse muscle encaged, whispering Harry soft; fragile; vulnerable. He knows he can break them, but he doesn’t.
If Ginny were Hermione, she would have cast a Scourgify on him already. But as she's not, she only sticks out her tongue before snatching the rest of Harry's pizza out of his hand.
"I'm happy to do it, really," Harry says. "I believe in you more than I believe in politics. And Greengrass is bloody awful. Draco's been telling me all about him. You're going to win because you are loads better than that war-profiteering cretin. I know it."
Draco saw Potter all around the Healer Conference though he never got within five feet of him. Mostly he saw Potter’s name under bylines or citations or speaker bios which, even without his illustrious career as Harry Potter: Dark Lord Destroyer, was several paragraphs long. Draco’s own career could be summarised as “the ravings of one man’s self-serving quest to redeem himself in the study of the prolonged effects of exposure to dark artefacts on the human psyche”. It was research deserving of an “oh that’s nice” at best, and he was fully prepared to avoid Potter’s notice today as he had all those other days and months and years after the war.
Harry takes Draco’s hand and kneads it; kisses it tender. “Relax,” he grins, showing his teeth. “We’ve got time. We’ve got a whole lifetime of it.” And then he pulls off his shirt and runs straight for the waves.
Ginny whines all the way to dinner about how Hermione already knows because Dean has a big mouth and is terrified of losing all his friends to Ginny.
Pansy plucked an ancient tin of biscuits from a dusty corner and ran a finger across the top, blowing the dust off with a disgusted scoff before setting the package aside. She sighed, crossing one hand over the other before settling the weight of her full attention on Draco for the first time since she arrived. "What are you doing here, Draco? It's been months."
Within minutes Harry’s mind is cotton-soft and blissfully blank. It’s the best sleep he’s ever had. He buys two the next day, and swigs one down just outside the door, just before he remembers the smell of blood spilling out of Draco’s chest again.
Eltanin comes back empty-handed. "Can't find it. I might have left it in the kitchen. Come on," he motions toward Harry, "follow me in. I'll fix you a cup of tea while you wait."
“Alright,” Draco agrees because summer never ends in summer. They walk barefoot to his nana’s cottage, where they bring in the linens sun-washed from the heat, and Draco finally cuts into the tart that he baked that morning for luck.
"I fucking did, alright? You can make fun of Harry all you want, but he's just — just. He makes me feel good about myself, alright?"
Draco caught Harry's hand in his. "No, I understand perfectly." He bumped his shoulder against Harry's, and let the warmth settle between their bodies. "Did you like it?"
Draco haunted the seventh-floor corridor of Hogwarts. A Third Year found him up there one night, knocking the frames together as though trying to shake something out of them. She reported it straight to Headmaster Potter, who passed her a Cockroach Cluster and sent her off to bed with a promise to handle it.
"You get used to it," Harry says. His arm winds around Draco's waist. And it is easy, treading water, once you get used to it. You either get used to it or you drown.
(Eyes that see on another’s face. Heart that beats outside my body but is no less mine than my own. The ends of our lives folded up so that our past and our future touch.)
Harry caught a rare flash of sympathy wrinkle across Draco’s brow before it flattened into indifference.
“The waves are no good by now,” the surf shop guy insists, so they walk back onto the beach emptyhanded.
“You know.” Harry stretches an arm over the back of the booth. The morning light blinds at eye level through the slats, fat bars of alternating light and dark slicing up the hook of Draco’s nose, a harsh brow.
Nobody bats an eye when Harry arrives two hours late to his photoshoot with BroomBod on Thursday. They drape him over their latest stationary broom and have him scowl at the video cameras while a woman announces
“This is cheating,” Draco says, though he keeps his fingers pressed against Harry’s breastplate. “I don’t understand how you can sit with all this armour on.”
The road is two-way, and they’re headed south, so Draco’s window on the passenger side looks out to where the sea reaches sky. It’s almost four, and the sun hangs low like a ripe pomelo. They’ve got the wireless on a frequency that blips between mariachi and opera and sometimes fizzles out to static, white as seafoam.
. He’s 99% ridiculous and 9% rude. His mouth goes faster than his brain, and despite all that he’s given into being good, that will never change.
"Yeah, but I don't anymore," Harry says. "He's fucked up, but less so than me these days. And, I dunno. He's not trying to kill anyone anymore. I accept what he did as long as it stays in the past."
"Magic's not supposed to work with Muggle stuff," Draco said once in a past life. He'd gone out that night and ended up staggering home in Harry Potter's arms when Harry said, "No way we're walking home," and stuck out his thumb. Then the Knight Bus came barreling through.
"The problem with you," Ron declares, "is that you beg for trouble. You're balls-deep in Galleons, but no, it's divey clubs for you every night when we could be doing body shots off a dozen models over at your place right now."
The train jerks to a halt. Pansy follows the people out and up the stairs of the underground. The sun is settling on the horizon, purplish as a bruised orange.
I’m shivering. A silvery strand extends from Draco’s wand, and the loss of it splits my chest into two.
Harry pulls Malfoy in by the front of his cotton tee. "Come inside, then, and convince me to listen."
Love like a kick to the head meant for someone you love. Like breaking me out of Azkaban on dragonback; singed robes, Diffindos oozing down your arm. Again and again. Like a kick to the head. Give you all my bruises and watch them bloom across your face. Like love.
Harry made a ham and cheese sandwich after and split it with Draco. Draco pulled off the crust before taking a bite, which of course Harry made fun of.
"Then why did you testify for Draco after the war? Why did you vouch for Goyle's stupidity? For Pansy? Why do you bother with Hermione's rallies, for that matter?"
Ron parts his mouth in a silent scream. Then he grabs Crookshanks and runs. Hermione is so stunned that she just stares and stares and stares until Draco finds her and invites her over.
“And the worst part is. You know what the worst part is, Potter?” Draco says. His fingertips press white against the empty glass.
"I don't know," Harry says, his confusion rising. "I just wanted it. Is that not how Transfiguration—"
. "The only perk of broom drills," she says at Luna's bar. Luna's double-booked it for the night again, Puddlemere in one corner and the Tornados in the other, despite how many times they bring it up with Luna to
"It's not my problem. It really isn't," Draco says quickly. "You aren't my responsibility because you saved my life. Life debts don't work that way. Otherwise, we'd all be a million times indebted to each other without any of us knowing it. I think it's what the Muggles call the Butterfly Effect. I watched a moving picture about it."
They say good-bye to their boys on separate ends of the staircase and then descend the stairs simultaneously, though not together. Harry fumbles over what to say. He thinks maybe he’ll blame Scorpius. Say something like, “Albus would never, he’s an absolute angel,” which is a total lie, but would rile Draco right up. And then it’ll be like old times again. An old-fashioned fistfight through the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. Harry doesn’t think it’s a terrible idea; it’s not like they can ever be friends. Sooner or later, the past will catch up to them, and they’ll be back at each other’s throats. Harry’s only speeding things up a bit.
"I want this," Harry had said, the future shockingly clear in his imagination. Harry wants to open his eyes to a perfect day for flying every morning with Draco. Strangely beautiful Draco, with his alien blond brows and his sharp, upturned nose, asleep against Harry with a hand curled around his arm. The roof is painted, and it is only a matter of time now.
What else do I love about Draco Malfoy? I can say his eyes or his laugh, or I can tell you about the time he came over and dusted my flat. It was two or three years back, when I wasn’t as good about saying no to things, and I’d nearly died stretching myself thin over Auror training and Teddy’s second birthday and Ginny’s wedding and Hermione’s dissertation and and and.
It doesn’t come as a surprise to Draco when he graduates Auror Academy. He scores well enough on the written exams that the practicals can’t flunk him out entirely. Still, he’s left speechless when Potter approaches him after their graduation ceremony and shakes his hand, saying, “Sorry about Officer Boyle; he was mean. See you around.”
"Good," Ginny says, her hands clasped around a cup of tea, "because I'm going to need you to tell her that I have a girlfriend."
Harry takes out his wallet. One of Malfoy's friends brings out a little tin of salt from her purse and makes a show of licking it off of Malfoy's neck.
Pity I do not grasp the strength of my human hands heavy with bone and blood. Shame I do not know the price of hunger devouring away a soul. Helpless, I fold myself into the pit and pray that I’m enough.
“I like your place,” Harry says, though the narrow walls squeeze him tight, distorting the kitchen funhouse mirror style. He knows he should be agonising over something about the Dursleys, but all he can think about is how funny that even a kettle swallows up space in a small room.
"Well. That didn't go as well as I'd hoped," Eltanin says. "We might've smoked too much. But at least he looked pissed, right? He was definitely jealous."
Harry's eyes were so very green. Draco wanted to close them, kiss the lids. Tuck into that warm crook of a shoulder. He was completely, utterly fucked.
“Your point?” Draco says, his brows knitted with the effort of ensuring that all two-hundred-and-fifty-four guests are accounted for.
Draco glances at something just behind Hermione. Hermione turns and sees a wall clock. She flushes. "Sorry, you're expecting —"
"One. For all of Nylon, a club that crams in over three-hundred people at max capacity," she deadpans. But she's all smiles for the server.
"Sobering potion," Malfoy says. The black has swallowed up his eyes. His breath comes out heavy and laboured, but there's steel in his voice and it has Harry opening his potions cabinet.
"I'm not sure." Harry curls his lip under his teeth and comes up blank. He shakes his head. "I just don't want to." He's never been good at explaining himself. Intuition is like magic itself: it simply works for Harry.
Draco dreams of a flood that swallows up the streets, of homes drowned to the tips, cresting the waves like shark fins, the waters murky and dangerous with the debris of things once owned but now untethered by ruin. “How do you drain a flood?” Draco murmurs into his pillow half-drenched in drool. “Bad dream,” Harry echoes from the distance of his own nightmare.
Draco crosses his legs over the bedcover, his mouth twisted in concentration. "What would you rather say, if you could say anything?"
“No, no,” Draco says slowly. He looks up, realisation rippling over his face. Harry feels hot; fragile.
"Oh," Eltanin remarks, gazing at the marker curiously. He takes it and draws a thick line over another scrap of parchment, the ink flowing out dark and vibrant. "Huh," he says again, crossing his arms.
"I don't care about your scars or mine. That's just—just old shite. Past life shite. The only thing that matters is what we want to do now. So, tell me, what do you
"Dean says you can come back as Chaser if you want," Ron says. "Probationary, of course. You understand."
before popping back to attempt about seventy different ways to break in. Harry walked in on Draco transfiguring a hedge into a ladder.
Some bloke comes around with a camera, so they pose for a photo. He stops Harry when he tries to smile because he says it'll look less authentic that way. So Harry scowls while Ron beams beside him, and Dean gets the photo op he wants for his adverts.
"Merlin, Draco. Just find him the bloody book," Pansy snapped from behind her paper. "I can't read the bloody gossip columns with you prattering on."
Harry misses his ten-am interview. He misses his three-pm photoshoot. His mobile rings, and rings, and rings, until it too, dies.
Draco, and Draco couldn't have that. He jerked Harry's hand to his face and spit in the palm. He spit again, then led the hand back to his dick. "Get me hard, and maybe I'll fuck you," he said.
The lake is an expanse of white and Draco a swirl of wind above. Harry leans out from a window in the owlery, his whole body strumming loud with every swell of Draco’s broom. He longs to be swept up; to take off. He wants to grow wings and fly.
Potter retracts his hand. He scratches his beard, and I follow the movement up to his smirk. “I dunno, you look pretty open to me. The door let me in and everything.”
Potter hands in the report at Draco’s desk the next day. His shirt is neatly buttoned-up, robes sloppy over his shoulders, the broad expanse of his chest held proud as though it weren’t riddled with bullets not more than twelve hours before.
Draco laughed again, light as a wind that rattled no leaves. “That’s nothing. Anyone could do that.”
for @drarrymicrofic prompt: My Juliana (and also pretttty heavily inspired by audrey nuna’s cover of that xx)
“Yeah, of course,” Harry says, rushed. They broke up three months ago, but Draco’s words are like Felix Felicis; he has a good feeling about this.
"Yeah." Harry swallows again. The sunlight's making a halo of Draco's hair, loose strands curling into his eyes.
He shutters the blinds and locks the door with a wave of his wand before disappearing through my fireplace. I let the flames burn green for a second longer than I should. Then I follow him through.
"I go up, I bark out stuff people expect me to say. Then I sit back down, like a well-groomed crup."
“And Molly says to come by at three, but only if we stop by Luna’s first and bring back her knitting patterns so she can start on Hugo’s spring jumpers; she says he’s already outgrown his Christmas ones, can you believe—Harry? Did you fall asleep?”
Look at this bloody angelic wanker. This is why Harry needs to get rid of Ron. The bloke has the libido of a golden retriever and a near-biblical belief that nothing can go wrong as long as he's home in time for Sunday roast at his mum's. He’d die of shame if he knew the trouble Harry got into without him.
"Wait," Harry said. He punched Draco lightly on the other shoulder. "Come on, we're getting off track. Quidditch game, remember?"
Draco’s side is cold when Harry wakes in the dark. The moon spills in between the blinds, hard shadows playing with shifts in the sheets the shape of Draco’s body. Harry imagines Draco outside on the deck, pale and luminary, still as the stars he sees, and turns to sleep.
Three bubbles kiss his nose. His head’s woozy, and he’s got a fish’s eyes, thinking—this must be what love feels like, floating up.
"Yeah, you know? Get the bloke jealous, and he'll come begging to be taken back. Classic wingman shite."
The safe house looks like all the other houses in Little Whinging. The sidewalk, the driveway, the front door. The living room facing the street, the kitchen with the yellow-striped wallpaper and the garden view window. The matted brown carpet running up the stairs to three bedrooms and a master bath. And beneath the stairs, a cupboard.
“How do you drain a flood?” Draco reprises the next dawn shallow as the shadow of tides. Harry hands him a coffee though it does no good for the salt in his eyes.
remarkable, even when she's using him. Harry nearly stumbles over his words when he catches Malfoy ushering stragglers to their seats.
The woman slides off her stool and starts elbowing her way over. Harry's about to make his usual excuse for the loo when he spots Draco Fucking Malfoy in the crowd.
"Not anymore. Sensitive. Stupid, definitely, when you were younger. But not bad. Now I see." He presses his hand over Draco's quickening heart. "You're loyal."
"Piss off. I'm doing him a bloody favour lugging your ugly mug in here." She reaches across the table for Harry's drink and downs it in one go before winking at the paps at the table in the corner.
There is a phoenix in my dreams. It sleeps on a perch before my fireplace with its head tucked under a wing; a cold, quiet creature, more stone than flesh. Every night, I dream, paralysed, dreading the moment it bursts into life and burns me down with it.
Okay is a word with four letters, nonrepeating. Okay means both not very good and not very bad, which means neither good nor bad, which means nothing much at all. Harry feels vaguely okay in that he feels how it feels to feel nothing. His mind is washed through and emptied of noise, and everything is exactly how it is because it is.
Harry shrugged. He could smell a cigarette, but he wasn't sure if it was Draco's because he couldn't look away from Draco's face.
Ginny lifts her own box of takeaway chips. "Helped myself," she says. She wrinkles her nose when Harry gets near enough to smell her shampoo.
“Someplace in between love and hate, I think, I’m not sure. Look, do you hate me for crashing your broom? I’ll buy you a new one, look,”
There's a wet patch where Malfoy leaked precum into the sheets. Harry sniffs it. He gets hard imagining Malfoy rubbing himself raw while Harry fucks him into the mattress.
Draco comes back with a black coffee and sits down with it. He slides it across the booth to Harry, who takes a sip, mouth over the rim. A faint sheen coats his upper lip.
Draco flies through the open window of his sixteenth-floor studio flat where he lives alone. His kitchen is in his living room and his living room is in his bedroom, and in the middle of it all is a table with a plate. On the plate is a single peach pit and the ghost of something that still smells of treacle. There's someone singing in the shower.
Harry grinned, his abs tightening as he lowered down with one, firm thrust. The bed squeaked, then everything was quiet. Draco didn't dare breathe. If he did, he was going to come. He was sure of it. Trust Harry Potter to have the slickest, tighest arsehole known to wizardkind. It was—Draco couldn't put it in words. Some arseholes just fit right.
Crumbs lingered at the edge of Harry's grin. Cheeky bastard. Draco breathed in once, slowly. He wasn't sure how to deal with all this newfound effusiveness from Harry Potter, but Pansy wouldn't leave him alone with someone she thought would hurt him, so maybe it was alright if he talked about the book.
The bagger at the Muggle shop we always walked by asked me if I wanted paper or plastic. I said paper, then plastic, then paper again.
The bartender mixes him another and slides it over without another word, his mouth pulled in a frown. The guilt itches at Harry enough that he slips an extra hundred over the counter, as an apology, before going home alone.
Their first time was an accident. "Sex pollen," Draco claims, though everyone knows it was too much Ogden's after Puddlemere beat the Tornados 240-230.
"I'm feeling awfully used right now," Harry says. He hasn't seen Dean since he got married to Ginny a year ago. "Some friend Dean Thomas turned out to be."
"Thanks," Harry says. He hands Draco his coffee. They take a seat inside the shop, by the window. "Thanks for your kindness," he repeats when Draco doesn't look away from the outside.
"Uh-huh," Hermione smirks. "Invite me over sometime, okay? I've got to make sure the whole place isn't silver and green."
Sunshine drips from Draco's face like tangerine juice beading down a glass, Sunny D but without the fake stuff. Liquid sunbeams bottled up in a human body, mouth bright and sweet as the first moment in a morning when Harry remembers why he's alive.
Harry wipes his hands on the dishrag and moves the four paces across the cabin to Draco’s side, his hand resting over bandages around Draco’s waist. The dog gives a sleepy snort and burrows his head deeper in Draco’s lap.
. Couples kiss against white-barked trees while mums wait for their crups to crap at the next one down
Harry barks out a dismissive laugh. He walks into his townhouse and Apparates straight to his bed, where he jerks off slowly, imagining Malfoy swallowing his cock.
Harry buys a cabin nestled deep in the woods, but the distance is of no consequence to him, because he is a wizard, and the Floo is a friend. The Floo soon becomes his best friend when he tumbles through it every few days to the Granger-Weasleys or the Burrow or Draco’s flat in London.
Disappointment weighed heavy on Harry’s shoulders. He hated how desperate he was for Draco to care. To show compassion, and maybe even love, to someone whom he’d hated since first-year. Harry thought, after five years and a dozen apologises, they’d be in a different place, but—
Harry’s vision focused on Draco’s mouth. The crumb still lingering in the corner of it, forgotten. Or was he depending on Harry to remove it?
Draco likes to think that it's better that Harry lied. Nobody could be anyone's entire life. But Harry had gotten close.
Malfoy barely has a foot out the door before Harry collapses back onto his bed in relief. Malfoy hasn't left a stain this time—they got as far as the door frame—but he can't help thinking of Malfoy all the same.
Harry runs a hand through his hair. "I told you, nobody cares about what happened during the war anymore. You've done plenty—"
“Balamara isn’t much of a party island,” Draco says. He keeps glancing at Harry’s face and missing, sliding down to the peach-and-lilac print of his tropical shirt (Snitches weaving between palm trees; a bit of a cacophonic catastrophe).
They're at Ginny's new flat in Chelsea that's windows, windows, windows. "Like living in a fucking greenhouse," Ginny says, "but I love it. What does that say about me? Is Neville still single these days?" But of course he isn't—Neville married two years out of Hogwarts to someone Granny Longbottom set him up with when he still wore nappies.
“Say,” Draco is saying, “do you think, if you had a choice, you would’ve killed Voldemort with a gun?”
"I thought all my mistakes had ruined me for life. But Harry and his friends taught me that people just keep moving forward. I guess what I'm saying is that Harry doesn't hate you anymore. Nobody does. They can change as much as you. But you can deal with that when you're ready."
“Tell me something you remember,“ Draco says, so Harry tries, reaching for a memory that he sometimes forgets is his own.
," Ginny starts, and it's already not good; she gives in far too quickly for someone Harry tells all his secrets to. "But Malfoy volunteered for her campaign."
Harry's throat catches at the sight of the tiny wrinkly creases around Draco lids. He wants to kiss them, map them out under his mouth. When did everything Draco do light a fire in Harry's heart?
