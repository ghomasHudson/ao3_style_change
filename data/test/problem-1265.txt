Sirius Black was my mother’s first cousin which made means him second cousins. Of course I knew everything about Black’s escape from my father who failed to mention that there was never a Sirius Black in Voldemort’s ranks. During the third year, father started telling me stories about
We were eleven and complete opposites.
Harry was chosen (or so I thought, at the time) to compete in the Triwizard Tournament and, Merlin, did it piss me off. I was furious that once again he was getting all of the attention, he was making a sensation out of himself. But that fury was laced with something else, something I didn’t want to acknowledge for the longest time. I was constantly stressed, my stomach twisted in a knot. I was irritable and prone to snapping. I’m quite certain an apology is due to my friends for how I had acted during that time. It was only a year or so later when I realised that the thing weighing down on my chest was worry. For Harry. For the boy who stumbled out of the labyrinth with Cedric Diggory in his arms and Voldemort’s name on his lips.
We were fourteen and something was changing.
I was so terribly scared and alone that I did what even a few months earlier would have been unthinkable. I opened myself before Harry with the kind of honesty that comes only in the worst moments of your life. I talked to him and later to Dumbledore, and McGonagall, and Hermione, Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black. I talked to so many people that my throat was completely dry and my tongue felt like old parchment.
We were thirteen and Harry gained a parental figure while I, drop by drop, lost mine.
And then I was off to the most horrifying journey of my life.
At least he was mine - I’m not sure if I could compete with Voldemort for the place of Harry’s greatest enemy.
Anyways, it wasn’t schoolboys tugging on schoolgirls’ pigtails to show that they liked them. It wasn’t anything playful, it was the desire to make each other miserable, to hurt one another. But the most important thing to notice here is that since our earliest days in Hogwarts, we were so painfully aware of each other. Always conscious about each other’s presence or absence. My mother always said that the line between love and hate can be very thin.
This is the first time
of my life. So, why use it now? I decided to tell this story with as much honesty as possible. And the truth is that my father, regardless of how often Harry had told me otherwise, was always a part of me. Without my father, this story would have happened in an entirely different way.
We fought for freedom, for Muggleborns and Half-bloods, for Hogwarts and our future; I fought for Harry. We fought against regime, against Voldemort and Death Eaters; against persecution and our demise; I fought against my father.
I’m using this name - the fear of saying “Voldemort” our loud had been drilled into me from a young age. But I’m doing it as an homage to my brave, brave Harry.
We were seventeen and every day was a battle.
We were twelve and each other’s nemeses.
Me: a spoiled brat who thought the whole world belonged to him.
You may wonder, why I signed this book using my full name. After all, I was so adamant about cutting ties with my father. I stopped using my middle name, knowing that it will hurt him more than he would have ever showed. It was my way of coping with the past, starting a
We were eighteen.
Him: a love-starved child slave who just learned the whole world (with a few dangerous exceptions) worshipped him. Obviously during our first meeting I didn’t know how his life looked like; I didn’t even know who he was. All I knew that, even if i didn’t want to admit it to my father, I was anxious to go to Hogwarts, what caused babbling. Unfortunately for mine and Harry’s relationship, I babbled about things that I knew: my wealth, my position, my skills. Harry definitely wasn’t impressed and thus the foundation of our five year long rivalry was laid.
Harry snaps out of his silent brooding when he hears uproarious laughter outside the door. He is unable to pick up any words though and before he knows it the closet door is opening then closing gently.
"Did you now?" Draco asks, marvelling at the fact that Potter thinks now is the perfect time to talk about their past.
But the validity of that first statement soon begins to crumble as Potter's previously-unoccupied hand snakes its way around his neck, calloused fingers tangling themselves in the silky hair at his nape.
“Oh– er– sure? I guess?” Harry stutters out having been rather caught off guard by the question.
Draco is about ready to turn his head and tell Harry to hurry it the fuck up. But Harry seems to sense this and merely tightens his grip on Draco's hair to hold his head in place. Draco ignores the implications of how said action has his cock stirring with interest.
Draco takes one look at Harry and rolls his eyes so hard it looks like it hurts. "Merlin, Potter, you look like someone kicked your Crup."
Regardless.
"Well, I don't fantasize about
“Are you now?” Draco says after the words seem to sink in, eyebrows raised. “Well, I mustn’t keep our Glorious Savior waiting then. What is it you propose we do to solve this...predicament?”
Most of the walk is spent in comfortable silence, only broken by small conversations here and there about seemingly insignificant things. They miraculously manage to avoid any touchy subjects despite Harry's aptitude for blurting out the worst possible things at the worst possible times, especially when sloshed. They also don't bring up the guy at the bar, having come to a silent agreement that that particular part of the night is better left behind them.
"If you don't want me to piss on you, I'd suggest moving out of my way Potter," Draco says, immediately resorting to picking a fight because it's safer than thinking about how the air suddenly feels thicker.
“Hey, you’re the one who bit me! That’s not a very nice thing to do to your new boyfriend you know,” He says with a smirk, untangling himself from Harry and standing up. A dopey grin spreads across Harry’s face at being called his boyfriend. “Most people at least wait until after the first date.”
"Say hi to my step-dads, will you?" Blaise adds with a grave shoulder clap.
And without any further reason to doubt or hesitate, Harry tilts his head and dips down that final distance.
“Yes.”
eyes glued to your every move
It takes every single ounce of Harry's dwindling willpower to not just grab Draco, shove him against the nearest solid object, and snog the living daylights out of him.
you can see it now
Draco can think of plenty of things that he wants, not the least of which is for Harry to stay with him the whole night, but figures asking for that would be pushing it. Instead, he just shakes his head, rolling over to get more comfortable. "Never mind."
"Oh – er – okay," Harry stammers, face flushing slightly unbeknownst to Draco. Bringing his hand back up he resume his gentle strokes.
“I’m not-“
The first kiss is like dipping only your toes into a pool, merely testing the waters. His disbelieve that this is really happening has Harry soon pulling away to check Draco’s reaction. He looks dazed as he seems to register what’s just happened. But his gaze quickly turns molten as he determinedly steps forward and reclaims Harry’s lips in a searing kiss.
"Yes, alright, you insufferable dolt," Draco says as if it brings him great pain to do so. As if his heart isn't beating a mile a minute. As if his stomach hasn't done about a million barrel rolls in the span of a few seconds.
apologies forgiveness
"Up yours, Zabini." Draco shoots him a two-finger salute then carefully makes his way towards the hallway that just so happens to have the men's loos on one side, and the dorm rooms Potter likely retreated to on the other.
There's a moment of silence as they stare dumbly at each other. Potter sways slightly in the doorway but doesn't make any moves to keep walking.
He takes his sweet time washing his hands thoroughly, all the while his head screams that
"Yes," Draco can't help answering, his face heating once more as he stubbornly holds their eye contact. "I want them to know who put them there, and I want them to know it was me who marked their precious Saviour. I want them to know you're
Harry softly traces Draco’s cheek bone as pale hands mindlessly twist and bunch up the sides of his jumper. They hardly dare to breathe, each of them equally terrified of breaking the fragile yet electrifying atmosphere.
His mind wanders further, and he catches snatches of sensations: a calloused hand on his cheek, a wicked tongue sliding against his, tingles where hair was pulled, whispered words and uneven breaths skating across his neck, the firm press of Harry's body against his, hot delicious friction.
Captures Draco’s lips in a kiss.
He doesn't think about how long he's fantasized about, longed for,
Harry returns the kiss with what he hopes is just as much enthusiasm, his hand desperately gripping Draco’s shirt from where it’s been trapped between their heaving chests. The proximity is dizzying, each swipe of his tongue is intoxicating, and every spot Draco touches crackles like electricity. It’s all at once too much, and not enough, and Harry just lets himself drown in the sensations.
Draco takes a fortifying breath before pulling away ever so slightly. “Whilst I would love to continue this...elsewhere...” He begins but trails off, face flushing.
"Right then, it won't do to have you fall asleep in the middle of the hallway," Draco says resignedly.
One of Harry's hands drops to Draco's hip, fingers gripping flesh and nails digging in possessively. The other pulls at Draco's hair, tugging his head forward towards Harry's shoulder and causing pleasant tingles to shoot through his scalp despite the slight sting of pain.
"Absolutely,” Draco replies matter-of-factly. “I will not be held accountable if you manage to off yourself by falling over and breaking your neck on the pavement or splinching yourself trying to apparate home.”
falling wildly into two
Draco can't help but commend Potter internally for shifting everyone's focus so seamlessly. Well,
"I could always stop, wouldn't want you looking like Snape now would we." Harry says with another laugh, slowly bringing his hand away.
"The really, Malfoy. You're lucky I really like you too. Because I do. Really like you that is. Like a lot. Like a lot a lot. Like more than a lot? Merlin," Harry rambles, words making less and less sense as he struggles to articulate what he wants to say.
Draco thinks irritably, twisting his hands further into the carpet before they get any brilliant ideas.
“How can you say that? You know what I’ve done, how awfully I’ve treated you,” He says quietly.
." He punctuates the last word with another slow roll of his hips.
"Yes, alright, keep your knickers on," Draco says, waving a dismissive hand and reaching forward to spin the bottle.
Just as he begins to slip into a deep sleep, Draco hazily hears Harry mumble a barely audible "Gods, you're going to ruin me." Harry let's out a laugh that sounds more like a resigned sigh. Draco's heart hammers in his chest and at first he thinks that's it. But then Harry leans over, planting a light kiss on his forehead. He slowly gets up and heads towards his bed, completely missing the small twitch of a smile on Draco's face as he lays down to fall asleep.
"I'd bloody well hope so," Draco says, flicking Harry on the cheek.
Body finally able to move, Draco scrambles away just before the fire ignites the place he had been standing in only seconds before. He turns and runs as fast as his legs will carry him, adrenaline pumping through his veins. Refusing to look behind him, he stumbles aimlessly until he finally sees a door off in the distance. With his destination in sight, he pushes his body harder, faster, further.
"We love you and support your decisions, Harry!" Hermione calls over her shoulder, probably a little louder than necessary.
As if he's not about to lay awake all night hopelessly wishing it was two o'clock already like some
"Well, er, yeah?" is his eloquent response, flush deepening.
"Oh?" Pansy says, caught between surprise and interest.
, let alone
Then it had meant tapestries and couches in the Slytherin common room; comforting but never quite feeling like home.
charismatic lips
For a second Draco is horrified, but when he starts to recall things he said not five minutes ago, he feels quite ridiculous for it.
"Well now we can suffer together, you're welcome." Harry says, patting Draco's head.
the rain is pouring
"Yes, but you're the fucking hero! The stupid, insufferable, righteous,
Harry's hands still as he seems to think something over. "Maybe we should talk about them, I mean probably not tonight but eventually. It might help both of us you know?" Harry says with as much of a shrug as he can muster with Draco wrapped around him.
“A foul loathsome evil little cockroach,” Harry says, laughing at the memory.
“I just can’t help feeling like I’m taking advantage of you somehow,” The boy says quietly.
"Years of practicing patience. Merlin knows I need it associating myself with you."
They lapse back into silence as they continue walking. The next corner they round brings them right in front of the staircase to number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“Shut up you git, no! it’s your bloody birthday today isn’t it!” Harry says accusingly.
“Yeah, you could say that.”
And most definitely does not make him feel warm and fuzzy inside. Because Malfoy's absolutely do not feel warm and fuzzy inside. Especially not because of something as simple as a smile.
hallway, and that those voices are getting closer.
“I’ve changed my mind,” Draco says schooling his features though his eyes show a mix of exasperated fondness.
"I don't understand how you lasted that long without doing exactly that. You looked about ready to skin him alive."
Now, as he sits and reflects on the whole situation, he feels like a fucking tit for reacting so drastically. Though in Harry's defense Draco had seemed about ready to do the same, judging by his tight-lipped smile and death grip on his drink. Still, he's embarrassed enough that he thinks one look at Draco will set his face on fire, though this time not from the excessive amounts of alcohol pumping through his system or the unfortunate part of him that seems to find Draco very
"Good," Draco says, squeezing the hand on his shoulder so briefly Harry isn't entirely sure if it actually happened or if he imagined it. He squeezes it back for good measure then focuses on not falling flat on his arse. Merlin knows his pride is bruised enough as it is, he doesn't need literal bruises too.
"Besides, if you'd just sat down like a normal person, I wouldn't have had to make sure you wouldn't fall on me!"
“And yet you still died.” He says with a hollow laugh.
And maybe he forgets to grab it Friday night like an utter tit.
“Because maybe you’re not the only one who’s been pining after an oblivious idiot,” Harry says with a light laugh, pulling his head back down so that their foreheads touch.
“I had honestly hoped you had forgotten about that.” Neville replies sheepishly.
Their first kiss is messy and uncoordinated, all desperation and want and slick heat. It's pounding heartbeats and dizzying electricity, too much and not nearly enough all at once. They break apart for what can't be more than a few seconds, their ragged breathing the only sound in the otherwise silent hall. But before Draco can start second-guessing himself, Potter is pulling him right back in, though gentler this time.
No, not dust, ashes.
alone day after day
"Hold me," Draco whispers almost desperately. "Please."
hero!" It takes a second for Draco's brain to catch up to the words coming from his mouth. When it does, he wants to bash his head against the wall, silently vowing to never drink alcohol or Veritaserum ever again.
“I’ll admit, I expected you to be a little more surprised that the person you apparently have the most chemistry with is a guy,” The boy says, seemingly amused.
to join in your dance
In, out.
to think about how bright red his own face surely is by now.
"Been nice knowing you, Malfoy," Theo says solemnly.
Taking pity on him, Harry reaches out for his hand and tugs him forward. "Get over here and give me a goodnight kiss, you numpty," Harry says, besotted grin making a brilliant comeback and demolishing any hope Draco had of forming coherent thoughts, let alone comprehensible words. Luckily, that becomes less of an issue as Harry seems content to claim his mouth with his own instead.
Potter looks as if she's asked whether he wants to be Avada Kedavra'd or Crucio'd. "Truth...?" is his hesitant response. He grimaces when Pansy's mouth splits into a wolfish grin.
"I just want to know if I should be concerned for my
nails bitten to quick
"It was supposed to be you walking me home, wanker. And besides, that's not sweet. That's just human decency Potter. Manners? Though I don't suppose you've ever heard of those have you?"
Needing to feel closer, Draco slides his hand down Harry's arse to the back of his thigh, lifting his leg to wrap around his hips. His other hand makes its way up the front of Harry's torso, caressing the toned planes before gently pinching one of his nipples. Harry's head falls back against the wall, his eyes fluttering closed at the mix of sensations.
It's not long before an anguished "Fucking hell mate!" sounds from down the hall. Harry snorts as they once again break apart, although his vice grip on Draco keeps him from moving away.
Draco snaps awake, sweat soaking through his clothes and to the bedcovers. He shoves the covers off then sits up, curling into a tight ball.  He shivers violently at the sudden cold now assaulting his trembling body. A strangled "shit," is all he manages to say before the panic overcomes his mind and his body seizes up completely.
part in a long ragged breath
"Not even a little bit? I'm hurt," Draco says, voice muffled by the covers. "Now shut up, I'd like to get
what to do with it
The next morning Harry wakes up to find the room empty. He worries for a moment until he sees a small note on his bedside table. It's not signed, containing only two words in slanting elegant script.
Because there’s anxiety, and nerves reflected in his gaze. But behind all that is pure want. And Harry begins to wonder just how little resistance he would’ve been met with had he snogged the bugger a half hour ago.
"Yeeaaah, but you will."
"Much as I hate leaving things unfinished..." Draco murmurs, breath catching before he lets it out in a dramatic sigh. "I don't think either of our roommates would much appreciate that," He finishes, mouth quirking into a rueful smirk.
"Oh," is Potter's strangled response. At his side, Weasley looks equally horrified on behalf of his best mate.
Now he thinks about how they had darkened with lust their first night together and how he had woken up to find bright eyes staring right back at him.
"And what were you trying to do, strangle my arm?!"
"Pardon?"
"Yes, alright, Hermione dear, how about a demonstration instead?" Pansy says, reaching forwards and spinning the bottle with a flourish. Draco nearly laughs when it lands on Potter, whose eyes go comically wide as he chokes on his drink. "Truth or dare, Potter?" She asks, innocent tone at odds with the mischievous glint in her eyes.
Thank you.
Now green means comfort.
“Yes, and I picked the wrong side.”
“As am I,” Draco says, expression softening. “You’re, dare I say, not too terrible of company after all.”
"Well, I'm afraid that's something you'll just have to get used to," Draco says matter-of-factly, stepping away and pulling Harry in the direction of his room.
"I think I'm gonna be sick," Harry says, burying his face in his hands with a groan.
And who just had to be the first person picked but none other than Harry Potter himself. Before he knew it he had been blindfolded – glasses hastily shoved in Ron and Hermione’s general direction – and pushed into a closet.
should be interesting," Millicent cackles.
the glare of the sun
"No," Draco mumbles, burying his face further into his shoulder.
“I’m not sure how that’s going to h–“
"Tame," Pansy says with a disappointed pout before standing and striking a pose that's undeniably Celestina-esque. One rousing rendition of Hoggy Warty Hogwarts later, and Pansy is curtsying to enthusiastic if perplexed applause.
“I’m sure I’ll manage with just a goodnight kiss this time,” Harry says with a laugh. The look he receives is one part exasperated and one part endeared.
He determinedly doesn't think about the heat that coils in his stomach at the thought of Potter making
Harry pins him with his gaze, determined and unwavering. “Never, and I mean never say something like that about yourself ever again, Draco.” His eyes widen and another tear makes its way down his cheek. “You deserve happiness and love just like anyone else. Don’t even think for one second that you don’t.”
"Right," Draco says faintly. He hesitates for a moment then tentatively wraps his right arm around Harry's shoulders, ever-so-slightly pulling him closer. Harry nestles his nose into the scarf wrapped delicately around Draco’s neck. The smell that floods his senses is intoxicating, wrapping him up in a blanket of citrus and warmth.
Instead, Harry asks Draco what his favorite Honeyduke's sweet is, which turns out to be Fizzing Whizzbees, and Draco, already knowing Harry's love of treacle tart, (
"Well I've changed my mind." Draco says, lifting his head up to glare rather pitifully then dropping it back down onto Harry's shoulder.
At first green had meant fresh green grass during young summers at the Manor.
"Goodnight, Draco," Harry says softly, giving his hand a squeeze.
Now green means love.
since madam malkin's
Draco rakes a hand through his hair and Harry would almost say he looks nervous. Which is a sight he hasn’t seen in years; not since he came and apologized then thanked him. The difference being that this time he isn’t trying to cover up his unease with a false air of confidence and superiority. Now he simply looks awkward, like he doesn’t quite know what to do with himself.
"What'll it be, love?" Pansy asks, and it's like a death sentence.
Draco shivers as he finds himself in a room he'd really rather never have to see again. He starts walking aimlessly through the piles and piles of things left behind by past students. He doesn't realize where his feet have brought him until he sees it, that damned object that plagued his life for so long. Despite his head screaming that he should turn around and walk away, he approaches the cabinet feeling strangely drawn to it.
When the final few stragglers have entered their dorm rooms, Harry fixes Draco with a roguish grin. "Well, suppose that could've gone a lot worse."
"Honestly, what
“Finally coming out of the closet then, you two?” Blaise says with a smirk just as Pansy says “Merlin, Draco, what did you do, maul his neck?” whilst eyeing the obvious love bites in amusement.
"See, you are sweet when you want to be!" Harry says, poking his shoulder. "You just used wandless magic to trip a guy because he ran into me and called us fairies!"
and cheeks flushed crimson
attempts at small talk
In, out.
And Merlin does he want to. He’s half a second from pulling Draco into his apartment right along with him. But another part of him desperately doesn’t want this to seem like a one-off thing that they go the rest of their lives pretending never happened.
If Harry thought that felt amazing, nothing compared to the next thrust of his hips which Draco meets this time as he continues to kiss and bite along Harry’s other ear. The double stimulation effectively turns Harry’s brain to mush, enough so that he doesn’t realize when he lets a small sigh of “Draco…” escape his lips until he feels him go completely still on top of him.
," Draco teases breathily.
How they had been glued to him the entire walk down the aisle and through heartfelt vows.
Harry can't tell if the churning in his stomach is from the guilt or if he's actually just about to hurl. Perhaps it's a mix of the two. Regardless, Harry feels like absolute shit and is about to make his way to the bathroom just in case, but it's in that moment Draco returns from talking to the Mediwizards about the situation.
The next breath he lets out is surprisingly ragged as all thought leaves his head outside of the sensation of the fingers on his hip. It's such a small gesture but Harry feels like his body is on fire, warmth pooling in his stomach like he’s taken another shot of Firewhiskey.
that he's always had yours too
Harry is caught off guard by the amount of care and tenderness Malfoy has displayed tonight, so at odds with his usual sneering arrogant self. The thought makes his chest ache for this boy; to find out what Draco is like, not Malfoy. Because this side of him, this soft, gentle, loving side, that’s not Malfoy, that’s Draco. The real Draco. Beneath all those masks, behind every sneer and smug smirk, is a boy who is yearning for love and closeness. To love and be loved unconditionally just like anyone else.
he throws his head back
"Do you want to try going back to sleep?" Harry asks quietly, as if he's just as afraid of breaking this fragile spell of peace and quiet as Draco is.
Draco snorts. “We’re coming, Merlin’s sake.”
He rolls onto his back as his left hand continues to stroke his leaking cock, and when he closes his eyes, he can almost pretend it's Harry's. He imagines a scenario where Harry decides to follow him back to his room instead. He can see the predatory glint in Harry's eyes as he pushes him back and crawls on top of him. He can almost hear him whispering filthy things in his ear as his hand quickens its pace.
a week.
They make it to Harry's door first for which Draco is silently grateful, not trusting his ability to resist dragging Harry into his room right along with him. He's more than happy to put up a few privacy charms and let Blaise suffer. But the mere thought of Weasley being in the same room is a mood-killer and a half (no matter how much he might enjoy doing it just to spite the redhead).
The hand at Draco's neck trails up to cradle his jaw, tilting his head just-so to deepen the kiss. Potter lets out a contented sigh, and Draco can feel him smile softly against his lips. Draco uses this opportunity to swipe his tongue along Potter's bottom lip, drawing a quiet gasp from him as he readily opens his mouth to grant him access.
“Alright, alright, I’m walking.” Harry catches up to Draco and they resume their walk. However, with the absence of Draco’s body heat against him, he becomes startlingly aware of how cold the night has grown. He shoves his hands into his front trouser pockets in a futile attempt to find warmth, regretting not wearing a coat as he enviously eyes Draco in his.
like none can touch him
"Well, I dare say you're quite
It’s odd, kissing someone while unable to see. It makes every slight feeling heightened. Every touch like fire. Searing through his veins and warming his body like a shot of Firewhiskey.
"Right, I've got to take a leak, so if you lovely people will excuse me," Draco says to no one in particular, already beginning to regret his decision as he struggles back onto his feet. He knows his friends are sharp enough not to buy it, but he figures it's good enough no one else except perhaps Granger will pick up on the blatant excuse to follow after Potter.
Draco easily uses his grip on Harry’s waist to his advantage, gently pushing him back as he joins him on the steps. Harry gasps as the ice cold metal of the railing digs itself into his back, chilling him through his jumper. But he barely spares the discomfort a second thought as he finds Draco’s mercifully warm body being pressed against his front.
“Shit, you alright?” Malfoy asks, causing Harry to wonder how the hell he hadn’t recognized his voice sooner.
Draco knows he's going to regret it later the moment the Veritaserum-laced Rum and Coke slides down his throat. But there was absolutely no way he would've been able to back out of tonight's game of Truth or Dare with his pride still intact. Especially not after his narrow escape half-way through last week's round of I Have Never. (Leave it to Parkinson and Granger to come up with such a horrid idea as "inter-house unity" parties)
Harry laughs at that, though not in a mocking way, and Draco gives him another pitiful glare that he would almost deem more of a pout. He's not sure if he imagines the blush that's now splashed across Draco's face.
Too worried about scaring him off though, he instead decides to test the waters a little by sliding the hand previously held on Draco's shoulder over to the nape of his neck, tangling his fingers into the short silky hair he finds there. He takes it as a good sign when Draco doesn't shove him away. In fact, the only reaction from him is the slightest tightening of his grip on Harry's hip.
“Four years? Must be pretty special.”
"It's okay, you're okay, no one is going to hurt you." He says. "You're safe."
He doesn't think about how intoxicating Potter smells this up-close. Or how Potter tilts his head almost imperceptibly to give him better access.
“You didn’t tell me you arse!” Harry says, punctuating each word with a punch to his arm.
Hermione, Pansy, and plenty of others open their mouths to say something but are cut off by Weasley. "
┏━━━━━༻❁༺━━━━━┓
He turns it over in his hand and a choked sob escapes his mouth.
“Anything,” Malfoy murmurs back, stroking a hand through his hair then caressing his cheek tenderly.
Without the distraction of the conversation, however, the night's events flood back into the forefront of his mind. Harry's barely concealed noises during the dare, him not being able to keep his hands to himself. It seems laughable that at the beginning of the night, Draco hadn't even known Harry was into
“Something wrong?”
How they watered with tears of joy as he had gotten down on one knee and he had immediately said "Yes!"
His stomach leaps.
Eventually, Harry let's out a sigh and quietly says "Although, standing here all night sort of defeats the purpose too if we never actually make it there."
"Pompous bastard," Harry says, voice strained as Draco presses his knee against him.
"Ever rub one out fantasizing about one of the
"Your support truly warms my cold, dead heart," Draco replies, holding a hand over his chest and wiping away an imaginary tear.
Then they hear a loud knock at the closet door followed by Pansy’s voice saying “Times up lovebirds!” Harry jumps so bad he ends up biting Draco’s lip who tries to look annoyed before snorting and bursting into a fit of giggles.
. And besides, I think you rather like the idea of parading about with these tomorrow," Harry says cheekily, running a finger along the bitemarks then digging into one with his fingernail. "You do, don't you?" The little shit adds, meeting Draco's gaze with an innocent look that has Draco swearing internally.
The response is instantaneous, with most of the circle breaking out into hysterical laughter after bearing witness to over six years of the famous Potter vs Malfoy rivalry.
"I wasn't meant for you," Draco whispered into the night. "Maybe I wasn't meant for anyone."
"What?"
Food appeared on the table before him but Draco wasn’t hungry. If anything he was anxious. His stomach was tied in knots and he thought for sure he was going to be sick right then and there. It would be his first time speaking to Harry since the Battle - he wondered where they stood with each other.
“You bastard,” Harry chuckled softly. He was crying too. “You’re so inconsiderate sometimes.”
Draco needed space. He felt trapped in Hogwarts' dungeons, surrounded by moldy brick walls older than time itself.
“Thank you Mrs. Weasley,” Draco had allowed her to take his hands in hers.
, Harry thought to himself as he descended to the ground.
“Still think love is worth fighting for, Malfoy?” he sneered. A section of the roof in the room to their left caved in, collapsing into a pile of wooden beams and flame.
Damn it all. Couldn't they see who Harry really was? Harry wasn't just a boy, and he wasn't a
"First of all you bloody git!" Draco was looming over him, his hair sticking out in every which way. The bags beneath his eyes were so dark they looked like bruises, and his collar bones poked out from beneath his skin. "I don't hate you! I can't! Even after what you did to me!"
magic, of course - but the Muggle kind. Card tricks, pulling coins out from behind people’s ears, magicians pretending to saw people in half. He loved it.
As soon as McGonagall dismissed everyone from the hall, Draco stood up and watched as Harry began to dutifully lead the Gryffindors toward the stairs. He pushed his way through the crowd and into the corridor where he had to jump to see the top of Harry’s head over the crowd. Harry snuck further away and before he could stop himself, Draco shouted out: “Potter!”
“Harry,” Hermione stood up, tears falling down her cheeks. “He would have been killed. We’ve all come to terms with that. He did shitty things, we all did. But he isn’t the reason it all started. Voldemort is. He was used, too, Harry. We all were. And if it wasn’t him, it would have been someone else. It could just as easily have been Blaise, or Neville.”
It wasn't until he was almost outside of the castle that Draco realized he hadn't thought to grab his coat. He paused, weighing the risk of sneaking back for it. He'd already gotten this far. And, really, what was a little frostbite when you can't feel anything anyway?
Draco kept his eyes on her for as long as he could to avoid looking at Harry. He could hear him moving to take a seat next to his bed, and his muscles began to tense.
"You want me to paint you?" Draco raised an eyebrow. "That's going to take a while... more than one night here. I don't think we'll have enough time..."
Just after the Halloween feast, Draco approached Harry in the hall. The corridors were deserted and he breathed in nice and deep (to compose himself) and tapped Harry on the back of the shoulder.
“I think you’ve got it,” Harry said, handing Draco his coin back. “Test it out on someone.”
"That's actually really incredible," Harry breathed, reaching up to touch the canvas. Draco made a noise through his teeth and Harry stopped just before his finger brushed the wet paint. "I'm sorry, it just... that's amazing. Do I really look like that?"
Draco felt like doing a million back flips while simultaneously drowning himself in the Black Lake. Surely Potter was joking... right? The idea of him willingly doing anything for Draco was impossible. He couldn't even laugh at the idea it was so ludicrous.
But now, he knew the truth. He knew it was the night his parents were killed; the night he became the Boy Who Lived.
"What are you doing back here?" Harry asked, peering into the little stairwell. The spiral staircase lead up and out of sight, the steps disappearing into the dark. He raised an eyebrow at Draco suspiciously.
“Hmph.”
“You have no idea,” Harry sighed. Draco patted him on the shoulder, and the sudden feeling of Draco’s hand on him.
The cauldron in front of Draco began to excitedly boil and he rushed to grab the few ingredients he'd forgotten to add. He stirred the mixture soothingly and sighed in relief when it returned to a soft simmer. The last thing he needed was to draw any unnecessary attention toward himself. He didn't think he could handle Potter looking at him with those eyes for more than a few moments before he too would explode.
“Pick a card,” he said. Draco looked at the cards carefully as if any one of them would simply jump out at him. He ran his fingers over the overlapping edges until he felt he’d picked a good one. “Great! Now, do you have a quill?”
Landing while holding an unconscious, six-foot tall
The inside of the pub was comforting; dark wood paneling, deep maroon wallpaper, dim lighting. He sincerely wished that no one would question his outfit choices as he made his way to the bar. The bartender was a busty brunette, maybe just a smidge older than himself. Her shirt was unbuttoned two buttons too low; he could see the outline of her lace bra peeking up from beneath her shirt.
"I have my journal and a quill?" Draco's statement came out as a question instead of a short snap of a response. He didn't know what else he'd really need to be honest.
"Take your shirt off."
"I see the way that you protect those that you love. You protect your own - it's more out of survival than anything else, but that makes it that much more... passionate. And you seem... passionate. You seem alive. You're quick witted, and an ass, but that's how you charm your way out of everything. It's bullshit, really, but something truly spectacular to watch. You're intelligent, and can read a room and play people to your advantage. You're calculating. And that's why I can't understand why you'd do something so dangerous, so stupid."
“Potter?” Draco called after him. He followed Harry up a flight of stairs to a long stretch of hall that seemed to go on for miles. Harry came to a stop and waited while a big wooden door began to materialize in the stone. He opened it without another word and stepped inside. Draco followed obediently, feeling as if he was a child about to be scolded for doing something bad.
The energy in the room shifted exactly as it had their first night there. Draco had to fight the urge to reach out and touch Harry's skin, and it seemed that Harry had the same idea and a lot less self-control. Harry reached out and touched Draco's cheek softly, tentatively, like he was scared of what could happen. Draco felt as if all of his wildest dreams were being realized and he couldn't help himself. As soon as Harry's palm met his skin he reached forward toward Harry's hip. Slowly he brushed his fingertips against the heated skin, watching as the muscles beneath rippled.
“You didn’t have a choice,” Harry reached out to Draco but let his hand fall.
By the time the Gryffindor team assembled themselves and headed onto the pitch, the Slytherin team had already begun warming up. Draco hovered in the air off toward the left of the pitch, surveying his team.
No. Draco and Harry could never have anything real. Draco was tortured soul with a history that would scare even the great Harry Potter away. He had to stop this. He had to end it.
He nose dived at the ground at full speed, watching the snow fly by at what felt like hundreds of kilometers per hour. He dove until he could see each individual snowflake covering the ground of the pitch - only when he was moments from smashing to pieces did he pull up and shoot back into the sky. He did that two, three, four more times before circling the opposite goal post.
“Molly,” he offered her a small smile in return. It was painful, to smile. Smiling without Harry to smile in return was unreal. Draco didn’t think even in his worst nightmare that he’d ever have to do it again. He’d thought his days of faking his way through the day were over. “But I think I’ll stay at Grimuald Place. Harry would throw a fit if someone didn’t keep it in order.”
"Uh..." Draco awkwardly scratched the back of his neck. He couldn't tell if Harry was being serious or not, and he didn't like it. Not one bit.
"Is that me?"
His heart was pounding in his chest and he could feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. If he was going to throw up, it would definitely be now.
“Did something happen?” Hermione pressed. Harry couldn’t bring himself to answer.
“Go!” he snapped. Blaise’s eyes widened in shock and Pansy grabbed his arm, keeping her eyes cast down at her feet.
Draco leaned against the wall of the castle and closed his eyes. He let out a lonely laugh - the kind you hear come from the lips of drunken men as they sink to the ground in their own piss outside of the pub. He thought about letting himself lose his balance and fall. It would take him maybe forty seconds to make it to the ground, head-first, bones shattering to pieces as they hit the snow.
“Potter!” Draco ran to catch up to him, his eyes narrowed. “What are you playing at?”
“Oi, Potter,” he snapped in his usual drawl.
Draco looked wildly around. Vision was nearly impossible, and his lungs were screaming from the smoke that filled them. He gripped Harry’s shirt tighter than he had just moments before, like his life depended on it. His eyes stung but he could not tell if it was from the smoke or tears.
Harry sat in the Great Hall, staring down at his breakfast. French toast, sunny side up eggs, and pumpkin juice. His chin rested in the palm of his hand, and his glasses were balancing precariously on the tip of his nose.
“No,” he answered. “I am a man. A man who has had the one thing he loved taken from him. And you will pay for stealing it.”
“Come here, kiddo,” he reached out his arms and pressed the child close to his chest. He balanced him easily on his hip.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest, scrunching up his nose as if the very idea of someone not seeing how gorgeous he is displeased him. Maybe he wasn't wrong about Harry; maybe he was a completely self-centered git.
"Some days are better than others," Draco allowed. He knew what Harry meant, or was trying to mean. Some days Draco was on top of the world, and others the world was caving in around him.
“Can I help look for him?” Teddy spoke again when Draco didn’t answer him right away.
Draco shook his head no. Harry never talked about it, and he’d never wanted to pry. Speaking about everything before and during the war was hard; Harry hardly spoke of his parents. That night was never mentioned. Hinted at, sure, but never spoken about until then.
“I don’t see what the deal is,” Harry smiled, setting down the two notes. He took a big sip of orange juice. “Why would double tryouts be a bad thing?”
"I'll hex you into- what?" Draco raised his eyebrows in surprised, his eyes widening. He was sure he looked like a fool sitting there like that, staring at Potter dumbstruck. But he couldn't help it. Harry was lecturing him on how to properly draw his chin.
“Will everyone stop being so ridiculous?” Harry stood up, and looked at everyone in the hall. Professor McGonagall was seated at the headmistress’ seat, calmly eating her pudding and watching. His heart fell. “I didn’t use you guys for anything. I don’t use people. I... I just... how am I supposed to love someone who caused the deaths of so many people? How can I hold him at night when I know that people like Fred and Collin died because of him?”
Harry tried to read the expression on Draco's face, but it was impossible. Draco looked as if he wanted to run away and collapse at the same time, and that was something that Harry hadn't expected. He wanted to wrap Draco up in his arms and hold him together, hold him up like he had just days before. He wanted to catch him.
He didn't know if he did have any good left in him. To be honest, he wasn't quite sure that he'd been born with any. Sure, his skin shone white in the moonlight, and his hair reflected brilliantly in water and in mirrors. But, just because on the outside he appeared light, didn't mean that his insides weren't all black and filled with tar. It didn't mean he wasn't as dirty as the Muggle-born witches and wizards his father had vowed to rid the world of.
Draco woke with the sense that he'd had one of the craziest dreams. His heart beat quickly in his chest, but for once it wasn't out of stress. He wanted to jump back into the dream, to feel what he had been feeling only moments before.
“I don’t hate you,” Draco said again. “I could never. Even after you left me in the Bell Tower, I still loved you. I still fucking love you.”
"What's that supposed to mean, Potter?"
didn't like it. Not one bit. He hated everything about-
“Harry-”
He wasn't sure how long he stood there and stared before the thought crossed his mind that he wanted to sit down next to Draco and put his hand on his cheek. Draco's skin looked velvet smooth, and he wanted to know what it felt like.
... around Harry.
Everywhere Harry looked there was complete and utter chaos. Pieces of ceiling were falling down, spells were flying left and right, people were scrambling back and forth. It was hard to tell who was fighting for who.
Winter had hit Hogwarts with a force Draco Malfoy had never seen. Not only was it absolutely frigid outside, but the snow never seemed to stop. It covered everything, and seemed to even fill up the quidditch pitch like it was a swimming pool in mid-July. He paced around the Slytherin Common Room, the fire almost bowing down before the force of his robes swishing about at his ankles. Draco could see it now - a proud Harry Potter flying about on his broom stick, the entire school chanting as Gryffindor won the first Quidditch match of the year. Each time he remembered it, he remembered something else pratty and stupid that Harry did. He was sure Harry flew about the pitch, doing handstands and backflips off his stupid broom. The girls swooning at his feat, his teammates reveling in the success of their prince.
Draco knew that Harry wanted to shake his hand, but he didn’t care. He rushed forward and, grabbing both sides of Harry’s face, slammed their mouths together. The entire hall erupted in cheers and claps. Professor McGonagall silenced everyone.
If he had the energy, he may have cried. Instead, he let his anguish silently wreck his body. Draco didn't know if it was the cold or self-hate that caused his body to contort the way that it did, but it tried folding itself in half as many times as it could. His stomach ached with the pain of it all, but he couldn't bring himself to stop. He ripped at hair, and chewed at his sleeves to keep from screaming out in pain. The snow began to burn shortly thereafter, his fingers being lapped up by white hot flames.
“Is Harry real gone?” the boy asked, staring up at him with wide eyes. Draco had to fight to swallow past the lump in his throat.
“Sure thing.” Harry wasn’t sure but he thought he saw her wink before moving down the bar to start making his drink.
Harry’s insides twisted at the sound of his name. He wanted to scream; to grab the table and send it flying high into the air. He wanted to cause a scene. He felt so incredibly anxious and angry at the same time that he was sure the only way to make the feeling go away was to get expelled. Or have Draco look at him just once.
The tone in Harry's voice was accusatory, and condescending - like a parent asking their child why they touched a flame.
“You’re so insufferable!” Harry gripped at his hair and groaned. “There are people dying out there and all you can think about is yourself!”
“Love,” Harry whispered, pulling Draco to him. He kissed him deeply, as if his life depended on it.
"Oh fuck off, I didn't yank it-"
When he finally allows himself to take the skin gently between his teeth, one of Potter's hands shoots forward and grasps his bicep. It manages to simultaneously steady him and throw him wildly off balance.
"I always thought conjured water tasted more like rotten eggs but sure that works too." Harry says with a snort. "And anyway, I thought you didn't want me to shut up."
staying up here in the sky
Harry feels like his heart has been wrenched out of his chest when he feels a tear trickle down the hand still holding Draco’s face gently. “Take the blindfold off,” Harry demands. “Now!”
Harry’s face flushes as he realizes he can’t exactly argue with that since it’s completely true. Looking up, he can’t help the image of the two of them on the train that flashes through his head, Draco’s hand held out expectantly. Though this time he’s missing the haughty look and the air of superiority, replaced instead by an exasperated smile. A fondness in his eyes that catches him completely off guard. He briefly wonders whether the same thought is going through Draco’s head. He reaches up and grasps his hand without hesitation this time, pulling himself up to stand next to him.
and it snaps to yours
as he smiles and laughs
A silence falls over them but not an uncomfortable one. Draco let's himself be lulled by the gentle movements of Harry's hands, joined by his slow breaths and steady heartbeat. Draco doesn't think he's ever felt so at ease and he tries to soak up as much of it as he can while it lasts.
darting looks at lips
an invitation a chance
"Yes," He says softly as if he can't believe it himself. "I dare say I do.” He fixes Harry with a hesitant smile that's so fond and open it turns Harry's heart to jelly as warmth pools pleasantly in his stomach. "I'm lucky you like me too I suppose. Or at least tolerate me."
A Draco who chose to spend his birthday with his ex arch-rival, which continues to baffle Harry as he stands there not knowing what to do either.
“You’re just in time actually! Longbottom here was just about to show me what a real lap dance looks like, isn’t that right?” He says with a shit-eating grin. “And with a name like that he must be good.”
Draco stands, ignoring his protesting legs and alcohol ridden body that insists on making his task much more difficult to execute smoothly. He snatches the bottle of rum from an indignant Seamus before unsteadily making his way back to his spot in the circle. Once he's settled on the floor safely, he refills his glass and immediately knocks it back. The rum burns down his throat but does nothing to get rid of the squirmy feeling in his stomach.
"Oh stop it," Hermione says with a snort, smacking him gently on the arm. Draco realizes he doesn't think he's ever seen her drunk before.
"Gods no," Harry replies, pulling him back in and nearly tripping on a crack in the pavement he could've sworn wasn't there before.
But no, it couldn’t be, could it? It can’t be him, he hates me, right? I’m sure plenty of other people have drank Butterbeer tonight. It’s just a coincidence! Harry’s head tries to reason. But it makes complete sense. The hesitance, the familiarity of the citrus smell, the impossibly sharp cheekbones, the voice he knew he recognized but couldn’t quite place, his refusal to reveal his identity.
Slightly emboldened by this seemingly positive reaction, Draco covers the recently bitten skin with his tongue, soothing the irritated skin before tugging at it with his teeth again. The fingers around his bicep tighten, and Potter seems to be holding his breath once more. Draco feels like he should thank him, not sure how he'd handle his breath on him again, let alone any of the noises the prat seems to be struggling not to make.
Draco waves him off, though he can't help muttering "Wouldn't dream of it..." under his breath. When he makes it to his door, he takes one last glance back. Harry appears to have sagged against the door, open expression one of smitten disbelief. When Harry's eyes dart to meet his, Draco feels himself flush as if he's just been caught seeing something he shouldn't have.
"In your dreams, Potter," Draco says because he can't help arguing with him, proximity making him dizzy with need.
"Honestly, with all the petting and cuddling you'd think you were a cat not a ferret." Harry says with a smirk, earning him a slim finger dug between two ribs quite painfully. "Alright! Alright! I won't call you a ferret."
He sighs. “I supposed I could make room for it in my very busy schedule.” He tries his best to keep a straight face, but a smile starts to twitch at the corners of his mouth. “Only if you’re paying that is.”
“Gods, please,” Harry finds himself almost begging, unable to stop the words from tumbling out.
Merlin, he was kissing Malfoy.
he's not very sly
no amount of fantasizing could've ever done the real thing justice.
For the first time in years Draco genuinely feels safe, in the arms of someone who used to be his enemy, and believes him when Harry says there's nothing to worry about and that he's going to be okay.
“Don’t let those cows hear you say that, I’d never hear the end of it,” Draco says, exasperated.
Draco bites his tongue, but it's no use. He takes another step forward, voice barely above a whisper. "You bloody well heard me."
They stand like that for a moment, neither wanting to move away lest they risk breaking the bubble of comfortable silence that has settled around them. Harry takes a moment to simply soak in Draco's presence beside him, finding a strange comfort in the sound of his breathing; a security in the weight of his arm around him. He finds himself growing drowsy, however, as his relaxation gives way to exhaustion.
"I don't
"Would you rather I let you go home by yourself?" Draco asks, raising his eyebrows and pulling away slightly.
"Think I'm gonna go ahead and clock out for the night actually," Potter says to Weasley in a way Draco knows was meant not to draw attention to himself. Unfortunately, tactics like that have never seemed to work on Draco, who finds himself picking out his voice anyway.
Draco's body burns at the thought, imagination quick to summon a mental image of Harry hard, panting, and splayed across his four-poster bed with the curtains tightly drawn. Desperately trying not to make any noise as he strokes himself, 'Draco' falling from his lips like a prayer.
"What was that, Ron?" Harry asks innocently, turning to address Weasley and his entourage.
) asks what Harry's favorite color is, surprised to find out that it's light blue. Draco in turn says his is lavender and, after a little bit of poking and prodding, admits that it's because it reminds him of when he would tend to said flowers in the Manor's garden with his mother as a child. Draco seems to be embarrassed by this so Harry rushes to assure him that it's a completely valid reason.
, I didn't even know what it did but I still-"
"And he can't heal it afterwards!" Pansy jumps in, resulting in a round of giggles from the circle.

doesn't let it stroke his ego, seeing as how if just a hickey is affecting Potter this much, Merlin knows what kind of noises he'd make if they-
Harry glanced sidelong at Narcissa, who was clutching her robes tightly, and Draco, who was staring resolutely at the floor. He shot them what he hoped was a reassuring smile, then turned back to the Minister. “Yes, Kingsley. I’m quite sure.”
Draco stared at her blankly. ‘
“No,” Harry shot back quickly. “I know you’re scared, Malfoy, let me help.”
These times with Draco were Harry’s favorite: When the room was dark and they lay next to each other in bed, and it was so much easier to talk about the things that mattered. Draco’s father, Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Teddy. The year Harry spent looking for Horcruxes. The year Draco spent living with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry would look at Draco’s blurred, soft outline, and his heart would swell with affection.
Harry was breathing hard when he finished, heart pounding, and the sound seemed to echo through the empty bathroom. Draco was clutching the sinks so hard his knuckles were white.
He paused beside them. “I’m going to the forest now,” he said, hoping very much that he didn’t look as terrified as he felt.
“Well?”
“Tell me about yourself.”
He's too close, and he knows he's treading dangerous waters. But the longer he stares into Potter's eyes, alight with desire and silent challenge, the less any of that seems to matter. They're close enough now Draco can feel Potter's warm breath against his lips when he cheekily says "You planning to kiss me properly this time or what?"
He can feel words beginning to form in his mouth and only hopes he's able to escape from this exchange with some of his dignity still intact. "I never blamed you for it, you know. After all the awful things I did that year...I thought I rather deserved it." The Veritaserum might as well have shoved its hand in his chest and ripped his heart out.
what's it gonna take
Harry approaches him like a predator would freshly caught prey, eyes flashing dangerously. "How could you ever think I'd want you? You're just a weak, pathetic, lonely death eater who should be rotting away in Azkaban like your father." Harry leans in close enough to whisper in his ear. "You mean nothing to me." He practically purrs, straightening up and taking a few steps back now pointing his wand back in Draco's direction. "Nothing."
"Good, just breathe."
"Yes," Draco says. "Well, actually no, not really." He adds after some consideration.
“We’ll both be stubborn, insufferable arseholes all the time.”
“You don’t mean that. Y-you can’t! You’re lying!“ Draco says, sounding hurt and trying to pull away.
“I’ve never thought about it that way is all,” Harry says, shrugging. “It’s fucked up really, something as simple as your house isolating you like that. Makes me realize just how much the other houses take for granted.”
"Uhh, right."
Harry is startled, to say the least, and finds himself staring owlishly at him. He knows for a fact this scarf means an awful lot to Draco, if his nearly hexing Harry after he nearly spilled a drink on it a couple hours ago is any indication.
"You can keep running your hand through my hair." Draco says. "That felt...nice."
"Ha-bloody-ha."
"If you want," Potter teases. "Though if you're gonna stick your prick in my arse, the least you can do is start calling me Harry," He adds, dragging him closer until their bodies are almost flush.
gold skin glistening
“Okay,” The boy says, returning the laugh and seeming to relax.
He switches between kissing, licking, and biting, until Harry is sure there’s going to be a mark there. The knowledge makes him feel oddly giddy. He almost makes a joke about him secretly being a vampire. But then Malfoy kisses back up the side of his neck, finding an especially sensitive spot behind his ear, and Harry finds himself breathless and almost painfully aroused.
Malfoy–no Draco, shifts ever so slightly but it’s enough that their clothed cocks graze against each other. He can hear Draco’s breath hitch above him as he lets out a soft moan of his own.
he's watching again
of dancing in this circle
"I'm sure we already established this," Draco ventures, genuinely confused.
He watches horrified as the ash falls through the gaps in his fingers onto the floor leaving nothing but a grotesque skeleton in the palm of his hand. He tries to let go of it, to scream, to get as far away from the cabinet as possible, but his body refuses to move. As he continues to watch the skeleton it begins to crackle and move, sitting up off his hand and stretching its wings. Or at least what's left of them. He watches transfixed as it tilts its head, then with a piercing cry the skeleton bursts into flames, soon engulfing the area around him.
Then it meant the sickening horror of watching the killing curse claim its next victim. The flash of green and those two words ringing in his ears and haunting him day and night.
“Please,” Harry sighs, not entirely sure what he’s asking for.
It's another few seconds before Potter seems to process it as well, retort dying in his throat. His face flushes beautifully, but then his mouth twists into a teasing grin. "
“No it’s- you’re fine. Really I - “ Harry cuts himself off. Words having failed him rather spectacularly, he decides to simply show him. Using some of that Gryffindor courage, Harry takes the boys hand from his shoulder and tugs the boy towards him. “You’re fine, honestly. I just wish you’d tell me who you are.”
The determination as he reaches that extra inch to grasp the snitch, the quiet observation of Draco from across the table he thinks no one notices, the concern he tries to cover up when he realizes Draco hasn't eaten anything that morning; too busy worrying about what awful things the day might bring. How he quickly averts his eyes when Draco stares right back.
But now? Now all he sees are fiery eyes behind thin circular glasses.
He feels cold.
“Yes, yes. Regardless, all of that work would have been for naught!”
"Your support is heartwarming as ever, Weasel," Draco says dryly.
Harry turns back to Seamus. "Yeah, we're dating," He says with a besotted grin that does ruinous things to Draco's stomach.
Draco is more than happy to oblige, thumbs grazing teasingly along hipbones where too-large trousers hang tantalizingly low. Potter's restraint seems to finally dissolve at his touch, tongue returning the exploration with fervour. He leaves Draco reeling as he manages to simultaneously be compliant yet characteristically demanding, neither him nor Draco ever seeming to get the upper hand.
"Whatever."
It's then that Harry realizes he doesn't think he's ever seen or heard Draco laugh this loudly and freely. On the rare occasions he does, they're always light breathy laughs or mocking snorts, but never this. Full-bellied with tears pricking at his eyes as he covers his mouth with an aristocratic hand and clutches his stomach with the other.
When there's no other reasonable excuse left to delay leaving the bathroom, Draco steels himself and walks back out into the hallway. His stomach gives a not-entirely-unpleasant leap when he spots Potter leaning awkwardly against the opposite wall. Potter's head jerks up, he takes a step towards Draco but seems to stop himself from coming any closer.
but you've grown tired
"Your words wound me, truly," Draco sighs dramatically, earning him a sharp bite to his neck in retribution. "Must you maul my neck, Potter?" He asks, slightly scandalized. He can only imagine how dark the marks on his neck will be and silently curses Harry for having darker skin.
“I know. We’ll probably argue over petty things constantly.”
a paint spatter of freckles
He doesn't think about how light-headed Potter makes him feel, instead choosing to blame it on the copious amounts of alcohol wreaking havoc on his system.
he missed by leaving last week's game early.
to share, you know," Draco says petulantly.
how does he remain so blind
When Harry finally draws skin between his teeth, Draco thinks he might cry with relief. Harry alternates between kissing, sucking, and biting, all the while keeping the pace frustratingly slow. Then he breaks away from the kiss for a moment, whispering "Closer..." and who's Draco to deny him such a simple request?
"If only to keep you from ruining my Saturday with your whinging."
"Look, I'm not some charity project for you to use to fulfil your saviour complex. I didn't need your pity then, and I certainly don't need it now," Draco snaps, feeling stung and far too vulnerable as what he refuses to believe are tears begin to prick at the corners of his eyes.
and should not be taken lightly.
Draco hesitates before steeling himself and reaching around to undo the magical knot. He is momentarily taken aback by just how green his eyes are this close and without his glasses. Harry’s eyes finally adjust to the lighting, although still blurry due to his lack of glasses, and he is met by vulnerable yet piercing grey eyes. His throat closes up as he sees another tear cascade down his cheek. Draco angrily goes to brush it away but Harry beats him to it, bringing his other hand up to carefully wipe it off.
a nose dusted red
Harry grabs the doorknob but doesn't twist it just yet. Instead, he turns back to face Draco, who's horrified to find himself feeling terribly wrong-footed all of a sudden.
it makes you wonder
Even after all of these years, it’s hard to not see him as the emotionally detached, lifeless boy he once knew. He doesn’t think he’ll ever forget how small he looked sitting silently before the Wizengamot.
"Oh my god the look on his face was priceless," Harry chokes out between laughs.
Draco can hear snorts from around the circle as the other Eighth Years catch a glimpse. "No one said you had to go and yank my hair out either," he shoots back petulantly.
“Or perhaps I’ll phone Pansy, see what she’s up to–“
Trust the boy to be too noble for his own good. You’d think he was a Gryffindor, though as far as Harry knows, he could be. Harry rolls his eyes, not that he’d be able to see it anyway. He appreciates it, really, but honestly. Apparently saying “Yes.” And initiating the kiss wasn’t being blunt enough.
“So let’s do us both a favor then, shall we?” Draco says, gesturing in the direction they’re walking.
"Let's get this over with quickly, shall we?" Draco cuts in before Potter can say anything more stupid. He takes a moment to consider at least ten different ways he could murder Pansy in her sleep. Then, with as much grace as he can muster, he settles down onto his knees in front of Potter.
Potter's other hand tangles in Draco's hair as he languorously allows Draco to explore his mouth. Meanwhile, Draco's hands move entirely of their own accord, releasing their death grip on Potter's jumper and sneaking under the hem to find warm skin. The muscles in Potter's stomach jump at his cold touch, but Draco can't find it in himself to feel much remorse. Especially not when Potter practically groans "Fuck yes, want your hands all over me."
Draco and Harry continue walking, but once they turn a corner Harry can't contain it anymore and bursts out laughing, hard enough that he has to brace himself on the nearest wall. Due to his arm around Draco, he ends up dragging him right along with him so that they're both now laughing together whilst leaned against the building side-by-side.
Another wave of nausea hits and Harry grits his teeth. "Not making any promises," He says miserably, forcing himself to let go of Draco's hand before he crushes it.
After the initial shock sets in, most of the other eighth year students shrug and continue walking back to their rooms (or stumbling in the case of those who are significantly more inebriated). Draco thinks he catches a "Use protection!" from a passing Seamus and Dean, and an "About time!" from Pansy and Blaise.
He doesn't think about the catch in Potter's breath when his lips finally meet skin. Or how he can feel the hammering of Potter's heart when he finds a pulse point.
Draco gives an experimental roll of his hips, and
"Oh, well, I just realized I never properly apologized to you," Potter says honestly, looking confused for a second before he seems to remember he drank Veritaserum a relatively short while ago. Of all the idiotic things Draco expected him to say, that certainly wasn't one of them. He wonders if Potter, too, has found himself reminded of that nightmarish day in their Sixth Year.
lingering touches
Their eyes never leave each other as they move almost as one to close the distance between their bodies. Harry drops Draco’s hand in lieu of gently wrapping it around the back of his neck. Then, seeking more contact, his other hand soon finds its way to Draco’s cheek, brushing along a high cheekbone then carefully replacing a loose strand of silky hair behind his ear.
Harry moves to leave but is stopped by Draco who says a quiet "Harry?" As soon as it comes out of his mouth he hopes he didn't hear him, not even sure why he said it.
His rising panic at the prospect of showing any signs of enjoying this himself keeps him from risking entertaining those thoughts any further.
but then
Now, Harry wasn't exactly sure what to expect from a night out at a gay bar with Draco Malfoy of all people. But sitting in St. Mungos' waiting room definitely wasn't on the agenda he had in mind. It wasn't his fault some creep had tried to chat up Draco, and Harry, admittedly drunk off his arse and pining hard for the blond git, had hexed the guy into next Tuesday.
And maybe he lets it slip that he thinks it's actually really sweet. Draco shoots him a half-hearted glare before looking away muttering 'sweet' to the ground as if it's a completely foreign word that couldn't possibly apply in this case.
It's with a great deal of effort he drags his wayward thoughts back to the present, focusing instead on the very-much-so-real Harry in front of him. Draco kisses him before he can say anything equally idiotic in return, hands sliding up Harry's sides and splaying across his ribcage on either side.
intoxicating
"I'll admit I might not have gone as far as a Body Bind Stinging Hex Whatever-The-Fuck combination, but I was fully prepared to pour my drink all over that bastard if he tried anything."
your eyes follow its trail
It’s a boy.
He's spilling into his hand an embarrassingly short amount of time later, Harry's name falling shakily from his lips. He casts a quick cleaning spell, then, sated and relaxed, sleep finally claims him.
They stay like that for what feels like hours, Harry letting Draco cry into his shoulder until all that's left are small sniffles and hiccoughs. He's not sure when his arms moved down and around Harry's ribs to clutch at his back, or when one of Harry's hands started running through his hair so gently he can barely feel it. All he knows is that he never wants this to end. This quiet moment of comfort and reassurance and closeness.
unruly black hair
And yet that’s exactly where he found himself that Friday night.
"Guess I'll just have to keep telling you that you are until you get it through your thick skull then," Harry says with a shrug, fighting back a laugh as Draco let's out a resigned sigh.
"I wondered," Draco says, thinking back on many restless nights sat awake watching Harry sleep fitfully; wanting nothing more than to crawl into his bed with him and smooth those pained creases off his face.
"That doesn't change the fact that I still hurt people!" He fires back, fighting to keep his volume low and hating the way his voice wavers.
An image flashes in his head and Draco's heart aches as he recalls a time, long ago, when his mother would hold him whenever he was scared and rock him gently until his tears dissipated and he was able to fall asleep. Sometimes she even sang soft lullabies in French, or in Latin if it was really bad.
He’s going to murder Parkinson when he gets out of this mess.
Draco glances at Harry and, upon seeing him shiver again, frowns. With a ‘tsk’ he unwraps the scarf around his neck and winds it around Harry’s before his sense has time to stop him.
how lonely it gets
"You're no fun," Blaise complains, turning to look back at him. He grins. "I was beginning to wonder if I needed to send out a search party. Get attacked by a vampire on your way in?"
“Maybe you should let me be the judge of that,” Harry says, tugging him forward again. The boy remains silent as he seems to consider it. He stays quiet though, long enough that Harry starts to feel bad for how much of a struggle this seems to be for him. “Hey, if it’s that big of a deal to you, you don’t have to tell me.”
of us still have a game to play." Draco and Potter both whip their heads around, startled by the interruption.
"I know, Hermione!" Harry responds with a laugh.
“Actually wait I-“ Harry starts and Draco’s eyes snap back to his. He fumbles over what to say, cursing himself for acting like a schoolgirl with a crush.
“You did what you had to, to protect the people you love.”
"Just- For the love of Merlin, you two couldn't have picked a less public place to finally shag?" Weasley bemoans incredulously.
he thinks he's about to do, he nearly jumps out of his skin when Potter chooses that exact moment to leave the bathroom.
"Gods, now I'm just imaging running a hand through his hair and it coming away uncomfortably moist." Harry says with a shudder.
Draco stares at their hands, letting the motion and physical contact bring him back to the present. A few minutes pass in near silence as Draco continues to even out his breathing. With another light squeeze Harry says "You're doing really well, just keep breathing. Is there anything you need?"
"I really am sorry, for what it's worth. I regretted it before I even finished casting that god-awful curse. I was so
The boy captures his lips with his own this time, though with a little more confidence. It’s still gentle however, like he wants to savour every moment, and Harry is more than happy to let him.
six years you sought his
A few shots of Firewhiskey later and he had miraculously made it through ‘I Have Never’ and ‘Truth or Dare’ without much incident on his part. The same couldn’t be said for the others however. Particularly Seamus giving Blaise a surprisingly good lap dance, Ron having to perform a strip tease (though thankfully leaving on his pants), and Malfoy having to kiss Goyle after which Malfoy had claimed he “wasn’t drunk enough for this shit” and had left to presumably get another drink for himself. Harry had laughed at that statement, having noticed earlier that he was the only bloke to stick to bottled Butterbeer so it was his own damn fault. But he hadn’t called him out for it. Something told Harry he had some reason for doing it and had probably hoped no one would notice.
you find that icy blue gaze
“Unless you want me to come in there and drag your arses out myself I suggest you hurry it up!” Pansy yells through the closed door, knocking a few more times.
and you're a coward
He doesn't think about how one wrong move could have him toppling over on top of the idiot in front of him. Or how he has to grip the carpet, so his hands don't wander and touch what isn't his.
It might not have been under the most normal circumstances that they finally got together, but when has anything between the two of them ever been normal?
you two and the sky
"Is this really necessary?" Harry asks, feeling more than a little embarrassed as Draco leads them out and to the left—towards Harry's house he notices.
"Not particularly," Draco says, angling his face towards his neck. He can see Harry's Adam's apple bob as he swallows.
your gaze follows him
Barreling towards the door he makes it through just as the fire behind him lunges with a hiss. Slamming the door shut he doubles over, air seeming to refuse to enter his lungs as he attempts to regain his breath.
"You could kindly leave me alone to wallow in my own self pity," Harry grumbles through his hands.
"A gentleman who apparently hexes creeps instead of kindly telling them to fuck off or letting you deal with them yourself," Harry says with a grunt, pulling himself up unsteadily. His stomach lurches and he nearly loses his balance, grasping onto Draco's offered hand for dear life as he rights himself.
In, out.
would not dare dream of
“Yes, I do, but I also know what you didn’t do,” Harry murmurs. “You didn’t want to be a Death Eater, you didn’t kill Dumbledore in the end, you didn’t turn me in to Bellatrix, you even stopped your friends from attacking me in the Room of Requirement.”
but you don't let him
"We've hardly been dating an hour, and already you're spoiling me," Harry says with a laugh. "Though I suppose I should expect nothing less being with a Malfoy."
Desire and warmth coil in Harry’s stomach as Draco’s tongue runs along his bottom lip. Harry is quick to part his lips, answering the unspoken question with a sigh. Draco’s tongue obligingly slips between his lips, tentatively exploring his mouth as one of his hands tangles itself in his unruly hair. Harry barely withholds a groan as he ever-so-gently tugs at the captured locks. He can feel the smallest of smirks pull at Draco’s lips as they continue to move against his.
“Can I...?” Harry feels himself ask hoarsely, one hand absently dropping to Draco’s chest.
"But where's the fun in that?" Draco replies, amused smirk only growing. He seems to register the genuine guilt in the glare Harry shoots him, however, and adds "Don't worry you righteous idiot, he's not fatally wounded or anything. And I may have conveniently left out the fact that it was you that did the hexing. As far as they know, we're his best mates who saved him from a crazed wizard he rejected and hauled his sorry arse over here."
"Oh shove off," Draco says, jokingly pushing him to the side.
Draco barely suppresses a shiver.
Now he thinks of the fluttery feeling he still gets every time he smiles at him. The warm feeling he gets every time the sunlight catches on the twin emeralds in their rings.
two sides of a coin
Draco can feel his cheeks burning, but he turns to look as well, fixing Weasley with a self-satisfied smirk. His affronted expression, however, has Draco struggling to maintain his composure.
Okay, scratch what he said earlier. Harry has never been more thankful for certain meddling Slytherins. Though from the way Hermione and Ron smile knowingly at him after giving him back his glasses, and the way Hermione casts a smirk towards Pansy which is returned, he can’t help wondering if they could have somehow been behind it as well.
By the time Draco snaps himself out of his daze, he's not sure whether the wriggling in his stomach is because of Harry or his own best-friend-shaped impending doom. He steels himself and enters the room, praying (though not optimistically) that Blaise will already be asleep.
because of something he did. And he
Draco cowers even further.
“Oh fuck off,” Draco grumbles, his face burning and with no real bite to it.
“Well, I guess that makes you a bit of a hypocrite then doesn’t it,” Harry says, feeling along the blooming love bites scattered across his neck.
"Do you want me to shut up now?" Harry asks with another laugh that reverberates through Draco's body.
Draco lets out a shaky breath before asking quietly, “How did you find out?” The vulnerability in his voice wrenches at Harry’s heart.
a bead of sweat falls
They leave the closet together, faces flushed.
“Are you sure?” The boy asks, sounding slightly guilty.
He turns around to check for the door he came through only to find it has disappeared, replaced by a room he knows all too well. It's then that he notices Harry standing across from him, looking at him with complete and utter disgust.
"On a date, you dingus." Harry pokes him in the shoulder. "Hogsmeade? Tomorrow? Meet up here, say, eleven?"
, however, you asked if I wanted to pop down to Hogsmeade for a late lunch tomorrow, I just might be inclined to say yes," He adds hastily, and the giddy smile he receives in return effectively turns his legs to jelly.
he always watches
“Malfoy, no, that’s not–“
“And you’ll hate how tidy I am.”
"Just spin the bloody bottle, Malfoy, we'll never get through a full round at this rate," Theo groans dramatically.
like nothing else matters but
?" He repeats slowly, mirth dancing in his eyes.
Harry wants to slap himself.
And maybe he uses it as an excuse to invite Draco inside after he once again walks him home.
"Not a word, Zabini," Draco says irritably, making his way towards his bed and beginning to undress.
“No, I suppose not.” The boy laughs again. “Not when I’ve spent the last four years pining after the one idiot boy I knew I could never have.”
┗━━━━━༻❁༺━━━━━┛
"Yeah, yeah," Harry says, rolling his eyes. "Just admit it. Deep down, you actually have feelings and emotions and one of those happens to be 'being sweet when you want to be'."
They look at each other with a mutual snort of laughter. “Perhaps you should just pretend we’re fighting then, love.” Draco says with a laugh. Pansy makes a retching sound before groaning that she doesn’t want to hear about the kind of kinky shit they get up to.
It's a bird.
“Well, yes, but - “
Waving goodbye to any ounces of sanity he had left, he leans forward and dips his head down, figuring the neck is as good of a place as any to place a "love-bite" on his ex-arch-nemesis. (Now
“I don’t really celebrate it, it’s not a big deal,” Draco says, batting away the assault. “I’m surprised you remembered. Or even knew when it was for that matter.”
a traitorous voice in his head can't help pointing out. But Merlin only knows what horrible dare that cow might come up with. If previous games of Truth or Dare have taught him anything, it's that Pansy's dares are
"Articulate as ever, I see," Draco says dryly, placing his drink carefully on the ground before standing up on embarrassingly wobbly legs. He feels as if he's just been shoved down a flight of stairs, his stomach doing about eighty somersaults in the short time it takes to cross the circle.
“Drinks next Friday? Say...eight? Muggle place of my choosing?” Harry’s stomach does about thirty somersaults over the course of the next second as Draco pretends to ponder his proposal.
a sentence he never expected to pass through his mind)
Harry feels a strange sense of relief, some of the tension in his body slowly beginning to ebb away.
"Goodnight, Harry," Draco replies, causing Harry's smile to widen at the use of his first name. He squeezes his hand back, letting himself stall for the slightest of moments. Then finally he lets go and turns to walk down the hall.
“Yeah, right, of course...“ Harry stutters, inhaling sharply. Draco takes a step back and Harry starts to panic, his head yelling that He’s getting away you numpty!
The words tumble out before Harry can fully process them. “And while I’d like to invite you to not-celebrate my birthday with me next month, I’m afraid I’m a tad impatient and don’t want to wait that long.”
A quiet but genuine "I know..." slips out before Draco can stop it.
“I don’t suppose you’ll tell me who you are?” Harry says into the tense silence.
Harry laughs then pulls him towards himself, winding his arms around his neck and leaning it. “Perhaps I should try kissing it better then?” He says quietly.
“In that case, I believe it’s about time I bid you goodnight.” Draco pulls him in for a final kiss that leaves Harry aching for next Friday, before turning and Disapparating on the spot. Harry manages to catch the self-satisfied smirk regardless.
“It’s not going to be easy, you know.”
He’s not sure what he expected him to taste like but he definitely didn’t expect it to be so warm and sweet, almost like–
“What, that we won’t make it to your house if we keep stopping every two seconds?”
sleep tonight."
How the first time Draco had seen Harry with his glasses off had stolen his breath away because
At first Harry thinks they're both just going to ignore him, but then he notices Draco muttering something, and before he knows it the guy is tripping and falling into a puddle with a satisfying splash. Harry can't help the snort that escapes and he sees that Draco's mouth is twitching as he tries to contain a victorious smile. The guy stumbles up, shoots them another glare that's massively dulled by the embarrassment clear on his face, then ambles away, swearing colourfully under his breath.
Harry finds his senses suddenly filled with the scent of lemons - an infuriatingly familiar smell he can’t quite pinpoint where he knows it from - as the boy seems to inch closer. Harry’s chest clenches when he realizes just how vulnerable he is, blind folded in a closet with someone he’s not sure of who they are. His tension must show more than he thought because the boy lays a tentative hand on his shoulder.
If he picks truth, then she could easily expose his absolutely-not-a-crush on a certain Gryffindork.
"I can't even argue with that because...well..." Harry wiggles the arm on Draco's shoulder and pats the arm around his waist as if to explain. "I'm more of an armful really," He says seriously before snorting much louder than the terrible joke deserved. A person passing by gives him a disapproving look but he pays them no mind.
"You're worthless." He whispers, now holding his wand to the side and beginning to conjure a fiendfyre in the shape of a snake. "I should've left you in that fire," He mutters darkly before thrusting his wand forward, engulfing the room in scorching flames.
They find themselves in another comfortable silence and Draco is suddenly hit by just how exhausted he is. Without the conversation to distract him he feels the last bits of energy drain out of him, a long yawn escaping his mouth.
you think he's going to run
How they had widened the first time they kissed in the pouring rain outside of Honeydukes. And how they had softened with so much adoration and love it had made Draco's chest ache.
┏━━━━━༻❁༺━━━━━┓
How they had dazzled the first time he said "I love you." And he had said it back without any hesitation.
all of you," Pansy says with a tsk, though clearly enjoying herself far too much. The other occupants seem to quickly grasp the danger of a dare from Pansy, based on the extreme response from the other Slytherins.
"Harry! Let him talk!" Hermione cut him off. Draco offered her a small smile before turning to face Harry again. Blaise chuckled softly behind Draco and stopped when Ron shot him a dark look. He cleared his throat, and then Draco continued.
Blaise raised an eyebrow in question at him but didn’t argue. Instead he turned to Pansy and began to talk to her about the upcoming year and all the classes that they had together. Which was, of course, every single one.
What did this mean? What kinds of things did this change? Did this mean Harry shared his feelings? Had this all been a rouse to get close to him? Was he still being played in an extremely long and drawn out prank? Was this the moment Potter had been waiting for? Is this how it ended? Weasley was surely going to appear from some corner of the room and before morning everyone would know.
Draco liked it when Harry didn't look so put-together and like the Chosen One. He preferred the loose, I-like-to-break-the-rules kind of look. Today, Harry looked like the kind of boy who would steal you away in the middle of the night for a secret ride on his Firebolt above the Forbidden Forest.
“What?”
“You know that’s not true, Draco,” Harry whispered. “But you also know I can’t-”
“You’ll be alright, Potter,” Draco told him. “You’re the Chosen One. They’d be real fuckin’ proud of you.”
“I don’t think that’s-”
“How did you do that?” he asked, turning the card over in his hand. “That’s… there’s no way you could have known it was mine. You put it
For a few moments he struggled to get that feeling back, to soak it all up until it became his very essence. That ended quickly, when he realized that he was wrapped up in a hospital blanket.
“I don’t think ‘bad asses’ is the right way to put it,” Blaise chuckled. “But you’re right.”
“Say whatever you want,” Draco took a sip. “But I did what I had to do to stay alive - to keep my family alive. Maybe if you had one you’d understand.”
“Oh, right,” Harry pulled the deck back out of his pocket. “I’d almost forgotten. Is this your card?”
“Can I?” Teddy’s eyes widened in excitement. “We can make blanket forts every night, and wait for Harry to come back!”
“Listen to me!” Draco yelled, moving his hand up to Harry’s shoulder. Harry was suddenly standing in Dumbledore’s office begging for people to just fucking listen to him. “For once forget everything else and just fucking listen to me!”
Time seemed to slow down as Harry turned in Draco’s arms to face him. His hands fell to Harry’s waist out of habit, but his hold was stronger than usual. Draco knew without a shadow of a doubt that this was the end; they were going to die there, in that burning mansion. There would be nothing left of them.
“Do you know what saved me that night, when Voldemort killed my parents?”
"You always look good too," Harry finally broke the silence. "No matter what kind of day you're having."
He raised his his wand and remembered the spell that felt as if it was ripping his skin to pieces. He remembered the feeling of it; such a terrible way to die.
“Potter,” Draco’s voice came from somewhere to his left. “What the bloody hell are you doing?”
He made his way up to Harry's chest, slowly rising out of the chair. Harry kept his hand on Draco's cheek guiding him upwards. They quickly became level with each other, their lips inches apart. They stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity, neither of them blinking.
Harry shook his head and walked toward the wall on the other side of the corridor. It began to melt away and stone turned to wood before Draco's very eyes. Harry pushed on the door and it gave way to his touch. The two stepped inside.
Harry stopped in his tracks as if he'd come to a sudden realization. He turned and looked around as if wondering what he was doing in that part of the castle so late at night, and shirtless. Draco clung to the shadows and waited until Harry had shrugged it off and tugged on the Cloak, disappearing from sight.
“Thanks, mate,” Harry smiled, putting them back on. Draco groaned and rested his head back down on the ground.
"Stay there," he half-joked, setting Draco down and leaning him upright. He ran to get the brooms, and then began the task of half-dragging, half-carrying Draco halfway across the castle.
The ceiling of the Great Hall was once again enchanted, and a thousand stars burned brilliantly against the black sky. Draco was even sure he saw a shooting star dart by. He took a chance and made a wish on it, hoping that Harry still had a few feelings left for him deep down somewhere. He didn’t know what he would do with himself if Harry threw him away.
"Don't act like you don't know!" Draco's fingers were shaking. A hand appeared on Draco’s shoulder - Blaise’s - and he shook it off. "You're probably the reason he did it!"
"That wasn't funny," he glared as Harry began to laugh, his eyes sparkling in the pale light. The corridor was illuminated with cold grey moonlight streaming in through the windows. Harry's skin looked more pale than usual; it suited him well.
Harry smiled to himself before retreating back down the corridor toward the stairs. He knew deep down that he and Draco would never speak about their secretive library meetings ever again, and that as soon as the holidays were over they would go back to the way they were before. But, he had to admit, seeing the look of complete and utter confusion on Snape’s face was somewhat worth it.
"Draco-"
"The picture is incredible," Harry murmured against his lips. "It's like you were meant to paint me... like you were meant for me."
, he screamed into the void.
“But, he told me that dead don’t really go,” he argued, crossing his arms over his chest. “They’re still here, someplace.”
"No, I'll do this wherever I want to!" Every student and teacher in the hall had turned to look at them, their faces blank. Harry started to stand. "Unlike you, who only does shit in towers in the middle of the night where no one can see!"
A frown of what? Disapproval? Hatred? Anger? Intense disgust? Draco couldn’t tell. And he didn’t like it.
Something cold shot up Draco’s spine at the realization. Harry -
"Why not?" Draco finally turned to meet Harry's eyes. "Where'd your fight go, Potter? Where's the nosy little prat that is always looking for a fight with me?"
Harry pursed his lips and spread out the cards. He smiled warmly at Draco, taking both the blond and himself by surprise.
a voice inside of his head sneered.
"It wouldn't have been the worst thing, if you'd let me fall," Draco continued. "It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble."
Harry’s eyes glazed over and his body went limp. Draco’s heart pounded in his chest and he looked from Harry’s blank face to the Death Eater in front of him. Beneath the skull mask was the hint of a smirk; the look of a man who got off on killing innocent lives and destroying anything touched by love.
Harry’s response was cool and calm, like he’d practiced it hundreds of times in front of the mirror. Once again, his face was completely passive. Draco didn’t know what to do or say.
“Draco,” Snape sat up at his desk, raising an eyebrow. “What are you doing out of bed so late at night?”
"One thing I don't do is skip classes," Draco rolled his eyes. People really viewed him as having that little ambition. The nerve.
“I want Draco!” a small voice squeaked from off to his left. He turned to see a four year old Teddy struggling to get out of Ginny’s arms. He chuckled a little, which lead to him sniffling.
“I’m not saying it’s a
"It was kind of funny," Harry smiled. "Do you have everything?"
"Yeah," Harry sighed dramatically and leaned so that he was hanging upside down off the love seat. The red velvet looked lush against his skin and Draco could feel blush spreading up his neck. "I really want to see how you see me. It's... different."
Draco couldn't deny it; his schoolboy crush on Harry had bloomed into something much more real. He found himself thinking of Harry in more than just a I-want-to-fuck-you-shitless type of way. He found himself dreaming about the way Harry's fingertips would feel on his skin and how smooth his lips would be against his own. He wanted to reach out and touch Harry innocently and softly, with simple caresses and gentle pecks on his cheeks. His nose, Draco came to realize, was a little like a button and he wanted to tap it with the tip of his finger. Harry would laugh, he pictured, and he'd bury his face closer to Draco's neck and breathe against his pulse.
"You know, you scared me last night," Harry said abruptly, almost cutting Draco off. Draco had to fight the urge to meet Harry's eyes. He didn't know what kind of emotions he'd see there, and he didn't know what emotions would show in his own.
“What are you waiting for?” Blaise asked, nudging his shoulder. Draco’s chin slipped off its resting place in his palm and he jerked to the side. He narrowed his eyes at Blaise.
“I wanted to show you something,” Draco smiled. “Do you happen to have any spare coins on you?”
Harry had loved magic, even as a little kid. Not
Harry saw something shimmer in the distance off Hogwarts' rooftop. The shiny object began to move, as if it was falling from atop one of the towers. Harry decided to take a closer look, and began to race when he realized that it was a broom that was falling. And it was being quickly followed by its owner.
"N-nothing," Draco shrugged. He tried to act nonchalant, but the way his fingers clutched tighter at the leather binding must have given him away. Harry lunged for the book. "Potter! In the name of-"
"Discant Oderunt," Draco whispered, turning around to face Harry. It was a spell he'd been working on; a spell to spread hatred. The confused furrow on Harry's brow changed to something much more familiar. His chin tilted upwards as he stood a little straighter. Harry's eyes narrowed. Without another word, Harry picked up his things and left the room. Draco slowly followed him out into the corridor, raising his wand at Harry's retreating back. "Obliviate."
“You did,” Harry took a step closer. “Draco, you lied to save me. You were brave, you made your choice. Now let me make mine.”
“You git!” Ron turned and faced Harry, throwing his fork at him. “You used my sister
"So, you missed most of today's classes," Harry said nonchalantly, playing with the sleeve of his robe. "Slughorn wasn't pleased, but then again, I think he thinks you just skipped."
“We will,” Harry told him, wiping tears off his cheek. “When all of this is over; we’ll have our chance.”
thing,” Ron shoved a forkfull of eggs into his mouth. “I’m just not looking forward to you and Draco having a flirt fest all over the pitch.”
Draco didn't know what to say. He didn't think it was real. He had to be dreaming; that was the only logical explanation. He'd fallen off his broom at quidditch practice and was in the Hospital Wing in a coma. That was the only way the entire ordeal made any bit of sense.
“I just needed a bit of spare change,” Malfoy smiled. He then changed his expression to one of mild amusement. “What’s that behind your ear?”
What the ministry hadn’t said was that there were five of them hiding in an old, abandoned mansion, simply waiting for himself and Harry to make an appearance. Harry had defeated their Lord; they were out for revenge.
"My chin," Harry repeated. "It's not that round. Other than that you did a fairly okay job. I didn't know you could draw."
“Perfect Potter snaps back,” Draco shook his head. “And they say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.”
"You haven't done my chin quite right there," Harry tilted the book so that Draco could see it. "It's not quite that round."
“Potter!” he hissed, gripping at his lover’s shoulders. He hadn’t meant to bring out the last name; it was something he saved for special occasions when Harry’s shenanigans went too far. And this was going way too far. “Don’t you do this to me, I swear to-”
Harry actually laughed at that. Draco smiled too and he bumped Harry’s arm with his elbow.
“Get behind me,” Harry ordered, whipping around. A hooded figure appeared in the doorway, framed by smoke and ash. It was becoming difficult to breathe; Draco’s head was beginning to spin.
“Nothing,” he lied. “I’m just waiting for all of this to be over. I’m exhausted.”
“This is why we never worked out,” he laughed darkly. “You’re too much of a prat to-”
"If I was there in front of you, could you do it?" Harry asked. Draco's heart stopped completely.
There was something about the start of Quidditch season that had Hogwarts humming with an energy it hadn’t felt in years. The newly re-built pitch stood in the distance, beckoning returning and rookie players to its goal posts. Harry was in high spirits as he joined Hermione and Ron at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall for breakfast the morning of tryouts.
“Did you see the note McGonagall left for us?” Ron asked. Harry shook his head no, reaching past Hermione for some orange juice and a piece of toast. A piece of paper was handed to him, which he read with the toast hanging out of his mouth.
"I..." Harry narrowed his eyes, his lip thinning into a fine line. "I was thinking that I wasn't going to just let you get hurt."
“I’ll do it tomorrow night,” he said. Harry smiled warmly at him, nodding in agreement. “I might even show my father some of these tricks. I won’t tell him I’m not doing magic, of course. He’ll think I’m amazing.”
“Next round is on me,” Draco added. “Halloween is a shitty holiday anyway.”
Draco watched as Harry took off down the hall, disappearing around the corner. He felt lightheaded, like he'd had one of those infernal toffees the Weasley's had left in the Slytherin common room a few years prior. He thought he might be sick.
Everyone came to a screeching halt. Hundreds of eyes were fixed directly on him and a sea of students parted so that there was no space between Harry and Draco. Draco knew what they thought was going to happen. They thought he was going to avenge his father’s imprisonment; they thought he was going to hurt Harry.
The idea was completely absurd, but at the same time it was exactly what Draco wanted. He just hadn’t realized it until then.
"Do I?"
"It'd be better if you didn't stop moving," Draco snapped back out of habit. He winced and then looked to make sure he hadn't offended Harry in any way. The small smirk on Harry's face told him he hadn't and he breathed a sigh of relief.
. This person is goodness and freedom and strawberry lollipops.
. Snowflakes pelted his glasses like rubber bullets, nicking and tearing at the glass like they wanted to break through and pierce his eyes. He kept feeling that,
"We should meet in the Room of Requirement this weekend," Harry smiled. "Saturday night?"
Fall moved quietly into winter as Draco and Harry's weekly visits continued. Draco couldn't help it; seeing Harry half naked once a week was starting to get to his head. He'd find himself staring at the boy in Potions, thinking about how bloody amazing he looked on the love seat, one leg dangling off, the other propped up and bent at the knee. His left arm also hung off the arm rest while his right lounged on the back of the couch. Every now and again Harry would turn to face Draco and just watch him work away on the canvas.
“Of course you don’t,” Draco laughed again, staring into his drink. The amber liquid sloshed at the sides as he spun it slowly. “You don’t know what it’s like for the rest of us.”
… Didn’t you?”
"I mean..." he trailed off, shrugging his shoulders. "I suppose."
"What do you mean?" Draco looked up at him, watching Harry carefully. He was eye-level with Harry's bare navel and he fought to keep his eyes from following the trail of wispy hair down to the belt holding his pants up. Instead he moved his eyes up higher, taking in every movement Harry's muscles made as they tensed and then relaxed again. His neck was smooth and the skin was untouched. Draco wondered if Harry had ever felt someone's lips on his skin, sending chills down his spine.
“Yes,” he replied. Teddy frowned and then shook his head.
He didn't realize it was Draco Malfoy until Draco landed on his broom. He didn't seem to be breathing, and his skin was a bright red that seemed dangerous.
“Malfoy.”
Harry didn't see Draco again until a few days later, when he stumbled upon him tucked away in a stairwell. Draco was sitting there, idly swirling green sparks from the tip of his wand. The faint light lit up his face in a delicate way, reminding Harry of a meadow in the springtime. He was in a white button up and black pants, the top three buttons of his shirt undone. Harry could see his left collarbone, and the entire length of his neck.
The funeral was held three days later. It was a small service, with only close friends and colleagues in attendance. Hermione didn’t stop crying once; Ron sent more than a few blaming looks in Draco’s direction. George and Ginny were the only two who didn’t seem to completely blame him for Harry’s death. Arthur blamed the Ministry for only sending two fairly knew aurors to handle such a mission, and Molly blamed herself.
Harry wasn’t quite sure how he ended up walking down the street in Muggle London. Everywhere he went there were people bustling about; couples holding hands, drunken men swaying in groups of three or four, the occasional girl alone by herself with her jacket clutched tightly to her chest. A soft rain was misting down from the clouds above the city and he suddenly felt very stupid. He was still in his pajama bottoms and old t-shirt.
"I want you to paint me," Harry said, stepping further into the room. He dropped the invisibility cloak onto the love seat and turned to face Draco, his hands on his hips.
“I’m going to get us home,” he whispered, placing a gentle kiss to Harry’s neck. “I’ll always get us home.”
Draco drummed his fingers on the table top impatiently, waiting for the sorting ceremony to be over. He watched as Harry - now Head Boy - welcome another new Gryffindor to their table. It was charming, the way he reached out to hug them full on instead of simply shaking their hand or patting them on the back. His broad shoulders and biceps enveloped the eleven year olds completely.
“You have no- Malfoy?”
No one else could seem to understand who he was, or what role he was supposed to play. Hermione saw him as a little boy, someone who needed to be raised and taught and looked after. Ron couldn't care less these days, ever since he and Lavender Brown got together. He'd rather shove his tongue down some girl's throat while Harry battled with himself and his will to keep living.
"What was your intention? Seriously, what
Despite his gut instinct, Draco was standing outside the Room of Requirement Saturday night just before ten. He hung back, sticking to the shadows so that no one would see him. He didn't want to be caught out late, nor did he want to be around if Harry sent someone else to see if he'd actually showed up. Part of him thought it was a joke; the biggest joke that had ever been played on someone in the history of Hogwarts. Another part of him, a really small part, hoped that Harry was being honest.
Harry pulled himself out of the kiss, staring up at Draco.
The idea of Apparating back to the Burrow crossed his mind. After all, he hadn’t quite meant to actually leave the kitchen. He’d been fumbling around for something small to snack on, or some tea to steep, when he’d wished he was somewhere - anywhere - else.
"I'm happy I caught you," He said. "And I'll catch you every time."
"You start every single one of our - you know what?" Harry stood up, shaking his head. "I'm done here."
"I look... good..." Harry let out a soft laugh. Draco joined him.
“I missed you too,” Draco breathed out. He felt as if he was choking on air. His eyes burned with held back tears and his lungs wanted to burst from behind his ribs. He could feel himself coming undone in Harry’s embrace. It was too much for him to handle. “I missed you so fucking much.”
He looked absolutely delicious today; more so than usual. His hair was sticking up in all sorts of directions and his lightly tanned skin was flushed. A light blush had begun to creep up his neck and tinge his cheeks without any obvious cause. His shirt hung loose around his collarbones, the top two buttons still undone. The sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, showing off his toned forearms and the tight muscles at his biceps. His shirt was un-tucked and whenever he turned Draco could see the elastic of his boxers peaking up over the top of his low hanging pants.
Harry took off down the street, following a group of girls who huddled close together beneath one umbrella. There were about two girls too many, and he hoped that they didn’t think he was stalking them. He just wanted a place to get dry and warm up a bit before heading back to the Burrow.
“Bloody hell,” he mumbled to himself, staring down at his bare feet. He was going to freeze at that rate.
Something tugged at Harry’s heart when he heard those words. He’d never seen Draco act so much like a human being before. He was used to the short tempered, snippy, pretentious git he saw in the halls or during classes. But Draco in the library was different. It was like they were friends.
"Oh?"
Draco knew that he hadn't fallen from his broom, he was sure of that much. Did Harry find him on top of the tower asleep? Had Harry gotten worried?
“Can’t what? Be with someone who made a mistake? Be with someone who regrets what they did? Be with someone who is sorry?” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “Be with someone who loves you?”
If someone had dropped a pin in the Great Hall, it would have echoed across the entire space. No one seemed to be breathing. All eyes were on Harry and Draco. It was as if the castle itself was holding its breath;
Draco would often sneak up to the library when Harry and a few other Gryffindor first years would sit in the back and “study”. In reality, Harry was performing magic tricks for them. Draco would hang back behind a bookshelf and watch in awe. He wanted to do that; he wanted to amaze people with slight tricks of the hand.
Not to keep living, per se. But the will not to simply disappear. He could do it - he had enough money. He could disappear into the Muggle world and never return. He could forge all of the documents he needed to get somewhere - anywhere - else. Perhaps the United States would be a good change, or Canada. No one would suspect the wonderful Harry Potter of running away to Canada.
“Give him a chance!” Professor Sprout yelled, clapping her hands. A few fellow Hufflepuffs cheered in agreement. Harry felt trapped, but free at the same time. He took a step forward.
"So start with a sketch tonight," Harry replied, "and then work from there. We can come back."
Draco’s words hit Harry square in the chest. He chuckled darkly and took a sip from his own drink. It wasn’t the same thing Hermione got him but it was good enough. It burned just a little on the way down, which was nice. He needed to feel something.
Harry and Draco spent the rest of the year leading up to Christmas break huddled in the library late at night with special notes from Snape that they were working on studying for Potions. Draco learned the magic tricks with ease once he discovered that Harry wasn’t actually using magic, he was just using slight of hand and distracting the audience with constant eye contact.
“You always make an entrance,” Malfoy joked. “It’s probably the only thing you’re good at.”
Green light illuminated the room and Harry’s body jerked in Draco’s arms.
"What about me is worth saving?" Draco asked. Harry took a step closer.
"How in Merlin’s name do you think it’s okay to say something like that?” Draco’s bottom lip was quivering. “Honestly. I don’t understand it. It’s... it’s like you don’t even know me! Or care about me!”
“But you… you self-righteous bastard, you’re the Chosen One. And he’s stronger than you. And you’re going to march right out there and die because you think your death is worth more than the rest of ours. Well it’s not, okay? You dying doesn’t do any of us any amount of good. Especially me.”
“Sectumsempra!”
“I want you to teach me, you know…” he stared at the ground. “Your tricks.”
“Yes,” he gripped Harry’s body closer to his chest. Supporting Harry’s weight with one arm he held up his wand. He wasn’t scared. His father and mother had long since gone into hiding; he had no siblings and few friends. Without Harry -
Blaise looked as if he wanted to press Draco further but decided against it.
"I'll see you there around ten," Harry winked. The bell rang throughout the castle and he sighed. "I'm late for Transfiguration. McGonagall is going to kill me. I'll see you Saturday."
“He’s going to kill me,” Draco’s voice cracked. “I’m dead if I go out there. I can’t do this.”
He kicked off from the ground the moment he made it to the front steps. The air was colder than the snow that fell, and he quickly landed atop one of Hogwarts' many towers. He could still see the scratches left by the dragon from the Tri-Wizard Tournament on some of them, a reminder of the day that he realized Harry was more than just The Boy Who Lived - he was a boy meant to be loved, to be hidden away from the world and protected.
Harry turned on his heel and began to walk down the hall.
Draco let out a soft, dark chuckle.
Draco stole a quick glance in Harry’s direction. His eyes met Harry’s and he froze in his seat. Harry’s face was expressionless and blank - like he was fighting to stay neutral. Even from the other side of the hall Draco could see that Harry’s mouth was dipping into a frown.
"Don't be rude," Harry chided. He smacked Ron's arm gently and tugged him back to their array of ingredients. Draco pulled his eyes away from Harry.
Draco took a deep breath, and tugged up the sleeve of his shirt. The Dark Mark stared up at them both, the pitch black eyes staring into Harry's heart. Draco had done it - he was one of them. He looked so broken, sitting there like that. Instead of feeling disgust, Harry felt like he needed to fix it.
“If you were trying to impress me,” he mumbled. “It didn’t work.”
Sure enough, Harry simply pulled out the card that had Draco’s signature on the top right corner. Draco stared at the card and then at Harry in awe.
"Come here," Draco whispered, scooting his chair sideways to make room for Harry to stand beside him. Harry's eyes widened in surprise but he stood and walked to Draco's side. Having Harry so close to him had Draco feeling more on edge than he had since the day Harry first saw his sketches. He licked his lips and tried to ignore the heat building beneath his skin.
“I’m not hungry,” he told them, pushing his plate away to further show that he really wasn’t interested in eating anything.
It was disgusting, the way that the school held Harry up on a pedestal. Draco practically growled at the thought, having to resist the urge to grab the candy bowl from the coffee table and chuck it into the rolling flames. They didn't see Harry the way that he did - or the way that he wanted to. To the Muggle world, Harry was just another boy. Nameless, wandering aimlessly through streets that didn't take the chance to notice how special he was. To the Wizarding world, he was King - an idol that was worshiped. People practically kneeled before Harry when he acknowledged them, and made way wherever he walked.
Harry had Draco sign the card and then hand it back to him. He put the card back into the deck and shuffled before sticking them in his pocket. He turned and began to walk back down the hall.
"I can assure you, Potter," Draco rolled his eyes for effect. "It wasn't my intention."
“We weren’t just a thing!” Draco’s voice cracked. Hermione covered her mouth with her hands, her brows furrowed in worry. She was starting to tear up as well. “We were together! I loved him! I still do! And I thought he loved me too. Until we got back to school. I’d come back, like he’d wanted. And then he told me he couldn’t handle it anymore. He told me his feelings had changed.”
“Don’t just ‘what’ me, Potter,” Draco hissed. “You and I both know that on the outside of those doors,” he nodded toward the doors at the end of the corridor. “Are a shit load of people who want us both dead. Like, dead. In the ground, six feet under, not breathing dead.”
"Malfoy?" Draco snapped the book shut as he heard that voice. He looked up to see Harry standing a few inches away from him, bag thrown over one shoulder. His nimble fingers were gripping onto the shoulder strap and Draco had to stop himself from thinking of what they would look like wrapped around other things.
"I don't believe that's any of your business," Draco snapped. "Now, if you'll excuse me-"
He could remember falling - slow, peaceful falling. The kind of falling that you feel the first time you see your first love. Slow, and deliberate - purposeful. Falling into rose bushes that smell like clementines, the air around you warm and almost suffocating. That feeling of choking, but not dying - just trying to catch your breath, ridding your throat of all the bad words it'll shove out of your mouth because
Naturally, during his first year at Hogwarts he had a little fun with the wizards who knew nothing of Muggle “magic”. A few Muggleborns and half-blood wizards knew what he was doing, but many were enchanted by his hand tricks. Among them was Draco Malfoy.
But, he didn't. His body stayed rooted firmly in place, squeezed into a space barely big enough for all of his regret.
The man’s body jerked as blood began to seep into his clothes. He gripped at his chest and fell to the ground, writhing in pain. Just as he tried to sit up another section of the roof collapsed right on top of him. His screams filled the entirety of the mansion.
Headmistress McGonagall
"Draco. Don't. Not here-"
"Can I kiss you?"
“Draco-” Harry stopped, his hardened gaze softening.
"Draco Malfoy," Harry dropped his hand to the table. "He hates me."
Harry kept flipping through the pages and Draco could feel his world spiraling out of control. He didn't know what to do or what to say. He'd spent many sleepless nights staring at the damned thing, wondering if it was safe to even bring it to school at all. There were too many nosy twits in the Slytherin house; too many opportunities for kids like the Weasley twins to snatch it up when he wasn't looking.
was more difficult than Harry thought it would be. Draco's body nearly collapsed into the snow, and Harry had to settle for simply letting his broom drop to the ground in his effort to keep Draco at least somewhat vertical. If he had known when he'd snuck out of his Common Room to go for a midnight flight that he'd be tasked with trucking a possibly dead Draco Malfoy and two broomsticks to the infirmary, he...
He finds a sort of solace in the fact that Potter looks about as miserable sitting in the circle of Eighth Years as he feels. But he quickly tears his gaze away before his traitorous brain can start whinging about how unfairly attractive Potter looks in his worn olive green jumper.
"Play nice, and perhaps I'll share my homebrewed hangover potion," Draco teases. "Doesn't even taste like troll bogeys like that store-bought rot."
"Sure, Draco," Harry says around a smile, closing his eyes once more.
Draco looks surprised by the gesture but eventually extends his own hand to grasp Harry’s. “Very well, you drive a hard bargain Mr. Potter,” He says with a nod, though a smile soon breaks through the mock-seriousness. He laughs as if in disbelief, amusement and budding joy crinkling his eyes.
"Shut up." Draco's face flushes as he thinks about the fact that no, he really doesn't hate him. Quite the contrary actually. Not that he'd ever admit it to anyone out loud of course.
"I hurt people too, we all did," Potter says stubbornly, grip tightening around Draco's arm.
slytherin coward
A Draco who was impulsive enough to ask Harry out for drinks, not knowing whether he’d agree or laugh in his face.
"Blaise," Draco warns.
"Arse."
“Butterbeer.” Is his simple reply. “Also no one else has hair that silky and cheekbones that sharp.” He adds with an awkward laugh.
In, out.
"Two o'clock, don't forget!" Harry stage whispers.
So much heat.
Draco becomes vaguely aware of a voice that seems to be coming from somewhere in front of him, but can't get his body to move to look. The voice says something again and Draco focuses all of his attention onto that sound, letting it ground him. The ringing begins to dissipate as the voice repeats soothing words, easing him out of his panicked state. Draco manages to lift his head and forces his eyes to open. Instinctively, his body recoils as he takes in the worried green eyes and the lit wand pointed at him.
"Merlin, you didn't have to make me think about it too!" Draco says sounding scandalized.
"Blimey," Weasley says, leaning forward to get a good look at the very obvious hickey. Seeming to remember where he is, Potter snatches his hands back and fights to calm his breathing.
Draco wants to tell him to piss off. He wants to insist that he's straight actually, thank you very much, and that Potter shouldn't go getting any ideas on the contrary. But he can still feel the Veritaserum at work, and the longer he stares, the more he just wants to take the prat by the jumper and snog him against the bloody wall.
"I don't exactly fancy waking up to you sucking my blood, you know?" Blaise continues, not deterred in the slightest.
“Okay.”
“How could I not? You guys always made a huge spectacle of celebrating them at breakfast, or at least when we were younger.” Harry pauses. “I’m surprised Pansy didn’t manage to drag you out somewhere tonight.”
“Oh believe me, she tries every year,” Draco says. “I’m just more stubborn than her on this. Though I’m sure she’ll manage to trick me into doing something soon to make up for it as usual.”
"No you don't."
“Yes,” Draco replies breathily, not even letting him finish the question. His heart pounds erratically against Harry’s palm as he slips it under his coat.
"Impossible." Draco shakes his head, though the smile fighting its way onto his face suggests he's just saying it for the sake of the playful argument.
“Never better,” Harry says, coming out as barely more than a breath, before he’s pulling him down and reconnecting their lips.
"Git."
undivided attention
Draco doesn't know when the first tears start falling which soon turn into quiet sobs that wrack his whole body. Harry simply holds him even tighter, rubbing soothing circles on his back and whispering "It's okay, just let it all out."
"Yes?" Harry asks, sitting back down on the edge of the bed. "Need anything else?"
“Of course, my lips are sealed.” Harry mimes zipping his lips then gives him a thumbs up. Draco laughs again.
“Yeah, no splinching please.” Harry shudders for effect as he starts to walk once more. “Merlin, just thinking about apparating makes me feel like vomiting.”
"I'd actually rather not, I'm quite comfortable where I am thank you very much." He replies matter-of-factly.
"Don't you fucking dare Potter." Draco says, grabbing his hand and placing it back on his head with a pat. "Besides, no amount of your gross hand oil could make my hair look that bad."
"Alright, alright, I’ll let you get your beauty sleep." Blaise's bed creaks as he presumably readjusts into a proper sleeping position and Draco lets out a breath he hadn't realized he was holding.
"Think double Potions wore me out a little more than usual," Potter covers with a half shrug and a self-deprecating grin. Weasley takes the bait, nodding with a sympathetic grimace as Potter stands to leave. "I'll see you at breakfast, yeah?"
Harry can't help the beaming smile that spreads across his face. He stares at it a little longer then tucks the note safely away in his pocket feeling lighter than air.
if he'll join you here one day
"Taking me to
Draco is the first to break the eye contact with a cough. “Right, I should probably...” He trails off, hands waving aimlessly before promptly being shoved into his coat pockets.
"Prat."
"Why? Got a
"You forgot the really," Harry says, waggling a finger like a parent reprimanding their child.
“I thought you’d never ask,” Harry says playfully. “Of course I will.”
