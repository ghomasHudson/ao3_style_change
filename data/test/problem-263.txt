“Mister Potter! You will unhand him-!” Again, Severus froze mid-sentence. He looked over the two boys in front of him. They had come into his classroom in their school uniforms, with their hair brushed and bodies washed. Those were not the same two boys in front of him now. Harry was without his glasses, his hair more mussed than usual. Both had a look about them that screamed ‘I need a bath!’. Their clothing was the bare minimum, and even that was ripped to shreds. The only exception was the cloak wrapped about Draco. It seemed as if Harry were trying to shield the boy from Severus. He pulled him closer, and made sure the cloak was covering every bit that could possibly be exposed save his head and feet.
The fact that Draco could use the wand as if it were his own was quite interesting as well. Sometimes another witch or wizard could use a foreign wand for this or that. He’d only heard tales of one witch or wizard using another’s wand so easily for so much as he did with Harry’s wand. It was a thought that made most magical folk ill. Their wand was their life force. The subject was as taboo as leaving random blood samples lying about. It just wasn’t done.
Draco nodded. “Yes, I thought tutors might be the best option. We can work to our schedule and around It’s needs when It comes.” He looked up at his husband and they held a truly silent conversation with their eyes only. An agreement was made to look into tutors for their NEWTs once the baby had arrived and things began to settle a bit.
“Would it have been that hard to take the potion? I know your magic is amazing and wonderful and just all around astounding. However, you need to rely on someone else for a change. I know this will be hard for you, but please? Do it for me? Allow them to take care of you, so you can take care of me.” He smiled softly and patted the bed beside him. “I think you should lay down and sleep for a bit. You’ve warded the doors, so I bet even Dumbledore himself couldn’t get in. Am I right?”
“And I believe that’s my cue to cut in,” McGonagall said with a faint blush. “Despite the fact of what we have or have not told anyone, Mr. Potter will not allow you out of his sight, Mr. Malfoy. This is unacceptable in a school environment. You both have different classes and different hobbies. Your houses are different. It would not do to allow Mr. Potter to be in the dungeons or you into Gryffindor Tower. Mr. Potter’s physical impairment makes things harder. I realize he is capable of taking care of himself, but we don’t want to scare the other children with wordless and wandless magic. And we don’t want He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named to know either.
Death Eaters were rounded up and sent to cells within the bowels of the Ministry. Each would have a fair trial, unlike Sirius. Memories of the battle were collected from several people as evidence of the guilt of each Death Eater. Harry was somewhat proud that Molly had dispatched Bellatrix during the battle. Apparently, a mama basilisk was no joke. Bellatrix had gone after Ginny and Molly was having none of that. The twins were also ferocious in battle, using their jokes to distract and cause mayhem while altering many of their other products to go on the offensive. Kindhearted Remus proved why he had been qualified as the DADA professor; Minerva showed her dueling skills.
“What is it now, Potter?” Snape drawled from the Head Table in the Great Hall. He was enjoying a morning cup of coffee, something he rarely indulged in so as not to become habit-forming. “I specifically come here to get away from you.”
“That’s enough excitement for one day,” Theresa announced with a slight laugh. “It’s time for a check-up. Come on you two. Will Blaise be joining us today, Harry?”
“Oh no,” Theresa said quickly, “I’m not going anywhere for a few months at least. You’re not ready to be on your own with a baby. Nope, you’re stuck with me for a little while longer.” Theresa smiled and left the room, letting Harry bond with his child.
Gesturing.
“It’s okay now, Harry. We’re in no danger here. Severus was just upset was all. I promise, I’ll be okay,” Draco soothed as Harry sat in his chair once more. “And I’m getting to that too. So he shoved his hand down the back of my robes. I protested and tried to get away from him as quickly as I could. When I finally did, he was standing there with something in his hand. It was a bugbear. He told me to remove my robe and lift my shirt. When I did, he found four more on my back. We think they got on me while in the tree. They’d been leeching my blood, which was why I was slowing down. When he was holding them all in his hand, he incinerated them.” Draco paused, letting that information sink in.
“Yes I did.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
It seemed like so much longer.
“You, maybe, Draco. But Harry was never heterosexual. He just didn’t know it.”
“How did he get to be trusted implicitly?”
Harry waved a hand before Draco face to get his attention.
“Severus! Are you even listening to me?!”
Harry jumped to his feet and gestured wildly. Without even waiting for Draco to translate, he thrust Snape out of the room using magic alone. Then he closed, locked, and warded the door. Snape immediately began yelling through the door, trying to open it, and banging on it once he realized magic wouldn’t work. As soon as Snape was locked out of the room, Harry turned to Draco and placed both hands over his body, palms down. Draco sighed and lay back, allowing Harry to do the scan without interruptions. After a few moments, Harry lowered his hands.
“The contractions are far apart? Well, that’s acceptable then. How far apart?”
Draco sighed, knowing better than to try and lie to Harry. “My father.” He felt Harry tense behind him. “I know, that was my first reaction too. But remember what Sev said? He tried to save me, tried to convince Sev to keep me as far away from the Dark Lord as possible. Doesn’t that mean that he really does love me, just that he never actually showed me?”
“Of course we’ll have all Harry’s favorites, and we’ll invite everyone here,” Molly was saying for the umpteenth time. “What do you think about having a small private celebration here in your rooms, then Harry going to the Great Hall with everyone else while you stay here to rest?” she asked.
There were streamers and balloons everywhere; posters and signs, cakes and cookies, wrapped boxes and stuffed bags. The colours and the tassels and just everything made such an impact on Harry when the lights came on that he gasped and took a step back into Draco, his hands coming up to cover his mouth in shock. “I don't- What is this?” he whispered, eyes constantly moving to take everything in.
“Harry, have you ever had sex with a woman?”
Where can I find a boyfriend like that?
Everyone went silent then. Draco looked up at Harry worriedly. They’d not really wanted to discuss this topic and were careful to leave it out of their interviews with the Luna and Dimitri. It was something they’d discussed with both Snape and Dumbledore, so they luckily had an answer prepared for the masses.
“You’ve got that right,” Dr. Morris said. “Let the record show that Blaise and Harry have never had sexual relations with each other. If asked if they have slept together, however, the answer will be yes as they have shared a bed before. Moving on. Harry, what is McKay’s full name?”
The door was flung open. “Tell her?” Harry asked with wide eyes. “You mean tell her that I was pregnant before I was married and that the baby’s not yours and that I’m not even sleeping with you? You want to tell her all of that? Why not?! Tell her everything why don’t you! And while you’re at it, tell her about my childhood and everything I’ve gone through and why we really want this house and why I can’t stand the thought of being in England again!”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Severus nodded once. “Potter is missing. And so is your son.
“No, you can’t do that. If you put wards up, how will Madam Pomfrey be able to come in and check on me and the baby? I know you can take care of us, but I don’t want you to have all that stress anymore. It was necessary before. Now we have Madam Pomfrey and Severus and Dumbledore to look out for us.”
“Come!” Pomfrey said, clapping her hands. “Let’s feast and toast to the new Mr. Potter-Malfoys!”
Molly continued snapping pictures, then handed the camera off to Narcissa and went home to tell everyone the news.
Blaise merely laughed once the door slammed. “Ah, mood swings as well. It has been an amazing two months so far,” he commented vaguely. “So if we shall continue? You all have great credentials, and I believe you are excellent in your field and will maintain secrecy. However, as much as he needs those, I want someone who will be able to connect with Harry. He can be a handful, and this is his first pregnancy so he will be scared. It will be a hard thing to go through for him and I want to make sure it’s as easy as possible. What do you have to say to that?”
Well-meaning as the redhead’s words were meant to be, they worried Harry. Draco was due in a month, and he already couldn’t leave his husband’s side. What was he supposed to do about Voldemort?!
“Oi, hands off my wife!”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“On a path… Nope, not anymore.” He stopped and started looking around. “The path is gone. It just disappeared.”
“I hate this, just for the record,” Draco griped, but obediently stepped forward and allowed Dr. Morris to slip a few short strands of hair from his right temple. “Can you tell that she took any hair?” he asked.
The whole time, Draco was shuddering and moaning. He kept his eyes closed and enjoyed the sensations.
“Have you ever had children?” The doctor nodded. “Then you understand. No matter what I say to him right now will be wrong, and it will upset him terribly. Simply put, this ham will be a peace offering in which I can give him what he wants before asking him not to talk to me like he did. I am not his servant; I am his husband.” The doctors merely nodded in understanding and agreement. “Would any of you like some ham?” He held out a plate with some on it in offering to the four doctors. All but Dr. Rhodes took some. “Dr. Rhodes?”
Some notes real quick though. 1) Yes, the birth was kinda fast. Get over it. 2) No, I didn’t deliver the afterbirth. I think it’s something we can all do without. Again, get over it. 3) Yes, McKay wailed before he was completely removed from Harry’s body. Say what you want, my niece wailed as soon as her head hit the cold air. 4) No, a DNA test does not include pulling of a baby’s hair or taking of their blood usually. They would usually swab some spit for DNA testing. This is on of those ‘get over it’ moments.
Snape rolled his eyes and finished his tea. Now they just had to get the damn thing in motion before Draco changed his mind about the whole affair.
“Severus, help! Please help! For Merlin’s sake, help! Severus!” the potions’ master suddenly cried out. “Oh, Harry. I’m so sorry. I couldn’t hold on any longer. But help is coming, I swear it. Help! Please help! Hold on, Harry. It will be okay. I promise. Nothing can harm you here. Severus! Help!”
“I agree with you, I like Dr. Rhodes. She has spunk and isn’t afraid to show it.”
“Blaise, do you love Harry?”
“Potter! What is the meaning of this?! Why did you feel the need to shock me out of a sound sleep?! Potter, are you even listening to me?! Potter!”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..

Severus stopped and turned toward him, wanting to get back to Hogwarts. This information was crucial. “What is it Lucius? I have places to be. Some of us have to juggle two lives very carefully lest we be caught.”
did happen. However, Dumbledore is not dead. The events of
“We already know that,” Ron said, looking at the map. “We already checked the whole of Hogwarts. Harry’s not here. They really did-”
“Father, it’s barely eight o’clock. Weasley and Granger come to see Harry nearly every evening at this time. Please, compose yourself. It’s disgusting to see you in such a state.” Draco closed the door and then turned to Harry. Rushing into his arms and burying his face in Harry’s chest, he muttered, “Please, gouge my eyes out now. I saw my half-naked father with my half-naked godfather on the couch I sit on everyday. Ew ew ew ew ew ew!”
“Every year on this day we’d get on a big red train and travel to school. I loved this school. It’s where I fell in love with your real daddy, and met your other daddy. And every year, it never failed, your real daddy would come in and say something mean about me or one of my friends, Ron and Hermione. But in my fifth and six years there, Ron and Hermione grew closer together and forgot about me. It’s okay though. That’s when I found your real daddy and your other daddy. We all became friends. Then I defeated the big, nasty, scary man named Voldemort. Do you remember me telling you about him? I want you to never be afraid to say his name. He’s really gone now and nothing will hurt you or me ever again. I won’t let it.” A few tears leaked from the corners of Harry’s eyes. “I won’t let it,” he whispered again.
Harry eagerly followed, almost stepping on the Potions Master’s heels.
Then Harry started thrusting his hips again. Oh, that wonderful feeling of being full and being filled again and again was absolute heaven! Not that Draco believed in anything so Muggle as ‘heaven’ or ‘hell’. But the saying fit. Sweet Merlin! It was as if there was a direct passageway from Harry’s cock to Draco’s prostate! Not that Draco was complaining, of course. Laying there, on their sides, moving in tandem with one another was one of the most pleasurable sensations Draco had ever experienced. This time around was took a bit longer now that the edge had been removed, and Harry was much gentler. Not that he wasn’t pounding into Draco’s body as hard and fast as this position would allow him.
Hermione perked up, not wanting to have brought the conversation up herself previously with everything else the couple had going on in their lives. Most of the time the couple was missing, she hadn’t even thought of their education in that sense. More than once she’d thought they were missing out on the experiences of their seventh year. It wasn’t until it came time to really begin cramming for the NEWTs that she realized her friend would not graduate.
“Thank you Blaise.” Harry hugged Blaise and then went to get some more ham. After two pieces, he turned to the doctors. “I have made my decision. The other three will have their memories wiped of this experience so nothing will come of it. Do you all agree to these terms?” The four doctors nodded. “I believe that Dr. Rhodes would be best suited for myself, and I thank you all for coming today. Please, follow Blaise to the door so that he may erase your memories. Dr. Rhodes, if you would follow me please.”
“Get out, both of you!” Draco raged. “Get out get out get out!”
“That’s because there’s a baby in there Blaise,” Harry teased.
“I did no such–! I do believe I said I had nothing to say to you. Why are you still here?”
Draco whined. “Please,” he groaned. “Please, Harry. I need you!”
Harry lay Draco down on the bed as instructed, but not quite in the way Poppy had expected. He had actually climbed up on the bed himself and arranged Draco so he was still being cradled in his lap. “Mr. Potter, this is highly unsuitable. Please place Mr. Malfoy on the bed and remove yourself.” Harry shook his head fiercely, strengthening his hold on Draco. “I cannot treat either of you if you are holding him as such.” She moved forward to physically separate the pair, but the piercing glare Harry was sending her made her stop. “Mr. Potter, what has happened these last five months?”
That’s when Snape understood. Draco’s instincts were telling him to protect his child at all costs. After what they’d been through in the Forest, after seeing what had happened to his father and Severus when they defected, knowing what Potter went through on a near-daily basis with the press… His child wasn’t safe. Not in a world where the Dark Lord still lived and tormented them all. He couldn’t blame the young man for wanting to protect his progeny after all of that.
She was quiet for a moment. “You’ve asked Harry, right? Making a decision like this could upset him greatly.”
“My fault?! You’re the one who pushed me into the hippogriffs! That black one nearly took my head off!”
Draco half sobbed, half laughed. “Oh Harry! He was telling me off for what I did, making him sleep like that. He said not to do it again, that he was going to tell my father. Then he said he understood why I did it. Then he said he loves me. I love you too, Harry. Just a few more moments, okay? Go on with Severus to McGonagall and I’ll meet you in the Great Hall. Go on now, before I start crying and never stop.”
“Wha… what? Where am I?”
child. But it’s in
But before a single word could be formed, Harry suddenly slumped backwards into Draco’s arms, unconscious.
“Yes, my Lord. Of course!” She practically ran forward in her haste to prove herself loyal and useful to her master.
Hey! (Hey!) You! (You!) I know that you like me
“Do not threaten my son, Weasley!”
then. The sooner we start the sooner it’s over.” She led them to the mini-doctor’s lab she’d set up just down the hall from Harry and Blaise’s rooms in case of an emergency. “Up on the table Harry, and lay back. I think we’ll try for a stronger heartbeat today.” Harry lay back against the pillows that had been set there and raised his shirt up, holding his breath in wait for the cold gel Theresa would be putting there. Then there was the sharp exhale as said cold gel finally was ‘plopped’ onto his stomach. “I know it’s cold. When someone creates a spell that does this for us, witches and wizards everywhere will cheer and shout for joy.”
“That’s what Dr. Rhodes said,” Harry continued with a smile. “I like her. She’s sassy, but she gets down to business. And to hell what anyone else thinks. She wants to help me because it is her job to help me. Dr. Whittier is almost the same as Mitchsens, just not as pompous. She believes that her care would be the best and that you would like her simply because of her credentials. Everything was about you, though. I was your husband, and her care would greatly be appreciated by you. Dr. Rhodes said that it was I and not you that was pregnant so who cares about you?”
And so went the wedding feast. They talked of each course and praised Draco for his choices on each course. The house elves kept the wine, grape juice for Draco, flowing and the light music playing. Dessert was divine, and afters were taken graciously. Again, Draco had grape juice. Harry never left Draco’s side except for the seating arrangements, and seemed to always have a hand on his new spouse. After an appropriate amount of time spent conversing with the professors, the invisibility cloak made its appearance.
“Thank you Blaise,” Harry said, throwing his arms around his pseudo-husband. “Thank you so much!”
“I think it would be a marvellous idea. I will talk to Minerva and Poppy about it, and floo in tonight after dinner. Is that acceptable, Severus?”
Harry made a motion like he was brushing his hair back then laid his hand over his heart. Finally, he shook his head firmly ‘no’.
“Do you need my assistance in getting dressed?”
“McKay Draconis Zabini. But it’s only Zabini because I was married to Blaise when he, he being McKay, was born.”
Draco panted through the aftershocks and held onto Harry’s arm over his abdomen to ground himself. This was one of his favourite parts of Harry. His husband, and he smiled at that thought, was a big cuddler. He remembered the first time they had done anything to warrant cuddling, and how he’d almost hurt Harry by pulling away instead of drawing closer. It was a cold night, as they all seemed to be now that he thought back. They’d wanked each other that night, coming all over themselves and Harry’s cloak on the ground. Then he’d rolled over to go to sleep.
“By the power vested in me by Merlin, I now pronounce you husband and husband. May your love so endure that its flame remains a guiding light unto you.”
“As I was trying to say,” the elder Malfoy butt in. “Severus has charms on his rooms in case something happens within them while he’s not there. I believe that is Draco talking. Something has happened to Potter that he cannot attend to himself. These are Severus’ wards working through him since he is unconscious.”
“No no, something much more important,” Harry began. “May I ask your name first?”
Harry took hold of Draco’s wrist and held it up slightly, showing his wand clutched in Draco’s fist.
“Me, you… Join together? No. Together. Work together? You want us to work together?” He huffed a snort. “And why would I do that? We seem to be just fine circling around one another with Draco as our center. I have no need to work with you on anything other than being rid of the Dark Lord. And my role in that has been greatly reduced.”
“Are you serious? You’d cut your hair again and again to get us back?” Harry asked. Draco nodded. Quickly, but carefully, Harry handed McKay to Blaise and threw himself at Draco. “Thank-you,” he whispered into his neck. “That means so much to me, that you would give up something so precious for me. Thank-you Draco.”
“Excuse me?”
She grabbed Ron’s hand once more and pulled him behind her as she rushed to Dumbledore’s office. It took a few moments to get past the Gargoyle, but once they did they ran up the stairs and burst into his office. “Professor Dumbledore, sir!” Ron gasped as they hurried into the office. “Professor Dumbledore, sir, we need to speak with you.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“That’s an excellent question, dear boy,” Albus responded, stroking his beard. “I’m glad to see you are both thinking about your futures. There are a few options available to you. You can start the next year with the current seventh years, though I understand your reluctance to do so,” he said, cutting off Draco’s complaint against that option. Eyes sparkling, he continued. “You can ask the Ministry to sit your NEWTs as you are now, but I sincerely advise against this option without having had any seventh year lessons. You can hire tutors then ask the Ministry to sit your NEWTs, the option I suggest what with the baby coming and all. You can simply not take the NEWTs, and try your chances without them. Sorry to say, Harry really needn’t worry much about them due to who he is. You, Draco, will not fare as well despite recent publicity turning public opinion in your favor.”
“It mean’s you were just recently married, so your name has changed.”
long. So there’s my embarrassing name story…
Four hours, three talk shows, and two animal shows later, Draco walked in the front door.
“Thank you Dr. Johansen.” Harry stood and led her back to the kitchens. “Blaise, may I speak with you?” Blaise wiped his hand on a towel, took some more ham off the burner, and excused himself. Harry led him to a room off the kitchens and put up a silencing charm. “I don’t want Dr. Mitchsens in this house. In fact, I want his memory erased of this ever happening. I don’t like him. He’s here because I am… was Harry Potter. He only wants this job for bragging right and I don’t believe he’ll remain quiet about this.”
“Why did I-?! You two have been going at it like Wealseys and
“Severus! Severus, help! Please help!” Draco cried, refusing to leave Harry as helpless as he was at that moment. That, and he was the only thing keeping Harry’s body from falling to a heap on the floor of their bedroom. “Severus! For Merlin’s sake, help me!”
“So what. He-” Snape stopped talking. “Wandless. He did wandless magic.”
“That is Harry’s ham, not mine. I would ask Harry if I were allowed some of his ham,” she answered.
The Quibbler
“Please, tell me you know where he is?!” Hermione begged.
The Prophet
“What are you telling everyone about their disappearances?”
“Well, I must say Mr. Potter that you clean up very well. With the exception of your black hair, I’d have to say you look exactly like your mother on her wedding day. Well, your hair and your robes. Hers was a white gown of course.”
“Uh, Mr. Sna-”
Blaise just laughed. “You and your weird cravings. Come on then, McKay’s hungry it would seem.”
“Good afternoon Blaise. Please, please come in.” She held the door open and Blaise entered, still dragging a stunned Harry Potter behind him.
is Voldemort. Or was rather. Potter has just killed him. And several Death Eaters I do believe. Now would be a good time to go warn Pomfrey that Potter will, once more, be a resident of hers. For quite some time I do believe.” Slowly, Snape gathered Harry in his arms and carried him outside the wards before apparating to Hogsmeade where he used
But Hermione said they’d been talking about the possibility of them pairing up, Harry and Draco, for quite some time now. It wasn’t a new concept to Hermione or the other girls. Was it only Gryffindor who thought that or did the other houses think that too? Slytherin? He couldn’t comprehend that thought, couldn’t wrap his mind around it. Why not say that he was in love with Snape? Or Voldemort? At the time, it seemed just as likely. The idea was ludicrous!
“No mother, we’re not hurt. Harry’s pregnant.”
“Oi! Who's side are you on, mate?!” Ron exclaimed with a big smile on his face.
“Because this is my job. I am a specialist in male pregnancies. This is a case of male pregnancy. Therefore, it is my job to be here if you so wish me to.”
“Right. I want to know why they’ve changed Malfoy’s story for sure.” Hermione bowed her head in thought, trying to come up with an answer that didn’t make her want to burst into tears. “Surely they won’t give up the search. It’s Harry! And Mr. Malfoy would make sure they kept looking for his son. So unless Malfoy really did go home, I doubt anything’s changed for the better. But I just can’t bear to think of anything else!”
he signed.
“Yes, well,” Harry said, a little miffed at being interrupted like that when all he wanted was the man of his dreams back in his life, “we hired Theresa and she did check-ups and things. Months passed, I got bigger and moodier and hungrier, but Blaise stayed with me. His mother found out the true story and was upset, but let us deal with it as we had been. When McKay was born early on December 22, I was so happy. And then I was depressed because Draco wasn’t there to see it. I locked myself in my rooms and only came out once a week for dinner Sunday nights. Otherwise I took meals in my rooms and Theresa checked on me and McKay there. After five months, Blaise had had enough.
He got out to the Apparation point, waited for his cue to go, and then Apparated home. Well, Apparated close to home. Between him and Draco they were so paranoid about everything; they had a ward for insects, temperatures past a certain degree, salesmen, muggles, you name it! Excited, but determined to act like there was nothing special about the day, Harry hurried up to the house. The wards accepted him and his magical signature, allowing him to pass through easily.
Except, as he looked back now, every adventure in that forest was another tilt, another change in his mindset. He thought he’d found his place in this new world, a place where he was happy and content. He was happy, damn it! He had friends, he had enemies, he knew his place in the school and mostly in the world. But one detention threw all those plans to hell and back. And yet... And yet he was so grateful for that experience.
Harry kept laughing, almost falling out of his chair at the song. He recognized them all, but Draco had changed the words to fit their relationship and past histories. The song changed again, this time to a slower pop song.
And mere moments later she retracted it again. She sat stunned, watching Harry as he gently stroked Draco’s face. As she tried to get her thoughts in order, certain facts kept jumping to the forefront of her mind. Harry was using strong wandless magic. Draco was pregnant. Harry was alive, but blind and mute. They had survived in the Forbidden Forest for more than five months. Again, Harry picked up Draco’s hand and just held it while the blonde seemingly continued to sleep. When she finally had the events in order of the way she thought they went, she stood and went out into the main room before going into Harry and Draco’s private room.
One by one, he floated presents to Harry’s hands to open. At the receiving of each, the gifter would shout out that it was their gift. After opening it, Harry would sign ‘thank you’ by placing his fingertips of an open palm on his chin and dropping it away until his hand was palm up in front of his face. He received all sorts of chocolates and candies, books on children naming and rearing, some Quidditch supplies, and many baby gifts.
“I… apologize,” Snape gritted out. “How is it that he’s able to find me if he’s blind?”
Draco was hoping it was his father and Snape and Pomfrey behind the door, but it still didn’t prepare him for what he was seeing: his father lay chained to the bed by magic, his entire upper body bare to the air and medical personnel around him. It was strange to see his father so vulnerable, to see him in so much pain. And that’s when he realized the source of the pain was the Dark Mark on his left forearm. Voldemort was torturing him through it! And by the look on Severus’ face, he was feeling the same thing.
Harry fumed silently.
“Yes sir,” they responded. “Um sir?” Ron asked. “I don’t know if it will help, but maybe the Map can help. It shows all of Hogwarts and who’s where.”
“They won’t separate us, I promise. You know I wouldn’t let them.”
Sheesh, that was about a billion and two times harder than the first chapter. But tell me what you think! I like this fic and I think it’s turning out splendidly! o.O I can’t believe I just used the word “splendidly”.
“Yeah, okay,” Harry answered. “Is that all?” Theresa nodded and watched as Blaise helped him off the table. Harry made his way to his room and closed the door behind him.
Harry looked down at his naked husband and saw a small piece of blue ribbon… tied in a pretty bow around the base of an erect cock. He almost stopped breathing.
Harry’s eyes lit up and he motioned the sign for ‘knowledge’. “Really? You know a charm for that?” Draco wondered skeptically.
“You, Severus,” Draco answered, using his own hand to lower Harry’s outstretched arm. “Why did you knock? We thought someone was trying to get into your rooms.”
Harry’s bracelet. Four times Draco had called Dumbledore, Snape, Pomfrey, and Harry to his side over It moving or a bout of paranoia or because he felt like it (once). Snape had ripped him a new one over the last excuse. It sent Draco into hysterical tears which was left to Harry to deal with. No potions were allowed at this point in the pregnancy.
The next morning, Harry woke alone. He was fully awake in an instant, sending his magic out to find Draco. When he realized he wasn’t in the room at all, he ran out into the hallway and pushed his magic throughout the whole of the rooms to find his lost mate. Moments later, Snape came storming from his room in a dressing gown cursing to high heaven.
a wise decision. You nearly drained yourself completely. Dumbledore gave some of his magic to you so it would replenish itself over time as magic normally does. Father and Severus do thank you for removing the Marks, however.”
“The wards stayed up, and the food kept coming. And Harry stayed on the ground. On the third morning, I woke up being floated back to the ground. As soon as I was down and fully awake, I started yelling at him for any- and everything I could think of. I must have ranted for ten, twenty minutes before-” Harry was gesturing wildly. “It was not a full hour and you know it! I finally realized he wasn’t saying anything back. We were friendly by now.” Harry gestured some more. “I am not saying that.”
“We’ll need to let everyone know. We have to find a time where Severus, McGonagall, Pomfrey, and Dumbledore can all be together. And sometime when we can leave these rooms. I don’t want my wedding in these rooms, Harry. I want to be in the Great Hall or something. Then I can imagine it’s at least filled with people and that I’m having a grand party. I can at least have decorations on one table for all of us, and pick out robes for us. And vows, we could write our own vows.”
“McKay?” Harry cooed. “Say hello to your real daddy for me, please. Say hello to Draco.” McKay cooed and giggled at Harry’s tone of voice and the little wave that Draco gave. “Good enough?”
Still wailing, still yelling, Draco continued to thrash about to take his frustrations out on the only thing he could: Harry. Oh, he would regret it later, but right now he was too upset with the situation for it to mean anything. Harry tightened his arms a bit more, effectively keeping his pregnant husband from squirming about.
“Let the record show that the paternity test I will soon administer will verify these statements as 100% truth in addition to the Veratiserum statements. Harry, did you give birth to McKay?”
Draco had found Harry sulking around outside near the lake one day and went to tease him. When he didn’t get a rise out the Gryffindor, he moved on to more hurtful things: his parents, his friends, his godfather. That last one got Harry to ball his fists and turn to face the Slytherin. Harry began to say things back to Draco, and soon Draco had had enough. He pulled his fist back and punched Harry square in the face. Harry’s head jerked back, but he didn’t do anything in retaliation. As a stream of blood ran from his nose, he looked Draco in the eyes and silently asked him to do it again. That look caused Draco to rear back in shock.
“I love you too, Harry,” Draco whispered before finally falling asleep. The day really had taken most of his energy, just realizing he was completely safe and then telling part of their tale again. It had been so long since he’d had anyone besides Harry to talk to. He loved Harry, but people were a necessity. He was sure that had they stayed out there any longer… He let that thought fall as even his subconscious fell asleep.
“What are you going to name your child?” she asked no one in particular.
“When Weasley and Granger burst in, Harry did an invisibility spell over us,” Draco explained. “He held one hand over my mouth to quiet me before explaining what he was doing. Then he used legillimancy to plant those ideas and thoughts in your head to cover our tracks. That will keep them at bay for a while until we are ready to be seen. I agree with you about not attending classes and things; it is too soon. There’s no way Harry will let me out of his sight. And quite frankly, I don’t want to be away from him.”
“Potter, the only thing that would help would be to- What?! What do you mean?”
“You know, you need to sleep. We’re back at Hogwarts now. Nothing can hurt us. And I know you’re a light sleeper so it’s not like they can sneak up on us and hurt us. You need to sleep. I know your body heals itself mostly and that you’re fine. I understand this. But I still worry about you, Harry. Please, just for an hour or two? You haven’t slept since before we got back here!”
“Of course!”
“What about flowers and colours and napkins and things?” Draco asked with wide eyes.
“I concur,” Draco said. “We’re not discussing Harry’s sex habits. That is for me to know and you to fantasize about, Granger.” He smirked, settling back in his seat with a smug air about him.
“Christmas sixth year? Yeah, last Christmas for Creevy. And yours was... Graduation? Really? You thought it would take that long? Of course, I thought they had it at the Tri-Wizard Tournament in fourth year. Weasley couldn’t keep his eyes off Granger throughout the whole fiasco. You two really didn’t start dating until Christmas last?”
“I believe there is much the two of you need to discuss,” Dumbledore stated, rising to his feet and making to leave. “I will leave you to it, and return to Severus’ side. Soon, he will wish most vehemently to return to his own rooms. Poppy will need some help to deal with him then.” He chuckled and left the room, closing the door to Snape’s rooms as he left.
“Don’t be stupid Ron,” Hermione said. “Malfoy’s in the hospital wing right now recovering from the attack in the Forbidden Forest during that same detention. They said the only reason he’s still alive is because Harry was there to help him. Now then, if Harry wasn’t there then how did Malfoy survive? I agree though, this should have been spaced out more. It sure is nice not having Malfoy about to torture us though, don’t you think?”
“Father, please say something!” Draco begged, tears gathering in his eyes.
That being said, she went back to her patient. While Dumbledore waited for Lucius to regain complete consciousness, Snape grew louder and more urgent. At last, Lucius opened his eyes.
“Please join hands with your betrothed and listen to that which I am about to say. Above you are the stars, below you are the stones, as time doth pass, remember... Like a stone should your love be firm; like a star should your love be constant. Let the powers of the mind and of the intellect guide you in your marriage, let the strength of your wills bind you together, let the power of love and desire make you happy, and the strength of your dedication make you inseparable. Be close, but not too close. Possess one another, yet be understanding. Have patience with one another, for storms will come, but they will pass quickly.
“Wait Harry, wait!” the blonde was insisting, pushing at his husband’s shoulders. “Wait, you need to listen for a moment.” So Harry sat back and waited for the blonde to start talking. “It is tradition for the bride of the wedding to follow a rhyme. She has to wear something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue, with a silver sickle in her shoe. Well, I took it upon myself to at least follow this tradition, even if we’re both men. The something old are the rings. Madam Pomfrey told me they were hers from her marriage, and that she wanted us to have them. The something new are the robes McGonagall got for us. The something borrowed were the boots I was wearing; they’re Severus’. Did you notice me wearing anything blue?”
“I just wanted to let you know that your daddy loves you. Not Blaise, because Blaise isn’t your real daddy. Draco, you remember me telling you about him? Well, he’s the man with the blonde hair and beautiful steel gray eyes. He’s your real daddy. Blaise will love you too, don’t get me wrong. It’s just that Draco would have loved you so much more because he helped to make you. And I don’t want you to ever think that it was your fault that he left. It was nobody’s fault except his own. Draco just threw a hissy fit when he saw something and misinterpreted it.” Harry sighed.
trying to talk to him. “Go slowly, but make it quick. I don’t understand you and I have places to be,” he growled. He watched and tried to make sense of the signs. “Death Eater? Yes, okay. No… no bad? Not bad. Not a bad Death Eater? Yes, that’s right Po-
, Harry wrote in the air.
Dr. Morris was speechless for a moment. Then she shook her head before looking at them all again. “Let me get this straight. You love him,” she said, pointing to Harry then Draco. They nodded. “And had his baby?” Another nod. “But you married him,” she said, pointing to Blaise, “because he,” pointing to Draco, “left without knowing about him,” pointing to McKay. More nods. “Then you,” pointing to Blaise, “hired her,” pointing to Theresa, “and you,” still pointing to Theresa, “cared for him and him,” pointing to Harry and McKay. Nodding. “Now, you two want to separate?” she asked, motioning between Blaise and Harry. Nodding. “And you want to marry him?” She pointed at Harry, then Draco, only to receive another couple of nods. “And change his name?” She pointed at McKay.
“After much debate, we have agreed on what to tell you two. You know the most important bits, and have surely already guessed more.” He went on to describe the detention, the start of their wanderings, and most of the obstacles they faced in their travels of the Forbidden Forest. He had to stop so Ron could explain the shock behind Draco using Harry’s wand so easily.
“Miss Granger, I assure you, we would have told you eventually,” Snape started.
“I don’t think we will ever know how he did that, Poppy,” Dumbledore replied. “He was a remarkable young man before this incident in the Forbidden Forest. He is a most remarkable young man now. There are many–”
“There’s nothing wrong with him, Headmaster. He’s waking up.”
, without touching or seeing or ‘hearing’ Harry. He had wanted to say ‘screw tradition, where is he?!’, but didn’t for the sake of tradition. If their child had to go through that day of torture, Draco would insist they didn’t have to if they didn’t want to. It was torture, sheer torture. And all for the sake of tradition?
A knock on the door heralded Luna’s arrival. She sat down in the chair next to the fire and greeted everyone in the same dreamy manner she usually did. The soon-to-be seventh year student was ready with her quill and parchment, the quill stuck behind her ear. Her radish earrings swung merrily from her earlobes.
“No. Now I have a favour to ask of you. As a friend. Please, Severus, you must help me in this.” The sincerity in Lucius’ eyes and pleading in his voice rooted Severus to the spot. He nodded once, jerkily. “You know what He has planned for Draco. I can’t allow that to happen. You’re closest to him. Tell him about yourself, tell him to contact me to confirm it. Don’t let him walk the same path as me. Get him to make friends with that Potter boy you hate so much. Whatever it takes. Don’t let him meet the same fate as me.”
“Of course I do. I just spent the last three weeks gathering all this stuff and recording and spelling it for you. I’ll likely not forget it for months!”
“Lucius! Mr. Weasley! You will both calm yourselves or you will both leave!” Pomfrey yelled. “Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley, all will be explained in due time. The only thing that matters at this time is Mr. Potter-Malfoy’s life. And that seems to be in jeopardy. Miss Granger, in that room to the left of the main entrance is Professor Snape’s guest loo. Please get me the lemon yellow and lavender purple potions from above the sink. Thank-you. Mr. Weasley, do as you are told. Help Mr. Potter-Malfoy onto the bed behind me. He needs to sit. His father can attend to him from there. Albus, will you help me transplant a bit of magic into Mr. Potter-Malfoy here to get him going again?”
“Harry, it’s the middle of the afternoon.” With a slight groan, he started to stand up. Harry was right beside him, assisting him with his slightly off-balance girth.
“I was asked to come here because of my work in this field. I have only been working with male pregnancies for the last four years, but the work I have done has been my life. I have always gotten along well enough with my patients and have always offered the best care. Anything you or your husband want, I will try my hardest to get.”
The message was clear: There is to be no mention of Snape in this bed, especially on this night.
“Hey, Harry!” Ron greeted.
“Oh, Draco. Of course I will! I was just upset that no one has mentioned anything all day. I know it makes me sound full of myself, but I was sure someone would say something. Everyone knows my birthday, and lots of people have said things before. But today... It just seemed weird. Even Ron didn't say anything!”
because I feel just like a kid again.
did happen. However, Dumbledore is not dead. The events of
“You cook? I don’t believe it.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
As they Apparated and then walked home, things were quiet and still. Draco opened the front door and let Harry walk in first to get the full detail at first glance.
Harry lazily waved his arm over them and then toward the door as Draco pulled the covers up. It only took seconds for those outside to realize the door was once more unlocked. Pomfrey made it in first. “You two ought to be ashamed! Locking us out like that. What if something had happened? If Draco had gone into distress or Harry had passed out? We couldn’t have gotten in in that case! And Mr. Potter, that is highly inappropriate considering you and Mr. Malfoy need to rest after all you’ve been through. If you’re tired, there is another bed just here for you to rest upon.”
I wish you’d do it again.
Ron wouldn’t find out what she wanted as there was a knock on the door. Hermione ran into the bathroom to clean herself up, leaving him with the job of answering the door. Just before he got to it, there was another knock. “I’m coming,” Ron said as he opened the door. “Yes? Can I help you?”
“So that upset me. Then I was worried about ancestral things. If we named It ‘Malfoy’, would It have access to the Potter vaults, Potter heirlooms, Potter wills? Or if we named It ‘Potter‘, would It have all those things from the Malfoys? There was just a lot of things that hit me all at once when she mentioned whose name It would take. Harry calmed me though. He first distracted me with his kiss, then he reassured me that no matter what we named It, It would have the best of both our namesakes. Then he said we could always get married and hyphen our name. That would solve everything. And he was describing our wedding. And then he was describing our-” Here, Draco stopped short. “Well, I’m sure you can understand where it went from there.”
“My mum made sure I’d be able to sustain myself in case anything ever happened to me. You’d be surprised what all I can do. What sounds good, Harry?”
“Do you feel any pain?” Blaise asked.
Draco was only allowed to do two of those three things. He called for the house elf Severus had insisted he use since Harry was not there to watch and protect him. At three months pregnant, Draco’s balance was slightly off. As such, Severus had demanded that Draco not bathe alone. The house elf popped up next to him and guided him to the bathroom where he was to bathe before the wedding. Wanting some time to relax and think about last minute things, Draco sank into the slightly hot water with calming oils and salts, and let his weight be taken from him. He loved being in water.
“You cannot eat in the Great Hall, Draco,” Snape corrected. “If someone sees either of you, it could blow the cover story we have of you in the hospital wing and Potter training. Maybe you can go out, but not with Harry.” That idea was quickly shot down by the silent boy-who-lived. “And of course Poppy will be there. I only know what I needed for the course and to stay alive these last several years. While I may be able to do your check-ups on my own, I may miss something that could be vital to you or your child’s health. We wouldn’t want that, now would we?”
Malfoy senior rushed to his child, gathering him close. Despite the public farce he’d had to show, he really did care for his son. Even in private, due to his wife’s allegiances, he wasn’t able to show any concern for the boy. Now a young man, he had a lot of time to make up for in his emotional neglect.
“To take care of a pregnant wizard.”
“My mum and Molly Weasley would have to get together to plan everything out. Between our money, nothing would be second best. We’d have engraved invitations, tablecloths, cloth napkins with holders, all the proper cutlery, at least five courses for the main meal, an eight-tiered cake, flowers at every table. You and I would be sitting at the head table with our parents, the Weasleys for you, sitting beside us. I guess Dumbledore could officiate again, allowing us to renew our vows instead of actually getting married.
“Of course. Good night Terry.”
“Yes, yes, yes!” Draco chanted. He had leaned forward so he was raised up on his knees, his hands holding the headboard in a tight grip, his head hanging between his elbows. “Come on, baby, do it. Fill me up.”
Harry asked by writing in the air in front of Draco.
I really never want to experience potions. Robitussen is bad enough, thanks!
“And you are pregnant,” she continued. “That alone changes everything. Your course load would have to be rethought and restructured; no potions, no practical transfiguration, no care of magical creatures. A jostle in the hallway that was just a bit too hard could hurt you, cause you to fall, and further on down the line, cause you to miscarry in the worst scenario. It’s just not a good idea. And we surely don’t want You-Know-Who to know about this either. He would surely kill you and your child, or maybe he would take the child as it is Mr. Potter’s. The things he could do with-” Her mouth kept moving but there was no longer any sound coming out of it. She quickly realized this and her hands went to her throat.
Narcissa Malfoy – the doting mother, the worrier, the planner. It was obvious where Draco got his nesting skills from. Harry and Lucius shared many looks of sympathy during this phase of the pregnancy.
Molly was busy snapping pictures. Narcissa was wiping her eyes with a handkerchief. Snape was smiling, though he’d deny it if anyone dared accuse him otherwise.
“Father!” Draco shrieked, rushing to the door and wrenching it open. “We can hear you in here! And Harry
After that, two buffet tables filled with food to munch on appeared – sandwiches, vegetable platters, fruit platters, dips, chips, cake bites, candy, and more birthday cake slices. Harry floated a plate of fruit and dip over to himself and Draco, feeding Draco bits of the sweet treat. Several people cooed in affection at the sight. Harry, himself, snagged another piece of birthday cake, confetti vanilla this time complete with sprinkles.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
going to do?!” she cried. The entire common room focused their attention on Hermione, who was standing and shouting and basically having a panic attack.
“Lots of things, my dear. Where is your medi-witch? I should like to talk to her as well.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“It means goodnight, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco supplied quietly. “See you in the morning.”
It took time for Harry to rejoin the land of the conscious. It was mid-March by the time he truly came around and Draco was truly starting to show in his fifth month. For the last two and a half weeks, Draco had fought off the pressures of the rest of the Gryffindor Trio to tell all and let them into his life. He wanted nothing to do with them. They were not a part of his life, except that they were part of Harry’s life. He didn’t know what he would do about that, but he’d cross that river when he came to it.
“Blaise, why did you marry Harry?”
Madam Pomfrey handed Dumbledore an ornate chalice filled with water. Although it was custom for it to be filled with wine, they used water in difference to Draco’s pregnant state. He turned to Harry. “May you drink your fill from the cup of love.” Harry holds chalice for Draco while he sips, then Draco takes chalice and holds it for Harry while he sips. The chalice is then handed back to Dumbledore who sets it on the table. Next Dumbledore takes the plate of bread, giving it to Harry. The same procedure is repeated with the bread, Harry feeding Draco and Draco feeding Harry. Once the bread was set aside, Dumbledore turned to them both. “Severus told me you wished to say your own vows?”
“Swell! You made me out to be a nancy boy!” Draco cried. Harry signed something next to him with a smile. “Just because I bottom for you, Potter, doesn’t make me a nancy boy. May I remind you that on several occasions, I was the one who-”
“It’s not fair!”
“I don’t, don’t understand.”
. This was my take on something that’s been done a few times is all.
“Like the fact that Harry wasn’t moved for training and Malfoy’s not in the infirmary, you mean?” Hermione asked, having regained her breath once more. Five, yes all five, sets of eyes looked upon her shocked. “We were thinking, maybe you only said Harry had been moved. Maybe he was still in the castle. We couldn’t figure out why he would be taken from Hogwarts when it’s the safest place and Moody came here last year. Why couldn’t that happen again this year?”
Harry slowly moved his right palm over his face from forehead to chin, then took two fingers and moved them from right cheekbone to chin before repeating that movement on Draco.
“I don’t mind, really.”
“Severus... Severus, help me... Please... Anyone...”
“Shh! Do you want him to hear? I've started my part. Get him out of the house and I'll finish it.”
“Just so,” Draco agreed. They’d all agreed to keep Harry’s magical abilities to themselves, not needing Voldemort to know how powerful Harry was without a wand. “He can’t see very well, but his magic gives him plenty of information. For instance, he has no idea your briefcase is brown, Mr. Volkanov, but he could pick it up and carry it away with perfect accuracy – no groping about. He knows where Severus is standing behind him without looking. He knows where the spiders in this room are. He can navigate back to the Great Hall with no assistance from this room.”
Harry spent the first three hours testing every little thing Draco could possibly come in contact with while in the rooms, only leaving out Snape’s personal bedchambers. The look he gave Snape as he passed the door said what his vocal chords could not:
“No, I'm setting the record straight.” He shrugged out of Draco's hold and staggered to the side. After righting himself, he continued. “If you really want to know, Draco likes to make me make him beg. That's right. Draco is gagging for me, probably even right now. He likes to be a slave to me.”
“Anyways, it charged us and chased after us. Harry runs rather fast, in case anyone was wondering. I, however, do not. He had to practically pull me along behind him. Then he levitated me up into a tree before climbing up himself. The bicorn proceeded to ram the tree, forcing us to hold on for our lives. He kept it up for over three hours. Harry blasted hexes and curses at it, trying to get it to go away, but I think it only made it madder. Just before that third hour was up, the worst possible thing happened. I dropped my wand. It had been in my inner robe pocket, and all the jostling around got it loose. The bicorn trampled it before it got bored with us and left.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
“Just listen. They know you're the top. And if you can keep me in as fine a life as I want, then you must be pretty damn good. No one will doubt you now,” Draco explained. “I have something that will make you feel even better. You've got the whole day off of work, and a dashing husband in your bed. I think you should do something about that.”
“Splendid! Tonight will be a night none of us will soon forget.”
Blaise smiled. “Of course. I do believe- Oof!” Blaise’s response was cut off when Harry practically tackled him.
Draco looked a little confused. “It’s nothing, really. I mean, I take great pride in my hair, but it grows fast. And in case you haven’t noticed I keep it relatively short which means I must cut it in some way. It would grow back. It’s really not
“Miss Granger, please calm yourself.”
I POSTED THE WRONG CHAPTER FOR CHAPTER 6! PLEASE REREAD 6 AND 7 SO IT MAKES SENSE!!!
“May we have the Map back, please sir?” Ron asked hopefully. Dumbledore smiled and handed it back to him.
“No,” Blaise answered. “Is everything okay? You seem edgy.”
I did it! I got through the birth! I’m so proud of myself. It’s the first time I’ve written a non-birth birth scene. Did that make any sense to anyone? In all my MPREGs, the men have always formed a birth canal. Not this time. It was a weird scene to write for me on this, the day of my nephew Stormageddon’s birth. By the time you read this, that day will have come and gone. But it mirrored Stormageddon’s birth quite a bit. Including the tuft of dark hair despite having two light-blonde parents! Anywho, here are the translations for the spells Madam Pomfrey used on Corvus and Draco:
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
. I got to thinking, I liked that fic too. So I decided to write another fic similar to that one. So this is for you,
Harry moved up behind his husband and wrapped his arms around the protruding belly. Surprised by the hard feel of the belly and the rippling of skin he felt, he moved around to Draco’s side and squinted his eyes in question. Draco sighed and nodded.
So I was going to make this a short story, kinda like my other two. However, I don’t think I can make too much of it. So, yeah. It’s a one-shot now. Yeah. That works for me. If you don’t like it, stop reading. Or don’t read at all. Or continue reading, complain about it, send me flames. My response will be: all flames are put in a jar and will be used when I take over the world. Because I will one day. I just have to learn who all I want to keep around. *crickets* I mean… *clears throat*
“They were told that Potter and he were to serve detention in the Forbidden Forest due to a fight during one of their classes. During the detention, they were attacked. Malfoy was taken to the infirmary to recover and Potter was taken away for training. Just recently, my son was told that Malfoy had been taken home to recover and Potter was still away for training. Because he was not there, chaos ensued when younger Slytherins tried to gain an upper hand on their elders.”
All this occurred before Halloween. Corvus was only a month old. Harry had been terrified, but knew he had no choice. He was also terrified of waking his husband after returning to his side. Draco was going to be horrified and absolutely livid. They’d promised, in the Forest, to always stay together, to face whatever came at them together. Yet Harry went off on his own to face Voldemort. Harry didn’t see it that way. Of course, that’s what the two sides of the fighting was about once Draco was awakened.
“Perfect!” Dumbledore said, clapping his hands. “Now that that’s settled, how about presents?”
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“It’s okay, Harry,” he soothed. “It will be okay. I know where he lives. Come on. We can go, right now, to his house and talk to him. We need to get this cleared up and quickly. Come on, I can apparate.” Blaise pulled a shocked Harry along behind him and apparated to Malfoy Manor. He knocked on the door and was greeted by Mrs. Malfoy. “Hello Narcissa,” Blaise began. “May we come in?”
The elder Malfoy quickly smothered Snape on the couch to hide his partially nude body from view of the teenagers gawking from within the guest bedroom. “What are all of you doing here at this hour?!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s pregnant, Hermione. There are a number of men who are able to. It’s not uncommon, though I’ve never met one personally. And I’m assuming the baby is Harry’s. That would be why they stayed hidden when we were in the headmaster’s office the last time. He doesn’t want anyone to know... any of it.”
Draco had tears in his eyes, as did Harry. His vows were even simpler than his blonde mate. He raised his right hand with two fingers extended and placed them on his cheekbone. Then he dragged them to his jaw line before moving the hand to Draco’s left cheekbone and doing the same thing there; their sign for “I love you”. A lone tear fell down Draco’s cheek.
“Well, what do you think it is then. A contraction?” As soon as he said it they both knew that’s what it was. “Oh sweet Merlin. Blaise, what do I do?”
“Just because it’s dark now doesn’t mean it will stay dark. Same with the eyes. All newborns have blue eyes, but they can and probably will change within the next month. Here’s a bottle; he’ll want to feed. Do you remember everything I’ve taught you? Good. I don’t want to be woken every few hours to feed him. Also, I will have silencing charms around my rooms. My hours are from 8:00am to 10:00pm unless otherwise told. The ten hours of sleep and rest I get I plan on getting. You on the other hand… Well, sleep whenever he sleeps for now. That’s the best advice I’ve got for you.”
was all it said.
He was really going to have to learn to listen to the man when it came to the Malfoys. Everything he’d thought he’d known was wrong. He’d learned the truth about Draco in the Forbidden Forest. He’d learned about Lucius every day since he’d been brought to Hogwarts by Severus. He’d learned about Narcissa after she’d turned up beaten, broken, and bloody at the Hogwarts gates.
asking for another fic or ficlet like
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room.” He didn’t even get to truly finish the song when Harry interrupted him with a needy, passionate kiss on the lips.
Profero uterum – produce womb – removing the womb from Draco
Harry was gesturing again.
“I’m gonna show you just why Voldemort feared me if you don’t get out of my sight!” Harry threatened playfully.
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
That was another point on the check-list: Harry’s abilities. He needed to have his magic measured. The things he could do even though he was blind and mute were astounding. Most people, including Draco, forgot he was blind. He didn’t need help getting around and his magic saw for him. Whatever he needed, his magic would find a way to make it so. He hadn’t used a wand in nearly six months; Draco used it instead. Sitting in his reclining chair, Draco looked over the wand that was once Harry Potter’s.
“Bloody hell Blaise! You could have told me you were going to be doing this today! I would have at least come down dressed! Grr!” Harry stomped away, quietly cursing the man he called husband. “And I still want my fried ham!” he called out once he reached his rooms again.
Dimitri’s eyes flicked to Snape, wide and scared. Severus merely sneered.
Up in Draco and Harry's room, Draco was taking Harry's trousers off. But there was no joy in the task because Harry had passed out as soon as he'd sat down on the bed.
Draco gave a half sob at the use of their new name, but smiled immediately afterwards. They sat, moving their nameplates to the top of their dinner plates. Salads and soups appeared before their eyes.
“What about Theresa?” Blaise asked. “She’s kinda important.”
“You carry ten pounds inside of you and see how small you feel,” Harry shot back playfully. “Can I go back to my room now? I don’t like this table thing.”
So much for an afterglow.
The music changed to an older song, but more upbeat music.
“She makes it seem like I know what she’s doing,” Harry quipped. “Like I had any idea I could even get pregnant until I went to see Madame Pomfrey. She’s the one that chastised me for nearly an hour about unprotected sex. Now there’s something I could have lived without.”
“I too am a Slytherin, Lucius. Say it.”
While Hermione conjured two chairs for her and Ron, Draco and Harry talked over what they would tell the rest of the Gryffindor Trio. It didn’t take the two newcomers long to figure out that Harry couldn’t speak for some reason and that they had worked out a language using motions to communicate.
“Splendid!” Molly agreed.
“Blaise, how many men have you had sex with?” Blaise only mumbled something. “I’m sorry Blaise, but the quill didn’t get that. How many?”
Draco couldn’t wait to get back to the dungeons. A whole day, more than twenty-four hours, without being near and around and touching Harry was almost his undoing. If the next ten minutes didn’t include him, Harry, and a bed, he’d scream! Luckily enough, it did. When they reached the entrance to Snape’s private rooms, Harry touched the door and then swept Draco off his feet to carry him over the threshold… and straight to their bedroom. He didn’t even bother with romantics as he kicked the door shut and put up several warding and silencing charms. He banished Draco’s and his clothes to the other side of the room, stopping only at Draco’s protest.
“Very well Dr. Rhodes,” Harry said, standing and offering his hand to shake. “Thank you. Please, rejoin the others and Blaise in the kitchen. Dr. Johansen?” The last doctor walked in with a smile on her face. “Please, sit down. Do you know who I am?”
“I was asked if I could be discrete with a male pregnancy case. I accepted and was told to come here at ten o’clock this morning. Your husband told me the situation: you were married recently and are now pregnant and he wishes for a mediwitch or -wizard who will be able to work with you and at some point, live within in the house. He asked for credentials as well as capability.”
Of course all the professors showed up – Dumbledore, Snape, Hagrid, Grubby-Plank, Sinistra, McGonagall, Flitwick, Hooch, Sprout, and Madam Pomfrey. Even Binns and Trewlawny came! Firenze sent his regards. Remus, Narcissa, and Lucius also attended.
“What guarantees can you provide I won’t return to my rooms right this moment to find Potter defiling my godson?” he snarled, arms crossed as he towered over the sitting headmaster.

I used to sit beside Harry Potter
“Yes.”
Harry took the offered potion from his professor and threw it at the Dark Lord, causing the glass to shatter and coat the (man? Maybe…) in the potion. A silent scream was ripped from Voldemort’s throat since the silencing spell was still in effect. “Good-bye Tom, for the final time.
“No, not about that. Rather, about this plan to have your story go public.”
“Apologies, my Lord, I did not mean to offend you.” Lucius bowed once more in submission.
Draco could see the tension and stress building in Harry, so he placed a gentle hand on Harry’s cheek. “Calm down, love,” he whispered. “We don’t need to answer those questions right now. Let’s just go back to our room and look at the book on baby names.” He watched Harry gesture a few times. “Yes, I know we already have names picked out. I just think it would be fun anyways. Relaxing.”
The fire roared to life as the floo powder hit it, but was quickly quiet again after Harry went through with Draco in his arms. He landed on the other side, just barely managing to turn his body so he took the brunt of the impact with the floor and sheltered Draco instead. When a hand touched his arm, he was on his feet lightning fast, cradling Draco closer to himself in case it was a threat. Instead, it was only Pomfrey. The fireplace beside him roared to life and then spit out Severus, albeit much more smoothly. “Poppy, these two walked into my office nice as you please not five minutes ago. They walked in as if not a day has passed, but once we reached my office…” He motioned to them as if in explanation.
Draco dipped the ice lolly in the whipped cream then dashed some hot sauce over that. Sucking on it, he made a truly sinful noise of enjoyment. It brought Harry out of the bedroom to see what was going on. Upon seeing the snack, he blanched and returned to their room. Draco never noticed.
“Anytime, Hermione. I’ve got some homework to finish, if you’ll excuse me.”
Harry’s other hand moved to Draco’s cock and started pumping it in earnest, tightening and twisting every third or fourth pull. Draco jerked his hips into Harry’s hand once, twice and then was coming. He cried out, long and loud as his come landed on the bedspread. Harry kept up his slow thrusts as Draco milked his own orgasm from him. Though he couldn’t impregnate Draco again right then, he held still when he was done to just savor the moment and the feeling.
With that, he slammed the nursery door in Harry’s face. The sounds of Draco instructing new paint colors on the walls and a rearrangement of the plushies could be heard. Harry wandered back into the living room where Severus was reading
“Just be careful with my godson, Potter,” he hissed before stalking into his bedroom.
“Draco!” Harry practically shrieked. He slapped Draco's arm in indignation.
“I must agree Albus,” Snape added. “I believe it is time to get a real password. There are things said in this office that should not leave it.”
“Same answer. As a friend, but nothing more.”
“No. He explained it as a bastardized version of Muggle Sign Language,” Draco explained. “We came up with symbols and signs for the most common words we used. When he speaks of him, Weasley, and Granger, he holds up three fingers like so. And when he speaks of Dumbledore, he widens his eyes and motions like he’s stroking his beard. When he speaks of Voldemort, he holds up two fingers in the shape of a ‘v’ and then makes a slashing motion with his right hand. I thought it was ingenious since he needed to communicate with me somehow.”
“I already answered this. He’s my friend. I wasn’t going to let him suffer.”
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of
“Figure something out, Malfoy. He's your lover.”
Tonight it seemed to be the first option, and oh how the Dark Lord was pissed. When the curse was finally lifted, Severus lay panting on the ground. As quick as he could, he made it to his feet and bowed once more to his master. “Lucius!” Voldemort called next. The blonde man, although you couldn’t tell it by the mask and the hood, stepped forward and bowed. “How old is your son?”
“What is wrong with his holding a hand at me?” Snape asked.
“Yes, I think he will.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Harry’s glare softened a smidge, and he looked down at Draco with sad eyes. When he looked back up at Poppy, his gaze almost broke her heart. Slowly, his grip slackened and he got off the bed. He didn’t leave the bedside, but he did move away just enough for Poppy to scan Draco and him separately. She did just that, somehow knowing to make slow, calming movements so as not to startle him. She gasped when she read what the quill she had charmed to write on the parchment beside her wrote down. It was all of the injuries Draco was suffering from. She turned to Harry and did the same for him.
Harry nodded and stood to dismiss the woman back to the kitchens. “Dr. Mitchsens?” Harry called next.
“Just because you like women doesn’t prove anything Blaise,” Dr. Morris said. “You have slept with other men before and you just said that it was pleasurable. Now we need to figure out why you slept with Harry.”
Harry immediately rounded on him and took him into his arms. After crushing him for several minutes, he held him at arm’s length and did a magical scan. When he seemed satisfied, he crushed Draco to him again.
Dimitri gasped, the shock coming from Draco’s openness as to his parents’ alliances. No one said such a thing out loud. It just wasn’t done. After a split second, he realized he should be writing and got back to it. Draco graciously allowed him a moment to catch up.
Tears sprang to her eyes, then Molly was up and around the table in an instant. “Oh, my precious baby boy! How good of you to keep your friend’s secret like that! Harry’s safety is top priority and you did so well!” She grabbed him in a hug and cried against his shoulder, seeing as he was taller than her now. She reached out and grabbed Hermione too. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten about you, dear! I’m proud of you too!”
“But I did, Harry,” Draco said with a smile. “See, you got very upset when one of our co-workers suggested that you were unmanly and therefore the bottom in our bedroom. So you set them straight. And I, of course, had to come to your aide.”
Draco nodded and thanked his husband. Then he started complaining again.
“Burning jewellery? That makes no sense, Headmaster.”
“I am a doctor who specializes in male pregnancies. I was asked this morning around seven o’clock, when my shift ended, if I would like to be a personal doctor for a hush hush male pregnancy case. Of course I was intrigued. I accepted and was asked to be here, at this house, by ten o’clock. I went home, took a shower and changed my clothes, then came here. I was third to arrive, only to be followed by Dr. Mitchsens. Mr. Zabini told us that he had been married within the last week and that you were pregnant. He referred to you as Harry at all times. He mentioned the cravings you’d been having and that things were rather hectic in your life so stress would be a problem. He gave us some scenarios and asked for the answers we’d give.”
“Of course. I was just there last night.”
“Yes… well,” Harry said, pulling his hand away from the doctor who was still shaking it. “Please, sit. I wanted to ask you just a few questions. Do you know who I am?”
It was Perfect.
“Thank you Dr. Mitchsens. Dr. Johansen?”
“Do you or do you not have silencing charms? Besides, it hasn’t stopped us before.”
“Our necklaces, charmed for us each, tells us when another is in peril,” Ron explained quickly. “Harry’s is
“Who says it’s the Potter heir?” Draco finally snapped. “Maybe it’s the Black heir, or the Malfoy heir. You don’t know!”
Another contraction came, this time only an hour after the previous one. It was already past nine o’clock at night. Snape said he was going to bed and to wake him if he was needed. Narcissa and Molly and Harry all took pepper-up potions and stayed with Draco. When possible, he napped. Otherwise, he lay and sniffled at the discomfort or walked the nursery quietly with Harry’s assistance.
“Harry, Harry Potter. He’s been gone for so long now. Everyone knows the three of you are always together. It can’t be easy to split the three of you apart. I just wanted to say I’m sorry and that if Hermione, or you even, need someone to talk to that I’m here.”
“Are you satisfied?” Draco bit out dryly. He stomped back to their room, Harry following and gesturing wildly. “I don’t know what you’re saying Harry. I can’t see you. And no, I won’t turn around. I’m mad. And I want to stay mad damn it! I want some say in this. I don’t know them. They’re not my friends. They’re your friends. Let them know that you’re okay, that you’re blind and mute. Use a Quick Quotes Quill, or legillimancy, or something to communicate with them. You don’t need me to be there to translate for you all the time. You can manage on your own for an hour. And I’ll be here in these rooms. I won’t be going anywhere. Like always.”

“Can we not discuss my best mate’s... sex habits while I’m here? Please?” Ron asked, looking slightly green.
“It’s okay father,” Blaise responded with a smile as he placed his left arm around Harry’s waist. “Harry and I are off to one of the properties. We don’t think going somewhere public is a good idea. We want to keep this quiet until
“Yeah. But that wasn’t until about two months in. Actually, Fluffy did most of the work.”
