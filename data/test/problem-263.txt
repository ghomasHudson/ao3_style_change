‘That’s enough for me. I shouldn’t complain, you know how much I love you in those glasses.’ Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco snapped that particular book closed before he was sick all over it. Although that might have been an improvement.
“Oh I love foxes! I have such interesting conversations with them. Please, come and say hello. The plants would love to see you.” As was often the case when he spoke with Luna, Harry was utterly lost for words. He wanted to ask her how she knew the plants would love to see him, or if she had actual conversations with foxes like he did with snakes, or if she just talked to them as he had been just now. He had just started to ask her when she hung up on him mid-sentence. Whilst Luna adored muggle phones, she hadn’t really got the hang of them yet.
“I want to know everything,” Pansy said calmly, her hands with her perfectly manicured nails resting neatly on the table.
“We’re your friends!” Greg said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. For a moment Draco forgot how bone weary he was, how drained and sick he felt. There were people in the world who did believe in him, even before they knew anything, and he hadn’t even given them the opportunity to step up for him.
‘Ah, Mr Potter. I see we’re awake again. No doubt you feel like shit and would rather not see me right now.’ Draco liked his guy immediately.
Checking his watch, he realised Granger had already been gone for forty-five minutes and he was running out of time. He took out the silver ‘letter opener’ and took a deep breath before slicing across his left palm. He held the cut hand over the snapped thread of ward and allowed his blood to drop directly onto the raw magic. Around him he could feel the house shiver. The walls quivered and the windows rattled and if he wasn’t much mistaken, the room brightened. He wondered whether the increasing darkness and chill in the house was actually a product of neglect. Merlin knew his father wandered the hallways with such entitlement it probably never occurred to him how much maintenance and care the place needed.
‘I do appreciate it, thank you.’ He grabbed one of Harry’s hands and pulled him closer. ‘What’s got you so stressed though?
Draco snorted. ‘Letting your wife take brunt of the excitement? You’re letting the side down mate.’ They chatted amiably for a few minutes before a disgruntled looking Arthur appear with a fussing Hugo and Hermione excused herself.
‘Mummy,’ his odd voice cracked, and he wanted nothing more than to cry in her arms like he had when he was a little boy. He couldn’t cry now though, he didn’t know how to.
‘Hmf,’ came Harry’s muffled reply. Draco’s heart sped up with anxiousness. He didn’t know if Harry was still angry with him, or worse, disappointed. Draco battled with his own mind for a couple of minutes before he decided to swallow his pride. He wasn’t going to let a stupid little fight mean anything, not since he decided he was so determined to turn things around.
‘Ok. Tell Macmillan to come down and see me when he has the chance please.’ The intern nodded and scampered away. They always walked around the department like deer caught in the headlights and Draco wondered whether Harry purposefully put the fear of God into them. Harry seemed to know everyone and everything that went on in his department, unlike other department heads. Draco hadn’t realised just how much responsibility Harry was shouldering here. He’d been made Head Auror a year into their marriage and if Draco was honest, it really had put a strain on things.
‘Helen was just telling me the paperwork finally got approval from the muggle government, so we’ll be added to their systems as of next month and we can finally start taking in muggleborns.’ Draco nodded – that was certainly progress.
“Do you want me to stop?” There was something of a challenge in the question, but he could sense the unevenness of her breath.
“Well, then. You’re lucky you have me, aren’t you?” Harry doesn’t need to be able to see Malfoy to picture the broad smirk on his face.
‘Granger don’t tell me you’ve taken a job being Kingsley’s lacky. You’re better than that!’ He couldn’t believe his ears.
“It can wait a while,” Harry mused, letting his eyes close again. One day maybe he’d get to sleep a whole night with Draco pressed against his side like this. One day. Even though Harry enjoyed not feeling like he had to speak when he was around Draco, after a while he started to suspect something was off. Draco’s shoulders where still too tense, his breathing not quite even. A sliver of doubt crept into Harry’s mind. Was this not what Draco wanted?
‘It’s up to you.’ Harry frowned. Draco couldn’t exactly blame him. Draco tried to watch as Harry undressed, but his eyelids were already getting heavy. His heart fluttered as he felt Harry slip into the bed next to him and draw him against his chest. He could hear Harry’s heartbeat thumping steadily against his ear and he sighed as his fingers ran through his hair slowly. Wherever their bare skin touched Draco felt as though he was on fire, but it was worth it. He saw Harry’s arm wave out of the corner of his half-closed eyes and the shutters around the room closed, plunging them into darkness.
Draco snorted. ‘You. Capable of promoting your own political agenda. It’s so ludicrous its comical.’ Harry gave him an exasperated look and he sobered himself. ‘Alright. Fine. Where do we start?’ Harry’s grin was nearly blinding and it warmed Draco’s heart seeing him happy again.
A quick scourgify and some essence of dittany later and it looked like his arms would be fine. Ron was already snoring loudly at the far end of the flat and Harry felt bone tired. Of course, as soon as he tried to go to bed, the fox's screeching started up again.
Once it had, he was engulfed in a raging fire of pain. It sizzled through his nerve endings and fried his capacity for any deep thought. He gritted his teeth to keep from crying out as he felt like someone had set him on fire. What the hell happened? He didn’t remember a thing after Hermione had left.
He flinched as a particularly vicious pain lanced down his left side and a large shadow appeared across his vision before he felt his eyes roll into the back of his head and he was overcome by darkness again.
It took him a lot longer than it should to reach the top of the tower but when he finally did, he almost flung himself at Harry. He’d deliberately done the room out like the Gryffindor Common Room, with Hermione’s help. He thought that if Harry were ever to come here it might be overwhelming for him compared to other places he’d lived. He’d never lived in the Manor, and Hogwarts was different being a school. He’d tried to bring a little bit of home with him.
When they parted, he realised that it was the first time she’s initiated a kiss. It felt like some kind of revelation.
“Potter, please. Will it- will it make him happy?” Harry turned and saw the earnest look on her face. Recently he’d begun to realise the pattern in Malfoy’s behaviour. When they were kids, Malfoy had been snotty and snarky to impress, because being quick and intelligent made her stand out. Now that they were older, it seemed to Harry that this had become a defence – that when she didn’t trust her own opinion, or didn’t feel valued, she could fall back on that shell of meanness and quick wit. It didn’t excuse it, but Harry understood it. And he was determined to put a stop to it.
It was strange not seeing Granger go. She would have to go beyond the property boundary to apparate to the employee entrance of the Ministry since they didn’t want to be traced directly to the Manor. Years ago, the unplottable nature of the Manor would have negated this, but since the floo was now regulated under his house arrest restrictions, they were having to make do. Pansy went with Granger, but Draco stayed behind.
‘What.’ He watched as Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. He reserved making any judgements until he’d given Harry the opportunity to explain himself.
‘They do still like you. You didn’t do anything wrong. Sometimes grown-ups have important things to do. They had to go away, and they know how much you love your friends and they didn’t want you to miss them.’ Her wispy little eyebrows furrowed, and her lips thinned.
He was almost worried that he hadn’t heard from Harry. He shouldn’t be, since that was the entire reason for his move, but considering Harry’s previous behaviour it seemed odd. He’d already barged his way into Draco’s home on multiple occasions over issues much more minor than this. Had Harry really not noticed Draco’s departure? He found that unlikely, especially after the mess they’d made after their stupid night out. He still couldn’t quite believe he’d actually slept with Harry again. He had to admit, he was almost disappointed that he didn’t remember any of it. He couldn’t deny Harry had always been a damn good shag, even if he was pants at most other things.
“Hey…” he whispered into the darkness. Immediately the fox was quiet, regarding Harry carefully. It slowly crept back to the bed Harry had made as if it knew what Harry expected it to do.
It probably didn’t help that it was another Asian cuisine restaurant – Chinese this time. The waiter who handed them menus looked like Marlon Brando’s grandson, so much that Draco almost did a double take before remembering that Marlon Brando was a muggle and, if he were still alive, would by 94 by now.
“Ok… I think. Better than earlier.” He rubbed the back of his neck for something to do with his hands.
Draco glared at Harry even though it wasn’t really his fault. Harry said nothing but smirked at him arrogantly, the bastard.
‘The rest of the day is ours, what do you say we do?’ Draco considered it for a moment until he had a brainwave.
so he did, and the screen came to life. He tapped the funny looking button with the red number one on it and found the message.
‘Right. The thing is, the Wizengamot pretended I had stomach flu but actually, I had...’ He paused, feeling like once he said it Harry would never look at him the same way again.
‘Ted?’ He shouted up the stairs when he arrived home. He didn’t have to energy to go up to check on him.
“Come here,” Harry says in the gentlest voice he can muster. There’s a pause while Draco acknowledges the change in tone. It’s easy to see the emotions flit across his face now that Harry is attuned to him. Mainly he can see that he’s trying to hold onto his anger towards Harry, but that anger is fighting against his need for reassurance, which he also gets from Harry.
‘Well, in that case, carry on.’ So, Draco did kiss him. Only quickly however, since Gabriel was introducing them to his head pastry chef and Draco was determined not to let this opportunity pass him by.
The tiredness was going to be difficult to overcome if he was going to try it, but Granger was right, he had to keep trying.
“It’s a he?” It hadn’t even occurred to Harry, but he realised with a jolt that he had been referring to his fox as ‘it’, and he was probably quite offended. Like it-
‘Not exactly. I found this in an old book of pureblood marital relations.’ She pointed to a particular passage in the large book on the table. ‘It says when the first divorce law was introduced in England in the nineteenth century, pureblood marriage ceremonies were amended so that when the vows were exchanged, you each gave a small piece of your magic to each other. A kind of…insurance policy. So, when you divorced, that pocket of magic was lost. It won’t have made a big difference to Harry, but you Draco, you already had a small amount of dark magic in your system from the mark.’
He paused before tipping the memory into the pensieve. He had a gut wrenching feeling that if he viewed this memory now, so long after it happened, his entire view of his marriage would change. He wasn’t sure he was willing to admit the blame. He couldn’t deny any longer that he still loved Harry. Hell, he was as in love with him now as he had ever been, but that couldn’t change what had broken between them. Could he ever forgive himself if it really was his own fault? Could he ever look at Harry again knowing what he did to him, to them?
‘Please don’t go back to France. I know you’re too sick to travel right now but I mean, when you’re better. I love this house, but it isn’t the same without you. It’s not a home. I need you. Teddy needs you.’ He couldn’t speak, he was too choked up. He nodded his head as best he could although he was still unbearable stiff. Harry didn’t seem to mind – he dived in for another kiss and Draco couldn’t believe he was really here. They spent a few minutes simply laying there, enjoying each other’s company. Draco knew eventually they’d have to talk it out, much more than they had. He also knew that his road to recovery was probably a lot more complex than the healer had made it out to be, but somehow, he couldn’t bring himself to ruin this feeling of being with Harry again. After a while, he decided he should probably tell Harry what he’d seen.
When they finally did return home, Draco didn’t want to have a conversation about Ella. He didn’t want to look like a fool for thinking they were up for it, and he didn’t want Harry to change his mind. He darted off to their bedroom, hoping his wand was discarded somewhere within instead of lost in the abyss.
It was then that he realised that he hadn’t seen his friends since the day he had come back from the Ministry. There had been no word from Blaise or Theo or Greg. Maybe Pansy had kept them informed on his behalf, but then she had been so preoccupied by Granger…
‘Yeah, yeah, you’re my favourite sausage. Now you have to let me go. I’ll be back later I promise.’ He gave the two little monkeys one last squeeze and let them go.
“What does it matter? There are plenty of things you don’t know about me.” The fox started crying at them because he was no longer centre of attention. Harry automatically stroked between his ears and he quietened.
“hoc caduceo, iunctionem creo.” The wand lifted into the air and twirled with a sea of purple sparks before landing back down on the ground before them. He looked anxiously to Granger. She shrugged and it didn’t instil him with confidence.
“I’m taking you to meet a very special friend today,” Harry said to Aspen. He had developed a habit of talking to the fox like a human. Malfoy mocked him for it, especially since Luna claimed he was a non-magical fox, but Harry still firmly believed he understood everything Harry said.
He was busy contemplating the abstract art on the wall – he couldn’t decide if it represented a pile of shit or a pile of rocks when the stupid phone snapped shut. Harry came storming over and Draco almost cowered until he remembered it was Harry and Draco hadn’t done a thing.
That only seemed to upset her further. “You can’t expect the Wizengamot to be reasonable with you.” She held up a hand to silence him when he opened his mouth to interrupt. “No, I’m not saying this will go that far, all I’m saying is that if it
‘Scourgify.’ Ella watched with fascination as the scribble lifted off the page, leaving her half-completed puzzle behind. She blinked away the tears that were weighing heavy on her eyelashes.
‘It isn’t about me Harry and you know it. You made me look stupid. Here I’ve been thinking we’re giving this another go, trying to move on, and the whole time everyone has known about your stupid fling with Wood of all people. Oliver Wood, Harry. The guy’s a creep. He didn’t even know about me.’
Whilst he was shampooing his hair, Harry walked into the bathroom. Draco wasn’t impressed that Harry didn’t have boundaries, but he supposed that was the joy of marriage. Well, they weren’t technically married anymore. A spike of anxiety hit him as he was reminded of how unstable everything was yet again. He didn’t know these people who didn’t believe in marriage – for him it was that ultimate safety blanket, a reminder that Harry would always be there even when Draco wasn’t the easiest person to live with. A safety blanket that was no longer there.
They opened presents from Ron and Hermione – i.e. Hermione, who got Teddy a book on Herbology. They were going to see them at Christmas lunch of course, but Hermione had the foresight to know that if they all exchanged presents at The Burrow, they’d probably drown in gift wrap. When they were done, Draco glanced at his watch.
“Aren’t you going to read me my rights?” It was hard for him to keep his chin up, his head feeling as heavy as a bludger, but he couldn’t help trying to maintain his dignity for a little while longer.
And if when they got home they made the most of Teddy staying at Ron and Hermione’s for the night…well, gentlemen don’t kiss and tell.
The first present he chose was a photo album Draco had put together with Harry. Really, he should have had it when he went to Hogwarts, but it had completely slipped Draco’s mind at the time. The album included a selection of photos from when Teddy was a baby until now, including the few that remained of Teddy with Remus and Tonks. It would be something to look at if he ever got homesick at school. Teddy didn’t say much as he flicked through the pages. After a few minutes he looked up at Harry with shiny eyes and although he didn’t say anything, Draco could tell they’d done well with that one.
With much less trepidation than he’d had the first time he’d viewed this particular memory, he delved in.
‘I get it Harry, I really do. It’s just…I can’t do this. I know we have Ted, and he means a lot to me, but we’re done Harry. We need to move on.’ He hated saying it, but it was true. They couldn’t tiptoe around each other forever.
‘Were you talking to someone? I heard voices.’ She looked around as if expecting someone to jump out from behind the armoire.
‘I wouldn’t worry about it right now,’ the mediwitch told him, still smiling at him kindly, ‘I’m afraid this is probably going to knock you out again. It doesn’t enjoy being mixed with your usual medications.’ She handed him the tincture and he downed it, wincing at the horrible taste. Within a few seconds he felt it crawling through his veins like icy water. ‘I’m so glad you’re awake, you should make a quicker recovery now that I’ve been able to administer the dosage this way. Honestly, the ointment isn’t nearly so effective. I’ll leave you two to say your goodbyes before Mr Potter falls asleep again.’ The mediwitch bustled off to her next patient and Draco felt good, even if everything had just gotten a whole lot more complicated than it had been before.
Harry smiled. ‘I suppose we are.’ One of the tears trickling down Harry’s face collected at the corner of his mouth and Draco swiped his thumb across his bottom lip as he caught it. He was about to lean in to kiss him when Harry jerked backwards as though he’d been struck by lightning.
‘Masters Potter, sirs. Spungen is very pleasing to see you. Master Draco is being required these.’ He handed two potions over which Harry gripped clumsily in his free hand. ‘Spungen be unpacking masters’ belongings now sirs.’ Draco indicated to the left to tell Harry to take him through to the nearest sitting room. The chateau appeared to be spotless, unlike the last time Draco had made the journey. Harry helped him onto one of the few
‘Of course they don’t call it MAMF. They’re French, they have standards.’ He took him to a room he’d had to fight Spungen on – he shouldn’t have really, since Spungen had to take orders directly from him. It was done out like a muggle cinema, loosely, considering Draco had only been to one once.
‘Would you mind casting some warming charms? It takes a few minutes to get there and I left the coats upstairs.’
“I was worried… we all were. You looked awful, even worse than that time at the Ministry.” Ron grimaced at whatever memory had surfaced, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure what he was talking about. He opened his mouth to ask but at that moment Remus placed a steaming cup of tea down in front of him.
“Of course, it’s written in the passive as you can see by the -ris which makes it slightly complicated since it’s not an active curse but there must be a work around. Since sole is in the ablative it suggests that it’s the sun being repelled, which makes the victim the repellent. Very important of course when considering the nature of a counter-curse…” Harry has literally no idea what Malfoy is talking about but it sounds amazing.
‘I miss you. I’m sorry I don’t visit very often. I didn’t even bring you flowers.’ He’d usually conjure some when he got here but once again, he’d forgotten he couldn’t do that. ‘I often wonder if you’d be happy with the things I’ve done since the war, or if you’d think I’d sold myself out. You were never quite so harsh as father. I like to think you’d understand.’
“It was useful that it brought you to me.” Harry sighed. Why was he the only person who seemed to think something wasn’t right? “Don’t feel bad about it, Harry, it’s important to trust your instincts. If you say something is special about the fox, then I believe you.” Harry nodded, feeling choked that he had someone like Sirius in his life. Aspen, although calm, was now wary of Sirius, so Harry got up and let him out into the garden, hoping he didn’t run off and get lost.
‘He invited you. To our house. His house. His.’ Draco corrected himself, but it was too late. Pansy gave him one of her most piercing looks and Draco felt like she was looking at his soul.
Draco made a dreamy kind of face as if he could taste it just by Harry mentioning it. “Ugh. That paella was so good. You’re too good to me you know.”
‘Shit!’ He jumped back with the force of it and immediately the temperature dropped to a more manageable level.
Harry was floored by this information. Malfoy had gone to a muggle university, which meant a minimum of three years, and Harry hadn’t known?
‘Yeah, they get a bit excited when they’ve got Teddy to play with. Different company and all,’ she said as she adjusted her grip on Hugo. ‘It was a really beautiful party. You did well on this one.’ She shot a subtle look Draco’s way and he pretended to be watching Teddy sleeping.
He didn’t want to move even after the film had ended. He was incredibly comfortable snuggled under the blankets with Harry. He always felt better when he had the warm weight of him there. He hadn’t noticed when he’d started playing with Harry’s hair but that was pretty much inevitable. He was about to fall asleep when Harry shifted and disturbed him. He looked over at him to find him already staring at him. Even in the dim light his eyes shone like beacons. His hair was messed on one side where he’s been pressed against Draco and it was adorable.
He went up into the loft and searched around for a familiar looking red box which housed all of their Christmas decorations. He was surprised to find it in a far corner, covered in a thick layer of dust. It was odd, because every year Draco cast protective spells over it whenever the decorations had been taken down again to make sure it didn’t get damaged by dust mites and the like. He’d always studiously avoided the house around Christmas time following the divorce, not wanting to be reminded of the festive cheer he wouldn’t be part of.
‘Hm. You’re still a git but…you’re my git.’ It was difficult to get his head around, but he had to try. For all their sakes. Harry pulled him in for another kiss and Draco could feel him smiling against his lips. Even after they pulled away, they stood in each other’s arms just for the sake of being close to each other.
Draco fumbled around in his wardrobe and pulled out a random white shirt and some jeans. Why was it that all of Draco’s casual clothes were ones Harry had bought him? He must look so pathetic constantly showing up in clothes he wasn’t even capable of buying for himself. He’d grown up always being forced to wear the height of wizarding fashion at all times. He was proud of his heritage, not so much the dark arts, but he was proud of being one of the few remaining descendants of the Black family, and the only remaining descendent of the Malfoy family. Which actually probably didn’t even exist anymore considering he was actually a Potter. Either way, casual clothing had never been his strong suit. It worked well really; Harry bought him casual muggle clothes, and Draco bought Harry formal wizard robes. It was a great system.
Granger stood there grinning at him. It was horribly disconcerting because they most certainly couldn’t be getting along.
‘If you weren’t lying to me and hiding things from me, maybe I wouldn’t have to resort to desperate measures.’ Harry growled. Anxiety crept up Draco’s spine and sat heavily on his shoulders.
He didn’t want to see the weather jar run out when there was no one there to enjoy it, so he located the lid under a pile of books and screwed it back on. By the time he had done so she had disappeared. He found her again in the kitchen, standing near a hardback book open somewhere near the middle, a thin wooden bookmark with an owl on it sticking up where it was wedged between pages.
‘You really didn’t listen when I told you about Dubai, did you? I was Regional Manager for the UWICEF Gulf Area Office.’ Draco supposed he was expected to understand the significance of that, but he didn’t. He knew what UWICEF was of course – the United Wizards International Children’s Emergency Fund. It had been a favourite charity of his mother’s.
Malfoy leant forward even further and gripped Harry’s forearm across the table. Harry’s eyes widened at the unexpected contact. Malfoy's hands were icy cold but his palm felt surprisingly smooth against Harry’s skin for someone who had played a lot of Quidditch at school.
Draco went through these thoughts every time an article ran about Potter, which was frequently. Investigations had been going on ever since Potter had disappeared and it was only a matter of time before someone connected the dots and realised Draco was one of the last people to see him. It wasn’t possible for Draco to know exactly when Potter went to the DoM, but it can’t have been long after they spoke. The pictures taken of them had never surfaced and it was both a blessing and a curse. Out there in the open Draco would immediately have been under suspicion and probably would have been flung in Azkaban for the privilege, but knowing those images were being kept quiet only meant living in fear.
‘I can’t believe you just apparated me to the middle of Paris without even thinking twice! That was a stupid thing to do!’ He swatted Harry’s arm but wasn’t really all that annoyed since he was unbelievably excited.
Adjusting to life with a fox was much harder than Harry had anticipated. Although he regularly checked in with Luna, who was doing an amazing job of teaching Harry how to look after Aspen and making sure he was healthy, there was only so much she could do.
‘I have to leave because I’m still in love with him.’ He said bluntly. Hermione’s eyes widened, and she leant forwards on her elbows. ‘I’m still in love with him but I don’t see us ever managing to make it work and I want to move far away where I can find someone who’ll love me without all of this messy history. Is that a good enough answer for you?’
‘You can’t have him. I won’t let you.’ He’d been forced down a path he didn’t want too many times to let it happen again. Harry was one of the rays of sunshine in his life and he wasn’t going to let anyone take that away from him.
‘You treat me so well,’ he teased. Harry came to sit next to him, having popped the DVD into the drive.
‘Maybe we can meet to discuss it? I’m open to helping but I am currently employed, and I need to know more before I can commit to anything.’
The man in his dream looked just like Lyra. Same hair colour, same eye colour, same cupid’s bow lip, same pointed chin and sharp jaw. Harry’s head spun as pictures flickered across his vision. Standing in Madam Malkin’s on a platform with a snobby little boy blabbering away about Hogwarts houses while Madam Malkin was poking him with pins. Him following the same boy, now almost a man, all the way to the girls’ bathroom where he found him crying, minutes later blood pouring all over the floor and Harry’s stomach lurching in fear and guilt. The man looking him in the eye as similar looking people, presumably his parents, watched on with anxious looks on their faces: “I can’t- I can’t be sure”.
He’d taken too long to watch her, and a spell caught his ear. It stung but he tried to ignore it, scanning his surroundings for a way out. His heart hammered inside his ribcage and he was losing his grip on Potter’s wand. He ducked to avoid a spell aimed at his head but moved right into the path of another instead. It hit him square on the chest and that’s when everything changed.
“That’s ok, cars have wipers. If you turn that stick there-” Harry pointed to a lever at the side of the steering wheel, “yeah, that one…”
‘I know,’ he said quietly. Thankfully at that moment Teddy’s attention was diverted by the reindeer shaped baubles and darted off. Draco nodded and smiled as Teddy showed him row after row of unique ornaments from glass snowflakes to perspex spheres you could insert your own photo into to hang on the tree. He wasn’t really paying as much attention as he should be though as he continued to think about Harry’s Christmas present. He was seriously running out of time. His gaze wandered away from Teddy and he saw a couple picking out a nativity set. He was nearly blinded when the woman’s ring caught the light and flashed in his eye as she turned to show her partner whatever it was that had caught her eye. He remembered the first time he and Harry had bought their own Christmas decorations – it was novel for Draco since his own family had never celebrated Christmas – besides at Hogwarts.
‘Harry, it’s ok.’ He said, his thumb stroking gently over the back of Harry’s knuckles. ‘We’ll figure it out. It’s not your responsibility to fix this on your own, we can figure this out together and no one else needs to get hurt, ok?’ Draco knew how overwrought Harry got when he felt like he wasn’t solving his cases quick enough. Draco had done a lot to help Harry’s saviour complex and Harry was able to control some of his compulsions a lot better than before. Still, it was a part of him and Draco couldn’t help but admire Harry’s selfless dedication.
He spent the first week getting accustomed to the history of the case and visiting the patients in St Mungo’s. Even in the time that had passed between Kingsley’s offer and Draco’s acceptance, there had been no change in the patients’ status. The healers were having to replace their stasis charms every couple of hours and time was running out.
“My mother was particularly skilled at it, but I learned most of what I know now at university. I took an entire degree in it actually. It was rather fun.”
Draco wanted the ground to swallow him whole as he saw the woman flirt hopelessly with Harry. She looked remarkably like a female version of Draco. Long blonde platinum hair, tall, slim. Harry couldn’t get more obvious than that. Still, it made Draco’s skin crawl. He knew hanging around after the divorce wouldn’t be a good thing for him. He saw reminders of Harry everywhere; a new broomstick advert, a new Twilfitt and Tattings formal robe advert. Draco had stopped going to Diagon a few months after he’d moved out – desperate not to see Harry’s face everywhere he went.
‘Master Draco, Spungen is being glad you is well.’ He could tell the elf was ready to start fawning all over him, but he put a stop to it quickly.
“It’s ok, just don’t move.” He held his hand up, palm facing her. The bottle reformed with a gentle wave of his wand, the droplets of dittany merging and pouring back into the tinted glass. When he was satisfied that he wouldn’t pierce the soles of his bare feet with shards of glass, he went to her, taking her hand for stability and dabbing the dittany onto her skin himself. He was halfway up her arm before he noticed that she was standing unnaturally still.
‘Draco, love, calm down. It’s ok – I think this is amazing. You really put everything into this didn’t you?’ Harry continued to flip through the messy pages each turn of the page punctuated by a pursed lip or a raised eyebrow. Eventually he looked up at Draco and he thought maybe he looked proud of him, although with Harry it was sometimes hard to tell.
‘Excuse me.’ Harry followed him out of the room and into a narrow corridor which, if this place was in anyway similar to Malfoy Manor, was the old service corridors leading from the kitchens below to the main dining room. Harry seemed to know Draco wanted to say something important, and he absently waved a hand and erected a series of privacy charms. Draco didn’t think he’d ever get used to how powerful he was. Magic for him was as easy as breathing.
‘Look. Harry. I’m not going to sit here while you throw shade at me and complain. If we’re going to talk then fine, but I can’t do it right now. I need to get home and-’
‘Hello lovelies! Perfect weather for tinglinger fishing huh?’ Draco simply nodded and hugged her. He knew better than to question Luna by now.
He was also mildly annoyed that Granger hadn’t sat on Pansy’s side of the table. It was a subtle thing, but now wasn’t the time to draw sides.
A distant rumbling came from below. It throbbed against the back of his head where it had made contact with the floor. There was a commotion of some sort, but it didn’t seem to bother him. It was getting louder, stronger, with each passing second but his gaze didn’t leave Lyra’s face. The mildly sadistic thought that he enjoyed her being worried about him crossed his mind before the door burst open and he realised the thumping had been the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs.
‘Would you pass me the pile of mail, love? I forgot to open it this morning.’ Draco levitated the small stack of letters over as he was waiting for the milk to heat. They exchanged huge grins at Draco’s easy display of magic. He knew, despite having lost his magic for less than a year of his life, that he would never take it for granted again. The letters landed neatly on the table in front of Harry, who scanned the envelopes. He always tried to guess which letter would be the most important and opened it first. Most of the time he was hopelessly wrong, but it made Draco laugh anyway.
‘What kind of dream?’ Draco stopped to smell a rose bush. He’d always loved the smell of roses, even if it was incredibly cliché. He stepped away and took a deep breath of the fresh air. It was earthy and clean, and he felt himself unwind. He had never been a massively outdoorsy person, but he did love gardens. Ever since he was a child and he’d spent time in the Manor gardens avoiding his father… ‘Draco?’ Harry prompted. He shook his head slightly.
‘Ok!’ Teddy bounded off towards Quality Quidditch Supplies, dragging Draco along behind him. This shop was less packed than the street when they stepped inside, setting off the bell above the door, many people couldn’t afford the luxury of a broomstick after the war. Draco supposed it was taking a while for business to pick up again.
“Nothing? Nothing at all? No… I don’t know, pulling sensation? What happens when you touch the wand?” Draco reached out and picked up Potter’s wand. A flare of warmth shot up his hand, but it didn’t go beyond his wrist. It was the same kind of feeling he had when he picked up his own wand.
‘I’m sorry? I’m afraid I don’t understand ba-” He breaks off as he follows Harry’s gaze towards his arms. It confuses Harry when he starts scrabbling to unfold the sleeves he’s just rolled to his elbows, until he realises that Malfoy thinks he’s staring at something else entirely. In seconds he has crossed the room and grabbed hold of Malfoy’s left forearm.
The scents of cedar and grapefruit assaulted Draco’s senses again and left him feeling dizzy. His grip on the front of Harry’s robes tightened and Harry let out a strangled kind of whine as he was pulled even closer to Draco’s chest. Draco never wanted the feeling of Harry’s lips moving against his own to stop, and he especially didn’t want to have to confront whatever it was he thought he was doing, but he was quickly running out of air. Eventually he was forced to pull away, the both of them flushed and panting slightly.
Granger rushed past him and went directly to the bookcases which lined the wall. In another time Draco would have blown his lid at her presumptuousness, but she meant well so he let it slide.
“It used to,” Sirius admitted, “but now I think it’s for the best. The era of my family and it’s ignorant values is over, maybe it’s best they go with it.” There was that same look on his face that there was when Harry had mentioned Remus to him; a kind of wistfulness tinged with sorrow. Harry didn’t like to see him that way. The image of the man in the arch who looked just like Lyra surfaced again and his stomach swooped.
‘It’s just school, it’s not a big deal,’ Teddy frowned. There was no way for them to explain the impact of him leaving home, some things he just wouldn’t understand until he was a parent himself. If he was a parent. Draco wasn’t about to start putting those kinds of pressures on him. ‘How serious though? Did Daddy nearly die again?’ His face was horror-stricken. This wasn’t why they’d brought him home for a couple of days.
Was that what Wood had been about to say? That he didn’t know Harry and Draco were together because he and Harry...what? Hung out? Dated? Kissed? Slept together? Had Harry been sneaking off with Wood this whole time? Was that what that phone call had been? He felt the age-old panic rise in his chest, and he knew he had to calm down. He paced the flat anxiously.
Smith had a point though. Draco would be beside himself if he knew Harry was hurt and he didn’t know what to do about it. He would be angry if Harry had been getting sick and not telling him.
‘I know darling, I know. But she has us, doesn’t she? And we can be there for her even if they can’t. Would I be a terrible person if I said I’m relieved? I’m not ready to say goodbye to her.’ Harry pulled away from him and gave him an odd look that Draco couldn’t place.
‘He’s been up since five,’ the matron, Susan, said quietly from behind him. Draco nodded conspiratorially.
‘Why did you ask us here Hermione?’ She positively lit up with excitement at the prospect of being able to talk about something Draco presumed she had been researching.
‘As soon as I took it I started looking for other opportunities. It turns out whilst there are a lot of places are dying to have
His heart nearly stopped mid-beat when his eyes landed on a new face and a new name. Same eyes, same hair colour, same pointed features, just as he had expected. The name beneath the face read
“Oh! I forgot to mention that Lyra is staying with me for a while. She’s having some renovations done but I’m sure you’d know all about that.” Luna said lightly. Harry didn’t have a clue about any renovations, and he was sure he would’ve been the last to know even if he was party to such things. It did at least explain why Malfoy had been wearing Luna-style clothes the night before.
“Huh? Oh. Latin scripts use a lot of abbreviations. Writing materials were rare and expensive so they often tried to use as little space as possible. There are a finite number of ending so they used to abbreviate them with single letters in superscript at the end, see there?” He points to a tiny ‘m’ at the end of one of the lines. Harry nods but Malfoy isn’t even looking.
Draco wished the floor would swallow him whole. Of course, he had told himself all along that Potter had gone through the Veil as he said he would, but somewhere in the back of his mind he held onto the hope that he hadn’t. That he’d listened to what Draco had said and come up with another plan. Because if Potter really had stepped through, which it appeared that he had, there was no way of knowing if he even still existed.
He was about to forget all about Potter and continue his chat with his mother, when someone approached Potter from behind and snapped him back to reality. Draco watched as his previously serious face lit up when he clapped eyes on the man who’s face Draco recognised but name he couldn’t place. The two men embraced, and Potter’s companion kissed his cheek. Draco watched as Potter flushed adorably and he could kick himself for finding it so damn sweet. He was, however, getting more and more frustrated by the fact that he couldn’t figure out who Potter was meeting.
He took a seat between Millicent, who had brought her cat with her for who knew what reason, and Pansy, who was looking at him like he was a terminal dragon pox patient.
‘Really? He never mentioned he was dating anyone. Although, I’m so busy these days with being the department head and the kids are a total handful and- oh no, what if he thinks he can’t tell us these things anymore?’ Draco stared at her.
He went back to Regulus’ room, but Lyra wasn’t there. She must have gone downstairs, so he decided to find some clothes and join her. Aspen started screaming at him the moment he entered the room, but he didn’t want to give him any attention. He’d decided to be needy at the most inopportune moment and Harry needed focus so he could figure out what he wanted to do next. Tell Lyra everything is what he should do, what he had tried to do, but he wondered if the moment had passed. Even if it hadn’t, there would be people downstairs besides Lyra and he wasn’t sure he wanted to announce to half the people he knew that he was slowly losing his marbles.
‘No! No, no! None of them were touched. I covered them in a bubble charm first. Actually, why didn’t I do that with everything else? That would’ve been the sensible thing to do.’ Draco let his head fall into his hands, his breakfast now abandoned.
Despite everything, the letter made him smile. There was someone on the other side who knew he was here and who cared enough to write. He was about to pick up the item she’d included, presumably the thing that had made the envelope so heavy, when a cold descended over the room. Draco was struck with the distinct and horrifying feeling that he would never be happy again in his life. The cold dread seeped through his skin and down into his bones and he wanted desperately to be anywhere but there. Quickly, he shoved the letter out of his way under the ‘pillow’ – nothing more than a bunch up old woollen blanket worn thin in parts – that rested on the bare ground.
‘We made mistakes Harry. We were young and stupid and we both thought we knew best.’ Draco was done blaming either one of them for what went wrong, he was finally ready to move on with his life.
“Yes. He barged in here quite like he owned the place.” Came a drawling voice from behind a particularly thick patch of tangled vines and leaves. Harry startled and, stepping further into the room, realised that there had been another person there the whole time he had been idly observing the plants.
‘Ah, yes. I do apologise for springing that on you. Head Auror Potter will of course be handling a case as sensitive as this. You’ll understand I’m sure.’ Of course. Draco was stupid, at the very least naïve, to think that he could do this without seeing Harry. Personal issues aside, Harry was excellent at his job and there’s no way he wouldn’t be involved in a case which the Minister was also dealing with personally. Draco could only hope that he’d be spending time in a lab and far away from Harry.
He decided he’d make the trip over, without the letting agent, so he could see the place more objectively, imagine what it might be like to approach as a customer rather than an owner. He didn’t make it far however, since the heavens opened and forced Draco back inside. He could do that another day he supposed – it wasn’t worth wading through such heavy rain. Instead, he spent most of the day tuck up under a blanket with a book he’d bought at said bookshop. He knew he would have to go out to the chateau later, so he figured he may as well let this trip slide in the hopes the rain would clear later.
‘Well then all I have to do is give my magic back again and then he’s better, right?’ Of course, that was where Harry’s mind went first. Forever the hero.
There was a high-pitched noise ringing in Draco’s ears and the white blurriness was back. This time, when he blinked, the world came into focus a little better. He looked around him, but it didn’t seem as though he was in the same ward as he had been the last time he was here. Or at least, he didn’t recognise anything. He was relieved to find he hadn’t woken up alone – there was a bored looking Pansy flicking through the over-glossy pages of a magazine, sitting on his right side.
“I know, but I think it’s the not knowing that’s upsetting her the most. It’s one thing to let us go without her, it’s another that we can’t even tell her why we’re going or how long we might be gone.” He could absolutely see her point.
‘May I…’ He handed it over to Harry who flicked it quickly and levitated his pen from the desk surface. ‘I just wanted to check it still worked. Not that it wouldn’t but, I didn’t know if you were avoiding it for a reason.’ He twirled the wand in his fingers like it belonged there. ‘It’s funny how once you’ve mastered a wand it’s always familiar to you. I wish I’d asked Ollivander more about wandwork when I had the chance.’
‘What did your mind healer say when you told him about this? I thought you said you were supposed to see him every week…?’ Draco watched as Harry shrank their luggage and sent it on ahead. He was less envious of Harry’s magic now that he knew his own was still there lurking, but it did make him frustrated to know he was equally as capable of doing everything yet didn’t know how.
‘Anyway, after you left I started to feel like I wasn’t actually doing any good out there. I’d come home from work feeling like something was missing. Completing cases didn’t have the same satisfaction anymore. Hermione suggested writing in a journal, but I couldn’t keep it up. One day when I was out for beers with the guys, Dean was talking about an old manor house that was going up for sale in a muggle auction. He was complaining about how whoever bought it would probably tear it down and it was such a waste of the architecture or something. I don’t know, all that stuff is more your thing.’ Draco didn’t know what to say, so he tried to keep his mouth shut.
That Friday, Draco was nearly bowled over when he arrived at his Aunt Andromeda’s by a blur of bright turquoise.
‘I see your point, and absolutely that makes sense, but it doesn’t explain why none of the patients have been to the clinic within a week of their symptoms. In fact, the young girl hasn’t been a patient at this clinic at all.’ Draco explained. He got the feeling he was missing something.
“It doesn’t specify…” She turned the page over and then back again, “anywhere.” They stood there in silence for a while. Draco felt like an ominous cloud had opened above his head and released a deluge of rain over him. Even if this experiment had been successful, which was improbable, even if they could replicate it, which was unlikely, there was no guarantee there was anything to connect to.
‘What about you though? He’s watching out for you, isn’t he? And don’t have a go, I know you’re fully capable of looking after yourself, but mate, you nearly died. You might be decent now but honestly if that had happened when we were at school…I’d have had a great time taking the absolute piss. A Malfoy of all people without magic…’ Draco laughed a quite raucous laugh, very unusual for him, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Harry’s head turn in his direction.
” This was the final step towards becoming an animagus. He had come so close to finding his animal form and this was finally it.
“I- uh, well, it must have been-” the tips of Ron’s ears were vermillion, a total contrast to the greyish tinge on his cheeks. Harry turned to Sirius and Remus who both looked worried.
“Good. Really good, actually. Sometimes makes me wonder if he-” Ron wasn’t able to finish for his voice cracking.
‘Hermione, what do you want me to say? It’s been three years and I’m not any better than I was. I need to get out of here, I need to not see him around every week, I need space to figure out who I am without him.’ He knew it was cowardly. A better man than him would just come right out and say that he was still in love with Harry Potter and seeing his face made him want to tear his hair out and cry.
“Pans, you know I love you, but we’re only going to the Ministry. I’m not setting sail for Antarctica.”
Malfoy looked at him unblinkingly. To him it felt as though the rest of the room was swept away and he was sucked into a vacuum. He hadn’t had any alcohol, but his head was spinning as if he had been drinking for hours. He silently willed her to look away so that he could go back to breathing properly again, and so that his heart wouldn’t beat right out of his chest, but she seemed as locked in the exchange as he was. It was Harry who blinked first and instantaneously the spell was broken. Noise flooded back into his ears like a swarm of bees, drowning out his own thoughts and leaving him disorientated.
‘What.’ He said breathlessly, but Draco couldn’t answer him. He was already desperately trying to get air into his lungs, but he couldn’t remember what to do. He gaped at Harry who was looking at him worriedly. ‘Draco? What’s going on?’ Draco scrabbled for the vial on the counter although it was probably useless by now. His lungs were screaming for air, but he couldn’t make them work. What was breathing again? Panic was clawing at the inside of his empty chest like a white-hot poker.
“You must be mad! We can’t keep a fox in here!” A fox. Surprising. Draco hadn’t been able to ascertain his animagus form, not having had an opportunity to see his reflection or transform in a context where someone could inform him, but funnily enough a fox seemed to fit.
‘Honestly you two are as bad as each other. How’s anything supposed to work if you don’t talk to each other?’ Draco opened his mouth to respond when a cloud of noise permeated the atmosphere and he realised the rest of the hoard had descended.
Draco wasn’t impressed with this kid’s lack of punctuation or grammar. He sighed. It was ironic that a Slytherin of all people would be attacking Draco’s past. He’d expected they’d either glorify the war or pretend it never happened. It made him angry though. Not because some stupid eleven-year-old was shit talking, but that he thought he could use it against Teddy. What happened between Draco and Harry had nothing to do with him.
‘You’re not going to die, are you?’ Teddy asked him, climbing up onto the window seat. There wasn’t quite enough space for the both of them, so Draco pulled his knees up to his chest. Teddy seemed to be over his strange cuddling turn.
‘Would you do the honours?’ Draco balanced Ella on his hip as best he could – he wasn’t quite strong enough to lift a five-year-old anymore – and linked arms with Harry. ‘This might make you feel a bit funny sweetheart, but I promise it won’t last long.’ He wasn’t sure apparating with her was the best idea but since it was Boxing Day the floo at their destination would be offline.
‘He can’t tell her she can’t do it just because she’s a girl!’ She said like Draco was stupid. He couldn’t help it, he tipped his head back and laughed loudly.
It was then that Draco drew back. “Not here,” he said, “not like this.” He was panting for breath and Harry could only nod in agreement, unable to form words at all. Draco’s head dropped and their foreheads pressed together. Harry closed his eyes and marvellous at the pure luxury of being allowed to touch Draco like that. Of being the person allowed past his walls.
‘It’s not so weird now. I missed you guys a lot last term. Am I going to come home every time Daddy is sick? Is he going to keep getting sick?’ Some of Teddy’s enthusiasm bled away. It seemed he’d half-forgotten why he was home.
‘Go back where? Where am I?’ How was he supposed to choose when he didn’t know what he was choosing?
‘You can do this. I’ll be right here.’ There was no one else in the room, but Draco appreciated Harry’s care to keep quiet. You never knew where an extendable ear might be hiding when in the company of Weasleys.
“Quite right. Let me find you a room Remus, you can’t be going home now. You too Lyra, you’re welcome to stay in your usual room.” Sirius stood and the atmosphere broke. Harry suddenly felt bone tired as if getting everything off his chest had taken the last of his energy with it.
‘I nearly did. But no, I didn’t.’ He nodded and gingerly took a seat as close to the opposite edge of the sofa as he dared.
‘Come on then, Ted. What do you want to do first?’ Draco asked him as they headed through to the living room to use Harry’s floo.
He jumped when something cold was pressed against his forehead and a glass of water was pushed into his hand. He gulped it down and sighed with relief when the world stopped spinning.
“Good. You will be escorted to a cell where you will be held pending questioning. You have the right to seek legal representation. If you cannot provide your own, legal counsel will be provided for you. You are entitled to one floo call which someone will be sent to your holding cell to arrange. Is there anything you wish to say? I must advise you that you do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.” She said it with a flat tone that suggested she said the same thing a hundred times a day. It occurred to Draco that all of this was being done in a crazy backwards order, which suggested they were particularly bothered about treating him properly.
Draco would remain stubborn until his dying breath. ‘Of course.’ Harry rolled his eyes, but his smile stayed in place. Gabriel led them through to the back of the shop, although Draco still had a few seconds to eye the display cabinets. The vast array of baked goods from brightly coloured macarons to elegant petit fours to heart-warming tarte tatin.
‘Actually,’ Harry cut in, ‘my colleagues came across an abandoned potions lab yesterday which they think may be connected in some way. I’m pushing to get the paperwork through quickly so that we can scope the place out.’
‘I wouldn’t dream of blowing off my hot date!’ He joked. He really had been feeling much better since he’d had his little chat with Kingsley and he figured humour would work as a good distraction from the conversation he didn’t really want to have.
, you have to be prepared that they won’t be fair. The Ministry’s reputation has taken a serious knock and allowing a former Death Eater to walk free when there’s even the slightest suggestion of involvement will reflect badly on them.”
During the first month of his agreement with Hermione, Draco searched for apartments and jobs near Paris. Not in Paris, because there’s no way he’d be able to afford to live in Paris, but close enough that he could have an inter-city floo connection or to use muggle transport if necessary.
It was the fifth door they tried that made Granger halt. There wasn’t anything immediately obvious about it, but when he opened his mouth to ask her if this was the right one, she held up a hand to silence him. And then he heard whispers coming from inside. It was a long rectangular room which was very dimly lit with what looked like a large pit sunken in the middle.
The taxi dropped them near the Leaky Cauldron, and Draco could tell this was going to be difficult purely by the sheer volume of people in the pub alone. He was always careful to avoid crows with Teddy, not wanting to put him at risk by having an anxiety attack when Teddy was his sole responsibility.
‘Hey, hey, don’t panic. It’s not so bad, you’re getting way too ahead of yourself. Just wait until you get there and you get engrossed in all your lessons and your friends. You’ll forget all about us.’
‘This is going to sound really archaic, but magic and divorce don’t really go well together.’ She looked between them apologetically.
‘When I’m not having a nightmare, you mean.’ He shuddered as the image of Smith’s face flashed in his mind. Harry intertwined their fingers and pulled Draco’s hand to his chest.
Harry leant forward and kissed him, and Draco could feel Harry’s change of mood instantly. Harry’s kisses were always intense because he was such an intense person, but this was different. He had this unique power of pushing his magic outwards, as if he really wanted Draco to feel how he felt. So many times Draco had been overwhelmed by it and even a decade later he still got a shock when he felt the familiar buzz of Harry’s magic. He held Draco’s face with one hand as the other moved to hold onto his hip and Draco knew exactly what he was thinking.
“Not to me,” he said as she left the warmth of the conservatory for the jungle-style living room. It was too quiet for her to hear, or so he thought, except she hesitated for a fraction of a second before apparently ignoring him.
to be annoyed at Ginny, she was more than entitled to get pregnant, but she didn’t have to quit the team permanently. Where was he supposed to get a chaser this short notice? He’d expected Ginny would be back from maternity leave by now. A considerate witch would have told him sooner.
‘I had planned on starting my own business, but my loan application was denied after that awful newspaper spread on Harry and his new girlfriend.’ Draco said bitterly. He’d never brought it up with Harry, but he hadn’t quite forgiven him for it. If Draco was any wiser than he was, he’d be able to admit that it wasn’t Harry’s fault. He wasn’t.
‘Really.’ Draco closed the space between them and rested his forehead against Harry’s, wiping the few tears that had fallen from his face and marvelling at how soft his skin was beneath his thumbs. ‘We’re really going to do this.’ He whispered.
He didn’t read the words, he could already feel his bloody boiling. He did however, flick through to see how long the article was. Harry had landed himself a three-page spread. Or at least, Draco thought he had. As it turned out, the final page was a delight all on its own.
“Why is this so complicated? It’s like patting my head and rubbing my stomach at the same time! This is why wizards apparate!” He was struggling to change from third to fourth.
‘Love you too. I’ll see you later.’ He felt guilty as soon as he walked away. It wasn’t right for him to disappear every time things went wrong. But then, wouldn’t it be worse if he stayed? Teddy had already seen so much, and it wouldn’t do to have him witness a breakdown on top of everything.
‘Of course I haven’t,’ Draco sniffed. ‘I’ve seen hide nor hair of him since I started. He even got Weasley and Macmillan to take me to that hideous warehouse.’
“And why would you?” He gives Harry a piercing look that makes him think Malfoy knows him better than he would like. Harry fumbles around what words to say in what order when Malfoy saves him. “Not all of us posh twats sit around in our massive houses ordering servants around all day. The novelty wears off by the time you turn ten.”
“Yeah it is.” Harry said so quietly Ron probably didn’t even hear. He offered to get the next round in, even though it wasn’t his turn, since it would give him five minutes to collect himself. Ron barely even responded, just waved his hand vaguely as if it wasn’t even a question.
‘Since when did you start using the front door?’ Draco asked. Hermione rolled her eyes like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Draco sat anxiously waiting for the floo to flare. It felt almost as bad as waiting for Teddy to come home at Christmas except this time he didn’t have as many secrets to tell. Harry had gone to Hogwarts to bring Teddy back himself. Draco had wanted to go too, but Harry thought it might be too much after the distance they’d apparated. He hated agreeing with Harry but he knew when not to push it.
‘Shut up Pans,’ Harry said with a roll of his eyes even Draco would’ve been proud of. ‘Pansy has decided-’
Draco hadn’t cast a corporeal patronus since the day he’d left his marital home, but he’d be damned if he failed to do it now. He wasn’t being quick enough. The pain was getting stronger and his mind was fogging with the strain of holding on. He felt as if he was being split in two while a ghost of his father laughed on amused. The last thing he thought before he blacked out was that he would surely die here, alone.
‘Yes! I was just looking at it. Most of it doesn’t seem of any use.’ He told him. Harry’s frame deflated.
‘Well, although there seems to be little progress, there are also no signs of regression, so I think we can call that a win, Mr Malfoy,’ the creepy mediwitch said as she finished probing Draco for what felt like the hundredth time.
‘You were there but you hadn’t come with us,’ he continued. ‘You were here on your own. For a brief moment I forgot that we were…you know. You were here on your own and I thought you were just being a miserable bastard until you met someone…’ Draco didn’t really want to think about it.
Even though he had come here for a specific purpose, and even though he should have been responsible and kept his visit short, he found himself desperate to extend the time he had with Malfoy. It was the longest they had ever been alone together, and it was also the longest period of time she’d actually acknowledged his presence. He wanted it to mean something.
‘I don’t think so. They don’t get much do they? It’s not like the orphanage has the time or the resources to organise things like this. She really is a little angel, she deserves it.’ He shrugged. Harry sighed and sat down on one of the chairs in the waiting area. Draco followed suit.
He took some upstairs and left it outside the study door, knowing full well that was where Harry would have gone. He felt terrible, especially since Harry had been feeling low and Draco had made it worse. He was no good at this. He knocked on the door and went back downstairs, knowing Harry probably wouldn’t answer.
‘You really said that?’ Draco asked Harry. A glimmer of warmth flooding through him that Harry included Draco when he’d told Teddy that.
‘We’ve all got both light and dark inside us, Draco. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we really are.’
‘So, what if each of these ‘victims’ were targeted through their connections to the clinic. They didn’t have to be patients. They just had to be friends or family of patients or a relative of someone who works there. If they were exposed to aconite and valerian in the same dose, in theory there could be a targeted memory loss which would make them forget taking anything, but not forget the ill effects.’ Draco explained. He glanced at Harry, excited to be finally cracking the case wide open.
‘Oh that! Come through here. Both of you.’ Draco glanced down at the once again sleeping Hugo and wondered whether he should try to put him down or not. ‘Just bring him, Draco. It’s not like he’ll wake up. That boy sleeps deeper than his dad and that’s saying something.’ So, Draco stood carefully and carried Hugo through to Hermione’s study at the back of the house. He’d only been in the room once. It was quite similar to Harry’s study except there were fewer photos and about ten times the books. One of which was laying open on the table in the middle of the room.
‘Well, luckily for you, I’ll never ever be happier without you. I’m very proud of you for going to Hogwarts and being away from home, it’s not easy. You should go to sleep now though, bud. It’s getting very late.’ Teddy looked sideways at his bedside clock and nodded. He yawned widely, his body agreeing with him. Harry chuckled.
Her head shot up from the book when she heard his voice and she smiled so big he thought her face might crack in two. The gap between her front teeth making his heart melt just a little.
‘It’s Potter, actually,’ he drew himself up to his full height, allowing himself to be amused when Wood’s jaw dropped, ‘and we should be going.’
Draco sat at the table for a long time, his stomach growling. He had to do something, he had to change. Something had to give, or things wouldn’t get better. He had to get better not just for himself but for Harry too. He stood up, mulling over his plans as he scanned the fridge for a meal to make. Despite the length of time it had been, Harry was still sometimes lackadaisical about meals. Draco tried his best not to think about why that was, he was struggling to keep his emotions in check as it was.
‘It’s a really good thing you’re doing here, you know? You’ll actually make a difference. A much greater and better difference than you would running around for the Ministry. I say it a lot to Teddy, but I’m proud of you too. And please don’t be annoyed at me for saying it, because I mean it with love, but it’s really helping with your anger too.’ Harry didn’t like to talk about the anger, Draco supposed it made him feel a bit of a failure, but he couldn’t be perfect
He wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist and tugged him over so that he straddled Harry. The kiss was feverous and when Draco’s fingers wound their way into Harry’s hair an unsolicited moan escaped him.
‘Draco, I- you know what? Fine. I can’t argue with that. It was wrong of me to try and force you to do anything anyway. Just promise me you won’t disappear off the face of the earth? The kids are forever complaining that they never see Uncle Draco anymore.’ Draco felt a pang of guilt at that. It was true, he had hardly seen Granger’s spawn in recent years, he barely had a reason to visit since he was no longer with Harry and he hadn’t wanted to run into him by accident either. Still, he couldn’t expect the kids to understand that.
‘Ugh, only you could make the French Ministry of Magic sound hot. Please tell me they call it MAMF.’ Draco pulled on Harry’s hand and led him upstairs to a room he hadn’t shown him yet.
It was funny that Malfoy should remind him so much of Luna. That in turn reminded him that he hadn’t spoken to Luna in a long time. Maybe if he’d kept in better contact, he’d know full well what was going on with Malfoy. The two of them were thick as thieves, or so Harry had been told. He’d dare say they even looked more similar than Ron and Percy ever had. It would probably look obvious if he were to take sudden interest in Luna now that he was only forming yet another weird obsession with Malfoy, but he didn’t like how unsettled seeing her had made him.
‘I’m going to go to my old flat until your dad calms down, but I promise I’m not leaving. You can come with me if you want.’ Teddy stepped away from him and wiped the remainder of his tears away furiously.
‘I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I swear I didn’t mean to shout at you, you didn’t do anything.’ He pulled the boy into his arms and held him while he cried. He’d been so angry he hadn’t even thought that Teddy might’ve heard everything. He couldn’t bring himself to explain. He didn’t even know how to. It was taking every inch of his self-control to hold himself together.
‘Really? Enlighten me.’ He could tell Harry didn’t give a fig about why he was currently ruining the wine, because his face was pressed into Draco’s neck, making it particularly hard to concentrate.
An hour after Harry had left, there came the sound of keys jingling in the lock. By that time Draco had managed to settle on the sofa with another cup of tea and a book he’d started weeks ago but never got around to finishing. He almost dropped his book when he realised this was it. There was no more time left to dwell on anything.
“Your lawyer has paid your bail Mr Malfoy.” A gruff old man informed him. He didn’t expand on his statement and Draco didn’t ask.
His head hurt with all the questions and the constant drumming of Draco’s name. He had to do something about it, but it was getting harder to think or see straight. Ron was trying to get him to lie down again but Harry wasn’t having any of it. Sleeping wasn’t what he needed, he needed to get out of the house and do something about it. Something far away from that cursed tapestry.
There was no way to tell how long Draco had been in Azkaban. In the early days he had tried to count the cycle of the moon by scratching tallies on the wall, but the beginnings of a cold he’d had when he’d entered the prison had raged into a fever so high he’d become delirious, and he’d lost count.
“Because that was what I was expecting too.” There might have been a moment between the two of them if it wasn’t for the loud crash that came from above. At the top of the room, through the door they came in, a group of at least ten hit wizards came bursting in, wands raised. Draco looked at Granger and she was almost returned to her regular appearance bar a slight distortion of her nose and mouth. That must mean that his own Polyjuice had worn off already.
It was lighter now than it had been when he arrived. He could see now that the cell was woefully bare. It was nothing but exposed wall and dirt floor. There was one tiny window, but it was so high up he couldn’t see anything out of it but the sky.
‘Why not? He’s mine remember? You chose your side a long time ago. I’m only making amends.’ Smith was staring right at him, but his eyes were unseeing. It was creepy, and the hairs on the back of Draco’s neck stood on end. He tried to push past Smith, but he wasn’t strong enough. Hermione’s voice continued to rattle around in his skull.
‘Smith mentioned it. He said some of the tests they did at St Mungo’s revealed I have repressed memories or some such rubbish.’ He eventually took the seat he had sat her in to fix her hair, and she almost disappeared into the one behind her desk, it was set so low.
‘I don’t think I can.’ His voice wobbled. Harry put his hand over the last piece. Draco’s skin had cooled rapidly since the sheets had slipped from his shoulders and pooled around his waist, and Harry’s hands were warm as ever.
‘No thank you.’ Spungen nodded and disappeared again. Draco realised Harry had stepped outside and was talking furiously down the phone. He was gripped with a sudden fear that it was Wood again. If it was, would Harry tell him? It would certainly be an interesting test.
Draco fell backwards from the pensieve when the memory ended, his hands shaking and his mind whirring. Harry had been terrifying. Would he really have hurt Wood? Would he really blackmail him right back? Surely his Harry was too good a person to ever consider it.
“Shouldn’t it be my actual name then?” He turns to ask Harry who grins at him broadly and makes his stomach summersault.
‘Are you sure?’ Harry asked him. It didn’t stop Draco’s heart sinking. He knew a rejection when he saw one.
‘Exactly. Think about it like a do over, returning everything to their original state. A factory reset, in muggle terms. When your magic was restored, any lingering effects of your bond with Harry were negated. So, any progress you might have made with your anxiety because of him and any additional help in severing the dark magic in your mark were undone.’
There were clothes already laid out for him which was unusual since the elves knew he preferred to dress himself. There was a tweed blazer with leather patches over the elbows, threadbare corduroy trousers in an odd shade of tan, and brown leather loafers scuffed down the sides. It was about as opposite from Draco’s tastes as could be, but this would make sense if he was to be looking like a muggle.
‘Draco!’ She greeted him warmly as he entered her office. Unlike Kingsley, Hermione didn’t have a secretary yet, she’d been interviewing since she’d taken on her new role, but no one would never match the standards of the organisational queen that was Hermione Granger-Weasley. She rose to kiss his cheeks as always. ‘I wasn’t expecting you. You’ve not come to cancel our get-together, are you? I’m having a hellish day and I was really quite looking forward to it.’
‘Harry talks shit. Since when were we ever friends? I told him the truth about what happened to our marriage and yes, I should have told him long before now, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to start playing happy families. Did he tell you about how he lied to me? How he stole from my flat and accused me of being an addict? How he threatened my relationship with Teddy to try and force a confession out of me? He went full Head Auror on my ass Hermione and that’s not ok. I’m not saying I didn’t deserve it, because I absolutely did, but he’s deluded if he thinks it changes anything at all.’
‘So, you like your house, and I know you like your classes…except Madam Hooch…what else is there?’ Draco probed. Teddy pushed his food around his plate a little, and Draco was convinced this was it. He didn’t dare look at Harry again, just in case he saw his own worry reflected back at him.
It was confusing for Draco, part of him wanted to relax into the idea Harry would come swooping in like a knight in shining armour – he had done that after all. Another part of him wanted to push it away, tell him he didn’t need to be protected. Maybe he did now.
“Wait!” Draco has to switch the chairs over because he has to sit in his specific chair, but he also has to be on the left of Harry, or everything is just… wrong. Harry hasn’t noticed the chairs are the wrong way because to him they all look the same.
He was in his garden, sitting on the swing seat and watching Teddy tumble about on the lawn. He was already six and Draco couldn’t quite believe how quickly he was growing up, or how little balance he had, running around much like a toddler. Still, the knocks and falls didn’t seem to be bothering him at all. Draco had never been allowed to play like that in the manor gardens and he was determined that Teddy’s childhood would be the absolute of Draco’s own stuffy one. Children were supposed to be wild and have fun before the pressures and responsibilities of life caught up to them.
“The name on the tapestry that should be yours. Draco Malfoy.” She got up and walked over to it to look for herself. He stayed where he was facing the space she’d just occupied and deliberately not looking himself for fear of bringing on another spell of dizziness.
Harry could hear the laughter in Draco’s voice and couldn’t stop himself from smiling. Draco’s picnic went uneaten until well after dark, neither of them wanted to untangle themselves from the other.
‘Yeah.’ Teddy croaked and launched himself at Harry. Balance restored. Draco watched as Harry clutched Teddy close to his chest and all of a sudden, the whole scene was too much for him. The tightness in his own chest was so strong he felt like he couldn’t breathe. He tried to gasp in great gusts of air, but his body wouldn’t cooperate. The last thing he remembers before he passed out was Harry’s panic-stricken face and a pair of arms reaching out for him.
which theorised Potter had been lured into the sea by sirens where he now ruled over the merpeople. Draco had witnessed Potter’s ungainly attempt to use gillyweed and that scenario was about as likely as Draco moving to Morocco and burning his porcelain skin in the scorching sun every day. One thing was true: Harry Potter had been missing for five months and Draco was the only person who knew where he went. Presuming, that is, that Potter followed through with the plan he'd told Draco.
Pansy began to explain how she had approached everyone she could think of who could help. As Granger had told him, all the lawyers of old who weren’t locked up themselves for helping his father and his friends still refused to help him. It was Granger who tore after her when leaving the offices of Bloom and Grove to offer her services.
‘I know you want to go and do that project thing. I promise I won’t touch anything I shouldn’t and I’ll floo call you if anything happens. And Dad gave me his muggle phone number too, although I’m not sure where the spare one is for me to call him from…’ Draco bit his lip. It was tempting, and Teddy was getting a little bit older, and he’d been at school and managed just fine. But then there’d always been other people with him at school, and he was Draco’s responsibility, and Draco loved him far too much to live with the guilt if he left him and something happened. Oh, he didn’t know.
‘I never thought I’d say this Weasley, but you’re the safest option around here.’ Ron caught the look on his face.
“Maybe something,” he said uncertainly, “but there’s still the last part.” He couldn’t stand the anguish written all over her. He wanted this to go perfectly but the chances were so small he had tried hard not to get his hopes up – he wondered if Granger had bothered doing the same…
‘That’s not why you won’t talk you him. We’ve been making progress today Draco, don’t throw it away now. The only person you’re hindering is yourself.’ Why did he have to be so bloody self-righteous all the time.
‘You know I’d do anything to get you a baby, don’t you?’ Harry asked him. He felt as Draco nodded his head.
‘Draco, it doesn’t have to be like this.’ Hermione sighed sadly. He’d taken her to a new Italian place not far from the Ministry – muggle – and away from prying eyes and ears.
He glanced over at Harry whose tongue was sticking out in concentration as he tried to line the next fold up perfectly. Draco, who had at least done some forward thinking, abandoned his pastry for a minute to grab his camera from this coat pocket and snap a quick photograph. That caught Harry’s attention.
‘He didn’t know about you because there’s nothing to tell. I don’t go around telling every stranger I meet on the street about you, do I? That’s none of his business. Maybe if you hadn’t started screaming in my face, we could’ve talked about it rationally. Your recovery on the other hand, is actually important.’ Draco sighed. He wasn’t sure what to believe – it felt like there was something Harry wasn’t saying. He could, however, shut him up about this recovery thing.
“Less inclined by the minute.” Her elbows remained on the table and she propped her chin up with her hands. It was a surprisingly informal posture. “There’s nothing formal about this chat, Draco. Just tell me what you know, and we’ll go from there.” Draco’s irritation flared.
“My help.” He repeats flatly. “Why would I be able to help you? I’m entirely the wrong sort.” Harry doesn’t blame Malfoy for being dubious, in fact he almost laughs at the reference to one of their earliest interactions all those years ago, but he really could use Malfoy’s help, so he tries not to be antagonistic.
‘Je vais vous apprendre à faire des mille-feuilles.’ Draco’s smile grew. His grandmother on his father’s side used to make mille-feuille when he was small, although she’d died when he was five, so he hadn’t had homemade ones in a long time. In his peripheral vision he could see Harry looking grumpy.
‘I forgive you. Grown up stuff sounds hard. I think it would make me very angry too if you were happier without me.’
‘Again!’ She squealed like a toddler when they reappeared. Draco could feel Harry’s shoulders shaking with silent laughter but felt too ill to turn his head and look. Harry let go of Draco’s arm to take Ella from him, but immediately grabbed his shoulder when the loss of support had him wobbling.
“It’s all circumstantial right now,” she began. “There’s no evidence from your meeting with Harry that you had any intention to harm him, which is good, but-” Of course there had to be a but. “It is suspicious that you happened to see him. It could easily be construed as a planned event, like you wanted to be seen getting along with him to divert attention, why would you suddenly want to see him anyway? And right before he…left.”
‘I’m sorry I always call you Draco. I thought you might not want me to call you anything else because you’re always so proper. You are my dad though, just like Harry is my dad.’ Draco wouldn’t have told Teddy that he’d called him Daddy at least twice already even if he could. As it happened, his throat was too tight, and his eyes were too hot with tears to say more than a few words.
“You should be the one telling me that.” She snapped. He couldn’t quite tell if she was referring to the noise that had startled her, or the whole affair with him taking ill. Either way, he couldn’t hide the twist of a smirk forming on his face. He didn’t know how he felt about the fact that he enjoyed her being annoyed at him. Only Malfoy could actually be angry instead of worried. Or maybe for her they were the same thing.
The movement was tentative, unsure, nothing like the confident Malfoy he was used to. There was a pause and then it happened again. Presumably because Harry didn’t do anything to deter her, Lyra continued to play with Harry’s hair. In a way it seemed wrong, since Harry was usually the one who was obsessed with her hair, but it also made his heart race in his chest.
‘I already have to-to take turns seeing you and seeing Dad and I haven’t seen you all week and-and when I go to school I’ll have to choose who to see at Christmas and-’ He babbled, almost running out of breath. It still hurt Draco hearing Teddy call Harry ‘dad’. He’d started doing it when he was five. Draco remembers how he couldn’t understand why Harry couldn’t be his dad when his first one wanted him to be. It was really simple logic, and no one quite knew how to argue with him so from then on, Harry became Dad.
‘Don’t worry, I won’t ruin the famous Malfoy image. Your secret is safe with me. There is one thing I wanted you to know before I left though.’ She said, turning away from him and looking out the window.
“Yeah, well, I did what I had to do.” Ron muttered into the cushion. Harry didn’t think it was a wise topic of conversation for the time being. It had only been a month since their big split, and with emotions so raw, neither of them seemed to know what to do without each other. Harry had mercifully been spared the agony of having to choose one friend over the other, but it wasn’t easy. When Hermione had found out Ron was staying with Harry it had very nearly been the end of their friendship, but thankfully there were some bonds that weren’t broken so easily. Even Hermione conceded that at the very least Ron couldn’t move back home to The Burrow where Molly was still crying at every small reminder of Fred.
Finally, Draco gasped in a lungful of air. He’d almost relaxed until he realised he couldn’t let it go again, but Harry was still there. ‘In…and out, Draco. You can do this.’ He told him calmly. He released his breath and slowly he tried to find a normal breathing rhythm.
“I see.” Her face shuttered just as he expected. His refusal sat heavy between them and even though he desperately wanted to reach out and kiss her again, he knew it wouldn’t be appreciated.
‘Hermione, what the heck is going on here?’ Her office was a disaster. The Hermione he knew was so organised a speck of dust would stick out like a sore thumb. This new office – whilst it was twice the size of her previous one – was covered floor to ceiling in papers and archive boxed.
“Do not fuck this up.” Lyra hissed in his ear while they had a moment alone. “We’re doing this for Sirius, and we won’t get another chance.” Irritation flared. He didn’t like the implication that he was doing this on purpose – why should he? He
‘Are you sure? It took ages to convince them I wasn’t some sort of evil mastermind and then it was all so messy when we split. It was crazy enough they all forgave me for everything I said about them…’
‘I can see that your parents paid for the very best of healers, although you rarely needed them. I can also see you were given the most cutting edge of vision correction charms. I find it hard to believe your father would go to such lengths for you if he was as terrible a person as you claim.’
“That’s- awful. And wrong.” In that moment it was like the gentle breeze from the weather jar had given him a gust of the kind of confidence he’d never had before, “you’re beautiful exactly as you are.” And he meant it.
Taking a deep breath, Harry walked into the middle of the room. Dust motes flew around his head, floating in the streaks of light coming in at an angle through the windows. He shivered again and scrunched his eyes closed before forcing them open again and looking at the tapestry wall. He knew before his eyes found the right area that it was as he suspected. Nestled at the bottom of the family tree was a blond-haired boyish version of the man behind the smoky screen. Harry’s heart swooped as he looked at name Draco Malfoy and he couldn’t quite tell if it was in a good way or not.
“That’ll be in the modern section then,” he told her, pointing towards the bookcase on the far right. He glanced over at the small desk his father had added to this room. It wasn’t as intricate and ostentatious as the desk in his study, but he had added a simpler one to this room, presumably so he didn’t have to lug heavy books and delicate manuscripts across different floors. There was a quill abandoned on the scratched surface, its tip stained with dried black ink. Draco wondered what it was his father had been researching the last time he had been in here.
“Ok, good. Now you need to dip the clutch again and change into third.” They were driving down the country roads on a particularly warm spring day. Draco had been very against the idea of a car, but Harry really wanted one. Of course, when Harry ignored Draco completely and went and bought one, Draco couldn’t handle not partaking in the fun.
She beamed up at him and grabbed his hand to pull him over to her beanbag. He sat down on the floor figuring there wouldn’t be a beanbag suitable for an adult. She began telling him all about what she’d been learning at muggle primary school – Harry had been adamant that every child who passed through the orphanage got at least some muggle education before they went to Hogwarts.
‘Harry?’ He knocked on the door forcefully. Sometimes the warding around the room made it impossible to hear someone on the outside, but Draco still felt it important to knock before he entered. He always had. There was no reply, but he’d expected as much.
“If you’re going to be like that, I’ll walk out that door and never speak to you again.” He snapped, standing up and going to get his coat. He wasn’t ready to brave the freezing November day, nor did he want to come away empty handed, but he wasn’t going to enable her ignorance.
‘What? Draco! No! Delete that. I bet I look ridiculous!’ Draco shook his head and hid the camera behind his back.
‘I’m starting to think France agrees with you a little too much.’ Harry’s tone was light but there was something deeper in his eyes. Unease, perhaps a little fear. Draco chose to ignore it for now, although his attachment to this place might not be avoidable for long.
‘Oh shit.’ Draco followed Harry’s gaze to the blackening mark spreading across his chest from his heart outwards. The truth of the matter was that he’d regained use of his magic about six weeks after the incident, but every time he’d tried to use it something inevitably had gone wrong. At first, he’d simply passed out and had assumed that his body just wasn’t ready yet. Then he’d get tingles in his arms where he channelled the magic and was put off from trying it. In the past couple of weeks, each time he’d tried to cast, usually when he’d been alone at the flat working on his project, this had happened.
“See, you knew exactly what I meant, so it is like that. Do you really think you’d be doing any of this if you didn’t? You saved his live once already, most people would think that was more than enough. And what am I supposed to do? Flit about worrying about the wording of Astoria’s engagement in the papers, start organising wedding venues and flower arrangements while the two of you… what? What even are you two doing? Because you haven’t told me a thing!” He had forgotten all about Astoria.
good. In the few minutes Draco had withdrawn into his mind, Hermione had sensed a shift in the mood.
‘That was your father’s wand, sweetheart. It’s cypress with a unicorn core.’ Teddy’s mouth hung open.
It didn’t register with him until he was opening the large doors to his favourite bedroom suite, that he’d produced that small quip as naturally as he blinked and yet it had sounded so much like his former self. Maybe there was hope after all.
‘Well, have you considered reviewing one of your memories?’ Draco had told Hermione about how his mind healer had suggested memory viewing as a coping mechanism and Hermione had been very enthusiastic about it. In fact, her belief it would work was one of the reasons Draco had persisted with it at first.
‘Harry arranged with McGonagall for him to come back for a weekend. It seems silly really, interrupting his studies like that. I’m fine now, it’s not like he needs to rush to my bedside.’ He actually really wanted Teddy to come home, just for a little bit. He missed his little wolf and he didn’t want to go so long without seeing him when he never really got the chance to say goodbye. That didn't stop him feeling guilty for causing so much disruption to his first year. He hadn't wanted him to leave for school, but he had expected him to enjoy his lessons and make friends and not be worrying about what's going on at home.
This was the end of the road for him anyway, he may as well tell someone with a vested interest in finding out what he knew. If she really was here at Pansy’s behest, maybe she would help him. He began to explain what had happened at the Leaky. Paraphrasing what Potter had told him for fear of saying more than he should.
“You’ll get the hang of it; it just takes practise. Now you’re going to have to slow down. You probably need to change down to second. If you have to, you can jump straight from fourth to second. Remember, second is next to fourth behind first.” That was the point when things really went wrong.
‘I did tell him that. I told you that too. Hell, I think I told everyone that.’ Draco wasn’t angry, not anymore. He knew his friends just wanted what they thought was best for him. At the end of the day, the only one who really knew him was himself.
She gave him a long look as if it wasn’t a big deal. “That way you can’t possibly accidently bump into yourself and no one can question if you’re somewhere you shouldn’t be.” She shrugged.
‘Harry, no.’ Draco pushed him to arm’s length and reached for the potion. He needed to get himself under control. He downed the potion in one and set the vial back down on the counter.
runs an annual article about our Christmas arrangements.’ He looked apologetic and Draco sighed wearily.
Still, did that mean Harry hadn’t used these decorations since the last time Draco had cast the spell? That would be silly, he bet the idiot forgotten to cast it despite always watching Draco do it.
“The roses. The yellow roses you said just last week were the worst kind of roses because yellow flowers are what you take your sick grandma in hospital.” Granger looked to Draco for help, but he refused to get involved. He’d barely had any sleep and now wasn’t the time for arguments.
people. Especially since the rules, such as GETTING A WARRANT, don’t apply to you!’ Draco had never been so angry in his life. He’d spent an entire weekend not eating or sleeping or showering because he’d had an attack and didn’t have the right amount of potion. Yes, his new batch was ready a day later but by then he’d relapsed.
‘So, we were thinking about cutting about six inches off. What do you think?’ He glanced at Ella in the mirror in front of him where she was squirming with excitement and look at him hopefully with a broad smile on her face.
‘So… he wants to see you now? Why? Did something happen?’ Trust Teddy to ask a million questions before giving a second for an answer.
‘It’s very relevant, but if you don’t want to talk about it yet then we won’t. Tell me about something else. Tell me about your father.’ This guy wasn’t about to give up any time soon. Draco supposed he should throw him a bone.
‘What?’ Harry gripped Teddy’s shoulders and steered him away from the Christmas tree, sitting him down on the sofa. ‘Dad? What’s going on?’ He was starting to look worried, so Draco opened his mouth to answer him. Harry held up a hand to stop Draco.
‘Excellent. Please do also consider what I’ve said about bringing Harry with you. I really do think it would improve your recovery by leaps and bounds. I expect to see you at the same time each week for the next eight weeks.’ Draco breathed a sigh of relief when he left the room. He despised those sessions and the supposed
He and Harry stayed for lunch, although it was a slightly awkward affair since Draco was still reeling from Hermione’s research and Harry seemed put out by Draco’s refusal to let him help. He was quiet throughout the meal, and even when Harry tried to coax him out of his shell with a gentle hand on his knee, he pretended not to notice.
‘Only one?’ Pansy said, her nose wrinkling and her face twisting in distain. ‘I thought you were supposed to be posh Draco.’ He snorted an undignified laugh and followed her as she strutted out of the room.
He said as much to Hermione when they had lunch at the Ministry the next day. They’d been having lunch together once a week since Draco had started working there. Hermione said the familiarity would help him settle in much better and she wasn’t wrong.
‘No! No, no I wouldn’t dare.’ Harry took both of Draco’s still trembling hands in his. ‘I just wanted to scare him like I used to back in the force. He doesn’t know I would never try it though, he probably thinks everyone’s mind works like this. Please, you have to believe me. I just want you to be safe. That’s all I’ve ever wanted. The thought he might hurt you…I was incensed.’ He swallowed hard, looking at Draco with wide, terrified eyes. Draco hadn’t expected him to be so fretful about it.
They’d agreed that they’d grow Narcissus and Lily in their garden, as an ode to their mothers, without whom their garden would never exist. Except it turned out that Draco was allergic to lilies, so they’d agreed to put in Pineapple Lilies, a native South African flower instead, as the variety was just different enough from English lilies to not bother Draco. Thankfully, with the use of weather charms, they could grow any plant they wanted.
As he waited a couple of minutes for the potions to take effect, he walked through the apartment and replenished his warming charms. A more skilled wizard than Draco would’ve been able to weave warming charms into to the apartment walls themselves, but Draco only knew how to replenish old charms. He could pay someone to do it for him, but since he’d effectively given Pansy and Blaise free run of furnishing the chateau when it was ready, he didn’t think he should be too frivolous with his galleons. Plus, walking around helped aid the blood flow to his extremities. He staunchly refused to think about what Hermione had just told him.
He was trying his best to cast his wards as subtly as possible without withdrawing his wand from his sleeve, which was proving to be quite difficult since he couldn’t make the right wand movements very well. He prided himself on being proficient at wandless and wordless magic, but spells such as these he would admit were beyond him. His father taught him many such spells, most of which had been born from dark curses purebloods would cast on their possessions to ensure only members of the own family could possess them or use them. Of course, eventually people worked out counter-curses and such forth, but even those stayed within families.
