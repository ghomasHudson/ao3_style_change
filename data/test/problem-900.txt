Draco lifted his hips. Harry’s eyes rolled back. He gasped, rolled his own slowly forward, but Draco grabbed his hips and dragged him in, hard, and it was all over from there. It was too much to hold back and Harry was not a man built on a foundation of patience to begin with. Draco encouraged him, hooking his legs around Harry’s waist and rocking up into him with a talent Harry
The traitorous thought that maybe this could have had something to do with Draco’s reluctance entered his mind and wouldn’t leave.
“His personality,” Harry said, feeling strangely confused, like he wasn’t sure who said those words because it certainly wasn’t him. He furrowed his brow and stared down at his shoes, thinking. What a stupid thing to say. What had possessed him to think Malfoy’s
Dennis laughs again, his quill automatically jotting it down. “Can’t say I blame you, Harry. I swear I thought for a minute he had a
Harry hummed. “I suppose. But really, Draco. It might’ve been Teddy seeing us that started the downward spiral, but we screwed it up it in plenty of other ways. We fooled around that whole month when we should’ve been honest with each other. I’d trusted you with my life for years, and I was still afraid to tell you that it was more than sex to me.”
The healers release her two hours later, when they’re sure her concussion’s gone down enough that she’ll probably, most likely, be okay if she falls asleep. They don’t even bother trying to keep Aurors overnight anymore. It’s always a lost cause. Harry tells her goodnight, that he’s going to get dinner now that his partner duty is over for the day, but she comes with him, and it’s not really as bad as it could be.
“So we can count on your support then,” called the assistant to the Mugwump, lingering by the door. “When can we expect Atlantis to raise the wards again?”
They ended up dragging the bound and gagged alien through Dudley’s Floo to the one in the Manor’s parlour, though it was no easy task.
Draco forced himself to remain calm. The man’s placard had read ‘Leopold’. Further, he’d introduced himself as Leopold Leopold III, at length, not even an hour ago. Perhaps Potter should go back to his old spectacles and have a hearing test to boot. Or perhaps he was being a dick on purpose, which Draco wholeheartedly approved of.
“Oh thank god,” Draco muttered, standing. And then, to himself, “Words I never thought I’d say in regards to Kyle’s arrival, and yet, I never considered my other option would be watching you eat a substandard sausage with noodles, peanuts, cilantro, and scrambled eggs on top.”
Draco snorted. Potter looked conflicted; Draco suspected his internal Gryffindor was at war with itself, not sure whether to take the moral high ground or do whatever possible to get his cousin back.
Snape huffed, as if being in Harry’s presence for too long was unbearable. Harry was quite sure it was, for him. “Yes.”
The air was tense as other Muggle-born and half-blood staff opened their own Muggle papers, and word slowly, quietly made its way around the table. Somehow, Harry knew Malfoy had already seen this morning’s Muggle headline.
“Oh, go fuck yourself, Potter,” came an annoyed voice from the Scottie-filled landscape above the fireplace.
And Draco thought it was ingenious. Any ward, no matter how powerful, could be cracked. Even Hogwarts’ wards had cracked under sustained onslaught. Wards, by their very nature, were susceptible to someone simply…stepping around the ‘shield’ to the unprotected side. Usually, that was the bottom or top. Some wards were spherical, but much harder to cast.
, but it wasn’t on the table before him. It was, in fact, still in the harness in his sleeve. He pulled it out, stared at it dumbly. “I don’t remember putting my wand away.”
Harry looked up from where he was frying Teddy and Rosie some grilled cheese sandwiches. “Who told you that?”
“I’ll show you hard,” Harry growled. He pushed Draco back on his bed and slid in on top of them. Out in the common room, a cacophony of excited voices started up as the barrel door opened. The rest of the house was back, but they were too excited to miss Harry or Draco right now, and Harry was going to take full advantage of that.
“This is ridiculous,” said Draco, but his voice was so quiet and his eyes were so wide that Harry rather thought Draco was thinking anything but.
The reminder, this first free moment to really think since Dudley’s abduction, made Harry’s heart ache painfully. He laughed, and it nearly turned into a sob. If his eleven-year-old self had known he’d one day be desperately sad and worried about Dudley’s safety—that he’d do
“There’s more to it than that,” says Harry. “It happens to plenty of people who’ve never touched a magical artefact at all, much less a haunted one. Lots of people are born with them.”
Draco’s mouth snapped shut and he stared resolutely forward. Harry readjusted Mrs Black’s portrait inside his linen blazer. Her frame kept digging into his ribs.
“If it was easy, don’t you think every second degree Alchemist in the world would have made one by now?” Harry said. “I know this is right.”
Harry nodded thoughtfully. “I wonder why he thinks he can do stuff like this. Sending us out here and saying he’ll cause trouble for us if we don’t fix it.”
Addolgar plated some cheese and cherries for Harry and passed it to him as he talked. Harry was not one to say no to snacks. “Well, I was also reading about how they make plastics, and they start from pretty much the same stuff. It’s all just hydrogen and carbon, in different combinations.”
“I know it is,” says Narcissa Malfoy, the spells on her cowl relaxed enough today that he sees her face clearly. “But it is even more important in a case such as this, where we need everyone at peak performance in order to unravel this mystery. We can’t gamble on Unspeakable Malfoy and Unspeakable Granger’s futures—or this department’s single pursuit—because they were too besotted with one another to focus on the work. It is dangerous for them and dangerous for our mission.”
Harry reaches out to grab his shoulders and drag him in. “Come on, fuck me,” he says and kisses him. “Claim me,” he says when they break apart.
When he arrived at Andromeda’s that night, he’d already put in two wanks, and was feeling confident for the evening. They had plans to go running through Belgravia, where Draco’s flat was, afterwards. Harry had recently found that Draco-sweaty-from-Auror-training was particularly irresistible. It was even worth a five kilometre run in November. Then it was back to Draco’s flat for a hot bath in his obnoxiously large tub, sex in the tub, and perhaps some humping afterwards if Harry had his way, which he usually did.
of them could have drowned. As witches and wizards, they took for granted that magic could save them… and this time, if they’d been alone when that happened, they would have died.
“I also wish to tender my resignation,” Harry whispers. “As I will be unable to continue to abide by the Department’s first covenant of no interpersonal relationships.”
Hermione slammed her glass down, spilling water all along the frayed tablecloth. George winced, but said nothing. “Because they don’t
“Not a very good strategy,” came Malfoy’s voice. He sat down between Harry and Hermione, balancing a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of red wine. They turned to him. “Laughing at Granger, I mean. Anyone who knows you at all would know you’d never pick someone who couldn’t accept your friends.”
Malfoy steps closer, that stupid blond eyebrow raised in that stupid blond way Malfoy has of doing it. “It?” he says.
“Headmistress, I did, and that’s all you’ll get from me,” said the Hat. It turned and looked over the hall. “Now I see we only have Mr Zabini left. He’s to stay in Slytherin as well. No, no, boy, no need to come up. I can read you all the way from there. Merlin have mercy, these two are the absolute caricatures of their houses.”
Draco smirked. Harry tugged him back into the kitchen and pulled him into an embrace. “Don’t be a git, Draco,” he murmured against Draco’s lips. Draco licked him, and Harry burst out laughing. “You’re so weird, Malfoy.”
Luna tapped the middle barrel and the lid swung outward. She peered inside, then leaned out to give Harry a thumbs up before crawling in. The rest of the group waited for the tell-tale screech of a curse landing or splat of goo dropping on her inside the barrel. At the first sound of distress, Harry would rush in there and help, but…
As if Draco could read minds, Harry’s swim trunks were pushed down his thighs, and he felt Draco’s fingers rubbing along his cleft, teasing at his hole while his other hand came around to wrap around his cock. He rocked his hips, swaying in the water, unsure which way he wanted to push most. Draco’s fingers worked him open so slowly he thought he would die, or their Gillyweed would need a top-up at least.
Theo repeated the words and the ceremony was complete. Goblins trailed into the conference room with silver platters of meaty hors d'oeuvres and goblin-made wine. These turned out to be extremely popular with the guests, especially Parvati’s twin sons, Kush and Kareem. She’d married a minor Kilgore who she’d met at a Divinations conference in Brussels, and according to Hermione, they were very happy and had even predicted the birth of their sons. Amazing.
, says Harry. He snaps his fingers and the sunglasses jump into his hand from the bag in his hotel room. Malfoy looks at them but doesn’t take them.
They also covered the trial of the Obliviator, and the Ministry’s continued efforts to lock-in aid from the UMN, but they were now fighting over how to punish UK for breaking the Statute, potentially on an irreparable scale. Harry was deeply unimpressed with bureaucracy at this point in his life and did not expect to ever change his mind on that.
“How was it out there?” Dennis Creevey whispered to him. “Worldwide explosions have got to be pretty loud, but the wards here muffled the worst of it. I haven’t heard from my parents yet and I’m a bit worried.”
“Oh Harry don’t worry, you guys will find them.” Hermione reaches across the table and gives my hand a slight squeeze.
“Very good Miss Granger. Five points to Gryffindor.” I watch her smirk in satisfaction. But am surprised when another hand shoots in the air.
“Do you smell that?” I whine, not liking where this scent is leading me, no matter how lovely. My now golden eyes quickly take in the whole room, not even letting a whisper of hair escape my notice. It’s then that I catch the movement of two figures strutting into the room. Both are very clearly male, one taller then the other with white blonde hair that I can only recognize as an inherited Malfoy trait. My eyes sharpen as I take in the slightly shorter male, his striking black hair reaches to his shoulders in an unkempt mess and vibrant green eyes alight with excitement that I can see even at this distance.
“He is right Harry.” Granger pipes in. “In fact I believe I read somewhere that witches and wizards with this specific creature inheritance always have two to three mates.”
“I did.” I hop of my desk and slowly start pacing the room, feeling the pressure of everyones undivided attention.
“You will learn your way about.” He states simply before addressing my attire. “You are looking nice my dear. I must say you look like a Slytherin.” I look down and realize that I am wearing the green and silver of his snakes.
“I do so admire your want to excel in my class, but I would prefer if you would just listen for today.” She blushes bright red before putting down her quill and giving me her undivided attention.
“Do not make promises you can not keep.” I smirk sheepishly at her words and swear I see a small smile soften her own lips as she turns away. I quickly recover and turn back to Severus only to find that he is across the Great Hall talking with his Godson and the group of Gryffindor’s. I steel myself for the powerful smell and walk down the steps and toward my mentor and unsuspecting mates. The closer I get the more powerful the smell gets and it takes everything in me not to start purring like a pitiful omega. In those few seconds I have to remind myself who I am, remind myself of the strong witch I am, and not some simpering twit who will expose her belly for a pretty smell and handsome faces.
“Mr. Weasley, five points from Gryffindor for your dreadful manners.” Severus’s voice is sharp as he quickly delves out the punishment.
“Bullshit.” I know he is totally serious. His onyx eyes bore into mine and I find myself losing this battle of wills. “I can’t.”
“Well like you said the creature inheritance doesn’t have a true name because of the rarity.” She says in an almost know-it-all voice. “But those who do inherit it, do so at the young age of five. The blood of the shape shifter allows the witch or wizard to turn into any animal form, magic or not with will.”
I look down at the students and see that the majority of them have gone pale and still, fear clearly in their young and innocent eyes as they watch their Potions Professor descend the stone steps. “I must say that you truly seem to enjoy frightening your students.” He smirks down at me and I smile up at him before giving him a small shove and making him stumble to the side with a slight gasp at the unexpected move. Some of the student’s snigger making me grin widely as my mentor glares at me for ruining his moment to strike fear in their hearts. “ Oh come off it Severus!” I say loudly as we walk through the double doors. The students in the hall are clearly amused at my antics, many of them laughing at Snape’s back. As I follow my now brooding mentor I find myself pausing, and gape at the brightly lit hall. Festivity is in the air and I watch as hundreds of students rushing to their perspective tables.
“Draco tells me that you had a nice conversation in the halls late last night.” I startle at the low voice besides me and look up to see a slight sneer on Severus’s face. Giving a low growl my eyes turn back to the Alphas as the join their bookish friend at her table.
“Its pretty late Sev.” I glance up at him now standing frame and give him my most innocent smile. Hoping that my uses of his nickname would soften the beta’s harsh look.
“Ron I would apologize if I were you.” I turn to the green eyed alpha as he speaks to his friend. He gives me a kind apologetic smile and I can’t help but smile back.
“Not if they keep blocking us ‘Mione.” I say dejectedly, once again pushing on the mental barricade in my mind that is keeping us from finding our mate. Always hoping that it would fall for just a moment to give us even the smallest of hints.
“Stop being a twit Helena and just say thank you for getting you a job.” I roll my eyes as he knocks on the door and I hear a stern voice say ‘enter’. Severus throws the doors open wide before leading me into the Headmistresses office. Looking around at the bookshelves and the moving portraits on the high walls and a big desk is placed in the room and behind the desk in a large leather chair sits a very stern looking alpha with graying hair and square glasses. She looks up at us as we step into the middle of the room and graces me with an apprising look. I watch as her nostrils flair taking in my nonexistent scent, as I like wise take in her dampened scent.
“Well if he did that then that must be because he trusts her.” Hermione follows my stare and gives Helen an assessing look. “And you trust him now don’t you Harry?”
“Before she stood up he had nudged her in a very friendly way. He must have gotten the Headmistress to give her the job.”
“Hello.” She rasps out before pausing and clearing her throat. “Hello.” She says with more oomph and smiles proudly as her honey smooth voice doesn’t falter again. “I’m Helena Win…” A few of the students giggle when she doesn’t call herself Professor; in fact it is very rare when we hear a Professors real name. McGonagall clears her throat and Helena looks back at her in confusion. “Oh Shit!” She says ducking her head, then with wide eyed she realizes she just cussed in front of the whole school. More then half of the students are trying to hide their laughs and I can’t help but chuckle as McGonagall gasps. “I mean… Oh what am I supposed to do?” She looks toward Snape with a helpless look and he raises his eyebrow and gives her an evil smirk.
By the time I reach the classroom I am in a foul mood due to the fact that I once again got lost and ended up in the dungeons. My mood gets even worse when I hear the loud voices of students on the other side of the door and find that I am the late one to class. With a huff I storm through the door and let it slam shut, silencing the entire classroom. I glide up to the front of the classroom and turn sharply to face my students.
“Your Godson and The Boy Who Lived. They are my fucking mates.” I grate out and glare up at my mentor, brushing his warm hand off my knee. He doesn’t even rebuke me for my language.
“As do I, But today I am making an exception. You see todays subject is very close to home for me. And I prefer if you all just listened, trust me I won’t test you on what you are learning today.” I see the understanding in her eyes and then watch as all my student’s lean forward eager to hear more about me.
“Once you meet your mate or mates you have two months before going into heat. How are you going to get around that my dear omega?” I curse forgetting all about it.
“She will be an excellent teacher, I helped train her up.” I hear a hint of pride in his voice and it makes me blush a bit.
“He did.” I turn my eyes to the tall well-built Malfoy as he steps toward me so he can tower over my slightly smaller frame. Potter is not far behind and I find myself cornered and suddenly very pissed.
“Alright Mr. Longbottom. What is your question?” I lean forward showing the beta that he has my attention.
“Hello.” I jump in shock at the small squeaky voice and lift my head looking for the speaker. “Down here miss.” I look down to find a house elf at my feet; she is looking up at me with a happy smile.
“Still mad about last night then?” He doesn’t say anything and I heave a great sigh before scooping big helpings of food onto my plate.
“You are going to take that ridiculous spell off and let them find you.” He states matter-of-factly leaning forward once again.
“Hello Hagrid!” I chirp, quickly getting over my shock. “It is very nice to meet you. I suspect that you and I will get along well enough.” I eye the other professors and contain the urge to stick my tongue out at them.
“A unicorn!” He shouts excitedly and I once again feel the tingly pull of my magic and I switch forms again. A few of the girls squeal in delight at my white coat and pointy horn. A few of the students start spouting of random animals like; dog, owl, fox, giant spider. Each time a new animal is called out I willingly change for the amusement of my students. Finally I am back in human form and looking around the buzzing classroom.
“Very good. Now I want to congratulate you on your morning classes. I have overheard many conversations between the students. It seems you have captured their interest.” She gives me a small smile before walking away. After a few more bites of food I decide that it is time to make my way back to my classroom. I am already dreading the next few hours, being that my next group of students are the Eighth year Slytherns and Gryffindor’s.
They turn and head for the door. “Next time, we should go for a fly. Maybe play a Seekers’ game?” Draco smirks at Harry with a challenge in his eyes.
Matthew’s tears are falling by this point. “I really thought you meant you’d just get me through Hogwarts. That’s so much already.”
Harry nods slightly, and Draco squeezes his hand. “I’ll make sure he does.” Draco’s voice is firmer now.
“Do you know,” Draco’s voice is gravelly in his ear, “how incredibly sexy you look carrying our son?”
Piling his sandwiches and some crisps on a plate, Harry grabs a butterbeer and heads back to the couch. Tonight is going to consist of food, the couch, bad television, and texting Draco. Arranging himself comfortably, he flips on the telly and reaches for his phone as it vibrates.
“I know, it’s just—” Harry fumbles for words. “Hermione, I feel like a teenager. I really like him. I enjoy his company. I think he’s a fantastic person. And he’s bloody fit!”
Midnight swoops gracefully past Harry as he lowers himself into his chair again, spreading James’ letter open first.
“I am, too,” Scorpius agrees, “as long as I have a place here. It’ll be good to spend the break with Al.”
“We have pictures of his face.” Draco’s pride in their son is evident in his voice. “Everything looks good otherwise, as well.”
“I’m so glad to have you home.” He studies them both as they pull away. Albus, to his delight, looks wonderful. He looks as if he’s been sleeping more and his face isn’t pinched or drawn with worry. “Good trip?”
“Perfect, now—” The Healer places her hands on top of James’ “—If we press, just a little… There. Do you feel that hard, round spot?”
On Healer Carr’s fourth visit, she tells them that his membrane is nearly fully dilated, and his anal opening has started to soften. “This means contractions are going to get worse, but it also means you’re turning towards the home stretch. If your water breaks before I come back, take your Portkey to St Mungo’s. It could be any time.”
“Do you suppose we should just wait for her to notice the rings?” Draco muses as they pull on some clothes.
“Go on, Scorp,” Draco encourages. “Take Al and go see what you like. Come get Harry and me when you’ve settled on a couple of options.”
“I’ll brew him some. It only takes a couple of hours.” Draco seems thankful to have something he can actually
Harry takes a deep breath and tries to school his expression into something less severe. “It’s okay, most people assume that. It’s just—” Harry gropes for a word and comes up empty. “It’s just not accurate.”
“No. I really can’t. Some days it feels like I’ve been pregnant forever, but really, it’s all gone so fast.” Harry looks down at his belly. “I still can’t believe I’m lucky enough to have a child with you.”
“That’s it!” Healer Powell fairly crows. “He’ll be out in just a few more pushes if you go like that. Take a breath and go again as soon as you feel the urge!”
“I know, love. I wish I could take away your pain, but every single contraction brings us closer to meeting our son. I can’t wait to see Regulus in your arms.”
Harry runs his eyes down his body again and heads into the bathroom. He has a meeting with the new Department Head at the Center for Rare Magical Maladies in about twenty minutes and Draco had promised him these clothes were appropriate. He wonders if he’ll get to see Draco and if it would be appropriate to find him afterwards to ask him to go to lunch. Shrugging to himself, he reaches for the Sleekeazy’s and sets to work on the rest of his appearance.
There’s no stopping the grin that spreads on Harry’s face. “Then, yes. Same page.” He feels tension go out of Draco underneath him and finds himself pulled tighter into Draco’s chest. It’s clearly a relief for both of them. “Do you
“Scorpius always wanted a sibling growing up. I’m hoping he will be excited once he wraps his head around it.” Draco pauses thoughtfully. “I think Lily will be quite excited.”
Draco clears his throat and looks away from Harry. “So,” he says with a bright tone that sounds just a little forced, “what movie are we going to watch?”
“No, Harry. You really don’t look good. I can take the kids; it will be fine.” Draco’s voice is sympathetic but firm, and Harry knows he’s right. There’s no way he could handle Apparating right now, and he’s not entirely sure he could stand on the platform long enough to see them off.
“Nothing but my joggers fit. I can’t button anything. I tried these on—“ he holds up a pair of denims “—last weekend to make sure I had something for tonight, and now they don’t close.”
Draco leads them to a tiny hole-in-the-wall Italian bistro, just across the street from CRMM, and they settle at a small table against the front window, perfect for a bit of people-watching with their lunch.
“Brilliant,” said Harry. “I was starting to stress over having to re-cast warming charms every twenty minutes. Mine are such shit.”
“That’s exactly what the Queen said,” Potter said to Draco, worrying his lip. “This is happening so much faster than we thought.”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “You said this was an adventure. I was just thinking it’s been awhile since I was adventurous.”
That went straight through his heart like an arrow. Of course he’d never know this since he’d never be able to impregnate anyone and it wasn’t like there were magical orphans waiting to be adopted—magical children were too rare, too much of a commodity, for there to ever be need for an orphanage. “I know,” he growled.
“So hire a fucking house-elf to cater a full English. Then have it make me some fucking tea, since you’re determined to wake me up,” Draco said.
They put on some Bubblehead Charms (Hermione cast his), took their mobile out of their pockets, and ducked underneath the water, carefully directing the oysters to the seafloor. Hermione pointed to a nice rocky patch about thirty feet down and they sent them down, applying a light sticking charm to the bottom oysters. They could move if they wanted to, but it would give them good purchase until they decided to attach their suckers to the rocks beneath.
Harry shut up and ate. Ron returned a few minutes later with another well-proportioned Auror, and together they spell-cuffed him and led him up the private DMLE stairs to the Minister’s suite. Harry was pushed into a chair outside the Minister’s office and told to wait quietly. With two burly Aurors over him, there was little else he could do. He was stupid reckless sometimes, but not stupid enough to get Ron in trouble. That was the whole reason he’d allowed himself to get blackmailed in the first place, wasn’t it?
“Well, lucky for you, Gawain and I have,” said Ron. He raised his eyebrows significantly. Ahh, there it was. This was the part where Ron would remind him how he should’ve kept fighting for the Wizarding World.
“We could try a translation spell, but Mother speaks Mandarin,” Draco offered. “It’s the most widely spoken language in the world. Maybe we’ll have a better shot with that.”
“No, like we started to say in our press conference, we need help. We’ve adjusted the spell to use conduits to amplify our magic. We think we can use Muggle volunteers to be those conduits. If we get enough, they’ll amplify our magic enough to cover the earth.”
“Separation is the third operation,” said Draco, from the floor. His feet were propped up on the hearth, toes flexing in the warmth. The stone tumbled slowly in the air above him, catching the firelight and refracting it all over Harry’s sitting room. Somewhere behind him, Severia was making noise as she tried to catch the light.
Hermione narrowed her eyes. “Let the Ministry try it. They’ll have an international scandal on their hands and I, for one, won’t be blamed for something I didn’t even do.” She gave him a pointed look.
Ron threw himself back on the bed as if living were too much to bear. “Please tell me you’re having me on.”
Draco stood up so suddenly Harry took a startled step back. “I wasn’t worried, was I?” he said lowly. His eyes were flashing in a way Harry hadn’t seen directed at him in years and years.
It’s nothing like it used to be, before he was suspended, before he lost his partner. He doesn’t enjoy it anymore. He’s just sick with worry over Draco getting hurt and he’s determined to finish this to keep Draco from becoming one of those Auror casualties.
But Harry was selfish, really. It was a Gryffindor thing. And a Slytherin thing. And so he let Draco sleep, and watched him while he did. Severia crept in sometime later, hopping up to his open pants drawer to sleep, but still he couldn’t find sleep himself. Draco was in his bed, and Harry didn’t know how to handle that.
But eventually, they were done. The oysters were settled, and that was all they could do for now. They Apparated back to the Rover, casting several more cleaning spells over themselves and in their mouths and noses, and in the girls’ cases—their nether regions as well. Harry did not blame them. They still laid towels down on the seats before hopping back in the Rover.
Neither of the Slytherins had, of course, any idea whatsoever what Hermione was talking about, but did gather that it was a crime to do such a thing, and that Hermione was righteously indignant over the entire thing. On top of being dejected.
Harry frowned. “But I practise wandless magic in my room all the time, and I can never get it to work. Neville laughs when I try.”
And what did it say about him and the type of person he was that he got aroused by how offensive he found Potter’s personality? Draco supposed the tanned skin didn’t hurt—skin that had only darkened with age and access to sunlight. Or the jawbone, which, Draco could admit, was just as sharp and wide as it’d been in sixth year.
“On it, my liege,” Teddy echoed. They wound their way through the scurrying vendors and to the back door that opened onto the lawn and the coast beyond. Above them was a very dark, very heavy-looking sky. Teddy wrinkled his nose. “It’s totally gonna rain. Are they sure they wanna get married out here when it’s raining? Didn’t they not want to do their vows in the rain and that’s why we got to go to Gringotts instead?”
She paused, shook her head, and then came to take the visitor seat by his bed. He swore he heard something creaking when she sat down.
They don’t have much to talk about. Ron likes to watch the photographs of Hermione and the kids from long ago when she was young and vibrant and still complaining about pregnancy stretch marks on her hips. She swings Hugo around in the air, her hair flying everywhere, and that’s how Harry’s gut feels every Sunday afternoon when he gets back from the shops.
But that didn’t necessarily mean he had to play along. He narrowed his eyes. Ahead of him, to the left, stood a wardrobe. It glowed faintly blue from within. Ahead of him, to the right, stood a mirror, angled just far enough away that he couldn’t see his reflection.
“She has not helped us recently,” the Chieftess sniffed. “We do not know how to fix our waters. They grow dirtier and dirtier and we don’t have the right magic for that.”
Draco nodded. “Elias’ daughter Celestria married into the Blacks, incidentally starting the tradition of naming Black children after astronomical bodies. I came across Elias’ portrait after Father died and I came into my full inheritance. When I saw it, I knew something was special about it, but I couldn’t put my wand on it until a few years later. When Teddy turned five, the resemblance really started to show, and I knew he was meant to be my heir.”
That was Draco’s thoughts, too. He grabbed his nightclothes and a frivolous book he knew would take his mind off things, and they headed down.
“How’s work?” Andromeda was asking them. “Did you ever catch the person trying to steal Liesl Shacklebolt’s identity? I haven’t seen anything at all in the paper.”
Harry wrapped his hand around the back of Draco’s head and pulled him in, kissing him roughly and not giving a single fuck about it. He tongued Draco’s lips and moaned at the feeling of it, and when he felt Draco relax against him, he grinned in delight and spun them around, pushing Draco back against his own desk.
A Great Horned Owl swooped down on them like a bat out of hell as they turned into the alley. Harry nearly pissed himself in fright and Malfoy must’ve jumped a foot in the air. It screeched hurriedly and alighted on Malfoy’s arm. His face was a picture of alarm.
is it going to be?” Potter asked. “Millicent and Dudley are, like, perfect for each other, and you’ve got Scorpius—“
. He answered while still glaring at Harry. Harry put on as innocent a face as possible, modeled entirely after the face Teddy pulled when he’d been up to his worst shit-stirring.
for you. I thought you were using allure on me, but then you said you didn’t have any so I reckoned that must mean we’re definitely Mates—if I go wild for you without even allure. And anyway, who else would be your Mate if not me?”
He stopped before a display of custom burlesque headdresses, blinking. His students turned as one to stare at him with huge, startled eyes. Some were squishing fingers in their ears to ease the pressure, some pulling at earlobes. A muffled yelling came from his satchel and he realised belatedly that he hadn’t let Snape out yet. Well, he was going to have to wait a bit longer.
They must have descended four or five stories by the time the path levelled out. Murmured voices floated in, bouncing off the damp stone walls and echoing like thousands of whispers.
Draco looked to him, his lips twitching. “Yes, that about sums it up.” He straightened, and took a step towards Harry, and the lab. “Well, about that mince pie?”
He took another sip from his glass and found it empty. He grabbed the Ogden’s and topped them both off.
“May I introduce Helena Win?” Severus steps up beside me and introduces me to them. “She is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.” I see some of them glance worriedly at each other.
“What is it?” Severus is alert and looking around the room as if the Dark Lord himself were going to storm through the large oak doors and bring the castle tumbling down. I give a sharp shake of my head not able to speak or take my eyes off the two forms for more than a second. My mind is going a million miles a minute as I try to wrap my head around the stunning news, not knowing how I was going to be able to handle this kind of situation.
Draco furrows his brow before he answers and Harry can hear the effort to keep an even tone in his voice. “Yes. Not all exposure seems to cause it. Usually long term exposure or short but very intense exposure. And for whatever reason, it’s much more prevalent in witches.”
“Give me about fifteen minutes and I’ll be there.” Hermione shifts to back out of the fire. “I’ll see you soon!”
They pull apart, not looking away from each other until they both turn to Hermione and nod. She throws her arms around each of them in turn.
“Kind of. Lily also said something that sort of hit me hard. She said I’ve smiled more since they’ve been home than I did the entire month before they left. She said she and James are glad to finally see me happy.”
Harry is helping Draco set the pasta out on the island when footsteps come flying down the stairs. James rushes into the kitchen, tears falling down his face, phone pressed to his ear.
Harry tightens his hold on Draco for just a moment, hoping the squeeze expresses the comfort he’s trying to provide.
“Do you think Scorpius will be ok with that?” Harry isn’t sure how his kids would feel spending their holiday away from home.
“I will start seeing you every week from here on out.” She waves her wand and packs her bag. “If we make it four more weeks, I'll be very pleased, though I would prefer you make it all the way to thirty-eight. I see no reason you won’t, provided you take the discussed precautions.”
Draco’s voice is husky as he asks, and Harry nods his consent. Draco is almost reverent as he undoes Harry’s fly and slides the fabric over his hips, down his thighs, and to the ground. Harry warms not only from arousal but from having someone so…dedicated to taking care of him and making sure he is ok. That’s always been Harry’s job — taking care of everyone else. It’s wonderful to be on the receiving end.
One eye opens and suddenly Draco is suppressing a laugh. Harry fleetingly wonders what he finds funny as he rolls his hips experimentally. When he feels a rush of pleasure and no pain, he nods.
The visit to Wand and Wood had been very fruitful, and there was a team coming to set up most of the furniture they’d picked for the new addition later in the week. They had decided to carry home the carefully shrunken and lightened furnishings for the nursery, though.
“Something like that, I think.” Draco points to a ring, and Erwin immediately pulls it from the display.
Harry can’t help but grin as Healer Carr rearranges the blankets and lowers the drape, leaving Harry’s large abdomen exposed.
Draco gathers their bags, and Harry hugs each of their children in turn and then Hermione. “Aunt Hermione will bring you over when Regulus has been born. Draco will text with updates. I love all of you.”
“I’m fine.” Harry chastises himself for panicking and schools his features into what he hopes is a calm smile as he heads for the door, wine in hand. “Let’s go, then. What have you chosen for us?”
“Well shit.” Harry knows Draco well enough to know that on the other side of his rage is a deadly calm. It involves cool, calculated Slytherin-style cunning and revenge.
Harry extends his arm and feels the needle slip into his vein. Suddenly everything is swimming and his vision is closing in from the sides and everything he can still see is hazy.
Draco pulls Harry closer. The staff at St Mungo’s had let them transfigure the hospital bed to be big enough for both of them. Tonight makes the seventh night they’ve spent in it, but this one is proving to be particularly sleepless.
. Heading for his bedroom, Harry starts thinking about what he can change into so he won’t look scruffy next to Draco, who is always impeccably dressed.
Harry is setting a heaping plate of pancakes on the table when he hears the Floo activate. “In the kitchen,” he calls, summoning the syrup and a bowl of fresh berries.
“First off, we know he’s a carrier, and he’s in his first serious relationship. I’m pretty sure he and Matthew are going to be having penetrative sex soon if they aren’t already. He’s going to find out his dad is unintentionally pregnant. Teenage boys don’t usually have to worry about getting pregnant. I want to make sure he knows how to prevent pregnancy until he’s ready.” Harry shakes his head. “He’s also gay and about to find out way more about his father’s bedroom preferences with men than he probably wants to know.”
Harry wraps a leg around Draco and gently urges him to keep pressing in. Harry has never felt so full and he carefully schools his face to keep the discomfort from being obvious. Draco slowly rocks, just a little at a time, and inches forward. Harry can focus on nothing but Draco’s tongue in his mouth and his cock splitting him in two. He finally feels the brush of Draco’s balls against his arse.
“More than.” The warmth coursing into Harry’s body from where their palms touch brings him a feeling of contentment. This just
James whirls to face him, grapes forgotten. Harry looks past James into the living room where Draco stands, watching them with a contented smile.
“I am. But I’m not exhausted, not like I was.” Harry feels his temper bubbling, but he’s pretty sure it’s hormone-fuelled. It’s so frustrating not knowing what’s normal emotions and what’s pregnancy-related. “Healer Carr and Healer Powell both said I could work a light schedule.”
“Honestly, no. They’ve always made nasty comments about LGBTQIA+ issues. I can’t see them changing their minds.”
. He lays a hand over his swollen belly and feels it again. It feels very much like a tiny fish is flopping about.
“They are rather relentless.” Minerva shakes her head. “They were insufferable for several days after James and Mister McLelland were spotted as a couple in Hogsmeade.”
Harry’s internal monologue continues its raucous war inside his head. One side says to tell Malfoy, to let it out after eleven years. The other says to shove it back down in the dark corner of his soul inhabited by all the other losses he has endured; his parents, Sirius, victims of the war, Ginny. Telling someone — having someone besides Hermione who would know he really is completely alone now — is so tempting to Harry’s battered and lonely soul. And Malfoy has always been discreet enough with anything involving Albus.
“Draco, I don’t understand.” Lily’s brow is furrowed as her eleven-year-old brain tries to process this information.
“I’ll be around in the morning to check you over and hopefully send you packing. Someone will be in shortly to stop your anti-nausea and see how you do. Get some rest, both of you.”
The meeting with the solicitor was easy enough, and the office was sending someone over to Matthew’s parents today to see if they’d sign the appropriate paperwork. They could do a contested guardianship, but it would take much longer. Mr Stargell had been hopeful they would sign, and he could send the paperwork over by the end of the day.
“Of course. We talked about it more than once beforehand. And it wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago. Right before I wrote to you.”
“If he doesn’t go back to his parents’ home, we would need to get some sort of legal guardianship of Matthew,” Draco explains “That way if there is an emergency or you need medical attention, or there’s any other issue, we can be contacted and spoken to as if we were your parents. We’re going to contact our solicitor about how it would work.”
Breaking the kiss gently, Harry pulls back and takes in Draco’s wide pupils and kiss-swollen lips. Draco furrows his brows and Harry smiles.
Harry’s own throat catches and instead of trying to form words, he simply kisses Draco. Slow and lazy, they drink each other in, both relieved to be home with their baby safe.
“You’ll tell me if something is uncomfortable? Or you don’t like it?” Draco gazes at his eyes intently and waits for an answer.
Harry slowly takes inventory of his body. Nothing hurts, nothing seems off besides being tired and the residual feelings from all that vomiting.
Healer Powell continues to look confused. Harry heaves an impatient sigh. If he’s right, the increased nausea and fatigue are signs his own core is not going to hold out much longer.
“I’ve had a few partners since Astoria left. No one in the last several years, and certainly no one serious enough to introduce to Scorpius.” Draco’s hand skates across Harry’s skin affectionately as he speaks. “He is aware that I’m gay, but he’s never known me to be in a relationship. So it’s been quite a while since I’ve had a partner, as well.”
Harry feels Draco’s cool hand on his neck. He’s finally able to calm his stomach enough to slump against the seat, and he groans softly. He’s still just as nauseous as he was when he was jolted awake by the intense need to vomit.
Two hours later, Harry is propped up in bed with a small mountain of pillows, his husband next to him. Seeing Regulus in Draco’s arms fills him with an indescribable emotion.
“Hi, Hermione.” He smiles at the sight of his best friend. He loves being with Draco, but he has missed the time he and Hermione usually spent together.
“It sounds wonderful to me, too. I hadn’t necessarily thought about how soon we would be engaged.” Harry leans into Draco’s side. “I wouldn’t say no if you asked me right now, and I won’t say no if you ask me a year from now.”
The full weight of Draco’s body presses against him and they are both gasping and panting. Harry can’t remember ever feeling so…satisfied? Complete? Whole? He doesn’t even know how to label it, but it’s wonderful. Everything has slotted firmly into place and he would be content to do this with Draco, to do
“Or fingers, or tongues, or toys…” Harry laughs softly. “Or anything else that strikes your fancy, I guess.”
Harry tries but fails to keep his rage from rising and showing on his face. “Absolutely not,” he cuts in sharply. Harry’s teacup rattles as he sets it forcefully back on the table.
“Breathe through your nose. You only have to keep it down for a minute.” Draco’s coaching helps, and Harry breathes, willing his stomach to stay put.
Draco deepens the kiss and Harry obligingly opens his mouth, wondering if Draco can taste himself in Harry’s mouth. Harry finds himself on his back, being pushed into the mattress by Draco’s weight, tongue in his mouth, fingers in his hair, and a hand on his chest.
“Yes, the building is kind of like the Leaky. One side faces a Muggle area and the other faces a Wizarding neighbourhood.” Draco gestures to either side as he explains. “If we need something delivered from a Muggle establishment, we have a faux apartment there. The Muggle-side’s doorman is a Squib, so he puts the package in the faux apartment and our doorman comes in from the other side to retrieve it.”
Harry and Draco Side-Along the children to the Apparition point in wizarding London, and Harry steels himself for the stares as he laces his fingers with Draco’s and squeezes gently.
Draco’s genuine concern warms Harry’s heart. There may be a lot of bad things about today, but Draco here beside him, supportive and caring, is
“I went for something less traditional than a typical first date,” Draco says, a hint of uncertainty in his voice. “I really just wanted to be able to spend some time with you without the weird
“I’m happy with you — with us — you know. Actually happy.” Hardy glances up at Draco’s face and sees him smile.
“Pretty serious, James.” Harry smiles softly at his son. “I love Draco, and he loves me. We’re living together. Those aren’t things either of us take lightly.”
“No. You need to have words with your son; he won’t let me get comfortable. He’s determined to use my organs as pillows and punching bags.”
“Really?” Draco’s expression changes from concern to excitement as he crosses the room and perches on the couch next to Harry’s legs.
“It’s going to be awkward the first couple of times.” Draco’s eyes dance despite his serious tone and Harry wonders if he’s remembering their first time. “It might be uncomfortable until you get the mechanics right. It might also burn when you’re getting used to being stretched. But it shouldn’t hurt.”
“When we promised you we would take care of you, we meant just like all our other children,” Harry clarifies. “That includes university studies if that’s what you choose to do.”
Shock springs to Malfoy’s features. “I apologise if that wasn’t appropriate to ask,” he stammers quickly. “I just assumed…”
“You’re quite welcome. I think you’d do well in Healer Training, James. You’re welcome to owl and ask me questions any time.” James positively beams. “You look well, Mr Potter. I’m going to go ahead and lift your bedrest and other restrictions. I encourage you to keep taking it as easy as possible, but at this point, the baby and your body are ready when they decide they are ready. I’ll see you next Thursday unless the wee one decides otherwise.”
“And you will be older and have had more schooling, James,” Harry reasons. “Your Aunt Hermione says exactly what Draco says, and you know full well she wouldn’t say it if she didn’t mean it.”
“Then be glad your dad is a wizard and silencing charms are a thing. You won’t have to hear anything that may or may not be happening.”
“This section is our king-size bedroom suites.” Bernice gestures down the aisle. She waves her wand broadly over the section of furniture. “I’ll be nearby if you need me, just raise a hand and the charm will alert me.”
“The process for the spell is a little invasive.” Harry opens to a marked page that has line drawings of what’s necessary and turns the book to James. “You or your partner will insert the tip of your wand and twist gently anticlockwise. The incantation is
Draco heaves a nervous-sounding breath and sets his tea beside the couch, wrapping both arms around Harry. “I’m on the page where I’m a little nervous about how right everything feels, but I want this to be serious between us. And for the long term, if it keeps going so well. And somehow that’s scary, but also pretty great?”
“I want to be a Potter,” he blurts and looks at Draco, who nods encouragingly. “I want both of us — all of us — to be Potters. We should leave the Malfoy name and the awful things it stood for where they all belong — in the past.”
“We can figure that out together, yeah?” Harry smiles at the thought of helping Draco discover more of his own likes and dislikes. “What about blowjobs?”
“I know, love. I know.” Gentle hands smooth his hair as he writhes, his body attempting to somehow alleviate the pain as fluid gushes from his body.
He hadn’t felt the desire to be bonded to Ginny, to have their souls and their magic mingled together, and Ginny hadn’t either — they’d done a traditional wedding with a handfasting and vows instead. But with Draco, Harry wants every bit of himself entwined with the man he loves so very much. He wants Draco’s magic to pulse in his veins and
“I am, too. I think that’s why I feel off today. Healer Carr said everything looked great yesterday.” Harry is reassuring himself as much as he’s reassuring Draco.
“Reservation for Potter and Malfoy, for seven,” Draco tells the hostess. Harry nearly chokes on his laughter as the hostess’s eyes move from Draco’s face, to Harry’s face, to their joined hands, to the five children, eyes growing wider by the second.
“I can certainly understand why you’d be concerned about being exploited like that.” Draco sounds appreciative of Harry’s staunch opposition to being nothing but an icon. “What do you mean
“We’re thinking about adding a game room, at least one more bathroom, and a couple more bedrooms.” Draco eyes Hermione as he continues. “Possibly a library so we can get some of the books out of the study.”
“Yes.” Harry knows his first time bottoming was horribly painful, but he knows now, it never should have been that way. He would prefer James be spared that particular experience. “Both partners should be enjoying it.”
“I do.” Draco’s voice has no hesitation and no hint of uncertainty. “I want this, and I want this with you. And somehow, that’s the most insane thing I’ve ever said,
“But seriously, Harry, what’s the actual issue here?” The laughter is gone from Hermione’s face and she’s regarding Harry with a scrupulous expression. “Because we both know it’s not you being interested in a man, and I’m pretty sure we both know it’s not that the man in question is Draco Malfoy.”
Draco huffs a laugh. Harry turns his head to the side and opens one eye to look at Draco, who is sitting to Harry’s side, one hand on the small of Harry’s back.
Draco’s eyes widen in absolute horror and he covers one of Harry’s hands with his own as his words come tumbling out. “Fuck, Harry. I didn’t know. I’m so sorry. I’d never have brought it up so casually if I’d known. I didn’t mean to upset you.”
“They were what I am, but they had another mate. Unfortunately she died in an accident before I was born.” I look down, remembering the one time my parents told me about their lost mate. I know they both missed her and loved her with all their hearts.
“Anytime Miss just call.” She is about to disapperate. “Oh and Miss you should see the bathroom.” She smiles and winks before she disappears in the blink of an eye. Without a second thought I run to the adjoining door that I can only assume leads to the bathroom. I swing it open.
“Sorry!” She shouts back before turning to us all and giving us a wink, sending us into more fits of laughter.
“It us natural for me. As Granger said I inherited my creature blood and instincts at five years of age. It was painful at first, but now I relish in the pull of my magic and the intense change.”
“Yeah, just thinking about this past year.” My beta friend gives me a sympathetic look and nods his head in understanding.
“I have a habit of doing that lately.” I can’t help but give a slight smile as I see Harry throw back his head laughing at something Draco whispered in his ear.
“I look forward to see them try.” And with that our conversation has ended. It hurts to know that my beloved mentor is upset with me. But he knows that I have my reasons for keeping my identity from my mates, for now at least.
“Shit!” I still remember my mom going into heat every few months. Dad would call my aunts to take care of us, then sweep her up and lock themselves in their rooms for nearly four days. It had become such normality when I was growing up that I forgot all about it.
“You have until the Halloween banquet.” I shake my head about to argue with his words but his look silences me. “But first answer me a question.”
“Ah Severus and Miss Win I presume.” I give a nod, keeping myself from presenting my neck like my orientation calls me to do so willingly. “Well please have a seat.” She summons two smaller leather chairs and both Severus and I sit. I can see that she is assessing me over her glasses and I try not to twitch nervously. “Miss Win, Severus here tells me that you are looking to become the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.” I glance sideways at the man in question and he nods at me reassuringly with a small smile, his warm scent twirls around my nose and I find ease in the smell of old parchment and bitter potions.
“Yes ma’am that is why The Dark Lord targeted my family in the first place.” I sit forward and wait.
“Did she purposely just?...” Hermione is too flustered to continue the question, but we all know what she was about to ask. Was this woman poking fun at the self-righteous Professors?
“Malfoy I would ask you to watch yourself. I will warn you I am not too righteous to hex students.” I growl out but only get frustrated when he gives me a challenging look. This is what I hate about alphas; they don’t have a healthy sense of fear. I walk to the front of the classroom and bend down in his face, for just a second I am overwhelmed by his scent but I crush it down. “Now dear it’s not wise to challenge me. I have killed over much less.” I say it low enough for only him and Potter to hear, I back my words up with a small predatory growl that has them both looking at me in anger.
“My thing is, if she was a Death Eater why didn’t Draco ever mention her?” I curse at the logical thinking of my best friends. I send a look to my mate and see that he is engrossed in a conversation with Blaise.
“I have to be wrong! I must be wrong!” I growl out in a mumble, ignoring the fact that Severus is on the edge of his chair and probably going to grab and shake me if I don’t say something soon. Even as I say these words I know that I am not wrong, it is very clear that I have just found my mates, and that I can no longer avoid my fate. The thought now streaming through my head is why? Why do my mates have to be non other then an Ex Death Eater like myself and the Fucking Boy Who Lived…
“So which are you? An alpha, beta, or omega? It is actually very strange that we cannot scent you.” I balk at Potters question. Not expecting anyone to ask such a personal question. I quickly look around the room for an excuse to ignore the question. My eyes land on the time and I see that class has ended five minutes ago.
“So how do they find their mates?” The question makes me pause, but before I can answer Longbottom speaks up again.
“It was I who asked him why my house lost points on the first day. He wouldn’t have said anything otherwise.” I hate the bored voice of my mentor, and watch as he picks at his food without interest.“It seems that you managed to make him quite upset.”
“But Severus think about it. Me as a professor!” I huff as he shoves me up the staircase and toward the great oak doors.
“I should… but I won’t.” He sighs at my words but decides not to comment anymore as we walk down the big set of stairs before the great hall. I notice the noise level of hundreds of voices as students collect in the great hall and mill about the large doors, their scents hitting my nose like a brick. There are only a few dozen whom have presented, but their smells are still strong. I look to Severus and now see a cold mask in place and a mean smirk on his sharp pale face. I huff, knowing this look way to well, this is the look that he used when dealing with the Dark Lord or any of the other Death Eaters. The look of utter boredom mixed with annoyance. I have only seen him remove this ‘mask’ when it is just the two of us.
“Shove it Snape! I knew you could tell. Knowing you, you probably had it figured out from the very beginning!” My thoughts turn back to this morning when he asked me how I would feel about the possibility finding my mates at Hogwarts.
“Well you heard me. Off to bed.” I raise my voice as Draco lets out another growl, before taking Harry’s hand and dragging him down the hallway. “Oh and Boys.” I call out and watch them turn to face me. “It’s not nice to gossip.” With that I turn around without waiting for an answer storm off to my rooms ready for the night to end.
“Yes that is true. But it happens that there is a single witch with this inheritance that no longer lives within a pack.” I step between the aisles. “You see if Voldemort could harness the power of just one of those with this creature inheritance, he had a greater chance of winning the war. Not only are these individuals powerful creatures through their transformations, they are powerful witches and wizards.”
“Draco why didn’t you tell me about her?” I hear Potter ask accusingly as I struggle to evacuate the honeyed scent from my nose.
“Miss Win, I can turn a blind eye to you not wearing them in your class. But when you walk these Halls and join us for meals I expect you to have them on. Am I understood?” I turn my eyes downcast.
“Helena I was just coming to get you.” I jump as Severus joins my side when I make it to the bottom of the stairs leading to my rooms.
I feel a flutter of something I can’t explain as the tall blond leans down and places a kiss on the other’s lips before they part ways, one to the Slytherin table and the other one to the Gryffindor table. I am too preoccupied by the alphas to notice that Severus answered my question with a no. I am way to preoccupied to listen as the Headmistress greets the students with a speech then allows the first years to be sorted. The whole time this happens my eyes go back and forth between the two figures that have captured my attention. I gape as they laugh and watch the sorting with their friends cheering along with their house as first year after first year goes and sit at their new house tables.
“I understand this and will not ask you to do so.” I smile at her once again and she gives me a small one back. “Now onto another subject. I understand that you have in some way masked your presentation, and that you hold a special inheritance… somewhat creature related.”
“They were brilliant Hagrid! The students really seemed to enjoy the first day. Even though I suspect that it won’t last long when they see the curriculum I set up for them this year.” I shove chips in my mouth in-between every other sentence and am glad that Hagrid doesn’t seem offended by my bad table manners. “They have another thing coming to them if they think I will be easy on them just because I am younger.” Hagrid nods his giant head in approval.
“And so it begins.” Sev mumbles in my ear as I rush to catch up with him halfway through the room as he glides down a row and up to the teacher’s table.
“Malfoy! Potter! What are you doing out after curfew?” My voice is icy and I watch as the shake of the shock and step towards me with a growl in both their throats.
“Maybe not as powerful as our Mr. Potter. And if they are a omega then they are just a little less powerful then their alphas, but only by a fraction. That is why the omega’s alphas have to be very powerful wizards.” Once again the direction of the topic is getting me nervous and from the look in both Potter and Draco’s eyes their curiosity will take them closer to the truth. I fear that the only thing that is holding them back is my lack of scent and the blocked bond.
“I guess you can say I am a very rare form of Animagi. I can change into any animal form I please including magical and non-magical. My family was the last known pack left in the world. We are very territorial and are mostly powerful beings. We usually have multiple mates, as to help balance our Inheritance and power.” I pause to catch my breath.
“What Malfoy here has guessed and I am sure a few others have as well, I am not someone that you would have wanted to meet a year ago.” I move to my desk and hop up on it with ease.
“So not only do they have the pull of presenting like the rest of us, but they also have the pull of their creature inheritance?”
“I know a lot of you fought and lost loved one due to the war and I am sorry for that… But know this, I was not a willing participant. I did not choose Voldemort, he chose me because he saw me as a weapon to help defeat his enemy’s and did everything he could to make sure I was on his side.” My voice softens as I try to convey my sorrow to the eighth years, they had been through much at such an impressionable age. Glancing quickly at my mates I see that they to have softened expressions at my words, not expecting a form of apology from me. A hand raises and I turn to the waiting brown haired Alpha.
“I feel the same way love.” Draco sighs stepping up to his shorter mate and wraps his arms around him.
“Right! Well off to bed children.” I say in a singsong voice and watch as they all leave the room grinning at my playfulness. Severus doesn’t say anything as he leads me down into the dungeon and holds the door open for me to enter his cold office. He points his wand at the fireplace and instantly the hearth sparks to life.
“I expect the utmost out of my Professors.” Her eyes are sharp as she takes in my huddled form before continuing. “I expect that the display that happened tonight will not happen again.” The tone in her voice is one of finality and gives me very little room to argue, so I give her a nod.
“Thats a deep question for a shallow mind.” I sneer, the sharpness of my vice make a few of the students balk. Potters hackles rise and the Alpha starts growling, rolling my eyes at the boy, I say “Settle down, maybe in time you will come to know about why I am here. But I am not going to just dive into my physic just because some Alpha thinks I am the Big Bad Death Eater… Respect goes both ways Potter.” I let my words settle around the room and watch the unease slightly dissipate. Harry’s shoulders drop a little, but his icy green eyes are still boring into me.
“Ah yes the elusive Draco Malfoy. Do you know that the whole time I was a Death Eater I never met him? I met his parents but never him.” I look to my mentor and he gives me an amused look.
“Most Professors like us to take notes during lectures” She ducks her head at my look of mild irritation.
“Why would McGonagall allow her to step foot on the school grounds.” My heart gives a painful squeeze at the spite in Harry’s voice. It hurts me to know that he is swayed to judgment by just a fraction of my past. Closing my eyes I give myself a shake knowing that it is better this way. If they think of me as the killer I was, then I can feel better about deceiving them. I step out of hiding with a harsh look, and from the shock and guilt on their faces, they know I have heard what they said.
“Okay! I would say she is bloody brilliant after what just happened!” Ron says with a smirk and we all chuckle again at the stunt our new Professor pulled.
“What an interesting accent.” One of the betas come up and offers me his hand and introduces himself as Professor Flitwick. “American is it?”
“Anywho…” She says in a singsong way before sobering up and staring us down until we quite. “I am Professor Win, and I am to be your New Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.” I gasp along with a few other students at this news. Not in a million years had I thought this young woman would be the DADA professor, she looks to juvenile to actually know enough to be a professor in dark arts. “Got you there didn’t I?” She smiles happily at our shocked faces, and right before she turns away her eyes catch my own. As we stare at each other in those few seconds I have the strangest feeling that I know her, or that she is someone to me. But as quickly as it happens she breaks the contact and spins around going to take up her seat.
“That was quite an introduction tonight.” I shiver at Malfoy’s smooth accent, which makes my stomach give a flip and a flutter. I squash the feeling down and return the smirk.
“Back to the earlier conversation, yes Draco and his mate will be returning this year.” I raise my eyebrow in question because if I try to speak He would be sprayed with mashed potatoes. “Draco didn’t want to come back but his mate is dragging him along. His mate wasn’t here for their seventh year due to the war so he wanted to come back and finish it out.” I nod my head and we both drift into our own thoughts, listening to the talk and the chatter of the other teachers.
“Why in the bloody hell are you here then?” Potter says with a small snarl in his voice, I can see the defense in his eyes and it makes me feel small for just a second, before I brush it off.
“Very good Ms. Granger.” I praise once again and try not to let the discomfort of how close she is to the truth.
“I don’t quite understand why it matters what my orientation is.” I know my eyes are now golden in anger as I practically spit out the next words. “You boys have made it quite clear in you distaste for me.” I push at Malfoy’s chest and the growl he gives sends a shiver down my spin. I let out a deep growl of my own, not backing down in this pissing contest. “Besides it matters not, I have no scent… Did you ever think that means I might be a non-presenter?”
“Would you like to find out?” In a blink of an eye my wand is in my hand and aimed at the freckled youth.
Glancing around the empty office and give a sigh at the lack of décor, noting that in this next weekend I would have to add a few things to make it look a bit more comfy. I step through the big wooden door and move gracefully through the empty classroom. I have a feeling that I will enjoy teaching in this room. It has a beautiful way about it with the large arches, dragon skeleton, and darkened lamps hanging from the wall. In the darkness I feel as if it’s haunted… probably from Professors of the past. Severus had told me that in the last few years it had been hard to keep a Defense professor.
“Because Sev everyone hates Death Eaters. My record may have been cleared but that doesn’t stop the glares of hate we get on a daily basis.” We continue walking and I stare at the moving portraits, finding it humorous the way they go about their day-to-day lives one portrait to the next.
“Well ello I’m Hagrid.” I very big brute of a man stands up almost knocking over the whole table and grasps my hand in his giant one giving it a rough squeeze. I take in his scent and am quiet surprised to find that he is non-presented.
“Wait is she a professor?” At this last question I turn to the student who asked and give the dark skinned Gryffindor a wink before prancing up the steps and walking around the table to my chair in-between Hagrid and Severus. Headmistress McGonagall strides through the doors moments later with a tattered old hat in hand and the remaining students out in the halls follow her in and to their tables.
I watch as the Headmistress dismisses the students and the first years cluster together to follow their new perfects. Slowly the older students trickle out as well as do a few professors, all eager to make their way to their beds and rest before the coming day. My eyes slowly track the Malfoy boy as he stands up and waves farewell to his fellow mates. I suck in a breath as he catches me staring once again, his dark grey eyes boring into mine before I break away and look down at the now empty table. But temptation draws me once again and I find myself unable to resist the urge to take another glance. I watch the gentle smirk on his face as he stands behind Potter. I watch the loving way he runs his hand through the man’s messy black locks as Potter chats with his friends.
“This can’t be happening.” I want to bang my head against the table as I continue to sniff the sweet air of the two men. I can only feel a moment of relief that my own scent and bond is bound by the magic I placed on myself. For I knew if they were to smell my scent this would be a very different evening, one that would leave the student talking for a very long time.
“Um… a rat.” I roll my eyes at the lack of imagination. But I start the change anyway. The magic I am holding onto slowly starts to vibrate throughout my body and I feel the tingling sensation at I start to change forms, and in a pop I am on the ground looking up at the shocked faces of the eighth years. I scurry up to the front of the classroom and give a few squeaks for show. “That’s bloody brilliant!” Weasley yells as I easily change back.
“How kind of you for not leaving me to wonder another hour.” I snidely remark, still a bit peeved at the beta for not disclosing whom his Godson’s mate is. He rolls his eyes at my snarkiness as we make our way through the bright halls.
So yeah... It's been awhile. All I can say is COVID and online teaching keep me under at all times. Luckily we have a break soon and I hope to crank out a few chapters. This Story does not have a beta so I am sorry for any mistakes. Please enjoy.
I step out of my rooms refreshed from a nice long nap and a steaming hot shower. I glance down at my tight black dress showing through the part in my dark green robes. Shifting uncomfortably under their hot weight, never liking to wear the stuffy formal robes. I feel too confined in their suppressing folds. Most of the time I opt out of wearing them, but decided that since this is the first night with the students I thought it would be best to at least wear them this once. I slipped into a soft pair of silver flats before brushing my long auburn hair into large ringlets. To finish out the outfit I had quickly brushed on my dark mascara and painted my lips with a lovely shade of red.
“I am hoping sooner then later Hermione.” I state before turning back to the front of the great hall as Headmistress McGonagall steps back up to the winged podium.
I try not to think about my mates and the disgust that had been dripping in Potter’s voice last night. Telling myself time and time again that it didn't matter what he or Draco thought, I did what I had to do to protect my family. It was better that they dislike me anyway, it will help me keep them at an arms distance and less of a chance for them to figure out who I was to them.
“Dad said that she was part of the Dark Lords inner circle.” I hear Potter’s sharp intake of breathe. “It gets worse…” Draco pauses and I see the black haired Alpha nudge his mate to continue. “Dad said that if You Know Who ever wanted one of his victims to have a slow death she was the one to do it… Not only that Mum said that she is some rare form of creature. That she can turn into any animal imaginable, magic and non-magic. So naturally Voldemort used her as a spy and for his impossible missions.” I see my blonde mate shiver in a moment of weakness and know he is thinking about the impossible missions Voldemort loved to send us on.
“Well look at the time! I can’t have you all being late for your next class.” I flippantly wave my arm in a gesture of departure then spin around, listening as the students pack their bags and shuffle out of the room. As the door shuts I give a sigh of relief and turn to the front of the room only to feel a deep since of dread as I see Potter and Malfoy standing near with their eyes on me. “Something amiss boys?” I ask in a fake cheery voice.
“My name is Winnie. Master Snape sent me to help you find your rooms.” I grin widely as I think fondly of my sometime peevish mentor.
“Uh… n-no Professor.” The poor boy is stuttering and has gone dreadfully pale. Pleased with the reaction I tuck my wand back in my robes with a loud laugh.
“Professor Win.” My heart drops to my stomach as I turn to the angry Headmistress, thinking I would prefer to be reamed out by Sev then this irate alpha.
“I will not let my Godson and his mate suffer!” There is a sound of finality in his voice and I feel as if I am doomed.
This is a slightly longer chapter, and a lot of it is fill in for Helena's Inheritance. I hope you all enjoy it! It may be a hot second until I am to post again. School is back in full swing and teaching online is a bitch. I have no Beta so I apologize for any mistakes.
“You know who she is don’t you?” Hermione turns towards me eagerly. Ron, Ginny, and I shake our heads and then lean in along with half our year waiting for her to enlighten us. “Didn’t you read the papers after the final battle?” Hermione looks at us in frustration.
“Out with it already.” Ron mumbles through a mouthful of roast, drawing the attention of more Gryffindor’s.
Hermione, Ron and I give a great shout as a little eleven-year-old blond gets sorted into our house. The whole table is roaring and banging on the table as the rest of the students from the other houses give a polite clap. I can’t help but give a whoop of joy for being back at Hogwarts with the people I love. In a way I feel lighter, not having to be consumed with the thoughts of Voldemort and the threat he always had over my head. My heart is bursting at the moment and I give a sigh of content.
“You are not going to out me Snape!” I am in a rage, wanting to punch his beak like nose, making it bloody.
“Yes Sir. Lived there most of my life, when the war begun I traveled back and forth.” Some of the professors froze at my mention of the war.
“Honestly I really couldn’t tell you that Headmistress. I mean I have a ton of experience because of the war and all. I may have been on the wrong side of the war, but that gives me more insight. Don’t you think?” I say, looking up into her eyes for the first time in a sort of challenging way. Her back stiffens at the remark and challenge and I can scent the alpha getting weary.
“Come on, the name must be familiar to you…” When we all continue to start at her blankly she shakes her head with a very Hermione like sigh. “Helena Win! She is or was a Death Eater. Some say that she was part of Voldemort’s inner circle.”
“Is he coming back this year then? Given that the war was going on during his seventh year.” I haven’t been paying attention to where we have been walking so it is a surprise to me when we walk into the great hall. I look around that the huge room laughing with glee as the ceiling reflects the sunny sky. The long tables were in place and I watch as benches zoom by in their perspective places. I glance up at the raised dais where the long table was beginning to fill with other staff members. The smell of beta is heavy in the air, but I caught a twinge of alpha and even omega. As Severus and I step into the hall a few of them go quiet and eyeball us suspiciously. I roll my eyes and heave a great sigh much to Severus’s amusement. We walk briskly down the long rows and I skip up the steps.
“Did you?” I ask sweetly walking around them to stand by my desk, my eyes harden at the challenge I see in my alpha.
“Ravenclaw!!!” The brown sorting hat yells in it booming voice and I absent-mindedly clap along with the rest of the hall.
I feel it to Harry, but for now just eat some food before you faint. I roll my eyes at his exaggeration.
“We were on our way back to our room Professor.” Potters voice is just as cold as mine, his vibrant green eyes take in my ridged posture.
“That is my Godson you are talking about Helena.” His voice is filled with a warning growl. “You need to tell them. Stop hiding your scent and closing off your bond.”
“ I believe there are two families left in all the world, one in America and the other in India.” Granger says.
“I am sorry for what happened to your family. But I am glad you had a mentor such as Severus.” I lean back in my chair and give her my first honest smile, finally showing peace to the alpha as she speaks these words.
As I eat I take the time to watch the students. Many of them are talking animatedly as they enjoy their meals, there are a few who look sick but I see that they are most of the younger students who are probably homesick. Looking down I notice Granger with her nose in a book and watch as she writes notes down on some parchment every so often. The young Alpha seems entranced by what she is reading and from what Severus has told me she is a bit of a know-it-all. It’s then that a swirl of aromas tickle my nose and I look up slightly to watch my Alphas saunter into the Hall with the swagger of older students who know their place in life.
“No.” I squeak. “No… Damn it! You did this on purpose!” I turn on him. “Two months to tell them, and two months till my first heat… Either way they will find out and I will be screwed.” The smirk on his face tells me that I am right and I flex my fingers as the inner voice in my head begs me to curl them around his neck and squeeze.
“Is something amiss?” Severus leans in, his own sour scent of harsh potions blocking the honeyed fragrance and shaking me out of the heavy haze.
“I don’t have any and I wont have any!” I snarl with conviction. “Now get out of my classroom before you two find yourself in detention for flaunting you ‘dominance’ at a professor.” My lip curls at the word dominance.
“Let the feasting begin.” McGonagall says in a haggard voice and we all give a cheer as the food appears before our eyes. I throw a glance at Draco and see that his eyebrows are still wrinkled in confusion.
“And why is that Miss Win?” I rub my hands on my jeans underneath my dark green robes, trying to calm my heart and clear my head.
Suddenly my nose goes into overdrive as an attractive scent fills my nostrils and makes me moan in content. Wanting to huff it in more I subtly change my senses to that of a wolf, allowing me to inhale the sweet smells curling in the air around the hall.
“Introduce yourself and state what you are teaching.” McGonagall looks absolutely furious as she coldly tells the confused Professor what to do.
“It won’t last long though.” Severus states and I turn to look at him in questioning. “Don’t forget my Dear you are the omega. I doubt your alphas will take you sassing them lightly.” I shiver at the meaning of his words before shooting him a glare.
“No.” the giant says. “Yous will ave ta see fur yourself.” I glare at him and he just grins stupidly.
“Well Professor whats-your-name, Yes I was a Death Eater. One day Voldemort showed up on my parents doorstep, he gave my parents an option join or die. I then had to watch as he killed them before my eyes, he then gave me the same choice. I chose to die, but then he threatened my pack and had my three-year-old sister dragged out of bed. He was going to kill her, so I chose to become a Death Eater to save my loved ones.” I search the shocked and pity filled faces of my fellow staff members. I turn back to the mumbler and glare. “So tell me. Would you just watch your loved ones and baby sister die?” She sat there with a guilty and shame filled look.
“Oh don’t worry about it Ronnie, I have been asked worse.” The boy’s ear tips turn bright red and the others laugh at my antics. “Now if I am not mistaken you all have a curfew to make and Professor Severus has mentally prepared a very tedious lecture to berate me with in his office.”
“Well, I became a Death Eater at the ripe age of seventeen. For those of you who would like to do the math, that was months after Potter saw the Dark Lord rise again, making me now 21 years of age.” I watch the mixed reactions of the students ranging from shock, anger, and curiosity. I slowly roll up the sleeves of my sweater allowing them to see the dark mark on my forearm.
“Hello Professor.” The girl named Granger says. Before I can stop myself I roll my eyes at the title and watch as Snape, Potter, and Malfoy smirk.
“As I have said I am very powerful. I have a spell around me at all times. It is masking my omega scent and the mental link from them. I can tell that they have already found each other, and I know that they feel my missing presence.” I suddenly feel shame but crush it down.
“Wait. Is Draco’s mate one of the golden three?” I finally connect the dots and turn to a smirking Severus.
“How do you know they will hate you for being a Death Eater?” His question, though logical, is stupid.
“No. I didn’t want to get into it right now.” She nods at my reason before taking a bite of her food. “But I will be sure to find out.”
“Thank you for your back story.” Headmistress McGonagall walks up behind us and places her hand on my shoulder, her scent filling my nostrils and bringing me calm. “Now I expect each and everyone of you to treat Miss Win with respect. That means you Sinistra.” I smirk as the beta that talked out to me ducks her head at the stern alphas words. “She has come here to start over, like many of you who have lost so much due to the war.” And with that the conversation was over. I immediately saw a change in most of the faculty’s attitudes and more of them greet me with warm if not pity smiles. Severus leads me around the table and offers me a chair towards the middle of the table two seats from the Headmistress. Severus sits between us and leans in to speak with her for a moment. I turn to see that I am sitting next to the giant and watch as he starts to devour a chicken practically whole. I turn to the food on the table and start placing spoonful’s of corn, mashed potatoes, and chicken onto my plate. I am halfway through my plate when Severus finally turns back to me.
“Today I will see how much you truly know about magical creatures.” I smile at the girl. “Obviously you all know of Amagi. They are witches and wizards that can change their features, for amusement or for protection.” I pause to see them nod their heads in understanding. “Well there is a rare form of creature inheritance that coincides with that of an Amagi. This creature inheritance doesn’t have a textbook name, but you can just call it shape shifting. Does anyone know what I am talking about?” Granger’s hand is the only one in the air. “Go on.” I nod to her.
“Oh right!” The lovely woman claps her hands and faces us all with a smile. “I am ‘Professor’ Helena… wait Son of a B…”
“Yes Headmistress.” I state and I see the small smile one her face as she listens to my very pronounced American accent, I can smell her scent come to life as she shifts in her chair, trying to take up less space and not seeming so dominate.
“So Professor.” I look to the blond alpha. “Why tell us about this creature?” I see a leer on his face and know that he already knows why.
“Sit.” He doesn’t ask but demands and I am reminded of when we first met. The Dark Lord had thrust me into his care with a dark sneer and with an order to make me a killer.
“As if I would roll over so easily Sev. My ‘Alphas’” I hiss out the word. “Are sure as hell going to have a hard time taming me. You know it’s not in my nature to play the innocent one.” My voice holds a reminder of all the times that I have killed and tortured for the Dark Lord. The times that Severus and I had ended up dueling each other because of something we had said. He knows very well how hard it was to get me to behave and act like the young lady I am. By the time Voldemort handed me over to be trained by Sev I was on the verge of true darkness, It was Severus who brought me back from the ledge and made me see the dim light in the utter darkness that Voldemort had used to warp my mind.
“I am sure that you all have heard bits and pieces about what I am talking about today. But you should be honored by the fact that I am going to add in the R rated bits that I devolved from telling the younger students.” I pause to allow them to take it in. I am slowly walking around the room and find that their eyes are constantly following me.
“Who is she?” I hear whispers all around the room as I follow the imposing man with an easy grace. Scenting the room I am comforted with the large amount of betas in the room only here or there do I scent an alpha in the students and I glance at the smell of two omegas huddled together at a table.
“That would be wonderful!” I clap my hands together and Winnie starts down the hall with me quick on her heal. I find that I wasn’t far off my mark as we take a few turns and up a flight of steps.
“I don’t want to hear it Severus.” I growl as I see the look on his face and start stalking down the portrait filled hallway.
“I am not. You are.” He seems to have more control on his anger then I do, and I can’t help begrudge him for this.
Sorry guys, I am living the Covid teaching life and get busy. Here is the next update, be patient with me!
“I had an inkling… I bit more then an inkling actually, given that your eyes were golden for half the time.” He leans back in his chair. “Now what are you going to do?”
“You okay mate?” Ron nudges me and I give him a small smile, reminding myself to be happy, for I was back at Hogwarts.
“You will survive.” It doesn’t… Huffing I slowly stand up and follow him around the table before a firm hand on my shoulder stops me.
, it inevitably means he’s about to navigate some treacherous parenting territory. Lily, having only known Harry’s open and honest parenting style, has no shame in asking him the things she wants to know or telling him exactly what she’s thinking.
Draco kisses back willingly and Harry can’t get over how, every time he’s kissed Draco this last few weeks, it’s just as amazing as the first time. He feels Draco’s tongue run against his lips and willingly parts them. Harry moans softly and deepens the kiss further. Though they’ve had lunch together daily at work and gone to dinner a couple of nights, there hasn’t been nearly enough time for
Harry heaves his body once again and shifts to his other side. It’s sometime between midnight and sunrise and he simply can
Harry sighs softly. “I’m still scared. Being pregnant is overwhelming at best and terrifying at worst.”
“That’s what the Healer said.” Harry finds himself unable to hold back his tears and they spill over, rolling down his cheeks. Draco draws him close again and wraps warm arms around him.
Heading to the street, Scorpius and Albus come with Harry and Draco while James and Matthew take Lily. Making their way into Wand and Wood, Harry spots Bernice behind the service counter again.
Last night had been wonderful. He and Draco are certainly as dynamic and compatible in the bedroom as they have found themselves to be outside of it, and Harry finds himself wanting to wake up like this every morning, not just today. He has been afraid it would feel uncomfortable, waking up next to someone again, but instead, he is comforted and…happy. Harry chuckles lightly to himself at the thought. Draco Malfoy makes him
When Harry can’t walk through the pain anymore, they return to the house. Draco’s soft hands and smooth voice never waiver, supporting his husband through every pain. He feels like he’s literally being ripped in half every time a contraction hits, but he clings to Draco — to his voice, to his touch — to help him through.
When a hand lands lightly on his shoulder again, Harry shifts back from the Magiscope and finds himself in very close quarters with Claire.
“Morning,” Draco mumbles, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry chuckles. Draco is nearly non-functional before caffeine if he doesn’t get enough sleep, and they’d been up late the night before. Harry reaches over and plucks a mug of coffee from the countertop and presses it into Draco’s hands.
, he’s missed this. Draco has taken brilliant care of him through everything, but there’s nothing that can take the place of
Hermione lifts her beaded bag, which Harry is sure contains all their shrunken and lightened trunks.
James, Albus, and Lily step forward from behind Harry, handing Draco’s wedding ring to Minerva, followed by Scorpius from behind Draco, who passes over Harry’s.
Under the hot stream of the shower, Harry resumes his exploration of Draco’s mouth between shampoo and soap. Draco’s hands slip to his hips and pull him closer. Hard cocks rub together and desire jolts through Harry. The buzz in his mind that had been there in the locker room returns.
“You’re twenty-nine weeks, so that sounds about right.” The Healer conjures her usual table and lays out her equipment. “I am a bit concerned about the hip pain and the increase in pressure, so let’s see what’s going on.”
Harry neatly folds the dishtowel, places it on the counter, and follows the swell of the music into the living room. The fire is crackling, and Harry notices that Draco’s pushed the couch back and moved the coffee table aside. Draco turns from setting down a bottle of wine and steps towards Harry as he comes in.
“I am. We have imaging photos to show you if you’d like to see.” Harry smiles at Scorpius before turning his attention to Al.
“Well, no. We took a walk down to the pitch when dinner was in the oven. I gave him a locker and he said we should play a Seekers’ game next time. Turns out he’s a Puddlemere supporter, too.” Harry chuckles again. “And we chatted over dinner. He’s quite easy to talk to. He truly understands what it’s like being a single father. I’ve never had someone who really gets that, you know?”
Harry blindly offers his hand to the Mediwizard next to him, who guides his hand between his legs, placing it on something warm and wet and sticky.
Harry waves a hand at the door to the lab. He waits to hear the door click shut and lock, then buries his face in Draco’s neck. Draco smells like home. Arms hold him tightly and he takes a moment just to breathe.
“Will you be all right if I leave you long enough to wake Scorpius? There’s some at the flat and he can go and fetch it.” Harry can tell from his tone that Draco is hesitant to leave him at all. He wonders how bad he must look for the normally calm man to be this worried.
“No.” Harry’s voice is firm. Absolutely nothing that could exit the Healer’s mouth would make him want to go through this without Draco. He squeezes Draco’s hand tightly and feels the returning pressure, finding it comforting. “Draco is my partner and my fiancé; I would prefer he be with me.”
“Yeah, someday. Matthew and I were talking, and he said that was one of the hardest parts of coming to terms with his sexuality. He realised he couldn’t have biological kids with his partner because he’s gay. Not a lot of wizards can carry and not many of the ones who can are gay. I’m lucky. I can have a family with my partner, and I want that someday.”
“I’ve enjoyed that, as well.” Harry smiles, remembering. “I like being touched just about anywhere but my armpits and my feet.”
"Oh, Harry," Hermione bursts out laughing, no longer able to hold it together. "You thought I'd be upset?"
A couple of moments and some deep breaths later, Harry stands upright. James watches carefully until he’s sure his father is steady on his feet, then releases his waist.
One hand releases its hold and there’s a pause before Harry gasps as the pad of a finger touches his hole. Draco’s tender circular motions are surely meant to help him relax, but in reality, they only make Harry more aware of how badly he wants Draco’s fingers inside him.
“Push gently for me, Mr Potter. Like you were having a bowel movement, until I tell you to stop, please.”
“Merlin, yes,” Draco breathes. “I’ve never used toys on someone else.” Draco’s eyes go a bit unfocused and Harry wonders if Draco’s mind is where his has gone. All he can think about is Draco stretching him wide and sliding a dildo in his arse.
Hermione looks away from her breakfast and Harry watches her scrutinise his expression carefully. “Now, what on earth has got you so worked up? You’re never awake this early on a Saturday.”
Draco turns from sliding the last dresser drawer shut. “I agree. Can you believe we only have three months before we get to meet our son?”
“Likewise, Headmistress.” Harry grins at her before turning to the kids. “Everyone okay?” Four heads nod in reply.
When Draco finally pulls away, Harry’s a bit surprised to see his partner’s face tracked with tears. His inquiring look is met with a slightly embarrassed shrug.
“I can’t wait,” Harry answers truthfully. He reaches into his robe pocket and withdraws a small box. “Here, James. Don’t lose it.”
The planned dinner has been abandoned in favour of takeaway from their favourite Chinese restaurant, and the six of them are stretched out in the living room in front of the telly, finally eating a late dinner. The kids are all absorbing and processing the news at different rates, but Harry and Draco have been diligent in encouraging them to ask questions and take their own time to think things over. Albus, at least, finally seems convinced that Harry is not actively dying.
Draco tightens the arm he has around Harry. “Partner,” he says softly. “I’d like to call you my partner.” Warmth spreads through Harry’s chest. Not only does Draco feel the same way he does about the seriousness of their relationship; he has also chosen a label that carries a lot more weight than “someone I’m dating”, or maybe even “boyfriend.”
“That they can, son.” Harry agrees, rolling his eyes. “Come on, let’s not keep your young man waiting. We told him 11 o’clock.”
“That’s the beginning of your womb. Your magic knew you conceived and worked to form a place for the baby to develop.” She directs her wand at a slightly different angle. “And there—” she points to a white bean-shaped area within the dark circle,” —is your baby.”
“I love you, too, Draco.” Harry’s half-closed eyes fill with tears. He’s completely petrified that something will go wrong and this will be the last time he sees Draco.
“My congratulations! And I do think you’ll be fine for Saturday. I think you’ve got a couple of weeks yet.” Harry groans as she spreads imaging potion on his stomach. He is truly tired of being pregnant.
“Enough about my work.” She places the food on the table and sits down as they all dig in. “How was your appointment today?”
much about his appearance. He never had when he was dating several men after the war, and he certainly never had with Ginny. There’s just something different about this date with Draco.
“Something like that.” Harry laughs. If only Draco knew how much he was the catalyst for Harry’s procrastination. “But writing to you was far more interesting than anything I found in the Prophet today.” Harry sobers and sighs softly.
Harry smoothes his ruby red dress robes over his abdomen and looks himself over in the mirror. Even heavily pregnant, the robes fit him perfectly. Of course, they do. As if Draco would have had ill-fitting robes for their wedding, no matter how small.
Draco leads him by the hand into their bedroom, stopping Harry so he’s facing the mirror. Standing behind the pregnant man, Draco leans over to place a soft kiss behind his ear, hands moving to his collar.
Harry’s heart aches for his friend, and he squeezes her hand lightly. Harry can see the pain on Hermione's face and can't help but feel partially responsible, or maybe even guilty for its presence. “Do you ever regret telling him you wouldn’t choose?”
“You absolutely do not!” Draco sinks back into the chair. “I’m sorry, Harry. I know it’s going to be hard for you.”
He watches as Albus processes this information and relief washes over him as Al cracks a tiny smile.
“Well, evidently she doesn’t know you’re pregnant yet.” Draco gives a devilish chuckle. “Perhaps I shall write back and let her know.”
Draco obliges and Harry feels Healer Carr’s fingers twist and press inside his body, but he’s completely distracted by the wonder on Draco’s face.
“Yeah.” James looks at Harry’s stomach and then back to his face. “How does it feel to be pregnant?”
and Harry sees his lips quirk at the title. “You can read it this weekend, then you can leave it here or take it back to Hogwarts. But read over the section about using toys alone or with a partner. If there’s something you want, we’ll get what you need.”
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy. Hello, Mr Potter. Welcome to CRMM. Mr Mason is ready for you; right this way.”
“The Committee for Wizarding Welfare meeting was fine. When we tried to meet with the Wizengamot members to talk about making actual changes, though, everything went sideways.” An exasperated sigh punctuates her plating of the food. “They’re fine with the ideas, but they refuse to put any money behind it. I don’t know how they expect us to make life better for people without any money.”
It only takes an hour for the entirety of the nursery to be arranged and the massive stash of baby supplies to be put away or displayed. Harry, feet now elevated on the matching ottoman, looks over each detail; the silver stars on the mobile, the lamp shaped like a moon, the tiny blanket with stars that match the walls.
“Absolutely,” Harry nods. “We’re very open about pretty much everything in this family, so if James wants to learn, that’s fine.”
Harry scoots off the bed and retrieves the shoebox-sized wooden box from his wardrobe. In it are the toys and condoms James has requested. He sets the box on the dresser so Draco can add the potions before poking his head into the hallway and calling for James.
“He has, but nothing is wrong,” Harry smiles. “He had something important to discuss with me, and he’d like to share it with the rest of you. Go on, Scorp.”
Draco cries out as Harry’s arse pulses around him and then he’s moving faster and deeper and harder until his thrusts become erratic.
“Have you started doing any research on male pregnancy?” Hermione leans forward eagerly and Harry shakes his head.
“Of course. One tiny silver lining of being in the hospital.” The Healer’s wand appears to siphon the image from the bubble and drops it onto photograph parchment. These, unlike others they’ve gotten, show the baby moving.
Harry hunches over his Magiscope in the Department of Dark Magic Damage Research lab. Eyes pressed to the eyepiece, he stares intensely into the dark box and studies the streaks of light that each indicates a different piece of magic at work on the magical core imaged in front of him. He lifts his wand and gently peels away the layers he knows to be benign magic, then huffs softly with released tension as they pull away easily and aren’t entangled with the darker magic he can see in subsequent layers.
“I am really not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow,” Draco says as he organises his sweaters in his new dresser.
“James?” Harry keeps his voice soft. James turns to look at him and Harry can see that he’s quite unsettled. “Are you all right?”
“Being with you will help. I always avoid the celebrations and the general public, but spending the day at home with you sounds wonderful.”
“Well, that won’t be an issue after tomorrow.” Harry takes a breath. “I’d like to discuss more about what your parents said. Would you prefer to have James here for that.”
The new bedroom closest to the master suite is to become Regulus’ room, and Harry is getting rather antsy to have a nursery ready for their son. At twenty-three weeks, he knows he’s approaching the time frame where most male pregnancies end up on bedrest, and he wants everything ready and settled in the new part of the house before that happens.
“Thanks, Hermione.” Harry smiles at her and she nods, following the children up the stairs. He looks back at Draco, who seems a little harried.
“Good. The issue is that I’m finding that…” Harry pauses and heaves a deep breath, grasping the pillow and twisting it in his hand. “…that I’m finding myself rather attracted to you.”
“We haven’t really decided.” He smiles at his fiancé. “Draco and I will be together for the long run no matter when we get married. We’ll figure out what’s right for all of us.”
“I’m so proud of you, son,” Harry says softly in his son’s ear. He releases James and looks to Matthew.
“I haven’t dated in the nearly twelve years since Gin died. I’ve focused on the kids. I’ve been lonely,” he pauses when Hermione’s eyes narrow, “…romantically speaking. And it was what was necessary for us. And I wasn’t looking for anyone when Draco asked me for tea. But Hermione…”
Slowly stroking his cock, he pulls one knee up and reaches behind himself. He rubs one lubed finger over his entrance and gasps at the sensation. He’s not done this in a very long time and had forgotten just how good it feels.
“I do have my solicitor up to speed with the situation. We can have letters sent or action taken if you feel it’s ever warranted,” Draco tells Minerva.
Harry looks up from his seat on the couch when he hears the “pop” of Draco’s apparition. Harry stands and gives Draco a quick kiss.
Harry hears Draco moving and a few moments later, the curtain shifts, Draco joining him under the spray.
“I never know with those three. At least it means they should be okay with everything when we tell them. I do think we may need to have a talk with James over the break, though. It sounds like he and Matthew are getting more serious.”
Harry loves watching Draco’s absolute joy at seeing that image in the bubble almost as much as he loves seeing the baby himself.
“Nnngh.” Harry can’t bite back his moan as Draco’s finger slides inside. “Yes, Draco. Godric, I love having any part of you inside me.”
“We took another core imaging before we brought you ‘round. It looks good. Your core is awfully powerful, Mr Potter. I think it saved you both.”
“Yes. Both my biological sons are carriers.” Harry stumbles over his words as he tries to process what he’s being told. “We were told it came from the Weasley side of their genetics. Almost all of the males in the family are carriers.”
Harry bolts from bed and dashes for the loo, making it just in time to empty the contents of his stomach into the toilet. Even after there’s nothing left, he continues to retch, stomach still churning.
“People like all kinds of things, I suppose.” Harry shrugs. “Do you have preferences for penetration?”
Draco stands, wide-eyed, and looks around. The large room is bright and covered in posters of Quidditch players, team posters, and other memorabilia. Along the wall opposite them, past a long row of benches, is a bank of large lockers decorated with insignia and colours of various Quidditch teams. Draco steps over to one end and runs his hand along them. “These all have names?”
Harry isn’t sure if Draco means orgasms or otherwise, but he nods into Draco’s neck. “Ok. Yeah…ok.” Harry’s finding it incredibly reassuring to have someone taking care of him. He’s always been on his own or been the caretaker, but this…this having someone looking at him and knowing his needs and taking care of them with no expectations of reciprocation…makes him feel wonderful and cherished and…loved.
“Not yet. I don’t feel like I need to push, it’s just…there’s no way to ever be prepared for this. I can’t even describe it. Suddenly this little body I’ve kept safe for nine months…my body’s goal is to expel him at all costs. I know it’s how we get him into our arms, but it’s just…”
“Your pregnancy appears viable, and you’re right where you should be for four weeks along. Your body is also doing a proper job of adapting.” The Healer removes her gloves and turns her attention back to the two men. “Now, what questions do you have?”
And then Harry can feel it. There, thrumming along his own magic, is Draco’s. It’s like an echo, just a soft reminder that he is bound to the one his soul loves.
“Yeah. It was after midnight by then. But when he left, I saw him out and there was this odd moment. We just looked at each other and we were standing quite close in the entry.” Harry loses himself in the memory for just a second. “I really thought he might kiss me, but then he just put a hand on my shoulder and thanked me for a wonderful evening and…left.” Harry’s shoulders fall, remembering that weird empty feeling he’d had when the door had clicked shut behind Draco.
“We’ll make time for what any of our children need this weekend. I do hope, in the end, they’ll all be okay with gaining a new sibling. If they’re as happy as we are, it will be an added bonus.” Draco kisses Harry gently. “I know getting the kids to come around may be a challenge, but having a baby with the man I love is worth every bit of it.”
“Excellent.” Draco places a hand on Harry’s shoulder and squeezes it lightly. “I’ll go find us some wine to go with dinner.”
“I’m glad to have you home. And we’ll figure out how you can see Mina. Draco will have to take you, though. Or Aunt Hermione.”
Harry bends to sign his name below Draco’s and his breath hitches. There, signed on the parchment in elegant penmanship is “Draco A. Potter” and somehow seeing it on paper for the first time makes it that much more real. He and Draco are
Returning his fingers to his hole again, he neglects his throbbing erection and focuses on stretching himself as open as he can before he rolls over to his stomach. Getting on his knees, he cants his arse in the air and reaches up behind himself to grasp the waiting dildo, guiding the large blunt head to his entrance.
After two cups of coffee and some food, Draco is much more coherent and awake. He grabs Harry’s plate as well as his own and carries them to the sink.
Draco kisses him softly, shutting the door behind himself, and Harry hauls himself off the bed to undress. He shucks his clothing, save for his pants, and turns sideways to the mirror again.
“Albus! Let me finish,” Harry sighs. He has no idea what scenarios are playing out in Al’s head, but he’s certain they’re all catastrophic. “I’m still ill, but I’ve been seeing a Healer, and I will be fine eventually, but—”
“This is typical in male pregnancy. He only has nine more weeks; the baby is growing and running out of space. If he makes it to thirty-three weeks, which is the equivalent to thirty-five in a witch’s pregnancy, we won’t stop labour if it starts. But your little boy really needs these next four weeks for lung development and growth, so I’d rather take precautions.”
“Mostly. And I think he’ll be fine. It’s just a lot for him to wrap his brain around. Unfortunately, he’s also got Albus in his ear whispering about how everything is going to turn out as a worst-case scenario.”
Harry carefully picks up the ring and slides it onto Draco’s finger, feeling their magic pulsate through it.
“What we have together. A happy relationship. Fabulous sex. Being in love.” Draco’s hand rubs gentle circles on Harry’s back.
Harry surveys the room from where he’s curled up with Draco on the couch. Matthew and James are on the other couch, also wrapped up in each other as they watch the movie. Lily is sprawled in the overstuffed armchair, texting with Mina. Scorp and Al are laying on the floor, playing wizard’s chess.
“Of course.” Draco sets the pasta on the counter and retrieves his wand from the kitchen table. “Why don’t you go have a shower, and I’ll join you when these are done and under a stasis? We have less than an hour before the kids will be home.”
“All right.” Harry eases away from Draco and picks up his wand. Seeing no sense in putting a stasis over the mess he’s created, he resets his Magiscope for tomorrow and wards his station. Gathering his jacket, he turns to join Draco and they head for the door. “How did you even know I was still here?”
. “Or something involving protection against Dark Magic that doesn’t put me in danger; something different than the Aurors.”
“Have you given any more thought to how we want to tell the kids?” Draco’s hand rests protectively over Harry’s stomach while they lie tangled together on the couch.
Draco begins writhing beneath him as Harry takes him deeper, hollows his cheeks, increases the pace. Suddenly there's a hand in his hair gripping his wild curls, and Harry moans around Draco's cock, moving even faster.
“I’ll be sore, but I’ll be all right.” Harry waves a hand and a cleaning charm removes the evidence of his release from their chests and the slick of lube from his crevice. He leaves Draco’s release inside himself, though. For whatever reason, he doesn’t want to vanish that. He curls into Draco’s side, slinging an arm over his torso as Draco’s arm wraps around him.
“I’ll help you up, but you’re not getting down on the hearth, Harry. I’ll Floo Minerva. You text Hermione and have her come over. I want to see her face when you tell her.”
“Me either!” James’ eyes are wide. “Dad, I don’t want to have a baby. Not for a long time. I guess I just sort of…pretended it couldn’t happen, but then you’re pregnant and…”
“Draco, you did nothing wrong. It just caught me off-guard.” Harry squeezes Draco’s hand lightly. “Come on, then. Let’s head for that curry you promised me.”
Draco makes a show of peering behind Harry and leering at his arse. Harry’s face lights on fire and he smiles bashfully under the attention. The doors open and Draco quickly straightens. Harry fails to hide his laugh as they head out the doors and towards the front entrance of the CRMM.
“It is. You’ve been working hard; you didn’t even notice when I came in. Making progress on the potion?”
“The fuckers didn’t even sign it Mom and Dad,” Draco spits venomously as he shakes his head. “I’m not at all surprised; this is exactly the kind of thing they were saying when I went to pick him up. For some reason, I held out hope that they would calm down, but clearly I was mistaken.”
Harry smirks and laves over Draco’s entrance again, swirling his tongue around it before beginning to lick in a slow, repeated rhythm.
Harry waves his hand to bring up the lights as Draco reaches for his jumper, preparing to put it on. Suddenly, the indecision Harry had been battling vanishes, and he knows what he wants. He reaches over and pulls Draco’s hand away from his jumper. A confused look crosses Draco’s face and Harry cups his cheek gently and kisses him.
“Of course. Lay your hand on it, just there above the handle.” Harry pulls his wand as Draco obediently places his hand as instructed. Muttering an incantation, Harry smiles as Draco gasps, his eyes widening as the locker changes from plain white to navy and gold and
“I’m afraid so. They usually stare when I’m out alone or with the kids. The press knows to keep their distance, but they’ll still be following us around since our relationship is
Harry shifts off Draco, who immediately stands and helps him to his feet. He’s not entirely steady, but Draco guides him to the bed, pulls back the covers, and tucks him in. Draco stretches out a hand and
When his face swims into focus, Harry can tell he’s been crying. His face is pinched with worry, but then there’s a spread of the slightest bit of relief.
“Your membrane is totally dilated and broken. You’re at about a 7 of 10 for your anal opening. You’ve really done a fantastic job labouring so long at home, you’re nearly there. I would bet you’ll have a baby within the next two hours.”
“Are you both okay with this?” Hermione asks carefully. Harry can tell she’s still reeling from the news and is trying to gauge their reactions. He can’t blame her; he’s still not completely accustomed to the idea himself. He closes his eyes and sighs softly when Draco’s lips meet his temple with a gentle kiss.
“Orgasms are safe, provided they’re given in a manner that coincides with the other guidelines. The male womb doesn’t contract as the uterus does with the hormones associated with climax.”
Their five children stand with Hermione and Blaise, with Minerva waiting under the beautiful arch woven with white roses, just behind the simple stone table that will serve as their altar. Draco beams at Harry and they move across the patio, stopping in front of Minerva who already looks a bit teary.
Harry groans softly as his sleep-addled brain starts slotting everything into place. It’s Halloween. CRMM is closed for Halloween and the day after, which happens to be a Thursday and Friday this year, to allow their employees to attend the festivities. But the holiday holds a much darker meaning for Harry.
“That suits me just fine.” Matthew smiles at James. Harry knows they’re only sixteen, but he really does hope their happiness lasts. They seem very much in love and in a mature relationship.
“Are you feeling up to doing the nursery now?” Draco asks as he sets their purchases on the coffee table. “Or would you like a nap first?”
“I still miss him— the old him,” Harry confesses. “I’ve thought about reaching out now that the kids are all off at Hogwarts. Just to see if he wants to talk.”
“So—” Healer Carr conjures a thin sheet and suspends it vertically just below Harry’s belly, shielding him from James’ view before adjusting the blankets. “—what I’m going to do now is check the canal. Your dad’s has formed well; we’re just making sure the membrane is still in place and checking to see how thick it is. I expect it will be thinning soon if it hasn’t already. Knee up, please, Mr Potter.”
When the sensation reaches his hands, he becomes aware that the thing keeping his left hand warm is another hand.
Harry lays and listens to trunks bumping and feet stomping below him until there’s a pop and Harry knows they’re gone.
Harry offers his mobile to Draco, which he takes and begins to examine closely. Harry smiles at his eagerness. “With friends who have mobiles, yes. It’s much quicker than owling and more convenient than the Floo. Plus,” Harry gestures around them, “I spend a lot of time in Muggle areas. Helps me avoid the press.”
Harry huffs in displeasure as he finds himself empty. Draco slicks his cock, slow strokes covering himself in a generous amount of lube. Merlin, he’s more than ready to have Draco inside him, to be part of each other. He pulls both knees up to his chest and flushes as Draco openly ogles Harry’s body.
“We can have a big wedding or a party to celebrate later if we want to,” Harry shrugs. That part really isn’t important to him. What he cares about is being bonded, eternally, to the man next to him. “But I want to have this baby with you as my bonded husband.”
“Harry?” Draco’s sleepy voice precedes him. He pads through the doorway as Harry continues to heave. “Oh, love.” His voice is immediately sympathetic.
Running his fingers down the parchment, Draco’s face turns contemplative. “What do the different colours mean?”
Harry angles his head to look at Draco and tries not to look overly maudlin. “I’m glad I can be that person.”
“That should be fine.” Healer Carr waves her wand and her equipment begins packing itself neatly away. “I’m sure you gentlemen have much to discuss, but Mr Malfoy, if you would be so kind as to see me to the Floo, I will pass back the recipe for the long-acting anti-nausea and enough doses to get you through the time required to brew it.”
Draco chuckles softly and spreads a hand over Harry’s stomach. Regulus immediately gives the hand a good thump. Draco gasps and Harry grins.
He hasn’t needed to navigate even a potentially romantic situation in well over a decade. He still doesn’t know how Draco feels about any of this. Hell, he doesn’t even know for sure how he feels about this himself.
Draco’s grin tugs at Harry’s heart. He couldn’t put proper words to it if he tried, but the feeling of having a baby with someone he loves as much as he loves Draco — and knowing how very thrilled that man is to be having a baby with him — does something to his emotions.
Draco had washed him with gentle hands and helped him into clean clothes, and he’s at least feeling mostly human now. They’ve sent a text to Hermione, who has let them know she’ll be bringing the kids soon. But for now, it is Harry and Draco and their new-born son.
Draco eases back, taking Harry’s face in both his hands and studying his face. Draco’s eyes are molten silver with desire, and Harry could absolutely lose himself in them. Draco presses a soft kiss to Harry’s lips and then steps away, pulling a plush blanket from the couch and spreading it on the floor in front of the fire.
“Yes. I use my wand at work for the intricate imaging dissection, and I use it at home for more strenuous or detailed tasks, but on the whole, I don’t need one unless it’s a substantial task.” Harry shrugs. He always feels self-conscious when he discusses his magical power. He hates feeling like he’s bragging when he did nothing to gain his higher magic levels.
“I am not sure this is typical pregnancy-associated nausea. We found a few abnormalities in your scans that we’d like to follow up on. You’ll be here for a couple of days at any rate.”
There’s no response, so Harry assumes Matthew has nodded, because the next thing they hear is a series of powerful shrinking and packing charms. The snap of a trunk lid and latches is followed by a shrinking spell.
“Here we go.” Draco pushes open the door and guides Harry through. A cacophony of questions begins flying immediately.
“We are doing everything we can to make sure the baby and I are both okay. I see my Healer every week, and I’m getting regular exams and testing. Draco takes good care of me.”
Harry is astounded at the conviction and sincerity in the grey eyes locked on his. He already knows Malfoy has been working to improve his family name. He works at the Center for Rare Magical Maladies, a philanthropic organization, and has made sure funds for war victims and groups that were traditionally discriminated against had sufficient and ongoing resources. But that isn’t what Malfoy takes pride in. He takes pride in raising his son to be a good man.
“Can I stay, dad?” James asks softly. “I’d like to know what this is like. It’ll be me someday, I hope.”
“I know. But let’s get home and get settled, yeah? That way, when he calls, you can give whatever support necessary.” Harry puts an arm around James’ shoulder. “I’m proud of you, son. You’re being a good partner to Matthew at a time he really needs it.”
“I mean, if we decide this is going to be serious and long term, we need to tell the kids before we’re out publicly as a couple. I don’t want them to find out from the press.”
Draco toes off his shoes and Harry quickly does the same before they both sink onto the soft blanket.
Harry nods and Draco takes his hand, knowing that he will be uncomfortable. Healer Carr begins casting.
“I think we’ve reached the point of no return.” He moves back into the bedroom, and Draco follows, standing behind him as he turns to the mirror again. “Even my loosest robes aren’t going to hide my bump anymore.”
Draco gently strokes Harry’s prostate, sliding his finger in and out at a nearly agonisingly slow pace.
Harry moans and lays back on the bed. It’s not like he hasn’t wanked in the eleven years he’s been alone, but he hasn’t done it like this — with someone in mind. He envisions running his hands down the hard planes of Draco’s chest and pushing his fingers through Draco’s gorgeous blond hair, kissing Draco’s smirking lips. He moves his hand faster over his cock, swiping across his head and gathering the beads of precum already leaking there.
“He won’t think of me any differently, and it’s nice to have someone at school to talk to about it.” Al moves to set his potions case on his bedside table. “I know I’ve written to you several times, but it helps to have Scorpius.”
“What’s that?” Draco lays the rag over the sink and dries his hands before easing Harry into his arms.
“It does.” Draco reaches for both of Harry’s hands and squeezes them. “I feel so lucky. I never expected to get the chance to be in a serious relationship…to get the chance to fall in love. But here we are.”
The door to the loo clicks open and Harry turns, seeing Hermione’s face break into a grin. She crosses and wraps her arms around him.
“Oh!” Bernice appears flustered. “I’m sorry; I had no idea that was you, Mr Potter. Or you, Mr Malfoy.”
“I know.” Harry leans his head back to kiss Draco’s jaw. “But if we’re going to go out today, I think we’re going to have to let the proverbial cat out of the bag.”
her sparkle quills in that pit she calls a bedroom. He will find them, of course, and send them to her anyway.
The water runs momentarily in the sink and then Draco is kneeling next to him, damp flannel and a glass of water in hand. Draco flushes away the sick and gently wipes his face.
“Fuck. No.” Harry rubs the sleep from his face and sits up. He takes the phial Draco is offering and downs it. “Thank you.”
“I like that one.” He points and Erwin immediately pulls the ring from the case. It’s white gold with a thick textured band and a diagonal swirl of five diamonds across the top. “Maybe not all diamonds, though.”
Harry is not looking forward to this part. He stretches out a hand and silently summons one of the many books on male fertility and pregnancy Hermione had found for him.
“Sorry, James. I should have warned you. Magical travel is rather rough thanks to this one.” Harry rests his hands on his belly.
Harry pads into Draco’s lab and settles on the couch, shaking his head as Draco doesn’t even notice. The lab Draco has created in the attic space allows him to work from home most of the time, and Harry is exceptionally thankful for the specially warded reading nook Draco’s made for him off to one side. There’s a comfortable couch and chair where Harry can lounge, read, and relax close to his fiancé that is safe for him, even while pregnant.
“Bloody hell,” Harry mutters. He taps out his reply and sits with his finger hovering over the send button.
Draco complies and Harry slides his arms between Draco’s legs, carefully cradling a thigh in each elbow. Draco stretches out on the tabletop, reaching for the far side of the table and Harry lifts Draco’s knees onto the polished wood surface. He kisses down the curve of Draco’s perfect arse, trying to settle both his nerves and his excitement. Draco takes a deep breath, wrapping his hands around the far edge of the table and pushing his arse gently against Harry’s lips.
“Oh, thank you!” Claire gushes with far more enthusiasm than necessary, moving closer to Harry again. “I just wanted to be sure, you know.” She tips her head and reaches up to push her hair behind her ear.
“Matthew is safe,” Harry assures his daughter. “He’s here and will stay with us until the five of you go back to Hogwarts.”
“I look pretty good,” Harry says to his reflection. He’s dressed in the impeccably tailored outfit Draco helped him pick out when they went shopping earlier in the week; charcoal trousers and waistcoat over a dark wine-coloured dress shirt.
Draco reaches for a parchment containing a diagram of the Potter family tree. “Let’s see what’s in your family.”
“We should probably let the kids know we’re letting it slip tonight, too. It’ll hit the Prophet in the morning, and nobody needs that as an unexpected Sunday treat.”
“Right, so, pregnancy food it is,” Draco teases, heading for the kitchen to leaf through the takeaway menus. All Harry has craved the last three weeks has been bread and pasta and carby food and cheese. Any kind of cheese. Draco ends up ordering multiple giant pans of pasta and chicken in various sauces with several orders of cheese-covered garlic bread from FlooFood to be delivered at dinner time. There’s also going to be salad, but that’s really not relevant to Harry’s pregnant self.
Al hangs his head and Harry laughs. Harry draws his wand and levitates James’ trunk over next to Al’s and Scorpius’ and makes eye contact with Draco. Draco nods once, and Harry draws a steadying breath as he looks at his kids.
“Phew. Ok.” Lily pauses, fidgeting. Harry looks down at her face, mouth twisted in a contemplative expression, and can tell she has more she wants to ask.
“There’s a couple of options,” Draco explains. “There’s no wizard’s contraception potion like there is for witches, but there is a male contraception spell. There’s also Muggle condoms. Neither is one-hundred percent effective, though.”
Harry’s nerves stir again as Draco shifts slightly over him. It’s been a long time since he’s done anything but fly solo for his sexual pleasure, and even longer since he’s been with another man.
“So what’s going on with Claire?” Draco asks, his tone a bit waspish as they head for the elevators.
Picking up the remote, Harry settles more towards the middle and presses play. “I’m sure she would. I’ll ask her when I talk to her next.” He pulls the popcorn bowl onto the couch between them.
“Movie!” Lily screeches and dashes out of the room and makes for the stairs. Everyone sits in confused silence for a moment before Scorpius pipes up.
The look on her face is disconcerting and when Draco squeezes his hand, Harry knows he’s noticed as well.
“Provided you don’t object, I’ll write her back and tell her, politely, to fuck off.” Draco pauses thoughtfully. “I’ll also tell her about Regulus if you’re not opposed.”
“I have a private Healer that I’ve used for years. I’ll Floo and see if she’s available.” Draco steps from the room and Harry hears him descend the stairs. Truth be told, Harry doesn’t know what’s wrong, and it doesn’t feel like any other sickness he’s had before. He’s also generally a pretty healthy person and doesn’t usually get knocked on his arse by a simple bug. He can’t help but let his mind wander to dark places. Every time he gets
“I’ve missed you, too,” Harry murmurs. Hermione has been one of the few consistent people in his life for over a decade. He
Dinner eaten and remnants vanished, Harry lifts a hand to extinguish the lights. A sweet goodnight kiss and Harry finds himself gathered into Draco’s arms as Draco fits himself to Harry’s back. He drifts off to sleep wishing he could fall asleep like this every night.
Harry is angry all over again at Matthew’s parents. He seems so conditioned to feel like he has to earn love, like he’s a burden that must be borne, instead of a child — a person — worthy of love. Harry, more than anyone, understands feeling unloved and unvalued as a child over something he had no control over. He doesn’t want that for Matthew.
Harry shifts again against Draco. He can’t get comfortable. No matter how he lays, Regulus is pressing against something that shouldn’t be pressed against. He’s also very energetic, and Harry can clearly feel him moving around pretty much constantly.
Harry nods. “Agreed.” He can’t believe how domestic this feels, and one glance at Draco’s dancing eyes tells him he’s feeling the same.
“Of course. I’ll be in the hall when you’re ready.” Healer Carr moves to the hall, shutting the door behind herself.
“I can’t tell you how happy I am to hear that.” Harry knows this will be a long journey for Al, and probably a life-long treatment plan, but he’s thrilled Al is already seeing a difference.
“Well, that’s good to know. I’ve come close to just throwing caution to the wind several times and being more assertive, but I didn’t want to upset you.”
Draco obliges and pops open the phial. A hand disappears between Harry’s spread legs, and Harry moans as one of those familiar fingers breaches him. Slow and deep, finger and mouth matching pace, Draco begins to open him up.
“Of course, Mr Malfoy.” Erwin hurries off, rings in hand, to do as Draco asked. Harry’s mind is swirling with thoughts of engagement and a wedding and a future with Draco. All of it sounds perfect to him.
“Well, my family doesn’t do birthstones; we usually have a stone chosen for us that corresponds with the stars we are named after,” Draco explains.
“It does. Just having you here helps. This,” Harry raises his cup slightly, “is just icing on the cake.”
Draco relieves the owl of its paper and hands it over to Harry before joining him back in bed. The Sunday morning Prophet does not disappoint. Under the headline “Potter and Malfoy to Wed!” is a full-colour picture of them exiting
“Yeah.” Al’s voice sounds sincere. “I’ve never seen Dad this happy. I…I think you’re good for him. I think maybe you’re good for each other.”
“I was content, though,” Draco continued, “with Scorpius and me. I did date a little, but it was when Scorpius was young and I was still closely associated with my father in the wizarding world, so it was only Muggles I met at the pub or elsewhere in town. There was never going to be anything serious there, and I really thought I was ok with it.”
“Yes. Much, actually. The idea you had about strengthening the lighter magic with extra lacewing while simultaneously suppressing the malevolent made a big difference. It’s not a solution but it was a step forward.” Draco steps into the Apparition area and offers his arm to Harry. “Side-Along?”
“I wanted to give her our engagement news in person before the papers figure it out. And if we tell her I’m pregnant, there’s a guaranteed pile of reputable reading material being delivered here by tomorrow evening.”
“It is.” Harry wonders if Draco can feel the absolute love and contentment radiating through him. “I thought maybe I’d never have
“I don’t suppose it will.” Harry reaches up on the back of the couch and grabs the blanket he keeps there. Spreading it over them, Harry settles against Draco’s chest and closes his eyes as Draco’s strong arms slide around to hold him. He can’t remember the last time he felt this content.
“Very well.” Draco turns to stand and pick up his wand. “Let me go spell your room, James, and then I think your dad and I are going to get some sleep.”
“Merlin, Harry,” Draco breathes, his voice laced with awe, making Harry blush. “You look fantastic like this.
“You almost fainted. I gave you a mild version of Pepper-Up to prevent you from completely losing consciousness.” Healer Carr’s voice is more serious than before. “Your body is struggling, Mr Potter. You really must eat more and rest as much as possible. I’m afraid you’re going to land in St Mungo’s if you don’t.”
Harry struggles to keep himself calm and finally loses the battle against the anger boiling under the surface.
Something vaguely warm pools in Harry’s gut and he returns the intense gaze. “You’ve done exactly that, Malfoy. You’ve raised a fine young man from what I can see. And for what it’s worth, it sure seems to me like you’ve made a good man out of yourself, as well.”
The noise Draco makes is something akin to a whimper as he slicks his cock and positions himself behind Harry. Harry murmurs a sticking charm on the chair as Draco’s blunt head presses against his hole. Pressing back, he stretches wide as the thick cock slides inside.
“And your housing. And your living expenses,” Draco adds. “Same for Albus and Scorpius and Lily. And Regulus, when he’s old enough. Provided, of course, that you all work to your potential in the chosen course of study.”
Draco wraps an arm around Harry and offers his support as they shuffle inside. Once he is settled in the recliner, Draco kneels in front of the fireplace and Harry taps on his phone.
Harry is reclining in bed, waiting for Draco to return from talking to Scorpius who had requested a moment alone with his father. The parchment he’s holding is full of Hermione’s tidy handwriting with names and notes scratched alongside tasks in his messy scrawl or Draco’s angular script. They’re
Standing and crossing to a shelf filled with DVDs, Harry pulls three off the shelf. “Considering you said you haven’t seen many Muggle films, why don’t you pick from these? I’ve seen them all and they’re all quite good, but also very different from one another.”
Harry feels his throat tighten and he takes a shuddering breath. His legs feel like lead and his stride falters. He is aware he’s falling behind Draco but his voice is stuck somewhere in his throat and he can’t say anything.
Harry extends one hand behind Draco’s back and concentrates, focusing his magic until what he’s waiting for lands in his hand. Draco feels the gentle movement and leans back to peer at Harry.
Something moves the cold thing away from his abdomen. A soft incantation is spoken by an unknown voice, and Harry has the bizarre sensation of his body slowly taking on its own weight. The wash begins over his toes, and he’s never been so aware of his feet. The slow-motion wave takes what feels like several minutes to reach his abdomen, but with it comes the reassuring feeling of the hard mass between his hips. The baby is still there.
“Not in the least.” Harry turns and takes Draco’s hand. “Come on. Let’s go see if we can’t get Al to calm down.”
“I’m not sure, exactly. Your magic is not within normal range, but I gather from Mr Malfoy that it never has been?”
Draco withdraws from the kiss sooner than either of them would like, and they exchange places with Minerva.
“Your membrane is beginning to thin just a little bit, Mr Potter, which is actually a good sign right now. It means your body is preparing for birth. If you go into labour at this point, I wouldn’t attempt to stop it.”
“He’s right, son. None of this is your fault.” Harry braces himself. “Why don’t you go get Matthew. I think we need to have a discussion of a personal nature.”
Though Draco seems sure that Narcissa will disapprove of them, Harry still hopes somewhere deep inside that she might eventually accept her son and his future husband, and maybe even their son. He can’t imagine ever rejecting any of their children the way she and the McLellands have rejected their sons. Draco is clearly happy with their life, and so is he, but he suspects his fiancé would be glad for his mother’s approval, should she offer it.
“Well, that’s quicker than I anticipated,” Harry sighs. “At least we might figure out what’s going on.”
Harry sinks onto the blanket, impressed immediately with the extensive cushioning charms Draco has put on it. It’s like laying down on a soft bed. Draco settles beside him and guides him gently onto his back. Harry reaches for Draco but Draco grasps his hands and lays them back at his sides.
“Okay, Mr Potter. Let’s see if you can turn over on your knees and put your head on your husband’s shoulder.”
“Being a private Healer, I can oversee your care, but I suggest you also make a connection with the Male Pregnancy Clinic at St Mungo’s. You’ll need their care if you need to be admitted and, unless you want a home birth, during labour and delivery. I can send a referral over with all today’s testing and results.”
Harry can’t wipe the contented smile from his face, and he notices with pleasure that Draco’s expression mirrors his own. Draco pulls him gently onto the blanket, and Harry’s suddenly wrapped in a gentle warming charm as well.
Harry looks past Lily to Scorpius. “We’re not sure yet, but no matter what, we’ll make sure that Matthew is safe, has a place where he is accepted and loved, and has the things he needs. For now, that’s with us and we are happy to have him stay, but a lot of this will be Matthew’s decisions, not ours.”
“Oh, I know. It’s just…different now, for some reason. I’m happy for the first time in a really long time. I just want to enjoy it.”
Harry’s pouring through takeaway menus at the kitchen counter when the Floo chimes, announcing Hermione’s imminent arrival.
“That sounds brilliant. I think I’ll take a shower and try to unwind.” Harry eyes Draco, unsure how this next bit of information is going to go over. “You can Apparate straight in if you don’t want to find a Floo. I added you to the family wards.”
“It seems Lily has written,” Harry smiles as Draco, being the non-pregnant one, swiftly moves to let the owl in.
“You’re pregnant,” Draco admonishes gently. “You’re growing our son. That’s the furthest thing from useless I can think of.”
A triumphant scream has them both looking towards the pitch. Albus is holding his closed fist aloft, apparently having won their game.
“I have no problem with that,” Healer Carr winks at them. “I have nine children of my own.” She lifts her bag. “I’ll see you next Thursday, gentlemen. I can see myself out.”
He doesn’t stop, and it only takes a single brush at just the right angle against Harry’s prostate for him to be spilling all over the shower wall. Draco moans against his back and his thrusts lose their rhythm as Harry pulses around him.
“Thanks, Dad.” James hugs Harry tightly and then, after just a moment of hesitation, wraps his arms around Draco and hugs him, too. “Thanks, Draco.”
Harry’s name falls from his lips, repeatedly, and then Harry is being filled as Draco empties inside him.
Unable to keep from grinning, Harry pulls on some clothes before making his way to the Floo. Kneeling on the cold stone, he tosses in some powder and calls out “Malfoy Residence, London”. Pushing his head into the flames, he waits for Draco to answer.
