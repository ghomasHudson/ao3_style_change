“SLYTHERIN!” The Hat calls out. The Slytherin table erupts in cheers, and, before McGonagall moves, it speaks to him again.
“An owl?” Hermione sounds alarmed. Ron feels bad – or he thinks he would, were he not in this – this
“His name was Tom.” She says softly. “He charmed me into telling him. He was so handsome…”

“I didn’t know you were asking me out!” Draco says. “I thought we were friends!”
He’s thrown into a different room every time he’s dragged out of the dungeons. They leave him there without food or water until he finds what they’re looking for – which he hasn’t, because he doesn’t know
“What are you thinking of?” Another voice asks.
“He’s a child.” Snape says.
“And?” George demands.
“This is ridiculous!” Snape doesn’t raise his voice, but it’s evident he’s seething. “The Dark Lord cannot come to Hogwarts.”
“Wank a lot?” Blaise snickers, and Draco goes tomato red, shoving at his best friend’s shoulder.
calmly. “You are going to tell us why you have this when you supposedly turned it in to McGonagall.”
They both nod, and she accios them over.
Draco’s thrown on his knees in front of the Dark Lord.
“It’s been… complicated.” He admits uneasily.
“I’m sorry,” He says, even if it feels empty.
Okay, so he stress eats. So sue him. It doesn’t happen often, and even if it did, he’s fine. He can eat whatever the bloody hell he wants. His mom’s sweaters are big enough that no one would ever notice even if he gained weight, which he never does, and it’s not like anybody’s ever going to see him naked.
“Which one?”
“Potter is going to be staying at Draco’s house.” He explains. “He doesn’t know what he’s going to do because he’s been hopelessly in love with the scar-headed prat for the better of six years.”
“I’ll stay.” Hermione says quietly.
Harry nods – they kiss goodbye once more – and Draco hears Ron complaining as he walks away.
“I hate you,” Draco says.
“Gone.”
Potter gets under the covers, and then, to Draco’s mortification, pats the space beside him. He complies, lying stiffly on top of the blanket, trying not to look at Potter too often.
Scorpius survives Voldemort a second time, against all odds. Hugo nearly dies, but he and Rose pull him out of the chamber, and, afterwards, Madam Pomfrey says he’s going to make a full recovery.
Draco’s jaw tightens. “I know that.”
.” He says.
Ron and Ginny nod stiffly. There’re a few seconds of silence, and then Ginny speaks.
“Did you destroy them?” Potter has a hand wrapped around her son’s ankle, and Narcissa sees – very curiously – how they fit together. It’s melancholic, to watch them like this. It reminds her that her baby’s all grown up, and that she wasn’t a part of it. Any of it.

“Hippogriff,” Ginny shoots back sweetly.
Draco stares at him for a long time, and when he speaks, the knot in Ron’s stomach tightens further.
“Morning, Potter.” Blaise says smoothly.
be anywhere near Hogsmeade – but it doesn’t stop, and it’s driving him insane.
Draco’s cheeks heat. “I did?”
Draco slams the door on his way out.
Harry’s breathing’s evened out, and when Draco looks at him, he realizes he’s already fallen asleep.
“Innocent people are
He tries not to think about it, because he knows they love him, but he also knows they’re right; he’s seen the way their eyes go misty when something he does reminds them of his father.
“Hi.” He says. “Fancy some Fortescue’s?”
“You write to
The dungeons are entirely bare, and he Luna and Draco have been kept here, he thinks they must’ve been sleeping on the floor. The torches on the walls are dimly lit.
Potter smirks triumphantly.
Ron catches sight of Harry and sighs.
“Oh?” Draco asks carefully.
knew about this but you. Every single person you trusted hid this from you because they think you’re a stupid child. They don’t think you can make your own decisions.”
Both boys pale.
Parkinson flicks her hair and cocks her head. “How?”
It’s not; neither Nagini nor Harry are dead yet, but he knows no one wants to point that out.
Ginny nods, and they walk to the ice cream parlor.
“No,” they say again.
“I know you are,” he says, pride swelling in his chest. Then, he teases, “Must’ve had a great teacher.”
“I hid three Horcruxes here in the manor.” Narcissa says. “The locket, the ring, and the diary. I’ll destroy them.”
“I duplicated it.”
“He was our friend!” She’s crying, tears and snot dripping down her face, but the wand she’s pointing at Nott is unflinching. “He was a
Harry exhales, nodding slowly, and then he looks at him.
When Draco sees him again, he looks like shit – and that’s saying something, because Draco’d think he looks good covered in mud and with birds nesting on his head – and Draco tries to sound casual when he speaks.
A sharp pang of pain shoots through Draco’s head, just like it did those few first days at the hospital, whenever he tried to remember what happened while he was missing. It’s so intense he has to stop walking for a moment, needs to catch his breath. He hears the sound of the candy he bought clattering on the floor.
Blaise grins wickedly. “Good.”
Draco refuses to look at him, and he blinks quickly. If Harry’s not mistaken, there are tears in his eyes, and he never wanted to make Draco sad, so he pulls the smaller boy closer until there’s barely any room to breathe.
He sits across from Dumbledore in a small couch, and McGonagall sits next to him.
Draco’s cheeks burn as he sits up, color deepening further at the parts of the dream he remembers.
He catches sight of his wand, lying under rubble and burning pieces of wood, and he tries to get to it. Just as his fingers close around it, a shiny black shoe steps on his wrist. Draco drops it with a pained grunt, looking up at the blurry figure of Bellatrix Lestrange.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes?” he says.
“Have you found how to destroy them?” She asks, frowning down at the book she’s reading.
Harry doesn’t want it to end.
She looks at him almost piteously, and, of all the reasons Harry’s been looked at like that, he thinks this might be the worst one. His face burns, and he coughs awkwardly.
Though the spark of silver is stronger now, it’s still not a full Patronus. Draco wonders if he’s doing it on purpose, if he doesn’t want to do it right then because he is a bit worried it might be a lovesick puppy that’ll somehow announce to everyone his crush on Potter.
The others nod hastily, and they all go to bed.
“What?” Harry asks, surprised. “
“Where are we?” he asks carefully.
The professors look at each other, and he gets the distinct feeling they know something he doesn’t.
“Bellatrix Lestrange,” Blaise says, looking at the book. He shudders. “I’ve never met her, but she scares the bloody soul out of me.”
After
Draco shakes his head fondly.
There’s a flash of blond somewhere near the corner of Draco’s eyes, and he turns, blinking widely at Lucius Malfoy’s figure, retreating into a side alley.
“Blaise,” He says vehemently. “I love you.”
Still, that could’ve gone better.
He tries to give him a reassuring smile, but it’s even less convincing than his words.
Draco glares thunderously at him.
He’s dragged from the dungeons by Antonin Dolohov. Every day, he is tortured and asked about
“But why was it sent to me?” Draco asks. “It’d be smarter to send it to the aurors.”
“I-” He feels dazed.
It’s disappointing.
He greets guests with a very fake smile, and then cries during the ceremony. He’s incredibly happy for both Bill and Fleur, and when the celebration begins, he sits in one of the tables, watching them dance. Their smiles bring a real smile to his face.
He checks carefully before taking a turn towards the staircase instead of the library. He uses one of the secret passages that lead straight to the shrieking shack. It’s filthy, and it sort of gives him the creeps, but it’s what he has to do.
“I didn’t know about the Malfoy part before!” she defends. “I figured it out just before he disappeared-”
“Hey!” The door opens, and Ginny and Hermione stand at the door, smiling.
“Umbridge is a bloody arsehole.” Rose drops herself next to him in the Great Hall, and Scorpius nearly flinches; he was immersed on his book about Dark Magic, because Voldemort is back – the mass murderer who killed his parents is
All his friends laugh, except for Adam, who’s shaking his head and smiling lightly.

“Yes, you should’ve,” Ron says harshly. “Honestly, you’re hiding things from me?!”
Harry looks like he might be sick. “I need some air.”
“Let me kiss you,” Harry murmurs.

“You don’t have to choose now, Draco.” Malfoy says. He extends a hand and gives Draco a Floo address. “Call when you’ve made up your mind.

He cuts the envelope open, and takes the letter out carefully. It’s multiple pages long, and Draco frowns as he begins reading.
“How do you know that?” Draco asks, frowning.
“Shit,” Zabini says. “
“You’re not doing
“And?” Blaise asks. “Did they know anything?”
It had been what James had done, and though not completely fatal, it had been disastrous.
But Draco’s exhausted and more than a little bit frustrated, so he clenches his fists at his sides.
“What do you guys think it is?” Noah Williams asks.
“Draco’s adopted.” He blurts out.
Harry looks shocked for a split second, and then he glares drily.
“I know what sex is, Parkinson!” Harry snaps hotly, face growing red.
“I missed you.” He says against his shirt. “So much.”
“I’m sorry.” Luna says. “I can’t see you. I thought I could find where you were if I touched you.”
Snape nods. There’s a loud meow that Draco recognizes as Mrs. Norris’s, and Snape looks back and purses his lips.
No one answers. And Draco can see the shock on all of their faces, the guilt piling strongly over it, and he knows Malfoy wasn’t lying; they all knew, and they’ve all been lying to him for Merlin knows how long.
Potter shakes his head and pushes his glasses up his nose. “It’s fine. Try again.”
“Fine.” He says stiffly.
“And if Potter’s involved, Granger and Weasley must be, too.” Thomas says. “And Lupin.”
As it is, he doesn’t know how he’s getting through it. He feels as though there’s nothing real.

Harry leans forward and kisses him.
“Can we talk?” he says. “Midnight, the common room?”
“What happened?” Molly asks nervously. She’s the one sitting closest to the couch in one of the kitchen chairs, Draco’s hand on her lap. His nails and lips look nearly blue. One of the Weasley’s – the one that works with dragons, Narcissa knows – is working over him tirelessly, casting every healing charm he knows just to make sure everything’s alright.
“Whatever it is, we’ll fix it in the morning.” he says. “Everything is always fixed in the morning.”
They don’t talk about Draco, because as much as Ron loves Harry, it makes him a bit uncomfortable – and protective – to imagine him dating his baby brother. Though to be fair, it makes him a lot less uncomfortable than imagining anyone else with Draco. Really, he just doesn’t want to imagine anyone with neither Ginny nor Draco. They’re too young, still. They’re his younger siblings, and even though Ron realizes it’s not his place, he feels very protective of them.
grey sort of trance where all that he feels is worry – but he doesn’t stop writing. He needs to know that his family is alright. “But Ron, we can’t-”
“Only that one thing!” Harry says, but Ginny interrupts.
“Look! Look at it! It’s nothing! It’s a diadem!” Draco shoves the diadem at them, and McGonagall takes it cautiously.
That means that, like every other summer Potter’s spent here, he’ll be sleeping in Ron and Draco’s room, in Draco’s bed, which means Draco’s sharing with someone. Usually, he’d just sleep in Ginny’s room, but Hermione’s sleeping in her room, which means there’s no space for him there.
Draco’s first class is Defense against the Dark Arts with the Slytherins, so he sits with Pansy and Blaise.
He thinks, from Zabini’s expression, he knows exactly what he’s thinking.

They hold each other for as long as possible, somewhere between forever and not long at all.

“Your so-called siblings know.” Malfoy says. “Your parents know. Parkinson and Zabini, they know, too. Your precious Harry Potter has been lying to you for

“I don’t know what to say.” Draco hasn’t had a conversation since the wedding. He’s barely said a word that wasn’t ‘stop’, ‘please’, or ‘no’. Or, of course, screaming when he’s in pain, but those aren’t words.
Even if Draco doesn’t answer, Ron can see it clear as day across his face; shame and fear both, more terrified of what Ron would think of him than what Smith could do.
He’s been seeing Malfoy everywhere he goes for
“Practically the whole wizarding world?” Noah points out.
“He hasn’t asked?” Ron asks, disbelieving. He knows his brother, and that’s
They use the room of requirement – Draco didn’t know anyone but the Hufflepuffs knew about it – and though after a while of being around Potter he finally relaxes, he still doesn’t seem to be able to cast the charm.
“Alright,” he says. “But Head Auror, it’s really not necessary-”
There’s no convincing her of anything else, not if she’s already made up her mind.
Zabini and Parkinson share another silent conversation. Harry’s going to hex them if they do that one more time.

Draco’s hand goes to his sleeve to get his wand, only for him to remember that he’d left the Slytherin dorm without it.
justice.
Draco’s mind starts racing.
And Draco can see Hermione, Blaise, Pansy, and Harry behind them and he hates them, too, every single one of them. Mostly, he hates himself for believing they were his friends, even for a second. Hates himself for believing anything could happen with Harry.
Fleur is with him, and she smiles at Draco, taking the seat on his other side.

“I’m fine,” Draco says, clipped. For all his husband can lie, he can never lie to Harry.
“Yes,” Granger says, when Narcissa has taken too long to respond. She’s sitting near Ronald Weasley, and neither of them are looking at each other. Narcissa wants to snort. She remembers being young and embarrassed about things like kissing. Her life has changed since then. “We’re only missing Nagini. And well…”
“Yes,” Hermione says. “Who’ll get his wand?”
They all take seats in the waiting room, except for Fleur, who keeps pacing around worriedly, and normally Ron’d be annoyed that she’s making him even more nervous – because since when does she care about any of them anyway? – but he can’t think past the knot of anxiety and fear settled at the pit of his stomach.
“Hey, Draco,” Potter peeks his head out of the bookstore. “Are you coming in?”
Draco hums. “McGonagall will probably tell us tomorrow. She can’t just dismiss the Welcome feast and then not say anything about anything.”

“It was like a sort of… resistance. To Voldemort. Your parents were in it. Remus and Sirius, too.” She says. “So are Ron’s parents, McGonagall. Most all of the teachers. I heard them talking about it a few weeks ago, and it’s active again. It can only mean one thing.”
“You will?” he asks, surprised.
“And I was already planning to leave the country, I thought I’d just take you with me, and on the way out – on the way out, I ran into Molly Weasley, she was there with her youngest for a checkup and I knew – I
“Let them be happy, Ronald.” Hermione says besides Ron, lying on the grass and reading a book on Horocruxes.
“No, I just-” He needs to sleep. And eat something that isn’t horrible hospital food. And to see his brother out of the hospital, and for this whole damn thing to be over. “Bloody hell, I just need to be alone for a bit, yeah? I’ll – I’m sorry.”
Ohh also yess Draco is ten months younger than Ginny so no they don't think they're twins...
“They wouldn’t.” Draco says, with a lot less certainty than he meant to.
. I need to – I need to know you’re alive.”
“Are you asking?” Pansy asks.
He knows it’s necessary, by now. He’s accepted that it has to happen. The months he spent alone with Ron and Hermione in the woods, half convinced Draco was dead, he’d been resigned to dying. Yearned for it, even, felt as though it could finally give him peace. Here, sitting next to Draco, he never wants to have to go.
, the dreamy, half irrational part of his mind whispers.
“What? Yeah. Yes, yeah, I’m fine. Sorry.”

Draco clears his throat. “Yeah, I’ll - I’ll do that.”
The next morning, in the Hufflepuff dorm – Draco slept better than he has since he disappeared – Draco stresses over outfits and ways to do his hair, even if he knows it’s ridiculous. It’s not a
“Will you be here when I wake up?” Potter – no,
Harry grins a little bit. “If I minded I wouldn’t be offering, brat.”
Draco’s in over his head now, and there’s no way this won’t end with his heart broken. He should find someone he’s attracted to that isn’t the damned
“Your father thinks I’m dead.” She continues. “The Dark Lord – he has Horocruxes. I found three – a diary, a ring, and a locket. Regulus helped me, and he left a list of the rest of them. They’re in what was going to be your nursery.”
“It’s sort of cloudy, and it’s cold, of course, but I’ve always liked this sort of weather,” Draco continues nervously. “Makes you wonder what sort of weather there’ll be in the wedding-”
“Harry, what the bloody hell are you
Blaise laughs. “Don’t let Potter hear you, he’ll think you’re over him.”
“But you knew that, didn’t you?” Hermione continues. “It’s why you’ve been avoiding him.”
. You want to know what will happen even if you find him Ron? You’ll be captured. You’ll be tortured.” Ron secretly thinks it’d be worth it, if it meant he got to see his brother again. “You will only make it worse for him. And there’s a chance… he’s not… he’s already…”
“Each of us may be missing someone in these halls, and I have faith that we will treat each other with a compassion that bears in mind all that we have lost and all that we stand to gain as one. With that, I believe the sorting hat would like to introduce himself.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. "You want to know if I actually remembered to get you anything ahead of time."
While he was kneeling, the bell over the door rang, and multiple pairs of shoes entered the room. Draco didn’t look. He placed his clenched hand on the table and dropped the coins on the counter.
“Seriously?” Pansy frowned. “You two hardly left the library all weekend! It’s our last term at Hogwarts. Don’t we deserve to have some fun?”
"The particular position I'm interested in has come up every year I've been alive. I think I'll chance it. This is what I'm going to do." The more Harry spoke, the more certain he felt. "The thing is--I'm not doing well. I killed Voldemort, and everything's supposed to be better now, but things don't feel right. I don't feel right. There are so many people I haven't even really talked to since the end of the war. The only time I deal with what happened is when I'm sleeping and I haven't done enough of that this year. I've been seeing a mind-healer, and I want everything to be faster, but it's not."
But Sam wasn’t the only one putting up a fight. “You said she needs Defense,” Johnson said. He was pointing his wand at Ron, who stepped back, raising his hands. “We can help.”
This chapter's like... 90% about Hagrid, who deserved better things.
Before Harry could worry any farther about whose bones were in the top drawer, Draco went on. "I never even imagined a future in which you and I ended up dating. I knew I liked you for a while."
Ginny laughed so hard she had to bend over to catch her breath. "Wow. Your reaction was even better than his. That's my tax for getting dragged into your mess."
A muzzle materialized, and two flicking ears, a long, scrawny neck, reedy legs, and a tail. A horse. Lacey’s horse Patronus whinnied and trotted in a little circle. Looking for work. Looking for whatever she needed to defend Lacey from.
Of course it was, but it was also the edge they had on Lockhart's Laughs. Both stores were hosting a meet and greet with Santa on Christmas Eve, but Weasley's also had Harry Potter. "You asked what you could do to help the shop out," Draco said. "And this is definitely it."
“A decent definition. If someone wants to get into your head and see what you’re thinking or feeling, or wants to influence you, you have to be able to defend yourself. A shield is one way of thinking about it. Potter, you know the spell to enter another’s mind?”
Harry lifted his flask of Draco-Polyjuice. "Cheers." He took a deep swig and put his long legs to use, easily keeping ahead as Draco jogged to keep up, shouting. "What did you and Ron do six years ago?"
“What’s the gossip?” Draco asked. He should have known that he wouldn’t be the only one to find this interesting.
It was harder than he anticipated, and not because of Potter. The next morning, Potter seemed just as eager as Draco not to talk. They moved around each other like the repellent ends of magnets. It was Granger and Weasley and--curse it all--Pansy that made it impossible.
And then Harry was by his side. "I'm glad we found you," he said.
When Granger was safely out of earshot, Pansy finally spoke up. “So, Potter stinks, huh?”
But Draco, of course, could not be convinced.
The first years were cheering her on without pausing for breath. Pansy came up and stood close behind Draco. “Draco, I’ve never heard of someone stopping an obscurial transformation halfway."
"I think I can tell what's junk and what's not," Draco responded, directing his wand at another pile. "If you want to save any of the dark odds and ends you've been keeping for lessons, you better hurry up and sort them out before I get to them."
“But I just tried,” Sam wailed. “You said they’re hard to do when you’re upset."
“What makes you think--”
It was June 5th. Of course he'd
She was yanking on his arm, but her motions didn't have as much effect on Draco as her words. His head jerked up. "How do you know my name?"
“Stop looking at me like that, Malfoy,” she said, pouring herself a glass of water. “I know Pansy told you.”
“What did I say?” Potter’s voice was quiet now, pitched for Neville to hear. Draco leaned back onto his pillow and tried not to try to hear everything they said.
Draco expected Neville to work with him for a few minutes to prove a point and then leave off to the party, but they both worked steadily for some time before Neville flopped over on his bed and complained, “I can’t think of a single other harmless hex at this point, and the library’s sure to be closed.
“Since when have you cared about that?” Draco raged. “If I beat you--when Ginny and I beat you on Christmas, you’d better be really playing.”
“She wants to mend divisions after the war. I want to be liked again. If it takes a bit of acting to make the rest of the school think we’ve put all our differences behind us, we’re both more than equal to the task.
True, there was a dull ache inside Harry when he looked up at the Gryffindor Seeker. There was a part of him that wanted to be up on the broom, a part of him that could remember all the Quidditch that Ginny and he had played together and how they'd come back to the common room laughing so hard that they couldn't breathe. He wasn't sure which he missed more--quidditch or Ginny.
Hermione frowned, and a little vertical line appeared between her eyebrows. “I don’t think--”
"Thanks." Draco replied, and Harry could tell that Draco was trying to be extra cheery, too. He wasn't asking Harry if he'd forgotten, and it wasn't because he didn't suspect. It was because Draco didn't want to hear the answer.
"Professor," Harry protested. "We're going to be late for the last match--"
“I’ll come too.”
"Zoe's petals. They're not there."
Potter scrambled to his feet and held out a hand to help Draco up. Everyone was watching. He couldn’t just bat Potter’s hand out of the way. But he couldn’t hold onto it for too long, either. He let Potter’s grip close around his hand, sturdy and reliable, and lift him to his feet.
I am not avoiding you. Well, I am avoiding you some. But it's not because I don't want to be around you. It's hard to be around people, even the people I like best, when I'm so tired of being with myself. And you're right--I've made you be the brave one over and over again because I'm afraid I'll do something wrong. You think I like you less because of it, and I hate that.
Hermione's eyebrows pulled together, and she stopped walking. "What?"
Harry scrambled to grab a few of the actually useful things that he'd found around the room and deposit them in the aquarium in the back. He was quiet, listening to Draco's voice in the dark castle, saying a spell that he probably didn't even need to speak aloud now, but the voice was comforting. "Evanesco. And you too. Evanesco."
They pelted into the corridor outside the Headmistress's office only to screech to a halt before running into McGonagall.
“Me not to touch you,” Harry finished in an undertone.
McGonagall’s voice cut Draco off. “I believe that Madame Pomfrey can explain the situation adequately to Ms. Ketteridge. Thank you for your assistance.”
Of course now. Why had Harry hesitated so long, making Draco always be the one to reach? He leaned forward and pressed his lips against Draco's. He had been planning to say something clever in the moment after he initiated the kiss about "Well, if you'd rather not--" or something, but he got distracted. Draco was very good at that.
"I don't want to miss a second of it," Harry grinned. Gryffindor versus Slytherin for the final time. "Merlin, I wish I were flying today. I wish we were both flying today."
Of course, he'd never intended to show up at Potter's home. The stories of the kids were more than enough. But Potter was persistent, and Draco made the mistake of thinking if he went once, Potter would shut up about it. But somehow (Draco knew exactly how. It was because he'd read stories with the little whelps and done shadow puppets to get one of them to stop crying when it was time for bed.) one invite had turned into more, and now he was over there once or twice a week.
“Ron? What are you doing down here?”
"No," Harry said, and he took Draco's hand, gripping his wand so tightly that Harry thought something might snap. Either the bones or the wand itself, and either would be a pity. "Not you." He pried the wand from Draco's fingers and let it fall, taking hold of Draco's hand and trying to ease it out of a fist.
Hermione closed her eyes and blew a long sigh out. It was so much easier when Ron and Harry were the ones causing all the problems.
Harry's eyes narrowed. "You must have been out of the loop for a while, stranger. That home was open for about four months before we disbanded. I'm the last person you should be asking for help with kids."
“Excuse me.” It was Hermione’s voice. They’d followed Draco up the steps, and he felt a rush of relief. “You said you need the headmistress? We’ll send a Patronus."
Draco blinked up at them. "I have the gold. Two big bags of it." That was right, wasn't it? He looked down at his arms, then all around his person, confused. Had he forgotten something? Yes, definitely that. He'd forgotten everything since they'd dropped the bags of gold on him. They'd been so heavy. Maybe he'd--"Maybe I dropped it?" he said. His voice sounded thin, even to his own ears.
"With an advertisement like this, how could I miss it?" Draco laughed.
"Yes," Harry said, and he could hear that his voice was lower. "If you can separate the person from any potions they might be taking, one of the most efficient solutions..."
"I'm not a witch, Draco," she said. "Your kind aren’t the only ones with power. Now, you wanted me to meet Harry Potter?"
“You’re not even trying, Malfoy,” Potter responded in a growl. When you couldn’t do the Patronus, you gave up. You refuse to teach the eighth years occlumency, which you’d be good at, and now you won’t even try--”
"And with that," McGonagall said, looking out the window, "I believe that all three of us have a Quidditch match to attend. Gryffindor looks poised to take the cup again."
Draco had been offended. When it came to his hatred for Potter, there was no burden too great. “Hardly! Can you imagine the look on his face when he sees these? He’ll be spitting slugs!”
"Eat fast. You're mine after dinner."
He stood up, steadier now, but also filled with dread. His eyes scanned the road. There were no convenient bags topped to the brim with gold sitting on the steps with him. But he could still see his footprints in the snow. He’d trace those, and maybe he’d find something. Some clue as to where he’d left the gold or how he’d lost the last few minutes.
Malfoy was last. He wiped his hand on his robes, chin tipped high and a look of revulsion on his face.
“They wanted to know why ours are matching. And I tried telling them about Snape’s Patronus, and how the two of you were really close, but they got it in your head that you--well, that it was more about me than Snape. So I was talking to Hermione and Ron about it, trying to see what they thought, and they said that you’d be the person to ask. So?”
Draco forced his cold and heavy limbs to move and threaded one arm around her waist.
Was this girl some accomplished legilimens? Never mind. "That's her. We'll take you to Luna and Harry. They'll know what to do with you."
She blinked. "Oh. I know all about you, Mister Draco Malfoy. If you don’t mind, could you get out your wand and get us dried up and warm? It would be a pity for you to die of hypothermia after I jumped in to save you."
Harry’s eyes sought Draco’s even as the wall suddenly became the focus of all Draco’s attention. “This is so stupid,” Harry growled. “I think it’s this room, too. It feels heavy. It feels like you’re not safe here.”
1. Why is this chapter so long? No one knows. It's not even that thematically linked...
“Have some,” Hermione said.
"Do any of you know why this might be important to learn?"
"You've got to help me, Mr. Lockhart. I don't care what happens to me. I'll quit working there, if that's what you want. You'll never see me on Diagon Alley again. But the kids worked so hard for this." The kids, and the Weasleys, and Potter. None of them deserved to be punished because Draco couldn’t walk down a street properly.
“Will you look at that,” Pansy said under her breath. “The savior never takes a day off.”
“They sent her home over the holidays. Lacey. She was at home with the family that tells her that she’s always causing a scene and she’s got to control herself and not act crazy. The family that tells her she’s got something evil inside of her, something that makes her bad.”
"Everything that came afterward. All the excuses and the explanations, all the fake sounding blood magic. Do you know how much good that did me when I was six? Eight? Twelve? Of course I went home when Dumbledore asked me to.
He fished the keys out of his pocket and wiggled the correct one into the door. It took a lot of shifting and jiggling to get the shop door open. Fred said that was part of the charm of the joke shop--it was always pulling little jokes back on them. When Draco said that it wasn't funny and they should just use a spell, George pointed out that they didn't keep Draco on for his sense of humor.
McGonagall, as usual, was all business. “Granger, Parkinson, take all of these children to their common rooms. Weasely, I’d like you to go to the staff room and notify the heads of house that these students have had a scare.”
He watched as Ron and Pansy’s Patronuses burst forth and stood guard between Lacey and their casters. And then Johnson’s owl was circling their heads, and a silver snake twisted in mid air.
"’Scuse me. Just where do you think you're headed?"
"Potter," Draco said, "You can't complain about Luna. You wouldn't have survived this long without her help"
“Sam doesn’t even like me,” Draco muttered. “They made that very clear from the beginning.” He turned a page in his book to make it seem like he was still studying.
Draco eyed the house. It wasn't what he'd come to think of as Potter's style. For one thing, it was the biggest house on the block, and it looked like he had a team of people for the upkeep. At least this place had light coming from the windows and a wreath on the door. Potter couldn’t be here, but he didn’t have another idea. He knocked.
He stepped back to look at all of them just as an obnoxious voice called out behind him, "Look at that little Weasley shack. Trying to get people to pity them by parading orphans around. Just the kind of thing they would try. It really is a shame. Those boys could have amounted to something if they didn’t insist on associating with garbage.”
Harry smiled grimly. "True. I don't know what I'd do without her help. And yours."
This word came out like a splinter. It hurt on the exit.
"I think you'd be a good teacher. You deserve the position."
He stepped forward, only to freeze again. Something was wrong--there was a sound, interrupting the peace of the night, and a flash of something red-and-gold, and then the swirling of the snow was the only thing he could see.
“I mean,” the boy continued, “I used to have this voice in my head all the time. Not a real voice. A meaner version of me voice. And when I was doing transfigurations, or potions, or flying or defense, the voice would be telling me over and over again that I was useless, and basically a squib, and I’d disappoint my family cuz I’d never be any good at magic. Since you’ve been teaching us about organizing our brain, I know how to notice that voice, and put those thoughts where they belong..”
Harry started pacing the rows, striving to keep his voice even. It was no good shouting at them again. "My fourth Defense professor was actually a Death Eater. It took the whole school most of the year to notice that he wasn't the person he was pretending to be, and in that time, he did a lot of harm. I want you all to be able to recognize when--
Draco's eyes narrowed as he flipped and turned the package, studying it from different angles and casting a quick jinx-detection charm on it.
How was she even speaking at this point? How long had she been fighting this transformation? “Merlin, yes, Lacey. You do yours too.”
Harry stared at the picture, suddenly wishing that he'd asked Luna to paint something less honest. Less obvious. It was Harry and Ron and Hermione and Draco and Pansy. And Neville, because at the last minute Harry had said Luna better at Neville as well, because for reasons Harry didn't understand, Draco and Neville seemed to get on. They were linked together by the golden word, painted again and again in Luna's spidery magical handwriting. Friends, friends, friends, friends.
Harry had a feeling he would end up involved in that one way or another.
But the threat had passed. Lacey was pale and shaking, but she was all real, all human.
It was as if someone had cast Aguamenti at Harry's face. It was dry, and then suddenly it wasn't. Tears and snot were everywhere, and Harry felt only distantly aware that it must be because he was crying.
“Malfoy, how are--”
"Say something," Harry said. "Even if it's just...'Go talk to someone else.'"
Andromeda looked more sharply at Draco's face. "Lucius? You can't be--you're supposed to be in Azkaban."
“Which Potter taught them to do,” Draco interrupted. “I had nothing to do with that.” It sounded impressive that they’d been able to cast the Patronus spell. It was impressive. But Draco had barely learned to cast his own Patronus. He hadn’t taught them anything about that.
“I don’t have any wine to give her,” Draco muttered. He was showing up at the house of a family whose son was dead because of the war and he didn’t even have a good wine to thank them for their hospitality. Luckily he’d been able to get to Hogsmeade to buy a nice selection of chocolates, but they certainly didn’t have any bottles in that town worth purchasing.
“But he’s married to Ginny,” Draco managed. He’d given up his hold on reality. If Claire was mad, he was too, and in this reality, Harry was married and a father. “She’s pregnant. They’re happy.”
"Enough to merit a skeleton crew," Fred said. "If it's real skeletons, please take notes. We should get one of those for the shop."
“There’s nothing wrong with practicing,” Harry said. “It’s not always as easy as the first time.”
Draco couldn’t afford to start a fight, but if he paid that much of his books, he wouldn’t be able to afford everything. Especially if other shop owners had the same bright idea.
“Flattery is the sincerest form of flattery,” Draco observed. “Go on.”
Ugh. Undo the damage. “And I’ll have a better time not spending my holiday with the Weasel-y clan.” He’d tried to call them the Weasel clan, but he’d choked over the word. What kind of soft--
"Or yours."
"I'll deposit the money," Draco promised. "But I'm not sure that Andromeda will let me take Teddy."
“You’re worried about Harry?” Weasley repeated.
and then she’d trailed off with a devious look on her face, and Draco had refused to speak to her until she promised that she would stop saying things that made the whole situation worse.
Break sped by after Christmas, and every day twisted Draco’s internal organs into a tighter knot. Because every day he enjoyed the casual (now that the official match was over) Quidditch in the garden, and the stories from Charlie about dragons, and the laughter around the dinner table. He enjoyed the way Potter jostled him out of the way on the stairs and shot him a cheeky grin. He should not be feeling safe here. He should not be feeling like parts of him he hadn’t noticed had unraveled were knitting themselves back together. This was something that couldn’t last. Worse, he could calculate no way that would allow him to have this again in his future. They’d return to Hogwarts, and he’d take his exams and pray that he got enough NEWTs to make someone want to hire him someday. He’d run into Potter in Diagon Alley someday and maybe Potter would lift a hand in greeting instead of glaring at him, but that was the best he could hope for. This kind of warmth wasn’t something to get used to.
“The what?” Draco frowned. Now that he was actually on the brink of doing this, all of it seemed like a very bad idea. “Are you sure it’s a good idea to take Hagrid? I don’t think the Ministry likes him much, and he certainly doesn’t like me.”
He wouldn’t admit it to Potter, but standing in front of the first year Slytherins and Hufflepuffs was actually making him short of breath. They were staring at him, and he couldn’t read their expressions. Fear. That had to be fear. And disgust? Probably.
“That’s mental,” Ron said. “They can’t expel anyone from Hogwarts. The Headmistress is in charge of that, and I’d like to see anybody--even Kingsley--try to tell McGonagall to sack a student.”
Harry let out a sound. Finally, progress. It was something between a groan and a huff, but still. Maybe he could make words eventually. Maybe he could explain.
He was saved by the flutter of owls in the Great Hall, and a great grey owl swept over their table, dropping a large parcel at Hermione’s hand.
"I got Dudley's leftovers on everything. Clothes. Food. A few toys he though were really dumb. And Petunia and Vernon--that's the aunt and uncle--what they cared about the most was being normal. You can imagine where that left me. I just tried--the only thing that mattered--the thing that I was always going for was to be invisible." Harry swallowed. There was probably something else to say. Some explanation of why that was making him so bad at everything. He needed to figure this out. Sort it. Explain himself.
Fred leaned over the counter to drop a sack of gold on Draco, and George heaved another at him. Draco staggered under the weight before he cast a weightlessness charm on both bags. "Just how much money did you owe the bank?"
He scowled at her. “I’m sorry, maybe I’m too thick to cast a Patronus and too foolish to know when Potter’s trying to help and when he’s having a laugh at me because he disarmed me and he’s still got my wand. Maybe I’ll ask the brightest witch of our age to clue me in.”
Draco smirked, and dark splotches formed on the skin above Potter’s collar.
"Why don't you just pay us everything you have now," one of the goblins suggested, "And then you won't be months behind."
Draco checked the clock. The shop would open at seven, and they’d be on their feet all day. All three of them worked long hours in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and the shop was left a mess after all the little snot-flicking small people left their mark. The parents weren't much better. If he had to listen to another grown witch or wizard demand that he find them a pygmy puff in "a proper boy color" he could not be held responsible for his actions.
Harry opened his mouth and closed it again. There were things--there were so many things that Harry had thought were impossible, but he had just done them anyway. He couldn't tell Draco why this was different because he didn't know the answer himself.
Neville was giving Draco a strange look, but Draco refused to be guilted. Potter had invited this.
Draco didn’t stop himself in time to keep from smirking.
His feet caught a slick patch, and he was on his knees again. It only took seconds for the wetness to start seeping through the knees of his pants.
He sounded like such a mini-Potter. This was what happened when they let the hero teach the first years. First years who thought they could save everybody. Slytherin first years who thought they could save everybody.
Ron stood up quickly. “I’ll come with you, Hermione. I’m almost finished with Potions, and then we could collaborate on the defense work.”
Draco cleared his throat nervously and traced his finger on his own desk. “Not you, Potter. You don’t want to be that wizard.”
Lol, this is going to get both sentimental and preachy. Reader beware:
“Because there are less of the eighth years?” Pansy pointed out. “Look, it’s going to be fine. None of our friends are coming back. Maybe this is a good opportunity to make new friends.” She settled into her seat and propped her head against the window, falling asleep before the train had started lurching forward. She slept a lot these days
say something. “Morning, sleeping beauty.” Draco hadn’t lost his touch for choosing the words that would get to Potter, and he could see the blush get worse.
Claire took his hand and pulled him back a step. "Draco."
At first, Draco held his posture perfectly. They chugged out of the station and into the grey countryside, and he kept as little physical contact between Potter and himself as possible. It didn’t seem like Potter was having any of the same hesitations. He shifted around, knocking their legs against each other.
“Because first-years never do magic that complicated?” Draco put his hand on the door, ready to leave.
"Okay. Um. Thanks for the wish, I suppose. I think we should focus on getting you safely home."
It had made him an expert on quieting the thoughts before they grew into an issue too big to handle. It had made him impervious to his father’s cold stare and even Voldemort’s searching eyes when it came to those kinds of secrets. There was nothing to find because he’d quieted his mind before it even put the thought to words. There was no secret to keep. That was the whole key to Occlumency.
Potter's crew of children marched up to the joke shop only fifteen minutes after ten the next morning. Draco thought that was decent, all things considered, but Potter was looking ragged for it. Luna was with them, to keep the kids in line while Potter was available for photos. As great as Luna was with the kids, keeping them in line wasn't one of her strong suits.
“Time for catch-up!” Ron howled. “Shots for both of you.”
“And you’re not that dark,” Ron returned.
It wasn’t, he mused as he shucked off his robes and slid into a comfortable pajama top, as though he’d never imagined Potter seeing the scars he’d caused with his impulsive curse. Before the war, he’d imagined it a hundred different ways. The boys changing for a Quidditch match and Potter’s eyes tracing his chest, his face changing from smug success to horror and shame. Potter apologizing. Draco rebuffing it at first, but eventually giving him a chance to make it up to him. Potter touching the scar. Tracing it with his finger tip.
Harry started by sitting in the empty defense classroom, hoping that Malfoy would read his letter and find him on the map and come to be with him in real life. But sitting still was hard. Sitting turned into pacing,and then he walked to the back of the room, through the door that was always ominously ajar, and into the Defense office.
“What did McGonagall say?”
"Sure," Draco said, "He says things like that. He exaggerates things."
His words seemed to startle McGonagall, who cleared her throat. "As you should, Potter. As we all should"
“Why didn’t he lead with that?” Draco raged.
“Oh. Yeah. Myrtle and Hermione worked out a deal, I think.”
"Do whatever you like," Draco answered, hoping that whatever color the frocks ended up, they'd be on the kids in fifteen minutes.
“In that case, three drops each, boys, and run each other through the tester questions.”
“Have you got the Leg-lock jinx?”
“I’m not the professor,” Potter replied, looking awkward. “I’m just—facilitating.”
She gestured towards the fireplace. “There’s firewhiskey over there without anything weird in it.”
She’d looked at it for a moment, then back at Draco in concern. “Aren’t these a bit--obvious?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione tried to tune them out and complete her arithmancy, but it wasn’t just Harry and Malfoy she had to ignore. Half the castle seemed to be coming through to gawk at the Slytherin and Gryffindor holding hands under the table. At one point, a group of Durmstrang students bumbled into the room and made for the tables behind the new couple. But when they tried to pass Hermione, they stopped in the exact way that Professor Moody had during class, as though they’d run into an invisible wall.
“Don’t tell me,” Granger frowned. “He’s sneaking around, he’s not eating, he’s probably up to something.”
“He did. You should have seen him, smirking and gloating from the moment he walked in the room.”
"And I'm going to say one more thing, for good measure: The world is a better place because you're alive in it. I'm glad you're here."
Because it was late evening by the time they made it back to the castle. They’d missed dinner, but he didn’t care. He could--well, he couldn’t make food out of something else. But his magic was his again, and he could wait until tomorrow morning for food.
There were so many bad things that had been spinning through his mind all this year, but there had been the good things, like anchors. The things he could come back to. Ron and Hermione. Draco. And now one of those things, one of his favorite things, was falling all to shit because he didn't know how to do this properly.
"I don't understand what I did wrong. I thought it was better to not bring it up after you stormed off on me."
Draco's shoulders slumped. "I don't want to. But I don't want to go on feeling stupid. Everything else is such shit all the time. I don't have a clue how I’m going to make it through next year, and there are so many years in front of us, which should be a good thing but just feels terrifying. You are the thing I like best about my life, but I'm the only one who feels that way."
What a classic Hogwarts staffing choice. No one else was available, so why not use someone who hadn’t finished his own education, much less had any formal training in the curriculum? Leave it to Potter to think he could finish his classes while also teaching three. It was only the weakest of consolations that it seemed to be wrecking him.
Malfoy swallowed. He'd known that was coming. "They lost out to Lockhart."
Malfoy stood on the stairs, clearly scanning the crowd for Harry, but his face was shuttered and emotionless. Maybe he’d gotten tired of toying with Harry. But his cool expression had no effect on Harry, who approached him with a grin and took Malfoy’s hand. Harry launched into a description of what had happened during Charms, completely oblivious to the whispers and stares of everyone else in the hallway. Before the two of them turned away, Hermione saw Malfoy’s expression soften and lift into a smile.
Draco gave one last squeeze, then let Teddy squirm out of his arms. The rest of the kids from the home gathered around, all talking at once. Draco made a quick swipe at his eyes and catalogued them all. Holly, Alana, and Maya. Jamie and Zoe. All of them alive and well and here, right where they belonged.
“Ron?” Hermione’s eyebrows drew together. “I know you and Harry like seeing Snuffles, but don’t you think it’s for the best--”
"Of course I am," Draco said, disentangling himself from the hug ambush. "I don't know what the big deal is. I'm just a little late."
At too great cost:
"She's not the Weasley girl anymore," Claire reminded helpfully. Draco’s gut twisted again. “The children’s home doesn’t exist because you weren’t there to help him make it through the first year. He got married to Ginny instead. The Holyhead Harpies haven’t had a winning season since.”
And then the sympathy gagging started. Harry rushed to clean up the mess and open the window, sending a breath of fresh air through the classroom. Still, by the time the two students were gone and everyone had stopped gagging and complaining about how gross the room smelled, Harry couldn't remember what he'd been saying. Something about transformations and disguises. He sighed.
“Before he taught me the spell, Lupin told me that it was one of the trickiest spells, and that many full grown wizards never learned it.”
“The economy is a little unsteady these days,” the clerk responded, matter of fact. “Surely you understand.”
Potter barked out a laugh and actually lifted his head. “You’re funny.”
"You didn't have patents on anything?" Draco had raged, looking from one rather dispirited twin to the other.
"Malfoy!" The voice called behind him. "Why are you running? Stop."
Several hands went up around the class, and Draco pointed to a Hufflepuff in the third row with hair in dozens of narrow braids. “It’s shielding your mind.”
"Give early, give often," George added.
"Are you feeling well?" Claire asked, leaning close to study his face.
Of course. So he knew everything. Draco tried to force full lungfuls of air in and out instead of sharp short sips.
"Of course. You fought by their side that day after Harry rescued you from the Room of Hidden Things. They still won the battle without you," she offered. "We're not living in Voldemort's world. But Fred didn't make it."
"What? Of course I do. I touch you all the time. And snog you, and--well, some other things as well, although not nearly as often as I'd like to."
Pansy sat up and sent Draco a very serious frown. “Draco, I would appreciate it if you could actually act like a Slytherin for about five minutes and take advantage of the fame.”
“Um.”
Ron laughed, pushing the door all the way open and leading Hermione and Potter in after him. “Nice try, Draco. You’re going to have to do better than that if you want to get rid of us.”
“I don’t see any reasons to switch rooms.” It was hard to tell if his wide smile was meant to be comforting or mocking. “Unless you’re scared, Malfoy.”
“Right. And if you can’t even trust me, how will any of the others?” Draco hated that the hurt seeped out into his voice. He waited, but Potter couldn’t even formulate the beginning of a sentence this time. “That’s what I thought. Goodnight, Potter.”
Claire took another bite of her cookie and chewed like she was stalling for time. "I don't know what to tell you. It wasn't easy for them. I can’t say they’re all okay."
How was Draco supposed to help with this? He had tried to teach them what he did. Or what he was supposed to do. He tried not to teach them to stifle everything inside them, just to recognize them so they weren’t frightened when they found the thoughts in the wild
Draco administered himself three drops of their (admittedly gloopy) potion, and Potter did the same. Around the room, the other partners were in the middle of the same process.
Draco turned his shoulders away from her. Pansy was as guilty as the rest.
Ron looked at Hermione with a little smile tucked in the corner of his mouth. “Of course she is. That’s what Hermione does best: get worked up about things and drag me into the middle of them."
“I thought it would be better to be warned now than to find out in the middle of the feast.”
I'm sorry. I meant to apologize, and then I went on being terrible. I've been meaning to write you since the night that I got stuck in my thoughts and your owl reminded me that I had a better place to be: our bedroom, with a stack of sweets, and someone who likes me.
People flooded into the room--schoolmates like Neville and the Greengrass sisters, shopkeepers from the menagerie and the bookstore, professors and ministry officials. And one by one, they each made their way to the piano, where Fred and George were beating out a rhythm on a laundry tub.
Red for the brave
She looked up. "Sure. Oh. Did you mean privately? Ugh, Harry, you want me to get up?"
It was that Harry that had started appearing on the packages of the Daydream Dummies and Five-minute Fancies whenever Draco stocked the shelves.
Jamie looked up at him. "I know," he snapped. "That's the problem."
“Ravenclaw!” proclaimed the hat, and Ravenclaws cheered.
The door rattled open again, and Draco spun around, heart already thumping in his ears. There was Harry, a red-and-gold scarf sloppily looped around his neck and mountains of snow resting on his black curls.
"Mr. Lockhart," he started. "You haven't seen any money around here, have you?"
“Then maybe I’ll stay with you.”
The boy flinched, and Draco tried to arrange his features into something more pleasant.
The first trouble was at the Leaky Cauldron. Draco knew better than to expect a knowing nod from the bartender. The patrons of the Leaky tolerated Draco, but they didn't like him hanging around. He hadn't expected Tom the bartender to hold up a hand when he headed for the backdoor.
Draco quickly ducked into one of the empty compartments, and Pansy joined him.
The blinking eyes had caught him off guard, and for a second he wasn’t sure what he’d meant to say. “You. Being a disaster of a human being.”
“Yes, we know, Draco. Potter Stinks.”
Oh. They weren’t exaggerating when they said something weird was happening. Lacey wasn’t crying or having a panic attack.
"Maybe there isn't an answer?" Healer Goodnight ventured.
Moving in with Andromeda had been as uncomfortable as anything else in the year right after the war. His mother had gone about the matchmaking, writing to Andromeda about how important it was for Draco to align himself with the right sort of witches and wizards at this crucial time. In other words, she and Lucius were on house arrest, but she didn't want Draco getting lumped into that. And, she reasoned, Andromeda would need help with little Teddy.
He burst out laughing.
He walked in, swinging the door open wide, and stared at the mess. When had it gotten this bad? Remus had packed up all his things into his trunk and left properly at the end of the year, but had anyone ever cleaned out all of Quirrell's things? When Lockhart was packed off to Saint Mungo's, had anyone gathered his personal effects? There were an overabundance of pink knick knacks lying around, and he'd already scavenged would-be Moody tools from the room. The really dark-looking bits and pieces in here might have been from a Carrow. But this was a Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom--he supposed they could really be anybody's.
“If anyone can do it,” he whispered. “It’s this lot. They’ve been trained by Potter.”
Draco waved away her concern. “You don't have to sound good, you just have to sound heartfelt.”
Lockhart laughed his smarmy chuckle. "Well that's a bit convenient, isn't it? The store owners give the underpaid shopboy more than he'll see in a year of salaries, and suddenly it disappears. You really think anyone will buy that story?"
They split the students into two groups, and Harry-as-Draco instructed his group to keep a journal of their emotions throughout the week. He'd chosen some of the tougher students for this group, the ones he worried about. When he was being Draco, they all listened to every word he said, even when he went on and on about their journals. Maybe having the power to read your students minds really was the key to being an effective teacher. He set them to writing and watched Draco with the other half of the class.
"Many people find a lot of meaning and satisfaction in their jobs. Graduating from school and deciding on a career path is an exciting rite of passage. But you have choices, Harry. Don't make this decision because you feel like you owe something." She glanced at the clock and leaned forward in her chair. "Now, we changed your appointment to an earlier time today so you could attend the last Quidditch match. You better head back to the castle--I know how crowded the stands can get."
Draco stood up abruptly. “It’s just the price of surviving when no one wants us around.” And with that, he strode away from the table, trying to control his breathing, trying to starve the predatory thoughts.
She gave him a withering glare. "First of all, this is not about me. It's about you. Remember, I came here to rescue you. Second of all, I'm not a witch, Draco. And I wasn't a witch when I was alive, either. I'm an angel."
"It's great." Harry felt a little breathless. Draco still hadn't said anything to him. He wasn't even really looking at Harry. Harry slid into the seat next to Draco and gave his hand a quick squeeze. "Happy birthday." He wanted to say something that would make up for the fact that this wasn't the first thing he'd said to Draco this morning. Now he was trying to be extra cheery. He was smiling the way Hermione had when she spotted him, and he knew it looked odd and forced.
"You actually know where he lives?"
It was a bad night. There had been so many okay nights lately that the badness of it grabbed Harry and shook him hard. This time the nightmare was Colin Creevey, laying destroyed in the Great Hall. He'd been a good fighter. A good student. In the end, none of it had protected him.
Harry’s forehead creased. “We went to school together? I’m sorry, I don’t remember. It’s possible I’ve blocked something out.”
Harry scrubbed a hand down his face. “I know that. I know it every day and every single night.”
Molly and Ginny Weasley seemed to be entrenched in a war over priorities. Mrs. Weasley wanted her children’s help cleaning and decorating the house to prepare for the holidays and seemed to want the extra guests perpetually busy with warm tea. Ginny Weasely, on the other hand, wanted every person who was slated to be on her Quidditch team out on their makeshift pitch every daylight moment--and for moonlight practices.
Despite himself, Draco could feel a smile forming on his face. This was serious. He had all but given up on keeping his thoughts from centering around Potter, but he couldn’t afford to start grinning like a Hufflepuff every time Potter walked into the room. “I’m studying, Potter. Not all of us have jobs promised to us after Hogwarts.”
See? I warned you it would be sentimental and preachy. Love y'all, and thanks for reading.
“Is that what you’re so pouty about? Granger and I want compatible things.”
Throughout the rest of the morning and afternoon, Draco heard snatches of the children's songs through the open shop door. Keeping the kids busy with singing practice was one of the ways Harry stayed sane, and they'd sung at ministry events or fundraiser dinners before. This wasn't new for them. All the same, Draco wished he could have spent more time out there, making sure that Holly was alright and that Jamie wasn't trying to scale the building, and less time trying to return lost five-year-olds to their frazzled parents.
Harry wasn't sure he agreed. Hogwarts was in a sticky situation, and Draco had seen an opportunity.
He didn't have time for wandering anymore, or worrying about taking Claire to the hospital. He had to know that Andromeda and Teddy were alive and safe. He ran through the streets, his footsteps skidding and slipping every time he changed directions. There--even from the end of the block, he could see a candle in the window. The rest of the world could be upside down, but Teddy would be alright. He collided with the door, knocking urgently.
Hermione stood, brushing her hands on her robes. “I think the two of you can handle it from here. But honestly, if you’re not talking this evening, we’re going to Pansy’s plan, which was to lock you both in a closet and see if the hormones take over. See you both at dinner.”
“Ooh!” hooted Weasley as the small crowd of eighth years made their way into the passage, “Somebody’s in trouble.”
Draco slid away and took a step back. “What? Potter, when I said that this teaching situation is making you balmy, I wasn’t looking for an invitation to come along for the ride.”
Draco looked to Potter for some backup, but Potter was looking at Draco with the same blank expression. "Do you want money, or something?"
“It’s easier to keep an eye on you. Are you going to keep interrogating me?”
“No. That’s just it, Malfoy. It’s not the magic that’s so tricky. It’s the happiness.”
And he couldn't go home to Andromeda. Or Teddy. He didn't want the Aurors to come shouting in, waving their wands and shooting spells at him while Teddy cowered and cried. He would at least keep that unspoken promise to Andromeda. He wouldn't bring the trouble home, to Teddy.
Dearest Draco,
Draco buried his face in his hands. “He said that I must really miss Snape.
In other circumstances, Harry might have found this funny. It was certainly very Ginny.
Harry laughed. “I don’t think I’d be good enough for any of those professional teams. Besides, the press, the fans. I’ve had enough of that.”
Draco managed a smirk, but there was a bright flush climbing up from his collar, and Harry grinned.
“I must have missed the memo that Granger and you were blood sisters.
There was a series of crashes and the sound of something ceramic breaking, and Harry looked over to see Draco frowning down at the debris that had fallen out of a cardboard box. "I know that you find everything Slytherin stands for disgusting." Draco's voice strained as he tried to keep it even. "But it's not about
Potter twisted his quill on the table. “The first years.”
Draco shrugged. "They like me, too. They trust me. I wouldn't have told McGonagall I thought I could do the job, otherwise."
Was this some kind of joke? Draco took another step toward his room.
The shop was at full swing that day when the bell rang and Draco spied a head of black curls jammed under a red-and-gold stocking hat. He busied himself helping a little girl pick out just the right gift for her best friend. "I want something that will make her laugh every time she sees it," the girl said, and Draco showed her to the Chocolate Hogs, whose collectable cards were full of bizarre fabrications about famous witches and wizards throughout the ages.
The boy’s voice faded, and Draco started to make a graceful exit.
The plan was the only thing that had given Draco the strength to floo out of the house today.
Granger frowned. “Is it like the trace?”
Harry set down his fork, and Draco felt another punch to the gut as he took in the scene. Harry was sitting across the table from a very pregnant Ginny Weasley. They both looked charming and shocked in the candlelight.
The anxiety, which had only abated in the slightest, rolled back over him like a wave, and Draco found himself clutching the counter.
“What is it?” he managed.
about my
This time when he caught Potter’s eyes and Potter looked away, it wasn’t accompanied by that little thrill of victory. In fact, it felt awful. They were in the bathroom, and Potter was finishing up with a cleaning charm on his teeth when Draco came in with his muggle-style toothbrush because using a cleaning charm every night on his teeth might be deemed too much magic.
A strange feeling stirred in Draco at those words. He starved a thought, no thanks to Pansy staring at him, open-mouthed.
With a shove, Draco expelled Potter from his mind and focused back on the students before them. “Simple Occlumency is like a shield, or a brick wall. You hold the other person out of your mind. But if you’ve done that, it’s already too late. They know that you’re hiding something.”
Oh. Draco should check that. His chest ached and he wasn’t sure he was actually breathing. He heaved air into his lungs and pulled the broom out from under him. “Fine,” he muttered. “My body broke my fall.”
Draco felt tears burning in his eyes, and he knuckled them out of the way. "Claire!" he shouted. "Undo this. Please. Please. Claire, I want to live again." He squinted his eyes closed, remembering how Claire had been talking to someone beyond herself, and whispered fiercely. "Please. I want to live again."
Draco took a ragged breath.
Speaking of your father, he reports that he would like to hear more of you and less of Potter in your next letter. He seems concerned that your interest in him has become...unhealthy. I’m sure you just need an opportunity to vent, but we are both much more interested in your progress and achievements than whatever the Potter boy has gotten up to.
There was no mistaking the disappointment in the Headmistresses eyes, even as she forced a smile. "The Ministry will be thrilled to hear it."
“I know you’re not happy now, and that makes it hard to find happiness anywhere in your own memory. Casting your patronus isn’t about forgetting that you’re sad or afraid right now, but it is about knowing that there are other things you’ve felt. It hasn’t always been this. Find something that works, Sam.”
Draco wasn’t sure exactly where his frustration stemmed from. But it poked at the inside of his chest like a burning needle. “You told me I can’t learn to cast a patronus,” he snapped. “No matter how strong of a wizard I am, or how many times I practice the damn incantation, I can’t do it because I can’t manage my own happiness. How the hell does any of this matter if I can’t--if I’m not--” He shouldn’t have risked a glance at Potter then, but he did, and Potter’s eyes were pooled with pity.
Healer Goodnight frowned. Today she was wearing earcuffs that glimmered with tufts of dandelion fluff, and she fiddled with one of them as she studied Harry. It was the only thing that changed about her appearance from week to week, Harry realized. The black robes were the same as always, her hair, her shoes. Everything was the same. He wondered if that was some gesture of goodwill toward her patients. Trying to keep things consistent.
just let it be. And we weren’t powerful enough to make them listen to us. But they have to listen to me now.”
But--Merlin help him--it was Potter’s smile that really made him agree.
It hadn’t gone well. The next day, Fred had tossed a copy of the Daily Prophet on top of the pile of Daydream Dummies that Draco was straightening.
As they crunched through the snow, Hermione was full of last minute advice, like “Draco, please don’t let them goad you into saying anything pretentious and terrible,” and “Pansy, you have to sit up and look at them. They’re the ones who are generally nincompoops about laws and ethics, and they’ve been doing it much longer than any of us.”
“We’re not going to beat Harry by sitting around and eating Christmas biscuits!” she railed when Percy complained about squeezing in another practice after dinner.
Draco swallowed and forced his voice out as evenly as possible. "I understand if this changes things. If I need to lay low for a while, or if you need to make a show of sacking me."
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice was ragged. “You don’t want to make them listen to you like that.”
The next thing Draco knew, he was standing just inside the door of Gringotts, holding a deposit slip.
"Of course you did," she said. She sounded quite pleased, even though her teeth were chattering. Draco started up the steep bank. "But only because I knew that if I fell in the water, you would jump in to save me instead of hurting yourself."
“Then you understand why I’ve got to teach it. Or why it’s got to be taught, at least. It’s Defense Against the Dark Arts, Malfoy.”
But Draco was
Draco bristled and stood. Of course. Harry was keeping an eye on him. Like the war was still on, at least for him. He let out a long breath. He needed it to be over.
Had the Pepper-up potion worn off? It was impossible to know--Draco’s pulse was pounding and his brain spinning.
“Uh, Hermione. You’re the cleverest person I know, and you make things happen, and I--I really like being with you. And I think Harry’s going to be busy on the next Hogsmeade weekend. Do you think just the two of us should--”
“I couldn’t let her go back. To that. To--”
More drama + shenanigans in the Defense office.
Harry laughed, looking around the room. They had run into a few stacks of things, and Harry had made a grand sweeping gesture and cleared everything off the desk with one motion so that they could climb on top of it, which had just made Draco roll his eyes and mutter about how many priceless artifacts Harry was trying to destroy in one night, exactly, before he climbed gamely onto the desk.
Harry blinked rapidly. That could not be right. There were so many times in a day when Harry thought about how he wanted to take Draco's hand, or pull Draco over to his side, or rest his head on Draco's shoulder. He always wanted to have some small part of him making contact with Draco. It was the best way he had of understanding what people really meant when they said attraction--it was that magnetic pull.
Draco kept the shock from his face and his voice. “I suppose you have some rudimentary understanding, then. Does anyone know what Occlumency is?”
“What if they never get another teacher who teaches them what they need? What if their next teacher is the one they need to defend themselves from?”
Draco tucked the petals into his pocket. "There. Now your bouquet only looks slightly mangled. Now one will suspect you of crimes against flowers."
"But I can't work for the Ministry properly. I'm not going to commit to that," Harry said. "I'm going to stick at figuring out what's going on in my head and how to live with everything."
“Alright.” Draco gestured toward the floo. “After you.”
Oh? Draco eyes lifted to analyze Potter without shifting his head. Potter had a stupid smile on his face and couldn’t seem to stand still. What the hell would Potter want to talk about that would make him look like that?
Sam grabbed Draco’s robe again. “What’s happening to her? We don’t want to get sent away, we want to help.”
Draco didn't have extra hands to button up his coat, but George unlocked and opened the door for him, and he trudged into the night.
As Harry prepared to go, he looked around the room. He'd gotten used to this place, to the non-magic surface of things and the magic hidden just below. It seemed right. It still wasn't a place that he was comfortable. He felt nervous about coming here and facing Healer Goodnight every single week. But he'd done it enough times now that he was getting used to this. Maybe that was part of not being a ghost: getting used to new things, finding new ways to tie himself to life.
She raised an eyebrow. "You tried to help yourself to one. You told me all the reasons why it would be foolish not to consider you. Why are you surprised now that you've got your offer?"
Pansy tilted her chin, studying Draco. “You don’t think it makes it rather clear that you’re obsessed with him?
When the first years streamed into the class, Draco-as-Harry bounced on the balls of his feet by the door, greeting them, and Harry-as-Draco stood at the front of the classroom, waiting for them all to take their seats.
“We can trade rooms, Potter. People have legitimate concerns about your safety.” He might as well say it before anyone else made comments about him being a danger to Potter’s life.
Harry did not now, nor did he ever, want to hear any part of this conversation between Ginny and Draco.
“I’m just saying, it’s suspicious,” Ron repeated. “Krum trying to get so close to Hermione when we know his school’s the dark one. You agree with me, don’t you, mate?”
Draco did not want Potter in his head just at the moment. It was too agitated, everything was pulsing and edging out of place. But that was the test of an Occlumens. To seem like there was nothing to hide when there was.
“Yeah,” Finnegan cracked, “Otherwise we end up with crackpots like our current defense professor.”
“He didn’t do anything wrong,” Harry said quickly. “We were both--” he pointedly avoided looking at Hermione, “confused.”
“You’re saying you’ve got no supervision and they don’t even know what you’ve been doing with the first years.”
Draco glowered at her. This was just the sort of situation where he needed his own wand so he could send a stinging hex or a lip-lock jinx at her. “The fact remains,” he drawled. “Potter just wanted to hold me back so he could flaunt that he’s still got my wand and that my magic is piss-poor because of it.”
The front steps were slippery, and he sat down abruptly in the snow. Cold shocked his hands and back, and it seemed to be exactly what he'd needed to snap back into full consciousness. The dizziness and confusion disappeared, and he was left with reality: He’d lost everything the Weasley's had worked for.
"Yes. Most definitely. But don't go telling people about that, understand?"
But he wasn’t sure the code would fool any of the other eighth years, so he hissed.
Draco stopped. He didn’t want to talk about it, he was still shaking, and now that the adrenaline was fading, he felt exhausted. He hadn’t slept the night before, and today had felt like at least four days. But it was Neville. Neville wasn’t doing this to make some kind of joke about how he was the least likely hero. He turned around, feeling super aware of every motion of his body.
When he stood up, he found himself face-to-face with Potter.
Draco returned to brushing his teeth and tried to sound casual. “The ministry wasn’t very specific about what was considered unnecessary magic. I’m allowed to use magic for class."
"Yes, Penny, you can--"
In fact, they weren’t engaging with him at all. Hermione was holding a hefty tome that he couldn’t see the title of.  Ron had a similar one open next to his plate, and was scanning the text with fervor.
The girl, who had somehow gotten ahead of him and was standing at the edge of the road, called down, "I don't always make the smartest choice in a pinch. But I do always take action."
"Claire? Claire?" She hadn’t followed him this time; she was gone. Maybe she'd run out of time, or someone in charge had finally realized that he wasn't the kind of person who deserved angels.
Hermione and Ron passed by in their Auror robes and called out greetings to the children. Draco lifted a hand in greeting, then turned back to the kids. "I've got to go hide in the store so I don't scare away all the customers that you little goblins draw in."
But Potter wasn’t, and he deserved it if anyone did.
“I heard a couple of the seventh years on the platform talking about the housing situation. They said all the eighth years are going to be together in one dorm.”
Draco continued in the calmest voice he could muster, “I think you’re hosting a Defense Against the Dark Arts exam in the hall outside Gryffindor tower. That’s what’s happening.” The place on her arm where Draco’s hand rested felt more substantial for a moment, as if he was holding onto a person and not a very dense ghost.
Pansy perked up. “Is that Angelina’s brother?”
“As much fun as it would be to drag this out over the rest of the year, I already decided I want to be able to focus on schoolwork for this small, promising window. So we’re going to put this to rest now.” Hermione said.
There was a flicker of emotion across Draco's face. "Just curious," he said, keeping his voice light.
“Um,” Potter faltered.
Neville was smiling wryly. “I think I learned all my hexes from you, so…”
“It’s only nine, Malfoy. I don’t intend to keep you up until the wee hours of the morning.”
But Draco hadn't stopped to listen. They were technically his bosses, but that was exactly why he had to do this. They couldn't be the ones threatening the competition, and they'd be terrible at it anyway, since subtlety was not in the Weasley's skill set. But the shop had to be protected, and that left Draco.
"A mess for later." Draco opened another drawer, this time with his wand at the ready.
Draco-as-Harry slid into a student desk and fidgeted and peeked through the whole exercise. Harry thought it was a bit much, but none of the students noticed any difference.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he replied rather too quickly.
Draco was ready to die from embarrassment. "No," he protested. "Nobody needs to--" But it was too late. Everyone was already dumping purses and pocketfuls of galleons into the pot.
Harry grinned at Draco.
Hermione let out a long sigh, as if she was the one being patient with them and not the other way around. “Harry, can you tell us what you said to Malfoy in the library the other day?
Draco snatched the note off his bed and started reading.
Of course there was an unusually strong and specific version of the Trace on both of them, and strict rules about using “unnecessary magic.” The wand Draco’s mother lent him had lived idly on his desk most of the summer. It was lethargic, and it felt wrong to use it often. Besides, it was hard to know what “unnecessary magic” entailed.
The cashier leaned back and for a moment; her impatience reminded Draco of Pansy. He stooped to scoop up the money and get air into his lungs.
“Harry, do you want to explain why you’re, one, avoiding us, and two, storming through the corridors threatening to “burn the entire castle, every tree in the forbidden forest, and especially the damn Whomping Willow to the ground” if the headmaster of the school doesn’t make time to see you?”
"Donations for the keep Draco Malfoy out of Azkaban Again fund," Fred hollered.
“Professor Malfoy?”
The class gasped and several students turned around, only to witness her doing it again. Draco took several steps toward her, but Potter beat him to the girl, casting a cushioning charm effortlessly with one hand and then bracing her shoulders with the other.
“Yes. It’s fading.” Harry's eyes opened, sharp and on guard. It was another expression that Draco knew well. “Why?”
"Festive?" Draco suggested.
Harry opened his mouth. "I can't teach here next year."
Harry was the only teacher using the Defense room that didn't have another real classroom with its own office. If he’d had time, he could have cleaned this out at the beginning of the year and used it all along. Maybe there would have been less instances of him frantically searching the dorms for lost student work. But the office had always seemed like such an overwhelming project.
“Sorry,” Potter answered. It was a wonder in itself that Harry didn’t snap back some kind of smart response. Maybe it had to do with the way Draco spoke--could Harry hear concern in his voice? “I was…”
"Malfoy?"
“Lately,” Harry continued in a voice that was much more careful, “I’ve been thinking about becoming a Professor at Hogwarts. Maybe not right away. But--”
"And I always have to pester you into doing things with me. And you give in, most of the time, but it's not equal, Harry. I knew from the start that I liked you more. I thought it wouldn't matter because I was so happy that you were giving me a chance. But it matters, because I feel so stupid all the time waiting and hoping that you're ever going to catch up to me."
Potter started, drawing another line in ink across his cheek. “Shit, Malfoy.”
Seamus looked at the lot of them, shocked. “Viktor Krum? Both of you? He’s all scowly and duck-footed.”
It was wonderful.
Neville eyed the punch bowl in the middle of the table. “What about this?”
It would also be nice if he had saved some of his floo powder for the coldest days of the year instead of squandering it in October when it had been raining but otherwise passable. Fred and George hollered at him every time he walked home, saying there was a tub of floo powder by the fireplace. But it was the businesses powder, and it was expensive. They lived farther and needed to use it more than he did. It felt like a small way to make up for all the money that he cost them.
Potter’s eyes were hard and his chin tilted up, so the light from the window was filtering through his messy curls and making his skin look like gold. Draco knew this look, too, the look of the boy savior, the one people would follow to the end of the world. The one people had.
Puzzling. Everyone cared about Potter. Everyone was grateful to him. “Granger? The Weasleys?”
“We’re not giving anybody the idea that we’ve let bygones be bygones if we only talk in the 8th year common room. It’s the younger ones we really need to convince.” Pansy sounded like she was talking to convince Granger. He wasn’t going to be able to complain about the lesson if Granger was here, spying on everything.
Hermione looked at Ron. She thought she’d gotten over being stunned by the strangeness of this week, but once again, she was speechless.
He looked up. Someone was approaching him through the swirling snow, someone in Ministry robes. His heart lurched, and he reached for his wand, forgetting that it no longer existed. Only--there it was again, in the pocket of his coat.
“Thirty? For the same books?”
” he mimicked instead. “Is that all you can think to say, Potter? Has my stunning physique robbed you of intelligent thought?"
Pansy looked amused. “And when did you have the time to create this system?”
“You did tell her that’s the nicer term, right?”
Draco looked up through his eyelashes to see that Potter was shifting in his seat and dull flush was creeping up from his collar. “Maloy knows what I said and how he responded. I don’t see what good repeating that conversation is going to do anyone.”
"Not until I make sure you're somewhere safe," he muttered. "Although if we happen to encounter any fatal accidents on the way, I wouldn't complain."
Draco felt fear light up in him like a spark, but he kept his face still and didn’t look at the others. Ron was sputtering, but the headmaster wasn’t stopping to address his objections.
Harry opened his mouth and closed it. The whole point of having a counselor like her was to make sure that he could tell her the things, all the things. Still--this was a lot to tell anyone.
Hermione chimed in. “And they were all piling onto each other to tell him how they’d already tried things they learned from class. And in the end, they all cast their Patronuses, even the girl who was transforming."
“You really should go, you know.”
Back in fourth year he’d been so thrilled at the Potter Stinks badges he’d created, especially with the magic that made it so you couldn’t change the message. It was tricky spellwork, and by the time he’d finished the first batch his hair had been hanging limply out of its gelled location and his face had been flushed with effort.
Harry startled. Draco realized that encountering Draco in the dark was probably not what Harry had anticipated. He looked closely at Harry’s face, expecting to see thunderclouds--but Harry looked more sad than angry. He was silent for so long Draco thought he wasn’t going to get an answer, but then he cleared his throat. “Thank you for being there. I should have been."
Andromeda cut a thick slice of meat pie and poured a cup of tea for Draco. "You eat all of that," she said. "You've been working too hard."
Harry swallowed. He knew Ginny didn’t pull any punches before he’d come to talk to her. He must have been looking for this kind of truth.
But of course it couldn’t be that simple. The snitch dropped, falling past Ginny’s ear and over Percy’s hair. Draco urged his broom into a dive. The few inches he’d still had on Harry were melting away, but the glittering orb had pulled up short a few yards from the ground. If he could get the angle right--he stretched forward, feeling the slight wobble of his broom beneath him. Harry wasn’t even reaching yet. This was it, this was finally going to be his victory. One final stretch--
“I had the Gryffindor first years today."
*** *** ***
"Mmm. Maybe not. Last time I opened a package from you I ended up with a green nose."
Of course, during their next Defense class, Potter thought he should facilitate Draco into greater misery by announcing the good news in front of all the other eighth years. “Draco’s got his Patronus!”
“Harry didn’t really laugh at you,” Hermione protested.
Smoky light was coming from the end of the wand.
He stomped through the fresh snow. "Claire. I know you think you're helping, but you're not. You have no idea what a mess I've gotten everyone in. All my friends. My family. I've destroyed everything they've worked for."
“Good morning,” Draco returned, wishing that Pansy could communicate to him what role he was supposed to be playing at the moment.
She said it as though she still wasn't sure that Harry was telling the truth, as if she thought that he had an invisibility cloak, but probably not really one that could let him hide from death.
And there was a picture of Lockhart himself, arm in arm with Harry Potter.
"They're beautiful," Draco said.
There was a lot of fuss over everyone’s piles of presents in the morning. Draco had received a small package of sweets from his mother and opened it slowly while the Weasleys dug through their home-knitted sweaters. Mrs. Weasley opened the chocolates from Draco. He hadn’t had anything for anyone else, and was relieved when they didn’t have gifts for him either. He owed Hermione for taking on his case, but that wasn’t something he could cover with a Christmas gift.
Maybe they already knew about the missing money. Maybe the Aurors had already been here, looking for him.
Draco tore his hand from Claire’s, and at first his feet moved woodenly. He picked up speed at the end of the block and turned onto Diagon Alley again. His legs were hurting, and he didn't think these boots were meant for that much running. And none of that would have mattered, but everything inside him was crumbling.
So Draco had practiced starving his thoughts, the art of not letting things stick.
It was just typical of Draco to walk in on Harry when he was in the midst of losing a fight with a cursed quill. "Arresto momentum," he tried. "Reducto. Get
Was that supposed to make Draco feel better? “So these first years are just exceptionally powerful wizards and witches, then?” He could hear the heat and frustration dripping with his words. He shouldn’t let Potter think he cared about the spell. He shouldn’t let Potter think that Azkaban and its guards were always waiting for his watch to drop so they could invade his thoughts.
He was making it to the Great Hall for more meals lately. It shouldn't feel like a big deal, but the wave of noise washed over him, and Harry stood still in the midst of the chaos for a moment, breathing. These were happy sounds. This was good chaos. He found the glow of Malfoy's head from the entrance and kept his eyes locked on that beacon as he made his way across the hall.
“McGonagall thought that since so many of us have already been teaching each other defense, fifth year and last year, that this could be an independent study. Sort of. We all have a lot of experiences with the dark arts. More than most people who could be our instructor. So they left it up to me to create a curriculum and they said we could have guests come in if needed but...”
It was a pleasure to hear from you on Sunday, as always. We are also anticipating some exciting turns of events during the Tri-Wizard tournament, but I am happy to hear about them from a distance. I would rather you stay far away as well, but I suppose I can’t stop you from attending school events, can I? I do wonder sometimes if Hogwarts is a safe place to send children. Your father has spoken of transferring you, and there are times that seems prudent.
he was only going to get sharper with her.
"Merlin, I know. It feels awful. It feels like I broke her trust."
"Is to wait," Draco-as-Harry added, grinning as his hair paled and flattened. Harry looked away. The transformation was uncomfortable to watch, and it was much more entertaining to watch the expressions on the students' faces as they looked on in horror.
By the time Fred and George came in at half past eight, Potter was gesturing wildly with his teacup while he complained about how good Maya was at delaying bedtime, and Draco was marveling at the miracle that Potter wasn't even angry when Draco laughed. Instead, Potter had started laughing, too.
“She doesn’t like it anyway,” Pansy frowned. “I should go talk to her.”’
“Draco. Relax.”
Hearing him describe Crabbe as a classmate, as if they’d had any kind of connection, startled Draco. He cleared his throat. “It’s not really the same. It’s a whole different space. The room of hidden things is probably gone forever. Destroyed.”
"Wow, there's a cake," Harry observed. And so there was--a perfectly iced cake sat in the middle of the table between the five of them.
He wandered around the grounds instead of going to his afternoon class, which probably could be reported to the ministry and violate his probation, but it was Defense, and there was no way he could be there. He wished he’d thought to bring a warmer coat or his mittens, but he made do by stuffing his hands into his robes. He also couldn’t actually stop walking as long as he was outside, since he’d freeze in about a minute. As the evening got colder, he slipped into the castle and found a back corner of the library to hide in until Madame Pince finally shooed him out so she could close up.
Harry’s eyes closed, cutting off the sharpness, but also hiding whatever other expressions Draco could try to read. “I’m glad you’re back.”
“Yes. She’s fine, but class was a total waste. Of course everyone wanted to talk about what happened. You should have been there. Sam could not stop talking about how you jumped right into action and saved the day. They must have talked about you for fully half of the class.”
He imagined Potter spluttering and gripping his wand and grinned. It felt a little like old times.
“Homework,” Draco said. “That Defense against the Dark Arts professor is having us write twelve inches on harmless hexes.”
Draco could imagine it. Could imagine Potter explaining it to Draco’s parole officer, how he really had rehabilitated, how he was even teaching first-years how to defend against the dark arts.
“Don’t you worry about that ‘ermione,” Hagrid grinned, puffing his chest out. “Just want to be sure I’m doing my part to make things right after the war--” He glanced at Pansy and Draco from the corner of his eye. “--for all o’ my students.”
Harry opened his mouth to retort that he'd spent the past half an hour hiking all over the castle searching for Draco, but then he realized, with a jolt like apparition, what Hermione was trying to communicate to him.
Draco opened his mouth, then shut it again, and Fred cuffed him on the shoulder. "Stop it, Draco. We'll have nothing to worry about after tomorrow."
He noticed only a moment before Potter did--a Gryffindor girl in the third row with stringy blonde hair and a thin face--slam her head against her desk.
“Stop moping, Potter. Going out like he did was the only way he could make up for his mistakes. He wanted it that way.” Draco’s voice came out as a growl.
“No.” The force of his answer may have been too much. Hermione peered at him curiously.
He choked out a strange sound in response to the first year and walked the rest of the way to the table where Pansy was sitting with Weasley and Granger.
"Draco Malfoy, is that you? There are people out of their warm houses searching all over London for you."
The ministry official pushed back his hood, revealing that it was Kingsley Shacklebolt. Draco took an involuntary step backward. "Minister," he stammered. "What are you doing here?"
Pansy coughed, and the Gryffindors looked at her.
Draco found a box to adjust on the shelf. Potter was giving him that blinding smile now, and Draco had no defenses for that. "You'd get on just fine without me. I'm only over there an evening or two each week."
Draco looked around in both directions. There were muggles passing by on the bridge, and none of them seemed to realize there was someone drowning in the water right below them. Well, if there was no one here to play hero, he would have to do. He shrugged out of his coat, toed off his boots, and clumsily swung both legs over the rail.
“Researching what?” Pansy, ever the nosy one, grabbed the book from him and scanned the title. “Collected Legal Briefs on the Restriction of Magic? Boring.”
Draco poured himself a glass of water and gathered up the shreds of his composure. “The first year was just thanking me for the lessons I’ve been doing in Potter’s defense class.” He was pleased at how offhand his voice came off, and that he had yet to make eye contact with either of the Gryffindors.
He glowered. “For now. No long-term promises on that front. How come you’re using a muggle toothbrush?”
The platform was even emptier than expected, and there were several compartments on the train empty for himself and Pansy. The first years they passed stared. One of them actually whimpered when Draco had bumped his trunk against the young wizards’.
Pansy and he timed their arrival at the Hogwarts Express just as carefully as their journey to Diagon Alley. Late enough to avoid the crowds, but not so late that the train left them. They were court ordered to attend, it wouldn’t do to cut it too fine.
Healer Goodnight tapped her fingers against her earcuff, but she didn't say anything.
Weasley frowned. “Feast’s not over yet, mate. Where are you going?”
Every eighth year in the school was perched on the couches and armchairs in the Common Room when Draco walked inside, and he could feel every pair of eyes on him. Hermione, Ron, and Pansy had already made it back to the room, and they were staring at him as silently as everyone else.  He glanced up, feeling flustered, and then turned away quickly and tried to make it to his bedroom before any of them said anything.
“Certainly stokes one’s ego to know all the first years can do a spell I still can’t manage.” Draco hadn’t meant to say the words aloud. Or perhaps he had, because he was watching for a reaction from Potter. It was satisfying to see Potter fumbling for words. Draco turned and made for the door, but before he could get away, Potter found his voice.
Draco found himself poking his head into the Professor’s office adjacent to the classroom. It looked like someone had cleaned out some of the Carrow’s things, but it didn’t seem to be in current use. Still--there was a teapot, and two cups, and tea leaves. The teapot itself was enchanted, fortunately, so Draco didn’t have to use any of his own magic.
"Teddy," Draco breathed. "Teddy's okay."
Then someone started applauding, and then it was like thunder. Ron hollered, and Seamus whistled. And before Draco was quite sure what was happening, the whole room was filled with people clapping and whooping.
Draco frowned at the newspaper. It wasn't turned to the front page. Even at his worst, Draco wasn't front page news. In fact, he was hardly what had made the paper. But this was still bad. He snatched up the paper and staggered a few steps back from the display.
"But Harry--why would you--there's so much--how can you just--" Hermione's eyebrows weren't the only part of her face pulled together in confusion and frustration. "Harry, you can't just quit."
"I do understand," Draco said. "I know I help you keep this place going. And it means the world to me."
“Not a subject that’s easy to learn from a book.”
He didn’t need to defend himself.
Hermione grinned. "We went and asked the House Elves if we could do something special, and they helped us make this."
Draco studied his plate.
The figure stepped closer, and Draco squinted against the light of his illuminated wand. "Yes. Unless you're polyjuiced to look like Draco Malfoy. You're coming with me."
Apparently it didn’t matter if she’d heard the instructions, because the moment Snape instructed them to get started, Ron began chopping and adding ingredients with a confidence Hermione had never seen.
“Bloody—what are you still doing here, Neville?” Draco asked, irritated that Neville had made him jump again.
Potter flapped a hand. “It’s not the Defense classes. Besides, that’s me. You’re Draco Malfoy, you’ll probably be a natural at it.”
Draco, apparently tired of babbling in half-sentences, closed his mouth, and Harry had to nudge him. "Draco, are you going to take the position?"
Another curse. “I’ll never hear that end of that one,” Potter muttered, and Draco considered his responsibility for teasing Potter about this incident. At this hour, it seemed like a lot of work.
She dogged his steps. "Well, you're not going to hurt yourself now, are you?"
His hands twitched. He pinched one of his fingers to keep from reaching for his wand. "You don't understand. I didn't deserve a choice. Colin Creevey. Cedric Diggory. Remus. They deserved a choice. All of them were just taken, and I'm still here."
Draco knew he had been dismissed. Just like Sam, he wanted to argue that he should get to stay at Lacey’s side and make sure she was really alright. But he’d known from the beginning that he wasn’t the right person for the job.
“Of course it is, Hermione. Everything you do always works out so perfectly. Even when you’re casting dangerous and illegal spells that should have messed everything up, everyone turns out better for it because it’s you. Everyone except for me.”
They made quick work of the rest of the questions, and when all of the groups were done, Slughorn let them leave early to lunch. Potter peeled away from the class before Draco could stop him, off toward the eighth year rooms. Draco found himself walking between Pansy and Hermione, with Ron and Seamus just ahead of them. He was just starting to relax. There was still truth potion in all of their veins, but Potter was safely away now, and he hadn’t asked Draco anything that would make him spill secrets he’d rather keep.
"I told you to get away from here," she hollered. "The Aurors are on their way."
And with that, he spun and exited the room as abruptly as he’d entered.
Well. Draco didn’t intend to be dramatic about this, but--he stuck a finger in his ear and pretended to check for blockage. “I must be hallucinating. I thought you said you wanted to teach eleven-year-olds Occlumency.”
"Do you have the money, or don't you?" the goblin snapped. "Because either the Weasley boys are lying to us, and we'll be selling that shop before the year's out, or you've just stolen nearly a thousand galleons from your employers, in which case, maybe I should call the Aurors on you."
"Finite Incantatum."
“Given that Draco thinks you were thrilled to have something to make fun of him for, I would say no.”
He didn’t even look to see who had spoken, just kept rearranging his parchments. “It seems that way.”
Draco took his time to navigate the crowds to join the two. Jameson had adopted a position of contrition and Harry was tugging at his curls. "I specifically asked you not to climb anything in the store! And you said I could trust you. Jameson, I don't even know if I can bring you to sing for the Christmas Eve event tomorrow. I've got to know that all of you are going to be on your best behavior even when I'm busy."
