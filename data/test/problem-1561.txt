On the other hand, neither of them appeared to doubt Harry’s story in the slightest, so perhaps it wasn’t that terrible.
“Afternoon Potter. I’ll just need to set the protective charms now you’re here.”
It was also late October, and a brisk chill was already cutting sharply through the morning air; it would only grow colder as the day progressed.
At the time, Harry’d thought Draco a selfish prick, which he was to some extent, even now—but he’d done what he’d had to do in order to survive, a sentiment Harry understood all too well.
They needed to be up very early, yet there was little urgency in the roll of Draco’s hips nor the exploring strokes and lingering touch of Harry’s roaming hands.
However, eventually Harry began to get the sense that Hagrid would not be waking on his own anytime soon, and didn’t have the heart to wake him either. He blamed George—or more specifically, he blamed George’s flask.
“How is your evening progressing?”
“Fuck it. Why not. Only I’ll be choosing the venue this time—and you’ll need to wear something more sophisticated than denim to get in.”
He only startled awake when Draco’s hips bounced under his own.
Laughing quietly alone in his candlelit bedroom, Harry erased his last several lines in one flick.
attract any attention from the Muggles, we’ll need to call in the Obliviators, and those prats’ll never let you hear the end of it.”
This chapter is much longer, but it might be a bit till I can get another chapter out. Hopefully it's as entertaining for you to read as it was for me to write.
“Yeah—c’mon.” He didn’t think much of smacking Draco’s arse rather hard where it was perched in his lap, until Draco moaned and rocked his hips forward into Harry’s abs.
The atrium also had a second level, balconies which ran along two of its curved sides, though they connected across the middle via an old-looking black iron bridge.
Draco sighed impatiently. “We were fucking pretty hard last night. You’ll want to start off slowly.”
He threw the annoyance of his emotions into the rapid-hard hurtling of the Quaffle, and got two in a row past Ron.
Draco rolled over to face the other side of the bed. “Go to sleep, Potter. It’s late, and tomorrow will be very long.”
Yet there it was on the parchment in Draco’s hand, an admission that fucking Harry on his birthday had been excellent.
Harry does some gardening, has a talk with Ron and Hermione, and receives an unexpected visitor at work.
“Thanks for a splendid gift,” he drawled.
“Of course,” Malfoy drawled drolly. “But if you mean to do this properly you’ll need to do better than that knock-off hand-me-down rag the Weasleys had you in. We could do a lot better than that, with the right spells we could actually get quite creative—the real key is the Undetection, and the proper protections. Start with the reading.”
“I don’t suppose you’ve brought anything good to drink with you? Mine’s nearly empty.”
Ginny sighed, and relented to sharing his firewhisky with him again.
A few charms and some dropped pants later and Harry was inside him, and it was fucking wonderful. Draco planted his feet at the bottom of the stairs and held tight to the banister and Harry fucked him quite hard, until he was bent over, palms-flat on the attic’s wooden steps.
But Draco finally did pull back, to pose what Harry already considered to be the definitive question of the evening. “How would you like to fuck me, then?”
Lawrence sounded a bit unnerved to be speaking with him, but Harry was used to that reaction from people anymore, especially lately. He knew for many he would probably always be a reminder to them of darker times.
Even if she didn’t push his buttons ‘properly’, that didn’t mean he cared for her any less. But truthfully, he didn’t crave her, not in nearly the same way his everything now ached to see Draco again.
“I suppose I’ll have to be,” Harry teased quietly. “I’d hate to interfere with your work.”
, Potter—that’s dangerous.”
For once it appeared Draco hadn’t noticed him staring, and he started slightly at the sound of Harry’s voice. His lips pursed with his impatience.
“I don’t need to sit down. I’m fine,” Draco argued.
Harry blinked at this revelation, along with the realisation that they could, theoretically, camp out in Draco’s ballroom all week, if they wanted.
“Draco!”
They spent more than an hour that afternoon attempting to recap what they’d been working on, with as much detail as they could manage without giving away that it wasn’t actually a bold new Ministry project to improve conditions in both worlds as they were claiming. However, as they got into the finer points of what they’d been doing all this time, Cassie appeared completely enthralled by the potential of it, encouragingly so, as she was their expert on the matter.
“Can you actually handle that?”
“I love how you moan my name,” Harry murmured roughly at his ear.
Harry let himself out of her office, his mind turning anxiously over how he was going to make it through the rest of the afternoon, as tired as he was—but he had about twenty minutes left, perhaps he could pop into the Leaky Cauldron for a nap after all.
“Witch Weekly is not exactly known for their hard-hitting journalism, Potter”
“Potter…” Harry prepared himself to be rejected, but instead Draco caught him by the front of his shirt and pulled him roughly forward. “So long as you stop talking now, you can feel me anywhere you like.”
“…Was that an admission you
Harry was a bit annoyed when he felt his cheeks heating.
When Harry opened his eyes to check that the spinning had stopped, Malfoy looked even paler than usual, and the blue flames cast wavering shadows on the dark walls between each of the twelve doors.
“Honestly, I’m very excited to see it all, it sounds so…fantastical, in the nicest way of course. I haven’t got anything scheduled for tomorrow, I could certainly plan on popping by.”
“What are we having then?”
That broke all of Harry’s careful control, panting harder as he worked a quickening blur of thrusts and stroking. His lips only just brushed Draco’s ear when he whispered into it a single word.
The closer he got to exposure, the more uneven his breathing became. He knew he was being toyed with; it was arguably what he’d asked for. As his eyes fluttered closed, Malfoy yanked the hem of his pants down past his hips, exposing Harry to the nearly-empty room, and more importantly, to Malfoy.
“Why, what’s the matter?”
That was too many words for Harry, so he kissed him again, and felt Draco’s soft sigh between their lips.
Groaning low, Harry found within himself some reserve of restraint to keep fucking Draco and not just explode under the sensuous sound of him moaning things like that right into Harry’s ear. Draco wasn’t making this easy for him—but he never did.
“Later,” Draco insisted with low promise. “Save your energy, you’ll need all of it for the casting.”
There was also the fact that after all his bluster over not being caught dead lurking in Muggle backstreets, he’d been willing to get on his knees in one of those backstreets, for Harry. The thought was a little more than Harry could process right then, without being entirely overwhelmed by the desire to bugger lunch and take him to whichever bed they could get to the quickest.
That justification was part of what kept him moving forward with his planning—another part being the hollow looks of fear and trauma on the faces of every Muggle caught up in the Dementor’s feeding frenzies. Harry thought that alone was reason enough to do
Draco was waiting for him when he emerged from the bathroom, freshly showered as well, smelling spicily of coconut and already fully dressed, in yet another dangerously attractive Muggle suit.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Right, yeah. Fine. Only tired.”
“Of all places, why here?” he pressed, sounding somewhat ridiculously pained over the matter.
“More?” he pressed, breathing harder himself when he shifted enough to feel the hard rise of Malfoy’s cock against hip.
It was a warm and windy evening, the dusky late-summer sky being mostly clear, save a few clusters of thin clouds that the wind pushed quickly by.
Draco’s hand covered over Harry’s on his wand, helping to guide the swirls and whirls of its tip, and Harry huffed out a tight breath, suddenly very distracted.
“Some of the books will bite back.”
“I—” he tried, and his voice, among other things, was somewhat painfully raw. He tried again. “You’re alright?”
Through a partial obfuscation of blond, Draco was watching him with a smouldering sort of wonder, only there in the heartbeat it took for him to register Harry’s attention before he was masking it away under a cocky smirk.
“Happy birthday,” Harry said quietly at his ear, feeling him shiver then, just before Draco shifted to rub his arse back on Harry’s cock through their trousers. It was incredibly distracting. “You’ll need to move that, if you want me inside it anytime soon.”
Given how cheap property was in Ottery St. Catchpole, and additionally, how expensive Malfoy’s robes had always looked, Harry thought there was a good possibility that it was an accurate assessment.
He’d offered to help, but Draco waved him off, so Harry occupied himself trying to roll some of the tension from his shoulders with a thoughtful hum.
Draco seemed to catch on then, and also sent Harry an assessing look. “Were you offering to help me get off?”
“No,” Ron said morosely. “You can still smell it all over the shop. It’s awful.”
“That’s not an apology.”
“Is the world moving yet, Potter?”
“Alright. Whatever.”
Harry surprised them both by laughing, and as his eyes adjusted to the light, he thought he caught the edge of a bemused smirk from Malfoy as well, but it did not last, if it had ever really existed at all. An odd mix of old tensions and awkward silence fell over them, yet Harry was far too drunk to analyse what was happening around him. Only very few thoughts filtered through the fog.
Harry laughed, groaned, and nipped Draco’s throat quite hard before he rolled off to pant heavily beside him.
Draco paused in sipping his coffee and their eyes met for a split second of shared remembrance before Harry went a little flushed and Draco hid in his cup a moment before he replied.
“Morning, Scarhead. Wake up. I’ve already done the windows and I’m going to make a proper breakfast.”
“Fuck the Memorial, Potter.”
“Sorry,” Harry offered, sounding not sorry at all—but he got on with pulling each miniturised tent from the bag and laying them out across the floor by hand.
“Only if you promise you’ll come back to bed with me after.”
“Thank you so much, Mr. Potter! HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY!”
Draco shot him another warning look. “None of that either.”
Harry wondered how, in such a large room, full of so many people, he still managed to find himself shoulder to shoulder with Malfoy at the drinks table.
“Honestly I’m surprised you’re still here. I expected you to leave first thing.”
“Surely they’ve given you a fancy chair, at the very least.”
“Then we’ll talk about something else.”
Draco surged forward, pushing up to crash their lips together again, bucking to meet his last few jolting thrusts as Harry spurted hot inside him.
She waved at the folding chairs as Harry stepped into the room, but he did not sit down just yet.
He gathered up the few things he needed to take home, and as an afterthought, cancelled his last spell on the tent, lest anyone be subjected to the mixing of tartan and paisley again.
His cheeks went warm, but his jaw set stubbornly. “I didn’t. I mean—yes, I thought about it but not that way. You were such a prick I couldn’t imagine you snogging anyone. It was really strange.”
The two young men sat opposite each other for a while. Suddenly the black-haired man cleared his throat and ripped Draco out of his thoughts.
He pulled me into a tight embrace, his body warmth was seeping through his clothes and started to warm my frozen limbs a bit. But that wouldn’t be enough.
Pleasure rose in his groins and he tilted his hips up and down, following Draco’s hand and pressing himself a bit deeper onto his finger. Draco took that as an invitation and started to slowly move his finger in and out, while stroking Harry’s cock.
Harry grinned as Draco’s hands run through his black locks and the blonde bend down and tilted his head to press a loving and wet kiss on Harry’s lips without touching his nose. Draco’s body was warm and lithe in his lap and Harry let his hands slip under Draco’s shirt, slowly stroking up and down his back.
All four healers exhaled the air with relief. Draco released Potter's jaw from his fingers and dropped his head. He felt Anthony patting him on the back. "Awesome, Blondie! Well done!"
Harry using his last name sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. The blonde nodded feverishly. “
And in fact, when Draco opened the door to their treatment room, he looked directly into a pair of very familiar green eyes. That was a good thing, because otherwise Draco almost wouldn't have recognized the former Gryffindor sitting on his treatment couch. His black hair was longer than ever and he had loosely tied it to a high bun. In addition, Draco had never seen Potter with a beard. But now his bronze skin was covered in a dark 2-week beard. The dark blue and golden uniform with the emblem of the aurors fitted very tight to his body. His chest had clearly become broader, his arms more muscular. Damn, he could have directly come out of one of those hipster magazines.
Draco now appeared in the kitchen door and Harry couldn't help but smile despite his almost bursting head. He actually smiled every time he saw his friend. He wore one of his usual cloth trousers, today in black and a plain white shirt. He always left his working robes in his locker in St. Mungo.
"Of course he only comes to visit me," cooed Gladys, the elderly reception witch, cheerfully as she whooshed in that moment and brought Potter's file.
"Fuck, you scared me. I thought you were... I didn't even see you!"
Gently they rubbed over his rim and through his crack. Draco shivered with tension and lust. A slight electric shock went through him as a finger penetrated him. He moaned and slid down the wall a little and lowered himself even deeper onto the finger, which moved in a slow rhythm.
Again the two men looked silently into the flames.
"It's all right, I told you you could come if there was anything up."
Harry now lies between his spread legs, his strong hands stroking up and down his thighs. Draco feels breathless, just from looking at the man he loves hungrily staring at his twitching cock. Without any words, Harry guides his legs up and places his feet on is shoulders. Warm breath ghosts over his skin and Harry spreads his cheeks.
Draco didn't know what to think. "But it must be a huge coincidence that it just fitted into the situation! So if you hadn't been there, Potter would never have drunk anything any owl have brought him, would he?
"Harry, look at me. Can you hear me?," he firmly asked.
"No, Draco... please... stay here! Draco, please don't go..." he muttered incessantly and tried to cling to his robe.
“But something else?!” Stubbornly Draco managed to get his hands free and crossed his arms in front of his naked chest. “So, would you tell me about it?”
“Yes, please!”
“I – I can’t – breathe! Stop!”, Draco gasps and finally Harry has mercy and stills his hands.
The black-haired man lifted his hips and Draco swiftly jerked his trousers and pants down at one go. Harry’s dick twitched as he saw Draco licking his lips just as though he wanted to devour all of Harry as quick as possible - which would certainly explain the speed with which Draco practically throwed himself on Harry’s cock and takes him into his mouth all the way till his nose pressed in Harry’s black curls. Harry’s eyes fluttered shut and he moaned, groaning as he heard the delicate choking sounds his boyfriends made.
"Do you know where you are?" Draco asked further.
Draco lifted his chin. "Yes, just like you. And we're still there, aren't we?"
Slowly, agonizingly slowly Harry moves his fingers in and out, pressing hard against Draco’s most sensitive spot every time.
Seamus pouted playfully. “I’m more into dark, tall guys with short hair and piercings, you know?” Dean flashed him a loving smile. “Maybe I’ll meet someone like that tonight”, Seamus grinned and ducked as Dean threw one of his own drumsticks at him.
Angrily he grabbed his coffee cup from the dining table and threw it against the wall, where it burst into a thousand pieces.
Draco hurried out of the room with his paperwork and withdrew to the nurse's room to be on the safe side. Luckily it was soon the end of work.
Harry laughed what made Draco's stomach twitch and stuck out his tongue.
The taller man raised an eyebrow skeptically.
“Harry!”
after 6 wonderful years of being together, moving in together, building a life together, Harry had proposed to Draco. And tomorrow would be the wedding.
“Uhm, okay?” Ron said with a slightly clueless face.
And then Harry’s hips came to an abrupt halt, his cock buried deep inside me and he moaned loudly and pumped a full load of hot sperm in my hole.
“Shit, yeah, of course! Come to the front door.”
– his Harry back.
"Harry, tell me...," the young healer murmured between two intense kisses.
“Oh, don’t worry. You must be the missing member of The Deathly Hallows? I guess your mates are already eagerly waiting for you. I’m Draco by the way.”
Suddenly Harry had got up again and gasped excitedly. Still burying his fingers in Draco's ass, he pushed him by the back to the dining table, which he had freed from plates and glasses with a flick of his wand. A strong hand in Draco's neck pressed him down against the tabletop and Draco howled disappointed as the fingers were pulled out. But what he now felt against his widened hole was better - much better. Slowly a huge, rock-hard cock pushed into him. Draco had the feeling to tear, but at the same time he was more wanton than ever.
, damn it.
And suddenly the two former schoolmates were alone.
The first thing he saw was Potter in a half-torn uniform, who had swung his arm around a lanky, dark-skinned man and staggered back and forth.
Lifting his head again to look in incredible green eyes, Draco smirked. “As keen as I am to find out” – Harry lifted one eyebrow and licks his lips involuntarily – “I have some work to do, I’m afraid. The rest of tonight’s shift will be here in 20 minutes and if I sit outside with a beer in hand…”
“Oh, here and there.”
Harry tried to mask his grin behind an extended yawn. “That’s my good boy. Now I’m going to eat that delicious stew you made for me and we’ll go to bed, okay?”
"Malfoy," he exclaimed in shock, coughing again pretty badly and grabbing his chest.
He tried to ignore the staring gaze of the redhead, stepped to the white bed and looked into the unusually pale face of his former opponent.
“Uhm, no, I think, we’re good.” Harry frowned and scratched the back of his neck, flexing his arm muscles and moving the tattoos.
Despite being warned, the cleaning and lubing charm took him by surprise. He half gasped, half moaned at the new sensation. He felt fresh and warm and wet between his legs. Strange, but not totally unpleasant. And he felt something new. The weird urge to be… touched. Now that he knew that he was prepared, he wanted to
“Should I take you home now?”
"Thank you very much, Mr Ferguson. It would be a great pleasure to be able to work in your department."
I was still panting and whimpering. “Oh fuck, fuck, daddy.”
Harry still stood in the doorway, staring behind the blond, slender man in these tight jeans who looked so freakishly handsome. Who was that?
, please! Please fuck me!”
My knees shook by the time he had added a third finger, pressing hard against my prostate.
Shivering, the black haired man let the air out of his lungs and let his head sink back into Draco's hands. The blonde was shocked to see tears spilling from the closed eyes of the other.
Harry glanced back to our friends. They were about 50 metres down the road, buying roast chestnuts, obviously not caring about us.
The idiot was still so daft.
Finally! FINALLY!
Draco whimpered full of lust at these filthy words. “God,
Ron sits on the edge of his bed, looking dumbfounded on his phone. Bloody fuck. How can he tell his best friend, that they lost his fiancé he was about to marry in a couple of hours?!
“Aww, baby. Don’t worry about my pretty ass. I’m gonna be fine!”
Exasperated Harry pinched the bridge of his nose under his glasses and closed his eyes.
A soft whisper came out of the young man's mouth. Draco bent down closer, so close that the other's breath tickled his ear.
Draco laid his hand on Harry’s muscly arm, gently stroking up and down.
"And to what?" the Auror asked and a cheeky sparkle twitched in his eyes.
Soon as Harry woke up, he knew something was wrong. He certainly wasn't a passionate early riser, but at least he got out of bed a few minutes after the alarm clock and slipped under a hot shower. That morning, however, he hardly got his eyes open. A dull feeling slowly spread to the back of his head and he flinched briefly as he tried to swallow the little spit that had accumulated in his mouth overnight with his dry, rough throat.
A little light fell from the hallway into the bedroom and Draco recognized the broad-shouldered figure in front of him.
“You think, you need a little punishment for playing dirty games with your daddy?”
“I’m gonna – oh
"Fuck," he exhaled.
“Ha-Harryhh”, he moans. “I – I can’t…. I’m gon-na,
the deep parts of the internet.
The next time Draco saw the Auror, he didn't smile. On the contrary - he screamed in pain. It had been almost four weeks since he first showed up at Draco's emergency room. Meanwhile Draco had settled in completely on his new station. He and Anthony worked hand in hand and his colleagues appreciated him for his quick comprehension and overview in delicate situations. This was also the case that day. It was a Thursday evening shortly before 7 p.m.. Draco and his colleague Anthony had a shift during the day and were preparing their treatment room No. 4 for the transfer to the two colleagues of the evening shift. All four healers were chatting happily while rummaging through their rooms and the two young men told the two older healers about their day shift. The atmosphere was good. Draco liked most of his colleagues and was happy to work with such professional people and to learn so much from them.
Draco’s heart nearly beat out of his chest. In a last attempt to pull himself together, he reminded himself of his usual flirty posturing and smiled wide, knowing that his grey eyes will flash.
“Pleasure, I’m Draco”, Draco mumbled. He was now awkwardly aware of his hot, gleaming face and the black shirt, clinging to his slender back.
The latter shook his head in disbelief. "Merlin, Gryffindor, you're crackers! You belong in bed this instant!"
Hot blood shot through Draco's veins and he tried to keep his expressionless mask.
While pulling off the sheets from the bed and putting a new one on, the young Auror noticed how his arms and shoulders began to hurt again. The effect of the warm shower had already diminished. Although it was a mild 17°C outside and Harry was never cold, he wrapped Draco's thick scarf around his neck before leaving the house for the supermarket. Normally he would have been able to enjoy his boyfriend's divine, masculine scent by now, but his damn nose was far too congested. In the supermarket it was uncomfortably bright and the young man hurried through the frozen food section with his eyes pinched, before beginning to tremble with cold. But it
From the fact that he didn’t punish me for being cocky, I knew that he was just as impatient and horny as I was.
Anthony ignored the teasing between the two. "Anyway, take off your uniform so I can examine you better."
The auror slipped back until his back hit the couch. Extending and parting his long legs on the floor, he leaned back and watched Draco with dark, lust-blown eyes. Pulling his shirt over his head and sinking to his knees in one motion, Draco came nearer to Harry’s clothed crotch. With deft fingers the blonde opened Harry’s flies with one hand, slightly stroking the firm thighs with the other.
Master healer Ferguson stepped into the room and smilingly approached the young man. "Congratulations, my boy. An excellent job you did yesterday with Mr. Potter!"
Carefully he tried to squirm out of Harry's grip and slipped smoothly under his arm and leg and hurried into the bathroom. While he was quickly freshening up (there was no time for a shower), he quietly dictated to a quill and a leaf of parchment a message for the sleeping man in his bed.
“Fuck, yesssss”, Draco hisses, as the finger
Draco rolled his eyes. "You can see that, Potter. And I see that you still have a penchant to hurt yourself."
"Hmm", Draco pondered and wrote the details neatly into his report. "Do you know where he got the bottle from?"
Pansy nearly dropped her glass. “Are you blind?”, she screamed and punched him on the arm. “He’s flirting with you all night! He was practically undressing you with his eyes!”
Draco looked like he had a hard time to contain himself.
A head with tangled black hair peeked out of the pillows and blankets and Draco was suddenly relieved and laughed briefly.
"I - FUCK! I’m coming! Yesss!"
Their cottage was all the way down in Cornwall, standing on the coast of the beautiful countryside, the sea only a few yards away, quite similar to Shell Cottage. It was theirs and theirs alone, a place for peace and nature and intimate togetherness without the stress and the noise of the city and of too much work. They actually had a small apartment in Hackney, London where they both lived most of their weeks, because it was just convenient when they both worked in the city. But the cottage… This was their real home.
“Let’s go upstairs”, Harry murmured against Draco’s plump lips and the smaller boy flicked the door open with a swish of his wand.
"Well, Potter, I don't know what you did, but one rib is still broken," the young healer remarked.
“Oh, honey, you can’t fool me!”, Pansy laughed. “I saw how you’re eyes gleamed as I mentioned the guys outside.”
“Fuck, that was hot”, he whispered in my ear.
Harry shrugged a little under the harsh voice.
Draco felt his cheeks blushing.
“Damn, you got me hard all afternoon, baby”, he cooed, pressing the clear evidence of this statement into my thigh.
"Um, yes." Ashamed Draco rubbed his neck. "That's your name, isn't it? And besides, it's not the first time."
"Can you forgive me?" Harry's voice was nothing more than a weak whisper.
When Harry wandered down Diagon Alley, he felt a smile appear on his face. The sun was still shining after this first real day of spring and he had been able to persuade his boss to take some time off in lieu of overtime. It had been a quiet shift after all. So, he had decided to surprise Draco in the ice cream parlour, maybe snatch a scoop of Buckbeak’s Blueberry Bomb, his favourite flavour, and take Draco out for dinner to that new Italian place on Leicester Square they spotted a few weeks ago.
Draco whined a bit when Harry pulled back eventually. He propped himself up against the headboard, long legs crossed. “You wanna tell me now?”
"Oh, Merlin, that's in 4 hours! I am so sorry. I really didn't want to be a burden to you! I can... I can also go back to the living room again. Or back home..."
A sudden noise ripped them both out of their bliss.
“Gods, can’t you just fuck me now?”, I whined. The pressure against my prostate grew and made me slightly desperate.
This feeling of happiness, rushing through Draco's veins as he pressed his lips firmly against Harry's, was so overwhelmingly beautiful that he never wanted to miss it again. He loved him? Never before had anyone said "I love you" to him... Stealthily the blonde healer wiped a tear out of his eyes and smiled at his counterpart.
We dressed in the warmest things we found. At least me. I ended up wearing warm socks and boots, woollen pants, one of Harry’s older Weasley-Sweaters, which didn’t fit him anymore, since he gained tons of muscles over the summer, when he found working out the only way to stop his mind. I would never ever in my life tell him that… but I loved it. I loved how I wore something so precious to him, something he had worn for a long time, something that smelled like him. At last I wrapped my cashmere scarf around my neck and hung my coat over my arm, ready to leave. I looked up at Harry.
The smaller man turned in his arms and pressed his back against Draco's upper body. Carefully the blonde buried his nose in the black hair and took a deep breath of this enchanting scent to calm down.
“Of course, they liked it, sweetheart. It’s
"If there's an opening up here, you' re the first person I'll think of."
"Do you want to talk?," Draco asked quietly.
“Yes, Harry, daddy, pleeeassse!”
He reached out a trembling finger and cautiously stroked over one of the lines running over Draco's costal arch. Goose bumps shot through the blond man.
With one swift movement Harry was back on his feet, pressing his chest against Draco’s and ravishing his lips in a wild kiss. Draco’s aching cock rubbed against Harrys jeans and he rutted against it, searching for friction.
"I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself," Harry said apologetically.
The brunette witch laughed briefly. "But Harry and Ginny have been separated for over 3 years! Ginny is now with Luna Lovegood and Harry... it's none of your business, but Harry isn't only interested in women anymore..."
, I’m gonna –
Draco wrapped his lips around Harry’s hard cock and Harry involuntarily lifted his hips. He always had been a sucker for… well… for Draco’s sucking skills. But lithe hands kept him down, pressing his hip and caressing his thighs. They stroked along the side of his ass, under his upper thighs, gently lifting Harry’s legs up, so that he bent his knees and planted his feet left and right from Draco’s shoulders.
The blonde flicked his wand and the music broke off.
Draco carefully leaned against the wall and distorted his face as he felt his sore ass aching.
His nose tip touched Harry’s.
You know, with love and everything."  Harry's voice was soft as he pulled Draco's slender body into an intimate embrace.
“Love you, too, babe.” Harry presses a kiss to his forehead and pulls the blanket up to cover them. “You need to sleep now, love. Big day tomorrow.”
! And what about "Please, Draco stay with me. Don't leave me alone"??? He had clung to his shirt in search of help, had trusted only him, had sought shelter and peace and quiet in Draco’s presence and now he didn't even look at him and sent him away?
“I’m going to fuck you now, baby. Here in this alley, where everyone could see, what a beautiful little slut you are.”
“Gosh, you’re so tight, baby…”, he growled deep in his throat.
Completely wrecked and sweaty, the two men collapsed on the tabletop. Draco heard the rapid breathing of the young auror and felt his heart racing against his ribs.
Harry tried to call back that he was in the kitchen, but except for a hoarse caw nothing came out. He cleared his throat, but his aching throat brought out only a weak "kitchen...".
“So, that was nice”, Draco stated with a fond smile, flopping down next to Harry.
Potter's ears turned red and Draco looked at him startled.
“Draco kills us, if we don’t keep up the schedule.”
idea! A stupid, stupid, stupid idea! How did you come up with the idea of inviting Harry Potter of all people to dinner?
And then the magic started. Without saying another word, Harry hit the strings of his guitar and music vibrated through the pub, making Draco’s hair on his arms lift. It was loud and blasting, full of heavy but melodic guitars, harsh drums and rhythmic bass lines.
"Potter, what is it?," Draco asked in surprise.
“The bastard bailed on us!”, Pansy shouts, throwing her hands in the air.
Heavy as a sack of flour I slumped, face down, on our bed (two weeks ago we had decided that it would be more convenient to merge our two single beds into a large one). I yelped as I felt my clothes disappear. And I yelped again ad Harry practically
Ron’s shouting voice shook Harry out of his daze. He twitched and took off his sunglasses. His head gladly stopped hurting after two pills of strong painkillers, a cold shower and a bottle of water. But anyway, he felt guilty.
“Fuck, that feels amazing, Harry”, he moans and Harry hums against his ass, eliciting another deep groan from Draco.
Without bothering to stop drawing beer, Pansy nudged Draco with her pointy elbow and shot him an indifferent glare. “I certainly have a look for handsome people, honey. It’s just like admiring a piece of art.” Draco snorted. “And you know, I’m only thinking about you here”, she added with a wicked grin and a wink.
In the strip of faint light still falling in from the hallway, Draco could see Harry making a distressed grimace.
With one eye looking for his strongest painkillers and one eye on his phone checking Ron’s increasingly annoyed messages, Harry headed to the bathroom.
"Shit, you look hot," the black haired man muttered between the countless kisses he now scattered on Draco's upper body. Red swollen lips left a wet trail across the smooth chest and the slim belly and Draco's breath went faster and faster the deeper the other got.
"Okay, let's see what he says when he wakes up."
He couldn’t clearly remember how he got home last night. At least it was his own bed, that he was sleeping in.  And apparently, he had managed to get rid of his shoes and jeans. That was a progress. He fumbled blindly to his right and left and felt the mattress empty. Not so much of a progress. But he wasn’t in the state of taking care of guests anyway, was he?
But the black-haired man didn't react. He still whimpered quietly.
"Do you want to check on him?"
"Oh, maybe two and a half, three hours?"
"Watch it,
, honey!”, Pansy squealed delighted. “You can cut the tension in the air with a knife!” She grinned, waving her hands to cool her face.
“I love you, Harry”, he mumbles sleepily.
“Oh, you bastard!”, Draco screamed, punching hard against Harry’s upper arm. “You
aware of was the pounding headache in his temples. With a groan he tried to open his eyes. He managed to open his right one half. Not bad for the first attempt after a night like this. White stars appeared before his eye and he was quick to close it again. How could that have happened? He only had… 5? Oh, wait!
“Yes!”
I noticed how his cheeks flushed as he mentioned Blaise’s name. Hmm, interesting.
open the door?"
This blonde angel strolled towards Harry and his boys.
And without further ado he started to thrust harshly in Draco’s slick and quivering hole, knowing the
Just a minute later they were out on the street, into a dark and lonely alley and a moment later, Harry felt the brisk country air on his hot cheeks.
The blonde healer stared at the man in bed for a while, his mouth open, then he closed his jaw, grinding his teeth and lifted his chin.
Harry chuckled and playfully smacked my ass. “No”, he said simply. “But I’ll make sure, that you’ll enjoy every second of this.”
Coughing, he dragged himself up to the second floor of the small multiple dwelling on the outskirts of London and stowed away the groceries, only to march back down to the cellar and hang up the meanwhile clean laundry to dry. Fortunately, none of his neighbors were in the small laundry room, so he could hang the clothes on a leash with the help of his wand. It wasn't as neat as usual, but whatever.
Draco nodded.
“Merlin, yes! I wanna come so bad, daddy!” I now moaned so loudly that my throat started to hurt.
Harry thoughtfully turned the glass in his hands.
"You're right, I understand. That is, you are good?"
“We have to get up”, the other girl states between their kisses, that have gradually grown deeper.
Oh, that felt good. He deepened the intense feeling a little as he massaged his swollen balls with his free hand and his right hand was still running up and down his dripping cock. Once again Draco noticed how much he loved this feeling. He was certainly not prudish. Repeatedly, especially during his apprenticeship, he had spent almost every weekend in muggle clubs in London, picking up guys. He had enjoyed performing differently every evening. Sometimes he played shyly and naively, sometimes dominant and demanding. And every time he got what he wanted at that moment. And that was mostly hard, dirty and just hot. For Draco it didn't really make any difference whether he fucked or was fucked. The most important thing was that he felt this bittersweet feeling of the overwhelming lust rising in his lower stomach, and he reached the climax.
“You are a naughty, naughty boy”, he whispered between kisses and bites on my sensitive neck.
Anthony looked at him silently for a moment, then: "Are you really as good as Jenkins claims?
he and no less a figure than Harry Potter aka Saviour of the Wizard World, the Chosen One™ became boyfriends. Well, apparently his mother had always been right when she said: “The way to a wizard’s heart is through his stomach.”
He withdrew slowly, slamming back in with brutal force that made Draco moan loudly.
The finger slowly sank deeper into his arse and stilled.
Draco grimaced at the nickname and then grinned. "Thank you!"
It was terrifying. And absolutely amazing.
Neither Malfoy said anything and Amycus Carrow swaggered away. "Let's get this meeting started, then, shall we?"
"This about the Malfoy kid?" asked Fred.
So when Molly Weasley burst into the burrow one evening, pushing a buggy full of Christmas presents with one hand and carrying a bleeding child in the other, her red hair like fire and her voice like a foghorn, it was, inevitably, written on the calendar.
Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny all stood there, waiting for him to do something.
As always, suggestions and criticism are welcome and appreciated! <3
A warm air rushed out of the ministry doors, swathing every body in welcome as they tumbled through. The space was huge, comparable in size to Hogwarts' great hall; only the aged brick was replaced with sleek, intimidating black stone and the mighty columns were substituted for rows of floo networks on either side. Each black fireplace was spitting green flames as tall as the average wizard. To finish off the scene, hundreds of wizards strode this way and that way, their tailored coats trailing behind them.
"Remember," Narcissa told Draco, "since the ministry floos are all public, you have to be of age to use them. So make sure you stick with one of us."
Draco just nodded, seeming not to notice that he was holding Charlie's hand. His eyes were glassy and his face was red. He was clean now, but Ginny could see where the mud had irritated his skin.
•×•×•
Percy just shrugged; he couldn't care less.
"Here, a peace offering." His smile was wide, making the freckles on his cheeks stand out. He held out the candy, tantalizingly.
She shimmied up to the door and braced herself with both hands in the door frame. Then she peered through the keyhole.
"Draco?" She called. "Draco, come out." Maybe he was hiding. After all, children are mischievous.
Ron watched as his mum took a spoon covered in chocolate frosting and presented it to Malfoy, who beamed her with a smile so large Ron was sure it was fake. Ron made a strangled sound as Malfoy stuck it in his mouth. By the face Malfoy made, you'd think he was eating pure gold.
"I don't have time to come up with something better, Gin. Now shut up."
"It's called Wi-Fi. We wanted to try it out," said George.
Therefore, while we all know that taking food from the twins is almost always a bad idea, Draco did not.
Molly looked up from the paper, "Is something the matter, dear? Is it the soup?"
"Of course! We all appreciate your efforts." Narcissa said quickly before Lucius could say something he would regret.
Draco blinked a few times, suddenly dizzy. He was standing completely still but the world seemed to be lurching from side to side.
"Draco, this isn't funny. Come out this instant."
Ever since then, all of the Weasley children, apart from Charlie and Ginny, had been terrified to be around Molly when she was cooking. Charlie was just recklessly brave and Ginny didn't get what all the fuss was about. No one was willing to explain it to her.
It started with the spoon, then all sorts of things started turning into beetles at Draco's touch only to turn back as soon as he blinked or turned his back. It was starting to get to the point where Draco was questioning his sanity.
George--but maybe it was Fred--nodded along and fished something out of his pocket. It was a piece of candy, wrapped in red foil.
That wasn't right. Uh-oh.
"What the hell's he doing?" Ron asked.
Carrow eyed them, then smiled grossly. "No, that cannot do. What would a rally like this be without one of the most prominent dark families present? We absolutely
After a minute of lying comatose on the bed, Draco realized that no one was attacking the Burrow nor was it falling over. Those were just the sounds of Molly Weasley's warlike Christmas preparations.
This made Molly frown, "Are your parents worried?"
Winter was arriving at Malfoy Manor, it was coming down in fluffy white sheets of snow.
He found himself in the middle of a battlefield.
Sometimes it was Molly with her incessant mothering, but more often than not it was one of the children.
Her baby was gone. Her baby was GONE! HER BABY WAS GONE!
Draco clamped a hand over his mouth and bolted for the door. As soon as he cleared the entrance, he bent over and puked his guts out. Even then the pain in his stomach did not subside. When there was nothing left to throw up, Draco dry heaved until he started getting light-headed.
However, I would remind you that Draco is had only been at Hogwarts for a year at the time. He had not yet been given much reason to pay attention to the Weasleys except to dish out the routine jeer. Not to mention, Fred and George's products were still in their infant phase then, much less well-known.
funny."
"Mum! I'm hungry!" He shouted as he approached the kitchen.
As soon as he felt the ground beneath his feet, he ran, his assailants hardly had time to pull out their wands. Briefly, Draco glanced back and saw the not-Bellatrix and a few others watching him leave.
in charge of this meeting. And I've sacrificed oh so much to be here, don't you think?" Carrow was trying to bait Lucius now, even going as far as to lean into his personal space.
In Ron's defense, he didn't throw the first punch; he just returned it. Soon, Ron and Ginny were engaged in a full-on, fists flying, rolling on the floor, fight. Hair was pulled, ankles were bitten, and both children screamed naughty words, that they should have been too young to know, at each other.
The feeling soon passed and Ginny felt guilty, remembering that it was their fault that Draco had looked so sad that Charlie, kind-hearted Charlie, carried him away.
The swirling stopped and they arrived on the other side: the woman–decidedly not Bellatrix–came out standing, Draco, on the other hand, tumbled to the floor. Almost immediately, several pairs of hands descended upon the small boy, yanking him up by his jacket in such a way that the hood fell over his face. Unable to see, Draco thrashed around with reckless abandon. His pale fists collided with someone's face and that person, out of pure instinct, shoved him roughly which broke him free of the other people's grasps.
The one blessing of his sleeping situation was his pillow, dust-free and clean. Ginny had lent it to him.
Molly Weasley let out a great thunderous cry as she slid across the station floor, flat on her front like a seal. All of her bags and boxes were strewn about and there was an uncomfortable weight sprawled over her back.
"Come now, Draco. Don't linger in the soot."
Ginny didn't like it.
Draco cursed the whole Weasly house. That included the actual building and everyone in it.
"Now then, we are not a snake, dear. Stop hissing"
Molly smiled at him, "Oh I know, you're in some of Ron's classes! Do you know him?"
Narcissa then released Draco's other shoulder in favor of snatching Bellatrix's watch away to gasp at it.
Everything from the manor's Gothic spirals to the twisted black gate out front was coated in a thick layer of sparkling white snow. Every pristine surface was perfect, unbroken, as all things should be with the Malfoys.

Nevermind that, there was always Ginny, who was always up for mischief and was surprisingly clever for her age. Certainly, she would help him. His devilishly quick sister would never miss an opportunity to get a leg up on a Malfoy before even attending Hogwarts. It would be a major reputation boost.
Molly just smiled at him, "That's alright. Go pick it up and I'll get you a new one."
Suddenly Narcissa was running. Everyone else was already in the main hall, so heads turned when Narcissa burst through the doors. She ignored them.
. You can't say no, Lucius!"
Ron had once seen Bill try out one of their mum's spells to make a star-shaped cookie for his fifth-year girlfriend. He successfully made a cookie, although not shaped like a star. But then he looked down his pants and let out a horrified scream. Their parents had rushed Bill to St. Mungos because Bill had accidentally turned something else into a star.
"Oh dear," she said, tucking her wand away, "whatever happened to you?"
In the end, the twins and Percy had to pull them apart, both still spitting like animals. And Molly dragged them both downstairs and plopped them down on the front step, where they were to sit until their father came home so they could explain to him what they had done.
Don't worry, everyone is gonna start getting along soon.
. He'd arrived in the morning and already the sun was going down soon. It was almost like the Weasleys knew his plans and were set on thwarting him at every turn. Every time he saw an opening, a redhead of hair would pop up and get in his way.
he mixing?"
Molly had tried religiously to beat the dust out of the old bedding but it had been in the attic so long it was practically made of nothing BUT dust.
"I'm not planning anything," he tried.
He was tired enough to go back to sleep, but the racket had him fastened in the waking world.
“If you’re so sure you’ve got them down, this shouldn’t take us any longer than an hour. I’ll do them first—I’ve made up a list so we don’t leave out any of the components. Look it over, tick them off as we go along.”
A week later, Harry finally owled him, though he maintained to himself it was solely to address the next phases of the project.
They were moaning in tandem when Harry brushed swollen-sore lips between Draco’s shoulders, and bit down hard as he pushed his cock in far beyond where his tongue could go. Draco drew out another low moan, and it was intoxicatingly erotic.
But now, time without Draco around to distract him was too much time to think.
But he could be patient if he needed to be, he was sure of it.
Ron nodded. “You know her. She’s not going to stop reading until she finds what she needs to prove the point she wants to make. I’ve offered to help of course, but when she tried to explain what she was looking for—”
Draco scowled at him. “Yes. Thank you. What’s next then?”
“That really ought to be locked,” Malfoy drawled. “Anyone could just stroll in here and destroy it all with a poorly aimed spell.”
Draco moaned against his lips as Harry’s tongue slid into his mouth, pushing him down on the bed to crawl over him. Draco was already shoving his trousers down again, and Harry squirmed to help.
“Perfect,” Harry agreed. “I think it’s a great idea.”
His temper faltered, green eyes flashing uncertainly behind the anger. “Why was he naked in your bedroom?”
Harry blinked at him. “No, I suppose not.”
Malfoy did not immediately acknowledge him. Harry watched as he dug into the inner pocket of his robes—and pulled out a palm-sized potions bottle, rounded but rather flat, and sloshing with a blueish-coloured liquid that Harry wasn’t sure he liked the look of...
“That can be a labourious process, yes.”
“Is that a proposition?” Draco smirked at him.
“We’ve barely covered everything we should’ve today. If you’re able to make the time, we might meet in a week or two to go over my progress. Have you spent any time practicing the spell?”
“Draco?”
“I still don’t understand,” said Hermione. “Why would you ever want Malfoy’s help with something like this in the first place?”
“Well,” Harry started. “I’ve done some practicing with the spell, with good results I think, but since we’re all theory today I’ll let you take over from here. Although I should say I’ve been really busy, and everything’s gone a bit scattered in my head.”
“I had thought maybe if you’ve got some space in your desk… I was hoping to test it in one of the drawers, then when I wrote anything I could turn the light on.”
“We’ll need some to shield the entire lot and those will be conditional, that’s what we’re practising now. The others are specific to each individual tent, interior and exterior, and they’re to be more universal. The overarching ones are the most vital to have done first, they’ll weave in with the other protections, and they’re the most complex. We’ll need to cast them subtly, but once they’re in place we’ll have a lot less to worry about in terms of privacy and security. Don’t bother with the bottom set of illusions for now, we’ll deal with them tomorrow.”
Malfoy looked a bit annoyed at the interruption. “Doubtful, as I’ve said, that sort of thing is very tightly controlled. All those tents and the like available for purchase have registration and tracking spells built right into them. There is no way you could pull it off without raising suspicion from either department. Also, they don't come cheap—there’s a reason the Weasel family all squeezed into one.”
Harry shoved him back hard onto the bed and Draco caught at the front of his now-open shirt and dragged him down just as roughly.
When Harry stepped out of the hearth, he didn’t bother to say hello or undress first. He cast a quick spell to clear the soot and crossed the room to settle himself flush to Draco’s backside.
“No,” Harry admitted. “Do you think we’ve covered everything we need to for—?”
Draco’s sputter somewhat resembled a laugh. “It’s hardly my fault you only packed denims and t-shirts, is it?”
“I suppose I was thinking I wanted to open up the world a bit, for people, you know.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
,” he gasped in breathy distraction.
It was edging toward dusk when they found themselves out in the kitchen, starting a pot of tea.
The ballroom’s walls were somewhat curved and naturally it made sense to start off arranging them in a circle. But there wasn’t enough room in a single circle, so what they created was a sort of spiral toward the center of the room. Draco appeared to be using some of the starry mosaic on the floor to help guide his spacing. In the end it was quite close, but they all fit.
Harry wandered over to pull a book off a chair and study the cover.
He cast every revealing charm he could think of, and came back with only a seemingly normal Portkey spell. As a last resort he closed his eyes and held the key loose in his palm, feeling out the magic with his senses rather than a spell.
“Oh, fuck off. As if you care,” Harry scoffed.
“Yes, I’ll be in touch. You have more spells to learn.”
“Back up a step or two.”
“Fuck, Potter—is it that pressing?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
If he were flexible enough, Harry imagined he would already have his mouth on it, but he wasn’t quite. He pressed his palms to Draco’s thighs, spreading them as he eased in deeper. He was not remotely over the feeling of being all in, caught up in the staggering intensity every time.
Tracing Harry’s lips with his fingertip, Draco fixed him with a pointed look, then kissed him again, pressing in to taste the salty trace of come lingering on Harry’s tongue.
“Control yourself, Potter.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Harry?”
“Remind me again why we can’t?”
“Potter, it’s very risky. You don’t know anything about her, or her sister.”
Hi! This chapter took longer than I expected and life interfered for a bit but I'm mostly happy with it.
“Stop staring, and fuck me.”
When Harry’s burning cheek finally landed hotly on Draco’s chest, he felt completely spent, and dangerously euphoric.
“There you are, now you’ve got it.”
. The desire to bite them even more so was strong, but the heavy hard length of Harry's cock would’ve painfully protested the neglect. He whispered a spell to slick himself and rubbed slippery between Draco’s cheeks before pushing in past tight muscle, their relaxant spells of earlier long since dissipated.
Weaving his way out into a darkened corridor, he ventured down it a ways. He passed several couples and a few small clusters of other guests on his way, searching out the sound of silence.
Harry heard an anxious catch in Draco’s breathing as he worked to steady his own through all the screaming, fighting to find his happiest thoughts.
Ginny was still frowning at him.
need socks, there’s never enough—but yes no, I’ll sort out what I can, and bring a starter list with me tomorrow. Will that work?”
“I really don’t know what you’re on about.”
Harry’s assessing green eyes shifted from Malfoy to the offered bottle—but rightly he was not quite reckless enough to drink a completely unknown potion, sight unseen.
He stifled a groan. “That hurt.”
Sneaking back into the Time Room together, they hadn’t made it two steps into the room before Harry noticed a light lit in one of the offices. His heart might’ve stopped briefly, and he felt Malfoy’s grip tighten at his elbow, but he merely tried to remain calm and move along the far wall, as far from the offices as he could get them, until they passed far enough that they could make straight for the room of many doors.
Harry couldn’t help but to be interested. The kitchen looked fairly ancient, all wood and stone and black iron. It was quite large, clean and neatly organised—and not nearly so small, dusty or cluttered as Harry’s kitchen.
He nipped at Harry’s lips again before he was moving off to stretch out beside him with a tired groan, on the bed of Harry’s old school robes they had laid down.
“I’ve got some questions I’d like to ask about the conditions around here, also about the people you help, what you think they might need. It’s been causing a bit of a…magical pest problem in the area and it’s becoming a little much to handle for a number of departments—including my own… If you’ve got the time to spare, of course.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“What?”
“It’s your…push lights. I’ve tested them with the markers, they work. I did both so you’ll have a spare. They’re shrunk down, you’ll just have to unshrink them then.”
He made it only a few days into the first week before Harry could no longer take spending all evening after work faffing around the house. He couldn’t focus on his reading or his spells, even despite now having the privacy and spare time to cast them.
“…That’s fair,” Harry conceded.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Every month it seemed there was a new announcement of engagement, families beginning, weddings being planned. Ron and Hermione had been one of the first to take the leap, and surprisingly it had caused Harry no small amount of conflict. To him it felt as though they were rushing things a bit. He was happy for his best friends of course, if they were happy, but it had all seemed to happen so quickly.
“Merlin’s balls, that’s hard to picture.”
“Well, you know it was sort of right, in the end… house unity.” Harry gestured between them with an amused half-grin.
Harry swayed precariously on his feet.
“I’d like a word, Potter. Is there anywhere we could speak a bit more privately?”
Harry glanced down as if he’d only just noticed, even if he hadn’t actually, and shrugged. Draco immediately pushed him down into absurdly soft sheets, and proceeded to taunt and tease Harry’s cock with his tongue, until Harry could not stop himself erupting all over it.
“Right. Curtains first, then we’ll revisit the protective enchantments, and a few other vital matters. Then I’ll offer my very enthusiastic gratitude.”
“What the fuck.”
“Would you mind very much if I asked to join you?”
Green eyes flashing with stubborn intent behind his glasses, he nodded.
“Thanks,” Harry retorted wryly.
“How long ago?” Draco asked, picking through a variety of bottles, tins, and jars on the cabinet’s shelves before he pulled out a small pot of something that looked somehow wet and solid at the same time.
“Yes, I know it was inappropriate, Potter. That was the point.”
Even saving the world wasn’t enough to protect him from bad press forever. Was the risk worth the consequences?
Eventually, Harry got so absorbed in retaining what he was reading he forgot where he was entirely.
“Afternoon, Harry! Have a seat—and how’s the case going?”
When Draco eventually pulled out, it was only to slip into his lap once more, spanning it to start in kissing him for a very long while.
“Draco. You didn’t. We’re both alive.”
“Happy birthday, Potter.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Letting him down to find his feet again as the ecstasy abated, Harry’s cock slipped out rather lewdly. He felt somewhat pleasure-delirious pulling Draco flushly closer to kiss him, exploring fingers sliding down between the curves of his arse to trail the soft of his middle finger around the wet contracting circle of Draco’s hole, teasing through some of his own escaping come.
Draco sensed how good it was for him. His upset heart calmed down and his anger finally ebbed away as he ended his routine with a ten-minute meditation. As the blonde lifted his slender body from the mat again, he reassured himself in a calm voice that Potter was an idiot and he hopefully wouldn't see him again so soon in the emergency room.
“Draco”, Harry said in a daring tone, but his cheeks really felt a bit hot.
“Guys!”, Harry called, laughing as well. “And who is he now?!”
And I came. I threw my head back and screamed as I pumped a huge load between myself and the mattress without even touching my cock. I saw stars, my vision blurred and my insides were on fire. I came and came and came. Everything spun in my head and I seemed to float on clouds.
"Awesome," Harry puffed out.
He was wearing a pair of worn jeans, a long-sleeved shirt and his leather jacket, that once belonged to his godfather. And his old Gryffindor scarf.
A shiver went through the two men as Harry pulled his semi-rigid cock out of Draco's hole. The black-haired man quickly cleaned both of them and the table with a sway of his wand before their legs gave way and they let themselves sink to the carpet side by side. Still a little breathless, they stared at each other.
So Draco let the young Auror float on the fresh bed. He hesitated, then he took off his shoes. Harry would surely sleep for a while, then he really didn't have to lie unnecessarily uncomfortable. Actually, patients who couldn't do it themselves were made ready for bed by the nurses and healers in the internship. But it was the middle of the night and the wards were not fully staffed anymore. With a wave of the wand he let Harry float a hand's width over the bed. Draco's slender fingers moved towards Harry's upper body almost by themselves. A little shaky, he shoved the cape of his uniform from the black-haired man's broad shoulders. Then he opened the buttons of his shirt and took it off carefully but routinely. A tight white T-shirt now covered the well-trained chest and Draco noticed to his own horror that he licked his lips involuntarily. But there was nothing to it, was there? He had done that thousands of times during his training... Only the patients he had undressed so far had not been his former enemies from school -
It wasn't that Harry was forced to do all this. Draco often said he shouldn't spend so much time and have a cleaner come at least once a week, but Harry was stubborn. He enjoyed taking care of his friend, providing him with a nice home when he came from a long shift in the hospital. And besides, unlike Draco, he was more than used to housework and no longer found it exhausting or humiliating. He even did most of it in Muggle style and with Muggle equipment, although he appreciated some of the tricks Molly had shown him in recent years.
With trained and slender hands, he palpated the purple swollen side of his patient and gave a triumphant "Aha!" as Potter flinched and growled at the touch of his fifth rib.
With a smacking noise Harry let the almost pulsating cock slide out of his mouth. No! Draco was so close... so fucking close!
"How are you, Potter?" he asked quietly.
"We should give him something for a dreamless sleep and then just check on him again when he wakes up," the former Slytherin suggested.
With a disgusted face Harry swallowed the potion and let himself sink back onto the pillows. Again he wrapped his arms around his narrow chest and trembled violently under the thick blanket.
At first the other remained silent, but then he nodded: "Si!" In the meantime he had calmed down a bit and had stopped whimpering.
There was a frustrated exasperation in the narrow of Draco’s eyes. He licked slowly up Harry’s cock, tasting his tip until he squirmed, but then Draco moaned pushing up to crash their lips together again, hurrying to get his trousers off.
With a smirk once again a little too reminiscent of the hateful prick Harry recalled, Malfoy pulled the stopper on the lid.
“Don’t—er, please don’t kill each other.”
“Potter—”
Harry thought he had never looked more attractive—at least, until the next time he watched him come.
The rain had slowed to a pitiful sort of drizzle by the time they’d finished with lunch, and they walked the path back to the tree in the garden at a much more leisurely pace.
After levitating a fair bit of the furniture out of the middle of the room first, Draco charmed the tent to set up right in the middle of the library. When it was fully erected, he wasted no time adjusting his stance and starting to cast the elaborate chain of enchantments, linked together through the whirls of his wand tip and the complex strings of Latin he murmured to make it all fit into one spell.
A stilted cough drifted out from the bit of balcony currently cast in shadow, and gave Harry a (delayed) start. He spun around too quickly in search of its source, managing to make himself dizzy in the process.
His gaze swept over Harry more closely then, and Harry ignored the increasingly familiar nervous twist it gave him—but what Draco left him with was rather unexpected.
“Hmm?” he hummed, distracted shoving Draco’s shirt off his shoulders.
Draco pulled off him, and Harry’s cock immediately missed the hold of him, but Harry was rewarded with the sight of Draco pushing sweat-damp strands of pale hair back from his face as he peered back over his shoulder at Harry expectantly.
“She’s still training in Holyhead?”
Draco fell asleep even before him, and the constancy of his slowed breathing was incredibly relaxing. When Harry finally did doze off, his dreams were peaceful ones.
According to Malfoy, their tryst under the potion was meant to be a one-time exception. Yet Harry thought the rather visceral image of Draco with his arse up moaning for Harry to fuck him harder could potentially make it tricky to continue on working together as normal.
—fuck, will we have to do them all over again?”
Draco shifted minutely closer, so that his shoulder pressed lightly to Harry’s whenever either of them breathed in.
“Not at all,” said Cassie.
“Got it,” Harry affirmed, scanning over the neat list on parchment. “Why are the illusions split up? We can’t do them together?”
The bar was quite busy, as wedding bars tended to be, but he hadn’t been waiting very long when he was approached from behind, a heavy hand landing on his shoulder and setting his nerves immediately on edge.
“How—?”
It would be his last stop for the day, but he popped in to the rowdy pub just down the road for a pint before he headed home. Cassie had given him quite a lot to think about, but it sounded as though what he had uncovered was only just the tip of the iceberg. He was sure he didn’t have all of the answers he needed, but he thought it was enough that he could give Malfoy a starting point—he only needed to make his letter vague enough to provide them plausible deniability.
Harry finally let up—and as soon as Draco had the room not to kick him in the head, he was shifting around to face the back of the chair, gripping the top of it as he arched an eyebrow over his shoulder impatiently.
all the measuring and the timings and the numbers, and then you needed to worry that the instructions might be horribly wrong. He was capable enough, but the work itself took a lot more out of him.
“It’s moving… can we make it stop?”
Everyone was very happy to see him, as if it were a delightful treat that he had popped in at all—only Ginny, Ron, and Hermione were looking at him with varying degrees of relief and concern.
He never quite met Harry’s gaze—and it wasn’t as if Harry wasn’t looking.
“Then wh—?"
Taking in each wavering moan, the eager rock of hips and pale hands bracing on rough stone walls as Harry swallowed him deeper—he didn’t think he needed that much practice.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
The next morning when he stepped through the library fireplace, promptly at nine, Draco was standing just beside the hearth shelving a book above the mantle with the levitating point of his wand.
“Well, it has been lovely chatting with you in this—” He seemed to be struggling to find an insulting enough descriptor.
Harry inhaled a little unsteadily, feeling his cheeks heat, and felt incredibly foolish for it—but Draco was very close. He must have noticed, but he didn’t acknowledge Harry’s flustering, save the hint of a small knowing smirk.
“You’ll need to know how to differentiate between the fabrics and the patterns. You wouldn’t want a sitting room full of nothing but polka dot and floral velvet, would you?”
Harry kissed him hard as he pushed up to sit, and Draco helped not at all squirming against his trapped cock.
For most of the rest of July, Harry went back to work, his studies, his training, and all the rest of it. The intervening time seemed to fly past much too quickly—despite his being perpetually deficient on sleep, or perhaps because of it.
“How’d I do?”
In fact, most of the tables were free, but there was something about this one in particular Harry was quite fond of—being the birthplace of the D.A. that Malfoy had once gone to so much trouble to help destroy. It would serve as the perfect spot to discuss what no one else need overhear, and the irony was only a bonus for Harry.
“You don’t have to be sorry—it’s just a hard day, for everyone.”
“Is that a yes?”
They made it down the hall to the attic stairs—and no further.
Draco hummed throatily back, dropping a sharp bite to Harry’s jaw.
“Well at least we know I have the control necessary to cast on more delicate objects.”
He saw Ginny off in the sitting room, pressing an affectionate kiss to her forehead as she hugged him. Then she pulled back to fuss at Harry’s shirt.
Harry cleared his throat distractedly. “Sorry.”
He didn’t know what to say, but what popped out was: “Hey. You’re alright.”
“You like it?” Harry questioned breathlessly. He squeezed at Draco’s cock, stroking him to the same languid rhythm Harry was using to penetrate him.
“Right, thanks,” he snarked aloud to no one at all. “I had no idea.”
His duplicity reared prominently to the forefront of his mind every time anyone had asked him when Ginny would be home, or how she had been getting along with her training—not that he didn’t have those answers, he had been owling with her all the while. Nevertheless, he felt like a shit fiancé, not to mention a shit friend, and knew he was being one.
“Would the spell structures hold up to those sorts of changes? Will we have enough time?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry broke off with a quiet hitch, hit with a rush of intense prickling warmth. The sensation was not entirely unpleasant, but it began building up a steady tension through his nerves—a searing itch in need of scratching.
Caught again. “Sorry.”
“Yes. And no. Or, this is my cold revenge, after years of torment.”
“Oi,” Harry complained. “Get back here.”
“I’ll need to check what’s left. We’ve already gone through all the sandwiches.”
Harry finally could not help but ask.
Was she flirting with him?
“Well, I lived the better part of a year in one of those tents and was perfectly fine—aside from the twats trying to kill me part, of course.”
“Er. ‘Guess since we’re already here, we might as well stay in this one.”
Harry wasn’t sure how he could blush after what Malfoy just did to his cock, nevertheless.
It was getting toward evening when they found themselves standing in Harry’s sitting room, significantly less furious with each other than they had been at the start.
Draco didn’t say Harry could come for another half-hour, gasping for it as he throbbed in the tight pull of Harry’s strokes, arching into his climax.
Draco’s frown turned thoughtful, and after a moment he nodded his head toward the center of the carpet.
But a hand slipping into his pants left Harry unable to do much but rock himself into the touch, while Draco’s lips parted and their tongues tangled in some sort of battle for domination.
Harry didn’t think that was right. After all—he had his head now, enough to know how quickly he would need to sort out explaining away where he had fucked off to since lunch.
Harry went thoughtful a moment. Malfoy was right. Practically, it didn’t make sense to do a lot of work without first sorting out what was most vital.
Draco arched an eyebrow at him. “You really only asked the once…the first time round my cock was in your mouth.”
“…I suppose I could.” As usual, he was haughty even despite his fatigue. “But you’ll need to wait if you’re expecting me to do anything requiring movement.”
After that he’d given up on the whole idea, though as it happened he needn’t have put himself through the anguish at all.
Harry really tried to give what he thought was a customary warning tug, but it was nearly too late—even before he was swallowed down until he rubbed the back of Malfoy’s throat again—and then it was too late, and Harry was coming with a breathless cry he only barely kept from echoing out in the room’s deceptively calming glow.
Harry grinned at him the entire time they spent looking for a hidden-enough place to Disapparate, while Draco finished Harry’s coffee, and refused to make eye-contact the entire time.
He didn’t actually have answers to the questions his conscience was posing, but he was developing a growing fear of finding them out.
Draco had, however, pinned Harry against the inside of his front door just before leaving, and sucked at his cock until Harry came on his tongue. Then he Disapparated, leaving Harry leant back against the door, his head still lost in a heavy post-orgasm fog.
Frowning, Harry went with his first instinct, gently shaking at his shoulder.
“We’re here to satisfy my curiosity. I don’t need to go touching prophecies to do that.”
It was a little ridiculous how much it turned Harry on to see Draco propping himself back on the desk as he was, spreading his legs enough for Harry to fit between them, and work his fingers up to the most hidden parts of him.
“That’s a joke, Potter. It’s down the end of the corridor. Don’t get lost. If the portraits get chatty, try to avoid mentioning your name.”
Laughing, Harry finally stood up and pulled his shirt back on. “Talk to you later.”
make it up to me by asking me to dance, Harry,” she hinted, with all the subtlety of a bludger to the head.
Draco’s answer was scarily quick.
“What?”
It had only been a light drizzle earlier in the morning, but given they would be exploring in Muggle London, Harry had thought to bring an umbrella.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Surely enough, in two days’ time when Harry finally washed the honey-scented substance from his cheek—which had crystallised in the last day or so over the once-angry line where the curse cut deep—he found there was no trace of a scar left at all. And once again, Harry was genuinely grateful for Draco’s help.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry’d been thanking him rather a lot today, and Malfoy continued to shrug it off as if he weren’t being unusually helpful. He wasn’t sure why he had to be such a stubborn prat about it, but then it was Malfoy, so perhaps he did know.
Darting around to face the battered makeshift goals as Ron lined up to block them, Harry tried a few different feints, ones Ginny usually pulled successfully on him—but Ron managed to foil them all.
