The next day, when Draco saw Harry all sweaty in his old Quidditch clothes coming back from a jogging, the feelings he had pushed down came back so quickly that he just stared at Harry speechless, mouth open. Harry, clearly confused, just frowned his eyebrows, said something about a “shower” before leaving the hallway to go on the first floor. Draco sat down in the dining room for a minute processing what was happening to him.
Draco wanted to kiss Harry, right now. Instead, he just stared at him for a little while longer before Harry finally turned around. His ears were red and he threw a look at Draco, almost defying him to make fun of him.
Now that Draco was alone again, he suddenly was aware of how quiet the house was. He hadn’t felt the loneliness before but now it felt suffocating. He went to his room quickly and finally changed from his grey pyjamas to put his more formal clothes. He brushed his hair for the first time in weeks and then left the house. He didn’t know where he was headed but it felt good.
Draco had tasted pizza for the first time in Hogwarts. So he didn’t know what any of these names on the paper meant. He took some time while Harry was waiting next to the couch. When he finally made his choice, Harry took the piece of paper and left the room in a hurry, almost worried that Draco might change his mind.
Draco smiled at the end of his phrase and looked at his right to see Harry staring at the sunny sky.
Once the beautiful dessert arrived, they all were chatting and laughing again. Draco looked at Harry who was watching everyone with a small contempt smile. Harry was more beautiful then ever and Draco was unable to look away.
“But you actually do. You’ve been here every day, all day long, staring at me, watching over me. Why?”
Harry seemed to come back to reality and he finally entered the room, before putting the two pizzas on one of the couch.
When he sat down with his mother in front of the magically cooked meal, Draco thought about Harry probably still sitting still, alone in the big old and destroyed house. The strange feeling in his stomach almost made him reconsider the arrangement.
Draco waited, not ready to accept this short assessment as an answer. Harry noticed that Draco was actually curious so he continued.
Harry laid back in the chair, crossed his arms and looked in the distance. Draco thought that this was the end of the discussion before Harry finally opened his mouth again.
He had tried to talk about it with his mother but he knew that it was too hard for her. So since the trial, he had buried these feelings deep down. Everything was buried, the good and the bad, he didn’t try to make a difference anymore. It was useless. Feelings were a loss of time and he only needed to be aware of the world not of himself.
He woke up, more tired than ever. His head was pounding, and he regretted not taking that Sleeping Draught. He could feel tears falling down his face but he couldn’t remember the nightmare that he just had.
“Do …” he was too afraid to finish his question. Harry barely looked at him before leaving the kitchen.
Once the gate was opened, Granger indicated Draco to follow her and together they walked in silence to the seventh floor.
The next day, Harry was in a better mood again. He seemed motivated to take on the ground floor, a motivation that only lasted until they saw the actual state of the floor. Harry explained that the better state of the basement might have been linked to the fact that Kreacher, the house-elf, had clean the kitchen the year before.
“I’m not sure I want to tell you. And, I mean, you didn’t tell me how you knew my favourite dessert,” said Harry putting down the mixing bowl.
“You remember how I told you that I was spying on you during the sixth year?” started Harry, seemingly very interested by the eggs in front of him. Draco was leaning against the counters, nodding.
“I don’t want your thanks. I’m just waiting here for someone to Apparate me home.” He said the last part looking at Granger who didn’t seem to care.
It was … not that bad. Draco mostly followed Harry around, not knowing his way in the numerous aisles. Harry had indeed written a long list and he was shopping while making comments about the various products.
“The house is literally full of bedrooms but we slept on couches,” grumbled Draco, trying to ease his back pain.
He had tried to hide the tension he felt coming back at Hogwarts, especially to this floor full of bad memories, but he knew Granger had heard the way his voice had quavered.
Slowly a map began to appear on what was a blank piece of parchment. It was a very detailed map of Hogwarts with the names of the people on the ground.
Harry hesitated for a while, knowing that he had to answer the question to maintain this little game, but still reluctant to share too much.
Draco didn’t know what to do, being usually the one having the nightmares. He tried to think about what his mother or Pansy would usually do. He brought his right hand towards Harry’s head, hesitating. They weren’t friends. But he couldn’t stay here doing nothing when he knew what Harry was going through. So fighting his mind, he finally put his hand on Harry’s head and began to calmly stroke his messy hair. At first, Harry’s was still crying but then slowly he began to relax.
Draco followed him in the hallway and he took the potion back from Harry’s hand, wanting to do it himself. He opened the curtains, and before Walburga could say anything, he splashed the mixture unto the painting. For a second nothing happened and Draco felt disappointed then suddenly the painting started to melt and bubbles appeared. The face of Walburga started to disappear like someone was erasing her. When the bubbles were gone so was Walburga. The painting was no more, and on the wall was just an empty frame.
Draco had guessed that the “we” meant the trio but the rest of the story was still small pieces of the large puzzle that was Harry’s life. He nodded once he realized that Harry was done and now looking at him.
Granger didn’t wait for him and went immediately to the gate where Professor Flitwick was pacing anxiously.
“If you don’t stare at anyone, I promise it’ll be fine. And I’m here,” Harry said putting a hand on Draco’s right shoulder.
“They thought that you were pretending to have changed. Probably that it was part of some plan or something.”
They continued to watch the peaceful street for a while, in silence, before going back to the cleaning.
Later that day, he went to Grimmauld Place. The letter talked about the number 12 but he quickly realized that there was no such number in the street. He walked past the number 11 and 13 a few times, starting to feel both cheated on and angry at the presumed joke.
“Listen, Harry told us how much you’ve helped him. And apparently, you’ve changed too which is … good. So I don’t know about forgiving-” Ron started, Hermione looking at him nodding “but I guess I can give you a second chance.”
Draco was awkwardly sitting on the floor, stroking his hair and he realized that he was also humming his mother’s lullaby. It was an old lullaby that his mother would sing to him at bedtime when he was little. Sometimes she would sing it when he was sick too.
Harry nodded. Draco could see the anger and pain on Harry’s face. He could feel his own anger bubbling and he wanted to ask where does these disgusting people where living now but instead he said: “I’m sorry.”
She was walking with more confidence now, and it felt strange to talk cordially to her in this place. Draco hoped he was right about Potter so he could go back to his bed and forget about this day already.
He sat down at the kitchen table and got his things out, scribbling on his notebook to calm himself. Harry came in a few minutes later, with a grey shirt on. He sat in front of Draco, staring at him.
Draco woke up to Harry looking at him, smiling softly. Draco smiled back, before running a hand through his hair. His hair was starting to be quite long, at least longer than it had ever been.
They were almost over when Harry realized that he had forgotten something. He told Draco to wait for him with the trolley while he would get the missing product. That’s when a nice looking man came next to Draco. At first, it seemed like he was just looking for something next to him but then he looked at Draco and had a small smile. Draco didn’t return his smile but instead arched his eyebrows.
Draco had explained to his mother, the day before, at dinner, what happened. Strangely, she had been very understanding and even happy that Draco was going to leave the house more. She seemed to care for Harry, in some way, and he knew that she felt grateful and in debt about his involvement in their trial. Harry had indeed played a big part in their lighter sentence. He had condemned Lucius’s acts but somehow forgive Draco’s. He had told the truth and explained how Draco had lied to Bellatrix and how Narcissa had lied to Voldemort. After the trial, Draco’s mother immediately went to thank him, but Harry remained distant and quiet. Once she had left him to follow her husband, Draco had decided that it was finally time for an apology. He had apologized for his behaviour, acts and involvement in the war. He had apologized about everything he had done to Harry or Harry’s friends.
“What if … we ate pizza tonight?” proposed Harry, not looking at Draco, who was standing on the other side of the bed.
Draco just stared, speechless, at Harry who was sitting on the couch. Harry had his shirt slightly lifted and his hair were a mess and his eyes looked a bit puffy behind his glasses – Draco stopped his train of thoughts to come back to the important matter.
He hated himself for being so vulnerable in front of Harry but he couldn’t hold it. Something about his words had really shaken him. It reminded him of the coldness of his father, the disdain in everyone faces at Hogwarts, the disappointment from the Dark Lord when he didn’t kill Dumbledore, … The fact that no matter what, he didn’t have a choice. He was who he was, and even when he tried to do something right, people would always see him one way and not another.
After breakfast, they went in the drawing-room, once again, where Harry asked Draco if he could teach him how to play the piano. Draco knew how to play but teaching was not something he was used to, at all. He tried to explain the different keys but it ended with Draco’s hand on Harry’s so that Draco could guide him playing.
Draco was left speechless and he just looked at Harry for a while. Harry met his gaze before eating again.
As suspected, Harry was laying on of the couch in the drawing-room. Draco knocked on the open door so that Harry would know he was here. Surprised, he got up and seemed confused as to why Draco was back again.
Harry seemed to snap out of his thoughts and looked at Draco probably deciding if he was worth answering.
A crack then soft breathing got him out of his thoughts. He looked up and saw Harry. He looked worried and he came to sit next to him.
The sour scent of moisture and mould was unnerving, the amount of debris and destruction was saddening, and the cold and heavy atmosphere was overwhelming.
Draco felt differently toward his father. It wasn’t love. It wasn’t hate either. It was a form of sadness and regret.
Draco agreed silently, feeling like it wasn’t a good day to tackle the drawing-room of the house. They spent the rest of the day reading.
He was never a fan of the Floo Network, especially because you never really knew how you would end up. The 12 Grimmauld Place fireplace was dusty and dirty which ruined in an instant his appearance. Draco stepped out of the fireplace, cursing before he realized that he was in the basement (or kitchen) where he had left Harry the day before. Harry was sleeping in his chair dangerously close to falling. The noise didn’t wake him up and Draco quietly went to put his cooked meal on the counter before sitting next to the sleeper. Draco noticed a large open suitcase in one corner of the basement which probably meant that Harry had planned to live here, somehow.
The next days, at noon Draco would set up a plate for Harry, bringing a different meal every time. The next days, they didn’t exchange any words except for the polite small talk.
“He said that he didn’t need me. And that I was just doing this because I missed feeling important.”
“There is something oddly comforting about this room, no?” asked Harry looking in the same directions as Draco.
“But thank you for the cooking and baking … lessons. It was nice,” added Draco, still not looking at Harry.
It had been already a week since their first kiss when Harry suggested that they invite everyone to celebrate the house renovation. Draco was immediately excited until he remembered that nobody knew about them, and their relationship.
Harry finally looked down and saw how filthy his clothes were. He smiled before turning back to look at the fireplace.
Draco only nodded, wondering what that could mean. Harry still seemed to be the same annoying Saint Potter.
He had waited for the tears to come when he had learned about his father’s imprisonment, but he just felt like the world had stopped. It was like being back when his father had been sent to Azkaban after the events in the Department of Mysteries. Except, this time, the sentence didn’t felt wrong.
Draco could bet he heard Harry murmured “again” at the end of his sentence but he decided to ignore it.
“Say the one who’s been angry at everyone because he doesn’t want to deal with the fact that it’s over.” Draco gulped, trying to contain his anger. “You were supposed to save everyone but too bad you actually sucked at your job.”
“I could,” said Draco in a moment of absence. He was so captured by the discussion and situation that he had forgotten that they weren’t his friends, and Potter was surely not someone he cared about enough to watch over.
Harry was standing and looking strangely at him. Draco rubbed his eyes and then only noticed that he was on the floor.
“After my not so successful task, a lot of followers were still not taking me seriously. I had to prove my allegiance or … “
“Last year, we used the house as a hide-out for a month. But when we Apparate back to the place after leaving the ministry, Yaxley had followed us. We had then no other choice than to leave the place. The house was already in shamble before that but I guess that he and his little
“I believe you,” said Harry before giving Draco a sincere little smile, looking at him with that strange gaze again.
They baked in silence. Harry let Draco assemble the cake, and Draco slowly forgot everything else to focus only on the amount of strawberry jam he was putting on top of the sponge cake. Once they were done, Draco cleaned the mess and Harry suggested to go upstairs, in the drawing-room.
Draco wanted to say something but he didn’t know what. He was feeling so uneasy that all his thoughts seemed to disappear.
He could have just laughed and said that he didn’t actually mean it. Why would he watch over his rival? Or former rival. Either way, it seemed stupid and strange, and so contradictory to everything … And that’s why he shook his hand, holding a smile back.
In a silent agreement, they didn’t speak about the portrait for the rest of the day. They managed to clean the hallway and changed the wallpaper and carpet.
He was very skinny. Skinnier than ever. His glasses were broken on the floor. The small space was empty except for a few objects that were smashed on the floor next to him. He had blood on his hands, his own blood. The wall opposite the door was damaged and covered in dry blood.
During breakfast, Draco offered to clean Sirius’s room by himself but Harry refused and said that he needed to do it. So that’s what they did. It took them some time because Harry would occasionally stop to look at some objects or pieces of junk a bit too long. Draco didn’t say anything and instead tried to be as supportive as he could, even though every sad smile and every teary eye were like a small jab at his heart. When he came home, finally, his mum didn’t ask much details but she seemed to understand everything anyway.
Harry opened his eyes at the sound, and suddenly that strange gaze was back again when he looked at Draco. Without a word, Harry started to eat.
The next day, Harry wasn’t really in the mood to work and Draco knew better than force him. They sat in a comfortable silence for a while and ate the meal that Draco brought that day, ignoring each other. After lunch, Draco offered to go to the first floor, which was now clean, to just have a better environment. Harry didn’t answer but he did join Draco in the drawing-room. Harry laid down on one of the couch, eyes closed, and his hands behind his head. Draco spent the afternoon playing the piano. When he came home he realized that he had only played soft tunes, lullabies, almost like he was trying to soothe Harry.
Draco stared at him, then looked behind himself to see if the man was really talking to him. Realizing that the man was waiting, he answered “No.”.
“I’m sure every witches and wizard knows your favourite dessert. There are literally hundreds of articles about all the stuff you like and dislike.”
Draco looked at Harry and then the parchment a few time. He opened the parchment and … nothing. It was blank.
She nodded then closed her eyes for a moment. He had never seen her so panicked but to be honest it’s not like they were friends or even remotely close.
They started to talk about all the possible charms that could remove the painting from the wall. They tried a few spells that failed and only made Walburga scream again. Not completely hopeless, Draco decided that he would bring some of his books to help the next day. They then decided to clean properly the bathroom on the ground floor, a sanitary nightmare in Draco’s eyes.
Draco jumped when he heard a knock on the door. He exchanged a glance with Harry before going to welcome the last guests.
Draco sighed before going back to his book. It’s only later that day that Harry finally asked his question, lying on the couch.
This only made Harry laugh harder and Draco’s anger couldn’t last hearing such a beautiful sound. When Harry calmed down, he wiped his teary eyes and quickly cleaned himself. Draco did the same and they both sat down on the old couch.
Harry seemed suddenly very uncomfortable and he stood up, came closer to the bed before changing his mind to go stand next to the door.
Harry seemed reluctant to clean the next day and Draco didn’t understand why immediately. Once on the 4th floor, he finally remembered whose rooms were here. Harry went to the first one who belonged to Regulus Arcturus Black. The room was full of dust and seemed strangely empty but it wasn’t one of the worst room and they managed to clean it entirely before lunch.
He could hear Harry’s breathing getting more regular before he finally fell asleep. Harry’s peaceful breathing worked like a lullaby for Draco and he fell asleep shortly after, the ghost of a smile on his face.
Harry looked at him, opened his mouth then seemed to realize who he was talking to because he became serious again.
It seemed to be a frequent thing for him to punch walls. The room was clean but messy, probably because of Harry’s rage.
Harry rolled his eyes before sitting on one of the bed. His mouth a straight line, he was trying hard to calm himself.
Malfoy knew the room had managed to survive, somehow, even after the fire but maybe the curse had changed its properties.
“Hi, nice to meet you. Ron Weasley,” Ron said before shaking Draco’s hand. Draco sat back and he saw that Harry was smiling. He knew better than to let his feelings get the best of him right now but he smiled back, his heart warm knowing that Harry was thankful for his help.
Harry didn’t speak or move after that, sitting in this chair like it meant something, so Draco decided to read the book he had brought with him. Being in the basement with no natural lights, Draco didn’t saw the time passes, especially with Harry’s silence and immobility.
“What are you asking for?” Asked Draco when he saw that Granger was starting to walk faster and faster.
The next day, Harry had slept in one of the bed on the first floor and was still here when Draco came. Harry woke up when he heard the door open, and the rapidity with which his hand reached for his wand made Draco uncomfortable.
The “Harry!”, “How are you?”, “You scared us!” and other marks of affections were only interrupted by Harry’s monotone “I’m fine.”. He seemed bored about the situation and Draco realised that it was probably not the first time Potter had disappeared like that. It would also explain Granger’s lack of protective worry when they had found him laying on the floor.
“I don’t know everything, but from what Sirius told me, it’s mostly the ones that betrayed the family, or the family values. So blood purity, and all that.”
Draco could see that Harry didn’t understand and he couldn’t blame him. Draco served his meal on a plate then looked at Harry. He got a second plate. Harry sat down and they ate together.
He sighed before going to the fireplace. He saw her wink just before he was back to the House Black. He waited for Harry in the drawing-room, trying to calm his nerves. It was not a date. Not at all.
Draco didn’t move, not wanting to wake him, dreading the moment Harry would see their positions, and what it might imply.
Neville looked back, surprised, with teary eyes. He was probably expecting Draco to make fun of him because he stared at him for a while before stating:
He went back to the basement and sat on the couch, his forehead pressed against his bended knees. He knew rejection. It didn’t hurt him anymore but that didn’t mean that he liked it. He stayed like this for a while, wondering if he should just go home or wait. A small part of him hoped that Harry would come for him. He didn’t want to leave because he didn’t want to be alone in his house. The loneliness and the silence of his house were so hard to handle that he decided to stay here, the place that sometimes felt more like home.
In the end, Harry was mostly the one cooking while Draco would just watch, write down some advice and once in a while help a bit. Despite the quite large kitchen, Harry would often bump into Draco or have their shoulders touching without seeming to care. On the opposite, Draco was feeling his cheeks flush every time and he was beating himself up for how childish his reactions were.
He laid still on the now clean but still old small couch for the entire day. Only meeting Draco’s eyes for a moment when they ate at noon.
Before Draco could find other excuses, Harry added: “If you don’t want to cook with me that’s fine, just say it.”
Draco took out his wand and with a sly smile, he cast a jinx toward the tapestry. A blue flame appeared, leaving only a small black hole where his face used to be.
The Glamour made his nose a little longer and turned it up at the tip, made his eyes brown, made him a little taller (though not enough so his trousers looked odd; for some reason, he’d never quite managed to master shifting his clothing without throwing off the proportions, and when he tried harder he got unpredictable results — unlike Draco, who looked like he tailored his outfit every morning in front of the mirror).
“Ron, then. That suits you better.” Topher winked. “Heard that once upon a time, you and the Minister were… smoochy.”
Harry was tired; he rested his hip against the bulky old chest of drawers under the window. It was magical; beautifully carved, with schools of fish dancing in the scrolled corners. He gazed at the slippers on his feet for several long moments, looking up when Draco took a tentative step toward him. Dressed in comfortable flannel pyjamas and a thick, heavy, warm robe, he’d never felt so naked. Not even in that horrifyingly realistic dream place, the inside of his head, with Draco’s lips all over him and Draco’s warm, filthy words in his ear.
It was horribly Gryffindor -esque, in Draco’s estimation, of course. Though his mother had managed to use the ruby tones as an accent instead of making it look as if a lion had actually puked up a spleen, the way the Gryffindor common room had always seemed to Draco. The golds and greys made up the majority of the colour scheme, actually, turning the remaining rock-hewn wall into a feature instead of allowing it to continue looking like a cell.
“I’m glad you and Draco found each other again,” she said, after a long time, and Harry felt his face flush. “Oh, don’t worry, Harry, no one’s been telling secrets. It’s your aura. I’m quite clever at those. When you thought about him at school your aura picked up a little of his colour, some greenish silver in your roaring golden light. Now, you’re positively glowing with it. It’s marvellous, really. I’m pleased.” She leaned against his arm and shoulder. “Maybe that’s why you’re so warm, too. Not sharp and spiky and cold. You’ve lost a lot of your
“You sound like a fucking press conference.” Hermione got to her feet, frustration written all over her face, in bouncing curls and a square jaw and lips pressed into a thin line. “Can you just be Harry Potter for a couple of hours? Will you listen to Draco, Harry?”
“You are. It’s alright; you’re the Minister for Magic, Hermione.” Blaise lowered his hood onto his neck and settled on the arm of an overstuffed chair, which purred disconcertingly. “But I’d be remiss both as your adviser and your future husband if I didn’t give you a minute to figure out exactly why you are procrastinating. It’s hardly your style.”
She swallowed a sob, and raised her glass. Harry did the same, and the gentle chime felt incredibly important, the bell-like sound shifting the mood from somber to something far more hopeful. She took a deep breath, and let it out, and gave Harry a smile. It wasn’t an easy one, but it was a real one.
The sudden rise of the music, and the way everyone stepped up excitedly, following the sounds to the ballroom, was a relief. Harry could leave. With all of the movement… he could leave, and this whole disgusting misunderstanding (as if Draco Malfoy could ever want him like that, with his ridiculous, disobedient hair, his Muggle clothes. With their entire sodding history sitting in every room they shared like a boggart in the corner. Draco had taken pity on him, and wanted to help him find a girl to marry) would be over. Like a gentleman, he ushered everyone in ahead of himself, and as soon as he had a chance, he headed outside to disapparate.
He closed his eyes, and his hands tingled, magic weaving around his fingers and pressing into his skin like sunbeams on an early summer day. He saw, in his mind, the wand — and it
Hermione was a very good dancer, Luna thought idly. But both women were watching Draco and Harry move closer for a very sweet kiss, full of promise.
An errant curled bounced lightly over Draco’s eye, and Harry wanted to tuck it behind his ear. So instead, he stuck his ridiculous hands in his pockets.
On instinct, Harry reached across the space and briefly gripped Draco’s wrist. Draco tolerated it for a moment, and then busied himself rearranging everything from his knees to his robes, pulling away.
“Say it. Say you survived it. Say you want a lifetime, Harry.” Draco gritted his teeth. “Say you want a lifetime with
“Draco, will you do me a favour? There must be a nice bar somewhere close by. Will you give me a break from my overprotective Unspeakable, take him for a drink while Harry and I catch up?” Hermione turned and fixed Blaise with her Minister Granger look. “I still have Parvati — please, Blaise.”
“Think I might need something a little more distilled,” Draco drawled. “So. Bed-hopping Auror twits. Is that how you and Granger tumbled into this… whatever it is? To be perfectly honest, I thought you preferred cock, Zabini.”
the wrong way; but I’m struggling to think of any reason why I should trust you. Do I actually need to remind you that you hate me?”
“Romantic tosh,” Draco agreed, with what he hoped was a look of smug indifference, but knew was probably more like the look on Harry’s face when Dora did something cute. “Side-along? I don’t want you to get ash on those robes.”
“And I got into law school,” Hermione said. “You watch if I’m not running the Ministry by the time I’m thirty.”
“Mother doesn’t believe that this is a lost cause. I’m giving us one last chance to find out if she’s right or not.”
“It’s nice,” Harry said, emphatically, and almost apologetically. Draco waved his wand at the ceiling, and the bright winter night sky was suddenly visible through the magical equivalent of a skylight.
He did not visit Draco’s rooms that night. He went to bed early, so he could wake early and head into Diagon Alley.
“Don’t go easy,” Draco said, when he’d licked a stripe up Harry’s cock, and gently sucked at the head. “I like a good face-fucking. I’ll pinch you if it’s too much.”
“Then why are you here?” the woman said. “I think I was clear — you need a wand, Mr Potter. No one does wandless magic in this training course in the first six months and
— and staring in abject terror at the dragon in front of him. Pain shot through his skull. No, worse than pain — a rush of memories, each more hideous than the last, running backwards until the moment when Harry Potter’s named had appeared from the Goblet of Fire.
“Not as good as I’ll feel when you start to move,” Draco replied, when he had his breath back. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and shoulders, his legs around Harry’s hips, clingy and needy and exactly everything that Harry had ever wanted. “For fuck’s sake, Potter, move,” he snarled.
Hermione pulled him towards the door, and the wards warmed to welcome him, far friendlier than he could remember them. The door opened, and Harry stepped inside, pulled by Hermione and otherwise utterly stunned.
In this particular case, he had known Draco — Christopher Black — for long enough so that they were friends, as well.
“Give who a break?” Harry replied, transparently, and he left the breakfast table before he could see an expression on Neville’s face that he would have to interpret. “Oh, Neville. We’re getting along well, alright? Duelling Club, and… we’re using first names, and — and we went flying together,” Harry said, and wished he hadn’t let himself think about it. Or that moment on the grounds afterwards where he’d wanted to take Draco in his arms and snog him stupid. And tell him he was a disaster, and that Draco shouldn’t ever, ever look at him with his eyes sparkling in that way again, lest he be terribly disappointed with the outcome.
“Because I want to spend the summer here with you. Healing, resting, and showing you exactly how sorry I am at least a couple of times a day.”
“That’s what you think?” Ginny asked, innocently. “Hmm. Funny. Yesterday at brunch Draco looked like he could barely sit, and unless he got bitten by a goblin —”
Draco handed him the gift. Harry stared for a moment and then took it. He untied the ribbon and tucked it into his pocket, and then he tore the paper off.
“Careful,” Draco said softly, to a student in Potions that day before lunch. She was a nervous little thing. Born to Squibs and expected not to have magic of her own, she’d not been exposed to this world until her owl had arrived on her eleventh birthday.
“I’ve been in love with you since we were fifteen years old,” Draco promised. “It took me a long time to find a way to stop thinking about you.”
He didn’t tell her not to cry. He didn’t tell her it wasn’t her fault. He didn’t try to tell her what he’d been through, though she was suddenly desperate to know. He just let her cry. And when she was done, and her eyes were burning, and she was so embarrassed that she thought she might die, Draco carefully pulled away.
Draco nodded. He paled. His eyes — how had they ever looked cold and calculating? They were warm and blue and much like shallow water at the beach on a warm day. So full of care. If Lucius had survived Azkaban, he wouldn’t have survived seeing his son become such a good and kind man. Harry’s mind ran a film reel: Draco gently coaxing him from some inescapable horror, Draco’s fingertips running over his skin in the morning sun. Curled up against Draco’s body, in front of the fireplace.
“Malfoy! What happened?” he asked, patting Malfoy down carefully, trying to find any obvious source of pain.
On the first of December, Harry woke to the tinkling of bells. For a moment he thought someone had come into the shop, and almost launched himself out of bed, and then he realised that Diagon Alley had decorated itself in the night, ready for the Christmas season.
“No, I always let out a good hearty yelp at this time of the morning. I find it to be very cathartic.”
“Then fuck it,” Draco said, looking up through his pale eyelashes at Harry. He sank down slowly, cheeks hollowing, and Harry — well, he’d always thought of himself as a nice, obliging sort of person, so he did precisely as he’d been asked, slowly at first, trying to get a grip on what exactly Draco wanted from him.
For the next several days, he and Malfoy were appallingly polite with one another. Harry hated it. He’d come to enjoy the camaraderie, the playful barbs. But he felt sick and angry every time he thought about the way Malfoy had insulted his living conditions and he wasn’t ready for anything more than a ‘good morning, Professor Malfoy’.
Harry bit his lip, and cast a warming charm on his pie, since he apparently wasn’t allowed to eat it until they were done with this conversation. “Because he’s been skittish as a Cornish Pixie, and I had no idea what to say to you.” He crossed his arms on the table. “You asked me about the night I broke my nose.”
He visited Luna Lovegood and her boyfriends Finn and Grayson the following evening for dinner. He didn’t ask, and he didn’t wait to be invited; he dropped by, as if that was one of those normal things to do, and was welcomed with open arms, only to learn that it was dessert-for-dinner night and all three of them were making absurdly complex sundaes. They sat on a perilous-looking balcony high above the forest below with some sort of Muggle music piping through the house.
Harry was the next one to get them. In his nightmares, everyone he had ever loved was complicit. They didn’t come to stay with him as he moved from one world to the next, to comfort him; no, they just came to watch.
There wasn’t a potion or drug in this world or the other one that he hadn’t drunk or snorted or smoked. Not a single taste he refused himself. He told himself that he had done one thing and that was enough. Never mind the way he started struggling to look at himself in the mirror. His own fucking reflection staring back at him like he was a profound disappointment, if not great surprise. He numbed himself with sex and sleep and food.
In truth, staying awake was no great hardship. Harry had been very carefully rationing out his Dreamless Sleep so as not to encounter too many ill effects, and of course to avoid addiction. Which meant that other nights were very, very difficult. He had been researching spells that might make him forget his nightmares on waking but was getting nowhere. He was getting desperate enough to consider asking Hermione for help, but his conviction that she would recommend therapy had kept him from doing so until now.
Harry, drunk, had repeated this back to Blaise one night. Blaise had roared with laughter and said he thought he was getting rather the better deal, there.)
“Meet you at the Grey Goose in an hour. Try to dress like you don’t have a broomstick up your arse, Malfoy? You might get lucky. Look like you could use it.”
“You may be right,” he agreed, at last. “But that doesn’t make it any more practical. And now I can’t talk about it any more, or think about it, alright? And I need to talk to you about another patient, a little girl.”
“Headmaster,” he said, when she had pushed a chocolate biscuit into his hand, “can I ask you for a favour?”
“Then I think it’s you,” she said, climbing to her feet, a little flushed. “It must be you. You’ll keep me updated,
“You look slightly less like something a Kneazle dug up,” Draco replied. “My compliments to your stylist.”
“I do know that. But no. I want to read them. I’m impressed, actually.” He gave Hermione a broad smile. “Julian Flint appears to have blossomed, somehow. I’m impressed with this work. It must have taken him weeks to sort through that many procurement ledgers.”
At three o’clock in the afternoon on Christmas Eve, Harry took the scrap of parchment that Narcissa’s owl had delivered that morning. He could apparate outside the wards of Malfoy Manor, but without the parchment he couldn’t use the Floo.
Draco emerged from his room in Ron’s jeans (which Ron had decided he could keep), another of Harry’s t-shirts and the same brown cardigan he’d been wearing for three weeks now. He had deep, oily shadows under his eyes but a determination that buoyed Harry somewhat.
And they smiled at each other, and smiled at each other, and smiled some more at each other. Harry hadn’t felt so close to Hermione since Ron had left them alone on their mission to collect Horcruxes.
“Of course not. It’s been over for all of two days, and I’m too stupid to remember anything from that long ago.”
“You’re sorry the most chaste dance ever invented by Pureblood wizards got you hard, Potter?” He didn’t wait for a reply, just took another step nearer. Harry wanted to step back; this close, the height difference made him uncomfortable, and too warm, and somewhat inclined to disapparate again.
But he held up his hand. “All I ever wanted was a simple life like my parents had. Family. I think maybe I used up all my courage in the war. I wanted to be there for you.”
“Well,” Draco replied, “roast beef and turkey, potatoes, lashings of vegetables — Lissie’s French bean salad which looks like nothing special but will change your mind about eating your greens forever…”
Harry smiled, and glanced at the window. It was still light outside and would be, for a while. He knew… he was utterly certain that in his dream, that window had been the pathway to flying up about a mile in the air and being confronted by Dementors. But now, it was only lovely, only the view into some back yards and if he strained his eyes some of the tall buildings in the background.
“It’s not for the potion,” Draco said, neutrally, as the bottle helpfully served them each a measure. “Sit down, would you? You look like you could be done in by a stiff wind.”
The warmer months meant that the bars were full: beer gardens stayed open later, students were on break from their studies, and Harry had made a masterful study of what sort of clothing was most likely to snag the attention of the tortured poetic type he liked so much. He was wearing his hair quite long, these days, and quite enjoying the way it curled at the ends. Slouchy-looking jeans and Doc Marten boots, ragged-looking band t-shirts (and no, he wasn’t a complete tosser; he did know the music, and quite liked it, actually).
Draco didn’t move, didn’t respond. Harry thought he would be better off changing into pyjamas but once he had managed to work Draco’s boots off his feet he was too exhausted to try anything more complicated. And the thought of touching Draco’s body, in however innocent a way, felt like a violation.
. Those were the only words she managed to say out loud, and they were more than enough to paint the picture.
“You got your inclinations towards the dramatic from your father, you know. The Blacks were never so theatrical.”
“I’m not sure I’ve ever been so alright,” Harry said. He could feel the smile stretching over his face, and he felt lighter than air. “Now, let’s go. Did I tell you that you look very pretty tonight, Minister Granger?”
Draco rolled his eyes, but they were sparkling. “Since you asked so nicely, I suppose I could tolerate your presence for the summer.” He ran his hand down over Harry’s chest. So strong, and broad, and overwhelming. “But I would like to know, Harry. What happens in the autumn?”
“I’ve written that down. Thank you. Goodbye,” he said, and he didn’t look away until the door was slammed closed.
“I’m giving you one more chance to leave on your feet and then I’m tossing you into the fireplace with a handful of floo powder. And you’d better believe I don’t care where you end up.”
Malfoy loves him even worse; but you and me, Hermione: none of that is about us. And this can’t be about them.”
“No need to be too precious about those,” he’d say. “Roughly chopped is fine; they’ll disintegrate in the heat very quickly. Press the side of the blade down hard against the seeds and it will be easier to slice them up. No, you’re not julienning those for a coleslaw salad, Harry, you’re shredding them. It needs to be rough to get the oil out.”
“We were at school together,” was all she said, but Draco flicked his eyes up and Parvati looked sad.
Harry tried to look annoyed, but he couldn’t, quite. “Don’t eat all the crackling, prat,” he replied, and Malfoy closed the door.
It was interesting that Granger hadn’t come out and told him that Potter didn’t even have a partner, though.
Potter’s eyes flicked up and met Draco’s and Draco could see that neither of them had been expecting to meet again. Not this way; not trapped together for ten months of the year in a draughty castle full of children. Potter had climbed the steps at the other end of the stage, and now he stood awkward and uncertain. Perhaps he wanted to run.
“Well, a bit,” Ron admitted, uncomfortably. He’d hated the way the house looked before. Hadn’t realised how bad it was, outside of Harry’s bedroom… not that the bedroom was much better.
He had very smoothly transitioned back to his work. He had a lot of patients, and he didn’t think he’d ever been so grateful to be so busy in his life. He had his patients. He had his students. He had — awkwardly enough — a course to teach at the nearby Muggle hospital which had been built to replace the one everyone thought was gone, now, but that was actually a hospital full of Witches and Wizards. He even had PhD students. He was busy. He was so very, very busy.
Draco found his seat at the head table and nodded cordially to Neville and Harry. Harry had clearly elected not to come to Draco for more Dreamless Sleep. He looked rather like he hadn’t slept well since the night of the party at Malfoy Manor. Served him right.
still saw him the way he always had. The way some other people always would. Harry thought he might throw up.
“You’ve been wrong before,” Blaise said, standing, tossing his Unspeakable robes over his shoulders again. “Love, and time, Harry. Longing. Come by for dinner, I’m making Bouillabaisse.” And then he was gone.
“Delilah. I have been offered a post as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
Draco realised rather late that he was still staring down the dragon — and that he had raised his arm, and called for his broom, and then he was in the air, with his eyes on the golden egg down deep in the treacherous rocks below.
“The house looks amazing,” Blaise said, when he’d recovered, draping his cloak on a hat stand and looking around. “Have you finished, then? Want to show me around?”
Harry lay on the couch in front of the fire, his head in Draco’s lap. Draco had a book in his hand, but he was playing with Harry’s hair, too, and he hadn’t complained once that it looked like he had an especially cranky hedgehog curled up on his head.
And there had been the trials. Harry had refused the offer of a place on the Wizengamot because he thought he was too young to be determining the fates of people he knew, or didn’t know. And he wasn’t sure how he could ever be impartial.
“I have grown up, you know,” Draco said. “It would be ever so refreshing if you would try to remember that I don’t see the world the way I did when I was sixteen.”
“Harry, dear,” Narcissa said, sweeping majestically across the room to take his hand, and offer her cheek to be kissed. “What do you think?”
Harry grinned as she passed it back. “I can’t believe this is my life. D’you know, Ollivander thinks that the reason I have the gift is that I have mastered several wands, and wandless magic.”
,” he said, but he didn’t actually sound annoyed. “I think… I think perhaps I’ll do as Draco asked, and just… rest for a while.” He was staring into the fireplace, with his mouth curled into a small smile, looking relaxed and happy for the first time in a long time. Hermione reached across to take his hand. “A week or two.”
He pulled his hands into his sleeves, and took a breath, staring at the green grass beneath his feet. He opened his mouth to say something, and looked Harry right in the eye. Harry didn’t want to feel sorry for Draco Malfoy; he really didn’t. But when he looked into those eyes, when he felt the frenetic energy of his magic spiking all around him — Draco Malfoy, Harry was reasonably sure, was quite broken.
“You just need to give it a little wave,” he said, and she did, causing a sudden hot wind to wind through the shop. “Perhaps not. Alright, try this one.”
That Saturday, a little over half of the staff of Hogwarts accompanied the students to Hogsmeade. They had gifts and cards to buy, window displays to gape at, Christmas lists to write up. The only snow so far was the magical kind, landing conveniently on window sills and not on the footpaths. The day was full of altogether too much in the way of adolescent hormones, exam nerves, and the kind of homesickness that hits right before someone heads home, and when Draco and Harry stumbled into the Three Broomsticks to scoff some lunch it was only the briefest of respite.
It was, for all intents and purposes, a birthday party, and it was a fine evening indeed. Ron and Hermione came, Hermione heavy with her second pregnancy and Ron loudly proclaiming that she would be the youngest ever Minister of Magic by the time the kid could roll onto its belly. Neville, who had offered to help Harry bring his things to Hogwarts — he had taken over as Professor of Herbology eight years prior. Ginny couldn’t make it. As the Captain of the Hollyhead Harpies she was too close to finals to take time off, but she did make an appearance in the fireplace, to everyone’s delight. Luna, who had taken over as the editor-in-chief of the Quibbler (circulation had grown rather a lot since she had proven the existence of various previously denied species).
“You only love me for my cooking,” Harry teased. “D’you know, I had such fun cooking dinner tonight. Remember how I used to do that all the time?”
New Year’s Eve was a play in two acts. In the late afternoon, Harry, Hermione and Ron visited the Burrow for an early supper. Everyone who could make it was there; Ginny, about to start her final semester at school, teasing everyone with her offers to join half a dozen Quidditch teams across the country and asking Harry if he’d met a nice young man yet, and reminding him that Charlie was still single.
“And anyway, have you heard me announce us? I’m Secret-Keeper.” And then in a voice that was something decidedly posh-adjacent, he said “Malfoy Mansion, Wiltshire.” His voice was as rich and smooth as velvet.
How obscene would it be to let him live there? Apparently Draco wasn’t even needed for it to work. Perhaps the dream Draco did a better job than he ever could. It was a thought that Draco couldn’t examine too closely. The last thing he wanted to have to confront was a conflict of interest borne from a twenty-five year old crush.
“The stasis spells can only do so much,” Draco said, quietly. He folded the sheet down and cast a quick spell over Harry’s pyjama top, exposing his chest. Hermione felt herself tense, but Draco seemed to ignore it, reaching for a pot of some sort of potion for Harry’s skin. He was gentle, almost fond, taking his time, massaging it into Harry’s chest and neck carefully before moving to his arms and hands. Hermione only watched.
Harry waited a few moments, and then sighed. He looked through his clothes. Draco had a good six inches on him, but there was a pair of jeans that Ron had left a few weeks ago. They’d be loose around the waist, but no one excelled at tailoring spells like Draco did. (Well. And Pansy and Blaise. Bunch of slick gits.) He found a white t-shirt that wasn’t too worn-out looking; this one was Harry’s. Although he couldn’t actually imagine Draco — this Draco, with his buzzcut and tattoos and makeup — wearing a cardigan, but Harry fished one out just the same, a warm dark brown, soft and comfortable. Socks. A pair of boxer shorts (luckily, he had a new pair that still had the tags — he didn’t want Draco shredding them in an offended rage). He left them on the dresser in the bathroom, along with a clean towel and a fresh bar of soap.
“I think we have, Hermione. And he looks like he’s ready to wriggle out of his chair. Spill it, Harry, or we’ll tip you over and
in his hands and leaned in for another kiss, Harry melted against him. It was true, what he’d said. Draco could feel rather than see or hear the way certain objects in the room began to almost quiver, as the warmth and light which seemed, bizarrely, to be emanating from Harry himself made Draco dizzy with need.
Harry didn’t know why he was surprised to hear voices, and laughter. Of course it wouldn’t be just the three of them. He wondered if his clothes were alright, and then he saw Draco, dressed immaculately in tailored trousers, a white linen shirt that was too well-behaved to crease and a waistcoat.
“I’m fine on my own. All I wanted was a day off.” Harry smiled, an unsure, frankly pitiful smile. “I need to get back to work now.”
“You’re a very strange person, so that tracks,” he said, and let his bones melt as he leaned into a thorough kiss. He almost groaned out loud when Draco broke it prematurely.
“No,” Harry said, smiling, but his skin felt like it might just fly away and leave the rest of him behind. “We have plenty of food in the kitchen.”
“He doesn’t need any bloody potatoes, Petunia, he needs to learn a lesson. And people learn lessons when there are
They both froze, and Potter couldn’t help but glance at the Mark again. Draco sighed. “I’m not sure everyone shares that perspective, but I’ll leave it. For now.” He folded himself elegantly into the second armchair and summoned their glasses back, landing one at Potter’s elbow and one in his own hand. “And it’s not about what anyone else thinks, Potter,
Harry crouched by the bed, examining Draco’s face more closely. He didn’t seem to be injured, but Draco had always been better at low-power, high-focus spells such as those needed for healing than Harry ever would be. Maybe he had been injured. Maybe he had healed himself and then come here, though Harry realised he hadn’t seen Draco’s wand.
Harry looked up from his desk. He was collecting parchments of homework into something approximating a neat pile, and wondering why so many teachers demanded long essays when it just meant there was that much more work to do.
“I didn’t know elves could see you,” Hermione said, when the elf apparated. Blaise didn’t reply. Hermione sighed. “Of course they can. They’re difficult to fool, even if they are easily enslaved.”
had drawn for him, Ron’s untidy lines and appalling handwriting corrected or enhanced by Hermione’s immaculate script, and sat down to study it, quill in his hand so that he could make some notes, and start another version of the map. He had barely started, ands considering a pot of tea, when he heard swearing in the Floo.
“I was just thinking that I’ve imposed for a long time, here.” He glanced at the window. The sun was beginning to set, but Draco surely caught his meaning. “Perhaps I should return to London, let you get back to… your life,” he said, choking a little on nothing at all. He knew that all that time spent with Draco had been in his head. That did nothing to make it feel less real.
Harry shrugged. “Some.” He couldn’t meet Draco’s eyes, though, and that was probably more telling. When he glanced up at last Draco’s expression told him as much. His eyes were soft, and he glanced from Harry’s eyes to his mouth and away again.
“I’m not the same,” Draco said evenly. “I know most people think I’m just toeing a line here, Harry, but I’m not. I was wrong.”
She tossed a pinch of powder into the fireplace in Harry’s room, and in a flash of green flames, Hermione was gone.
Christmas was the usual affair. Too much food, too much drink, more and more small children running around every year. This year, they were all shaking their tiny wands at each other and shrieking in delight as the brightly coloured sparks flew around the room. Teddy’s hair was Weasley-red, and as the oldest child he was determinedly behaving like a good influence.
“I trust him,” she said. “Look at this, Ron. The things we went through — and then the things Harry went through on his own.” She recognised the discomfort on Ron’s face. He didn’t like thinking about these things. He never had. What he’d done with his entire life wasn’t dissimilar to what Harry had done in his head. He hadn’t come through unscathed, but he wasn’t drowning in it, either.
The following morning, stepping into the Great Hall, Draco beamed despite himself. The first of December, of course! Hogwarts Castle had decorated itself overnight, and it was snowing in the Great Hall, settling only on the Christmas trees, never landing on the ground, or on a student. The fireplace roared, and the scent of cloves was overwhelming. All students loved this, but Draco was always especially pleased to see the first years’ reactions. The first time they’d seen anything quite like it, and they’d stumble, wide-eyed, or stand stock still with their mouths hanging open.
, to do absolutely nothing, to rest. I didn’t even know what I would do with a day like that. But I knew if he… if
,” Hermione said, giving Ron’s thigh a squeeze. “I didn’t think there would ever come a day when I would climb into bed and realise I hadn’t thought about the war a single time since I’d woken up.”
Draco gave her a half-smile, and even with that unfamiliar face pasted over his own it was a distinctly Malfoy half-smile.
(It was still very strange to Harry how readily she had accepted that the reason they hadn’t worked out was that he’d figured out at long last that he was — in Ginny’s words, telling the entire Weasley clan the following evening — as gay as a hat full of butterflies. He’d laughed as hard as the rest of them, and while he’d had a moment of panic, it was good to get it out of the way in one fell swoop.
Harry snickered. “Look, I was already in the habit. We used to stalk each other at school all the time. Usually took turns, but I have to admit I was always better at it than he was. He mostly sprang from corners, desperate for attention.”
Hermione nodded again. The smell of the books was comforting. She kept staring at them, letting them anchor her in the room.
“I only know it wasn’t his,” Parvati muttered in reply. “I’ll wait in the corridor. Let me know if you need help.”
When Hermione came downstairs a little while later, talking at a mile a minute about his cover story, Harry paid no attention.
When he glanced left, Harry sodding Potter was coming at him at a terrifying speed, smiling from ear to ear; and just as Draco was starting to worry that Harry hadn’t seen him, he screeched to a dramatic halt, only a couple of feet away.
Draco turned his body until he was facing Harry properly. He reached out to trace the curve of his jaw.
“I remember,” Hermione said, and she crawled across the couch to burrow into Harry’s arms and rest her head on his shoulder.
“We should stop,” he murmured, with more self-control than he thought he could muster. Harry pressed his face into Draco’ neck and groaned. Less seductive and more disappointed. “We do have a party to get through. Dinner will be served soon.”
“Leave him be, Petunia,” the man said, sounding annoyed. “That little freak has to learn one way or another, and he doesn’t learn when we tell him! Can’t be pushing Dudley over when he doesn’t get his own way.”
Harry didn’t think he could ever be a parent. He’d had no good role models. But he thought that he had the knack of being a Godfather down quite well, having known Sirius for at least a few years. Teddy seemed to have no complaints, and nor did Hugo or Rose.
He fastened his robes at his throat and walked straight-backed through the door to his quarters, locking it behind him, and opened the classroom door.
“I told you about the Dementors, and the Wizengamot. And this… Sirius’s room, obviously. It’s a doorway into what I can only assume is the Death Room in the Department of Mysteries — I was an idiot, I thought that would prove to be his worst memory of that time. And it was fucking
The Hog’s Head was quiet; it was never as full as the Three Broomsticks, but also, the night was cold, and Hogsmeade was quiet in general. Harry spent a few minutes speaking with Aberforth, and, in possession of two pints of Abner’s Ale and two chasers of a rather lovely, almost ruby-coloured firewhiskey, he took a seat at the table Neville had chosen, close to the fireplace.
Harry sat patiently. Or rather, impatiently, and full of energy, and ready to gather up his favourite students immediately.
Harry shook his head, and sped down the corridor. “I’m sure it’s for a good reason. When Sirius comes back from his holidays I’ll ask him.” Down the stairs. Away from the strange hint of something being very wrong upstairs, Draco’s strange questions. It was his day off. He didn’t want to think about doors and things. He wanted to argue about the crossword and eat breakfast and get a shag and stretch out on the couch with his head on Draco’s thigh while Draco read out loud.
“Perhaps in the future a standing invitation might be in order, Minister Granger,” he said, taking out his wand to rinse down the crease in his robe, and then smoothing down his hair. “I’m not accustomed to being treated like a criminal.”
They fought bitterly over the last two dumplings (a curse on whoever thought eight was a good number) and packed the leftover noodles away, knowing full well they’d be scarfing them down for breakfast in a few hours.
“If you let yourself die,” he said, pretending his voice wasn’t weak and watery, “I swear by Merlin and Morgana that I will raise your ghost and make you haunt me for the rest of my life.”
“We hurt each other,” Harry said, holding Draco’s eyes. “I’m not sure I’ve ever found way to express how sorry I am about that.”
That was as honest as he had ever been to anyone outside of his closest friends — and inadvertently, Draco Malfoy. He didn’t miss the sharp intake of breath across the room.
Draco shrugged. “Some people don’t like to ask for help. It sounds like he has been keeping a great deal inside for a very long fucking time. I don’t think it’s entirely fair for you to blame yourself, Hermione.”
“Aesop,” the boy replied, looking cheered to have the conversation. “He’s a good owl. My family lives in Australia. He flies a very long way, but he’s never once complained. And he brings me Tim-tams.”
Draco sucked air through his teeth as Harry bit it gently. “No. Just regular Muggle tattoos… Potter, please…”
“I will,” Draco said, but his eyes were still on Harry’s face. What the fuck was wrong with him? Why couldn’t he feel the weight the air in the room? Why didn’t he come over and snog the life out of Draco and see what might happen next?
“It’s not for me,” Harry said. He raised his glass. “And it never was. To finding our places in the world,” he added festively. And suddenly, he thought of Draco Malfoy in tight leather pants, playing guitar on stage with his eyes heavily rimmed in kohl. He hoped that in one way or another, Draco had found his place, too.
“Heads are gone. Walburga is curtained, since she has a permanent sticking charm of some kind on the back. I’ve thought about cutting into the wall, but the house gets so cross with me. I can’t have Kreacher
“I know where to find you,” Harry said. “Come see what I’ve done with the attic, and then we can go and get pissed.”
“Flattery will get you nowhere. I know we don’t have our appointment until late this afternoon, but I wanted you to think about something before then.”
“Oh, yes — gosh, Harry. You should have seen that. Have you read the part; she wasn’t even working. She was on her way to meet friends at the Leaky Cauldron, and the next thing we know she’s calling for three stunned and body-bound burglars to be collected.”
He saw Katie Bell, heard the way she’d screamed. The dazed expression on her face when Draco had used the
One evening Harry apparated to Diagon Alley and walked to Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes, stopping from time to time to share a very awkward minute or two with stranger after stranger, all of whom had opinions about his health, his decisions, and him in general, and many of whom wanted to take a photograph with him. But he found himself at the shop, in the end. Summer holidays, and the place was full of children dragging exhausted-looking parents around. Ron looked up from the counter, and his whole face lit up.
“Ron liked you,” Hermione said, suddenly. Changing the subject, maybe, but more to the point she wanted Draco to know. “I saw him after you visited Twelve Grimmauld Place. He was very enthusiastic. He— he
Hope came. And Harry didn’t care, anymore, for equanimity; he let hope settle in his heart like an ember. Blaise was right. It was time.
“Perhaps the Ministry doesn’t need to know I’m back just yet. Or you could tell Robards that I need some time off.”
“I think I failed to understand a great deal about that boy,” Narcissa said. “And presumed too much about the sort of man he might become.”
fond. And I’m not saying that it would be easy for everyone to just forget the past. But Arthur is a very good judge of character, Harry dear, you mustn’t think he’s not just because he’s kind.”
Harry wanted to laugh. They couldn’t have looked much less like Harry and Malfoy, but they couldn’t have looked much more like them, either.
“Goodnight, Draco,” he said quietly, and headed to his own bedroom to read until he was ready to sleep.
“Indeed.” He sighed. “If it will make you feel any safer, I could remind you that I owe you rather a number of life-debts. If you’d like, you can collect on one by asking me to refrain from poisoning you. Forever, if you like, or if that’s too tedious a commitment we could say until you retire from Hogwarts? We could take up our blood feud again as old men.” Potter looked distinctly uncomfortable about that, and less than inclined to ask questions about it, but Draco resolved to make sure he understood the concept, sooner rather than later.
“Nah. That was fun. He was never upset about that.” Hermione felt Ron… sort of spike, emotionally, and then shut himself back off again. It wasn’t the first time she’d felt something like that from him. “We should look for a trap door.”
And despite all of that, Harry Potter was buried a thousand kilometres underground in the only reality he could manage.
He realised as he followed Blaise into the sitting room that he missed Potter. No matter how bizarre their moments together were, he missed the man. Draco missed who he was in those dreams. No sarcasm, or at least, nothing starkly
been having fun, all those years, out partying every weekend, and he was surprised he had been able to keep a job at St. Mungo’s when he had to have been perpetually hung over.
Draco forced himself to look in the mirror. He looked terrible, his usually pale skin almost grey and his hair limp. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d got even six hours of sleep, let alone the eight or nine that he’d enjoyed for his entire life. And he was trembling. His father would have been disgusted. Malfoy’s didn’t tremble. Blacks, neither; the madness running in that line was the type that heated the blood, not the kind that blunted one’s nerves. But Draco was trembling.
“Yes, it is. And after Ron left training and started working at his brother’s shop. Did you see much of Harry?”
“My son was a petty, spiteful child, and then… trapped in a situation he had no way to escape. He did the only thing he thought he could do, embracing the image of the young terror, strutting around with his Mark hidden under his robes, talking about how we would usher in a new world. But he is a good man. He has been a good man for many years. I’d like you to try to remember that, Harry.”
. I have to go. Ask her out, you utter git. She was mad about you in school. Or I shall come up with a better threat. One you’ll believe.”
Harry made a sound in the back of his throat, and Draco felt his arms twitch. He wanted to reach out and slip his arms around Harry’s body, but he didn’t; it felt for all the world like he was trying to entice a frightened cat, though Harry was neither easy to frighten, nor skittish, ordinarily.
“So many beautiful old things,” Mrs Malfoy said, with a sigh. “So much old, old magic.” Her attention was caught by a clasp for robes, and Harry made a mental note.
Harry shook his head. “The last thing I need is money.” He was silent for a few long moments. “I saw Draco.” Harry hadn’t meant to say it; he really hadn’t. It just tumbled from his lips, a truth he’d been needing to tell for months, now. Blaise said nothing, but he visibly tensed.
But she had taken a few steps away, toward Draco’s shelves, and was examining the spines of his books. “I’d love to get lost in this library for a few… months,” she said. “I’m not procrastinating.”
Sometimes, when Draco Owled his mother, he found himself writing the same kind of delicate prose and then leaving the most important things for the postscript. Perhaps he thought it took the sting out. He paused another moment and set quill to parchment once more.
“As it so happens I know the best Healer in that particular area of medicine. She is about a hundred and twenty years old, and bald as a bat, except for the tufts of grey hair that sprout from her ears. A delight to chat with, though.”
“Oh, yes,” she said, confidently. “I do. Partly because people I love and trust have told me that for my whole life — my mother and father, Morgana bless them. And you, and Ginny and Hermione, and Ron, and Lavender Brown — she is positively thriving as a werewolf, did you know? Has a little school for them and everything, and they go to Hogwarts if they have good control. And Finn and Grayson, who are at least as amazing as I am, and perhaps even a little bit more.”
“We could skip the ceremony and go straight to the consummation,” Harry growled. “You look fucking spectacular, Draco. But these robes will look even better in a pile on the floor later.”
“Your tattoos,” Harry said, kissing one of the dark tendrils which quested down over Draco’s chest to curl around his nipple. “They don’t move.”
“Morning, Draco,” he said, and Merlin, was he a sight. His eyes were bright. His skin was pale with cold, his cheeks apple red; his hair, ludicrous at the best of times, was right then doing its very best impression of the whomping willow. His glasses were slightly askew, and Draco wondered how in Merlin’s name he was keeping them on at all, at those speeds. And Draco loved the way his name sounded, when Harry said it. Like an endearment.
“If you think it more likely that this… very sweet, but twisted little domestic arrangement has transpired this way simply because I am the one who showed up in his head, then tell me.”
Harry looked down at a second-year Hufflepuff boy with an overbite so severe he reminded Harry of Neville, before puberty had swept him into the realm of the truly spectacular.
When the day’s classes were done, and students were tucked up safely in their common rooms, already complaining about how much homework they had, Draco sat by the fire in a pose he had learned best served him when he sought a specific memory. It took a few minutes, but he found it.
“Well? Because — if I’m wrong about this, which I’m not, I’d appreciate you saying so right now. There’s a rather fetching young wizard due to join the party any minute now, and if I’m not getting into your pants at some time in the near future, I’ll set about trying to get into his.”
He experienced rejection rather like most people experienced, say, a slow beheading with a rusty spoon.
“And I need you to think about what I might have missed. A trauma. Something truly scarring. The worst memory he might have of the time before the war. I’ve walked in the Forbidden Forest with Harry, and watched him die. There’s something in his mind which is, for him, worse than that.”
“You don’t know what it was like,” Hermione said, again. “The three of us… every time we looked at each other, we were back in the thick of it. You can’t know how many times we nearly died. How frightened we were, all the time.”
The next knock sounded terrifyingly exhausted. Harry ran across the wooden floorboards and opened the door without even looking out. There was someone on the front step; homeless? Hurt? He pulled the door open the rest of the way and pulled the body inside.
He took a long, hot shower before dressing in plain old Muggle jeans and a t-shirt, tossing a hooded sweatshirt over the top. Sunday. He had some work to do, and he had been debating finding someplace to do some flying, and…
He shivered. He’d let the fire die down. He tossed a quick charm at the fireplace to stoke the flames, and made his way to the outer door. It was Neville Longbottom.
“No, we’re not. And you’re right; when we were children, I did hate you. I wished Voldemort had killed you when you were a baby.” Draco hadn’t expected quite this degree of honesty to tumble from his lips, but here it was.
The bench in Regent’s Park where Blaise was now sitting was the same one he had been sitting on that night that he heard his calling. One he had often returned to when he needed to think. He didn’t expect anyone to join him, and no one did, save a student who sat for an hour with a textbook in her hands. She didn’t notice him. She drank a bottle of something that was a frightening lime colour and couldn’t have been very healthy. She ate an apple, and tossed the core into the lake. And she read, and Blaise thought, and she read, and Blaise kept thinking.
The first time the bell over the door rang Harry’s heart began to race, his pulse almost painful in his throat, certain that it was Draco escaping; but it wasn’t. It was an older woman whom Harry had met several times; she had been a political correspondent for the Prophet, until she had retired to write romance novels. She was very good at it.
Harry had been staying with Hermione for almost three weeks, the day she came home to find Crookshanks tense and flabbergasted by the arrival of a Kneazle kitten of dubious origin and odd colouring, and the house smelling like a rich, peppery stew. Three weeks. He hadn’t yet said anything about going back to work, and she didn’t want to ask. He had spent time with the Weasleys, who still got together on Sundays, as many of them as could gather. He’d talked to strangers in coffee shops. And he’d cooked so much and so well that Hermione was starting to think she’d need to start letting out her robes.
“She’s been through hell and back,” Draco said, in the end. “I’m going to bed.” He sat up, and rubbed his eyes, and forced himself to his feet. What he really wanted to do was lie with his head in Harry’s lap and talk to him the way they’d talked in Harry’s head, but he couldn’t. He had just reached the stairs when Harry called out again.
Fifteen minutes later Harry was devouring his breakfast; it was absolutely delicious, and also, he had no idea whatsoever why it was called son-in-law eggs, and had decided he didn’t care. It was salty, and spicy, and seemed to warm him from the inside out.
There were a lot of people in that photograph who Draco recognised, and others who he could guess at. He felt ill. He wished for a fierce moment that he wasn’t a Malfoy, nor a Black. That he had known the warmth of families like these.
, Mrs Malfoy. Something I hadn’t thought could happen in a hundred years.” He paused to examine a strange bronze statue that was flexing its muscles and adjusting its hair. “It’s not something I’m prepared to risk for… something I know I’ll get wrong. I’ll do the wrong thing, say the wrong thing — I don’t know how to be… I don’t know how to
Strangely, Harry wasn’t sure he could argue with that. He couldn’t figure out why, but there was something about it that sounded true.
Zabini winked at him. “Happy Christmas, Potter. See you on the thirty-first,” he replied, as he tossed the powder into the Floo and stumbled in, shouting an approximation of his address.
“Well,” Draco said, “pay attention, then, Potter. I know how easily distracted you are. First thing is, you’ll notice I do this.” He pulled the sheet down off of them both. No stupid orange pyjama pants. No anything, actually, except an impressive erection Draco didn’t mind admitting he was looking forward to getting his mouth on again, even if it was only in a dream. Harry grinned, and linked his fingers behind his head.
“We’ll know what to do next when that time comes, Draco. I love you. The rest is details.” His expression was so tender and so sure that Draco’s throat ached. Their foreheads rested together, and Draco enjoyed the heat of Harry’s body, soaking it up.
“I’m — supposed to kill Dumbledore.” Draco wanted to tear his eyes from Harry’s, but he couldn’t and he didn’t. “And if I don’t — he’ll kill my parents, and he’ll make me watch. And then he’ll kill me.”
late twenties. But he hasn’t got the memo yet. I mean, fair play to him, and all. He can stick his knob wherever he likes. Might be about time I encouraged him to stop pointing it at me, is all.”
He opened the wardrobe and pulled down three quilts, casting warming charms between each one, slowly burying Draco in a pile of patchwork. He spoke soothing nonsense the whole time, resisting the urge to ask questions. Draco couldn’t have answered them, and he was worried Draco might disappear in the night if he felt cornered. He didn’t seem to be asleep, though, or not completely asleep, anyway; his eyes were sometimes open a crack, and sometimes squeezed shut, as if he was trying to stay in his head, trying not to acknowledge the world at all.
“She was my best friend, Minister. Hermione,” he corrected, taking a seat. He was as graceful as he had ever been. Very attractive, really, now that he wasn’t a complete git. “Greg didn’t cope too well with… well.” Hermione nodded. The Fiendfyre. She knew. Vincent Crabbe screaming as he disappeared into the flames that Gregory Goyle had created. “It’s one of the reasons I got interested in… all of this,” he said, gesturing elegantly around the room. “He didn’t use magic for years, but he had a Squib uncle who had a distillery in Galway. They stayed there for years, and she and Greg learned the trade. They’re back in Scotland now, of course.”
“It’s too cold for ice cream,” Harry insisted. Teddy weighed a tonne. Four years old — it was hard to believe. Harry put him down.
Draco sat heavily on a chair that was furred with dust. It was the least dignified thing Hermione had seen him do in decades, and something inside her softened a little at the sight of it. She followed suit.
The hot water was a revelation, but his hand was a rather better one. He was furiously turned on, and hard as diamonds, and he couldn’t keep the moan in his throat as he fucked furiously into his fist, eventually spilling over his hand, hitting the wall of the shower in ropy splatters.
“Er,” Harry replied. “Thanks?” He didn’t look up. He knew what the place looked like, and it was fine. Though suddenly, he didn’t want anyone looking at it. He stood up. “I think you should both leave.” He cast a spell to unfold the chair all the way down flat so that Malfoy could sleep, and summoned a couple of blankets. “Madam Pomfrey, I shall send an elf if I need you, but I think I should just keep an eye on him for tonight. This curse is one I know well, and I can deal with any minor setbacks. Goodnight.”
“I didn’t see that she’d found those,” Draco said. He couldn’t see the photographs, only knew that Harry had likely kept them tucked away for a reason. “I apologise, Harry. She shouldn’t have —”
He remembered the potion Madam Pomfrey had given him that year — not all the time, she’d warned it was addictive and could cause an eventual decline into madness, but in the worst times she’d given him at least a little. In his early years as an Auror he’d fallen back onto the stuff when times were especially difficult. But in the years since, he’d learned to get by; he’d wake up drenched in sweat and tell himself over and over again that it was a nightmare, that he was safe, that none of his traps had gone off and he was alone in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, or the flat he often used in the ministry building if he’d worked too late.
Harry looked dumbstruck, and then he smiled, weakly, wide eyes betraying something ridiculous going on in his fat head that Draco didn’t have the energy or inclination to investigate. “That’s very kind.”
“I hope it was better than mine.” Harry flushed again. “I mean — better than my unconscious mind’s idea for how to get a day off,” he corrected.
It hadn’t been easy in the beginning but when he had forced himself to stop wondering about the time he’d quickly found it was a lovely way to exist.
“Not here.” She sighed. “Come and stay with me, for a little while, please. Blaise and I have a couple of spare bedrooms. I’ll have the files sent over if you’ll rest while you read them.”
“And then I thought perhaps you just didn’t like me that way.” He stepped closer, and let his gaze run over Harry’s body, slowly. Too slowly. “But unless you had a sausage stuffed in your knickers I don’t think that was the problem.”
Suddenly, Harry looked both younger and much, much older, unsure of himself. Draco felt his heart clench. What did a boy who’d grown up under the stairs know about good design, or how nice it was just for things to look pretty? Harry must have thought he’d ascended to Merlin’s Kingdom when he’d arrived at Hogwarts, with the big, comfortable beds, and overstuffed sofas, cushions everywhere. Draco could see it, suddenly.
Neither Draco. The young, terrified Draco in the bathroom with tears burning his face, or the now-Draco. The stakes had never been this high. He’d win or fail here tonight.
“Still. I imagine you know lots of lovely people. People who are only funny and kind, instead of funny and kind
“Me too,” Alaric slurred. “Oh, but I did have a point, I almost forgot. The point is — I don’t know what’s with you and your, uh. Spindly potions master friend. But. Weirder things have happened. I guess it’s because of the…?”
Harry hadn’t been expecting to go home, of course. Couldn’t bring a Muggle one-night stand back to Grimmauld Place without obliviating him afterwards and that just seemed so
“How about we go and get some lunch, then?” Harry said, panic sharpening his voice. “The Leaky, perhaps.”
“In this political climate? You have to be joking, Harry.” Andromeda cast a warming charm over her grandson. “I wouldn’t be here myself if you hadn’t convinced me I’d regret it one day. Maybe you were right.”
“So much better than my imagination,” Harry growled, when he’d taken his mouth off Draco’s cock. “Fuck, Draco — I wish you could see yourself right now. Every inch of you. Unbelievable.”
“Breathe, Minister Granger,” he said, sounding bored. “I do try to be punctual, but I’ll remind you if I must that I have
Harry watched, mesmerised, as the butterfly slowly moved its wings, watching him. And he didn’t feel any regret when it flew away.
a complete sentence. He didn’t know how to be. No one had taught him. “I don’t know the forks to use. I don’t know how to dance. I don’t know how to show someone I care about them, except by throwing myself in the path of danger to keep them safe. I couldn’t be a good… I wouldn’t be good enough for… and anyway.”
Ollivander waved him off. “It’s not that, not at all. The truth is, if someone doesn’t know how to make a wand, you can’t teach them.”
The woman, Petunia, looked disinclined to argue, but glanced at the door of the cupboard. No one saw Draco. Which was a pity, since it meant he probably couldn’t transfigure them all into shoes.
“Say hullo to Ron for me,” Harry said, choking, and he disappeared into the fireplace in a green puff.
— he really did need to sample the local specialty before he left. They found a quiet table, easy when the bar wasn’t very full, and Draco slumped into a chair. Not miserable, though, at all. Perish the actual fucking thought.
“This — this shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “You weren’t of age. No matter what the fucking Goblet of Fire said, you shouldn’t have been made to do this. You shouldn’t have come here or seen
“I am rather brilliantly observant, Harry, perhaps you’ve heard. And you’re right. You’re good at most things, but this — no, you’re not very good at it at all. I seem to remember that the last time I got close enough to try that you disapparated through about a thousand years of wards to get away from me. It’s the sort of thing one doesn’t forget in a hurry.”
“Hallo,” Ron said in a stage whisper, opening the door, as the strange guest stepped over the threshold. “Listen, I don’t want to use your last name in case the old bat hears. Can I call you Chris?”
under his breath. “The green is the things he’s talked about that never happened, or that happened differently.” Draco tapped his finger. “You and Ron getting married and having children. Cedric winning the cup. Graduation.”
They hadn’t laid eyes on each other since Harry had spoken for her at her trial. “Mrs Malfoy,” Harry replied, offering Draco’s mother — his
Well, almost everything. He maintained his own anonymity, but he did describe a famous Wizard who Draco had attended school with, and the terrible and wonderful realisation that his patient’s fantasy life had involved him, and the way he had… there was no other way to say it, but the way he had abused that fantasy to force Harry to recover. To his credit, Emrys’ expression remained utterly neutral from beginning to end, and he didn’t ever hold Draco’s eyes for longer than Draco felt comfortable with.
Malfoy didn’t watch. It would have been easy to think that he was, but he wasn’t. Harry could see how his eyes were unfocused, and his hands perfectly still. He was there, but his mind was somewhere else, and Harry was prepared to bet it was a long way from Wiltshire.
Draco dropped into a chair, all spindly-legged and frustrated, and Hermione Summoned a pot of tea and two cups.
Draco wanted to chase him down and talk to him. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere without students, or twenty years of ugly history between them, or…
“Lovely,” Neville said, stirring the blackberries through. Draco pushed his own plate away, heading for the dungeons.
Ron shrugged, looking uncomfortable. “Dunno why, but I can’t make myself hate him as much just now. Feels like kicking a crup. It’ll probably wear off in a day or two.”
Not prepared to finish that sentence. He took a tub of a moisturising potion. Harry’s skin was dry, and skin contact was good for patients who had experienced trauma. Draco began with his hands, and his arms. His hands were calloused and his arms bore a thousand small scars. Why? Most spell-damage could be healed completely. How much damage did it take to leave this kind of a mess?
Harry just stirred and stirred, tossing in a few extra cherries when Molly was pretending not to watch him.
The following day, Harry presented the envelope to Kingsley Shacklebolt. Kingsley read over the contents several times.
The following morning Harry left a fleeting kiss on the sleep-warm lips of the man he’d just shagged stupid. “That was fun,” he said.
They sat in quiet contemplation for a long time. Harry felt numb. What little anger he had was directed inward. He should have known that Malfoy hadn’t changed.
He’d seen this coming. A more senior position. More responsibility. They did love trotting him out in front of reporters from time to time to describe the ‘Boy Who Lived’ as the youngest Auror to… well, scratch his arse, it sometimes seemed.
“Well, he did,” Ron said. “And I think he’s right. I decided to become an Auror because Harry was, too. But I think you might have been right, Harry.”
Back at Hermione’s house he turned on the WWN, humming along tunelessly to songs he didn’t know the lyrics to, and soon the house smelled like onions sautéed in butter. He sang and he chopped a variety of interesting mushrooms, and as he sweated the rice, and it was only when his face began to ache that he realised that he’d been smiling for hours.
“Definitely still obsessed with me. I’m not doing anything wrong. I’m trying to live my life, and you’re not a part of it anymore. So if you could do me a favour, Potter, lift your bottom lip off the rat-piss flavoured asphalt and
“I — yes,” Hermione said. “Anything. Of course. Send a Patronus when you’re ready and I can meet you anywhere you like.”
“You did,” Greg said. “You bet us all a million galleons that they’d get married one day. I don’t have a million galleons, though,” he said, sorrowfully, to Blaise. “But you remember, mate?”
“A delightful gift for a school chum,” Mrs Malfoy replied, her voice dry. “I had hoped you might have found your way to seeing things differently, with a little time to think.”
Draco took to rather dramatic and formal apologies, the responses to which generally sat somewhere along a spectrum from grudging to amused. Hermione gave him a tight hug (made awkward by her growing baby bump) and Ron said there were no hard feelings but if it happened again he was going to have Charlie feed Draco to his dragons. Pansy promised it was water under the bridge, and that she was completely over it but would almost certainly bring it up whenever she was the least bit drunk.
Hermione nodded. Marrying Ron. She’d always imagined — but then it just hadn’t worked, and the three of them had fallen apart, after the war, and it had taken so long to find their way back to each other. She didn’t blame herself for that. Ron and Gabrielle were happy, she and Blaise were happy, and… and Harry had created an entirely new reality, all because…
Harry leaned forward in his seat. His robes were the sort of semi-formal robes he always looked so good in, and always wore wrong, with just a little too much adventure in his expression and his hair a little too wild. Like he had learned the rules of polite society but still thought they were fucking stupid. He was probably right.
The boy who had walked to his death at the hands of a Dark Lord in the forbidden forest was now trembling in the face of a kiss.
She danced on the spot, nauseatingly praising the Hero of Hogwarts before vanishing with another crack.
“You all seemed so desperate for a solution and for a moment... I guess -I guess I forgot that I wasn’t part of the group.”
That’s how he spent the entire summer of 1998. He would sometimes lay in bed all day just sleeping and flipping without cares through his books. His mother had asked a few times if he wanted to go back to Hogwarts for the last year but she stopped when she saw how little her son cared. To care about the future, you would need hope but Draco didn’t have any, not anymore.
“I said … I said that he is always mad because he can’t deal with the facts that he didn’t save everyone.”
A few years back and he would have felt mad and disrespected by her tone. Now he only wanted to be done with this.
“The house belonged to the Black’s family. After Sirius’s mother died, the house was unoccupied but belonged to him. Then after he escaped from Azkaban, he gave the house to the Order of the Phoenix. Sirius’s then left the house to me in his will.”
Draco didn’t want to go. He didn’t want to clean the last floor. He had decided to stay in his bed and wallow. It had worked for a while until he felt guilty for not even warning Harry about his absence. He wrote a letter to him. He still felt guilty so he wrote another to Pansy, and another one to Blaise. He hadn’t answered their letters for the whole summer.
“What is-” Draco started before stopping in his track, afraid of what Harry might ask him in return.
Harry sighed before putting down his glasses. Draco put his arms around him to bring him closer, needing to be sure that Harry would not indulge in his consuming remorses. Harry’s head ended up against Draco’s chest again while Draco’s left hand was gently playing with his hair. It was raining outside which was creating a nice and calm atmosphere. Time passed and neither of them knew which ones felt asleep first, still glued together, too scared to let go.
The next day, Draco was awakened by a loud thump on the door. He knew his mother was already working so he went downstairs slowly, his wand at the ready.
Here it is, finally. The last chapter. We finally get to know what the 'strange gaze' means and we also get to why some characters are tagged ... Enjoy !
Madam Pomfrey shooed the group to give Potter some space but they didn’t move, all waiting for his answer. He looked lengthily at Draco probably trying to see if he had other motives before finally saying “Alright, Malfoy.” He extended his hand to Draco who looked at the hand in confusion.
Draco swallowed loudly and stood up too. Everyone was quiet again, looking at them with furrowed brows. Harry took Draco’s hand is his before saying:
Almost everyone was here now, chatting and laughing in the dining room. Only Pansy and Blaise were late, which meant that nobody was expecting them. Draco was sitting nervously next to Harry and Hermione. She was trying to include him in the discussion that she was having with Luna but Draco was in his own little world, anxiety bubbling in his knotted stomach. Ron was telling a funny story to Harry, Dean and Seamus. Ginny was listening to Neville but she kept glancing at Luna. Everyone was so happy while Draco was slowly feeling like an outsider. They all, except Hermione and Ron had seemed a bit startled to see him here too, especially seeing him welcome them with Harry. Neville was probably the most affected because he hadn’t looked at him in the eyes once since he arrived.
Draco had a faint smile and then he felt Harry’s warm arms retract. Trying to keep his head up, he looked at Harry, who was very close to him.
The problem was, Draco realized the next day, it didn’t really matter what Harry wore or did. He was now just always very attractive to his eyes.
“NO, FUCK YOU DRACO! I came here, trying to understand. Trying to apologize but you act like an arsehole. And I-”
He could feel guilt building up, but he decided to shove it down. Harry had made it clear that he didn’t need him.
“Yes, but I’m also a person that knows how badly words can affect someone. Even when you don’t mean them.”
When he arrived at his house, his mother was still at work. He immediately went to his room, put down his belongings then he collapsed on his bed and started crying. Everything came back to him, the fear of the Dark Lord, the horror of the war, the exhausting trial, his father going to Azkaban, the pain of his mother, the feeling of loneliness. It was as if he'd finally pulled the plug that had blocked all his emotions for a long time.
Draco leaned over to kiss him when they heard a loud knock. Harry threw a look at Draco meaning “Ready?” to which Draco answered with a fake smile.
The thought hadn’t cross Draco mind before. Harry was now alone in this old house, full of painful memories when he was already suffering.
“Come on, Potter. No food if you don’t move from that couch,” he said after one long hour at the place.
Harry shoot him a dark glance before stretching, he immediately winced probably because of his bad sleeping position. He stood up and walked around the room before seeing Draco’s meal on the counter.
“I’m waiting,” said Draco crossing his arms, putting on the side of his mind the fact that Harry had asked someone to go ask the school house-elves to have the recipe of his favourite dessert. He would freak out about that later.
“We started cleaning Sirius’s floor and … Harry just seemed so sad and hurt and I didn’t really feel like leaving him but I didn’t want to ask if he wanted me to stay.”
The next day and the day after that, they cooked and baked again. Between cooking and baking, they would read and just enjoy each other company, at least on Draco’s side. On Wednesday, Harry wanted to bake something he had never tried before, a Victoria Sponge Cake.
“Maybe. Or maybe he actually believed what he said. That you could be saved. Is it so wrong to think that he was right?”
Harry’s face went white and he moved away too. Draco could understand. The scene still often came back in his nightmares. It was such a messy memory.
Draco stopped in his tracks, because he had just found the Slytherin dorms, and he could see the names of his old friends, or at least the ones that had come back to Hogwarts like Blaise. He understood why Harry had been looking at this map recently. He was keeping an eye on his friends, from far away.
The next day, Draco woke up early in the morning to try to cook something. He had tried cooking a few times since he was living with his mother. Every time he had managed to make something eatable but not necessarily good. This time was no different. He had expected cooking to be like potions but no matter how well he followed the instructions, he could never have a satisfying result. A bit defeated, he thought about going back to bed but an owl disrupted his thought. It was a letter from Granger asking if everything was alright and telling him that there was a fireplace at 12, Grimmauld Place that she had asked to be connected to the Floo Network again.
He rolled his eyes but when he saw how scared she looked, he reassured her “I will. I can handle Potter.”
He let her in before closing the door. It was better to have a conversation inside than in front of this awfully curious neighbourhood.
“Maybe we should have start with just one or two people to see the reaction?” said Draco, closing his eyes.
“Draco!” shouted Pansy, jumping at him and hugging him tightly. He admitted that he had missed this. She was a great hugger but not a lot of people had the privilege to know that. Blaise was standing awkwardly next to her. When she finally let go, Draco went to shake Blaise's hand but instead, Blaise hugged him too. That was a first.
Harry closed his eyes for a second like he was trying to remember the different rooms in the House and their habitants.
Harry was standing in the long and dark hallway in silence, waiting for something. When he realized that nothing was happening, he started to look around him. Draco could see the tension of his shoulders and the way his wand was raised in front of him, enlightening the hallway thanks to the Lumos charm.
Feeling pity for Harry was strange and unnatural after so many years of hating each other. But the more he knew about the past, the more he learnt about Harry’s life, the more he realized how little he knew and how wrong everything he assumed was.
“I stopped after Hermione and Ron told me that it was getting too much. But I noticed that you would eat that dessert often, and I- I mean that’s it.”
“I- I didn’t. We were rivals. It was different” explained Harry but Draco could see his cheeks getting flushed.
The attic was big but not really furnished. They still spend a lot of time cleaning and getting rid of dead bugs and other creatures. Once they were finally done, Draco noticed how Harry was standing awkwardly, looking at the room.
They hadn’t closed the curtains so the sun woke them up. Draco sat down, frowning because of the bright light.
“But one of us still would need to be with you to watch over you and make sure you won’t hurt yourself.” She added more for herself.
“What were you looking at when … you know,” asked Draco putting his empty pizza box aside. He didn’t know if he was right to ask, but their game of questions was over, and he was just curious now.
They ate in silence even though Draco wanted to ask about Regulus. He only knew that it was Sirius’s younger brother and he had figured that he was dead. He wanted to know more but he could see it on Harry’s face that it wasn’t the right time. When they went back upstairs, Harry looked almost sick and Draco knew he had to say something.
Draco went down and was joined a few minutes later by Harry who sat down at the table, watching him cook. Draco was making mac’ and cheese, not really inspired to try something fancy. Once it was done he gave a plate to Harry and somehow it felt like they were back to square one having the silent meal that Draco had made, both too scared and in pain to say anything.
Draco knew better than to take Harry’s remark personally. He went to Harry and tried to take a look at his hands that were shaking.
Draco was once again speechless because he had never imagined this past for the Boy Who Lived. He knew he was raised by Muggles but the thought of a small Harry being raised like a nobody, not even worthy of love, was sickening. Harry waited, almost defying Draco to say something but he couldn’t.
Honestly, he just wanted to leave but he knew that he wouldn’t be free before this matter what solved.
Draco got his things, ready to leave but he was conflicted because he could see that Harry was still hurting.
“What about us?” he asked looking up to see Harry’s face. Draco was laying down, his head on Harry’s legs.
Draco didn’t answer, leaving Harry to start cleaning alone. A few minutes passed and Draco could feel Harry getting more and more annoyed. Finally, he heard a loud sigh and Harry was now standing next to him.
Draco nodded before looking away. Harry suddenly stood up and left the room. Draco had just ruined everything, and he felt stupid. He should have known that Harry was still not ready. That was until Harry came back in the room, a piece of parchment in his hand. He sat next to Draco and he gave him the parchment.
It wasn’t a question but an affirmation. Harry’s stare made Draco uncomfortable, especially since he wasn’t moving.
The next two days, they both spend the time separately, Draco was trying to find solutions for the portrait and enjoying some time with his mother, while Harry continued to clean the house.
Harry was now standing very close to Draco and his teeth were so clenched that Draco expected them to break at any point.
Before Harry could say anything, Draco went to the piano and started to play “Wiegenlied” from Brahms. Harry looked at Draco with that strange gaze and he smiled widely before laying down on the couch. Draco played for a while until it was completely dark outside. Harry was sleeping peacefully when Draco stopped. Draco went to grab his things when suddenly Harry turned his head.
Part of him thought that the sensible thing to do next was to disapparate home; it wasn’t as if the wards here were especially effective against him. But he didn’t. He sat down, instead, and calmly reached for his glass.
Hermione nodded slowly. The thought of Harry having kept something from them hurt her physically, but it was possible.
Draco pretended to be embarrassed, and nodded, and Auror Lisbon laughed. “Can’t blame you, mate. No one could.”
The day felt unbelievably long. Unfathomably. Harry gave up on his wand-making pursuits before lunch, knowing full well his energy was too scattered to really understand what the raw materials were trying to tell him. But the shop was quiet, and all Harry could really do was try to read, and listen — hard — to his rooms above the shop, wondering if Draco would come down when he was ready to talk, or if he’d climb out a window and disappear again. Or if he might be upstairs waiting for Harry just as Harry was downstairs waiting for him.
“Probably eight years,” he said. “I was sure this was what I wanted. I truly was. I worked hard for it, and I know my defensive magic better than anyone else on the team —”
“Fuck you,” Harry said, panting, and his eyes rolled back in his head as Draco slipped the finger into his tight hole.
He watched as she stepped out into the cold street, buttoning the top of her robe and plucking her gloves from her pockets to slip them back on.
The hourglass trilled too soon. Harry looked up, seeming as startled as Draco was, and with some reluctance stood up to add the final ingredient. He didn’t even wait until Draco was watching. Perhaps he wasn’t rubbish at potions anymore. Perhaps Draco had unnecessarily helped the first time. Perhaps —
She sighed. “I would like very much for you to start calling me Narcissa, but I have long since stopped believing in miracles.” She was silent for a while, leading Harry into store after store and finding nothing that interested her. Harry purchased gifts for the Weasleys, and Hermione, for Teddy and Andromeda.
Nothing happened, for several long moments. Probably, wars were fought and lost in that time. Continents shifted. Hearts broke and were mended and then broke again. Draco let himself sob. Trying to stop it would be a waste of effort, he reasoned, and then he sensed Harry closer. Crouching directly in front of him.
It was, of course, a singularly dreadful item of clothing. Draco didn’t know why one might smash a pumpkin or why the commemoration of such might be worth a t-shirt, but he dragged it over his head. He gazed at himself in the mirror for a long moment. Respectable trousers, travesty of a shirt; seemed appropriate.
“Are you sure?” Hermione asked. “I mean — you can’t really be sure, can you? He seemed so different. I keep thinking of him sitting on your couch with that deer-in-headlights look, wearing your cardigan…”
It wasn’t a simple question to ask. Madam Shacklebolt had been the head of the Auror Office when Harry had arrived as a first-year apprentice, at nineteen, after belatedly completing his N.E.W.Ts as an eighth-year student at Hogwarts. Two years later he’d been a Junior Auror; and now…
The entire thing had been foolish. Harry Potter was not a suitable partner by any stretch of the imagination — just
“Have I passed? Do you think I’m okay?” He tried to keep his tired amusement off his face, but he failed.
Pansy narrowed her eyes again. She was probably trying to look cross, but only succeeded in looking worried. “How convenient.” She huffed, and then her expression softened. “Or not. Harry, did he…
He narrowed his eyes, then, though, looking around the room. Had he forgotten where he was? And then those same stormy grey eyes darkened in worry. He even tried to sit up, which was patently ridiculous.
At school, though Harry had barely known Blaise except to see him, he had always held a smug expression; one-quarter Veela, as they said, always draped in attractive prospects, generally difficult to pin down by all accounts. But smug is not the same thing as confident, and Harry knew the difference.
“Yes,” he said. He took the first stair, and then the second, his feet getting heavier. He turned around. Harry was still staring at him.
Ron squawked; he was getting a little tired of the way everyone assumed he would just do whatever Hermione thought was right. However, since Molly had elbowed in on the issue as well, he looked ready to concede defeat.
“This is humiliating,” he said, as he wiped the tears from his face. “I knew this would be impossibly hard, but I didn’t… I mean, it’s
“I’d pay a million Galleons to know you cried my name out when you were done,” Harry growled, smiling wolfishly. “Loud enough so all the other Slytherins wanted to beat themselves unconscious.”
“I’ve been invited to Malfoy Manor for Christmas Eve,” Harry said, awkwardly. “But I’ll be back the next day. Or, no, I’ll be back that night, of course. By Floo.”
“It will be okay,” he said, reaching out to brush his fingers over Draco’s wrist. To his surprise Draco took his hand, and nodded, stepping into the Floo with Harry as Harry called out “The Burrow.”
“But that’s all PR nonsense. I used to be friends with one of the most famous opera singers in Italy, you know. She was a
Potter looked very much like someone had slipped a drop or two of Draught of Living Death into his Earl Grey.
“You only need to try,” Draco said gently. “You need to start somewhere. If you feel ill, don’t finish. But you need to get your strength up, since, you know, you are feeling
Daring, he raised a hand to press against Harry’s shoulder, and run it down over his spine. He’d lost some weight. Not as much as he might have without the stasis spells but it would be a little while before he was at fighting weight. Time. Only time, good food, exercise — the fun kind, ideally, chasing a Crup by the ocean, pointless and excessively competitive broomstick flying (preferably with a superbly skilled rival Seeker, and a practice snitch), rather than chasing Dark Wizards down dark alleys and getting hexed in the face.
Blaise shook his head, and took a few steps forward. “No. But the house was sick. Draco wasn’t sure she even wanted to recover, and he sure as shit wasn’t going to force her to survive. She stood for almost a thousand years. Growing, evolving — she was tired.”
But he’d always been busy, and he’d never failed to make time for himself. Because making time for himself had always been easy; out dancing and drinking with his friends, making quiet bets with himself about whether or not he would end up sleeping with Luc again. Eating rich food and enduring quiet debates with himself about how much he could drink based on how much time he might have to spend in meditation in the days that followed, how much time he might have to spend slipping unobserved into his patients’ dreams (they didn’t all need that, but those who did — they
“Thanks for coming,” Luna said, as if he’d actually been invited and this had been planned. Or at least, as if he’d been expected. Perhaps he had been. “Bye, Harry.”
“No, stop,” he said, with a smile. “There is something I want everyone to understand. I did die. As I say; I died. I died, but not for long. I didn’t fake my death. I came back. And because of that death, I was able to conquer Tom Riddle forever. Some of you don’t want to think about this. You don’t want to think about the fact that Dumbledore, who so many of you have loved for so long, could orchestrate a plot that he knew would end in my death. But tell me; what could you have done differently? Do you sacrifice one to save many, or do you risk many to save one? I need you all to hear this,” Harry said, sternly. He leaned into the lectern.
Harry cringed, and explained, as he wandlessly levitated the pot and the cups to the table, searching for a plate for a couple of biscuits. “So I need a new wand, and it needs to be… I don’t know. Better suited to me, I suppose. I don’t know why it’s been so difficult. Since my first one broke…”
“I won’t be your long weekend, Harry,” he said, quietly. Might have been a better note to start on. “I won’t be your winter fling. You should know that. There was a reason I invited you to a courting dance, and it has nothing to do with waking up to a wet patch on the bed and a thank you note scribbled on a piece of parchment.”
“I don’t mind at all,” Harry said, wrapping a hand around the back of Draco’s neck to pull him down into a kiss.
And now Harry was back at Hogwarts again — after years where the nightmares only came every few months — and they were back in full force. Arrangements had been made to release any ghosts that wanted to go; Harry had been surprised at the time that Nearly Headless Nick and Peeves had gone onto whatever was next. Rowena Ravenclaw tended to stay out of the way, and Harry had barely seen her a half dozen times in all of his years at Hogwarts. There were two new child ghosts that Harry couldn’t even bear to think about; they seemed to hover near the kitchens as if hoping for an extra cauldron cake or a mug of Butterbeer, and Harry wasn’t entirely sure they knew they were dead.
It was an interesting revelation, actually. Certainly nothing he would have ever learned from his mother. She was intelligent, certainly, but she made decisions moment to moment, and Blaise didn’t think he had ever caught her in anything like a contemplative moment.
. I don’t know how long we spent there, watching Sirius disappear through the veil, over and over again.”
have to find something to do with my time, or I’ll turn into some weird old hermit. Not yet; in a year or two. Not a sodding clue what that might be, but if your life is here, then so is mine.” He held Draco’s gaze as he said it. Determined that there would not be any doubt between them. If this ended — if this didn’t even begin — it would be Draco’s decision, not Harry’s. He took Draco’s hand in his own. “I haven’t been so sure about anything since I was a kid.”
“— My son is not an easy man to love. Nor was his father. But I loved him. Even when he was terribly wrong, I loved him. I wanted to leave, once — I believed the Dark Lord was…”
Draco didn’t phrase it like a question, but Harry nodded anyway. He felt slightly better when Draco pressed a warm kiss against his mouth.
“This never happened. It didn’t make a difference. Dumbledore died. So many people died. Some fucking hero. I’m tired, Draco. I’m just…”
mean-spirited and insecure and who have family shrubs full of cruelty and madness. You had…” Draco swallowed hard. “Wonderful friends at school. So why him?”
“I’ll be downstairs if you need me,” he said, gently. “There’s fresh towels and clean clothes in the bathroom, if you want to take a bath. I have to open the shop again.”
Harry had felt his own anxiety ramping up with every moment that passed. Malfoy handed him the final envelope. “Could you please hand deliver this to Kingsley Shacklebolt, Potter? It’s not sealed.”
After a little while, Draco sat beside him carefully, and reached for a bowl, spooning a little of everything into it.
He wondered if there might be a future in which he didn’t have to think about it, in which people would just let him be. Students got used to him eventually because he was stern when he needed to be, a barrel of laughs when so moved, and so frustratingly normal the rest of the time — whatever ’normal’ meant these days — and because he refused point blank to discuss the war.
From inside the Burrow there was a loud crash and raised voices, and all three of them flinched. Family or not there had been too many months now of close quarters, frayed nerves and quick tempers.
Mrs Malfoy turned to gaze on her husband’s portrait, hanging on the wall. He looked desperately sad, Harry noticed. As if he was listening to her speak, and felt such regret. Harry fancied his hand lifted slightly, as if to reach out, before he turned away, leaving only a sheet of white hair and the hint of a shoulder behind.
In the moments he had for reflection, he was glad that every time he stepped into Harry Potter’s spectacularly fucked-up head he had experienced the same shoulder dislocation, because even though it wasn’t real, and wasn’t his own memory, it hurt like fuck and Draco’s belief that responding would hurt Harry more than it hurt him meant that he was able to keep himself silent. Through the dislocated shoulder, the smack to the back of the head that made him see stars, the slaps to the back of the thighs. And he was being tossed into what he had first thought was a nursery, but turned out to be something significantly smaller.
Ellie and Harry were fast friends after that. She also had a glare that would settle anyone who wanted to come and make a fuss over Harry. It was of the Molly Weasley school of glaring and it was very, very effective.
Draco nodded slowly. He shifted his body language and leaned back in his chair. “Merlin. Dragons. That does sound like fun.”
. And something of an expert in the dark arts and defence thereof. If you think I can’t sniff out a love potion under a couple of layers of tissue paper and cellophane…”
Draco supposed it probably was. Humiliating, and hard. And he knew it would be insulting to offer Harry a chance to bow out. So. “You got this far, though. You might as well finish.”
Within a few minutes of the entire clan stumbling slightly drunk through the Floo, the doorbell began to ring. Neville and Luna, and the Patil twins; a handful of Ron’s friends from Auror training. A few friends of friends. The liquor flowed freely and they stuffed themselves with snacks, every last one of them, promising that the New Year — no, the new century, the new millennium — would bring with it powerful new promises to defy the call of deep-fried carbohydrates. Blaise Zabini appeared with a couple of other very nervous-looking Slytherins in tow, expansive and cheerful, shaking everyone’s hands, being unnecessarily tall, and telling everyone who he met that he was at school with Hermione and that he’d never in his life understand why she hadn’t been sorted into Ravenclaw.
Harry held his breath, and then forced himself to behave like a fucking adult. He slipped his hands into his pockets so he wouldn’t fidget. Draco looked as if he was struggling with something and Harry had made the last few weeks difficult enough.
Harry wordlessly conjured some lube on his fingers, and nudged Draco’s thigh; he seemed to get the picture very quickly, and threw one long leg over Harry’s shoulder, angling his hips just slightly so that Harry could get at his tight little hole.
a genius, Granger,” he said, conjuring his boyhood spite over their competitions for the highest marks. “And if I hadn’t made any progress at all, I can assure you I wouldn’t be here looking for even more clues. Do try
He wasn’t altogether surprised to find Narcissa Malfoy waiting for him on the front step, dressed in an almost silver fur coat, and with a pale blue shawl draped over her head and shoulders. The wards probably started a good distance from the Manor, for safety’s sake. She ushered Harry inside, and led him into not the formal living room but the
“Come for me, Harry,” he growled into Harry’s ear. “Fill me up. Let me feel it. Let me see your face when you come, you smug Gryffindor git. I’ve been waiting to see it long enough.” He gripped Harry’s hair tightly and pulled his head back so he could watch his expression.
“Apparently you’ve been paying close attention to what happens in the DMLE,” Harry said, with a smile. “I would think you had a lot more to concern yourself with, Minister.”
Draco blanched, and tore his eyes from the water and its unrest. He stared at the knots in the wood instead, and he thought. Harry lived in England; Draco lived in Italy. They had their lives. Their jobs. Draco needed to keep unlocking the secrets of the mind and Harry needed to keep England safe, the wanker. They could never work.
Tosser or not, Potter had led a pretty sodding miserable life. This didn’t seem like a very fair way for it to end.
been a full life. But there were days when Harry looked at him and saw him not in the shop but hunched on the ground in the Malfoy Manor dungeons, already looking like a ghost. Or in his bedroom at Shell Cottage with his hands shaking as he held a mug of tea, trying to warm himself up. The war had taken a lot from him.
“Please,” Harry said. “I just. I want to understand. We feuded for years. I almost killed you in Sixth Year, with that fucking awful curse. I don’t understand. I really don’t. And I hear you, I do, I hear what you’re saying, but you’re wrong. I
“Mrs Anand,” he said, with a smile. “You are a vision, as usual.” Resplendent in a very bright purple sari. “How is the book going?”
“Sneaky,” Harry agreed. And then he leaned in, and took Draco’s hands. He was gentle, but firm; he was certain, and the his power thrummed around him again, so strong and warm and beautiful that it made Draco’s chest ache. Harry held his gaze as his large, calloused hands covered both of Draco’s. He closed his eyes for a moment when he lifted Draco’s hands to his lips, and kissed them. Knuckles, and then fingers, and then the backs of his hands, as if he was something incredibly precious.
Lunch could have been a lot more awkward, Harry supposed. Ron, Hermione and Ginny all put in an effort, Ginny quietly goading Draco, speculating about his obvious escape into witness protection (“If that was the case, Weasley, I’d hardly tell you.”). How he’d escaped indentured servitude in the Department of Mysteries (“Don’t you know there’s a vow that makes people’s tongues fall out if they speak of such things?”). Ron and Hermione took over the cooking, and Harry had the very important tasks of hovering, fussing, and worrying.
But he stayed silent through his robe fitting, and tried not to smile at himself in the mirror (really, he looked
Eight sharp, Harry brought a light supper of finger sandwiches from the kitchen. Draco appreciated it. He hadn’t had the energy to head up to the Great Hall, even after a few hours of sleep, and he had missed lunch. And though his arms and face looked somewhat better, he hadn’t wanted Amelia to see him again until he was properly healed.
“Not so fast. I’m missing one piece of information.” Well, that was far from true; there were so many holes in this story that Potter might have actually fallen through one. “How was he found?”
“Thank you for your help,” Draco said, standing and reaching for his satchel. “I think I’ve been away from Auror Potter for long enough.”
When the hour passed, the hourglass trilling a sweet tune, Potter blinked awake; suddenly alarmed to have dropped his guard around Draco. Draco closed his book and moved back to the bench.
That night, Harry stretched out in his bed and scratched Dora’s very small, and currently colourful, head. Pretty little thing. She shone when she was happy.
Hermione wished that she could say she thought it might be true, but she didn’t. “He… doesn’t have time,” she said. As the weeks went by, she was beginning to see how complicated and ugly this was. How wretched. And she was beginning to see how it was not just possible, but likely, that almost everyone in Harry’s life had some culpability in what had happened here, even if she still didn’t understand quite what was happening. “I don’t think he has time.”
Hermione sat at Harry’s bedside. It was something of a relief. After weeks of sitting with him every night, every chance she had to see him, and watch the rise and fall of his chest, felt like a privilege. A glance at home.
No one else ever got to see Draco like this, with all his corners buffed out. This was only for Harry.
“I feel like such a mean old grown-up chasing them away,” he mourned. “Do that Quidditch whistle of yours. We’ll get them all heading back to the castle.”
“I need to take steps to get him out of there. I have perhaps two or three courses of action, but only one which I think is… safe. Or near safe.”
Over Draco’s life, he’d often heard people describe therapy — particularly those rare and terrible moments of clarity — as painful. Yes, this was it. A moment of clarity forced into his psyche. Harry Potter wasn’t the only man who would be changed by this.
Hermione didn’t want to bring Parvati this time. She wanted no secrets, and that meant only Blaise and herself. But Parvati wouldn’t be swayed and Blaise was even more immovable on the subject. Hermione couldn’t deny that she had been running herself ragged, and as much as she found it difficult to believe that anything would happen to her at a tiny Wizard hospital in Naples she wasn’t prepared to spend any more time arguing with either one of them. She had waited two whole days to receive word from Draco that she could come and visit; she wasn’t waiting any longer.
“Oh, I didn’t mean you,” Harry said, hand on his heart, eyes wide. And then: “Six inches? I hadn’t taken you for a modest one, Draco.”
“And efficient.” Harry moved to cover Draco’s body with his own, slotting their cocks together beautifully, desperate to just rut against something. “You’re so fucking beautiful, Draco. I just want to look at you.”
Draco flashed an expression that brought to mind a much younger Draco battling his desire to preen. He sipped from his water glass, and dabbed at his mouth with a napkin.
When it was dark and arrangements had been made for his interment, Ollivander’s son, who had to be in his eighties himself, told Harry that the shop now belonged to him. He wouldn’t be drawn into an argument about it, either. None of them would; as Ollivander’s apprentice — though Harry supposed he wasn’t an apprentice anymore — she shop was his. If any of them had shown the inclination, it would have passed to them.
“That’s not what I mean, and you know it,” Harry replied, sounding almost prim. “I’m betting there’s some sort of Pureblood nonsense I should know about. You know I have no idea about —
“Fancy,” she said, her tone unimpressed, but her expression fond and her eyes soft. “I would say that you have recovered… probably ninety percent of your magical function, at this point. The rest might return slowly, but if not, you’ll have to deal with only being on the top four or five strongest Witches and Wizards in the world instead of being an insufferably definite number one.”
“Fuck you, Black,” he said, in a tone that straddled the line between playful and righteously pissed off. But he was gone in a flash of green flames, and Draco re-set his wards. For the foreseeable future, no one would be coming through without a specific invitation. He returned to Harry’s bedside.
“It’s enough,” Draco said. “I don’t care, I’m not waiting anymore. I’ve waited more than two decades. It’s enough. Need you to fuck me deep, Harry,” he said, making as if to roll over onto his hands and knees, but the thought of not being able to see his face had Harry feeling mildly panicky.
He signed some autographs, his face hot and his voice strangled, starting to feel claustrophobic as the group around him got bigger, and he hoped he wouldn’t hear the next day in the Prophet that he’d been rude to them when he eventually made a hasty escape. Merlin, it was embarrassing. And it was hard to reason with people. They saw him a particular way, and he couldn’t begrudge them that; he only wished it wasn’t so very, very different to the way he saw himself. And he wished that he was allowed to mourn in his own way, without people telling him he must be
But Draco had been transported to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry many, many times. And the other secret platforms as well. And he knew that sometimes, a solid was not a solid, and that all he needed to step through was that knowledge.
In his head, the people Draco had attended school with had never aged a day. He’d puzzled over it more than once — the day that he’d bumped into Millicent Bulstrode in London, he’d taken at least five minutes to reconcile the woman in front of him with her clear skin and her fashionable up-do with the girl he’d first met almost twenty years ago. He’d searched her features for familiarity and conceded there wasn’t a great deal there, save the hollow-eyed look of so many of them who had survived the war.
“Of course, Neville,” Draco said, cordially. “Just don’t forget to RSVP.” And then he stood up, and left. With a plate of fruit left to eat — and Draco loved fruit, Harry had found himself mildly amused by it, the sweet cravings Draco had even when it wasn’t truly dessert.
Draco ran his fingers through his hair, and stifled a yawn; he glanced at the clock and found it was still too early for him to sleep well, creature of habit that he was. But the book in his lap was getting impossible to read, the letters swimming and wriggling in front of his eyes. He took his readings glasses off, folded them neatly and placed them on the side table.
Harry took Draco’s hand, and Andromeda linked elbows with him, as they began the walk back to the apparition point.
Harry had long since given up trying to guess how old people were. The more powerful seemed to age incredibly slowly. If Madam Shacklebolt had told him she was a hundred years old, despite the barest hint of crows feet at her eyes Harry would not have batted an eyelid.
and so you know you’re not getting something for nothing. I know you, Harry Potter, and you might not think that way now but in a few years —”
Also, he had been practising charms that could make him appear to be ill, because the weekend of the dreaded Malfoy party was upon him, speeding towards him. November 1
“Potter, I handed the title over to the Ministry. I hardly expected them to turn it into a museum honouring my illustrious family’s contributions to Wizarding society.”
Funny thing about doing that, though. Harry still hated the way people would rush up to him in the street and ask to shake his hand, offer their daughters in marriage, ask for an autograph or a photograph. But he hated casting a Glamour, because it implied that he was expecting it.
“No, most of us learned shortly after we had mastered walking,” Draco said coolly, stepping closer. “You’re upset.”
Hermione drew her wand, and Harry clenched his teeth — Episkey was as painful as the nose breaking in the first place, but afterwards, Hermione cooled his overheated face with a quick charm and he felt a little bit better. Ron looked delighted, hanging over the back of the couch.
Wandless magic was never as precise as magic with a wand, but it could be much more powerful. And Harry didn’t really like to talk about it too much, knowing how Hermione could worry; but sometimes, he didn’t need to know the words, or even if something was possible. He just needed the intention, and enough mental space to
Moments later she came through and held Harry tight. He didn’t cry. He felt as if he should, but he didn’t. Maybe it would happen later, or maybe he was just done crying when people died; there had been such a lot of it, after all.
“We should get Ron and Hermione around for lunch,” Draco said, as he Summoned a couple of pans from the cupboard.
“It works,” she said, with a fond smile on her face. “In another year or two he’ll leave the department and we can go public. Not yet. Too much is fragile, right now, and people are starting to talk about Harry. His…
All four of them laughed as a family of bright pink, yellow and green birds took off from the trees. It looked like fireworks. Luna climbed onto Grayson’s lap and watched while the rest of the ice cream melted, their cooling charms forgotten in the beauty of the spectacle.
“You called me Draco,” Malfoy said, and Harry felt his face flush. Malfoy opened his eyes. “What time is it?”
Moments later Harry handed her a branch with five satisfyingly glossy green leaves, which began to sprout flowers as soon as she took it.
“I’m afraid, Hermione,” Draco said, and that was the most startling thing she had ever heard him say. “He’s getting physically weaker, and it’s getting harder to reach him. I push, we find a way through a memory, and then I start rebuilding his trust again — until I fucking betray him,
“Don’t pretend you can’t simply flit through my wards,” he said, feigning boredom. Mostly because Draco was feigning it equally poorly as he leaned against the doorjamb.
“D’you think we’ll ever be alright?” Harry asked, quietly, hypnotised by the flames in the fireplace, the way he sometimes was.
With a burst of desperate humiliation and precise intention he was back in his too well-decorated chamber almost before Draco could register that he had left. He sat on the edge of his bed for a long time, fighting the urge to punch himself in the face.
“I must take my leave. Draco, darling, I have some papers for you to sign — will you take supper with me this week at the Manor — perhaps Wednesday? Eight o’clock?”
. But he hadn’t bet on finding Ron and Hermione watching television and drinking, either. He cursed himself for not having apparated to his own bedroom directly but Hermione was already off the couch and examining his face before he had a chance to say anything so much as ‘How was the movie?’
“What you’ll learn is that children are exhausting. So go home, Harry,” Ollivander said, patting his shoulder. His hand felt frail, too light, as if his body was clinging to his spirit instead of the other way around. “Take a couple of days and come back on Friday. And don’t forget to lock the door.”
me. And I don’t read well.” He flushed. “I don’t, and I read slowly, and for a long time it felt like the letters would change and flip about when I looked at them, but… I loved magic. I
And then he smiled, and he looked like Harry Potter; and she smiled, and she felt like Hermione Granger.
And every time they moved, their shoulders would brush, or their legs, and once Harry caught Draco’s ankle with his own and gave him such a heated look of
