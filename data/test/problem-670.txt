"Fuck, not like that, you freak!" He yelled a few seconds later, recoiling in horror as Harry responded by properly biting his lip.
The Malfoys had arrived together, a powerful and intimidating trio, all identically well bred and beautiful and deadly. Malfoy looked better, Harry realised, better than he'd seen him in two years. The misery and terror was evident on his face, but under the expression he looked less gaunt, more whole.
Harry pretended to think about it, though it was a struggle to act casual when his mind was being slowly blown.
Draco ignored her, slamming hard into the next bookshelf so hard he yelled with pain; it teetered in place before toppling right over and sending damaged books in a tidal wave over the ground. Then he lunged for a vase of carnations on a nearby desk and sent them smashing down to the floor, laughing maniacally at the damage.
She loosened the cap on Potter and Granger's bottle for a little sniff as she crept back to her own desk, and smiled. It was heavenly: sweet but not cloying, with notes of roasting coffee and dark chocolate. This was good shit!
"I'm sorry, ok?! I couldn't help it! That was hands-free!" he protested when he was done, casting the quickest Cleaning Charm of his life over the bed and himself, and pulling his robe on in a hurry to leave.
And around the hand's crooked little finger, beneath the signet ring, was sketched a tiny body.
Hermione still looked doubtful. He sighed, ripped the page up, and tossed it into the bin.
Then the morning came, and it brought with it a wave of hard feelings.
"I'm so sorry, Harry," he'd mumbled, hands fumbling hard to slip his joggers fully up over his hips again.
"I will when you stop pretending you haven't!" she sneered before storming off, leaving the three of them lost for words.
But his thirst was overwhelming, he craved the contents of the bottle in his father's grasp more than he needed oxygen, and in the end he couldn't stop himself from reaching his left hand out for it.
"Might as well be," Draco sighed. "Thanks to Peeves, all the kids think we're together already so it'll be all round the school on the first day back anyway. Everyone's gonna be heartbroken that they can't date me."
"There's a good boy," he breathed in Harry's ear as the pace picked up.
"I just wondered why you looked so upset, that was all," Malfoy replied innocently. "Were you thinking about how you aren't on the Quidditch team any more, which is hilarious, or was it about how you're going to die alone because no one will ever fancy you back, which is funnier?"
"Do you think that would work?" he whispered, mind racing.
"Fine," Draco grinned. "I just hope you're a cheaper date than me."
"I could make your life look like this without ecstasy. If you wanted."
Harry gasped. "Oh my God, that's it! That's it, Hermione!"
The boys stared straight ahead in embarrassment as they walked up the street, each extremely conscious of the clasped hands between them.
"Er, true," Harry nodded. "It would be referred to as an unbound planet, orphan planet, wandering planet, starless planet, or sunless planet. It's not very common, though, and it means the planet has been ejected from the planetary system."
Harry didn't know what to say to that, but he watched the Slytherins traipse off quietly to their dorms, then steeled himself to bear Malfoy's weight to Madam Pomfrey.
"I guess you can sleep here," she'd whispered when he'd appeared by her bedside in tears. "But don't expect anything nice from me. And don't think this means I forgive you."
"I don't doubt it," Harry rolled his eyes. "Imagine you not having the best of something."
He paused, and licked his lips.
"Do you feel better now?" he asked sweetly.
As Harry leaned closer he realised that this rendition of the Mark looked quite humanlike, and then he saw the silver eyes gleamed out of the soulless mess of bones that counted for a face -
"I don't know it but can you let this one slide?" he asked in Parseltongue. The snake looked surprised, as far as a snake can ever look surprised, and willingly swung back to allow his entrance.
Draco's slender fingers laced over the parcel on his knees, pulling the brown paper off with surprising gentleness. Harry forced himself to watch, though he found it immensely embarrassing to give presents to people and receive their thanks.
"I just want to stop seeing everything," he whispered to himself tearfully. "Because maybe then I wouldn't have to see what they did to my arm-"
Malfoy paused. He wondered if he should tell Harry the truth.
"I know," Harry reassured him. He made his eyes pleading. "Can you just come with me, though? I'm really fucking cold and it's really fucking late and I'm going to lose my temper with you in a huge way if you carry on playing Angelina fucking Ballerina while I stand here."
"Come in!" Harry gasped, spluttering a little as he bobbed around in the water. "It's lovely and warm!"
"Take your clothes off," Malfoy said as soon as they were through the dormitory door, making no effort to keep his voice down. Then again, louder, "Get your cock out."
"How?" Potter asked suspiciously, brushing Draco's grip off his robes and taking a cautious step away to lean heavily on the wall across from him.
Their bodies moved much in the way that a wave does, in cascades of pleasure and elation, and for a time all the love on the planet existed between the two souls on Draco Malfoy's bedsheets.
Harry cast his robe off willingly, and his shirt as an afterthought, draping both over Malfoy's ice-cold frame. Theo and Blaise followed suit, shivering, as did several other Slytherins, and soon he was swaddled like a child.
"I'm going to have to start being more obnoxious to him," Draco decided, talking more to himself than to the girl. "He deserves to suffer a lot more than he is."
"What the bloody hell was that for, you creep?" Harry snapped the second the boys were out of the classroom.
"Blaise, take any pills or powder from his pockets," Harry suggested tiredly as he heaved his love up the steps.
he berated himself), it was enough to be near him in this light. Enough to be treated kindly again.
His hands shaking, Harry had cast a Silencing Charm at the door, then turned over and went to sleep. "He's not my problem any more," he insisted to himself. "I don't owe him anything. I did the best that I could to save him from himself. He's not my problem any more."
"Oh, so you can eye-fuck yourself in the mirror for as long as you want and that's fine, but whenever I do it I'm being 'creepy' and 'gay'," Draco sulked.
Harry's athletic supporter was digging into Draco through his Quidditch pants, and it was cold and muddy and windy but Draco was beyond caring. He was kissing Harry fucking Potter.
"Ok, fine, so you care what everyone thinks. And everyone knows, do they?"
"Last time he bit him till he bled, and then laughed about his dead parents. I don't think he could do any worse," Ron pointed out.
It was oddly peaceful out there in the bleak little gravel park, even with the slight smell of smoke and the dark rainclouds overhead.
Even the scent of his fabric softener and broom polish were recognisable in there.
Harry swallowed again. He knew Draco was hating every second of this. "Draco Malfoy is the most extraordinary person I have ever met in my entire life," he said honestly. "I have seen more kindness and affection from him in the past year than ever from my own family-"
I'm not his servant, Draco thought to protest, but then he felt another invisible tug from the core of his arm, felt the serpent writhe on the surface of his skin. The Mark said otherwise.
He didn't trust himself to get up without tearing after Potter and punching his smug fucking face in, or banging his own head against the wall in frustration.
Harry shoved his feet into the previous night's socks and buckled up his belt as he half ran for the door, burning up with embarrassment as he did so. Why did this shit always happen to him?
"That's interesting. Because I've done that dozens of times, Potter, and you really weren't anything unusual. You want me to stay, if there's a next time? And you want me to mean it?"
He pulled out a report from his briefcase, and smoothed it flat on the stand. "We also had a report drawn on the spells performed by my client's wand in the past six months - you'll see there are zero instances of Unforgivable Curses on the list, and nothing stronger than a
Harry pushed his hips hard against Malfoy's and grinned. "You don't appear to be suffering..."
"Why is it that you always have to be sopping wet when I kiss you, hmm?" Draco laughed.
He allowed himself to look fully into the hurt on Draco's face, feel the other boy's emotions mixed in with his own.
A pause; solid and earth-shattering.
"But it's
Malfoy turned to look up at him, something hopeful flickering in his grey eyes, a look that Harry hadn't seen there before. The Slytherins were staring too; it seemed the fascination with the pair of them hadn't faded much over time.
The sweat and light rain soaking through Harry's shirt made it cling tightly to his figure and every time he moved, Draco could see his abdominal muscles working furiously. Occasionally he'd decide to do a cute little spin trick, and every time he flipped over his shirt would slide up so Draco got a glimpse of Harry's stomach, soaking wet and pressed flat again his broom. He felt like he was going to swallow his tongue.
Harry sighed. "He's good at that."
Harry wasn't sure at what point the Slytherin's name had gone from Draco back to Malfoy again in his head, but he knew he preferred Draco.
"In the end you were right," he said, "I do ruin everything. And maybe now you can have a peaceful couple of years at Hogwarts without me to wind you up every day."
But he didn't even look for the robes.
When they were ready to take it further, Draco stayed chest-to-chest with Harry the whole time instead of just forcing the boy's head down or his hips up like normal, and for this Harry was grateful.
No one made a response; the judge motioned for him to carry on. He could feel Mallory staring at him approvingly.
Harry lurched forwards with the shock of waking up, adrenaline tearing his nerves to shreds.
"Wouldn't it be funny," she whispered to Blaise, holding back a giggle, "If we spiced up tomorrow's Potions class with a little ..... chemistry, shall we say ..... between Potter and Draco?"
Potter's own hands were busy raking through his dark hair, causing it to stand up in patches in a rather post-coital manner. "And you knew about this, did you?!" he seethed.
"No, I think I am going to read it, thanks, since you're both so concerned," Draco insisted with an unkind smile, and with that, he began scanning the paper until the smile fell well and truly to the floor.
"Don't give up on me," Malfoy choked, and Harry realised with horror that he was suddenly crying. "I'm better, I'm getting better, I promise."
He shuddered. There was an anxious knot in his stomach and it tightened as he got himself ready for the day, as if his body was fighting for him to stay in his bed with the drapes shut, away from the rest of the school.
He got quite a bit of letter writing done that morning, letters to Ron, Hermione, Neville, Lupin, Molly Weasley, who had always been like the mother he never had, and even one to his ex girlfriend, Ron's sister Ginny. He didn't want her to feel left out.
"She's spirited," Ron offered after a second. "Gets it from Mum."
As the term slipped away towards Christmas it became somewhat of a habit for the two boys to hook up after the bi-weekly Quidditch practices and Harry looked forward to those days more than any others, though they were always his saddest days, too.
"I think I'm in love," he mumbled dazedly, before turning to run for his dorm. Once in there, he ripped off his uniform and stood and screamed for a while, before dragging on a pair of black skinny jeans and a dark red sweater. Perfect.
"How many times do I have to ask you to shut your fucking mouth?" Malfoy demanded, and Harry felt his breath catch in his throat and his entire stomach swivel over.
It threw him massively off his game, though. As Draco soared effortlessly around the pitch, Harry struggled to make a decent turn without wobbling off.
Draco nodded, his tongue feeling like lead in his mouth. Please don't make me do anything terrible, he mentally begged his parents. Please don't make me kill somebody. Nausea was still running high in his body, and he was terrified he'd humiliate himself and throw up on the floor at any second.
"Potter, I don't have long, stop playing fucking games!" Malfoy choked. "I'm- Potter, please-"
"Weaslette doesn't count," Malfoy said. Harry had no response.
Draco was insufferable enough as it was (even if he was also hot), and Harry didn't want to give him the satisfaction of agreeing with him, and validating his vanity.
"I was never obsessed-"
The image wasn't as unpleasant as he'd expected, just unfamiliar. But it didn't do anything special for him.
"Oh yeah, hadn't thought of that," said Harry sarcastically. "Oh wait, no - I
One glance at Blaise's firmly set lips made it clear he wasn't going to tell Malfoy what they'd just discussed, though, and Harry felt relieved. That was the last thing the other boy needed to hear, when it seemed he was doing so well.
"Pansy, let me use your textbook," Draco demanded, but was surprised by the speed with which his friend's textbook was whipped away from his grasp.
"Good boy, get that down you," he said. He sucked the lollipop hard into the hollows of his cheekbones again then let his jaw release to allow it to slide slowly over his tongue, revealing flashes of bright red that made the world spin faster.
"Can't believe what worked?" Draco asked absent-mindedly. His fingers carried on tracing over his bruise.
“He’s seriously overrated. He's actually kind of a dick to be honest, wouldn't waste your time on him."
That night in bed, Draco attempted to work out why he was so devastated by the revelation from Potions class.
"It's more about whether
Harry decided not to go straight to Ron and Hermione about Malfoy's wandering hands in that class - he might have understood the other boy's motives himself, but he knew they wouldn't, and it would be easier to keep it secret.
"I'm going, I'm fucking going, alright?"
His pretty silver eyes were so fixed on Harry's from under their long lashes that Harry began to feel literally sick with how badly he wanted to be near the other boy.
"I ... I have to go," Draco whispered. He wasn't sure if his words were audible over the crescendo of the rain, but he also wasn't sure he wanted Harry to hear them.
And the Slytherin onlookers in the stands only made it worse. Harry noticed they'd had different banners drawn up for this match to their usual kind, and most of the messages focused around the theme of Malfoy's "broom" and what they expected Harry would like to do with it.
throat again," he carried on after taking a useless swig from the bottle, and the class erupted into gasps and hysterical laughter.
Draco laughed again, and winked at Harry with a click of his tongue before walking away, leaving the other boy shuddering with rage.
"Trials?"
Harry didn't even hear him over the sound of his own panic.
They let him hit the peak of his high before performing the spells to Mark him.
Draco, meanwhile, was feeling pretty damn good.
"It is," Harry reassured him. "And you'll know. It'll be the day that hurting me hurts you more. Or the day you can say you love me and mean it. The day you find out what normal people do when they care about each other."
Sometimes at least he'd get warning a few hours in advance, like the time over dinner in the Great Hall where Malfoy had stuck his tongue out with the coloured tablet on it, taunting Harry like a child from across the tables.
"Seems more appropriate to be you," Malfoy smirked. "Future saviour of the Wizarding World might as well be my saviour too."
"If you think Pansy can do as good a job of you as I can, then by all means go and fuck your best friend," he continued hotly. "As you keep constantly reminding me, Malfoy, I'm not your boyfriend and I have no claim to you whatsoever. You're perfectly entitled to kiss whoever you like-"
"Of course he's high," she was saying. "When is he not?"
Ron and Hermione would be upset and confused when they realised he wasn't on the train, of course, but he knew they'd get over it. Anything would be better than burdening them the way he'd been trying not to for months now.
"Not like that, you sex pest! I meant breakfast! God, when are you ever not horny?"
he wondered.
"I can't
Draco preened.
Malfoy's eyes were wide, his breath loud. "Yeah," he gasped. "Can I-?"
"And I know why. I think you're obsessed with me, Malfoy, even more than I am with you. I think you genuinely love this shit."
Harry beamed back, clearly not listening. "Great dinner," he said, spearing another chip onto his laden fork and stuffing the lot into his mouth. "Really great," he mumbled again.
Harry shot his spells rapidly and with little thought, unable to keep his mind off the friends who were fighting beside him, but making sure all the time to aim his spells off to the left or the right of the family 50 feet ahead of him.
“Really, Draco. You are such a knob.”
The dark-haired boy shrugged, laying down his Quill. "It would be nice for me to sleep at night without worrying about you," he said quietly. "I like you better when you're like this, you're more you."
And as he watched his love leave an ache grew in his chest where his heart should be, and it was the worst pain he had ever felt.
"Two Butterbeers, please," Draco said, pressing a handful of change into the barmaid's hand as Harry chose their seats. "And a large fish and chips. Actually no, I'll have one as well, I'm hungry. Make that two fish and chips, please."
But it was challenging. He'd begun skipping breakfast following Malfoy's dramatic episode with all the blood in the Great Hall, which had created an image that had clearly stuck with him pretty vividly. He couldn't risk another display like that any time soon.
The blonde frowned, unhappy to have been taken away from his book. "Is it not enough that you both insist on whispering and giggling like children while I'm trying to read? Must you involve me too?"
The most terrifying thing of all was that Draco was beginning to almost like it too, in an angry, hungry sort of way.
"What was that for?" Harry panted.
Draco couldn't believe what he was hearing, glad Pansy and Blaise had dragged him down the corridor to hear it. Potter, attracted to him? Enough to smell him in his Amortentia?
He watched as Malfoy picked up his kit bag from the other side of his bed, glanced disdainfully down at Harry as though he was considering kicking him, and then stalked from the room, anger rolling off him in tangible waves.
"I can see why he would be," one whispered boldly, and the group collapsed into giggles.
Instead he watched in silence as Draco exhaled and wiped the alcohol's residue from his mouth, not smearing the blood as he did so. Why was Harry so enchanted by the sight? Something about those vivid red streaks was so interesting to him, plus they drew attention to Malfoy's mouth, which was only a bonus.
There was probably no quicker way to wind Draco up than this, other than literally to be Harry Potter.
"I don't know what your problem is, to be honest, Ginny," Harry frowned. "I've been thinking about it and I've realised it doesn't have to mean anything-"
"I wish I'd just fucking hit him when I had the chance," he seethed, feeling the anger radiate off his skin. "God, the things I'd do to that boy. He's going to regret what he's done today."
Snape had warned everybody not to sniff their potions while it was in the cauldron, in order to let the potency reach its full potential in the little bottle, but now it was time for the moment of truth.
"No, I think I should go," he said, "I know you mean it innocently enough but my heart will take this more seriously than yours will. I don't want to rush this now we have a chance to do it right. I have to protect myself."
Instead, Harry had thrown himself into his modelling and parenting and spending time with Ron and Hermione once they'd all left school, and it worked. He hadn't seen Ginny in two years, last time was briefly at some family party or other at Ron's parents' house, and that had been really awkward. She was married now apparently, to Seamus Finnegan, a fellow Gryffindor while they were at Hogwarts, and according to Ron they had a new baby son. A little half-brother for Lily, Harry realised.
"No, not fun, Malfoy," Harry glared. "A nuisance. You always wind me up, and use me for your own selfish gain, and embarrass me-"
Harry's breathing hitched in his throat, a reflex response to the touch, but he still mentally kicked himself for it.
"Fuck ME, it's cold!" Malfoy yelled, and they both gasped with laughter, shaking with the shock of the water.
Hermione was already on her way back out the portrait door to find Malfoy and give her a piece of her mind, and part of Ron pitied the bloke. He followed his friend, though. It was always fun to watch Hermione bollock Malfoy.
"About time you realised," Harry laughed softly. "I have been telling you that for a while now."
Harry was still mad at Draco by the time they got to the next lesson they had together, Tea Leaves And Other Shit, also known as Divination with Professor Trelawney.
"Feel any better?" he breathed, and Malfoy nodded.
"I am entitled to kiss whoever I like, you're right," Malfoy whispered, leaning his forehead against Harry's in a way he'd always wanted him to. "And who I like - against my will - is you."
It was a tired and aching Harry that shuffled into the Great Hall for breakfast early the next morning. He saw Draco sat on his own at the end of the Slytherin table across the room, and froze. He'd hoped to avoid him by getting up so early, but looked like the other boy had beaten him to it.
"This is what I feared," Blaise shook his head.
Pansy sighed, and pulled Draco to one side by the arm. "You're so oblivious, Draco. When the class is dismissed, we're going to follow Granger and Weasley, and then you'll see. This is going to be a good meltdown."
So why did he still fantasise about all the pain he could inflict on the other boy? He knew he had Harry's heart now, however he wanted it. Why not just accept it?
"I'm going to see Draco," Harry said, lacing up his shoes meticulously. "Or possibly just his lawyer. I don't want to get my hopes up on it right now but I promise I'll explain if it works. Keep your fingers crossed, though- this could really win his case."
The 'yes' didn't come as swiftly as usual to Draco's lips.
Harry widened his eyes innocently. "You know I'm not in it for the size of your /wallet/, Malfoy," he smirked suggestively. "And for future reference, the password for the Gryffindor common room is Caput draconis at the moment. You'll probably appreciate the irony in that."
"That's none of your business, Parkinson."
He was revising Astronomy with Hermione (it was still not his best subject, even with Malfoy so often absent from the class these days) and it was going rather well.
By now a chill was in the air and Halloween was just around the corner, and each House was planning their own party, which distracted each of the boys from each other for a little - Draco because he loved to help plan any elaborate Slytherin events, and Harry because of the significance of the date.
"Could you please state your name for the court?" said the Judge in a booming, oppressive voice.
"Weird dreams," he replied quietly. "About Malfoy."
want me," Malfoy interrupted. "Evidence that you want me more than than anything else in the world, I might add. Of course that would interest me, given how you normally act towards me. It's just an excellent weapon in my armoury to use against the creature I despise most in the world."
"Not that bad??" Draco repeated incredulously. "Harry, you're an absolute animal. It's bloody carnal."
Harry wasn't sure what to say to that, but it hurt him to realise that she was right. He used to think he was a decent person - no, better, he was a really good person. What had Malfoy done to him?
Malfoy smirked without raising his head. "I know that you knew it was Io, you freak."
"Fine," Potter glared, tucking the parchment into his own pocket.
His heart began to pound harder as the scent flooded what felt like his entire nervous system - unmistakable, again.
Draco consented to the testing surprisingly quickly ("I told you he couldn't say no to me," Harry smiled smugly) but on the morning of the trial Mallory came to Harry with urgent look in his eyes.
In the doorway stood a Slytherin he didn't know well, but recognised as Daphne Greengrass. "Hello?" he blinked uncertainly.
he thought.
They both knew he was lying, he went half insane whenever Malfoy ignored him. The drawing of himself wrapped round Malfoy's little finger sprang to mind, and he groaned inwardly.
"Write to me every day you ugly whore," he mumbled into Pansy's neck as she jumped at him for a last hug goodbye.
"Still pretending you hate him, then," Ginny piped up from across the room. "I see."
"Stare at me all you want, I know I'm fit," Harry preened. "God, I sound just like you! You're rubbing off on me, you know that?"
He should have known Potter would stand him up.
"That'll do," Lucius said with an abrupt nod. "You can have a break now, Potter."
Blaise produced only a single small bag from Draco's trouser pocket, which he deftly slipped into his own.
"God, I've missed you," he said breathlessly. "And God, I've been in love with you for so long."
"That would be lovely, Draco, how sweet of you to offer," Harry laughed.
Draco's lawyer was already at the cells when Harry arrived, walking thoughtfully up and down in the corridor by the entrance.
"Oh shut it, Potter."
Hating himself for being such a coward, Draco nodded. "I've missed this," he breathed.
"It's manipulative and cruel to play with someone's feelings like that!" Hermione agreed hotly, banging the table for emphasis. "We should go to Snape about it - he may be on their side normally, but messing around in Potions won't be something he'd take lightly!"
"Why not?" he whispered back, his hand roaming dangerously low over Harry's stomach and causing at least one or two twitches. "You don't want me?"
It all came to a head one Monday afternoon in Astronomy class.
"You will," Draco shook his head. "You always know what to do."
"I do sort of wonder if you're being unfair to him," Harry protested, but Blaise cut him off.
"My client didn't have to do what he did on that day," said Mallory, "And he risked his own life in the process. But in this brave and entirely selfless act, he single-handedly gave Mr. Potter the power to end the war and destroy Voldemort, saving hundreds, if not thousands, of lives. If it wasn't for Draco Malfoy, the world would be very different outside court today."
Harry and Draco had had a huge argument not long after the battle, after he'd been detained by the Aurors on Death Eater charges.
Even weeks after his lips had last been kissed he kept touching them, deepening his infatuation every time he remembered that Malfoy's mouth had touched them too, he'd literally kissed Draco Malfoy, and it was dizzying, even with the memory of how hard he'd been rejected afterwards.
"This is just the momentary good bit before a fall," Blaise said quietly. "Don't get too attached to this version of him, Potter, alright?"
He'd taken to studying with Hermione every free period he had and throwing himself into Quidditch practice too, much to Wood's delight. And all the work was paying off - Gryffindor won match after effortless match (especially with Draco newly kicked off the Slytherin team, the reason for which was the source of a lot of school rumours) and Harry's grades just kept getting better.
"I'd like to think so."
But that didn't mean he stopped thinking about it, of course. Malfoy's sheer willingness to inflict pain and play with Harry's emotions never failed to amaze him, even now after so much had happened between the two of them.
"But I can still show you a good time," Malfoy offered, and what was Harry going to say to that - no? It seemed ridiculous. He didn't think the word was even in his vocabulary when it came to Malfoy.
"I just expected better of you, Harry," Neville had told him that morning in Charms when the topic of Malfoy came up.
"Is that what you want?"
"Not exactly," Harry muttered, but he read on.
"What else does this Potter kid do then?" Harry asked. "He sounds like quite a catch."
And with that, he stalked off towards the Slytherin dungeon, leaving Harry staring after him in awe.
It seemed it was his turn to be unable to say no to the other boy.
He didn't like the silence that followed.
If he was to be left to his own devices, Harry knew with total certainty that he'd find a way to entirely destroy himself with the other boy.
Despite Draco's arrogance, his history, his quickness for malice, Harry knew he loved him now, and he'd love him later, too. Perhaps that had always been the case, ever since they'd met.
"And know that while we're apart, I'll be spending my time looking for someone like you until I see you again, and I won't find anyone. There's no one quite like you. But I think you're worth the wait."
"He's strong," Harry insisted. "I believe in him."
Draco joined in too, of course, but often found that he preferred just to watch the other boy's reactions with a mixture of revulsion and amusement.
"He'll soon cheer up when he sees what we have in store for him tomorrow," laughed Blaise. "He's going to love this trick. Bloody Potter. Can't think of a better way to fuck with him, actually. You're a genius, Pansy."
"I'd rather die," Harry managed, and Draco flashed him an excruciating glare before he turned and strode out of the Hall, trailing scarlet openly behind him.
"OK, that's defamation... that's libellous... that's slander... that's a threat... Harry, this is all nonsense!"
"I can do whatever I like to you, too, Potter," he said, and his eyes flashed with something Harry didn't quite recognise. "Can't I?"
Draco paused, debating. "I know," he sighed in the end. "I wish I wouldn't, too."
Harry glowed. "Will you paint me with them, do you think?"
"Is Potter
The hardest blow, however, came when Oliver Wood cornered him as he was leaving Astronomy on his own, and asked him to "temporarily step down" from the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor team.
"What's the point in inviting me if he isn't going to meet me here?" he muttered to himself, shoving his free hand frustratedly in his pocket.
But Draco had been right again, of course. Anxiety, dizziness, and paranoia were all good words to explain the turmoil inside Harry's body that morning, and there were plenty more besides.
It seemed inappropriate now to be kissing after what they'd seen, but also somehow exactly what should have happened. They'd learnt to take love wherever and whenever and however it was offered, and if that meant kissing in a hill's hollow a couple of miles from the battle scene where they'd both nearly died, then so be it.
"Silence in court!" frowned the judge, but Ginny was joined by another redhead at her side - "I saw him throw it too," said Ron.
His friends considered telling him for a second, then decided against it.
Draco's face above Harry's in the half-light, the opaline glow that reflected off their skin, those celestial grey eyes dancing with anticipation... it was haunting. His mouth had pushed so softly down on Harry's, spilling tenderness and sweet wine off his tongue like honey and rosehip, and Harry had one hell of a sweet tooth for it.
Ron and Hermione moved up to allow him to sit between them, and the trio ate in comfortable silence with Seamus, Pavarti, Dean, Ginny and Lavender, while Harry wondered if he should confide in any of them about the night before.
"I'm sorry."
"Thanks, Ronald," Harry said sarcastically. "You always know what to say, don't you?"
"But I assume you wrote about it in your gay little diary or something," the blonde continued. He put on a mincing, sarcastic tone. "Dear Diary, Draco Malfoy made love to me last night with his megacock-"
"Hermione," he hissed, cutting her off mid-sentence once they were safely round the corner and out of sight. "I smelled Dior Sauvage."
"What's this?" he asked curiously, and Pansy lunged across the desk in a panicked flurry, which was enough to rapidly assure him that it was important, and he used his lofty height to wield it well out of the girl's reach.
"Let this be a sort of punishment for Mr. Potter," Snape replied in a cold tone. "And we shall hope that next time, he will thus find motivation to make the potion correctly."
to you???"
"I can't believe this. How do you think it felt, Harry, to hear the news from a fucking Second Year?" Ginny demanded, tucking her red hair aggressively behind her ears.
"Darling."
"It's been one day since that fucking lesson and I only told Ron and Hermione, I've got no idea how that even got round so fast!" Harry glared, bemused. "They wouldn't have told anybody."
Malfoy, unbothered, put on a grating approximation of Harry's voice. "
"Yes, you do!" Harry protested. "You know it's Charmed to pick up on your emotions, help with your self expression. And look what it's expressed! Don't you see?"
"You're SUCH a knob, Potter," Draco sighed. "Now, how about you go and make yourself look like you're going on a date with Draco Malfoy because, let's be honest honey, school robes and hair like that ain't gonna get you tongued."
There was a little photograph of Lily at the bottom of the envelope, and Harry slid it out eagerly. She was starting with uncle Ron and auntie Hermione while Harry was at work, and by the looks of the picture, she was loving every second. She was perched on Ron's old kiddie broom from when he was her age, laughing her head off while he steadied her. Hermione was stood in the background watching on in amusement, their baby son Hugo cradled in her arms.
"That's funny to you?"
"Not like this," he admitted breathlessly.
************
"Draco, are you okay?" Goyle asked. Draco got up hurriedly, brushing the dust off his robes.
He took a breath, then continued.
"Yes!" Harry protested. "I'm not like Malfoy, Ron. I don't know about etiquette or dress codes or anything - I'm almost certainly about to humiliate myself again."
His jaw had begun to tense and grind by now, and upon seeing this Draco swiftly reached into the pocket of his discarded robes for another lollipop, his lips still lightly crimson from the first.
"Thank... you?" Draco said, the words tasting unfamiliar in his mouth. Harry shrugged.
It was a chilly October night, barely minutes before midnight, and while all the other students of Hogwarts were fast asleep, Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson had mischief on their minds.
Shallow breaths crashed against his ribs, and Harry's words rocketed around his brain faster than he could read them.
After a few intense seconds, Malfoy pulled back and shoved the other boy vehemently away from him once more. He wiped a drop of Harry's blood off his own fake blood trails, and shuddered.
Malfoy jumped hastily off the bed like he'd been caught doing something awful, and glowered down at Harry. Thank God there was no one else in the room.
"Only a little at a time," Malfoy replied vaguely, lunging again for Harry's face. "Just enough to keep me up."
"You're a coward, Draco Malfoy," Harry hissed, he pulled him roughly away from everyone's watching eyes and out of the Hall. "You talk so loud when your friends are there and say all these awful things when you know I won't react, it's cowardice."
"Don't be so loud, both of you," he said, grabbing his friends by the arm and pulling them down the corridor behind him.
"Is that seriously all I'm worth to you?" Harry demanded, more than a little hurt at the dismissal. "Did you at least scratch a little notch on your bedpost for me, along with all the others that you don't care about?"
The snake at the portrait let him in as before, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief as the door swung open and revealed an empty dorm. Dark as ever, walled in by the Lake that Harry had just left, it was a calming and oddly familiar atmosphere bearing in mind this was only his third ever visit.
"I don't think I can do this," he said, and Malfoy's face fell.
Hurt flashed across the other boy's face, and Draco got up quickly, wheeling round to run out of the room before Harry could see him cry.
Malfoy surveyed Harry doubtfully. "Should I get changed?" he asked.
The way he'd looked that time he apologised, so broken and young and still bewitchingly pretty, or those wild eyes flashing from across the ice as he skated the line between life and death like it was nothing.
"The youngest Weasley will be taking your place on the team - though emphasis is on 'for now', Potter. I'd like you back as soon as you're fit," Oliver warned him seriously. "Gin's good, but she isn't you. Sort your shit out, yeah?"
Draco paused, then slipped it over his head, blushing slightly. Harry blushed too. It wasn't like Harry hadn't seen Draco shirtless before, he had, just... it was different this time. It was different this time because last time Draco hadn't been sat on his lap, clearly hard, his perfect bare stomach pushed up against Harry's and his tongue in his mouth.
His only response was a pained but triumphant grin. Starless. Sunless. Unbound.
Potter had at least seemed shocked when talking to Granger and the Weasel, but still, like he'd said himself: it was unmistakable. Those were Draco's signature scents. That's what Potter had smelt in the fucking love potion.
"Hurrying off for a wank, Potter?" Malfoy jeered after him, and Harry broke into a half run, not stopping until he reached the showers and could tear his kit off in peace to stand under the hot water and cry.
"Are you going to explain what you're doing, or leave us in the dark?" Hermione asked when he reappeared.
The hues were marvellously vibrant and swelled effortlessly over the parchment, revealing Harry's eyes, his scar, the spiral of his open mouth, his hands filled with opaline wine and fruits and tins of broom polish, and once, a beating heart.
"Closer, eh?" Malfoy whispered, and his hand slid another stretch up Harry's leg. It was all the dark-haired boy could do not to whimper.
"Easy, Potter," Theo tried, but Harry shook his hand aggressively off his arm.
By the time the Slytherins eventually caught the Snitch, Oliver Wood was absolutely fuming, and Harry left the pitch as quickly as he could, mortified. He'd never played so badly in his life, even as a First Year.
he realised
"Shut up!"
Harry nodded. "That's what I thought."
"Yeah?"
"This is a shit party, Potter," Malfoy sneered over the music. "Can't any of you morons Charm a decent sound system? I knew it would be tragic in here."
"God, Draco, lighten up," Pansy chuckled after he sent her a particularly crushing glare.
he had written
Without any further thought, he reached and tore his robes off with wilful abandon, then leapt into the Lake with a loud holler. Malfoy watched on in amazement.
"I don't know if I want to punch Draco Malfoy in the face more or if I want him to punch me," Potter was declaring as Longbottom tried frantically to pass him the loudly fizzing and inefficient antidote.
"Probably does the trick though," Harry shrugged.
Draco had thought scornfully to himself.
He didn't want Lily to grow up with a father like that, like the children in the apartment below theirs, who spent their lives in other people's dirty hand me down clothes, permanently hungry and unclean, and never getting the presents they deserve. That's if anyone even bothered to remember their birthdays any more. No, Harry wanted to give his daughter everything, and be able to care for her like any decent father, but if working at the club was what that would take, he knew he'd do it in a heartbeat.
Harry, however, was loving his newfound power over the other boy as his lips worked their way down Draco's pale throat to the sweet spot on his collarbone. He began to suck until a little crimson rose bloomed where his mouth had been, and Draco moaned softly, tightening his grip in Harry's still-wet hair. That bit had always been a sensitive spot for him.
"Stop doing this to me," he replied. "You have to stop this. It's hurting."
Later that night, while Malfoy slept soundly beside him (quiet, freshly showered, and warm), Harry's mind drifted back to the vivid colours that had spilt on the page when the two of them kissed earlier.
"Nice Potion, Potter," he'd said sarcastically as he sauntered past Harry's work station. "Looks like you threw it up yourself."
If anything, his attraction to the other boy was growing stronger by the day - Malfoy wasn't exactly growing less attractive, or attempting to avoid Harry like he'd claimed he wanted so badly. In fact, he was just as malicious and attention-seeking around Harry as he ever was, though the two of them danced carefully around recent events.
Following this realisation, Harry's next decision was that he was to carry on acting the way he had before: as if he had no interest whatsoever in the other boy.
"I saw them," he replied as they stumbled down the hill towards the Forbidden Forest. "Granger and Weasley, at least - they were very much alive, Potter."
Harry ran his hands through his hair and groaned. "I don't fucking know! Apparently, yes! I still feel like I just want to choke him out in a totally not-sexual, totally trying-to-kill-him way - but I guess my dick has other ideas that I didn't know about!"
"I think you're overthinking this, Potter," Malfoy's scornful tone was back. "It was a joke again, alright? I was just fucking with you."
Malfoy had blinked back at him, bemused. "If you're talking about when I left you in the changing rooms the other evening, Potter, then I don't think you know what 'hit and run' means. But yeah, since you're asking, that is what I usually do."
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry asked, steeling himself for an insult.
The rain lashed down blindingly hard. It seemed like it was now reaching the boys' bones, licking over them like ice as the quality of the sky's darkness deepened. Draco realised in that moment that if grief could be a colour, it would be forever associated in his mind with that livid violet-grey. He knew now how a person could grieve for something they never had. Never even wanted.
Then he began to push down on Harry's leg so hard that Harry could feel the cool silver of his rings pressing through to the heat of his skin, and it made him shiver.
Ron had to ask him four times to pass the pepper before he gave up and
"Now yours," Draco said breathlessly, helping Harry pull the jumper off. Harry felt very exposed the way Draco's piercing grey eyes scanned up and down his torso, but he didn't seem to have any complaints.
Luckily, dinner time was approaching, the sole meal Potter seemed not to skip these days, and Malfoy deliberately chose a seat in the Great Hall that he knew would be near the section of the Gryffindor table usually chosen by Potter and his little friends.
"You loved it, didn't you?" Harry asked, as though he genuinely wanted to know the answer. "You had a great time watching me go on about you?"
He helped himself to hot food and juice from the centre of the table, batted away his friends' irritable questions about where he'd been the day before, and chewed thoughtfully.
"Is that what you want to do?" he asked, his heart rate picking up.
"How am I using you?" Malfoy protested. "You make me sound like a fucking predator!"
"Race you to the other end of the pitch!" Draco yelled suddenly, forcing himself forwards over his broom and shooting off in the direction of the furthest goalpoasts. "Come on, you fucking twink, let's go!"
Draco nodded. "Walk me back?"
"Obviously because I fuck on molly?" he replied, gesturing to his drink.
he thought wryly.
And in the centre of it all was Draco Malfoy, every inch the Slytherin king in extravagant long holographic robes, a silver snake-head sceptre firmly grasped in his hand, and an iridescent shimmer on his cheekbones that glistened in the light whenever he moved. Most impressive of all were the translucent silken wings on the boy's back that he'd charmed to flicker as though they could really fly him into the sky whenever he chose.
"This is pathetic," Harry muttered, but it didn't stop him from leaning to breathe in the scent of Draco's robe too, and loving it.
He took his broom up a lot more than usual these days in an attempt to outrun his thoughts and get rid of the flashes of Malfoy that ruled both his waking and his dreaming consciousness. He'd fly as fast as he dared and often faster to feel invincible, but sometimes when he caught sight of his silhouette in the Black Lake he was struck by how small and lonely he looked. Like a little boy playing pretend with a broom.
"This is all yours if you make the right decision," Lucius had told his son in that stern, unfeeling tone. Draco didn't have to ask what was in the bottle, but it was extremely obvious that it wasn't just water. And he wanted it so badly.
The way his tongue licked out over his lips before he could stop it, the way he bit down on it in raptures, the way his body rocked and trembled and surged, all of it was nothing short of magnetism. And Harry's heart broke that he might never have that connection again.
He glanced furtively around the empty dungeon, shifted his position on his knees, then slid open Malfoy's robes to reveal that the boy was already hard. Harry began to plant butterfly-soft kisses on the exposed skin he'd hurt so much, soothing, healing kisses that made Draco shiver under his touch.
He cleared his throat, his Adam's apple bobbing as he did so. "About that Weasel thing, Potter - it wasn't how it sounded. I didn't explain properly."
Draco couldn't afford that on his perfect Pureblood reputation.
There was a fair amount of blood, though, and Harry was sure it would smart in the morning. He wondered why he felt so close to the other boy, so suddenly relaxed around him. Because this was still Malfoy he was looking at, still the boy who loathed him and said the worst things he'd ever heard.
He ran a hand through his hair. "But I got up and I went out in the cold and the rain, and I deliberated for ages but I bought you something, and you couldn't even be polite to me when I got back to find out you'd possibly shagged my ex."
"Why should I believe you? I don't even know what happened!"
Was it just a habit now, to hurt Potter? Or was it still what he actively wanted, no matter what else he wanted alongside it?
"Now, listen here, you little lesbian," Draco growled. "We are men. We don't kiss. We ENGULF!"
"Why didn't it?" Harry asked when the kiss was broken. He wasn't quite brave enough to rest his forehead on Malfoy's, but he hoped one day he might be.
Harry's heart sank into his stomach as soon as he remembered the fixture was Gryffindor v Slytherin.
"Not me!" he leapt in hurriedly, throwing his hands up as if to wield off an attack. "Believe me, Potter, I'm sickened enough by the idea of you liking me to know for sure that I'd never fake that. Pansy and Blaise think they're funny, though."
They remained that way for the rest of the lesson, Malfoy's heavy-ringed hand pressing malice into Harry's burningly sensitive skin, and then the bell for the end of the class rang and Malfoy finally let go.
"I hate you, I really hate you-"
At this, Draco went very pale.
"And if you look in the top left corner, you'll see.. see... um," Trelawney fumbled for her hanky again, and mopped her eyes while thirty awkward students watched. She cleared her throat. "I'm sorry, class dismissed, I can't go on," she said at last. "I'm ..a little tired today. You can go early."
"If the fucker isn't down there I'll leave him to it," Draco resolved, but in the end his instinct was right and Potter was indeed by the lake.
Draco sighed, and reached reluctantly into his pocket. "Look, it's probably easier to show you than tell you."
"God, teen romance," Harry rolled his eyes angrily. "Seriously though, I can't believe you'd be so careless after what we did last night."
But then he was drinking, and his parents were nodding approvingly, and the familiar bitter aftertaste of the elixir let him know that what he needed was in there. And it was good.
He'd checked the time; it was two in the morning. "It's Saturday," Harry said, "That means the Express leaves for London tomorrow - is it going to be really bad?"
She'd long been contemplating the special way that the Slytherin looked at her best friend, as though it was nice to be the best thing the dark-haired boy had ever seen, rather than something pretty sad and awful.
"It's not my fault you've got this weird fixated crush on me," Malfoy attempted to bat the accusation away through gritted teeth, but Harry only laughed spitefully.
"Fucking Potter," he spat, kicking my boot hard against the ground in frustration. "Making me have feelings... I hate him, I hate him, I...."
Harry laughed incredulously. "You're seventeen, why do you have viagra?" he asked.
Harry stayed quiet, but Malfoy only gathered momentum.
He'd had a rough couple of weeks at the Manor to say the least and had come back to school angry, touch starved, and (though he despised the word) horny. Where was Potter when you needed him? The git hadn't seemed happy to see him back for the Spring term, a fact which Draco deeply resented.
Harry thought about protesting properly but couldn't imagine how terribly Malfoy would react, and besides, it was hot, so instead he let go of the sharp wrist and shifted his hips as hard as he could away from the boy without drawing anyone else's attention. But the hand was unyielding, practiced, certain.
"Oh, but I do discriminate," Draco replied with a cruel smile. "Which is the main reason why you're never going to get it. You disgusting little Half-Blood."
So, while the other students set about collecting Ashwinder egg, rose thorn, peppermint, powdered moonstone, and pearl dust, Pansy and Blaise were subtly unloading their own ingredients under their work station.
He raised his hands defensively, as though Harry was about to argue with the statement.
Harry rubbed his eyes, careful not to smudge the subtle makeup his shitty excuse for a stylist had applied that morning, and stood up to walk reluctantly back into the studio, subbing his fag out on the wall as he went.
"Isn't it too early to discharge me?" he asked weakly. "I'm not finished with my rehabilitation courses...."
By the third midnight awakening of that week, Harry decided to just give Theo, Pansy, and Blaise the Gryffindor password so they could come and get him themselves whenever Malfoy caused a scene, without banging the door down and waking the entire dorm up.
Harry glanced over at Ron's bed. It wasn't even 7 in the morning, so of course the other boy's drapes were firmly drawn around his bed. Harry decided to leave them that way, he didn't fancy getting Hexed.
"But I-"
The lips that twisted such terrible words around him in public found that behind closed doors they couldn't leave his open mouth alone, and the stomach that had churned with anger and hatred for years over Harry found that there was no place better in the world than to be pushed up against his back while he gasped.
He could ask me for literally anything and I'd give it to him, Harry thought to himself, his eyes only stinging slightly at the pain of the realisation. The clothes off my back, the food off my plate, all the money in my bank. He can have it.
A pot of ink cascaded from a desk followed by a flurry of spattered parchment, and whole shelves were wiped clear of their books with the force of his angry body.
"Objection!" barked the opposition again. "Your Honour, Mr. Potter is not a lawyer, I hardly think he should-"
"When was the last time you were high?" Potter asked abruptly, and Draco frowned at the intrusion.
"Four hours?" Harry gasped. "What the hell, why did you wait that long??"
come back," Harry said, lacing up his shoes. "I'm giving you this time as a gift. Get better with it."
"You're actually a fucking psycho," Hermione snarled, more angry with the other boy than she'd ever been. "I'm telling you to go and find him, now. Now, Malfoy! Or I'll tell everyone here
"That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard, mate, but you do you," Ron added, equally hysterical.
Harry realised with an awful jolt. His head swam and for a moment he thought he might throw up.
"I just need to feel something, Potter," he whined, and Harry's eyes widened at the vulnerability he demonstrated. Was he actually
The rawness and vulnerability of that confession made Harry feel like crying, and the sudden memory was enough for him to make up his mind and stride over the prettiest blonde at the Slytherin table.
He dressed slowly, avoiding the mirror, and made his way anxiously down to the Great Hall. He wouldn't eat anything, he felt too drained and upset, but he'd see Ron and Hermione at least and that might alleviate some of his suffering.
Her eyes widened, but she tried to play it cool. "I'm sure lots of people wear Dior Sauvage, Harry," she tried.
But Draco was aching and drained, so he said it nonetheless.
Malfoy hadn't allowed himself to hear those words since that night, hadn't dared to accept such softness because how DARE Potter talk to him like that, with such kindness and open adoration? How dare he say he loved him when his own mother couldn't?
"You're different, are you?" he asked, and Harry knew somehow that Malfoy was about to say something really hurtful.
"Will you?" asked Harry.
"I- I don't know, maybe he saw us and-"
"I am not jealous," Ron huffed, but it was too late; half the Hall appeared to be laughing at him.
"Yeah, big day for you. You smelled me, right?"
The kiss was clumsy, slightly out of sync from their time apart. But it was contact, and in that moment they both needed to feel needed so badly that this imperfect kiss was heaven.
"Can I stay here tonight?"
There was a silence, where Hermione and Ron didn't know if they should laugh or skip straight to comforting him. Harry turned to them, wild-eyed, his hair sticking up manically where he'd shoved his fists through it.
"Are you still taking that shit?!" Harry asked in horror, swerving the kiss under the gaze of about a dozen watchful Slytherins.
he thought in a mix of wonder and horror.
"No you don't," Draco grinned. "Your Gryffindor one doesn't have my name on the back."
"Oh my God, this is a breakthrough," the lawyer breathed. "How didn't I think of this myself? That's wonderful, Potter, really wonderful thinking!"
There was blood on his knees, pissing through the material of his black trousers down to his ankles, and when he leaned over to kiss Harry, he saw there was still a little powder on his tongue, the residue from his bottle.
"It's just a joke - Draco, give it back, it's private!" she hissed, trying to snatch the page back from him without attracting Snape's attention, but Draco only laughed and held it higher.
One thing was different, though, and that was the lack of resistance between their hips, which became increasingly concerning for Harry. Even when he'd really hated him, Malfoy had never struggled to get it up- was it something Harry had done?
These were all beautiful notions that set Draco on fire from the inside out, and it looked like the time had come for him to release it.
"I'm sure," Draco whispered back, but Harry only smiled sadly.
It took almost two years, this waiting game of Harry's.
Potter frowned. "Wrong how? I know what I smelt, and Amortentia doesn't 'get it wrong', Malfoy."
Perhaps it would be cathartic. They'd both feel better, could go back to their previous enmity where both knew where they stood - and where they stood, was that they unequivocally despised each other.
After Draco's acquittal, the verdict of "not guilty" rang in his and Harry's ears for quite some time. July that year was softer than usual somehow, as though someone had blurred the edges of the days, and summer was high in the air.
He walked to class in a daze.
"Can't you try?" he asked quietly. Malfoy didn't meet his eyes. That was answer enough.
, Malfoy. And if anything happened to him last night as a result of your cruelty, then the consequences are entirely on you."
"I need comfort," Harry whispered.
Draco shook his head, then fixed his gaze on his desk and didn't look up.
"Believe it or not, neither of those things. It wasn't even about you," Harry lied coldly. "Not everything is."
"A little," he said. "But you're going to have to do better than that."
He slumped down in a battered old red corduroy chair alongside his friends, and proceeded to mock everything the professor put in front of him.
Fair point. Harry pulled out a Quill from his robe pocket and helped himself to a sheet of parchment from Hermione's stack, ignoring her protests.
Harry walked obediently into the spot he was pointed to, and posed again and again until he felt like he was about to break down. Malfoy wasn't saying much, which was a good thing, Harry supposed.
Hermione was so desensitised to the word that she didn't even flinch. "You're a really nasty piece of work, Malfoy, you know that?" she asked.
Then it hit him, all at once, like an electric shock.
"What's wrong, Draco?" His best friend Pansy asked, peering over his shoulder.
"I'll just test out the scent of one of his sweaters, and maybe his sheets," he mused, "And swipe some of his hair gel, just to be sure."
He groaned with the effort, then cast a
", though his eyes suggested something else entirely.
"Yes," said Harry simply. "You keep selfishly dragging me out of classes or making me miss them entirely, and taking all my attention away from my work outside of lessons too, so today you and I are going to catch up."
Draco wondered. It seemed that way; he never failed to embarrass himself perfectly whenever the opportunity arose.
His blonde hair gleamed under the flashing lights that Dean and Seamus had strung up earlier in the evening, and Harry couldn't help but think how pretty he looked.
The first detention took place the evening after the incident, and tensions were still running extremely high. The boys had been commissioned with the particularly unpleasant task of cleaning out cauldrons of Armadillo bile mixture in the Potions dungeons without their wands, and this only served to put each of them in an even worse mood.
"What's he doing wrong this time?" Hermione asked. "He looks normal."
Draco smirked. "Wanna find out?"
"Do you, though?" Malfoy's gaze was impassive, spiteful. "I don't think you do."
Draco tossed a few more inflammatory comments over to the Gryffindor table as he finished his meal, then his friends stood up to follow him out and he turned to Harry one more time. "Please don't try and break the Slytherin Common Room door down again tonight, Potter, it's getting obsessive."
His head banged back against the lockers with the sheer force with which Malfoy lunged for his mouth, which would've been enormously painful if it wasn't for the biggest adrenaline high of Harry's life coursing through his body.
He caught sight of a sudden flash of dark hair at one of the lower windows that disappeared as soon as he saw it, and rolled his eyes. Stupid git.
"I'm a pretty knob though. So are you when you do your hair like that. S'sexy."
Pansy and Blaise shook their heads with identically infuriating smiles.
Harry gulped.
"Get fucked, Granger," came Draco's half-asleep voice. "I'm hungover."
He'd woken uncharacteristically early that morning and risen early too, which lead to his inadvertently following Malfoy down to breakfast, and catching him in a surprisingly gentle encounter with a House Elf.
"Ah, fuck, I'm so sorry Harry, I didn't realise you were so-"
Harry's heart lurched.
The montage of images was head-spinningly excruciating and untouchably beautiful at the same time.
By the time he appeared in the courtyard that they'd agreed to meet in, Harry was out of breath and extremely glad that he'd remembered deodorant that morning. There was no sign of Draco yet, and for that Harry was thankful. It gave him some time to catch his breath again so he didn't pant on his date.
"I have to talk to you," he hissed, dragging the confused boy round the corner before he could even manage a complaint or an innuendo.
"Insufferable, hateful, evil little bastard," Draco fumed, so worked up that he couldn't help but pace frantically around the room.
Draco's eyes widened in horror. Of course, Harry didn't know - how could he? He thought about somehow playing it off as a word mixup, then decided against it. "
Harry bit his lip. "You sure?" He asked, searching Draco's face worriedly. "I just... Yeah. I'm confused."
"Dickhead."
"Are you alright, miss?" Granger asked, all sweetness and mock concern while everyone else rushed for the door. Stupid fucking mudblood bitch.
he wondered before he could bite the thought back. Harry was fit, sure, but words like
"Changing rooms," Malfoy growled, before following the other boy into the dark.
Harry's hands pushed gratefully under the green Slytherin jersey, running over smooth, toned skin and sharp hip bones he'd dreamed of touching for weeks now. As his fingers slipped over Malfoy's lower stomach he felt the other boy shiver deliciously.
Harry was amazed at the transformation in front of him. In the past days since he'd stopped getting high, Malfoy seemed more present and lucid, and far less cruel too. He seemed to accept Harry as, what? A friend, maybe? At the very least, a companion.
Harry blushed, but didn't argue. What Draco was saying was painfully close to the truth, and judging by the look on his face, he knew it. And with that, he sashayed out of the dorm, leaving Harry staring at the spot where he'd stood in disbelief. How was that boy real?
For a moment his mouth froze, but tentatively he began to respond.
"Not like that," he shook his head. "We see each other differently. I can't explain it. He's like a different type of magic to me."
Harry scoffed. "Me, get over myself? What about
"Don't talk to me for the rest of the lesson," he replied in a tone so cold and so similar to his Father's voice that the others didn't object.
do that," Harry realised. "You'd watch me poison myself. OK."
A bigger fracture. Serious, lasting damage.
"You'll regret this, you fucking ginger tramp," Malfoy growled across the room. Blood dripped over his lips as he spoke, but he didn't seem to care.
"You have my word." And with that, he was up and heading out of the dormitory, taking Harry's heart with him as he went.
The bell for the start of lessons muffled Draco's response for most people, and reluctantly the other students began to leave the Hall with disappointment that they'd miss the rest of the show. Harry, however, heard his words loud and clear.
"Potter, you know exactly why I did that-"
"Stubborn git." Ron shook his head, taking a big bite of the first sausage sandwich on his plate.
Hermione bit her lip anxiously. "God, Harry. You fancy Malfoy? More than anyone else in the world?"
"The receptors in Draco's brain are damaged from months of constant serotonin stimulation," Blaise continued, "And it'll take a while, but they will come back. But you know Draco."
"Yeah," Draco said, "I don't lie to you any more."
Harry thought back to the past two lonely weeks without him, how desperate he'd been just to see Draco's face again. "You can have a kiss if you do it nicely," he heard himself say quietly.
"Come or don't come, I don't care," the blonde shrugged carelessly as he turned to leave as quickly as he came. "I'll be out of my mind anyway that night."
Malfoy toyed with the idea of lying, but decided against it. "Yeah, he stayed."
"Thanks, Mrs. Weasley." Harry smiled and offered up his plate, then turned straight back to Hermione. At the forefront of his mind, just out of reach, was a glimmer of a memory from a former Defence Against the Dark Arts class.
"But now isn't our time," Harry conceded. "But one day it will be, and we can do things the right way for once."
Harry wondered if his heartbreak was audible.
"Daddy not coming to get you, Malfoy?" He enquired nastily, turning back to his book.
"Romantic," Harry muttered, but flinched as Malfoy shoved his shoulder hard in frustration.
"I can still hurt you," Malfoy vowed, but his words didn't hit as hard as usual, and Harry allowed himself a small laugh.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Do you want me to buy you lunch in Hogsmeade?" He asked.
"Avada Kedavra!" the Dark Lord screamed, sending an unblockable bolt of green directly into Harry's chest.
"I actually notch my broom, if you must know," Draco smirked, and Harry wondered why this image made his stomach drop into his crotch.
"Good start?" he asked Hermione. She peered over his shoulder.
“I got it. You can pick up next time,” Draco reassured him gently.
For the first time since Harry had laid eyes on him, Draco appeared utterly incapable of inflicting pain on someone else, and worthy of complete adoration, which Harry was more than happy to give him for once.
"I can do that."
Malfoy had seen every part of Harry's body, felt every inch of his bare skin, and yet the only time Harry felt truly naked was when he stood in front of the other boy crying for him to love him.
"You could be my dad, if you wanted to," Malfoy smirked, and Harry's eyebrows raised. He knew exactly where this was going.
"And what is your relationship to the defendant?"
"I need you." His voice cracked and tore a little piece off Harry's heart. "Harry, please."
Mallory frowned, thinking hard. "I'd have to Owl the labs... I could obviously pull some strings, get it fast-tracked, but the trial's in a week and it's possibly quite a complicated process. And of course, you're aware he'd have to consent to the testing."
, what the fuck are you doing?" Draco yelped, withdrawing like he'd been physically shocked.
He cleared his throat awkwardly and leant on the banister in front of him for support. He could feel the barrister's eyes boring into the back of him, but harsher still was Draco's gaze from his position on the right hand side of his lawyer.
"Why didn't you check with me?" Harry asked, but he was unable to feel particularly panicked or angry about it, as Draco was right and it was hitting.
"Why are you staring at me?" Draco demanded. Harry dropped his eyes quickly, cheeks flaring. He longed to say ' because you're beautiful', but didn't quite have the nerve, so opted for a non-committal shrug.
Harry decided.
Lavender Brown, Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott, Pansy Parkinson, Padma and Pavarti Patil, Dean Thomas, Luna Lovegood, Millicent Bullstrode - the list went on until all the Hogwarts students in the courtroom were on their feet.
"You make it sound so simple, don't you, Malfoy?" Harry asked angrily. "Is that really how it is in your head? Is that how you see me and our situation?"
"I know you are," Malfoy rasped, black Lake water dribbling out of his mouth. He coughed and retched to force it out faster, wincing as he did so. "This burns."
"We need to get Draco's Mark tested," was all Harry managed to say, choking down the last of his breakfast before pushing his chair back to run upstairs. "Thanks for breakfast, Mrs. Weasley!" he called, leaving his friends sitting at the kitchen table in bemusement.
"Fine, present singular," Malfoy acknowledged. He paused. "Look, Potter. I won't say anything vile for the rest of the night if you give it to me."
"What the fuck are you doing?" he choked, sliding his own hand under the table to grip Malfoy's wrist; it was an attempt to tear the pressure away, but Malfoy was stronger than Harry and his hand only crept higher the more he resisted.
Harry blinked, not quite able to believe he was actually seeing the Draco Malfoy naked in front of him.
Harry raised his eyebrows. "Bit of a stupid question that, for a smart guy like you," he replied. "But doesn't look like anybody wants you either."
"That might be difficult."
"Or maybe it's just because I hate you, you hate me, and you're trying to make me feel shit about all of the above?"
They hadn't done it like this in a while, so Harry was surprised at how quickly his body relaxed into the pressure as Malfoy slid inside him, and how little it hurt.
He forced himself to speak as he climbed out of bed and reached for his wand. "Where are we going?"
He swallowed. "How about when you spat on me?"
Harry thought to himself wryly. Again, this was something he decided that the jury emphatically
"All I'm saying, Ronald, is that it's eerily similar to the last time he partied with Draco Malfoy!" she was saying as she paced around the Gryffindor boys' dorm. "And last time he was gone, it was because Malfoy had been vile to him - what if this time he's been worse?"
"I said I'm sorry, alright?" Harry had replied, his cheeks raging red with embarrassment. "I felt lonely."
Either way, there was no way he was standing up for the next few minutes at least, so eventually his friends gave up and left him sat almost alone in the Hall.
He slammed his hair back, making several of his friends jump, and stormed over to the Slytherin table.
"Won't be nice if you die of pneumonia, will it now?" Draco shouted. His voice softened as he saw the look on Harry's face.  "I'm sorry, Harry," he said. "Let's just go somewhere you can warm up, yeah?"
"Are you... here for the whole break?" Draco asked awkwardly. He winced as the words left his mouth. Why was he trying to make conversation?
"Master Malfoy," the elf was grovelling as it scurried to keep up with him down the long corridor, little head bobbing up and down like a dandelion in the wind.
Draco looked up in surprise. "You don't want me to...?"
"It's perverted, Potter, honestly," Malfoy had glowered, making Harry wish the earth would swallow him up. "I mean, it's not like you didn't have your own bed! I don't see why you had to track grime and sweat into mine. I had to get the elves to put an early wash on."
Harry blanched. "About a million times less than normal. And I usually want to see him about as much as I want to cut my own arm off with a rusty spoon."
Harry swallowed. This was a hard one. "He's my friend," he said at last. "I'm in love with him, but he's my friend."
"Cool, so you
Ron and Hermione regarded him with interest.
Knowing Harry's compliance issues with the unspoken no-biting rule, Draco had been careful at first to keep his tongue away from Harry's teeth, but he found the sharp pains in his mouth and sharp tugs on his hair a serious turn on. He couldn't believe he had kinks he hadn't discovered already.
"I just expected to see you," Harry said in a hurt little voice. "And you didn't even write to me."
"Is it not the best thing you've ever seen?" Draco asked, his eyes glinting silver in the moonlight.
Once inside, Harry made the executive decision to lead them both down to the Slytherin dormitories. Gryffindor seemed warmer in his mind, but he'd rather not attempt to sneak the ragingly high Slytherin into the lions' dorms at 5 in the morning and risk getting them both Hexed by Seamus or Ron, or both.
He found it hard to get to sleep that night, but that wasn't anything new, he was always stressed about something or other. Before he properly realised what he was doing, Harry had made himself a large coffee and drunk half of it.
"In fact - don't talk to me for the rest of the year. You're scum, both of you, and I can't believe I ever trusted you."
He'd expected to detect something more feminine in the scent, at the very least, though admittedly Harry had recently been wondering if he was bisexual.
Memories flooded his mind again, and his hand clapped instantly to his mouth, which was still smeared with the vampire blood. "Oh, shit."
Harry had hoped things would change now they'd finally had sex, maybe even in a positive light, but he quickly realised that that was naïvety.
"Sure, sure, okay," his date replied sweetly. "DRACO MALFOY'S A SHIRT-LIFTING EMOTIONAL WRECK!" He yelled into the empty grounds after a pause, fighting Draco's hand away from his mouth in glee.
"I'm not being gay, I'm just being a boy with eyes!" Harry protested, ignoring Malfoy's comment about how 'they don't fucking work'. "You look great!"
"Of course you didn't!" he groaned. "Of course you didn't, because I keep it hidden so from you, so you don't try and fucking rescue me because I know you would if you could!"
Harry's eyebrows shot up. "You were going to apologise? Seriously?"
But it was the hardest thing he'd ever done.
"You're being very unfair, Ginny. I don't know what you heard, but-"
Draco's pale cheeks coloured. "I don't know what you mean, I won't be spending any time with him. He thinks he's so great 'cause he's the 'Chosen One' or whatever, it's so annoying. You know I can't stand him."
Harry dressed quickly in a smart shirt and pressed black trousers borrowed from Percy's wardrobe, his best effort to look smart at the cells.
The crack of impact was so loud Harry felt it could be heard across the castle, but louder still was his pulse roaring in his ears, pumping humiliation and fear around his body.
"How To Make A Draco?" he read aloud incredulously, and watched embarrassment and dismay replace the worry on his friend's faces. "Dior Sauvage cologne, green apple, cherrywood broom polish, fresh linen, spearmint, Draco's hair gel... what's this? And vanilla?"
Draco put his head in his hands in despair. This was even worse than he was at school. "Can't take the Chosen One anywhere," Harry heard him mutter from under his arms. Oops.
"Morning," he whispered, and Draco jumped, clearly on edge.
"Don't scream," was the first thing she said, which Draco found both infuriating and laughably ridiculous.
Harry looked around nervously. More students were pouring out of the class as they stood there, and he didn't want to risk being overheard.
In that second he understood the pain and regret in Draco's eyes and pulled him hard into an embrace, tight enough to crush him.
The sky was already ablaze with the light of a thousand spells as Harry watched Malfoy cast his first, and the ground grew hot as it was scorched against and again by light from each side. Harry ducked and weaved round the deadly bolts of light, casting spell after spell of his own, and watching with horror every time anyone fell down illuminated in green, regardless of which side they were on. Death was death, he wasn't desensitised yet.
Draco frowned. Stupid hippie bitch trying to psych him out. He headed down the stone spiral at an aggressively normal pace, so normal that he barely felt his legs go from under him at the sixth stair from the bottom. He felt the landing all right.
"I'm not going to hurt you again," Draco said awkwardly. "I ...I want you, Harry."
"It's not a joke," Draco shrugged. "It's your 'get out of jail free' card. It was all pretend, alright? You don't actually like me."
"Thinks he's too bloody good for us," Ron rolled his eyes. "Bloody Golden Boy complex again."
"Three extra weeks with Potter, eh? You'll get to spend a lot of quality time with him," she smirked.
"You take it, Harry," Neville said in a shaky voice, pushing the Veritaserum bottle towards his friend. "I think we're both aware that our antidote won't work, so at least everyone already knows all your secrets."
Harry ignored this comment. "You take advantage of me because you know I can't tell you no," he continued. "And you never do anything for me in return."
The second he was alone, Harry allowed himself to properly fall apart. He threw himself on his bed and screamed into his pillow in frustration. Fucking Malfoy, fucking Peeves, fucking feelings.
Draco stared back at him like he was mad. "Of course that's what I want, you moron! You think I've enjoyed you humping my leg like a horny puppy for the past few weeks?"
He became quickly aware of the slender hand under the table which pushed aside the length of robe material covering Harry's left thigh, revealing the dark fabric of his trousers in one firm, deliberate movement.
"It was all a trick, OK, Potter? So you can leave me alone now," he whispered. That didn't sound much better than before.
The scent of the wildflowers and the light of the early spring sun washed over them as they kissed side by side, and after a minute Malfoy pushed Harry onto his back - not roughly like usual, but as though he was precious - and Harry allowed himself to be pressed blissfully into the warm grass under the weight of the other boy's body.
How long before he could stop experiencing these memories in constant high-definition throughout the entirety of Potions class, and finally be able to stand up to leave on time without pulling fistfuls of his robes round his front?
Harry had taken to thinking about his parents a lot too in the past few weeks. He wondered if they'd have been the type to support him and give him good advice.
"Not a date," Malfoy corrected him. "A study session."
- here you go, take these with you. It looks like it's raining quite heavily."
"You made me too miserable to play," Harry snapped, but he realised after he'd said the words that they might not be as cutting as he'd thought.
"Father's going away on business for the Christmas break, and Mother's going with him," Draco snapped. "I’m gonna have to stay in this dump with homeless castoffs like Potter all break."
Harry pouted. "It's too big, I want my Gryffindor one," he complained.
"No, you don't," he said quietly.
Harry's heart fluttered. "How do I look?" he mumbled, slightly scared of what he might hear in the answer.
"Potter!" Draco screamed, terrified, but Harry only laughed as the boys hit the ground in a tangle of limbs.
Ron bid a hasty retreat back to the Gryffindor table to hide with Hermione, who was very impressed.
There was a sudden slamming sound as the library door was wrenched open so hard that it bounced against the frame, and then Harry's own 'wandering planet' hurled himself into the room like a blonde whirlwind, ramming his shoulders into bookshelf after bookshelf and leaving a loud trail of destruction behind him.
"I couldn't have even held a quill, Potter, let alone used one," he said, his voice quieter now but still with the same unkind edge. "I didn't come down off the highs for so long."
"Objection!" the prosecution lawyer whined. "This proves nothing of the sort - Mr. Potter could have wrestled the wand from your client against his will! There is no evidence whatsoever that it was deliberately thrown-"
"How about two good days, Malfoy?" he asked, his voice low but confident.
"Yes, I was aware of that, thanks Potter," Draco said. He swiped his tongue over the little cut, the blood crimson against his pale skin, and Harry's heart flipped.
"When did my life get so fucking fantastic?"
"You fought a Basilisk, Harry," Hermione pointed out incredulously. "I think you'll manage an outfit for a Christmas party."
- of Draco Malfoy. Every last drop of it. And Pansy was delighted.
"You're not still holding a grudge for the Weaslette incident, are you? Because Potter, I told you, it was non-consensual, she just went for my-"
"God, Potter," he whispered in an uncannily Malfoy-esque tone as he watched the train pull away from the station. "What's become of you?"
These are boys who have seen too much horror to ever sleep soundly again, boys who know death better than life; and the blonde crashes into the dark one by the lake and lets him wash all over him like the tide.
Making another batch of Amortentia was out of the question, of course. Snape kept all the ingredients under lock and key in the store cupboard, and Harry was already far enough on the professor's bad side that term with all his vial-smashing and running out of classes.
This particular picture of Harry was drawn with less heavy strokes than usual, that was the first thing he noticed.
"I literally wouldn't know how to do that even if I wanted to," was Harry's reply, which effectively ended the conversation for the time being.
"Leaving so soon, Potter?" asked the boy that he loved, taking the lollipop smoothly from Harry's mouth and replacing it in his hand with a glass of something shiny. "At least stay for a drink. You don't want to be rude now, do you?"
Thinking about it, he felt as though he still despised the other boy, but there was no way that the batch he'd brewed with Hermione had been anything other than perfect, and who was he to argue with the love potion?
When Harry returned to his own dorm that morning, the sight of Draco Malfoy lounging on the end of his bed did little to make him feel less stressed.
He'd got about as far as the halfway point when he felt a weight crash heavily into him from behind, and began to tumble down in a spiral of green and scarlet.
him!"
He'd been so proud of that position and had been unchallenged on it for several years, yet now Malfoy had deprived him of even that with his cruelty.
Harry should've known Ron wouldn't understand what he meant.
"Staring at something, Potter?" he lashed out at the dark-haired boy, who was sat, open-mouthed with horror at the scene that had unfolded. "Wanna lick it off my mouth?"
, he wrote back quickly.
"God, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him," muttered Harry angrily as the water cascaded over his face.
Pansy's eyes brimmed with guilty tears. "Draco, it was just a joke that got out of hand," she whispered. "We didn't know Potter would react as much as he did!"
"I'm sorry, Harry," he tried out the phrase. It felt foreign on his tongue, an unfamiliar roll, so he tried again. "I'm sorry," he said, "I'm so sorry.... Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
Draco bit his lip. "No, you're not," he said angrily. "I should've thought before I pushed you."
Hermione sighed in satisfaction as she watched him storm out of the room. Malfoy always seemed to be able to uncannily appear wherever Harry was, hopefully today would be no exception and that weird sixth sense would kick in.
"No, Malfoy, I know what it is," Harry snapped. "It's your fucking ego every time, and I don't want to fuel it any longer. I refuse to cry over you again."
"This subject's owlshite," he announced loudly as Trelawney handed round glass orbs. "My father thinks it's appalling we have to spend time learning this crap when we could be doing something we might actually use in our lives. He says it's all made up nonsense to give aging single hippies something to do other than smoke Tumbleweed and cry."
Draco looked at him with a slightly scornful frown. "Oh, yeah. And you can if it's powdered up. I'm sorry I assumed you'd know what 'fairy wine' was, Potter. It should be hitting by now."
he thought
he wrote.
"Think of something you want to do," Malfoy countered, sliding his rings onto his fingers, "And tell me. And I might think about it. Ok?"
"I just don't understand why you're surprised, Harry," Hermione was saying with a gentle rub of Harry's back. "I mean, Malfoy's always like this to you. You can't still be shocked every time he's a..."
"Sometimes I swear the same," Harry agreed.
Malfoy shrugged, feigning nonchalance again although inside he was panicking. "I don't know," he replied truthfully.
Cunning didn't suit her, Draco noticed. Made her look even Weaslier. God, how had Potter banged that?
Draco's whole mind lit up in anguish, a deep, inexplicable, blazing pain that stopped his heart for several beats.
He wondered how long it would be before the memories of that evening stopped flashing through his mind like a constant show - how long, for example, before he forgot how it felt to have his bare chest pushed up against the cold changing room lockers as the boy he adored finished roughly inside him, gripping onto the locker above Harry's head for stability as he did so and emitting a groan Harry had previously only ever heard in his wildest fantasies-
Draco made sure that they fell so he was on top again, and brought his legs up so he was straddling Harry's lap on the bed. He ground his hips down in quick, circular motions, and was pleased to hear a gasp against his mouth.
"Is that seriously what you've been so moody about?" he demanded. "That I didn't say
Harry made no reply, so Draco answered himself: "Oh yeah, you, you, and you. Plus you went round the whole school telling everyone you were in love with me, which is tragic."
As he spoke Harry could see the telltale red stain on Draco's tongue from the sweets he liked, the ones he used for his oral fixation and grinding when high, and the sight irritated him greatly. Once he'd thought it was pretty; now it was a sign of Malfoy's carelessness and self-destruction, a symbol of everything Harry hated.
"I see," mused the Judge. "And how long have you known the defendant?"
"Please don't," Harry whispered weakly, conjuring a light wall between them which Malfoy promptly broke down with his own wand.
"Ssh now angel, daddy's here, but you need to go back to sleep," Harry whispered, stroking strands of soft dark hair off his daughter's flushed little face.
Harry tried to steady his breathing.
He looked as though the words hurt him as much to say as they hurt Draco to hear. Both boys drew a shaky breath; they got the feeling that what Harry was going to say next would hurt. And it did, but he forced it out anyway like barbed wire over his tongue.
Malfoy looked away, suddenly slightly awkward. "Why do you ask?"
The lights were flickering prettily orange over their work, they each had a mug of cocoa to sip while they worked, and Hermione was testing Harry on material for a test the following afternoon.
Then one day in late May, Draco did come home to him.
"Eyes up here, slag," he said gently, and Draco looked up in mock surprise.
Hateful, useless boy. What good was bullying when the victim decided he liked it?
"I know you won't," Harry replied. "And I know you do. But it isn't enough."
Hermione pounced, ripping the duvet down to reveal Malfoy's face and torso and ignoring the disgusted protests.
"POTTER!" he screamed; Harry's reflexes kicked in and he leapt from Hagrid's arms and caught the sailing wand in his right hand. Draco hurled himself in front of Harry's body as the world exploded with light, and the two of them crashed to the floor together in a small explosion of their own.
"I don't know why I do."
"If we're going to do this," Malfoy continued, "You have got to learn to stop sharing every thought that comes into your damn head!"
"Can I?" he whispered, and Harry nodded.
"I want him to ram his tongue down my
Malfoy tried to interrupt, but Harry was having none of it. He felt powerful above Malfoy, whose face was shadowed by the arch of Harry's body and grimaced under his painful touch.
"Have you ever loved someone as much as I love you?" Harry panted as he got close, screwing up his eyes as though it hurt him to think about it.
"Yes," Malfoy replied with a cruel and distant smile, "I'm a very irresponsible and badly behaved little rich boy. But what's the point in an inheritance if I can't spend it on drugs? That's what I say."
"Shit, that's awkward," Draco bit his lip. "I was gonna think about Dobby and now I feel bad...FUCK, what was that for? Bastard."
The early morning rays dappled through the panes of the corridor's windows and bathed Draco's figure in silken gold as he walked, glimmering celestially off every blonde hair on his head. The soft light washed over his bare hands too, for once without his heavy rings as they peeked out of his robes, and the delicacy of the golden hue made them seem close to fragile.
Pansy and Blaise shared a pointed look, which didn't go unseen by the angry blonde.
"Granger asked me to give you this," said Draco quietly when he reached the other boy, shoving the armful of now-sodden robes at him and flinching at the brief skin contact as though he'd never touched him before. Which, he supposed, he probably hadn't. Not like this, anyway, not so neutrally.
"You could live in colour like this forever, you know," he said quietly, and he slid the pages out from behind Harry's head, so that colourless drawing-Harry and real-Harry stared up at him as one.
"But I hadn't even thought about it before I said it out loud to you, do you know that?" Draco asked. "How do you undo me so completely?"
"Nothing," said Pansy sweetly. "Just about to watch the world burn."
"This is the real me, baby."
After the hell of the past few months, Harry would take the title of "companion" with more than approval.
Even the ones who had testified against Draco for his bullying, even the ones who still hated him to his core: everyone was on their feet and protesting his innocence.

"Sorry, Malfoy, darling," Blaise said mock-sympathetically. "If you didn't listen the first fifteen times, we aren't telling you now."
"You make all the decisions, every time. And sometimes you make this decision, and you pretend you can't help it, but nobody else rams that powder up your nose for you, or sticks it on your tongue, or spikes your drink with it! You consciously decide to do it yourself!"
"Only if you mean it," he whispered. "Don't say it if you aren't sure."
Harry noticed the hunger underlying the menace in those grey eyes, and felt wretched to the pit of his stomach. It looked like even now Malfoy wanted him, and he was getting hard to resist.
He kept Draco's Christmas present under his bed, still in its brown paper with the little handwritten card attached, and now again he would pull it out to re read it and catalyse a fresh cycle of self-hatred. It wasn't particularly mushy - just 'D, Happy Christmas. H.' - but just the thought that Harry had wanted to give it to Malfoy embarrassed him now, made him feel weak and silly.
It was during one of Harry's nightly study sessions that all Hell finally broke loose.
"I've barely touched you and you know it," Harry said disdainfully. "Certainly less than you've touched me."
"What are we doing today?" he asked.
And with that, he catapulted a heaped spoonful of piping hot sticky porridge straight into Draco's face.
He closed his eyes, and pictured Draco running away to live his life for a while. Where would he have gone? Not the Manor, of course, that wasn't home to him any more. Not with his parents in Azkaban.
