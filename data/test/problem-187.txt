"You scrub up well, Potter."
"Ah. I'm sorry mate. Everything has to be so official, doesn't it?" Harry turned back to the chopping board, his friend's weirdness slowly drifting from his mind.
“Like the other night, Nagini turned into a toy snake.”
“Guys?” Harry asked, putting his hand on Luna’s arm gently. She didn’t move. “Tonks?” He waved his hand in front of her face. Still, she didn’t look at him, she barely even blinked. He could hear his blood rushing in his ears as pure panic threatened to suffocate him. “Hello?” He raised his voice over the music, searching for someone who can hear him. A scuffle behind him made him spin around, taking in the hobbled frame of Bathilda Bagshot.
“And that’s your cat?” Harry pointed at the feline, his brain still trying to catch up.
“Draco! Don’t lash out at Harry for something out of his control.” Luna reprimanded.
“Great.” Draco took out a business card and handed it to the other man. “Owl me.”
He ignored the feeling, not wanting to embarrass himself further by revealing his feelings to the other man.
“Harry?” A familiar voice chimed, and Harry felt his heart stutter. He turned around, gazing into the warmth of Draco’s grey eyes.
Harry rushed to his feet, reaching out to grab his arm. “Where are you going?”
“Fucking hell.” Harry stuttered, his mind reeling. So this WAS a date! And not only that, Malfoy wanted to go on another one? Wait. Harry rewound the conversation in his head. Did Malfoy just say they should get a room?!
“Thanks.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“True.” Pansy conceded. “But you took me to the Yule Ball. And you kissed Daphne, don’t you remember?”
“I’ll catch you later, Harry. Malfoy.” Neville waved goodbye, nodding at the Slytherin.
"Great! I'll owl you the details later!" He waved eagerly and set off at a jog.
"You're resigning?" Matthews had frowned at him over his glasses.
"I said I'd get it, you pillock." He pulled out his own wallet as Potter snorted.
“You don’t have to thank me, Harry.” Luna said with a gentle lilt to her voice as she squeezed his arm. The two stood bundled against the chill outside of Grottes aux Remèdes. “I’m sure I won’t be needed. Dear Draco can just get easily overwhelmed at the moment.”
He wished he could cheer Pansy up… Looking over to his desk where the list sat, Draco perked up.
“What in Merlin’s name are you doing? You can’t go back now.” She hissed to her son.
The two men watched her walk away before Draco turned back to Harry, suddenly anxious. What would happen now?
He topped up his tea with a splash of milk. “Remember to let Lucy out if she’s pacing by the back door.” Sadly, he couldn’t charm the back door to allow her free access, the dangers of fame far too real to breach the wards that way.
PLEASE DO NOT SKIP, AS THIS CHAPTER HAS SOME HELLA CUTE, HELLA ANGSTY STUFF THAT YOU NEED TO READ!!
Potter made a funny face and licked at his icecream. "Don't even start, Malfoy."
“It appears so.” Draco murmured, reaching down to stroke Lucy gently. “Bonjour, ma chérie.” He whispered.
Draco hummed to himself as he began about making his coffee, accioing the morning newspaper and levitating it just in front of him. There wasn’t much new; a supposed sighting of a Norwegian Ridgeback - and two further pages discussing the ethicalities of Dragon rearing, an interview with the Weird Sisters about their upcoming tour, no less than seven pages detailing the upcoming quidditch season, a gossip column about Kingsley Shacklebolt’s ‘DILF’ status, and not surprisingly - a dredged out speculative piece about everyone’s favourite Golden Boy; Harry Potter.
“I’m good, great actually. That’s why I’m here.”  Harry looked down, fiddling with his fingers. Why was it suddenly so hard to talk? Malfoy was just the same prick that he’d known for the past eight years.
She nodded, giving a small snort at his puppy theatrics. “But make sure the shirt is a summery colour, the weather is finally nice now.”
He rolled them over, pinning Draco's hands above his head. Draco could just about hear a small voice over the sound of his heartbeat saying that it was good they'd walked so far along the river - there was only one other person around and he was dozing on a blanket 30 feet away.
Mr Moors sat down behind the desk, gesturing to the chair opposite him.  "Please, sit."
Draco hummed thankfully, sitting up carefully so as not to anger his throbbing head further. “Less of a bitch.” He murmured. He sipped at it, the warmth of it easing a bit of the tension in his body. “What time is it?”
"Another bottle of the '96 Elf Merlot; you can charge it to my vault." Draco slid across a piece of parchment with his vault details on it. After finishing his first bottle of the ridiculously overpriced drink, he had decided that he deserved another. His pale cheeks held a slight pink tint, and his ears were tipped with red, though he supposed it would take another glass for the slurring to become noticeable, and another glass after that before his hiccups would start.
"Well, yeah." He shrugged. "When we're not trying to bash each other’s heads in, we get along surprisingly well."
“To be honest, I don’t even know what the party is for.”
A lone woman bustled about the quiet shop, her shaking hands hurrying to package up the pills for her next customer. She was finally going to do it, after all these years. The very knowledge of what was about to happen had her heart hammering in her throat; an eager sense of anticipation.
Pansy snorted. "You know full well that won't be happening after what happened last time. No, this is far more exciting." Draco rolled his eyes at Pansy; most things Magda said were "exciting".
“-just through here.”
“You’re not being serious-”
Draco frowned down at him. “Are you alright?”
“Pansy!”
Harry leaned across the table towards him. "Definitely."
"Why?"
Potter cleared his throat, suddenly very interested in looking at everything but Draco. “Yeah, she said something about a new, um, a new potion? For nightmares?” He looked back at the blond, holding Draco’s gaze for only a second before looking away again. The Slytherin was taken aback by the sudden vulnerability he saw there.
Harry felt like he was floating, his whole body light as he laughed. How had it taken him so long to realise? He’d always thought Draco was beautiful, but fancying him had never really crossed his mind. He’d always thought he was straight, but now… Was he gay? Bisexual? He didn’t know. All he knew was that this was the happiest he’d been in a while. It all made sense now, the heat between them when they argued, the looks he’d caught from Draco, the butterflies. This is what they were meant to be all along.
“Not this one, it’s only been developed in the past couple of months. It uses the good bit of your subconscious to fight the anxious part. I think you should try it.” Luna paused, smiling at Harry in a way that made him think she knew he would try it, if only for her. “Go to Grotte aux Remèdes at the far end of Diagon Alley and say I sent you.”
"Just say you want to meet at that muggle cafe you always go to."
"Where are we?"
When their laughs died down, they watched each other for a moment. Draco reached up to cup Harry’s cheek. “We should probably get out and dry off, my mother will be making a toast soon.” He said quietly. Harry placed his hand over Draco’s and nodded. They got out, casting some quick drying spells.
Harry cleared his throat. “Coffee would be good.”
"It's okay, Harry."
“Oh, shut up.” Harry smirked. “Come on, we need to go through these papers.”
“Don’t even get me started. I’ve been assigned to this prick, Peters. He smells like stale sweat and cheesy feet.”
Harry watched this all from a distance, his relationship with Draco no more than friendly acquaintances. He didn’t know if he wanted more. He was content just to see the other boy happy for once.
The blond sputtered for a moment, avoiding Harry's eyes. "I - I assumed we, were, um, well, that we were dating?" It came out as a question more than a statement.
"It was a favour! I didn't have to do it!" Potter replied, pushing Malfoy back again.
Harry took a deep breath, taking a large swig of his tea as if it could give him the same willpower as something stronger. He'd faced worse than a gossiping, middle-aged witch. "After the war, like many people, I suffered from long term after-effects." He started, taking another breath.
“Tell that to the legions of women across the country.” Draco jokes, using his fingers to knead at the base of Harry’s neck. “I want to call you a silly git, because of how obviously and unbelievably fantastic you are. But I know it’s not your fault.” He pauses, whispering his next words like a secret. “It really is kind of rude how fantastic you are though, you should really think about sharing some of it with the rest of us.”
“Don’t stress about Paeson, she might seem scary but she’s a good woman.”
“Oh, you know. The same as always. My old hens come round and talk my ear off, and this cheeky boy has me wrapped around his finger.” She smiled at Teddy as he toddled over to his toy box, pulling out a toy dog.
Harry had saved him that day, after all the viciousness of their school life. After all the years of hexes and jinxes, all the bullying. Draco had been screwed from the day he met Harry Potter. He had been destined to fall for a boy who would never love him back. And now, as men, they had a chance. A chance to fall in love, a chance to be together, to forgive and forget, to move on, to learn and grow.
“Merlin, I never thought I’d hear you say that.”
“Oh, shove off.” The blond replied, spinning on his heel to walk away. But Harry wasn’t having it, grabbing him by the sleeve and pulling him close. He backed him against the wall, smirking up at him.
Harry Potter nodding to Draco whenever they passed each other in the hallways of the Ministry. These days, those small acknowledgements rarely happened. Draco supposed they were both just too busy.
She raised her eyebrow at him. "And who's that?"
"Love? Can you bring me my wand?" Harry called from the garden.
He was wearing exactly what Ron and Hermione had said, a light peachy button up and jeans, with his nicest pair of shoes.
The blond’s heart stuttered. “Harry?” He whispered. He opened the door further, taking a couple of steps inside. “Harry?” He asked again, louder.
“Really? I’m not so sure I want to go.”
Chapter 2
Grimmauld Place was finally starting to feel more like home, but it still gave him the creeps. When he’d moved in he had magicked a door at the bottom of the stairs to the second floor, cutting the house in half. The once-grand house was huge, spanning six floors including the basement and attic, with seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, a library, formal dining room, drawing room, and more. In its hay day it would have hosted the most prestigious families of the wizarding world, welcoming them to dinner and parties. It was far too big with just him there, but by only using the first three floors and a new fluffy best friend, it was at least a little less daunting. The first floor had his own room, a bathroom, a spare room and what had once been the drawing room. Now the lounge and study combined, it had a big leather sofa and matching armchairs, a TV, far too many blankets and cat toys, a box of his godson's toys and books, as well as a desk and bookshelf stacked with all the books that couldn’t fit in Ron and Hermione’s flat.
“Alright, see you in a minute.” Harry called over his shoulder, going over to the fireplace.
Hermione giggled at the picture that her boyfriend’s wild gestures created. They turned the corner to find the subjects of their conversation pressed against the wall to their left, lips crashing together as their hands crept under each other’s robes.
"You're being too nice."
Draco feels Harry give a gentle, watery laugh and his heart does somersaults. “Shut up.”
“At yours?”
"With Rita Skeeter!" Draco said, his voice unusually high.
“Just forget about it mate.” Ron slapped him on the shoulder. “We’re gonna miss the carriages, come on.”
This couldn’t be happening, not really. This must be another dream, Harry thought. But as Malfoy stared into his eyes, his breaths shallow, asking permission, Harry found that he didn’t care. If this was a dream, he didn’t want it to end.
“Master Potter. Master Malfoy is requesting to see you.”
Harry watched helplessly as his best friend stepped towards him. “If you had died, none of this would have happened!” The darker boy tried to speak, but his voice caught in his throat. All he could do was watch as Ron strode towards him, shouting, Hermione’s screams still violently ravaging the air. He had to go, he had to leave, to run, to be the coward he knew he was.
"Um..Yeah?" It came out more like a question.
“Absolument pas (absolutely not)! You’re so good with him, Draco. Although your language could use a bit of work." She looked at him pointedly. He smiled bashfully.
The two pushed their way through the crowd, and Draco closed his eyes to the music, losing himself to it. He lifted his arms and swayed his hips, laughing to himself. The bodies pressed in tighter, everyone against each other. Draco opened his eyes to find Pansy winking at him, signaling to a tall brunette at the bar.
"You're going to what?"
“How’s work? Has the Ministry crumbled under the pressure of the brightest witch of our age yet?”
“Is that so?” Malfoy crossed his legs, resting his arm over the back of the chair.
"Yeah, no, really." He smiled to himself as he sliced the bacon. "I spent the afternoon working with Draco and Luna at the shop."
"I'm fine, Professor." He lied.
Harry plonked himself down, ignoring her and turning to Neville. “What’s going on with you and Malfoy?”
“I never said you weren’t a cock, you bloody tosspot." The darker man sighed. "But that doesn’t mean you’re immune from mistakes, or from forgiveness.” Harry’s voice softened as he said this.
He thrust gently, moaning with Potter as he picked up his speed. "Shit, Harry."
"I think I'm gay." He looked between them. "Or bisexual or whatever."
“Potter,” Malfoy says, and swallows.
Harry smiles and drops a kiss on Draco’s hand, between two bony knuckles.
They pass the section of wall that is only drywall and torn wallpaper from where Harry had ripped away the portrait of Walburga Black. Malfoy raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment further.
The next day, he’s seated at the breakfast table in the solarium, perusing the newspaper but mostly thinking about Potter when he appears again. Between a second and the next, Potter sits in front of him, arms crossed over his chest.
Harry goes. The water burns his bruised knuckles when he passes them under the tap, joints made tender by hits and a vigorous healing. Harry hesitates there, in front of his mirror, blood washed away in pink ribbons of water. He looks at his wedding ring and is afraid to take it off; he feels the mark warm under his consideration.
“Oh, Potter, we’re not barbarians. The Manor has been fitted to accommodate some technology. I must say that your friend Weasley’s invention, Magikvision, is a great improvement to our home.”
! It’s your birthday!” she laughs. And then, far louder, over her shoulder and directly into Ron’s innocent ear, “Maybe a Bellini?”
Ginny makes a face.
“I don’t think you’re gonna have much choice when Scorpius asks you.”
Harry has already left for work, so he stands there for what feels like a minute, but what is actually a good hour, up until Tommy walks in and asks him “Alright, mate?”
“God, someone, bring me a drink.”
“Your source… You asked Parkinson for the info.”
Around eight pm, Draco has shaken off the worst of the surprise and is slowly making his way to proving his theory.
“But fear not, most of Wizarding Britain seems to think you are excellent hero worship material.”
The man stops in his tracks and turns to look at him.
Draco takes offence to that, but doesn’t say anything, just stares and watches Harry laugh at him. He has never been that good at comebacks.
Blue Apartment, Lodging for Magical Persons, New York, USA.
But there was no one to sit him down, pat his back and inform him that his wolf-self would turn out to make the dumbest decisions one could ever settle on.
“No?”
“Alright?” says Draco.
From Draco Lucius Malfoy
“Sod off, Potter.”
“What? Why? Isn’t it supposed to do that?”
May 28, 2001
“My father,” Draco answers truthfully. He cannot catch it now that it’s out of his mouth.
Malfoy hesitates for a moment, then reaches out to take Harry’s glasses off, slow and uncertain. Harry blinks as the world becomes blurry; he has to look away to push back the emotion welling in his chest.
“How did you arrive here?”
Draco Malfoy.
He has to fight the instinct to hide it immediately. The primary dot there has grown since the last time he took off his wedding band and has become an incomplete line, curving around his finger, like a partial shadow of his own ring. Harry has not confided in anyone about it. It doesn’t seem important, not deadly, just a bad reminder of another time. He’s almost sure that the stain has something to do with Voldemort’s death and so he keeps silent. He doesn’t want to talk about it. If he ignores it, it doesn’t exist.
Harry shrugs; he feels himself flush.
No one wants to touch a werewolf. Harry grits his teeth, but doesn’t say anything and pulls his hands behind his back, nods instead.
It’s their sixth day together when Draco realizes he has been shagging Harry Potter. The epiphany hits him as he’s pouring cereal into a puddle of milk, and he shakes with the force of it.
Silently, Potter turns around, tugs on Draco’s sleeve to get him to walk. The cloud churns above, low over the leaves and the wind picks up, sends Draco’s hair in his face, fast and stinging.
“Thanks for picking them up, by the way. You saved me.”
Malfoy opens his mouth to complain; McGonagall raises a hand to stop him in his tracks.
The nights are nippy this time of the year and the meadow Harry has chosen for this is swept by great gusts of chilly wind, but Draco only laughs uproariously at him, gleeful, and casts a tight warming charm over them both. It helps and Harry stops sniffling.
“What do you want?” asks Draco, incapable of tone.
“Very well.”
“Only posh people would make it colder for themselves.”
He rolls his eyes, and Harry feels like Malfoy picked it up from him, from their exasperated encounters in the blue kitchen, hiding away from the kids. The realisation rolls nervously in his stomach.
“Haven’t you heard? I’m the flower girl.”
No courting happens, then.
He only realizes that he’s asleep when Ginny wakes him up by poking his feet with her long frigid fingers. Harry shudders and pushes them away from her prying digits.
“Yes, Scorpius has non-binary friends. I’m familiar with the term.”
They spend a long time standing, just looking, just breathing.
He disappears upstairs, where Draco has never been, but knows Tommy’s room is. He hears some banging around before Tommy descends and shoves some papers in his hands and some plastic sticks.
Astoria looks beautifully regal in a blue gown, her chestnut hair gathered in a high ponytail, away from her face. She smiles down at Lily and holds out her hands to accompany the last of her hesitant steps.
“I’m sorry.”
Potter shrugs.
Harry looks to the building entrance and finds an outlined figure in the lit doorway.
“Hi,” Draco says, with false shyness.
“You already do.”
Harry’s tea is strong, almost cutting in sharpness and he smiles around the rim of his teacup, feeling warm and doted over. Draco likes his morning cuppa light and mellow, to begin the day with a small ripple, ease himself into the water. Harry likes to be awakened by the caffeine equivalent of a freight-train. It heats something squirmy in his chest in the knowledge that Draco brewed him a cup of tea he considers vile.
Pub night tonight?
Pansy looks properly miffed at that; she pinches his bicep sharply with her nails.
“No, they have work. I’m staying for a while anyway.”
Draco smiles gently at them, holding out a hand; Harry takes it gratefully. They breathe there, simply holding on for the longest time.
Professor McGonagall looks at him for a long moment, searching his face. She finally nods and continues on walking. The door in front of which she stops lets filter through whispers of conversations. Professor McGonagall lets out a long-suffering sigh and knocks.
Nothing seems clearer to Harry at this moment that he wants to witness it every day for the rest of his life.
“I think the Wizarding World at large would excuse Harry for missing out on a few funerals. Nobody is paying attention to who is going to those any more. Especially with the (Death Eaters’) trials starting. He could take a break and have a bit of a lie-in,” a witch who wishes to remain anonymous adds.
“Yeah,” Harry says. “Greenhand incident. He’s the son-in-law. The evidence is circumstantial, but it should be enough to get approved for Veritaserum.”
Harry feels himself tense.
“Merlin’s saggy balls, is that…”
“Well, I thankfully knew nothing of my father’s sexual proclivities,” she says it with a grimace, “but I knew him well enough to know he would never leave before his time. He found too much satisfaction in making everyone around him slightly less happy.”
No one dances under the next full moon either, because by then the reporters have gotten wind of where Harry’s proclivities lay and they’re now crowding the Manor’s doorstep, chimneys and windows but not his pipes because Draco is a talented, if vicious, spellcaster.
Nobody answers.
“How did Scorpius know?” Harry asks, wetting his lips nervously.
“Well, I’m not used to accepting such invitations, if you’re worried about that.”
The bed is unmade and even easier to fall into for it. Harry pushes his shirt over his head and hears it rip over his shoulder; he’s too mad with lust to care, and the distant thought of torn seams is replaced by the need to get closer to Draco, join him on the sheets.
“Draco, you fool! Have they taken all of your money?”
“Hello, Potter,” he says, as distanced as he can.
“Is that where it’s from?” he asks, looking pained and raw.
That makes the intruder smile. He tries to bite it back, but it only infuriates Draco further.
Dear Mother,
Harry is well on his way to being drunk and lets his body sway to the music, lets hands – large, steady – grab his hips and bring him closer. The beat thrums deep at the back of his head; Seamus laughs in his ear and goes away once more, probably to snog a stranger in a corner.
Draco wets his lips and looks above Harry’s shoulders, in the safety of the non-judgemental white of the wall.
Ron sighs. “Alright. I thought I had stopped doing unnecessary paperwork for you, but it looks like I was wrong.”
It happens again. And again. And again.
Harry clears his throat.
For a long moment, he stands unmovable in the center of his living room, a cup of tea in hand. He’s barefoot, toes rasping against the worn carpet and doesn’t know what to do with this new development. Then the knock rings again across his house and Harry has to do something.
“I have no idea why you are so surprised,” says Malfoy with a neat little shrug. “I was not.”
Andromeda gives him a sympathetic smile, takes a few steps closer until she is standing right next to him and squeezes his arm. He feels comfort seeps into his clothes with her warmth and he wants to cling close, leech on it for the rest of the day. Andromeda gives him a small smile and lets her hand fall to her side.
Harry rubs at his forehead, feels the relief of his scar. They fall silent.
He stands up swiftly, and his fork clatters noisily to the floor.
Men passes them by. Draco gives a full body flinch but they do not see them.
“It’s alright, it’s alright,” Harry pets his hair, pushes it away from his face. “We don’t have to ever come back. Regular Britain is maybe not magic, but it’s alright. It’s alright. We can make it work.”
Harry takes it from his hand and smooths his hair back to appease him. He laughs one of his delighted laughs. Harry kisses his forehead and does the same to James when he begins to pout.
Draco tugs him by the hand. They get married.
Malfoy looks back at him speculatively.
When he comes back the day after, there is no sign of them. Not even a petal. Draco feels worry bubble up in his throat, but he swallows it back down and goes on with his day. He repeats to himself, that if there had been an intruder, the wards would have alerted him. It doesn’t reassure him.
“So, huh. Been on any gay dates recently?”
He begins to walk, out of the alley and on to a busy London street. Harry feels out of place with his red Auror coat, but Malfoy tugs on his elbow and they stride purposefully between people.
“We are having pork roast for dinner, tonight.”
Harry looks heavenward, through his charm where fat drops of rain crash at regular intervals. The sound of it is soothing, but not quite enough to drone out Malfoy’s pretentiousness.
He rubs his face vigorously with his hands, glasses askew on his forehead.
“Well,” he wets his lips. “Merlin’s hairy balls, I think we’re in the middle of a bonding ritual.”
With growing dread, he opens the door. Malfoy looks back at him.
Harry has spent the last two hours surrounded by Malfoy’s scent; it’s a heady note traveling in the space between them.
“Alright,” Malfoy says, adjusting the pleat of his coat. “She’s waiting for us, let’s go.”
Instead, it’s the way James talks about them, the lazy drawls of his vowels when he says “he, my dad, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, best damn man in this sodden country,” when Harry comes back early one evening and he has friends over. His Hogwarts crowd.
“Right,” he says, when the silence has stretched for too long between them.
He doesn’t leave a breath for Harry to answer and twists around to hail a waitress. They have a long-distance discussion about teapots from what Harry gathers from their gestures before the anthracite settles on him again.
When Scorpius finally has enough and tugs Albus with him for experimenting, Draco is left once more with Potter. He feels his gaze like a burn on the side of his face, from his temple to his jaw.
Wandless magic is easier that Harry expected. Everyone had made a big deal out of it, but after two weeks of nonstop practice and too little sleep, he has his dishes washing themselves with the swish of a hand. It makes him wonder if he would not have been actually good in school if he had been a little less threatened by Voldemort.
Harry stands, feels the trip of his heartbeat as his own. He doesn’t have to think about it; that is the sound of a lie.
Malfoy tips his head in acknowledgment, and Harry closes the connection. He hurriedly leaps up the stairs to get ready.
As if on cue, Draco Malfoy pops his head from over the bed, looking barely awake, cheeks creased by his pillowcase.
“I’m going to take a bath, you can ask Mimpsy to dress the table,” he says with too much firmness.
Harry desperately tries to calm the flush of his face.
“You know it’s called F.A.2L.I.C, don’t you?” he says, pushing back into Harry’s space and pining him to the mattress with a leg thrown out, going to straddle him.
Ron answers with a goofy one.
Later, after he has slept, he will remember this encounter as a dream. He will sit in Ginny’s bed, sticky with the sweat of a summer night, and remember the bitter taste of Malfoy’s war crimes. It will roll on his tongue and fester there, until he swallows it down and remembers, often and at length, that Draco Malfoy was a kid and a coward.
Harry stops next to him and nudges a rock with the toe of his trainers, looking thoughtful and distant.
Scorpius is getting better, even if it’s very slow. His doctors are hopeful. You would think that they should be more involved than hopeful with all the money we pay them, but no such luck yet. At least, he has stopped coughing up blood since he’s begun his treatment and if you can believe it, we are to start experimenting with Muggle medication. Apparently, a blood-thinning curse shares symptoms with serious Muggle ailments.
“Ever presented a bag of Hippogriff’s manure to me?”
Draco looks alright, interested even and so Harry gives up on pretending he understands anything and just waits for Draco to solve things. If things need solving; Harry is not sure about that. He had barely gotten a few words in when Draco had begun to ramble about the circumstances of their bonding.
One morning, no particular to any other in any way, he simply decides to learn wandless magic. It seems like something to do and occupy himself with, so he gets a few books about it from the Black library and settles down in front of the fireplace to study.
Draco swallows the initial hurt and rolls his eyes; he crosses his arms in front of his chest.
Harry knows they come here to see friends, but he cannot fight against the knot in his throat, lodged high enough that he feels it every time he swallows. He has never once come back since the War and the first time Draco shyly betrayed Voldemort. He has dreaded coming here with his kids and dissolving into acrid panic.
They’re sticky with sweat by the time morning rolls around, pink-blue dawn through the curtains.
“Harry. Malfoy,” he nods at them in turn.
Harry desperately wants to; he’s reaching for Draco and pressing him back in the mattress in a breath.
Malfoy huffs a breath.
Harry takes a deep breath over his cup and tries to focus on the notes of bergamot rather than Malfoy’s proximity. He can hear his heartbeat, a steady and comforting thrum close enough to ease the adrenaline out of him.
“Okay well, give me a sec.”
“What about his daughter? He has one, right?”
Harry James Potter dies at forty-three in the line of duty. The newspapers report a stray spell hitting him right in the chest and three days of agony spent in Saint Mungo before he passes away on a bright Saturday morning, with his family and close friends by his side.
“I thought,” Hermione pauses to sigh heavily and swallows half of her glass with a wince. “I thought you would come talk to us if you had issues with Ginny.”
Malfoy stands and comes closer. Harry’s hair stands on end on his arms; he has to fight himself not to lean in Malfoy’s space. He resolutely squares his jaw and crosses his arms in front of him, not looking away from the clipping.
Potter huffs a breath.
Malfoy makes a noise of contentment that Harry refuses to process, and bites playfully at the exposed line of his throat. Harry closes his eyes on it, shivers. Malfoy huffs a breath in answer.
And he does, without letting Ron say another word.
Harry wakes with a start. His body feels like it’s burning from the inside.
“Merlin, look at them,” says Malfoy too close, breathing hotly at Harry temple, quiet and secret. “Nothing should be as adorable as this.”
“Wanna go again?” he asks.
Harry looks to the heavens for an answer and finds none, only the ceiling stained by questionable substances.
Draco’s eyes widen.
The snake uncoils and slithers up Draco’s finger, until it spools in Harry’s waiting palm and turns on himself once more, becoming a simple ring.
“Ah, so Ginny told Ron.”
“You can’t really say you’re free of kids. Scorpius and Albus are here.”
Best wishes,
Instead of doing that, Draco sees him wag his tail.
“Listen,” Malfoy says with a quiet wince. “I hate to admit it, but I need help on this case. I’ve been stuck for the better part of six months, and I refuse to drop it.”
“No, don’t look!” screams James in his ear. “Draco is outside and you can see him from here.”
“Sorry,” Harry says quickly, relenting his grip.
“Yes, never mind. Let’s do something simple. A First Year spell maybe.” Draco takes a second to think; he’s learned from experience that something too big pushes Harry to his flight instincts, so nothing explosive or too impressive for his muggle-addled mind. “Alright, how do you feel about a Levitation spell?”
“Actually, yes. Lately he’s been trying to plan how to get Scorpius to school with him without your knowledge. Don’t be surprised if he requests that you send him there.”
Harry wrinkles his nose at the imagery.
He shakes his wrist, and Malfoy’s follows.
“I want to understand why my son is an orphan, but not yours any more.”
“I’m sure she is,” mutters Draco almost too quietly to be heard.
“It has everything to do with Edward. I am his family. I deserve as much respect as you do.”
“Who? I don’t know anyone with a phontely.”
When he straightens out, Harry sees drops of water run down the white length of Malfoy’s throat. Harry doesn’t mean to, but nothing seems real any more, so Harry chases the drops with his fingers bringing water back to Malfoy’s lips. Malfoy’s breath fans on Harry’s finger, and for a second, he thinks he’s mad, Everything is dream-slow, caramel-sticky, and not even his wild heartbeat can bring him back down to earth.
Harry turns to him and takes a step closer; Draco pulls him in closer by the hand. He’s so close that he can feel Harry’s breath on his face and he bends down slightly, until his nose is touching Harry’s cheek, sharing air.
Malfoy fixes him with a long heated look, leaning on the counter for support.
The wet drag of Harry’s lips is a burn against Draco’s. It blows on the embers sitting quietly in his gut and they flare up in flames, orange of fury and red of lust. He fists the ugly t-shirt Harry always wears and tugs him closer again, feels himself moan when hands press in the burning heat of his body.
Harry snorts and waits expectantly.
“I have to go back to work,” says Harry, and the sigh that follows doesn’t betray his enthusiasm.
“It’s comfortable here. Warm.”
Pansy gives him enough breathing room to stand up; he finally turns and indulges himself in a brief, firm embrace. He doesn't want her to know how much he missed her in the short two weeks he has spent away from their world, but it’s a comfort to hold her close and breathe in the scent of her expensive jasmine perfume. It settles the floating anxiety in his chest.
Harry grips his shoulder firmly and pulls a chair out to sit next to him. He doesn’t stop touching him.
“Jesus, are you not going to put a hat on?”
“What?”
“You think you’re better than us, don’t you?” he screams over his friend’s shoulder who is trying to get him to settle down.
It happens a month later.
Malfoy scoffs and hides behind a hand, rubs at his forehead nervously. “Of course you did.”
Minerva McGonagall,
Harry exhales heavily and drinks again.
“You could stay a lot longer than dinner,” Draco says softly, to the ceiling above.
“It’s not necessary to bring him a new one,” Draco tells her, face set in an ugly smirk, “Potter can have mine, I have to go.” He lays his fork toward Harry, purposeful and petty, like it’s a great victory and not ridiculous theatrics.
“I’m sorry, I’m a mistake?”
I ask you to resolve this issue in a timely manner.
In her letters (mailed through the British Post), Pansy still complains about the peacock bites she got when she stole it from the green parlour.
“You’re very naked,” Malfoy says.
“Oh my god, Ron!”
“Well,” Harry says uneasily. “See you later, Malfoy?”
“I don’t know. No kids. No responsibility. You’re here.”
“I don’t know why. I just know that I’m here and I should do my best to protect this land.”
“It was nice, being married,” he says. “I didn’t… I am not in love with Astoria, but I liked that she was my wife. I like being her husband. I like being someone’s husband, really.” He winces. “Liked.”
“I’m really not comfortable with how close your teeth are to my nether regions.”
Malfoy seems to twitch with amusement. Harry looks away; it’s too weird.
Draco only frowns down at him, which only makes Harry grin harder; he doesn’t avoid Harry’s mouth when he kisses him, morning breath and all, but it’s a near thing.
“Lube, better than the one you summon.”
“Why are we handcuffed?” He looks around. “We’re in a cell. We shouldn’t be handcuffed.”
Malfoy blinks at him, fiddling with the papers in front of him.
Harry Potter is dead.
“Fighting, I mean. It’s not just me.”
“Reheated, but it should still be drinkable.”
Potter is silent for a long moment and Draco has to turn and see if he’s still here or if he has puffed out of existence, as he tends to do.
“Then might I advise that the brain needs its sleep for a productive learning experience?”
“That wasn’t in my notes,” Malfoy says.
And Harry cries. But it takes him a long time to tell Ginny that he’s crying in relief. That, he too, isn’t straight.
“Want to,” Draco corrects with a pained expression. “Fine, Potter, I, alone, will endeavour in making you miserable.”
His scent dangerously appeals to him. Harry tries to read but the words are swimming in front of him.
“What? Why?”
Harry feels himself tighten like a bow, rigid with tension. The conversation is getting out of hands and he doesn’t know how to steer them to clearer waters.
“So this man… The Dark Lord. He killed them?”
“All of that?” Harry asks with a spark in his eyes. It reassures Draco and he lets himself relax on his own bench.
By the time he goes back to the house, night has fallen and Draco doesn’t stop to look at his disheveled appearance in the mirror. He’s sweaty and tired, the buzzing of his mind too loud for his body. He goes straight to the liquor cabinet and pours himself a stiff finger of Scottish whiskey.
Harry makes a noise of outrage and sits up in bed, ready to hit back when he realises that he holds a laundry bag. Further investigation teaches him that he is holding his uniform in hand.
“Studying, of course, Professor!” he answers with the sort of cheekiness Harry is used to see in Ginny.
“God, finally,” he says, and wraps a hand around Draco’s wrist.
They knock; Harry strains to hear beyond the door. He catches the shuffle of feet and braces himself to look polite and invested as the door opens.
Draco stands, finding out with pleasure that he has a few centimetres on the man. He seems to notice it too and sniffs while straightening out.
Draco feels too bitter to bite his tongue.
Draco tries to follow him, tries to overlook the heat already creeping in the room, but the day is going to be hot, and so he closes his eyes and suffers in silence, feels the breath of Harry even out against his Adam’s apple and begs the world for a cooling charm. He has shoved his wand in the pocket of the trousers he wore on the first day here and has not touched it since, but he longs for the relief of it.
“Hogwarts? What’s that? A farm?”
Draco raises a pale eyebrow without even looking at him; Harry wants to kiss it. Draco is really hot when focused.
She enters the room and asks Harry to follow.
Harry feels himself tense; Malfoy is blowing on embers into his chest, just waiting to catch fire.
“Believe it or not, I started it this time.”
“When I gave you your wand back, it was wrapped in newspaper, in a old box I found at Grimmauld. And a muggle newspaper. A recipe of a German cake.”
Ron clears his throat.
The officer rolls his eyes.
Ron looks tired and soot-streaked when Harry stumbles into his and Hermione’s cottage, red hair plastered to his forehead with sweat.
“Right,” he says after a while. “I’ll need your deposition, Harry.”
Harry hums.
He’s about to jump out of bed and into the shower when he feels the sharp indent of Harry’s teeth on his skin, and the wet heat of his tongue soothing in their path.
“Bones? That’s… an original name. Why did… err, his parents decide on that?”
“Knowing that I’m a reformed Death Eater, and thus Astoria the wife of one, I do not see an outcome that doesn’t result with the arrest of one of us.”
“I used the usual curses and charms in case someone tried to stop me, so don’t forget to remove them. I wrote what I knew about your mother.” They look at each other. “But I could simply tell you about her. Can’t we go somewhere to talk? How can I contact you? My owls always come back to me.”
Total
“Because people wanted me to.”
The silence falls over them, light and undemanding. Harry watches Malfoy curiously, notes the marks of an exhaustion that has sat too long on his face. Malfoy looks frail, run ragged, but he has lost the nervous energy that seemed to be the only thing driving him forward in 6th Year.
Harry rubs at his face with the free hand this time.
Harry squirms, both uncomfortable and too comfortable with Malfoy’s proximity. He’s got the weirdest urge to get closer and smell the pale length of his throat. His rational mind reminds him of basic decency and makes him want to fling himself across the room, to escape the temptation.
“No worries. I didn’t think you were the type,” assures Harry, and places a hand on Draco's knee, like he can open his skull and sees what Draco is thinking.
“Insurance?”
Potter comes back for the week that follows and the entire Potter clan is summoned, ex-wife included. Draco asks Mimpsy to serve refreshment and holes himself in his office with a bottle of brandy and a lot of paperwork. When he hears the echoes of choked-up voices, he only spells the Wireless on.
Harry hums.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything. He stands here, spine rigid, ready to snap.
By the time Scorpius comes back to him, looking so small in his funeral attire, twelve once again, the sun has set and there’s only the blue-black shadows of the Potter children bent over a grave.
Draco grimaces and conscientiously looks at his nails before answering. Grief is a painful mask to witness on him and Draco is not selfless enough to watch it spread on his face.
He doesn’t scream when he gets Malfoy on the chin, and he barely grunts when he receives a scratching slap in answer.
“Bloody hell,” the man mutters and rubs at his eyes from under his glasses, rather aggressively. “Listen, I don’t know what kind of business you have, but we don’t want any trouble here, alright?”
He stares.
Harry closes his eyes, rubs at his eyebrows, and pulls some poison from the cigarette.
James raises an eyebrow.
They bleed, little cuts that feel inconsequential, that sting with the salt of their sweat. By the time they’ve damaged themselves enough to be lying down, throwing half-hearted kicks at each other, there’s light in their eyes and the gruff voice of a police officer complaining loudly at his colleague.
“Potter, I may have been a Death Eater six years ago, but a lot has changed since then. I’ve been tried and was punished for my actions. If you deemed that it wasn’t enough at the time, you shouldn’t have testified for me.”
At the gate, a large braying wolf stands on its hind-legs, forelegs resting against the gate and Draco freezes.
“Sure, here.”
“Yeah,” rasps Harry. “Sure, come in.”
“Alright,” says Ginny, getting up from her seat with some help from Harry’s shoulder. “Let’s round up the kids and go to bed, before we have to roll ourselves through the front door.”
The man’s lips thin into a straight unhappy line.
His father comes to mind. For a brief moment, Draco wonders what he would say of the situation. Probably something unpleasant. He snuffs this line of thoughts in the bud and turns on his back to fall asleep.
Harry squints at him, adjusts his glasses in confusion.
Harry blinks at him, there are freckles brought by summer on the bridge of his nose and they make a wonderful target for Harry’s kisses; it’s incredibly hard to restrain himself from doing so.
Draco does; Harry closes his eyes on the urgency washing through him. He feels Draco’s breath brushing on his hair, maddening light tingles, and then wet heat, drowning anything else. The ocean roars in his ears, heated waves crashing over his head. Harry is reduced to the sole sensation of Draco’s mouth on him, of Draco’s fingers inside him, pushing him closer and closer, repetitions of stimuli that come and withdraw. Completion is at arm’s reach, and yet has never seemed farther for Harry, it cannot come fast enough, or it comes too fast, he doesn’t know any more.
Malfoy silences him with a kiss. And later that night, Harry follows him, veiled by the Invisibility Cloak. He still doesn’t say anything.
Ginny gets her wand out and gets to work. Her wandwork is exasperated, less careful that she is when treating James’s hurt and scratches, but Harry bears it without a flinch, taking it as the penance that it is. When she’s finished, they smile at each other.
Harry tries to make himself taller, more charming.
Draco groans against his lips.
“From what I read, there’s seven steps to it.”
“Point. And I do not wish for an explanation, but rarely?”
“Then, there must be something that scares you in this room?”
Almost ten years after the end of the war, it seems that our Saviour and Head Auror Harry Potter is trying to definitively bury the hatchet. He was spotted in Muggle London earlier this week sharing a drink with Draco Malfoy, a [reformed] Death Eater. Our source confirms that they were talking in friendly tones, like colleagues simply grabbing a pint after work. Is it the sign that the War is finally well behind us? Read more on page 4.
Draco wets his lips and stares at the hand. He slowly brings his fingers to rest on the back of it, brushes lightly but purposefully and Harry looks wildly around and takes his hand off.
“Hum. Good? Not as fascinating as your own job I’m sure… Astoria tells me you’re an… an error?”
“Merlin, will you calm down? He’s not going to hurt you,”
Harry tries for his voice, but finds it missing and so he nods and rubs the sand out of his eyes.
Draco nods, finger hovering over the page to keep his focus.
Albus comes over everyday for the remaining of summer. He looks sheepishly at Draco from under his lashes, eternally grateful, and brings him muggle candles every other week. Draco doesn’t really get it, but he accepts them nicely enough and even lights one when he’s feeling gloomy, on the first rain of autumn.
“What are you, really?” Draco asks and is almost surprised to have actually voiced it.
Harry clears his throat but doesn’t move from his position on the landing.
“You would say that you had pleasurable reasons to stay.”
“I bet you went to a posh boarding school,” Harry mutters. With a smirk, he adds, “All boys.”
Malfoy doesn’t even look at him, wincing in a weirdly dignified way.
“They could take a nap, we have plenty of room here.” He lets his smile relax. “You could stay.”
Malfoy bats him away, the shadows of his frown accented by the strobe lights. He leans toward Harry but stops himself and shakes his head, shrugs in a clear dismissal and walks off.
“Why, Potter, are you proposing?”
After, Harry buries his nose into Draco’s throat and breathes there, damp and hot. He expects Draco to shove him off, but instead he curves a hand around Harry’s skull, nails sharp against his scalp.
Harry immediately takes his hand back.
They have been necking for a good ten minutes when a shout makes them jump apart.
The pub serves a large variety of beers and lagers and Draco, who has absolutely no idea of what is good despite his promises, simply orders two different pints and a plate of chips. He checks that his Glamours are still firmly in place in the mirror behind the bartender and brings everything back with him with a delicate swish of his wand.
Harry nods, tongue-tied. Malfoy is very close, looks awfully good in the rigid cotton of his shirt, angular and sharp. Harry is a bit scared to cut himself if he ever touches him. He wants to try. He pushes his hands in his jeans pockets instead.
“Bedroom,” Draco chokes out and Harry bodily lifts him against his front and wrestles him into walking.
“I’m so sorry,” he says.
Draco's quicksilver smile is tense and wobbles in a grimace.
Harry feels himself warm at the mention of Draco. He’s amazed by it, the intensity, years after.
He shouldn’t have feelings on the matter, and yet…
And he’s not sure he can refuse Malfoy even if he ever wanted to.
Malfoy tips his head in ascent and takes a sip of his drink. He hums around his mouthful.
“What about our marriages?”
“Oh whoa. It tingles.”
19th August 2009
Teddy looks caught when Harry looks at him. He’s red from his throat to the tip of his hair, flamboyant against his sober blue suit; Harry raises both eyebrows.
The waiter seems to grit his teeth, square jaw tightening with the energy to stay unmoveable. Draco does not understand the trepidation.
There is bafflement that is all Potter on his face for half a second before everything flickers. Draco stands there, holding emptiness between his shaking hands. He’s red from the sun and the fury and cannot stop the tremors that course the length of his arms.
In the span of a breath, Draco is soaked to the bone, cold water sinking between the layer of his robes. He gasps as drops reach the bare skin of his ribs, so very sensitive, and takes a hold of Potter shirt; black, clingy, muggle-fashioned.
Malfoy’s roaring laughter follows him to 12 Grimmauld Place.
Then he faces Draco; Draco who looks ethereal in the silver moonlight in a rumpled jumper and ink stains. Harry had imagined it a hundred times since the evening in the study and had never quite pictured him like that. He would have thought that Draco insisted on getting changed into robes or a more modern tuxedo. Instead, he watches Draco smile back at him, tall and beautiful in the middle of a deserted meadow.
He’s manhandled on his back and Draco lays between his tights, biting kisses in the sensitive skin of them.
Draco sniffs, touches Harry’s arm with his gloved fingers in an intimate greeting, now that he’s done battling his limb into various weather-appropriate contraption. He has a knack for making Harry fall through floors with a touch alone; it always feels more than it actually is. Harry’s skin burns where Draco pressed his knuckles.
They’ve shared more than one beer in this kitchen. It’s understood among the adults that the kitchen is  a child-free zone, and so it’s also the place to take a break. They usually don’t talk; not throwing hexes and punches feels more than enough for them to call it a cordial relationship.
“If you say so,” and there’s laughter in his voice.
Draco takes it in his hands and freezes. It’s a long moment before he turns his own wrist to compare the two of them. Harry stays silent.
I cannot imagine a universe where you would be glad for my correspondence and thus, I am willingly choosing to make this quick.
Draco finds him later, in the same spot, unmoving. He smiles, big and full of promises that make Harry shiver, slides up to him and tips his head back for a kiss, natural as breathing. Harry gasps, surprised by the immediate heat of it and feels the sharp grin of Draco’s mouth against his.
Harry closes the door and leans against it. Draco closes his book, puts it in his lap.
“I don’t really sleep, you know.”
Draco doesn’t ask Harry if he’s alright; because he obviously isn’t, but he gets closer and nudges his leg with his bare toes. Just an indication that he’ss here, that he’s not leaving.
Draco is pink in the face, swallowing back words and thinking, Adam’s apple moving once, two, three times before answering.
Draco turns and blinks at him, confused.
“So you do understand me,” he says warily.
He doesn’t understand why he cannot be alone with his thoughts for a week or two. Why everyone panics when he stops responding to letters. His friends want him to use his new status as leverage in the fight for werewolf rights; Harry doesn’t. He doesn’t understand why they still bother him when he already said no.
Malfoy looks good in his anthracite shirt and black robes, the royal tilt to his head that even the war and the hunger did not succeed in washing off of him. He sneers at Harry; it’s familiar, and he welcomes it gladly.
Ginny wrinkles her nose.
“Ah, here you are, hiding yourself,” Andromeda says, poking her head through the doorway. “Harry, darling, I’m afraid Ginny had to go home.”
Potter reappears in the seat in front of Draco’s at breakfast. Draco almost collapses in relief; he had believed he had banished Potter the night before. He firmly pulls on his unflinching tenacity to seem untouched by his sudden appearance.
“I’m not excluding it, but that always seemed a bit weird to me. From what I saw of his room, he knew how to use it. He had experience with such dark artifacts. It’s not hard to get out of one, they’re not meant to trap you.”
“So, how is work as a meteorologist?” Harry asks.
Luna perches herself on the arm of his seat, tilts his head back to look up his nose. Harry has learned that it’s best not to interrupt Luna when she’s looking for some grizzly creatures.
“I wish,” he says fervently in the cushions. He turns to look at her; she’s blurry and he tries to blink her back into focus, before remembering that his eyesight-correcting charm must have worn off. “Glasses?” he asks hopefully.
Heads turn as they move through the Atrium, and a rise of murmurs follows their path. It’s the year after the war all over again. Harry grits his teeth and endures it, but doesn’t fight it when Malfoy bends his silver head to him and asks “Side-along with me?”
Draco Malfoy.
Harry clears his throat and straightens in his seat.
Harry shrugs.
“You should drink,” advises Harry as he moves away from the tap in invitation.
“For what?”
By the end of his shift, Draco is apoplectic with desire and cannot protest when Harry pulls him in the restroom for quick hand jobs. They get red and disheveled, but no one comments on it, and they’re bade a good evening by the fresh-faced waitress.
Harry does. He fishes out a half-empty bottle of vodka. He looks back at Malfoy and gets a disgusted face in answer.
“ We would have to stop halfway through the dance. Or trip.”
He is considering the pros and cons of getting smashed at his godson’s birthday party, when the french door opens. Harry guiltily looks over his shoulder to see Malfoy, harassed and tired. There’s hair falling over his forehead, and it fascinates Harry. He can count on his fingers the times he has seen Malfoy dishevelled, and they’re always omens of big changes in his life.
Teddy turns away to do it; James makes a weird face at him. Harry is sufficiently fluent in his son’s facial expressions to understand something along the lines of “I have no idea why he’s being weird”.
“But he doesn’t need you any more,” Harry informs it gently.
“I can’t say that I’m surprised,” Malfoy drawls.
Malfoy’s smile is self-deprecating. He hides it behind the rim of his glass.
“You have? Really?”
Harry tries for a smile and knows that he has not quite landed by the stiff one he receives in return. He feels untethered, like two pieces of a puzzle slotting together weirdly, too big and too tight for each other; being cordial and acting like an adult in front of Malfoy feels unnatural. Andromeda brushes a hand against his arm, and he nods, grinning genuinely at her.
Mr. Bruegel goes red and blotchy, expands with indignation. “I won’t answer to you!”
“Ah, keep your secrets then,” Harry decides, and comfortably sinks in his seat, waiting for the end of the journey.
“It’s a very respectable…” (pureblood, his brain supplies), “name,” he finishes lamely and sags a little bit. It must sound strange to a muggle, but Draco doesn’t have the faintest idea of what’s a normal muggle name.
“And I gifted you the first blossom of the year and the last snow on the same day,” says Draco with a short dip of his head, looking down at his hands. “They’re supposed to represent resilience and perseverance in our relationship.”
Later, when Harry has tugged sausages out of James’ hands in hope of making something edible, Ron settles at the table and lets a sweeping charm get the worse of the flour. The kids are calmly playing in the next room. Harry gets the dishes going, shirt sleeves rolled back to his elbows and wedding ring in the pocket of his trousers.
There’s an unused century-old Necromancy classroom on the fourth floor that is blood-chilling if one doesn’t have an appropriate distraction; Harry tugs Malfoy in it by his tie most days. The carpet is plush and sweet against his back and Malfoy lays there for hours, between the shelter of his legs and bites kisses into his breastbone.
“He does?” they say through a closed-up throat.
“I’m not doing anything wrong, Malfoy.”
Malfoy looks flushed, attractively pink in the early evening light, and the glint of his eyes tells Harry that he too is drunk. They stumble from one room to the next, poking their heads through the living room doorway to find both of their five-year-olds napping, curled around one another on the carpet.
When they see each other, they freeze up, then relax in the same heartbeat. Malfoy closes the door, and the quiet swallows them.
Malfoy sneers; it looks very ugly on his face. “Yes, because I’ll sleep like a baby with a stranger in the room.”
“Yes, hero worship. It used to be me. Now he cannot be arsed to even look in my direction when I talk to him.”
Harry is bent at the waist, dry heaving over the pavement before Draco has blinked the effects of apparition away.
“Right.” Malfoy says and puts his messenger back on the couch. He riffles through it for a second before handing the file to Harry. “I have everything here.” He takes a fortifying breath, “I was hoping that you could tell me what you saw at the crime scene.”
Simply looking at Malfoy makes Harry flush; he feels the heat of it on his cheeks. Harry has the distinct memory of Malfoy’s hands splayed over his skull and sinking into his fur. It makes Harry’s wolf shiver in anticipation.
It’s well after noon that Potter pops out of existence and Albus is left empty-eyed and trembling.
,” he repeats, grinning and looking scrumptious, relaxed on the bed, pants riding low. “So terribly posh.”
“No,” Harry says and watches the tension being washed away from him. “I testified because it was right.”
He waits all of five seconds before the door opens, and he’s left standing at the gaping entrance of an empty hall. Harry takes an additional five seconds to steel himself and crosses the threshold. He feels the shimmer of wards go over his head.
“No, but you know why you arrest people. I…” Malfoy takes a second to think, perplexed in the arch of his eyebrows. “I think I would like to run things past you, really, see what you think about it all.”
“Alright, this is your home, Harry,” says Dumbledore with the frail quality of old people.
Harry stands there, watching him read it, feeling childish.
Draco spends a long time staring at this plant, snow covering red-blood flowers like icing sugar. He almost wants to bend and take a bite, only to verify that he is not dreaming and that the bush has thorns that would cut him, make him itch for days with scratches at his chin.
“Gotta go.”
“Why would I give you some if I did? I punched you last night.”
“I mean, what was your plan when you left your house?”
Harry looks wonderfully gob-smacked by the news.
Malfoy clears his throat and asks, “Tea?”
Potter shakes his head and the curls bounce around his head, too long. He looks weirdly childish like that, despite the salt and pepper of his hair. Draco has to look away.
Harry takes his hand closer, and rubs at the discolouration there, he opens his mouth to answer, something teasing and inconsequential before the words dry in his mouth and Harry is helpless to stare. The line feels very familiar; a simple band that comes apart in a small following of dots around his finger. Harry has seen it under his own ring more time that he can count.
And Draco does.
“What do you mean?” Potter tries for perfect innocence, but his smile is wide and full of mischief. “I’m working.”
“Yes, but it seems to mostly concern hags,” Draco says, unbothered and turning a few pages.
“What are you doing?” he asks, horrified and vigilant, already looking over his shoulder to see if someone has seen it.
“Merlin, just get naked already.”
“You smell really good,” Harry says thickly, because it’s true. He regrets it immediately.
Malfoy knocks at his door when evening bleeds into night. Harry opens it in the same jeans and shirt he was wearing this morning. He feels underdressed in front of Malfoy’s gleaming worry about his appearance.
I wish to apologise. Nothing that I can say to you and your peers will ever make up for what I have done and what followed, but I am genuinely sorry for the hurt I have caused you.
“James?” she asks.
“Yes, woman, I’m coming,” says Draco, exasperated as he emerges from the house, glasses in hands. He looks blindingly beautiful in the light and Harry has to consciously bite his lips to keep himself from smiling foolishly.
“Yes,” Draco answers, too fast, and has to swallow against the words that want to come spilling out. He doesn’t think they would help; he gets closer instead, brushes his knuckles against his hand. Harry, in a show of vulnerability, clutches at them without giving a glance around.
Draco shrugs (quite undignified for a pureblood heir, if you asked his father) and pats his pocket to make sure that the waiter didn’t distort his clothing.
“They’re not that bad. And no, I ran away when I was seven. But I got adopted, after, and honestly, it was ten times better. I never regretted it.”
Draco’s responding smile is brighter than any flame. It burns Harry to a crisp tenderness.
“That’s not… That’s not what I’m asking.” And Harry looks a bit scared himself, a bit alarmed at where this conversation is going.
Draco secures the package under his arm and apparates away in a pop.
“No?” answers Draco with a bit of an inflection, not sure of what the right response is to this new and pleasant development.
“I know.” When Draco meets his eyes. “It doesn’t mean, you won’t… In the future.”
“No, Potter… Harry. No. I’m asking that we stop dancing around what we… I’m asking that we to stop using sex as a pretence of seeing each other.”
“Alright,” Harry says, “have a good one,”
“Malfoy, wait.” Harry buries his hands in his too-tight jeans, Ginny’s purchase. “We should stop.”
Harry walks into the door when he goes. His shoulder smarts but he doesn’t even try to justify himself to Malfoy, he simply bolts out of the building. If he doesn’t, he would sink to his knees and wait for Malfoy to comb through his hair.
Harry doesn’t bother to answer and steadies him with a hand at his hip. He lets Draco sink into his lap with his full weight, and feels the twinge of muscles deep in his legs from their earlier efforts. Draco looks down at him, his sharp nose taking a royal tilt as he settles himself.
Draco answers, in the hair curling over his ears and Harry grins, cheeks hurting.
“Right. So there’s the possibility of an accident.”
It’s the middle of winter when Draco sees the rose bush. It’s not planted in his rose garden, where his mother had gathered the most wonderful and rich collection of blossom, but further away from the house, tucked in a clearing in the woods.
“You’re not the only wizard with an understanding, Malfoy.”
“You’re so weird.”
your assistant,” Draco answers simply and perches himself on the arm of Harry’s chair.
Harry falls silent, tries another sip. It doesn’t do much for his agitation.
Draco straightens up and extends his arm in front of them.
“Morgana, you’re disgusting,” Draco says, hiding in the pillows while Harry lays biting kisses on his defenceless jaw.
Harry hums noncommittally. The foam of his beer ripples under his breath.
“Fine. Hitting me wasn’t enough to calm you down. What about you? Scorpius right?”
"Fine. Would you tell me if someone requests information about Draco Malfoy? Anything at all? I just want to make sure—"
on them; that should work too," Harry answered, quickly swiping his wand over the perpetrators. A sparkle of magic, and they immediately vanished.
Harry let his hand glide over a dusty shelf that seemed to hold nothing but wires in different sizes and colours before he turned back towards Arthur. "What do we do against this?"
. Everyone, wands out. This will become nasty if we've missed anybody!"
"It was frightening," he said eventually, throwing the remains of the leaf onto the floor. "I was expecting your lot to come, hoping for it even. Everyday was an exercise in fear. But it didn't happen, Harry. The Dark Lord only feared Dumbledore, but not enough to be worried that he might just come knocking on our door. Father—well, he'd lost half his marbles by then. He was jumping between knowing that nothing would ever happen to him since nobody would dare to come over… and then he'd be broken in terror, fearing that even we were after him." Draco sighed and looked very sad. "I'm glad to not be on that side again. I know this much: I wouldn't get through it again. I wouldn't survive. To be fair, your side might look safer, but it really isn't. So"—Draco shrugged, his small confession drawing to a halt—"we'll see. Was it like this the last time too? For you and the others, I mean."
Sirius was chasing the peacocks, Mr Malfoy was whining as he ran after all of them. Sirius dived ahead, outwitting Mr Malfoy entirely.
"What? Are you sure?" Ron asked as Hermione already ran out of the room. He looked aghast at the words Harry had shared with him.
"Are you sure?" Draco narrowed his eyes. "You know how you get sometimes. This isn't the leftover remnants of the war talking or something?"
Blinking against the light streaming through the blinds and shining on the bed, Harry glanced to his left and froze. His heart skipped a beat.
"Did they send you?" Kingsley asked.
Each bird sailed through the open window and Draco dropped a few coins into their little pouches before they flew off again
“Merlin, I don’t know.” Harry had to admit he was almost tired of the repetitive arguments, though the fire Malfoy lit in him was unlike anything else he had ever felt. Because, really, that’s why he did it. Nothing was quite like a battle with Malfoy, the way his whole body felt on fire. And the git deserved every insult Harry would throw at him, didn’t he? It wasn’t as if he was anything close to a victim in all of this, he had said his fair share of horrid things too.
“What?” Harry said, unable to look at him, unable to focus, surrounded entirely by the Slytherin.
“Oh, my dear. More than you think.” Pansy picked up the bottle, topping up both their glasses. “Écoute attentivement (listen carefully), because I’m about to teach you so many things.” She leant back with a devious smile. “Draco dearest, you sound like a brat, so let us hope Mr Potter can handle you.”
He watched Alfie fly off, the owl landing on his perch as gazing out across the aviary, making sure everything was how he liked it. He was king of the enclosure, but still a big softie. Harry had made a good choice with this job. It was the most successful therapy he’d had, and Hedwig’s death was probably the one he had come to terms the most with; mostly because of the dozens of hours spent with the other owls.
"Really?"
“Because you would have punched me in the face.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco watches in amusement as Potter spills some of his wine onto the tablecloth with a curse.
"Well, that's good. Isn't it Ron?" The feisty witch elbowed him in the side.
Harry pushed open the door to Eeylops Owl Emporium, the jingle of the bell above the door making the woman behind the counter raise her head from where she had been wiping it down. The shop was dark, seemingly suspended in a constant state of twilight, and smelt earthy, like dirt and straw.
"Would you like that, mon ours (teddy bear)?"
"You mean killing people?"
"Give it another month, Malfoy."
"Kreacher." He called, pinching the bridge of his nose.
It was strange, seeing Draco in his ‘natural’ environment. He was dressed in smart grey trousers, his white button up untucked was perfectly styled to look casual-but-not-too-casual. He almost oozed cockiness, completely in the role of rich, upper class, white boy. It made Harry’s body react in a way that he was somehow familiar with, though in the strangeness of the moment, he couldn’t quite place it.
-----
"I did an interview, like you asked. I was honest and quite frankly, generous too." Harry said,waving his hands in exasperation.
He plopped on to it, pulling her on top of him with a shriek. She laughed and tried to push him away but he just held on tighter. "I love you, Pans. I hope you know that." His words were muffled in her hair, and she squeezed him back. He let her go and she stood up, reaching down to ruffle his hair.
"Malfoy-"
"Fuck off, Potter. I'm not in the mood for whatever your half-wit brain considers a joke." Draco's brain could barely keep up with the words that were spilling from his mouth. He rushed out the pub and into the cooler spring air. He needed space, he needed to be the fuck away from whatever had just happened. Draco could barely summon the self-control to not apparate drunk, and instead clumsily jogged to the next pub, and into their floo, giving his address.
"Stop saying hurtful things just because you're angry. You know that you're doing it. You need to stop." Draco stood up too, offering his hand. He quickly glanced at Teddy, who was fast asleep.
"More than you realise, Malfoy."
Merlin's tits. The way Potter licked his lips and returned the smirk, surely it was illegal?!
“Wish me luck, Pans, or it’s gonna be you who’s in the shit.”
The most famous, most brilliant, most bravest man to ever exist. Who’s arse we must all kiss, and lick, and fondle, though that may be just me. It really is a nice arse you know. Have you ever looked in the mirror? A truly fine specimen. You wouldn’t think it spent so much time on a broomstick being a bloody show off, but here we are, you with a nice arse and me with a picture of it in my head. How delightful.
Malfoy’s jaw dropped. He hadn’t even said please! Potter was a cheeky bloody bastard… And yet; he found himself smiling, making his way to the door with a warm flutter in his chest. Were they really that comfortable around each other now? So comfortable that Harry could trust him to be left to his own devices? Well, it’s not like he was a child - though he did feel as giddy as one.
"We should go together, sometime."
“Hey! I’m the one who had to decipher your horrific handwriting.” And read your half-lusty, half-sad ramblings on four hours sleep, he thought.
McGonagall smiled at the two boys in front of her as Narcissa Malfoy peered around the eighth year common room. Her eyes lingered on where Harry sat on the floor, surrounded by papers and still holding a bar of chocolate, and a muscle in her jaw twitched. She turned back to look at Draco and smiled at him, kissing him on the cheek.
“Don’t tell anyone.” She winked, taking another sip. “But I'm being honest, darling. Don’t be too hard on yourself. You’ve admitted that what you’ve done is wrong, so who am I to judge?” Draco bit his lip. “Plus, that’s not to say you can’t have passion.”
Draco snorted and kissed her cheek when she leant down. "Goodnight."
And so when Potter decided to talk about anything more meaningful than the weather, he did what he did best; protect himself. He put up his walls, threw scathing comments and disgusted looks. Because, Merlin knows, nothing frightened him more than Harry Fucking Potter.
Harry looked over his shoulder, catching sight of Malfoy’s retreating back. Could Hermione be right? She usually was, but a truce? The two had been each other’s necks since Malfoy was rude to Ron on that first day all those years ago. To think otherwise was beyond weird.
"Sit down, Mr Malfoy."
“Muggles throw money into these, you know, it’s supposed to bring good luck.”
“Yeah, I just needed to bring Draco to show him Alfie’s records.”
“Then those nightmares should leave permanently, yes. However, there’s nothing to stop you from getting a new nightmare in say, six months time, of your cock falling off or whatever it is the saviour of the wizarding world worries about.” Draco smirked, pleased at the horrified look on Potter’s face at his words.
"What about you, Mr Malfoy?"
Pansy looked at him with wide eyes. "You're lying!"
He knew why, of course. His nightmares had stopped the week before. Now his nights were blissfully quiet, not even interrupted with dreams. It was incredible. Amazing. His shoulders felt the lightest they had done, ever.
"What can I get for you?" The barmaid smiled at Draco, and he faintly wondered if she's just very good at customer service, or actually doesn’t recognise him.
The two women shared a smile. It was strange; to see the two together like that. So strange in fact, that when Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley walked in, searching for a lunchtime snack, they were immediately suspicious of something underhanded. Pansy’s gaze fell past Luna, towards the two scowling Gryffindors marching towards their table.
"So what if I am, Malfoy?" He was suddenly a lot closer, too close. He looked into the bright green of his eyes and wondered if he could actually get lost in them. Draco hissed and stood up abruptly, using his few inches to look down at Potter, pushing him away.
He smiled up at her. "And why is that?"
"See, Potter, I don't spend all my time being evil." Draco winked back.
“Potter. How are you?” The blond gave him a look of indifference as he removed his glasses.
“Potter. What do you want?” Draco drawled, picking up Sylvia. Merlin knows he needed her reassuring cuddles when dealing with the absolute headache that was Harry Potter.
Harry laughed again, trying to pry Draco’s hands away. “No they don’t. You do realise-”
“I don’t want to hear your pathetic excuse, Malfoy.” Harry said his name like it tasted just as bitter as he felt.
“I’ve got a bone to pick with you.”
Draco leaned down next to her ear. "Harry Potter."
The man grumbled to himself, turning away. “Prick.”
“Come on, Tedster.” Harry took Teddy’s hand and took a step up the stairs, with a devilish grin. “Door under the stairs, I’m sure you can find your way around.” He winked.
He didn’t answer, because, well, he didn’t know. He didn’t know where he was going, or why he was so angry. He should be happy that Malfoy’s cruel ways were apparently over, but he wasn’t. Because it was so strange, so unusual. After all these years of bullying and harassment, why was he stopping now? What had changed?
Harry nodded, lifting his chin from his scarf to give her a tight smile. Merlin, give him strength; he needed it to deal with an angry, puffed up Draco Malfoy.
Potter took a huge bite, letting out a moan. "Its really good! I've always wanted to go to France."
“Draco?”
Maybe they do have similarities, Draco thinks and smiles brightly. "That will be perfect, thank you."
“Like me?” Harry watched as Ginny raised the donut to Luna’s lips and she took the last bite. “I have more donuts, you know. You don’t have to share.”
Harry shook his head. “What have I gotten myself into? Now there's two of you.”
“Something’s changed.”
"What if I am, Malfoy?"
Harry turned around to see the two of them sharing a look he couldn't quite work out. "Please don't start this again. I told you; he's changed."
Rita gasps. "Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy? The death eater?"
The pair frowned, turning to Luna. “Are you alright?”
“Hi, Malfoy.”
The blond’s heart sunk, and he slowly turned his head, offering a politely surprised smile. “Balveer! What brings you here?”
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you enjoyed watching these two fools fall in love!
Harry shivers at his words, biting his lip. Draco groans at the sight and crushes their lips together. When they finally pull apart, breathless and hazy-eyed; Harry growls and pushes Draco away.
------
“Headmistress McGonagall has been kind enough to show me how the reparations are doing, and I asked to look at the new living quarters - as your letters have been so brief recently.” Narcissa’s tone was formal, but held a tinge of disappointment that had Draco bowing his head.
Malfoy’s jaw dropped, and he shoved Harry in the chest. “That’s not funny.”
“Should we feel bad for practically holding a jury about him?” Harry asked, frowning into his pint glass. The drink was making his thoughts foggy, and he suddenly felt strangely sad. Like all he wanted to do was hug Malfoy. Merlin, he probably gave fantastic hugs. His long arms would probably wrap so perfectly around him, and he’d smell so good; Harry was sure of it. Smell like rain in the morning, Merlin, Harry loved the smell of rain in the morning.
"Next time?"
She stood up fiercely. "I asked how, and you will answer me!"
“Make yourself comfortable, why don’t you?” Harry huffed, mulling over this information. For some reason it had never clicked in his brain, but of course Andy was Malfoy’s aunt.
-----
"What do you want from me, Potter? Do you want to be best mates? Why don’t you ask one of the hundreds of wizards lining up to kiss your arse instead." Malfoy hissed the words at him, narrowing his eyes as the two faced off in the alleyway. “Salaud (bastard).”
Harry sighed. He didn’t know why he was so anxious, it was just Luna. He’d be fine.
“I need another drink.” Draco groaned. He left Pansy’s side and began making his way through the crowd, worried Balveer would sense his gaze on him. A few feet away from the bar, someone backed into his path, and he nearly tripped. Draco grabbed onto the body for balance, looking up into the eyes of Harry Potter.
Draco sat up, enjoying the slight spin of the room as he downed the rest of his glass. “Top me up then, gorgeous. I’ll need my strength.” He drawled.
“Please let me finish, Weasley. I imagine your fiance here was already concocting one of her own.” Pansy eyed the engagement ring on Granger’s finger. What a shame, she had always been keen on the witch.
“This isn’t news, love.”
“Remind me why I took this job again, Neville?”
"Did you here that? Daddy called me daft!" Harry spun around, yielding the giggling toddler like a shield. He leaned into Sirius' ear. "I think we should tickle him!"
"Oh."
Draco retreated and straightened up, grabbing his case and walking into the fireplace. When the flames settled down, he found himself in Harry's living room. It was cozy, with a sofa and matching armchairs - one of which seemed to be solely for the purpose of holding a huge stack of blankets. There was a fluffy rug under his feet and the coffee table sported numerous copies of the Quidditch Times. The walls were covered in photos of Harry and his friends and the whole room had a gold and blue theme.
Harry watched as Draco folded his hands behind his back and smiled back, though it looked strained.
He scribbled down a quick note, asking Pansy to look after Lady, and sent her off.
Luna had been one of the only people to get to know him after the battle. She had thanked him for sneaking food and water down to where she was being held at Malfoy Manor, and he had reassured her that anyone would have done the same. ~But no one is you~
“I never said it did.” Luna peered out of the window. “It’s going to rain soon.”
“Incredible.” Hermione whispered again.
Draco thought about it for a moment. “Alright.”
“For half a second I thought you were going to kiss me!”
“Good morning.” Malfoy greeted. “You look nice.”
Draco made his way up the stairs, remembering the way from when he had last come. How much had things changed since then? The two men felt closer, sure, but were they really?
What on earth was that about? He knew Malfoy made him feel a lot of things, but that? He’d never had butterflies like that, even with Ginny. It was beyond weird. It felt so...strange.
“Wait, really?” Hermione exclaimed, before looking thoughtful. “I mean it makes sense, he was always top of the class in Potions in school.” She traced her finger around the rim of her glass as she spoke.
Pansy covered her shock with a smirk, shaking her head. She was always so shocked by the other woman’s blunt honesty. “That doesn’t mean I don’t like you.” She sat down.
Draco winced. "Ouch."
“That is his name, Ronald.”
"No, I used to spend a lot of time as a child looking at pictures of it though, the little villages, the Parisian streets. I always wanted to visit the Eiffel tower." Draco watched as Harry's face took on a distant, almost pained look - but before he could say anything he shook his head and smiled at Draco.
Harry hung up his coat and bag in the back room, before going and helping Paeson. She brought the cages into the back room, and then he carried them into the aviary. He opened the cage door, offering the owl a treat before it flew off. The next one flew inside, and Harry gave it a treat before shutting the door again. And so it went on and on, until all the cages were done. Each owl knew it’s cage, so it was a very smooth operation.
Pansy slowly pushed open the door, her other hand reaching to pull down her sunglasses. She peered around the cozy pub, searching for the full head of dirty blonde hair. She spotted it in the far right corner, and as she approached, Luna turned around and smiled broadly at the Slytherin. She was wearing bright orange robes and a pair of dazzling unicorn horn earrings.
"What?"
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Harry moved his arm to look at the house elf. “Tell him to piss off. And stop calling him ‘master’ just because he’s a Black.”
“Because it's a moronic idea.”
"I suppose that's why I like you. You don't care about whether or not I saved the world. You'll still be an arse," he chuckled.
“Don’t.” Harry chuckled, kicking off his shoes. Draco followed suit, lining them up neatly. “I take mine with two sugars and a splash of milk, by the way.”
A sudden darkness washed over him, an intense weight in his stomach. What was he thinking? He was going to die. There would be no future for him. No anniversaries, no Christmases. No moving in together, no family. No arguments and make-ups. No growing old.
“Afternoon, Paeson.”  Harry greeted.
Draco smoothed back the curls away from his forehead, running his own fingers over Harry's scar. He smiled sadly.
“He just cornered me outside the Great Hall and said he was sorry. That ‘money doesn’t dictate someone’s worth’ or some shit like that.” The ginger shook his head in disbelief. He caught sight of Harry’s expression and raised his hands in surrender. “Doesn’t mean he’s not still a prick, but, you know, was decent of him to apologise.” He dropped his hands, staring off into the fireplace.
He looked back at Harry to find him almost comically looking between Draco and his case. "If you wanted to move in Draco, you could have told me first."
"Tell me where the fuck Potter is. I know he comes here every Wednesday to meet you for lunch."
Draco watched as a boy, the same age as him, with unruly hair and round glasses walked into Madame Milkin's. He stood on a stool next to him.
"S'il vous plaît (please)." Draco called back, walking into the living room. “Where’s my bear?” He called out, searching for the familiar giggling mound of silver hair. It had unnerved him at first, to see what looked like a miniature version of him, but he had soon grown so fond of seeing someone so pure that looked like him. It gave him hope for Teddy’s bright future. He heard the giggly murmurings of the toddler before he saw him, and he turned around to see the familiar face of Edward toddling towards him, but with a full head of jet black ringlets. "Oh mon Dieu (oh my God)!" He shrieked, throwing his hands up. He dived forwards and scooped up the toddler. “What the hell is on your head?!”
-----
"The Malfoys captured them, Miss. On orders of You Know Who," She couldn't meet her eyes.
Draco pulled back with a frown. "What do you mean?"
“What do you mean?” Andy asked, quirking her head.
She wasn't a perfect woman. She was snobbish and racist, she supported her tyrannical husband in all his efforts. But she was a good mother, and had a kind heart to those she showed it to.
“Go on, mate. Get it off your chest.”
Draco Malfoy - Snake Whisperer. 103 Anguis Road
Draco picked up a couple of sickles from the tip jar and rubbed them together thoughtfully, his brain running through what needed to be done for the day. A dark figure appeared in his peripheral vision, and he did a double take. “Shit!”
“Plus, we haven’t even been invited.”
------
When he looked back, Rita was nodding slowly. "I understand."
He pressed his lips against Draco’s, revelling in their warmth and familiarity. How could something feel so utterly, incredibly, right? The kiss was sweet, and did nothing to douse the fire in Harry’s heart. Malfoy, it seemed, felt the same way, as he kissed Harry with everything he had. Harry kissed him back just as fervently, their mouths hot and desperate against each other. Finally, they had to catch their breath.
"Fine."
And with that, he walked off down the street. Harry watched him go, his mind reeling from how fast the past 10 minutes had gone. He looked down at the card.
"You wouldn't believe it."
“Why the fuck not?” Pansy’s high squeal of disbelief echoed in draco’s ears.
"Oh mon Dieu (Oh my God). You really are on your golden-boy shit again.” Draco chuckled, shaking his head and pushing himself off of the wall. He didn’t really know why he said it. He opened his mouth to continue but Potter interrupted him.
“Me too, sorry mate.”
“Harry, please.” He said, and the Gryffindor was taken aback by the use of his first name.
"Since you asked so nicely," Draco smirked and dropped to his knees, pulling Potter's boxers down. He took him into his mouth slowly, licking his length and hollowing his cheeks. He bobbed his head at an almost sinfully slow pace and heard Potter curse again. Draco teased him a few moments longer before coming off his cock with a pop.
"Potter?" Draco asked, surprised. "What..?" He leaned down to move the cloak away and Harry’s eyes lingered on his chest only a few inches away. He got a whiff of his scent, all apples and chocolate and mint and something familiar that he now knew was all Draco. {-oh-}. The slytherin lifted the cloak in his hand, inspecting it, unaware of Harry’s racing heart. "Is this an invisibility cloak?"
“Don’t you remember last year when he apologised to me?” The Slytherin had caught Hermione outside of class one day and quietly apologised for calling her a mudblood. Before she could respond, he had walked away like nothing had happened.
Harry’s eyebrows drew together. “Passion?”
"No worries, Harry." Hermione smiled at him. "Is there anything we can help with?"
Harry yawned widely, scratching his head as he plonked himself down at the staff table. Neville nudged the pumpkin juice towards him, shooting him a sympathetic look.
“Merlin, especially not me. You really think that I am?”
“Please, you’ll make me swoon if you carry on this way, Mr Potter.”
Harry sat at the bottom of the creaky stairs, closing his eyes as he tried to calm his heart. “Kreacher. Can you bring me a cup of tea, please?”
Draco winced, ducking his head as Teddy hid his face in his shirt at Andromeda’s shouting. "Je suis désolé (I’m sorry), Andy."
"You didn't." Draco stuttered. Why did he have such meddlesome friends?
Potter smirked slightly and looked him over. "You're sitting on my lap."
“But your shirt-”
He must be dreaming, hallucinating, passed out drunk at home, because this could not be happening!
The writing was messy, the ink smeared in places, a stain of some kind in the bottom right corner. But Harry knew this handwriting, spent his teenage years seeing this writing, obsessing over it some nights. And he knew the writing on the front of the letter doesn’t match.
"Oh, Merlin. This is a mess." The slytherin rubbed his face.
The Slytherin let out a delighted chuckle, clapping his hands together in mockery before pouting his lips. “Awww, it’s okay! No need to be ashamed, Potter. I can help you with your notes, too.”
All these thoughts swirled in his head, and Draco had to steady himself against the wall. Maybe he was more hungover than he realized.
“Spit it out, Harry. I won’t bite.”
“Get out of my flat!” Draco ordered, pointing to the fireplace as his cheeks burned red. Bloody Blaise and his love for gossip.
“Not much.”
Draco had sat in his room that night fretting. First impressions counted, and he didn't know if he'd have another chance. It's his loss, Draco thought, I'm a Malfoy, no one can mess with me.
Harry pulled away first, resting his forehead against Draco’s as he panted. His feelings were beyond words. Elation didn’t even cover it. After so long in a mist of anger and confusion, Harry finally knew what he really felt. And it, as always, had everything to do with Draco Malfoy.
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake.”
“And there it is.” Pansy smiled at him.
“Again?” he asks and Draco says yes.
It takes him all of five seconds to disarm Mr Bruegel and have him on the floor, writhing in bonds, throwing uncreative insults at Harry. Mrs Bruegel hasn’t even stood from her seat. She gapes at Harry.
“I like this,” Harry pants in the space between them, and sees the flicker of something anthracite in Malfoy’s eyes. “I like this,” he repeats, because it’s the only thing he allows himself to say.
He doesn’t startle, but his heartbeat kicks up alarmingly.
“Yes, good,” and he carefully puts the letter on the night-stand, precariously standing on Harry’s key. He clears his throat and reaches once more into the package.
Dumbledore’s driver stops the car, and squirms out of the vehicle with great difficulty, almost too big for it. Harry watches him get out blankly, fiddling with a rip in his jeans.
The glass of water Teddy puts in his hand is cold and Harry takes a grateful sip from it. He almost spills half of it down his front when hands cover his eyes suddenly.
He opens his eyes to check that Malfoy did not come forward. He hasn’t moved.
“Thank you, Malfoy.”
Draco clenches his teeth, feels his nails dig in the palm of his hand in a mounting pressure. He will bleed if he continues. Potter gets off the desk, walks up to him.
Malfoy stares at him. Harry feels himself flush and takes a step back to put further distance between them.
. It’s, er, non-binary? It’s not a woman or a man. Not really between, but it can be, but…” Harry quiets.
He folds his newspaper and lets it rest by the side of his plate, if only to gain a few spare seconds where he doesn’t have to answer. He doesn’t
But what exactly has happened to Astoria Malfoy née Greengrass remains a mystery. Did her husband’s tumultuous past come back to haunt them? Was the Wizarding Justice system wrong for letting him go so easily? Our readers can only wonder.
“Very decadent of you, sex in the middle of the day,” he pants hotly in the air.
Harry shrugs. “Maybe I should.”
He dozes for a long while. When he comes back, eyes blinking slowly in the early evening light, it’s to the sight of Draco holding a tray, standing caught in the doorway. He looks smaller in a bathrobe, feet bare.
Harry sits down next to him, knee touching the outside of his thigh; Draco lets the point of contact warm his whole body.
“I hate, hate, hate, snowball fights. We are too old for this. If my mum were still in the country, she would be appalled,” he tells Harry with a grimace.
“Oh, Merlin.”
“You’re taking Lily with you then. And you clean up if she throws up.”
“What has the heinous rat done?”
Harry tries not to squirm under Malfoy’s gaze, tries not to step closer. He shifts his balance, feels the drag of rough carpet under his feet.
“Good,” Draco says, and meets Harry’s eyes. “Good?”
“Yes, Potter, I shall do that.” He sniffs. “Thank you.”
“Could you please relax so that I can take you off his finger?”
“I don’t know, am I?”
Secretly, Draco had been immensely grateful. He had gone home that day and cried until he ached with it. He never ever mentioned it to anyone, but he has since kept his wand in unparalleled conditions.
Harry finds out then and there that Ginny is the woman of his life and loves her, again, and again, and again.
Draco cannot answer; his throat is closing up and his legs feel like reeds, ready to fold under his weight at the softest breeze. He shakes his head and clings closer, until he has his nose buried in Harry’s shoulder and has his arms around him.
Malfoy looks amused; he smiles, and it sits a bit mean on his face.
Albus follows without a word when Draco tugs him in the direction of the kitchen, and stays mute when he pushes an array of cheese and bread under his nose. Draco cuts himself some soft brie and gestures to Albus to do the same.
Malfoy stiffens, trousers tugged over his hips but not yet buttoned.
But Malfoy isn’t in the mood to accompany Harry’s silence today.
“I wouldn’t say trap.”
“How are you even watching them?” he inquires, rubbing at the rim of his glass, crystal singing under his red-wet fingers.
Malfoy Manor looms over them, strong and dark, an island in a sea of snow white.
“I don’t think we have no impact whatsoever on weather.” Harry informs him. Malfoy waves a hand in his direction. “But, yes that’s besides the point. You’re divorcing then?”
“Right,” says Ron and looks like he doesn’t quite know what to do with his hands. “We’re taking him in for attempted assault, but Malfoy here told me that I should open a closed case?”
“Please, just open them.”
Voldemort is dead. The mark is proof of that and nothing else.
“Come on, let’s find a pub in this cursed town. You have to try real Wizarding beer.”
Draco tugs softly at Harry’s locks, passes his fingers through his hair.
Abigail Murik, 25 years old from Liverpool, Merseyside agrees. “The boy is barely more than skin and bones. He needs a good meal and a long night of sleep. I do not know what that girl Ginny is doing to help him, but it doesn’t seem to be working.”
Harry James Potter,
Harry swallows. “We should talk,” he says. He should have said it years ago.
He reaches Draco’s hand and kisses the back of it, sees him smile and flush, vulnerable in the small hours.
Harry swallows. It gives him the time to push down on his panic.
The smile falls clear off his face and Draco wants to scramble to take back his words, pluck them out of the air.
“What about her?”
They end up in the living room and Harry has an alarmed moment of flailing before he spells away the mess of the last few days. The mugs accumulated over the week bob happily back to the kitchen.
“You just say you do and complain about it at length,” says Ginny.
“Wiltshire.”
“Come on, drink up. I’m no expert but I think getting pissed helps with all of that.”
“And only seeing Scorpius once in a blue moon? No. Draco and I’s relationship is perfectly cordial, friendly even, and the Manor is big.”
“I’m here to protect this land,” Potter says in the space between them.
“Unless someone made it impossible.”
“Need me?” Harry rasps, weighted down by interest, his hips pressing back.
Mr Bruegel finally flinches. His fingers spasm at his sides and he crosses them in front of him, sets his jaw in a hard line. The aggressiveness is a rigid tension in the space between them.
Malfoy shakes his head and tightens his fingers against his glass. His heartbeat is still a steady thrum despite the pause.
She looks annoyed for a second before nodding and pushing her way inside.
Harry, already too confused by the fact that he might enjoy Malfoy’s company, just stands and nods.
“Anyway, I have a photograph from your grandparents’ wedding in one of the rooms at the manor. You look exactly the same, you Potters, from fathers to sons.”
Nobody ever says anything. Harry doesn’t say anything. He can’t when Malfoy shuts him up with a kiss.
Harry takes his hand, and Draco almost pulls it away and shoves him off in shock.
Draco has to clench his fists two times before meeting the green of his gaze. Harry seems very uncertain, tan skin on the yellow of the bed, not really laid back any more, but held down by a tense rigidity.
“You already are,” Draco answers naturally, and promptly feels himself combust. “Alright,” he pushes out quickly to stop him from answering, “out of here, let’s go.”
Headmaster: Minerva McGonagall
“What do you mean?”
“What does excited for knowledge mean?”
Harry looks over the proceeding with great interest; there’s something about competency that makes him warm, deep inside. He takes a sip of his beer to wet his dry mouth.
Harry nods.
“Duty calls,” Harry answers amiably. He’s not mad, he was ready for such things to happen when he first accepted Draco’s invitation to fish and chips, three years ago.
Mr. Bruegel gapes at him.
“Alright, thanks,” he says and it falls flat between them.
“Mind your business. You’re not any better. Your wife just gave birth, too.”
“I know,” Potter says simply and looks at him from under his dark lashes. “My presence is fickle and you were the only one certain of it yesterday.”
He brings back two clean glasses that are decidedly not cognac glasses, but Malfoy only purses his lips for all of five seconds before pouring a knuckle of alcohol for them.
Harry hums, taking a bite on the sharp curve of Draco’s jaw. He straightens up, straddling his hips and stretching. Draco’s eyes get dark, pupil big and hungry as his gaze drops to Harry's chest. He follows the hair gathered on his sternum and trailing down in a line over his belly button, and lower, where desire makes him hard and interested. Draco swallows a single bob of his Adam’s apple, and fits his hands to Harry’s hips, thumbs pressing in to keep him steady.
Draco chokes on air; Harry tries not to feel satisfaction.
They’re handcuffed together.
“I’ve called the Aurors,” says Malfoy, standing at Harry’s elbow. “They’ll be here in a moment.”
Draco looks down in his cup of tea. No he did not; he spent the night tossing and turning worrying about Potter’s state and Draco suspects that Potter is aware of that, what with his unexpected powers.
Harry takes a sip of his beer and closes his eyes on the afternoon sun, toes tickled by the grass. Summer sits hot and crimson on his bare knees and Harry pushes the wet coolness of his bottle against it. Ron drones on about the Chudley Canons play at the last game, already staining red at the ear.
“I don’t hate my job,” affirms Harry, half-heartedly.
Draco is at loss for words. He hopes that Potter taking a step back helps. It doesn’t. When it happens, he only feels cold.
“Hello you,” Draco says and kisses him with an intensity that leaves them breathless. “You’re not supposed to be here.”
Draco Lucius Malfoy,
“This is not a joke,” he grounds out. “You’re a monster, coming here with this face when his son is here.”
“Oh, Harry, you’re not alone. Never will be again.”
Harry shakes their head. Never. They bring Draco’s hand to their lips and kiss the back of his knuckles, light as a butterfly. Draco melts, unwinds the tension of his shoulders. He doesn’t say a word, but he understands.
“I’m not.”
“Hello,” Draco says, trying to stamp out the affection that blooms in his chest. They have not spoken of him leaving yet, but it cannot be long before Harry chases him out of his house.
Draco is flush with desire by the time he finally presses Harry into the mattress. He bites Harry’s shoulder and repeats it when he’s rewarded with a moan. He rolls his hips, feels twin arousal against his own. He pants down at Harry, feels him bury his hands in the silver of his hair and skim the curve of his back as they move, closer and closer again.
Harry tenses as one. He leans forward, eager.
Harry looks back at him dubiously.
Harry looks back at him, so rattled that Draco wants to reach for his wand and Obliviate it all away, keep him from this reality where his parents are killed once more.
Harry is not quite sure if he has words to explain it and so he does the first thing that comes to mind, he wrenches his own wedding band away. The line is where it’s always been, sitting dark and menacing under the gold.
“Merlin,” says Malfoy airily, “you would think that Muggles wouldn’t be able to make this much noise without the use of Sonorus.”
They find Draco, Astoria, David and Teddy in the glass room. Draco greets them with a scowl as he fights his gloves into submission. It makes Harry smile, to see him so inconvenienced by such a simple thing, Draco who is always impeccably gracious and poised.
“You’ve been here for five hours.”
“Yes?” Malfoy says and the door swings inward, giving to Harry the view of Malfoy at his desk, bent over a letter, an unruly strand of hair falling over his forehead.
“I could?” and he wants to hit himself in the head for the inflection.
Malfoy stands at the french windows, peering outside.
“Alright,” Malfoy says and Harry looks back at him. He’s leaning on his hand, chin perched on the dip of his palm, looking thoughtful.
Draco grips at Harry shoulders, shudders when he feels the wet heat of a tongue at his throat. He closes his eyes, speaks with a wet catch to his voice.
Draco wakes up with Harry staring at him silently.
“God, yes please.”
Draco hushes him and hurriedly turns two pages. Harry recognizes the drawings there; he saw the design bloom on his skin without understanding it. He doesn’t need Draco to tell him that they’re at the fifth one.
Draco softens further, seems to get even more tender when he traces a path on the back of Harry’s hand, a quiet affection.
“Sure,” Harry says, but doesn’t move. There’s something in Malfoy’s expression that prevents him from doing so.
Ron pauses for a second. He is not looking at Harry when he answers. “A trial and probably Azkaban after.”
“I could have. I wanted to… You’re…” He settles back on the couch, as to ponder more carefully on his next words. “Your wolf is friendly. With me.”
“I guess it’s healthier to summon me for tea and complaints rather than another ghastly pub night with Weasley,” says Draco with a pretentious tilt to his head, shedding his leather gloves in the pocket of his coat and draping it over his chair in the same movement.
“I am very angry with you, Harry.”
“Come on.”
Whatever that is.
There are worse things than being turned into a werewolf, consequently losing one’s job, friends and general social life. There’s being turned into a werewolf, consequently losing one’s job, friends and general social life, and waking up in Draco Malfoy’s room for the second time.
Harry raises an eyebrow (and no, he didn’t learn it from Malfoy) and takes a sip of his wine before answering.
Draco sniffs and doesn’t comment when Harry catches up to him.
“Where the hell have you been raised that you have no idea how to handle money?” Harry asks, as he presses closes in the seat next to Draco. The interior of the bus is hot but the physical touch of Harry against his side is scorching; molten desire suffusing through his skin.
Harry flushes, the reality of the situation suddenly dwells on him. He is (gloriously) shagging Astoria’s husband and they’re not being very discreet about it. Astoria must see something on his face, because she giggles, mirthful creases on her face.
After three days of this, Draco stops mid-stride to round up on Potter. He corners him between a still-life and the portrait of a slumbering dog.
Harry listens to the pulse of his heart, high with adrenaline, flight or fight response in his ribcage.
Ginny, please. Let me apologise in person. I miss you, and the kids miss you. I’m sorry and I will make time to have dates again. I should have seen that you felt neglected. Please, talk to me.
“Of course, that’s the option you would like to take, Merlin.” He pinches the bridge of his nose. “You really need someone to tell you that you do not have to fix things as they come. You saved us all once, died for it twice. Quitting is all right. You don’t own anyone.” Draco looks at him with burning determination. “You don’t owe anyone your time. You’ve done more than enough already. Let’s someone else fix the mess, for once.”
There are hands on his hips then, not yet urgent but eager, and Draco steps back enough to unbutton his shirt. He takes half a second to curse the fact that Harry is a muggle and that he cannot spell the buttons open. All of that is forgotten when Harry bats his hands away and does it for him, face hidden in the crook of Draco’s neck, biting kisses against the tender skin.
“Good?” he asks and Harry nods frantically.
Harry grits his teeth, pulls at his anger and glances at Teddy, who looks lost and very small in the lavish plush of his chair. He takes a breath in, exhales, and unfolds his napkin on his lap.
“Don’t ask me. Your little friend there wouldn’t let us touch it once we got you in.”
It covers the mouth and nose, tightens around the jaw and throat. It’s a long drawn-out death that leaves the body red and blue
“From what I gather, James is too busy following Edward around to make any friends at all.”
“I take wolfsbane,” he says slowly, gripping the arms of his seat. There’s the hint of claws at his fingers and he takes a fortifying breath to retract them. It doesn’t help; Malfoy is here, very close.
Malfoy doesn’t act like anything is amiss, but his gaze trails to Harry every few minutes and remains here for a handful of too long seconds; Harry feels them ticking by as his face burns, his stare like a physical brand. He keeps his head down and tries to look like he has no idea that Malfoy is doing it.
“Ah, so it was a conscious effort. I wondered. There’s only so many of Teddy’s events you can miss. You didn’t have to go through the pain of assuring that we would be cordial to each other then.”
Harry takes an aggressive sip of his tea and doesn’t answer; it’s lukewarm now. Malfoy tops him off wordlessly, dark and inky in the china. The cake is good, rich sweetness on his tongue that soothes the worst of his burning hunger.
“Hello gentlemen,” says a man striding in. He doesn’t falter when he sees Harry seated here, but his heartbeat trips and startles into a breakneck rhythm.
“We won’t be long. Drink a few beers, tucks in the appetizers—they’re in the kitchen— and we’ll be back before you know it.” He presses his knuckles at Harry’s lips before straightening up, the illusion of a kiss. “I’ll have a gift ready for you,” he says with a wink.
“When you said I smelled good… Did you want to eat me?”
Malfoy pushes him inside and slams the door behind them. There’s a moment, when they simply look at each other, a silence while the storm is brewing, close enough to share warmth. Harry touches Malfoy’s elbow, tries to be gentle about it and not as brusque and desperate as he feels. Malfoy smiles at him, strained and wanting, and Harry cannot wait anymore.
“Pansy, listen, I’m fine. Completely alright.” He sighs, closes his eyes. He counts to ten in his head, tries to calm himself down; he has half a plan for the first time since he met his father’s eyes and saw the cruelty there. He needs to move one before he’s caught. “Have you brought what I needed?”
“Again?” he asks.
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft And Wizardry
By the time he’s laid back on the bed, bare feet brushing on the soft cotton of the sheets, he’s found his voice back and arches away from Draco’s questing mouth enough to speak.
Draco finally gets his shirt open and pushes it to the sides. His hands follow the curve of his ribs and Harry squirms, pushing his shirt over his shoulders.
Harry tries not to look as bitter as he feels at the idea. He nods and gets out of the car, slinging his backpack on his shoulder. His entire life rattles inside.
“Is that the Greenhand affair?” he asks.
“One would think that you’re actually afraid of children, Potter.”
“You hate your job,” finishes Draco for him and Harry closes his eyes on the truth of it, cutting sharp and abrupt.
Ast o r
They go and Harry does his hardest at ignoring the pointed stares of his former colleagues. They had almost been family once; now he can only see the aborted disgust on their face, the pain and pity of being in the same room as a beast. This is why Harry doesn’t go out in public anymore.
“Good, then. I don’t think he would go to the Aurors first, but at least there’s a limited number of people looking for me.”
Harry snorts and throws his backpack on the free bed, feeling exhausted. “Harry Potter.”
Malfoy nods. “Of course I was. I wouldn’t be in this line of work if my connections weren’t useful.” He takes a breath to look at him, really look at him, head tilted in assessment. Harry feels naked under his stare; he wants to whine. “What can I do for you then?”
“But you love each other!”
Harry looks back at her and shrugs.
Harry growls something mean under his breath and settles on the carpet with his morning cup of tea.
“Hey, Al. We’re going home, now.”
“Then nothing, this is for work.” Malfoy gathers the letter attached at her talon. “Thank you, Colette, it’s much appreciated.”
Harry laughs at that and flops on his back, spreading himself out in the humid heat of the room.
“Don’t you have anything else to do?”
“We do.”
Draco looks curiously at the muggles around them; dressed with a disarray that would appal his parents, and London outside, shining bright under the summer sun as he tries to relax back.
“And they don’t use pounds in Wiltshire?”
Draco blinks; finds his eyelashes sticky.
“She’s not in love with me, Hermione, you can’t blame her.”
“Huh. Is that why you bear the company of your ghastly flatmates?”
Harry has locked the joints of his shoulders and hands, firmly cramped around Malfoy’s notes, to ensure that he wouldn’t unconsciously do something ridiculous like take a sniff of Draco’s skin.
“Peter!” his wife cries, genuinely scandalized even if she thinks similar things about Harry.
“Then stick to the law.”
Harry tries not to stare at Malfoy. He cannot help but feel on his tongue the citrus scent of his soap, and the lavender cream he puts on his hand. It’s not just the raw smell of him  and it’s a relief to have a part of his scent obscured, hidden under cosmetics.
“Oh really? What about the Victorian self-constricting manacles? Do you think I make use of those often?”
“What now?” he wonders, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“Alright mate?” Harry asks
Draco doesn’t have an answer and only grumbles a bit when Harry pushes his hat over his face.
Harry looks at him with the startled look of the naive and Draco clears his throat, grasps his wand in firm fingers.
“What does that mean?” He asks, rising further, posh accent following. “I thought I had the room to myself.”
No, he’d rather deal with this alone than bring Scorpius in harm’s ways. He can count on the wards to awaken his son if he’s attacked.
Draco looks exasperated and fixes his annoyed gaze on Harry.
“Alright?” asks Draco, breathlessly.
Harry spends the next month in a daze, confused by the turn of events and entirely distracted from his former task. He’s discovering with virginal awe the delights of sex and the abundance of it when one has a regular partner. The fact that Malfoy is his regular partner is too much for him to process. He does a good job at ignoring it.
Harry wrinkles his nose.
“They don’t use he, Dad,” James says cautiously, peering back at them like one would look at a wounded animal ready to lash out. “They’re non-binary and use they/them pronouns.”
James scrunches up his nose and looks over Harry’s shoulder, presumably where Draco is.
“Two more years before you can experience it first hand.”
“I was on a business trip to Paris!” he exclaims, too dismissive to be genuine.
“Potter!” Malfoy hisses, too close for comfort and the budding headache crawling up his neck. “Potter!”
The Potter cottage stands upset and sagging beyond the gate before them.
“I promised you I would be cordial in front of Edward. I am a man of my word.” Belatedly, he adds, “now.”
Malfoy bites his lip; Harry wants.
Harry takes a burning sip of tea-flavoured water; he really cannot see the appeal. Malfoy does the same, but sighs with such strong pleasure, head tipped back to the light, that Harry has to look away, hide behind his own cup.
