Draco’s tone was a bit incredulous, and Harry arched an eyebrow at him, stealing one of Draco’s own usual facial expressions in response. The other man’s tone was half exasperated, half amused.
Ignoring Draco’s verbal riposte, Harry closed the remaining distance between them and came round to Draco’s side of the desk, crowding close and invading his space without a hint of hesitation or remorse. He reached out, cupping Draco’s face in his hands and angling himself perfectly to slide their mouths together in a slow, teasing glide. When the blond’s lips parted on a moan, Harry seized the opportunity to take the kiss deeper, tongue exploring the depths of Draco’s mouth with delicious slowness.
Harry gasped into Draco’s mouth, kissing him back desperately as he clutched at Draco’s back and rocked with him mindlessly. It wasn’t long before he could feel himself getting close. Breaking the kiss to say as much, his announcement was met with a wicked grin from the other man as Draco kissed along Harry’s jaw and then down his neck, sucking marks to the surface and urging him along by arching his back and grinding himself down against Harry’s cock with steadily increasing pressure.
Harry’s laugh rang out, bubbling up from deep in his chest, but he wordlessly summoned a jar of lube and caught it easily when it came soaring out of his night table drawer. Coating one hand with lube, he worked first one, then two fingers into Draco in quick succession and started pistoning them in and out, occasionally scissoring them gently to open Draco further. Draco was already fairly relaxed from the rimming, and it wasn’t long before he was demanding that Harry stop being such a priss and give it to him already, all the while pushing back eagerly when Harry added a third finger.
“He’s suspicious, but what else is new? I threw him off by assuring him that Pansy oversaw the shuffle with us, but he knows he’s stuck with the draw either way. I told him he had nothing to complain about. I mean, it’s Harry. He loves whatever anyone gets him.”
“Potter, care to rejoin us in the present? I’ve only been standing here holding this out to you for the last little bit of forever. Don’t mind me. I have all day.”
Harry whined around his mouthful, his fingernails digging into Draco’s thighs, leaving tiny half-moon crescents in the skin, but Draco voiced no complaints. He was far too busy crying out what was probably a garbled version of Harry’s name as he came down Harry’s throat, his body spasming with the force of his climax. Harry swallowed it all down with a growl of approval before pulling off and placing a few biting, open-mouthed kisses along Draco’s inner thighs as the other man shook and came down from his high.
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes, but the twitching of his lips gave away his amusement as he buried his nose in Draco’s hair, nuzzling gently before placing a soft kiss to his temple.
Harry barked a laugh as he grabbed a towel and moved past Draco toward the loo, talking over his shoulder as he went.
, of all people. A fidgety and flushed Malfoy who was pressed entirely too close to him in the cramped confines of the cupboard. And why the hell was there a broom cupboard there all of a sudden, anyway? Well, aside from the fact that the Room’s purpose was to provide people with what they needed. Harry huffed at the idea that any of this was
Harry snorted and muttered something about ‘shameless cheating’ under his breath, receiving a hard poke in the sternum from Draco for his trouble. Rubbing at the spot, he eyed the other man balefully (it was for show; he couldn’t have managed to be annoyed at the blond at that moment even if he tried) as he responded.
Draco gave a deep-throated moan as Harry set to with a great deal of enthusiasm and an equal amount of skill. It wasn’t long before he was writhing in place, hands clenching into fists as his legs started to shake. Harry gave a pleased rumble before nibbling lightly at Draco’s rim and flicking his tongue across the sensitive flesh there. Harry then brought his tongue to a point and drove it into Draco’s hole, which caused Draco to howl and utter a string of curses in quick succession as he canted his hips back and tried to take Harry deeper. Harry groaned and pressed even closer, hands caressing the globes of Draco’s arse as he continued to thrust his tongue in and out in a steady rhythm.
Draco eyed him and brandished his finger in a warning gesture before tossing his head imperiously and answering in a lofty tone.
Blinking slowly, Draco stared at the other man wordlessly for what felt like several minutes but was likely only seconds of silent consideration before his chin went up and his shoulders went back, nostrils flaring as he (finally) rose to the occasion.
“I wanted to have a rational discussion about this for once in our lives, but no, you had to act like a bloody child and avoid me all day. More fool me for assuming that you wouldn’t take the coward’s way out! But that’s fine. That’s just
“I don’t just want to take you to bed. It’s more than that. I want..I want everything with you, Draco. I’m all in. You’re it for me. You always have been, really. Just took me awhile to get there, is all. What do you think?”
doesn’t work I’m going to lock them in a broom cupboard and let nature take its course. They’ve been dancing around each other for years, both too scared to make the first move. We had to do something before they drove us all mad.”
“You’ll stay, won’t you?” Harry mumbled in a sleepy tone as he attempted to pull Draco even closer and tucked his head under the other man’s chin with a contented sigh. Draco glanced down at him with an indulgent smile and carded his fingers through Harry’s hair and whispered to him as sleep began to steal over the other man.
It was some time later that Harry found himself kneeling in the sand and scooping the stuff into a plastic bucket with a little hand trowel Luna had handed him after roping him into building a sandcastle of all things with her and Millie. He still wasn’t quite sure why he’d agreed to this, but it was Luna, and he had a hard time saying no to her for some reason. Apparently most people did. Maybe it had something to do with her inherent sweetness and the way her eyes went all large and earnest when she spoke to someone. Or maybe Harry was just a pushover. He gave up trying to reason it out in his head and packed the sand tightly as he’d been instructed (ordered, really) to do before flipping the bucket upside down where Luna indicated and carefully lifting it off to leave a crenulated tower of sand in its place.
It was quite clear, however, that Draco was the center of the whole thing, the focus, and he didn’t know
Draco’s head snapped up as the realization came to him. It was Potter. He must’ve been watching as he came back from the bar.
Gritting his teeth against a groan, Harry gripped Draco’s hips and rocked with him, unable to tear his eyes away from the sight of Draco, skin slick with sweat, his hair for once wild and unkempt. He watched the smooth line of Draco’s throat move as the blond threw back his head, babbling mindlessly as he moved atop Harry, every line of his body taut with tension as he sought his release.
Draco shook his head frantically, one hand lifting to thread his fingers through Harry’s hair and tug him into another deep, lingering kiss before he broke it off to continue in a hoarse voice,
Harry blinked at the abrupt change of subject but was unwilling to push their newfound truce any farther just then. Rubbing the back of his neck, he considered the other man for a moment before nodding toward the bathroom.
“So? We’re awake, and there’s no one else out here. We could go starkers for all anyone else would know. Hm, now there’s an idea. Ever been skinny dipping, Harry?”
“Well we wouldn’t dream of denying you the chance to whinge about it, darling. All the while you get to be the center of attention, of course!”
And with that, he got up with as much dignity as he could muster, turned around, and left the room, the silence thick and awkward in the wake of his departure. It held for the space of a couple of breaths at best before the room exploded with a cacophony of noise, seemingly everyone talking at once. Everyone, that was, except for Draco Malfoy, who sat stock still in his chair, shock and disbelief vying for dominance on his face.
But Draco didn’t make any move to accuse Harry of anything. In fact, he barely acknowledged Harry for the rest of the visit. Flummoxed, Harry finally managed to slink off and change back into his casual clothes once everyone was settled into conversations speculating who’d gotten who and how the annual reveal would go at their also traditional New Year’s Eve gathering. He wasn’t especially nervous about hosting. He had plenty of room, after all, but he
Draco trailed off and turned to the side, slinging his towel onto his bed before rifling through the wardrobe for a shirt. He wasn’t fast enough to keep Harry from noticing the pink tinge to his cheeks before he’d faced away from him, however. He watched the muscles move and flex in Draco’s back as the other man shrugged into his shirt and started doing up the buttons, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth as Draco cleared his throat and started speaking again.
He made a face, as if the very thought was offensive. Harry scowled at him but pulled out the box of chocolate ones anyway and arranged them on a plate, which he set down in front of Draco before turning away to take the kettle off the heat and pour as he answered.
Harry was tired. He’d been up for what felt like half the night, utterly distracted by the fact that Draco was sleeping mere metres away. Harry had nearly swallowed his tongue when Draco came out of the bathroom after his shower, bare except for the towel wrapped around his hips. His gaze had first snagged on the soulmark on Draco’s chest, a messily scrawled
There was a story there, and Draco was determined to get it.. just, later. Right at that moment the fact that Harry Potter was touching him was distracting him from nearly everything else that was going on. He’d wanted this, wanted
“Anyway, Harry looked a bit panicked when he read his, but he didn’t give it away. Are you sure this is going to work, ‘Mione? I mean, you’re brilliant, so of course I trust you. But why is them getting each other a present going to make them pull their heads out their arses and get on with it? I don’t get it.”
He allowed his voice to trail off, a hint of uncertainty slipping into his tone as he gave her his best harmless expression. He’d never met her on any of his previous visits to the shop, and he was hoping that she wasn’t the sort who’d as soon hex him as look at him. Thankfully she smiled at him instead and nodded as she made her reply.
Swallowing nervously, Draco hastily stopped doing just that, shaking his head and clenching and unclenching his hands in a futile gesture as he pleaded mindlessly, “No, no, please! Fuck, Harry, don’t stop! Don’t- oh
with that maddeningly posh drawl of his that made Harry want to by turns smack him and snog him senseless. Unable to remain still for long, Harry took to pacing the length of his sitting room. At least Grimmauld Place wasn’t the same dreary dump it had been when it housed the Order of the Phoenix. Harry had made sure of that, renovating from top to bottom after he’d managed to talk Kreacher down and ease the crotchety old house elf into the idea one room at a time. It had helped that Harry let him keep a few of the family heirlooms that Kreacher had found it harder to part with and promised to save anything not too Dark or cursed (or ruined) in the Black family vault at Gringotts.
too revealing (not to mention too snug) blue swim trunks, large white-framed sun shades, and nothing else. Harry couldn’t seem to tear his gaze away for several excruciating moments.
He felt Harry shift him so that he was lying on the bed on his back before his husband started to carefully and thoroughly massage the feeling back into his arms, checking to make sure that blood flow was restored properly and that Draco was comfortable. When Harry seemed to be satisfied that no harm had been done, he removed the blindfold as well and bundled Draco up in a blanket and spooned him from behind. Draco sighed tiredly and snuggled back against him, reaching one hand out of the blanket to clutch at Harry’s arm slung around his middle. It suddenly occurred to him that Harry hadn’t come. Frowning, Draco turned his head so he could look back at him without shifting his position any further.
He finally pulled back and yanked his joggers down on one side, not all the way, just enough to bare his soulmark for Draco’s perusal. Draco went very still then, his gaze riveted to the mark on Harry’s hip, and it was a moment before he reached slender fingers out to trace the letters slowly, touch lingering a bit longer than strictly necessary before withdrawing. Harry’s expression turned bewildered as a choked laugh escaped Draco, but the blond was shaking his head, already opening his mouth to explain.
Harry groaned at the memory and stood abruptly, shaking his head as if to free himself from the thought. That was how it had begun, brief flashes as he’d slowly come to realize that he was attracted to men as well as women, and while he’d tried to date here and there, as the years passed he’d never managed to fall into anything serious with either sex, as it happened. That fixation on Malfoy from sixth year had come creeping back into the forefront as their friend groups had begun to mesh, only now it held none of the suspicion of before. Now it was fascination (and dare he admit..fondness?) that forced his thoughts toward the man who used to be his boyhood nemesis.
He couldn’t suppress the needy whimper that escaped him when Harry wedged a thigh in between both of his and began to rock Draco against him with an encouraging squeeze from the hands grasping Draco’s hips. Harry broke the kiss to nuzzle along the line of Draco’s jaw until he reached his ear. Teeth nipped at his earlobe lightly, and Draco gasped, a shudder going through him as he clung to the other man, mind whirling at how quickly things had progressed. Not that he was complaining, mind. He was already painfully hard from just a bit of kissing, but he wasn’t too terribly embarrassed by it when he could feel the evidence of Harry’s reciprocal desire digging into his hip as the other man murmured into his ear, voice husky with need.
Because Draco was wanking. And Harry couldn’t stop himself from watching as Draco whined and arched up, his fist sliding over his cock, which was slick with lube he must’ve conjured for the purpose. He felt his breathing hitch and his pupils dilate even as a protest burst out of him, “Draco, what..fucking
Licking his lips with nervous anticipation, Harry did as instructed, propping himself up a bit on Draco’s ridiculous mound of pillows by the headboard and watching as Draco slid out of his own clothes and crawled across the mattress toward him. He didn’t think he’d ever been this hard in his life, and he was slightly afraid that he might lose it within the first few seconds of Draco touching him. He needn’t have worried, however, because now that Draco was taking the lead, the blond had every intention of making this last.
“Upon further reflection, Harry’s right of course. Sorry about that Luna. Rude of me. What were you saying? Something about Humdinger..whats-its?”
His cock throbbed where it was still sheathed inside Draco’s tight heat, and he groaned a little, closing his eyes and working to keep his breathing deep and even as he replied, his voice strained.
He liked it much better when Malfoy smiled, even if it was never voluntarily at Harry without that mask falling back into place as soon as he realized what he’d done. Harry wished he knew what the prat was hiding from. It’s not like anyone really expected them to be at each other’s throats any longer. Well.. nobody who mattered at least. He chewed his lip in thought. Okay, so maybe Malfoy’s parents. At least his father, but that bloody tosser was in Azkaban where he belonged. Narcissa was always perfectly cordial to Harry whenever he visited the Manor with everyone else, however. He rather suspected that had something to do with saving her son from a grisly death by fire, but hey, he’d take what he could get.
Ron pulled her into a hug, which she settled into after a brief huff of indignation that he suspected was mostly for show. Grinning down at her, he squeezed her gently as he nodded in agreement.
He took a moment to process everything, his mind eventually settling on the fact that Harry had been concerned for him, for his feelings. Taking a few deep breaths to center himself, Draco nodded a bit decisively and met Harry’s gaze evenly with his own. He reached up, threading his fingers through Harry’s hair and encircling his waist with his other arm, pressing himself tightly against a body that was solidly built and lightly muscled from years of Quidditch and dueling practice. His voice was perhaps a bit breathier than he’d have liked, but his meaning was unmistakable when he responded.
The man in question was stroking along the lettering of the tattoo before he stopped, tapping it for emphasis as he growled out in a husky, demanding tone, “Who do you belong to, Draco? Say it for me.” It took Draco several seconds to gather enough wits to reply, but even then his voice was high and a bit frantic when he managed it.
Once the dust had settled and he’d finally had a chance to figure out what he was going to do with the rest of his life he’d discovered that maybe the excitement of being on the run wasn’t half so intimidating as the daunting task of living in the aftermath. Headmistress McGonagall had offered all of them an eighth year at Hogwarts to complete their education, and while Hermione had jumped at the chance, Harry and Ron had both opted for an abbreviated course that allowed them to take their N.E.W.T.s and go straight into the Auror training program.
He gestured to the suit on the mannequin and awaited Draco’s response. The younger man swallowed, his shoulders slumping a bit as his gaze flickered to the suit and then back to Toussaint.
Harry hitched his bag higher on his shoulder and followed in Draco’s wake, down to the last door on the left. The blond was already unpacking his things, having laid claim to the bed closest to the bathroom. Harry brightened a bit as he realized that this left him near the window and tossed his duffle onto the bed and began digging through it for the smaller bag that held his shower kit. Then, kit in hand, he made for the bathroom to put everything away while Draco was still fussing with arranging his clothes in the dresser nearest his bed.
“I don’t just fancy him, Pansy. It’s worse than that. He’s.. he’s my soulmate. I’m in love with him, but I’ve gone and mucked it all up. At least before I opened my big fat mouth, we were friends. Now I don’t even know if we can be that anymore, not after I made it all weird.”
“Hush, love. You’re tired. We have time,” Harry’s voice warmed with a hint of amusement as he continued, “You did plenty for me just now, believe me. You were perfect.”
Draco’s eyes gleamed as he stood and rounded the corner of the table to draw even with Harry. He leaned into Harry’s space and crowded him against the table’s edge, his hands moving to rest palms flat on either side of him. “Anything you want me to, but only if you’re very good.”
Draco huffed but obediently quieted, relaxing against Harry and letting his eyes drift shut. He felt Harry’s thumb stroking idly against the delicate joint of his wrist, the other man’s breath stirring his hair slightly as he spoke.
He bit into his toast with a satisfying crunch just as Draco squeezed his hand gently (they hadn’t let go throughout the entire exchange with everyone over the update on their relationship status) and nearly choked when the blond smirked at him and lowered his voice so only Harry would hear him.
At some point Harry had gone from gripping his robes to wrapping his arms around him and pulling Draco flush against him from shoulder, to hip in one long line down their bodies, and Draco was having a rather difficult time hiding the fact that he was
Smirking triumphantly as his fingers closed around the quill case, he pulled it out and shut the drawer again before settling in for a morning of paperwork and chocolates, courtesy of his partner. He unwrapped the box and popped one into his mouth before picking up one of the files he’d retrieved on his way into the office. Brandishing his quill, he set to work. Harry constantly moaned about this portion of the job, but Draco was meticulous when it came to their paperwork and rather enjoyed it, though he did still make Harry fill out the bits that were relevant to him. Draco wouldn’t have a case getting thrown out due to someone arguing that he had falsified information on a case file. Even this long after the war there were still those who automatically mistrusted the name Malfoy, and he’d give them no excuse to question his work ethic.
Harry could feel himself getting close, and he growled as he canted his hips at a slightly different angle and drove forward again, searching..searching. There! Draco screamed his name, followed closely by several choice expletives as Harry’s cock found his prostate, and he proceeded to keep up a steady assault on that spot, coupled with the quickening pulls of his hand on Draco’s cock. He could tell by the desperation on Draco’s face and the way his body was beginning to tense that he was almost there, and he just needed that little bit extra to push him over the edge.
“And don’t call him Weasel, please. You know I don’t let him call you Ferret anymore, so play nicely. We’ll see you at pub night on Friday.”
Besides being uncomfortable with the idea in general, he was particularly discomfited due to the fact that he’d ended up in there with
Harry sighed and let his eyes slide shut as Draco laid his head back down and hugged him close. As they drifted off, Harry mumbled a soft goodnight into the quiet of the room.
for years, but his rejection in their first year and the subsequent rivalry that had followed had sort of derailed his initial intentions. Nevermind the whole ‘Dark Lord, being on the wrong side of a war’ thing. That needn’t be mentioned ever again as far as Draco was concerned. He’d survived all of the awkward apologies and had thought all he could hope for was the uneasy truce they had all come to, but this? This was an unexpected windfall, and if he had to use the excuse of a stupid party game to make it happen? Well, never let it be said that Draco Malfoy wasn’t an opportunist.
Draco blinked and jerked to attention as Harry turned around and looked at him oddly before repeating his question.
Draco gave him a little shove before whirling about and storming away, firing off one last parting salvo over his shoulder as he left.
Draco was going to murder Hermione Granger-Weasley. This might not have come as a surprise to most of the people of either of their acquaintance back in their school days, but as neither of them were children anymore it was not, strictly speaking, in character any longer. Furthermore, as he now considered her one of his closest friends it was probably apparent to everyone, himself included, that this was merely a fit of pique on his part. Draco, however, felt rather justified seeing as she had just told him who he’d ‘randomly’ been assigned for their annual Secret Santa gift exchange amongst all of their friends. Harry
With the school year finally complete and the stress of N.E.W.T.s just barely survived, Blaise had insisted that they all spend a week at his family’s private resort for a last hurrah together before their real adult lives began. Harry was both dreading it and looking forward to it in equal measure. Blaise had been his roommate for eighth year, and as such, had had numerous occasions to spot Harry’s soulmark despite his best attempts to keep it hidden. Harry was almost positive that Blaise recognized the handwriting, but to his shock, as far as he could tell, the other man had kept it to himself.
Harry cut the other man off there, shifting to give himself more leverage to thrust up into Draco, an arm around him to steady him as his other hand slid between their bodies to grasp Draco’s erection and begin to jerk him off in hard, fast pulls. He was murmuring reassurance into the blond’s ear as he urged him on.
“Maybe that last one a bit, yeah. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go and pretend I didn’t just humiliate myself in front of you and all our friends if you don’t mind.”
Recognizing the underlying amusement in the assertion, Harry smiled as he heard Draco moving away from the door and heading down to breakfast without waiting for a reply. It was a relief to have worked things out with the other man, even if they hadn’t exactly discussed Harry’s confession in the process. He sighed as he turned on the shower and started to strip. One step at a time, he thought. Draco had said they needn’t forget it, after all. Harry felt the faint stirrings of hope fluttering in his chest, his fingertips unconsciously brushing against the soulmark on his hip before he stepped into the shower, suddenly mindful of the time. He didn’t want to miss breakfast. All of a sudden, he was ravenous and his mind drifted back to a certain blond as he started to soap himself down, a slow smile curving the corners of his lips upward as he started to hum a little low and slightly off-key.
“Asked me out, of course. What else? And honestly, Harry, are you a wizard, or aren’t you?” Draco rolled his eyes and pulled out his wand, vanishing the mess and banishing the dish towel, which now hung limply from Harry’s slacked grip as he stared at Draco. After a minute of tense silence, Harry shook himself and finally met Draco’s gaze evenly.
“Good afternoon. I’m here to pick up a custom order under the name of Malfoy. I had set an appointment with Monsieur Toussaint to come by today. I do hope I haven’t mistaken the time..”
I’m about to ask this, but obviously neither of you is fit to handle it on your own. You admitted you fancy him, so what’s the hold-up?”
And so the peace was kept, and everyone carried on with their various beach activities, one of the highlights of which was a volleyball tournament that ended when Ginny sent the ball hurtling into the distance with a wildly overenthusiastic spike, and no one could find it despite an extensive search. Harry secretly thought it was really because people had given up in favor of the lemonade and snacks that Luna had brought down from the house, but he was hardly complaining at that point. He was thinking about that afternoon now that he was safely ensconced in his four-poster for the night, idling over the memory of the way the sunlight had glinted off of Draco’s hair.
Blushing to the roots of his hair, Harry dove onto his bed, yanked the curtains closed around him, and hid his face in his hands, taking deep breaths until he could calm himself back down. It was only the first day, and he was already in so much trouble. After he heard the bathroom door click open and made sure of Draco’s retreating footsteps down the hall, he hastily changed into his own swimwear and emerged from the relative safety of his bed. Taking a moment to glance over Blaise’s ridiculous itinerary, he saw that they were indeed scheduled for ‘recreational beach time’ now. With another sigh, this one accompanied by a massive eye roll, he slowly ventured out of the room to join everyone else on the beach.
to know who’d done it. Who had drawn him like that? Given him something so achingly personal? His gaze paused on Potter. Could it possibly be..? No, no, Draco was being foolish. It wasn’t possible. Harry was a terrible liar. There was no way he could keep something like that a secret for any length of time. But still…
And with that they proceeded to conclude their business. Toussaint had his employee pack the suit in a lovely garment bag that bore the logo of the shop and saw Draco to the door. Bidding both of them a good day, Draco bowed politely to them both and swept out into the clear afternoon, purchase in hand and expression newly determined. Harry might be the Savior of the Wizarding World, but Draco was a Malfoy and a Slytherin besides. He was proud and clever and quite used to having his way, and Potter wasn’t going to know what hit him.
That earned a surprised laugh from Harry. He’d missed who actually suggested the whole thing. It had been Seamus who’d grabbed him and chivied him into joining in before gallivanting off to wrap himself around Dean on one of the sofas scattered about.
Unbeknownst to him caught up in his fit of pique as he was, both Pansy and Hermione had appraised his reaction and shared a knowing look before giving each other the smallest of nods. Pansy then rose gracefully and took Harry in hand, even going so far as to make him do a little walk about so everyone could see him in his finery from all angles before ferrying him back to their settee and settling back down though Harry protested this with a weakly voiced,
“Thank you for the advice and your excellent service, Monsieur. I shall endeavor to be worthy of both.”
Harry’s eyes widened, and his mouth went dry at both the use of his given name and the very thought of being naked in the water with Draco. The blond had bent down to peel off his socks and tuck them into his shoes before straightening and locking eyes with Harry, a challenging little glint in them as his lips curved into his patented smirk.
“There, that’s better. Now, to cover all our bases. Yes, Draco, there was a bet, and Ron is right, Ginny, you were off by three days from the looks of things. Greg won. And honestly, I don’t know why you’re surprised with this lot. Did Harry tell you
Breathing harshly, Harry slowed to a stop as they both ceased shaking. Mindful of causing Draco any discomfort, he pulled out carefully and eased Draco’s leg back down before rolling to flop onto his back and tug the blond toward him. He muttered a cleaning spell to take care of both of them and the bedding, too tired all of a sudden to bother with anything that required moving from this spot. Draco laughed and stretched lazily before curling against Harry’s side and throwing a leg over his and an arm loosely about his waist for good measure.
Harry was positive he heard the word “cow” among Draco’s grumbling as he passed them without so much as a glance toward Pansy when their prickly host handed off the first gift to a chortling Blaise. As was tradition, they waited for each person to open their gift and let everyone see what it was and offer comments before moving on to the next one. After Blaise’s much admired pocket watch, it was onto Neville, who got a very nice pair of dragon hide gloves that were spelled with enchantments designed to protect him from some of the nastier magical plants he worked with in the greenhouses at Hogwarts, having taken over for Professor Sprout when she’d retired the year before.
Draco huffed and fussed with the tissue paper lining the box before he forced himself to stop fidgeting and instead focused his attention on each of their friends to see if anyone was acting suspiciously. He wanted..no he
Sweat was trickling down Draco’s temples, and he was pretty sure that if Harry didn’t stop touching him he was going to come before things went any further than mutual hand jobs. Not that this wasn’t nice. Well, nice was an understatement. Draco felt like his brains were melting and leaking out of his ears if he were being honest, but he wanted more and he wanted it
“Potter, what in the name of Merlin’s saggy bollocks are you doing out here at half-past one in the morning? I’ll have you know I was perfectly comfortable where I was before waking up to realize you needed fetching. If I knew I was going to be spending half my vacation minding you, I’d have gone somewhere with room service instead and left you to your own devices.”
the first time without any of the rest of their friends along. When they got to the kitchen, Draco settled himself at a stool behind the island and watched Harry move about, putting the kettle on and getting out cups and saucers almost in a daze.
“I’m in love with you, you great oaf, so yes, of course it’s more. And I knew all that already. Did you think I imagined just anyone could give me that sort of present and not have it
Harry watched as shock flashed across the other man’s face before Draco’s gaze focused on him, and he was seized roughly by the front of his shirt and hauled in for another scorching kiss. Harry let Draco have his way for the time being and leaned into the kiss, hands sliding up to card through the silky strands of his hair, tightening reflexively when Draco nipped at his bottom lip before sucking on it.
It was nearly thirty minutes and several chocolates later that Draco started to feel decidedly uncomfortable. He’d loosened his tie and even gone so far as to unbutton the top two buttons of his shirt, but the room still felt stifling. Setting aside his quill, he removed the tie entirely and contemplated rolling up his shirt sleeves. He was usually loath to be so informal at work, much less expose the faded Mark on his left forearm to the scrutiny of others, but the temperature was becoming unbearable. He’d have to send a memo to maintenance about the atmospheric charms being on the fritz again.
“Why else do you think I was so awful to you? I was jealous and sick with wanting what I thought I’d never have.”
love until halfway through eighth year. That day we were all hanging out by the Great Lake, and you fell in while trying to retrieve that hideous hat Hermione made you; that’s when I knew. I thought to myself, ‘I’m in love with that idiot. Merlin, help me.’ And yes it had to be Veritaserum. I told you. I couldn’t have said it otherwise, and if you’re so smart, how would
He wasn’t quite sure how much time may have passed before he heard the sound of footsteps thumping down the beach toward him. A smile quirked his lips when a familiar blond head obscured his view of the night sky as Draco loomed over him, one elegant eyebrow arched, and that posh drawl Harry loved so much washed over him.
“Thanks, and yeah, er- no. Wait.. didn’t sleep much. New place, maybe. We do! Get along. He-it’s fine.”
“So! Soulmates united at last. Wondered how long it would take you to ‘fess up. You’re welcome for the room-sharing, by the way. But the important question here is, who kissed who first? Did you have a nice time last night? Good thing there’s built-in silencing charms on the rooms, eh?”
The next two days passed in a more comfortable manner as Harry and Draco relaxed into their usual banter. Only now, their teasing held a distinctly flirtatious edge that Harry returned with slowly mounting boldness as time went on. Their friends all observed this with varying levels of amusement, and Blaise, in particular, was looking rather smug. In fact, the only thing keeping him from commenting about it aloud was the threatening glint in both Pansy’s and Hermione’s eyes whenever he opened his mouth to try. He always closed it again promptly. As much as Blaise loved to stir the pot, even he knew better than to court the wrath of either of them. They were downright terrifying when they were angry.
Flushed and more than a little worked up at this point, Harry still couldn’t quite bring himself to give in to the temptation to give Draco what he was asking for. This brazen display was so unlike him that there had to be more going on here. Brow furrowing, he managed to wrench his gaze away from his partner to take in the rest of the room. At the sight of the open box of chocolates on Draco’s desk, it suddenly clicked into place. “Shit, it’s the chocolates.”
But Harry had a feeling that Blaise’s discretion only went so far, and this beach getaway would be the perfect opportunity for some Slytherin meddling. Sighing, Harry muttered a drying charm for his hair and moved into his room at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place in order to dress and then begin packing. Stuck in a house with not only Blaise, but Draco, Pansy, Greg, Millie, Luna, and the Gryffindor lot for seven whole days and nights? It was going to be a long week.
implied that Harry had been doing the same was of no consequence. Harry had surely only been caught up in the moment.
“Honestly, Draco, I don’t know why you’re being so difficult about this. It was random. Pansy and Ron were both there. And Harry’s easy to shop for, so you have nothing to complain about. You really shouldn’t have said, you know. It takes the fun out of things. Now stop whinging and take your envelope. I have to head back to the office.”
Draco, who’d made a face and sauntered off ahead, probably to make sure he got first pick of the beds.
Affronted, Draco puffed up and glared at him even as he was compelled to answer anyway. “I’d had a crush on you all through school, but I wasn’t actually
He watched as Draco avoided meeting his eyes and took another sip of his tea before setting it down. The other man fidgeted in place, lacing and unlacing his fingers, tapping on the tabletop, spinning his cup on its saucer. It was unlike him and made Harry’s brow furrow with concern. He was just about to ask him what was the matter when Draco took a deep breath, straightened his spine and reached into a pocket and pulled out a vial with a clear liquid inside.
, of all people. Nevermind that he found Weasley tolerable (and a menace who regularly thrashed him at chess) now. Back then he’d envied their friendship quite keenly.
Harry blinked up at him for a moment, his expression clearly stating that he thought Draco’d gone round the twist, and he said as much.
Harry startled so badly he dropped his cup, splashing tea across the tabletop. Cursing, he jumped up and grabbed a dish towel and began mopping up the mess with it. “Why haven’t I
Draco pulled Harry closer at that, kissing him fiercely, and for a few minutes they got lost in exploring each other’s mouths. When they finally came up for air, Harry smiled down at him and grabbed a pillow from the pile behind Draco, tapping one of his hips with a fingertip in a wordless command for him to lift up. Draco complied and let Harry stuff it beneath him to aid in their next endeavor while Draco spread his legs and brought his knees up to his chest. He inhaled sharply when Harry scooted toward him on his knees, and he felt the hard length of him pressing against his arse.
Harry took it without missing a beat, lacing their fingers together and switching to his other hand to bring his toast to his mouth as if there were nothing out of the ordinary occurring. Pansy put her head in her hands, and Ginny was the one to finally break the silence that had settled over the room.
Grinning mischievously, Harry bit Draco lightly on one arse cheek only hard enough to leave the lightest impression of his teeth. When Draco’s hips stuttered and a guttural moan slipped past his lips, Harry laughed again and carefully withdrew his fingers as he replied.
At that Harry’s head came up, nostrils flaring as he leaned into Draco’s space a bit, green eyes meeting gray evenly. He’d never been good at resisting the other man’s taunts, and this placed him squarely back into his comfort zone as he rose to the occasion at last.
He couldn’t take his eyes off of the other man as he began to thrust, holding Draco’s head still as he took his pleasure in the delectable heat of his lover’s mouth. Harry lost all sense of time and place, his only anchors being the sound of his own needy grunts, the wet slap of skin on skin, and Draco’s eager sucking. When he felt himself getting close, he tugged Draco off of him, the blond instinctively gripping the base of his cock to keep Harry from coming too soon.
His control snapping at last, Harry pulled out and flipped them, rolling Draco onto his back and hiking one of his legs up over Harry’s arm. Holding him open like that, he entered him again swiftly, which had Draco crying out and scrabbling for purchase against the bed covers as Harry began pounding into him relentlessly. He saw Draco’s cock stirring and slowly filling out again under the onslaught of sensation, and the blond was keening and incoherent at that point, eyes wild as he met Harry thrust for thrust.
Harry had put down his toast and was now looking slowly around the room at each of their friends, his blush spreading from his face, all the way to the tips of his ears now. Draco, however, was glaring at Ginny in particular, a muscle jumping in his temple as he snapped out a query.
He gripped Harry’s shaft at the base and gave it a few pumps that left Harry gasping before lowering his head and taking the tip into his mouth. As his tongue dipped into the slit, Harry’s eyes rolled back in his head, breath escaping him in a low moan as he sank his hands into Draco’s hair, careful not to pull it. Draco pulled off for a moment to flash Harry a devious smirk.
That last bit was a rather obvious ploy to redirect her attention, and she gave him a withering look to let him know that she saw right through him but had decided to answer him anyway.
He stared up at Draco, his gaze hot with hunger as he switched to the other nipple and reached between Draco’s legs at the same time to palm his shaft through his clothes, stroking firmly. The blond cried out softly and arched into the touch, fingers clutching at the duvet as he bucked his hips mindlessly for a while. Harry was in no hurry and would’ve happily continued to tease Draco for longer, but the other man was losing patience fast. He watched the awareness slowly spill back into Draco’s face and gave a low noise of protest when he was made to pull off and instructed by Draco in a haughty, demanding tone to strip and lie down on his back.
“I wanted to talk to you, as I said. Only.. I need a bit of encouragement, so.” Gesturing to the vial, Draco uncorked it and used the stopper to place three drops into his mouth, swallowing as he replaced the top and stowed it away again.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. This was it; this was the moment. He had to tell him, but how would Draco react? Would he be happy? Would he be mad that Harry hadn’t said something sooner? Some of the panic must have shown in his expression because the next thing he knew, Draco was pulling him down onto the bed beside him and wrapping Harry up in strong arms, one hand cupping the back of his neck and cradling it gently as he urged him to rest his head on Draco’s shoulder. Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, hugging him back tightly and trying to take deep breaths to calm himself. His voice was a bit muffled as a result, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to look up yet.
Without warning, Draco flipped them over and withdrew from Harry. Harry started whining at the loss when Draco said, "Turn around for me, love."
He ground his cock directly against Harry's over-stimulated prostate. "Ahhhh," Harry cried, his head falling against Draco's shoulder. "Alright, Draco, ahh stop please..."
"You're not stealing from him, you're borrowing," Ginny said, "And I promise you we'll find out who she is and leave right after, trust me when I say I'm the last person who wants to watch my ex-boyfriend make out with another girl."
Ron and Ginny were glaring daggers at him, and inevitably, Harry began to stir. He rubbed his face on Draco's chest and opened his eyes taking in his surroundings. Frowning he noticed the hard, yet warm chest he was resting upon and looked up to find none other than Draco Malfoy.
"What a wise decision," Draco mused. "Are you sure that's the only reason my boyfriend is here tonight? Or......" He drawled bending down to nip and suck on the skin of Harry's neck, "Did he have something else in mind?"
"Indeed," Harry agreed, hands against the wall, smiling and looking over at Draco who proceeded to capture their lips much more sweetly than before.
"Alright, Potter let's take you to the infirmary," Malfoy said. Harry was certain that he heard the panic in Malfoy's voice. He started to help Harry up.
Draco knew better than to argue with his godfather. He looked at Potter with a disgusting expression, well masking how adorable he thought Potter's tail looked, twitching in its own accord.
Harry nodded slowly and grasped the glass bottle settled in the middle of the circle and spun it. It landed on Justin Finch-Fletchley, who was openly gay and proud of it. Harry smirked, it was time to amp up the game.
Hermione turned as red as a tomato and Ron hid his face behind his legs. Harry truthfully did not need to know that about Hermione, but in comparison to his best friend giving his other best friend a blowjob, Harry would prefer knowing if they'd done anal.
There was no resistance whatsoever, Harry's hole opened up and his tight channel grew even wetter, easing the way. Harry moaned and moaned, whilst Draco was trying his best not to come, his prick being enveloped in the tight, wet heat of Harry.
Harry whimpered and turned his head over his shoulder biting his lip in an attempt to be quiet. He reached an arm around Draco's neck and brought the blonde's face closer to his.
Draco swallowed. He had always thought that Potter had the finest arse in all of Hogwarts. Merlin, the way Potter would lean forward whilst trying to catch the snitch, displaying his bum for all of Draco's glory. Draco longed to grope Potter's cute bubble butt, some of his fantasies went as far as to pondering what Potter's arse would look like wrapped around his cock. Speaking of, which seemed to be getting a sudden rush of blood flow after witnessing the conspicuous curve of Potter's arse.
Ginny and Ron had just witnessed a black plug being pulled from Harry's arsehole. Ron thought he was actually going to be sick.
After about ten more minutes or so of working in uncomfortable silence. Malfoy suddenly cursed. "Bollocks, Potter you completely forgot to get the rat's blood. Can't you do anything right for once?" He looked over to Harry, who just sat there blinking.
Harry rolled his eyes, hurrying to make his way out of the Great Hall, he heard snickering coming from behind him in response to Ron's comment. He didn't pay any attention to it, however. His underwear was getting extremely wet and he could feel his erection growing, without his robes to cover his hard cock, Harry opted to run from the Entrance Hall all the way to the Eighth and Seventh-year common room.
Hermione was just about ready to faint from the utter adorableness and was squealing out loud. "Awwww," he heard her tell Ron in his state of drowsing off, "can we keep Harry like this for a bit longer?"
"It's alright Weasley, nothing to be ashamed of," Draco said with a curled up Harry still in his lap, refusing to move, "everyone's admitted to it anyway."
The whole room fell silent, eerily silent. Harry couldn't bear to see the look on Ginny's face. Where had all his Gryffindor courage gone? He heard her draw in a sharp breath as she removed herself from Harry's lap and went to sit next to Luna, burying her face in Luna's shoulder. Harry couldn't bear it, he knew she was crying from the soft sobbing which broke through the silence. Malfoy was staring at him, his brows furrowed and eyes unblinking. Harry tore away from his gaze to look at Hermione who started to soothingly rub his back, whispering words of comfort into his ear. Ron was on the verge of laughing at sister being so terrible at sex, or scolding his best mate for making Ginny cry.
So here he was, crouching against the wall, with a painfully hard erection. He had realized that the wetness in his pants was from his hole producing slick, but he couldn't understand what was happening to him. He had a sudden urge to shove his fingers in his arse, but no matter how many fingers he could cram up there it wouldn't be enough. He came repeatedly to the thought of a thick cock pounding into him, but no matter how much he came, it still wasn't enough.
Draco’s answer was prompt and matter of fact. It was also woefully short of any kind of explanation. Harry set his cup down with an audible click, and his next words nearly exploded out of him in an exasperated rush. “What the hell did you do that for?! It’s dangerous! Get up. We’re going to St. Mungo’s. Of all the ridiculous—” Draco cut him off mid sentence, his answer causing Harry to freeze halfway out of his chair.
“Look, about yesterday.. I’m sorry. You were right. I was avoiding you, and it was a shit thing to do. I hadn’t meant to say any of that, and I was embarrassed. And..er, sorry again. About-about what I said. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable, and we can just forget it if you want. I won’t make it weird, I swear—”
“Don’t even think about hogging all the counter space in there, Potter. I know there’s a double sink, and the one closer to the bath is
Toussaint tsked at him and circled him once slowly, as if taking his measure. Finally, he spoke again, and this time it was as if he were issuing a challenge.
He wrapped a hand around his erection, gasping in relief at the sensation as he started to stroke, his free hand coming up to stifle the sounds he was making as he continued to pleasure himself. All thoughts of trying to hold back had fled, and in their place was Harry. When Draco closed his eyes he imagined a much darker hand wrapped around his cock, a beloved voice murmuring in his ear. He bit down on his knuckle, hips rocking as he frantically sought relief from the need roaring through him. Unfortunately (and unbeknownst to him) Draco would find none via his own touch, and he was becoming more and more desperate as the minutes ticked on.
Harry’s eyes snapped open and locked with Draco’s at that last bit, his cock jumping in Draco’s hand reflexively. Even with the warning, he wasn’t entirely prepared when Draco took him back into his mouth and started to suck vigorously, head bobbing as he took Harry deeper. Cursing harshly, Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s hair and flexed his hips up on Draco’s downstroke. The blond gave a pleased hum around his mouthful and relaxed his throat, allowing Harry to set the pace.
told her that lately when he closed his eyes it wasn’t red hair or soft curves that he imagined against him in intimate moments but sharper, more angular features, masculine hands on his skin, and sometimes..only sometimes, the briefest flashes of platinum hair and a challenging smirk.
“For fuck’s sake, Harry, you’re making me dizzy just watching you. You already know I want to shag you rotten. What are you working yourself into such a lather for?”
So saying, Harry pulled him into another deep, lingering kiss. They continued on in this fashion until they were both breathless and at the end of their patience with the limited options being pressed up against the kitchen counter presented them, so Harry laced his fingers with Draco’s and led him back down the hall and up the stairs to his bedroom. Pushing open the door, he scratched the back of his neck in a nervous gesture and stammered out an apology for the mess.
“You can moan all you want, sweetheart, but if you try to get yourself off by rubbing against my legs I’ll stop and leave you immobilized in full harness for a while instead.”
The thing most of the wizarding world didn’t know, however, was that underneath Draco’s impeccably tailored robes (and the occasional 3 piece designer Muggle suit) hid some of Harry’s most gorgeous works of art. Draco had volunteered to be his own personal canvas, and he guarded this secret jealously. Only their families and closest friends knew, and Draco preferred to keep it that way. He treasured each tattoo like they were a gift Harry had given him. In fact, most of them were. The dragon that curved along the right side of his ribcage was for his birthday one year, the spill of narcissus, pansies, lilies, and molly flowers across one shoulder on Mother’s Day to remind him of all the best mothers in both their lives, the constellation that bore his name forked through with lightning cradled in a crown of stag antlers sat directly over his heart was from their first dating anniversary, and quite a few more, besides.
, and his breath gusted hotly against the skin of Malfoy’s cheek, causing the other boy to shiver against him.
. He touched it with tentative fingertips. It was a secret he’d kept for nearly two years at this point, though he hadn’t thought much about it in that first year, to be honest. He’d been rather distracted, what with being on the run, hunting for Horcruxes, and then winning a war and all. Then, of course, had been all the funerals, the Death Eater trials, and then he’d been free to brood about it for most of his make-up year at Hogwarts.
Ron let out a snort of laughter, and Hermione beamed up at him. They exchanged knowing looks before moving on to chatting briefly about their mornings together. It wasn’t often they got the chance to spend time together at work, so they savored the stolen moments that remained of their lunch breaks before promising to see each other at home and parting ways. Ron headed back to the DMLE, leaving Hermione to her stacks of paperwork. She was quickly climbing the ranks in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and had already made incredible inroads when it came to drafting and seeing to the enactment of policies in favor of the fair treatment of other sentient Magical Beings. She was going to be Minister one day. He just knew it, and he couldn’t be more proud of her if he tried.
“Oh, Harry, didn’t you sleep at all? Here, have some tea,” pausing to hand him a cup and start loading his plate with things she knew he liked, “Was it really that bad, rooming with Draco? I thought you two were getting along now.”
Harry went bright red at the accusation, his gaze immediately dropping to the tabletop. Conversation seemed to halt as everyone’s attention shifted to what was occurring between the two one-time rivals, and he felt the muscles in his shoulders tightening, their stares an uncomfortable weight against his heated skin. It took two tries before he could clear his throat enough to respond, his voice low but surprisingly steady.
Harry chuckled darkly, amusement dancing in his eyes as he rolled his hips against Draco’s, hands kneading the small of his back as he held him steady.
Draco was currently draped over Harry’s lap, stark naked, hands tied rather artfully behind him with a length of black nylon rope specifically suited for the purpose. He was also blindfolded, though Harry had forgone the gag this time, he’d said, “because I want to hear all those pretty little noises I can wring out of you, love.” Just the memory was enough to make Draco shudder with want, though at the moment he had no need of a reminder when his bottom was still quivering slightly, the sensitive skin hot to the touch and bright red from the spanking Harry had just finished administering.
It also hadn’t hurt that Harry had testified at Draco’s and Narcissa’s trials, but he’d managed to scrounge up enough tact to not point that out at the time. Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Harry rolled his eyes and followed Draco to the kitchen and put the kettle on as his guest made himself comfortable at the little table across the way. Their bickering was mostly for show these days, but old habits die hard (and of course they each enjoyed riling the other up). “So is there a reason you decided to drop by, or is this another one of those ‘you got bored and thought, Aha! I’ll go bother Potter. That’s always good for a laugh’ moments?”
Hermione’s expression had begun to clear after the reassurance of the envelope’s delivery, but it quickly darkened again at the mention of the Head Auror. That man was always bothering Harry, pulling him for special missions or consulting with him on especially Dark cases, sometimes going so far as to ask him to intercede with the Minister, which always made Harry extremely uncomfortable, but she knew Harry had trouble saying no to people, particularly when they needed his help. She was becoming increasingly concerned about her friend being spread too thin, and she said as much now to Ron.
He watched Draco’s pupils expand, smiled at the heaving of the other man’s chest, couldn’t help but lean down and press his lips to the untidy scrawl of his own familiar
And of course he missed Harry’s soft chuckle and the look of utter devotion he bestowed upon him as he whispered into the sudden quiet of their bedroom.
The concern in Harry’s voice warmed him from the inside out, banishing the rest of Draco’s irritation. He replaced his cup on its saucer and favored Harry with a fond look. The other man couldn’t fail to notice, and suddenly it was Harry’s turn to blush. Draco decided the time for playing coy was past. He might not have a Gryffindor’s courage, but he had Slytherin ambition in spades. When he wanted something he went after it with a single-minded focus that worked just as well.
He yawned and slowly opened his eyes, blinking to get the blurriness out of them. Once his vision cleared he was met with the angry faces of most of Gryffindor. Up front and center, towering over him was none other than Granger, Weasley and the Weaslette, whom Draco figured that annoying screechy voice claiming that Potter was her boyfriend had belonged to.
"Such a filthy mouth, Potter," Draco growled possessively, now fucking Harry with no abandon. "I'll fill you up you wanton slut."
"Potter! Hurry up! I need the dragon tails now!" Malfoy barked all of a sudden, shaking Harry out of his daydreaming stupor.
"It's fine, Harry," Ginny whispered reassuringly, then she winked suggestively, "It's okay if I'm an eight, that just means that we have a lot to work on...so we should get started very, very soon." She smiled, licking the outer shell of his ear. Oh how Harry wished she was an eight...he couldn't...no he couldn't. He was about to beg Malfoy for another question, or pick dare instead when the answer came tumbling out of his own free will.
Ron and Hermione looked at each other, Hermione finally decided to sit next to him on the bed and tell him the news. "Harry, what do you last remember?"
"'Mione, what the fuck?" Ron roared, getting on his feet. "You wanna just sit here and watch, as Harry gets fucked up the arse with Malfoy's cock?"
Harry's eyes flew open in shock and he startled, trying to get up from the table. Both Hermione and Ron looked at him worriedly, "Harry, are you okay?" Hermione asked softly, worry tinging her voice, "What's wrong?"
That's how they ended up knocking over the cauldron for the second time. Only this time, fortunately for Malfoy, he had let go of the rod and jumped away in the nick of time, leaving Harry spiraling to the floor with the force of the pull, bathing him in the potion from head to toe.
Draco responded to that by tightly grabbing Harry's narrow waist and crashing his mouth onto Harry's.
Harry will never forget the look of absolute shock on the witch's face as their eyes locked. He closed his eyes and prayed that it was all a nightmare.
Harry started whimpering further and reaching out for someone with his arms, further confirming her theory.
"Always wanted to do that," Draco said breathlessly as he began sucking on Harry's neck, quickly finding Harry's sensitive parts. "Especially when you bend over in Potions, you drive me crazy..."
"You were pretty happy snuggled up against me earlier," Malfoy countered, then he smirked, "You made the most adorable squeaky noises."
"Aww, Harry.....you're so beautiful...." Harry's cheeks heated up as he wrapped his legs around Draco's waist. Draco arms which had been exploring the smooth skin on Harry's back dipped down to his arse as he groped it hungrily.
"Heavens, what is the matter here, there's a huge crowd gathered outside the portrait as you lot have yet to move your limbs past the entrance. For goodness sakes.."
"Sorry, you guys, you know I didn't mean that, it's just that I know Harry and he loves my sister and-" Ron cut himself off, shaking his head violently. Harry resorted to burying his face even deeper in Draco's chest, wanting to escape all the commotion.
Draco sighed, slumping his shoulders. "Fine," he muttered under his breath when in reality his hands were shaking with the mere thought of holding Harry, let alone carrying him.
Harry's eyes shot up at that and Draco wanted to kiss his adorable big green eyes. So he settled for kissing Harry on the lips instead. He tilted Harry's chin up and leaned forward, allowing Harry to move away if he wanted to. Harry, however, did no such thing. Their lips met, softly at first, nothing more than a peck. Harry then immediately threw his arms around Draco's neck pulling him closer and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. Harry relaxed into the kiss, allowing Draco's prodding tongue to enter his mouth. Soon they were snogging passionately, Harry submitting into the kiss, with Draco's tongue exploring every inch of his mouth. Draco pulled Harry up from the floor, clutching on to him even tighter. Harry moaned into his mouth as Draco's hands wandered down to his arse, squeezing Harry's perky bubble butt.
"Good then," she said dragging Harry towards the cushions. "If you're done with your dawdling Harry James Potter, you will join us for some inter-house cooperation."
Madam Pomfrey smiled at the sight and began running diagnostic tests on Harry. She sighed with relief once she was done.
"Merlin Harry! You're still so tight! Your hole is so greedy you're swallowing my fingers. Arrghhh I can feel my come inside you, god you're so wet!" Harry had had enough of Draco's teasing. The dirty talk was the last straw.
or Snape's indignant yelling, for he was crouched over Potter as a bright white light enveloped Potter's body.
Draco was more than happy to comply, he pulled Harry's cheeks apart and gasped. Harry's hole was lovely, so tight and puckered up and it was dripping an abnormal amount of slick.
Ron screamed, "NO NO NO I cannot believe I'm seeing Harry and Malfoy naked! AHHHH My eyes! My eyes!"
"All you needed to do was ask." With that, he pulled the plug out of Harry's hole, it was about 10 inches long and quite thick, but not as thick as Draco.
His response was met with cheering and whistling whilst Ron tried his best to avert Harry's gaze. Ginny chuckled and kissed him lightly, Seamus and Zacharias high fiving each other and whistling. And Draco Malfoy was glowering even harder than last week. Harry didn't understand, what was the git's problem? Was he jealous of Ginny? No, that can't be it, Malfoy disliked the Weasleys with effort. So what could it be? Maybe he hated seeing Harry happy, although Harry doubted he was too happy when he lost his virginity. He had expected it to feel mindblowing, and instead, it was quite a letdown. He had finished and so had Ginny, and Harry had blamed it on inexperience during their first time. However, things didn't get much better for Harry since then. Ginny loved it, so they had sex quite regularly, but Harry couldn't help but feel lost whenever they made love. He couldn't help but imagine what it felt like for Ginny, to be on the receiving end of things, to have someone pound into you from behind. Harry knew something was wrong the second he came with the vision of Malfoy's face centimeters above his. Speaking of Malfoy, Parkinson was holding on to his wrist, anchoring him to the floor and preventing him from leaving. He couldn't make out what Malfoy was saying due to the still ongoing cheering but from the looks of it, he was having a fit.
Snape sighed, obviously unfazed. "Draco, take Potter to Madam Pomfrey," he drawled in his usual monotonous voice.
Everyone was staring at them, their heads immediately turning to the source of the crash. Draco barely registered Granger's shriek of
"Awww," Harry said, "you've gone soft." Draco scowled and spanked Harry again earning a squeak from the shorter boy. "I have not gone soft Harry Potter!" he countered. Harry turned back to look at him again, "Well I like the new you, and I think Hermione would be open to forgiving you, I don't know how Ron will take it, but he is a brother to me and I know that he'll come around sooner or later."
Draco knelt down and rolled Harry over to face him. He tried his best not to gasp, Potter was utterly adorable! Draco had always found Harry undoubtedly cute, even though he went out of his way to hide his feelings. Watching Harry's peaceful face asleep with his new appendages, Harry was now irresistibly adorable.
Harry was thankful to Pansy for carrying on the game. He was barely aware of his surroundings as he asked Lavender, "Truth or dare?"
Weasley who was kneeling on the floor trying to wake Potter up snapped, "This is all your fault, Malfoy!"
"You look like a full course meal, you know that?" Draco whispered, biting Harry's ear and dragging the earlobe into his mouth.
Ginny, however, was struck for a whole new reason.....damn Malfoy's hot! She thought. Him with his perfectly chiseled abs and broad shoulders, defined legs, and.....Merlin, the list goes on. Harry, of course, was perfection. She had seen him naked before and had kissed down his chest, licked his abs....but seeing two ridiculously attractive boys making out with each other was something new altogether. Ginny would be lying if she said she wasn't enjoying it....at least a little bit.
Meanwhile Ginny and Ron had crept their way into the eighth year Gryffindor boys dorm room to get Harry's invisibility cloak. Ginny knew well enough that she wasn't allowed there, and was praying that everyone would be at dinner. Everyone except for Harry that is.
Ron scoffed, "Mate I'm really not looking forward to this. Bloody hell! I heard Parkinson has decided to play an extreme version of truth or dare."
"Right then," Blaise spoke up, "now that we've all admitted to ogling Potter's delicious backside and wishing to have our cocks up his bum," Harry squeaked at this, "how about we actually see it happen?"
"But he's unconscious!" Draco argued. "Well, that is your problem, not mine." Came Snape's snarky response with an added, "Or else you'd prefer me calling your mother to let her know your potions grade this weekend."
Everyone's jaws dropped as they stared with their eyes blown at Hannah. "Oh come on! Have you people never played this before? You do know that you might have to have penetrative sex in front of the group right? You don't call it extreme for nothing."
Draco pushed Harry's fringe away from his forehead, the brilliant emerald green of Harry's eyes shining back at him. Quite abruptly, Draco couldn't take it anymore, not with Harry straddling him and his face merely inches away. Draco placed his hand on the small of Harry's back and pulled him forward, at the same time as Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and their mouths crashed together. Draco ran his tongue across Harry's bottom lip, seeking entrance, as Harry pliantly opened his mouth, as Draco's tongue plunged into his mouth exploring every bit of Harry's hot cavern. Their tongues glided together smoothly once Harry submitted into the kiss, and soon enough they were both moaning. Kissing Ginny had never ever felt this good, this was a whole new feeling. Harry couldn't believe what he was missing out on. Draco's hands traveled further down Harry's back until they were cupping Harry's arse. Draco then squeezed said arse causing Harry to moan and squeal.
"What?" Dean snorted, "everyone here knows it's true. All the guys, and I mean all of us," he clarified, darting a look at Seamus, "has checked Harry out from behind and wished he was a girl just so we could fuck him."
Not knowing what else to do, with Harry Potter fast asleep in his arms, Draco opted to staring at them blinking rapidly, not knowing what else to do.
Ron huffed and turned his attention back to his mashed potatoes. Speaking of Harry.....where was the sneaky little bastard? Harry has been doing this far more often lately. Skipping dinner in favour of what Ron assumed to be sneaking off to snog his new girlfriend. Ron just couldn't comprehend as to why Harry would keep this a secret. Well yes, of course, the news of the golden boy's new lover would be plastered across the very next issue of the Daily Prophet, but did Harry not trust Ron? When has Ron ever reported anything to the papers? He knows how much Harry loathes publicity and the undying praise he receives on a daily basis for saving the Wizarding World.
Ron sighed, his curiosity getting the best of him. "Fine," he said as Ginny's solemn expression blossomed into a grin. "Let's go get that darn invisibility cloak."
After numerous failed attempts to try to get Harry to reveal his new girlfriend, Ginny and Ron turn to their last resort: Harry's invisibility cloak.
Ginny knew better though. Clearly whoever she was, she was making him undoubtedly happy, in a way she hadn't in a very long time. Although to be honest, realization dawned on her that Harry had never really felt that way about her.
Ron still seemed sceptical. He opened his mouth and closed it again, not knowing what to say. "Please Ron," Ginny begged, "I haven't been able to move on since, and I know this sounds crazy and I'm actually happy for Harry it's just......"
Ginny shut her eyes tight, taking a deep breath now that it had been confirmed. Ron's jaw had dropped to the floor, he looked as though he's gotten petrified by the basilisk.
Harry reached around him and looked over his shoulder, sure enough, his hand was met with a soft ball of white fur.
Draco physically couldn't move a muscle in his jaw that would allow him to speak. The only thing he could do was hold Harry tighter, as if he were afraid of letting go.
"Harry," Draco all but growled, "if you don't stop that now, I'm gonna come so deep inside you it'll never come out."
Ron couldn't have whined louder. Harry himself glared daggers at Hermione, who leisurely shrugged and took a seat next to Ron. She and Pansy administered the veritaserum, placing three drops on everyone's tongue to make sure no one would be cheating.
"Come on Harry it's almost dinner time. Let's go you must be starving, you missed lunch." Hermione informed him.
"Ahhhh Draco stop! I'm too tired to get hard again," Harry whined. Draco laughed, "All right love, I'm sorry," he said not sounding apologetic at all. "On a more serious note," Draco continued taking a deep breath, "I do wish I hadn't been so awful to you and your friends in the past, Granger's not too bad and neither is Weasley. I know I've apologized to you before, and I won't have a problem apologizing to them either if they'll accept it that is."
, saw him so clearly that it took his breath away. Pansy jerked him out of his reverie by demanding to know what was in the bloody box already, and he blinked up at her, for once completely at a loss for words. Soundlessly he lifted the picture out of the box and turned it about so everyone could see.
The note of command in that last declaration was unmistakable, causing goosebumps to break out along Draco’s arms in a pleasant ripple. And as he came around the corner he saw that a mannequin had been outfitted in the suit he’d commissioned for Harry, from the silken black dress shirt down to the waistcoat, trousers, even the elegant green bow tie and pocket square were present, and at the sight even Toussaint’s delightful voice was forgotten.
She gave him a rather bemused smile before answering that it had been quite lovely, thank you and contented herself with her butternut squash while Harry gave Ron an exasperated look and muttered lowly that he’d tell Hermione the next time his friend so thoughtlessly inserted himself into a conversation, never mind the fact that Harry had barely been following it not two seconds prior. Nobody needed to know that part, he reasoned with himself. Ron gave him a wounded look.
He sighed and sat up, throwing the blankets off as he spelled his bed curtains open with a wordless charm and slid to his feet as quietly as possible. His gaze flicked to Draco’s four-poster, automatically checking to make sure he hadn’t roused his roommate. Once assured that he hadn’t, Harry drew on a pair of joggers, and a random t-shirt grabbed out of his bag before picking up his trainers and easing out of the room, careful to ease the door shut behind him. Mindful of waking the rest of the house as well, Harry made his way down the stairs and out into the night.
He mumbled the last bit and stuffed a bite of eggs into his mouth before Hermione could question him further. She eyed him pensively before turning to nudge Ron on her other side and started another low voiced conversation with her boyfriend. Harry groaned internally, aware it was him they were discussing but knowing it was pointless to try to put them off. Instead, he focused on finishing his breakfast and making half-hearted attempts to keep up with the flow of conversation around him.
He felt Harry turning them both slightly as the other boy shielded him with his body and glared at the rest of the small crowd surrounding the door. Harry’s chest rumbled against Draco’s with the force of each word spitting out of him, tone bristling with anger and a thread of something else. Protectiveness, maybe? The cupboard door banged shut again, propelled by a burst of magic that could only have come from Harry. Draco could feel it, the way it swirled and pulsed around him, humming with tension from the Gryffindor’s emotional outburst.
You’re so bloody sentimental the Hat should’ve Sorted you Hufflepuff. Are you sure it wasn’t confused? Can one Confund a magical artifact? Hmm..”
His grip on Harry’s cock tightened briefly and then went slack as he fumbled over his request, and the other man released his earlobe with a wet pop before shifting so he could look Draco in the eye, his own fist slowing on Draco’s length but not stopping entirely as he replied.
“Nonsense, darling. Everyone else can enjoy seeing you in something nice for a change at least as long as it takes to open the rest of the gifts. Besides, you wouldn’t want to hold up the proceedings now would you? Of course not.”
Taking a few steadying breaths, Draco nodded and relaxed into the mattress, obeying Harry’s silent request to lift up onto his knees and spread them wide so that his backside was conveniently placed for whatever Harry had in mind. It didn’t take long for him to find out what that was when he felt Harry’s breath ghosting along his lower back and his hands moving to cup and knead his arse cheeks before spreading them open. A pause, and he felt the tickle of a wordless, wandless cleaning spell inside him. The casual display of power left him a bit breathless, and that was all the invitation Harry needed to lean down and bury his face between Draco’s cheeks, tongue licking a wide swathe along his crack.
When they were both breathless, Harry finally pulled back, his eyes opening to search Draco’s as if he might find an answer to the question he was about to give voice.
to him. Oh, and if you ever tell him I told you, I’ll hex your knob off and stick it to your forehead instead.”
For his part, Harry groaned in anticipation and rooted around for where he’d discarded the jar of lube on the bed, squirting some into his hand and coating himself with it before positioning himself at Draco’s hole. Locking eyes with him in silent question, Draco growled at him to get on with it, and Harry smiled again at the other man’s impatience before slowly pressing forward, the head of his cock breaching Draco and sliding home in a slow, steady glide. He paused when he’d bottomed out, his pelvis flush against Draco’s backside, giving him time to adjust to the intrusion. Draco took measured breaths and forced himself to relax, eyes rolling shut as his head fell back at the flex and burn of it. He liked it, though, and it wasn’t long before he was wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist and demanding that he move.
Harry flung open the door to their shared office with his usual lack of care, a complaint on his lips that was completely lost to the sight that greeted him as he barged into the room. Mouth falling open in shock, he froze for a split second before whirling around and slamming the door, hitting it with a number of locking and privacy spells almost without even thinking. As soon as he could be sure no one else was going to walk in on them, he turned back around to be met with a view he’d half thought he was only imagining before.
“I want to, Draco, I do. Merlin, I want you so much. You have no idea, but there’s something I have to tell you first. Please. Can we go back inside? Back to our room. We’ll talk, and then if you still want—”
to work for a living, but he was damn good at potions and had worked his ass off to secure both his mastery and what contracts he had now. He wasn’t giving that up. It gave him a sense of purpose, helped him cope when strangers even still looked at him with contempt. At least he had his mind, and his work, and his friends. That was enough. It had to be.
Harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair, leaving it even wilder than before. “This is going to be a long hour. Sit down and drink your damn tea. And
“Of course, ‘Mione. I made sure he took it, I swear! We just got cut short because Robards needed to see him about something or other.”
Harsh panting, Harry’s tongue laving at his pulse point, his hands roaming over every part of Draco he could reach, but one thing slowly registered in his mind, allowing him to focus just enough to articulate a thought.
“You want my opinion on something that required you to show up at my house at midnight the day before Christmas Eve? Malfoy, what’s going on? Are you in trouble? Do you need help?”
. Draco tried to tell himself that he was at work, that this was entirely inappropriate, that there was absolutely no way he could possibly contemplate doing what his body was practically demanding of him at that moment, but he was fighting a swiftly losing battle with his self control. Before he’d even fully registered what had happened, Draco had his trousers undone and was shoving them and his pants halfway down his legs, a ragged moan escaping him as his cock sprang free, already leaking at the slit.
“Heed me, young Malfoy. Your,” and Toussaint held up a hand to forestall any protest, and Draco closed his mouth with a snap as the man continued, “Monsieur Potter is quite something. Worth this declaration, non?”
“I wasn’t uncomfortable, merely surprised, and you haven’t ‘made it weird’. Calm down before you rupture something. Thank you for the first apology. The second wasn’t necessary. And we don’t have to forget it, what you said. Harry, I…”
Grey eyes locked with startled and entranced green ones as Draco panted out in desperate gasps, “I kn-know that, you pillock, but it won’t.. I can’t—” he cut off mid-sentence as a small shudder ran through him, his eyes rolling back in his head as he slowed the motion of his hand, drawing it out as if to demonstrate his difficulty. A small whimper escaped him, and his eyes opened again as Harry stood there, transfixed by the motion of Draco’s hand on his cock. His voice was a plaintive whisper when he managed to speak again, “Harry, I need you to.. Oh Merlin,
it’s you, I’ve only been in love with you since fourth year. Nevermind the fact that mine’s one bloody word. You’ve never been terribly verbose, have you?”
Harry’s eyes widened as he realized what had just happened, and he choked out in shock, “Draco, did you just dose yourself with
“Is it not enough that I opened my home to you lot, provided a fabulous luncheon, and graced everyone with my company? No, I’m to play Santa’s little helper as well because apparently no one else is capable of reading labels on packages!”
Draco angled his head just enough to glare up at him with one eye, but Harry knew his heart wasn’t really in it despite the huff that escaped him. He continued on unabashed.
Draco’s fingers loosened in his hair but didn’t withdraw. As he calmed, Draco stroked through the wild curls slowly, and when they’d both caught their breath, Harry looked up at him with a warm smile. He felt Draco tugging him upward and carefully stood but was arrested part of the way by Draco’s mouth seeking and claiming his own while the fingers left his hair and instead crept down to join Draco’s other hand in undoing his flies. Harry groaned into the kiss when he realized what Draco was up to, nodding his approval as his jeans and pants were shoved aside just enough to free his cock from their confines.
Harry stopped behind his chair and blinked down at him, his brow creasing in a frown. He glanced at Pansy on Draco’s right and then at Blaise on his left. After a solid minute of just standing there and frowning, heads started to turn in his direction. Blaise glanced over his shoulder and then arched an eyebrow before looking to Draco, then pointedly back to Harry.
The next morning they woke up curled around each other, warm and content. Draco insisted on a joint shower, and this time Harry happily took him up on the offer, which cost them an extra half an hour. Thank Merlin for magic and hot water that never ran out. Clean, dressed, and sated, they descended to the main level of the house at last and joined everyone in the dining room where breakfast was already well underway. Draco slid into the chair next to Pansy and reached across her to grab the granola and start making himself a bowl with that and some assorted fruits also within easy reach.
“We’ve been friends for years. Of course I know how you like your tea. Wanna tell me why you’re here yet?”
He had flushed and stammered out an apology before grabbing his own towel and barricading himself in the bathroom, the sound of Draco’s laughter chasing after him. The other man hadn’t been quite as amused when Harry had emerged nearly an hour later (he’d dithered hoping Draco would be asleep, no such luck) only to bid Draco a hasty goodnight before diving into his bed and spelling the curtains shut. He’d then spent a mostly sleepless night tossing and turning while plagued by the memory of Draco’s nearly naked body, not to mention the soulmark bearing his first word to Draco on the other man’s chest. It was so vague that Harry was positive Draco didn’t know who his soulmate was. In fact, he’d heard Draco lament that very fact several times during their last school year.
His friends’ lively chatter greeted him as he entered the dining room and slouched into an empty chair next to Hermione. She turned toward him to offer a cheerful good morning, but her smile faltered when she caught sight of the dark circles under his eyes and what he was guessing was a decided lack of success at hiding his general ill humor. She murmured low enough that only he should hear her over the rest of the hubbub.
“I didn’t realize.. couldn’t have imagined you wanting me back. Gods, Harry, if you don’t touch me soon I think I might go mad!”
It crumpled to the floor in a forgotten heap as Harry kissed him and turned him about, steering him toward the bed ‘til the backs of his knees hit the mattress. Harry drew back then and looked at him carefully, hands settling on Draco’s belt buckle and pausing for permission. At Draco’s nod, he slid it out of its loops and then made short work of the fastenings on his trousers before shoving them and his pants halfway down his thighs in one go. Draco groaned and pushed at them, wiggling his way out the rest of the way and kicking them aside impatiently before sinking down onto the bed and sliding along until he could recline on the mound of pillows at the headboard. Pointing at Harry’s joggers, he ordered imperiously.
. It was a picture..no, a drawing, and a rather good one at that. The gift giver had even had it matted and framed, but Draco barely registered this as he was so caught up watching himself throw back his head and laugh.
Harry’s eyes darkened and his grin was just a touch devious as he pulled away from Draco’s questing mouth, hand tight in Draco’s hair to prevent the blond from chasing after him as he slowly sank to his knees in front of the other man. He released Draco’s hair but gave him a look that said he would brook no nonsense as he instead removed the blond’s shoes and socks and then peeled his trousers and pants the rest of the way down his legs. Harry wanted no barriers between him and his prize.
This was met with a dark chuckle as Toussaint circled him, giving both him and the suit an appraising glance before drifting over to the mannequin and launching into an explanation of how he’d brought the sketches they’d poured over to life. Draco listened with rapt attention, nodding and humming appreciative responses in all the right places. The man was a genius. The least Draco could do was pay court for a few minutes. Then with a calculating glint in his jet gaze, the tailor switched topics, catching Draco completely off guard yet again.
Chest heaving with his sharp intake of breath, Draco didn’t have to be told twice. Harry moaned his approval as the other man grasped him by the hair and guided him back onto his cock. He swallowed him down and let Draco take the lead as he relaxed his throat and closed his eyes, relishing the tugs to his hair and the flex of Draco’s hips as he started to thrust. Harry’s own cock was aching, hard and straining against the zip of his jeans, but he kept his hands on Draco’s legs, idly caressing him as the other man took his pleasure. Harry also liked to wait for it.
But Ginny had surprised him by gently explaining that she’d moved on in the year they’d been apart, that so much had happened, and really, they were neither of them the people they’d been before the war. He’d assured her that he understood, that they’d always be friends, and that maybe it was for the best. He
“I’ll use your mouth later, hm? I know how much you like it when I do that. Just—” as he was saying it, Harry reached up to slide his fingers through Draco’s hair, gripping it tightly at the roots and tugging once sharply to emphasize his point, “—grab you like so and guide you right where I want you.”
And so saying, he dragged Draco up his body and kissed him deeply. While the blond writhed against him, desperate little moans being muffled by Harry’s tongue stroking against his hotly, Harry cupped his arse in both hands and rocked them against each other. Then, he slipped a finger in between Draco’s cheeks to tease the tight furl of his hole with gentle strokes. The other man let out a choked groan when Harry muttered a wandless cleaning charm that set Draco’s insides tingling, then another to conjure lube that he used to coat his fingers before easing the tip of one inside him as he began to slowly work Draco open. By the time Harry was three fingers deep, Draco was shoving back onto them and cursing at Harry to get on with it already.
“Well it was beyond obvious you got me! Who else would dress me up like that? You’re such a posh wanker, do you know that? And
It wasn’t unpleasant, though, far from it. Harry swallowed, at a loss for words as the reality of their position sank in. Cheeks flaming, he prayed that it was too dark for the other man to tell, and he released Draco’s wrists and was about to move off when Draco lurched up, grabbing Harry around the middle and heaving him over till he’d rolled Harry beneath him instead. Unbearably smug now, Draco grinned down at him and tapped Harry’s chest with one slender forefinger.
Several hours and quite a number of sketches later Draco and Toussaint had settled on a design. After finalizing everything and settling his tab at the counter, Toussaint told him he could have it ready in a fortnight, which suited Draco perfectly. Donning his cloak, he nodded a polite farewell to the shop owner and braced himself for the trial of once again heading out to navigate through the holiday crowds. All he knew was the look on Potter’s face when he saw his gift better be worth all this trouble. He couldn’t stop himself from smiling a little as he pictured Harry with his mouth flopping open and shut like a fish. Yes, something like that would do quite nicely.
The blond shot him a teasing grin and elbowed him in the side lightly, and Harry growled and gave Draco a playful little shove. This led to a small tussle, and before they knew what was happening, the two of them were rolling about in the sand vying for dominance. Eventually, Harry’s slightly higher mass won him the advantage, and he found himself straddling Draco’s hips, grasping the blond’s wrists and holding them stretched out above his head. They were both laughing, chests heaving slightly from exertion, and Harry looked down into Draco’s face, their gazes locking as their laughter slowly ebbed away to be replaced by a silence that felt charged with a new kind of tension.
His shoulders sagged a bit in relief as he made it to the shop he’d been heading for. It was one he frequented quite regularly, and he was relieved they were still willing to accept his custom. La Maison Sorcier was run by a forbidding older wizard who could’ve been anywhere from 40 to over 100 for all Draco could tell. The man hadn’t changed one whit in all the years the men of Draco’s family had been coming here for their suits, and at this point Draco seriously doubted he ever would. The man himself swept up from the back just as Draco was coming in and brushing a few errant flakes of snow from the shoulders of his cloak.
He could get used to this, Harry in his arms, the delicious groans that tugging on his hair elicited, all of it. Draco broke the kiss with a sigh and hid his face in Harry’s neck, pressing even closer to the other boy, a smile curving his lips as he brushed them slowly along the warm line of Harry’s throat. If this was where party games got them, then maybe they weren’t so stupid after all. Harry feathered a light kiss against Draco’s temple, his pulse thrumming against Draco’s lips.
Okay, so Harry couldn’t entirely suppress his natural tendency for sass. He wasn’t a saint, no matter what some of those ridiculous articles in
“I wasn’t tired, so I thought I’d get out and clear my head a bit. I like looking at the stars. Sorry if I worried you.”
This last question was followed up by a rather pointed glare, and at his wife’s obvious displeasure, Ron stopped grinning and opted for doing damage control instead.
“Sorry about that. You okay? Seemed like what she said really bothered you, and I might’ve..overreacted a bit.”
Blaise cut Harry off before he could even finish that thought, waving it away dismissively as he grinned between him and Draco.
“Mr. Malfoy, of course. Monsieur Toussaint is expecting you. He merely stepped into the back. He’ll be with you in a moment.”
“Find your pride, Monsieur Malfoy, and perhaps a bit of that renowned Slytherin cunning, and I am quite sure you will manage.”
Ron stood up hastily and came around the desk, reaching out in a soothing gesture as he inched cautiously toward his incensed wife, cutting off her tirade in an attempt to distract her from storming down to his boss’s office. She was rather terrifying when she was angry and incredibly effective at getting her way. He didn’t like Robards’ chances if she decided to take him down a peg or two, and Ron rather liked his job and would prefer to keep it.
Hearing the familiar drawl through the open doorway, Harry sighed and dutifully set his toothbrush and other things near the sink closest to the door, knowing that any kind of protest would be a waste of breath. He didn’t really care which sink he used, anyway. After stowing his body wash and shampoo in the shower stall, he ducked back out of the bathroom and crossed the room to unpack his clothes, firing off a response as he passed Draco on the way.
want to tell Harry why he was here. The wanker had the nerve to laugh at him, so why should he? Nevermind the fact that Harry wasn’t actually laughing, and that his brief hint of amusement was quickly giving way to a helpless sort of confusion that Draco found incredibly endearing. And damn it if he wasn’t right back to sneaking glances at him between sips of his tea while pretending to be offended. This was not going how Draco had pictured at all.
Draco’s head came up at that, and he glared at Harry fiercely over his shoulder. But he still choked out an answer when Harry merely smiled and raised his eyebrows at him.
“Your young man will be perfection in it, mm? You would be wise to stop your dancing about and snatch him up before another does, I think.”
“You’re not my bloody keeper, and I’ll go where I like, thanks. I’m tired, I’m hungry, and I don’t want to argue with you right now. So leave off.”
Draco sighed and flopped down beside him dramatically. Harry’s eyebrows went up as he continued to watch him, expression bemused, yet fond. The other man copied his pose, leaning back on his hands and tilting his head up to look at the sky.
, Harry knew the time for teasing was over, and he pulled out ‘til only the head of him was left inside and then snapped his hips forward, driving himself into Draco in a new punishing pace. He reached between their straining bodies and wrapped his still lube-slick hand around Draco’s cock, wanking him in time to his own thrusts.
Nearly twenty minutes later, he was practically thrumming with impatience when the lock on the bathroom door clicked, and Draco strode out in a pair of trousers, a towel around his bare shoulders that he was using to scrub at his damp hair. Harry was beginning to suspect that the universe was having a laugh at his expense with the sheer number of times he’d been subjected to seeing the object of his affection half-naked in the past few days. Swallowing, he jerked his gaze from where it’d been traveling steadily south of Draco’s collarbones and winced when met with the other man’s scowl. He bounced to his feet in a rush, speaking fast in the hopes that Draco would hear him out before he hexed him into oblivion.
Next he turned back to the mess on Harry’s desk, and drawing his wand, he sent the various letters, memos, and files strewn across its surface zooming into neat little piles that sorted themselves according to both level of urgency and whether they were personal or work-related. Satisfied at last, he nodded to himself and was about to turn back to his own desk and start on the paperwork from the case they’d closed only the week before when his attention snagged on a small box that was settling itself alongside Harry’s personal mail.
Pansy cackled from her spot next to Harry and piped up just as Draco made it to the tree and leaned down to grab the first present, muttering under his breath all the while,
Harry snorted as Draco picked up his cup and inhaled appreciatively before taking a sip. He hadn’t neglected the two spoons of sugar Draco took in his tea, though how the man’s teeth hadn’t rotted out of his head ages ago was beyond Harry. Draco liked sweets. A lot. After taking a gulp of his own tea, he eyed his uninvited visitor and ground out, “What do you want, Draco?”
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed off of Harry as he got to his feet and kicked off his shoes before slowly tugging his shirt over his head and tossing it down carelessly.
But Draco was cut off by Harry’s head shake as the other man settled him down again and pressed gentle kisses along his temple before resting his cheek against Draco’s hair and playing with his fingers idly as he answered him.
Having swept across the threshold in his usual dramatic fashion, Draco sniffed and turned to face Harry after he’d shut the door and redone the locks. “To talk to you, of course. Tea would be lovely, thank you.” And so saying, Draco made his way to the kitchen, having been to Harry’s plenty of times. It had taken most of their eighth year at Hogwarts for them to work out their differences, but they’d managed it after an apology from Draco for having been a prat and on the wrong side of the war.
Harry slowly lowered himself back down into a seated position, staring at Draco as he continued to lament his lapse in judgment. He sat there, dumbstruck for several more minutes until Draco’s unceasing (but truthful) rambling broke through his stupor, and he practically lunged across the table and slapped his hand over Draco’s mouth. “That’s enough. I get the idea.”
With that he took a bite out of the biscuit and chewed slowly before swallowing with a moan of appreciation. They were very good biscuits. Trust Potter not to skimp on the sweets. There was a clatter as Harry nearly toppled the teacup he was spooning sugar into, and he glanced hastily over at Draco with slightly wide eyes before returning to what he’d been doing. Draco grinned wolfishly, a bit of confidence flooding back through him at the unexpected reaction from the other man. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all.
Harry swallowed, throat clicking as his breath hitched, pupils dilating at the implication behind Draco’s answer. “I can be good. Dinner first, maybe?”
“Because they’re predictable. Draco won’t be able to resist showing off by getting something he knows Harry will love, and Harry’s always so thoughtful about gifts he’s bound to let something slip. He cares too much for it to go any other way, and when we do the big reveal they’ll be forced to acknowledge that they both like each other at least enough to get each other something so personal.”
Draco huffed and slumped back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest and settling into what promised to be a spectacular sulk. After a few minutes of terse silence, he picked up his tea and drank it (but certainly not because Harry had said to). Harry sipped his own tea half-heartedly and kept stealing little sideways glances at Draco, hurriedly looking away again whenever he thought himself in danger of being caught at it.
Taking advantage of Harry’s momentary confusion, Draco leaned in and kissed him again, mouth moving hungrily against the other boy’s. It didn’t take long for Harry to take the hint and pick up where they’d left off before they’d been interrupted by their friends’ unwelcome intrusion. Shuddering when Harry gripped his hips and started to rock against him slowly, Draco gasped into his mouth and tightened his hold on the dark, messy curls that had driven him to distraction so often in the past.
And when Draco obliged him he shuddered, hips bucking in tandem with Draco’s own thrusts. Draco let out a little whine when Harry paused in his litany to kiss him hard, tongue mimicking the motion of their lower bodies. It was deep and wet and everything Draco’d ever imagined kissing Harry would be like, only a hundred times better than any fantasy because it was
“Ouch! You arsehole, that hurt! What do you want, then? A parade? A medal? Shall I call the Prophet and put an announcement in?”
“Potter, if you don’t put your cock in my arse now I’ll hex your bollocks off. Specific enough for you?”
The tailor gave him a look that rivaled Snape’s best ‘you’re a dunderhead’ expression and tilted his head slightly, obviously of the opinion that the question didn’t even deserve a response.
With a long suffering sigh, he set both the files he was carrying and his cup of tea on his own desk before shrugging out of his robes and hanging them neatly on the rack near the door. Muttering to himself about bespectacled idiots and the disasters that inevitably followed in their wake, he crossed over to Harry’s side of the room and picked up his partner’s cloak, shaking the wrinkles out of it before hanging it up properly where it belonged.
Draco Malfoy was everything that his husband, Harry Potter, was not. Cool and collected where Harry was fiery and impulsive, neat as a pin while Harry was messy chaos personified, and most importantly, always dressed to the nines while the love of his life was more often than not sporting ripped jeans and t-shirts with a minimum of three holes in them at all times. The one thing they both shared was their love of tattoos. Harry’s were constantly on display. It came with his profession, after all. One usually didn’t stay ink-free for long when designing and applying wizarding tattoos to others for a living.
Harry had blown up at all their friends and slammed the door in their faces, also conveniently rendering them alone in the broom cupboard together. Again. There was some snickering outside of the door and what sounded like an indignant tirade from the Weasel, but a gradual shuffling seemed to indicate an exodus away from their cupboard before Harry slapped a silencing spell up, effectively cutting off any further noise and also guaranteeing they wouldn’t be overheard.
Harry tightened his grip on the back of Draco’s neck before letting go with a curse and taking over from the other man stroking him. With an eager little hiccupping whine, Draco leaned forward just as he began to come, the first few streaks splashing across his chest and shoulder before Draco could position himself to catch the last two spurts against his chin and cheeks, eyes tightly shut to prevent any mishaps. Harry rubbed the head of his cock against Draco’s lips, and the other man opened for him, lapping wetly at the tip for a moment before Harry had to pull back as it became too sensitive.
Draco sobbed and nodded, arms looping around Harry’s neck as he buried his face in the crook of his shoulder and began to shake apart while astride him. Harry continued to whisper soft praise, stroking Draco through his climax and pressing gentle kisses to his face and hair as his movements started to slow. He followed the other man’s lead, letting his own motions ease to a gentle rocking until Draco began to come back to himself. The blond blinked at him drowsily and then seemed to start a little before his gaze focused sharply on Harry’s face as he straightened.
private session only a few weeks before their wedding day. No one besides Harry would ever have the privilege of seeing that one, and Draco had had to beg for nearly a year before Harry had relented and permanently etched the words in his own untidy scrawl onto Draco’s skin,
Pressing his forehead into his arm, Draco keened and shuddered under Harry’s ministrations. He was slowly coming unraveled, and Harry was enjoying every minute of Draco’s mounting desperation. His hips moved mindlessly, eager for any sort of friction on his aching cock and finding none. It was that that finally broke him, and his breath coming in sobs he spoke, voice muffled with his head buried in his arms as it was.
Draco silenced him with another kiss, this one slow but just as heated as before, and he cupped Harry’s arse and squeezed it roughly. Harry melted against him with a low moan, but before it could go much further, Draco broke the kiss and released him, stepping back, his expression showing how much the effort must have cost him.
“Draco..are you sure this isn’t too fast? I want it. Don’t misunderstand me. I’ve wanted you for ages, but that..this isn’t…”
above Draco’s heart as the blond nodded furiously, throat too tight to respond any other way at first. It didn’t take Draco long to find his voice, however, and he twitched and gave a little gasp as Harry’s head shifted to the side and he took Draco’s nipple into his mouth and sucked, teeth nibbling lightly at first and then slightly harder when Draco clasped his head in his hands and held him there.
know. Only the two of you could possibly put up with each other. Circe’s tits, I deserve a medal for this!”
stared at him as he did it. His breathing hitched a bit as he looked into eyes that just happened to be his favorite shade of green and murmured a response, his voice coming out a bit huskier than he’d intended.
After a while Draco made a face and complained about the mess, and Harry laughed as he cast a cleaning charm and then settled them both under the covers, nosing at Draco’s hairline before placing a tender kiss to his temple.
Draco undid the fastenings of his trousers and hooked his thumbs underneath them and his pants both, arching an eyebrow at Harry as he began to slide them slowly down his hips. Face flaming, Harry jerked around, giving Draco his back as he tugged down his joggers and pants, stepping out of them one leg at a time, stumbling a little as he did so. He heard Draco snickering at him as the other man finished shedding the last of his clothing.
Leaning in, he claimed Draco’s mouth again, and the kiss was open and messy and perfect. Harry couldn’t hold back anymore at that point, and he tightened his grip on Draco, knowing he might bruise tomorrow and liking the thought of leaving marks on him. Groaning into the kiss, Harry felt himself spilling inside the other man, and Draco wasn’t far behind him, clinging to Harry tightly as his body jerked, his cock spurting wetly between them as he came for the second time that night.
trying to come up with the perfect gift for Harry. Admittedly he’d wanted to dress the man for years. Harry’s clothing had improved marginally since their school days, but it had been downright
Eventually, he couldn’t help but notice that Draco was looking at him. Harry quickly attempted to avert his gaze, but it was too late. Draco was already fixing him in place with the heat of his stare, and there was a glimmer of determination in his eyes that made Harry doubt his chances for coming out of this encounter unscathed. He was proved correct all too quickly when the gorgeous prat opened his stupid mouth to comment on Harry’s apparent exhaustion.
He watched Draco’s eyes darken as the blond started to move faster, taking Harry deeper inside of himself as he tangled his fingers in his hair and drew him closer. His voice was a low purr against Harry’s lips before he began kissing him senseless.
A throat clearing nearby jerked his attention back to his task, and he flushed guiltily before hastily scooping up several handfuls of sand and mounding them together to start shaping the wall he was meant to be building. He avoided Millie’s knowing look and Luna’s softly amused smile both by studiously focusing on attaching his tower to what was shaping up to be a rather sprawling structure that perhaps appeared castle-ish if one were feeling generous. Harry sighed and finished the wall before being sent off with his bucket to collect seashells and other beach detritus to decorate the ‘castle’.
He deeply regretted not listening to that voice mere seconds later when the door to the cupboard was unceremoniously yanked open, and a small circle of their friends peered in at them. Draco had broken away from the kiss with a startled gasp, his lurch backward only halted by Harry’s grip on the back of his robes. Theo whooped and darted away before Draco could so much as twitch forward, presumably off to share this delectable little piece of gossip before anyone could stop him. Draco growled low in his throat, eyes narrowing as he started plotting his revenge, mind racing silently with plans.
He stared morosely at nothing for a minute before dragging himself to his feet and taking his plate and cutlery to the sink, where he washed and dried them by hand just to give himself something else to focus on, however briefly. When they were cleaned and put away, Harry decided he’d go and settle himself in the den. There was no way he was going up to their room after the fight they’d just had, not when Draco might still be up, anyway.
She smiled at him over her shoulder when he grimaced but muttered an apology just as she tossed the powder into the flames and stated her destination as her office at the Ministry and vanished in a whoosh of green flames.
“God, do you have any idea how long I’ve wanted this? You drive me mad, Draco. Fuck! The sounds you make.. I could do this all night long.”
She nudged Harry in the ribs with her elbow, and he winced and shot her a dirty look as he rubbed the spot. Ignoring this in favor of continuing, she went on in her usual unapologetic fashion,
Releasing her arm, he nodded at her soft ‘good night’ in return and let his head fall back onto the couch cushions as he stared up at the ceiling, lost in thought. It was another half hour or so before he managed to rouse himself enough to stumble up the stairs and creep into his room, eyes darting to the closed curtains of Draco’s bed. Well, there wouldn’t be another confrontation that night, at least. It was with a grateful sigh that Harry fell into his own bed, crawled under the covers, and promptly drifted off, leaving the problem of settling things between them for another day.
He bit his lip, voice wavering just slightly at the end, feeling a bit vulnerable with the admission. Harry’s expression softened at the tone, and he reached out with his clean hand, cupping Draco’s chin and tilting his face up so he could press a gentle kiss to the corner of his mouth.
Ron had apparently escaped this lecture and chose that moment to plop himself down on Harry’s other side and start loading his plate with an assortment of small mince pies. Grinning hugely at such a windfall, he startled Harry right out of his musing and interrupted Luna mid-story to exclaim,
the bastard couldn’t resist sticking his nose in where it wasn’t wanted. He’d handed out room assignments and a bloody itinerary when everyone had arrived at the house (more like a mansion if you asked him) and slithered off before Harry could make a grab for him after seeing that he’d put him with
Draco stepped into his office and shut the door against the mid-morning hustle and bustle that was the bullpen of the DMLE at the Ministry of Magic. A quick glance across the room confirmed that his Auror partner was still attending his yearly review with Robards and that Draco would have the space to himself for at least a little while yet. It also confirmed that Harry was still an irredeemable slob if the cloak haphazardly slung across his chair and the spill of half-opened mail scattered across the top of his desk were enough to go by, and they certainly were, in Draco’s opinion anyway.
back then. That was not why he’d settled on a suit, however. No, he’d remembered how much Harry would always complain about formal wear whenever he had to go to a Ministry function or broke down and attended one of the countless charity galas that were always clamoring for the attendance of the Savior of the wizarding world, so naturally he decided that he’d simply introduce Harry to formal wear that was both functional and comfortable. The fact that he’d conveniently get to do so under the guise of their Secret Santa exchange was a boon he’d accepted now, but he was still going to complain the entire way through, of course.
If there’d been any doubt that Draco was blushing before he was definitely doing so now. Even the tips of his ears glowed pink, and his voice was slightly strangled as he stumbled over a reply.
Harry froze as Draco’s words registered, and his eyes, which had been locked with the other man’s, flickered briefly to his lips before jerking back up again in time to catch Draco’s smirk and the arch of one slender eyebrow. He couldn’t even manage a token bluster in response before Draco was back across the room and grabbing his swim trunks and vanishing into the bathroom with a parting, “See you on the beach, scarhead.”
, part of him screamed, but he shoved the voice to the back of his mind desperately before anymore of it could show in his face or in his actions. There was no signature, however, and Hermione tutted in disappointment before ferrying the picture across the room for everyone clamoring for a closer look to take turns examining it themselves.
Harry chuckled lowly and peered up at him, leaning back on his hands and tilting his head up to properly meet Draco’s gaze. The moon was out and very nearly full, casting enough light to make out the contours of the other man’s face. He gave a little shrug of his shoulders along with his reply.
By the time he’d heard Draco leaving their room, Harry had been awake for quite some time. Sighing as the door clicked shut, he sat up and peeked out of his curtains to make sure Draco was really gone before shoving them open and dragging himself to his feet. Making his way to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face, he peered into the mirror, which told him his hair looked a fright. With an irritated growl, he flicked a silencing spell at it and took care of his morning ablutions before pulling on some clothes and reluctantly heading downstairs for breakfast.
, had captured him in a moment of joy, and then gifted it to him knowing that eventually he’d be revealed. It was so..so Gryffindor of him. Draco swallowed and stood, gaze stuck on the picture for a moment before he gently placed it back in the box and darted to his room for a coat. He didn’t care what bloody time it was. If Harry wasn’t awake he was about to be.
Reassured, Draco stepped further into the shop and spent a few moments browsing idly. The sound of a door clicking shut caused him to look up. Eyes alighting on the impeccably dressed figure of Sebastien Toussaint himself, Draco allowed himself a small smile as he straightened from his perusal of a rack of trousers and moved toward the back as the tailor caught sight of him and nodded at him. That deep, rumbling voice rolled toward him pleasantly in greeting as he was waved toward the back half of the store.
, Harry thought, with a bit of bite to it. He met Malfoy’s gaze, relaxing a bit at the note of concern in the first question.
Draco sniffed again and waved a hand dismissively. “It’s been ages since I’ve done that—” a muttered ‘ages being last Tuesday’ from Harry at that as he took out two teacups and their accompanying saucers, which Draco pointedly ignored as he continued, “I’ve grown as a person, and as such, I magnanimously decided to come visit one of the less fortunate.” A pointed glance was thrown Harry’s way, prompting him to roll his eyes as he was steeping the tea.
Scowling in an attempt to mitigate his renewed blush, Draco huffed and took another gulp of tea. No, he most definitely did
Harry looked startled, then guilty, and then a bit panicked in quick succession. He was looking anywhere but at Draco as he clutched his teacup in both hands, holding it close to his chest as if it might somehow rescue him from this conversation. It was obvious that he thought he’d have more time before this confrontation and was caught rather flat-footed. His voice was a touch higher than usual as he choked out a reply.
No one had even bothered arguing about the fact that the two seventh year girls had been there nearly every evening since the start of term. They were a part of the group by unspoken agreement. Even the Slytherins hadn’t voiced a protest, though Parkinson had been glaring at the two with ever increasing frequency as time went on. Hermione had noticed this and done her ‘narrowed eyes, lips pursed in thought’ thing that Harry recognized as her figuring out something before everyone else and had decided he didn’t want to know. But while that was going on, Ginny had come right out with it, one of her feet swinging absently behind her as she spoke.
“I didn’t know any of us could draw. Did any of you? The wait for the reveal is going to be excruciating!”
“I’ve been keeping something from you, and I’m scared you’ll be angry. I know who my soulmate is, Draco. I’ve known since my mark manifested at seventeen. I..it’s you. Your words, your handwriting on my skin.”
Draco grumbled a little at the loss of Harry’s fingers inside him but was quick to respond as he flipped onto his back and reached for the other man to tug him closer.
“Ronald Weasley, you startled me! What are you doing here? I thought you were having lunch with Harry? You
Harry chuckled and shrugged, pressing a soft kiss to Draco’s temple before picking up his abandoned toast.
A weak-voiced ‘none taken’ was heard from beside Blaise, who, far from being offended, was laughing madly at Harry’s retort. Pansy was also looking rather impressed and had started clapping part of the way through. There was an outbreak of giggling around the room before everyone finally settled back down, and order was restored. Ginny had crept back into her chair and started chatting with Luna and Millie, and Draco only gave her a cursory glare before leaning into Harry’s side and murmuring in his ear.
Right as he was about to start building a wall between this new lone tower and the main structure, his gaze snagged on a shock of white-blond hair, and he paused, head lifting to take in the sight of Draco settling himself on a lounge chair directly in his line of sight. He was wearing what, in Harry’s opinion, were
Harry paused as he caught sight of himself in the mirror. He’d just gotten out of the shower, and the now familiar script of his soulmark curved along his right hip bone,
Luckily Draco was rather quick on the uptake and hastily yanked his loosened tie over his head and tossed it aside before making short work of the buttons on his shirt and wiggling free of that as well. Harry barely gave Draco time to settle back down again before he was sliding his palms up the other man’s thighs, pushing gently to widen Draco’s stance as he went. He dipped his head and wasted no time in wrapping one fist around the base of Draco’s shaft as he took the head into his mouth and gave an experimental suck.
He blinked owlishly at the sight of an out-of-sorts Draco Malfoy on his doorstep. His uninvited visitor scowled at him and proceeded to vent his spleen. “Well, are you just going to stand there like a lump or invite me in? I’d swear you’d gone deaf if I didn’t already know your brain consists of paint and turpentine.”
One corner of his mouth curled up in a fond grin, Harry obeyed and eased out a little before rocking himself back in. He set a slow, deep rhythm that had Draco arching up to meet him, a needy whine building in the back of his throat. When the blonde was clawing at his back and hissing at him to go
“What gave it away, Potter? Was it the begging you to touch me? Or perhaps my cock in my hand when you came through the door?”
Eventually he’d convinced himself he was being ridiculous and had managed to fall asleep. His alarm had jogged him awake with barely enough time to make himself semi presentable before he’d grabbed the present he’d spent a painstaking amount of time wrapping so carefully even Ron and Hermione would have had a hard time believing it had been Harry who’d managed something so neatly done and high-tailed it out the door. And that was how he found himself here, in Malfoy’s ridiculously huge house, eating delicious food that had no doubt been provided by an army of house elves, and fretting over when lunch would be over and everyone would make their way into the festively decorated parlor to open the presents they’d set under the massive Christmas tree.
Despite his vehement protests to the contrary, he was herded into an empty room down the hall by both Ginny and Hermione, who stood guard to make sure he wasn't walked in on and also that he complied with their demands. A few minutes later (accompanied by some muffled cursing on Harry’s part and a quiet threat or two on Hermione’s), all three of them were making their way back into the parlor where every head swiveled to stare as Ginny practically skipped back in, grinning madly as she reclaimed her seat. There was a low, heated exchange just beyond the door, and then Harry stumbled into the room, obviously having been propelled by Hermione’s shove from behind.
“Why didn’t you ever say anything? Here I was thinking it was just me, and we could’ve been doing this all along.”
He wasn’t sure what part of Draco he loved more, his mouth or his hands, but right at that moment the hands were probably winning as one wrapped around his length and started to stroke him roughly. The other slipped further down to cup his bollocks and give them a gentle tug. Harry grunted as he started to pump himself through the tight circle of Draco’s fist, one of his own hands cupping the back of Draco’s neck and angling him the way he wanted so he could deepen the kiss even further.
Her eyes widened, and she pretended to drop her fork and got up to grab another one to avoid responding. Several people started talking at once, each a bit louder to make themselves heard over the general din. Things continued in this vein until Hermione stood up and swished her wand, and a loud whistle cut through the chatter until everyone shut up, and it stopped. Harry grimaced and shook his head a bit before turning his attention to his best friend as she began to speak.
And then there’d been Ginny and the way they’d left things at the end of sixth year before he’d gone off Horcrux hunting. Harry had felt paralyzed with guilt over the fact that while he’d missed her, it had been her friendship he’d missed and not so much the kissing or the fact that she’d told him she loved him. That part actually filled him with a sick sort of dread, and when she’d finally cornered him at the Burrow one day during the summer after the Battle he’d braced himself for the fallout.
Harry had opted for sitting and had settled himself on the side nearest the shepherd’s pie, of which he was currently enjoying a generous slice. Luna was sitting on his left and sharing details from her latest trip abroad to search for some obscure (and possibly imaginary, Harry was never quite sure) magical creature. He nodded along and made appreciative hums in all the right places to indicate he was listening while actually doing nothing of the sort. Instead he was brooding about whether or not Draco would actually like his gift. He’d been up half the night before worrying about just that and had nearly fire-called Hermione at two in the morning to beg her to say he was ill and couldn’t make it.
“Yes, of course he is. I just..it’s Harry Potter. He’s the bloody Chosen One, Savior of us all. What would he want with the likes of me?”
Before Harry could voice a protest, Draco kissed him once more, soft and sweet before pulling back to continue.
A tingle ran down Draco’s spine as he was greeted by a dark rumble, though the tone was as lush as velvet. Sebastien Toussaint could have given his former Potions professor a run for his money when it came to a voice that could by turns either beguile or cut like glass, but he was far easier on the eyes than Snape could’ve ever hoped to be. Draco shoved that thought aside viciously before nodding politely to the tailor and returning the polite greeting and launching into an explanation of why he was there and what he wanted.
“So you finally got your shit together, huh? Nice. It’s about time, Harry. Cheers, by the way. I think this means I won the pool.”
Harry had removed his fingers part of the way through Draco’s rant and replaced them with his cock, positioning the head at his entrance and pushing insistently past the tight ring of muscle, causing Draco to devolve into wordless gasping as he sank deeper into him. It didn’t take long for the blond to come back to himself enough to take over, however, and soon he was placing his palms flat against Harry’s chest to give himself the leverage to start riding him in earnest.
It had been a long and eventful year, to say the least. All the returning eighth years had shared a dorm, and the new headmistress’s policy of inter-house unity was in full effect. She expected him to “set an example for the younger students, Potter”, and one did not disappoint Minerva McGonagall lightly. So they’d fumbled along together and somehow managed to form the oddest group of friends that Hogwarts had seen in quite some time.
Reaching out a hand, Harry trailed his fingers through the mess on Draco’s chest, smearing the wetness into his skin as Draco opened his eyes and looked up at him, expression raw and his lower lip trembling slightly. Harry shushed him, tweaking one of his nipples sharply just because he could while he murmured to him in a low, soothing tone.
He remembered the night depicted in the drawing vividly. The whole gang had been out together at a bar for one of their infrequent pub nights, and at that particular moment Draco had been just a little bit tipsy and feeling carefree. Blaise had been telling everyone a rather salacious story about a former paramour, and the artist had apparently been inspired by Draco’s amusement. The level of detail was actually quite impressive, and his eyes kept getting caught on little things like the objects scattered across the table or the curve of Hermione’s cheekbones, as she’d been sitting to his left and was also in the drawing as a result.
“What were you thinking of, I wonder? That is, I’m assuming you’re capable of rational thought. Perhaps I should remember who I’m talking to.”
Draco was going to kill her. Just as soon as he could figure out a way to do that without anyone finding out it was him, that was. Eyes narrowed dangerously, he jerked to his feet and practically stalked over to the tree and picked up the next gift, and the torture continued through Millie unwrapping some sort of contraption involving her beloved cat, Hermione’s rare first-edition of a book no one else in the room had likely ever heard of, let alone read, ad nauseam until there was only one present left underneath the tree. Picking it up he paused to admire the rather elegant job whoever had gotten him had done wrapping it before making his way back to his chair and settling in to open it.
He cackled at Draco’s outraged spluttering and ducked the stinging hex the other man sent his way as he disappeared into the bathroom and to safety. Draco growled at him, his words only slightly muffled through the closed door between them.
“For someone who turned in so early, you don’t look particularly well-rested, Potter. Were the accommodations not to your liking, hm? Pillows not soft enough? Or was it something else? Did the close proximity to my perfection unnerve you, perhaps?”
“I just do. Like I know that you’re going to say yes when I ask you to dinner tonight. And then again when I ask you back to mine after.”
“Well, it’s about bloody time! I was beginning to think we’d have to dose you two idiots with something before you drove the rest of us mad.”
It was Harry’s turn to yank Draco towards him, his mouth colliding with the other man’s as he kissed him with a newfound sense of urgency. He felt Draco groan into the kiss, their tongues exploring each other thoroughly for several drawn-out moments. When they finally broke away long enough to gasp for air, Harry looked into Draco’s flushed face, his own cheeks heated but voice low and thick with need.
“H-harry, fuck! It’s good.. so good. Like your mouth was made for my cock. I’m going to come, and you’re going to take all of it, aren’t you?”
“No, I like it. I like..everything you’re doing. More of it, please, and preferably horizontally sometime in the near future if you would be so kind.”
Shoving his arms in the sleeves, he barely took the time to glance at his appearance in his stand mirror before turning abruptly on the spot and vanishing with a pop. Reappearing on the top step of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, Draco caught his balance and took a deep breath before lifting the ancient looking knocker and rapping it sharply against the door several times before letting it fall and hugging himself against the cold that bit into him while he waited for a response.
Harry stumbled back against the island when Draco pushed him, a hand gripping the counter to steady himself as the other man swept out of the kitchen. He blinked, a bit stunned by both the force of Draco’s outburst and the fact that even though Draco was mad at him, he’d still made sure that Harry would get dinner. Sighing at the realization that he’d really screwed this up, he ran a hand over his face and slowly puttered over to the cooling cupboard to retrieve the food and warm it with a charm. There was no point in chasing after Draco just then. He’d probably get something thrown at his head for his trouble.
Misery radiating off of him, he looked up from where he was fidgeting with his hands at Pansy’s incredulous snort. She was shaking her head and looking at him as if it was taking the last of both her patience and her sanity to put up with him at all.
“You want me,” Harry was looking at Draco like he wanted to devour him whole, and the blond blushed hotly and looked away. Dropping the letter on the desk, he advanced on the other man, who swallowed convulsively before seeming to find his capacity for snark once more.
Pressing his lips together so hard they went white, Draco shifted in his seat a few times, as if wrestling with himself, before bursting out, “Then why haven’t you?”
So it was that he found himself expending his excess energy by pacing in his tastefully decorated sitting room, the decor courtesy of Pansy since she’d taken to interior design after school like a duck to water. He was having a hard time coming up with an idea of what to get Malfoy for Christmas. Harry desperately wanted him to like it, but what did you get a man who could (and frequently did) buy whatever his heart desired? He knew Malfoy’s taste in everything from clothing, to wine, to music was far superior to his own, so Harry was more than a little unnerved at this point. It’d have to be something unexpected. His head came up sharply as an idea coalesced in his mind. It was perfect, but it would also leave him exposed with nowhere to hide once they did the whole ‘revealing who got who’ bit of the exchange. Well, he hadn’t been sorted into Gryffindor for nothing.
Draco flushed hotly at that and bowed his head to hide it. It was bad enough being caught out like this in front of half their year mates, but that Harry had heard her basically confirm that he’d been pining over him like some… some pathetic first year with a sodding crush was going too far. That she had
Draco plucked a biscuit from the plate and pointed it at Harry for emphasis as he lifted his chin a notch and adopted an exaggerated version of his usual drawl.
Of course, Draco had taken off running before he’d even finished speaking, cackling madly as Harry cursed and nearly tripped over his shed clothing as he spun about and raced after him. He didn’t quite manage to catch up, and Draco grinned triumphantly at him after wading in up to his waist and turning about, so he was facing Harry as he caught up to him. Harry skidded to a stop in front of him, eyes narrowing as Draco gave him a taunting little wave.
“Monsieur Malfoy, this way if you please. I took the liberty of setting your purchase out for viewing. You will tell me what you think of my creation.”
But there were nights when he imagined more, and it looked like this was going to be one of them. His gaze drifted around the room until it snagged on the box resting open on the coffee table in front of him. Sitting up suddenly, he reached out and lifted his present from the gift exchange earlier out of the nest of tissue paper and looked down at it, mind whirring despite his fatigue. He couldn’t let it go, the question of who the artist was. He’d been trying to ignore it, but it kept creeping back up on him when he wasn’t vigilant.
That didn’t stop his mind from betraying him on a regular basis by doing things like offering up delightful commentary on how good Harry looked in his Auror robes or reminding him how warm that familiar lopsided grin was when directed at Draco, the one that was reserved for his friends and reached all the way to his eyes in a way those wider and more patented smiles for the general public did not. Draco’s breath hitched as an image flashed through his mind, one like many he’d had before but usually only entertained in the privacy of his bedroom at night.
Harry had finally had enough and fixed Blaise with a severe frown and began speaking. Draco abruptly closed his mouth and leaned back in his seat, mildly curious to see how Harry would handle the whole thing.
“The amount I took, at the strength I brewed it, about an hour.” Draco bit off each word sharply, leveling Harry with a frosty glare of reproach at the insult.
“They’re Hermione’s favorite I’ll have you know. There’s nothing wrong with shortbread. You’re such a snob, Malfoy.”
Harry moaned raggedly when Draco’s teeth grazed a particularly sensitive spot behind his left ear, and he muttered a continuous stream of commentary as one of Draco’s hands teased his hard cock in turn, nimble fingers rolling the foreskin down and using the pre-come beading there to slick the shaft before gripping it firmly and tugging to match Harry’s own quickening pulls on Draco’s length.
Harry was breathing hard, eyes still sparking with temper, and as Draco watched him, his own eyes a bit wide, he couldn’t help but think it was probably one of the hottest things he’d ever seen in his life. He must’ve made some sort of sound, a small needy sort of thing, surely, for Harry refocused on him intently and smoothed a hand down his back, some of the tightness leaving his expression as he spoke again.
As he trudged along picking up different things he thought might meet with Luna’s approval, he couldn’t help but steal the occasional (frequent) glance towards Draco’s long, lithe form stretched out sunbathing in his lounge chair. He hoped that the man had applied a sunscreen potion and not just used charms. His skin was rather delicate, and the charms wore off a lot faster. Chewing his lower lip in thought, Harry missed the looks Ron and Hermione were exchanging without his knowledge. If he’d been paying closer attention, he might’ve suspected more of his friends being behind planning this vacation than just Blaise alone, and perhaps he’d’ve been right.
He could’ve seen it now if it weren’t for that pesky blindfold. He didn’t have much cause to complain, however, when he felt Harry pull his hand away to cast a wandless
“I said, do you want biscuits, too? I have chocolate and plain shortbread ones, so pick your poison.”
When they’d tired each other out enough to call a truce, Harry closed the distance between them, smiling as he reached out without thinking to sweep a stray lock of hair out of Draco’s face and tuck it gently behind his ear. The other man stilled, gaze locking with Harry’s. They stood there like that, the moment stretching between them, and it was Draco who broke it first, surging toward Harry and wrapping an arm around his waist to haul him closer, the other hand fisting in his hair as he kissed him fiercely.
“Are you alright? We don’t have to stay in here. It’s a ridiculous game, anyway. I’ll get Theo back for this, rest assured.”
He reinforced the threat by palming his own length with a hissed inhale, loving the way Harry’s eyes devoured the motion as if it were the most enthralling thing he’d ever seen. In short order Harry was naked and crawling across the bed until he was atop Draco. Smacking Draco’s hand off his own cock, Harry kissed him hotly as he replaced it with his own, fingers curling in a loose fist around it and starting to pump it slowly. With a sound like he was dying, Draco arched up into the touch, fingers scrabbling on the sheets as he sought any kind of purchase. He broke the kiss to gasp for air before moving on to exploring the expanse of Harry’s neck with his lips and tongue.
That thought brought him back to himself with a jolt, and he broke the kiss despite the keening noise Draco made as he tried to pull him back in for another. He shook his head, but he was smiling as he did so, instead pressing soft but fervent kisses along Draco’s jawline before nuzzling behind his ear, lips catching along the delicate shell of it as he murmured to him.
Draco’s insides felt like they’d caught fire at the sound of the endearment rolling off Harry’s tongue, and he shut the other man up by kissing him soundly before pulling back and nodding quickly.
Harry’s eyes darkened, and he gave Draco such a wicked smile that a shudder of anticipation wracked his frame as Harry murmured to him.
Harry knew that he and Malfoy weren’t exactly enemies anymore, but this was a bit much if you asked him. He was currently rethinking all of his life choices that had led to this moment, but the most significant one had been letting himself be dragged along to this party. The ultimate blame, he decided, belonged to the organizers, and a more unlikely bunch of party planners he never could have imagined. Ginny had started it one evening, lounging on her stomach in the eighth year common room surrounded by pillows and patiently allowing her girlfriend to thread a bright green ribbon through her hair as Luna plaited it for her.
“You’ll be the death of me, Harry, but if you want to talk, we’ll talk. Now get moving before I change my mind and have you out here on the bloody shore.”
Harry woke up to the sound of the shower running. Blinking blearily, he groaned and sat up, stretching his back and rolling his neck to work the kinks out of it. Looking longingly at his pillows piled behind him, he contemplated just rolling over and going back to sleep, but he knew he wasn’t going to. He’d spent enough time yesterday being avoidant. No, he was going to apologize to Draco this morning, no matter how much the thought made his stomach heave with nerves. Shaking his head at himself, he got up and made a half-hearted attempt at making himself presentable without access to the bathroom, gave it up as a bad job, and flopped back down onto his bed to wait for Draco.
A smirk curved Draco’s lips as he shrugged out of his coat and handed it over, watching as Harry hung it on a coat rack just by the door before heading deeper into the house and toward the kitchen. He answered in the affirmative and followed the other man at a leisurely pace. It wasn’t the first time he’d been here, but it
“If you don’t hurry up, I can’t promise that Weasley won’t eat it all. Where the hell he puts it all I still don’t know.”
Draco stroked his back slowly as they both came down from their respective highs, and Harry pressed lazy kisses against skin everywhere he could reach until he had enough wherewithal to ease his softening cock out of the other man and gently let his legs back down from where Harry’d had him nearly folded in half. Harry shifted onto his side and pulled Draco flush against him so they were chest to chest. Kissing languidly, they just bathed in the afterglow, sharing soft touches and looks that required no words at all to be understood in the moment.
Draco was almost positive that Harry hadn’t heard him at that point, but he just laughed softly to himself and clung tighter to him as his own eyes started to drift shut. So it surprised him to hear a response that was nothing but the barest rumble in his ear right before sleep claimed him.
Harry’s answering grin was so bright Draco almost had to look away but found the motion quite arrested when Harry yanked his t-shirt over his head and tossed it carelessly to the floor. His fingers fumbled on his buttons as he stared unabashedly at the flat planes of Harry’s chest and stomach. Dear Merlin, he was fit. He knew being an Auror kept one active, but it really wasn’t quite fair how attractive Harry was. The heated stare he got in return made his cheeks go pink as Harry sauntered up to him and took over undoing the rest of Draco’s buttons before pushing his shirt down and off his shoulders.
Slouching into a chair at the breakfast nook, he ate his leftover curry (along with an extra helping of guilt; Draco knew it was one of his favorites) and fretted over how the hell he could possibly fix this without completely ruining his friendship with Draco. He’d basically announced his interest in the other man to all and sundry at breakfast, and he couldn’t very well take it back now. Shoving away his empty plate, he groaned and ran his hands through his hair in an agitated gesture.
It must have been nearing midnight when Pansy found him nodding off on the sofa. He jerked awake with a snort when she plopped herself down beside him with an exaggerated sigh and gave him a level look that reminded him eerily of Hermione before addressing him in a slightly bored tone.
Draco swallowed convulsively, his gaze locked with Harry’s as he took this in. When he managed a reply, it was a harsh whisper, the hand in Harry’s hair tightening as he drew him close.
Even though Draco had already come his excitement didn’t seem to have abated much. That was, if the little keening moans he was making were any indication, and Harry was pretty sure it was a safe bet. He finally pulled back from Draco’s mouth but only so he could keep up a steady stream of commentary as he felt himself getting close.
He halted mid-sentence when Draco held up a hand and flushed a dull red as he met his gaze, licking his lips nervously as he waited for his response. The blond had ceased attempting to dry his hair while listening to Harry’s rambling apology, and the scowl was also gone from his face, now replaced with a look that was half exasperated, half fond.
And so Harry was stuck. They weren’t enemies anymore, but Malfoy still kept him at arms-length, still called him
“I do believe I’ve bested you a second time. Is the Chosen One losing his edge? My, your adoring fans will just be crushed. How sad.”
“Even after all these years he still seems a bit surprised to get anything. It’s enough to break your heart, that is. Mum always sends him extra fudge, bless her. She about had kittens in second year, remember? When me and the twins told her those awful Muggles were starving him?”
Sometimes he thought he should join her for the whole stretch, but he’d miss his friends, his work. Granted, he didn’t strictly
“Found you, did he?” At Harry’s hesitant nod, she continued. “So he yelled at you, stormed off to your room in a strop, and you’ve been camping out down here to avoid him some more? Pathetic, Potter. I’d have expected better from you, at least. You’re acting like a dramatic twat, which is that other idiot’s job. The quota for our friend group has been filled, thanks ever so. I can’t
He considered breaking the silence, but he was rather enjoying watching the other man just then, not to mention if he spoke he might have to admit what he was doing there. Now that he was sitting here ensconced in Harry’s kitchen his initial daring, which had carried him through the rush of arriving on the doorstep of Grimmauld Place at an ungodly hour, had deserted him. Instead Draco admired the broad sweep of Harry’s shoulders and the way his sides tapered to slim hips that shifted as he moved about preparing the tea. It hadn’t escaped Draco’s notice that Harry was clad in nothing but a thin t-shirt and worn joggers, and if he indulged in the opportunity to appreciate the way the fabric molded to the tight curves of Harry’s arse, well..surely he couldn’t be blamed, could he? Unfortunately this meant he
“Potter, you better not skimp on the good stuff. You’re hosting New Year’s Eve. I have a feeling we’re going to need more than butterbeers and lager this year.”
Harry could feel the tips of his ears going hot with embarrassment as he accepted the box from Malfoy with a mumbled apology. Eyes rolling heavenward, the other man stalked back to his chair and flopped down for a break while Harry opened his gift. Tearing off the wrapping paper, Harry opened the box and stared down at the carefully folded garments inside. Hermione gave a little gasp and demanded Harry angle the box out for them all to see better, but what happened next was all Blaise’s fault when he chimed in with a gleeful suggestion that Harry should try them on.
Ginny stared as Malfoy and Harry snogged, as they ravished each other's mouths with nothing short of love and passion. She wanted to scream out of pure shock, but no sound came out of her mouth. Her vocal cords were failing her every passing minute, so she settled on nodding at Ron who screeched, "Bloody hell!"
Hermione just stood there listening to his rant, not moving a muscle. "Are you done?" she questioned, with a raised brow.
Draco then thought about a lubricating charm, but the amount of slick Harry was producing made that unnecessary. Draco ran his prick along the crack of Harry's arse, his head catching on Harry's rim deliciously. Harry began to thrust back, trying to get Draco's prick inside of him. Draco laughed before slowly pushing his spongy head into Harry's eager dripping hole.
Harry being the gentleman that he is had apologized to her during breakfast the very next day after she kicked him out of her room. That didn't mean that it didn't hurt. Ginny knows she has to move on, and that's exactly what she'll do. Starting with finding out who Harry's mystery girlfriend is. No one seems to know. Not even Ron and Hermione. But Ginny was going to find out.
"More.....need more...I'm already prepared.." Harry whined. Draco decided to take mercy on Harry and give him what he really wanted. When he pulled his fingers out and squeezed Harry's perky bunny tail, Harry started to moan again.
Ginny was still sniffling into Luna's shoulder refusing to look up and Hermione started to comfort Ron, rubbing his back as Ron reluctantly sat down next to Seamus.
Harry looked at him with glassy eyes and tackled him with a bear hug. "Thanks, Ron. You have no idea how much that means to me." Ron tightened his grip on Harry's back. Once they broke apart, Harry gave him a genuine smile whilst clutching Ron's shoulders.
"Harry mate, you've got to tell us who your new girlfriend is!" Dean called out from where he was lounging on his bed, making no attempt whatsoever to get dressed.
"It has not!" Ron countered, but his argument was feeble and he knew it. "I can't steal from Harry and it's an invasion of privacy."
Madam Pomfrey turned to Draco expectantly. Draco finally gave in and sighed muttering, "Fine, fine, I'll comfort Potter."
At that, the whole common room fell silent as everyone's gaze made its way to Dean. Dean grinned sheepishly, wondering if he'd been that loud. Harry was blushing violently, opting to snuggle into Draco's chest and never crawl out of his lap. Ron lookedas though he was ready to faint.
"I like the sound of 'Draco' too..." he admitted softly, gazing once more into Draco's eyes, the grey a shade of molten silver.
"All right everyone! Gather around, as I'm sure you've heard, we are gonna be playing truth or dare again this Friday, however tonight, we'll be playing the extreme version." Hermione addressed the whole group of eighth-year students sitting around in a circle. The only non-eighth years present were Ginny and Luna. Luna was sitting next to Neville, whilst Ginny found herself on Harry's lap. Harry managed a smile as Seamus gave him a thumbs-up.
Harry felt very relaxed having Draco's cock up his arse. It felt incredible plugging him up full of Draco's come, the thought itself being extremely erotic. Harry reveled in the feeling of being so full and experimentally wriggled his bum on Draco's cock. He felt Draco's cock twitch inside him before Draco spanked him lightly. "You're going to get me hard again if you keep doing that Harry," Draco hissed. Harry's giggles quickly turned into moans as Draco grinded his cock into Harry's backside stimulating Harry's sensitive nerves making Harry cry out.
Harry gulped and nodded nervously. Last week Seamus had dared them to make out for a whole of five minutes. Harry had thought that was extreme, he had no idea what was in store for him today. Besides, snogging Ginny wasn't as incredible as it had once been. It was almost as though the spark they once had was lost. Harry knew that he should talk to his girlfriend, although the last thing he ever wanted to do was to hurt her. Other than that, most of his thoughts lately revolved around Malfoy. Malfoy had scowled so hard at Harry last week after the snogging session, that Harry was afraid that his face would get marred with wrinkles before they graduated. The git was still a git, however, he was trying to turn over a new leaf and Harry couldn't help but notice the outline of his abs underneath his white shirt, or his silvery grey eyes or the way his blond hair fell over his eyes.....
Malfoy smiled back at him although a bit sadly as though the reality of things had just caught up with him. "And you'll have to break up with the weaslette-uh I mean...Ginny," he corrected with much difficulty, "You'll have to break up with her first."
Malfoy was beside him in an instant. "Potter, Potter!" he said urgently, shaking Harry, "What's wrong with you? You're burning up!"
Harry turned his head to look over at Draco. With the moonlight hitting his cheekbones and illuminating his face, Harry thought that he had never looked more beautiful. "I love you too Draco," Harry reciprocated, "I want to be with you too."
"Always wanted to do this," Draco said whilst he continued to grope Harry's bottom. Harry blushed, "Well then, you should have done it sooner." Just as Harry was about to make another snarky remark, more slick dripped out of his hole and he cried out.
It was Pansy who broke the silence. "These things happen," she said, "I'd say it's very noble of Potter to not mention how terrible his girlfriend is at sex before this moment and," she grimaced, "to put up with that. Weasley, girl come to me for advice. As for you Potter, come on, give it a spin."
As the game continued, it somehow became normal for people in relationships to snog-or do other things- with other people. Hermione was dared to make out with Luna and Blaise was dared to eat out Ginny, right in front of Harry's eyes and the way she moaned told him very clearly, that Zabini was much, much better than him when it came to eating a girl's vagina out. Harry was thinking about rushing back to his dorm, fuck the rules when Nott's voice called his name again.
"Harry I hope you know that I'm not mad at you for breaking up with my sister. To this day neither you nor she would tell me what happened between the two of you." Ron said gently. "I admit I did want you two to get married, hell you're my best mate Harry! I wanted us to legally be family. But I see how incredibly happy you've been recently. Truth be told, I was so worried about you after the war. It pained me to see how broken you looked and that's when I realized that it would no longer work with you and Ginny. You both deserve better. You'll always be a part of the Weasley family mate, we don't need a piece of paper to know that."
"Potions accident," Draco told her, "Animagus potion, but it wasn't completed, we had yet to add the rat's blood."
He yanked the door open to find a fuming Pansy tapping her foot, a scowl etched across her face. "Seriously, Pansy?" Draco glowered, "Do you think that I've got nothing better to do with my life?"
Harry felt very bereft and empty without a thick plug filling him up. Draco however, was enjoying seeing Harry squirm as he still denied to give Harry what he truly wanted. His fingers prodded Harry's hole. He was indeed filled up with Draco's come from earlier as it started flowing out of Harry's hole and dripping down his thighs. Draco pushed two fingers in and start finger fucking Harry, gently as though to further aggravate Harry. Harry was fuming, he was so well prepared couldn't Draco see that? But no, Draco was doing this on purpose.
"Draco...." Harry moaned as Draco had started to kiss down Harry's neck, sucking on the sweet spot just above Harry's collarbone.
What he didn't notice was that Draco Malfoy who had just exited the Headmistress's office, was looking in bewilderment at the retreating form of Harry, and without much thought, Draco began to follow him towards their common room.
"Oh shut up, Potter! I didn't dare you to suck him off, you just have to sit on his lap!" Nott said frustratingly.
Padma sighed loudly and got up. "Oh alright, fine!" she finally surrendered, "Nott get your arse over here and don't expect for a replay."
"Love what, Harry?" Draco egged on. "I love hav-having your cock in my arse! Please fu-fuck me, please!" Harry cried out. Draco, very obviously pleased with Harry's reply, resumed thrusting in and out of Harry's arse, grabbing onto Harry's hips and trailing kisses down his back. He grasped Harry's chin and turned Harry's face, catching Harry's lips in a hungry kiss. Harry moaned into Draco's mouth.
"Oh," Draco said feeling indifferent. He didn't know how to feel, Potter would be back to normal soon, but he looked so adorable with the tail and ears...... Draco just wanted to....
Ron threw his hands up in the air in surrender, "Fine, fine just worried about ya, that's all." Then he added, "Can't let our cute little bunny get lost."
The game continued, and with Parkinson complaining that it was getting boring as no one was picking dare, a new rule was established, claiming that truth couldn't be picked twice in a row.
Harry didn't know what was happening to him. Sure he didn't find Ginny all that attractive as he once had but the thought of being gay had never crossed his mind. He had never had such a strong urge to have a cock or anything up his arse. He whined, thinking about how amazing it would feel filling him up. Just when he was about to cram his fingers up his arse again, he heard the shuffling of footsteps.
"Excuse me Mister Zabini, out of my way, thank you. You too Miss Greengrass, let me through everyone." McGonagall's voice echoed.
When Draco returned to their work station, grumbling about how Potter was absolutely useless, he was met with a sight that wiped the scowl right off his face. Harry was bent over their cauldron, stirring lazily and leaning forward, with his arse pushed high in the air.
Harry sniffled, "I'm pretty sure she hates me now," he said looking down. Malfoy grasped his chin in his hand and tilted his face up to meet him. "No one could hate you, you're the savior."
This led to Draco giving her his best scowl and prying his arm away from her grasp. "Yeah, totally! I'll see him and his pathetic girlfriend sprawled over each other on the floor," he growled, "Oh and for good measure, why don't you dare them to kiss again, Pansy? Surely I would definitely want to see that again."
