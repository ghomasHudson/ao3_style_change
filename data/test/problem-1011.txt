Rage grew in his chest. It was so easy for her to say that. She didn’t understand what it was like to be in love with someone who’s supposed to kill you. He opened his mouth to say that, then stopped himself. Hermione should’ve been in hiding, given that she was a Muggle-born and in danger, yet here she was. He had to cut her some slack.
“You said we’re friends, right?” Draco looked up, finally looking into Harry’s emerald green eyes, who was busy reading his lips, which also had a few cuts. His platinum blond hair, for once, was not combed to perfection, nor did it have any sort of weird gel in it. It fell into his eyes. When Harry nodded, he shrugged. “Then you have every right to ask.”
As much as Harry wanted to say he was angry at Draco, he knew he was being unreasonable. He knew it was too much to ask for. Leaning back in his seat, he gently stroked the scar on his forehead, trying to soothe the pain. It was late at night and Hermione and Ron were asleep downstairs. It was getting more difficult for Harry to sleep. As the stress grew, the nightmares increased.
The Sorting Ceremony was done and everyone finished the feast, and Dumbledore said a few words before everyone headed to their dorms. Harry went up to his dorm, tired and annoyed with Malfoy. He knew he had to be up to something, but despite his tries to talk about it to Ron, no one seemed to listen to him nor believe him.
Realizing he was being serious, she nodded, her smile fading. She looked over to the fireplace in front of them, soaking up the heat as she watched her best friend at a loss for words. This was a first. No matter whatever happened - being turned into a ferret, Cedric’s death, Harry Potter opening the chamber of secrets, whatever it was; there was never an instance Draco couldn’t put what he was feeling into words. Unless, of course, this was a new emotion he was feeling...
“You’re wonderful,” Draco whispered. “And I don’t know why, but the thought of you with someone else feels awful.”
“You know,” She made the sound again, looking at him as if he was the weird one for not understanding what she meant. “You’re so whipped for him.”
“I’m sorry I let you stay there,” Harry answered, pulling Draco close to him, “I’m sorry I left you to stay there. I’m sorry I pushed you to tell me something you didn’t want to tell me.”
“Seems like you’re trying a little too hard to get his attention,” Blaise chuckled, quietening down when he earned a dirty look from Draco.
Harry slammed open his dorm room door, walking inside. Pansy and Draco barely managed to enter through, and went to stand at a corner.
He presumed it was Ron who helped him upstairs and into one of the guest rooms. About five or ten minutes later, his scar had stopped seething and he was finally regaining his senses. “Are you okay?” he asked, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I can get you some more water.”
Harry could feel it; something was so terribly wrong. It was making his insides lurch. It was making his chest tighten, and his heart sink every time he imagined a worse and worse scenario about what’s happened to Draco. His left cheek was hurting, for some odd reason.
“I can’t deal with this. I can’t-” Harry paused, trying to form a sentence amidst of trying not to cry. “I trusted you, with absolutely everything.”
Massaging his temples, he decided it would be easier to just go to Luna’s party and figure out what to do about him later. After all, he still had a month. He stared at the invitation to his and Draco’s ‘wedding’, smiling almost bitterly. Imagine if that was real - imagine if Draco’s father wasn’t a complete dickhead. They could actually have had this type of wedding. They could probably hyphenate the names, though he wasn’t sure if Lucius would like that very much.
Hermione and Ron didn’t question the shift in Harry’s behavior. He had been fine Christmas day, but the whole week after, he went back to barely talking to anyone. They didn’t want to keep prying. He had already seemed tired of their worrying.
“Seemed funny enough to me,” Harry said, grabbing his hands and flipping him over, intertwining their legs together. Just as he leaned forward to kiss Draco again, who seemed caught off guard, Hermione’s voice came from just outside the room, stopping the ‘pause’ in their curse.
“When you’re the Boy Who Lived, anything will get you on it,” Draco muttered. The two stared at each other, unsure if there was anything else to say. There were a lot of things Draco wanted to tell Harry, but… was it different now?
“Watch me,” Harry said with a grin, standing up and walking to the door. He turned and smirked slightly at Hermione. “Tell Pansy and Draco to leave my Invisibility Cloak on their way out.”
“Yeah, I did. Congratulations,” Harry said. Ginny took this as an opportunity to quickly walk away, making Harry at ease again, not listening to a word of what Ron was telling Harry about the match.
“Yeah, and we’ve been enemies for five years! Do you expect that to just go away now that we’re dating? You expect me to just forget the kinds of things you’ve done?”
Harry quickly put an arm forward to stop Draco from walking any closer to Hermione. “Oookay, while this conversation has been fun, I only have a few hours left with Draco, so let’s just leave it, alright?” Harry interjected.
And then it happened. Sirius, gone through the veil. It was Harry’s fault, again. The words Remus said to him seemed to play in his head over and over again.
On a night in the middle of February, Draco was reading a book and Harry was trying to write an essay that was due the next day.
“I’m sure it was hard to be a pure-blood and welcomed into the Malfoy family lovingly,” Harry said loudly, then put a hand to his mouth. Everyone stared at him in disbelief, except Draco, who seemed like he was trying to stifle his amusement. “Er… sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.”
“I’m not making fun of you! That was a genuine attempt,” he said, trying not to laugh. “Would you like me to try again?” He straightened his back, running his hands through Draco’s hair. “Ahem ahem,
He loved it so much. Harry was so grateful to have someone as beautiful as Draco. And he didn’t mean on the outside (Draco was very attractive on the outside too). Harry meant Draco’s kind heart. The cold exterior that Draco had put up all those years had finally been broken, and Harry felt so happy about it.
Hearing the door chime as someone entered, Harry cursed under his breath then turned around. “I’m sorry, we’re closed-”
“I didn’t know what the spell did,” Harry said at once. “I really didn’t. I was angry, and I was hurt, and I wasn’t thinking straight. I know there’s no excuse, but Draco, I-”
Snape came into view. “...Twenty points from Gryffindor and ten from Slytherin. Now go get cleaned up before I give you detention,” he said, giving them both a deathly stare. The two quickly nodded and left for the bathroom in silence.
“What?” Draco’s eyes widened, then he scoffed. “I didn’t take you as such a superficial person, Harry.”
When Friday finally came along, Draco was behaving normally. Had he forgotten? No, he couldn’t have. Their one month deal was clear. He sat down across from Harry, the two silent as they did their own work. Draco now sometimes also did homework with Harry.
Draco made his way to the owlery as per his new daily morning routine, clutching two pieces of paper in his hand. One was a silly poem, the other one was… something he shouldn’t have even considered sending to Harry. It was stupid, yet perfectly described Draco’s thoughts throughout this whole mishap. Only he knew how horrible the burning feeling in his chest felt, yet no one seemed to believe how sorry he actually was.
“You’re worth the risk, Draco, but not when it’s you I’d be losing,” Harry stepped forward too. “I saw what happened with Sirius. I don’t care anymore. I want to spend time with you. I’m all in, for real this time. If you’ll have me.”
That was, until, Harry saw the actual Draco Malfoy standing in the hallway. Harry dropped the books in his hand, stopped walking, and almost fell over. The books had hit the floor with a huge
“Oh come on, it’s Draco. He always says things he doesn’t mean.” Pansy told him with an eye roll. Pansy pushed him down on the chair. “Draco told me what happened.”
Draco picked up the vial of hellebore, using his right hand instead so they wouldn’t have to look at the bracelet. There was silence until Harry gasped. “You put ten drops! It said to put exactly seven-”
“Ye...yeah, no I won’t. I’m just not up for it today…” Harry said, “Sorry, Ron. You go on ahead.” Ron nodded, reluctantly shutting the door behind him and catching up with Hermione, Pansy, Neville, Luna, Blaise, Dean and Seamus who were all about to leave for the feast.
“I know you deserve someone better. Someone you can trust, someone who’s an easy option.” His voice was broken, and his words were slightly incoherent due to the tears rushing down his face.
“Y-yes, I was,” Draco answered slowly. He wasn't surprised by Harry's sudden entrance. It was as if Draco knew he was there the whole time.
December was rapidly approaching - the first three months of Hogwarts had been fun. Sneaking around, pretending to be enemies, studying together, making out in broom closets. It was like sixth year all over again, minus the secrets.
Picking up his quill, he pursed his lips, staring at the dying fire in front of him, the quiet crackling of the wood. Moving closer to the fire, he straightened the fresh page of his journal. Perhaps confronting his feelings would help.
“How did it feel?” Harry asked slowly. “Her disgusting, dry lips on yours. Her arms around your neck. Your beautiful, soft lips, on hers. Pulling her closer to you.”
“So it wasn’t a stupid Muggle game when you were winning in Monopoly?” Harry questioned, standing up and making his way to Draco, kissing his neck softly, who moved further into Harry’s arms, letting himself get distracted for a moment.
Draco sank down to the ground too, fiddling with the bracelet on his wrist. “I thought we’d be able to move past it, but… with the way our relationship started… maybe there can’t be full trust between us.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Harry said after he composed himself, surprised to see him there. The house elves were all done with cleaning and cooking, so they were off somewhere else. Which, in Harry’s opinion, made things worse. He got a glass and poured water in it, downing it as quickly as possible before turning to leave.
Someone slowly knocked on the door. Draco hadn’t noticed since he was busy writing away on the paper. He also hadn’t noticed that his Dark Mark and forehead was hurting deeply.
“Still?” He asked, taking off his glasses, massaging his temples as he sat down beside Ron. “It’s not my fault that I don’t have feelings for her.”
“You’ll see soon, Draco,” said Snape. “The reason I found out was because of this theory. A legend, you could say.”
“Harry.”  Harry could sense the tone of Draco’s voice. It was serious, it was cold, it was a tone that implied that he was shutting himself off and that he wasn’t going to talk to Harry.
She sat down on the floor, stretching her back. “I thought he said you were worth the risk for everything.”
“Can you stop?” Harry asked. “You don’t need to tread carefully around me. I’m not made of glass. Just treat me like you normally would. I hate that you think you need to tread carefully and be extra nice to me. Just leave me be. I’ll figure things out on my own.”
The utter feeling of shame and guilt swirling around his chest, Draco rolled down the sleeve of his left arm where his Dark Mark was peeking out.
“He’s hurt,” Harry explained. “I need to go get help for him at Hogwarts. Can you stay here with him as I do so?”
“No,” he said quickly. “No. I understand, Father. When the time comes, I will help.” He had learnt to sound genuine when he said these things.
“It’s not that great to hear, you know,” he said. “If you don’t want to deal with someone, you just get to close your eyes. It’s quite funny, actually.”
Just then, the door sprung wide open. Draco and Harry managed to jump apart just in time, both breathing heavily, almost having a heart attack. Harry bit his lip as he stood there for a few moments, looking at Draco, before turning to who was at the door.
“Merlin, you need to read this book. Well, it’s not really your type, but it’s so good. I’m on the fifth chapter, and it’s awesome already.” Harry ranted as he finished the chapter. “Draco, you have got to read this-”
gosh who am i!! two updates in one week?? anyway, a bit of a shorter chapter, but y'know, it felt right, so here ya go! lemme know thoughts and stuff, i love seeing all of your comments!
“If you keep acting like this, yes. I’m afraid I need an explanation as to why you’re acting so abnormally kind.”
As winter break began and ended, time that had been slipping away finally started to slow down, but not for the right reasons. Draco was busy with ‘work’ he had been assigned for ‘extra credit’, so Harry spent most of his time in the Gryffindor Common Room. It was nearing the end of January. He thought about this time last year - they were still trying to figure out their feelings.
“Ah, Mr. Potter, so nice of you to join us,” Snape said in his usual demeaning voice, “Ten minutes late. Twenty points from Gryffindor. And please come, sit over here.” Snape pointed to an empty table right at the front of the class. Harry rolled his eyes and went to sit down. Just as Harry sat down, Draco entered the classroom. Gryffindors had Defence Against the Dark Arts with the Slytherins this year.
Of course, he didn’t say that out loud. He could just imagine the shock on her face and the judgment coming from both her and Ron.
“Okay, Harry, that was a lot harder than I thought it’d be. No offense,” Pansy sat down. Harry laughed as he put his hearing aids back on, then turned to Draco, who was searching face for something frantically.
If none of you are still here (which isn't surprising, you probably aren't), I might continue this story later on, when I have more time.
“Is this your bed?” Harry asked, pointing to one of the beds that was by the bathroom. Draco nodded. “So you can hog the bathroom first, I reckon.” Harry teased and sat down. He saw the jar that Harry had given him that day in the bathroom almost empty. “Draco, how many times have you used this?” He asked, picking up the jar and looking at it.
“Shut up, your gelled hair reminds me of your father,” Harry rolled his eyes. “What if I accidentally called you Lucius?”
Looking around, he nodded slowly when he noticed Draco was nowhere in sight. After making sure everyone was gone, they both quickly slipped into a broom closet. “Um… why do you need to talk to me?” he asked finally. He couldn’t recall a time where he and Pansy had ever even spoken properly, but what he knew was that she wasn’t the type to insult or be rude to him.
“Join the Death Eaters,” Harry told Draco, realizing there was no time and no point in explaining anything to Ron at that moment. “At least make it
“I wasn’t even there for most of the party… fuck, how much did I drink?” Harry said with a slight groan. “Had to have been a bottle or two… How about you, Ron?”
“Maybe I ought to make you drink a Wit-Sharpening potion,” Draco scoffed, then clicked his tongue. “Ah, wait. There wouldn’t be anything to sharpen.”
“How are you, darling?” he asked. “It’s our first time hanging out in two weeks.” he then added quietly, “not as if we’ve spoken about it before that too.”
“Hold on, some girl was trying to get you to fall in love with her? This is why you don’t accept chocolates from just anyone. And I suppose you were going to eat them yourself?”
“You understand what this concerns, don’t you, Mr. Potter?” Umbridge asked, and Harry wondered if she was purposely speaking fast so he wouldn’t be able to read her lips. He looked over to Hermione, who started to translate for him through sign language. “None of that will be necessary, Ms. Granger. Who knows what sort of lies you two might be cultivating?”
“No, no… I think I’ll stay here. Figure out what I want to do with my life,” he said, struggling to maintain eye contact. “When are you leaving?”
“Thank you.” Draco sat down beside Harry, taking his hands slowly and holding them tightly. “You know I don’t want to do this.”
After dinner, gifts were exchanged. Harry gave Hermione yet another book, and Hermione gave Harry a watch. Harry gave Ron a lot of food, and Ron gave Harry a music box saying it was so cool how Muggles could make things like that. Draco gave Hermione a book too, and Ron a Muggle pen. Hermione gave Draco a fairytale book, and Ron gave Draco a scarf.
As Harry, Hermione and Ron dissolved into a silent conversation through sign language, Draco walked over to stand beside Pansy, frowning. She took his hand and squeezed it gently, trying to give him a reassuring look.
She looked at him, then nodded, taking his hands and holding them tightly for a moment. “...I suppose you’re right. Let’s talk about something else.”
Eyebrows creased, he gulped. “No,” he answered. “I mean… they’ve been trying to convince me, but… I’m not really…”
“Yeah, got it,” he nodded, quickly stepping away from Harry at what was now considered their usual distance. “Um, is that better?”
“Are you sure? I’m sorry, I’ve just been talking about myself, haven’t I. What’s up with you?” Harry asked. “Any Death Eater work I can help out with?” he joked.
Harry had been staring at Draco’s lips, yet not a word had registered in his brain. He reached forward and used his index finger to gently trace over the blonde’s lips, smiling slightly to himself. “I’m deaf, of course I can’t listen,” he said.
“But someone likes you,” Ron raised an eyebrow. “If I were you I’d have gone mental trying to figure out who it is.”
Shrugging on a sweater, Harry followed him outside to the Common Room, where Hermione and Ginny were conversing. The two looked up at him inquisitively. “You’re coming?” Hermione signed. He quickly signed back ‘yes’.
“Get out,” Draco demanded. The tears were still falling down his face, the hand he was holding his wand with shaking.
“Harry!” Hermione called from the living room, grinning. She walked up to Harry and hugged him tightly, grinning at him, before slowly turning to Draco. The two stared at each other awkwardly. Hermione finally pulled him into an awkward, quick hug, before quickly pulling away as soon as possible.
She stared at him for a moment, then smacked the back of his head. “I get it. Your family doesn’t like him. But why should you let that determine how you feel about him hmm? Since when are you a follower?”
“Okay, that was probably the lamest thing I’ve ever said,” Draco, panicked, picked up the WSL book. “Let’s just get on with the lesson? If you’re planning to actually teach me something this week, that is.”
Ron nodded. “You’re really brave, you know. I wouldn’t have been able to handle all of this,” he said while signing the same thing. Although their signing wasn’t as good as his, he was still grateful that they had been willing to learn - most of the Weasleys now knew basic sign language, too.
Harry, still a bit disoriented, opened the letter, realizing it was from Dumbledore, asking him to meet him in his office immediately. He stood up, his senses coming back to him suddenly.
“Care to lead, then, abled-hearing person?” he asked, and this time, Draco laughed out loud as he switched the placement of their arms so he was now leading. This seemed more comfortable for the two, even though Harry had originally learnt how to lead. It was surprising to him how gracefully Draco moved, as if it came to him naturally. He was even smiling now, letting himself get lost in the dance. Even the arms around Harry’s waist felt in place and not uncomfortable.
“I feel like you’re worrying for me too much and not letting me breathe,” he responded. “I get it. I’m deaf. But please don’t treat me any differently. You know I hate feeling like an outcast.”
Harry found himself during his free period running to the Hospital Wing. Harry couldn’t help himself. He saw that Draco was asleep. He sat down on the chair beside the bed, slowly reaching and taking Draco’s hand, clutching it tightly. Harry studied him as he slept, breathing heavily.
“Why didn’t you throw away the bracelet?” he asked. Harry felt Draco’s hand against his head slow down.
“I’ve been trying to use this book, but it’s not really helping. I mean, you saw me trying to sign ‘sorry’. I can’t do it,” he sighed. “I understand if you don’t want to help me. After everything you and me have been through, I think it’s actually expected. But… please think about it?”
“Draco?” said a familiar voice. He looked up, surprised to see Molly Weasley in front of him, smiling. “My God, I haven’t seen you since the wedding!” she put her arms out, and he laughed nervously, standing up. She pulled him into a warm hug, which he didn’t realize he had needed until she pulled away.
Harry had given Draco his first ever hickey. The two acknowledged it but simply continued on kissing heatedly. Then, Draco gave Harry
“Oh, Draco, you’re here!” Molly grinned. “Oh, and you brought gifts! Ron, why don’t you direct him to the Christmas tree?”
“You’re ridiculous, you know that?” he laughed. “And stop making fun of me! I spend time on those poems!”
“Mind you, we’re supposed to be studying right now too,” he pointed out. Harry simply smiled, leaning forward and kissing him, shutting his eyes. Draco ran his hands up and down his back, subtly lowering down to his ass. “I said studying, Harry.”
“Don’t, Harry, because then I’ll tell you everything. And if he finds out, you know how ugly things would get. I can’t let anyone down with this. Especially my father.”
“Yes,” he nodded, gulping nervously as he shut the door behind him. “I’m so sorry, Mother. I was selfish. Our last conversation… I don’t want you to remember my voice like that. I was out of line.”
But before Harry or Draco could register it, Hermione swung the door open and saw the two making out on Harry’s bed.
“I was really looking forward to just making out this study session,” He muttered, “but you procrastinating git…”
“Know what, exactly?” An icy, stony voice spoke from behind all three of them. Harry noticed that Narcissa’s smile faded, only to be quickly replaced with a different sort of smile as she turned to face her husband. Harry awkwardly cleared his throat as Draco finally spoke up.
“And they’ve given us so much homework that I want to jump off of the Astronomy Tower,” Harry muttered, “I hate my life!”
Harry didn’t recall hearing anyone calling him earlier in the day. But then again, he wasn’t exactly paying attention to what was around him.
“Such as?” Draco asked, an eyebrow raised as Harry slowly sat down on his lap, facing him. Harry’s green eyes sparkled with an emotion that Draco couldn’t identify - but he sure as hell could feel it. “You’re seriously-”
Harry slowly leaned forward and Draco did the same. Before they knew it, their lips were locked, roughly and with lust. Soon enough, their tongues were dancing. Draco pushed Harry against the door and kissed him passionately and roughly.
“This is awful,” he nuzzled his head into Draco’s shoulder. And then, finally, he said, “things are going to change this summer.”
He thought of the time they had together so far - he wouldn’t trade it for anything else. It was refreshing to be around Draco; not only because of his honesty, but his fresh perspective on things. Harry had only ever known to think in a certain way, and his friends would usually agree with him. Draco would challenge him, give him a different way to think about it. Most of all, he was the only real love he’d ever known. He had friends, sure, and a lot of people that cared about him, however, being Harry Potter came with a lot of expectations and responsibilities, that all seemed to fade when he was with Draco.
The only way Harry knew this was because he found himself trying not to have tears down his face too.
Draco shot a glare at Harry when he noticed he was staring. Harry, however, didn’t look away. He watched Draco as he sat down at the Slytherin table.
Draco simply lifted his arm to show his watch. “I missed you too. Happy birthday, darling,” he spoke softly while signing, but Harry simply pushed him back until they were on his bed. “It’s midnight and you’re so energized?”
Draco didn’t respond to that, only shrugged and put on his sweater, and turned to face Pansy. His face was pink.
“Calm down, Draco! It’s a phone.” Harry gently took the phone from his hands and started to set everything up for him, carefully explaining the process on the way. After it was done, Harry handed it to him. “Here. Now, press down on this button. This is called the Home Button. You can use it for exiting apps- applications and stuff like that.”
“Not really,” he said quietly, but with the way she looked at him, he could tell she knew he was lying. “Have they found any trace of Potter?”
He sighed, opening the door for her to enter. She shut the door behind them, frowning. “What’s wrong?”
Harry stood up, moving closer to Draco. “If this was two years ago. Hell, even if it was three years ago, I wouldn’t have doubted this, you - us - even for a second. But… not anymore. Haven’t we pushed this far enough? Haven’t we… tried hard enough? If we were really meant to be together, something would’ve given us a sign.”
“Draco?” Harry questioned when he noticed the silver-eyed boy standing outside of the kitchen, who grabbed the other’s hand and dragged him into his room. “Wait, you heard what happened?”
He’d make it to some random Muggle’s place, then leave before the sun came out. This had been his routine for so long. Most of the times he’d end up ditching the person before they even did anything.
His eyes widened slightly. “Friends? I didn’t think you two were that close,” he commented. Harry watched him as he continued to write, mildly disgusted.
His green eyes twinkled. “You know me better than that, love. Of course I blame myself. I always do.”
“I’m sorry. It sounds like there’s a lot more to that,” he answered, squeezing Draco’s thigh. “But…”
“Draco, it’s scorching,” she stated, but her expression softened when she noticed the look on his face. “Anyway, did you read the Daily Prophet?”
There was a pause, as if Draco was thinking of the right words to say. Now that he was here, in this moment, it was much harder to push him away. Maybe it was the way Harry looked like his heart was breaking, or maybe because he looked close to tears. Or maybe it was because Draco had never felt so strongly for someone before, and didn’t want to push away someone who made him want to be a better person.
Harry jumped at the chance to catch Draco’s eye from across the hallway, but all he got in return was blank, silver eyes looking right through him. Harry would try sitting right across from Draco at the Eighth Year table, but couldn’t get through to him.
He reached the couch and sat on the ground just in front of Draco’s face, who rolled his eyes. “I’m going to meet my relative tomorrow, dumbass. I need to make sure I know everything.”
“Anyway…” Harry said, seeming as if he didn’t notice Pancy’s yelp. “It’s seriously been three years since your wedding, huh? I’m surprised you two aren’t sick of each other.”
Hours later, in his dorm, Draco stared down at the box, wondering what it could possibly be. He was almost afraid to open it. With trembling hands, he opened the blue velvet box. Inside was a small piece of paper and a bracelet with two charms. One was a silver bird and the other was a music note.
“Since your first rant about Harry Potter. That’s sort of a dead giveaway,” she said, chuckling. “But take your time figuring things out. And I’m always with you, no matter what.”
“Well, there was less malice, but we were worse,” he replied, but inhaled sharply. “I was really hoping things would be better with me and your friends, though. I mean, it’s a poor choice of friends, but-”
“I accepted him when he couldn’t accept himself,” Harry started, then shook his head. “Why are you here? I don’t need you to get me a tub of ice cream or something. He’s moved on, and I’m… getting there.”
After a while of idle chatter, it was time for dinner. Ron and Hermione sat beside each other at one corner, and Draco and Pansy sat across. Beside Hermione was Luna. But there was a seat free beside Draco, which was at the corner of the table.
“Nope,” Harry replied with a grin, swinging their hands back and forth as they walked. “I’m surprised no one’s out here. I thought that we’d have to use my Invisibility Cloak till we got deep into the forest.”
“I’ll just go check on Ginny and her baking,” Molly said, smiling, standing up and quickly leaving the room. Surely it wasn’t bad enough that she wanted to leave, was it? Who was Harry kidding - the atmosphere was so tense that he wasn’t sure if he wanted to make out with Draco or slap him in the face.
He continued to walk, holding the tears of frustration back until he reached his dorm, collapsing on the bed at once, not bothering to take his shoes off or changing into more comfortable clothes.
“My father, he… he didn’t want us to be together, so… he placed a curse on me. On the both of us, actually. If we’re too close to each other, you will get severely injured.”
“I wish,” Draco sighed, “but Pansy, Blaise and me are going to Hogsmeade tomorrow. Besides, we’ve spent two days together already.”
“On the other hand…” she repeated, “Draco clearly doesn’t want to follow the rest of his family’s footsteps, and it’s not as if he’s ever done anything in the past few months to cause distrust. You both knew what you were getting into and even had a month to test it out. Why is this an issue now?”
“We will be brewing the Draught of Peace today,” Snape announced. “I expect you all to know the ingredients already, as we covered it last lesson. Get into pairs before I do it myself.”
“Uh,  yeah, just… fuck,” he said, grateful for Ron who had already grabbed him and was holding him up. “Sorry, it’s just a headache.”
“Yeah, hopefully I’m still pronouncing the spells properly,” he said. Ginny watched him with uncertainty in her eyes, but didn’t say anything in response. As they entered the Three Broomsticks, Harry looked around, his eye catching Draco’s, who was sitting with Pansy and Blaise.
“You’re still a bit disoriented. Just gather yourself for a moment,” he said gently, concern written all over his face. He sat on the bed just beside Harry, stroking his hair softly as they sat in silence. Draco looked down at Harry’s trembling hands, but didn’t say anything,
“Because I knew if I left it up to you, you would never talk to him about it. You would just avoid it and never give him an explanation,” she sighed. “Other than that...I hoped you two would have been able to sort things out.”
Harry sat in Charms class, staring at the board, rather confused. They were learning a new spell, but he was unable to understand how to pronounce it. He looked over to Ron and Hermione beside who were casting the spell perfectly, too embarrassed to ask them anything yet again.
“Harry, I have my own bank account, if you haven’t realized. I’ll pay you back for it, alright? Besides, they don’t care.”
Harry sat on the floor of his room. He literally felt that there was no point of staying at Hogwarts if he didn’t get to see Draco - one of the main reasons he wanted to come back to Hogwarts was because of him. Harry ran a hand through his hair, slowly standing up.
Harry tried not to smile, unsure if Draco was aware that he had been running his hand up and down his arm reassuringly. He looked around the room. The walls that were initially grey were now white; the small bookshelf was now big enough to be called a library, the couch had a blanket, and there was a window by the table.
“Okay, that was…” Harry said as he re-entered the room, Draco behind. They had just cut the cake for Luna, quickly eaten, then excused themselves, one to the bathroom and the other complaining that his head was still hurting. The two stared at each other as he shut the door behind them, locking it quickly. “Did we… break the curse there for a second?”
As it turned out, Draco used his charms to somehow convince Harry to come to Christmas dinner on the 26th, the Second Day of Christmas. But first, they had to go through a Christmas dinner with the Weasleys.
Harry parted ways with Ron and Hermione, going to sit in the front of the class, joining Draco who was already seated.
“Potter, this sounds weird, but you need to center yourself, especially for someone who’s doubting their magical abilities.”
“They say a good way to relieve stress is to dance,” he said, leading Draco to the open space near the tables. “So I think we should dance.”
Staggering, he made his way down the hallway, insisting that Molly leave at the entrance, telling her he was fine.
“I only did what I thought was right,” Draco raised his voice as well, growing angrier by the minute. “You should be thankful!”
Draco was still smiling, though. Draco gave Harry a quick kiss on the lips before settling down on the couch and resting his head on his lap. Harry pulled out a blanket from his back and put it over Draco.
Draco didn’t have to explain that he was feeling frustrated. He’d spend most of his time reading or catching up on homework. With everything going on, he found himself barely catching up with schoolwork. It wasn’t only that, he barely even had the motivation to do anything about it.
Harry burst out laughing, but quickly jumped up and moved away when Draco got out his wand. After being chased around for a few moments, they both turned as the door burst open.
“Calm down, Hermione,” Ron said with a slight laugh. Hermione raised an eyebrow offendedly, turning to face Ron, who took a step back, “Only joking. You don’t need to calm down, because you are calm…”
Harry’s insides lurched. And they lurched, and they lurched until a dark feeling dawned inside his chest.
lying. If you can’t accept that, please whine about it to someone who actually cares. Seriously, learning sign language? You’re such a pathetic git.”
***EDIT: I CHANGED HARRY’S ANSWER PLEASE REREAD THE PROPOSAL SCENE IF YOU READ IT BEFORE! I decided things were moving too fast so they’re gonna take some time***
“I’m not particularly satisfied that my first kiss was my dead-friend’s-ex-girlfriend who also happened to be
“You fucking prat!” He yelled, putting it his sweater back on and glaring at Harry who was still laughing uncontrollably.
boyfriend, if you say whatever you’re going to, I can keep my mouth shut? I have an obligation to protect the people around me. So as long as you don’t say it, we’re both safe. Otherwise… it’ll be on me. On my conscience.”
“So, Mr. Malfoy, what exactly are your intentions with Harry?” Arthur said after about five minutes of silence. Hermione and Harry exchanged glances, and an awkward, red-faced Draco wished he could literally be in Azkaban than having this conversation. George and Charlie tried not to laugh.
A couple - or a dozen - drinks later, Draco was, needless to say, drunk. Molly found it quite funny, because he was starting to be overly honest about everything, and practically rambling about useless things, such as the music or the people around them.
An hour passed and though he was trying to get on with his work, all he felt was humiliation. They had barely been friends for two weeks and it was already messed up. Was it impossible for the two of them to have a normal relationship- friendship? Sighing, Harry stood up, shutting his books and dumping them into his bag. This was too depressing. Perhaps he had misread the proximity of their friendship.
A week passed. Draco ignored Harry’s presence, didn’t send any more poems, and nor did he show up on Friday. Harry, too humiliated, had only waited for fifteen minutes this time. Did Draco really just play with his feelings? But the poems he had sent in the holidays sounded so genuine…
what you choose to respond to? For fuck’s sake,” she shook her head, then frowned when she noticed his expression. “Come on, Dray. We can go somewhere else if you want… hey, there’s your lover!”
“I know, I just… yeah, I like the bracelet okay? It’s not as if… this is the first time I’ve received a meaningful gift or anything,” he replied, wiping his hand against the towel. “We should get back.”
“It’s too much, really,” Draco answered, sitting down opposite Harry at the table. “I got us some food from the Three Broomsticks.”
After a long kiss, they pulled apart and Harry slowly got off Draco and then they slipped out of the closet one by one after the bell rung.
Draco didn’t speak, and nor did Harry, who seemed like he was trying to figure out what exactly it was he wanted to say.
Harry didn’t remember most of what happened, just a few moments of the beginning of his conversation with Draco. He didn’t remember how he got into bed, or what happened before that. And additional to the pounding headache, Harry’s scar was burning slightly and his chest felt queasy. He slowly got up, exiting the dorm and slowly walking down the hallway to Draco’s dorm, knocking on the door lightly. Though it was ten in the morning, no one was awake - everyone was probably hungover from the party.
Draco, who looked up only after a few moments, almost fell over when he saw Harry peacefully sitting beside him. Snape, who noticed immediately, walked over to the table and cleared his throat loudly.
“Has he woken up yet, at least?” Harry asked, his eyes moving to the direction where Draco was, hidden behind the curtains. His voice was filled with worry, his eyes glinting with guilt.
She stared at him, watching as he made his way to the kitchen, opening the fridge and getting some leftovers out.
“You know what I think, Draco?” Harry said against Draco’s lips. “I think you secretly wanted the sappy romantic things.”
“I don’t think I forget if I wanted to,” he said, leaning closer to Draco again. “...could we try doing that again sometime, if you enjoyed it? Because I know I certainly did.”
“No. Right now, you need to worry about your own safety. So you’re Voldemort’s follower first, and my boyfriend second,” Harry said somewhat sternly. “I can’t have him hurt you if he finds out. So don’t do anything to slip up now, not after we’ve been able to hide it so well.”
“Just… wanted to know how you were feeling,” Draco muttered, unsure of what to say now that he was actually alone with him.
What was frustrating wasn’t Blaise’s stupid remarks, it was that he was right. How was Harry going to defend himself through everything? He still had three years of education left. He was nowhere near ready to fight Voldemort.
Draco shrieked once again, “WHO THE FUCK IS THAT IN MY PHONE, HARRY? YOU CAN TRAP PEOPLE IN THIS DEVICE? I DON’T WANT IT! GET IT AWAY FROM ME!”
After dinner, Harry went to his dorm and changed out of his uniform, then grabbed his things and left for the Room of Requirement. They had spent the last lesson on Friday quietly. Surprisingly, Draco had recognized Harry needed his space, and rather than a lesson, they had more of a study session. Except the kind where they kept stealing glances at each other while trying to study.
Every time Draco and Harry locked eyes, the streaks in their hair would glisten. Neither of them ever noticed, and neither did they care about it. The two were just glad to be able to be together again.
“So… you throw my hearing aids into the lake. I earn three weeks in detention because of you. Then when I finally think I’m ready to move on from it, you ask me to teach you sign language for a relative you say you don’t even care about, then… then you get mad I kiss a girl, and then you kiss me yourself. You send me these poems that make me blush and smile, and now you won’t even look at my face. If that’s not avoiding me, then I don’t know what is.”
He stood up slightly, leaning forward and smacking Harry lightly with his book, trying to hold back a smile. “I know,” he sat back down. “Here,” he handed Harry the quill. “Writing helps you remember better. Write down the ingredients needed at least five times.”
“You don’t have to be so careful. At this rate, we might have to start shouting to be able to hear each other,” Harry snorted.
“Draco… you shouldn’t have lashed out like that to your father.” Narcissa said with a sigh. “He’s not too happy. I know you’re upset that you can’t leave this place, but…”
“Just go away,” Draco snapped. “You would never understand. You won’t be able to help.” Draco clenched his jaw, looking away from Harry, clenching his fists as he tried to ease his anger; his frustration; his feelings. “You weren’t raised by abusive people.”
“So, Harry, are you really just friends with Draco? Because well… I saw you kissing, and being friends with benefits really isn’t a good idea, not that I’m speaking from experience, I just had a friend-”
“You’re right. We have time for that later,” Draco replied, sitting down beside Harry. “But… I’m not sure if our rules make any sense anymore. Are we sticking to them?”
He quickly turned when the door opened, revealing Harry, who slammed the door shut. However he stayed there for a moment, trying to catch his breath. “Sorry I’m late,” he said finally.
Harry thought he did something wrong. Draco turned around. His eyes were glinting with tears, but he was smiling so wide that he looked like the happiest person alive.
Harry pushed his curls out of his eyes, pulling up his trousers, smiling at everyone, eyes almost sliding past Draco, who was looking over at Pansy. Almost. His eyes stopped searching the room. They finally stopped searching the room for the silver eyes, for the smile - for the touch. The person who made him feel like home was here.
“Oh, don’t worry about it, dear,” she smiled, but there was pain behind those eyes, and Harry knew she would never be the same again after Fred’s death. “Come in, come in!” She shut the door after him, and he placed all of his gifts under the tree, smiling as he sat down beside Ron and Hermione.
“You can understand me, right?” she asked, making sure to enunciate. Harry nodded, and she smiled. “Right, so… Draco wants to see you. At six.”
“Oh, yeah, I do. It’s in fifteen minutes.” Harry lied smoothly. Hermione, who was staring at Harry, opened her mouth to speak. Harry gave her a pleading look to not say anything.
“Oh, well, you just ran out on me this afternoon, and you didn’t show up for dinner, and I didn’t find you in the Marauder’s Map, and-”
“I think he mentioned something about meaning to give it to Dumbledore or something, but that isn’t important, what’s important is-” Harry went on a long rant, but Draco’s ears were suddenly closed. He knew immediately what the drink was. Breaking eye contact from Harry, he looked down at his feet, guilt and resentment hitting his chest.
“My God!” Harry cried out in annoyance. “Why does it matter to you if I do or not? Do you like Cho?”
, no. Come, sit with me. I want to talk to you. Your father just left for some work, so this is the best time,” she said, yet she still seemed on edge, looking at the door every few moments.
of your meddling, sick of your sympathetic smiles, sick of you treading carefully around me. Do you know why I left? Because I knew if I stayed, you would continue to treat me like I’m made of glass, and that wouldn’t help at all,” he felt tears threaten to fall, but bit it back.
“Okay, this is where we part ways,” Draco said, pushing his hair out of his eyes. “Get home safely.”
“Of course. It’s not like I like facing Voldemort every year, you know.” Harry said with a small smile.
“Ah, fuck,” he nodded, putting a hand to his head. “Alright. By the way, did you hear anything about Harry coming back to England?”
“Fuck right off, Hermione,” he rolled his eyes, folding his arms. “Wow. Okay, um, cool. I’ll… see you guys later.”
Harry pushed his hair back which revealed his white roots at the specific strands again. Usually, nobody noticed the white bits, but Snape did. He saw. The white strands in Harry’s hair were almost halfway to the ends of his hair. A few seconds later, Snape noticed how Draco too seemed to have a weird shade of brown in his hair.
Draco’s hand - hesitantly and carefully - trailed down Harry’s face. He kissed Harry’s neck. “I’m everywhere,” he whispered. He kissed his arms, his fingers, his palms, his chest, down to his stomach. “I’m always with you.”
“If you couldn’t trust me,” Draco whispered, trying to keep his voice steady, “why did you lie to me?”
of course,” Pansy said with a shrug, sitting down on Draco’s bed and grinning. “Anyways, I know you’ve been avoiding me since Saturday. Did the date not go well?”
Harry was surprised. “What? Why? We’ve been spending every Saturday like this! I haven’t spent a single Saturday on my own for the past three months!”
“It’s okay if you’re nervous. I know a few boys in Slytherin who would be interested, you know. Do you want me to hook you up?”
“I’m shaking,” Harry mocked, then looked up to see the crowd that had formed. Before the other could retaliate, Professor McGonagall had shown up, practically screaming for everyone to make their way to their classes.
, they’re still your friends and I’d like to be in a room with them without either of us having to be at each other’s throats. I mean, hey, I didn’t say anything until she started being all vicious.”
“Mistletoe,” she pointed towards the ceiling. The two looked up, and surely enough, there was a mistletoe. And before he knew it, her wet lips were on him, and all he could do was stand there in awe. And while he kissed her back, he couldn’t help but realize how wrong it felt.
Harry pulled Draco into a hug. Draco hugged him right back as if he had been aching to hug Harry all this while.
“I saw you fainting. I saw as you fell down, as you were escorted to the hospital wing, how you were out for a week. You… how could you even do that to yourself? Do you have any idea how worried everyone was? Especially me, because I had no way of finding out how you were.”
Harry looked up at her. “This might be a huge waste of money…” he said, carefully opening it and taking out the hearing aids, hand trembling slightly.
“...Don’t make me regret it,” He said. “I still don’t forgive you, by the way. But I’m not vile enough to not help you out for something like this.”
“Yes, of course,” Draco said, turning and leaving. He made his way to his parents’ wing of the mansion, walking down the cold, empty hallways. He almost couldn’t believe that just a day ago him and Harry were kissing. “Mother, how are you feeling?” he signed as he entered. She looked up, eyes widening.
All Draco felt was pain. Seeing him kissing someone else. Seeing someone else’s arms around his body, seeing someone else staring at him the way he should have been. All Draco could think was how he was the one who should have been kissing Harry, having his arms around Harry. Draco walked all the way to the empty bathroom.
“How narcissistic,” he scoffed, folding his arms. “You want the truth? No, I wouldn’t have. I would have worked until I found a way to break the curse. But you didn’t even give that a chance. You didn’t give
“Do what? Come on, Harry, you know you want to.” Draco was taunting Harry now. He was feeling so infuriated with himself and Harry as well.
“Mate, you call your other Saturdays interesting? For the past three months, you’ve been ditching ‘Mione and me to go study. You call that interesting?” Ron asked with a raised eyebrow. Hermione gave Harry a look as if to say ‘wow, that’s the best you can come up with?’.
“Really, Potter? Here again?” Draco asked as they made their way by the lake and sat down under the tree. “It’s freezing.”
His heart sank as Astoria emerged, walking down the aisle slowly as the music played. “Oh, fuck,” he whispered. As she finally reached him, she nodded in sympathy, because this was it. This was the end to whatever Draco and Harry were, if they even were anything anymore.
“Harry, come play Truth or Dare with us!” Ron called out as Harry entered the Eighth Year Common Room. He looked up, seeing Draco sitting in the corner, reading a book, his white hair falling into his eyes - and suddenly, he looked up. Harry quickly looked down at his feet.
“Hey, guys, do you hear that buzzing?” Luna asked in her casual dreamy voice, smiling slightly. “I think it could be the Nargles.”
“Draco,” she took his hands carefully. “I’m trying my best to protect you, alright? I know this is hardly what you want, that’s why I think it’s best if you go back to Hogwarts. It’s just your last year.”
“No, it’s fine, really. At least my own damn parents wouldn’t be abusive towards me,” Harry muttered before he could stop himself, turning away and exiting the library as quickly as he could.
He felt a warm tingle in his chest as he stood up, blinking in confusion, turning to Astoria, who had just entered the room.
“I can’t help but think it’s both of them,” he said, grabbing his notebook. “Right, I’ll get to it, then. Stupid wit-sharpening potion.”
Harry was crying. He had taken off his glasses and thrown it to the side. Hot tears escaped his eyes, as he buried his face in his hands, trying to get it to stop. Hoping everything would just stop.
Draco just smiled in return. “Okay, so there are two more here. I thought you might like the simple colors: green, black and red.” Draco explained. Harry was wearing the black set currently. “The green and red one don’t have my initials, so it might be better if you wear those. Don’t want your nosy friends asking questions. Well since Granger already knows you can tell her.” Draco was talking very quickly. He seemed to be very into what he was saying. Harry was listening to every word carefully. The two sat down on Harry’s bed, where the box currently was. They both turned to face the box as Draco continued speaking.
“...it’s fine, I’ll help you,” the blond said finally, walking over and sitting beside him. “It was an essay on the stupid potion we mucked up… er… Draught of Peace, was it? Yeah, that. He set that last week, you know.”
“...doesn’t matter who I was staring at,” he corrected himself before they could notice. “I don’t like her anymore. Not sure if I ever liked her, actually…”
Draco awkwardly cleared his throat, swallowing the food that he was chewing, “Er, yes. I’ve been staying somewhere else,” Draco stated, “I’m quite surprised you noticed that your son hasn’t been staying here.” He mumbled to himself sarcastically. Draco realized that he had said it a bit too loud. Lucius decided to ignore what Draco had said.
“So, what were you guys up to?” Pansy asked with a wink, breaking the silence. Hermione and Ron facepalmed.
Draco gulped. “I’m glad you like it,” he said, his expression somewhat panicked, unsure of what to do.
Harry slowly stepped closer to Draco. “You do realize, that if you had just told me from the beginning, everything would have been okay?”
“No, I… I was wondering how you were doing,” he looked down as he spoke, playing with the sleeves of his jumper. “I didn’t get a poem from you today and yesterday, so…”
He chewed his lip, then nodded. “Okay, I guess it wouldn’t hurt to try. But you can’t be short with me. I’m going to be slow.”
“Harry, go and wake Severus,” Dumbledore ordered faintly. “Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do not remove your Cloak.”
He shrugged, unsure of what Draco could even do. The worst had already happened to him. It would be hard to top.
“Hey…” Luna said as she entered, eyebrows knitted. “I sense a lot of tense energy in this room. Do you know why Draco and Pansy are just standing outside in the hallway?”
Sometime in January, Draco was writing what may have been his thirtieth letter. He had forced himself to stop during October and November and started again on the first of January.
“Maybe he’s turning a new leaf,” Harry shrugged. “I don’t suppose you expected him to stay the same forever.”
“It is, isn’t it?” she asked, suddenly getting excited, clapping her hands together. “That’s so cute! Is he your ‘study buddy’ then?”
“Calm down, you two,” Ron said, stepping in between them. “Harry, the important thing is, do you regret saying no to him?”
“Um… there’s a club,” he lied quickly. “You know, since Potter is deaf. I suppose they’re trying to be more inclusive.”
“Well, my only friend right now is Pansy, and she’s more interested in having her tongue in some guy’s mouth, so I think I’m alright,” he replied without looking up, biting at his thumb as he stared down at the textbook.
As Harry, Ron and Hermione, made their way to their next class, she seemed rather upset. “You know, you could’ve asked us how to pronounce the spell,” she said as they walked.
“Harry!” Draco whined with an eye roll as he balanced himself and wrapped his arms around Harry so he wouldn’t fall. “Give me a warning next time!”
“By the way,” the blond said, and Harry could feel a banter coming up. “You’re the one who rejected my handshake, so really, who declared who sworn enemies?”
“What? No?” Harry shook his head, thinking back to their previous class, which was potions. He had been staring at Draco most of the time. Now that he thought about it, Cho was actually in his line of vision. “Ohh, I wasn’t staring at
“This last summer break… well, it was horrible, Harry.” Draco said slowly. “They made me go looking for you, at the Grimmauld Place. I went to the door but didn’t go inside. I stayed there for a good twenty minutes before going back and saying that you weren’t there.”
But instead, in a moment of weakness, he closed his eyes and pretended that the person he was kissing was someone else, and not Ginny Weasley.
The two spent Draco’s wedding day very differently, but if there was one thing that was similar, it was the empty feeling in both of their chests, knowing that it was now there to stay.
“Well, yes. I study with Luna sometimes and she always makes things interesting. Sometimes she takes me to the Ravenclaw door and I try to figure out the answer to the question the door asks.” Harry lied smoothly. “Really tricky riddles, honestly. It’s fun, but I never get the answer right of course.”
“I would, if you stop being a brat,” Harry grabbed the WSL book from his hands, flipping through the pages. “Alright, so I’m guessing you’d probably want to talk about Hogwarts to your relative. I’m still pretty rusty on signing the terms, but I think you ought to learn it. You might as well go all in rather than just learn random bits of the language. Who knows, maybe you’ll encounter more deaf wizards in the future.”
So, if you're somehow still here and reading this, do you have any ideas of what I could make the title? 'He was Never the Enemy' was anyways just supposed to be a temporary title, but I never got around to changing it.
“I guess you heard-” Harry stopped, but so did Draco, so he decided to speak. “You know, when I had imagined meeting your father again, I didn’t think it would be like that. Not nearly. Though, I did expect violence. Like… I don’t know, food being thrown at me.”
“Calm down, it doesn’t matter. So we got the potion off of Ron and then Slughorn gave us this drink, I don’t really know what it was. But he gave it to us and he started making a toast but by then Ron had already taken a sip and,” Harry had been talking so fast that he stopped to take a breath, “Ron was poisoned. He literally almost died!”
Harry looked over to Pansy, who met his gaze, shrugging in confusion, then nodding her head in the direction that Draco had gone. He nodded slightly, then turned and looked down at Hermione.
“Yeah, but nothing quite like the one on Monday,” Harry said, reaching into his pocket and taking it out. Draco felt his heart race, heat flushing his cheeks. “That one was…”
Harry didn’t reply, simply stuffed his face with food so he wouldn’t have to answer. Hermione rolled her eyes, but sympathetically put a hand on his shoulder, squeezing it gently.
“So sorry, Professor Snape. The medicine Madame Pomfrey gave him makes him a little forgetful… and a bit dazed.” Hermione explained, grabbing Harry’s textbook from the table, making direct eye contact with Draco.
Harry had woken up later than Ron for once, and the first thing he did was reach for the letter sitting on his bedside table - someone must have taken the letter from Hedwig, who was now sitting perched at the window.
“So, that’s it? The first time I see you smile in months; genuinely smile, and you’re letting go of him already?”
“You’re a dickhead, you know,” he said before he could stop himself, earning a questioning glance from Pansy.
“Sorry, shouldn’t have joked about that,” Harry said, immediately sensing how he had stepped over a line, looking down at his feet awkwardly.
“Sure, mate, see you there.” Ron and the others left, and Harry walked out to the field, walking to the middle, to see Ginny standing there, still in her Quidditch uniform, the Snitch in her hand.
“I thought you said Nargles live in mistletoes?” Harry asked after everyone stared at her for a few seconds. Pansy rolled her eyes and grabbed the waffle from Harry’s hand, biting into it. “Hey! That was ours!”
“Right. And you aren’t throwing bricks at me yet?” Harry asked, turning to face Draco, slowly taking his hand and holding it again.
“You asked,” the blond responded, holding up the note. He sat down beside the other. Harry put a tentative hand to his wounded cheek. Draco flinched slightly, but let him touch it, unable to look at him.
Harry entered the Great Hall on Saturday morning, practically slamming his textbook on the table. Hermione and Ron exchanged glances, but didn’t say anything.
“Well, yes, but… but it wasn’t… I thought he would… I didn’t…” Harry, at an utter loss for words, slowly walked into the hallway, where Draco had just been moments ago, lightly knocking on the door. “Draco?”
The silver-eyed boy stepped towards the sink, gathering some water in his hand and rubbing it over the spot in Harry’s hair. “It’s easier if I do it,” he said when he noticed Harry staring at him, wide-eyed.
p.s 2: I just realized it might be a bit unclear in the chapter: Harry does not actually send the letter to Draco.
“Why do you want to meet me here?” Draco asked as Harry looked around his dorm. It screamed Slytherin; everything was either green or black.
“Harry, they’d have to pry my dead hands off of you,” he answered, hoping that’s what Harry wanted to hear. To his surprise, the Gryffindor looked up at him and grinned. “Now, onto more positive things, alright?"
Yet he couldn’t focus. All he could think about how he couldn’t mess up, not this time. No one was going to die for him. Not Hermione, not Ron, Neville, Ginny, Luna, anyone. He couldn’t let it happen, not again.
It was a bright, peaceful spring Sunday afternoon. The days were now longer but the nights were harder. Astoria had moved into Malfoy Manor, but would sleep in her ‘study’ which had a twin bed and a desk to work on. Lucius did not question it. It seemed now that the marriage was sealed, he had no problem with the obvious fact that Astoria and Draco did not love each other.
“Hey, guys,” Pansy said, hugging Hermione and Ron in turn. Astoria hugged them too, but it was a little awkward. When it was Draco’s turn, he stood awkwardly until Hermione hugged him tightly.
And while he hadn’t even said yes, the two shared a smile before parting ways, because they felt alive again.
Glancing up, Harry frowned. “I’m okay. I think. I don’t know. I suppose my feelings are really not taken into consideration anymore,” he shrugged.
“I’d prefer not to,” he sighed. He couldn’t stand the thoughts of the empty hallways without Harry. The dark atmosphere. The Room of Requirement. Spending Friday evenings and weekends without spending time with him at all. It would only hurt more. “I don’t see a point in it… besides, who’ll take care of you while Father is busy with the Dark Lord?”
He moved and sat down opposite his mother, worry growing in his chest. “Is something wrong? Do you feel sick again?”
“Calm down, will you? It’s literally our first day back,” Draco said, leaning back as he stared at the table which was a mess, filled with papers, books, quills, ink, etc.
“He has an Invisibility Cloak, doesn’t he?” she asked. “And… worst comes to worst, we can pretend we’re dating.”
Then, Harry jumped forwards and pushed Draco down on the bed, hitting their lips together. The two quickly pulled apart, groaning in pain.
It had been a month since Dumbledore’s death. The days had been bleak. Luckily for Draco, his father was usually out with Death Eater work, and he’d be left at home. The only dreadful time was the Death Eater meetings that occurred every week or so.
“No, Draco, I do,” More tears ran down his face. “I’m sorry. What happened in March was stupid. I was scared of my own feelings, and I was scared that you would be hurt because of me. I can’t help Hermione and Ron, they’re like… my ride-or-die. But you, I could save you, which is why I tried to push you away.”
“Oh dear, I guess it’s better for you to see and understand for yourself,” Pansy said with a long sigh as they walked into the Hall. Harry was seated at the Gryffindor table and was sitting beside Ron and Hermione. He turned to see Draco and slightly smiled at him. In return, Draco shot a demeaning glare at him before sitting down beside Pansy. “Come on, Draco. You’re being ridiculous.”
“It’s okay to take a break for yourself,” Draco said, sitting down on the seat beside him. “You’ve been through a lot the past couple of years; a lot more than anyone should in their lifetime.”
“There’s no use in hiding it, I suppose. It’s inevitable, and I don’t want you to be surprised. I just want you to know that I’m not going to intentionally hurt you. My father is… cruel. I’m not him. I’m… more like my mother, in a sense-”
“I know. I took it too far, and I know that. Honestly, I don’t know why this is bothering me so much. I guess it’s because, uh… a family member of mine is going deaf.”
“You will be needed for a task soon,” he stated. Draco felt his blood run cold. “The Dark Lord needs something to be done. I’m not sure what yet. But I can convince him that you are worthy of it.”
Harry felt anger rise up in his chest, and he banged on the door again, sitting down and leaning against the wall next to the door. “I’m not leaving until you open the goddamn door. I know you’re in there, and I know you can hear me, so stop being so hard to deal with, and please open the door.”
“Hey.” A voice spoke behind Harry. He turned to see silver eyes staring at him, a smile on the blond’s face but quickly fading when he noticed Harry wasn’t smiling. He looked around and then dragged Harry to a nearby broom closet. “Everything okay?”
It was going to be different with two people, as well as Pansy, who most likely wouldn’t be taking it easy on Harry.
“Harry, if you honestly believe that, then I don’t know what to say to you,” Draco said, his expression faltering suddenly. The two were silent for a moment, then he spoke again. “I don’t know what you want me to do! You told me this was worth the risk.”
“I was reading the instructions and we can make meanings with each tap. See, one tap can mean hey, and two taps can mean ‘I miss you’. I know it’s a bit ridiculous, but… given that we can’t spend a lot of time together… I thought it would be good for us.”
Draco was too busy grinning to pay attention to Pansy. “What?” He asked after a few moments, registering that Pansy had said something to him.
After a long banter, Draco was finally able to convince Harry to get into the shower. Draco didn’t seem to realize why Harry was so against going in the shower, but when he got out, it soon wasn’t a mystery anymore.
“You seem to be in a good mood,” he commented, adjusting his glasses as he got out his Charms textbook as well his wand. “Met with your girlfriend?”
“Okay, since you’re a little taller - which I hate, by the way - I guess you put your arm around my waist and I put mine on your shoulder,” Harry explained, doing so as he spoke. He put up his free hand and intertwined them with Draco’s.
“Harry?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. He was so sure he had asked for the other room. Was it because Harry was here?
“Coming,” Harry checked his wrist where his watch was, “two minutes after the time we had planned to meet is not late, Draco.”
“You know what?” Draco stopped narrating suddenly, shutting the book. “I think I became the one thing I swore not to.”
“Not really,” Draco said with a shrug. “I’m a Malfoy. We’re pretty much born to lie and keep secrets to get what we want.”
“I can always write it down if that’s the case. I’m not just going to let you stay in the dark if there’s a planned attack.”
“Er… just before my father placed the curse on us,” he said. The look on Harry’s face made him realize he needed to elaborate. “It was an awful day, really. You encountered the Boggart and I was hurt. In my dorm there was this book that Snape had given me during the war. Um… the book basically explained everything about soulmates. I wanted to go see you after that. You know, talk things out, but… My father sent a letter for me to go back home immediately, so I went. Then he put the curse on both of us.”
Harry looked at the map, scanning through every place he could possibly be. But his name was nowhere to be found. Harry saw Pansy’s name, Crabbe and Goyle’s name, and even Blaise’s. If Draco was studying, why wasn’t he at the library or in his dorm or Common Room? Or even with one of his friends?
“Me? I should be thanking you.” Astoria said. “We’ll finish this off later, Draco.” She winked and walked in the direction opposite from where Harry was walking up to.
“Well, Hermione and I came rushing to see what was wrong. Then Parkinson did too, and so did Luna and a few other students. Then Professor McGonagall asked everyone to move out of the way as she took you to the Hospital Wing. We weren’t allowed to visit you until Friday. Harry, when we saw you on Friday… you looked horrible.” Ron explained. “Hermione even started crying, but she’ll never admit that to you.”
“Yes, but you used to be enemies,” she pointed out, frowning. “Other than that, you come from a family that wants him dead. It’s only natural that he’s wary. Both of you need to sit down and talk about it calmly.”
“Just to confirm,” Ron piped up, “Hermione didn’t tell me a thing about this. But… I did kind of question the hair thing…”
“Thankful? Yes, thank you for leaving, Draco,” he spat. Draco’s name was like poison on his tongue. “Thank you for making me think that there was something wrong with me, that I didn’t deserve to move on and be happy like you are.”
“I told you I would explain myself. You didn’t let me, Harry, and this is how things have become. So, therefore, you ruined everythin-”
“They do realize doing this every time they meet in the hallways is unnecessary, right?” Ron asked Hermione and Pansy who just nodded in agreement, all three of them staring at Harry and Draco who were staring each other down in the middle of the hallway.
“I try to dye it back, but it doesn’t work. I think I just have a patch there or something. Hey, it could be part of the curse your father put on us. You have a brown streak, see?”
What Harry didn’t hear was Draco’s silent sobs as he couldn’t bear to hear the sound of Harry’s voice breaking every time he came and talked through the door.
“Right, that’s why you and Pansy don’t meddle in our relationship at all,” he stated sarcastically, nodding. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “So you’re telling me Draco is my...
By the looks of it, Draco was really taking all of this seriously. He was pretending that Harry didn’t even exist, which hurt more than he thought it would. His words would randomly come into his head: ‘worth the risk’. Was Draco worth the risk? More importantly, why did Draco think that Harry wasn’t worth the risk?
After a few hours of wandering about (and going to the Grimmauld Place and wandering about inside), Draco slowly made his way back to Malfoy Manor.
“Oh, this? It’s just a promise ring…” Harry awkwardly scratched the back of his neck. “No, Draco and I are just dating for now…” Molly nodded to show she understood, still smiling. Harry paused for a few seconds, before biting his lip. “S-so, you’re okay with me being gay?”
“Harry, come on!” Draco snapped. “First you don’t tell me about your abusive past, then you’re skipping meals?!”
“Why here?” Draco asked as he watched Harry pace around one section of the wall a few times. He took a small step back as he saw a door emerge on the wall, confused. “Um… what’s this now?”
“It’s the middle of summer. You can’t be wearing that. You’d die from heat exhaustion,” Harry looked at him, tilting his head. “Come on.”
“You lied and kept secrets about me,” Harry said without thinking. “Wait, was that supposed to be a pickup line?”
“Harry, so sorry to bother you on the second day back, but it seems as if my shoes have gone missing again.” Luna Lovegood said in her usual dreamy voice, smiling softly at Harry. “I am truly sorry for asking you of this, but could you help me look for them?”
Standing up, Harry walked over and - uncomfortably - sat on Draco’s lap until he settled, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder, who wrapped his arms around him. “Do you need to do your homework now? Or we could…”
When they were finally sent back to their dorm rooms, Harry sunk down on the couch in the Gryffindor Common Room, leaning back, thinking about what Pansy had said. She was right. Draco hadn’t done something the past few months for there to be uncertainty.
Draco stared at the note, finding himself smiling, putting it away before Pansy could question what it said.
He pushed away the obvious meaning of it, turning away from his reflection, jumping when Pansy walked in, clutching her purse. “You need to stop doing that,” he scoffed.
“Seriously? So I finally agree to a dog and you push the limit that way? I might just go out and, I dunno, buy a ferret?”
“I understand,” he responded, walking towards her. “I miss him too. It’s like… little things, you know? That reminds you of him. Like the change in the color of the leaves, or the first snowfall, or someone who looks at you the way he would.”
“Did it? Because all I remember is knowing you were supposed to kill Dumbledore, and not being able to do anything about it,” he snapped, guilt creeping up his chest when he saw the look in Draco's eyes. “I’m sorry. I'm sorry. It’s not your fault. It really isn't.”
“Another letter…” Hermione stared at the owl that flew on Harry’s shoulder this time, parchment paper attached to it. “Er… Harry, do you have a girlfriend?”
It was quiet for a moment, and Harry looked down at his hands as he played with them, trying not to give away how shitty he felt. “Did you like me at all?” he mumbled, standing up. He had to leave. It was bad enough that he was practically being rejected. He didn’t want Draco to see him cry, too.
They washed the liquidy slime off of their faces. Draco was done before Harry, but found himself waiting for him. The two stood there for a moment too long, until Draco finally spoke. “...you have some in your hair,” he mumbled while signing.
Rolling his eyes, Harry removed his scarf and put it around Draco’s neck, securing it properly so it wouldn’t fall off. “Better?” He asked. “Ron and Hermione will be here soon. You
He smiled at them gratefully. If there was one thing he could take away from all of this, it was that Ron and Hermione really did care for him. While it was disappointing to see not many others did, he decided he had to get over it and focus on the bigger issue - Voldemort.
In the Great Hall, Harry kept his head low. Most of the people he had liked to call friends before were now ignoring him and there was nothing he could do about it. If they thought he was lying about Cedric and him being deaf, that was
“Oh, what are you now, detectives? I sat down because I wanted to make sure that both Dr- Malfoy and I were okay.”
“Well… at least come to dinner. You’ve been sitting here all day,” Hermione said, frowning. She held her hand out, and he reluctantly took it, standing up. She wondered if it was a good time to tell him that she knew he had a girlfriend, but decided against it. He had been easily irritable lately when it came to things like that.
“We could go on about this all night. It was both of our faults, okay? I’m okay, aren’t I? And I forgive you. And I love you, and I know you’ll never do it again. Don’t worry, okay? No one blames you.”
The day before Christmas, Draco stayed in his room, lying under the covers of his bed. He had about five or six poems simply hidden under his pillow, but he knew he couldn’t send them. More so, shouldn’t. Malfoy Manor had held a Death Eater meeting two days ago, and the things he heard made him realize the depth of the situation he was in.
“You’ve been so weird all weekend,” Ron said as the three sat down during Charms class. It was a revision lesson today, which meant they could study and chat all they liked. After all, it was their last week before the holidays. “Did something happen?”
When he got out with just a towel wrapped around his waist, he heard the door open from and footsteps.
“Everyone kept leaving the dinner table, so I came to see what the fuss was about. You just got here!”
“I’m tired!” Harry raised his voice, causing everyone who was chatting to quiet down at once. He turned around and looked at everyone before shaking his head, his voice dropping low, “I’m just… tired.”
Draco was rather surprised by her embrace, but it was good to see so many familiar faces again. For a short while, people were in one big group talking, but after a while, it broke off into separate groups.
“Yeah, well… this is my first day off in a while. I do close my shop for holidays and stuff, but… I don’t really go out for anything other than grocery shopping or seeing my friends.”
When Draco was sure there was no one in the hallway, he slowly stepped out, staring at Harry who was staring at the floor, unable to decipher what was going on.
What’s worse was that today was Luna’s birthday, and she’d invited Draco to her party, as well as Astoria.
Harry stared into Draco’s silver eyes as his breath finally evened out, calming himself. Draco was comfortingly squeezing Harry’s hand. “Are you okay?”
“Anyway… who’s your girlfriend?” When he didn’t reply, she raised an eyebrow, dropping her voice to a whisper. “...boyfriend?”
“You do, and it’s not a bad thing,” Pansy said, sensing his scared tone. “You have someone. He’ll be yours. He’ll accept you.”
“Hmm? Oh yeah, sure.” Harry replied dazedly. “Just this medicine makes me a bit forgetful and unfocused.”
The two cuddled until Draco left before everyone was done with dinner. After Harry thanked Draco again (which Draco responded with a smack and told him not to thank him), they wished each other a good night.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry scoffed, folding the note and putting it on his bedside table, unsure of what to say. “You know, yesterday… I wasn’t studying. I, uh… I was on a date with someone.”
“Alright, I’ll start first!” said Pansy, getting an empty Firewhisky bottle and spinning it. It landed on Blaise. The two shared a quick kiss. Then, it went on to several other people, until finally…
Harry blinked in confusion, adjusting his glasses. “So there’s no old relative that came to stay with you?” he asked. Draco shook his head. “Oh, Draco,” his voice was soft. He put his arm around Draco, who leaned his head on his shoulder.
Harry smiled at Draco sheepishly, shrugging slightly, “Maybe,” He whispered, placing his head on Draco’s shoulder, “It’s only October. We have loads of time until the exams.” He murmured, shutting his eyes.
Draco Malfoy sat at his desk, staring down at his watch. He had sent a few taps in the past few days, but never got any in response. Maybe Harry had taken it off and kept it somewhere. That was the only logical explanation.
Draco looked down at his wrist, quickly pulling his sweater over it. “Um… yeah. Harry gave it to me. I know I shouldn’t, but…” he paused. “Speaking of which, why did you set us up like that? I… wasn’t prepared for it.”
Tears were rushing down Harry’s face, the gut-wrenching pain of guilt hitting him, as the boy beside him continued to shake uncontrollably.
Thankfully, the two had given each other ‘love bites’ in secluded places, which could be easily hidden by the collars of their shirts.
“Much better,” Harry replied, grinning right back. “I can see your beautiful face now.” Draco scoffed but didn’t say anything, secretly enjoying the compliment. He shut his book and stretched his arms before slowly getting out of the bed.
“You disgust me, Pansy,” he said monotonously, having already picked up his things and was walking to his dorm. The few Slytherins that were left in the common room turned to her, bewildered and confused. After picking up a few things from his dorm, he left about twenty minutes later, back to the Room of Requirement, though this time, he was asking for a different room.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Not usually. Right now, a little bit. But I mostly feel regret for not doing anything. He had me immobilized. Maybe if I could’ve defended him if I wasn’t…”
Harry’s eyes flickered over to Hermione and Ron as he jumped slightly, snapping out of his thoughts. “Huh?” was all he managed to get out, his green eyes still seeming quite far away.
“If we’re doing this, we need to have ground rules. Rule one: you have to trust me,” Draco said sternly. Harry was just surprised that Draco was actually giving into this idea. Albeit stupid, it was nice to talk to him after so long.
“I keep things real,” Harry shrugged, smirking. Staring into Draco’s silver eyes were almost intoxicating. He felt like an idiot for letting him take his breath away, but he couldn’t help it. Draco was perfect. No, he wasn’t perfect. But he was beautiful, and his imperfections is what Harry loved the most about him.
“Draco, please. Please just open the door. I know you’re in there, Draco,” Harry had said on the fifth day.
They both ordered - Draco got an Americano while Harry got a hot chocolate. The two decided to go to the park nearby so they could sit a bit further away from each other.
That night, Harry got a letter from Dumbledore, saying that he wanted to meet him in his office. He went at once. Anything to distract his mind. Anything to make him stop the pure heartbreak he was feeling, even if it was just for a while.
“Were you ever planning on telling me? That a part of you - no matter how big, nor how small - still believes that I could potentially be evil, that I’m just doing Death Eater work, that-”
Though Harry was excited to be able to listen in lessons again, he wondered what that meant for the lessons between him and Draco. Well, Harry was still a little behind than everyone else, and Draco still wanted to learn more sign language, but was pretty much at Harry’s level now, which was surprising.
The next evening, Harry hung back after their last class was over, hoping to catch Draco. He didn’t want this to go on longer than it should, and decided it was best to talk to him. After all, he couldn’t help but feel guilty.
“No, you are not! Next thing I know, you’ll be skipping classes.” Draco scolded. “You are so out of line; not taking care of yourself, --”
Hermione nudged his shoulder. Harry finally snapped out of his thoughts and looked up at her. “Just… be careful the next few days.”
Harry glanced at his ex-arch nemesis. “I have a few things to say,” he announced. “One, isn’t your dad a Deatheater? Doesn’t that make you automatically on Voldemort’s side?”
Harry’s eyes moved down to his lips, trying to understand what he said. Frowning, he turned back to Hermione who had tapped him on the shoulder. He wondered what Draco said, but at this point, he wasn’t sure if he wanted to know. By the look on everyone’s faces, it seemed that no one believed that he was deaf.
It was the day of the feast and Harry had just questioned Nick about Sirius. He felt his chest ache for the first time since it had hit him that Sirius had died, and now he learnt that he wouldn’t be back, ever. Not as a ghost, not as a wizard, nothing.
The aftermath was probably the worst for Harry. It was what gave him the most time to think. As he sat in the hospital wing, he stared into space while everyone was speaking to each other quietly. The atmosphere was tense. Hermione sat down beside him.
“I hope… I hope I make a decision by then,” Harry said, playing with the sleeves of his sweater. The three sat in a comfortable silence before standing up and Apparating to Luna’s house.
“Like anyone would send you a letter, Ron,” Hermione laughed, high fiving Harry who also chuckled. “But you know, if this person is bothering you, we can get to the bottom of it.”
“Here I am, my darling.” Draco teased back. The two started off into the forest. Harry took Draco’s hand and stared at it for a few seconds before looking back up.
Draco entered the Hall feeling much better than Thursday too. The Dark Lord had paused the task for a week or so and he already felt better. He didn’t have the constant burning from his Dark Mark nor did he feel pressurized. When he glanced over at Harry, he smiled slightly.
“Hmm?” He looked up, just in time to see Harry quickly leaning forward and kissing him on the cheek, ruffling his hair. Draco rolled his eyes, but looked at himself in the mirror, and made no attempt to fix the mess Harry had made to his hair.
“You aren’t, you really aren’t,” Harry spoke. He felt it was now his turn. “How do you think I felt? Finding out you aren’t on my side, that you’ve been doing things behind my back. That maybe it was all a lie, that maybe you were just acting from the beginning.
!” Draco hissed. “Come on Pansy, I need help. I have no idea what to wear. No idea what snacks to take. I told him I’d bring food.”
Harry was practically giddy on Saturday morning. He happily got out of bed, got ready and went for breakfast.
“They’re PureBloods too,” Draco pointed out, but this only frustrated Astoria more. Standing up from his lap, she left their room to find Narcissa. They were going to go Christmas shopping.
Draco pulled at the sleeves of his sweater. “I’m fine,” he said as he sidled beside Harry, looking out at the view of the city.
Ron and Hermione had, of course, questioned Harry about what happened. They only got one sentence in response.
“Well, I’m glad to hear that. But it seems to me you’re more than just dating…” She glanced down to Harry’s left hand.
“Oh, yes! Draco got them for me,” he smiled as she walked towards him. He took one of them out and handed them to her. “It works great. I just wish I didn’t have to endure that whole year of suffering.”
Draco looked at him apologetically. “I’m sorry, I was just heated up. I’ll enunciate more-” he watched as the other stood up, then held out his hand. “What?”
“Now don’t be silly, dear! Any friend of Harry’s is always welcome,” Molly said with a smile, ushering them inside before Draco could argue.
He couldn’t argue with that. Most of all, he wanted to be with Draco, but he couldn’t. He had ruined it.
“Mhm,” Draco hummed, finding himself getting comfortable in Harry’s arms, slowly drifting off. But just before he fell asleep, a half-asleep thought had occurred to him, one so quick that he perhaps would not remember thinking it when he woke up. One that, if said out loud, would change everything.
He turned to leave, opening the door. Suddenly, he turned around, heart beating so fast he thought he might faint. “Would you like to get coffee sometime? Preferably five to six feet apart.”
“Harry, are you mad? Have you gone utterly crazy? Do you think I wouldn’t have told you if I could?” Draco asked, his voice cracking. “I wasn’t allowed to. I wasn’t going to. Harry, I so desperately wanted to tell you…”
“For your safety, don’t, okay?” Harry took his hand and squeezed it. “Promise me. I’d rather be ambushed than lose you. Besides, this is what our training is for, right? You’re helping me in any way you can. Don’t overdo it before you end up in danger.”
Harry entered his dorm, Draco close behind him. Harry shut the door behind Draco. There was only one lamp on, which was on the other side of the room. It definitely set the mood.
Harry smiled, taking the bite. He looked down at Draco’s hands, noticing his nails were dark green. He choked on his food which startled Draco.
Harry said nothing, looking up at him. His bright green eyes in the sunshine only gleamed more. Draco stayed silent for a moment, reaching into his pocket and taking out a small velvet box, handing it to Harry.
Draco’s eyes widened, feeling more nervous - but hey, at least he hadn’t flat out said no. “Okay. Take as long as you need. My wedding’s in March, so um...”
Anger rising in his chest, Draco slowly looked up. “What kind of consequences?” He asked in a low, rough voice, feeling like he was fighting back tears, but also an urge to murder the man right before his eyes.
“You would know that I’m not on his side if you let me explain,” Draco told him, glaring at him. “But, no. You were running off with your little girlfriend, making out with her; perhaps even more.”
“You don’t need to apologize for what happened. I understand. I was… just worried you wouldn’t want to learn sign language because of it.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Is there more alcohol?” he asked, biting his lip. He looked over Hermione’s shoulder to see Draco sitting on the couch by himself.
“Bullshit! You used it pretty much all throughout sixth year. Don’t try bullshitting me!” Harry said, scoffing at Draco’s lame excuse. “You know very well how to use it!”
Meanwhile, Harry had slowed down, cursing under his breath when he realized he had forgotten his Invisibility Cloak. Shrugging, he felt the pounding in his heart increasing as he slowly got closer.
Harry went for his detention, missing the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. When he had entered the Gryffindor Common Room, everyone was celebrating.
“I have a date with someone,” Harry said slowly, looking down and playing with the sleeves of his sweater. Hermione shut her book almost immediately.
It was a wonder how Draco’s eyes hadn’t dried out yet. His eyes bloodshot red, as he leaned against the wall, hugging his knees, shaking immensely.
“We made the deal for the best,” Draco stroked Harry’s cheek with his index finger absentmindedly. “So that we don’t die. Or rip each other’s throats apart.”
“No. Yes. No-” he let out a groan. “I don’t… I don’t want to change my mind now. He’s married. The best option is to let him go, isn’t it?”
“No, it’s fine. You can work with Ron,” he said. “I’ll find someone…” he looked around the Gryffindor side, pursing his lips when he noticed everyone was in pairs already. He jumped when Snape tapped him on the shoulder.
, and there’s no problem with that because we’re definitely not even together anymore but Astoria Greengrass? He deserves much,
“I don’t know,” he answered finally, running a hand through his messy hair. “Just trying to adjust to this change.”
Harry, who was still taken aback, gulped, then turned back to his textbook. “Um, right… seven drops of hellebore.”
“We’re about to cut the cake, so you can make out for like five more minutes,” Pansy said, quickly catching the pillow Harry threw at her. “We’ll tell everyone that you’ll come down in a bit.”
“Shut up, Pansy,” Harry rolled his eyes, putting a hand to his neck. He had forgotten to wear a turtleneck. Draco’s eyes moved down to his neck, surprised by the few hickeys that were there. Well… it only made sense that he moved on. Clearly they didn’t love each other anymore. It was sensible, really…
“It’s barely been a day, Pansy. I don’t want to seem clingy,” he stated as if what he was saying was so obvious. “I don’t want to rush anything, either. It’d be quite embarrassing, wouldn’t it?”
“Maybe I shouldn’t have pushed him, but… for fuck’s sake,” he quickly wiped his tears away, avoiding her gaze. “I thought Harry could trust me. He… thinks I’d go off telling my father if he says anything.”
“Hey, Draco, today’s the day!” Pansy said, not bothering to knock as she entered the room, rolling her eyes when she saw he was still in bed. “Get up, bonehead! It’s your wedding day!”
“Uh, well, Merry Christmas!” Harry said, taking the gift boxes he had in his hands and put it under the Christmas tree.
“You suppose? This is the second time we’re sitting this close to each other. You would’ve bled to death by now if it was still in place.”
She looked over to Ron, who seemed just as confused. “Okay, so,” she moved away from the door, “there’s this legend in the Wizarding World that… some people have soulmates… and it can be found in different ways… like… the hair,” she pointed to his faded streak.
Harry stared back, before facepalming and turning away from him, getting back to his work. Draco chuckled before getting back to his work as well. The two were in the library, but after they were done studying and finishing off their homework, they would be going to the Room of Requirement to spend the night there.
“It’d be strange if she did,” he said, then smiled at her gratefully, putting a delicate hand to his gelled hair. “Thanks again about being so cool with this, Astoria. Seriously. I’m surprised you’re taking all of this so well.”
“I missed you,” Draco mumbled to Harry. He had now stopped kissing Harry’s neck and simply was laying his head on his shoulder. Their hands were intertwined.
“You better not,” he quickly pocketed the paper after scanning through it. “I’m not too interested myself, so…”
Draco had been studying Harry, too. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his hair was a mess. He seemed more scrawny, as if he hadn’t been eating much. His eyes were greener than ever, however, and Draco found himself getting lost in them.
“How soon?” Harry asked, grabbing Draco’s hand and gripping onto it tightly, afraid to let go. “I…” his eyes welled up with tears. “I’m not sure if I can keep doing this. It hurts so much, Draco.’
. We’re in the damn library. Now, let if you’re not going to study, let me read, at least,” Draco said, pulling Harry’s chair closer to him and adjusting his head so that the other wasn’t uncomfortable leaning against him.
“I actually need to finish this essay, fuck,” Harry said, quickly getting out his quill and ink, starting to write as fast as he could, the stress in his eyes clear as day. Draco snickered beside him. “Oh, shut the fuck up, Draco,” Harry muttered as he continued writing.
Two weeks later, when Harry, Hermione and Ron were trying to make their way to the Room of Requirement, Umbridge had caught them with the Inquisitorial Squad. They took the three directly to her office, however the rest of the group was yet to be found.
“Sorry I kept you waiting,” Draco said as he approached Harry. Harry, who was busy daydreaming, hadn’t even notice Draco walk up to him. He suddenly felt extremely nervous. “But Pansy wouldn’t stop fussing over my clothes and wouldn’t stop until I had to practically run away from her.”
Every morning, without fail, there would be Draco’s owl at the window with a new poem. Harry found himself writing back, either related to the poem or just something completely different, just to get his mind off of the things that had been eating at him. Those ten minutes every morning were the only eventful and positive thing about his days.
“I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t think you’d be here,” he said, his tone serious and panicked. “Now I’ll have to-”
“Harry, wait,” Draco blurted before he could stop himself. “Your-- your decision. Are you any closer to… making a decision?”
Draco didn’t even look at her, picking up the Daily Prophet. “Don’t look at me like that, Pansy, it’s terrifying.”
“Late as always?” Draco retorted, keeping his eyes on the other as he sat down across from him. “Hey,” he leaned forward, his face all serious. Harry leaned in too, frowning, wondering if there was something wrong on his face.
“Oh, Christ, no. He was horrified, to say the least,” Harry shook his head. “No, no… I think he mentioned he was supposed to give that drink to Dumbledore.”
It was a rule of theirs to not speak of Voldemort, but it wasn’t so easy. Not when Draco was working for him, and when Harry was the center of it all. Harry put a hand to his temple. “I don’t know. It’s all really frustrating. You know, Katie Bell was cursed…”
Draco picked up the other one and took Harry’s left hand, putting it on his ring finger, lifting his hand to his face and kissing it gently. “I love you, Harry,” He whispered, starting to play with Harry’s fingers as he started to feel slightly embarrassed.
“I’ve been better,” he nodded, adjusting his glasses and folding his arms. “Why aren’t you eating with the others?”
Draco signed slowly, hands trembling slightly, and he noticed that Harry smiled for probably the first time that day. “I can’t tell if I’m a horrible teacher or you’re a terrible learner.”
“As I was saying…” he gulped, looking up at Draco. “Slughorn gave us this mead to drink. I wasn’t really into it but I’m supposed to gain his trust - um forget I said that. Anyway, he was still toasting so neither of us took a sip, but Ron did, and guess what, it was poisoned. I had to save his life.”
“I don’t, but since it was my fault he fell, I had the decency to make sure he was okay. Are we done with this interrogation now?”
At night, thoughts of Harry consumed him. Was this the right choice? Was Pansy right? What he knew was that this was bigger than him. It was something out of his control.
“I do suggest that you break up with him before I have to take matters into my own hands, Potter,” Lucius said, “And I really know that you’re smart. So make the right decision.”
“I will do what I like, thank you very much,” he said, then sighed when she glared at him. “I don’t want to talk to you right now. You’ve kept this from me for… I don’t know, five years?”
actually deaf and not… pretending, like you said?” she asked. She tried not to show it, but she was surprised by his signing ability.
“Sorry, I fail to see how this is your doing,” Draco replied. “Come on, let’s go to breakfast.” He quickly changed the subject before Pansy could go on an explanation of how it was her doing.
“I know,” the blond shrugged, stepping towards the brunet, trying not to smile. “I just thought about how sad your arse would be to spend a Friday without me now. I bet you’re used to it.”
