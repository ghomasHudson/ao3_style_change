“Did you think I wouldn’t notice?” Lucius asked quietly.
Harry held out a jacket. “I’m not going to deal with the looks we’re likely to get if you’re walking around in a wizarding robe, Draco. We’re bound to get enough with my cane and your elfin features.”
It was quiet and cold as Harry walked through the early morning streets of London. There was a layer of ice on the grass and trees, and Harry walked slowly to avoid slipping. It wasn’t silent, by any means, but there was a peacefulness to the scene that Harry knew could only be attributed to the fact the sun hadn’t quite finished rising.
"I never wanted to leave. I dreamt of staying here over the summer instead of going back to the Dursleys’, but Dumbledore always insisted I’d be safer in Surrey." Harry laughed, but there was little humour to the sound. "At least until I turned seventeen."
"I bloody hate it up here."
I am on a trip! Thank you for reading! I'm thinking of you all in Chicago~

unusual was for Draco to be able to lie beside Harry, watching the gentle rise and fall of his chest as he slept.
Harry was pulled from his thoughts by the sound of angry shouting around the corner. He hurried down the hall as quickly as his exhausted legs would take him, drawing his wand as he went. When he rounded the corner, he saw two boys kicking someone on the ground.
“Hm?” she asked.
Hogwarts has become a place of painful memories.
Harry ran his fingers over the nearly pressed Malfoy seal at the bottom of the page, done in silver, of course. Harry sighed and wandered into the kitchen, letter in hand.
“Me too,” Harry murmured, resting his head on Draco’s chest and smiling when Draco draped an arm over him.
“Come on,” he said. “I’m hungry and I want something sweet to eat before we go.”
“As if you didn’t know,” he said, leaning against the counter beside Draco. “Or do you send all your letters in silver?”
And then Harry cries, and Draco isn't sure what to do, so he holds him. He doesn't say anything, even as Harry's tears ruin one of his few remaining nice shirts.
“It’s going to fucking bruise. It always does. Bloody Malfoy complexion--I bruise if you tap me on the shoulder.”
“It’s just a bruise,” Malfoy said. “I’ll be fine.”
I laughed for a good 15 minutes when I saw this prompt. I was both horrified and amused, and very glad it doesn't actually exist. (If it does exist, please PLEASE do not let me know.) Thank you for reading!

is what broke him.
“The least you could do is ask my name first!” said the man, laughing.
“Harry, I understand you don’t want to kiss anybody, but I am getting increasingly irritated at having a conversation with you while you’re three steps behind,” Draco said. “Honestly, you should know by now that I wouldn’t force you to kiss me, mistletoe or not.”

Andromeda hummed. “Saturday,” she said. “I’m just pleased Draco’s willing to brew the Wolfsbane for him every month, even if Teddy despises the taste.”
Harry ran the feather of his quill against his chin. It’d never been so hard to write to Ron before. He couldn’t tell him about the situation with Malfoy. To be honest, he wasn’t really even sure what the situation was himself.
“Fuck!” he shouted, kicking the pile of leaves and twigs that had appeared at his feet.
This is extra early today because I have a lot to do! This is mostly based on my absolute need for coffee right now. I hope you enjoyed!

“We went one year...I can’t remember how old I was, but I remember that the lights seemed like magic all on their own. I still don’t know how Muggles make them glow like that.” Malfoy smiled to himself. “They were in the trees, and in the air, and on the buildings. They were beautiful.”
“You were so upset the other day,” said Harry. “I thought maybe you’d be happier with a different ring.”
“Excuse me,” said Draco, “but this booth is occupied, as I’m sure you’ve noticed.”
“And not because of my devilishly good looks?” Malfoy asked, leaning forward.
“I’m sure you’ll be able to think of something,” Draco said. “Especially considering the way you decorated our house this Christmas; I thought you’d gone a bit mad, to be honest.”
“I’ll be sure to keep my mouth closed, then.”
“I know I’ve worked at a Muggle school for over a year, but I’m still very impressed by what they can do with electricity.”
Harry blinked, eyes wide behind his glasses. “Yes?”
Grimmauld Place was warm and decorated, much to Harry’s surprise. Draco was standing in the sitting room, looking around with a strange expression on his face.
Thank you for reading!!!
The bathroom was as still and empty as ever. He wasn’t even sure Myrtle hung around here much anymore. He walked towards the tap that never worked and felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise.
had been the one to cause that.
“It’s good,” he said after a moment. “I didn’t know you could cook, Po--Harry.”
Day 20 of the 25 Days of H/D!!!
Draco hummed absentmindedly at whatever his mother was saying. He was really too tired to handle dinner with her right now, after the week he'd had. As much fun as it was to wind Harry up every chance he got, there was quite a bit of stress on Draco's part, particularly the part where he still had to tell his mother he was engaged.
“I’m sorry I’m late,” he said. “My housemates have taken to hiding my belongings when they think I’m not looking.”
Narcissa looked a bit disappointed at that, but nodded. “Of course.”
“Doesn’t look like it, no.”
“Because after it’s all over, you’re going to be standing next to me, and I can’t have my students’ parents thinking you’re anything less than brilliant.”
“If it’s that clock thing, I’m not interested.”

"I’m sure that’s unlikely, but I do thank you for your attempt at enthusiasm," McGonagall said dryly. She glanced at the clock and sighed. "We’d best head down. I feel our guests may become impatient if we wait too much longer."
“You think?”
“That’s pretty neat, that.”
Harry could swear he felt the temperature of the room drop a few degrees when Lucius smiled at that. The smile was sharp and cold, and Harry was thrown back to that night at the Ministry, when he thought that smile would be the last thing he ever saw.
Draco watched him for a moment, concern just barely visible on his face. Then, he nodded, turning back to the essays on his lap. “Ask him if he’s still got purple.”

“At least I’m fooling somebody.”
Once in the Defence room, Harry dug through his bag for his book until he realised he’d left it on the library table.
Hermione sighed sympathetically. “I do, Harry, but it still hurt to find out nearly two years after the fact that you’d been with Draco. Especially after everything that happened....” She trailed off, but before Harry had a chance to respond, she stood and asked, “Do you want some plum pudding? Molly sent it over.”
The reporters waiting in the entry hall went silent as Draco, Harry, and McGonagall approached. Harry flushed, feeling his anxiety spike and the trembling of his hands to increase. They gazed up at him, star-struck and a little bit teary; Harry wondered if they even realised he was human.
It was Harry’s turn to be embarrassed.
Thank you for reading! :D
Harry prepares gifts with Hermione.
“Right.” Malfoy nodded. “Of course.”
“You bought the entire Slytherin team brand new, state of the art brooms. Tact was not your strongest skill.”
Pretending he hadn’t heard Draco, Harry said too enthusiastically, “Look, Teddy! That one looks like the Hogwarts Express!”
"Harry," Draco said. Then, more firmly: "Harry, look at me."
Harry rolled his eyes, but gripped his cane more tightly. “You’ve never had his cooking, Draco, and I can think of

It really was a pretty owl. The letter, on the other hand…

Harry has a surprise for Draco.
There was a crowd downstairs celebrating Dumbledore as if he’d been a good man and Harry as if he’d been a brave one, while all Harry wanted to do was forget everything that had ever happened.

He turned around, and missed the way Draco smiled as he tucked the keychain into his pocket.
"I dreamed about the snitch," Harry says shakily some time later.
Harry walked up his stairs, leaning heavily on his cane. After a day of running around to different shops with Draco, his legs were aching. He was so, so tired.
Trust is Harry being able to bow his head to a hippogriff. It’s exposing the back of his neck to that sharp beak and talons, and hoping he’ll be safe. Trust is making Draco know Harry can be trusted, because beneath the sharp words and the cold grey eyes, Harry knows Draco is vulnerable, just waiting to attack, to defend. Harry knows, because Harry is the same way. To Harry, trust is knowing he and Draco will make it out alive.
(See the end of the chapter for
The words came out in a rush and Harry felt his face heat in embarrassment. He looked away. Draco stayed quiet for a long moment, until Harry finally looked up at him.
“You need to relax,” Draco said.
“I’ll be in here,” Andromeda said, and then added, “And Harry?”
But as if he could hear the thoughts tearing through Draco’s mind, Harry rolled over and pulled Draco into his embrace.
you hiding?”
The library was deserted. Harry preferred it that way; fewer people around to stare at him as he walked through the shelves. There were always a few who would give him startled looks as he went into the Restricted Section and came out with books on Dark magic that hadn’t been touched in decades.
The two shared a heavy look, one that conveyed far more than he could discern. Harry felt himself wilt slightly, regret for his situation growing quickly as Perenelle reached over and settled her other hand on his upper arm.
The first is situated at the ministry, and is as clean and spotless as any high-ranking office at the ministry ever was. The walls are bare, with nothing but a single, imposing portrait of the man himself situated right behind his desk. When one enters, they would expect to find a spotless room with a spotless man sitting behind the spotless desk wearing a spotless sneer across his spotless face. It is the office that Lord Malfoy uses the least, though it is the one that all of his professional associates know the most. Anyone who works with or under the man, be it in investments-his favorite pastime-or in the Wizengamot, only saw Lord Malfoy in that hideously spotless office, and he preferred it that way. Spotless was blameless, after all.
managed to disregard my authority enough to barge into my conscious mind, does not mean you have any right to information that does not concern you.” He replied tiredly, feeling the beginnings of a migraine building up behind his eyes. He had been expending far too much magic throughout the day. Keeping Harry’s thoughts away from anything that could have been damaging if Marvolo caught wind of it had taken an absurd amount of strength as it was, never mind the fighting and injuries he had also sustained. Keeping another person’s mind so clouded at the same time that he was fighting to keep another mind from infiltrating further into said mind… Tom sighed, rubbing the migraine away temporarily. He would rest his magic and his mind after he got rid of the pest, and then he would apologize to Harry for trying to keep him tight-lipped for so long.
“You’re a constant.”
“What was in the bloody letter, Harry.” Draco replied in a barely-discernible whisper, his pacing stopping short as he turned back to look at Harry. He looked so breakable at that moment, so utterly terrified of the known unknown. “You had gotten it this morning, yeah? So your crisis this morning had been about it,
“I’ve never seen you like that before Harry, it scared me.” He whispered, a quiet admission that ripped the rug out from underneath Harry in one sentence alone. “So when you start up like this… I’m scared, alright? Why won't you tell me?”
"Harry Potter? Eh bien oui, je suppose que ça pourrait l'être."
Harry pieced together what had happened instantly, and with a low groan let his head thunk against the wall of ice.
Pansy hadn’t really expected a visit from Tracey over the summer, as neither of them had thought it would be all that good of an idea considering Tracey’s rather poor reputation in the eyes of high society and Pansy’s family’s high standing in said society. However, it seemed that there was very little for either of them to do now that the summer had gotten a tad bit longer, and as Greengrass seemed to be far more interested in playing house with Zabini and Nott had all but dropped off the map, Pansy had tentatively extended the offer for the other girl to come over and see the estate for a day or two. Surprisingly, Tracey had begged off some sort of family vacation to do so, and they had happily planned out what they would do while she was at the manor.
“Yes.” Tom found himself replying, and he stretched his own hand out to meet the blue-eyed man. “And I suppose you will be forced to have a name now, won't you?”
to care this much about Tom’s shit. He wanted to be capable of just ignoring it, but he just
Xenophilius looked at him blankly, as if he didn’t understand the question. “Well I suppose, if she wishes.”
“Piss off.”
It might have just been his imagination, but Draco thought that it might have hummed slightly in response.
She pulled the seal out, apparently dubbing the wax to have cooled enough for her liking.
“Fascinating. The cut is different from the final product.”
“How is it different, Harry?” Came the quiet reply, so sharp and distinct that he nearly reeled backward in shock. He could practically
The hand moved from the back of his neck to his shoulder, and began to gently pull him backward. He fought it at first, instinctively wanting to curl further in on himself in retaliation. Pernelle’s soothing voice was gentle though, and eventually, he let her guide him back up, letting go of his hair and letting his hands fall back into his lap. His shoulders were still shaking as she let go of his shoulder fully to instead embrace him from the side, and he sank into her side as she continued to whisper worried phrases under her breath, her hand coming back up again to cradle the back of his neck.
“I don’t think his character over the past few years really makes a difference Luna. He still did what he did.” Theo’s matter-of-fact tone disrupted the pleasant thought, and she bit back a rude quip in regards to his mood as of late before pinning him with a sickeningly cheery smile.
Harry ignored the Leprechaun gold as it rained down onto them all, and kept mostly to himself as the game began and events started to play out just as before. He barely remembered what had gone on the first time he watched, the memory being so vague that all he really remembered was the feeling of excitement as they surged through him. So, he simply watched the people around him, observing as Draco’s sour mood quickly took a turn for the better as he rose up in his seat, screaming and jumping as the players flew around the place at near-impossible speeds, the colors of their quidditch robes mere blurs in the air as the whizzing of quaffles and bludgers was drowned out by the screaming fans and Bagman’s constant moderation.
though, objects disappearing and reappearing at random, were far more suspect.
Well, at least none that hadn’t originated from him.
He laughed lightly, sitting down as she waved her wand towards the stove top, setting it to work making a pointedly english breakfast before sitting down with him. He smiled at her softly, finding that she was likely one of the most fascinating people that he had met in quite a long time. Sure, Nicolas had amassed a wealth of knowledge that put Dumbledore to shame, but Perenelle was far more traveled than her husband, as she apparently spent quite a bit of time hunting through remote places looking for potions ingredients and various other fascinating things. They had talked for hours about her travels the night before, and he had noticed that her accent was much less distinct than her husband’s, though it seemed to be mixed with several other tongues as well, forming a vague amalgamation that he could never hope to pin down on a certain region of the world. He had realized their dynamic quite quickly after the first few hours really, understanding that she was the far more extroverted traveler that was off for months on end, while Nicolas was the introverted recluse that preferred to disappear from the world for decades at a time.  Harry could only assume that after so many years together they had managed to find a perfect sweet spot between both of their preferences and needs. It was fascinating to watch them go about life together.
The constant movement in front of him, the unfamiliar seat beneath him. All of it was so, so much more than he was accustomed to. It was just
He took another small sip of his tea, shifting the blankets tighter around himself as Pernelle’s tapping increased in speed. He bit the inside of his cheek, wondering how long he could draw this out, before she stopped altogether and threw both hands up into the air.
Without looking at her, and without making much noise at all, Lucius turned and steadily walked to his desk, sitting down behind it with care, as if a bomb were to go off any moment. Narcissa watched with rising concern as he gathered together a quill and a piece of parchment, and mechanically began to write out a reply, the letter still clutched in his left hand.
Theo paced the room, biting the inside of his cheek as Xenophilius watched him silently.
Pernelle situated herself down in the chair opposite of Nicolas, and suddenly Harry realized his few sparse seconds were up.
And finally:
Tom felt a red hot spike of anger rush through him, one that screamed through his nonexistent veins before settling deep in his stomach and staying there. His eyes followed the blue-eyed man as he came back around to his chair and sat down, thumbing through the booklet as he continued on. “You see, my tactics are much the same as dear Hadrian’s, meaning that I have a need to triumph over my foes on the battlefield, though I believe my preferred field of battles is one of wit while Hadrian prefers a more violent, physical approach. You, however, have dedicated our soul to the pursuit of death in order to fuel Hadrian’s own power, which I simply cannot tolerate without good reason for doing so.”
It didn’t really matter if Harry was particularly uncomfortable with having the death eater in his luggage or not.
He shouldered the door open, scrunching up his nose slightly and holding back a flinch as he was splashed with a foul-smelling, sticky potion, which quickly raced down his face to the rest of his body, cleaning the smoke’s lethal effects from his skin and clothes. Shoving the air-tight door closed behind him, Harry glared at Nicolas as the man coughed the rest of the smoke from his lungs, the elixir of life no doubt already purging his system of any harmful, long-lasting chemicals.
Xenophilius nodded to himself, puttering around the small living space as he muttered on. “Yes, oh yes. You’re the favorite, of that there is no doubt. She had told me-whispered it in my dreams on the day you awakened. Now, I’m not as gifted as my daughter, but I am much older and can hear Her very well. Yes oh yes…”
Draco took a shuddering breath, the flames dulling slightly, as if they had been doused with water.
to never speak to me again if they don’t like something I’ve done. You, however, have to stick around no matter
All of the dark tar finally flaked away, revealing a three centimeter long nugget of pure gold in its place. Nicolas reached forward with a hand, which was now covered with a dragon-hide glove, and picked up the small piece of gold. Reaching for a petri dish, he then let the nugget fall into it, and set that onto the table between them. Waiting only a moment, Harry curiously leaned forward, watching as the sun’s light from a nearby window hit the gold and made it glimmer.
Rubbing the tears from his eyes, he sent Nicolas and Perelle one last smile before turning and, with a shaky sigh, clasped his hand around Draco’s much smaller one. Draco sent a heavy, knowing smile his way, before throwing the purple powder into the fire. It roared up angrily, dyed the same hue of the powder now staining Draco’s fingers. Squeezing tightly to their entwined hands, Draco let go and picked up his downed luggage and, without a single glance back, disappearing into the flames with nothing but an assured shout of ‘Platform 9¾, floo entrance!’.
“Oh.” She breathed, watching as a familiar, horrific sight came slinking through the doorway and into the great hall. Harry’s soul was just as terrifying as she remembered it being on the last day of school, that familiar mess of constantly changing color and feeling, shifting and altering itself as the texture and color of his soul melted from one thing to the next. She watched, dazed and head fuzzy, as Harry’s magic switched effortlessly between strings of thick coils and dense wisps of smoke and fire, gold and green moving and bending through him as if it was a current of ever-increasing energy.
The man leaned back, eyes sharp and tone cold.
Draco groaned, burying his still-sizzling face in his hands and attempting to rub the feeling away. “You complete and utter… you
“Harry.”
“Would it be possible to turn a normal person into gold or another non-living thing like rock? Or would it be impossible due to the difference between living and non-living transmutations?”
“Hey, isn’t that Viktor Krum?”
“I’ll be fourteen in a month or so, yeah.” Harry hadn’t really thought about his birthday much that month. He briefly considered that it might be a good idea to write to the Dursleys, just to see how they’re fairing without him. “It lines up rather well actually. Since I've got a summer birthday I’ll always have the number in my age, so this’ll be my fourth year.”
bigger, though Luna had no idea how. Was this what the mysterious woman kept hinting at? Luna didn’t want to believe so, at least not yet, though the thought did linger besides her as she watched Harry calmly walk to his designated table, a writhing mess of golden coils wound taught around searingly cold green, all of it obscured slightly by a protective bolt of blood-red magic that raced from the tip of his head to just above his navel. Luna rather thought it was trying to keep Harry safe, like a twisted cloak of fury. The thought comforted her, just a little bit, despite the angry red magic burning swelteringly hot under her gaze.
Eventually, he sighed, and shook his head. “As long as no children have to die for the entertainment of adults, then I will be satisfied.”
“Leave? But Tommy dearest, you haven’t even told me about the letter yet! I want to know what it saaaaid!” The locket whined, still writhing around in its bonds as he stood over it, glaring hatefully.
“What’s your name, dear? You must have been very frightened of the chaos to have risked side-along portkeying.” The woman asked idly, forcing small talk into what he was certain must be a very bizarre situation for her. He stayed silent at first, merely watching as she moved up from his hand to his elbow, setting it back into place with a single, sharp movement.
Backing up another half a step, Theo felt his back hit the display case behind him, the uneven shelves digging into his back as he continued to stare at the door. It was coaxing him in, he knew it was, but he couldn’t do much to break himself from the temptation besides turning tail and running away. If it
“Don’t be like that, Tommy! You must understand, I am simply curious about that… what was it that dear Hadrian received? A letter? My, I do want to know what is in that lovely little letter. Won’t you tell me, sweet thing?” The locket cooed, its wide, bloodshot eyes twinkling as its grin sharpening, only widening further as he glowered hatefully. The locket had burst down the door between them just as Harry had thrown his fist into the wall of his bedroom, which Tom considered nothing but the faintest reprieve from his consistent annoyances. Fate must have been pitying him, in the very least, since it meant that the locket hadn’t been there for the initial reading, and Tom had managed to keep the contents of the letter mostly a mystery, at least until Harry had gone and opened his fat mouth about it being from Lucius Malfoy.
Draco rolled his eyes a second time as Bagman’s voice boomed through the stadium, the conversation apparently over as the other two of his party both turned to watch the stadium. Harry considered Draco’s words for a moment, before turning to look at Fudge again. He was surprised to find the man’s gaze already on him as he whispered something to a diplomat Harry didn’t recognize. He narrowed his eyes at the display slightly, off-put by the expression on the minister's face. Fudge went pale once he noticed, jumping away from the diplomat and quickly patting at his waistcoat, looking flustered and off-kilter.
He shifted in place for a moment, contemplating the feeling of light wrapping around his prone form from where he laid deep inside his own soul. Of course, the Failure couldn’t help but take a few slivers of his soul out as well, carving away at the small pieces that he held so dear. It had left him weakened, and as Tom Riddle continued to return more and more slices of his soul were taken away. He could only assume that his failure to comply with the Failure’s demands had resulted in such pathetic attempts to tear him apart bit by bit.
“Good to see you too, Harry.” Blaise chirped, smiling as the unnaturally tall boy sent him a withering glare before his eyes creaked shut again, presumably falling back asleep immediately. Blaise sighed slightly, falling down across the seating with a groan. “Merlin, you two are painfully dull today. What’s got your pants in a knot?”
Harry shrugged, looking irritatingly pleasant as he did. “No guts to hurl, I guess.”
“How so? Is the animal it comes from near extinction?”
There was a sudden, choked sob from the Gryffindor table, but Luna didn’t turn to see who it was. She was watching Harry instead, as his soul flickered from anticipation to amusement. Luna felt a tad uneasy at the change. Harry knew something about that girl, more than likely having something to do with it too. She didn’t know how to feel about that.
He thought bitterly, noting that the first letter looked suspiciously like an ‘H’. He didn’t say anything though, knowing that he and Luna very clearly disagreed on the matter of Harry Potter.
He thought, twirling the lavender-engraved timepiece around a finger as he watched a butterfly—its wings a harsh green broken up by speckles of yellow—flutter into the room. It hardly mattered at the moment, since he would soon be at Hogwarts and worrying about the logistics of the coming year, but it was something he wanted to think about going forward.
answers about Harry's personal business. What he had wanted was to be

Luna shook her head, sitting back with a frustrated huff. She had

funny.”
“Why ask a question when you already know the answer?”
“Flamel Château.”
Instantly did those icy blue eyes dim into nothingness. The mindscape around them fell apart as everything crumpled, and before he could blink, darkness surrounded him. The man had disappeared, though his smile and his eyes were now forever entangled in Tom’s own.
It was
Twenty minutes and three bags of tea later, Harry felt the wall of ice around him slowly grow as he stared blankly at his cup of steadily cooling tea with absence, slowly stirring it with his spoon as his mind swam from one thought to the next. Ever since reading Luna’s letter the night before he had been feeling disjointed, somewhat separated from reality as if he had been forcefully removed from it. Lucius Malfoy’s letter certainly hadn’t helped, and now that he had calmed down from the initial anger all he could feel was… detachment. Confusion and frustration and detachment from everything else. He would call it horrible if he could even grasp the emotions. Was he going into shock?
Perhaps it was because of the countryside, with its breathtaking scenery that he had never experienced on Privet Drive or even Hogwarts, where he could breathe in deeply and feel calm and relaxed and free of all obstructions. Maybe it was the ancient magic in the air, unobstructed by blood wards or Dumbledore’s stifling magic that weaved itself through your hair and gripped your clothes. The air at the Flamel house felt light and breathly out in the hills, and the garden which stretched around the old home was so colourful and vibrant that something as stunning as a red rose felt dull in comparison. Sure, the air would grow hot and balmy in the summer sun, which would typically bring him a great amount of stress and annoyance, but it seemed that the unyielding cold his body now emanated seemed abated by the heat in a way that was shockingly similar to Draco’s encompassing warmth, and so Harry couldn’t help but feel for the first time that he belonged in that sweltering weather. Even so, if the heat became too hot for his liking cooling charms were in abundance inside the home, and iced beverages lined every available table on the more sweltering days where the charms didn’t quite cut it. And even after all that, he still found ample heat down in the workroom, where the heat of melting metals and boiling potions was oftentimes more warm and chemical than the air outside.
Harry’s eyes ripped open, and he whipped around to find… an empty halfway, void of anything but him. Harry felt half in his mind as his head whipped around the hallway, his eyes skating over every little thing as he searched for the voice. It had sounded so
“Don’t even try to say they are the same scenario, you bastard. I constantly refuse to give them all an explanation because I know all too well that they have
“Hngh… sod off.”
Sirius watched him duck through the doorframe with amusement, already making his way through the tailor’s shop as the poor seamstress manning the desk watched him with mild trepidation. Harry gave her a warry wave, before quickly setting off for where Sirius had snuck off to.
“And where are you off to?” She called, causing Blaise and Harry to both stop suddenly and turn to look at her. Harry blinked at the both of them blankly, as if he hadn’t been expecting anyone to call him out for going the wrong direction, before he sheepishly shrugged.
“Damn it Luna.” He hissed, grabbing for his wand with his right hand as he tried to shake the glitter off of his left. Unsurprisingly, his efforts were met with silent mockery from the glitter, which stuck firm. Waving his wand sharply, and with a muttered ‘scourgify’ under his breath, the majority of the glitter on his hands and desk disappeared, though he was certain that he would be finding many individual particles of the sparkling material all over his room for the rest of his time there. Sighing, Harry wrangled the letter free, spilling even more glitter onto himself and his desk. With a muttered curse, he brushed the majority of it off of the letter and left the rest, making a mental note to clean it off of himself after seeing what Luna had to say to him besides that she wanted him and all of his clothes to be covered with sparkles.
Harry felt his smile grow a little strained then, a little pained, and he had a sudden urge to throw his trunk to the ground and collapse in her arms, begging that he be allowed to stay there for the rest of time. It would be so,
“I see.” He replied quietly, eyes watching her every move as she started sorting through random things obscured from his vision by oversized skulls and her own body. “So I might die as well if I don’t take what you give me?”
“Where are you off to?” He called after her, eyebrows furrowed as Draco stood up, seeming as though he wanted to join them.
Barty couldn’t help but think, desperately wishing that he could force his way into the conversation. If only he weren’t so exhausted physically, or of a stronger mind mentally, then he might be able to throw off his father’s curse right then and there. If something were to happen at the World Cup, would he gain enough of an upper hand over his father that he might be able to throw off the curse?
time, not since he had revived that one fawn when he was a child. Something about the entire process hadn’t exactly felt right to him after that, and he couldn’t help but feel like he would be crossing the point of no return if he started using necromancy again. The magic was sickeningly addictive, and he had no idea how he would react to it now that he was, technically, an undead creature in his own right. No, that was a thought that he had pushed aside for contemplation at a

Marvolo gazed out at the rising sun, frowning as he walked farther and farther away from the hovell that he had been confined to for decades. He would not be so foolish to go after the soul shard or Hadrian Potter before he had gained back any followers that the man had left for dead, which was sure to take time and energy that was unavailable to him in his current situation.
“Mhm… some.”
The Parkinson estate was in West Sussex, and had a pompousness about it that she had at once been quite proud of. The sprawling country around the manor was nothing short of breathtaking, and the grounds around it were home to a wide variety of beautiful flowers and criss-crossing paths that wound around ponds with koi and the occasional turtle living inside. The interior of the manor was just as beautiful as the exterior, as it was home to the most exquisite decor imaginable, and was all tied together with paintings of past Parkinson Lords and Ladies that had walked those halls so many years prior. Really, the only places that could ever be considered more esteemed and grand were the Malfoy and Greengrass estates, though admittedly there were very few families out there that had drive comparable to the Ladies Malfoy and Greengrass, so it was unsurprising that the two were the only ones in the running for most grandiose home. Pansy considered the thought for a moment, wondering if there was some sort of causal feud between the two families. It would certainly explain why the heir and heiress of each respective house seemed intent on never getting along.
before. He couldn’t remember ever even being grabbed roughly, or touched in any way that wasn’t gentle. Firm, yes, but gentle. Blood drumed through his ears, and in an incredible moment of clarity Theo thought that he might just understand why Harry had done what he did. In that moment, he wanted nothing more than to rip his grandfather to
“Equivalence. The concept of equivalence forms each building block that makes up the foundational ideologies of modern Alchemy.”
“Yes I-yes, of course, Mister Potter, this is Oblansk-no, erm… Obalonskthe? I-I’m not well suited for Bulgarian names Mister Potter, I apologize. This is the Bulgarian Minister.”
Tracey gave her a pointed look, and Pansy glumly snapped her mouth shut as she watched the other girl walk along the old log. A walk through the woods had seemed to be fun enough for both of them, and she could admit that it was a wonderful change of pace from the places that they typically ended up having conversations in. They had gotten into the rather unpleasant habit of hiding out in small corners or cramming themselves into tiny cupboards in order to, ah…
Barty would rip the blasted thing out by the root once he was free.
Her eyes immediately lit up, and she set down the juice, leaning forwards with excitement. “Well, when you put it like that, I would be more than happy to help you with anything that you have concerns or questions about.”
—before he could even think to take it back. Tom did as well.
“And I want you to thank Sir Flamel for apprenticing Hadrian. It is a great honor, and such a thing does not happen very often. The last person to be apprenticed under the man was headmaster Dumbledore after all.”
The itch was still there.
Draco grumbled, feeling the heat slowly dissipate as his embarrassment receded. “You’re so bloody dense Harry, I do sincerely hope you know that.”
“Well, we certainly have time for an explanation.”
He stood completely still, gaze locked onto the area of space directly between his old apprentice’s nose.
“Well.” The man stood suddenly, taking off his right-hand glove as he rounded the table to settle next to Tom, holding out the now bare hand as if it was an offering. “I suppose my remaining questions will be brought to life within you, and eventually my part of our consciousness will be satisfied with the answers that we find.”
“As in
Well, he was still twenty feet up into the air, but stability was a very important factor in these sorts of things.
“I ask you this, Tom Riddle, and I beg that you consider the question before all this ends and my consciousness falls away into yours. Will Hadrian Potter be the cause of Ragnarök, or will he be Ragnarök itself? And, because I truly must ask, has he already become it?”
Barty Crouch, the dark mark, Lucius Malfoy… they all had one small thing in common.
“I would be happy to chaperone, of course!”
In his past few weeks of living with the Lovegoods, he had found himself strangely comforted by how…
lot harder than that to get into my bed, Potter.”
These two were likely the easiest to draw, because they're both based on (ripped off of down to every little detail) OCs of mine that I already draw quite regularly, though their personalities do not tie in with said OCs in the slightest. Just as a little note on the character reference itself, but I decided to type out Death and Fate's names instead of write them, to separate them from the other characters in that they are not tied to the mortal plane and never will be. They are, as far as the universe is concerned, seperate from the rest of the world, and this is shown through a separation between my terrible handwriting and a nice, plain font.
bode well for Draco’s future. He and Daphne had originally just brushed the rumors off as ridiculous drama—which is really quite common for the wizarding world—but when Blaise had stepped into the compartment only to see Draco acting so…
“The process of speeding or slowing or stopping the aging process of a certain thing’s spirit is based heavily on whether or not it is sentient. This is where the paths of true alchemy diverge into sentient or living, and non-sentient or non-living alchemy. If you wish to change lead into gold, it will be a different process than changing a monkey into an elephant. If you wish to make it so that the gold you created from lead cannot be destroyed, then it is a different process from making a human’s body stop aging. This is because non-living things do not age naturally, and therefore their spirit also does not age in the way that a tree or a cat will. The spirit of non-sentient objects simply will not change unless you force it to, while living things like shrubs and birds and people will naturally progress as time goes on.”
A few seconds later, the goblin that had been behind the counter came out followed by a slightly taller goblin that was well dressed and held a frown in his face.
“Sirius.” He tried in a firm voice to remind his friend that not everyone liked being dragged around. Not that he listened.
“So, don’t answer them.” It was said offhand, like it was no big deal. Hinting to Remus that it was most likely a Slytherin, meaning it was probably Luke.
“George I’m telling you that snakes skin will not make these taste better.” He looked at his twin who was grinning at him. “Nope, brother of mine, but it will make them glow pretty.” They both laughed.
After they followed the goblin out of that room, they were shown into a different smaller office. There was an elder looking goblin seated behind a large wooden desk. He greeted them as soon as they entered. “Misters Fred and George Weasley, welcome. I believe you have a letter for me.” They both nodded and George handed over Harry’s letter. They each took a seat in one of the two large chairs sitting opposite of the desk. They watched the goblin for a few minutes while he read over the later.
“Yeah mate,’’ Ron said shoving eggs into his mouth. “Tell us about it?”
Charlie’s eyes went wide. “He wouldn’t, they’re best mates.”
“They could be useful.” Malfoy said. Then looked at the single book, harry had placed onto the pile. When he looked at Harry with a raised brow, Harry felt his cheeks redden in embarrassment.
Harry jumped to his feet and backed away from it and the table the second his mind told him what it was. How could he have forgotten that he had given it back to the man after everything was done. He swallowed around air as he tried to will away imagines of the chamber, Ginny, Tom, and the basilisk.
Once he had them all in his arms he looked up and glared at a smirking Malfoy.
“It’s okay.” Fred said.
The Goblin took one look at the red webs and frowned.
“The letter, brother.”  His brother pouted at him, but unclipped the letter from the grumpy owl.
“Now, names?” He asked.
“Leave him.” He whispered, “I’m not tired,” He lied. “Plus I have a charms essay to finish,” not a lie, “he can use me as a pillow.” James gave him a questioning look but did as he was told.
“Of course Harry.” With that he hurried away from the other three.
“Are we allowed to change our minds?” He asked back, even as he pushed away the blanket and got out of the bed. He heard Malfoy mumble something but didn’t catch the words.
“They'll be okay, Black.” Sirius looked over at Severus who despite his words was running his hands through his own godson’s hair. He wanted to snap and yell at the bloody Slytherin but he didn’t. Not when he saw his own worry mirrored on the other man’s face.
Malfoy stayed close to his side as they walked up the grounds and into the school. He wasn’t sure if it was to make sure he didn’t say anything to Gryffindor they were following or if it was because he was just as nervous as Harry. Which ever it was, he found he was grateful.
With his emotions all over the place he was on the brink of tears when he walked into the common room. He stopped short when he found his dad and Sirius hanging out in the otherwise empty common room. His dad was sitting cross legged on the floor a book in his lap. While his godfather was sprawled out on the couch behind him. He let out a relieved breath, if they were here then Remus was okay. They wouldn’t have come back here if Remus was hurt.  They must have heard him because both of the other teens looked up at him. Sirius had a goofy grin on his face and James gave him a happy grin, both fell away ad they took him in.
He silently walked across the room, a skill he had mastered from living with the Dursley’s and then had used far too many times at Hogwarts, when he entered the bathroom, he closed the door and leaned against it.
“Shit.” He said as he caught himself from falling.
His mate glared at him, “Of course I'm with you, you idiot! I’m just pointing out how stupid this is. And that we will be on our own. Only Potter and his friends at our side, against two of the strongest wizards alive.” His mate took a breath, “I am just wondering if we have enough allies to win.”
Harry sent the blonde another grin and sat down at the table. He could tell that Malfoy was tempted to stomp over and yell at him but either his pureblood manners stopped him from making a scene or he was already plotting his revenge. Because the blonde sent him a glare then moved to sit as his own houses table.
“Here.” He said and enjoyed the confused look on Malfoy’s face. When he found they were standing in front of a wall and not a room.
Unable to get out of bed, Draco used his wand to summon a book off the table. He wasn’t sure how long he read, but he was a fairly good handle on how Time Tuner’s worked, when the body next to him shifted and then froze.
He grabbed his coat and pulled it on. Shoving the letter into one of his pockets, he used his wand to cast a notice me not spell, taught to him by his mother, over himself and snuck out.
“I don’t think we will understand, not until we can talk to them about it.” Charlie said, reaching out to take his trembling hand. Then Charlie took the potion and dripped two tiny drops into the cup, he put the top on bottle then grabbed the cup off the counter.
“It’s okay. I bet Sirius loves that someone is looking out for him. He never minded a bit of trouble anyways.” Hermione huffed but Luna gave him a blinding smile.
“Good.” The Animagus said softly.
“Congratulations,” he said, meaning it, he was happy for them. His comment must have caused Blaise’s to lose patience as the other teen moved close enough to look at the paper over Harry’s shoulder.
Then ice cold water spilled over the both of them and they broke apart.  Harry turned to glare at the other’s in the room. While Draco growled and went to lunge at his father, who was the only one with his wand out.
“Now are you going to tell me why we can’t speak to the headmaster?” Malfoy asked, “Would could ask him to be the tether or to set one up. After all we know he will be at Hogwarts in our time.” He looked over to see Malfoy studying him.
He watched as Potter rolled his eyes, “Give me a little while to see if it will work.”
“What are you doing?” A mumbled voice asked.
It would be perfect for what they needed.
Harry looked at his mother, “What was that?”
“Dearies?” The women called from the doorway.
“What?” He hissed as he walked towards the blonde.
He should be worried about Malfoy using this against him but instead he was clinging to the blonde like a life line, using the other’s steady heart beat to ground himself, to stop the building panic he felt building and he wasn’t sure if he regretted it. Because for the first time in months he felt he found someone to trust again.
It seemed Malfoy had been busy, he had written down a few accounts of people saying they had traveled in time and had even wrote down a few basic spells that were said to manipulate time.
“This is your portkey,” He said holding out an old piece of parchment.
Harry rushed to their room, he opened the door, waited for Malfoy to follow him in, then slammed it shut and fell back against it.
“Sorry, coming.” Harry called after her. He put his hand against his pocket, ready to reach for his wand should he needed it, and he heard Malfoy moving behind him. It should have made him nervous having Malfoy at his back, but the truth was this town scared him more than the blonde.
Neither of them of them had an owl of their own to use.
“Thanks.” He said reaching up and taking the hand. The person grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet with surprising strength.
Nott was the only one to acknowledge him, with a small nod before the burnett turned and started talking to Goyle.
He tried not to shift his body as he tried again, again the sleeping blonde tightened his hold when Harry tried to remove his arm
Not that it put this weird morning cuddling thing out of his mind, because he knew soon or later Malfoy would mock or tease him about it, and he knew that if he reacted in any way but indifferent it would be come a thing.
After a moment they pulled apart.
“I’m afraid, Mister Snape, I can not tell you until each of you as stepped into the circle.” The goblin’s black eyes stared up at him.
“Umm…” A quiet voice asked, causing both of them to look over at the stunning olive skinned Slytherin, Fred really wanted to get to know better. He was sure his brother would agree, “Kill who?” The both chuckled.
“It’s
Malfoy gave a short nod, “But not yours?” He asked looking up.
“We can’t…” Fred started,
Harry looked at him, “To?”
“Now, as for money.” The goblin said, handing them two different pieces of parchment, “This we have planned for, you fill these out, and we set up a vault, no connected to your families, we place an allotted amount inside, that you have access to. We will keep track of what you spend and if need be add more, “The goblin took a second, “Then when you return home, the amount used is removed from you vault to pay back the bank.” Harry looked down at the paper, in his hand. “If, however,” He head Grimmhook go on, “you do not find a way to return, you have until that times comes naturally to you, to pay back, the amount.”
Charlie snorted, “Probably.”
“We need you to drink Veritaserum.” He said evenly as he picked up the cup and handed it to his brother. Bill looked at the cup then back at the three of them clearly confused.
“Can you give them marks that look like they are from the metal cuffs?” He asked instead of telling the man he was impressed. He hadn’t thought about making it look like the two boys had fought back. It was smart, neither Harry nor Draco were the type to sit back and let someone hurt them.
“I’m going to go find James.” Sirius said before turning around and rushing off down the hall.
The blonde nodded, “It will do.”
“Oh.” They said, looking back at each other trying to think of something else.
Malfoy let go up his arm and went to speak to a nice elderly man, that had moved to greet them when they entered the shop.
This message is a way of getting your attention and pointing you guys to my Website, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr. Where you can follow me, for updates, sneak peeks, and ask questions if you have any. Hopefully this will work, and I can gain a fan base for my original stories.
“Luc--”
“He knows where Harry is.” The wolf said. Lucius wanted to roll his eyes, that was not a smartest way to start this conversation. Black growled, apparently getting the wrong idea.
“Bill,” Charlie said, pushing off the couch.
Lucius Malfoy sneered at him but did not raise his own wand.
Logically he knew he couldn’t do anything. He could hug his parents or attack Peter but he was worried that when it happened he wouldn’t think about it logically and that he would just react.
When it was done, they would send a message to the twins and Charlie, who would apparate Harry and Draco in. While this was going on Remus and Bill had to head back to Grimmauld Place. They would conveniently be there when the call came in that Harry and Draco had been found. They wanted people they trusted as part of the rescue. And Severus had to return to Hogwarts so that Dumbledore didn’t get suspicious.
“Pettigrew will be insulted. And his friends will take his side.”
Fred wiped a tear from his cheek and turned to hand the letter to his brother, who in return looked stunned over the letter he was reading. When George finished, they exchanged letters and now he found himself reading over Lily’s Will.
“I do not believe that Albus Dumbledore was aware of Mister Potter second vault as he never received a key for it. So, all of Mister Potter family’s person belongs are still intact.” The goblin stood up and walked around his desk to stand in front of them.
They both understood what the goblin was saying, but it still felt wrong. Fred looked over at George, “Should we?” He asked. His twin looked at the envelopes. “If it’s as important as it sounds, “George said with a sigh, “Then I think Harry would be okay with it. As long as we can give them to him later?” The last bit was said to the goblin who nodded.
That most have been the wrong thing to do, because the other boy whimpered and tried to bury himself deeper in to Draco’s back. Unsure what to do, he tried to free himself from the other’s arms. He got as far and removing the arm before the smaller boy left out a soft whine. A wave of distress came off the Gryffindor and Draco found himself unwilling to force the other away again. So, he maneuvered himself on to his back, and the sleeping body next to him moved with him. They ended up with him on his back and Potter’s head on his chest.
The blonde man looked up at them from his seat on the farthest couch, “I do not.” He said, then seemed to consider something, “But with the two of you here, I am starting to get an idea.”
Again, he noticed the blonde was watching him, he felt his skin tingle and tried hard not to fidget at the uncomfortable feeling that started to grow. Being around Malfoy has always irritated him, but this was different.
He tried not to laugh at Percy’s squeak.
The goblin tilted his head in a slight bow, “One moment.” Then he turned and disappeared behind some large doors.
He could hear Potter’s footsteps behind as he sat down. The other teen sat down and Draco had to fight back a grin, when the other couldn’t meet his eyes.
And while this summer had been uneventful, there was this nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach that something was coming. Something bad. Of course, with Voldemort out there, the feeling didn’t come as much of a surprise him. It was the sense that whatever it was that was coming had little or nothing to do with Voldemort that worried him. His nightmares seemed to center more on the unknown and less on the madman, leaving him with a foreboding feeling.
Fred as only slightly annoyed at Malfoy’s timing, he tried not to frown as he opened the door. Though he shouldn’t have worried because he gasped in surprise to see not only Malfoy standing there but Remus.
His pulse raced and the urge to back away, suddenly become one to run. HE gritted his teeth and made himself remain where he was.
“I…” He tried but when he looked up at Snape the man had a look in his eyes, they narrowed when Harry met them and the urge to cower or run slammed into him so hard that he actually felt his body start to move.
After that he let the sheer exhaustion from the day, pull him under.
“Hey.” He said moving over to hug Percy. His brother stiffened in his arms but only for a second before he relaxed and hugged him back. “Hey.” He heard Percy mutter into his shoulder before they were attacked on both sides by their younger brothers.
He sighed and opened his letter.
“Harry, do you understand what just happened?” Snape asked.
His brother looked back at him, “Thefts? If I thought someone else had access to our vault that’s what I would be looking for.”
“Where are we headed anyways?” Sirius asked as they started walking again. And Remus shook his head. Only his friend would ditch practice to track him down to ask a question, he could have asked later, but was to impatient to wait. Then not pay attention to where he was being dragged off too.
“What the bloody hell, is going on?” Malfoy demanded from the small table he had sat in front of.
He needed to talk to Sirius or James. They might have an idea about what was going on. His two friends weren't hard to find once he entered the Great Hall. James was flirting with Lilly or for her part looked a little bored, but she kept smiling at James. Remus knew it was an act. Every time the redhead acted a little bored with his friend, his friend would do something outrages to get her attention. He shook his head and felt himself calm down a little at the familiarity of the room.
He looked at his brother, who just shrugged and followed after the goblin. He sighed and caught up to his brother, “If we die, it’s all your fault.” His brother chuckled.
“Dumbledore.” They said together.
Malfoy must have figured out that something was wrong because he raised his brow in a silent, what happened?
This chapter also upped its word count by about 400 words. So, that's good too. Enjoy.
“I know,” he said meeting his mate’s eye so the man knew he meant it.
His brother sighed, “Or mine.”
Fred put the cup down on the counter and reached for the kettle, “I don’t know. Our family, Mum, Ginny,” His brother gasped, “Ron. they have been using Harry. And he trusted them.
“I can practically hear your mind working, what is it?”
“Kin.” His brother answered his unasked question, “at least I think. I didn’t get any scales, my eyes have never changed but my mind work faster than normal and I have an almost perfect memory. From the research I’ve done, Dragon Kins are known for higher intelligences.” He shrugged, “I was never really sure, but if you and Bill are both Kin and the twins are Azenab’s, I fit the Kin descriptions more.”
“What kind of prank?” A different voice asked. Causing him to look up behind him as James, Sirius and Remus joined him at the table.

“Dragon,” Lucius whispered, “I know, and I understand but I need you to think.” Harry watched as Draco seemed to look at his father confused before he shook his head and looked back at Harry.
“Shut up.” Malfoy hissed at him.
“I asked the castle to remember that room. So, we can come always get back into it. Even leave stuff there for later.” He said and started walking away.  He heard Malfoy’s hurried steps as the blonde rushed to catch up to him.
“I don’t know.” He answered.
Severus was not avoid the headmaster, no matter what the old bat said. He just didn’t feel the need to spend his evening listening to another insane theory about what happened to the Potter brat and Draco. He sighed dropping down onto his armchair.
“Potter.” There was a growl hidden in his name and Harry looked up to see Draco’s eyes shift to their cat like form and he swallowed. He must have really zoned out to get that kind of reaction out of the blonde. He looked at Blaise to see that even the other slytherin looked concerned.
He watched as one of the Weasley twins knelt down over the box. He felt worried as the young man handed out letters to everyone in their small group. He had to will his hands not to shake as he took his.
"I am not." The blonde spoke as it was beneath him to do such a thing and Remus had to bite the inside of his lip not to throw out a comeback Siri would be proud of. Instead he lowered his wand and waited.
Bill shook his head, “No. Why?”
“Me too.” Blaise said.
Soon he couldn’t just smell and feel Draco, he could
Harry was covered in sweat and hungry, by the time, he reached the bottom of the hill. Whatever magic crap had transported them, had left him in a lot of pain. He hated travel by magic, unless it was his broom.
“He might not be able to stay.” He said once he found himself in a sitting room. Lupin shoved Black down onto one of the chairs and pointed to the other, telling Lucius he could sit. He thought about not doing it but the place seemed clean and it would be impolite not too.
The blonde looked offended that someone could have done this. It was that look, the look of disgust on Malfoy’s face that caused the impact of it all to hit him. Because right in front of him was a Slytherin, a student whose father followed Voldemort, someone who was cruel and a bully, and that someone was disgusted with what was done to him. How horrible would something have to be to offend a Malfoy?
“I’m kin, Dragon,” He explained quickly, letting his brother go to hug George who smiled at him. “What I don’t understand, is why your Azeban and I’m Kin.” He told them after he let George go.
“Shit, breathe Remy.”
“Hogwarts.” Again, both him and Malfoy spoke at the same time, coming to the same conclusion. Grimmhook wanted them to go to Hogwarts.
.” Malfoy said, crossing his arms over his chest.
“You two shouldn’t be wondering around, with out an adult.” The women muttered as they followed behind her, “Your parents should now better. Not with You-know-who attacking everyone. I mean that attack last week outside London, “She tisked, “Horrible, 22 dead.”
“Snape.” He muttered and looked over at George, now understanding the stunned look completely.
“I’m not sure.” Severus said, “Sex, is the usual connecting point. But you two have been rather close while Harry was struggling to emerge do to the bindings, it is possible that the bonding link formed slowly over the time you were in the past and only strengthened as the last of the bonding fell away.” The man closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “You smell bonded.”
In their bedroom George had shoved both of his brothers towards the fire place. He picked up floo powder and said, “Shell Cottage," as he tossed it into the fireplace.
New chapter :) Please let me know what you think. I'm debating doing more from this pov but want to see if you guys like it first.
The next morning they sat at home, the black box on top of their work table, while they sat on their couch with a bottle of fire whiskey.
Fred frowned, “What if we ask him to take it? He is our brother he should trust us.” George snorted. Fred opened his eyes and grinned, “Okay, so most of the time he shouldn’t trust us, but if we tell him it’s important, he will.” His twin nodded.
“I have summoned food for three for several days, and gave him a few distant defensive marks.” The blonde said when Sirius entered the living room behind him. The dark wizard was standing behind Owen who was passed out on an old battered couch.
“I’m sorry.” He whispered, “I just hate they way they make you feel.”
Igorth must not have cared much about his responds because before he could utter a word the goblin placed the necklace over his head and when Harry felt it settle over his chest there was an electric spark that shot through him.
“And not only did they do it, they made me their silent partner, they send me free samples all the time, and always ask how i’m doing.” He took a breath, “I think they care and that they are my friends.” He looked away, because if he was wrong, they would be stuck here.
“What the hell is that?” Malfoy said, reaching out and running his fingers along the fabric.
“Thank you.” He said. He stood there for a second, unsure what to do.
“Thank you.” He said to the woman. Then tossed the powered.
“First we need to see if it’s just him.” His brother said quietly, not liking the idea of doubting their family. George groaned. “You don’t think dad or Bill knew? And I know Charlie wouldn’t have. He doesn’t even really know Harry. Percy hasn’t been around--”
He sighed, as badly as he wanted to spare his family from their fate, and put a stop to Voldermount before he could kill more people or do anymore damage, he had no way of knowing the consequences. Some things he wouldn’t mind changing, Sirius's years in Azkaban, Dumbledore's manipulations, Ron and Hermione lying to him, and his life with the Dursleys. But he couldn’t chance that someone else died or faired worse just so he could save himself from pain and heartbreak.
“That no one knows about.” Charlie said cutting him off, a smirk on his face. George nodded.
“Fine.” Luke snapped back. “but he will be. It’s like him to lecture and teach.”
“Evan, if you want to be alone. You can tell me to get lost.” Sirius said calmly.
Jexa took his arm and did the house elf version of apparition. He found himself standing just outside a small worn down building with a dark sign hanging over the door. It was a cafe he had never heard of, with a sigh he waved the elf off and entered the building. It took him a second of scanning the surprisingly crowded inside before he spotted the sandy haired man he was looking for.
Both twins looked at each other then the goblin confused, why was that a bad thing?
Harry is finally back at Hogwarts, but things are they way he expected.
“The ritual.” The blonde huffed, “I found all the pieces, even started a list of things we needed, only we can’t perform it.” Harry’s pulse quickened.
As he approached the front door, he felt the wolf in him raise its heckles. He slowed his step and when the wolf let out a growl in the back of his mind he turned around wand in hand and pointed it at the student following him.
“It changes. Depending on what you need.” Harry said, looking around the room. It was kind of simple two long couches and two arm chairs, set around a large circular table. Candle and lamps set around the room lighting it up bright warm light. To Harry surprise the far back wall was covered in bookshelves. There had to be a couple hundred books lining the shelves and Harry wondered if they would be useful in their search.
They were led to a large room, where two couches sat across from each other, the only other occupant of the room had both of them freezing in the tracks. Not that the goblin noticed.
“I know.” Potter said again, staring at his legs.
It was Remus that started chuckling, “I think he fears you have corrupted one of his Slytherins.”
Of course as he thought it there was a knock at their door. He heard his brother sigh before he pushed off the couch and went to the door.
It didn’t take long for him to find Malfoy. The blonde was still in the library reading a book Harry didn’t recognize. Harry slipped behind the Slytherin and poked him in the shoulder.
Charlie reached out to stop him, he didn’t want to force Percy. But before his hand could touch his brother the twins grabbed him and pulled him back to the couch, giggling as all three hit the back. He heard Bill snort from in front of the fire place before he stepped into and disappeared in green flames.
Luna froze as the cheers grew louder, interspersed with the occasional shocked yell and improper expletive. She didn’t pay any of it any mind, too focused on memories—dreams, she rather thought—no, the nightmares that she had been haunted by in her first year as they suddenly shot out to the forefront of her mind. Harry—this was something to do with Harry. Her head snapped up, and she stared out past her housemates and towards the familiar golden-green of Harry’s soul.
“Blast.”
“Oh, mais sa cicatrice Gabrielle, n'est-elle pas étrange?”
“You don’t like those chains very much, do you Locket?” He cooed, reaching a hand out and brushing it across the thing’s bald head tenderly. “You must want out of them, hm?”
in Theo’s best interest.
“Yes, Harry, it is! Especially if someone is walking around calling you their
Draco let the smile win out over his common sense as Harry howled with laughter, falling back against the plush couch cushions as his joyous voice echoed through the sitting room, his previous anger and Draco’s own concern well and truly forgotten as Draco grabbed for a nearby throw pillow, intent on getting revenge for the embarrassment he had experienced, regardless of if Perenelle made them clean up the scattered feathers afterwards or not.
“This is different. I’ve already said that.” He whispered, pleading silently to the still air around him as his instincts fought a dirty battle against his logic.
It was a slow walk towards the west wall, even slower when he occasionally had to let go of one bookshelf to grasp another. Upon reaching it however, all thoughts of his discomfort and unease flew from his mind.
“Yes.”
He took a seat across from her, and grabbed the wine bottle away from her outstretched hand and poured himself a glass. “He is out there still, milling around. Now, I have no doubt that his patience outlasts yours Olympe, so please tell me what the issue is so we can solve it diplomatically.”
“Uh… Gabrielle, I don’t think Draco knows any Fren-”
The simple truth was that Locket, as well as the cup, were both much too small as soul pieces went to have been capable of keeping their sanity intact for very long. They had lasted about a year or two each, though the decline had been much faster for Locket than the cup, which was more of an unresponsive pile of vaguely human parts than anything. Tom himself had only kept his sanity and physical form intact because he had absorbed not only Voldemort’s wraith, but the diary horcrux as well, who the locket seemed to have named Tommy at some point. That absorption had brought him up from a mere slip of soul to over half of the whole, and had saved him in every respect.
He thought to himself curiously, setting the envelope onto a stack of other opened envelopes on the counter as he unfolded the letter. Turning away from Xenophilius’ nosy eyes, Theo quickly began to read through the short letter, struggling at some points to understand the jerky script.
Harry felt slight irritation surge through him as the old man continued to deflect the questions. “Well? What is the issue then?”
“I love you, Harry.”
“I will, I promise.”
He stepped further inside it, hands heavy as tiny fingers gripped his own, tight and sure. The knowledge of what was real and what was his mind’s fabrication blurred until he was unsure if he himself was real, and the moon overhead burned with green fire just like that of the killing curse. All around him, whispers of happy children and loving families taunted his dwindling sanity, pulling and unfurling the strings of restraint until there was nothing-until
“Harry, it isn’t Barty that I’m worried about, it’s what his freedom represents.”
Draco shook himself, ignoring the subtle flames flickering across his collar and cheeks as he set Harry’s letter aside to read again later before grabbing the second one. He hadn’t been sure who it had been from at first, as he had quickly recognized the surname Delacour but not the first name of Fleur. Perhaps she was one of the many daughters of the Delacour family? The estate was certainly widespread enough for one of its many children to escape his notice, though he had admittedly been paying very little attention to his mother when she had been attempting to teach him about French families when he was younger, so his scope of knowledge was likely less than satisfactory in that particular department. Sighing lightly, he tore the peach-colored envelope open and yanked the letter out, wrinkling his nose at the smell of floral that emanated out of it.
Familiar. So impossibly familiar.
She decided very suddenly that he should take several moments to contemplate all the reasons he was upsetting her, and stood sharply from where she was sitting. “So, if you would prefer, I will leave you to this shallow pond so you may be with the company that you can more relate to, and once you decided that you do not lack so much of the depth that you wish for me to believe, then I would like it very much if you would join me where I will be sitting in the sun. Good day, Theodore.”
He didn’t find much though, watching as Harry turned into, seemingly, a lump of wood.
“No use contemplating the thought when I can just try it.” He muttered, stalking forward with a curious gleam to his eye. The locket froze, its bloodshot and bleeding eyes wide and confused as he gained ground.
to think it was alright, if that means anything.”
“Yes!” She squeaked, immediately climbing up onto the couch and rather brazenly clutching his arm. Draco made a noise between amusement and annoyance as she did, and Harry quickly leveled him with a look that he hoped was slightly pleading. Draco merely rolled his eyes, before turning away. Taking that as an agreement, Harry let it go, rubbing his eyes with his one free hand as Gabrielle clutched tighter to his arm.
He watched every twitch of his eye and clench of his jaw as he slowly, methodically, read through the letter. Harry’s bedroom was silent spare for the tapping of his shoes against the wooden floor and the distant noise of crickets outside his window, the darkened night sky giving no assurance that they would see the morning anytime soon. Harry almost wished that the morning would never come, because if that happened they would have to somehow return to their lives as if Draco’s wasn’t falling down around his ears.
“A tad tipsy are you, darling?” She questioned, taking a rather slipshod sip from the champagne bottle as poor Lucius swayed for a moment, his thoroughly sloshed brain working tirelessly to try to form a response.
The soul shard shrugged, leaning back in the bloodied chair it was confined to, the shackles around its wrists, ankles, and neck jangling with the movement. When it had burst through the door so early in the morning, brandishing sharp teeth and sharper claws, Tom had just about cried out for help from Harry, and would have if the boy hadn’t had his fist an inch deep in the brick wall of his bedroom.
Because that was the truth, really. He was the horcrux in Hadrian James Potter’s head, and he had absorbed the remnants of Voldemort’s soul when the man had tried to take over the infant boy so many years ago, not the other way around. Because in truth, he embodied the remnant grief of Lily and James Potter as Voldemort murdered them before attempting to kill their son, not Voldemort’s own feelings of triumph. He was the byproduct of Lily Potter’s sacrifice, and for that his consciousness had been built around the need to keep Harry safe, no matter how much he had fought that instinct in the beginning.
“He had such pretty eyes!”
loud, though perhaps he wasn’t giving his inheritance enough credit. If he could hear whispers from a room away, it was reasonable to assume that a crowded stadium would be nigh-unbearable to his sensitive senses. He sighed, before reaching up and plugging his fingers in his ears, hoping that most people would simply think that he was trying to avoid any embarrassment by the Veelas’ dancing.
“How did you sleep Hadrian? I know you drank far more than a young man of your age should.” She pat his arm kindly as he shook his head, waving away the concern as a glass of cool water casually floated into the space in front of him.
There were so many noises, so many movements and sounds and smells, he couldn’t keep track of one over the other. Disjointed blips of conversation assaulted him from every angle, every little squeak of a shoe or shifting of a cloth grating against his ears as if they were explosions going off right besides his head. For several minutes, he lost it all in the fog of noise, unable to grasp onto one thing over another as the voices got louder and more excited and loud loud
standpoint, is one of the more infantile metals, and as is the case for all other common and surface-level elements. Copper is above it in spiritual strength by a wide margin, but is still quite far from more pure and ancient metals such as silver and gold. Iron is much the same way as copper, as is nickel.”
“You ought to be getting downstairs now, Leech.”
“Then don’t, Olympe. Your duty as a headmistress far outplays Albus’ wishes, no matter how small those wishes may seem. Perhaps, if he truly wishes to have this girl come to Hogwarts, you should direct him instead to her parents? If they are the ones that need to be convinced, then the entire matter is out of your hands.” Nicolas replied placatingly, before taking a long sip from his glass. It certainly sounded like something Albus would do, placing someone in a position where they had to choose between their duties and his wants. Olympe had never made him aware of a situation like this, so it was very likely that it was the first time she was having to deal with it. Nicolas sighed, before reaching into his blazer and taking out a handkerchief, which he then handed to his old friend like an offering.
“Oh but his scar Gabrelle, does it not look peculiar?”
Perenelle : Ah, un maître de potions en herbe? Je dois admettre, après que Nicolas a pris Hadrian, j'ai souhaité avoir mon propre apprenti. À quel point es-tu douée?"
Draco sighed at the thought, settling further into the plush couch cushions as Harry continued to silently seethe. He could feel an instinctive urge to help his soulmate tugging at his side of the rosary, but forced himself to ignore it. If he was going to get any sort of progress done with his creature inheritance, or his looming disownment, or even just schoolwork once school started up again, then he would have to trust that Harry was mature enough to sort himself out.
Death raised an eyebrow, his towering frame not unlike the tower of babel as it reached into the heavens. Voldemort was unafraid of the force that now existed in front of him, knowing for sure that it wished for him to be its master. It was clearly unsatisfied with Hadrian Potter and wished for him to recover the Deathly Hallows from the boy. That was the only possible explanation for it to bring him back to form and function.
“I… I’m fine.” He croaked, his shoulders beginning to shake as his grip suddenly loosened, and in a single, swift movement his face was buried in Harry’s collar, his sobs barely muffled by the soft cotton of Harry’s blazer. He wrapped his arms around the sobbing boy tightly, pulling him closer as his body continued to shake, his hands gripping at Harry’s sides so hard it nearly stung.
“Then just show me the fookin’ letter, damn it!” Draco shouted, his chair clattering to the floor as he leapt up from the table, his hair askew and messy and his eyes feral.
“Bloody buggering-fuck!” An unexpected and completely unwanted attack on his person by a very aggressive tree branch very nearly threw him out of the massive oak, and Draco cursed again under his breath as a forceful brush of wind against the side of the tree swayed him nearly parallel to the ground. “Go out into the woods she said, leave mother to her needlepoint she said. Well, mother, I have left you to your wretched needlepoint, and now you will likely lose your son for it, I hope you’re happy.”
He took another deep breath of air as his eyes finally settled onto the soulbond, the rosary, and his heartbeat began to slow. It was still there, right as rain. Harry was okay. Draco sighed through his nose, before leaning back onto his headboard and examining the bond as carefully as he could. Harry was alive, that much was clear, but that didn’t mean there wasn’t something wrong. If he paid enough attention to it, he might be able to figure out what was wrong.
Without warning, the imposing figure of his lord suddenly turned, and Barty froze stiff as eyes—as bright and horrific as the killing curse—pinned him in place. Wide and monstrous, the eyes gazed out into the forest behind Barty, analytical and daring as the imposing man reached down suddenly with his one free arm to pin the shorter person—a boy, it looked like—beside him in place. Barty sucked in a sharp breath, his mind barely comprehending that decadently sinful shade of deadly green before his eyes traveled slightly upwards to lock onto a faint paleness along the man’s forehead.
“Too much?” He hissed, shoving an accusatory finger in Harry’s stupid,
(See the end of the chapter for
Nodding to himself, Harry forced his thoughts away from the stinging sensation, turning to look once again towards Barty Crouch, who was still very conveniently cowered in the corner. He forced his shoulders to relax—forced his entire body to stop shaking—as the one heartbeat in the room started to slow. He just… needed to plan. He couldn’t let emotion lead him down the wrong path again. He just needed to keep his instincts in check, no matter how hungry it made him. He just needed to keep those he loved safe.
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic sits upon nine acres of land in an undisclosed location in the south of France, near Cannes, and overlooks a cliff. The view off of this cliff has been widely considered one of the most stunning in the wizarding world, second only to the glittering streets of El Dorado in America. The Academy has a large, rectangular, man-made lake just outside the entrance, which is home to a very large swan, who was affectionately named Clarence many years prior. The gardens are vast and elaborate, home to a variety of flower and plant specimens that have been planted over the hundreds of years that the academy has been a place of learning. While these gardens are cared for primarily by fairies and by sprites, it gets a helping hand from the Academy’s grounds and gamekeeper, Rèmy Vieuxpont, who tends to the stables and also helps to teach horseback riding as an extracurricular class.
be normal since the Dursleys weren’t there with him in France, but it felt like things needed to be that way. He needed to start slowly separating himself from them, if only for their own sakes. It felt like the wizarding world would do his family no amount of kindness, and he wasn’t one to let them needlessly get hurt for his benefit.
It seemed that the second he thought that, his entire body lurched and he was thrown forward, shooting out a specific opening with a shocking speed. Draco somehow found his footing, stumbling slightly as he emerged out of the purple flames along with a rather substantial amount of soot. He let go of both the trunks in an effort to steady himself, coughing as the soot attempted to get into his mouth and lungs. Something screeched-maybe a chair-and the sound of nearing footsteps erupted through the new space he had found himself in.
Tom gave one last, painful-sounding cough before righting himself, his reddened eyes narrowed at the far wall with anger as his hand still sat pressed against his mouth and nose. Harry watched as he stormed closer to the western wall, his magic gathering in the air around him like some sort of protective shield. Harry watched him go with a mix of concern and curiosity, partially confused with what was even going on and why Tom was bleeding and smelling and tasting things when he never had before. Sure, he had bled before, but that was only after attacking another piece of his soul and getting attacked back for it. He was incapable of being injured by anything other than himself.
“Time passes Albus, and not all things can be forgiven, especially so soon after they happened.” He replied, making an effort not to glare as his nails dug into the hard oak wood of the office’s door. “I believe it is reasonable of me to say that you are no longer welcome near my home. Goodbye.”
Splintering out from behind those inky black tresses of hair were sharp spikes of a pale scar, zig-zagging along a predestined line of fate as it danced along the man’s skin and tore through his eyebrows, separating the black hair there and carving indentations into his flesh, ripping away at his skin as if it were the sky gods ripping the heavens apart with their fury.
"Il avait de si jolis yeux!"
She shook herself, turning to look at the girl walking next to her with concern. “I’m sorry about my brother Tracey. I don’t think Nigel ever really figured out the concept of manners.” The other girl nodded carefully, turning to look at her in a way that made Pansy think that they were both well aware that her oldest brother certainly would have remembered the etiquette lessons of his youth if Tracey was not who she was. Sadly for both of them, it seemed that her blood wouldn’t be changing anytime soon.
Draco bit his lip, leaning to the side and resting his head on the back of the couch. “It's not quite like that, though it felt that way at times. Honestly, I don’t know what’s going on either. It feels like they both found out about something bad, but I can't imagine what it might be and neither of them will even look me in the eye, much less tell me what they’ve been up to. Hell, father wants you to write to him apparently, whatever reason that is for.”
He nearly stumbled at Draco’s voice, whipping around to find the other boy with his nose stuck high up in the air, eyes squinting judgmentally towards the ‘ghastly’ creatures.
Albus Dumbledore was utterly
Tom grunted, grasping Harry’s shoulder with one arm to steady himself before throwing the other one out into the general area of the iron door. Harry could vaguely make out Tom’s distinctive blood red magic cracking through the air like lightning, and slowly relaxed as the picante taste to the air eased off.
“And you’ll write me each day, and tell me what the two of you are up to. Hecate forbid I sit idly by while you get into trouble in France.”
Eyes made of ice.
“Well... he’s teaching me alchemy you see-”
of my head.” He snapped, whirling around only for his eyes to settle onto the door again. He stared at it for only a second, feeling like he was holding himself back from doing something terrible. He grit his teeth, fighting against the instincts urging him to
He stared up at the ceiling, body utterly drenched in sweat as adrenalin raced through him. Sucking in a sharp breath, he scrambled up into a sitting position, eyes wide and vulture-like as he looked around for any sort of danger. Draco didn’t know what woke him up from the nightmare, Harry’s emotions seeping through the bond or his own fear. Maybe it had been a mix of both.
His body stood on its own accord, and his muscles and bones strained in protest. His eyes unfocused, blurring into a vague mess of colors as the invisibility cloak was pulled off of him from somewhere near the floor. His legs moved, against his own wishes, and began to walk towards somewhere he could not discern. That was another unfortunate part of the torture that was the imperious curse. When someone under its spell was being maneuvered by its caster, their eyes blurred and there was nothing that they could see. This meant that, even in the times that his body was allowed to walk and eat and drink, when he was finally able to relieve himself or bathe, he was unable to see anything but vague blurs. And, once the chore that was keeping his body alive was done, he was forced back down into the same sitting position, staring at the same overgrown fingernail, and forced to wait for the next time that his sight would go blurry.
Her laughs tapered off a bit, not enough to stop as she shook her head jerkily, her white hair flipping through the air erratically. Harry got the feeling that he didn’t understand near enough about the universe, and she was well aware of it.
In the past, he had paid little attention to the soulbond, in most cases because he was usually unaware of it, but other times simply because there were other matters afoot. Now though, he was acutely aware of it, so aware of it in fact, that it was the only thing he seemed capable of focusing on now that he was properly awake.
He still doubted that the ring had managed to gain a body. The timing just seemed far too coincidental to be true. Really, was it so likely that the day after Harry Potter left the British Isles the horcrux of Voldemort was given a new form? It seemed far too…
How many times had he used the imperius on innocents during the war? How many times had he used it without question, without even considering what kinds of potential it had as a torture device? If he were able, Barty would laugh bitterly, and continue to consider all the things he would force his father to do once he had escaped from this agonizing existence. Maybe he would force the bastard to skin himself alive. Slowly though, and jerkily. A somewhat fast, if agonizing, death would be far too sweet for the wicked man. Perhaps Barty would just lock his father up in a dark room, leaving him there without food or water or light. No, he would bring the fool food and water, but wouldn’t let him relieve himself. Yes, that was an excellent idea. Barty would make his father feel exactly what he felt right now, but without end and without relief. Would his body try to force its way despite the curse? Or would his muscles cramp to painful amounts, his body being forced to refuse its own needs?
“Harry…?”
He did smile then, sad and tired and so, so horribly angry.
“Your full name.”
He watched as the death magic came closer from where it had entered, it’s glow revealing a little light from the outside, wherever that was. Feeling more so than doing, he forced his limbs to move and reached upwards with his one good arm, his fingers brushing against the wisps in the faintest of touches.
“I’m Theodore Nott sir, your daughter invited me over for the summer?” He stumbled to his feet just as the man let out a low hum, returning to his side with what looked like a damp cloth.
“Daphne, why does this matter to you?” Harry sighed, looking more worn and tired than Blaise had ever seen him. A spark of concern fought against the amusement churning around inside him, and despite his best interest Blaise began to wonder what Harry had on his mind that would make him so exhausted.
Theo cursed under his breath as his curiosity slowly won out over his caution. It probably wouldn’t kill him just to take a peek, right? And the floor of the stationary shop was stone, he could probably use it to defend himself if something lethal occurred.
“I’m afraid I haven’t until today. My family typically uses portkeys when we travel internationally.” He replied, fidgeting with the cuffs of his coat as he spoke. His heartbeat was thumping like a drum, hard enough that he could feel it right there. Draco glanced at Harry's hands, mentally cursing as he saw the familiar ring proudly on display there.
“Sometimes. Though, it happened more when I was younger.”
“Oh my stars, that’s Mad-Eye Moody!”
“Do you like it?”
Draco laughed, leaning forward slightly as he nodded. “Yeah, nearly fell out of the blasted thing too.”
Nicolas Flamel?” Her surprised shout made him jolt, and he blinked at her gobsmacked expression with confusion. Before he had a moment to reply, the girl at his leg let out an excited little squeal and stepped away from him to also stare in shock. “Whatever for?”
He pushed the memories aside for the moment, nodding slightly as Nicolas moved across the room towards the philosopher's stone, which sat elevated in a glass case with protection runes inscribed into it. Harry followed behind him cautiously, taking a moment to observe a shelf full of exclusively the black liquid.
Over forty years of study piled up around them, and Tom wasn’t privy to any of it.
“Lucius, you are starting to concern me, dear.”
"Cicatrice...? Oh! Ça doit être Harry Potter! Le garçon britannique avec la cicatrice en forme d'éclair, non?"
“How do you keep doing that.”
If not for his own sake, then for everyone else’s.
“I understand that you are dealing with some… territorial disputes, but Barty
“Very good, Winky.”
Locket howled with anger as Tom grabbed the back of the seat again and started pulling it towards the door, deteriorating from hysterics to insanity as it lost all humanity it had left, thrashing about like a caged dog as he dragged it deep into its own mind, chains and all still keeping it tied down to the chair that was quickly turning into a small, maddening confined prison.
Jolting upwards with a start, the sheet fell away to reveal two wands pointed in his face. Acting on instinct, Harry fell backwards again, slipping over the tangled sheets and crashing to the floor as two flame-based spells were fired in the place his head had been. He cursed, more screams of indistinguishable French phrases filling the air as he threw out his arm, ice encasing it and much of the air around him as more fire erupted.
Perhaps he was growing just a bit too attached.
That’s when it hit him.
He let his eyes shut again, feeling in his bones that this next morning would be nothing short of excruciating. Sure, it was probably impossible for him to experience frostbite, but thawing himself out each morning would be not only a pain in the arse but a massive waste of time.
“Listen very carefully, you murderous sycophant, because I will only say this once.” He hissed, continuing forward towards the back wall as the man nodded aggressively, a near-whimper escaping his throat as Harry let go, watching as he crashed back onto the floor with a dull thump.
“Mhm… vines trying to strangle clouds. Very messy, yet unconstructive at the same time.”
“Don’t you like your vessel, Locket? You rave on about it all the time.” Tom replied cheerily as he finished off the door and bent down, picking up the downed doorknob and examining it. He would have to sort out some of the dents, but he had just barely enough magic to manage it. Yes, he could manage it easily.
The shouts were getting slightly more distinct. Draco tilted his head slightly, his nose scrunching up in concentration as if he was thinking very hard about something. He was hearing it too now, Harry was sure of it. He turned away again, eyes pinned on the area of forest they came from. Waiting. Watching.
It had taken all of five seconds for Sirius to immediately cancel any sort of excursion into the throngs of muggle Paris after having been there, the smell of urine being far too overwhelming for him to stand. Harry had found himself agreeing with the idea as well, strangely enough. Perhaps it was his rather sensitive senses in general, but even without needing to breathe, Harry still found the air to be practically
The door opened up into the garden, overgrown and forgotten to anyone but mother nature.
“The cup isn’t even conscious!” Locket screeched, quickly returning to his thrashing as Tom started to test all his keys on the door. “It doesn’t have enough soul to it to even comprehend emotions past sadness, much less things like movement! Tom-please, brother, don’t do this to me, I’ll go mad!”
Harry sighed, picking up a few leaves of the Anjelica herb before carefully, gently ripping off a few little pieces, adding the flakes to the angrily sizzling brew as gently as he could manage. The reaction was not instantaneous, but there was a bitterness to the air that seemed to turn from just bitter to particularly acidulated as he added more and more of the Anjelica herb, and Harry couldn’t help but clear his throat slightly as his vision clouded to near-opaqueness and the cauldron disappeared behind a wave of smog.
He had been reborn again to kill those in his way, those standing between him and greatness, so why was he holding back? What was he waiting for that was so necessary to his purpose? Death had brought him back to life, certain that the twisted murder he had been born from would aid the gods in destroying Hadrian Potter. Had he shown
“Luna?”
Tom didn’t reply at first, either too busy formulating a response or contemplating if it was even worth it. Harry certainly thought it was, as he fought his own mental war, waging a final, climactic battle between using Barty Crouch’s appearance to his advantage and the overwhelming urge to tuck the issue away in the Flamel basement where it could rot for the next few years.
So that’s why he had found himself leaning up against the side of a French townhouse as waves of people flew past, a few paying him small amounts of attention before moving on. Magical Paris was utterly breathtaking, and if Sirius wasn’t so late he would feel much better about enjoying it.
the thought of if they really were just rumors started to itch at him.
the ever-impassable fortress of passivity that he was, in this way, Draco was certain that it couldn’t be good. With a jerk, he took a step inside the kitchen, eyes locked onto the stiff form of his soulmate as his heartbeat drummed through his ears. He felt something clawing at the inside of his chest, hot and furious as Harry nervously fiddled with the handle of a teacup.
“Oh.”
He clenched his hands into fists. How dare the entity attempt to control him! He was the great lord Voldemort, and if he was not then he was… he looked down at his hands, watching as the morning light struck what he now knew was the resurrection stone as it laid inside the golden ring band on his finger. The horcrux tilted his head, studying it for a moment, before letting an uncontrollable jolt of glee race through him.
Draco: "And you are far too young and... female for him to ever see you in a romantic way, so I suppose I have far better chances, hm?"
Do you
“I… okay.” He muttered, not sure what to do besides agree as his lord moved further ahead, leading the charge up the narrow path they were walking. Instead, he focused on walking as the noises of night and wildlife rose up around him, reveling in the unfamiliar feeling of autonomy as he walked of his own accord for what felt like the first time. It was a truly wondrous feeling, one he knew he needed to get used to if he had any desire to be of use to his lord once again.
He wondered distantly, slowing to a stop in front of the half-closed door as another voice rose up from inside. He stopped for a moment, momentarily caught between his concern and manners, before throwing it all to the wind and silently pushing the door inwards, eyes scanning the room for anything out of the ordinary. He stopped short as he caught sight of Harry in one of the chairs, with a look of utter exhaustion across his face and Perenelle, standing over him with her brows furrowed and a hand resting on his shoulder.
“Many modern alchemists, those who have formed their own perceived notions of equivalence, have attempted to place laws around how equivalence can be reached. The first law, of which they title ‘alchemy's first law of equivalent exchange’ states that one cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.”
she had to have had some sort of vision. You heard how she was screaming, right? It's the only explanation!” He muttered, mind racing as he watched his own feet pace back and forth across the old floorboards. One of the blasted things kept creaking, likely due to being loose or unstable, but Theo couldn’t bring himself to stop pacing or try to adjust his path through the kitchen. The room was small enough that there was barely enough room for him, the kitchen island, and Xenophilius as is, so it would be difficult to try and step around the creaking board. It was horribly annoying though, and was starting to grate on his patience.
“Yes, that’s exactly right. We should wing it. Nothing will ever come of planning for improbabilities when you can merely curse the improbability till it can no longer move.”
At first she had chalked it up to the incident with Harry and the dementor, and then-after she heard that he had been locked up all summer long-she thought that perhaps he was just lashing out due to the seclusion that he had been forced into. Then, of course, she had found out about Loki, and everything had gotten that much worse. She didn’t want to consider what would happen if the god decided to force Blaise to do anything more, and her boyfriend seemed insistent on ignoring the thought as well.
“Your heart is beating really fast.” Harry muttered, and Draco realized he could feel it against his skin. The ring, pressed up against his cheek, was beating along with his heart, fast and loud and
Shifting so that his shoulders were pressed gently up against the trunk of the tree and one of his legs was dangling lazily off into the open air, Draco quickly found the letter with Harry’s familiar flowing cursive font and studied it for a moment, feeling for a bump in the parchment that told of something more than paper inside. Ripping it open, Draco felt his excitement rise as something glittering fell from it and onto his lap. He grabbed for the glittering thing immediately, holding it up to the light with blatant curiosity.
“Harry,” he spoke suddenly, almost without considering it. “Let’s not have any children.”
“However, this simple concept is flawed, and betrays the concept of true alchemy, which has been lost to time. Of course, those of us who are timeless and therefore capable of remembering true alchemy and the ways that it functions, walk not the middle road.”
Harry sighed, finally leaving his tea alone as he let go of the small stirring spoon and set the cup down onto the table, knowing that the tea was already lukewarm at the very best. He looked up to Perenelle as she sat down at the table across from him, her hands cradling an identical cup of steaming coffee.
Knowing…
“Voldemort.”
They bounced ideas off of each other for a few hours after that, trying to brainstorm ideas for what they could do about the issue before actually facing or even confirming that it was in fact an issue. It was about nine in the morning that Harry found himself officially waking up, the warm sun now very clearly in the sky. He groaned, flexing his fingers as he stretched out like a cat in the desperate attempt to gain more maneuverability in his limbs. It hadn’t been nearly this hard to wake up each morning when he had been sleeping only a few feet away from the human furnace that was Draco Malfoy, but now that he was in a room that didn’t get much heat in the first place… well, he was wondering if asking for a room with a fireplace would be a good use of his time.
Searing, unimaginable pain screamed through his soul, disrupting every sensor and attacking every phycological nerve until he was writhing in agony. The golden-green strings surged forward, multiplying by the second as they forced his soul back together. He screamed louder, feeling as every little inch of him was overtaken and forced to rewind and come apart only to be reformed together again. Every millisecond was utter agony that he felt as his very existence was rewound and reworked.
His shoulders shook, a mangled sob finally wrangling itself up from deep within his throat as Nicolas’ arms came around his shoulders, pulling him into an awkward sideways embrace that was equal parts uncomfortable as it was grounding. A hand rested gently onto the back of his head, carding wrinkled fingers through his overgrown hair slowly, gently. Someone spoke-perhaps Perenelle-in French, some sort of muttered lullaby that seemed to drown out the static and memories. It was something sweet and mournful, like a gentle embrace in the middle of a funeral.
“Three…”
“He did, did he not?”
It didn’t take him long to find the man, but at that point Sirius was well and truly in the thick of it, merely handing several articles of clothing to him wordlessly before moving further along a wall of dress shirts. Harry rolled his eyes, feeling like a glorified coat hanger as he was handed a long turtleneck and two pairs of skinny jeans that looked so small that even Draco couldn’t manage to slip into them.
He was leaving France in twenty minutes.
For a few seconds, at least.
Regardless of his harsh tone, Draco was smiling, a familiar blush trailing up his neck and eeking out around his cheeks, so Harry supposed that the decision to preemptively make nice with Viktor had been the right one, if only to breed life into Draco’s fiery personality, one that had been dwindling into cinders over the past month.
That being said, I decided to draw everyone in casual outfits instead of the usual uniforms, because at this point you all know what that looks like and I really wanted to show everyone's personalities in a more visual form, which you can't do when they're all wearing a uniform designed to make everyone look the same.
Tom replied scathingly, driving home his displeasure with a familiar, aching pain that branched out from his hairline and spiderwebbed down his face and neck. Harry shivered at the attack, brushing at the skin of his cheek as the sensation slowly fizzled out. He frowned, rubbing at his jaw contemplatively as Tom continued to mutter obscenities from deep within his conscious. Harry didn’t remember the pain ever branching out that far. The farthest it had ever gotten was the tip of his nose, where the longest branch of his scar ended. Why was it now sneaking down his neck?
Luna was dizzy.
