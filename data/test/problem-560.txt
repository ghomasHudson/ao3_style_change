When a cool voice requested that all passengers prepare for take off, they stood with their Portkey held between them, a small and rather ugly statue of a ceramic toad squatting on a mushroom. It began to glow faintly as a 10-second countdown appeared in glowing blue letters in the air. Draco looked at Harry, his hair a perpetual mess and his eyes bright with excitement, and had a wild, fleeting second of uncharacteristic spontaneity. Harry gave him a wonderfully crooked grin, catching their pinky fingers together around the Portkey, and Draco opened his mouth.
“Tell him we’ll be there,” Ron had responded before promptly disappearing from the room and putting a rather effective end to any of Harry's arguments.
Draco sighed. “I’m sorry.” He looked past Harry’s shoulder into the garden. “The party looks lovely. Did I miss the cake?”
Draco regarded him coolly, his deep grey eyes sweeping Harry's face. After a moment, his mouth quirked up on one side and he reached behind him to set the books on the counter.
Harry stood shirtless in the kitchen, downing a cup of water, boiling hot from his run. A mirror hung on the wall above the dining table, showing the incredible results Auror training and running had had on Harry’s physique; gone were the bony shoulders, visible ribs and grey paleness of the War – now, Harry’s coffee-and-cream skin glowed with sweat, his arms were strong and muscled, and the dark hair on his chest ran down lean abs, bypassing scars and disappearing under the waistband of his shorts. For the first time in his life, Harry could look at himself and understand that he looked
Potter’s tone was just a little too low and rumbly, and his sweet whisky breath tingled across Draco’s neck. He felt his already warm face flush a little darker and he discreetly undid the top button of his shirt.
The table drinks had been replenished a couple of times, and the forced politeness between his friends and Draco’s had relaxed with each new cocktail consumed. It helped that Hermione and Parkinson were already close; before long, Ginny had enquired where Pansy’s lipstick had been purchased, and then Pansy had pulled the tube out from where she’d wedged it in her cleavage. (“Undetectable extension charm,” she’d winked at Harry; he had almost inhaled his cocktail umbrella by accident.) Now Hermione, Ginny and Pansy all wore that same shade of purple-red, their teeth flashing even whiter as they giggled in the corner.
“My life is in the wizarding world, Draco,” Harry said quietly, his words sounding louder in the silence.
with how much he wanted to fold himself into Draco’s arms and never leave. The moment was broken, however, when he hiccupped violently.
Harry waited until Draco’s breaths were deep and even, and then he brushed his lips against the shell of his ear.
I’d like my parents’ wedding rings,” he’d requested at the end of the meeting as he shook hands with his Financial Adviser. They were delivered a few days later by a magnificent (if a little terrifying) eagle owl. His mother’s ring had been a delicate white gold band with a pretty sapphire in the centre that had no doubt set off Lily Potter’s pale skin and red hair beautifully; his father’s was a simple and solid platinum ring that sat heavy in the centre of his palm. He’d almost fancied that he could felt a whisper of their magic as he examined the rings, running the tip of his index finger around them reverently.
. There’s a faint tracery of veins at his left temple where a light sheen of sweat’s collected. Absurdly, I want to lean over and lick it.
He startled slightly when the door opened, whipping around to see Potter standing in the doorway, one arm above his head, pulling his loose white t-shirt up slightly to reveal a strip of café au lait skin. Potter had lost his pinched, post-war look and had become deliciously lithe, leanly-muscled with a sharp jaw and strong forearms that made Draco’s stomach squirm a little.
Neville and Goyle had sequestered themselves at the other table, talking about, of all things, how to keep Goyle’s fussy magical calatheas alive. Harry had been most nervous about this pairing, because he remembered the way Neville had described the relish with which Crabbe and Goyle wielded the Cruciatus Curse back in seventh year: with what had happened to Alice and Frank, Harry had been unsurprised by the depth of Neville’s fury. But somehow, despite the deep, wounding hurt of the past, there the two of them were, discussing potting soil and drainage and feeding charms.
Hermione put her glass of wine down and regarded him archly over the wing-shaped glasses she sometimes wore for reading. “Yes, two months." Her tone said the topic was closed. "Now," she continued, "why are you panicking so much about this birthday party, Harry? You’ve been a bit… manic all week.”
you’d shag me all the time if you could. But we get busy and we get tired and we find other ways to be intimate.” He burrowed back down into the covers, turning around so his back pressed against Harry’s chest, pulling Harry’s arm around his waist. Harry’s fingers automatically slipped under Draco’s t-shirt, twirling through the silvery-blonde happy trail on his stomach. “You always kiss me goodbye before you go to work, even on early shifts when you think I’m asleep. You spoon me in bed when you get in from lates, I fucking
Draco was still a little stiff, but he relaxed as the afternoon went on and wound up discussing – of all things – the debit card payment system he had at the bookshop with Arthur. (“About half the customers I have are using their debit cards instead of physical Muggle money these days.” “How ingenious of them!”) When the cake came out of the kitchen, Draco’s face lit up, and he praised Molly’s baking skills as he tucked into his slice, making her cheeks flush a proud rosy red.
Despite the challenges, there had been a few moments already where Draco almost blurted The Question out: when he’d spotted the sheer joy and incredulity on Harry’s face as they looked out on the ancient ruins of Patallaqta, the sun cocooning them in a haze of warmth; when they entered cloud forest and spied hummingbirds flitting through the trees like tiny colourful Snitches; when they snuggled together in their tent, achy legs tangled…but none of them had felt like
“When we got together, I wasn’t expecting anything like that,” Draco continued quietly. “You told me that you loved me and it was the only thing that mattered
“That’s a shame,” Draco mumbled. Harry’s heart tripped before Draco continued quickly, “for the readers of Witch Weekly I mean. Britain’s Most Eligible Batchelor another year running and he doesn’t want to date.”
And so, when Draco decided he was going to propose to Harry, he knew it had to be special. In the moment when Draco knelt before Harry with the engraved gold ring he'd had made, he wanted Harry to feel all of Draco’s admiration and commitment and love for him. He wanted Harry to know that Draco wanted to grow old with him, that Draco wanted to see him be happy and tired and angry and sleepy in the morning, that Draco wanted all of Harry, and for Harry to have all of him, even the brittle and spiky parts.
“Harry,” Ron said, once he was able to breathe. “You know Hermione and I don’t mind if you’re into Malfoy, right? Wait, maybe that’s the wrong way of putting it. We support it?
Harry smiled softly. “Hey.” He shifted over, giving Draco room to sit next to him against the headboard. “They belonged to my parents.”
Harry walked over to the armchair by the fireplace, grabbing the thick Aran blanket that Draco had stylishly flung there when he moved in. As he draped it over Draco, Harry took in the slackness of his face in sleep and the darkness under his eyes. He felt a wash of tenderness that had him biting his lip to keep from doing something stupid, like kissing Draco’s forehead or smoothing a hand through his shimmering hair. He grabbed Draco's cloak to hang up, knowing how irked he'd be if he woke up to find it wrinkled and creased, remembering to avoid the creaky floorboard outside the room.
There was the familiar sensation of a hook behind his stomach and the rest of Draco’s words were left behind as they span through time and space.
Draco nodded and Francis moved on, walking over to where Luna was rooting through the earth near her recently-collapsed tent and Ernie was rubbing his eyes desolately. He clasped Harry's hand, twining their fingers together as he led them slightly away from the group.
Ron paused in taking a bite of his pastry (an act Draco knew held great significance). “Well, blimey mate. About time one of you did.”
“She’ll come around.” Draco’s smile faltered a little. “But it doesn’t matter. This is what I want. I shouldn’t have run off yesterday but I was…well, scared I guess. You’ve become one of my best friends over the last couple of years and I didn’t want to ruin that. It took Ron telling me that he wished he’d acted a bit sooner with Hermione to make me realise how much I really wanted to try this.”
balls deserved a break from dinner trousers, firmly thumping Harry on his back when he promptly choked on his tea.)
On their fourth night, they were woken up at 3am to get ready to hike to the Sun Gate in time to see the sun rise over Machu Picchu. Harry grumbled as Draco set a soft Lumos to float above them, running a hand across his face and bringing the blanket – charmed to stay warm throughout the night – up to his chin. Harry was the night owl to Draco’s early morning lark; his post-Hogwarts love of a clandestine lie-in had slowly morphed into a habit of never waking until the last possible moment. Draco had been irritated by it when they'd first moved in together, as he was often the one to try and coax Harry up in time for their shifts at the DMLE, until Harry’d explained that the habit had been borne out of a rebellion against the many years he’d been woken at the crack of dawn by the sharp rapping of Petunia’s acrylics on his cupboard door.
While Draco was definitely feeling the altitude, Harry was having a truly horrendous time of it, even though they’d spent the previous week acclimatising in Cusco. They had bought teas from the shaman in town to try and help; Draco had initially marvelled at the way they used coca leaves, pronouncing it
Hermione grinned. “It’s got a battery inside it, similar to the ones in the Walkman I showed you before, but you charge it when it gets depleted rather than swapping for new ones.”
Harry had settled on the other end of the sofa and unconsciously pulled Draco’s foot into his lap, earning him a slightly raised eyebrow and a small grin that showed off that ridiculous dimple in Draco’s right cheek. And Harry’s heart started beating a mile a minute because in that second, as Draco smiled at him warmly and went back to reading, Harry wanted – with an intensity that burned - to reach over, knock the book from Draco’s hands and devour him in a bruising, claiming kiss. He wanted this to be more than friendship, much
Draco nodded, dropping his hands from where they’d twined in Harry’s hair. “Yes, that's probably best.”
hadn’t outgrown pimples) or the way his t-shirt would ride up when he put the clean dishes away after dinner, revealing two dimples in the small of his back…
. I told her I was quite assuredly gay and that low-rent Legolas wasn’t really my aesthetic, and she hasn’t come back to the shop since.”)
Harry pushed him with a laugh. “You’re such a prat.” Then he pulled him onto his lap and shoved his nose into the juncture where neck met shoulder, the scent of bergamot and citrus and musk filling the hollow in his chest until Harry felt like he might burst from happiness. He mouthed at the soft skin, the very tip of his tongue drawling swirls that made Draco sigh breathily and press a kiss to his cheek.
And Harry had gone back to the table, although he felt a flash of irritation when he saw his seat next to Draco had been taken by Ginny. He spent the rest of the evening dropping in and out of several conversations, but none of them were with Draco. He'd wanted to explain that all Draco had interrupted was a friendly conversation and nothing more. But when it came time to leave, Draco simply threw him a lopsided grin and Apparated with a sharp crack, and Harry tried to ignore how it made him feel a little hollow inside.
Their third date had been dinner at Draco’s, Harry feeling right at home in the cosy but charmingly shabby flat above the bookshop, with its hardwood floors and proliferation of threadbare rugs. The little white cat, who Harry learned was called Mabel, had twined around Draco’s feet as he cooked a seafood linguine and tapped his toes – clad in bright fuchsia socks – along to the radio. After they’d eaten, Draco had poured them both a glass of wine and, picking nervously at the cuffs of his (spotless) white shirt, he’d told Harry that
He stood up, sliding his robes off and hanging them on the coat stand, just in time to see Ron's expression of incredulity. And he could understand why: gone was Harry's usual uniform of casual-grunge attire (just because they'd ushered in a new millennium and Holly Valance had taken both the wizarding and muggle worlds by storm, didn't mean Harry was ready to ditch the plaid). Instead, he had put on his fancy dark green button-down (the one that made his arms look amazing, according to Ginny) and black jeans (the ones that made his bum look amazing, according to Ron) and he'd even had his hair trimmed (in the way that made his cheekbones look amazing, according to Hermione).
“Leave off, Potter,” he muttered irritably as he shook red wine off his hand. “You’ll make it worse.” He tutted once before spinning on his heel and stalking off to the gents, leaving Harry reeling slightly. Yes, it was an unfortunate start to the date but it had clearly been an
Friday drinks at the Leaky had well and truly become a tradition, to the extent that Tom always pushed together two tables at the back for them and usually had a bottle of Draco’s favourite red breathing for when they traipsed in.
“After all,” Ron had told him, his mouth somehow already full with what looked to be around half his serving of pie, “I made it through three birthdays before Mione and I split up. I’m basically a present-giving pro.” Harry thought briefly of the many,
Harry snorted softly. “I miss you.” He hadn’t meant to say anything but the words came out before he could stop them.
. When he felt fingers slide under his t-shirt and lips move down to his throat, Harry thought he might catch on fire from how hot his blood felt in his veins. And when their erections pressed together, his eyes rolled back and he had to bite his lip to stop himself coming in his pants like a teenager. They stumbled up the stairs to the first floor, to Harry’s bedroom, dropping kisses and clothes as they went.
Draco cocked his head to the side as if thinking, but Hermione spoke before he could respond. “There have been studies to suggest that wizard-borns can affect some metaphysical changes in energy, when they take part in muggle magic circles.”
Draco smiled. “I guess it’s all subjective,” he replied. “I love Harry and I want to be with him forever-” (“Awww!” “So sweet!” “Draco that is disgusting.”) “-and I don’t need an hour-long bonding ceremony and a signed bit of parchment to prove that.” He leaned forwards to take another sip from his wine. “My, this conversation has become very serious. We’re in our twenties! It’s a Friday night! We should be shitfaced and dancing in a club somewhere.”
It was during his year off between finishing his Eighth Year at Hogwarts and starting the Auror training programme that Harry had finally got around to hiring a Financial Adviser. (The fact that Hermione had told him to do so with the same steely no-nonsense air she’d had when presenting him with a personalised Eighth Year revision schedule had no bearing on his decision whatsoever, thank you very much.)
Draco sighed as Luna waved them over to where the rest of their group was standing. He dropped his forehead to his boyfriend’s and let out a low groan.
His friends weren’t completely unused to venturing out in Muggle London, but they did still look like fish out of water as they followed Harry into the dimly lit, rather crowded bar. Ron pointed towards the back, where Harry could just see Hermione’s wild cloud of hair. Weaving in and out of people, trying not to knock anyone with his proliferation of gift bags, he led the way over to where the rest of the party sat on high stools grouped around a few small, impractical tables crowded with drinks. The music was dulled somewhat in this area and Harry wondered if it was because of a furtively-placed charm or just well-chosen seating.
There’s a knock on the door and I release a breath I didn’t know I was holding. I school my features into a look of casual calm before opening the door. Harry’s got a bunch of flowers and a bottle of Ogden’s and a crooked grin. A warmth rushes through me and settles in my stomach.
Harry chuckled. “You always had such a flair for the dramatic,” he teased, softly shoving into Draco with his shoulder. He was delighted when Draco nudged him back. “Do you like it? Working at the shop?”
“Of course I do,” Draco responded quietly as he shuffled over onto his side. “I grew up a wizard. Every waking moment was spent surrounded by magic. There’s a piece of my life missing, but everything in the wizarding world is…”
Harry grabbed a handful of silky shirt and pulled Draco close enough to plant a sloppy, sticky kiss on him. “There, there,” he murmured, relishing the small, throaty chuckle that Draco gave.
. But it’s been six months and I can’t let go. When he turns up at my door, my pulse thrums and my mind whirls and I can’t think about anything but tearing his clothes off and sinking my teeth into his perfect golden skin.
even though he'd still have the occasional prattish moment, at least he now acknowledged when he was doing it. And there was something about the way he looked now, with his hair no longer slicked back stiffly, softening his features; Harry’s stomach would twist oddly when Draco would allow a rare smile, a dimple forming in his right cheek.
An audible sigh of relief travelled around the table. Harry’s heart seemed to have dropped into his stomach and tied itself up in knots.
Draco pulled back a little and bit his lip. His eyes were wide, glassy with drink and joy, and his hair was sticking up a little on one side where the party hat had finally given in to gravity. The pretty blush, that vein in his temple, the smell of bergamot and citrus that tickled Harry’s nose… his jeans were starting to feel like a straightjacket.
Harry pursed his lips together, trying not to laugh at the bright spots of embarrassment high on Draco’s cheeks as he gently stroked the supremely unconcerned Basil.
“You alright Malfoy?” Ron asked, taking in Draco’s paler-than-usual face and wide eyes and deciding against offering him a Pasty.
Draco shook his head and stopped trying to count the waiting room tiles. “Sorry Weasley, I’m just a little distracted.” He paused. “I’m going to ask Harry to marry me.”
The conversation flowed as they ate, everyone laughing and talking over one another, subjects taking sharp turns into new tangents every few minutes or so. The food was – as always – absolutely delicious, and the heat of the late afternoon sunshine made it feel as though they were in a honeysuckle-scented bubble.
“Yeah,” Ron agreed, taking another bite of cake. “Teenage Ron would actually hate me, but I have to admit he’s a bit of alright.”
Two weeks later, Harry stood in their bedroom, the ring box open in his palm. The soft afternoon sun caught on the white gold band and glinted off the sapphire embedded in the centre, making it look like it was giving off its own light. Harry wondered how it was that such a small thing could cause him so much hassle.
He paused in his writing but didn’t look up, the pen poised above the page like a guillotine about to drop.
Ron clapped Draco on the shoulder. “You don’t need it, Malfoy. I always knew you were it for Harry.”
He led them to the third cabin, a wooden hut with a roof that appeared to be made from woven palm fronds, and two hammocks strung up above the small deck outside.
Harry had chuckled – he was rather cute, if the line was a little corny – and added the bloke’s drink to his order.
The Fitzrovia Tavern was more of a traditional boozer than the fancy gastropub that Harry had anticipated: the checkerboard floor was a little sticky, and the wood-panelled walls made everything seem darker. It smelled like beer and ready salted crisps, and in the corner, a rowdy darts game was being played. Harry spotted a shock of white-blonde hair. Draco stood slightly off to the side of the bar, staring into a glass of red wine as if it was the centre of the universe. He wore a simple white shirt and the same jeans and shoes from the other day, except this time his socks were a rich, peacock green. Harry wasn’t usually the type to take note of people’s clothing, but even he couldn’t miss the way the shirt stretched across Draco’s broad shoulders and hugged his biceps.
She stepped to the haphazard pile of clothes on the floor and plucked up a black shirt and a pair of dark grey skinny jeans from the heap. Grabbing her wand from the worn leather holster around her thigh, she gave it a quick flick and the clothing righted itself in mid-air, every wrinkle and crease disappearing under the strength of her laundering charm.
in response; Harry couldn’t help but feel a bit rejected, even though he knew Draco had to work remotely on occasion.
“Why don’t you guys have a bit of a nap, get changed, freshen up, we can meet in the dining hall in an hour or so to have some food and go over your schedule for the week?”
, that Harry couldn’t quite put his finger on which made him feel like he’d lost something: gone was the easy touching that had set Harry’s nerves alight, the shoulder nudges and one-armed hugs and drunken leanings. Harry had invited Draco out for lunch once, and received a short
It took a second, but when Draco gave a small smile in return, it made Harry’s heart sing softly. “Okay. Harry. And this isn’t the
“Excuse me,” Draco muttered as he extricated himself from the couch as gracefully as he could, feeling light-headed. “I need a drink.” He swept his gaze quickly over Harry’s face and imagined he saw a flicker of disappointment.
Rolling onto his side, Harry’s gaze swept around the bedroom, bright in the moonlight, albeit blurry without his glasses. He’d done his best to tone down some of the eviller vibes in Grimmauld Place since taking up permanent residence in the townhouse, but this bedroom was the only one that had really been finished. It just seemed that there was always something else to add to his never-ending list of things to do, like Transfiguring the serpent door handles and shooing out the ghouls in the attic, or encouraging some of the more cantankerous furniture to not kill his guests.
.” He took a deep breath and then gave a small, crooked grin. “This might be the worst date you’ve ever been on, but at the very least you could call me by my name.”
A short update, but I do finally have a plan for finishing this. Thanks to everyone who has stuck with it and/or read any of my work!
Ahead of them, Luna, Neville and Ernie Macmillan passed a flask of coca tea between them (oh how Draco had truly started to loathe coca tea) as they walked with their guide, Francis. Draco had been somewhat surprised to see them standing at the start of the trail on their first day, as he and Harry had met with Francis the day before in Cusco and he’d told them it would only be the three of them in the group. Francis, a Peruvian squib with a fantastic smile that beamed frequently in his burnished red-brown face, informed them cheerily that Luna, Neville and Ernie had booked last-minute and would be joining their hike.
When he would come home from a day spent stoically weathering people’s scorn and suspicion, Draco would scrub down the kitchen or the bathroom, losing himself for an hour in the methodical cleansing of the space. When he had a bad nightmare, he would take a thousand-piece muggle jigsaw set and fit each tiny piece together until he had a whole, completed picture. When he and Harry fought - albeit a lot less often than before - Draco would rearrange his books or polish the pieces of Black silver they’d taken from Grimmauld Place or sit in the forest green leather armchair in their small library and make lists; lists of people, with no discernible connection as far as Harry could see; to-do lists and lists of potions ingredients and shopping lists and, once, a list of places he wanted to visit, muggle and wizarding alike.
It was a known fact of both the magical and muggle universes that sunny weather in London was to be enjoyed with a healthy dose of suspicion. Despite this, Harry Potter found himself caught in a brutal spring downpour as he meandered down a wide, tree-lined side street in Fitzrovia. Having left his wand at Grimmauld Place and woefully inept at casting a wandless
“You’re so frustrating,” Harry said before he even realised he was talking. “You don’t even see how bloody attractive you are.” He instantly wished the ground would open up and swallow him when Draco blushed violently and his sharp grey gaze met Harry’s.
Harry kneaded the sore muscles of Draco’s back with well-practiced skill, soothing the knots and kinks from another long hard weekend spent Curse-Breaking somewhere in Snowdonia. Slowly, he eased off the pressure until Draco lay soft and pliant under his hands, his back rising and falling gently with his relaxed breaths.
“Because…I want you to come to Ministry events with me, and I want us to go to Quidditch games together, and have drinks with our friends at the Leaky Cauldron and the Hog’s Head, and- and, have tea at Madam Puddifoot’s—"
Harry burst out laughing, the sheer ridiculousness of it all finally hitting him in one giant, rolling wave. “Oh Merlin, we really are morons.”
waking up to find you pressed against me like that. You always make time for me when we get a Sunday off together. When those things stop, then I’ll worry.”
He’d felt a flash of guilt as he realised he hadn’t really ever thought about his parents’ personal affects. He’d seen the crumbling cottage at Godric’s Hollow, had stood at the threshold of his parent’s marital home and hadn’t even thought to ask if anything had been spared. (In fairness to him, trying not to get killed by an evil noseless megalomaniac did take up a lot of brain power.)
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, holding the tea out. Draco took a sip with a grateful nod before answering.
was echoed by Kingsley Shacklebolt himself. After that, he was largely left in peace to expand his knowledge of wine from colours to grapes and vintages, and learn new skills in Auror training, such as not running headfirst into danger and the official way to write a suitably dull report.
Merlin, I thought I was going to have to fellate the utensils all night before you got the message.”
“I am,” Harry answered, moving to sit next to his boyfriend. He reached over and planted a soft kiss on Draco’s cheek, frowning when he felt him tense ever so slightly. “Are you okay?” Harry asked as he drew back.
Draco, having come to the realisation that the only son of Lucius Malfoy probably had about as much choice in his role in the war as Harry’d had. On top of that, Harry imagined being housemates with Voldermort and his
Harry felt a little tug in his chest as he closed the letter back up. He placed it with the others and slid the whole lot into his bedside drawer. A part of him wanted to keep reading, to devour all of the other letters Draco had decided to finally share with him, but he had an overwhelming urge to gather his boyfriend close. Whatever worries had been flitting around Harry's mind all day evaporated as he slid over to spoon behind Draco, who made a muffled noise and snuggled in closer until they were pressed tight to each other. He was surrounded by the warmth of Draco’s skin, legs tangled together, the delicious, faint friction of his cock pressed snugly to Draco's arse.
been a while, hasn’t it?” Draco murmured as he placed one hand on Harry’s stomach, smirking slightly when the muscles jumped on contact.
Draco’s shifts varied depending on the projects he was working on and Harry’s training was ramping up as they edged ever closer to their Auror examinations, so they didn’t see each other all that often. But if Draco left the house first, there’d usually be a cup of tea – perfectly milky and just the right amount of sweet – under a stasis charm in the kitchen, waiting for a sleepy Harry to descend on it eagerly. Harry, in return, would stop by the bakery off Diagon on the Saturday mornings that they both had off and grab some of the pastries that made Draco moan in ways that should be illegal. (Not that that was the reason he did it.)
“Thank you for my presents,” Draco added, leaning closer still. His hand was warm on Harry’s thigh and his nose was pressed in that soft, sensitive spot just below Harry’s ear. A spark travelled the length of his body, bouncing between those two points of contact.
Merlin, Draco smells so fucking good. Like cool water and earl grey tea and something soapy, like freesias. He catches his breath as I shift to my side to look at him.
When Harry returned from the bar, Pansy and Ginny had joined the group and were curled up together in one of the armchairs. He smiled warmly at them, tweaking Ginny’s hair as he walked past to perch on the overstuffed arm of Draco’s chair.
They were told to keep magic to a minimum to avoid arousing suspicion from any of the other tourists or local porters that crossed their path. They were permitted to lighten and shrink their luggage, and to bring restricted-size wizarding tents with them, as long as they were careful (Draco had thought longingly of the four-bedroom
“Wear these. Pans said the bar is smart casual so this’ll do.” She waved her wand at the rest of clothing on the floor, which scrambled to right itself into a neat stack. “And maybe this too,” she added with a smirk as she retrieved a small, stringy bundle from the top of the pile. With horror, Harry realised it was a jock strap. He rushed to get up, almost spilling the last of his wine, as Hermione giggled.
On the first day of their eighth year at Hogwarts, Draco had stopped Harry in the courtyard to deliver a quiet apology to somewhere in the vicinity of Harry’s shoes and thank him for speaking at his trial.
Harry brushed his teeth before making his way down to the front room, bare feet whispering on the polished wood floors. He walked in to find Draco sat on the couch, deep in thought. A spread-open copy of Witch Weekly was facedown next to him and Basil was snoozing under the coffee table, his tail wrapped around his little face. Harry paused just over the threshold, drinking in the sight of Draco,
friends. And I have a place for you to stay. For as long as you need – I’m not going to rush you out.” Harry turned to Draco fully, and grabbed his shoulder. “Please, Draco.”
"Well, not technically, no, given that tonight's our first date." A cool voice announced their arrival at the Atrium. "But I hope so."
When Draco reappeared some long moments later, Harry had managed to quash his indignation and had bought a round of drinks. He nudged the glass towards Draco with a sheepish grin.
Harry watched as Draco went through some sort of internal conflict. His self-control, ingrained from his pureblood, aristocratic upbringing, was unable to hide the slight tightening of his jaw, the almost-imperceptible frown between his eyes as his mind worked.
Their week in the Amazon had been truly phenomenal, Draco felt. He’d seen flowers in all shades of the rainbow, their petals used as beds for small, furry sprite-like beings that Victor called
Hermione reached for her wine. The bottle came bobbing out of the kitchenette a moment later, followed by a chipped ceramic mug. She only had the one wineglass, a heavy crystal thing that sparkled when it caught the light, that he knew she’d taken from her parents’ old home when she’d gone back after the War. It had been left on the side of the sink, long since dry, covered in a thin film of dust. She hadn’t been able to find any of the others in the set and later that evening, she, Ron and Harry had tearfully toasted to the hope that the other glasses had made it to Australia, ready for her mother to pour her favourite Sauvignon Blanc into.
“I’m an idiot.” Draco’s voice is small and muffled. He huffs a laugh which hits the back of my neck, soft and warm. “I love you, you know. I have done for a long time. Then suddenly we were having sex and I thought it was…casual. Convenient. Because you’d gotten bored of dating, and waiting for your forever person to come along. And I kept waiting for it to end. For you to say you’d found them and this was done.”
Just a little update - I am posting this now in the hope that it will encourage me to finish this soon!
Harry wanted to lean over and nose his way down his boyfriend’s sternum, until he reached that thin ribbon of silvery hair that started at his navel and ended in a neat triangle around his groin. He shifted slightly in his seat, trying to lessen the pressure in his tightened pants. The jeans he wore were not exactly conducive to stealthy erections, after all.
It had seemed so impossible once, that he and Draco would be anything more than enemies, and later, roommates. But this heavy flooding in his chest was love, Harry knew. This aching desire to simultaneously be over there, wrapped around Draco, with his bright socks and his bright hair and his bright eyes, and also right here, watching him in his element, drinking in all his sharp edges and the soft spaces in between
Harry could still remember the slight sadness he’d felt when Draco had given him a crooked half-smile and then, taking a deep breath, said
“I think Draco’s mad at me,” he said after a moment. “Because of what I said last night about marriage and that. He went to Pansy’s because he needed some space.”
He smiled and went out to the garden, where the dining table and chairs had been nestled into the grass. At one end of the garden, Molly’s Rollicking Roses had bloomed nicely, and their tinny rhymes added to the lazy buzz of bees in the lavender bushes that bordered the house. At the head of the table, Arthur was tinkering with a Walkman and having what appeared to be quite a serious discussion with Hermione about Muggle pop music. Fleur was taking a pair of secateurs to the flowers around them, adding blooms to the whimsical bouquet in the centre of the dining table as Neville, with Ginny perched in his lap, told her that in Victorian flower language she was essentially saying she was sorry to be there with them and was hopeful it would end soon; Fleur’s tinkling laughter joined Ginny’s as they proceeded to try and build the most offensive bouquet that they could. Harry chuckled, dutifully doling out the plates before dropping into the seat next to Ron to watch George and Bill’s rather raucous game of Exploding Snap end with singed eyebrows on all three Weasleys. The table was crowded with platters piled high with pancakes, trays of fluffy scrambled eggs, juicy-looking sausages, perfectly browned potato hashes and everything else they could possible want for brunch. The aroma of bacon drifted over to him as Molly came over, making his mouth water.
Draco chuckled. “You didn’t even know Thomas and Finnegan were at it and they were in your bloody dorm.”
Basil came padding over and jumped lightly into Harry’s lap, bunting his forehead against his stomach. “Hey, baby,” Harry crooned, lightly stroking under Basil’s chin. “Maybe I should get you to ask him, he never says no to you.”
“Yeah, alright,” Harry said. “You still got upset when Hermione picked Lord Byron and he’s been dead for almost three hundred years. That’s about as unattainable as you can get.”
“Not in the way you’d know it. It’s more a shared effort to shift the latent energy in a room. Interestingly, the latest report seemed to suggest that some muggle magic techniques, such as using the phases of the moon, can also have an impact on the sort of energy shift that wizard-borns can produce.”
“Do you want to Floo home or are you going to Apparate? I’ll have to open the Floo up for you. It’s been so cold lately, I’ve kept it closed so I can have a real fire going.”
“That sounds good.” Harry stuffed a triangle of buttered toast in his mouth, wondering how best to phrase what he wanted to say without pissing Draco off – he could still go from nought to pissy in the space of a few mis-spoken words. “Make sure you take it easy for the next couple of weeks, though. I was a bit worried about you last night.”
Bill had clapped Draco on the shoulder, who looked politely bewildered as Fleur kissed him twice on each cheek with gusto, exclaiming her thanks for protecting her husband. Arthur had smiled kindly, and Molly had given his arm a quick squeeze before bustling him to the dining table. Draco’s small smile had faltered when George had just stared at him, eventually giving a curt nod. His tension seemed to ease when Ron passed him a plate piled high with fluffy, perfect eggs and Hermione immediately engaged him in a discussion about something intelligent-sounding. All in all, it was a successful brunch with the only hex thrown by Ginny when Ron hogged the bacon.
. Which probably wouldn’t have been too bad except that yesterday he’d kissed the prat and Draco had shoved him off because he was
Draco shook his head, strands of his hair catching on Harry’s stubble. “No, it’s a Grade II listed building – important to muggles,” he added before Ron could ask, “so even if I wanted to, I couldn’t.”
about Draco’s wedding – told Harry to “man up and tell him you’re in love with him”, he’d finally understood that he was well and truly fucked.
He discovered that he’d purchased five pairs of jewel-toned socks designed to keep feet at the perfect temperature all day –

best friends. “I know what you mean, mate. And thanks.” He clapped Ron on the shoulder and gestured to his front door. “Coming in for a cuppa? Draco might even be home.”
“It’s just so lovely, Harry. I’m happy for you. And hey, I could always teach you that Bird-Conjuring Charm, just in case?”
The next time Harry seriously thought about proposing, he got as far as actually asking Draco a question. His famous Gryffindor bravery had buffeted him down the hall and into the front room where Draco lounged on the couch in soft grey jogging bottoms and an oatmeal t-shirt. His hair was pulled up in a bun and he was reading something intelligent and dense-looking. However, Harry’s courage failed him at the last moment and instead of asking his beautiful, wonderful boyfriend if he would do him the honour of becoming his husband, he instead asked him if he’d-
Something in Draco’s expression twitched and Harry felt a thrum of shock; had Draco Malfoy, the only Seeker who’d ever given him a good game, really not flown once since living in muggle London?
Draco gestured to the wet floor around Harry. "Muggles love health and safety," he said with a small smile.
“Harry, dear!” Molly bustled up to him as he stepped out of the Floo, thrusting a pile of plates in his hands and smacking a kiss to his forehead. “Here, we’re eating in the garden today. Can you get these out to the table, love, and I’ll grab the bacon.”
mosquito bites on Draco’s arse and a rather sheepish trip to the food hall to beg the cook for some of her tea tree salve.
Draco Malfoy’s sharp, aristocratic voice cut through the warm, comforting haze of half a bottle of Odgen’s and Harry looked up, watching him climb gracefully from the Floo into the drawing room at Grimmauld. The last of the green flames cast a fittingly Slytherin halo around Draco as he walked over to where Harry was sprawled on the squashy, burgundy couch, one perfect silver eyebrow raised in question.
“Ow! Lay off. Draco wants to be with you forever, he said so himself. So, I think we need to romance him a bit.”
Less than ten minutes later, he heard the faint sound of the door opening upstairs and grabbed both his mug and the one he’d brewed for Draco, yawning distractedly. As he cleared the last flight of stairs to his floor, the door to his bedroom opened and Draco stepped out with only a towel wrapped around his waist.
wanting to be wrapped up in Draco’s arms, pressed against his sturdy body with a handful of his luscious, round arse.
Harry chuckled a little despondently. The very reason Harry was intent on getting blackout drunk at 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon was that he had recently come to the conclusion that he was bloody well
“Alright, lads!” Ron called, waving at them with his half-drunk ale sloshing precariously up the sides of his glass. “Oi, budge up, Finnigan,” he added, conjuring an impressively ornate set of armchairs for Harry and Draco.
a lot of the time. They had gone from shagging voraciously in the first year of their relationship, to less frequent fumblings, to going weeks where they did little more than peck each other on the cheek and have a furtive wank to let off some steam. Harry was a little frustrated – at the situation itself, rather than at the lack of sex – and a lot worried that Draco might start to get bored of scheduled shags and the odd handjob in bed.
. That he’d decided to first go and buy Draco’s favourite pastries, the ones guaranteed to put him in a good mood, was completely unrelated.
They’d been in the Auror training programme together straight out of their Eighth Year at Hogwarts. It was six months in that Ron that had first extended a hand of civility to Draco, inviting him to join their weekly drinking session at the Leaky when he felt a twinge of guilt at how all the trainees had shunned Draco (“he doesn’t really seem like that much of a knob anymore”). It had been an awkward night at first, the conversation stilted. But then Ron had asked Tom behind the bar for his wizarding chess set and before Harry knew it, Ron had lost a game of chess for the first time since training began and everyone who had already been through a humiliating chess defeat at Ron’s hands (which was most of them) was toasting Draco with a flaming firewhisky.
“Fine. Owl me. I live upstairs.” And with that, he spun around and disappeared up the stairs, leaving Harry with a parting “and don’t nick anything from my shop, Potter.”
“May I?” Draco asked, waiting for Harry to nod before picking up the platinum band. He examined it closely before grabbing Harry’s left hand from the bed and sliding the ring onto his finger. “Perfect fit,” he smiled, making Harry’s heart stutter a bit and a lump form in his throat. Draco held Harry’s hand in his, rubbing his thumb across the ring thoughtfully. “You were always so adamant that you weren’t one for settling down. Do you remember? When we were just friends and Ron and Hermione were newlywed. It would always come up at the Leaky, what with Dean and Seamus and then Ginny and Pans, and Luna and Rolf. You said you didn’t know if you wanted to ever do that. Long-term relationship. Get married. Have kids. The works.”
Harry kissed the nape of Draco’s neck. “Tomorrow’s Sunday,” he whispered, “and I asked for some annual leave. Let's make time.” Draco hummed lightly in response and snuggled closer. “I love you,” Harry added softly.
The sweet domesticity of their living arrangement settled something in Harry. He hadn’t really ever had a proper relationship; he and Ginny had never picked up where they left off (she’d told him, the summer before Eighth Year, that the War had given her some perspective about what she really wanted – and it wasn’t boys); the men and women Harry had dated after leaving Hogwarts had never really progressed beyond a few dinner dates and a shag. And he hadn’t really minded - he had been in no real shape to get into a proper relationship with anyone in the aftermath of the War and he’d
“Hey,” he says softly. I give him a small smile in response and lead him into the sitting room. It’d be pretty gauche to call off our arrangement on the doorstep.
They’d walked inside together, shucking off their coats in the entryway. Harry had taken a moment to admire the way Draco’s chest and stomach filled out his light blue cable-knit jumper, how
Harry – who had woken up precisely three minutes prior to that – took a moment to process all of the words into some semblance of order before nodding and opening his door wider to allow Draco access to the en-suite.
Pansy feels bad but she really loves Ginny. This might actually be the first time she’s ever really loved anyone.
“No! Of course not.” Harry said, realising as he spoke that it was the complete truth. “I just…anyone would feel a bit rejected in that situation.” He bopped Basil gently on his nose and was rewarded with a lick. “I’d respect his decision, though, of course I would. I’d just really like him to say yes.”
Hermione nodded. “Listed buildings have their own protections from things like enlargement charms, they have since the Statute of Secrecy was put into effect,” she said when she caught Ron’s puzzled look.
“It’s nice that you turned up,” Potter said, his voice very close to Draco’s ear, their bodies pressed from shoulder to thigh. That was the thing about having Gryffindor friends; they were so
. There was also a beautiful, exquisitely rendered chocolate dragon with dark green scales and gold-tipped horns down its back; when it thrashed its tail against the sides of the box, Harry jumped, dribbling coffee down his chin. A mental image of Draco trying to bite into the crotchety chocolate creature made Harry laugh and he set the gift next to the socks.
As everyone settled into eating, the conversation meandered through Ginny’s latest tour with the Hollyhead Harpies, Bill’s work strengthening some alarm hexes at Gringotts – at this he fixed Harry with a wry grin and informed him the goblins sent their regards – and Hermione’s thoughts on the Ministry’s latest educational reforms which included a host of Muggle and wizarding arts programmes at Hogwarts. She told them that it was Dean Thomas, who Harry didn’t see that often anymore now that he and Seamus lived in Hogsmeade, who had led the way for a dedicated Art and Design OWL, teaching Muggle art history and techniques as well as the magic behind animating wizarding paintings and sculptures. Hermione had tactfully sidestepped Molly’s wistful comment about how lovely it was that Dean and Seamus had stayed together all these years after meeting at school, responding innocently that hadn't Ron recently been out with none other than Lavender Brown, his very first girlfriend at school? Ron had spluttered as his mother seized on the information, giving Hermione a very un-gentlemanly middle finger salute when Molly’s gaze was turned.
“The bookshop is really impressive, I can’t wait to have a proper root through,” Hermione told Draco as she walked out of the tiny kitchenette tucked off the side of the main shop with a stack of tumblers in her hands. She sank to the floor to mix a round of drinks before Harry could think to stop her. “Harry told me about the work you do with wizard-borns, it’s a great initiative.”
– followed by an indignant yowl - made him spin around, instinctively defensive, to find Draco stood frozen in the doorway, his gaze trained on Harry’s chest and a book open haphazardly at his feet. Basil stood a foot away, casting a disgusted look at the book.
Witch Weekly, never lets me read it,” he said as he smoothed the magazine out and shoved a slab of cake in his mouth. Harry wondered briefly if Ron had an undetectable extension charm on his mouth to enable him to fit all that food in there at once. “She actually rates the Quibbler higher for quality content, but don’t tell Luna or Mione’ll have me.”
brand-new, in the way many of the trendy places on the high street were; designed to look as though it had gone through the wringer before anyone had ordered a single pun-based cocktail. Some catchy indie number was playing loudly over the hum of people laughing and talking.
Draco looked up, hit for a second by just how large the sky looked. “I’m not sure you can see Draco in the Southern hemisphere.”
Harry shuffled through the stack, surprised that Draco had kept all five of the letters he’d sent… and had written back?
“Perhaps we should leave,” he heard Hermione say in the background, and then the shuffling noises of everyone getting to their feet. Ron hovered in his peripheral vision, as if he wanted to check that Harry was alright, but his eyes were fixed on Draco and after a moment, the space was empty but for the two of them, still facing each other on the floor.
want to be with you forever. And if there comes a day that you change your mind and decide you want to get married, I’ll be here to say yes.”
He remembered how long he’d spent trying to craft a message that didn’t seem too desperate; even though he hadn’t been able to get Draco out of his mind from the moment they’d parted ways at King’s Cross.
When he got back, Draco was quietly sipping at a cup of tea in the kitchen, unopened owl post stacked neatly in a pile to his right, opened post sorted in smaller, equally neat piles in front of him. Teddy had whooped in delight and rushed over to his cousin, clambering up into his lap and flinging his arms around Draco’s neck.
They shared a moment, just grinning at each other, until Draco started to feel a little embarrassed and he rolled off Potter.
“Okay,” Draco whispered, his voice sounding shaky. Harry’s hand tightened on his waist as he pressed his mouth to Draco’s, and then he was overwhelmed with sensations: Draco’s mouth was hot, his chest solid and his stomach soft when it pressed against Harry’s. When Draco’s tongue stroked along his, Harry let out a low, muffled moan and moved his hands down to
“Another cup of tea and some toast would be divine.” Draco finished his tea and stood up slowly, waving Harry off when he reached out a hand to help him down to the kitchen.
Harry thought, so hard that he looked up in case he’d accidentally magicked the words into existence above his head.
“Hey,” came a soft voice and he opened his eyes to see Draco standing above him, his eyes on the rings in Harry’s hand.
Harry sighed, rolling back over onto his back. Draco’s unanswered question hovered in the air above them as they lay there, hands entwined in the space between them, until Hermione called them back inside.
world.” Harry was aware that their friends were watching their exchange, that maybe this was a conversation best had in private, but he couldn’t stop himself.
Eighth Year had seemed like a prison sentence when Draco had first stepped back into the newly-rebuilt Great Hall, the only returning Slytherin. He was assaulted by memories of the Battle; for a moment, he could hear the chilling, high pitched laughter of the Dark Lord, and smell the acrid tang of hexes in the air, like burned matchsticks. If he’d known then that all the returning Eighth Years were going to be roomed together in one of the old unused guest towers, and that he’d end up with Potter, Weasley and Longbottom – because karma was a bigger bitch than he was - he might just have turned around and walked himself straight to Azkaban.
(Harry had read the article later that morning after a bracing run, thrilled that it had been positive on the whole but somewhat alarmed to find out that he was now one half of a ‘power couple’. He’d carefully cut out the photo – grinning goofily as he watched photo-Draco press a soft kiss to his mouth before twining their fingers together and Apparating away – and pondered if being in a power couple meant that he’d have to spend more time on his hair.)
Harry quirked his mouth up despite the heavy feeling in his chest. Molly’s lemon drizzle cake was a cheat day staple, and always featured the day after the dreaded weekly five-mile run to remind them there was goodness in the world.
Ron’s eyes lit up, and Harry caught Hermione good-naturedly shaking her head at his enthusiasm. “Lead on, then” he said, and when Blaise stood up to join him, Ron threw an arm around his shoulders.
. Gone was that hulking look he’d always had at school as Draco’s rather more substantial shadow. He’d lost some weight, or maybe it was more accurate to say the weight he’d carried had been turned into what looked like six foot of solid muscle. But there was an openness about him now, so his large frame didn’t seem as menacing as it always had back at Hogwarts, and his small eyes looked less beady now that they were set into a chiselled face. He even had a bloody beard now, one of those trendy ones that was cropped close and looked artfully rugged.
So, he’d leaned forward and placed his hand on Draco’s arm, trying to convey with his eyes the (rather mature, he felt) realisation he’d just had. Draco swallowed and nodded gratefully, and Hermione took a deep breath before asking
Harry’s surprise over Goyle’s glow up was quickly overshadowed by the sheer joy that flooded him as he caught sight of Draco; a feeling so strong it stopped him in his tracks. There was a fuchsia feather boa draped over the lapels of his silky ice-blue shirt and a ridiculous pointy party hat set at a jaunty angle over his platinum hair. Draco was already flushed from whatever was in the umbrella-clad drink he sipped from, or maybe it was whatever Blaise was saying to him. Harry’s throat was tight and it thrummed with his quickened pulse. Although he’d told Hermione that he was falling in love with Draco, it hit him almost as hard as the first time he thought it as he watched his boyfriend wrinkle his nose when a feather tickled his nostril.
Just as things were getting interesting, Draco had stiffened up – not quite in the way Harry would have liked – and wrenched himself away. He moved to the end of the sofa, hair mussed up, a wild pink flush on his cheeks, breathing as if he’d running a marathon.
It was a few weeks later that Draco had mentioned finding it difficult to get a decent flat in wizarding London. The two of them had been standing at the mouth of the alley by the Leaky, sharing a clandestine cigarette, Draco having stayed late at the pub for the first time in a while. Their shoulders were touching lightly and it suffused Harry with a warmth that shielded him from the freezing night.
“Draco?” He steps up to me and I step back before I know what I’m doing. His arms drop and his face crumples with hurt. “What’s wrong?”
Harry followed him over to the sink and reached around Draco, shutting the tap off and gently pulling the mug from his soapy hand and setting it down. He rested his forehead in between Draco’s shoulders, inhaling that intoxicating bergamot-citrus-musk scent, allowing his hands to drift to Draco’s waist.
"Okay, guys?" Draco and Harry smiled weakly. "We'll take breakfast in ten minutes and we'll start hiking to Inti Punku at about 3.45. It's a challenging walk but it will be beautiful to see the sun rise over Machu Picchu. It's an unforgettable sight."
And then he hadn’t seen or heard from Draco for three years. He’d sent a few owls, giving up when Florence at the Owl Office started giving him pitying looks. And then he’d filed his attraction to Draco along with all the other what-ifs in his life and thrown himself into Auror training. He took overtime whenever it was offered and gave the money to orphanages up and down the country. He slept, he went to work, he saw Ron at training and Hermione when she joined them at lunch from Level Nine. He went to the Weasley's once a month and played the odd Seeker's match with Ginny, leaving as soon as Molly's face became too wistful (she still hadn't gotten over their mutual unwillingness to get back together, although Molly's wistfulness seemed to lack intensity since Neville, on his first meeting of the Weasley family as Ginny's Official Boyfriend, had bought her some Rollicking Roses). Harry went out to Muggle bars a handful of times and occassionally went home with a man or woman that was usually pale and blonde and – if he hit the jackpot – acerbically witty. He didn’t have the time to be lonely, even though he felt the ache of it on the occasions when he couldn’t sleep.
“Oooh, good shout! Can he be my pass too? Can we both have him as our pass? What’s the rule on that?”
"Who're you out with?" Ron asked, eying the witches with interest (he had no such qualms about being nice to the finance team). About a year after the war, he and Hermione had decided they were better off as friends - the best of friends - and Ron had since enjoyed batchelorhood immensely.
Draco nodded. “Yeah. It takes a fair amount of magical strength to untangle curse-traps and hexes as is, but this place was pretty well warded and I caught the brunt of a blasting curse.” His voice was gravelly and he brought his hand to his ribs. “Couldn’t find the energy to walk up to my room last night. The Floo trip back from Gringotts pretty much did me in.” He set the tea down and ran a hand through his hair, grimacing. “Ugh, I need a long hot bath. Sleeping in a tent, even a wizarding one, always makes me feel grimy to my bones.”
Hermione frowned and leaned forwards. Harry had never wished more strongly that he was a skilled Legilimens than in that moment as he fervently thought
Harry nodded, handing Teddy to Andromeda and giving them both a hug. Teddy started to cry, the excitement of the day overwhelming him, which subsided to shaky hiccups when Draco conjured a small paper dragon which fluttered around Teddy’s head before coming to rest on his shoulder. It opened its mouth and gave a tiny roar that sounded like paper tearing, which made Teddy giggle delightedly (Draco pointedly ignored Andromeda rolling her eyes when he gave her a smug grin). Ron and Hermione promised to check in on Andromeda while they were gone, and with all their goodbyes said, they walked hand-in-hand to the departure zone.
On the Friday, he appeared in Hermione’s Floo, shirtless and panting. His best friend was sat in her favourite velvet armchair with her legs curled under her, yet another hefty book in one hand and a glass of wine in the other. She looked up, took in his rather dramatic state, and raised an eyebrow at him. “You’ve not Floo’d me during sex again, have you?”
Pansy said something then, too low for Harry to hear, but he noted the way that Hermione’s face flushed and her mouth twitched as she fought a grin. As she stepped into the Floo, Pansy turned around and purred at him, “I vote you show up just like that. After all, it
“Oh,” Draco started, sitting up a little straighter and softening the set of his mouth slightly. “You’re up.”
They spoke to Robards and wrangled a month off; Andromeda, Teddy, Ron and Hermione saw them to the International Portkey Office, where they were to catch the 7.14pm to Lima. They arrived with plenty of time to spare, so Harry took Teddy off to grab some hot chocolate while Ron bought a round of Pumpkin Pasties from the welcome witch in the waiting room.
“Oh, I don’t. We just had a bet to see if you’d spill after Ron told you not to. He owes me five galleons.”
Draco crawled over to his boyfriend and ran a hand down his chest, dipping his head to nose at the juncture between his hip and thigh. The scent of musk and cedar bodywash and
It’s when we stop moving against each other that my chest starts to ache with the burden of loving him. It’s not right to keep something so large, so all-encompassing, trapped in a cage of sinew and bone and it’s starting to eat away at my insides.
Blaise laughed but he released Harry’s hand and then looked over to where Ron, Ginny and Neville hovered somewhat awkwardly across the table. Well, Ron and Neville looked awkward; Ginny was busy lining up her preferred selection of drinks. It seemed she was really planning to paint the town red. (And yellow and orange and – most worryingly – neon green with thin line of electric blue salt around the rim.)
Harry chuckled as he walked over to the two of them, a box of breakfast pastries in his hands. He gave Draco a brief morning kiss as he set the pastries down on the table, before heading over to the kettle to grab a cuppa. Belatedly remembering the travelling cloaks he’d walked past on his way out (and back in), he hurried back out to the hall to pick them up, knowing Draco would grumble about creases if he spotted them on the floor.
Harry felt his blood fizzing around in his veins. Every nerve felt electrified and he swallowed against the thrumming of his heart in his throat. It was
“Night,” he smiled and then Apparated straight into his bedroom. He barely lasted a minute before he came all over his fist, the taste of Draco Malfoy still sweet and sharp on his lips.
“Ah, well, that’s understandable then,” Draco muttered faintly as he lay a napkin over his chinos. George grinned. “This looks lovely.”
I hesitate, biting my lip. Potter and I had become quite good friends in the last two years, after Mother and I reconnected with Andromeda. What started as suffering each other’s presence awkwardly while visiting Teddy evolved into drinks after work, Saturday coffees and occasional dinners with our growing group of mutual friends.
The morning after their not-quite-argument about stepping out in the wizarding world, Harry had been woken at the crack of dawn by an Owl from the Ministry. Even though it was a Saturday and he wasn’t due to work, he’d reluctantly left a sleeping Draco – so soft and warm in the buttery yellow sunrise – and Apparated back to Grimmauld Place to get changed into his robes. After that, they’d never gone back to the conversation they’d had that night.
I didn't get to write as much of this as I wanted but posting anyway or I never will. I've hit a bit of a roadblock with it - I have an ending but not too sure yet how I'm getting there!
anymore. It’s gotten out of control. Something changed in the last six months; we go drinking together after work and his knee will brush mine under the table; he stays the night and has a toothbrush here; I left my favourite dark green jumper at his flat last week and he wore it the next time we met. It’s getting too painful to be so casual about something so serious.
And what did it matter anyway, given that Draco was a wizard - and quite a skilled one at that, if his Eighth Year Charms practicals had been any indication - a swish of his wand and his shirt would be back to its pristine whiteness in no time.
Draco nodded absently, his eyes on Harry as he picked Teddy up with one arm, his t-shirt pulling taut around his shapely biceps. With a deep breath, Draco joined them, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Teddy’s multi-coloured curls.
“My life is here.” He stood up, swaying slightly, and looked at Harry for a long moment before sighing. “I’m, er – I’m going to bed. One too many cocktails.”
Hermione gave him a big smile, the one she didn’t use very often: it reminded him of her childhood grin, the way it listed more to one side and made her nose wrinkle. She was happy for him. He smiled back, part embarassed and part relieved.
. He’d put on some weight since school, and Harry couldn’t deny the way his mouth dried at the sight of his broader shoulders and softer face. His skin was clear and creamy, and his eyes – although a little tight around the corners with nerves – were the warm grey of thunderclouds in the summer.
, per se, but it seems to be enough that the wizard-borns can feel it in themselves,” Draco added. “Leonie – she’s wizard-born – she showed me the Pettyswicke report on it a year ago and asked me if she could use the shop to try it. She’s built it up from three wizard-borns meeting monthly to now having a waiting list for the weekly sessions. They do all sorts, tarot and energy circles and herbal magic, although that mostly seems limited to creating godawful teas.” Draco looked around the room fondly. “But it is getting somewhat crowded in here, so we’ve had to limit numbers.”
Merlin, he was far more nervous than Harry had realised. It was enough to soften the annoyance that had flared in Harry, and he reached out and grabbed Draco’s hand. His
Draco looked up as he neared and gave a wry grin. “Ah, the lions descend,” he said, as Harry leaned down to drop a kiss on his lips.
The next day, Harry stumbled out of bed in the late morning, his throat burning and the world a blur. He pushed his glasses onto his nose and fumbled around in the side table for one of Draco’s home-brewed hangover potions; he’d somehow found a way to give them an aftertaste almost like treacle tart, which always made Harry’s heart warm even as he shuddered through the initial discomfort of all the toxins leaving his body at once.
“Yeah, alright, Malfoy,” George said, shoving him lightly out of the way. He took aim. It was Harry’s turn as saboteur but George decided last minute to aim for the bottle on the opposite end of the wall; it exploded at the same time as the original bottle leapt into the air.
Harry felt a little disappointed that he’d been brushed off once more, until they stepped outside into the cool April evening and started walking, and Draco spoke again.
Before long, a fortnightly catch-up at the Leaky had been established, and slowly expanded over time to include Ginny, Pansy, Blaise and Luna. Once in a while, they were joined by other Hogwarts alumni and - on one memorable occasion - Professor McGonagall, who threw back a shot of Firewhisky and remained regal and stoic when smoke poured out of her nostrils as if she were some sort of ancient, majestic dragon.
Draco chuckled. “If you think I got a single say in anything wedding-related, you obviously don’t know my mother.” He cleared his throat delicately. “Besides, I had a chat with Ron last night.”
that no person in their right mind runs out on Harry bloody Potter.” He huffed out a little laugh. “Hermione also handily pointed out that if all my mother wanted was to restore some honour to the Malfoy name, surely there could be no better way than for her successful, devilishly attractive Auror son to date the saviour of all wizardkind.”
Harry laughed and then pulled back, just enough to rearrange them so that Draco sat between his legs with his back to Harry’s chest. It was a lovely moment that seemed to swell as the group descended into good-natured bickering and light insults; the smell of Draco’s shampoo and his cologne tickling Harry’s nose, the warmth of his body pressed back against Harry’s, the way their left hands were entwined loosely.
“Hold on…ah! There. The box by the bed that’s glowing. Wait, why do you have anti-summoning wards all over it? Did you bring home some sort of Dark object from a case? You know you’re not supposed to do that.”
Later, when he was in the kitchen stacking the clean dishes back into the cupboards, Molly came in and gave him a huge hug. He pulled her into his arms, smelling the chamomile of her washing charms on her clothes and the honey-vanilla scent of her favourite perfume potion.
Draco seemed a bit rooted to the spot, so Harry held the box out to him. For some reason, he seemed to have lost his grip on reality because he said the first words that came to mind. “Fancy it then?”
Merlin, it was hard to believe it had only been four months. Four months and eleven dates, that’s all it had taken for him to fall head over heels for Draco.
That night, Harry and Draco got to the pub later than usual because Harry had been caught up at work (to be fair, if he hadn’t insisted on giving Draco a blow job in the shower, they probably would have made it on time). The Leaky was busy, the smell of chips making Harry’s mouth water and the sound of laughter and chatter settling cosy and comfortable around his shoulders. Harry thread his fingers through Draco’s, walking in front as he led them towards their usual spot. He could see Hermione, Ron, Seamus and Luna already seated around the large, rustic dining tables, a variety of glasses spread out in front of them.
“Mate, you’re basically in a relationship with Malfoy. You’ve even got a fucking cat. Just tell him how you feel.”
Draco titled his head back so he could look up at him. Harry wasn’t sure what the expression on his face was, but it didn’t look happy at his suggestion. “I don’t want to go back to wizarding London,” Draco said slowly.
his gaze, slow and heavy like treacle. Draco automatically turned his left arm, shielding his Mark from view.
Draco pulled back, swiping a hand over his mouth. His lips felt swollen, stretched, and the taste of Harry’s orgasm lingered on his tongue. His erection throbbed as he took it in hand, smearing the pearly liquid at the tip down the length to lubricate his strokes. He leaned over Harry, pulling him in for a filthy kiss that sparked all the way down to his balls. It didn’t take much to tip him over the edge; one of Harry’s hands skating across his nipple, the other brushing down to his balls, and a few strokes later he was painting Harry’s stomach with thick white ropes.
Molly had graciously delayed Harry’s birthday brunch for a good hour and a half, ignoring George and Ron as they grumbled about being hungry while also stuffing themselves with the canapes that floated out from the kitchen in a seemingly endless stream.
For their five-year anniversary, Harry and Draco booked a holiday. They’d pored over Draco’s list of places he wanted to visit, debating the merits of each, until they’d settled on Peru: Harry wanted to do the Inca Trail and Draco was keen to visit the Peruvian Amazon to see some of the rare and intriguing flora and fauna. He also wanted to squeeze in a visit to see the Nazca lines, having read an interesting article in The Astronomer’s Anthology about the geoglyphs.
“Not the worse we’ve been called,” Draco grinned, pushing his box of chow mein away with a satisfied sigh.
There was a pause as Draco set the two cups of tea on the table and sank down into a dining chair slowly. “I promised Luna I’d go see her and Rolf, see how the Menagerie is doing.”
The three years since Harry’d finally told Draco how he felt had been a wonderful and ridiculous whirlwind.
He scanned the group. Pansy Parkinson was grinning at Hermione over a glass of something amber on ice, her wide mouth painted with a lipstick so dark it looked black. Hermione was biting her lip in that way that Harry knew meant she wanted to laugh uproariously, but she’d never quite grown out of her insecurity about how her front teeth looked when she did. He didn’t often see her dressed to the nines either, but he thought she looked beautiful in a slinky gold top that flattered her deep skin and showed off the pretty shine of her shoulders and collarbones as they caught the light.
, you prat” – and then Draco was giggling and then they were leaning into each other, laughing uproariously.
"Like a date," Harry confirmed with a grin as they exited the Auror offices. They just managed to catch the lift, squeezing in past a pair of witches dressed in the gunmetal grey robes of the Magical Accounts Division. Harry gave a polite smile as the taller of the two giggled at her friend. While the witches and wizards up at MAD were the worst with the flirty smiling and the flirty touching and the flirty autograph-hunting, it paid to be nice to the finance team - no matter how much Harry didn't want to sometimes.
It was Draco that Harry first told about his bisexuality, striving for a casual tone as he mentioned fancying Reuben Addison after the Unspeakable had helped them crack a dangerous creature smuggling ring. Draco, who’d been out since Eighth Year, had simply remarked that while he could certainly appreciate the blonde-haired, blue-eyed man from afar, surely Harry could choose someone better to date than the guy named for a
I wake up to a loud, insistent pounding on my front door. At first, it blends with the remnants of my dreams, a confusing mass of closed doors and green lights and snakes and fire. I lie in bed, heart thumping, until the pounding starts up again. A quick wandless
“Bathroom’s here,” Victor said, opening a door at the far end of the room. It led to a small room with a shower made from what appeared to be bamboo, and a loo. The ceiling was open to the rainforest, and the humongous, meaty leaf of some kind of palm poked up over the wooden wall of the bathroom; on it lay one of the fairy creatures they’d seen earlier, their snores adding a high-pitched buzz to the cacophony of insects chirping around them.
The Portkey Office at Puerto Maldonado was nothing more than a small wooden shack on the banks of the Tambopata river. The humidity, when they walked out of the boundary of the cooling charms, hit Draco like a wall. It was just after midday and the air was swollen with heat, resting heavy on his skin, which instantly achieved a sweaty, rosy gleam, and made every breath feel like treacle in his chest. It somehow even bloody
But just like after the first wizarding war, society had begun to move on. Draco had been pardoned, publicly, and they’d parted ways after eighth year as friends. By the end of that year, Draco’d managed to be friendly with most of the returning class, in fact. So Harry truly didn’t think that he had anything to worry about. This whole evening, and the reaction of the Weasley’s when he told them he was dating a Malfoy, the way his two best friends had wholeheartedly supported their relationship from that first date; wasn’t this evidence of how little anyone would care about Draco returning to the wizarding world?
Draco barely noticed where he chucked his clothes because suddenly Harry was sprawled out gloriously naked, his coffee-and-cream skin darker on his arms after trekking in the sun. His eyes followed the trail of dark, wiry hair that led from his chest down to his cock, thick and red and proud and
a perfect person for me, there’s no saying they’d be dating or available or what have you. I could end up missing out on a good thing because I waited on nothing.”
it’s a bloody priority.” He rolled his eyes. “You know how I’d rather not use a cleaning charm if it can be avoided.”
, knowing that sharp, aristocratic tone anywhere. It had been three years since Harry had last heard that poncy drawl; three years since Eighth Year had ended, since he'd been around anyone posh enough to make their consonants sharp enough to cut glass.
Harry hadn’t even been upset when he’d been partnered with Draco rather than Ron after graduating. Although it seemed at first that Draco’s shrewd, analytical mind and obsessive attention to detail was designed to clash with Harry’s tenacity and enthusiasm for getting the job done, it didn’t take long for them to realise how well they actually complemented each other: Draco slowed him down, made him dot his i’s and cross his t’s so their cases were watertight, and Harry encouraged Draco to get his nose out of the books and trust his own gut instinct. They had each other’s backs both in and out of uniform. Even Ron, who’d admitted to a small twinge of jealousy at just how good they were as a team, understood their unique dynamic and that at the heart of their friendship, it simply came down to the fact that Draco always gave Harry a fight: whether they were standing together, back to back in a room full of criminals, or shouting insults at each other and storming off to cool down.
this is why Hermione does the talking.” He ran a hand through his hair and grimaced, although Harry wasn’t sure if it was from the sweat or the conversation. “Basically, don’t feel like you can’t tell us you fancy him because you think we might get upset. He’s alright.”
“Draco, don’t tease. It’s been a week since we last did anything and I don’t want to embarrass myself.”
Blaise shoved Ron, who listed over to the side onto the hardwood floor, and Draco burst out laughing at the betrayal on his face.
Lugnott was a fairly friendly goblin – in that he didn’t seem to actively dislike Harry or hold that whole theft-by-dragon business against him - and within a few weeks he had catalogued Harry’s various assets on reams of parchment and presented them in all in a very sophisticated leather folder.
in a cosy grey cardigan, tight black jeans and slightly scuffed brogues showing off a flash of his bright scarlet socks.
“I sorted out our assets and paying reparations, that took some time. We didn’t have much left after, pretty much everything Malfoy had been seized. But we had Mother’s Black inheritance…the villa, some vaults. I helped Mother with her rose gardens, went to my Wizengamot-appointed Mind Healer sessions. After about a year, Mother gave me a stern talking about
Harry chose that moment to focus on controlling his breathing instead of humouring Ron with a response. While it was true that Harry had developed an appreciation for Draco’s thundercloud eyes and razor-sharp wit, he wasn’t sure he wanted to fully admit it to anyone but himself. Anyway, they were
). In turn, Draco regaled him with a few choice stories about the muggles and – surprisingly – squibs that frequented Black’s Books (“I’m just saying tarot is ambiguous at best. There was one lady called Joanne who would always offer to read my cards. The one time I let her, she spent forty-five minutes telling me I was going to marry a friend of the family, have a son and – worst of all - grow my hair out and wear it in a
“Thank you! You truly are the brightest witch of our age. For fuck’s sake, Hermione, stop waving that around!”
Harry was so preoccupied with his thoughts that he didn’t notice the door open, or Draco pad over to him, Basil echoing his steps. It was only when Draco’s hand landed on his shoulder that he jumped, startled, yelping loudly. Basil chirped in indignation, shooting off across the room to hide under the bed. Harry quickly closed his fist around the box, the loud
And last week, they’d enjoyed a lazy Sunday meandering among the greenery at the Chelsea Physic Garden, kissing by the Pond Rockery and pausing to sniff at lush, fragrant blooms. Draco was fascinated by the Garden of Edible and Useful Plants, crouching to read the little signs about the flora and its uses. He’d looked up with a little grin and Harry, impulsive to his core, had blurted out that he wanted to tell the Weasleys about them. A long discussion later, and Draco had acquiesced.
I walk to the door, still smarting. We’ve been having sex exclusively for a year, a year tonight, and hanging out at the pub after work, and brushing our teeth side by side in the morning when I stay the night. Didn’t that make us boyfriends?
Hermione would be able to use the word ‘initiative’ as if she hadn’t just drunk her weight in Te-killa Sunrises.)
