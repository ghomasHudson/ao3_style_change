And Draco couldn’t take it anymore, because he was
'Draco, fuck,' Harry groaned, licking the seam of his lips. He moved his thigh, the little tease, so it brushed Draco's dick. Draco ground down once, the friction through their clothes fueling his growing erection, and muffled a rough sound against Harry's cheek.

'I never hated you because of the
Draco swallowed. ‘I’m his friend.’
‘Quit worrying. I loved it.’
'Is that so?' Draco hummed. 'I'm going to take that as a promise.'
And the amount of people who drank was much less than he expected. He himself drank, Sue and Alicia did too, as did Ron and Hermione; Finnigan as well, unsurprisingly, and, after a stunted pause, Ginny, almost as quick as lightning. And Draco, because Ginny would always be to him, no matter how heroic she proved, the little girl who’d snatched Potter first, immediately turned, when he saw her drink, to stare at Harry. But Ginny had drunk, and Harry’s glass was stubbornly on the table, and his glittery eyes on his lap, and he wasn’t
'What will you wear?' Pansy's voice had startled him. She was lounging in one of the armchairs by the fireplace, fitted in a short black dress. Her eyes were lined gloss black, a green shimmer over her eyelids; her bare legs glistened warm orange from the flames.
Regardless, he didn’t change his mind. Five minutes before midnight on Friday, he was planted at the bottom of the spiraling stairs, clad in one of his best suits, posture rigid, hands clasped behind his back, Pansy beside him and Blaise and Rowena whispering a few steps back.
Harry scoffed. ‘The minute they do they’ll start pestering me about sex. I’m not-’ he waved a hand vaguely between them, obviously rethinking what he would say. ‘Don’t be dense, Malfoy.’
him. He knew only that he’d gotten him in the infirmary, and that Harry had asked him to leave.
‘Ron.’
‘No one just says things.’
, that it'd become his job, his bloody privilege to fucking take care of it now, was threatening to make his own stamina shamefully short-fused.
'What did you say to them, Pansy?'
'Then bloody shut up,' he retorted with a smirk before engulfing him in warmth again, holding his hips against the wall both for the pleasure of seeing Harry pinned down and to keep himself from touching his erection, lest he come in his jeans.
fault,’ huffed Draco. On Harry’s bottom lip trembled a perilous drop of his blood, stark red against the slick flesh. It was sort of charming, in a very twisted way. He licked it clean, feeling Harry shudder beneath him. ‘You did tell me the vampire look suited me once.’
Draco, for the life of him, couldn’t think of anything clever to say. It was just as well, because a moment later Dean Thomas patted both their shoulders, making them turn with a start:
‘You taking Seamus’s seat?’
No. Like they
He’d stared at the black sky for too long, he figured. It had reminded him that the universe wasn’t ever really good - and this memory it had allowed him was not a gift but a curse, for he didn’t know if he could bear it if the next time he looked at Harry he found staring back at him eyes filled with disgust.
‘Should have thought about that before you pushed me, Malfoy.’
hands… Shameful, the lot of them. But they'd leave, skitter off to another venue in no time, and no one would see Draco and he'd swiftly return to Pansy once they were gone, properly apologize and then force her to give up on this forsaken plan and turn in for the night.
The corridor was deserted. The classroom door was firmly shut. Draco leaned against one of the walls, brow furrowed and arms wrapped around himself. He’d resolved - perhaps presumptuously, but it wasn’t like Harry had been
‘Yes.’
Draco had completely forgotten the blasted bag - it hung neglected in his spare hand, the one not tugging at Harry's hip. He gave it to Blaise.
‘Lucky, wasn’t it?’
Outside, in the icy street, Draco recognized all the usual members of Harry’s group. They were scattered, shivering in the cold, Luna and Sue closest to the door while the others stood a bit farther, forming tight circles with their arms linked and their hands in their pockets.
like it hadn't been his nightly fantasy during 4th year, when the Yule Ball was approaching and Draco could barely function with how jealous he was of that Chang girl and later, surprisingly enough, of Parvati, because Potter truly considered everyone but him, he went to stand beside him on the steps and held out his arm, 'Come along, then.'
‘Bloody absinthe or not, you’re coming dancing.’
‘Would you just be patient? You’ve been doing so good.’
Draco rolled his eyes. ‘Buy the fucking tarts, Potter. I’ll carry the box.’
Harry’s eyes were a billowy black. Slowly, he withdrew his hands from the bag, letting Draco have it.
‘What? Sod off,’ Harry managed through a surprised laugh; and he was angling away again, but Draco grabbed him by one hip and unzipped his slacks deftly. They slid half down his thighs, revealing come-soaked underwear and the subtle outline of a very soft dick.
‘Do you plan on telling me anything else, or will you just sit there yearning?’
Draco raised his eyebrows when Ron’s voice trailed off. ‘Since when?’ he prompted, but the other boy simply shook his head in some secretive amusement. Had he ever been in the Slytherin commons? Had Potter? ‘Are you alone out here?’
fancied him. He was everything from the moment I met him.'
for his honesty, fingers firmly circling the half he couldn’t swallow around. He bobbed his head once, slowly, testing, the sweetest little thing, then let out a moan that reverberated around Draco’s cock - and Draco

was real, and yet so ethereal that it could only belong to a dream.
‘If I leave you alone your drunken ass is going to stay here for half an hour.’
Harry kept his lips around him until his climax subsided, tongue lapping ever so lightly at it, licking off lingering drops of come without tormenting the over-sensitive flesh. When Draco's breath had steadied, and his grip on his hair gentled, he withdrew.
Draco couldn't blame her - she had a certain way of making possibility seem like fact.
Draco lifted the arm he’d been resting over his eyes, shooting Blaise an unimpressed look.
‘Doesn’t it say the measurements?’
'Who knew the Boy Who Lived couldn't handle his liquor?'
have to ask that?’ Harry snorted, though he was smiling a bit deliriously as he looked back at Draco, eyes wide. He
Potter - how could he now, with something so ugly and weak bared for him to see?
‘Is this about Potter?’
something. He’d been pulled into the intense green of Harry’s eyes, when they were sitting so close together, and thought that Harry could somehow, someday
Harry groaned, and he was tensing again, his muscles trembling under Draco's hands, 'Fuck, Malfoy, I'm gonna- Malfoy,
‘We fucked it up.’
, and Harry looked distraught but
'What?'
'Nothing that matters,' Draco insisted, taking a sip from the glass of wizard's brew they were sharing.
Harry was
It didn’t mean he’d get one, though. And that didn’t necessarily mean terrible things, did it? Harry could keep his back turned all he wanted and still be looking forward to their strange tutoring session as much as Draco. Fearing it as much as Draco. Obsessing over the previous night as well… maybe he couldn’t stop thinking about sucking Draco off, maybe he wanted to do it again, maybe he missed the taste of it; maybe he couldn’t wait until they were alone in that classroom again so he could press himself against Draco and kiss him senseless.
‘What help you were,’ Harry said wryly, glaring at him. ‘I’d be lost if you weren’t here.’
‘It is. Can’t say they’re quite my style.’
‘I hated you, and look how well that turned out,’ Draco mused, swiping a soothing thumb over his knuckles.
Draco couldn't very well deny it, so he simply kissed the corner of Harry's smeared lips - and he wondered how much of that lipstick was now painted on his own skin - before asking:
It was more than enough motivation: Draco swatted Harry’s hand away and replaced it with his own, jerking Harry tight and fast, rising from him a ragged sound. Harry, in turn, started stroking Draco in tandem, catching his lips for another laughing kiss.
‘They’ll hate me.’
For one tortuous moment, Harry taunted him with silence, eyes twinkling mischievously while he sipped his tea. He very properly set his mug down, entwined his fingers on the table, shrugged with a softer smile.
‘It’s bloody late, Harry.’
‘But infinitely more pleasant means,’ Draco smirked. Harry met his gaze with an amused fondness reminiscent of that tepid morning with the Alihotsy - and Draco had told him he
But Harry didn't thrust up - instead, he surged forward to grab him by the neck and kiss him.
‘It’s gone now, Potter. It disappeared during your stunt from earlier!’
, and then you pull shit like this.’
‘You pushed him.’
‘They’re kind of lame, aren’t they?’
He wanted to talk to him. He’d thought - and thinking really was so often conducive to disappointment - that that odd night in the Three Broomsticks had been some kind of hallmark in their relationship. They’d
Harry nudged him in the arm. '
'Are you sure he wasn't there?'
‘Just meet me here tomorrow, after Herbology. Can you manage that, Potter?’
Still, he wondered when that voice would finally leave. Certainly Potter's group wouldn't stay long - they'd ask for their shots and go on their merry way, each of them blissfully drunk, stumbling, giggling, holding onto each other with thoughtless,
‘You’re absolutely no fun.’
Draco suppressed a fond laugh. That fucking glitter truly was Harry’s pride and joy.
‘A game, is it?’ he asked.
‘I never said she wasn’t,’ Draco retorted. ‘Why are you even going, Pike? I’d think this was a date between those two.’
‘Shut up, Goyle.’
Still, it wasn't too unpleasant. He mused that perhaps the hangover was dulling his panic, and he was beginning to believe he could get through the practice peacefully when the teams started mounting their brooms for a few flights before the game, and he saw Harry and Ron pushing each other as they flew at a low height - like bloody kindergarteners, for fuck's sake, did they not care about their well-being at all? - and something urgent and fearful grew inside him.
knotgrass. Do you even know what the assignment is, Weasley?’
‘Harry - Harry, would you bloody look? - there’s heart-shaped ones.’
She meant it, Draco could hear it in her voice. It didn’t ease him, however; it made it worse, because now she surely knew, he’d vanquished any doubts she might have. She knew,
The days went past. The whispering got bored and changed aims. Harry Potter wasn’t the name in everyone’s lips anymore. Draco still heard it.
, with her ginger hair and resolute eyes and feminine features, had caught his eye; that she was the one Harry looked at, while Draco loitered in the background, begging to be seen; hated that her arms had been around him, that their lips had met; that Harry still probably thought about her, and had her face in his fantasies, while Draco had never thought about anyone else but him, or fallen asleep with anyone else’s name on his lips.
‘Merlin,’ Harry panted, ‘Fuck,
‘Oh fuck off,’ Harry bit out, shifting his weight from foot to foot. ‘Better than the Shrieking Shack.’
‘Did you really have no suspicion those two were a thing?’ Harry asked, looking at the little red bag in his hands.
have it in for you? Hermione was apologizing,’ Harry shouted. Draco glanced up from the page at last: the other boy was soaked from head to toe, hair plastered to his forehead. It seemed blacker from the rain. His glasses were dripping, and his wet robes were pooling at his feet, hanging heavy from his arms.
Harry twisted his lips in what Draco assumed was an attempt to lie, smugness quickly leaving his expression. He sighed,  shaking his head with a hint of amusement.
unless Harry Potter was concerned.
Harry got the most innocent of flavours: chocolate, which he revealed to the group with partial bitterness, already glancing at Draco with expectant eyes.
Draco couldn't glimpse at a red and golden tie without thinking of him; he'd spot a redhead in the corridors and remember immediately of the Weasleys, and then of him; he'd pass the Fat Lady and wonder where he was; during storms, at night, whenever he heard thundering he was overcome with visions of his skin.
And they seemed to reach some kind of understanding, something solemnly trusting, like she’d finally accepted Draco into their lives, like she
The stairs Draco was on slid against the Fat Lady platform; Ron moved to get on them, but Draco stepped up first and stilled him with a hand on his chest.
‘Would you quit whining? I’ll stop in a minute,’ Draco dismissed, still tracing the fabric over his cock. Harry twitched in overstimulation and Draco smirked, pressing a kiss to the shell of his ear. ‘You
Draco smirked and shifted a little, moving so he was straddling Harry's hips, hands planted on his flushed stomach, arse pressing on his erection.
‘I’m sure we’d find ways to keep you entertained,’ he said gently, pressing a soothing hand to his lower back. Harry arched gratefully into the touch.
Harry suppressed a moan at that - quickly, but not enough that Draco couldn't hear the wanton beginnings of it, or feel the way his throat bobbed beneath his lips. He glared at Draco then, but it was half-hearted.
'I'll teach you,' Draco said, embarrassingly eager.
‘You better try hard, Potter.’
'Malfoy, fuck, Malfoy,' Harry was saying, urgent, in a pitched tone. Complying, so unbelievably sweet, saying Malfoy's name like it was some kind of prayer, so genuine that Draco was absolutely certain he was pretending, but he didn't even care, because it sounded bloody wonderful.
Pansy snorted. ‘Sounds about right.’
Harry just moaned in answer. His mouth was impossibly hot - from the vodka, from the firewhiskey, from those bloody fluorescent shots they'd had at Hog's Head that had burnt Draco's tongue - and Draco could barely keep himself together.
At last, and quite surprisingly, Harry broke into a small laugh. His voice, when he spoke, was hushed, like he didn’t want the drunken couple to hear.
‘Ages ago. We were waiting for you slowpoke,’ Sue said before turning to Draco. ‘Why’d he punch you?’
Harry retorted. He deflated, regarding Draco softly. ‘Are you cross? Do you want me to tell them?’
He had one more reason he didn’t want to move to that house left.
Nothing good lay on the other side of the door. He couldn’t resist though. He had to know.
‘Don’t call me that.’ He grumbled, settling into his favourite armchair, a beautiful Slytherin green.
They fell into silence, Malfoy’s attention finally shifting off him enough that he managed to get though a whole page. He heard pages flicking across from him, but that might be Malfoy reading or could be his version of a workout for all Harry know, and he refused to look up again. Refused to be the first one to break the comfortable silence settling between them.
He hadn’t lost as much as he should have. He had a family left to celebrate with. The Weasley’s, the Lupins, both were still complete. Surrounded by family he’d forgotten him.
He reached out his spare arm, clinging to Harry’s as he reached him. It took him a second for their sweaty hands to slip between one another and Ron’s voice cried out again.
Screams rose in the room. Draco knew how this part went but he still found himself clutching to Greg’s arm at his side like so many others in the room. He couldn’t help glancing around the hall, he knew the spell, he knew the monster in question wasn’t actually here, but something about that voice drove any logical thought from his mind.
Draco woke wrapped in the warm arms of … someone … trapped in the sheets, terrified.
‘So … definitely a no to Baby Draco?’ Finally, they turned back to him and he took the out.
‘Excellent.’ They chorused together.
‘We have already placed protection around the castle,’ McGonagall continued, as though anyone was still listening to her, ‘but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -’
Draco frowned; he hadn’t seen that one coming. But potions master, double agent, working for a psychopath who likes killing and snakes. It made sense he guessed that he’d been prepared for exactly this … that didn’t make it even slightly okay.
There was a terrible scream. Snape's face lost the little colour it had; it whitened as his black eyes widened. Nagini’s fangs pierced his neck. His hands flailed and fumbled as they tried desperately to push the enchanted cage off himself. Within moments his knees gave way, and he sank to the floor.
‘But- How-’ Harry murmured against his lips between kisses.
He wasn’t sure when Malfoy’s voice had slipped into the mix, but he was a regular now.
‘He’s smart.’ Two ears chortled.
‘-I don’t want to be alone.’
He – the him stuck in the past – had to fight the war, had to survive the outcome, was probably missing Potter?!
Harry tensed, wondering whether Professor Trelawney remembered anything about the infamous prophecy she had made that night.
Harry couldn’t sleep that night. All he could think about was what was going on with Malfoy. He wasn’t a Death Eater but Harry would eat his sock if Voldemort wasn’t somehow involved. But what would Voldemort trust a sixteen-year-old to do?
“Professor, are you alright?” asked Harry, carefully stepping around what looked like the remains of a sherry bottle.
Unbidden, the memory of Cedric Diggory, dead in the graveyard from the Killing Curse, came to mind. Harry pictured Draco’s corpse crumpled on the ground, or Draco writhing in excruciating pain under the Cruciatus Curse like Neville last year at the Department of Mysteries. He thought he might vomit.
“So you’re doing something to gain favor with him,” said Harry. "What is it?"
Harry peered into the boys’ bathroom and saw the unlikely pairing of a crying Malfoy hunched over the sink and a dry-faced Moaning Myrtle hovering over him. The Marauder’s Map had shown the two together but seeing them together in their respectively uncharacteristic states of distress was even more surreal.
,” she said, her face contorting in disgust. “Okay. At least we’re not facing Slytherin tomorrow. Okay. But really, out of all people, Malfoy?”
Ginny rolled her eyes again, though the effect was lessened by her struggle with the Bludger. “You’re not exactly subtle,” she panted as she wrestled the ball into submission. “You stare at the Slytherin table whenever we eat, and all I hear you, Ron, and Hermione talking about these days is Malfoy. I can put two and two together.”
Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy by the shoulders. Malfoy seemed too stunned by his Muggle approach to react.
“Shhh!” hissed Harry, glancing around to see if anyone heard. Luckily, the Great Hall was as full of talking and laughter as usual.
Greyback stepped forward eagerly. “
Malfoy snorted. “Don’t talk about things you don’t understand.”
“Yes, he and that barman were at the door, spying on my interview! Not that it was particularly surprising, I am quite well known within certain circles, undoubtedly they were hoping for an autograph from such an esteemed Seer. Dumbledore gave me the job as soon as they were gone, and I am sure he did not know of my celebrity status before they came along so perhaps it was for the best. You see, you’re not the only one who struggles with the burden of fame, Harry – Harry?” She looked down at Harry’s painfully tight grip on her arm.
“The only way Dumbledore could help me is if he choked to death on his toast tomorrow morning,” said Malfoy. “And if you want to help me, make that happen. In the meantime, leave me alone or I’ll hex you.”
Harry looked up at the starry night, but couldn’t find Draco’s constellation.
There was a ringing silence. Harry took some deep breaths and unclenched his hands with great difficulty. Fawkes chirped and hesitantly poked his head out from under his wing, where he had been hiding from the noise.
“Don’t cry,” said Myrtle in a surprisingly comforting voice. She reached out a translucent hand to rest on Malfoy’s shoulder. He jumped a little, and Harry winced at the thought of feeling an ice cold hand grab onto one’s shoulder. “It’ll be alright, we can figure this out together.”
As Harry walked out of the girls’ bathroom on one such visit, he ran into Jimmy Peakes.
Harry struggled hard against the curse, but he couldn’t speak or move.
Myrtle squealed and disappeared through a wall. Harry threw up a shield charm, knowing it would do nothing to stop the curse, but all that happened was a small fizzle of violet light. Malfoy furrowed his brow at his wand.
Hermione’s eyes were very round. “I can’t believe he used an Unforgivable!” she said. “He should be expelled from Hogwarts at the very least.”
(“But why were you holding his hand for so long?” “I was not holding his hand!”), Harry went to find his two best friends for dinner.
Malfoy immediately glared at Harry, who was sitting on the floor under the tapestry. “I know you live a mundane, mediocre life, but do you really have nothing better to do, Potter?”
what he thought about while unconscious. He had even dreamed about Voldemort before, and Harry certainly did not like the mass murderer. Harry had obviously been distracted by the lunacy Ginny had been spouting after practice. Sure, Draco had really nice hair and he had that little frown he got when he concentrated on something, but –
“You like Draco Malfoy!” accused Ginny, with a look of horror. “Merlin. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.”
“Rosmerta,” said Dumbledore, and coughed weakly. “Help me up. Do you have” – Dumbledore staggered, his face pallid with sweat, and Harry and Rosmerta reached out to steady him – “I’m fine, I’m fine, we must go at once. Rosmerta, do you have brooms?”
Suddenly, Harry noticed the excited shouting from the spectators. He looked around wildly and saw Cho diving for a golden speck near the opposite goalposts. He urged his broom to go faster, faster, until his hand closed upon the Snitch a split second before Cho could.
Harry drank another two cups of tea while waiting and could feel the unfortunate combination of no sleep and caffeine taking its toll. He shivered and thought longingly of his wonderfully warm, soft bed less than ten flights of stairs away.
They had arrived back in Hogsmeade, but Dumbledore was so weak Harry could barely keep them both standing. They collapsed upon the side of the street for a few minutes, dripping and freezing, but just thankful to be alive and in possession of the golden locket.
Malfoy stared at him in alarm. “If you following me around every night constitutes leaving me alone in your book, I don’t even want to know what not leaving me alone entails. How do you even know where I am all the time? I checked myself for tracking spells and unless you’re stalking me under your Invisibility Cloak all day…”
“Definitely not,” said Harry firmly. “Besides, in case you’ve forgotten, he’s not the only one who has cast the Cruciatus curse.”
“This is for you,” said Jimmy, handing him a scroll of parchment. “So, uh, what were you doing in there?”
“Harry!” Fawkes let out a long, mournful note, and Harry noticed that for the first time, Dumbledore’s voice held a hint of anger.
He recounted the events of the past night.
“What? I do not!” said Harry, feeling very wrong-footed. This was not how he expected the conversation to go.
Harry paused. “I forgot to tell you about that last year, didn’t I?” He filled them in on what had happened with Bellatrix Lestrange.
Greyback still hadn’t taken his eyes off of Dumbledore. “We’re to take the Malfoys to him, dead or alive. Though his Lordship didn’t say we couldn’t play with them before handing them over.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes again. “What do you want?” he said aggressively, though he lowered his wand.
“I know he’s on a mission for Voldemort!” said Harry loudly. “Malfoy’s not a Death Eater yet” –
Myrtle gave Harry a hateful look.
“Do you promise to tell me what happened after you find out?” she said.
“Merlin’s beard,” yelped Malfoy, hand flying towards his wand. “Oh. Not you again.”
“That’s wonderful!” said Hermione, relieved. “Dumbledore will take care of everything.”
“Harry,” said Dumbledore, a little more firmly. There were some gasps and mutters and disapproving looks from the portraits, but Harry was still too incensed to stop.
Myrtle huffed. “You ignore me when I try to talk to me, then you walk straight through me?” she said indignantly. “How could you? I thought you were better than that!”
“Harry Potter? Is that you?” she said, reaching out to grab his arm and missing by about a foot. A couple more sherry bottles tumbled out of her shawl, and she kicked them to the side of the hallway. “I was just thinking about how wonderful it was having you in class before. A terrible Seer of course, but such an interesting Object to See…”
“I should think not,” said Professor McGonagall, her mouth thinning dangerously. “After your poor performance in our last Transfiguration class, I would highly advise you to focus on learning how to transform Cauldron Cakes into cabbages instead of chasing after castle gossip.”
“You told me over and over to trust him! That he’s on our side! He was friends with my mum before, I saw, and he still sold her out!”
Malfoy nodded, eyes unreadable.
“Let me see your left arm,” insisted Harry. He needed to know whether Malfoy was a Death Eater, and he needed to know now.
But alas, both Snape and Draco were absent. Professor McGonagall began teaching with no further explanation than “Professor Snape is indisposed.” Harry stayed back after the bell rang to ask whether she had any news on Snape or Draco.
Harry checked to make sure every part of him was covered by the Invisibility Cloak, and held very still.
“Yes, Professor Snape will help protect them from Voldemort and his Death Eaters. They are undoubtedly looking for the Malfoys already,” said Dumbledore, his face sobering.
“I don’t stare,” said Harry, tightening the strap on the Quaffle unnecessarily to avoid looking at Ginny. “And there’s really nothing going on.”
This one was a bit different to my usual style. Please let me know if you enjoyed it and if I should put up some more short ones! It was fun <3
‘You little cheat.’ Draco smirked back, a flash of teeth in his smile. ‘Alright, I’ll see if I can dumb down my answers enough for the teacher to believe it came from you.’
‘He's dead,’ spat Ron.
‘But-’ The Aurors walked forward, he felt the cold chains on his arms, leeching the magic from his body. It took fucking magic to maintain the womb. He couldn’t- He had to-
Blaise stared at him for a moment, so many more questions and fear at the name mentioned, but he didn’t waste time. He nodded, chasing after Tonks while weaving a moving Disillusionment charm around him.
‘You sure? How about Draco the Second then?’ The first one corrected.
‘Double D then?’ One twin suggested as the other shook his head.
Harry thought about getting annoyed at the obvious jab. He really did. But to do so would be ignoring the much more important fact here that he didn’t have to do his homework anymore. As much as he. And all of Gryffindor really, had teased Draco for losing to Hermione (in most classes), he was just behind her in grades. Even with his idea of ‘dumbed down’ answers, he’d be giving the right ones.
Draco was blocked from moving any further forward. The crush of the crowd was too much to wade through. Harry had pulled back and was looking around. Just a little further and he’d see him, then-
‘Yeah, great. Go on you two, have fun.’ He managed to muster up enough enthusiasm to push them down the corridor, not that they really needed the encouragement.
Minor victory. He’d never managed a panic attack like that without Harry’s arms around him. If he had a say in it then he wouldn’t have to again.
That brought up a whole other bucket of questions. He was in his body, not the one from the time he was in. Did that mean there was another him here? Like a time-turner travel situation? Probably not, he remembered still being in his bed at the moment so they would have crossed paths, and a time-turner wouldn’t have sent him back to Hogwarts. Whatever it was, he had to be who he was.
‘I … Hadn’t thought about it.’ Harry thought about what he knew about the room, what he knew about ghosts, neither topic he had much information on really. ‘I mean … you have to know what kind of room you want from outside, don’t you? What if you weren’t in the room I thought of? What if me trying to create you a room meant you … I don’t know … didn’t exist anymore?’
‘Not the house. That’s completely the fault of the assholes used to live there.’
‘Why can’t I just Floo straight to him? I can stay there. I can just stay with him!’
Draco nodded and saw what he needed to in Blaise’s face to turn and walk out of the castle. The fist death was Lupin’s from what he could tell. Dead before the Death Eater’s broke into the castle proper, which meant, to save him, they were heading outside, into the centre of the war.
Potter looked like he was barely containing his laughter.
‘Why were you thinking about ghosts sleeping?’ He asked, turning his head but not moving away from the door.
Of course, he was worried about her, he tried to ignore the flair of jealousy, he’d worked past that a long time ago.
‘You definitely hated me when I died. I remember that moment. That fight. It’s seared in my memory. My last moments in the flames. You may have tried to save me, but there was still hatred in your eyes.’
The sorting seemed more subdued. There were less new kids being sorted. They still cheered as anyone entered their houses, but it was more out of habit than joy.
‘What's that matter?’ Crabbe grumbled as he tried to tug himself free. ‘It's Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?’
‘No,’ Hermione cut through, the voice of reason, getting to her feet too.
‘You’re-’
‘Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately.
‘What the fuck-?!’
His breathing began to shake, and he stared into the light for a moment, holding his breath before he felt he could begin again. One, two, three, four, five – in – one, two, three, four, five – out –
Draco’s eyes were open for about three seconds before it clicked into place. This morning, this particular morning, waking up in his bed back at Hogwarts was etched into his brain. He’d had nightmares about it so many times before. The day he almost (and probably should have if it wasn’t for Potter’s stupid saviour complex) died.
His hand brushed against his stomach. Harry had wanted this. He’d begged him and Draco had given in, like he always did to Harry’s giant green eyes. And now, he was doing this alone.
‘You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.’
The heavy, gaping silence of death where there should have been a cutting glare and life.
Something more than blood was leaking from Severus. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, they were the memories he’d given Harry. Draco didn’t even know they could be given that way. Harry looked lost and, not for the first time, he was relieved for Hermione’s quick thinking as she conjured and forced a flask into his shaking hand.
That wasn’t meant to happen. That couldn’t have happened.
Merlin, that was going to get annoying. Fred was dead by the time he hung out with the Weasley’s. Maybe that wasn’t ENTIRELY a bad thing. So, they were all he had? That’s couldn’t be right …
He might have a similar issue with Ginny as Draco had … shit.
Draco looked away from him, staring out into the black of further into the room.
He’d just reached the exit when he heard the screams. He turned and saw nothing but fire. Then the broom lurched and they were both thrown off into the corridor. Free.
‘Something you want to tell me, Harry?’
‘Ron!’ Harry bellowed, as somewhere in the room Hermione screamed.
He couldn’t imagine a world where his godfather hadn’t died (and Harry could avoid the extra guilt of hating a man who honestly did hate him but had a bit of the wrong end of the stick). George not losing his twin and becoming the shell of a man that Draco had gotten to know, that gaping hole at all the family dinners filled with the twin’s pranks. Teddy with parents.
Fuck, where did that thought come from.
‘We were the first time.’ Answered double eared.
‘You're joking, Perce!’ shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground as Fred looked at Percy with glee.
The twins came barrelling through, Fred and George a little worse for wear, bloodied and bruised but both standing, both laughing with the pure exhilaration of being alive, of being on the winning side. Drawing Harry’s attention away from him again.
Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes fixed on the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.
‘He’s not a clone though-’ Twin 1.
He took his baby into the war!
‘Because now I know you. Who wouldn’t want you …?’
‘Hello, Minister!’ bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. ‘Did I mention I'm resigning?’
‘You think it’s okay for you to just let us all think you died? To leave us? Leave me?!’
Harry lent off the side of his broom, reaching out for Malfoy’s outstretched hand. His fingers brushed against his just as the blonde boy dropped his arm, shifting back and sliding a step down the melting pile. Crabbe’s thick arm lunged out immediately in his place, clutching to Harry’s arm, yanking the broom to the side as he was pulled up to safety. The whole thing only took a portion of a second and he swerved away, rushing to the exit, hoping he could still survive this. But that final expression on Malfoy’s face stayed with him. Determined, resigned, his lips set in a hard grimace against the pain, but he looked proud, even with tears streaking down his face, as though he thought he’d done the right thing for once.
The ground opened up beneath Dolohov’s feet. It was a crack, it was smooth, like the hole had been waiting beneath him and had only just been given permission to show itself. Dolohov didn’t fall, he didn’t sink, he slipped, smoothly into the nothing that closed over him. Arm raised to try to claw at the edges, but the earth crumbled beneath his touch, dragging him down with it before filling in the spot where he was without a mark. Leaving the ground as it was, lacking one Death Eater. Buried alive.
‘You dictate, I’ll write.’
He looked different. Brighter, fuller, happier, more confident. He still looked enough like the Potter from his time to bring out the same response though. The snide comments already chocking him. The cold glare already settled in his eyes while the Malfoy sneer crept across his face. All lovely things if he wasn’t facing possibly his only ally in this world. He needed to get his feet under him before he made (remade?) an enemy of the man.
Draco didn’t think. To his side he heard Blaise calling out a Protego thrown in Lupin’s direction. He didn’t know why, but Draco had said save him, so they weren’t going to let him fall. Lupin stared out as the purple flames hit the invisible wall in front of him. The confusion at seeing two Slytherins help him froze him. Dolohov wasn’t as easily distracted. His wand raised again going straight for the killing curse, Draco’s spell left his lips first.
‘They kicked Serious out.’
From the look in the eyes of the men trying him, that still might not be enough though. He needed something else, something more, something that proved he wasn’t just a Death Eater.
The grin on Draco’s face was so wide it almost looked painful, showing far too many teeth.
‘Labellum terrae!’ he screamed across the field, the only thing he could think of that would stop him, thrown with more power than he’d put behind it before he wasn’t expecting the effect it had.
Ron and Hermione followed back to the stretch of wall beyond where the Room of Requirement was waiting. Harry paced past while Draco watched, the door appearing at the third lap and the three of them slid inside. He left his hiding spot, walking straight to where Greg and Vince were waiting, the tell-tale shimmer of a weak spell outlining them.
‘Of course we’re in this time.’ Chorused single ear.
He sounded crazed; his voice was surprisingly good at that that hint of mad desperation. It probably came from the Black side of the family.
They crawled through a tunnel, he was quiet enough compared to Harry that he went unnoticed, but when they reached the end, he couldn’t see anything, he could barely hear them. He had to get somewhere else. He twisted the wand between his fingers, he could force it to work, at least he thought he could. Of all the spells he had to test it out on though …
Childish, yes.
‘Well, you’re in a mood today.’
A groggy voice cut through his thoughts.
‘I – I have no explanation, my Lord.’
They both grinned their toothy, satisfied grins at each other.
‘How dare you?!’ His screams sounded shrill even to his own ears, but he couldn’t control them.
‘It’s just, she’s worried about my scores-’
Married to Harry Potter …
‘Not here …?’ He couldn’t resist asking, he knew he didn’t want to hear the answer, but the question slipped out before he could stop it.
The reaction was guarded as he knew it would be, he saw the confusion and restrained questions in his eyes but only one slipped through. Spoken carefully as though not to actually question it but just to confirm Draco knew what he was doing.
It was his fucking fault anyway.
Draco stared back at the ceiling, humming softly in what could have been agreement, or just general sadness. There were no words that could follow that. Nothing left to be said in that moment between them.
‘The door, get to the door, the door!’ Draco screamed in Harry's ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke. They could hardly breathe. All around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an old, discoloured tiara –
It didn’t.
Draco cringed, not at the name but at Harry’s terrible attempt at a distraction technique. What, was his plan to ask inane questions until the other two turned up to fight three on three? As if they’d let him waste their time like that-
If they both lived through this then he owed him that at least. Not the truth, obviously, but he could think of something.
Greg’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; he leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it. Draco jumped out of range of Hermione's second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, in the chaos of everyone else’s movements it narrowly missed. Well done, the battling lions had managed to rend the two ‘not attackers’ wandless. Very helpful.
He tripped out of the bed, pulling the blankets off the naked man beside him.
, he just wanted Snape, Draco got cut off before he could ask.
His release had been remarkably different last time. Something about having The Chosen One arguing on your behalf left little room for doubt. This time … well this time there was only him, and the thing growing in him. If he could explain how that came from their Golden Boy too they’d probably – well, let’s be honest – they’d probably lock him up faster or walk him out to get the kiss straight away before they had the displeasure of proving or disproving it.
That was a good thing. An amazing thing. That gorgeous, happy little boy deserved nothing less. But he KNEW that they wouldn’t want him in his life, nowhere near the amount he had been if at all. It felt like the life he’d created with Potter was slipping away further and further with every thought.
Ron groaned. “Why don’t I have any friends who are fun and not completely insane?” he asked his blueberry muffin gloomily before biting into it.
“Harry!” Hermione went into a lecture about controlling your emotions and not using spells that could end up with him locked up for life. When she started to describe ancient meditation techniques proven to help calm boiling rage, Harry decided to cut her off.
“Get your filthy hands off of me,” snapped Malfoy. He pulled hard against Harry’s grip but Harry refused to let go.
Harry glanced around, hoping for a distraction to end this conversation, but the corridor was unfortunately empty.
“Draco hasn’t come visit me for three days now!” she wailed. “I miss him, and I know he misses me too. He’s lonely just like me. He
Harry sighed. “Are you doing alright?”
Malfoy looked even more alarmed and eyed Harry suspiciously. Harry hoped Malfoy never found out about how he used Kreacher as a spy for a few weeks.
“For trying to use the Cruciatus Curse?”
The practice went fairly well for everyone except for Harry. He had several narrow misses from Bludgers when his mind wandered to thoughts of a certain blond-haired Slytherin. After the fourth time he nearly ran into a goalpost, Ginny pulled him aside and quietly informed him that unless he got his mind in the game, he would have to answer to her. Fear of Ginny’s wrath drove him to catch the Snitch shortly after and end their practice scrimmage on a happy note.
“What? I didn’t do anything! Do you know where he is?” asked Harry eagerly. Perhaps Myrtle had heard something from the other ghosts.
“Since when do you call him Draco?” said Ron, repulsed.
Harry was momentarily distracted by the thought of Malfoy and samba dancing. “I’m serious,” he said, scowling at Malfoy. “I’m not leaving you alone until you tell me.”
With more strength than Harry thought possible, Dumbledore grabbed onto Greyback with both arms and launched them over the ramparts. Alecto screeched and ran towards the wall. Snape silently Stunned her from behind, and she fell to the ground in an unconscious lump.
Malfoy snarled at him and his hand went for his wand, but Harry was quicker. He pushed Malfoy’s sleeve up and saw pale, unblemished skin. No Mark.
Harry waited around an hour on the seventh floor before Malfoy stepped out of the Room of Requirement, looking wan and exhausted.
“Crucio,” said Malfoy again, uncertainly. This time, nothing happened at all.
Ron yawned widely. Hermione said wearily, “For the last time, Malfoy was just being his usual vitriolic self. He’s not trying to murder Dumbledore using toast. Now could we please talk about something else? Have either of you done the essay on animal-to-animal transfiguration for Professor McGonagall? We have a bit of time before our first class, I was thinking we could go to the library and get a head start.”
“I know it has something to do with Malfoy,” she said.
“I want to know what you were talking about earlier,” said Harry. He took a step closer to Malfoy, who stepped back looking alarmed. “It sounded like you need help.”
“But what do you think he meant by that?” said Harry as he spooned an unhealthy amount of sugar into his third cup of tea that morning. The dark circles under his eyes spoke to his late night, but a glance at Malfoy told him the blond git looked as put together as ever.
“You could smell me?” said Harry, slightly disturbed.
“I’ll get him to talk,” said Greyback, smiling as he reached towards Dumbledore.
,” he mocked, flexing his hands, “you could be persuaded to tell us what you know.”
Snape was the one who told Voldemort about the prophecy all those years ago, and the reason Harry grew up an unloved orphan with a lightning bolt scar. Snape was the one responsible for his parents’ deaths, one of whom had been his childhood best friend.
After wasting some time (untruthfully) convincing Myrtle that he and Malfoy would no longer fight and even more time (very much truthfully) convincing Myrtle that he was not interested in Malfoy like
“I’ll be waiting,” she said forebodingly, sinking slowly down through the floor until she disappeared.
, he reminded himself.
Malfoy snorted. “After the fiasco last year at the Ministry? The Dark Lord doesn’t trust my family at all.”
“Oh, uh, sorry,” said Harry hastily as Myrtle’s eyes filled with tears. “I didn’t mean to, I was just thinking about something else.”
Harry numbly let go of Professor Trelawney, who immediately swayed backwards a little before righting herself with a hand on the wall. He paid her no attention. His heart was pounding very fast, as he realized several things at once.
“What?” said Harry.
At those words, Harry’s temper flared up again. “How can you be sure Snape’s on our side?” he demanded, now pacing back and forth in a concerted effort to burn off his restless anger. “Voldemort trusts Snape as much as you do, but one of you has to be wrong. How are you so sure you’re right? This is Draco’s
we’re talking about!”
“Would you just come out from under your Invisibility Cloak?” said Malfoy, crossing his arms. “I would prefer to see you while discussing why you insist on following me around.”
“Mr. Malfoy and I will talk with Dumbledore in the morning,” announced Snape wearily. “Potter, get out of my sight.”
“Protect? You really think Snape will
“I’m not lovesick!” said Harry as Ginny walked away towards the castle. “It’s not like that!”
“You mean, after my mum died,” retorted Harry. “He hated my dad.”
Dumbledore waved aside her concerned protests, and Harry Summoned the brooms from behind the bar. They mounted their brooms and flew off for Hogwarts, leaving Rosmerta, who was clearly terrified, to alert the Aurors.
As soon as he was released, Malfoy straightened his sleeve and, with one last disdainful look at Harry, swept off. Harry sighed and turned around to see Myrtle’s very wide eyes staring back at him.
Harry’s thoughts immediately went to Draco, and his blood ran cold. Had the Death Eaters caught up with the Malfoys already, and left Draco’s body as an example to his fellow classmates? Or perhaps it was Ron or Hermione or Ginny, caught by the wrong people at the wrong time.
Instead, he found something much more alarming.
Harry rushed over but Professor Trelawney was already on her feet again. She tilted to the side, and Harry hastily took her arm.
Ginny punched him in the arm hard as she flew past on her broom. “Harry James Potter, I will kill you!” she hollered at him. “Get the Snitch!”
Before Harry arrived at the Headmaster’s office, he was accosted by Ginny who dragged him off to the Gryffindor Quidditch team meeting he had organized and apparently forgotten about. They went over their strategies against Ravenclaw until dinner, after which they had a final practice before their game tomorrow.
Dumbledore exhaled, and walked over to Fawkes, who looked rather upset by the turn of events. “Harry,” said Dumbledore as he gently patted the phoenix on his head.
The sound of footsteps pounding up the stairs caused them to look towards the door as one. Harry hoped desperately for one of the professors to show up. Dumbledore would surely be able to defeat the two Death Eaters with the help of Professor McGonagall or Professor Flitwick.
“Why didn’t you turn me in?”
“Does it have something to do with Voldemort?”
“Uncle Severus?” called Draco.
He ignored Professor Trelawney’s protests and found himself past the gargoyle, up the spiral staircase, and outside the Headmaster’s door with barely any recollection of how he got there. He entered the office without knocking.
It was Professor Snape.
“But he was really upset. He was in
She trailed off, one eye twitching at the thought.
“I promised Draco and his family my help should they renounce Voldemort,” said Dumbledore sternly. “As Headmaster, the safety of my students are of the utmost importance to me. Even if Draco isn’t at Hogwarts at the moment, he is still a student of this school.”
Madam Rosmerta burst out of the Three Broomsticks in her nightgown, clutching her wand in a tight grip. “Albus? Is that you? Are you hurt?”
“Hmm,” he said noncommittally.
“He used the Cruciatus?” said Ron loudly.
With one last judgmental sneer at Harry’s tea, Snape cleared his throat and said, “Now. What could have possibly been so important that you knocked on my door at four in the morning?”
Snape and Draco finally came out of the room, neither looking too happy. Draco looked sullenly defiant, and his silver blond hair was mussed as if he had run his hands through it in frustration. Snape had a vein pulsing in his left temple.
them?” snarled Harry, hands balling into fists. “Even after he SOLD OUT MY MUM AND DAD?”
“How rude!” cried a voice inside him.
Malfoy’s jaw clenched. “You can let go of me now,” he said very coldly, and Harry realized he was still holding Malfoy’s wrist.
Sure enough, Harry was standing next to the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy when Malfoy came into view. The Slytherin took a few steps, hesitated, and tapped his nose with his wand. Malfoy sniffed the air and looked straight at Harry.
“Are you in danger?” Malfoy’s jaw clenched, and Harry said, “You should talk to Dumbledore. He can help you.”
The next morning, Harry did his best to focus lest he be persecuted by his housemates for losing the match (he had no doubt Ginny would spread the word that Harry had been too busy thinking about Draco to catch the Snitch).
The next night, Harry and Ron feverishly wrote their Herbology essays under the disapproving eye of Hermione. They tolerated her reprimands for not starting their work earlier in exchange for her invaluable help. Even so, they didn’t finish the required ten inches on the properties and uses of Alihotsy until a couple hours past midnight.
A few months ago, Harry had realized that every morning without fail, Malfoy only went for raspberry jam and would even go as far as walking over to the Ravenclaw table if there was none left for the Slytherins. He had watched for weeks, trying to figure out whether there was a secret code he was missing, before giving it up. But really, who likes raspberry jam more than strawberry jam?
Snape said nothing, but a muscle in his jaw jumped. He and Dumbledore stared at each other for a long moment. Snape looked away first, his mouth curving downward into a sneer.
“That’s not funny,” yelled Harry as Malfoy walked away. Harry took out the Marauder’s Map as soon as he was out of sight and watched Malfoy’s dot meander back to the Slytherin dorms before heading back to bed.
Harry looked at the door with a sense of impending doom. “This is ridiculous. Let’s at least wait until morning. He already hates me, he’s going to kill me if we wake him up right now.”
“You will never cease to make my life that much more difficult, will you Mr. Potter?” said Snape despairingly, and pointed his wand at Harry’s face. “
“Not too late,” repeated Malfoy, so softly Harry barely heard him. “Right.”
The two walked into an adjoining room and closed the door. Snape must have cast a Silencing spell because Harry couldn’t hear a word.
Harry gave a start. “Professor Snape?”
“Where have you been?” demanded Alecto, rounding on Snape angrily. “The Dark Lord has been asking for you for several days now. You better have a good explanation for him.”
“I do not like Draco!” said Harry loudly, hoping extra volume would bring Ginny out of her delusions.
“Of course, precious Potter wants to play the hero,” said Malfoy, throwing his wand back in his pocket with a snort. “But there’s no damsel in distress here for you to save. Fuck off.”
“Professor! Sir, look!”
“Unforgivables are a one-way ticket to Azkaban, Harry!” cried Hermione, and Harry quickly shushed her. “He can't get away with this,” she continued in a lower voice, but no less vehement. “You have to tell Professor Dumbledore.”
Malfoy flushed a delicate pink, visible even in the dark corridor. “Getting back to the issue, would you quit following me around?”
Malfoy looked up, and his bloodshot eyes met Harry’s in the mirror. He immediately spun around and hexed Harry who dodged and drew his wand. They exchanged several spells, none hitting the other but destroying the bathroom quite thoroughly. Myrtle shouted at them to stop, trying to get in the crossfire, but the spells went straight through her with no effect.
A woman with a stocky build and sloped shoulders aimed her wand straight between Dumbledore’s eyes. “Where have you hidden the blood traitors? The Dark Lord would like a word with them.”
Harry walked out of the classroom in a foul mood. He stormed down the corridor but suddenly felt a horrible cold rush all over his body.
That night found Harry striding determinedly to the seventh floor. After a few minutes, Malfoy appeared and Harry came out from the shadowy alcove where he was lurking.
and bashing the delivery owl on the beak. “Not again! Do you realize that for the past four days in a row, all you’ve been talking about is Malfoy and what he’s doing all day?”
Draco gave Harry a look that clearly said,
“I see,” said Snape, whose pained expression was not of one who understood what was going on.
“You like Malfoy.
“Oh hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically.
Harry sat upright with a huff of frustration. He put on his glasses, and rummaged for the Marauder’s Map below his bed. Lighting his wand, he searched for Malfoy’s dot and found him not in the Slytherin dorms but heading up the fifth floor staircase.
‘So where’d you get the book from?’ asked Draco.
die?’ Figures you’d all be into Quidditch - all brawn and no brain,’ Draco said, all of him tense, spying from the corner of his eye as Harry’s joyful demeanour crumbled. Draco hated it, that he was playing the bad guy, the one who broke the mood, but it wasn’t like he had a choice, did he? He was there to help, and he’d been willing to play perfectly nice - or as nice as he could be, in his current state - when the bloody Weasleys, lap dogs as they were, insufferably loud and inconveniently opinionated, had started hounding.
‘I’m just playing the game, Malfoy. What are you doing?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Of course they are. They’re bloody daft,’ Hermione huffed. Draco would have felt a pang of sympathy for her, if he wasn’t otherwise concerned - she really was the reason those nitwits had survived long enough to face the war.
'So you did.'
'You know, technically, it has to be the best,' he drawled, trying to ignore how unbalanced he felt.
'Two shots of firewhiskey. Three, actually,' he told the waiter in the stodgy new pub, Kettle Bottom.
; the drinking game, his fingers running across his scar, the phoenix glitter, Harry kissing him that first time, his pale hips writhing against the graffitied tiles.
Harry’s eyes - beautiful, Draco bloody
Draco frowned. ‘Do you have to stay overnight?’
‘How’s the rest of you? Besides the arm, I mean. And the head.’
Because Draco had always felt that - he'd known ever since a child that he felt love for Potter. But his love hadn't bloomed normal, and it grew dark: old and bored, attached to all the fucked up things he'd done in order to conceal it. Draco Malfoy was not supposed to want to hold the Chosen One's hand, yet he did, ever since first year, and now the want had dulled, and he'd become accustomed to it, just as one does to a weak heart. It was a constant hurt, like a bad back, that Draco had endured for so long that he couldn't remember standing without its weight on his shoulder or breathing without its hold in his lungs. An indissociable part of him, his love for Harry, but nonetheless resigned: it was purposeless, and it was effortless, like correcting his name to Potter when he thought of him, or telling the world what he felt was hatred.
Draco tried his best to pry his eyes away from the curve of Harry’s neck, where the skin was flushing from the cold. ‘None.’
'Oh,' Harry said, and Draco could practically see, from all his years of experience, the devilish smirk that was blooming on his face, 'I fucking knew you'd liked it, Malfoy.'
Apparently, it had not been a wise question to ask, since Ron reddened with anger.
‘Guarding the door, Granger?’ he sneered. His fingers were tersely clutching the large box.
He’d lurked in those streets once.
He worked Harry up to a frenzied state, feeling him tighten and tense against him, trying so hard to restrain himself from thrusting into Draco's mouth. Fucking
it was a horrid idea. He
‘Oy, Malfoy!’
sort of feelings for him. It wasn’t like he’d been subtle. What could honesty cost him, then?
‘You’re always wandering around at night anyway,’ Draco ventured. ‘One would think you’d like the challenge of sneaking into the Slytherin area.’
‘You’ve
When Potter had asked him if Draco was suggesting he got better company, Draco could have been brave and said 'yes'. He could have said 'Me'. He could have told Potter - with one single fucking word, no effort at all - that he was equally fit to be his friend; that he'd excell at it, even, because he knew what jokes he liked, and he'd be much more reliable than all those flimsy Gryffindors that could barely stand straight after two drinks, and he wasn't too scared to tell the Chosen One that he wasn't fooling anyone by chewing on the same burnt piece of toast for the entirety of breakfast, and to make him sit down and eat properly for once since he'd fucking gotten to Hogwarts.
‘Ron,’ Harry urged, leaning forward to catch him by the shoulder. ‘Don’t tell her.’
when he put down the glass.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘One would think that you’d be familiar with the term ‘procrastination’. Or is the word too long for you?’
'A Friday night without alcohol, though,' he mused, words carefully light as he stepped closer to Harry. 'I'm sure it's the first one you've had in a while. Is it too terrible?'
‘We don’t expect you to either,’ Harry replied, his eyes landing on Draco for a second with a hint of challenge - like he
‘And you have- Merlin, will you stop tilting to the right, you twat!’
The sun set. Pansy caught him heading to change clothes, and promptly changed as well.
Harry had his glass in his hand. Draco thought - idly, as one thinks of a disaster a millisecond before it happens - that if Harry drank he would most likely not think of anything else for the rest of his life.
- was.
going to Hogsmeade next week.'
Harry suppressed a little smile, his cheeks so deliciously red, his gaze still on the table.
One of the shelves shook as Harry shrugged. It was half-hearted, Draco could see.
‘Of course I did, what you did was fucking stupid,’ Harry snorted.

There was a retort somewhere that he could have used, something akin to flirtation, if he was bolder. But Potter’s friends were there, Pansy was staring, and Potter’s unfaltering expression, all humour and courage and
It was ridiculous, really - by this point, Hermione and Ron knew more about how Draco felt than Harry himself.
‘I punched him,’ Finnigan supplied in an offhand tone. ‘Is Ginny back from the loo?’
this our first date?'
And Harry looked so genuinely worried.
Hours later, long after the sun had set, once the castle was dark and deserted, Draco left the library and retired to the dungeons for the night. Against the smooth stone wall, right where the secret entrance to the common room laid, rested a black umbrella.
Harry laughed, soft and bright-eyed, resting his hands in the crooks of Draco’s elbows.
'Well,' Pansy uttered, her head cocked to the side, 'You've been terribly rude to him.'
‘Malfoy.’
‘D’you have to be quite so loud?’
‘Bastard,’ Blaise cried, stepping away from Pike in one of his flourished movements. Pike, the smitten fool, seemed genuinely sad for a moment. ‘Now, Draco, hurry and put on a nicer shirt. Say what you’d like about my sweet Rowena, but at least she’s not spending her night at school.’
He felt his mouth go dry.
‘Well, you’re not twelve, so I don’t expect that to happen,’ Draco drawled. When Harry didn’t lighten, he said, a bit more firmly, ‘Harry. My friends were Death Eaters.
With a smirk, Draco slicked his finger and pushed the tip of it inside. It slid in easily at first, halfway through, sucked in by the burning muscle. Harry moaned, Draco pressed further and couldn't resist stroking his own cock when the slick made an obscene sound at the rim. It was bloody
And, inevitably, revising every little touch, every little word Harry said. Trying to conjure as many moments of that night as possible, for it’d been the night Harry had kissed him in front of his friends, and smiled so warmly when Draco had told him they were dating - and hadn’t there been some talk of a flat in London? Murky, grey in his mind, some mention of it, a lingering clench in his heart… he really shouldn’t have drunk that much. He should
,’ Luna amended. ‘Mr. Chapman kindly let us stay while he fetched a drink.’
The following round, it was Draco who got a harmless flavour. Lemon - awfully similar to the flavour of Harry’s lips.
‘What?’
There was a rearranging of room as they slid through the leathers, shoving each other with wild elbows and complaining half-heartedly. Draco took a seat at the newly formed space at the corner of the couch. His left side was entirely pressed to Ron’s. He was awfully uncomfortable, and Potter
'Sod off, Potter.'
But Harry just looked at him, unwavering, casual.
in that moment - when Harry spoke up again, lips grazing his chest:
'Oh,' Hermione broke into a small chuckle, scratching the side of her head. Behind her, Neville was looking attentively at his drink, 'Good to see you too. You look wonderful, Pansy,' she trailed off, rolled her glass in her hands - butterbeer, because what else would Granger drink? -, then drew a polite smile. 'We'll be sitting over there, then. You two have a pleasant night.'
past Hogwarts, out in the real world - then Draco could get them some modest place.
‘Dragon Scale.’
‘I think it’s my turn, actually.’
Pansy knew. He’d told Pansy and it hadn’t been a problem. It had been a relief, telling her. But this - and this was happening, he couldn’t take it back, could never undo it, could never wish it away - was entirely different, was impossibly worse.
‘Our legs,’ Draco answered. ‘You?’
He didn’t answer, fiddling with a loose fiber from the covers. Harry sighed.
you kiss me?’
‘And when you say teaching,’ he started, his eyes twinkling as he stepped closer to grab at the sides of Draco’s shirt. ‘Do you mean you’ll be an arse the whole time?’
Harry huffed. 'You know what I mean.'
Harry said, his tone a mix of shocked and humoured.
‘Yes, it did,’ Draco conceded, his tone softer. He looped Harry’s waist completely, linking his fingers on his lower back, and spoke a shivering inch from his lips. ‘We should do it again. In school. Let everyone know.’
‘You hate these.’
It made Draco stand a little straighter. It made him curve down and put some speed into his pursuit. It made him wonder, with a surge of thrill in his system, if maybe Harry was watching him as well.
‘I won’t let you fall, Potter.’
the conversation into this very place, but it still dug some cold, hollow spot in his chest, dark inside his ribcage, and he held onto his glass tightly.
. ‘You said it under veritaserum.’
Harry snorted. He was holding onto the edges of the ceramic sink behind him, and his eyes were simmering with a disconcerting swirl of annoyance and amusement, and his glasses were pushed up into his hair, jumbled in the dark strands. He looked unfairly beautiful.
, can you believe it? Though we didn’t pay much attention to it at the time, a potion that makes you laugh, why’d Slughorn ever choose that?’ Dean took a moment to breathe, ‘Anyway, Harry’s complaining that all of them are like from centuries ago, right? And Hermione, she goes on this bid about how it’s all relevant, you just have to update the practices. Of course, we all thought it a bit of a bore, then - but then the test comes, and, well, you know what it was. Alihotsy, ancient as all hell. I reckon we all remembered enough of what Hermione had said to pass. How bloody great is that?’
‘With Finnigan?’
Draco rolled her eyes. Was it that difficult to see that she was
'Are we alright?
Yes, hissed that hardened voice inside him, in its bifurcated tongue: he’d done his best for the person he loved. Those bloody Gryffindors, with their ridiculously vague and inflexible sense of right and wrong, could be mad all they wanted; Harry himself could be furious, and Draco wouldn’t care - he rathered Harry never spoke to him again because he so chose than because he was dead.
‘Like kicking a dog, making fun of you two. You’re too in love.’
Harry glared. ‘Do you honestly think I’d have that much makeup? It’s Alicia’s.’
‘Always, Harry,’ Finnigan shouted. The boy was an inarticulate jumble of golden and red skin climbing over the others’ laps to leave his seat. Harry smirked, an evil thing for only Draco to see, and then he was standing, clashing against Finnigan’s side and disappearing into the sea of bodies.
drunk.’
‘Nothing?’
‘You dragged me away to tell me something, didn’t you?’ Harry frowned.
‘I think nights are difficult for him.’
‘Malfoy.
‘Hello,’ Draco murmured, an intimate greeting uttered with his lips pressed to Harry’s hair.
‘You really are dreadful at intimidation, Zabini. No wonder Bellatrix never taught you how to torture.’
The taunt, as well as the hungry dare dilating Harry’s pupils, was enough to restore Draco’s confidence. He pressed him back down against the mattress, giving in to his own arousal with an indulgent twitch of his hips, and drew a wanton smirk.
‘You haven’t done much teaching yet,’ Harry snorted, and then he was pushing him away with a hand on his chest and turning back to the neglected potion, arse grazing teasingly against Draco’s growing erection. ‘Quit touching me or we’ll never be done with this.’
The peculiar shout came from a winding street to their left. Finnigan and Luna stood by the door of Honeydukes; a short man was scurrying down the the cobblestone.
Malfoy winced. “Shut up.”
“Let’s not waste time on details,” said Draco airily. “Potter has been stalking me, and it’s getting tiresome.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so sure about that,” he said as he examined his wand again. Harry heard him mutter something along the lines of useless unicorns and Dark Magic.
,” said Harry again, since Ron and Hermione apparently missed that point the first time around. For some reason, that fact bothered him very much. He took an unenthusiastic bite of chicken pie.
“Harry, there you are!” said Dumbledore, gathering up his black cloak off his chair. “Are you ready to go?”
Snape grabbed her wand and unceremoniously threw it over the side of the castle. He then walked over to Harry and felt around until he pulled the Invisibility Cloak off of him. Harry’s eyes were wide, a scream locked behind his unmoving teeth.
He was going to Hogsmeade. He was going to Hogsmeade at the same time as Harry. He was going to talk to him.
‘We ought to have added more Gillyweed,’ Harry giggled - it sounded like it cost him, a pained, helpless noise, and he tucked his head into the crook of Draco’s neck.
‘Pass it, would you?’
Between Blaise’s scornful comments and Goyle’s persistent tugs at his wrist, they managed to get him into some fresh clothes and to the Great Hall for breakfast. At such an early hour there weren’t many students around, and he was able to eat in relative peace.
Harry smiled. Idly, with gold-stained fingers, he gestured at the snakes writhing in Draco’s forearms.
‘But what will we
‘Certainly different, though,’ Harry retorted.
‘There’s our Baby Draco!’ Earless clapped, grinning at him.
‘It must have been Fiendfyre!’ whimpered Hermione, her eyes locked on the broken pieces.
Babe?! Yup, that was it, done for the day.
He shivered, shoes twisting against the charred stones beneath him and he half threw himself through the door with a step.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man duelling Percy backed off. His hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair –
Fred and Percy had just backed into view, both of them duelling masked and hooded men. Shit, it was almost time. His lungs still weren’t working. His stomach hadn’t settled. His limbs shook as he tried to push himself to his feet and he didn’t have a wand to fight the way he’d been trained how.
The junk wabbled and began to fall, the top tumbling down to where Ron stood.
‘Fuck it! This isn’t fair!’ He bit into his bottom lip, refusing to turn away. ‘Why … why wait until now to want me?’
‘They were only there because of me really. We knew each other since we were kids and they’d always been good followers. That suited me fine, so I encouraged it. In little way, rewards, treats, reassurances, all the ways that you really shouldn’t train other people. I continued it when we got into Hogwarts, they really were my friends though, they were all I’d even known even if it wasn’t a healthy friendship. They gave me their loyalty and I protected them.
‘First, we save Lupin and Tonks.’
Blaise’s eyes narrowed, his face was blank, but those eyes held a chaos of emotions. Fear, doubt, confusion, concern, but something in his voice must have struck the chord that he wanted, and Blaise nodded slowly.
‘HARRY!’ she screamed.
His palm ached. He could still feel Malfoy’s hand in his. He knew that death wasn’t his fault, somehow it felt like the one he should have saved though.
Harry was far too reliant on his little ghost.
Worse still was that Harry didn’t have an answer. Not really. So instead, he filled in the silence with a question. One he’d wanted to ask before he knew Malfoy was back. One he never thought he’d actually voice.
‘I – I cannot answer that, my Lord.’
The rest of the battle went as he remembered, and he let it pass without any further action from him. He managed to stand in the courtyard when Harry was carried out of the forest. He knew he was okay, but it was still hard to watch.
If he was released that meant mother would be there, here. He’d have to answer questions. Starting with the same one everyone so far had asked: “Who was the baby’s father?”. He couldn’t tell her that. He’d changed enough – too much – already. No one could know the truth, no one could be trusted not to hurt him, or the baby, or his timeline if they found out. Maybe Severus, but he’d already given him another task. That catch up would have to wait.
Severus’ eyes widened slightly, staring at Draco as though he barely recognised the boy before him, he guessed that was fair.
There were a couple of unmemorable rounds. Dean and Ginny went out to get more shots after an entire turn of only nasty flavours; Pansy seemed to love the game, and asked by far the most embarrassing questions; Harry finished his firewhiskey, then sipped some of Draco’s, and as his cheeks flushed and his eyes brightened he slouched a little in his seat, settling his neck against Draco’s arm; Draco, on his part, ran absent trails with his fingers over Harry’s shoulder. His shirt, though a gorgeous grey, was too thin, and his skin was cold under the soft fabric. Draco had tried to insist that he keep his robes on when they’d reached the table, but Harry had rolled his eyes like a petulant child and shedded them over the back of the seat with a dismissive ‘fuck off’. He honestly didn’t know why he’d tried: Harry was very obviously incapable of dressing himself to match the temperatures. He’d titter and chatter his teeth if only he could move his limbs freely… or simply because he knew how much it bothered Draco to see him like that. Really, Draco ought to start sneaking into the Gryffindor dorms each morning and laying out a proper outfit for Harry by his bed. He could even kiss him good morning, while he was at it… maybe slip into bed with him, make sure he started the day properly warm.
‘It might be.’ Hermione sniffed defensively; it didn’t really sound like she believed it though.
‘Like it hot, scum?’ roared Crabbe as he ran.
It felt right. It was something he was excited about. It wasn’t perfect, of course, but nothing was when so much in his life was based off a translucent boy. But it was still getting better.
‘No difference,’ Voldemort repeated.
The man groaned, tiredly blinking open his dazzling green eyes.
Touch one wall, long breath in to the other. Then breathe out. Touch wall. Repeat. He’d learnt this at the start of last year.
He didn’t regret it. He didn’t. He couldn’t.
A wry grin pulled its way across his face. Of course, by this point of the war he’d been broken … completely … he wasn’t that boy now.
Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor's baton.
He gasped in a breath. Lungs burning. It didn’t seem like enough.
‘I wish-’ he murmured, cutting himself off before he finished the thought, he owed Draco more in this moment, but he wasn’t sure he could say it.
‘Potter?!’ He screamed.
‘We’ve talked enough, Harry.’ He laughed, closing the distance between them, arms – solid, warm arms – wrapped around Harry’s waist, pulling him against him and back into the heated kiss.
‘Thank you, Miss Parkinson. McGonagall clipped voice broke through the silent threat. ‘You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.’
‘No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter.’
He rolled his eyes, unable to keep the grin off his face. He was really glad they’d finally worked their shit out, but that didn’t somehow make him naive to what they were doing just because he didn’t have his own sickeningly happy couple.
‘What? Where? Breakfast isn’t for an hour…’
‘I don’t want to go there after Hogwarts.’ Harry tried to continue, letting Draco move past it or stop, whatever was least awkward.
There had been Doctor visits to confirm. Who the fuck could fake something like that?
‘Sure, she’s pretty.’ Draco agreed with a shrug.
But fuck- he’d missed an important moment there.
If he had to lose him then he would lose him.
Given he had been meddling with a time turner at work he
‘What? You don’t think you could want a room with me in it?’ He faked a hurt look, but it moved on far too quickly to be anything real ‘Or worried about what kind of room that would be?’ He raised an eyebrow, the rest of his expression in a look that Harry couldn’t keep eye contact with.
Sure, he’d only been here *insert unknown amount of time here*, and didn’t know how the war had ended. Or what he did. Or who he knew anymore. Or … well anything. But Potter didn’t get to keep him prisoner. Regardless of how nice the beds were!
Now that he thought about it away from the shock of his obviously delusional, scheming marriage, it might be better being here. Being older. Done with the war. He could make this work. He could feel a smile pulling across his face.
He stretched out a few times, brow furrowed as he flicked through pages of random books just as Harry was trying to read them. It didn’t take long for Harry to give up, study wasn’t that interesting anyway. Not that he had a chance on focusing when he was this tired. He still had the nightmares every night. Malfoy’s hand slipping through his haunted him. He stared at the see-through fingers, tossing and half slipping through the paper.
Arms wrapped around him, one large, warm hand grabbing his and pressing it against his chest, the other cupping his face, dragging his gaze up to meet green eyes.
‘Yes, well, thanks for that. I don’t really do much of anything anymore do it.’
Greg took the coin and nodded, the hesitation in Vince’s eyes wasn’t well hidden, but he stalked away with his friend so at least for now that was under control.
‘Shit …’ he whimpered into the toilet bowl.
‘Have you seen Remus?’ Tonks, so this is where she was. At least that made things a bit easier.
‘Harry, you really shouldn’t be so careless about your homework. The Auror’s might accept you both anyway, but to get through the training, to earn and keep your jobs once you’re there, you’ll need this kind of information.’
Dolohov drew back his arm, posed to deal his signature curse. Draco could imagine the purple flame striking across, could imagine Lupin fall. All he could think of was Teddy. That gorgeous little boy who he and Harry spent half the time raising. He deserved his parents, even if they were stupid enough to leave him alone as they fought. He deserved his Father.
‘Not everyone …’ he added softly.
‘Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?’
Something he’d done had already changed it this much, he had to be more careful. Harry had to defeat Voldemort, so everything had to be done as close to the first time as possible. The lives he saved had to be as separate from that as he could make them. Crabb started the Fiendfyre, so he had to stay. He couldn’t get him out to safety yet, maybe he could get his own broom before the room went up in flame, but that was secondary to Harry’s task. But Blaise would be an extra who wasn’t meant to be there. He’d also be observant enough to ask questions about why Draco knew where to be, why he was saving Order of the Phoenix members.
The second he was clear of the room Draco moved to lunge forward, but Harry beat him to it. The crate blocking them from the room drifted sideways, he couldn’t see him, but could hear as Harry  climbed into the room, approaching the wreck of a man bleeding out on the floor but he offered no help.
‘I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.’
