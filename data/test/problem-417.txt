The Slytherin wiped away a traitorous tear before it could form and regained his composure. "You said you needed to talk."
"Do you have a favourite?" Remus inquired, clearly trying to avoid talk of Slytherin or anyone from it.
It was dark when Harry awoke, a thin line of moonlight shining through the cracks in the boarded-up windows. Momentarily panicking, he saw the head in his lap, remembered where he was, and relaxed. He glanced at his watch, and almost jumped, jostling Draco's head. Gently shaking Draco awake and explaining the time, Harry stood up, kissed his boyfriend, then stepped back. Draco, still bleary-eyed, walked to the fireplace and threw a pinch of the Floo powder from the mantelpiece jar into the dying embers. Harry watched him, already missing the blonde boy. He tried one last idea as Draco turned to face him.
"Do you have a plan after you leave school?" asked Sirius, who looked almost approving following that motorcycle chat. This was thin ice, too, Harry thought. Who could say what would happen after school when the future was so uncertain? Draco had an answer, though.
"In all fairness, you were worried about your brother, alone with those hideous parents of yours."
He looked up at Sirius' face, seeing the Animagus clearly couldn't take it much longer. Then he heard those glorious words. "Touch me Remus, PLEASE." Unable to resist such an invitation but still wishing to tease, Remus delicately took the waistband of Sirius' (very stretched) underwear between his teeth and slowly pulled them down, ensuring to scrape against the shaft just a little on his way. He was rewarded with a hiss for his actions.
"The mission, or what you talk about?" Interjected Sirius.
Remus carried on. "He loves the boy. And I just don't know what to think. Is Harry safe, is Draco safe, is this house even safe?" Padfoot made a noise that was probably dog language for confusion. After all, Number 12 Grimmauld Place was almost certainly the most highly protected house in the country. Even after the Order had moved out 6 months ago, citing it being a too obvious location for Headquarters, the defensive spells and enchantments remained. Remus sighed. "I mean, who knows what Voldemort is planning. It could involve us; it could involve Hogwarts. Merlin forbid he finds out about Draco, or it will definitely involve him."
Sirius thought for a second, then pouted. "You two are ganging up on me. No fair." With that, he left the room, missing both the chuckles and the high five between Remus and their son.
She was first to speak, pointing at Harry's clenched fist. "What's that, Harry?"
At that Sirius caved. Remus saw the change in his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. For a second, he'd thought that his family was being irrevocably split. Harry's relationship would take some getting used to for both of them, but this was a start. "C'mon. Let's go find our Harry."
At that, Sirius looked like he was about to cry. "But he won't even talk to me." He said, so quietly Remus doubted he would have heard without his werewolf senses.
Feeling a sense of deja vu, Draco started walking through fights again. He tried to avoid the bodies scattered on the floor, but the first dead face he saw threatened to overwhelm him. His mother lay face-up, her wand arm outstretched, and her sister's body beside her. He picked his mother's corpse up, struggling under the weight, and placed her gently in a window seat. With her eyes closed, she could have been sleeping. He turned away with a heavy heart and weaved through duelling pairs.
He'd been shocked that Draco had even agreed to have dinner, given Sirius' initial outburst and his boyfriend's reluctance to cause any more fractures in Number 12, Grimmauld Place. But he had readily agreed and would be arriving any minute now. Remus was running around frantically inside, getting everything ready and wanting it all to be perfect, while Sirius was offering unhelpful suggestions on how he could calm Remus down, probably to distract himself from what was about to happen. Harry, meanwhile, was waiting on the dark front porch, wanting to have a moment with his boyfriend before the chaos descended. This was partially to prepare Draco, though he knew a lot about Harry's family anyway, and partially for Harry's own sake.
"Nothing, I just... I think we should go home. Clearly, we're not going to find him, and I'd rather be there for him when he gets back then chase our tails all over the globe." Better to give this as a reason than what Remus suspected was the truth. No need to give Sirius more reason to go charging into Malfoy Manor. He'd only succeed on getting himself killed.
Sirius nodded. "We'd only just started dating."
At a silent signal, the mass of black robes stopped. Harry scanned their forces. The majority were witches and wizards, joined by Inferi, werewolves, and two creatures at the back that Harry suspected were hags. He looked over to his right, and saw their own side's werewolf, gazing back at him with love, hand in hand with Sirius. Looking back at the enemy, Harry shuddered as he saw the Dementors flanking the group. His attention was diverted again as Voldemort spoke.
Harry replied with a
First Hogsmeade weekend is in a month - Dad do you want those Acid Pops from Honeydukes again? Let me know if you do and I'll send them with Hedwig and my next letter.
"Oh, yeah. It was about the plan. I don't think it'll work if I can't even mention you at home, let alone shelter you."
Draco looked back, addressing the crowd but keeping eye contact. "We'll do it together. He killed my mother too."
Sirius cocked an eyebrow, as if wanting him to get to the point. "But" Remus persisted, "don't you think Harry will have thought of all that already? He knows the danger he faces and how many are relying on him. It's incredibly hard to gain his trust. So, Draco must have done something to prove himself to Harry. There has to be a reason that Harry would risk this!"
Sirius looked offended as he downed more of the pointless caffeine drink. "Not every girl! I'd rather be force-fed Voldy's Polyjuice potion than flirt with Gretchen Hobbes!"
"Well, I can't say I wasn't a sucker for that eyeliner. Especially the gold one. Hot damn."
Third year it was announced Peter Pettigrew had escaped from Azkaban. Except oh wait, he'd actually escaped years earlier and no one had noticed, because the rat just slipped through the bars as soon as he got there. So, security had been tightened so much around Harry that he couldn't even talk to Ron and Hermione for three weeks. As if he had needed more separation from the rest of student body. Plus, Ron's rat Snuffles had died, that was kind of a bummer. Even worse, he had had to watch Snape's hatred of his dads spill over all year until Remus *somehow* got outed as a werewolf. Then there was the tiny matter of the Dementors and the kiss they had tried to give him while he and Hermione were looking for his father in the woods.
"JAMES!" Remus awoke to the sound of screams. He looked to his left and saw his husband sitting bolt upright, rocking back and forth, chest heaving. He sat up and gently laid a hand on Sirius' shoulder.
"Ron?" He asked. The ginger person laughed.
Sirius chuckled. "Oh, that I do remember. James' worst nightmare: Lily Evans in love with Snape." He paused, considering something, then continued with a laugh. "A nice couple's costume, considering we weren't together at the time..."
"Could we work on our communication skills, please?"
Even those whom he hadn't known as well threatened to cause tears. Pansy Parkinson, a friend of Draco's who had defected and been killed by Greyback for her bravery. Colin Creevey, a boy too young to die but stubborn to the last. Narcissa Malfoy.
Sirius looked like he was going to speak, but Remus grabbed his hand and squeezed. "Ok Harry," he said softly. "If that's what you need to do." Without another word, they left the room, quietly shutting the door behind them.
"I heard it was Malfoy."
"Not awful actually. Honestly, I didn't see much of his reaction what with my dad's screaming." Harry felt Draco wince.
They didn't stop for anyone. Within minutes, they had run out of the castle and into the grounds, adrenaline kicking in like nobody's business. They wheeled around in the direction of the Astronomy Tower, taking out their wands as they reached the area and slowed to a walk. There were still people there, but it seemed a different, larger group, much more diverse in age and size than the group before. And these people weren't happy. There were screams, sobs and echoes of "no.... NO!"
"Yeah but, I was in love with you for so long and for some reason I was convinced you were straight."
Without warning, Harry suddenly felt himself being shoved to the side. He almost fell, but managed to right himself, and watched in disbelief as Draco walked towards Voldemort, stopping just a few feet in front of the pack of people. The Dark Lord swept out to join him, placing his thin, white hands on Draco's shoulders and turning him to face Harry. The blonde's face was unreadable. Then Voldemort shouted for the whole country to hear. "And now, my newest Death Eater" - there were gasps again, and Harry was vaguely aware of Hermione and Ron's horrified expressions looking at him - "you will prove your loyalty to me and complete your mission!"
"She's still alive." He said, urgently. "Get her out of here!" They nodded, and the younger girl pulled Luna up into her arms with surprising strength. The two rushed off and Draco turned to face his aunt. She was purple in the face, and her wrathful eyes were fixated on him.
"Promise?" Draco whispered.
"And Draco?" Hermione asked softly.
"And that parentage defines him?" Harry stared at Sirius, unblinking.
"If you are of age, that is, 17 or older, you may stay." She answered. Nevertheless, when it came time for Harry's year to go, over half stayed, despite none being older than 16. Clearly realising it was an argument she would not win, and that they could use all the help they could get, McGonagall didn't push the issue, only forcing the departure of some of the younger years who had tried to stay.
"BLAISE?!" He whisper-shouted as he struggled to his feet. "What are you doing here?"
Harry grimaced, then came clean. "There was also some mention of our friend and his supporters."
He gasped some air into his lungs and opened his eyes to blinding light. The person dragging him let out a sigh of relief and let go. Draco pulled himself to a sitting position, blinking rapidly to adjust his vision, and realised that, not only was he still alive, but he was also still at Hogwarts. It appeared that someone had dragged him into an alcove, away from the heat of battle. Realising there was a figure standing over him, he looked up into the face of his rescuer and his eyes nearly popped out of his head.
But before Portrait-Dumbledore could finish, Hermione's voice rang out. "It's not here, Harry."
All of a sudden, he tripped on something on the floor, and looked down. It was Professor McGonagall. His blood turned to ice until he noticed the slight rise and fall of her chest. So, she was still breathing, just stunned. Draco knelt down and muttered the counter-curse. McGonagall sat bolt upright and looked around. She saw Draco and relaxed, allowing him to help her off the floor. She insisted that she was fine, but Draco still directed her towards Madam Pomfrey, who'd started a mini hospital in the Great Hall. Professor Flitwick was standing guard over her and the patients. Only she'd gone did Draco notice her opponent, also lying on the ground but very much dead. Severus Snape. He had no pity for his godfather, traitor to Dumbledore as he was, and didn't even move the body.
Sirius looked deep in thought for a few moments, then snorted and looked at Remus. "How about the 'completely hypothetical' question you asked Minerva about eating in Animagus form that time when I ate all the chocolate as a dog?"
14/9/96
Tearing up the stairs, he came to the dormitory. Shaking the others awake, Ron first, he told them what he'd seen. They all struggled out of bed to the window to see it themselves and woke up with a jolt. Now there was something else there, too. A small group of people were gathered at the bottom of the tower. They couldn’t hear anything from this distance, but the figures almost looked joyous, throwing their heads back in laughter. Only one type of person could be that happy under a Dark Mark. Death Eaters.
Too enraged to speak, she screamed incoherently at him, raising her wand. Draco's wand came up too, and they began a deadly duel. Light flashed and all other battles around them faded away until they could have been the only people in the universe. All Draco could focus on was staying alive, but he was sorely out matched. Bellatrix had been fighting for years, and he was still only 16. She was just too quick for him, and all Draco could do was watch as a red bolt soared from the end of her wand and hit him squarely in the chest. He flew back, hit something hard, and everything went black.
"Pretty much what I was expecting. Pureblood and all that crap. Not like he's pureblood or anything. Not like James was. Or Ron."
Sirius breathed out heavily, trying to calm his nerves. He knocked.
At the ridiculousness of that idea, Remus had to laugh. But, knowing his child like he did, Remus knew deep down there was more to it than just Harry being a raging queer.
"YOU'RE A FUCKING BLACK, DAD. HOW MUCH MORE ELITIST, SUPERMACIST OR PUREBLOOD CAN YOU GET? THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO FUCKING TELL YOU." With that, Harry glared at Sirius, cast a vaguely apologetic look at Remus, and left, slamming the front door behind him.
"Yeah, he has. His right hand's all burned and shrivelled, he has to use his left hand for his wand. Why?"
.... Alastor Moody....
"Not at all." Remus said in a reasonable tone of voice. Sirius rolled his eyes. "Think about it, Padfoot! Draco's here for two hours maximum, only sees the dining and living rooms, and doesn't learn anything whatsoever about the protective enchantments. Even if he is tricking us all and working for his father - which I REALLY doubt - he won't learn anything from actually being in the house that he couldn't get from Harry."
An onlooker could be forgiven for thinking someone was being disembowelled, so agonized was the scream that echoed around the Hogwarts courtyard. Duels momentarily stopped, as everyone turned to look at the source of the sound. Everyone, that is, except those involved in the still-raging three-versus-Voldemort battle. Aside from them, everyone watched as Bellatrix turned, face to face with her sister.
He knocked again, louder this time.
Confused, Draco tried to get up. They helped him to his feet, and he looked the person up and down. His waker was tall and had a mischievous smile. "One of the Weasley twins." He said, relieved.
Dumbledore had explained that, not realising this, Voldemort had taken Harry's blood at his resurrection to break down his defences. This had worked to some extent, as Lily's connection and love for Harry was as his mother, and they shared the same blood, but it hadn't worked fully. So, while Voldemort could now touch Harry and curse him, he still could not kill him. Not while Sirius and Remus, those who Lily's love ran through, still lived. Obviously, they were not planning on correcting Voldemort, so the likelihood was he wouldn't find out until the end. When one of them lived, and one of them died, just like the prophecy said.
4/11/96
"YOU UNGRATEFUL BOY!" She screamed. "How DARE you turn against your master? How DARE you defy the Dark Lord?"
"I'm home!" called Remus, slinging the strap of his briefcase around the bannister as he walked through his front door. Hearing no reply, he frowned. "Padfoot?" Silence. Now Remus was worried. It was extremely unlike his exuberant husband to stay quiet at all, let alone not react to the sound of his dear Moony's voice.
Harry was aware of everyone looking at him. He looked back, wondering how many of them were willing to sell him out for their families' sakes. Then, just as the silence grew deafening, Ginny stepped in front of him. "Well?" She asked, her low voice sounding like a shout in the utter quiet. "Anyone getting any funny ideas?" No one spoke. Then Luna came out to join her, also standing in front of Harry. Hermione joined them, then Ron. Suddenly people were flooding in and before he knew it, every student in the room was surrounding him, facing out, like an honour guard against an invisible threat. He had never felt so much a part of the Hogwarts family.
"No." Harry said, speaking his first words since seeing Dumbledore's body. "If the snake is in danger, he'll keep her close. He'll want to able to see her at all times, keep a constant watch." He looked up at the chair where Dumbledore had sat for so many school feasts, now empty. "We have to finish this, and that means taking down him and the snake."
"I heard Snape was with them!"
Remus raised his eyebrows. "I was quite aware of your approval. You certainly bit it enough times."
"Say something nice. Help me stop worrying about Harry."
The two boys had clung to each other, Harry trying to stay strong for Draco's sake. Once the Slytherin had calmed and returned home, however, the tears had been too much for Harry to hold back. Stumbling around, he'd attempted to Apparate to the Burrow, where Hemione was staying over the summer holidays, but apparently missed by a few miles. Apparition was a risky business anyway, especially since Harry was only allowed to do so at 15 due to his special status. He'd wandered round the woods for a while and happened to chance upon his friends. Opening his mouth to explain, he'd simply burst into tears and been unable to speak. They'd brought him back to the Burrow, sending word ahead to Molly, who'd contacted Sirius.
Sirius looked at his lap. "Yeah, I was. And with good reason. They turned his head as soon as I was out of the picture."
Harry stumbled as he Apparated into his room. After sneaking out a few times he'd gotten better at Apparating and Disapparating without his dads' knowledge. However, he still wasn't the best at staying quiet and there was nothing to be done about the loud cracking sound. He froze, hoping the noise hadn't woken them, but all seemed still. He kicked off his shoes and sat on his bed, thinking.
Unable to keep up the act, Sirius moaned, low and sweet. He bit his lip, clearly trying to suppress any indicators of how turned on that show of dominance had made him. Remus leaned down and crushed their lips together, tugging Sirius' shorts off as he did so. Sirius lifted his hips to assist in the endeavour, accidentally brushing their crotches together and causing both to groan with pleasure.
Just as the last students had been evacuated, there was a hideous noise and Voldemort's voice rang out from no source that Harry could see.
"Death Eaters. I saw them from my window."
"Can we get you anything to drink, Draco? Pumpkin juice, Gillywater, Butterbeer?" He asked, clearly trying to put himself at ease as well as their guest.
"I really do." He meant it. Harry held grudges and would likely be wary of mentioning Malfoy around Sirius again, but he wasn't cruel. He would know they'd worry and wouldn't want to make them scared for him. Besides, where else would he go? Being the Boy Who Lived meant it was very difficult to walk down the street without being recognised. He was in danger anywhere that wasn't a house of the Order. And the best protected house was home. Rationally, Harry would know that, though he was generally ruled by his emotions.
Breaking the kiss, Remus yanked Sirius' t-shirt over his head and immediately started a trail of kisses down his husband's chest. He'd barely gotten to the six pack, however, when Sirius pulled him back up for a kiss.
"Hey Moony." The man looked at their son before rising to a knee and standing to be on an equal level with Remus. At his husband's questioning face, he just shook his head. "I've no idea why he's like this. He'd been out all day then, just when I was getting worried, Molly floo messaged to say he was wandering the countryside crying and would I come and get him. What countryside, I didn't know, hence the note I left you."
War hero Remus Lupin has passed away in his sleep aged 68, following a short illness and a lifelong battle with lycanthropy. A beloved father, husband, grandfather, and friend, he will be dearly missed. Many of the public recognised him for adopting Harry Potter, or his role in the original and rebuilt Orders of the Phoenix during both Wizarding Wars. For those who knew him, however, he was just Moony - a kind, patient, down-to-earth bloke who always had wise advice and a bar of chocolate to hand. He is survived by his husband Sirius Lupin, son Harry Malfoy-Potter, son-in-law Draco Malfoy-Potter and three grandchildren James Sirius, Scorpius Remus, and Lily Narcissa.
After a lot of cajoling, he managed to persuade Sirius to go upstairs and talk to Harry. Silently praying to whoever was up there that this didn't end badly, he sat back on the sofa and tried not to listen. For whatever reason, he felt that this conversation should be private, between Sirius and Harry only.
Dumbledore had told them that, on the night he interviewed Sybill Trelawney for a position at Hogwarts, she had issued a prophecy. This had been overheard by someone - a Death Eater, Harry assumed - who had carried at least the first part of it back to Voldemort. The Dark Lord had apparently decided to kill Harry because of this prophecy and used Pettigrew to find out the Potters' location. He had killed James, then Lily when she defended Harry.
One floo journey later, Remus and Sirius eased their child onto his bed, where he sat motionless, staring at a blank wall. They waited for him to speak but within minutes it became apparent that wasn't going to happen. Sirius started getting antsy.
"...even though James really thought we were." Remus finished, also laughing. He looked at the sky. "Merlin, I was such a confused little mess back then. In love with you, but in denial about it. Hiding my furry little problem, while trying not to be ashamed of it. Trying to stop you and Prongs hurting Severus all the time, even though I hated him too."
"Well, if the worst comes to the worst, I can always Apparate you out of there."
"So?"
Hello again, it's your favourite son :)
"Huh?"
It had taken Harry a long time to forgive himself for their deaths, helped along the way by Ron, Hermione and all his friends, and of course Draco.
"Malfoy."
No answer.
They came slowly, some walking out of the Forest, others from across the drawbridge. Soon they drew close enough for Harry to see the faces of those at the front. Voldemort, of course, was leading. Harry spotted Nagini wrapped around his neck like a weirdly scaly scarf. To his left just behind him was Bellatrix Lestrange, who grinned widely when she saw Harry, and to his right was... Snape. Harry looked into the man's eyes with deepest revulsion, and saw what he had always known was there, below the surface. Pure evil. The man's thin lips were curled in a smirk, and when he looked to his master his expression could only be described as worshipful. In the row behind them, clearly considered lesser Death Eaters, were the Malfoys. Harry heard a sharp intake of breath from Narcissa and felt Draco grip his arm, hard, as mother and son locked eyes.
"Pepper Imps!"
Padfoot whined. The idea of Draco betraying Harry was clearly his biggest worry. Remus didn't blame him; this whole business was risky. Draco could get caught, Harry could get hurt, Draco might be plotting with Voldemort. There were too many moving parts to this puzzle, too many unanswered questions. Remus suddenly had an idea. "Why don't we invite Draco for dinner?"
With that, he drifted off to sleep, still wondering in the back of his mind when his son would come home.
Carefully, Remus took two steps forward and raised his wand. "Homenum Revelio" he breathed. The spell swooped through the house, revealing.... nothing. There was no one there. Perhaps Sirius was in his dog form? Impossible, the lovable mutt would be barking the house down if he knew his husband was home from work. Even more on edge, Remus crept slowly through the hall and into the dining room. There was a note on the table, with a few lines scrawled in Sirius' messy handwriting.
"Pleased to make your acquaintance. I'd try and kill you, but since you snogged Harry before sending him off with a portkey, I thought I'd wake you up instead. I'm Gred. Or Forge, I don't mind which." He held out a hand. Draco shook it, still slightly confused. Probably a head wound, not that he could deal with it now. Gred/Forge made sure he was steady and skipped off, back into the heat of battle.
Remus looked to be contemplating something. "Well, Fanged Geraniums and Bubotuber pus are both common ingredients in healing potions. I wouldn't be surprised if Severus was making him some to help with his hand. Hopefully, he recovers soon."
"It’s ok, Harry," coaxed Remus gently. "Take your time."
Draco, on the other hand, looked only at his opponent. The younger Slytherin allowed himself a smirk of satisfaction at the confused, incredulous, and then enraged expressions cycling in succession across Voldemort's face. Then Draco's fear and worry returned, and his mouth straightened out into a hard line.
"Walk in where, Ron?" Hermione said, sounding exasperated. "We don't even know where Voldemort is, let alone his snake. And if this true," she gestured to the letter, "He's probably sent the snake far away, so no one can get to it."
Remus tutted. "Don't you start that self-loathing crap with me now, Mr Lupin. Had enough of that in Fifth Year."
Ron was the first to speak. "So, the snake's the answer. No biggie, just walk in, kill the snake, and then kill You-Know-Who. Problem solved."
A large group of scared-looking first years left, the fire glowing green. The second years followed, and the third. Not all of them, though, Harry noticed, as McGonagall had to come down and force smaller children, who were intent on staying, to go through the fire. A hand shot up.
"Death Eaters? At Hogwarts?"
Love to everyone, Harry
"Well wasn't that a relief" Harry sighed aloud.
Harry paced nervously in front of the fireplace in the Gryffindor Common Room. It was ten to four, his dads weren't even expected yet let alone late, but he couldn't shake this sinister feeling that something was wrong. He started counting painting to distract himself, but quickly grew bored. Finally, after nearly wearing a hole in the carpet, he heard a pop from the fire and turned to see two heads sticking out from the embers.
Sirius lifted his head off his arms and let out a noise that sounded like half exasperated sigh and half amused laughter with a touch of relief in there too. "Moony." He said calmly. "Our son. The child of two flamboyantly gay fathers. Is having an aneurysm. Over our acceptance. Of him being a flaming bisexual."
Harry let out a snort that his father couldn't quite tell if it was in derision or amusement. "Well that's handy."
"Of course, Harry," replied Remus. "Come sit." He motioned for him to sit on the sofa beside where he himself had just sat down, leaving the other sofa free for Sirius to stretch out. This Sirius did, lying on his stomach with his chin resting on his crossed arms. Harry sat, too, though far less casually. They waited for him to say something.
Quick Author's Note: (I know, I'm sorry) This chapter takes place pretty much simultaneously to Chapter 6, just from Remus' perspective rather than Harry's.
I've had more lessons with Dumbledore and that seems to be progressing well, though again, they're not what I expected. I can't really talk about it in a letter, but could you meet me in the common room next Monday at 4am? Then we talk much more easily.
"Keep at it." his father advised, "he'll appreciate it whether he shows it or not." Harry nodded again.
"Then talk to him." He suggested. "He doesn't have to reply, you just have to make him listen."
Sirius and Remus both looked worried. Finally, Sirius spoke. "We'll hope for the best, anyway. That's all we can do, short of forcing him to St Mungos. What else has he had you do, Cub?"
Sirius just nodded, still swaying. Remus couldn't see his face, but if he had to guess, he'd say Sirius' jaw was tight, with gritted teeth and tears on the verge of flowing from his bloodshot, stormy grey eyes. That was how he normally looked after one of his nightmares. Without a word, Sirius turned and buried his face in his husband's chest. Remus just held him, as he had done for many nights before, stroking his hair and whispering assurances that he was here, and it wasn't real. Except it had been real.
"You'll never find him." Draco yelled. "So, you can either deal with me, or FUCK OFF!"
, then hopped to his feet, looked around to check for Muggles, and twisted in the air.
Harry thought that was a bit dramatic, and unrealistic given Voldemort and all, but he was still touched. That was his Draco, selfless and kind with a flair for the drama. Interestingly, he shared that trait with Sirius. Being a drama queen must run in the Black family.
"Dead? Yes, I believe so. Unintended but ultimately unavoidable. Do not pity the dead, remember Harry. Pity the liv-"
"Only if you're alive." Draco murmured softly. Harry gathered him into his arms again.
"Yeah I know. Mostly a ruse to throw my parents off the extremely gay scent I was wafting." Sirius thought for a minute. "Looking back, it's surprising all the teachers didn't notice pretty immediately."
"That's right. And James dared you to kiss the most attractive person in the room. You looked and me and you said my name. And I said "yes?". And you genuinely asked me-"
Lol Dad, stop stealing Pop's quill. Acid Pops are enclosed, don't eat them as Padfoot again, we know exactly how that worked out last time.
"Yes, Sirius, and shut up."
Afterwards, Harry couldn't remember why he had ever been worried. Having engrossed Remus in a discussion on magical beast rights over the main course (Steak and potatoes), he then made both Harry's dads laugh hysterically with a joke about Herbology. By the time dessert was finished (Vanilla Panna Cotta), it was clear Draco had charmed the entire household. Harry sent him off with a kiss at the door, following an open invitation from Remus to pop by whenever he liked.
As Memory Lane released Remus, he became aware that Sirius was no longer shaking, and his breathing was steadied. As his husband lay back down, snuggling into him, Remus wrapped his arms around him and swore for the millionth time never to let Sirius be hurt again. As they both drifted back off to sleep, Remus' thoughts were of a happier time, with baby Harry on a broomstick and their friends laughing and alive.
"And so what if I was?"
How are you doing? Bet it's quiet at home without me. Made it to Hogwarts safely and thankfully with no house-elf interference. Lessons are going well; we haven't had Snape yet though so I'm not looking forward to that.
Remus frowned, seeming to notice the hesitation, but Harry ploughed on before he could say anything. "Basically, every Saturday evening I've been going to Dumbledore's office, we talk about something, and then he sends me on some weird mission. It’s different every time."
Sirius choked on his Firewhiskey and had to be banged on the back by Remus so he could catch his breath. Once he'd gotten his voice back, Sirius blurted. "Forgive me if I'm mistaken, but I can hardly see Lucius Malfoy allowing his only son to work at St Mungos!"
Hogwarts is a bit.... weird lately. I haven't seen my friends outside of Gryffindor in nearly two weeks, and there seems to be a lot of inter-house tension. I don't know what's happening, but it doesn't feel right.
And fell, eventually slamming his back into a hard floor. Struggling against his paralysis, he tried to roll, but quickly gave up. He knew where he was - the ceiling above him was that of the living room in Number 12 Grimmauld Place. What Draco had done was loving, stupid, foolish, and so very very brave. He just hoped that his boyfriend didn't pay the ultimate price to keep him safe.
Remus turned to Sirius. "That's it. That's the last place I can think of." He sighed in frustration as he looked around the field. "We've checked every place Harry could be."
"Oh." Harry mumbled. "How do we kill the snake, then?"
Fourth year was just a whole colostomy bag worth of shit. Entered into a dangerous competition that not even Ron believed him about, he'd faced a dragon, drowning and oh by the way he saw LORD FUCKING VOLDERMORT come back to life. Also something nobody believed him about. Pettigrew had murdered Cedric, something Harry still blamed himself for. And to top it all off, his awesome DADA teacher had actually been a Death Eater the whole time. Who then tried to kill him.
Have you given up with the basement yet, Dad?
"Well..." said Harry, with the air of one ripping a plaster off an open wound. "He's kind of already family."
"Sirius, it was Professor Flitwick."
Lying spread-eagled at the foot of the Astronomy Tower, limbs sprawled at unnatural angles, and glasses hanging off one ear, was Albus Dumbledore.
"Look, Harry." He started, trying to keep his voice down. "I know that you're hurting, and I know that this is hard for you. But can't you see it's hurting your dad too?" Harry appeared to have taken a great interest in his feet and wouldn't meet Remus' eyes. He did, however, scoff a bit at his words. Taken aback, the werewolf rephrased. "Fine. I know that what your dad said yesterday hurt you and made you go look for Draco." Harry started at the name.
"A brave attempt to hide the younger ones, but a pointless one. I do not wish to spill magical blood. It is precious, far too precious. I only want Harry Potter. Give me Harry Potter and I will leave in peace. Gove me Harry Potter and your families shall not suffer. You have one hour to deliver Potter to the front gates, or I shall ATTACK."
Without another word, they twisted on the spot and reappeared back in their living room. Remus went to put the kettle on as Sirius collapsed into an armchair. Over the sound of boiling water, he heard snippets of different songs and realised Sirius must be flicking through the radio channels. He finally settled on some kind of shouty music just as the kettle finished. Remus poured a decaf tea for himself and a coffee for Sirius. Into the coffee went four sugars and an unreasonable amount of milk, basically turning the beverage into a warm, coffee-flavoured milkshake. His own tea he left black.
Something needed thought. The plan had originally been to shelter Draco at home if need be, but from his dad's reaction it didn't look like that would be happening. He had to talk to Draco again.
Missing? MISSING? Their son was MISSING, and the mongrel hadn't even thought to send Remus a Patronus message about it? Not wasting another second, he marched to the large fireplace that dominated the living room and took a pinch of the green powder that resided in a jar on the mantelpiece. He threw this into the fire, stepped forward and cleared his throat. "The Burrow!" He requested, and immediately spun on the spot, disappearing from 12 Grimmauld Place, and reappearing a moment later, this time in the cosy dining room of the Weasleys.
"I'm sorry."
"You know which one's which, obviously." His mind was back in his fathers. Draco nodded. "Sirius likes to think he's tough but is really just a soft marshmallow on the inside. Remus is quieter, but more discerning, so that might be a bit disconcerting during dinner. He can kind of guess stuff just by observing you. It's weird. But neither can do Leglimency, I promise." The nerves were back in Draco's eyes, but he gave a weak smile at Harry's attempted joke.
After almost a week of silent treatment from Harry, Remus could see that Sirius was struggling. The final straw came when they woke up one day with Harry gone and no note. Remus knew he was probably just with Draco, but owled around anyway in case anyone had seen him, cross with Harry for taking it this far. There was pain and anger over insults, and then there was this, which was just selfish and worrying. He wasn't too angry though, mostly just concerned for Harry's safety.
Sirius snorted, not quite a laugh but at least with raised spirits. "I was quite a miserable wretch, wasn't I?"
"We just couldn't agree on anything today." said Harry, frustrated. "It started off reasonable, 'cause I was worried about his dad again, and then it turned into the most ridiculous stuff! Who argues about their favourite flavour of Sherbet Lemon? It's SHERBET LEMON! The flavour is literally in the name!" He flopped onto the sofa. "That has to be the stupidest argument anyone has ever had."
And this defence, this love, Dumbledore had told them, was the most crucial part. Lily's love for her son had created a magical protection that Voldemort, unloved as he was, could never have understood. So, when the Darkest wizard of all time had turned his wand on baby Harry, the spell had backfired. Lily's protection meant that it was Voldemort, not Harry, who felt the effects of the Killing Curse. So, he was shattered, reduced to almost nothing. What little that was left had only survived due to some kind of Dark magic and had fled in exile to an Albanian forest.
'Gone to Burrow. Harry missing. Back soon.'
He stared at the door and leaned in. Pressing his forehead against the wood, he let out another shaky breath. "Harry? Please. Let me in. We need to talk."
In the distance, they could hear crackles and booms, presumably defensive spells being put up against the coming attack. There were no voices, that they could hear at least, and no screams. Harry took that as mild encouragement. He saw Ron check his watch and blanch slightly. "Two minutes," Harry heard him say under his breath. The four of them walked out together into the courtyard, where a crowd was forming. Clearly after laying down defences, the towers had been abandoned, as most of the Hogwarts force seemed to be here. As they moved to the front of the crowd, he saw other faces, too. Order members like Moody and Kingsley nodded to him, while old students, like the elder Weasleys and Oliver Wood, waved. His dads had clearly been successful at getting the word out. Harry took a deep breath and looked out to the distance, where he could just begin to hear many voices and many more footsteps.
"Ok." acquiesced Sirius. "Ok. Noted for next time."
History books would later record the heroic triumph of good over evil as Harry Potter, the courageous hero of all wizard-kind, symbolically slew He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Those in the room, however, knew that the Boy Who Lived never did it. His innate sense of goodness repelled the idea of taking a helpless man's life, even a man so evil as this one. Those looking on that day, though they never spoke a word of what had occurred, witnessed as Draco Malfoy took out his wand, pressed the tip to the Dark Lord's forehead and spoke a single incantation.
"Cockroach Cluster!"
"You'll be fine. They love you."
"Gryffindor's sword." Hermione said immediately. "It's in Dumbledore's office. That should do the trick." Harry nodded. That was doing something. Doing something was vastly preferable to nothing, which left him wallowing in grief.
Just as Harry did every year, he got out of bed, dressed, and went for a walk. He walked for almost half an hour, until he reached Hyde Park. Treading the familiar yet mostly unknown path, it wasn't long before he stood in front of a door in the middle of a hedge. He opened the door and stepped through, into a beautiful garden.
On the second anniversary, there had been so many reporters camped outside Grimmauld Place that Harry could barely leave the house for a week. To his utter disgust, most of the Daily Prophet's article had focused on the revelation of his relationship during the battle. Not those who had fought, or the lives that were lost. Not the great sacrifices that were made.
The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
Remus could see a oh-so-familiar expression on his husband's stubborn face. The 'I-know-you're-making-a-good-point-but-I-refuse-to-admit-that' expression. He tried one last time. "Even if Draco doesn't deserve your faith, surely our son does?"
As he moved through the throng of people, occasionally dodging and ducking hexes and firing back, he saw individual fights that stuck out to him more than others. Percy Weasley and one of his twin brothers were flooring Thicknesse; the other twin and another Gryffindor he didn’t recognise were taking down Yaxley; Ron was singlehandedly battling Scabior. Draco wished he could help, but he could have accidentally hit Ron if he sent a spell their way, and he had business elsewhere.
"Your note. It didn't exactly inspire confidence."
Lots of love,
But she didn't get another word out. A jet of green light erupted from Narcissa's wand, colliding with Bellatrix. Voldemort spared a single glance towards his favourite servant, only to see her crumple to the ground, dead. His roar of rage blasted away his three opponents. Narcissa barely even had time to look around for her son's body before she was thrown to the floor by a Killing Curse, cast by the Dark Lord himself.
His plan with Draco was dangerous, but Plan B had been too. And Plan C. Don't get him started on Plan A. All had flaws, all involved a fair amount of risk. There was clearly no getting around that. What he wished there was a way of getting around, was his dad.
Sirius snorted again, drained the last of his unspeakable liquid, then looked more serious. "Interesting that they figured it out before we did."
"Ah yes, wandering the countryside. Near his best friend's house. So, you write me a note making me think he's been KIDNAPPED OR SOMETHING."
Harry made a face into Draco's hair. "S'not your fault."
"Slughorn?!" said Sirius incredulously. "Gave me the creeps, that one. Tried to 'collect' people. He got Regulus and was always complaining that I wasn't in Slytherin so he could never "finish the set". I felt like a Muggle tea set or something. I imagine he's trying to collect you too, Harry? You'd be the shiniest one in his whole collection, damn magpie." Their son nodded. "What was the memory?"
Sirius shook his head. "Now that is impossible. James shipped us right from the start!"
Padfoot didn't reply, probably because dogs can't form human speech.
Remus chuckled again, darker this time. "Oh, Mr Lupin I do a lot more than put up with you." He moved suddenly, so that he was straddling Sirius' lap. Sirius grinned, clearly very approving of the direction this conversation was taking.
Wooden floorboards met his feet as he reappeared, and he wasted no time in striding to the fireplace. Fresh logs were already stacked up, it just took an Incendio charm to light them ablaze and give the drafty room some much-needed heat. Harry looked out between the boards on a window. Despite the summer setting, frost still settled on the highest branches of the trees surrounding him. In the distance, chimneys and puffs of smoke were visible from the charming town of Hogsmeade, but no living soul ventured past than the barbed wire that blocked off Harry's residence.
"I enjoy the subjects," Draco answered easily, "but some of my housemates can make for poor company. Most of them, really." Harry tensed. This was a sticky subject. Draco looked serene, however, so Harry tried to make himself relax.
"I can't," he said, softly. "I have to finish this."
Remus hauled him off the sofa and into a waltz position, with Sirius' hand on his back and the other holding his, and Sirius' head resting on Remus' shoulder. There they stood, swaying to and fro, listening to each other's breathing and heartbeats.
Remus nodded to the two of them sagely, then turned to his husband. "We'd best get him home."
Just then, he heard a scream. Turning in the direction it had come from, he saw Molly Weasley standing over a ginger-haired body. The playful boy who'd woken Draco up now lay unmoving. He stood there in shock, saw her husband try to comfort her, and Ron kneeling on the ground beside his brother. A Death Eater barrelled towards them, but Draco sprinted over and intercepted the attack, throwing him back with all the power he could muster. When that one had been dealt with, he turned back to see Molly Weasley advancing on another, who suddenly looked very scared. Rookwood might have worked in the Department of Mysteries, but Draco couldn't imagine anything in there even came close to a grieving mother on the warpath. Rookwood turned to flee but hadn't even gotten two steps before Mrs Weasley's bolt of green light had hit him squarely in the back.
With a jolt, he came across his other parent - an interesting sight of Sirius vs Lucius. Remus was nowhere to be seen, and Draco prayed he was still alive. He didn't think Harry would survive the loss. Walking up to the duelling in-laws, he pushed his father's arm. Lucius didn't seem to notice, busy firing bolt after bolt of light at Harry's dad. So instead, Draco sent a well-aimed Jelly-Legs Curse at his father. Lucius, taken completely by surprise, fell to his knees. Sirius looked shocked, then saw Draco and grinned. He sauntered up to Lucius, now restrained by his own son, and punched him in the face. Lucius was knocked out cold and slumped to the floor. Draco kicked his body.
So that was how they found themselves ten minutes later, looking at the stone gargoyle that guarded the Headmaster's office, and shouting every kind of confection that they could think of, at it.
"Of course I did! I have incredibly high facial recognition ability!"
"And... I don't think you'd approve, that's all."
Think of the devil, there it was. Heat flashed through Harry's pocket and he struggled to pull the coin out quickly enough. Draco's message was short.
Harry chewed his lip, thinking. "That could be problematic then if Plans B and C are both defunct. We both know how bad Plan A was."
"Why, your natural beauty, of course." Draco was grinning properly now, his gleaming teeth on show with mirth in his eyes. Harry blushed.
With a shout, he was gone.
Sirius winced. "I'm sorry, I didn't know what to say!"
Sirius scrambled. "Well... I still insist that I was protecting our house integrity and upholding the appropriately set rules!" He beamed, as if proud of himself for remembering so many of what he called "Moony-words".
"Right." Harry focused and shook himself out of the silly grin he was wearing at seeing his dads again. Hogwarts was amazing and truly a second home, but he did miss them quite a bit. "It was about two things really. Dumbledore's lessons, and....."
Well, we won the first match! 110 - 260, it was really close until the Snitch. Puts us in second in the house cup though, so that's good. Ron and Hermione are happy and healthy and send their love. Pops, are you doing okay?
Harry smiled, remembering how clueless he had been. At the time he had just thought Draco had a weird new obsession with a part of him, like his scar in first year or Quidditch abilities in second. Draco had turned up later that day for Potions Class and the student who trashed the portraits was never caught. Harry had gone back to watching Draco every night. He slipped into Memory Lane again, recalling the times he nearly got caught and the night he actually did.
And fell.
Harry always found the anniversaries hard, even after so many years. Maybe it was the memories that still seemed so fresh. Maybe it was the media frenzy that meant he couldn't avoid the faces of the fallen. Not that they ever left him anyway. They would be with Harry to his dying day, but at least it no longer killed him to think of them. Now they seemed more like old friends, missed but not forgotten, a reminder of more dangerous times that could never be repeated.
"No." Harry shook his head. "I... I can't." He looked around at the faces of shock and disappointment. "I'm sorry. I know he killed my mother and so many others and he's evil, but I've seen too much death. I won't do it."
"It's over."
"'Member when you had a lip ring, Moony?" Sirius asked as Remus brought in the drinks.
"So, you literally didn't have the authority to kick someone out even if you'd had an actual reason?"
Just then, there was a flash of light and the whole room seemed to shake. Harry jumped up, gripped his wand, and looked around.
"Hello love." Harry said, smiling. They kissed briefly, before Harry pulled away and buried his face in his boyfriend's chest. "You don't have to do this, you know." He mumbled hopefully, his words muffled by the fabric of Draco's jumper. He felt, rather than heard, Draco's huff of laughter.
"We don't have much time." He explained McGonagall's battle plans to Draco. "Plus, we need to kill the snake. Apparently, she's crucial."
"Ice Mice!"
"I'm here." A small voice, uncharacteristically nervous came from behind them. For the second time that night, Harry turned to see someone walking up the Great Hall. Draco looked exhausted, and paler than usual. His eyes were haunted. They reminded Harry painfully of the broken boy he'd watched in Fourth Year. He met Draco in the middle and lifted his hand to cradle his cheek. Draco leaned into his touch. Then he straightened up abruptly, looking into Harry's eyes. "I'm so sorry love. It was Snape."
"Harry?" Remus could hear the worry in Sirius' murmur. Harry didn't react.
And then that stupid argument. He knew he'd been out of order, bringing up Sirius' family, but it was so hypocritical. He just hoped his dad would get over it, and hopefully the Malfoy thing too. Fingers crossed his father was talking some sense into him right now.
And beg he did. Or at least, Sirius' version of begging. Which was to look Remus dead in the eyes and, with a strained voice, growl "Fuck. Me. Now."
Sirius looked confused again.
"Welcome, friends!" He proclaimed, raising his hands as if preaching. There were snorts of derision and shouts from the Hogwarts defenders, which the Dark Lord appeared to ignore. He continued. "We are not here to kill. We only want one of your number." His slit eyes narrowed, if that was possible, at Harry. Then, suddenly, his gaze shifted slightly. "Draco!" He called.
Remus glared at the annoying Animagus. "Harry, you can tell us anything, and as long as they treat you right, we will treat them as one of the family."
Harry blushed. His entire face was red before he spoke, making his hesitant response simultaneously very Gryffindor and very un-Gryffindor. Finally, he answered. "I'm seeing someone."
So many things could go wrong tonight. Sirius could burst out with another one of those Death Eater comments; Draco could use one of those words he'd been trying to stop using but sometimes slipped up on; Remus could accidentally mention a sore spot. It was all so risky. Plus, Harry didn't quite know how to process how quickly this had all gone. First Draco was a rival, then an enemy, then a secret and now openly his boyfriend? He didn't blame his dads for not seeing it coming, it sounded like some terribly written love story ripped off an original piece.
There was gasps and shrieks as students noticed the blonde was one of their number. Harry himself moved in front of Draco, shielding his boyfriend from whatever his nemesis intended. Voldemort smiled cruelly. "Oh Draco!" He called again in an almost sing-song tone, a truly bizarre contradiction with his fiendish appearance. Then his tone went deathly cruel again. "I think our little Slytherin has been hiding something."
He laughed, handing his husband The Mug of Undrinkableness. "That would be around the same time that you were wearing copious amounts of eyeliner, yes?"
Harry was livid, that much could be seen. "Draco is NOT the same as his father! He is a GOOD PERSON! But if we're judging by families, go ahead. Be a fucking hypocrite."
Others had died, too, who weren't commemorated here. Crabbe, Bellatrix, Snape, Rookwood and Scabior could rot for all he cared. And their comrades could too - surviving Death Eaters like Draco's father, condemned to a now Dementor-free Azkaban. This garden was his safe space to grieve those who deserved it.
Harry's eyes flashed. "He will never. Be. A Death. Eater." In an instant he was standing, facing off with his dad while his father just sat there on the sofa, looking at the two of them with horror.
With the main barrier out of the way, Remus could finally gaze upon his husband's full beauty. He wasted no time at all burying his nose in the thick bush of hair at the base of the shaft before drawing back and licking a long stripe up the underside. Sirius let out a strangled gasp at the long-awaited contact and Remus hummed happily. Wrapping a hand around the thick shaft, he gave it a few pumps while gently sucking at the sack behind.
"I said it's not that. I knew you guys would accept that."
He sighed and climbed the stairs to the third floor. What had once been Sirius' bedroom was now theirs. Walburga and Orion's was undoubtedly bigger, but Sirius had point-blankly refused to sleep in a room where his "bitch of a mother fucked her cousin", so that had been turned into a walk-in closet during the extensive renovations. He found Sirius in this closet, curled up in a ball amongst the winter coats. Correction, he found Padfoot. It was sometimes simpler for Sirius to just turn into his Animagus form when it came to feelings, rather than face them. Dogs, he claimed, were much less complicated than humans, and so it was easy to filter things out.
However, Remus couldn't help but admit their son had a point. Harry was almost 16 and had just been driven out of 12 Grimmauld Place (though not permanently, Remus desperately hoped) because of his dad's intolerance. There were striking parallels that he knew Sirius would see with a clearer head. But there wasn't time to wait for that head to clear. This time Harry really was missing.
18/10/96
Sirius huffed with laughter. "I'll remind you of that statement next time you-."
"Pumpkin juice, please." As his father bustled off to the kitchen for the drinks, Harry shot a quick glance at his dad, who was sitting across the table from them.
Perhaps on a different day, if wouldn't have hurt as much. Perhaps if Harry hadn't gotten a particular piece of news today, he would have seen his dad's point. Perhaps, if he hadn't held his sobbing love in his arms today while he tried to understand, Harry would still be at home. But it was today. And Harry had gotten news. And he had met up with his boyfriend, only to hear those words that he had never wanted to hear.
It was circular, with flowerbeds all around the outside - home to magical and Muggle flowers of every variety. Delicate silver vines twisted up the sides of the hedge walls. And right at the centre was the garden's main feature. A tall plinth of white marble stood there, inscribed with gold lettering. As Harry drew closer, it was easier to make out each name. There were many. Too many. All in all, over fifty people had given their lives fighting Voldemort thirteen years ago.
Remus rolled his eyes so far back they went looking for Jupiter. "Oh no. I'm so glad you told me. I could never have guessed that I am a Homosexual™. It's almost like I am married to a man and literally just fucked his brains out."
"You have to be the one to end it, Harry. You have to kill him."
"The reason... that I was crying today...." Without meaning to, Remus leant forward, desperate to hear what was wrong so that he could make it better.
Voldemort's silent scream never made it past his lips. Witches and wizards all around turned away from their own fights and sent bolts of light his way. Without his wand, and overwhelmed, Voldemort was virtually defenceless, and keeled over onto the stone.
Heart thudding, Harry approached, and realised they were all gathered around something. People looked up their grief and moved to let him pass. Suddenly all eyes were on him, and he started dreading what he would see when he reached the centre. Finally, the last person moved out of his way and his eyes met the grisly sight. He fell to his knees.
Harry looked at his fake Galleon again, complete with coded message, before sticking it back in his pocket. Draco normally wrote back quicker than this. Harry could only hope his delay was caused by lack of proximity to his coin, rather than something more nefarious. Merlin forbid Lucius should ever find out where his son scurried off to quite so often.
Sirius looked like he couldn't believe his ears. "My prejudice? MINE? He's dating a FUCKING MALFOY."
Write to me soon!
Sirius laughed at his own joke and Remus looked at him, trying to discern the identity of this mystery significant other. A male, presumably around Harry's age, who almost certainly went to Hogwarts with him (since where else would he meet people), who was related to them in some way, and of whom Harry didn't think they'd approve. Oh. Oh.
Finally, Harry looked up, though he seemed to be focusing on Remus' shoulder, rather than looking him in the eye. "Look, Pops, Draco is a good person. I love him. And I can't just forgive what Dad said, much less forget. He might be hurting, but I'm the one whose love is forced to be on a side he hates." His voice got louder and stronger as he got more confident in what he was saying. "I'm the one who has to be the Saviour of wizard-kind and fight a war I never wanted a part of. I'm the one who's either going to die or have to kill. And right now, I don't know which is worse." With that, Harry pushed past his father and walked up the stairs. Remus heard his bedroom door slam behind him.
"Oh, you were impossible." Remus sighed, still chuckling.
He stepped even closer, now right in front to it. Harry ran his hand down the list of names. He paused occasionally, whenever he came across a name more personal than the rest.
"The sword does not wait, Harry. It has gone back to where it was before you retrieved it, until another Gryffindor is worthy to summon it."
Now Remus was completely lost. "What's handy about us treating him like family?"
Sirius frowned. "Moony," he announced, "our son appears to think we are convicted criminals. Are you ashamed to be talking to your fathers in a Hogwarts fire, Harry?" He winked again, so Harry would know he wasn't really mad.
He looked back. In his moment of distraction, Bellatrix had managed to connect a curse with the Ravenclaw, who now lay motionless on the ground. The Weaselette roared, a fiercer and louder noise than any Draco had ever heard. She looked like a woman on a warpath, and even his aunt looked hesitant for a second. The Weasley girl fired a storm of light from her wand, hitting the elder witch square in the face. Bellatrix fell, clutching her nose and screaming in pain. From beneath her hands came gigantic bats, and Draco recalled Harry once telling him about Weasley's proficiency with the Bat-Bogey Hex. She and Granger were now knelt over the Ravenclaw, the ginger girl sobbing. "Luna no, no, PLEASE, no!" Draco ran over and checked the girl's pulse. There was a faint beat.
Sirius looked confused. "Then... what's the problem?"
"But you managed it?" Asked Remus, a note of pride in his voice. As far as he was concerned, Hogwarts and indeed all faculty should be respected, until they came in the way of his son's progress. He was a very academically supportive parent, always ready to help with homework, while Sirius was more likely to throw you a Chocolate Frog and tell you to quit worrying about it.
Then it was over.
Sirius hesitated. "You really think he'll come home?"
Draco smiled weakly. "Right back at you." It was heartening to know, as he watched Blaise sprint away, that not all of his classmates would blindly follow their pureblood parents' wishes. All the same, there were far too many fighting for the Dark. He took a few steps to ensure he'd regained his balance, and walked back into the fray, wand in hand.
Remus prevented the rest of Sirius' jest with an enveloping kiss before gently nibbling his mate's earlobe. This elicited a series of whimpers from Sirius as he continued his wet assault downwards, occasionally nipping at areas of torso he knew to be particularly sensitive. Flicking his tongue out when he reached the navel, he blew a cool breath across the pale skin.
Gently, Hermione and Ron tugged him off the headmaster. He slowly stood up, pausing for a second as he felt something hard, and removed a flattened scroll of parchment from Dumbledore's robes. He dimly became aware of the dispersing crowd, Professor McGonagall ordering the students and teachers alike to the Great Hall. Of course, she was now acting Headmistress. She came over to them, looking like this murder had aged her fifty years. "Mr Potter. Miss Granger. Mr Weasley. To the Great Hall, please. I have some announcements to make."
Remus sat on the floor and let the big shaggy Animagus rest his head on his knee. His hand began stroking the black fur absent-mindedly as he spoke. "What are we going to do, Padfoot?"
"Potions." Draco smiled, and looked at Harry. "Not your favourite by a long shot, is it babe?" Harry shook his head mutely, wondering how it hadn't all gone wrong yet. Draco carried on. "I quite like Transfiguration, too, but Potions will be more useful after Hogwarts, I dare say."
Remus looked thoughtful again. "You mentioned two things. What was the other?"
"How did you get here so fast?"
And during all of that, he was also figuring out that he was gay. So now he was going into sixth year, where did that leave him? All these tragedies and he had what to show for it? Nothing. Nothing... except.... he had everything. Aside from the colostomy bag, fourth year had also been amazing. It was the year Harry had found someone who truly made him feel normal and at peace. He grinned despite himself as he remembered.
And fell.
Dumbledore's apparently going to give me special lessons this year, I can only guess that they'll be something to do with Voldemort. Not really looking forward to that, but whatever. Hopefully, it won't be too bad. Is there any news about the Order?
"I don't know, it was like there was an earthquake directly inside the castle!" Harry crossed to the window, where light was still poking through, and pulled open the heavy velvet curtain. His heart dropped. His breath froze. Green light streamed into the room as he could barely hear his dads' questions. Floating above the Astronomy Tower was the Dark Mark. He sprinted back to the fireplace as his scar started throbbing. "There's a Dark Mark." He blurted, and his dads' expressions changed to horror. "Something's happened. You've got to get the word out. Signal the Order, get anyone you can. I think Voldemort's coming!" His dads nodded, bravery and fear in their eyes. "I love you." He said, quickly, and ran out of the common room. A quiet hiss told him the fire had been extinguished.
Once Sirius squeezed his hand, indicating he was adjusted and ready, Remus steadied himself on the bed and slowly pulled almost all the way out, before moving back in, quicker this time. Soon he was moving at a brutal pace and Sirius' near screams were testament to his enjoyment. Sirius had said fuck him, and that's exactly what Remus intended to do.
McGonagall clapped her hands, now strictly business. "Well, after that show of loyalty, I see no need for any doubt in the spirit of this army. But we will need organisation. Reinforcements are on the way, and for now, we will split up into groups, each defending important parts of the castle. One group will go with Professor Sprout to the collect supplies, then to the battlements. The three towers need to be covered, as well: one group to Ravenclaw Tower. Another to Gryffindor Tower. And a third to Astronomy Tower. Professor Flitwick will join those in Ravenclaw Tower before the hour is up once he has finished his defensive charms. The other two groups will be headed by-"
Remus stepped forward. "Harry, what's going on?"
"And?"
Remus snorted without looking at his husband. "Sirius, you once tried to kick someone out of the Gryffindor common room for being too short."
Harry interjected for the first time. "Dad, weren't you not even a prefect?"
"You dare," he half whispered, "to try to keep Harry Potter from me?" In a flash, his wand was up. "CRUCIO!" He screamed. Draco was thrown to the ground, writhing in agony. Beyond the pain, he was vaguely aware that this seemed to have triggered the start of the battle, with curses and people being flung all around him. The torture lessened slightly, and he could hear the hissing voice yell "WHERE. IS. HARRY. POTTER?", punctuating each word by throwing Draco up into the air and bringing him crashing down to the ground.
"....always thought he was odd..."
After a while, Harry could never have told anyone how long, he felt a hand on his shoulder. A light touch and a hint of perfume told him it was Hermione. "Come on Harry," she whispered. "Come away, now. There's nothing you can do for him." Harry was completely numb, partly from cold, partly from grief, mostly from horror. Draco couldn't have done this, surely? He had nothing to do with this. It was all a big mistake. But if that was true, where was he? Draco was nowhere around him; he'd be able to pick up that silken voice over the whole school's hushed chatter.
Still no answer.
"No. It's not over." Draco's mouth was a thin line. "It's not over till he's dead."
Sirius nodded slowly. Then he leant his head on Remus' shoulder and just closed his eyes, blocking out the world for a few moments. Remus squeezed Sirius' hand and stood up, pulling the Animagus with him. There was no point sitting around when jobs around the house needed doing. The family inside might be cracking, but the wallpaper would not.
Draco barely had time to process his words before a horrible pain erupted in his head. He wondered dimly, falling to his knees, if this was how Harry felt when his scar hurt. Somehow, he doubted it. This was less of a burn, which was how his boyfriend usually described it, and more of a searching, digging pain, like someone was cutting the memories out of his mind with a rusty spoon. But then, as quickly as it had started, it stopped. Draco, shaking himself, glanced up and realised Voldemort had been distracted again, this time by... his in-laws.
At this rapid speed, it was clear neither man was going to last, and it wasn't long before Remus felt the tell-tale tightening signs. By Sirius' groaning, he was close too. Remus pumped him a few more times and then came unravelled, exploding in a moment of pure bliss. He felt Sirius go as well, the smaller man painting his own chest and stomach, and Remus collapsed, panting, onto the bed.
"Harry, whoever it is, we will love them," soothed Remus placatingly.
Ron and Hermione say hello, they're both good. My other friend is ok, too. Everything's a bit complicated now we're back at school, but we're finding some time for each other. Snape's teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts, can you believe it? I can't believe I forgot to tell you last time. The lessons aren't actually too bad, although he seems just as unenthusiastic teaching this as he was with Potions. No one knows why Dumbledore finally gave in, but he doesn't seem to be telling me any time soon. Our private lessons have started, and they are.... interesting. I can't say much more in a letter, but they are certainly not what I expected.
Except just as Voldemort pointed his wand at him, the older wizard froze. Wasting no time, Draco roared "Expelliarmus!", freeing him of his wand. Draco was so focused on catching the flying stick - which he did - that it took him a minute to see what had happened. Voldemort was still facing him, a look of shock on the old man's face. The tail of Nagini still curled around his neck, but it was strangely limp. And behind him was Neville Longbottom, covered in blood, with a sword in his hand and, at his feet, a raggedy old hat, and the head of a snake.
...Oliver Wood....
Draco would take the Mark in a fortnight, it had been decreed. In a cruel Voldemort-style joke, the initiation ceremony was scheduled for the day of Harry's 16th birthday. Neither of them knew what Draco would have to do for the ceremony, but they'd agreed that he'd have to go through with it to keep himself safe. Once the war was over, Merlin willing, Harry would vouch for Draco and the whole thing wouldn't matter anyway.
He let go of Draco, who moved slowly in Harry's direction. Almost unconsciously, Harry began to mirror him, closing the gap. He felt arms trying to stop him, to pull him back, but he shook them all off. He met Draco exactly between the two armies, searching his face for any sign, any hint, that his boyfriend was still in there. Hoping against hope that it hadn't been a lie. He could feel his heart beating wildly, teetering on a precipice. Draco slipped his hand into his back pocket and forced something into Harry's palm. The secrecy of the action gave Harry hope.
He pulled away from Sirius, who switched his gaze from the wall he'd been staring at to meet Remus' eyes. "Look. I understand where you're coming from. I do! The Malfoys are part of Voldemort's inner circle. Even being friends with Draco could seriously endanger Harry."
P.S. Dad, not a word about how I'm also technically your least favourite son.
"I don't really know. After... after he fell, they ran down to look at the body. I think some students must have seen because they scampered quite quickly. They all ran into the Forest, but Snape pushed me towards the castle, telling me to go to my parents. Instead, I came back here." Harry hugged him tighter, then let go.
"You chose well son." smiled Remus. "That boy's something special."
Harry nodded again. "I got the original one. It didn't make much sense to me, but Dumbledore was happy."
Harry suddenly had a thought. "He wouldn't have changed it back, would he?" He stepped forward towards the gargoyle. "Sherbet Lemon."
But while Remus stayed relatively calm, Sirius was a different story. He started panicking and crying, thinking he'd driven Harry out of the house entirely. Nothing Remus said could calm him. After hours of this and still no Harry, Remus finally snapped enough to lock himself in the bathroom and send Harry a Patronus charm.
"Yeah. That." Sirius agreed distractedly, sipping the concoction, and sighing in contentment. "God you looked so fucking sexy with that thing in your mouth."
.... Fred Weasley....
We start Quidditch practice next week, trials are tomorrow. I'm quite nervous for the trials - Wood was the best Keeper we've had in years, and the best Captain. How am I supposed to replace him?
McGonagall was still talking. "Professors Sinistra, Trelawney and Vector, along with Mr Filch and Madam Hooch, will escort you to the safe house and remain to defend you if necessary. Please form a huddle in your year groups and we will send you off one by one."
He couldn't believe his dad's reaction. Actually, yes, he could. Sirius had always had a mental barrier against any mention of his extended family. Harry had just hoped that he would be more understanding. Love happened in strange places; Sirius should understand that! He thought Remus had received the news fairly well, though he honestly couldn't remember through all the rage. But Sirius had been mad. And that accusation. Those words that had hit like a knife to the ribs. Death Eater.
"My parents made me come," muttered his fellow Slytherin. "But I won't fight for Him. I'm getting out of here, come on!" He turned to go, but Draco caught his arm.
So, by fifth year he'd already escaped Voldemort 5 times, but no one would tell him why. Home had become the Order's headquarters, so it wasn't really home anymore, especially with Snape swishing around every corner. Umbridge. Need he say more? And his Dad had come so close to death. The Stupefy Bellatrix shot had left Sirius toppling towards the Veil, only to be yanked away and revived by Remus as Harry chased after the would-be murderer. Then afterwards, Dumbledore had finally told him and his dads the truth about everything. Why it had to be Harry. Why Voldemort had wanted his blood. Everything.
"Remus I am mortally offended!" exclaimed Sirius, pressing a hand to his chest as if to cover a fatal wound. "I did no such thing, nothing of the sort, zip, nada, nil. I was a model student!"
Outside of his grief, he was just barely aware of other's reactions. It was clear from the frequent screams that more and more people were joining the crowd and seeing the grisly sight for the first time. Two reactions stood out to him particularly, even as he kept his face buried in Dumbledore's robes: a quiet, broken choking that he somehow knew was Professor McGonagall, and an ear-splitting bellow he attributed to Hagrid. Soon, it seemed like the whole school was there, seeing their headmaster dead on the ground. He heard snatches of whispers, a thousand different voices asking what was going on or sharing information.
Draco stared him dead in the eye. "You're not getting Harry. Not now, not ever." There were murmurs as people realised what he had done. In his peripherals, he could see Remus and Sirius advancing either side of him at the head of the huge crowd. He had no time for them; he was entirely focused on the seething creature in front of him. Frankly, he was amazed he was still alive - Voldy must have just been too shocked to remember his magic. But the Dark Lord looked to be gathering his wits.
"I was being appreciative!"
After all the recent drama, it felt nice to be back to normal again. Admittedly, their version of normal was probably more fun than other families. Sirius' idea of fun pranks involved hair dye and buckets of water, while Remus was happy with regular old jinxes. Harry liked both magical and Muggle pranks, so you were equally as likely to try to pick up your wand and have it start tap dancing, as you were to find a whoopie cushion on your seat.
"Of course! That whole family is rotten to the core! Elitist, pureblood supremacists who'd rather none of us existed!"
Sirius nodded, and Harry was so happy he thought he might burst. Finally, everything was looking up for the first time in a long time.
The atmosphere changed instantly. Harry braced for the explosion, but Draco's voice was surprisingly calm when he spoke, though his words were forceful. "I don't much care what my father allows or doesn't allow. His way is not mine and has not been for a long time." He looked Sirius in the eye, then Remus, and addressed the elephant in the room. "I know you both had reservations about this relationship but I'm thankful that you trusted Harry and myself to make the right decisions. I swear, as long as I live, no harm will come to your son."
Yawning, Harry glanced at his clock. Crap. He only had a couple of hours before his dads would be up and he'd have to face them for the first time since the argument. Sliding off his clothes, he pulled the duvet over himself and tried to sleep, hoping for dreams not involving Snake-Face. As was often the case, he was disappointed.
"Can... can I talk to you guys about something?"
Remus snorted again. "He was there to pick up homework from you that was a month late, but he stopped to chat with some first years. So, you being the lovable idiot you were, you ordered him out of the common room on account of, and I quote, "being too fucking small". You're lucky you only got detention!"
If Sirius had been trying to jargon Draco into confusion, it hadn't worked. The blonde asked a couple of complicated sounding questions, and before long the two had launched into an animated discussion on backbone vs cradle frames. By now utterly lost, Harry was grateful when the arrival of Remus with drinks halted the conversation. As he sipped his pumpkin juice, he heard Remus ask Draco about school.
"DRACO! C'mon you great hairy goblin, get up."
Although, he thought as he reached the final landing, if it weren't for stairs, he and Sirius would never have had that encounter in the under-stair cupboard on the fourth floor of Hogwarts Castle in sixth year. A quite delicious encounter involving tongues, Sirius' back and a Vanished pair of- hey was that a sob? He cocked his head to the left. Though near as good as the wolf, his human senses were still far more acute than that of your average witch or wizard. Yeah, that was a sob. And a sigh that sounded suspiciously like his Animagus spouse. Making his way down the hallway, he pushed open the final door, which was ajar, and found Sirius kneeling by Ron's bed, which currently contained the aforementioned Weasley and Hermione Granger sitting up, and, sitting between them, a blubbering mess of black jeans and even blacker hair that Remus judged to be his son.
"Malfoy!"
"Yeah," smirked Sirius, "love them like our own child, making it practically incest." He sighed. "My parents would be so proud."
"There was someone else too."
"Let GO of me, Remus!" Sirius snarled.
He tugged on Sirius' hand, forcing his husband to come to a stop.
It sprang aside to let them enter. He shared a guilty look with Draco and shrugged at Ron and Hermione. "It was the password the first time I came here, in second year." They all walked up the stairs and into the office. While the others started looking for the sword, Harry was completely distracted by the decor's newest addition. Above the chair, in the biggest portrait, sat Albus Dumbledore. He smiled down at Harry and the boy stepped closer.
"I'm sure my actions were still justifiable!"
A tear ran down Harry's right cheek. "Something happened." He finally whispered.
And at that pet name, the door finally cracked open, revealing green eyes red from crying, and Harry Potter fell into his dad's arms for the first time in far too long.
Remus turned a page in his book on gemstone transfiguration and yawned. Usually books were a welcome distraction from the real world, but tonight this one was failing to even sustain a fragment of his interest. He put it down (with a bookmark in, of course) and stretched his arms out, squeezing his eyes shut. Instead of the air he expected however, he felt a lapful of wet-dog-smelling man fill his arms. Reflexively, he closed his arms around Sirius and tipped himself back until they were lying on their pillows.
Why did his life have to be so royally fucked up? First, his birth parents were killed, and he became the most famous person in the wizarding world all because of a stupid prophecy. Then he dealt with bullying all through primary school. Finally, when he got to go to Hogwarts, he was singled out by everyone as either a target or an icon. A new disaster every year.
Sirius made to go after him, but Remus, now somehow freed from the frozen position he'd maintained on the sofa, held him back.
"He came and got all the sixth- and seventh-year Slytherins from our dorms. He sent most of them home to their parents, but he made me come with him to... to the Astronomy Tower. Dumbledore was there, surrounded by Death Eaters. Snape must have let them in the school. They were laughing. Snape stepped into their circle and..." Draco trailed off but Harry could guess what he'd left unsaid. He pulled his boyfriend into him, holding the blonde's head to his chest.
Remus huffed. "Good." Then an object in the corner of the room caught his eye and he thought of the perfect way to distract themselves from worrying over Harry. He flicked his wand in the gramophone's direction and sweet slow music began playing. It wasn't Remus' favourite, but it beat Sirius' hardcore rock and scream any day. He stood, crossed the room, and swept into a bow in front of Sirius, who looked equal parts confused and amused. "Mr Lupin, may I have this dance?"
"How was it with Remus?"
Finally, Harry just gave up. "I'm bi."
"It's not that" mumbled Harry.
"H-how?"
Even if Draco had wanted to answer, in his jerking movement he probably would have bitten off his tongue. He stayed silent, trying desperately not to scream at the pain. 'This is where I die' he dimly thought, as his body began to block out the torment and shut down. He knew that he was okay with that. He'd already decided weeks ago that the world didn't need Draco Malfoy. He was just another teenage boy who got in over his head. Only Harry would really miss him, and while he felt guilty for hurting his love, eventually Harry would move on. He'd fall in love again, live his life, and he would be safe. As long as Harry was safe, he was at peace. At least his death had achieved something. How many people could say that, with their dying breath, they had helped stop the evilest wizard of all time?
Harry sighed. "It doesn't matter right now. I just need to go to sleep."
Draco hated to leave them behind, but he had bigger fish to fry. Finally making to the centre, he saw Voldemort standing alone, aside from the snake, which still coiled around his shoulders. He seemed to be waiting for someone, eyes closed. They snapped open, however, as Draco approached. The Dark Lord looked on the edge of snarling, but he spoke quietly. Somehow, over the din of battle, Draco heard him.
And fell.
Harry was taken aback. "Snape? You're sure?" While the Potions Master had always been dodgy, he was a member of the Order. Harry found it hard to believe that Snape could have tricked - much less killed - Dumbledore. Draco nodded.
Sirius looked ready for murder. He spoke through gritted teeth, in a tone that promised danger. "Pick your next words carefully, Harry."
A pint of ice cream and two hours later, there was silence in the house and Remus judged that Harry had finally cried himself to exhaustion. He turned to his husband, finally able to speak about what had been bothering him. "Sirius?" His husband looked up from the other sofa, where he'd been trying to distract himself with a tiny toy Quidditch pitch with even tinier players that Harry had bought him last Christmas.
"Putting - or should I say getting - it up for you." He rolled his hips into Sirius' and shoved him down so that his back hit the bed.
"Poppy and Minerva were shipping the two of us before James was!"
"Indeed. Brainstorm time?" The two boys sat together on the floor in front of the fireplace and rethought their escape plan. Floo powder was mentioned, as was dittany, Polyjuice potion and the Burrow. Even dragons showed up in the conversation at some point, though Draco thought it too unrealistic. They talked for hours, obsessing over the tiniest details - anything to keep each other safe in a war where nobody was.
"How do you know he isn't sleeping?" inquired Sirius curiously.
And either must die at the hands of the other, for neither can live while the other survives...
The Invasion of Hogwarts had begun.
Harry shook his head; his mouth had gone dry. "I... I don't even know where Draco is right now. For all I know, he's-"
"It was back when he taught Voldemort as a kid. Voldemort asked him about something - a form of Dark Magic, and he didn't want his answer seen. So the version he gave Dumbledore was doctored, and I had to get the real one. It wasn't easy."
What? No. No, not Draco. Please. It couldn't be.
Draco had looked so scared. Scared of the pain, scared of his father, scared of the commitment to a cause he didn't believe in. But mostly he'd looked scared to lose Harry. They'd both known, since that day in the hospital wing, that eventually they'd end up on different sides. Harry forced to be the hero of the public's light; Draco dragged to the dark by familial obligation. They just didn't think it would be so soon.
"Nagini? That won't be easy, she's under constant watch even in normal situations, not to mention a deadly creature in her own right."
"Hey. Don't think like that, okay? We're going to make it through this. Together."
"Remus!" cried Molly, jumping up from her seat. "We weren't expecting you!"
Remus laughed. "Alright not every girl," he allowed, "but you can see why I was confused!"
"Moony, were we this inarticulate at 16?"
"You didn't even know who it was."
"What is it, Cub? What's happening?" Sirius looked worried.
Harry smiled again. "I had to pick a time when no one else would be in the common room."
Harry started, as much as he could fully paralysed, at the sound of the front door being slammed open. Then he heard sprinting footsteps, and Draco's beautiful face came into view. Shaking, he pulled out his wand and muttered the counter-curse, pulling Harry into the tightest embrace of all time as soon as he was on his feet. Suddenly, Draco stepped back, like he was unsure of his actions. As he looked like he was about to launch into an explanation, Harry saved them both some trouble and time and collided his lips against Draco's. Eventually he pulled away, as multiple people starting filing into the room. Ministry officials, it looked like. Harry looked at all of them, looked at Draco, and asked half-question, half-statement he was dreading the answer to.
Draco stiffened and pulled away from Harry. He stood there, arms now wrapped around himself, clearly reliving that morning. Harry couldn't imagine how it must feel, knowing you had to swear allegiance to someone so evil and against everything you stand for, else all you loved would perish. He put a hand in Draco's shoulder. When it wasn't rejected, he turned the boy to face him and lifted his chin. "Hey. I love you. And I don't give two shits what anyone else thinks."
Slowly, assisted by his friends, Harry made it to the Hall. It was packed, every soul in the castle in this one room. Literally every soul - even the ghosts were floating nervously above their heads. Professor McGonagall left a gaggle of teachers quietly talking and stepped onto the High Table. "If I could have your attention, please." She called, her voice hoarse. Most of the noise died down, thought there were still many weeping.
"Nightmare?"
There was a slight rustle from the other side of the door, almost as if someone leaning on it had shifted slightly. He took that as mild encouragement.
"Think about it, Padfoot. When you carried my bags after the full moon because I was too weak; when you took notes so I could keep up in Transfiguration; when I lit up whenever you came to visit me in the hospital wing. Poppy was betting on us eventually getting together as early as second year."
Harry didn't think he'd ever been this nervous. Exams? Chill. Breaking rules? Whatever. Facing Voldemort? A walk in the park compared to how he currently felt. It seemed ironic that in a life so littered with danger, his biggest fear was introducing his boyfriend to his parents.
"Vanquish the Dark Lord" was pretty obvious. Same with the next line - Lily had faced Voldemort three times and lived. Moon and mark him, again obvious. He was born under a full moon and of course he had his scar. Then it stopped making sense. What kind of power could he possibly have that the Darkest Wizard of All Time didn't know about? Also, what was this bullshit with surviving? Clearly the bit before meant that Harry would have to kill Voldemort, or vice versa, but they were both alive right now, so that last line seemed kind of pointless.
Absent-mindedly, he rubbed the scar on his forehead, another reminder of loneliness. Over the years, it had been a symbol of hope, of peace, and of the rebellion. But now it was almost calming. It hadn't hurt him in thirteen years. All was well.
Suddenly, the pain stopped, just as quickly as it had begun. Was this death? It was noisy. And not very peaceful. He felt himself being dragged along a floor by his wrists and heard a voice.
"Good. You're not dead." His waker said, sounding playful but relieved. Draco blinked a few times.
"Where is Harry Potter?"
Remus' thoughts suddenly ground to a halt. Oh. If he'd gone anywhere near a certain someone, there was no chance of them finding him. It was a risk to even try to look, in case they brought attention to Harry or to a boy who could potentially be in a more vulnerable position than even the Boy Who Lived. At least Harry was protected most of the time. If what he said about Malfoy not being a Death Eater was true, the boy could be in serious danger from his own family. Better to keep a low profile.
Harry's last image was that of Draco's mournful face. He fell.
Remus nodded, putting down his mug and allowing Sirius to snuggle under his arm. "Interesting indeed."
By the fifth anniversary, the hurt had lessened a little, and the tone of press coverage more celebratory than mournful. Now, thirteen years later, people had healed and grown. The children going to Hogwarts had never lived during wartime. Voldemort and everything he stood for was being well and truly left in the past, and there was hope and new life blooming. Harry saw that in the lives all around him. Hermione and Ron were married with two girls and steadily on their ways to Minister for Magic and Head Auror, respectively. Captain of the Holyhead Harpies Ginny was in an open relationship with Luna, editor of the Quibbler and part-time botanist. She and Draco often worked closely on potions for his small-time business. Even Neville got his happily ever after - he and Hannah Abbot had just taken over teaching Herbology from Pomona Sprout, who was enjoying her well-earned retirement.
"Moony?" mentioned Sirius affectionately as they both tried to catch their breath.
Remus shrugged, finishing his tea. "I noticed it when we were at school and it only got confirmed once I was part of the faculty."
"I can do this." He stated, sounding like he was almost trying to convince himself more than Harry. "I can do this."
Harry and Ron exchanged glances and sprinted together down the stairs and out of the portrait hole. They passed bleary-eyed first years, shaken awake by the movement of the castle, and confused fifth-years who yelled "Harry! What's going on?".
