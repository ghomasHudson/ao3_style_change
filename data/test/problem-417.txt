"Bloody hell Parkinson! What'd you do!?" Ron squeaked, racing over to Hermione, Harry directly behind him.
"Sh-shut up Z-zucini." Ron almost smiled, truth be told, he love Blaise, everything about him, from his face, to his voice, to his body,
Harry was used to this but then Draco walked into their bungalow, completely unfazed by what was happening behind him. Draco grabbed Harry and slammed him into the bed, Harry unbuttoned Draco's shirt and they got down to business. Half way through doing the nasty, Draco presented an idea, he pulled out his phone and showed Harry a website called "OnlyFans" feel stopped for a moment while Harry looked at it, he set up an account and set up the camera. The two boys finished what they started and uploaded the video.
Harry got so lost in Draco that he started ignoring others, Draco didn't really like the others to begin with but the same thing happened to him. Harry and Draco continued to film only fans and one night, during an especially loud and rough fuck, the twins walked in. The twins were fine with it and went to make popcorn for the show, Ron, thinking it was for drarry, poisoned the popcorn, Fred and George died while watching Harry and Draco, everyone blamed it on Draco, harry and Draco were the only ones who didn't think it was him. At the twin's funeral Draco was so depressed and suicidal, he thought everyone in the world hated him, he hung himself that night. Harry was devastated, no one else was very upset. Harry was so upset that he Aveda cedavra'd himself on the spot.
Pansy hesitantly crept over to the spot and snuggled in, they cuddle for the night, amongst.... other things....
"3 missed calls from Ginny, 27 texts and 8 missed calls from Ron, 92 texts and 27 missed calls from Hermione?" Harry read aloud.
"There's something I wanted to do first." Draco said, nervously looking into Harry's beautiful green eyes.
"And you kissed me back. You wanted to get in the closet with me. I stopped everytime you pulled away." Harry argued back. Draco shoved him but he didn't budge. He wasn't the scrawny boy that Draco had been teasing for years anymore. He stood up and moved so he was inches away from Draco again.
"Alright, last spin of the night and we can play something else." Seamus grumbled. He must've been grumpy that he hadn't gotten any action so far. Harry snickered at the thought. Seamus spun the wand. Everyone watched it go round and round, waiting silently with anticipation. As it slowed Harry's heart dropped to his stomach. The wand stopped right in front of him. His eyes slowly moved up the wand and to his horror, he saw that the wand had also landed right on Draco Malfoy. The other boy just smirked.
"The young master and his guests leave for Hogwarts today. No more cooking and cleaning up after you lot." He responded with a sneer. Harry smiled. Even Kreacher's nasty attitude couldn't stop him today.
As they went down the path, they passed somber looking fans and families. It felt as if they all had overheard the conversation. Harry kept his eyes down on the path. He could feel everyone staring him down wondering what his role was in all this.
They spotted Ginny, Fred and George at the last lantern where they had said to meet them. Harry was glad for a distraction. Arthur hugged the three of them close and kissed Ginny's head.
"Harry this is the first sorting you've been to since your own." Hermione muttered, having overheard them. He laughed. She was right.
Mcgonagall placed down the three legged stool. Then she set down the old sorting hat. The tear in the brim that seemed to serve as a mouth opened wide and sang it's song.
"No, just Lynch!" Ron yelled back. Just as he predicted Lynch crashed into the ground and was surrounded by a horde of angry veela.
Bill started to sing loudly again and Sirius joined in. They pulled Harry up between them and the young wizard started to sing with them. They finally made it to their booth and started to shuffle around and pick their seats. All the chairs were recliner types with a pair of bewitched binoculars sitting on each seat. The booth was decorated in the colors of the team they were rooting for, Ireland. They had debated for weeks on what team they would be supporting. Loyalty won over Harry's personal opinion. Viktor Krum was one of the youngest players in the league but he was the best and he was playing for Balgaria. There was no way that the Irish could beat them with a seeker like that. Fred and George clearly disagreed as they were dressed in all green and white, including the giant leprechaun hats that came with attached ginger beards. Sirius had thought it hilarious and bought the pair of hats before Arthur could object.
When they got back to the Black household, Mrs. Weasley exploded into a frenzy. First she shouted at Arthur, then Kingsley, then Sirius, then Lupin, and then it was the kid's turn. She started on Fred and George as they were the oldest of the group of troublemakers.
The man started to walk and with every step a loud clunk echoed through the Hall. Harry wondered if the event Dumbledore had been mentioning was pirate themed. This man looked like he had come straight from the novel
The same lusty feeling overcame him again and he lost what little control was holding him back. His hands shot up and pulled Draco in close. He gripped tightly onto his hips and kissed him hungrily. He felt Draco's hands come up and touch his chest. He was kissing him back with the same intensity, catching Harry by surprise. He grabbed the front of Harry's robes in his fists like maybe he was trying to break away. Harry thought maybe he had made a mistake. Draco hated him after all. When he felt the other boy's hands shove against his chest he pulled back. Harry snapped his eyes open and saw his look of confusion was matched on Draco's face.
The fact that they're bold enough to pull a stunt like this, is frightening. Conjuring a dark mark is now considered a war crime. It was all planned out just like Voldemort's back then. A vicious attack and then a dark mark symbolizing where it happened. They had the numbers to pull it off too. This wasn't just a couple of kids in masks. I think this was planned by him to scare people or remind them that he's still out there." Sirius explained.
The day went on much the same. Harry had to talk his Godfather out of buying quite a few expensive items for him. He couldn't see himself using the solid gold collapsible cauldrons, at least not without catching some critic from Snape. He did splurge on some Quidditch gear he could use to decorate his bunk this year including an Irish flag and a miniature figure of Viktor Krum on his broom.
"See ya at the feast if we don't drown!" He called. Harry chuckled again. The first years huddled around him looked terrified. He couldn't blame them. Crossing the lake's choppy waters on a night like tonight was undesirable to say the least. The three teens made their way to one of the horseless carriages. Once all the students had found seats, the carriages started up. Then they were off to the Hogwarts castle.
"Look at the referee!" She giggled. Harry looked down to see Mostafa had landed in front of the Veela and was attempting to show them what little muscle he had.
"Hello again Harry! Staying away from those dragons I hope." He said with a wink. Harry shook his hand too. As he did he noticed a particularly bad bite mark on Charlie's thumb.
"I'm going to get a few snacks for later tonight from the Trolley, do you want anything?" Harry asked. Hermione had her nose in a book and shook her head without even looking up. Ron had been nodding off. He unstuck his face from the window and shook his head.
"We're almost there actually. The portkey is at the top of that hill." He explained pointing in that direction. Harry started to race up the hill. All traces of exhaustion were driven out by excitement.
"What's got you in such a state?" She asked. Harry climbed onto his seat and dropped the snacks into his trunk.
"BLARGH! PEEVES!!" Ron shouted suddenly from his right. Harry felt a large wet pop on the top of his head. Ice cold water trickled down his head and into his robes. Looked like the school's poltergeist was excited to see the students returning too.
He was so excited to finally be seeing his first professional Quidditch match. Ever since he had made the move to Sirius' house they had done nothing but catch up on Quidditch, news and politics. Harry had never had a chance to even form opinions on magical matters like these. He felt more and more like a wizard everyday that he stayed with his Godfather.
"Well we've got to find it. What if someone looks at the last spell you cast." Dean said getting up from the tree. A rustling noise started from their right. The group turned and those who had wands raised them. Ginny still had her wand lit up from before. She raised it a little higher.
"I was teasing you as I always do. Maybe you have fallen in love with me? It doesn't matter anyways because I'm not a homo." Draco spat. Harry raised an eyebrow at that. He sure didn't kiss like he was homophobic.
"What are you doing, Potter?" He snapped. Harry felt his anger building. Malfoy had returned that kiss even if it was only for a moment.
"Students this is our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Professor Moody has extensive experience as an auror for the Ministry of Magic. I hope that you all will pay close attention to the wisdom he has to offer." Dumbledore announced. This announcement was met with dead silence. Not a single staff member or student knew how to react and clapping was the last thing on their mind. The man in the long torn coat stood and waved to the students. Whispers burst out throughout the Great Hall. His eyes searched the crowd until finally they both stopped and stared dead at Harry.
"If you're quite done scaring the shit out of them with your ghost stories, I'd like to pack up and take my family home." Arthur said flatly. Harry's stomach sank. Sirius sighed and stood up.
"Show that 'nasty git' some respect, he made the food you're so hastily and rudely shoving in your mouth." She snapped. Fred and George both opened their mouths mid chew and stuck out their tongues. Bits of gravy fell out onto their plates.
They ran through easily and immediately spotted the Weasley family. Ginny saw him and quickly turned to her parents to say goodbye. Then she disappeared onto the train. Harry felt a twinge of sadness but still joined the rest of the Weasley's on the platform.
"We saw Seamus and Dean leaving. They invited us back to camp to celebrate and maybe get ice cream if the booth was open still. We were about halfway through the field when the confusion started. We all ran into the forest and I dropped my wand. We ended up catching Ludo Bagman wandering around. Hermione found us. Seamus and Dean went to find Seamus' parents. Ginny, Fred and George went back to find you guys. Hermione, Ron and I retraced my steps to find my wand and we ran into a man. We couldn't see him. I shouted at him and he cast the spell. That's when everyone else showed up. I'm confused though. What was that mark about?" Harry asked. Sirius stared at him and then at the other kids. He knew a lie when he heard it.
Amos Diggory worked in the Ministry and was particularly welcoming when Sirius returned, unlike some of his other coworkers. This led to a steady friendship that kept he and Harry from losing their minds in the giant house alone.
"Bill and Charlie keep dropping hints that something out of the ordinary will happen this year but they won't say what it is. Probably has something to do with that." Ron suggested. Harry scratched his head in thought. A quiet knock on the door interrupted his thinking. Kreacher shuffled in the room looking a bit sour. He looked at each of them before speaking in his dead tone.
"Our first victims are Dean from Gryffindor and Helena from Ravenclaw." Seamus announced. One of the Slytherin sitting at the desks got up and opened a closet door behind him. A couple of barrels stood against the back wall. Empty shelves lined the other two walls.
"It was swell. Sad I missed the cup. How was yours?" She returned. Harry nodded then realized that he was supposed to articulate an answer.
"I'll warn Dumbledore but I know they won't cancel the cup. We'll just have to double up our security. I know how you kids are when there's any sort of trouble,
"Two penalties for Ireland?! I don't believe it." Bagman cried. The two beaters got back on their brooms and play resumed with an added ferocity that had not been there before. Two penalties later and the team mascots were at each other's throats.
"It's so rainy." He whined. Harry chuckled. They got out of the train with their fellow students and immediately regretted it. Rain and wind pelted them from all directions. The night was gloomy and the moon hid behind the clouds.They looked around the station and saw a giant silhouette through the gloom.
"Wait for me! Harry!! " Someone shouted from above. Again Harry's heart dropped. The fun was over. He looked up and saw Ginny running down the stairs. She was alone. He looked farther up and saw that no one had followed her. He was surprised that this many of them had succeeded in sneaking away.
"You don't have to be so nervous. She likes you too, you know." She explained. Harry didn't want further explanation to that. It would only make him more nervous if she did have a mutual crush. Harry felt the train slow to a stop. Ron lifted his head again and wiped away the drool.
"Harry Potter, privilege to meet you. I'm Bill. I work for a wizarding bank in Egypt otherwise we would've met much sooner I assume. Ron told me all about you when he came to visit last year." He said. Harry raised his eyebrows. It was an impressive title for a man with a ponytail to be holding but Harry felt it gave him character.
"PEEVE'S, YOU WILL STOP THIS NONSENSE AT ONCE." Professor McGonagall ordered. She had just stormed down the steps and she was angry. Peeve's flew high into the air, blew a raspberry and disappeared through the ceiling. McGonagall whipped out her wand and muttered out a spell. Suddenly everyone in the Entrance Hall was dry and warm. A cheer sounded for their heroine. Then they happily filed into the Great Hall and found their seats.
"Then why'd you kiss me back?" Harry asked with a smirk. Malfoy raised his hands to shove him but Harry caught them around the wrist and pulled him closer. Their faces were inches apart. He could smell the firewhiskey on his breath.
"Harry Potter, master of the Wronski feint." He cackled. Harry joined his laughter. Sirius looked up from his pint and smiled.
"Alohamora." She muttered flicking her wand at the same time. The door clicked and she pushed it open. This time the door swung forward. Most of the fourth years sat in a big circle. A few students were sitting at the pile of desks in the corner. They all turned to stare when the three walked in. Harry felt tense and nervous like he had just walked into a situation where he wasn't welcome.
"It'll be the best year of your life!" Charlie shouted back. The three teens watched as the adults turned and apparated away. They all sat back and looked at each other.
He had never seen so many wizards in one place. They were from all over the world too. He felt lucky to have Kingsley walking with them as he had driven off many people who had wanted to say hello to Harry. Still the tall wizard had not been able to stop them all. He had met a couple of ill tempered Italian wizards who were bigger fans of Voldemort's than him and told him outright. He met a vampire that told him he had been turned the same year that Harry had defeated the Dark Lord. He even met a bloke from Australia that had some fascinating stories about the magical creatures that lived down under.
The rest of their car ride slipped by almost in slow motion as they talked and played games, trying to keep the boredom at bay. They had been on a particularly difficult round of ISpy when Sirius finally pulled into a dirt parking lot. He turned the car off and let out a huff.
Ron, annoyed with Hermione's comment, nudged her with his elbow. She nudged back harder. Ron's shoe squeeked against the floor as he managed to catch himself. They started to argue about the party again. Something they'd done all night. Even though all of the girls in her dorm room had spent the night excitedly chatting about going to this party, she had felt quite the opposite. There was no way that she was going to be left behind by the other two though. She insisted they'd need her to get there without detection.
"Mad Eye is claiming another break in Arthur, you've got to get over here. The please-men are just everywhere. He's inconsolable about his rubbish bins. They attacked him, you see." He was shouting. Arthur groaned and looked to Molly and Sirius. They nodded and with a turn and pop, he disappeared. Harry couldn't wait until the day he too could apparate.
Harry looked around in confusion. The firework had soared out his hand but it hadn't gone off quite yet. Where had the noise come from?
"Harry, I can't believe you said yes to this." Hermione whispered as they moved through the dark corridors. The three fourth years were the last to leave Gryffindor house. The Fourth years had agreed to go in small groups so as not to get caught. They were tucked under the safety of the invisibility cloak but Harry didn't know what the others had done to prevent being seen.
"So this is the new house, aye Harry?" Ron commented looking around. They were standing in the living room which had been decorated in warm colors.
"He did say number 6 right?" Ron asked. Harry nodded. Hermione whipped out her wand with an eye roll.
"Oh, come off it, Barty. Some of our stun spells went that far. Let's check if we got them?" Diggory suggested, running in that direction. They watched him disappear in silence, daring not to even breathe. His brown-haired head disappeared into the dark. The man was bold.
The woods and camp around them erupted in screams as witches and wizards caught sight of the giant green spectre. Ron himself had started screaming though Harry hadn't noticed when. Hermione grabbed Ron's arm too and pulled the both of them as hard as she could toward the path. They stumbled behind.
"Thanks Kreacher, we'll be down in a minute." Harry responded. Kreacher shuffled out and disappeared, the way he often did which was very suddenly and without explanation. They all stood up and followed him out. Ron and Harry raced down the stairs while Hermione trailed behind admiring the house as she descended. They went to the dining room and sat down at the table with Sirius.
"He's not dead, but he's not alive either. He's in this weak shriveled state. I remember seeing it in my dream. He was awful." Harry said quietly. He wrote down the little details that had come back to him on the paper. Sirius looked troubled.
"Thank you Kreacher. I appreciate your service this summer. You've been a great help to me." She started, smiling kindly at him. Kreacher grumbled and dissapeared through a door.
"I've lost my wand!" He exclaimed looking back in the direction he and Ginny had come from. Everyone looked at him. They needed a distraction from their thoughts.
"I am sure they believe the same," Dumbledore said, "The Ministry thought that putting away werewolves and those who were possibly infected would make it safer for the population. The Purebloods thought that rejecting Muggles and Muggleborns would keep their world safe from Muggle influences. They went overboard and sometimes, the reasons are selfish, but they began with believing that they did the right things."
"I tried negotiations, tried to talk, but they couldn't be convinced. They wanted me to be their poster boy; supporting whatever programs they sprouted out. They don't want me to think for myself."
It didn't matter that some triggers had to be executed before the dormant infection woke up. It didn't matter that said Mediwizard couldn't even state yet what were the required conditions. People panicked. They were afraid.
"Can we meet again? For a drink?" He asked, hesitantly. He knew, oh he knew Harry would say no but he could not prevent himself to ask for all the gold in Gringotts.
Worse, he realized that there were way too many skeletons in the Malfoy closet. There was a lot of fodder for insult and mockery that even an unimaginative child could easily dig up.
Harry was no stranger to dreams, especially nightmares. He categorized his nightmares into three different groups: memories induced, reflection of impossible hopes, and Voldemort's hand-me-downs. So, when he found himself on King Cross just as soon as he felt asleep, he was not surprised.
The words cut through his rumination and shocked him to the core. He had been careful. How much did she know? Was it an unfortunate coincidence? Did she somehow know it since the beginning, smart as she was? Well, at least he could discount the possibility of Harry trapping him, he thought humorlessly. Harry was, after all, the one who had told him that if Draco told anybody, Harry's friends and Draco's family included, about the nature of his job, Harry would personally make his life more of a living hell than it was.
As a son, he was a failure. As a husband, according to his ex-wife, he was also a failure. So why was he surprised that as a father he was nothing but a failure, too?
It was stupid, he knew, to fall for a man who only saw you as a tool. It was even stupider to still love said man, despite how badly he treated you.
"Professor," Harry said, approaching the red bench where Dumbledore was sitting. He was wearing his purple robe, the one with silver stars on it, but Harry noticed that there was no twinkle in his eyes. Instead, they looked a bit sad.
With a sudden insight, Draco realized that on some level of her consciousness, Granger must have known that Harry had changed. She just didn't want to admit it, choosing to turn a blind eye instead. He wondered what kind of justification she had used to convince herself.
The glee was killed in an instant and replaced with fury. He stood abruptly and stalked towards her side.
Then, when he saw the infuriating, annoying, maddening, way too bright, unbelievably natural, precious white blond tumbling out of it, he knew in his heart that yes, despite all the changes and troubles, Hogwarts was his home.
Even remembering it was enough to rouse his anger and self-loathing once again. He couldn't protect her, couldn't even give her justice.
"If I help you, I request immunity for my family. There must be a way we can develop a mutually beneficial relationship."
Suddenly, she realized in her musing that she had reached Harry's office. She lifted up her hand, prepared to knock, when she saw that the door was not closed completely and there was someone inside with Harry.
Sometimes, he wished that his family hadn't followed that mad man, that his father had taken a different course in life. He wished that his mother had not gone out alone on that blasted day to Diagon Alley. If she had taken somebody with her, maybe that Muggleborn wouldn't have hexed her and instead of depending on potions, she would be the healthy, determined woman he had known. Most of all, he wished that he was not so powerless.
He had enjoyed it for sure, but he had always categorized their time together as sex and only sex. Why should he spend more time in foreplay and seduction? After all, Malfoy was a sure thing, and as long as the act was done, he was satisfied.
It was, he supposed, like taking a Muggle drug. It made you high and happy for a while and when the effect disappeared it would leave you feeling even worse than before. Yet, Draco was used to disappointment, wasn't he?
"And you are saying that you didn't try to sway her to your cause, to make her hate me? Surely you know how easily she is influenced into defending what she sees as the poor and defenseless, regardless of whether they deserve it or not!" Harry practically spat the last sentence. "Tell me Malfoy, why the hell do you work for me?"
"Do you know how it feels, Granger, to have hands pawing all over you, to not be able to say no even if you don't like it? Do you know how it feels to just lie down and take all the humiliations you are subjected to, to obey like a pet, knowing all the while that there is nothing you can do?"
Harry was no stranger to dreams, especially nightmares. He categorized his nightmares into three different groups: memories induced, reflection of impossible hopes, and Voldemort's hand-me-downs. So, when he found himself on King Cross just as soon as he felt asleep, he was not surprised.
They took the light from her eyes like they took her from him. And that ungrateful Malfoy, how dare he to refuse, to argue? Death Eaters had to be punished for what they did. They killed and plundered, and then they pretended to repent, but how could one change what was rotten to the core?
Back at his quarters much later than usual, Harry was commiserating more and more with Snape each day (surely a sign that he had gone crazy). The students should know better than to procure a detention, thus force him to spend many miserable hours supervising them in a cold classroom, rather than reclining on his couch with his half-read Muggle Detective novel.
Unfortunately, it was only that, a plan. His only remaining house-elf had woken him up at ten o'clock in the morning with the news of Granger's sudden, unexpected arrival.
Draco had thought that something like love surely could bring no shame. He also had thought that there was no way he could feel more miserable. He was wrong on both counts.
"It is not enough, though. I loved Ginny and she died. I loved Teddy and the Ministry took him away," Harry said bitterly, flopping down to sit beside Dumbledore again.
Ginny. She had been so young, so happy. She wore her hair in a ponytail in those days and Harry loved to play with it while she rested her head on his shoulder.
Not that Draco thought he did not deserve Harry’s anger. He had, after all, told the Death Eaters about the Order’s plan for rescuing the Muggleborns wizard and witches that had been captured. The order had taken him in and given him refuge and he had betrayed their trust. Worse, he had betrayed Harry’s trust.
Draco shivered and pushed the bell beside Harry's door. It was raining and he didn't feel like casting an Impervious Charm.
Still, Dumbledore, Harry decided, must be barmy. How could he even begin to compare Ginny with Malfoy? Besides, there was no way he could love Malfoy, not even if he wanted to, which he didn't.
He was also nervous if his words were any indication. Or maybe he was afraid. After their last encounter, Harry couldn't say he blamed him.
How could she say that? Didn't she understand that love was not enough? That they were still essentially fighting, even if the shape of the war and those who sat on the enemies' chairs had changed?
Draco hid his face in his hand. He couldn't believe he just poured out his soul to Granger of all people. Maybe the loneliness had gotten to him. His old friends, after all, either in Azkaban, death, or didn't want anything to do with him anymore.
"I can sell myself to Muggles. After all, it seems like it's the only thing I am good for, right?" said Malfoy, bowing his head.
Harry loved the sofa he sat on. It was beige, and comfortable, and modest, and most importantly, they had chosen it together, he and Ginny, when they first moved into Godrics Hollow. He remembered them hopping from shop to shop, looking for new furniture to decorate their equally new home. Harry never knew shopping could be so much fun before that day.
Draco no longer believed that the world would give him whatever he desired. He knew that the other man wouldn't feel the same for him, couldn't even stand him, for that matter. Weren't his current circumstances solid proof of that? Harry would never use any of his friends like he used Draco.
Ron's face had become as red as his hair. He led the charge to the car after that, quickly getting over his embarrassment. He was among friends after all. Sirius' car fit all their trunks and pets comfortably. Harry thought maybe because his trunk was also charmed like Mr. Weasley's.
"Alright, here's the plan. We set them off in the field at the same time. We run to the apparition point down this path. Then we sneak back to the campsite and pretend we were in your tent the whole time." Seamus explained. Dean had already started passing out fireworks. A few screams came from the campsite but Harry dismissed it as partygoers getting rowdy.
The fans were quiet as it started to sink in that the game was over and a winner was apparent. A sound like a jumbo jet started up as the Ireland supporters got more and more rowdy.
"We bet Krum gets the snitch but Ireland wins." He responded. The other twin overheard and started to cheer loudly. Then the both of them disappeared up the stairs whooping and hollering along the way.
As they were ascending up the stairs, a lantern bobbed around the corner. Filch, accompanied by Mrs. Norris, ran down the steps just barely missing Hermione. His cat however barreled right into her legs and yowled in surprise. Harry signaled for them to start moving up the stairs around her. They had to get out of here. Filch's head snapped back and he ran back to Mrs. Norris who was pacing the step they had just been standing on.
The morning of September 1st, Harry Potter was awake before the sun had touched the sky. He was ready to go before his Godfather had even cracked his eyes open for the morning. Hermione seemed to be the only person matching his enthusiasm as she was awake before him.
The kids get into a bit of trouble and Sirius' guardianship capabilities are questioned. I think I might take this in a more emotional direction. Let me know what you think. I'm sorry there's so much dialogue and if I write dialogue awkwardly.
"Hermione, it's a Quidditch match! You go for the game, not the people!" He shouted. Hermione rolled her eyes. Hedwig woke up and screeched.
"Nice to meet you. That must be an interesting job." Harry remarked. They shook hands and Bill continued to introduce himself to Sirius and Hermione. Charlie wasn't far behind him. His hair was shorter but he had scars marking his arms and a couple on his cheeks.
"Goodnight boys, thanks for forcing me to come." She giggled, making her way up the stairs to her dorm. Harry was happy to see her letting loose. Though the night had gone disastrously for him, it seemed his friends had a good time.
"Well, it was in Europe at the time. Ireland vs. Someone. Almost everyone spoke different languages but that's just part of the World Cup's atmosphere anywhere, I think. It was just your dad, Lupin and I. Peter didn't go. Neither did your mum. It was so fun. We got so hammered. And of course our team won. We partied until dawn." Sirius said raising his eyebrows. Harry laughed.
"Sorry, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop. Hedwig flew in my window and landed on my bed. I figured you'd want her in your room." She explained. Harry smiled.
"Let's get this over with." Harry sighed, standing up and crossing the room. Draco bounced up and followed him. The boy at the door was too stunned to move so Draco shut the door behind the both of them. He seemed almost too enthusiastic about the situation. Why did he seem excited? Harry looked around the room, trying to find anything more interesting than the Slytherin behind him. Now that he was in such tight quarters the feeling of dread had been replaced with something else, an attraction that he had not paid any attention to before now. Harry had felt the same thing the night Ginny had come into his room. Though this time he found it was much harder to stifle his feelings.
"Are you guys gonna try to enter the Tournament? If the age restriction wasn't up I reckon I'd have to. Gran is always going on about Family Honor.  What kind of tasks do you think there'll be?" Neville stammered excitedly. They started up the Grand Staircase.
"Wha-when?" He blurted before leaning over and puking violently. The girl who had been trying to wake him screamed in disgust.she clapped a hand over her mouth realizing what she had done. The remaining students froze. They had removed the soundproofing charm from the room already and with the door wide open she had surely been heard by half the castle. Everyone got up and ran leaving poor Johnathan behind in a drunken heap. Hermione whipped out the invisibility cloak when the trio reached the stairs and quickly threw it over the three of them.
The trio made it back to their own floor uncaught. Harry wasn't sure how their drunken stomping feet hadn't been heard. Ron even fell over at one point having fell for the trick step. Hermione woke the Fat Lady and snuck through first. Ron and Harry followed.
"That's good." He managed to sputter. Ron passed it back and he took a smaller swig than the first. He held back his cough much easier the second time around though it still burned. He felt warmth spreading throughout his body from head to toe. He felt looser and more confident.
"You don't think they'll keep us from school do you?" She asked biting her lip. Harry couldn't stop himself from staring. They were bright red and just barely swollen. Probably because she was nervously biting them all day like she just had. Her pink tongue darted across her lips before she closed her mouth.
"Mr. Bagman?" She called. Harry looked at her and then back to the forest's edge. Ludo Bagman stumbled onto the path. His hair was disheveled and his glasses askew. His color changing bowtie was partially untied and hanging from his neck. He looked pale and frightened. He must've seen what the teenagers in front of him had seen at the camp.
"Neville, none of us are of age. There's no chance of us being able to enter anyway." Hermione lectured. Neville hung his head but unfortunately, it wasn't in time to see the trip step that he somehow always forgot about. Neville let out a yelp as his leg sank through the empty space. Harry and Ron sighed and pulled him up by the armpits. He smoothed his robe and attempted to catch his breath.
Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Professor Moody. The Hall was filled with scraping and footsteps as the students crowded the door and poured into the Entrance Hall. Harry stood up with his friends. They passed by Fred and George who were already plotting ways to trick the judge. Harry didn't think any amount of aging potion or disguise spells would work for the twins.
"Just want to be prepared." Hermione replied. He shook his head and chuckled before jumping in to help her.
"The name's Winky, sir. House Elf and personal assistant to Mr. Barty Crouch but for tonight, server to all of you's! I expected to see Mr. Kreacher here but I suppose he's just as grumpy as he ever was." She squeeked excitedly. Harry smiled.
The veela cleared to the side of the field angering every male fan in the stadium. Ron slumped down in his seat. Moments later the Irish team mascots started to fly around the stadium. Leprechauns dressed in brilliant green and gold soared in a shamrock formation. Gold rained down from the shamrock showering the fans in galleons. Ron collected huge handfuls into his lap, laughing in disbelief. The leprechauns settled down on the opposite side of the field.
"Don't push me." He said quietly. Instead of the fear that he expected Harry was met with a different look from Draco. He looked hungry. Once again the Slytherin boy pressed his body against Harry's and kissed him roughly. Harry wrapped his arms around his waist and eagerly returned his kiss. This time they didn't spring apart or try to stop it. Harry let his desire take control.
" He asked wiping a handkerchief across his forehead. He shoved it in his back pocket. Sirius turned in a full circle looked back up at the hill nearby and stopped.
"Guys, hey, Harry, Ron wait!" A voice behind them shouted. Harry turned and saw Neville running toward them. He pushed and waddled through the crowd but right before he reached the trio someone stuck their leg out of the crowd, tripping the clumsy boy at the last second. Neville tumbled to the ground landing directly in front of Harry's feet. He and Ron helped the boy up and dusted off his robes a bit.
The next morning everyone buzzed with excitement, especially Sirius. He hadn't been school shopping in decades and he was excited to do it with his his Godson and friends. They were all at the breakfast table dressed and eating by 8 am. Mrs. Weasley was frantically serving up eggs when sparks started to puff from the fire. A face was emerging leaving Harry's curiosity to spark.
"Luckily, since you three were so quick, we'll have an extra 20 minutes to get there. We should be there before the Diggory's even arrive." He explained. They all cheered. Harry had met the Diggory's a few times. Sirius had invited them over to the house for dinner every couple weeks to keep Harry from dying of boredom. The son, Cedric, was a Hufflepuff at Hogwarts and was a few years older. He and Harry could get to talking about Quidditch for hours if they wanted to. Sirius had even let Cedric borrow his broom so that he and Harry could play catch in a nearby field a couple times.
"Who's there?" He called not moving from his spot. He was rooted in fear. The person quickly moved out of sight. Harry stepped backwards until Hermione was able to grab him and hold onto his arm.
Harry slid open the door and started down the hallway. The Trolley was stopped a few compartments down. Harry caught up to her in a few steps. As he finished getting his snacks, the compartment door to his right slid open. The beautiful Cho Chang stood a few feet away. Harry had never been this close to her. He'd only ever seen her at Quidditch and in the halls. He could see every perfect eyelash. She smiled shyly and Harry realized he had been staring. He started to fumble with all the parcels in his hands. His face felt hot. Packages started to slide from his grip and hit the floor. Harry could hear giggles coming from the compartment behind. Cho looked pained. Embarrased for him? Harry reached down and quickly picked up his stuff. How could he alleviate the awkwardness?
"Harry, run." Ginny yelled grabbing his hand and yanking him along with her. He gripped tightly to her hand as they ran back into the forest. A twinge of guilt overcame him as he thought back to a moment ago. He had wanted exactly this and now they were running for their lives.
Harry led the the other three up the stairs to his floor. Kreacher had made up the room next to his for Ginny though he didn't know why. He would have to resist the temptation to slip into her room at night. Though he wouldn't mind having someone to talk to. He had a lot on his mind.
"Let's find you lot a compartment?" Charlie suggested. He lifted Ron's trunk and they went in search. Luckily they had been standing pretty close to an empty one. Bill helped Harry and Charlie get the trunks in. When they finished, Sirius had just walked through the barrier. Harry waved to him. He crossed the platform and hugged Harry tight.
The sun was coming down and everyone was coming out of their tents, getting ready to make their way to the stadium themselves. Harry noticed a shift in the kind of groups they were passing as they got closer to the game. Tents were draped in green and so were the people. Families and young people were milling about.
"Hey, earlier Sirius mentioned we would need new dress robes for school, any idea what that's about?" He asked. The others shook their heads. Harry hoped that this school year would just be normal but it already seemed like there would be a twist.
"Well, everyone's been well. Percy got a rubbish job at the Ministry, now he's all high and mighty. He's only an assistant. Fred and George have been working on these new joke products that are brilliant in my opinion, been experimenting all summer. They call 'em Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Mum's furious though. They didn't get as many O.W.L.s as she was hoping for. Then she found out about their joke stuff and how they were planning to sell them at Hogwarts. That was a big fight. Oh, and the owl Sirius gave me, he's on his way right now. He's amazing. He's so big the only window he fits through is the one in the kitchen. He likes to talk to my mum too. She just loves him. Also Bill and Charlie are in town for the cup! They'll be going with us. They're really cool you'll like them. I know you'vemet Charlie but Bill, he works and lives in Egypt he's got all sorts of stories." Ron blurted. Harry remembered meeting Charlie his first year after he had taken a baby dragon from them. The man had scars all over but was still ruggedly handsome.
"Well, well, well, surprised to see you here, I guess. I don't know how Weasley afforded the ticket but I should've known he'd be anywhere you are, Potter." He spat looking down at them from his higher step. Harry stepped up to the landing he was on and got in his face.
"Well, no one knows. I'd like to imagine somewhere cold because their uniforms require a fur cape. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons have concealed their whereabouts so that no one can steal school secrets. There's a huge rivalry between all the wizarding schools. They used to have a Tournament but it got too dangerous to continue. Honestly boys, this is all in
"I did need something." She said quietly, almost whispering. She stepped into the moonlight streaming from Harry's window and he could've sworn in that moment she was the most beautiful she had ever been. He was mesmerized, no enchanted, by her beauty. She came closer and closer until all he could see was her face. Her big green eyes seemed to take up his entire view. They were filled with uncertainty.
"I made pie for everyone, it's cooling in the kitchen. You kids run along and enjoy a slice and then right to bed. Kreacher prepared rooms for all of you." Molly sniffled. Harry led the way to the kitchen. Most of the group hadn't been there before. As they filed down the hall, Harry heard angry whispers being exchanged among Sirius and Mrs. Weasley.
"Thank you." He whispered to Sirius as they embraced. The man had changed his life for the better. Harry knew this had to be the best night of his life.
"Can I go to sleep now?" Neville whined. Harry was pleasantly surprised that he had even come along. Other than the closet incident he had enjoyed his first night back at Hogwarts with his friends. He wondered again if he hadn't been born a wizard what kind of misery he'd be suffering through living with the Dursley's and going to school with Dudley. There would be no parties or drunken make-outs. He wouldn't have any friends. He crossed the room to his bed.
"You lot come find us after the match, yeah? We'll go get into some real fun if Ireland wins." Dean whispered with a grin. Harry nodded though he didn't know if he was up for a late night adventure, especially after his warning dream.
"Stop, oh god, STOP! That's my son!" He heard a voice he recognized. He lifted his head along with the other two. Arthur Weasley was rushing forward. He grabbed the three in a hug.
Harry looked up at the score board and almost choked on his food out of shock. The Irish had quite a lead and were showing no signs of slowing down. Bulgaria was actually losing. Another cheer burst from the Irish side. Looked like he'd be eating his words tonight.
"He's an absolute git." Harry muttered glaring at the door Draco had dissapeared through. The other fourth years in the room burst out laughing. Really, he felt bad but he didn't want his friends knowing what he had just done. He still didn't understand it himself. He walked back to his spot in the circle and sat down. Hermione passed him the bottle of Firewhiskey and he took a gulp before passing it off. A few Slytherin got up and walked out of the room too, glaring daggers at Harry.
"Hey, what's going on? Have you found everyone?" Lupin shouted from outside. Harry looked up to see him running to Arthur and Sirius. Kingsley wasn't far behind. He met eyes with Harry. He muttered something to Sirius who threw his hands up in defeat. The adults shuffled a few more feet away and huddled together in a circle to speak without anyone hearing. Harry desperately wanted to know what about.
"You as well." Harry responded. Sirius clapped him on the back and pointed toward the Weasley's. Harry gave Molly and Arthur a hug as well before boarding the train. Hermione climbed in after and Ron was already sitting in his seat looking grumpy. The train let out a final whistle. Everyone started to close the train doors. Harry, Ron and Hermione went to the window to wave goodbye one last time.
in the middle of things." He joked. Harry chuckled. He couldn't deny that his Godfather was right. Ever since Harry had found out he was a wizard, it seemed the magical world had it out for him. Harry finished writing and looked out the window. The dream slipped from his mind, every detail except a cold high pitched laugh. He wondered if he'd ever be able to move on with his life or if he would always have nightmares like this.
"Don't worry I got him back, punched him in the stomach a few times." He added. Ron smiled and clapped a hand on his shoulder. He just hoped that Draco didn't tell a different story in the morning. Ron would be furious. The boys got up and continued to their dorm. When Ron opened the door, the others cheered.
This statement was met with gasps and boos. Harry looked back at Fred and George, his fellow Quidditch teammates. They looked just as upset by the notion. Dumbledore cleared his throat and the Hall silenced once more.
" Hermione said. Ron again rolled his eyes. Harry wondered how dangerous a school tournament really could've been.
"And that boys, is why you should never ho for looks alone!" Arthur shouted over the chaos. The rest of the group erupted into laughter but Harry's eyes were glued to the chaos below. Ministry wizards had spilled onto the field, attempting to separate the leprechauns and veela with almost no success.
"I-I know I heard something. Is one of you ghosts messing with me?" Mr. Filch muttered. He stepped forward a few more steps. His lantern swung towards them, stopping inches in front of Harry's face. Harry grabbed Ron and Hermione's arms and did a slow side step towards the wall. The group quietly shuffled out of the way. Filch grunted and started down the hall again. They watched his lantern sway away.
"Master Potter, anything to drink or eat sir?" She asked in the squeekiest voice Harry had ever heard.
His scar twinged and he ran a hand over it. The countryside flickered by before his eyes. He blinked and the image faded.
"I know that all of you are probably eager to enter the Tournament and represent Hogwarts. This year, the heads of of the participating schools along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders. Only students of seventeen years of age and older will be allowed to participate in this event." -- Dumbledore raised his voice slightly to talk over the cries and boos of outraged students, such as the Weasley Twins, " This is a measure we feel is necessary to ensure the safety of our students. We feel, even with all the precautions that any student under sixth or seventh year is unlikely to have the skills to handle these difficult tasks. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks the impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion. I beg those of you who are underage, please do not waste your time trying to enter."
Ron led the way around the corner. Harry's heart leapt with excitement and nerves. He had never been invited to a party. If he had still been living at Privet Drive and going to muggle school he wouldn't have had a chance. Colored lights danced around the dungeon doorway, leaking through the cracks. Harry took the handle and tried turning the knob. The door was locked. He turned back to the others confused.
They both started down the rest of the stairs catching up to the rest quickly. Dean was already sprinting for the forest's edge. Harry broke into a run behind him. Once they had all reached the trees, they gathered on the path leading into the forest.
"Scared you'll fall in love Potter?" He asked snarkily. A few students oohed behind him. Harry would rather punch Draco in the face at this moment then spend any alone time in the closet with him. He looked to his fellow Gryffindors who had all fallen silent. They were waiting for his next move. If he wasn't careful he had a feeling that the tension between the two houses might erupt into a fight.
"I'd say in the next ten minutes or so. They can't have been far behind us." He responded. Harry nodded. Though he was dying with anticipation, he thought he could survive waiting another ten minutes for the others.
Harry sat on the floor close to the entrance, watching witches and wizards filing out of the stadium, some drunk, some disappointed and sobered. He saw Draco walking out, trailing behind his arguing parents. He looked sad. Harry felt almost bad for him. His right leg dangled down the steps and for a moment he thought about running down after him but that was a crazy thought. Ron sat next to him leaning against the wall with a dreamy look on his face.
He could blame the firewhiskey for his sudden lust for Malfoy. He could blame Malfoy. Deep down he knew it was him. Harry felt something besides hatred for his nemesis. If he were to keep feeding this feeling it would surely grow into a school boy crush that would leave him stuttering and fumbling worse than his attraction to Cho Chang. The thought of his friends finding out mortified him.
"When our foreign guests arrive on October 1st, I expect you'll treat them with kindness and courtesy. I also expect you'll give your whole-hearted support for the Hogwarts champion, no matter who that may be. And now, it is late, I know you're all eager to get to your lessons tomorrow. Let us retire to bed. Chop! Chop!"
This time Draco closed the distance between their lips. He leaned into Harry, pushing him against the barrels that stood behind him. Draco's hands tangled in his hair and yanked his head back.
"Now, Arthur and I got our tent sites all arranged so they're next to each other. We're going to have a tent for the adults, the kids and one for the girls, Hermione and Ginny, and of course Hermione is coming. I bought her ticket and I already talked to her parents. She's on her way over here, now! Ron is too.They're going to stay the week. We'll be meeting the rest of the Weasley's and the Diggary's as well, I believe, Monday morning to catch the Portkey to the stadium. This is it, Harry, your first world cup!!" Sirius excitedly recited the plan. He went to the kitchen and broke out the butter beer. Harry took a mug and sat down in the newly renovated kitchen. They had painted it a light sandy color and put in white cabinets and counter tops. Six wood stools stood around half the kitchen island. Sirius had been working hard to lighten up the originally Gothic house. They'd even gone so far as to knock down a couple walls. All while Kreacher grumbled the whole time.
"Don't worry, I'll be back in a couple months." He responded before shoving his mouth full of biscuit. Hermione shuffled into the kitchen looking tired but fully dressed and ready to go. Kreacher served her up a plate.
Suddenly something in Harry's mind just clicked. His hatred for Draco was still there but a stronger feeling was trying to beat that out. He couldn't help but notice how soft his lips looked or how his hair shined in the multicolored light. He hadn't noticed the beauty of his eyes. Before his thoughts could stray any further he snapped himself out of it and looked to his fellow Gryffindors instead.
"Harry, what happened in that closet with Malfoy?" He asked. Harry stopped and Ron ran right into him knocking them both over. They fell into a quiet fit of laughter, trying hard not to wake everyone up.
"I'm so ready to eat." Ron whined. Just as the words left his mouth the Great Hall doors opened again. Mcgonagall led the first years up to the front and lined them up along the staff table.
"Well, you're awful chipper." He remarked. Kreacher handed him a heaping plate of biscuits and sausage gravy.
"Forget the Quidditch cup?! I know you're joking. This one would have my head if he thought we wouldn't make it." Amos joked patting his son's shoulder. Sirius' alarm sounded on his watch signaling that they had five minutes to get to the Portkey.
Though they tried the adults would not budge on the secret events of the school year. They managed to learn that it was a big part of history but that was about it.
He had been worried that Harry would have a harder time adjusting to a world of magic when he had been deprived of it for so long. Then there was the matter of the Dursley's having inflicted a number of harsh punishments leaving Sirius to deal with the trauma that had come from it. Getting to know Harry was both extremely difficult and extremely rewarding at the same time. He took another sip from his pint and turned back to his conversation.
"Dad, is this it? It's just a dirty old boot!" Ron yelled from the circle. Laughter could be heard from the group of adults who had just broken over the hill. They pushed their way into the teenagers circle.
"Are you okay my sweet?" He asked as he picked her up. He stared up the stairs looking around for whatever had startled the poor cat. Mrs. Norris purred as Filch stroked and comforted her.
"...Father considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts. He knows the headmaster and all. They don't accept all that mudblood riffraff there. Mother had a fit though. She couldn't stand the idea of me being so far away. Father says they're so much more sensible in their teaching of the Dark Arts." Malfoy rambled on. Harry doubted Crabbe and Goyle were even listening. Hermione got up, tiptoed to the door and slid the compartment door closed, blocking out Malfoy's voice.
Harry woke with a start. A searing hot pain shot across his forehead. Voldemort must've been close by. He quickly sat up in bed and scanned the room but the dark wizard was nowhere in sight. He was at home in his comfortable bed.
"You haven't even made it to school, do try to take it easy on her?" Sirius asked. He had just walked in to witness the tail end of their confrontation. All of them shook their heads and burst out laughing again.
"Thank you, dear. Let me show you to your rooms. I had Kreacher set up two rooms on Harry's floor, it's three flights up, hope you don't mind but that was Harry's choice." Sirius started leading up the stairs. Harry liked being so high up in the house. It would take longer for anyone to reach him up there. It felt safe and private. They passed the second floor landing which had various photos of Harry, Sirius, James and Lily. Hermione stopped and looked over them. She smiled and touched the corner of a framed photo of Harry as a baby. He was flailing in a bath tub looking happy. They continued back up the stairs. When they reached the top, Sirius led them into the first room.
"We should take the cloak off before we get there." Harry suggested. There were not many students that knew about Harry's invisibility cloak. He wanted to keep it that way.. They slid it off their heads and Hermione tucked it away into her robes.
"This event has not been held for over a century. The Triwizard Tournament was first established as a friendly competition between the three recognized European schools of Wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. The tradition started some seven, maybe eight hundred years ago. Each school chooses a champion. That champion competes in a series of three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every four years. It was an excellent way for young witches and wizards of different nationalities to establish bonds and learn from each other- until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued." He explained further.
They were making their way to the stadium where Harry would see his first professional Quidditch Match. They had spent all afternoon prepping the campsite and shopping along the little kiosks set up. The three young wizards were decked out in their team's gear which they had bought from a stand earlier in the day.
Below the green glow there was a group, marching menacingly through the camp. They blasted tents and people alike out of their way. Shooting green flames from their wands as they went. Black cloaks and evil masks hid their identity from the crowd. Witches and wizards were running across the field, attempting to escape.
The house was peaceful and quiet except for the slow shuffles of the other kids who had just started to get up. Kreacher was singing a pleasant tune when Harry came into the kitchen for breakfast.
"If you ever get confused, just let me know Hermione. I'd be happy to explain it to you." Sirius said patting her on the back. Her death glare changed to a small smile. Harry and Ron turned to babbling excitedly about the game, with a few interjections here and there from Hermione. When they had finished breakfast, they all ran upstairs to pack and get ready. A bustle of excitement was coming from their floor as they rushed around. Harry didn't think he had ever showered that fast. All three kids were packed and by the front door in under an hour. Sirius who had just finished putting his own pack in the car was surprised to see them all lined up when he came back inside.
"Let's talk outside, shall we?" Sirius offered gesturing to the entrance of the tent. Arthur nodded and turned. Sirius followed him out.
"It wasn't Winky. The voice was deeper. It was a man." Hermione spoke up defending the poor house elf. Harry and Ron nodded in agreement. This bit of information didn't seem to settle the adults.
Lupin had arrived a bit later in the day with a few more of Sirius friends. Harry was glad to see his Godfather letting loose after being haunted by his dreams the past few months. This was their first real outing into the wizarding world since Sirius had been declared a free man. Harry thought he had noticed a few stares but he couldn't tell if it was him or Sirius they were staring at. It was a welcome change.
This only added to Mostafa's frustration. He began to jab his finger violently in the air, clearly telling them to get flying again. They crossed their arms and he put the whistle to his lips and gave two short blasts.
"Yes, well he's my boy isn't he? I get to decide how honest I am with him." Sirius snapped back. Harry relaxed onto the bench a bit. Harry felt as though his Godfather could easily give him up at anytime. He constantly wondered if the man was looking for a way out. If he was he was doing a good job of hiding it.
"These dreams I'm having... do you think i'll always have them? Will I always have this connection with Voldemort?" He asked. Sirius bit his lip in thought. Harry got the sinking feeling that his question would not receive the answer he wanted. His godfather didn't sugarcoat things. He liked to treat Harry more like an adult then a 14 year old. It was something Harry appreciated as the Dursley's had not even treated him as human in the past years he'd lived with them.
"Oh look, you woke the owl." Hermione scolded. Harry laughed again. He got up and opened the huge window so Hedwig could fly out. Then he closed it and sat back down.
"Goodnight." He said starting down the hallway with his owl in tow. He opened his door and shook Hedwig off his arm. She flew to her perch with another angry squawk. He opened the window so she could fly in and out as she pleased as it was still nighttime. Harry closed his door and climbed under his thick blankets. The Dursley's crossed his mind as he lay in the darkness trying to go to sleep. He wondered if they missed him or if they just missed having someone to yell at or if they were perfectly happy now that their nephew was gone. How strange it was that the people who had raised him up until age 12 now wanted no contact with him. Not that he wanted that. He could only imagine how awful it would be to invite the Dursley's over for a holiday. They would laugh and probably throw his invitation in the trash. Or worse, they'd show up and ridicule everyone, Harry included. The young wizard fell asleep with visions of pigs dressed in a similar fashion to his cousin.
He had an art room down the hall from Harry's bedroom that he spent his restless nights in, creating masterpieces out of the pain he'd lived through. They were dark and creepy paintings but they were beautiful. A few had even been bought by wizards in the Ministry. Dumbledore had also bought a painting he became particularly fond of when he came to put protection spells on the house.
Harry had just shoved an entire biscuit in his mouth when a Fourth year from Hufflepuff house promptly sat down in front of him. A strange thing to do, considering they barely knew the boy's name.
Harry, Ron and Hermione had tried to sneak away but were caught and given a piece of her mind. Even Ginny got a disappointed glare before her hug. As mad as Mrs. Weasley was, she was glad to see everyone alive and unhurt. Once she hugged Bill and Charlie she burst into tears.
"Goodnight Harry, try to get some sleep!" He called as Harry walked out of the room. Hermione was waiting by her door in the hall so Harry quickly caught up to her. He looked into her room to see Hedwig perched on the edge of her bed returning his gaze with her golden-orange eyes. Harry pulled down the long sleeves of his night shirt that he had rolled up earlier. He held his arm up and whistled. The snowy owl ruffled her feathers indignantly before jumping into the air and taking flight. Hedwig wasn't much for being summoned, she liked to make her own entrance. She soared around the room before landing gracefully on Harry's arm. Her talons just barely grazed his skin as she latched on for support.
"G'night then." Ron yawned. He disappeared into his room as well. It was just Ginny and Harry left in the hallway.
"Fred, George, these are your rooms. There's a conjoining bathroom." Harry said pointing at the two doors to his left. The door to the right shot open and Percy stuck his head out.
Krum had pulled up, again at the last second but with the snitch in hand. He held his fist in the air rising higher and higher. He had caught the snitch.
"Hello Harry Potter. My name is Kingsley Shacklebolt." He said shaking his hand gently. His voice was deep, soothing. Harry was glad to hear this guy was basically his magical bodyguard. Harry shook his hand and thanked him. The man continued to help the other's up, introducing himself along the way. They said goodbye to the Diggory's who had their own camp site reserved a few rows away and started toward their own.
Harry looked up just in time to see a fireball fly up and hit the broomstick of Viktor Krum. The seeker turned around to put it out which distracted him from seeing the bludger heading right for his head. He whipped around just in time to catch the bludger square in the face. Blood splattered everywhere. His nose was surely broken. Harry looked around for the ref to see if he'd  call a time out but Mostafa was suffering from a fiery broomstick too.
"Krum's found the Snitch!" He shouted to everyone. They stopped mid cheer and watched as Krum did a death dive. Dropping hundreds of feet down in a matter of seconds. The other team's seeker noticed and dived too though Harry didn't think he had actually seen it. The two wizards were dropping toward the ground so fast they looked as though they were skydiving.
This part always had Harry feeling a bit doubtful ever since the incident where Dobby had bewitched the barrier. At least now he knew what to do if he got locked out.
"Harry, come in." He beckoned. Harry closed the door behind him and made his way to the coffee table in front of them. He sat down cross legged on the top.
"This is my room down at the end." Harry pointed. They followed him to the room which had been decorated in forest tones, various browns and greens. His Firebolt hung up on the wall and a grand perch stood in the corner where Hedwig slept. It was made up of fake branches twisted and tangled together to form a large tree that spanned from floor to ceiling. A large hole in the center supported a nest of twigs and leaves which Hedwig was resting peacefully.
After pie, Harry led the way upstairs. The adults had retired to the sitting room. Both doors were closed but voices could be heard still. Harry stopped. The group of teens behind him perked up and gathered around too.
"Hello Harry, how's summer treating you?" Arthur asked as he approached them. Harry smiled and hugged him.
"There's Harry! Harry we're placing bets. What'dya say?" Sirius yelled when he saw him. He put an arm around his godson as the boy thought.
"You know nothing about me." He snapped. Then he turned around and flung the door open. Pansy Parkinson was barely able to jump out of it's way in time.
Dessert replaced the dinner feast and they continued to tuck in. Harry thought his stomach might explode. He heard a groan from Ron but turning his head back felt like a challenge at this point. The Great Hall had become quiet. Some students were already nodding off at the table. Others were so full they couldn't talk.
"We didn't notice you were gone until the riot started. I thought you all were dead. The adults are looking for you." She sobbed. Harry stroked her hair for comfort.
"I still can't believe it. Broken nose and all, he caught that snitch. Ireland won but Krum will go down in history. This game will go down in history." He muttered to Harry who was only half listening. Harry was replaying the final moment in his brain over and over. He couldn't imagine how Krum was feeling right now. For the first time Harry considered life after Hogwarts and what he might do.
"Alright, Ron, go get Hermione, let's get on our way so we're not late!" He shouted. Ron hopped up and promptly fell back down. His feet had tangled in the feet of the stool. The loud crash from him hitting the floor alerted Hermione. She poked her head in just in time to join in on their laughter.
"Mr. Bagman, all due respect it's safer here than back at camp, what with all the death eaters marching about." Seamus snapped back. The young boy didn't take kindly to being yelled at even at school.
"I can't believe the World Cup is only in seven short days. The best night of my life is in seven short sweet days." Ron blurted out. Harry laughed. He was excited too but Ron's enthusiasm still seemed to outweigh his own. He sat in the middle of his bed and Ron and Hermione joined him.
Dean stood up, crossed the circle and offered a hand to the pretty Ravenclaw. Helena blushed but took his hand and followed him to the closet, ignoring the giggles from her house fellows. The Slytherin standing there closed the door behind them. He seemed to have deemed himself in charge of the closet door. At least he was participating though. A couple of the other Slytherin looked bored.
"Good idea. Let's meet back at the last lantern on the path." Hermione responded. Harry, Ron and Hermione went farther into the forest continuing to where the group had encountered Ludo Bagman.
"How long until they're here, you think?" Harry asked. Sirius looked at his watch and then at the sun.
"Oh did it? How would you know? You conjured it maybe?" He shouted. Hermione teared up in fear. Harry pulled her by the hand to stand closer to him.
"Yeah, Sirius inherited it from his family so we've been fixing it up and trying to make it less gloomy and depressing. It took awhile, we're still not done with Kreacher's room and the attic." He explained. Hermione beamed.
"Who, is it, Ginny? I saw you checking her out the other day." He continued laughing. Harry put his head in his hands and the two men patted his slouched shoulders.
Sirius had been drinking since they had located the first booth selling Ale which was only shortly after they had arrived. Sirius' drunken state only made him more generous though. He had been buying drinks, snacks and trinkets for the group. He had even convinced Harry to wear a giant shamrock on his shirt.
People wandered through the sites, already starting up the festivities. A man in giant stilts walked around throwing little magic candies to kids below him. A fire breather, painted like a dragon, sat on a post and puffed a giant flame straight up in the air as they passed, causing Mr. Weasley to nearly jump out of his skin. From the back of the group Sirius let out a yell.
"Yes, and no. I don't have an exact answer for you Harry because your situation is very unique. There is no one in the world like you who has this connection with a wizard like that. My opinion on the matter? I don't think they'll stop until Voldemort is dead. Unfortunately, you can't track and kill someone who's
The Quidditch players flew so fast that Harry could barely keep track of them. Cheers were the only indication that anyone was scoring as the balls flew even faster than the people hurling them. Ludo's commentary was so fast it just sounded warbled above them. All they could hear were names.
School this year would be so different. Harry wondered what else was in store for them. Voldemort had already tried to ruin the Quidditch cup for him. He could only imagine what plans he was concocting now.
Ever since his Godfather had been released from Azkaban something had haunted him, keeping him up at night. He didn't like to talk about it much but the memories he did share were horrific enough to keep
Harry used his binoculars to zoom in on Viktor Krum who was staying still and flying above it all. He was looking for the Golden Snitch. Harry zoomed in on the handle of his broom. Gold letters spelled out the word Firebolt. Harry already felt a pang of guilt for his Nimbus back home. Nothing like the world's fastest racing broom to make you forget about your own. Suddenly Krum shot out of sight and Harry's gut did a flip.
"Alright kids, it's going to be a bit of a hike. Luckily, we have that extra time so don't worry about making stops along the way if needed. It's got to be hidden so the muggles can't find it." He explained. They all got out of the car and waited as Sirius loaded his own, much bigger pack onto his back. His Godfather helped him adjust the straps on his own pack and then they were off. Harry was so full of energy that the backpack felt weightless and so did he.
"Well Harry, either it was just a dream or it was a prediction. I'll admit, this makes me a bit nervous to take you to the game tomorrow." Sirius responded honestly. Harry sighed. He had been so excited. Yet another chance ruined by his nemesis. The ghost wasn't even a man and he was still ruining Harry's life.
"You should've seen Mum's face when she caught Fred sneaking some of their joke products in his pack." Ginny chimed in. That caused another loud laugh through the group as Fred and George launched into the story. They were just about done when Cedric and his father rounded the corner.
"Stop." Harry whispered throwing his arms out. A lantern had just rounded a corner and was bobbing wildly down the hall, directly their way. Clearly they'rebickering had been heard.
"Your dad just kept pestering and flirting with your mum until she said yes really. She was not a big fan of his at first but he wore her down. You have your father's looks but your mother's charm so it shouldn't be nearly as hard. My advice to you, don't do what your dad did. If a girl says no respect that and if you upset her apologize." He explained. Harry bit his lip in thought. As much as he wanted to make a grand gesture of apology, he couldn't risk Ron and his brothers finding out. Losing his friends and getting beaten up by the whole family didn't sound pleasant to Harry. He could always just leave her alone and hope the anger subsided.
"I should have seen it, but you are my best friend and turning a blind eye is easier. You are colder, less inclined to forgive. The Harry I knew used to act first, to help even an enemy. Remember how you helped Malfoy from the Fiendfyre? Now, everything has to be calculated first for your benefit. You used to argue for justice, for equal treatment!"
They took the light from her eyes like they took her from him. And that ungrateful Malfoy, how dare he to refuse, to argue? Death Eaters had to be punished for what they did. They killed and plundered, and then they pretended to repent, but how could one change what was rotten to the core?
“I’ll make you regret it someday, Malfoy! I’ll kill you myself!” the words Harry shouted out was piercing his heart, but Draco took extra care so he would not look back and his steps would not falter either.
"Oh, this is rich. Draco Malfoy loves me. You know what? You really are one fucked up person, Malfoy."
Some teachers, like Remus or Minerva, had told him stories that made teaching seemed like a noble, much needed, and incredible profession. You got the chance to change a student's life. You, as their mentor, could help determine the course that those youngsters would take during their life.
No, he knew the law would do nothing to help kids like Scorpius. On the contrary, letting people put ex-Death Eaters away without a fair trial, both for real and imaginary offences would leave his son practically an orphan.
"It is no use." The drawled voice from his side shouldn't surprise Harry like it did. "Thinking, I mean. But, well, you're always one for a lost cause, aren't you?"
There was a tug on his heart. Pity, maybe, or it could be guilt. On reflection, his own words to Malfoy before, about how the only skill Malfoy had was to become a whore, seemed unnecessarily cruel.
He could see that she was grasping on her last reason. She knew he was right, but she didn't want to accept it, since it would mean that Harry was the one at fault.
The old pain was back with full force on his chest. Or perhaps it was never left, merely lying dormant. It was regret and guilt and jealousy and broken dreams fused together and if he had to choose again he knew he would still choose the same path.
"I'm hurt! How can you think so little of my Slytherins? Unlike Gryffindor, they can find the truth without me holding their hands."
In a sense, he believed they were glad that he had chosen to pursue a career at Hogwarts. Despite their misgivings, he couldn't believe they would be any happier if he had followed his initial aspiration in becoming an Auror.
The hands that Harry had seen killing people were the same hands that had hugged and protected Draco from his nightmares and had hold him when he got cold. The mouths that Harry had heard sprouting curses and hexes were the same mouths that told little Draco his bedtime’s stories.
"Some days, I think the war was all in vain," he added bitterly, averting his eyes and looking at the ground.
It was warm inside, and Draco knew that Harry must have sent his children to the Burrow. Harry would have known that Draco would come that night.
The selection was a joke, really. All the proposals had to be examined first by a special committee, supposedly to save the Wizengamot's time. Only those that were deemed suitable would be presented to said Wizengamot. Yet, what was the use of perusing the proposal first, if there was no guarantee it would be accepted anyway? Moreover, what was the use of pretending to consider it, if most of the time the decision had been made in advance?
She knew, Harry thought. Suddenly, his chest felt heavy and it was hard to breathe, yet at the same time, it felt like a burden had lifted from his shoulders. He didn't need to lie and do things in secret around her anymore.
But not before Harry caught the look in his eyes. The grey orbs looked dejected and Harry realized that they had often looked sad, but he had never noticed before.
He tried to appeal to her common sense once more, but she just looked at him with the look that he hated: the one that said she was disappointed but felt hopeless to change anything.
"Good. I will tell him to come to Grimmauld at midnight tomorrow. You got twenty-four hours, the usual rules."
And there was Malfoy, sitting on the floor, looking up at him and telling him over and over, "You are Voldemort, Harry."
Without waiting for an answer, he proceeded to tell Granger about it in great detail. And when he saw her face slowly lose its color, a part of him felt strangely glad. Apparently, someone, however unwilling, could still give a damn about him.
And Harry. He didn't know when he started to develop feelings for Harry, but develop them he did. Perhaps it was after Harry saved him from the Fiendfyre. Perhaps it was longer. It didn't matter.
"You are disappointed." The tone was gentler, calmer, like a parent who tried to coax his child to say more. Yet Harry held his silence. Dumbledore sighed.
Draco had planned to wake up late. It was five o'clock when he stumbled home from Harry's that morning. Moreover, he had just spent the day before as some man's toy for the whole day.
Harry never knew, before his and Malfoy's agreement, he could be drunk on power. Even killing Voldemort hadn't made him feel like this. He felt hot and excited. He supposed it was like getting drunk on firewhisky, only better and without the hangover.
The voice was cold. Draco forced himself to concentrate and observe Granger better. She looked as rumpled as he felt. And she was angry; he could see it in her eyes.
And he had tried. He had knocked almost every door at Diagon Alley, had applied for anything and everything, including for positions as a waiter or a shop-assistant. Nobody wanted to hire an ex-Death Eater.
"Harry, I told you before that it is our choices that made us who we are. You know, Muggles have a saying that two wrongs don't make a right."
She deserved better, Harry thought. She deserved more respect than what she got, she deserved more recognition. She should have risen through the ranks of the Ministry, instead of being lumped with dull, tedious work. She scared the higher ups, he knew, with her tenacity and spirit for change and ability. One day...
A few moments later Hermione was standing in his living room. She seemed happy, Harry thought. Yet there were lines of worry around her eyes.
That was another truth, wasn't it? Even for Harry, who used to be a bleeding heart Gryffindor, even for the man that he had fallen in love with despite everything, he was just a body to be used.
The words were said in a confused tone, but Draco knew it was only a front. Dread started to spread inside him. Harry knew, or at least, he suspected something.
It was stupid, he knew, to fall for a man who only saw you as a tool. It was even stupider to still love said man, despite how badly he treated you.
Maybe someday, someday the pain would lessen. Someday he would be able to look back at this and thought of it as nothing more but distant memories.
They talked about the mundane things instead: the Canon’s prospect, Harry's job as an Auror, Draco's apothecary, the new café where Fortescue’s ice cream parlor used to be. They laughed and talked and Draco knew that they both was pretending that there was nothing else to be said – no accusation, blame, or explanation, threading carefully on a thin ice.
Malfoy lifted his face and looked up. Harry thought that Malfoy's eyes looked like a brewing storm and if he were to concentrate, Harry fancied seeing all the sorrow, anger and hate swirling in their gray orbs.
Without waiting for an answer, he proceeded to tell Granger about it in great detail. And when he saw her face slowly lose its color, a part of him felt strangely glad. Apparently, someone, however unwilling, could still give a damn about him.
"Professor," Harry said, approaching the red bench where Dumbledore was sitting. He was wearing his purple robe, the one with silver stars on it, but Harry noticed that there was no twinkle in his eyes. Instead, they looked a bit sad.
He grabbed Draco's chin with his right hand, forcing him to look into Harry's eyes. Then, Harry smirked.
Harry shook his head. He couldn't lose hope. After all, the proposal, when it passed into law, would bring Teddy back to them.
"Don't you understand what this will do to my family, Potter? This new law you want will doom us! People will accuse us of crimes out of spite and revenge, and they won't even verify the truth before they gleefully cart all of us to Azkaban!"
He grabbed Draco's chin with his right hand, forcing him to look into Harry's eyes. Then, Harry smirked.
A small part of Draco gave a gleeful smirk on seeing her flabbergasted expression. Her eyes had become comically big and for a moment, she forgot to close her mouth.
"Tell me Granger, you have always said that it was wrong to hate Muggles and Muggleborns because their existence and blood status are not their fault. Then, is it Scorpius' fault to be born as my son? Do you know why Astoria left us? She said that she couldn't put up with it any longer, that her father was right, love alone is not enough. It is romantic, of course, but faced with reality of no money and practically being a social outcast..."
Somehow, this raised Harry's ire further. Subconsciously, he knew that was only a dream, but he felt like he was fifteen again, standing in headmaster's office. It was as if he could feel Dumbledore's disagreement and disappointment through the simple gesture.
"I heard you had a fight with Miss Granger this evening," the ex-headmaster said when Harry sat beside him.
Of course, as a student, he had not spared much thought about his teachers – and he did have a convenient excuse for that: what with fighting Voldemort and all. Yet, finally, as a teacher, he saw the glaring truth: teaching was a troublesome profession in which half of the time you wanted to strangle your students.
"Your friends love you. Your family loves you. And I am sure Ginny is not the only one who loves you that way."
"You are disappointed." The tone was gentler, calmer, like a parent who tried to coax his child to say more. Yet Harry held his silence. Dumbledore sighed.
"You have to learn to accept that you can't change everything, Harry, and you need to learn to open your heart to love again. You will be surprised," the older man said, as if he could read Harry's mind. Then again, since he was Harry's imagination, maybe he could.
"So, are you implying that I am happy with this situation? Or that I am lying? Maybe I should have said who would want to help me? "
"And I thought you, Gryffindors, should be the fair and compassionate ones. I was a bully, Granger, not a killer. Even if you are so sure that I deserve it, can you honestly tell me that my mother does? Does she deserve to suffer for her husband and son's sins?"
Either that or he was making his own government and obliterating the Ministry. A feat that had become more and more tempting with every visit they had made.
"Look Hermione, what should I do? You know how it was. I had tried to convince the people in power, to argue with them. It didn't work. This works. They get what they want, someone who can be used to realize their fantasies and won't talk about them, and we get what we want, their support for our proposals. And if it failed, there is always blackmail. We can change the Ministry without war."
His mind ran back to his conversation with Dumbledore - whom he was no longer sure was only a figment of his imagination.
He had Apparated directly to Harry's from that man's place. The man, like most of them, had been old enough to be his grandfather. In many ways, he reminded Draco of Abraxas, with his white hair and kind look -- then the look disappeared as soon as they entered the chamber, replaced with lust and greed. He wanted Draco, and not in a grandfatherly way.
From where she was, she couldn't see his face and he wore a hooded coat to cover his hair. He knocked at the door and waited for a few moments before it opened to show her the head of Department of Magical Games and Sports, Abelard Raith.
How could she say that? Didn't she understand that love was not enough? That they were still essentially fighting, even if the shape of the war and those who sat on the enemies' chairs had changed?
"Hermione. What have you told her?" Harry pronounced Hermione's name slowly, as if Draco wouldn't understand it otherwise.
"Do you want me to just stay silent and let them do whatever they want to do, Hermione? Even after Ginny? After Teddy?"
He had said that he had missed England, and apparently – to the surprise of no one – nobody in England had wanted to give him a job. He also had waxed a touching tale about how he had always regretted what he had done that night, allowing Death Eater's into the school and all, and how he had wanted to give something to the school to show his remorse.
"You let me believe that it was your status as Voldemort's slayer that you were using; that and maybe a bit of blackmail that you gathered by digging out their secrets. You never told me that you were trading flesh as well!"
He didn't understand. It was not the first time she was looking for him at the office, even if they both preferred to talk at his house. Moreover, he could safely say that that he hadn't seen her at all, so she couldn't be annoyed because of something that he had done. Or was it possible that she was upset because she couldn't find him?
"Trust me Granger; this is even a worse punishment. I have a depressed father that rarely comes out of his rooms anymore, a sick mother that will have to depend on potions all her life, and a kid. On the other hand, I also have an empty vault."
Harry shouted out the words the moment he arrived at her house. He didn't give her any time to answer either, opting to envelop her in a hug instead.
And she wouldn't, would she? They all were so righteous, the so-called-Light-Side, so quick to point fingers, except of course, at themselves.
Hermione had been loitering around Number 12 Grimmauld Place for half an hour, Polyjuiced as a punk girl, when she saw a man approaching the house. Casually, to avoid attracting attention, she walked nearer and hid behind the black car on the neighboring house's lawn.
"Don't say that! This is not a Death Eater family! Yes, your grandfather and I made an awful mistake, but it doesn't mean that the entire family is made of Death Eaters. Besides, we have already paid for our mistake. Those kids have no right to say anything!"
Draco's worry grew by the second. Scorpius, he knew, was not a brave kid by any means. It seemed that cowardice was indeed a Malfoy trait. Still, he was also not a kid that would easily cry, even if it was pride that stalled the tears instead of endurance.
They had met accidentally in Gringotts. Draco was being torn between ignoring Harry and acknowledging that he had seen the other man when they collapsed into one another. Somehow, they ended up drinking together at the Leaky.
He could see that she was grasping on her last reason. She knew he was right, but she didn't want to accept it, since it would mean that Harry was the one at fault.
It had taken the ministry an entire year to decide whether the request was worth presenting to be voted on by the Wizengamot. He had thought that maybe he would have to give them more bribes.
Hermione had been loitering around Number 12 Grimmauld Place for half an hour, Polyjuiced as a punk girl, when she saw a man approaching the house. Casually, to avoid attracting attention, she walked nearer and hid behind the black car on the neighboring house's lawn.
"And why exactly should I care? Did the Death Eaters care about destroying innocent people's lives?"
"Some days, I think the war was all in vain," he added bitterly, averting his eyes and looking at the ground.
"Stay. I'll retrieve the proposal. Nobody will put your family in Azkaban. We'll look for another way to change the Ministry; a different proposal and some other methods to pass it."
Why couldn't he make anybody see it? He just wanted to make it right. Maybe his methods were not always perfect, but in the big picture, it was nothing, wasn't it? The end, after all, justified the mean.
Yes, he was happy. In fact, just that morning he felt ecstatic when he realized that the proposal had passed.
There was no answer. Harry thought it was discouraging that Dumbledore, or his imagination, couldn't provide any guarantee about it.
The selection was a joke, really. All the proposals had to be examined first by a special committee, supposedly to save the Wizengamot's time. Only those that were deemed suitable would be presented to said Wizengamot. Yet, what was the use of perusing the proposal first, if there was no guarantee it would be accepted anyway? Moreover, what was the use of pretending to consider it, if most of the time the decision had been made in advance?
"Just take it easy, okay?" Draco smiled and took Narcissa's frail hand in his own. Then impulsively he added, "Don't worry, I'll take care of everything,"
The room was relatively bare, with white walls and white floor. Once upon a time, Draco knew, this would have been a massive, comfortable bedroom with flower arrangements everywhere from colleagues trying to ingratiate themselves for his parents' favor. Yet the bed in the room was the normal, standard issue of St. Mungos, and the only flower arrangement was the small bunch of roses on the bedside table that Draco had brought with him. At least, Draco tried to console himself, it was a private room.
Still, when the bill came, he felt like it was far too fast, too soon. He did not want to let Harry go just yet, which was totally stupid since Harry was not his at the first place.
"Maybe someday," Harry said, smiled and turned around. Draco felt the familiar pain throbbed again. It was stupid, stupid to hope.
Yes, he was too cowardly to kill, wasn't he? But he was also too much of a bigoted jerk for him to defect to the light side. Draco Malfoy, always a failure.
Yes, he was powerless, but not totally useless. He would take care of his family, even if he lost his dignity and self worth in the process. He would dance to Potter's tune. He would make sure that his mother would get the treatment she deserved; no matter what the cost he would have to pay.
As a son, he was a failure. As a husband, according to his ex-wife, he was also a failure. So why was he surprised that as a father he was nothing but a failure, too?
"I don't know you anymore, Harry." There was no anger left on her voice. Her tone was just plain sad.
Yet, they were holding his parents’ lives as hostages. It was becoming a traitor or an orphan and there really was not a choice as far as Draco concerned.
"Don't say that! This is not a Death Eater family! Yes, your grandfather and I made an awful mistake, but it doesn't mean that the entire family is made of Death Eaters. Besides, we have already paid for our mistake. Those kids have no right to say anything!"
The fear and anger in Draco's heart seemed to cool down into a lead. And that was the crux of the matter, wasn't it? Harry didn't care, he couldn't care.
He still could feel the old man's greedy hands pawing at him, his forceful lips at his. He still could hear his mocking voice in his ears.
"Yes, nobody else wants you, Malfoy. After all, you just have one skill, don't you? And it is to open your legs for everyone who pays."
The voice felt too patronizing for Harry's liking. It was not the tone of a person who believed. It reminded him of the tone one used to pacify an angry beast that refused to see reason, but was too dangerous to be opposed directly.
But Draco knew how it would be. People would soon make up some crime or another that his family allegedly had done. His parents and he would be sent to Azkaban, and the Ministry would put his son into an orphanage.
Yet again, he was a failure, wasn't he? He had nothing to offer her. Her friends started to distance themselves once they realized she had neither money nor influence anymore. He couldn't buy her clothes and jewels or take her out for dinner. In fact, the few times she did go out, people jeered and sneered at her.
"I am sure they believe the same," Dumbledore said, "The Ministry thought that putting away werewolves and those who were possibly infected would make it safer for the population. The Purebloods thought that rejecting Muggles and Muggleborns would keep their world safe from Muggle influences. They went overboard and sometimes, the reasons are selfish, but they began with believing that they did the right things."
Harry had said that it would keep the Wizarding world safer, that sometimes, things like technicality and lack of proofs had made it possible for criminals to escape justice. And Harry had argued that once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater. After all, if you could kill once, who could guarantee you wouldn't do it again?
Still, perhaps it was because Malfoy thought that Harry was that stupid he would fall for the lie nonetheless, since Harry had seen how Malfoy dealt with the Ministry's paranoid workers, and he knew for a fact that Malfoy could do it with straight face.
Someone, Harry thought, should tell Malfoy that he was an utter failure as a liar, with that smirk of his playing on his lips.
Fear crept into Harry's heart. Did that mean Hermione knew about the method he employed to pass their proposals?
Draco had just knocked on the door when he was pulled inside and pushed against the wall by a furious Harry. Harry's green eyes were bright and he put his hands on the wall, trapping Draco inside them.
He was rather adorable like this, Harry involuntary thought. He bridged the distance between them with quick steps and hugged Draco.
There was no answer. Harry thought it was discouraging that Dumbledore, or his imagination, couldn't provide any guarantee about it.
Why was it so difficult to say that word? He had said it a million times before. Hell, he had called Draco worse than that many times.
It was, he supposed, like taking a Muggle drug. It made you high and happy for a while and when the effect disappeared it would leave you feeling even worse than before. Yet, Draco was used to disappointment, wasn't he?
Yes, Harry Potter had found himself wondering more and more about his reasons to come back to Hogwarts.
This time, she was the one who was silent. There was no confirmation needed. They both knew that the Wizengamot was filled with old, bigoted, cowardly, rigid purebloods. Worse, most of them were related to one another, by marriage and blood.
"Harry? Can I come through?" A voice from the Floo, accompanied by his friend's bushy head, broke his rumination.
The question was merely a formality, they both knew that. Draco had been briefed by the healers about her condition.
The Greengrasses were not rich, but they were old, and their reputation was fairly untainted by the Voldemort scandal. The Brookses were said to have hailed from Merlin's own time, and if the wedding of their daughter was any indicator, they were awfully rich. Compared to them, the Radleys were new money. The grandfather had made his fortune through trade and the father, the current member of the Wizengamot, had started from the bottom at the Ministry. Still they were no less influential than the others. In fact, they were a kind of de facto leader for the younger generation in the Wizengamot. If all three of them rejected it, there was no way the others would agree with the proposal.
"I think you misunderstand me, Malfoy. I am not giving you a choice." There was a smirk on Harry's lips. Somehow, no matter how many times Draco had seen it, it still struck him as wrong. There should never be a smirk on Harry's lips.
"Tell me Granger, you have always said that it was wrong to hate Muggles and Muggleborns because their existence and blood status are not their fault. Then, is it Scorpius' fault to be born as my son? Do you know why Astoria left us? She said that she couldn't put up with it any longer, that her father was right, love alone is not enough. It is romantic, of course, but faced with reality of no money and practically being a social outcast..."
Draco was quite proud that he could maintain his usual polite but detached voice. He felt so tired and sleepy and depressed; the only thing he wanted at the moment was for Granger to go home and leave him in peace.
Scorpius. He wished he could give him all the luxuries and privileges he had been given as a kid. Instead, the only thing he gave his son was a family name that would close doors for Scorpius.
It should not be like this, he thought bitterly. They had saved the Wizarding world, hadn't they? They had earned their happily ever after. Or maybe he should just stop being a fool.
She knew, Harry thought. Suddenly, his chest felt heavy and it was hard to breathe, yet at the same time, it felt like a burden had lifted from his shoulders. He didn't need to lie and do things in secret around her anymore.
Afterwards, the dream-world morphed into another where he sat on a throne-like chair on a raised platform. In front of him, there was a Wizard being tortured. He could see his friends, standing on the sidelines, averting their eyes.
Draco lifted one of his eyebrows in response to this strange statement. He couldn't remember a time when he refused his own father's offers either to smoothen his way or clean up his mess.
"And I thought you, Gryffindors, should be the fair and compassionate ones. I was a bully, Granger, not a killer. Even if you are so sure that I deserve it, can you honestly tell me that my mother does? Does she deserve to suffer for her husband and son's sins?"
Even the portraits seemed to have no respect for him. They tended to offer him unsolicited advice – and in both Phineas and Snape's case, critiques – about anything and everything, from his way of handling school business, to his choice of robe that day.
Ginny Weasley was looking up to Potter with adoration, clearly eating up every word coming out of Potter’s mouth. She laughed and held Potter’s hand and Draco never hated her more because it should be him there with Potter.
That was another truth, wasn't it? Even for Harry, who used to be a bleeding heart Gryffindor, even for the man that he had fallen in love with despite everything, he was just a body to be used.
Draco no longer believed that the world would give him whatever he desired. He knew that the other man wouldn't feel the same for him, couldn't even stand him, for that matter. Weren't his current circumstances solid proof of that? Harry would never use any of his friends like he used Draco.
"Maybe Hermione could come up with new ideas. You will never need to do it again, I promise. Maybe we can put up a fund raising event. Just please, stay."
As if Azkaban was the only punishment. As if the world just consisted of ex-Death Eaters and not ex-Death Eaters who lead mutually exclusive existences.
He released her from the hug but kept his arms on her shoulders. She seemed tired, he observed, tired and sad.
"Albus and James are with Molly, and Lily is sleeping upstairs. She is running a big fever. Last night, well, she had that nightmare again."
Fear crept into Harry's heart. Did that mean Hermione knew about the method he employed to pass their proposals?
Scorpius nodded, yet Draco knew he didn't believe a word of it. Still, Draco refrained from saying anything more, choosing to hug his son instead. He could feel moisture invading his own eyes.
And why should he care about an ex-Death Eater? Those so - called-ex Death Eaters, they never changed. Harry knew the ministry should just send them all to Azkaban. If they had, then Ginny would still alive.
"I had thought, once, that after Voldemort was defeated, everything would be all right. Surely the Purebloods would see that blood doesn't matter. Surely the Ministry, purged of Voldemort and his follower's influence, would be a better, fairer institution. I was stupid."
Harry didn't know whether he should sigh or scream in frustration. When he was hunting Horcruxes and fighting Death Eaters, it had never entered his mind that one day there would be an entire generation to whom Voldemort was nothing more than a bogey man, a myth.
Just like he had never noticed how beautiful they were, bags and dark circles and all. He had, he realized, never taken the time to appreciate the body in front of him.
He felt so dirty, tainted, like having grime all over his skin that he couldn't rub out with any potion.
Why couldn't he make anybody see it? He just wanted to make it right. Maybe his methods were not always perfect, but in the big picture, it was nothing, wasn't it? The end, after all, justified the mean.
"Do you know that St. Mungos refused to admit my mother before Potter practically ordered them to do so? Or that Scorpius has been bullied for being a Malfoy?"
Still, if he refused, what would become of his family? Without the money Harry gave him -- for services rendered, his mind reminded him, without Harry's throwing around his weight at St. Mungo, his family was as good as doom anyway.
Harry hadn't heard about him for years, until one day he was suddenly back in England and standing on Hogwarts' door step.
"I don't know you anymore, Harry." There was no anger left on her voice. Her tone was just plain sad.
He couldn't make his parents proud. He couldn't even save them from Voldemort's punishment. He was the worst son there was.
Harry detected a hopeful tone in Malfoy's voice. He could sense that the bravado on display was a fake, though. Malfoy hated to show weaknesses. He thought that showing strength would make the opponent think that you couldn't be intimidated. It was too bad for him that they both knew exactly who was in control. Harry's inner self was cheering.
Malfoy looked like a mess. His eyes were rimmed red and there were dark pouches below them. His skin was paler than usual. Even his hair was limp.
Suddenly, Draco felt angry. How could she demand him to tell her what his game was? How dare she come uninvited into his house, throwing accusations at him!
"Harry? Can I come through?" A voice from the Floo, accompanied by his friend's bushy head, broke his rumination.
The words were said in a confused tone, but Draco knew it was only a front. Dread started to spread inside him. Harry knew, or at least, he suspected something.
Draco was quite proud that he could maintain his usual polite but detached voice. He felt so tired and sleepy and depressed; the only thing he wanted at the moment was for Granger to go home and leave him in peace.
"Don't worry, Hermione, I'll take care of it as usual. Just tell me if anything turns up in your research."
Then there was Astoria. He had loved her. He may not have been in love with her; maybe he loved her like a sister rather than a lover, but he loved her nonetheless.
"No he isn't. He just told me that if I stopped obeying him, St. Mungos would stop helping my mother and my family would no longer have food on the table. Do you think this job is my first choice? Potter was the only one who would hire me. "
Harry was, if he were honest, really curious. As far as he knew, and Malfoy had admitted it as well, Malfoy had neither another source nor prospect of income.
The dream had begun almost like a memory. There he was, dueling with Voldemort. Only then, when he finally killed the other Wizard, the snake-like face changed into his own.
And just like that, he saw her deflate in an instant. The worry lines were back on her face and a haunted look entered her eyes. She put her book on the side table and sighing, took a seat beside him.
Unfortunately, the new Harry was not. Harry used to be the boy hero who saw everything through rose tinted glasses. Only, Draco knew that the rose tinted glasses had long ago been lost and broken. So maybe Harry really did think that ex-Death Eaters were nothing but dirt.
And she wouldn't, would she? They all were so righteous, the so-called-Light-Side, so quick to point fingers, except of course, at themselves.
It had taken the ministry an entire year to decide whether the request was worth presenting to be voted on by the Wizengamot. He had thought that maybe he would have to give them more bribes.
"I tried negotiations, tried to talk, but they couldn't be convinced. They wanted me to be their poster boy; supporting whatever programs they sprouted out. They don't want me to think for myself."
"Tell me, what will happen to your mother if I stop my endorsement and tell St. Mungos to just abandon her, hmm? And what happens to your dear family if you stop earning galleons?"
"And you are saying that you didn't try to sway her to your cause, to make her hate me? Surely you know how easily she is influenced into defending what she sees as the poor and defenceless, regardless of whether they deserve it or not!" Harry practically spat the last sentence. "Tell me Malfoy, why the hell do you work for me?"
"So? That's the only word you can say? What is your game, Malfoy? What are you planning to do? And don't tell me you have no scheme, because I won't believe it."
"Don't you understand what this will do to my family, Potter? This new law you want will doom us! People will accuse us of crimes out of spite and revenge, and they won't even verify the truth before they gleefully cart all of us to Azkaban!"
Draco lifted one of his eyebrows in response to this strange statement. He couldn't remember a time when he refused his own father's offers either to smoothen his way or clean up his mess.
Draco wondered how fucked up it was, that even after everything, he was still in love with his jailer.
Unfortunately, the new Harry was not. Harry used to be the boy hero who saw everything through rose tinted glasses. Only, Draco knew that the rose tinted glasses had long ago been lost and broken. So maybe Harry really did think that ex-Death Eaters were nothing but dirt.
Yet some wanted him simply because he was convenient. They knew he wouldn't talk and he wouldn't say no. His shivering became worse and Draco knew the shivers were not only because of the rain.
"I had thought, once, that after Voldemort was defeated, everything would be all right. Surely the Purebloods would see that blood doesn't matter. Surely the Ministry, purged of Voldemort and his follower's influence, would be a better, fairer institution. I was stupid."
And just like that, he saw her deflate in an instant. The worry lines were back on her face and a haunted look entered her eyes. She put her book on the side table and sighing, took a seat beside him.
Harry shouted out the words the moment he arrived at her house. He didn't give her any time to answer either, opting to envelop her in a hug instead.
"Oh, this is rich. Draco Malfoy loves me. You know what? You really are one fucked up person, Malfoy."
"Why did you come, Hermione? Not that you have to have a reason to do so, you know," he said with a weak smile.
"So, have you thought about it?" There was a mocking tone in Harry's voice. After all, they both knew that viewing the situation as some form of choice was a joke. Harry put the tea in front of the sitting man who was steadfastly looking at the table. His hair hung lank, hiding his entire face from Harry. His posture, which used to be straight and proud, was hunched.
It was a protection for werewolves bitten against their will, which was most of them. It established their rights as citizens, admitted that they were not simply mindless, dark creatures. Harry's proposal demanded the Ministry provide counselors to help families cope with their new situation, a guarantee of employment, and free wolfsbane potion.
"What they said is true after all. This is a Death Eater family," Scorpius whispered, but Draco felt like he was punched in the stomach.
Someday was a word of hope, whispered by familiar voice, filled with unsaid promise of better time to come soon.
"Harry, I told you before that it is our choices that made us who we are. You know, Muggles have a saying that two wrongs don't make a right."
Still, Dumbledore, Harry decided, must be barmy. How could he even begin to compare Ginny with Malfoy? Besides, there was no way he could love Malfoy, not even if he wanted to, which he didn't.
This time, she was the one who was silent. There was no confirmation needed. They both knew that the Wizengamot was filled with old, bigoted, cowardly, rigid purebloods. Worse, most of them were related to one another, by marriage and blood.
Draco had just knocked on the door when he was pulled inside and pushed against the wall by a furious Harry. Harry's green eyes were bright and he put his hands on the wall, trapping Draco inside them.
"Perverted? If any of us is a pervert, it is your precious Potter. Do you think I like it? You can't even imagine the depth of depravity the so-called upstanding wizards can think up when they've got closed rooms and a carte blanche to do whatever they want to do."
Someday was a word of bitter regret and self-delusion, spoken to create an illusion about a tomorrow that would never come.
Then there was that new finding. A Mediwizard who had researched about lycanthropy for years had announced that lycanthropy -- contrary to the old belief -- could come out later in life. It could lay dormant for years, only to be triggered into existence later on. A kid whose parents were infected could be declared normal, only to transform into a Werewolf later on.
An hour after that, he had argued Draco Malfoy's case with the conviction of the newly converted to Minerva. Two hours later, Hogwarts had gotten a new Potion's professor. The next day, Harry had begun to rue that and questioning his sanity.
From where she was, she couldn't see his face and he wore a hooded coat to cover his hair. He knocked at the door and waited for a few moments before it opened to show her the head of Department of Magical Games and Sports, Abelard Raith.
Walking around the table to the blond's side, Harry bent down and captured Malfoy's pointy chin in his fingers. He waited until Malfoy's gaze turned to him before he spoke.
"No comeback Potter?" Malfoy sneered, "I never thought I would see the day you realized your own limited talent in communication and acknowledged that I am, like always, right."
"So? That's the only word you can say? What is your game, Malfoy? What are you planning to do? And don't tell me you have no scheme, because I won't believe it."
For a while, he entertained the thought of going back to his office, but then decided against it. The office was far from sanctuary for him. He had never bothered to re-decorate the place since becoming Headmaster, and never had the heart to throw away what bits and pieces both Minerva and Dumbledore had left behind. The room reflected more of its previous occupants' tastes rather than his own.
The old Harry, Draco knew, would have taken this into consideration. He had read an article once at the Quibbler (not that he wanted to admit it, but for a desperate job seeker, every newspaper was an opportunity) that losing his parents had made Harry consider family as an important thing.
"Oh that. He came to asked me about security plan for the coming Quidditch match." Harry smiled. The lie came out easily.
The room was relatively bare, with white walls and white floor. Once upon a time, Draco knew, this would have been a massive, comfortable bedroom with flower arrangements everywhere from colleagues trying to ingratiate themselves for his parents' favor. Yet the bed in the room was the normal, standard issue of St. Mungos, and the only flower arrangement was the small bunch of roses on the bedside table that Draco had brought with him. At least, Draco tried to console himself, it was a private room.
Why was it so difficult to say that word? He had said it a million times before. Hell, he had called Draco worse than that many times.
That realization shocked him. He couldn't believe it. After all, he never gave any reason for Malfoy to feel that way towards him. Or maybe, maybe Malfoy had nurtured the crush before Harry offered him the job?
Draco had read the newspaper that morning, had known that Harry's Werewolves proposal had been approved. Shouldn't it make him happy?
The fear and anger in Draco's heart seemed to cool down into a lead. And that was the crux of the matter, wasn't it? Harry didn't care, he couldn't care.
Harry would let him take a bath, he knew. Then, they would have sex. Draco wouldn't pretend that it was something else. They would do it fast - no foreplay, no tender whispers. But somehow, the fact that it was Harry's body, Harry's hands, made it somewhat better. Even if it was nothing for Harry but a convenience sex, even if Harry didn't care, he could pretend.
Days like these were by far the worst. Harry had just reached the lowest step of the stairs to his office, when he heard the voices of approaching students.
“We’re already living together,” Harry pointed out. A totally dumb response, in Draco’s not-humble-at-all opinion, but he did not want to break the mood by hitting Harry’s stomach with his elbow.
"And I am grateful for Tinky. But you know that house-elves are inherited, don't you? Just like this Manor?"
She really didn't know, did she? She really was thinking that the Wizarding World had accepted his family back with opened arms. But why should she pay attention to the fate of ex-Death Eaters like him? After all, she was on the winning side.
It was a familiar phrase. Yet, there was anger behind them then, instead of the petulant whine of his Hogwarts days.
She deserved better, Harry thought. She deserved more respect than what she got, she deserved more recognition. She should have risen through the ranks of the Ministry, instead of being lumped with dull, tedious work. She scared the higher ups, he knew, with her tenacity and spirit for change and ability. One day...
The proposal had been prompted by Teddy. Teddy. Just thinking about him brought the pain a new. The ministry had declared him dangerous and taken him away from them not long after the war was over. Harry had tried. Andromeda had tried. Even the Weasleys had tried. Yet nobody could find out where they had taken him, or even if he were still alive.
Draco had thought that something like love surely could bring no shame. He also had thought that there was no way he could feel more miserable. He was wrong on both counts.
If he were to be honest, it gave him a bit of a thrill, seeing the other man like this, miserable and in Harry's power. It had been a year since he found Malfoy and on impulse, decided to offer him the job, but it still felt like a novelty for him.
He could try to find work in Muggle London, he supposed, but he knew nothing about Muggles. He'd had none of their education, and couldn't even operate most of their devices.
"You let me believe that it was your status as Voldemort's slayer that you were using; that and maybe a bit of blackmail that you gathered by digging out their secrets. You never told me that you were trading flesh as well!"
How could Harry ask this of him? Didn't Harry know that by doing this, Draco would virtually hand his family over to Azkaban himself?
"It is the Werewolf Act." Hermione grinned and Harry suddenly noticed that she had a lot of books and scrolls in her arms.
He still could feel the old man's greedy hands pawing at him, his forceful lips at his. He still could hear his mocking voice in his ears.
It was a familiar phrase. Yet, there was anger behind them then, instead of the petulant whine of his Hogwarts days.
"Why did you come, Hermione? Not that you have to have a reason to do so, you know," he said with a weak smile.
"It is not enough, though. I loved Ginny and she died. I loved Teddy and the Ministry took him away," Harry said bitterly, flopping down to sit beside Dumbledore again.
"Hermione. What have you told her?" Harry pronounced Hermione's name slowly, as if Draco wouldn't understand it otherwise.
Walking around the table to the blond's side, Harry bent down and captured Malfoy's pointy chin in his fingers. He waited until Malfoy's gaze turned to him before he spoke.
Harry rubbed his eyes; they were grainy and burned when he blinked. Every time Lily had the nightmare, he ended up with his own sleepless night. The Healers at St. Mungos had said that it was normal for kids to have nightmares about traumatic events in their lives. Kids have great imaginations, and sometimes they could imagine scarier scenarios than what had actually happened. Still, it shouldn't last for two years, should it?
Ginny. His Ginny. The Auror who found her told him that she'd bled to death. Sectumsempra. Her killer didn't want her to simply die, but to suffer and then die.
And he had tried. He had knocked almost every door at Diagon Alley, had applied for anything and everything, including for positions as a waiter or a shop-assistant. Nobody wanted to hire an ex-Death Eater.
She knew he was using blackmail and gathering favors. Hell, she had been involved in some of them herself.
Being friends with her for years helped him to realize that she was beyond furious at that moment. Her eyes were bright and her face was flushed. He rarely saw her worked up this badly.
Harry was going to open his mouth to defend himself, but she stalled it by pressing her index finger to his lips.
"What's the difference? They let the Death Eaters go. They put away those that were infected by Werewolves or even those that they suspected as infected. The Ministry was still practically owned by the same people and groups."
Draco had read the newspaper that morning, had known that Harry's Werewolves proposal had been approved. Shouldn't it make him happy?
"Don't fake innocent now. I saw you with the Head of Department of Magical Games and Sports. He kissed you and called you slut."
It was a protection for werewolves bitten against their will, which was most of them. It established their rights as citizens, admitted that they were not simply mindless, dark creatures. Harry's proposal demanded the Ministry provide counselors to help families cope with their new situation, a guarantee of employment, and free wolfsbane potion.
Harry never knew, before his and Malfoy's agreement, he could be drunk on power. Even killing Voldemort hadn't made him feel like this. He felt hot and excited. He supposed it was like getting drunk on firewhisky, only better and without the hangover.
She didn't say anything and for a moment he pitied her -- her and her feeble attempt to save her rose-tinted world. The moment passed quickly, though.
It was warm inside, and Draco knew that Harry must have sent his children to the Burrow. Harry would have known that Draco would come that night.
When something caught her attention, Hermione could become so animated, hands moving and face glowing.
His mind ran back to his conversation with Dumbledore -- whom he was no longer sure was only a figment of his imagination.
If he were to be honest, it gave him a bit of a thrill, seeing the other man like this, miserable and in Harry's power. It had been a year since he found Malfoy and on impulse, decided to offer him the job, but it still felt like a novelty for him.
"Albus and James are with Molly, and Lily is sleeping upstairs. She is running a big fever. Last night, well, she had that nightmare again."
Simply because he was teaching DADA and had been doing so for the last twenty-something years, Harry was obviously the next Voldemort in-the-making. And, being the Headmaster, he surely wanted to build a Potter army.
The voice felt too patronizing for Harry's liking. It was not the tone of a person who believed. It reminded him of the tone one used to pacify an angry beast that refused to see reason, but was too dangerous to be opposed directly.
Draco wondered how fucked up it was, that even after everything, he was still in love with his jailer.
Harry had said that it would keep the Wizarding world safer, that sometimes, things like technicality and lack of proofs had made it possible for criminals to escape justice. And Harry had argued that once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater. After all, if you could kill once, who could guarantee you wouldn't do it again?
Draco hid his face in his hand. He couldn't believe he just poured out his soul to Granger of all people. Maybe the loneliness had gotten to him. His old friends, after all, either in Azkaban, death, or didn't want anything to do with him anymore.
The old Harry, Draco knew, would have taken this into consideration. He had read an article once at the Quibbler (not that he wanted to admit it, but for a desperate job seeker, every newspaper was an opportunity) that losing his parents had made Harry consider family as an important thing.
It didn't matter that some triggers had to be executed before the dormant infection woke up. It didn't matter that said Mediwizard couldn't even state yet what were the required conditions. People panicked. They were afraid.
He didn't understand. It was not the first time she was looking for him at the office, even if they both preferred to talk at his house. Moreover, he could safely say that that he hadn't seen her at all, so she couldn't be annoyed because of something that he had done. Or was it possible that she was upset because she couldn't find him?
Only after that, did he pick up his book, sit back, and try to restrain himself from looking at the clock every five minutes.
They would stop at Fortescue's afterwards. He never chose the same flavor twice, determined to taste each and every one of them, but Ginny always had a strawberry sundae.
And there was Malfoy, sitting on the floor, looking up at him and telling him over and over, "You are Voldemort, Harry."
The Greengrasses were not rich, but they were old, and their reputation was fairly untainted by the Voldemort scandal. The Brookses were said to have hailed from Merlin's own time, and if the wedding of their daughter was any indicator, they were awfully rich. Compared to them, the Radleys were new money. The grandfather had made his fortune through trade and the father, the current member of the Wizengamot, had started from the bottom at the Ministry. Still they were no less influential than the others. In fact, they were a kind of de facto leader for the younger generation in the Wizengamot. If all three of them rejected it, there was no way the others would agree with the proposal.
Perhaps the old man was right; he had to change before he fell any further. Perhaps it was not too late for him to be happy again.
Harry's comment came unbidden into his mind. Was it true? Would Scorpius be better off with another family?
"But isn't he famous for defeating that Voldemort guy? The books said he's powerful," asked the second one, also in a whisper.
Even after years, the memories of Fenrir and how the Werewolves sided with Voldemort were still fresh in some people's mind, Harry guessed. People wanted the Ministry to put away all Werewolves, dangerous or not. And the Ministry, trying to protect their own interests like usual, caved. To no avail Harry argued against it, citing Lupin as example.
Harry was speechless. He used to make such arguments to defend his actions. He was sure he was right.
A year ago, when Harry approached her with a plan to change the Ministry, a plan that she swore she would not tell Ron about -- not that they didn't trust him, but with most of his family working at the Ministry, it was too risky and too dangerous for him to be involved with plans that were barely legal -- she had thought that he would use his influence as the Boy Who Lived. After all, he had a lot of clout these days.
"Yes, nobody else wants you, Malfoy. After all, you just have one skill, don't you? And it is to open your legs for everyone who pays."
Unfortunately, if the look on Malfoy's face was any indication, he just achieved the opposite. Too late Harry realized that he never smiled at the other man. Malfoy probably thought it was some kind of a trap. Or worse, that, after knowing his feelings, Harry was mocking him.
It had begun as another taunt. If he were to be honest, he had believed that Malfoy had said the truth: he worked for Harry because he had no other option. He had bluffed when he said that Malfoy loved him.
He had, over the years, dreamed about it now and then. He dreamed that he was there and instead of Dumbledore, there were his parents and Sirius and Remus. He dreamed that the train came and Ginny was coming out of it, wearing a big smile on her face. He dreamed that they were all standing at the platform, Ginny and him, James and Albus, waiting for Lily to come home from Hogwarts for the last time.
"But the means to the end also used to be important for you, Harry! Do you remember how Dumbledore always said that love was your strongest weapon? But you are now driven by hatred."
His second guess was that Draco had used some kind of potion to bend the will of his victims. He was still hopeful about finding proof for this one.
"No he isn't. He just told me that if I stopped obeying him, St. Mungos would stop helping my mother and my family would no longer have food on the table. Do you think this job is my first choice? Potter was the only one who would hire me. "
"Of course, Hermione." Harry straightened on the couch and hid away the glass. He was not in the mood for Hermione's lecture.
How could Harry ask this of him? Didn't Harry know that by doing this, Draco would virtually hand his family over to Azkaban himself?
"Look Hermione, what should I do? You know how it was. I had tried to convince the people in power, to argue with them. It didn't work. This works. They get what they want, someone who can be used to realize their fantasies and won't talk about them, and we get what we want, their support for our proposals. And if it failed, there is always blackmail. We can change the Ministry without war."
She didn't say anything and for a moment he pitied her - her and her feeble attempt to save her rose-tinted world. The moment passed quickly, though.
A year ago, when Harry approached her with a plan to change the Ministry, a plan that she swore she would not tell Ron about - not that they didn't trust him, but with most of his family working at the Ministry, it was too risky and too dangerous for him to be involved with plans that were barely legal - she had thought that he would use his influence as the Boy Who Lived. After all, he had a lot of clout these days.
When Neville - after the birth of his first son - had retired so he could spend more time with his family, the position had been left empty. Having replaced Minerva at that time, Harry, in his second year as Headmaster, had called for a meeting, and a vote, for Neville's substitute.
Sometimes, he wished that his family hadn't followed that mad man, that his father had taken a different course in life. He wished that his mother had not gone out alone on that blasted day to Diagon Alley. If she had taken somebody with her, maybe that Muggleborn wouldn't have hexed her and instead of depending on potions, she would be the healthy, determined woman he had known. Most of all, he wished that he was not so powerless.
It made him cold inside, to know that she knew what he was, but he refused to show her that. His pride, battered and tattered as it was, apparently was still alive.
Even remembering it was enough to rouse his anger and self-loathing once again. He couldn't protect her, couldn't even give her justice.
Harry loved the sofa he sat on. It was beige, and comfortable, and modest, and most importantly, they had chosen it together, he and Ginny, when they first moved into Godrics Hollow. He remembered them hopping from shop to shop, looking for new furniture to decorate their equally new home. Harry never knew shopping could be so much fun before that day.
He was not stupid. He knew why they wanted him, each of them. Some were so firmly locked away in the closet, that the notion of wanting a man would send them running and screaming. But Draco looked like his mother, didn't he? After all, he inherited her silky locks and big eyes.
To this day, he heavily suspected that somehow Draco had Imperiused everyone there: for they all had unanimously agreed to place him as the Deputy Headmaster. The only downside to this theory was that nobody had successfully Imperiused that many people at the same time.
Draco recognized the look in Harry's eyes, the one that said that he knew his words were the absolute truth and there was nothing that could convince him otherwise. That look used to irritate him at Hogwarts, since it was the look that also said 'Draco Malfoy is nothing but an evil git and we should foil his plans.' He had learned to admire the look later, when it was translated into 'Voldemort is evil and I will defeat him regardless of the risk' and 'now the war is over we can make a better world.' The second one was a bit too naïve for him, but he did admire Harry's bravery to hope and believe. In fact, if he were to be honest, the look was one of the reasons for his crush. Yet at that moment, he just felt empty.
Someday was a word of promise, spoken in the stolen times on Harry’s cramped, dimly-lit bedroom at Grimmauld, with Harry’s arms around Draco’s torso while Draco was trying in vain to bury his back deeper into Harry’s chest.
"Oh that. He came to asked me about security plan for the coming Quidditch match." Harry smiled. The lie came out easily.
Draco sighed inwardly. To be honest, he had been afraid of this. Kids, he knew just all too well, could be cruel, crueler than any adult in their ignorance. After all, hadn't he been a bully once?
He couldn't make his parents proud. He couldn't even save them from Voldemort's punishment. He was the worst son there was.
Harry knew that if only he could make Hermione somehow understand why he did it, he would have an irreplaceable ally in her. He knew it wouldn't be easy, though.
Even after years, the memories of Fenrir and how the Werewolves sided with Voldemort were still fresh in some people's mind, Harry guessed. People wanted the Ministry to put away all Werewolves, dangerous or not. And the Ministry, trying to protect their own interests like usual, caved. To no avail Harry argued against it, citing Lupin as example.
They had Flooed him earlier, pretending to ask his opinion about one or two trivial problems, in which he had reluctantly responded. His younger self would have believed that they needed his help. His older self, fortunately – or unfortunately – was a little less naive.
Damn that media! He had tried to shelter his kids from the news about circumstances surrounding their mother's death. Only, when you were Harry Potter and even your favorite color was front page material, there was no way around it.
Some days, Harry wondered why he had gone back to Hogwarts. Sure, once upon a time Hogwarts had felt like home for him. In fact, it was the only home he had ever really known.
Ginny. She had been so young, so happy. She wore her hair in a ponytail in those days and Harry loved to play with it while she rested her head on his shoulder.
The dream had begun almost like a memory. There he was, dueling with Voldemort. Only then, when he finally killed the other Wizard, the snake-like face changed into his own.
"Hush, listen. I am not saying that I love you. I am not promising that I will. But, I want to try."
No, he knew the law would do nothing to help kids like Scorpius. On the contrary, letting people put ex-Death Eaters away without a fair trial, both for real and imaginary offences would leave his son practically an orphan.
Absently, he wondered whether his own son had gone to bed. He wanted to see Scorpius, but he couldn't bring himself to go home just yet. He couldn't stand the thought of going home to his family like that, smelling of sex and other men.
He could try to find work in Muggle London, he supposed, but he knew nothing about Muggles. He'd had none of their education, and couldn't even operate most of their devices.
"I can sell myself to Muggles. After all, it seems like it's the only thing I am good for, right?" said Malfoy, bowing his head.
Draco was just coming out of the apothecary, levitating bunches and bunches of potion’s ingredients, when his eyes caught a Harry-shaped person moving from the corner. Harry had not changed. He was speaking and laughing and moving his hands everywhere to emphasis his points at the same time. Then he saw the person standing beside Harry, the recipient of his smiles, and suddenly he could not breathe.
"But the means to the end also used to be important for you, Harry! Do you remember how Dumbledore always said that love was your strongest weapon? But you are now driven by hatred."
No, he couldn't resent her decision to divorce him and go back to her family. He should be grateful that she let him keep Scorpius, although he knew that her father wouldn't want the kid to stay with the Greengrasses anyway, since it could complicate his plan to marry Astoria to another wizard.
Still, on the other hand, it also made it harder for them to control him, since he was not directly under their supervision.
Hermione almost didn't hear those words spoken. It was a crescent moon that night and there were no street lamps around, but she would recognize that whitish golden hair anywhere.
Draco couldn't believe his own ears. She was supposed to be the smartest witch of their year! Moreover, Harry was her best friend and Draco knew for a fact that some of the proposals Harry tried to push through were hers. Couldn't she put one and one together and came up with two?
Harry was speechless. He used to make such arguments to defend his actions. He was sure he was right.
Yes, he was happy. In fact, just that morning he felt ecstatic when he realized that the proposal had passed.
Well, there was a new improvement on the Wizengamot front. Rumour had it that the Greengrasses had agreed to support the proposal. She wanted to ask Harry whether he had something to do with this and to discuss their next strategy with him.
"Rumor has it that the Greengrasses had a kid that had been bitten to death by a werewolf. And the Brookses had been a staunch hater of werewolves. Not to mention the Radleys have a grandson that was turned into a werewolf. He couldn't handle the stress of transformation though, and killed himself three months later. Afterwards, they treated Werewolves as the embodiments of evil. "
Suddenly, Draco felt angry. How could she demand him to tell her what his game was? How dare she come uninvited into his house, throwing accusations at him!
Draco didn't deign to answer him, opening the door instead. What was the use of an answer, anyway? He'd already given his opinion. There was no way he would sell out his family.
Draco had imagined coming home to Scorpius' smiling face. Instead, he was welcomed by a teary eyed kid.
Draco had imagined coming home to Scorpius' smiling face. Instead, he was welcomed by a teary eyed kid.
“Hm, we can live together,” Draco answered, paying more attention to Harry’s fingers, which he was playing with, than to Harry’s question. Harry had shorter, stronger looking fingers -- unlike his longer, graceful ones. There was something about seeing his and Harry’s fingers interlaced that fascinated Draco -- maybe it was the way their skins look together, dark and light.
"So you decided to talk in the languages they understand: blackmail, bribery, favors," Dumbledore said.
"What's wrong?" He kneeled down to look Scorpius level in the eyes. Carefully, he extracted his handkerchief and wiped the boy's tears.
"You are lucky Hermione came to me with news about the werewolf law. It is my main priority right now. I already have one address; I'll find the others soon. Go there and do as usual and I'll give you more time to think about the other one."
Draco wondered what had happened. The last time they saw each other had been two years ago at Ginny Weasley's funeral, and the only thing he did lately was Harry's dirty jobs, which he was under impression she knew nothing about.
"Just take it easy, okay?" Draco smiled and took Narcissa's frail hand in his own. Then impulsively he added, "Don't worry, I'll take care of everything,"
Somehow, this raised Harry's ire further. Subconsciously, he knew that was only a dream, but he felt like he was fifteen again, standing in headmaster's office. It was as if he could feel Dumbledore's disagreement and disappointment through the simple gesture.
