Draco raised a brow. “Sounds like you’re just upset Blaise found someone else to sit with.”
Potter made like he was going to retort but sighed and shook his head instead. Running a hand through his dark hair, he said, “Can you believe we’re still relying on house stereotypes, Malfoy? Feels just like old times. But anyway, Hermione and Ron spent the last few years trying to get me to talk about my feelings, and now that I finally want to, they’re too busy shagging to even notice.”
“We’re happy for you too, Harry,” Hermione said, and when Harry raised his eyebrow at her, she grimaced. “I mean, well, I’m sorry we didn’t react so well. I was just so surprised – I mean there was
"I'm sorry," he rasped, "I'm so sorry."
Malfoy sighed. “Well, whatever it is, I hope it’s strong.”
She gave him a look of amused disbelief, and he raised an eyebrow.
Draco couldn’t disagree with that completely.
“You can’t keep this up, Malfoy. We both know that. You’re
Draco arched his neck back and closed his eyes, lost in the moment. And then Harry went lower, pulling back the neckline of Draco’s sweater and kissing a line across his exposed collarbone.
“I’m fine, I promise,” he said. “More than fine. This is the best I’ve felt in
“Yeah,” said Harry, coming to stand in front of Johnny.
“Wha – Dobby?” Draco looked very lost now. “A cake?”
“Where do you want to go first?” Harry asked Draco as they walked down the snowy path.
When they were in a deeper, more isolated part of the dungeons, Potter released him. Draco rubbed at his arm. When did Potter get so strong? He felt his face get hot, or rather, hotter than it was before.
“Looks delicious,” Harry said, and it did.
Ginny and Luna arrived fashionably late (for what reason, Harry didn’t know) and attracted lots of attention. Apparently, they had still been keeping their relationship on the down-low and used this event to make it public.
"Do you think you could help me get discharged early? I don't -"
Draco tried not to wriggle free; he still felt uncomfortable when Harry touched him there, scared he could feel Draco’s fat. He tried, instead, to relax into his arms and stretched out his own over Harry’s shoulders, linking his fingers behind his head.
There was an undiscernible expression on Malfoy’s thin face, but he uncrossed his arms.
Surprised by Potter’s bluntness, Draco could only nod. He finished chewing and swallowed, trying his best to choose his next words carefully.
“Yeah,” Draco said, pointing to the numbers in the air. “Six-thirty.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Oh? You don’t work today?”
“I’m glad; I hope you can.”
“How have you been?”
He went back to his bed and went through his schoolbag, pulling out the necessary books, parchment, ink and a quill. He then pulled the curtains round his bed shut, making it his own little world.
“I’ll try,” Harry amended. “I’ll stay here as long as Malfoy wants, as long as you want. I don’t – I can’t do this anymore.”
“I thought you’d never ask.”
“I was starting to think you’d never wake up,” came Draco’s voice, making Harry jump.
and I need you to know that – to hear it. Even if you don’t believe it.”
Malfoy did so. Before Harry had gotten used to the feeling, Malfoy had already stowed his wand and turned toward the door. Harry hurried to catch up as Malfoy set off towards his office, swerving to avoid colliding with people who couldn’t see him.
“Well you can’t show your hand
“It’s coming from you, I think,” Ginny said slowly. Her brown eyes met his, and Harry’s mouth went dry. “Harry…”
“Like you’re the pinnacle of normalcy?”
Harry struggled to remember. “Maybe a year ago.”
it’ll never happen, but it wouldn’t be…right to be with you and not be fully devoted to you. But I also truly believe that we’re better as friends. And colleagues, of course.”
Draco took a large drink as well, stopping only when his throat burned. He supposed it was good that he’d had a few bites during dinner, otherwise he would get plastered much too quickly.
He could see the individual eyelashes on Malfoy’s face, how the ends of his teeth were visible with his lips parted like that, how – Harry was suddenly pulled forward and his mouth crashed onto Malfoy’s, those beautiful hands clutching his shoulders. Harry kissed back fiercely, bringing his own hands to touch Malfoy’s face, that gorgeous face. Malfoy’s tongue entered Harry’s mouth, and Harry responded hastily with his own.
“If you say so.”
Harry nodded.
“Lie back down, Potter,” said an urgent voice, somewhat familiar.
“You’re even thicker than you look if you really think there isn’t going to be one.”
Abbott gave another giggle. “Let’s go, Ernie. I think they want to be alone.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t tell anyone. It’s just, you know, I’m ridiculously bored after submitting my new potions in for approval by the Ministry. I’ve nothing to do.”
Harry frowned and opened his mouth to say something when Hermione cleared her throat.
Potter glanced back at him with a smirk, and Draco’s heart leapt.
“Don’t,” Harry said quickly. He hadn’t expected this, and he didn’t know why he was trying to tell Malfoy that he wasn’t a complete prat when that’s exactly what he was. “Like I said, hardly anyone knew, and you couldn’t have known.”
“Malfoy, if you don’t put it in right now, I’ll kill you,” Harry threatened, though his voice was a little too faint for it to be taken seriously.
“Harry?” Draco asked, and he removed his hand. “You’re awake. It was a dream.”
Harry’s head spun around, his eyes unseeing, and then he groaned some more. “I’ve got the worst headache,” he complained as he sat up and picked up his glasses from the bed stand. “How much did we drink last night?”
Draco shook his head and stood.
“What time is it?” he mumbled.
Potter quirked an eyebrow. “What, does he tell
Harry hesitated. Did he? Yes, the sex was incredible, Malfoy was beautiful and snarky and witty and made him feel alive but he was still Malfoy. Was it even possible that Malfoy would want anything to do with him (other than drunken handjobs)?
Malfoy gave a little grunt, took Harry’s arm (
He was sitting so close to Draco that their knees brushed. Draco feared that Harry would be able to smell his awful breath. Salazar, did he look alright? He subconsciously patted down his hair, which was surely sticking up in an unpleasant way.
he forget it? He hadn’t missed it in a while – his absences were worst when he was still having one-night stands and had been too hungover to leave the house.
“Fine, what do you want me to say, Potter? I anguished and tormented myself over all the choices I made during the War? Fine, it’s true. I do. There’s still not a day that goes by where I don’t feel regret, but you know something else? I’ve made peace with it because there’s nothing I can do to change it now, and even if I could, there’s some things I would do all over again if it meant keeping my family safe. Even if it meant taking
“I just got back from talking to Julia.”
"But I meant it, what I said earlier," Harry continued. "That you're not a bad person."
“I rent a flat,” answered Draco. “A Muggle one.”
, Harry thought to himself.
“Yeah, sorry. Something came up,” said Harry dismissively, wanting to leave as soon as possible and get back home before Ginny did. “Look, Johnny, I was just wondering if you had any benzos.”
Draco frowned but nodded.
Harry smiled, that irritatingly proud look on his face again. Draco wanted it gone.
I want my boys to be soft already but it's hard. We're getting there.
They obeyed and hugged for a few moments. Harry took a few deep breaths and closed his eyes, feeling his closest friends wrapping their arms around him. He knew he was loved. He did. It was just hard to wrap his head around. He just felt like such a
“Shut up,” Draco hissed, anger and embarrassment boiling up within him. “You know I’m not above using hexes on you.”
He felt so weak. He was weak and exhausted, and the taste of vomit was bitter in his mouth.
“Did you sleep at all?”
out, remember?”
“Yes, the Headmistress herself,” he said, his grey eyes far away. “I thought it was stupid that I’d gone back to Hogwarts in the first place – I thought it would be useless. NEWTS wouldn’t stack up against – against everything. But I think…with McGonagall’s letter of recommendation and your testimony, I was accepted into St. Mungo’s Trainee Healer program by the skin of my teeth. So I suppose I have you to thank, Potter.”
He didn’t pull down his sleeves like Harry expected him to, but instead left his forearms on display. Harry had trouble keeping his gaze away. It was so beautiful, how something so pure and elegant could come from something so evil. He’d never seen anything like it before. He itched to touch it, to touch Malfoy, but he was sure he’d get cursed if he even tried.
“Sure, who?” Samuel responded.
And finally it was Potter’s turn to be stunned into silence. Draco watched him with apprehension, watching as he processed Draco’s words.
“I hope I’m not – I mean, er,” Harry tried to say. He reconsidered his words. “It’s all right that you’ve been here since Wednesday night, right?”
“Right,” Draco breathed. He exhaled again. “I was just making sure.”
There was no use lying to Luna, or wondering how she knew all these things.
“Shut up.”
“So where
“I fancy you, Draco Malfoy. Not just when I’m sloshed, but always. And, er, I’m hoping you’ll let me kiss you even though I have morning breath.”
“I know,” Draco said again, “But I seem to recall you, well, overshared about your drinking problem.”
“I’m just going to wait for you to answer the question now,” he said stubbornly. It wasn't like he could take the words back, as much as he would've liked to.
“She’s compassionate, intelligent, and genuinely wants the best for her patients,” Draco said. “But you have to put in effort too. You can’t go in and expect to be cured instantly. You’ve got to give as good as you get, Potter, you must understand.”
She hooked her arm through his and they both began walking.
Home. Was the Manor truly home? It certainly didn’t feel like it.
“None for me?” asked Malfoy.
Draco nodded and touched Harry’s arm briefly. “Find me when you’re done, if you want.”
“But if that’s true,” said Harry as something occurred to him, “Why are they doing the cleansing thing?”
“- it’s not Kreacher’s fault she misunderstood,” Kreacher finished firmly.
“Well, no,” said Harry, “But I was just making sure. I don’t want you missing anything, or…”
“I’ll pay you in lunch,” Draco challenged. “How’s
"Oh, the fit Hispanic one, right?"
Harry let out a humorless laugh. “Right. Do I look alright, at least?”
Before Draco could respond, Potter was walking towards the exit and, hopefully, to his bed. Draco smiled a little to himself, looking back down at his wand. He tightened his grip on it. Perhaps this wasn’t as terrible as he thought it was.
“Yeah, I thought it would be,” Leo went on since Draco refused to speak. “No worries. I think some part of me always knew that we were finished for good.”
“Oh?” Ira’s interest was piqued, and Draco was sure that his cheeks
It ended differently than what I had originally planned, and it's also a lot shorter but I hope it's alright.
Though he didn’t quite understand her nervousness around him, he much preferred it to the hatred or fear that some bore towards him.
“No,” Malfoy responded. “I think Dr. Wolff is an outstanding individual and an even better Mind Healer. I’m confident in her abilities and recommend her to many of my patients for good reason.”
“Harry, please just give him a chance. From what I’ve heard, he’s an excellent Healer and very committed to helping you. This whole department is.”
Slughorn chuckled. “Well, either way, excellent job as always! Five points to both Gryffindor and Slytherin.”
“We found an alarming amount of potions in his system,” Draco said apologetically. He hated this part – seeing the faces of loved ones as he explained what had happened. He trudged on. “Some alcohol was apparent as well, though its content isn’t as significant as the potions.”
for him to invite the prat into his room and have him tell Draco about
Draco did so. He looked around and saw little differences within the flat. More magnets on the fridge, a new calendar on the wall, and a new couch.
“Harry…”
Too caught up in his thoughts, he barely realized that Potter had sat him down near the fireplace and was trying to catch his attention.
“Yeah, and now you can since you’re allowed to be near me again.”
A chill ran through his entire body when Potter said his first name. He tried to focus on the context in which he’d said the word instead of the word itself.
“You should probably be getting back to work,” Ron said softly to Hermione.
“Harry,” Ginny said again, softer this time. She touched his arm hesitantly, and Harry thought he felt someone else’s presence in the room. “I’ve – I’ve brought someone.”
“You don’t know that. I’m a bloody Death Eater.”
And then he finally turned to look at Draco, his mouth set in a hard frown. “What was it you were saying? People looking at you with pity and not being able to say anything cos they don’t understand? Seems like you’re doing it now, Malfoy.”
Thankfully, when Potter spoke again, he didn’t sound angry. Just tired. “I thought you weren’t meant to be my Healer anymore.”
They both stood up, and Wolff began escorting Harry to her fireplace when he stopped suddenly. He turned to face her, and she looked at him expectantly.
“Last night,” Ron supplied. “We just went in his office and answered his questions. Erm…was everything alright?”
Another hellish day.
“Yeah?”
"That's alright, isn't it?"
“Have you seen Rose’s dolly? She’s missing it and we think –“
“Loosen up, Draco,” Cait said. “You make a good couple.”
“Christ,” Harry said, and went over to one of the windows. He pulled it open with a grunt, pushing it as far up as it will go. He stuck his head out the window and took a deep breath of clean air. When he’d gotten his fill, he withdrew his head and turned to Ginny. “Could you help me open all of them?”
“Well, you
“Yeah, of course,” Samuel smiled. He thought for a moment before speaking again. “Birthdays are always weird, aren’t they? Sort of bittersweet, sort of…I can’t believe I’ve made it this long. And I really can’t, honestly. It’s great cos I get to hear from people from all parts of my life and y’know, people have to pay attention to me.” This got an understanding laugh from much of the group.
He was restless – good.
Harry’s eyes darted away again, finding their way back to Kathy before Malfoy could catch him staring. She had put her clipboard down and was gazing around the room.
“I mean,” Harry sputtered, “I don’t see how it’s any of your business-“
He chanced a look at Potter; he seemed unsatisfied.
Draco broke eye contact with Hermione to glare daggers at Harry and finally scramble into a sitting position, his pale, scarred chest and marked arm in full view.
Draco straightened his robes and put a hand on Leo's shoulder briefly, causing him to look up again.
“I was
He wanted it.
Harry nodded slowly, feeling incredibly drained.
Potter frowned. He opened his mouth, closed it again, and then said, “And what about the, er, making yourself…y’know…”
“Oh no, they sat in our carriage. That’s the worst part.”
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, clearing his throat. He slid into the booth opposite Malfoy and clasped his hands together underneath the table. “Thanks for inviting me.”
They quickly caught up to Samuel, Damien, and Cait. The two men kept with their conversation, while Cait slowed to walk beside Harry and Malfoy.
She smiled dreamily. “I hope you have the opportunity to engage with Draco soon, Harry. It was lovely seeing you.”
Draco stood and, ignoring Potter, began going as quickly as he could to the bathroom (
"Morning, Betty."
Another twitch.
Potter relaxed and said, “Yeah, er, me too.”
“Well,” Hermione said, smiling to herself, “I suppose.”
What was Potter playing at?
His saving grace had come a few hours later when he saw Ginevra leaving Potter’s room.
He got flashbacks to fifth year when she’d preformed that horrible Bat Bogey Hex on him. Draco cleared his throat.
The last few words choked Harry’s throat as they came out, and then he felt like he may cry as well.
Draco thanked Merlin for Ira and waited until they were both out of earshot before speaking.
“Harry! Draco!” cut in Kathy, aghast. “I am all for getting your feelings and emotions out but this is completely counterproductive and unsuitable for this environment! I suggest you rein it in if you’d like to continue participating in group. If not, I’ll have to ask you to leave.”
“Well I do,” said Draco, “But I’m too tired to do anything about it now.”
When Draco woke up and caught a glimpse of his reflection, he was startled still.
“Except Betty, perhaps.”
“That’s it,” Harry said firmly. He took out his battered copy of
“It’s not the same,” Draco scowled, his irritation rising once more. He took his hand back. “You’re a good person, Potter. You didn’t just murder anyone, you murdered the person who was waging war on most of the world. You
Harry enveloped Draco in a hug as soon as they stumbled out into the house, burying his face in Draco’s neck. He still couldn’t quite place his scent, but it was soothing.
Cait rolled her eyes. “Worry about your boy, not me.”
Potter let out a short laugh.
shagging Harry Potter, then well, color me surprised.”
“Er, I guess.”
He raised his drink and they cheers-ed. There was a silence as they both sipped at their drinks.
“What are you talking about?” Harry growled.
The way he said it - like it was so simple - sparked anger and shame in Harry.
Draco’s face had turned a bit pink at that comment, and then he leant forward to kiss Harry. They snogged open-mouthed and hungrily, their breaths heavy and frantic. Harry wrapped his arms around the other man and pulled him in even closer – if it were even possible – and Draco’s hand found Harry’s cock once more and began stroking it with a newfound energy. Harry bit Draco’s bottom lip and pulled, a moan caught in his throat.
And perhaps other things.
“It’s alright, isn’t it?” Harry asked nervously.
that much – but now, knowing
“Will do.”
“That’s ridiculous. And why are you even talking about it now? We’ve been split for ages.” Draco crossed his arms, feeling supremely uncomfortable. For a horrible moment, he thought that Ira and Betty had somehow found out about what happened yesterday – that confusing moment.
His head swam. He closed his eyes and pressed his palm to his forehead in an effort to stop the world from spinning so much. It didn’t work.
“Well, that’s you, isn’t it?” Draco said calmly, focused on cleaning. “You’re a friendly Gryffindor, determined to be chummy with everyone, house unity and all that, whereas I-”
,” Draco corrected breathily, pushing Harry away and making him stumble back onto his bed.
Though, it was the Malfoy’s space in the first place…maybe that was why Narcissa Malfoy felt more comfortable in her own home. She could pretend that the war hadn’t happened in the first place.
you here for, then, if not for that?” Draco asked.
“This is nice,” Draco said, looking around. “Have you been here before?”
"As you’ve said already," Draco sighed heavily. "I couldn't sleep last night. I might have gotten four hours if I'm being generous. Remember when Harry was here, and he was my patient?"
As expected, Blaise saw right through him and his flimsy half-truth. He advised Draco that if he cared so much about the bloke, he should just go see him, which Draco thought to be some of the worst advice he had ever gotten.
would eat this up, aren’t you?” Draco asked, swallowing tightly and trying to focus. Potter was now swirling disconcertingly above Draco, and it didn’t help matters in the slightest. “It’s not everyday they see their hero playing with a Death Eater’s hair.”
Draco smirked slightly, clearly amused. "Hey? Is that all you have to say?"
He kissed Draco then, gently, holding his breath (for some reason). They kissed for a while, and it was slow, calm, and soft. It made Harry feel lightheaded as usual, and every sensation, every sound, every flick of Draco’s tongue just made Harry drift farther away from earth. Draco was intoxicating – there really wasn’t any other word for it.
He retrieved his glasses and shoved them on as Draco gingerly slid a long-sleeved shirt off its hanger. He watched as Draco got dressed and combed his fingers through his hair. Harry realized belatedly that Draco always wore long sleeves around Hermione and Ron. And come to think of it, had he ever pushed them up in group before?
"Not since March?" she asked, her voice thin.
Harry relaxed instantly, letting out a sigh of relief. “Just – just two. Are they one milligram?”
Harry seemed to be enjoying the snow less. He looked cold even underneath the thick Gryffindor scarf and beanie pulled over his messy curls. His arms were crossed over his chest as they navigated the snow-covered path together.
“Thanks, Draco.”
“Apology accepted, Potter,” Draco said uncomfortably. “It's hardly the worst I've been treated by a patient.”
He hardly registered the sound of footsteps coming up behind him. It was only when he’d stopped long enough to lean against the dirty stall and pant that he saw Potter kneeling beside him, his blurry face etched with worry. Draco gave a weak chuckle and closed his eyes, his head pounding and the taste of vomit strong in his mouth.
“Yes, I know that,” Draco said, looking as though he was trying not to roll his eyes. “I was just making sure that it’s all right that I did – you already had two pints at dinner.”
“Sorry,” he mumbled. He watched as she wiped fresh tears away, her brown eyes red. “I should have warned you before all that.”
“Er, do you mind if I join you?” Harry said, when the other two just sat there in surprised silence.
Harry shook his head. “I didn’t want to be helped.”
This time, Draco didn’t react quickly enough and he became trapped in Potter’s strong arms. Draco froze, having no idea what to do. Potter was
“Yeah,” Ginny agreed, smiling slightly. “He does.”
“I know,” Harry replied, his voice embarrassingly weak.
He felt her nod against his chest.
, not a – a single person.”
He listened to the others who spoke. It was remarkable how often he really resonated with what others were saying. It was strange to think that, perhaps, he wasn’t as alone in his thoughts as he had always believed.
it was like that, just like that, Draco Malfoy was really inside him right now, his skin hot against his own.
“Oh? I thought I was – what was it, incredible?” Draco teased, though he felt his cheeks burn hot as he said the words.
He gave her hands a squeeze, trying to convey how much he appreciated her dealing with him.
having gotten worse. It wasn’t subtle enough.
Leo examined him closely.
“Arithmancy,” Draco said. “And don’t make that face, it’s fascinating.”
“He seems really different,” Hermione began.
Draco’s words brought back flashes of memory. Draco’s – then Malfoy’s – pointy little face sneering at him, just begging to be punched. The adrenaline from the game leading him to sink his fist into Draco’s stomach. He smiled despite himself – fifth year was fucking rough, but there was still innocence and so much
“Oh,” Harry said. “Well, I mean, hardly anyone does, so…”
“What’s it look like?”
No. The chronic nature of addiction means that for some people relapse, or a return to drug use after an attempt to stop, can be part of the process, but newer treatments are designed to help with relapse prevention. Relapse rates for drug use are similar to rates for other chronic medical illnesses. If people stop following their medical treatment plan, they are likely to relapse...Treatment of chronic diseases involves changing deeply rooted behaviors, and relapse doesn’t mean treatment has failed. (NIDA)
The couple relaxed visibly.
After lunch came, Harry decided to take a shower. He felt filthy, covered in sweat and his mouth still tasting of vomit. The mirror tutted at him, and he turned away from his own reflection with a scowl.
“I resent that.”
Estrada, flustered, ducked his head away.
“Thank you,” he bit out.
“Welcome back, Potter.”
Fury and shame rose up in Draco. Why was he hiding on the floor of a loo? He stood shakily and unlocked the door, banging it open with more force than necessary. Potter stood there, much like the way he stood on that first night.
“I’ve been with someone,” Draco forced out.
“Draco, I…” but Harry fell silent, unsure of what to say.
“Nice to meet you too.”
Harry frowned at Draco like he was trying to figure out if he was making fun of him. “I’m not gonna freeze to death.”
“Of course not,” Harry said.
Harry shrugged, chewing on his bottom lip and feeling guilty. “Not much. Watch telly, eat, sleep.”
Potter looked outraged. “A year?”
Draco frowned. “You’ve stopped, right?”
Because it really did sound like Malfoy was asking him out on a date, and Harry
“Er, so, I’ll see you afterwards?” Harry asked, feeling his face go hot but determined to keep eye contact.
Weasley blinked, and Granger gave a kind smile.
“Er, well, I guess not,” he said with a frown. “They haven’t noticed.”
“I love Ginny,” Harry explained quietly, “But the way everyone just expected us to be together was wrong. It felt forced. It was mutual, our split. Ron was mad, saying I was leading her on by breaking it off and getting back together and then breaking it off again. But I don’t think we ever really got together after the war. I was too busy, er, dealing, and Ginny was grieving – their whole family was. But it wouldn’t have worked even if we weren’t struggling, I know it. It just – it just died.”
“Yeah?”
from perfect.”
“Stop,” said Harry, moving to sit next to Draco on his bed. He put a hand on Draco’s own. “You’re being dramatic. We’re both allowed to whinge; it’s not a competition of whose life is worse. And…we’re in a relationship. Two people, yeah?”
“Fuck.”
Harry had never heard Malfoy's voice be so soft, or so vulnerable. The expression on his face amplified it – a hint of a smile playing on his lips, eyebrows slightly raised as if happily surprised and up for a challenge.
“Oh,” Draco said.
“That’s the third time you’ve checked your watch since I’ve walked in here,” Leo said impatiently, “And that was only five minutes ago. What is it? Am I boring you?”
Draco nodded. Fine. It was fine. “It’s embarrassing.”
“You know what,” Harry answered impatiently. He stepped closer. “Don’t play dumb.”
could somehow figure out who’d done it.
“Alright, and?” Astoria asked, blinking up at him.
Ginny stared at him for a moment before sighing.
. It took a moment for Draco to realize that it was scarring. Scars that spelled out the words “I must not tell lies.”
“Yeah, alright, see you next week then,” she replied, making it obvious she didn’t really believe them.
Draco was starting to feel better already.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmm,” Draco said, and took another drag.
This didn’t seem to comfort Harry. He tapped the quill against the table, his eyes glazed over as he looked down at it.
Ginny was now flying for the Holyhead Harpies, and she was happy. He saw it in her eyes when they’d all gather at the Burrow or the two of them would meet up for drinks when she had the time. He still cared very much for her, and he knew she cared for him as well, but their current friendship was much healthier than whatever they had before.
Harry nearly laughed. “That’s not even a question, mate. There’s no way she wouldn’t.”
He cocked his head as he studied Potter’s face. What kind of distraction did he need? Salazar knew he looked tired, though tired wasn’t even the right word for it. His exhaustion seemed to be bone-deep, permeating his entire being.
"Are you ill? Why were you bleeding?"
Draco wanted to laugh – this was the exact opposite of ‘alright,’ and they both knew it.
“Breathe, Draco,” Harry reminded him, squeezing Draco’s hand with his own. It was clammy. “It’ll be fine.”
Draco answered by leaning down and kissing him hard. Harry made a small noise and sat up slightly, Draco moving with him seamlessly. Harry opened his mouth and Draco’s tongue found its way in as they continued to kiss. When Draco pulled back, he was pleased to see Harry enthralled.
“You'll remember again.”
“Abuse?” Harry interrupted, shocked into looking up at Malfoy, who stood, unsurprised. “That’s not – I’m not – that’s mental.”
He made eye contact with Draco then, his green eyes glinting in the light. Draco flushed slightly, his cheeks growing warm. Potter’s smile widened.
“I finally told them,” Harry announced.
“Please, Draco,” Harry pleaded, coming closer to him. “I’m fucking stupid. Forget what I said earlier. Please don’t...”
Once done, Harry gave the parchment back to Malfoy.
"You know I don't –“
Once done, she flushed and smiled at Harry. “There, that’s done. Now, show me all of your Muggle drugs.”
Pansy hesitated.
“God, I haven’t had this bad of a headache since He was still around,” he mumbled.
Draco cursed under his breath. But what was he supposed to do? He couldn’t ignore Harry. He definitely couldn’t say, ‘oh, I’m sorry, I’ve got a busy day of locking myself in my room ahead of me. Go on and enjoy breakfast without me, Potter.’
“You know I didn’t, Malfoy,” Potter said flatly.
“You will Floo to her office at the appointed time,” said Draco, finally sliding comfortably into professionalism. “My office is the closest access point, so you may use it for convenience. But if you have reservations about leaving St Mungo’s, Dr. Wolff is perfectly able to come here and have the session in here instead. I would simply have to let her know in advance.”
“Draco.” Harry stretched his arm out.
?” he asked, emphasizing the last few words. “Thank you for the permission, Pansy. And of course, I was the picture of normalcy before it, so I’m really all better.”
“Oh, hello, Harry!” she greeted brightly, and entered Ginny’s flat like it was the most natural thing in the world.
"Tea, if it isn't too much trouble,” he said as he sat down across from her.
Draco could hardly see Potter afterwards, as he was surrounded by crowds of people, all loud and clamoring. He sat with his parents instead, keeping his head down for the most part. He only glanced up once in a while when people walked too closely by them, or to see if Potter was alone.
’s article about it –
Draco looked at her in surprise; she saw but went on, speaking faster than before.
"We both know you would," Ginny said matter-of-factly. She glared right back at him. "I'm not stupid, Harry, and you aren't either. But this is a stupid idea."
committed to learning what’s necessary for your treatment. And I believe I know enough about you to realize that you are a strong and determined individual. If anyone can fight addiction, it’s you.”
“No, I suppose not,” Draco said. He managed a slight smile, appreciative of his concern. “Thank you, Leonel. I’ll be back for Potter’s cleansing later.”
“Thanks, Pansy,” he said appreciatively, knowing his cheeks had turned slightly pink.
"Let us sit down," she said when she let go of his hand, gesturing to the chairs in the room.
“Harry,” he repeated.
He got out of bed and shoved his glasses on, nerves driving him quickly out of the bedroom. He padded down the hallway and stairs, keeping an eye out for a head of white-blond hair.
with a lazy flick of his wand; there was still plenty of time before breakfast. He took another drag, and thought about how much he was dreading the upcoming day (the usual amount). His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of footsteps that were much too close for his liking.
“Thank you for letting me come, Samuel,” Malfoy said sincerely, looking him straight in the eye. “And again, happy birthday.”
The portrait swung open, the lady in the portrait hardly paying him any mind, and Harry looked back to where Draco was before climbing through. Draco followed nervously, unsure of what to expect.
“It could,” Draco agreed. “But how did Granger and Weasley react?”
“I’m sorry, Healer Malfoy,” Betty said quietly, still not meeting his eyes.
“You in general.”
“Yeah, it is,” he said quietly.
Emboldened by Draco’s words, Harry screwed off the top and took a generous pull of whisky. Draco smirked at the face Harry made afterwards, grimacing and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Oh good, you’re awake,” said Blaise.
“Hi, er, I’m supposed to meet someone here,” Harry said to her, peering back into the restaurant in hopes of catching sight of Malfoy. “Tall, pale, blond bloke.”
Pushing these thoughts aside, Draco continued responding to his mother’s letter. He wrote without pause, only stopping when he got to the final paragraph. Would he be staying at Hogwarts or coming home?
Draco chanced a look at Potter. He really did look handsome, even though his hair was a mess (as usual) and his tie was done sloppily. He was at ease, turned slightly towards Draco in his chair. Draco realized that his own body language was in sharp contrast with Potter’s; he was sitting rigidly in his chair and facing the desk. With great effort, he marginally lowered his tense shoulders.
“What about your mates? What’re they like?”
“You’re welcome,” Draco said, and took a sip of his coffee.
Ron came over, his arms now crossed, and he frowned at the two of them. “Yeah, you will.”
Harry opened his eyes promptly, meeting Draco’s own. “God, yes.”
He was wringing his hands again but this time he didn’t force himself to stop. He looked around the room, his face hot. He’d said too much; he could tell by how the others were looking at him. His eyes stopped on Malfoy, who was looking at him like he’d never seen Harry before.
“Sorry to come so late, Potter, but we’ve got the second cleansing step to complete,” Malfoy said. He nodded towards the new Healer. “That’s Healer Leonel Estrada, who’ll be assisting me. Healer, this is –“
“Have you…ever had a dream about a patient?” Draco asked tentatively.
Harry felt like crying and laughing at the same time and was overwhelmed with the desire to hold Draco and never let go. Draco stared blankly at him, his face white.
“Yes, of course,” said Malfoy, his eyes finding their way back to Harry’s. “Well, are you ready?”
“I know,” Draco said flatly, glancing back at Potter. “I want to.”
“Hey!”
"Come in," he said flatly.
“Alcohol levels are high,” Betty said, her voice high and clear. Her wand was producing a thin, red, vertical line, which she looked at intently.
He felt like he didn’t belong here, like this was all a big mistake, but his mother had pleaded with him.
As the days went on, he had to resort to riskier tactics to continue to get drugs every few days. He didn’t even bother with potions; that would involve the use of glamors and would altogether be too dangerous. In the Muggle world, he was no one – just another bloke who wanted to escape reality for a bit.
have part of an evil fascist’s soul living in them, causing them to have nightmarish visions and the ability to speak to snakes?”
“But – why?” Draco asked, dumbfounded.
Potter shook his head. “I’m fine. Take it.”
“She still cares deeply for you, Draco,” Astoria told him.
“Good,” mumbled Harry, glasses now on.
He began writing a letter to his mother, starting by saying he’d gotten his old wand back from Harry Potter so he no longer had need for hers. He hadn’t told his mother that his relationship with Harry had developed the way it had. It was strange, really, given how he had always been close to her and liked telling her things. Something had changed, of course, during the war, but he’d almost gotten used to writing her about every little thing once more.
He wanted to run. That was Draco’s first instinct. Run like a bloody coward – Potter was right about that – in that moment, that’s all Draco wanted to do. It was almost like Potter had sensed it, for he took this moment to turn back round. He crossed his arms tightly and looked at Draco, a bitter smile on his face.
“There’s no need to be so melodramatic, Potter, you’re not going to
this, Harry,” Hermione said firmly. When Harry rolled his eyes, she continued, her voice stern. “You need help. And some part of you knows that. Why would you have come here otherwise?”
If Harry had the energy to turn back and look at him, he knew that Draco would be wearing the most infuriating grin. So he didn't turn back. He just panted into the sweat-damp sheets.
“And where did you come up with that idea?”
Draco smiled as he and Harry parted; Harry was looking adorably sheepish. He rested a hand on Draco’s thigh, and this time it was Draco trying to hide a smile. Remembering Pansy, he looked up with what he hoped was a neutral expression on his face.
The crisp air greeted him sharply as he stepped outside. Shivering, he withdrew his wand to cast a warming charm on himself. It helped marginally.
“Of course,” Draco said. He took the items and watched as Harry pulled off a heavy black coat and hung it up on Draco’s coat rack. “Please, make yourself welcome. Kitchen is through here.”
“Morning,” he said kindly enough.
Draco blushed deeply at that, though he didn’t believe it for a second.
Me: 0
Draco closed his eyes and was asleep within minutes.
Samuel was nodding, a soft smile on his face.
“Thanks,” Harry smiled.
“Lie back,” Draco told him, and Harry obeyed immediately, feeling shivers run up his spine as Draco straddled him.
As he came up the steps, the door opened and a man came outside, a curious look on his face. As his eyes adjusted in the dark, he squinted at Harry and stepped forward.
"What? Of course I am."
Harry blinked.
him. It still boggled his mind. He didn’t think it would ever make sense.
“Never mind. My point was that it’s really boring in here and I appreciate the company.”
“No, thank Merlin,” Draco sighed.
Draco managed half a smirk as he eyed it. “Can you trust me with it?”
Draco’s grey eyes flickered to where Kreacher had stood before they went back to his soup. He swallowed another spoonful before answering.
Samuel looked at Harry, something telling him that he wasn’t exactly convinced.
“Draco? Are you awake?”
“Good afternoon, Healer Malfoy,” said Leonel, glancing up briefly at him and Betty before focusing once again on the patient. “I’ve just administered a basic antidote until we figure out for sure what caused it. I also cast a stabilizing charm on him earlier so his condition doesn’t get worse.”
Harry was aching for him and did nothing but fight him on it.
She continued to guide them until they had taken a total of four breaths. Harry opened his eyes prematurely. Malfoy sat there, eyes closed and back straight as he breathed. Harry didn’t think he had ever seen Malfoy look so peaceful.
And was Draco thinking the same thing about him? Was he wondering why the great Harry Potter wasn't doing anything with his life except attending a Muggle group to whine about his woes? Or why he was confiding to a bunch of strangers who didn't know him as Harry Potter but instead as Harry, even though he had a wealth of friends who actually knew about magic?
There was a sharp intake of breath as Draco kissed back hard, his hand moving to grip Harry’s bicep. Harry deepened the kiss and soon it was all open-mouthed and desperate and Draco was so warm against him and had he ever felt anything so perfect in his life?
Draco nodded, his anxiety tightening its hold on his heart.
Harry listened, enraptured, able to tell just from Malfoy’s voice how much he cared about his work. Harry felt a twang of jealousy at that, wondering what it felt like to be that passionate about something. He watched as Malfoy’s expressions changed as he spoke of the different cases he’d had over the past week.
“It really has been a while, hasn’t it?” Malfoy asked smoothly.
Harry’s heart sunk. “Oh. Well…I try not to look at the
“Never mind,” Harry grunted. “Get back to the other thing.”
Draco looked him up and down; he didn’t seem to be doing poorly, rather, he looked the same as ever.
“You’ll get it back once you’ve completed treatment,” Malfoy said, his voice calm once more.
“Thank Merlin,” Draco breathed. His fingers found their way back to the oval scar on his chest. He didn’t know what about it had intrigued him so much. It was so perfect, so round, so clear-cut. And it was hidden. He couldn’t imagine many people could know about it. He wracked his tired brain in an effort to remember what Harry had said before. “What’s a Horcrux?”
Draco tried to swallow but the lump in his throat didn’t allow it.
“Malfoy, apparently.”
“Don’t be,” Potter said, and kissed him again.
“You’re very important to her, Harry,” said Hermione, frowning now. “She’ll always care about your well-being.”
Something about the nervous way Potter said it, accompanied by those wide green eyes made Draco’s heart skip a beat.
“Come on. It’s getting late.” Harry stood and extended a hand down to Draco.
“So?”
He looked around as soon as he had materialized back in the flat, his heart thudding as he did so. Once he was satisfied Ginny hadn’t come home yet, he began looking for a good hiding spot.
Draco licked the entire length of Harry’s cock in one, long go before taking him in his mouth. Harry made a noise that sounded a bit like a strangled gasp; Draco sucked lightly, moving his mouth up and down Harry’s cock slowly. Harry’s hands were grasping at Draco’s shoulders now, and Draco used more pressure, knowing by now what Harry wanted.
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say, and so he didn’t.
“Didn’t you use to go to school with Harry Potter?” Leonel asked, interrupting the silence.
“39.6°? That’s…what, about 103° in Fahrenheit? Christ,” muttered Estrada. “Betty, could you go get me a Fever-Reducing Potion?”
"But that doesn't mean we can't fuck anymore."
The light that was spilling in from the living room was accentuating one side of Draco’s face, emphasizing his sharp cheekbones and thin nose. His eyebrows were drawn together and even in the darkness, Harry could tell that he was looking guiltily at Harry. His heart dropped.
“It’s lucky for you, though, isn’t it?” Draco asked, his voice velvety.
“What are you doing –“ Draco exclaimed in surprise.
"You lot are living relatively normal lives," Harry said incredulously. "I mean, as far as I know, you've got careers and family and partners –“
, I couldn't even think. I couldn't do anything. That was the first and only time in my life that I'd been so shaken I couldn't even move. I didn't know what I was supposed to do without you. Forget about the world and Voldemort, what about
“He’s still a prat,” Ron said defensively, “But he’s not that bad. And it’s not like we went out looking for him, he just came along with Ginny and Blaise one day and we happened to get on…”
Draco pushed Harry back onto his bed (Harry clumsily kicking off his shoes as he went) and kissed him hungrily, an impatient noise emerging from his throat. Draco took out his wand and cigarettes one-handedly, and retrieved Harry’s wand as well. He tossed them all in the general direction of Harry’s bedside table; he could get them later.
“It doesn’t have to be, I don’t think,” he said carefully. “I mean, we actually got on alright, didn’t we? For a bit? Until I, er, buggered it all up.”
His eyes were a brilliant green, shining even in the dimly lit corridor. Draco’s heart fluttered as he admired the man in front of him, still barely believing that he was
“Right,” Draco said. He cleared his throat. If he didn’t say it now, he feared he never would. “Still, I’d like to apologize to you both for the way I treated you. There’s no excusing the things I said and did, and I feel terrible about it. I hope you can find some way to forgive me someday, but if not, I understand completely.”
“You get the point.”
“Thank you, Betty,” Draco said, and she beamed at him.
“That’s the second time you’ve called me sweet,” Potter’s voice said, sounding both smug and bewildered.
Her Patronus scurried off, and Harry was hit by a pang of nostalgia as he watched it. It’d been years since he’d seen his stag.
“Oh,” Harry said, and it all made a little more sense.
I’ve got to move on. But whenever I have to go back to that house, when I have to have tea in a place where those things happened – it just brings me right back. It just sort of feels like…I’m taking one step forward and two steps back.”
"I'm a fucking Death Eater, Harry.”
, like Draco had
Draco stumbled just a bit.
“Officially, today, I reckon,” Harry answered, frowning over at Draco. He nodded in agreement. “But we’ve been er, involved for a little longer.”
Draco just rammed into him harder, meeting Harry’s need to be filled.
Harry thought for a moment.
He pulled back and tugged Harry’s shirt off roughly; Harry took off his glasses and tossed them onto the couch they’d brought from Draco’s old flat. Draco ran his hands up Harry’s torso and chest, reveling in the smooth skin and dark hair that lightly coated his chest.
"We've got to move on."
“I know about being hungry,” Potter said flatly. “I grew up hungry, and then I had to go hungry all over again last year. And considering how much you eat and, well, don’t eat, I know for a fact that you are.”
, and is also someone I know.”
Harry gave an
Ira beamed as Betty nodded enthusiastically.
Potter’s eyes widened slightly before he said in a tight voice, “Thought I was going to get a new Healer.”
He suddenly felt sick to his stomach. Draco pushed his plate back and stood. Pansy and Blaise looked up at him, the former slightly alarmed.
“Even with a cleaning charm these clothes are filthy.”
“Because we’re such good mates, Potter?” scoffed Draco. “Which reminds me,
Draco took another drag, hating himself. He couldn’t believe Potter was somehow always present during his weakest moments. Potter just had to be there to see the worst of him. Draco wanted to go, to run away, to never show his face in front of Potter again.
“No,” Harry said again, but this time, his eyes snapped open.
Both Harry and Malfoy watched them leave. His eyesight caught on Malfoy – he was watching him with a somber face, making Harry feel even more uncomfortable than before.
“Oh,” Draco said. He’d done accidental magic when he was a child too, but he didn’t think he knew anyone else who did it past the age of eleven.
Harry sat up a little straighter, feeling the pain in his body melt away by the second.
Draco scoffed. “It means that you’re a Gryffindor, and the Chosen One to boot. Saving people may just be in your blood.”
It didn’t feel real. After all these years of harboring a secret affection, something had come of it. Harry returned these feelings. Draco couldn’t understand why; he wanted so badly to ask
“Draco,” Harry said softly, his eyes locked on Draco’s. “Put your wand away.”
“So who is it?” Hermione asked, throwing a look at Ron.
“It’s still fucking weird,” Harry couldn’t contain a short laugh. He finally opened his eyes and met Draco’s glare. “You put in loads of time to make them. Did you make them yourself, or did you get people to help you?”
Draco took another drag.
Draco continued, and he felt one of Harry’s hands grasp at his hair. Harry tugged, and Draco gave a muffled noise of surprised pleasure. Draco went on doing that thing Harry liked so much, and Harry’s fingers twisted in his hair. He felt Harry’s body tense further.
"Ron, Hermione, I have to tell you something," Harry began, and he already felt his heartbeat thudding in his temples. He exhaled, though it didn’t help much. "It's about Dr. Wolff, sort of."
“Come on, Hermione. He’ll be fine. He always is.”
Though his tone was sharp and he’d made a face as he said it, Harry’s words somehow sounded sincere, much more than they should had. Draco frowned a bit, but before he could respond, their waitress approached and set their food down in front of them. Harry thanked her and she walked away, and Draco was still oddly touched by what Harry had said earlier.
He fled.
He inhaled sharply as Harry inserted a finger into Draco.
God, Draco was so unbelievably beautiful. All sharp lines, pursed lips, and calculating grey eyes, it was a wonder Harry hadn’t jumped him already. And the bastard
“Well,” began Hermione excitedly, looking over at Ron who was smiling like nothing could ever go wrong in the world. “We were just talking about work over breakfast – the most common conversation, really – when suddenly he knelt down and asked me! I was so surprised.”
“Yeah, just, y’know, personal things. What I mean is, it’s not awkward since she’s…?”
Trembling, Harry shook his head.
Leo frowned. "Sorry, Draco. I just - I think I'm over you, but it's obvious that I'm not and…I don't know what I'm doing. You’re just so…"
“No more than usual,” Harry said plainly.
Blaise raised an eyebrow. “If it’s Potter…”
“No, no, she just explained what being aromantic means,” Harry said, meeting Draco’s suspicious gaze. “It’s really interesting; I never even knew something like that existed. I guess I just always assumed everyone experienced romantic attraction…”
“Very well,” he said, his voice finally back to normal and easing Harry’s tension. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go ahead and contact Dr. Wolff.”
“There,” she said severely once it was fitted snugly in a top shelf, “Now you won’t forget where it is to be returned.”
“What? What is it? Do I have something on my face?”
“This is nice, Draco,” Harry told him appreciatively, his green eyes once again sweeping the room. “That one’s vanilla, the other mocha. Hope you like one of them, I wasn’t sure what to get.”
Draco gave a ragged gasp as he drew out and back in again, his hands gripping Harry tighter than ever.
Draco met Harry’s gaze again and rolled his eyes at the other man’s cocky grin.
“You look good,” she said finally, releasing his wrist. Her lips quirked into a smile as she met his gaze. “I’d bet a galleon that you never tried this hard when we were dating.”
Leonel’s superior, after all. Even though they hadn’t breached their employment contracts, Draco knew very well that dating one’s junior wasn’t his smartest decision.
“Malfoy?” Harry croaked, throat aching from lack of use.
“But now you
,” Draco admitted, daring to meet Ira’s eyes for a second. They were frowning. “I shouldn’t be feeling this way for a patient.”
Hermione pulled up a list of links, showing them to Harry as she nervously explained what she’d been doing. She had found different resources for those suffering from mental illness.
“Who else - ?”
“Huh?”
“Well-said,” Draco said, and snuggled up against Harry. “I want to go back to sleep now. Will you let me?”
He wanted to stand up and walk away, but he still felt a bit too wobbly to do so. Potter already knew this and studied him, looking him up and down. Draco flushed just a bit at the intensity of his gaze.
Draco opened his eyes and craned his neck to look up at him. Harry was grinning.
“Of course I know,” Draco said earnestly, his eyes trained on Harry. “I – I trust you.”
He stopped only when the waitress came back and set their waters down on the table. The two men ordered their food, and they were alone once again. Harry swirled the straw around in his glass, watching the ice follow its uneven path.
he was staying for the holiday.
Potter looked at him – for real this time. His expression was serious.
“Unbelievable?” Harry smirked.
“Alright,” he said. “Right. I suppose I believe you.”
"What are you doing, Malfoy?" Potter asked slowly.
They noticed.
“I’m assuming you won’t tell me what’s upsetting him,” Draco said, trying to push the inappropriate thought away.
He tumbled into Wolff’s office a few seconds later, bringing soot in with him. Harry stood and brushed himself off, then looked up.
“Stop it,” Potter said sharply. “That’s not who you are.”
“Why won’t you join them?”
a fool, aren’t you?” Malfoy said smugly.
“I started again on Halloween,” Harry admitted quietly. Malfoy was silent, and Harry glanced up at him. Bitterly, he said, “I’m sure you know enough Potter trivia to understand that.”
went doesn’t mean I need to. I’m just stronger than he is.”
Draco cocked his head and Merlin help him, Harry wanted to kiss that confused look off his face. “It was a compliment.”
Harry did, but he’d only taken a few steps into the main dining floor when he caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s hair.
“Healer Malfoy, Potter,” Malfoy said, confirming his identity.
“Good,” Draco murmured. “I’d like to check your vitals.”
“What time do you reckon it is?”
He groaned. Why’d he have to say anything in the first place? He could’ve just kept his stupid attraction bottled up and never had spoken a word of it. Malfoy has always had a talent of getting under his skin, knowing exactly which buttons to push to best rile him up. And it didn’t help that his temper had just grown shorter and shorter over the years, rivaling that of his fifteen-year-old self.
“You’re the one in my bed, mind you.”
“Alright,” Draco conceded. “But lack of hatred isn’t the same as caring for someone.”
"God yes Draco harder please," Harry was only half-aware of what he was saying but that didn't stop him. Draco's cock was thick and warm and filled him up so completely -
The image of Neville's parents flashed in his mind.
“Fine. Great.”
“Maybe they should,” Draco grimaced. “Well, not bite. Just…get angry. Maybe Granger can slap me like she did in third year. Or maybe punch me. I think that’d be better than this.” He gestured vaguely.
“Yeah, I know, we’re
“Two months,” Luna chirped.
“You then quit training mid-2000, and began taking additional potions around 2001. This then takes us to spring of 2004 – last year – when alcohol also became a prominent part of your life. Is that also correct?”
cared about you,” said Potter, but Draco didn’t believe it. “I
did Granger have such horrible timing?
This time, Harry did spit out his drink. It dribbled pathetically down his chin and onto his shirt. Harry grabbed some napkins and dabbed at the front of it, his mind still on the ridiculous question Malfoy had just asked.
"Then perhaps we shall start with why you are here in the first place," she prompted patiently.
He didn’t agree with that, but he stayed silent. He returned his attention to the professor.
Harry’s pace quickened and his grip slackened; Draco opened his eyes.
Draco chose to ignore this. “So you really don’t care in the slightest that your ex-girlfriend just slinked away with a dirty Slytherin?”
“This was a mistake,” he said aloud, softly enough so only Pansy heard.
“He’s taken, mind you,” Draco said, glaring at him.
Granger leaned against Weasley, her hands covering her face. Weasley put his arm around her, as if they could get any closer, and kissed the top of her head. She looked up at him with watery eyes.
Pansy’s words shook him out of his thoughts, and he looked sideways at her.
Harry looked sheepish then.
Harry glanced over at Ginny, whose freckled face had become rather red.
“I highly doubt that,” Draco said lowly. He ran a hand down Harry’s back, resting it on Harry’s arse. His breath was hot on Harry’s neck, and Harry shivered again.
“Oh yeah. A completely unexpected, two-minute-long visit right when I was just about to suck you off,” Draco nearly growled. “It was
“Good, let’s head over there now…”
“What made you want to use again, Harry?”
Harry still felt like a massive failure despite Malfoy’s words, but he didn’t tell him this. Malfoy’s eyes were sad now, and it tugged painfully at Harry’s heart.
“Good morning, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said briskly. She looked around at everyone. “If my memory serves, this seems to be our entire party. I thought I would echo Albus and create a more intimate setting during holiday since there are so few of us.”
“How long did that take, by the way?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow. “I’m genuinely curious.”
Though, according to the way Hermione and Ron glanced at each other, it wasn’t.
so much, and yet was so much more than all of that,
“That hasn’t happened in a month, and anyway, I can handle myself.”
“No no no,” Draco said hurriedly. “I’m not. It’s just hard to believe, that’s all.”
“Right.” Draco sat down at his desk and took out Potter’s file. He looked up at Granger and Weasley, who both seemed rather reluctant. “You can begin anytime you’d like.”
“…Is Harry still sleeping?” came a voice, possibly Longbottom’s.
“Alright, you lot?” Cait asked with that clever grin. Her eyes were shining.
Draco wasn’t surprised – this was clearly a sensitive topic and not to mention, had to do with Potter.
Harry could see the pain in Hermione’s and Ron’s eyes, but he pushed forward, needing to get it all out. If he didn’t do it now, he feared he never would.
Leo opened his mouth to argue when Betty and Ira returned.
This sobered them up rather quickly.
Slowly getting happier with how this is coming along, though it still reeks of 2014.
“He’s got his Mind Healer, doesn’t he?”
He tore himself away from the mirror and wiped his hands and face dry.
“Well, that’s fine too, then! So we won’t take it as slowly as we ‘should’ – so what? We’ve done everything else correctly, we waited a year, you’re not my Healer anymore, I’m in a good place, a really good place now, and I
Draco shook his head. “You’re all set. Thank you, Leo.”
“What? How?”
The silky way his name slid out of Draco’s mouth went straight to Harry’s cock, and he sucked harder, deeper, wanting to give Draco every bit of pleasure possible. This just made Draco demanding; the hand in Harry’s hair now took hold of the back of his head and forced Harry down on Draco’s cock. Harry nearly gagged on the force and surprise of it but quickly recovered, up for the challenge. He took Draco whole and sucked hard, making Draco writhe and moan deliciously.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Any relation to the Burke of Borgin and Burkes?”
“Like what?” Draco asked hesitantly.
"You look horrible," Ira had said once Draco had entered the break room just moments after Betty had left.
“No,” snapped Draco. And then, feeling bad, he grumbled, “Thanks.”
could avoid getting tortured, so
Draco had his arms wrapped around Harry’s waist, their hips grazing together.
makes it sounds like he should’ve gone. I just – helped him. He didn’t deserve to be locked up in Azkaban. Nor did his mum.”
“You could learn the spell yourself – or better yet, learn how to eat like the grown man you supposedly are.”
"I'm getting close."
is too much?”
“You’d like to engage with him again?”
“If that’s all for now, I’ll take my leave, and someone will be back to check on you later tonight.”
"Malfoy."
They’d hardly seen each other all week, so when they parted, Draco looked him over hungrily. Harry looked a little tired, but fit as ever.
“You keep telling yourself that,” Ginny smirked.
"And you were both drunk and high that night?"
“I’m going…I’m going to get better. I really will, this time,” he said, his throat tight as he hugged Hermione back with all his strength. “I swear.”
“Good afternoon, Potter,” said Malfoy as Estrada set down potions and other miscellaneous items. “I understand you had a bit of a fever this morning.”
“You need help, Malfoy?”
Harry half said 'come on,' and Draco followed Harry up the stairs.
“What?”
Wolff sat down in her seat across from Harry. He couldn't easily identify her age; she could have been anywhere from 35 to 45 years of age. Her face was lined faintly, and there were grey strands of hair in between the hazelnut. Her brown eyes were soft as they regarded him.
Draco’s mind and gaze wandered over to the Gryffindor table across the Hall; this was second nature to him by now. Potter’s demeanor was still relaxed; he was listening enthusiastically to his classmates, all smiling and laughing as if they hadn’t just been involved in a war.
"Come off it," Harry said, "Kathy's nice."
Walking into the room was a man Harry hadn’t seen since he was eighteen years old. He didn’t look much different; he had the same pointy features, pale skin, and white-blond hair. But his hair
“But what good is it if we can’t
They nodded and thanked her, and Mitchell left. The three of them were quiet for a moment before Hermione took the smallest step forward.
“There’s no need to thank me, Weasley,” Draco said, finally collecting himself. “I…care about Harry, even if doesn’t always seem like it.”
“It’s…who you think it is,” Draco said when he’d gathered the nerve. “It’s Potter.”
“So sorry. Next time I’ll try harder.”
“Oh! Hello, Healer White and Healer Malfoy,” she greeted brightly.
“Hey,” Harry said. He nodded at the now empty seat next to Draco. “Can I sit?”
Harry nodded.
“Draco, just – fuck me.”
She flushed a bright pink, the color obvious against her pale skin.
She was beaming, however, and staring at Luna like she was her entire world.
“Wait, Potter.”
Though he was covered in a thin sheen on sweat, his hair a complete mess, and his lower neck was littered with bruises, he looked…happy. Relaxed, even. It felt like a huge weight had been taken off his shoulders, and he owed it all to Draco Malfoy. Rotating so he could see his back in the mirror, he grinned at the red scratches and even redder patch on his arse. He owed that to Draco, as well.
“So you’re, what, going out?”
Draco laughed for real this time, reminded strongly of the Potter he’d known before. Leave it to Harry Potter to take something like this as a challenge. Draco had goaded him into it, and Harry had taken the bait immediately and run with it.
“Draco…”
And Merlin bless him, he actually looked surprised.
It’s true; Harry had been purposefully evasive. Relationships were about giving and getting, right? One person couldn’t just work for it. He’d learned that from Ginny.
Harry nearly laughed from the absurdity of it all.
Seventh year was when he was mostly shell-shocked by what had happened - what he had done and what he had almost done. He didn’t know if being at school or being at home was worse at that time (just like now). He was surrounded by other Death Eaters either way, and both places served as forceful reminders that he, too, was an active Death Eater.
“That sucks.”
“I just figured I’d ask,” Blaise shrugged. “But good for you. Merlin knows you’ve spent much too long whinging after him.”
. What about those words do you not understand?" Draco growled.
“I’ll be gone in two days,” Harry mumbled. “How are you going to monitor me after that?”
He needed to do more, needed to reciprocate.
going to cry, he wasn’t about to do it in front of other people. His legs worked automatically, taking him to the first place he thought of when he thought “privacy.”
“No!” Harry exclaimed. He sunk a little bit in his seat and stared down at his lap, mortified. “Since last month. October. It’s really only been a week.”
“I reckon there’s lots you don’t know about me, Potter.”
“What about…” Draco snapped his fingers. “That new bloke in your department?”
Potter hesitated, and Draco raised his eyebrows.
Harry scowled and didn’t miss the inquisitive glances from his friends.
"Oh, Harry, when?" Hermione asked, moving closer to him. "How?"
“You were gone for a while.”
Draco knew he was right.
“Likewise,” Samuel said. His eyes were very brown, and Harry found them to be warm and inviting. Samuel bit his lip and cocked his head. “I don’t mean to be rude, but are you South Asian?” When Harry blinked, he continued. “That
Harry laughed. “Right.”
“I’m what?” Draco asked, trying to keep his voice calm as his heart thudded loudly in his ears.
“Oh good, that’s reassuring.”
“Being in her office still reminds me of when I was…seeing her,” Draco admitted. He didn't think he’s ever told someone that before. “It’s ridiculous, but –“
“I hope you like it. I’m not much of a cook,” Draco confessed.
them. They were so obsessed with normality and their shitty suburban life that they treated me like shit.
“Look, you’re doing your job. You’re a Healer, and you’re helping him as best you can to get healthy. You haven’t made any advances – that I know of, at least – so you certainly haven’t crossed any ethical boundaries. Just keep doing what you’re doing and you’ll be perfectly fine.”
“You’re welcome.”
“Cos I sort of just barged in here and interrupted your morning.”
Malfoy was also apparently remembering where he was – his face was slowly going back to its usual expressionlessness mask. Harry looked around, thoroughly embarrassed, seeing the shocked (and a few excited) faces of the other group members. Samuel, next to him, was staring at him with wide eyes.
When he
Draco made an undignified noise in response and his hips bucked – Draco was certain Leonel had felt his erection by now.
"But also angry. You and Ron can't really understand, but Hermione does."
Draco shook his head. He had made bad decisions all on his own. Nobody forced him to be a cruel teenager, a downright foul person. He was terrible before he even took the Mark. He couldn’t just blame it all on the Dark Lord.
It was Saturday morning, also known as the time they all had breakfast together at Ron and Hermione’s flat. They hadn’t had a chance to see each other since Harry attended group for the first time on Wednesday.
Draco sighed. Potter always did have a penchant for driving him mad.
"No I'm not," he responded, his voice faint. "I'm a - a wreck, a disgrace, I’m pathetic and disgusting -"
Harry considered this for a moment before firmly deciding that no, he felt way too poorly to go outside. He told Ginny this, and she nodded understandably. She pulled on her coat, told him that she’d be back in about thirty minutes, and was gone.
“I’m – fuck,” Harry muttered, removing his glasses to rub at his eyes again.
It was him, after all, who was too scared to draw attention to himself, especially near Harry. These bitter thoughts didn’t leave his mind, but bounced around in his head, taunting him.
“What is
He watched her walk away, then looked at Malfoy.
He did actually feel a little bad about that last thought, but still. It wasn’t like he
Leo was right, wasn't he? Just because they weren't dating didn't mean they couldn't fuck. People did it all the time - casual sex, no strings attached.
He avoided eye contact with the two of them, silently cursing himself for his stupidity and the way alcohol made him forget himself. It was obvious, however, that Betty and Leo would not be ignoring everything he’d just said, and Draco briefly considered Obliviating them.
His back arched, overwhelmed with pleasure, and Draco just sucked harder – Harry could imagine those shining eyes, deliciously malevolent and guarded and
Many people were nodding solemnly. Harry tentatively reached out and placed a hand on Samuel’s shoulder. He turned, and seeing Harry, smiled slightly.
"How much longer have you got over there?"
When no one else did, Harry stood up shakily. He grabbed the bag (his hoodie
Harry scoffed loudly, both at them and his own idiocy.
Malfoy studied him for a moment longer before taking his leave. A minute later, Ron and Hermione reentered.
“She mentioned going on a date about a month ago,” Hermione explained, “And she’s got a bit of a glow now.”
“Potter.”
“Doesn’t matter,” said Draco. He pulled Harry over to him by his cloak and undid the clasp. “I’m just glad they didn’t see this; I don’t think I would have survived if you had to take time to discuss that, too.”
“They make them childproof,” explained Harry. “You’ve got to press down and turn.”
“Right,” he said sheepishly. “Sorry.”
Malfoy’s breaths were hot against Harry’s face as he went to suck on Malfoy’s neck, his own heart thudding loudly under his chest. He heard Malfoy give a little sigh as he did, making Harry’s cock twitch. Harry bit tentatively into the soft skin and Malfoy gave a little
They both took a sip and grimaced almost immediately.
Potter stared at him before frowning and saying, “I don’t know if I should thank you or be offended.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he should stand; he wasn’t particularly hungry. Before he could decide, he saw that Samuel was walking towards him. Harry stood up.
“You don’t need to say anything,” Draco told him. “In fact, I’d rather you didn’t.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Kathy said, smiling at him. “Does anyone else have any advice for Samuel?”
“I’m fine, Gin,” Harry told her. He paused a second, then said, “I wish I could go outside.”
He felt sick to his stomach. Why did he ever agree to this? Granger and Weasley were bound to continue hating him as they always did, and he couldn’t possibly blame them. Granger was tortured in his house, for Merlin’s sake.
wanting a drink.
Draco thought he knew what was on Potter’s mind, and stepped in.
“You’re just envious, Pansy,” Draco said.
“I dunno, I’m just lazy!” he exclaimed, and Draco laughed. “Leave me alone.”
Harry scoffed. “Dislike might be too weak a word for it.”
He had gotten used to the noisy crunches of Potter eating the apple, so when they stopped, Draco was pulled out of his thoughts.
“I mean, God, obviously the others help too, but with them, I feel like I just bring them down. Like they’re doing so well and whenever I show up and whine about my life I just make it worse for them. But you make it feel like I can tell you anything and you won’t judge me for it or overreact or look at me with pity. I don’t – am I making any sense?”
A few minutes later, Draco joined Potter at the table and set their respective mugs in front of them.
“They didn’t care when we started sitting next to each other, or when I started calling you Draco,” Harry said.
He’d started voluntarily sitting next to Draco in Potions. Draco tried to apologize to Blaise, who just rolled his eyes and waved Draco away; he didn’t care. Potter would also join Draco by the lake simply because he knew Draco was there, not because he was just passing by. Draco was curious as to how Potter always seemed to know where he was, but he didn’t ask. He simply enjoyed the company.
Draco paused, continuing to stare neutrally at Potter. He felt disgusting for even thinking it, but Potter was somehow still attractive at his worst. The eyes were the same – bright green and intense. His hair was longer, and now that it was washed, Draco could see that it was starting to curl towards the ends. And the facial hair…suffice to say, it suited him.
“Wait,” Harry said, pulling out his wand from a back pocket. “
He exited the bathroom, slamming the door shut.
“Yes, I am, you madwoman. Now are we going or not? Or would you rather stay in here the whole night?”
“Thank you so much, Healer…?” Granger said.
Draco’s voice cut through Harry’s bizarre line of thought; Harry blinked at him before nodding.
"Ginny," began Harry.
Harry glared at Malfoy. Who did he think he was, forcing Harry to stay here and saying he had an addiction?
"I reckon so."
“Sorry, I’ve just never told anyone before. I’ve never even said the words before,” Draco gave a nervous laugh. Potter remained silent, and Draco pushed forward, the words tumbling out of him. “That’s why I – I ran the other day. I was terrified to tell you the truth – I could barely admit it to myself, but now, after reading Mother’s letter, I feel so much better.”
Harry looked surprised, then glad.
Harry turned his attention back to Draco and smiled at him wryly. “They’re good. Finally married.”
“I’ll just check your vitals now, Mr. Potter.”
He loved Pansy and always would – they were childhood friends, after all – but conversations with her went one of two ways these days, gossip about classmates he could care less about, or his ‘path of self-destruction,’ which he wanted to avoid for obvious reasons.
“Or what?” Harry challenged.
It was late October the first time Harry went to a meeting and the room smelled like cake. Harry remembered – Samuel had mentioned that his birthday was coming up at the last meeting.
Harry thought the waitress looked at them with interest, as if trying to figure out all their ties. They were quite the group, the six of them, obviously familiar with each other but not quite
Draco applauded himself on not ripping his own hair out.
"No, thanks. We'll be excusing ourselves now, Kreacher," Harry told the little elf.
Draco hesitated. “I wouldn’t want to impose.”
Draco nodded. “We’re in the same class.”
“Yeah, I…yeah,” Harry agreed miserably.
“Stop it,” said Hermione as she wiped away a tear.
As much as Harry disliked the git, he couldn’t stem the wave of attraction that rushed over him. He hated himself for still thinking of Malfoy in this way when the man was
It was in unison that Harry and Samuel gave a loud
“Mmph.”
Draco could hear Potter calling out to him but he didn’t stop; his legs were moving on their own accord, his flight or fight instincts having kicked in.
“Going back on my word and doing something I really shouldn’t have,” Draco continued as though Harry had said nothing. “And I know I don’t have the strongest constitution, or willpower, or whatever the fuck, but I could’ve at least held firm to
Potter elbowed him. “Bugger off.”
“Of course.”
Once again, Draco sighed. "I really do owe you for forcing you to listen to all my drama."
Harry made a noise and said, “You think I go around snogging my friends? Sleeping in the same bed as them? Spending every minute of every day with them? Well, maybe the last one, before.”
And he
Cursing softly, he let it fall to the ground in order to examine his fingers. That’s what he got for staying in his head. Draco Vanished the cigarette and stood, brushing himself off. He turned and was greeted by a familiar sight.
Leonel gave a short nod, focusing more on the spells than on Draco.
“Come on.”
“What did I just say?”
They were still watching
Harry didn’t feel inclined to believe him but he sat back and shut his mouth anyways.
“Don’t you think just about everyone would find it odd if I suddenly started calling you Harry?” Draco replied, beginning to clean up their area.
“Right,” he breathed, his cheeks warming.
Betty’s face was hopeful, though still flushed a pale pink.
“Fuck,” Draco murmured. “Fuck, I can’t believe - this - you.”
“Want another drink, Ma – Draco?”
Happy Christmas indeed.
“Happy Christmas, Draco,” Harry said after a few moments of comfortable silence.
Draco looked up, startled. Potter’s eyes were on him, his face grave.
Potter face softened. “I just…you really think I don’t care about you?”
“You said…she helped you?”
Samuel thought a moment.
“You don’t need to worry about that, Draco. I respect you too much for that.”
For years, Hermione had suggested he go see someone for his PTSD (which Hermione had diagnosed him with after much careful consideration). Of course, she couldn’t let the matter rest when he said
"Are you alright?"
It seemed to be the same with many others as well. Draco, for one, and many members of group were also doing well – Sam, Cait, Damien. And unsurprisingly, Hermione and Ron were also doing wonderfully, what with being recently engaged and all.
"It wouldn't be that strange," Draco said.
“Horrible,” Harry said, his voice hardening. “They’re what Voldemort used to stay alive. He’d take objects and put pieces of his soul in them so he couldn’t really die.”
He made his way back to the bed and sat down, his back to Draco.
Her voice was growing rather shrill now.
“It’s not pity, it’s – anger,” Draco said tensely. “I’m angry that they did that to you, that they made you feel that way about yourself-“
And then they were kissing, gently. Leo tasted just as Draco had remembered, and Leo's soft lips and the scratch of stubble were just as familiar. Draco’s heart beat harder as he reached up to cup Leo’s face with his other hand. Leo grew more insistent and Draco reciprocated easily. It was just like it used to be, the way their tongues met and how Leo’s strong hands gripped Draco’s sides.
don’t tell anyone, because it’s supposed to be kept under wraps. The last thing we need here is a team of
“It won’t,” she said immediately, her tone suddenly defensive. She sighed and ran a hand through her long hair. “Look, Malfoy, I know what’s upsetting him, but it won’t get in the way of him getting better. I’ll make damn sure of that.”
“No. Whatever you’re about to do, stop,” Draco said sternly, backing away slightly.
“But…I like that about you,” Draco told Harry. “Heart-on-his-sleeve Potter. I might have even missed how obnoxious you used to be.”
Harry waved the apology away. "It's fine. You two have got jobs and actual lives -"
“I’ll get the first round,” Harry offered.
“Oh, Astoria, thank you,” Draco said, taking his drink from her hand instead of responding right away. He took a gulp before nodding his head towards Blaise and Weasley. “You’ll never guess who Blaise is chatting up now.”
“Oh, wait,” Harry said.
Ron wrapped an arm protectively around her and pressed a kiss to her forehead.
"Fuck," Harry breathed out, not really of his own volition, but Draco seemed to share the sentiment, making a low noise in Harry's ear as he licked a stripe up Harry's neck.
When he’d finished his tea and toast, Draco gathered his things and Apparated back to his office, feeling slightly more prepared for what was in store for today.
He wondered if Leonel would care if he was early. Probably, since Leonel would most likely be bringing takeout back home with him. He got off work at 7:30, after all, and was most likely just as hungry as Draco was.
“I wanted to, Ron,” Harry said guiltily. “It was just complicated.”
“Right, I’m ready to go now,” Pansy said as she approached him, smelling faintly of alcohol and her usual perfume. “Draco?”
Draco listened, enraptured. He had never thought to look in the library for help.
Draco blinked. He hadn’t realized. It made sense, now that Harry said it…Draco remembered how Harry had trailed off, how he had gotten that strange look on his face when he tried to say what Draco was to him.
“My mother,” he said quietly. “She – she can’t know.”
“Again, I stress how committed we are to Mr. Potter’s recovery and well-being. We’ll leave you with him now.”
