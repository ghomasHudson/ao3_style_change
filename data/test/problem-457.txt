It’s kind of worse, Harry thinks, since now he can clearly see how beautiful Malfoy looks from up close.
“I didn’t have one,” he mumbles, so low that he hopes Malfoy hasn’t heard him. As soon as the words are out of his mouth, he wishes he could take them back, stuff them in a dark corner of his heart where he stores all of his childhood memories.
He contemplates calling in sick, sending an owl to say that he can’t make it today. But then he tells himself he’s not a coward, and he doesn’t want Malfoy to have the last word. He has breakfast in silence, Kreacher insisting on doing the washing up whilst he eats. He feels bad for the day before.
“They took my wand away when they came to collect me, and they said they sent it to my room. I couldn’t clean myself,” he cries, sounding almost hysterical. “Where the fuck is it? Shit!”
Malfoy finally turns and sneers at him, but his eyes seem a little bit lost. He looks tired, a shadow of his old self, as if he were trying his hardest to keep up the façade when he was actually just about to fall to pieces in front of Harry’s eyes.
He quickly moves his hand away, feeling the wolf whine inside him, and he takes a step towards the counter, trying to keep his heartbeat at bay, feeling a wave of panic wash through his veins.
He doesn’t sleep much that night and the following day he feels a wreck. The lessons go by in a blur and he barely takes any notes. He knows it’s not a great start, but his mind is elsewhere.
“Is that what happened earlier?” Draco asks, his pale eyebrows knitting in concern. “Did you get flashbacks from the war?”
August. He keeps on thinking about the fact that there are only two more Saturdays left until he has to go back to Hogwarts, and he’s spending today in Hermione’s company. It’s nice, but he wonders what Malfoy is doing. If he misses some company, since he’s all alone at the Manor.
“You really don’t read the papers, do you?” he muttered, finally picking up a tomato and putting it in his mouth. Draco waited for him to continue, hoping against hope that he was going to say something he had been wishing for, probably for longer than he could remember.
“You should simply ask him out, if you’re that interested,” Parkinson says, crossing her arms in front of her skinny chest. “But I doubt he will say yes.”
“Are you okay?” Draco says, running his fingers through Harry’s curls. He closes his eyes and sighs in contentment.
“I want to fuck you so badly,” Draco confesses, his thrusts becoming more erratic, pumping him faster, until Harry spills white ropes of hot come all over the bedsheets, panting and whimpering as he shudders in Draco’s arms. “I want you to be mine, Harry.
“Harry…” he moans, fingers already sliding into dark curls, tugging at them gently, letting Harry take him apart with his mouth.
Parkinson takes the hand Hermione offers and follows her to their dorm, sniffing and drying her face with her hands. Zabini is still fuming as he stares expectantly at Draco.
“Potter?” he hears Malfoy ask. Is it too weird to sleep here? He did it the day before, and nothing happened. He knows Malfoy won’t hurt him, not with a house full of Aurors. Besides, he could have done what he wanted to Harry the night before, when it was just the two of them, and he didn’t.
He crosses the words out, hoping that Draco hasn’t seen them, but also wishing the opposite at the same time.
He tried with Muggles, but he always felt like he was lying and hiding even more of himself than when he was hanging out with wizards and witches, so he just stopped going out.
“You wouldn’t buy it for yourself?” Harry asks, letting one of his hands slide down Draco’s back, enveloping him in a warm embrace, wanting him closer.
“We’ve been…” Draco moves his hand in a circular motion and his ears turn red, “Merlin, Potter, do I need to make a drawing for you? I’ve been flooing my lower half there so that Theo can impregnate me. There you go.”
Harry holds the box carefully, opening it with trembling fingers. Music begins to play, and Harry realises it’s a carillon. There’s a small figurine at the core of it, a tiny person on a broom, probably an inch long. Harry’s mouth opens wide when the figurine comes to life and a spark of gold escapes its hand, and starts flying around the room. A snitch. The wizard on the broom starts chasing it, diving around Harry, tickling his face as it zooms too close to his ear. It catches the snitch and does a triumphant loop before it returns to the carillon.
Harry’s eyes open wide and he feels his heart beating madly. He drops the book he’s holding and just stares at Malfoy.
“Surely you’ve noticed Draco has OCD,” Zabini drawls, finally looking at him. “You spend your days watching him.”
“You would never,” Ginny says, rolling her eyes. “You’re secretly terrified of Parkinson. And she would definitely kill you if you laid a single finger on her best friend.”
“Shhh…shut up and enjoy my Slytherin lovemaking,” he whispered, making Harry laugh again. He teased him for what felt like ages before he finally started pounding into him, making Harry see the stars under his eyelids as he came with Draco’s name on his lips.
There’s a moment of silence and Harry can hear his own heart beating madly, Draco’s laboured breathing while his fingers shift inside him. The ties are not too tight around Harry’s wrists and he moves his hands, gripping the bars as he waits for Draco’s answer.
He stands up, wanting to leave, to go away, even though the only place he’s allowed to go to for the next three months is his bedroom.
“Do you have any idea for how long I’ve wanted this?” Draco asks, his voice sounding husky with want and Harry simply groans, capturing his lips again, letting his hands roam up Draco’s back, pulling him even closer.
“Do you want me to stop?” Draco asks, letting go of his cock with an indecent sound that makes Harry want to beg him to continue.
“I’ve been in love with you for ages,” Draco replies, sheepishly, “I was just terrified of telling you. I’ve never told anyone before.”
“I can’t sleep with you, Harry,” Draco replies, shaking his head, his eyebrows creased. “We were lucky no one caught us last time, but it’s too risky.”
Harry’s mind resonated in sympathy.  If it were his mother in that situation, if she were still alive, he was sure he’d be half killing himself trying to save her too.  Even if it meant doing something that he would never do under any other circumstances.
“Pretty much.  I think anyway.  Look that doesn’t matter.” Draco waved his hand dismissively.  “Why didn’t you use the bloody anaesthetic ointment I put in your bag?”
“Urrr… Thanks…uuhh… Tawly.”  Harry replied, feeling a little awkward.  House elves were not something he was particularly used to, and his experience thus far had been a very mixed bag between Winky, Dobby and Kreacher.
The three of them got in the bath and Harry basked in the love and attention his two companions gave him.  The room produced a chilled and delicious bottle of white wine, which they shared. The room didn’t care that they were underage, nor that it was a school night.  It could tell they needed to relax.  It always took the bottles away when it decided they’d had enough anyway. Draco washed his hair with loving attention whilst Harry sat on his lap.  Blaise massaged the tension out of the muscles in his back and shoulders.  His scar tingled but as he felt more and more relaxed the less it did.  Maybe this was the key to occlumency.  Clearing his mind had never been easier than when he had Draco and Blaise helping him.  They eventually managed to drag themselves out, and Harry felt insanely jealous when Draco and Blaise got into their pyjamas, whilst he had to put his school robes back on once he’d dried.  All things willing he’d be back with them in half an hour.  It was in fact an hour before he was able to get back, after the interrogation he got about the lesson from Ron and Hermione in the common room.  He had never been more grateful for the ward around his bed when he snuck out just after his dorm-mates got into bed.  When he got to the room, he dragged Blaise and Draco into their bed and they spent a fruitful hour undoing all of the stress the hour apart had caused Harry, with tongues and hands exploring pleasurably, before all crashing asleep feeling sated.
“I… Yes…”  Harry said, then addressing the room and smiling, despite his tear stained face.  “Thank you.”
The words were said with challenge in the blonde’s voice.  Harry had spent enough time studying Malfoy over the last 6 years to know that.  He didn’t think that Malfoy’s mission was to kill him though.  He knew that Voldemort would never send another to kill him.  Maybe to capture him, but he didn’t think that was what Malfoy’s task was either.  And even if it were, he was clearly failing miserably at it, and would have no way of getting him out of the castle and to wherever Voldemort was.
“We could run though.” Last time it had been a spur of the moment thought, not really meant.  Now it was rapidly becoming the only thing that made sense.  “We have more than enough money to hide for years, decades, forever if necessary.  I don’t think I can stay away from you again.”
Harry’s dress robes were uncomfortable.   There was no reason for them to be.  They were expensive and tailored to fit him perfectly, but somehow, they felt two sizes too small and made from cheapest, nastiest material he could imagine.  He knows it’s in his head, but it makes him feel antsy.  That he’s going to spend the whole evening on display is probably adding to his distress.  He’d apparated with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny to Hogsmeade station.  The vultures from press were all waiting there, ready to pounce.  Desperate to get a photo of the Golden Trio, and the perfect couple, as they wait to take the Thestral drawn carriages up to Hogwarts.  Harry doesn’t hear the conversation between the other three, as they travel through the village and up through the gates to the school that was once his home.  The days since he’d last seen Draco were taking their toll.  Then on top of all he was already dealing with, the news of the pub bombing, only a few days earlier, had shaken him.  Him and Malfoy had been in there only a few weeks ago and now, some sick bastard had managed to kill three people, and injured more than 50 others, in a place he’d once felt safe.  Draco was right about there being no where they could be accepted.  They weren’t even safe in the muggle world, it seemed.  The reports of the hate crime had helped him retain his conviction that he and Malfoy couldn’t be together.  Once he was removed from the situation, he had forgiven Draco, mostly, for his heartless words.  When he wasn’t feeling hurt by the other man, it was easier to understand why he had done it and agree with the logic.  Still, the decision he’d made after that last disastrous fight with Draco, was weighing ever more heavily on his mind.  He tried to tell himself that he was doing it to protect Draco, not that he simply couldn’t perceive any other option.  It was like Draco had said, if he couldn’t be happy, at least everyone else could.
“You need to tell Lily all of this.  I know she feels that same way you do.  She’s just found a way to cope with it a little.  This isn’t how she planned to spend this year either.”
Draco groaned, although he was fairly certain in his current state of mind, he wouldn’t have been able to pick anything from the menu.  Doris knew what he liked anyway, not that it really mattered.  The chances of him actually enjoying eating any of it were non-existent.
“It is absolutely okay to do colouring on the floor outside when a grownup says so.”  Draco reassured his young cousin.  Teddy grins at him.  Andromeda puts the toddler down and allows herself to be dragged to the artwork Teddy is determined to show off to her.  Draco goes with them.
“I know that…”  Harry swatted lightly at Draco.  “But your wand will have the trace on it.  We can’t alert the Ministry of Magic.  One, what will we tell them… two… even if we do manage to keep it from them, we are time travellers.  Besides, you have the Dark Mark on your arm, and I’m pretty sure they aren’t going to be lenient with you right now about that.”
“I found one in the Manor when I was nine.”  It was said at a whisper.  “It was such a pretty quill.  I sneaked it out of the cabinet it was stored in in Father’s office and took it back to my room.  I tried drawing with it.  The scream I let out when it tore into me brought Mother running.”  Potter snorted at this, and Draco found himself scowling before he continued.  “Yeah, well I was a fucking child and it hurt.  That’s beside the point though.  I have never seen Mother so angry as when she spotted the thing.  She burnt it up without even taking out her wand.  She then proceeded to scream at Father for having it in the house for the rest of the evening.  Turns out her darling Mother had made her, and her sisters, use them to help improve their handwriting when she was little. Merlin knows how that was meant to work, but as a consequence she vowed that she would never allow one in her home.”
“He’ll kill you.  He’ll kill little Harry.”  Remus pleaded, trying to reason with the two young men who had just thrown themselves in front of the bastard that ruined so many lives.  Who had killed two of his best friends only a few months ago.
“So… this place seems nice.  I’ve never been for Indian before.”  Justin eventually said, sitting down at the same time.
“Do you know how big this sodding place is?  It’s not like any decorators are going to come here and do it for us.”  It wasn’t an outright no, which Harry took as a good sign.  He also found he liked Malfoy grouping them together.  That he thought of fixing the Manor as both of their tasks.  That these weeks together had made them a team.
“I know.”  Harry replied.  “Someone is going to notice eventually.  I think I could probably spend a night away, but I don’t think I would sleep though, and I’m fairly certain it would be disastrous the next morning.”
It’s Teddy that finally pulls them from their tears and the hug.  The monitor goes off, and they know he’s woken from his nap.  He’s probably hungry too.  It’s already half four, and thirty minutes after he usually awakes.  Blaise goes to start making something for tea, and Draco sits with Andi at the counter they usually eat at when they don’t have company, talking to her in soft tones.  Harry goes to fetch the little rascal.  When Harry returns there is laughter in the kitchen.
Harry’s eyes went back to the dance floor, watching Teddy and Draco dancing together.  He couldn’t help but smile.
“You heard what I said.  Your son has gotten my daughter pregnant.”  His words were slow and even, but he couldn’t hide the red of his temper as he said them.
Teddy blushed furiously.  “Yeah… about him… would you consider talking to him again.  Get your side of it out.  You can’t let the papers keep saying that Draco tricked the Aurors into not arresting him and bringing up every bit of horrible half-truth they can learn about both of your pasts.”
“Your mother is going to testify.”  Harry said, trying to distract himself from the thoughts that were going through his head.
“Fine I’ll open it.” Ron said, sullenly.  Hermione snorted; she could tell her husband was as curious as she was about this.
“Go on.  I can tell somethings bothering you.  And the new regime of meds is really helping.  Don’t worry about it.”
“It’s been hard.  Number two stayed off work at home with number one whilst I was in the hospital.  It was pretty bad from what I’ve been told. And One had a nasty episode last week.”
Harry focussed back on Draco, running his fingers through the fine blond hair.  Glad that Draco was asleep and not hearing this conversation.
“It’s like a confundus charm, except placed around an object.  I’m guessing the bed would be best in this case.  Then we add illusions of ourselves sleeping.  No one would be any the wiser.  If anyone woke up in the night, they’d assume we were asleep.  We’d have to cancel the illusion every morning, but the ward could stay in place.  All it does is make it seem like being near and looking at our beds was nothing important.  The illusion’s a secondary precaution.  Room will make sure we’re always awake at the right time to get up, won’t you?”
“He should.”  Harry said, a little sadly.  He wished Draco could do this for a living.  That he could feel comfortable enough in himself and others’ reactions to him.  “I think he’d be good at it.”
‘Do you want to speak to your father?’  Harry thought at the bond, but there was no answer.  Even now Draco had his shields so firmly in place that Harry’s message wouldn’t go through.  Harry wanted to shake his ridiculous partner.  Didn’t he realise that he was getting Draco out of here?  That opening the bond wasn’t going to open them to the pain of continued separation now.  He tried again.  ‘Please Draco, Love.  Listen to me.  I’m taking you away.  I know that what is going to happen is awful, but he’s doing it for you.  I can’t save him.  I am saving you.’  Again the thoughts rammed against the brick wall that was Draco’s shield against their connection.  Harry knew he had no choice but to speak out loud.
“I got home ten minutes ago and found him like this.  He was already unconscious.  I think he’s taken something as well.  He’s still breathing, but…”
Draco stopped walking.   Harry noticed and stopped too, turning around so they were facing each other.
“It would have been easier in the other life.  I didn’t have anyone.  Ron and Hermione would have been sad.  But they would have gotten over it… But… Little Harry.  I…”
“Probably.” Although Potter didn’t sound sure for some unknown reason.  “Look, why don’t you go to bed.  I’ll stay here and soak my hand and head back up to the tower in a bit.  You don’t need to wait for me.”
“These” and she lifted her right leg and pointed her toe.  Scorpius felt his trousers start to become more uncomfortable as she did this, but the robes covered him this time.  Lily continued with a story he only half listened to, about the origins of her very luminous socks, something about a muggle cartoon.  His mind kept drifting back to his day out with the Potters and their friends in London, particularly sitting next to Lily in Regents park.  He’d had to pull his legs right up to him to cover that problem, stupid muggle clothing.  When Mr Potter had walked over with the hot chocolate it was all he could do to not turn scarlet with embarrassment.  Then there was the cramped position they had ended up in on the tube…  These thoughts were not helping with the uncomfortable feeling; in fact, it was growing.  He tried to gauge back into the conversation.
“I would.” Draco replied, just about holding back the sneer that wanted to accompany the words.  “And those quills are sick.  She should be fired.”
“So this is what you call studying then” Al said, and neither Scorpius or Lily knew what to say in reply.
This was what both he and Harry were dreading.  Their glamours were strong, but there was always a chance that someone who knew them well would be able to see through them.
“Draco.  You’re already dressed.  You don’t need to change for dinner with me and Blaise.”  Harry tried to reassure his lover, unsuccessfully.
“Then he left and made you feel like you did when he left before, after he said he wanted to be with you in the open, and you told him no.”
Harry almost felt overwhelmed with anticipation and fear.  True to his word Lucius dropped his appeal immediately and made the requisite requests.  The Minister had been over the moon when Harry reported back and enthusiastically agreed that Harry would be the one to accompany Draco to his Father’s execution.  The rest of the week had been spent in mad planning.  Ensuring the wards on Grimmauld were impenetrable.  Packing and shrinking what possessions remained; they could be collected as soon as it was deemed safe to get back here.  Grimmauld was too well known as a possibility for him hiding for them to use it as a safe house anymore.  Despite the fact it had been a home to him, Draco, and Blaise since the end of 5
“So you’ve proven you are who you say you are.”  Sirius spat out, glaring at Draco.  Sirius had regained his distrust along with his voice.  Even if for now he’d accepted they were who they said they were.
Harry looked down at Hermione’s finger, noticing for the first time the small, diamond engagement ring.
Lucius looked up.  His eyes looked half dead, but there was still something there.  A small spark of fight left.  It was something that Harry could use.
“I don’t like it.  But that’s just because I want to protect you from everything.  I know I can’t do that.  Or at least I can’t do that by stopping you doing things that are important to you.”
“Fuck.  Fuck.”  Blaise was coming apart at the seams, but somehow right now, that helped Harry remain calm.  He didn’t have a choice.  He could break down later.
“I haven’t slept with Ginny since her birthday.  The one before the accident.  Around 18 months ago.”
“Actually he’s a seriously bad cook.”  Harry said, smiling at the memory of the last time Draco insisted on making dinner a week ago and had ended up burning the pasta he was cooking.  They’d resorted to takeaway in the end.  “Like honestly, I don’t quite know how he can bake some of the things he does but fail to make even the simplest of savoury dishes.”
“Nice to meet you Lily, Scorpius has written about you often in his letters.” Draco noticed Lily blush as he said this. “Albus, it’s nice to see you again.  Are you all ready to head back to the Manor?”
“Well we have a couple of stipulations.”  The blonde said, confirming what Justin had expected. Before he could speak up and ask what those limits might be the blonde continued, answering the unasked question. “Don’t ask us about anything we did during war, and don’t ask us about why Harry disappeared.  Will this be acceptable?  I think it’s pretty generous.  But please remember that if you agree to this and go back on your word, we’ll bankrupt you and your paper and make sure you never work again.”
“So, what time do you want him back, and what’s the easiest way for me to get him home?” Al’s dad asked.
“I’m not going to push you, dear.  Just… try not to shut me out completely.  I know I haven’t been the best parent to you in the last few years.  But it doesn’t mean I don’t love you.  It doesn’t mean that I’m not concerned for your well-being.”
Just a quick warning about underage drinking and some sexual content (nothing explicit) - the boys are 15/16 and the age of consent in the UK is 16 (although at the time for homosexual men it was 18 - it was lowered from 21 in the Criminal justice and Order Act 1994 - even though it was 16 for hetrosexual couples.  It wasn't until the Sexual Offences act 2000 that age of consent was finally equalised.  Anyway, enough of the brief history lesson).
Harry opened his eyes.  He was cold and his head felt muddled.  Nothing seemed to hurt, so he guessed he hadn’t been injured at least.   Where the hell was he?  The last thing he remembered was talking with Malfoy in the room of requirement.  Then a bright light.  Had he made a mistake.  Had Malfoy actually being trying to get him out of the castle.  He didn’t think he’d been wrong.  And he couldn’t imagine how Malfoy sobbing on him and confessing to having the Dark Mark could have been part of any plot.  He shifted so he was sitting up and looked around.  It was dark and the moon was small and not providing much light – he was sure it was still meant to be daytime – or at least the sun had still been out when they had entered the room of requirement.  It felt like the middle of the night now – hours had clearly passed.  Looking at his surroundings something else occurred to him.  The place was familiar.  Before he could fully process that thought, a groan came from behind him.
“You don’t have to do things just because everyone tells you you should.  My parents spent years telling me I was going to grow up to be a doctor but all I wanted to do was draw and make things.  Here I am now, studying art and design at University and working in a teashop; spending my evenings teaching rich young mums to draw and sew in the evening.”
The estates agents he had used for Grimmauld place dealt with both muggle and wizarding houses.  The pictures in the window showed one set of pictures to muggles, whilst an entirely different set were visible to those with magical ability. One of the images not visible to muggles was not a picture but instructions to wizards to ask for Anthony Edgecome on entering.  Harry entered and following the instructions was shown straight through the back room.  Harry wasn’t exactly sure how this joint enterprise worked, and had never been shown to somebody by any of the variety of names that the sign seemed to choose at random for wizards to ask for.  All he knew was that those after magical property read the sign outside and asked for the current name, whilst muggles did not.
“It’s from Molly.”  Harry answered, turning on his stool so he was facing Draco.  “She wants me to come over on Sunday.”
“You’re 16 and you’re scared.”  Harry said with conviction.  “Your Father is an evil bastard, but I don’t think you are.  You may have been a bully and a prat, but that doesn’t mean you deserve whatever is happening to you right now.  You look half-starved and sleep deprived.  You’re a wreck.  No, I don’t think you deserve whatever is happening to make your life so unbearable right now.”
“I really don’t understand how people manage with just two in a relationship.”  Blaise said, grabbing both his lovers by the hand and dragging them to the bedroom.
“Stop being evasive.  It’s disconcerting to see you avoiding question’s like this.  Normally when you avoid questions it’s with sullen silence, not this happy teasing you seem to be using with me today.”  She’d retuned to her strict no nonsense voice, clearly trying to cover her surprise.
“You don’t know how happy you’ve made me sweetheart, being okay with this.  Especially with everything else that’s happening now. But me and Draco do want to talk to you both about whether you’ve decided what you want to do about the baby.”
“Well I don’t care.”  Draco retorted a little too quickly.  Then he saw the hurt expression cross his friends face when he said this, and he immediately regretted it.  He changed his tone from the prickly one he’d been using in his annoyance at being caught.  When he spoke again it was with the soft, almost pleading tone.  “No, I’m sorry, I do care.  I just… Look I can’t talk about it.  It’s… when I know what the hell it is and manage to find some sort of solution, I’ll tell you.  But until then I just can’t okay.  And if you are truly my friend, you won’t push this.”
“No idea.  But I’m very glad you did.”  Harry wrapped his arms around Blaise and kissed him, languidly.  The room seemed to chuckle in response.
“I’m not sure how they did it exactly, but we were all stood there talking for several minutes whilst the Aurors were searching.  Well I talked to Harry, and he talked to the others.” That interaction had been the oddest part of the whole evening, and that was saying something.  Harry changed from the slightly morose and awkward person he was talking to her, into the much more reckless and light-hearted person she remembered from her days in Hogwarts.  The days before Voldemort had come back.  It seemed like Harry knew how to have fun with them, in a way she had long since forgotten he was capable of.  “They behave differently with him, and each other.  It wasn’t like I remembered from school.  He behaved differently with them too. It was like he was younger.  Like he didn’t have the weight of the world on his shoulders.” Then with amusement she added.  “It was Harry’s whiskey we were drinking the rest of the night, he told me told me to take it before they went off to explore the castle.”
“Well, no matter what they say, you’re not coming back any earlier.”  Robards said rather jovially.  The entire department knew Harry was well known for trying to come back to work as soon as possible after an injury, no matter how severe.  It had become somewhat of an office joke.
“Sorry to interrupt you guys, but you’re both wanted in the Headmistress’s office, as soon as possible.”
Once they were all dried and dressed, Scorpius lead them through the house to a large dining room. The table was ladened with more food than the seven of them possibly manage.  There were three different quiches, a pheasant pie with hot water crust pastry, a variety of salads, freshly baked bread to make sandwiches, a whole selection of cured meats and ham, hot sausages, the list went on.  Scorpius said that the house elves had missed throwing parties for his parents’ friends since his mother died and tended to go a little overboard whenever there were guests at the Manor.  The twins and Albus were too busy stuffing their faces to listen but Lily saw the slight wince of pain when Scorpius mentioned his mother.  She moved her hand under the table to gently squeeze his leg, and he looked at her and smiled.  Once they had all had their fill of lunch, there was a crack and one of the house elves appeared in the room asking if they would like dessert.  Scorpius declined, saying they were all too full at the moment.  There was a heart-breaking look of devastation on the house elves squashed face when Scorpius said this, that didn’t lift until they had all promised they would like something a bit later.  Before the house elf disappeared Scorpius also whispered to it to make sure that some food was taken to his father.  Lily was the only one who heard that though.  Scorpius had mentioned to her, when he’d come to Grimmauld Place late on Christmas Day, that he was a bit worried about his Father looking tired and thin.  They had all been sat in the front living room.  Albus and Rose playing chess, Uncle Ron passed out on the sofa snoring having eaten too much at Grandmother’s earlier.  Hugo and Aunty Hermione were both sat reading their new books.  She had thought her Dad was asleep in the armchair nearest the two of them, but he’d looked up at the mention of Mr Malfoy, and she thought she’d seen a shadow of concern cross his face.  He’d gotten up and left the room, returning half an hour later behaving perfectly normally, so she guessed she must have imagined it.
“Actually.  I don’t want to know.  Just draw it for us.”  Harry did not need to know what Sirius had gotten up to in school.  It was far too weird to think about.
“Oh.  Well that’s okay then.”  Ron shrugged.  “Don’t know why you didn’t just tell me before, but hey, whatever makes you happy.  Does Hermione know?”
“I’m sorry ‘Mione.  I didn’t mean to.  I know they wanted Malfoy, but I didn’t know they’d chose that specific time to go.”
“I don’t think he’ll stay asleep if I try and put him back to bed just yet.”  Harry indicated toward Teddy.
“Harry, what the fuck happened?”  Blaise said, breaking Harry’s heart a little as he did so at the pain in his partner’s voice.
“He’s not Her.”  Harry hated the reminder that Draco had the same condition Bellatrix Lestrange had.
“Of course they chose that time.  If it were you planning to try and arrest him, wouldn’t you choose a time when he’s separated from Harry.  Do you at least know what they were trying to do?”
“Your Dad’s here Scorp. You need to get up.  I’ve got you some clothes out.  Do you want to shower before you get dressed?”
“Hawwy.”  Little Draco shouted when the four of them came downstairs and he spotted Harry.  Harry rushed forward and scooped the little blond toddler up into his arms.  Draco had become much more confident in the last week, although he was still quieter than little Harry.
Harry woke up feeling hot, but comfy, his hand stoking something, soft.  He didn’t open his eyes and wasn’t really sure what had awoken him, but something heavy was on top of him.  He continued to stroke and what ever was there was making satisfied noises, as if he was enjoying Harry’s petting.  Noises, Harry realised, that couldn’t be coming from a kitten.  Suddenly he was very awake, and jumped up, throwing a very human Malfoy unceremoniously onto the floor as he did so.
“Why don’t I walk you out Harry.”  Ron said giving Harry a pointed look. Harry guessed Ron wanted to talk to him about something he didn’t want Hermione to hear.  His friends never walked him out.  They reached the door and Ron stepped outside with him, closing it behind him.
Harry kissed his mini doppelganger on the head and then watched as Draco placed him in the protective circle that was part of the ritual to resurrect the man who had murdered Harry’s parents.
Draco stood up taking the sheet with him, leaving Harry on the bed and walked over to the ensuite bathroom to shower.  Draco thought, as the hot water and soap washed over him, that maybe the two of them could head down to the pool and spend the day relaxing by the water.  Pansy and Blaise would join them this evening, and they’d drink too many cocktails. Stay up too late talking.  Then tomorrow Harry would tease him about his hangover.  His life was perfect.  They’d escaped everything a decade ago.  He could still remember it like it was yesterday.  Leaving the hotel in the early hours of the morning.  Heading to the airport to dump his phone.  Harry throwing his wedding band in the same bin, before they apparated to the Manor.  His mother had been horrified, at first, when they’d shown up and told her what they were going to do.  But she could see there was no stopping him, so she gave him her blessing and promised that she’d sort everything out to cancel his own upcoming wedding as discreetly as possible.  It couldn’t be known that the two of them had vanished at the same time.   She’d also made them promise to keep in touch.  Then the two of them flooed from there to Blaise’s house, to plan what to do next.  They’d spent the next 6 months travelling the world, using glamours to avoid being recognised when in public.  When they returned to Blaise’s, both he and Draco’s mum had helped them to sort out Harry’s bank accounts.  Cutting him off as completely as they could from his old life.  Then they bought the house they now lived in and started their new life.   They stopped worrying so much about being found, feeling secure in the exclusive village they lived in.  Draco had been able to set up a successful potions business and Harry had started writing children’s stories.  It had been a shock to both of them when the first one had been published, but Harry’s books turned out to be immensely popular.  Draco knew Harry liked to imagine his friends reading them to their children.  Picturing them reading the dedication but not knowing it was for them.
Scorpius began unpacking the feast as Hugo, Lysander, Rosie and Al plonked themselves down on the blanket, Rosie casting a quick engorgement charm so they would all fit.  After eating the group spent an hour running round the park and playing on the children’s playground.  Then they all headed back into the village as a group to do some shopping before they had to be back at the school.  It was approaching 4 o’clock when they walked through the gates to the castle grounds.  Lily and Scorpius separated at the entrance hall, as Lily wanted to go put her stuff back in her room and get cleaned up before dinner.  Scorpius went back to his dorm in Slytherin to do the same, accompanied by Al, chatting happily about their day and the feast planned for the following evening.
“Where to Potter?  There is nowhere in the world where the Saviour and a failed Death Eater can be happy.  We had one last night Potter.  It was fun.  That was all this was.  That’s all it can be.  Now I’m going to go before any Weasley discovers me here.  You are going to wash the smell of sex off yourself and go eat breakfast.  By this evening you will be a married man who will forget all about his sordid affair with a marked man.”
“You are the most important part.  Or at least according to this.  We have no idea what a stable bond will actually mean, but I think the writers speculation of increased strength has to be given some credence, given it forms only when one party has need of additional power during a traumatic event.  I can’t see any other explanation.  It doesn’t make sense for it only to be able to give strength to get through one event and then result in the excruciating death of two wizards a few months later.”  Draco had wrapped his arms around Blaise.
“So good.”  Harry replied, slightly out of breath, and then realised that he’d done practically nothing for Draco in return and felt guilty.  “I… you didn’t…”
“At least we never had to worry about unexpected pregnancies.” Harry said, just for something to fill the silence and tension that was building between them.  His thumbs gently massaging the outside of Draco’s thighs as he knelt there.
Just a slight warning, there is a Scorpius/Lily scene in this chapter that doesn't just cut out when they start kissing.  Please be aware that at this point Lily has just turned 15 and Scorpius is 16.
“Please Draco.” He said, reaching his hand out to stroke Draco’s cheek lightly with his thumb.  Draco didn’t respond for several minutes.  They just sat there.  Staring into each other’s eyes.
Draco helped him sit slightly and take several mouthfuls of water.  He felt a little more like himself.  A little less like the confused mess that had woken before.
Lucius Malfoy looked truly shocked at that statement.  He spent several long seconds examining Harry’s face.  Harry didn’t know exactly what he saw there, but as the curiosity didn’t disappear Harry went on.
“I got your tea,” Draco says when Harry finally lets go. “And presents from your friends. Luna had to shrink them all because they took up so much space.”
“A Boggart,” Harry replies, closing his eyes and enjoying the feeling of Draco’s hands on him. “I kind of forgot about it. It's been there since last summer.”
“Potter, you’ve lost the plot,” Draco mutters, a smile forming at the corner of his lips. Harry laughs and lowers himself, grabbing his glasses with one hand to prevent them from falling down and holding onto the broom with the other.
When Harry opens the parcel Mrs Weasley has sent him, he finds a new red jumper with an ‘H’ in the middle, and a pair of green knitted mittens with a silver ‘D’ on both of them.
Harry is so tired anyway. He has barely slept all week, and the exhaustion is catching up with him. He considers taking some Dreamless Sleep in the evening, just to have at least one night of peace, when he feels a wave of nausea. He’s been reading the same page for the past hour, and the letters start swimming in front of his eyes, so he closes them, resting his head on the sofa. If only he could sleep, even for a little bit.
“We needed to check that Narcissa and Draco were not plotting against the Ministry and were not part of Lucius’s escape plan,” the Minister replies through gritted teeth. “Both of them were completely unaware of the fact that Lucius could turn into a bird. He must have become an
“Unbelievable!” Hermione scolds him. “After all the time I spent preparing your revision timetable.”
“You’re mad,” Draco whispers, looking at his left arm. Harry places his hand on it, squeezing it. “I’ve lost everything. If it weren’t for you, I would be in Azkaban.”
Harry stands up and goes back to his room, fishing out the Marauders Map from his trunk. He spots Draco’s name in the Headmistress’s office, and then he waits for it to move. It takes a while, and in the meantime Ron and Neville come back, asking if he wants to go out and fly with them, since the day is sunny and still relatively warm. Harry is tempted, but he says that he needs to catch up on some homework, so they go without him.
“I love you too,” he whispers, a tentative smile illuminating his beautiful face. “I was just terrified of telling you.”
“Don’t you think you should set young wizards and witches a good example?” another reporter asked, taking a step too close, and then Draco Apparated them straight to their hotel room, panting and swearing. The blond groaned as he paced around the room, making Harry feel even more lost.
Harry peeks behind Malfoy’s back. and he nearly jumps when the Slytherin lets out a triumphant, “Ah! Found them!”
Harry groaned and grabbed his arse cheeks, pulling him closer, gasping as their hard cocks rubbed against each other.
“Your legs now,” Harry says, kneeling on the floor in front of Draco. His eyes land on the Slytherin’s crotch, where his cock is starting to stiffen under Harry’s gaze. He licks his lips and looks up, finding grey eyes staring back at him. “I could…”
“Harry, breathe,” Draco murmurs calmly, suddenly behind him. Harry closes the paper, scrunching up the pages. His vision is swimming, tiny lights shimmering in front of him. “You’re hyperventilating, love. You need to breathe. Look at me, please.”
“Hey, look at me,” Harry says, waiting for grey eyes to find the courage to meet his. “I want you. And apparently, for some crazy reason that I still don’t understand, you want me too. That’s all that matters. It’s not about deserving or not. Besides, I’m a complete mess, so I have no idea what
It tickles at first, then it hurts a little bit, but it is nothing like the pain that Harry was expecting. A series of dots appear on Harry’s chest before Draco connects them with straight lines, making the constellation appear and flicker on his copper skin, as if shining by its own light.
His magic is so out of control that Kreacher appears to salvage a few expensive family heirlooms, before disappearing again with a yelp. Harry destroys the parlour again, the sofas shred to pieces, the wallpaper peeling off the walls and all the glass shattering. He screams until he grows hoarse and his throat hurts.
“To delete the message, you simply have to cross out what you have written,” Malfoy explains, striking a line through his scribble and making it disappear from both sheets.
Harry takes a step back, embarrassed, and feels his own cheeks colouring, noticing how Malfoy’s are already a deep shade of red.
“I’ve never done this with a man before,” Harry confesses, and Draco replies that he has never had sex with anyone, but he’s read plenty of books, so he knows what to do. He guides Harry with whispered words, making him use his hands and his mouth, to open him up with trembling fingers. Draco kneels on all fours, and Harry sinks into him with a desperate moan, inch by inch, until they’re both falling apart, calling each other’s name.
Harry doesn’t want to think about all the birthdays he’s had without cake. He doesn’t want Malfoy to know or to read it on his face. He empties his plate in silence, and then the cake appears. And it’s not just a cake.
Harry opens a volume on birds and marvels at all the different types of feathered creatures that live around the planet. Draco seems to have several books on the topic, and Harry wonders if it’s another one of his peculiar interests.
The following morning, they get on a boat and leave for Sardinia. Draco looks green for most of the trip, and Harry gently rubs his back until they finally reach land.
Draco flashes a warning look at Harry, but it’s too late. The hex that hits Petty in the chest is so strong that the man flies across the room and ends up hitting a wall and collapsing on the floor. The room falls silent and all the Junior Aurors stare at Harry, a scared expression on their faces.
“Draco…” Harry extends a hand, but then takes it back when the blond suddenly stands up and starts pacing around the room, opening drawers and taking things out.
“Pretty much the same,” Malfoy replies with a grimace. “She’s moving in with Aunt Andromeda tomorrow morning. I can’t tell if she’s happy about it or not, because she’s barely speaking. Her face looks blank most of the time these days.”
“Shall we sort out your homework?” Malfoy asks with a smile when they’ve finished eating and Harry nods.
Harry whimpers, feeling all the blood leave his head to pool in his groin. His cock is already hard and leaking and it feels like it shouldn’t be possible. Why can he only get it up for Malfoy? He should feel angry about it, but instead he’s just ridiculously turned on as he strokes his cock, making a show of it. Malfoy doesn’t touch himself, but his eyes don’t stop moving along Harry’s body.
Draco groans, desperate for some release, and he moans around Harry’s cock as he takes his own dick in his hand and starts stroking. Harry casts a lubricating spell on Draco’s hand, always the gentleman, and Draco gets lost in the blissful feeling of Harry’s cock in his mouth, his fingers secured in Draco’s hair, a slick palm flying over his dick. He comes with a low groan, mouth suddenly going slack as he shudders through the mind-blowing waves of pleasure. Then Harry comes too, covering Draco’s lips and chin with his warm sticky come.
Kingsley stands there facing him, Harry’s hand still on his arm. He’s holding it tight, and he realises it probably hurts, but he doesn’t care. Not anymore.
“Good,” Harry says, his fingers tracing Draco’s collarbone, roaming down his chest and brushing against his nipple through the thin fabric of Draco’s robes, “you know I don’t like sharing.”
Professor Marelli casts a spell Harry’s never heard of before, and the tip of Draco’s wand glows a bright shade of turquoise. The professor hands it back to him and steps back. Draco seems to stare at the wand in his hand for longer than necessary. Harry thinks about the fact that he has used it too, that he knows the feeling of it between his fingers, its weight.
“What do you mean by that, Potter? Am I sharing a room and a Potions lab with a ticking time bomb?” Draco asked, horrified.
“But he’s an annoying tosser,” Ron whines. Hermione ignores him and grabs her school bag from under the table.
Draco’s lips seal tight, a straight line that reminds Harry of all the conversations they’ve had in the past about Draco’s desires. About what he wants and what he thinks he deserves.
“Hogsmeade,” Harry says dismissively. “Why did you go to Marelli to get cleaned up? I thought you were going to let me treat your wounds,” he accuses.
“Don’t be late,” Pansy says, her finger pointed at Draco, “and don’t get back past curfew. The last thing we need is to lose precious points because you’ve broken a silly rule.”
“Wait, what?” Harry asks, confused, “Did you say Black? Draco teaches French in your primary school?”
“Oh,” Draco says, suddenly feeling ashamed. He stands up, sending his plate to the sink with a quick spell that makes it clink.
“So on your hands and knees, then,” he says and Draco nods. He stands up and takes his underwear off in one swift move, avoiding Harry’s enamoured gaze, then positions himself on the bed on all fours.
“Weasley, what the fuck are you doing here?” Harry hears Zabini ask. “Why did you not take Granger to Madam Puddifoot?”
“Wait a second,” Harry says, squinting his eyes as he stares at the majestic statue in the middle of the main square. “Is that bloke throwing
Draco keens as Harry starts licking him with abandon, running his hands on his thighs and fondling his balls. After a bit he closes his eyes and lets his tongue sneak inside, relishing the sharp intake of breath that Draco lets out. He fucks him with his tongue, letting his hands roam, until his fingers wrap around Draco’s cock and stroke him slowly.
Malfoy gives a curt nod, his lips a thin line as he avoids their eyes, then he moves out of the way to let them in, keeping the front door open for them. Harry stares at him as he walks past, and Malfoy’s grey eyes finally meet his for the briefest of moments, some of the old fire still there, before his gaze darts away.
She raises an eyebrow and Harry can tell that she doesn’t believe him, but he still doesn’t want to tell her. Not because he doesn’t trust her, but because this secret he’s been harbouring in his heart feels like something fragile, that might shatter too easily if let out in the light of day. He needs to nurture it in the darkness, let it grow until it’s something more solid and consistent. Saturday still feels like a dream, like a product of Harry’s messy brain. And he doesn’t feel like what he’s trying to build with Draco would survive under Hermione’s scrutiny. Not yet, at least.
“It’s okay,” Harry says, interlacing his fingers with Draco’s, using his other hand to stroke his hair.
Harry remembers the three Ds of Apparition. He shuts his eyes and thinks of where he wants to be right now.
“Harry,” he introduces himself, covering his forehead with his fringe, hoping his reputation doesn’t precede him.
As they lie in a tangle of limbs after they’ve both managed to catch their breath, Harry hears the soft thumping of the Boggart upstairs.
Harry looks at his boyfriend with panic written all over his face, and Draco snorts inelegantly, pointing at Harry’s face and laughing out loud.
“Leaving you here over Christmas.” That was not the reply he was expecting. He wanted to tell Harry not to be a sentimental sap, that he was eighteen and he was fine. But he felt a lump in his throat instead, and he nodded, tears threatening to fall down his cheeks, as Harry put his arms around him and gently kissed the corner of his mouth.
“Hey,” Harry says, reaching over him to grab his left arm. He leans forward and places a soft kiss on the mark, hearing Draco’s loud intake of breath, his arm quivering under him. “This does not define who you are now. This is a past mistake. It’s something you were forced to do against your will, to protect yourself and your mother. This mark is not who you are, Draco.”
“Speaking of clothes, Potter, what on earth are you wearing?” he asks, frowning. Harry looks at himself and raises his eyebrows.
Draco moves, casting a glance at Harry, his eyes a stormy grey that betrays the hidden dread he’s probably harbouring in his heart. Harry places his hand on the small of Draco’s back, letting his warmth seep through the fabric of his clothes. He follows the two men out of the kitchen and up the stairs. Page suddenly reappears, opening the front door and unceremoniously walking in, setting off Walburga’s portrait again. His eyes land on Draco and he sneers.
“Shut up,” Malfoy mutters darkly, and he lifts the book he’s reading to cover his blushing face. Harry wants to get up and straddle him, to rock against him, until Malfoy is a whimpering mess. It’s a shame they don’t do that kind of thing. They have barely touched at all.
“Come here,” Harry says. He swoops around Draco with his broom and ends up hovering upside down above him. “Give me a kiss.”
“It went well,” she says with a shy grin, “I just wish I didn’t have to wait another week before seeing him.”
He would never be able to forgive himself if something happened to Draco whilst he’s in England alone. Harry thinks he should have gone with him.
“Well, it appears other students still think they need to get some form of revenge,” Zabini says angrily.
It was still too early for breakfast, so he decided to go to the library and look for a few books that he needed (including one on tailoring spells to sort out his uniform). It was peaceful and empty and Draco finally relaxed, surrounded by books, inhaling the familiar smell of old tomes and dust. The library had always been his safe haven, even at the Manor. It reminded him of lazy afternoons spent flicking through the pages of a good novel or of productive weekends doing research, back in the days when Hogwarts was still a school and not a war zone.
Both his face and clothes are covered in what looks like food and mud. His long hair is plastered with bits of tomato and dirt. There’s an ugly bruise on his chin, and his top lip is bleeding.
“Probably nothing,” Harry replies and Ron stares at him, surprised. “What? Do you seriously think they’re up to no good?”
“Well, I owe you one too,” Harry says, licking chocolate off his fingers and following Malfoy’s gaze as it lingers on his hand for longer than necessary. His wolf catches the way Malfoy’s eyes open a little wider and his nostrils flare.
“I lost my temper,” Harry replies, his voice sounding hoarse and broken. He wonders if Draco has heard his conversation with Marelli. If he knows that there’s something deeply wrong with him. He just wants to go. “I snapped and lost it. You can go back inside and finish practising with Marelli now. Happy?”
“Don’t go and defend that albino ferret,” Ron admonishes him, making Harry finally smile. It’s a tiny broken thing that makes him feel even more pitiful. “Did you tell Hermione? She seemed to know already.”
“I don’t want her to feel like she has to do it!” he shouted back. And then whispered, after a few seconds, “I don’t deserve her help.”
“Of all the places you could touch,” Malfoy murmurs in a daze, but then Harry’s index moves down his nose, up to the tip, descending to press against full pouty lips. They’re so soft that Harry can’t help but wonder what it would feel like to kiss them. Malfoy’s tongue flicks out, and Harry lets out a tiny needy sound, pushing his finger inside the wet heat of Malfoy’s mouth. He closes his eyes as Malfoy sucks on his finger, making Harry moan as his tongue wraps around his digit.
The nights are always so long, especially since he has moved back to Grimmauld Place. He was used to sleeping with someone next to him. After years spent in a dorm at Hogwarts and then on the run with Hermione, it was nice to wake up from a nasty nightmare and focus on the regular breathing of another human being close to him to drift back to sleep. It was a huge comfort to sleep next to Ron at the Burrow over the summer, because he would be there when Harry woke up from a nightmare, offering a kind word or a glass of water, sometimes a gentle back rub. Harry suddenly misses him like mad.
He spends his Saturdays in the library, studying healing and diagnostic spells while Hermione is at home with her parents and his friends are in Hogsmeade. He tries to find a more efficient way to help Draco and treat his wounds. He even consults Slughorn on how to brew healing salves and pain relief potions, and the professor gives him some useful tips on how to improve his poor first attempts.
“Ehm,” Marelli clears his voice in the background. “I think I will go and check on the rest of the class whilst you, err, collect yourself.”
“I’ll lend you my invisibility cloak,” Harry replies, watching as Draco’s pale eyebrows raise in disbelief.
“I have chlamydia,” Draco says, nearly breathless, getting a vial out of his pocket and handing it to Harry, “so you need to take this potion, because I might have passed it on to you.”
“No,” Harry replies, confused. He spent half of the Trials in a daze. Even getting out of bed was a struggle those early days after the war. “Why on earth is his wand blocked?”
“Are you cold?” he asks and Draco shakes his head, his eyes still shut. He’s all sweaty and his hole is covered in lube, so Harry summons two cloths from the bathroom. He casts an
” he shouts, and the paper flies out of Draco’s fingers, ending up in a crumpled pile on Harry’s lap. He feels his lungs constricting, panic rising in his chest as he looks at photos. His breath gets stuck in his throat as he sees a scrawny kid, broken glasses and dirty oversized clothes. A school photo of him in year three, sporting a black eye and a broken lip. He remembers Dudley punching him and making him land in one of Petunia’s camellia bushes. He still vividly recalls how mad she got when she realised that he had ruined her precious flowers.
“I love you,” Harry says as Draco peels an orange for him, carefully removing all the white bits that Harry doesn’t like. He’s never even said anything about the way he prefers his fruit, but Draco somehow
As soon as they got off the train, Potter took his cloak off and disappeared into Hagrid’s massive embrace.
Harry drifts into deep sleep, dreaming about Ginny breaking up with him, telling him that he’s a broken thing. That she doesn’t want him anymore. He dreams about Molly and the Boggart, shifting from George, to Bill, to Ron and then to Fred, and then settling for him. Molly starts screaming, and Harry wakes up with a jolt, his heart in his throat.
Harry lies on the wooden floor, after scrubbing it clean, and thinks of all the funerals. Of baby Teddy, growing up without his mother and father, just like him. Of Hermione’s parents, who still can’t remember her properly. Of Ron’s exhausted face the last time they met at the pub. Of the picture he saw in the Prophet a few days ago, Malfoy and his mother cowering into a corner in Diagon Alley as other wizards and witches spat at them and tried to hex them. Draco looks manly and handsome, protecting his mother from the crowd, as they enter Gringotts.
Harry paces around the kitchen, wondering what the fuck he should do, making Kreacher stare at him, a confused look on his wrinkly face.
He got out of the shower and grabbed his bathrobe, trying to put it on and struggling with his injured hands. He went for his wand, to cast a drying spell in spite of the pain, but then the door opened and Potter just stood there, his mouth agape as he stared at Draco’s naked body, his eyes roaming down, cheeks turning pink. Draco felt Potter’s magic on his skin, drying him and leaving him with a warm feeling, wondering if he had done it on purpose or not.
He tells himself he feels indebted to Potter, but he knows there’s something else. He can’t help but notice how tired Potter always looks, how thin and worn out. How he never has friends over, how sometimes he stares into space, a grimace on his lovely face, his glasses askew.
“We haven’t had a bad fight in ages,” Harry points out, letting his fingers run along Draco’s back, tracing lazy patterns that make the blond shiver under him.
Draco appears a while later with his trunk, looking stiff and composed in his perfectly pressed robes.
Draco feels a wave of emotions crashing over him, remembering the way Harry said he didn’t want to share him. The fact that he called him his boyfriend. And he feels his eyes burning, tears threatening to fall.
“I managed to get a selection of their best sandwiches,” he announces, opening the door on his way back and then he freezes and stares. Because Draco is standing there, in front of him, visible and absolutely stunning.
The pyjama top Malfoy is wearing reveals part of his chest, unlike his usual formal robes that are always buttoned up to his chin. Harry spots the silvery trail of a scar making its way from Malfoy’s chest towards the hollow spot between his collarbones.
Malfoy’s magic feels like a fresh wind tickling his skin and Harry sighs in relief, letting it cool his rash and staring into silver eyes.
It turns out that Potter doesn’t have a Mind-Healer, and his friends seem completely unaware of his struggles. Draco wants to do something, at least to repay Potter’s kindness for taking him in, but he’s stuck at home and his exams are in a few days.
They spend the rest of the morning in silence, flicking through books and dividing them into two neat piles. On Malfoy’s side of the room, they put the potentially dangerous books that will go to the Department of Mysteries, and on Harry’s side they pile up the inoffensive ones that might get sold for charity.
“I swear that if your crazy magic injures me in my sleep, I am going to sue you and ask for a new roommate,” he said, feeling Harry’s hand slide under the elastic band of his boxers, tentative fingers wrapping around Draco’s hardening dick.
“Okay,” he says, his voice feeble. He thinks that maybe if Draco sleeps in the other bedroom, just for tonight, Harry will have a chance to explain everything in the morning, and then they can sleep together. “I’m sure the room Kreacher has prepared for you is a million times better than mine anyway.”
“Err…” Harry replies, heading for the dressing corner to hide his red face, “I was just helping Malfoy pack up.”
“Professor,” Hermione starts, ignoring the Slytherin’s annoyed looks, “will you still be covering the modules that will be tested in the final examination or are you planning on using a completely different scheme of work?”
“Ron invited me,” he replies, his words careful and calculated, “but I was wondering if you would consider coming with me to Grimmauld Place instead.”
“You wouldn’t want to soil your reputation by sitting next to a Death Eater,” Draco whispers, and his voice is so soft that Harry barely hears him. Harry moves closer, his knee leaning into Draco’s under the table, making him jump when they touch.
“Well…” Hermione mutters, then pauses and looks at her boyfriend, placing a hand on his arm. “I’m actually going to visit my parents at the weekend. Professor McGonagall gave me permission last month.”
Draco transfigures his handkerchief into a pocket knife and then proceeds to make a tiny cut on the tip of his index finger, letting a drop of blood fall onto the stone. Harry does the same and for a few seconds nothing seems to happen. Harry assumes it hasn’t worked and he heals their hands with a quick spell. He’s about to suggest trying a
“Don’t make that face,” the blond says, stroking Harry’s knee. “I told both Pansy and Blaise not to send me anything, because I was afraid it would be confiscated by the Aurors. We’ll exchange presents when we get back to the castle.”
“Will you calm down?” Draco asks, his eyes still glued to the fine porcelain. The teacups are different colours, all pastel with a matching dark edge and handle. “What do they do?”
Harry nods, and they depart without another word while Draco readjusts his robes. They are all wrinkled, as if they have been pulled and stretched.
,” Malfoy casts on Harry’s hand, and he’s suddenly dripping with lube, easing his way inside Malfoy’s tight heat. They both gasp as Harry’s fingers slide inside, all the way in. He doesn’t move for a few seconds, can’t pry his eyes from the sight, wishing he could burn it into his brain. Merlin, he needs to buy a Pensieve now. “You can move.”
“So, you’re living as a Muggle and you’re using your mum’s maiden name,” Harry sums up and Malfoy nods. “Am I supposed to start calling you Black, then?”
“Fuck,” Harry bites back a groan, his fingers skimming over the already tented fabric of his boxers, he keeps his eyes on the parchment and strokes a little harder, trying to imagine Draco doing the same.
of the bottle of lube being open. His senses are on alert, his skin feels like it might catch fire. Draco’s finger is cold when it gently nudges against his rim, but Harry’s been licked open and he takes a deep breath when the digit slides inside, wet and slick. Draco has pianist hands, delicate and long, his fingers reaching deep inside Harry, making him moan without control.
He wonders how Ron is doing. He remembers George’s words one lonely night at the end of June. The Weasleys take turns sleeping in George’s room, because the nights are the worst. Harry volunteered to do it a few times, but then one night he was woken up by George’s hand on his arm.
“You know what Tara says.  You will be able to do everything you could before one day.  You will get it love.  And as soon as you’re ready to try I will teach you the charm.”  Harry poked Draco in the side, trying to get him to smile.  It worked, to Harry’s relief.  Draco going into a downward spiral would not get Blaise back to work anytime soon.
Draco did as he was told and soon the flashes of colour were lighting up the screen to Toccata and Fugue.  Draco was curled into Harry’s side, and picking at his egg fried rice.  Harry was managing a little better with his food, but soon found himself too tired to continue.  He put the bowl on the floor.  Blaise was still eating, but he leant into him anyway, the same way Draco was to him, and a warm arm was placed around him.  There were dancing mushrooms on the screen now, and he fell asleep quickly to the sounds of Tchaikovsky.
“Yeah.  People really shouldn’t be able to do what we can do.  We use it to stay hidden, mostly.  But we’ve also been able to walk straight into the Ministry of Magic.”
“It’s called the room of requirement.”  Potter explained.  “It can make itself into pretty much any type of room you want.”
“Honestly, it’s fine Ron.  You and Hermione should spend some time together.  You both spent too much time with me at St Mungo’s this last fortnight.  Have some time to yourselves.”
“My friends and husband are good people. We just didn’t give them a proper chance in school.  And please don’t call him that.”
“Very well.  And I assume Mister Potter and Mister Black are here to claim their respective titles.”
Harry slumped next to Draco on the couch and let him stroke his hair until Harry finally started to relax.
“Hey.  Love, no guilt.  These things happen.  And you can’t never work again and spend all your time monitoring him to make sure nothing bad happens again.  It wouldn’t be healthy, and you’d end up killing each other.  Draco doesn’t need a babysitter.  He needs his partner.”
“Scorpius was premature, and Tori nearly died when she had him.  She developed eclampsia.  It was pretty touch and go.  Eventually they were both well enough to go home, and Scorpius doesn’t seem to have been affected at all by his early birth.  Tori never fully recovered, and we were told that she shouldn’t have any more children.  She was devastated.  I didn’t really want Scorpius to be an only child either.  I didn’t want him to experience anything like the lonely childhood I had. But it wasn’t worth the risk of her dying to have more.   I may not have loved her in the conventional way a husband usually loves his wife, but I did love her.  I still miss her.” The grief Draco felt as he spoke was palpable.  Harry hated seeing Draco upset like this and just wanted to comfort him.
“I have to be there for him.  We think we’ve found a funeral home that we can use who will be discrete.  Blaise is popping in on his lunch break today, and if they agree, he’ll get the Solicitors to write up privacy clauses, similar to the ones used on the ward at the hospital.  I can’t let Draco do this without me there.”
“Draco, love.  What’s wrong.”  Harry said, rubbing his shoulders.  “Five minutes ago I could have sworn we were heading up here to have sex, and now when we get here you look ill.”
“He didn’t do anything.  I decided to end it.  I know it’s not the first time I’ve tried, but I really meant it this time.  I can’t do it anymore.  He’s getting married in a few weeks.”
“Dealing with something to do with Father’s funeral and then he had to pop into the office.  Said he’d be back about 8.30pm.”  Draco replied and immediately retuned to the crossword in front on him.  “Wow, Luna has really gone all out there on this one.”
When Harry’s two best friends entered the room, they were appalled at the state of it.  It wasn’t just the dust coating the surfaces, or the smell of stale sweat and dirt.  It was the whole atmosphere of this room.  Like something was wrong.  Like the room was trying to make them leave.  That they were intruding.  It was the same feeling they’d had when trying to get up the stairs but magnified.  They ignored the feeling but both of them felt decidedly uneasy.  Ron headed to the ensuite to check in there, whilst Hermione began looking round the bedroom.  The wardrobe and drawers were flung open, but other than Harry’s old school robes and a couple of pairs of disgusting socks, there wasn’t anything in them.  The clothes Harry had been wearing that last day, or at least the t-shirt and jacket, were flung on the floor.  The bed was the worst.  The sheets clearly hadn’t been changed in months.  There were stains that Hermione was sure could only be semen.  She wrinkled her nose at the scent of old sweat and sex coming from the foul thing.
“Not right now…. But I know where he’ll be tonight.  And so does my companion.”  Harry threw this in so Sirius didn’t decide that the best option would be to take Harry down.  That if Harry had someone else with him that knew, then he needed to get Harry on his side to find out who else knew and take them both together.  “I know where Dumbledore is planning to take him.  If you leave him there again, I’ll never forgive you.”
“I know we didn’t, but I thought you could probably do with a little company.  Besides, this one wanted to see Lily.  I think the two of them probably need some time to sit and talk over some things.” Draco looked down at Scorpius firmly.  Harry guessed that Scorpius had told him about Lily’s decision. “Why don’t you two sit and talk here for a little while, whilst me and Harry go and get some fresh air,” Draco told the teenagers.
Their visits to England over the years had been pretty limited and since almost getting caught that first time, always under the strongest charms they had.  They occasionally did some ridiculous things in England, and occasionally Scotland, but never risked being discovered as them. Even if they were caught behaving like idiots in Diagon Alley or some other equally public venue, no one would ever discover it was them, and they had the best solicitors, money could buy that could have gotten them out of any trouble.  They had also made a mutual but undiscussed decision never to visit their old haunts.  This would be cathartic for both of them.
“No.  This isn’t genetic from what they can tell.  Probably been lingering in the background since I was disinherited.  A nasty gift from my delightful parents, but incredibly unlikely to have been passed down.”
“Okay, I get now why you’re so protective.  I’m assuming… partner two is equally protective.  What that still doesn’t explain, is why you still floo to Grimmauld when you go home though.  Does it really have to be such a secret where you live?”
“How after all this time can we not spend more than ten minutes alone before we’re all over each other.” Malfoy huffed when they stopped to breathe.  “I’m so hard right now it’s almost painful, but I think we should stop before we get even more carried away.”
“Draco.  Remember, your mother is strong.  She can do this.”  Harry said, and put his hand on Draco’s knee under the table and squeezed gently.  Draco looked at him and smiled.  “Come on, we can take the little us’ to the park or into town to do some shopping.  Maybe we can even try and get me a haircut. Some new glasses too if you’re good.  I know how much you want that.”  Harry didn’t want Draco to spend the day pacing round the flat in anxiety, as he no doubt would if left to his own devices.  He really did not fancy another shopping trip with Draco, but if that was what was needed to distract him, then Harry would do it.
“But… but… what if she…”  Teddy gulped, unable to finish.  He felt like a small child accidently changing his hair colour in front of his primary school teacher, instead of an of age wizard soon to enter his final year at school.
They headed back to Grimmauld place less than an hour later, although not before he’d been forced to partake in a round of shots and listen to a drunken speech from Ron.  Hearing his friend drone on about how magical Harry’s relationship was and how happy he was, made Harry feel physically sick.  How did none of them notice that he was the exact opposite of happy?  He was miserable.  But none of them did.  All caught up in their own happiness and the alcohol they had drunk.  The Weasley brothers were all supposed to be staying at his that evening so they could all get ready together in the morning.  He wanted to tell them all to fuck off.  He wanted to go into his house alone and lock himself away.  He didn’t though.  When they arrived at Grimmauld he let them all in and then they had tried to convince Harry to stay up and continue drinking with them.  He waved them off.  He might have let them into his home, but he still needed to be by himself.  After downing a sobering potion, to stop the room from spinning and allow him to think clearly, he walked up the stairs to his room with shouts of “Old man” and “Ball and chain” following him.
Hermione went into full research mode when they entered the library.  She immediately rushed off to go find whatever books she could on mind magic.  Harry and Ron found a table and sat and waited.  Blaise and Draco had come in less than five minutes after them and placed themselves a couple of tables away.
“Yeah, I’ve got this extra transfiguration work to do.  Plus, I was hungry.” Lily replied, though feeling anything but as she nodded towards the plate of toast.
Neville walked in then with a tray of tea and a couple of hot cross buns.  He was only wearing a pair of boxers.  Pansy and Neville had gotten on very well at the barbeque it seemed.
That was the crux of the issue.  If anyone found out about his relationship with Draco, they would be vilified.  He’d be up before a misconduct committee and Draco would probably end up in prison.  His family would hate him.  He’d lose everything.  He’d lose Draco.  He sighed.  He had no bloody clue what to do next.
“What if the ferret sent it?”  Despite his more relaxed attitude towards Harry, Ron still hated Malfoy.  She didn’t think even if Malfoy were involved in sending the parcel, he would do anything to them.  What would be the point?  She said as much.
“Well you try talking about the younger versions of yourself as separate entities whilst sounding sane.”  Draco snapped.  Harry looked at Draco pointedly and Draco rolled his eyes.  Harry glared.
“And we’re are both immensely glad for that.”  Draco said, cheekily.  Harry could tell that he wasn’t unaffected by the knowledge that Harry had been in enough pain to vocalise it.  Draco was trying to put on a brave face.
“Malfoy.”  Harry sneered.  He hated doing it, but he had to keep up the pretence.  Every inch of him longed to wrap the man he loved in his arms and get him out of here this second, but he knew he had to wait.  Had to wait till they were out of the cells so there was enough of a distraction for him to get the damned cuffs off him.  The cuffs that suppressed his magic and prevented the use of portkeys and apparition.  In his head he pleaded against the block in the bond that everything was going to be okay.  That they’d be leaving soon.  That he loved him.  Draco kept the wall up for the moment though.  Harry knew it was preventing the emotions flooding the bond betraying them with their reactions, so he let it be.
Malfoy moved up behind Harry and reached from behind and to take the wrist of Harry’s wand hand in his own.  Harry closed his eyes as Malfoy slowly directed his hand to make the movement for the spell.  Harry could feel Malfoy’s warm breath on his neck.  He tried to focus on the spell but was unable to concentrate on anything else but the sensation of the man behind him.  Unable to hold back with the close contact, Harry found himself turning his head slightly and pressing his cheek into Malfoy’s.  He used his free hand to reach back behind Malfoy’s head, his fingers tangling in the soft blonde hair.
“You finished it, or the elves finished it whilst you played with the brushes and the sparkly paint.” Harry teased.  Draco scowled at him endearingly, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the expression.  He leaned in and kissed Draco’s nose. “Come on then, show me your masterpiece.”
Harry was sat in the carriage with Draco, Teddy, Blaise, and Pansy.  They’d gone to Hogsmeade under glamours to avoid the press, that were out in droves, trying to spot himself and Draco arriving.   Once inside the gates of the castle they would be drop their disguises, and the real chaos would begin.  At least there wouldn’t be journalists inside to harass them, just the privately invited war victims, people with more money than sense buying tickets on the pretext of caring, politicians, and far too many of their old schoolteachers and classmates, all of whom would be staring.  Harry wasn’t sure whether what he was feeling was excitement or anxiety, but anxiety seemed more likely.  His thoughts kept on darting between a variety of worst-case scenarios, and ones where both him and Draco were accepted by everyone there. There was also the nervous thrum of energy that they were actually taking this step and coming out of the shadows.  Of course there was a good chance they would end up straight back in the shadows again, but that seemed to matter less than the actual trying.  Blaise and Pansy, as Draco had predicted, had insisted on coming too.  So when he wrote to McGonagall, accepting his invitation for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century, the day before the article came out, he told her to expect him and Teddy, as well as three guests.  He decided against giving their names, though after the article she could safely assume one of them was Draco.  He had no idea what she thought, having given her no way of responding, but the invites had been left for them in Hogsmeade, as he had asked.  They also had an escape plan in place.  Draco had insisted, and even if he hadn’t Harry would have.  The person most at risk in this insane plan, was Draco.  If he’d thought about that more when he was telling the reporter he and Draco were going to be attending this thing, he would never had said they were going.  But he was too stubborn to go back on his word, and he’d kind of liked the reporter – he also had a suspicion Teddy liked him too, although in a different way – and it didn’t seem fair to make the boy look a fool by not turning up at this thing.  Besides, with their contingency planning, the risks were minimal.  Even if everything went disastrously wrong, it would mean no more than one evening ruined and back to their quiet life in Tuscany.
“But if I carry on doing this right now, we could end up doing something we’re not ready for because I’m trying to make myself feel better” and she moved her hand back up to his chest before climbing off his lap and curling up next to him.
“No.  She won’t reply straight away.  And she doesn’t answer half the time anyway, and the times she does are pretty much the times I figure it out myself in the interim.  Talk to me now before I end up back at the piano to quiet the itching.”
“More than us being together.”  Harry could tell from Draco’s expressions that he was close to agreeing.  “It was hard enough to leave you at the end of the night before.  I’ve had two weeks without you.  I just need you with me.  To feel that you’re really here and aren’t just going to disappear on me.  That this isn’t just some dream and I’ll wake up and you’ll be gone.”
husband had lasted more than twice as long as any of her previous ones.  He remembered the day two years ago when they’d dropped Callie off with Daphne and Hannah.  It was meant to be for a few hours.  Pansy had said she wanted to take them out for the day for a surprise and had arranged a babysitter.  It had been a bit of a shock when the portkey she’d provided them with had whisked them off to Italy and they’d found themselves witnesses at the wedding.  Draco had chastised Pansy fiercely, but she’d just laughed at him.  Somehow, she’d managed to persuade Draco to stay.  Not given him much choice if Harry was completely honest.  Daphne and Hannah had been in on the surprise and were expecting to keep Callie overnight.  They would contact them if anything happened and she had a portkey to take them straight back if it were needed.  But she wasn’t going to hand it over unless it was needed until at least after lunch the next day.  They’d stayed out there for a full day before Draco insisted they needed to get back to their baby girl, enjoying the sun and the beach, and drinking too much.  Celebrating their friends’ happiness.
“How are we going to get there?  I think I have some muggle change in the bottom of my bag, but not enough for the bus or train into London for the two of us.  Besides, nothing will be running till morning and we might be too late if we have to wait till then.  I don’t have any wizarding money on me… that’s in my trunk back at school.”  It all came out in a rush in his delight at the fact that they were actually going to do this.
It’s Harry that answers. “We’re visiting my Godson, Teddy and thought we’d see some of the places we used to like to go to. Next question.”
Harry spent the afternoon helping Draco finish the millionaire’s short bread, as well as assisting on the batch of fudge, Draco insisted was essential.  When their efforts were done and cooled, they sent a selection of each off to Tara.  Blaise had spent his afternoon in the study working on some new coat design for the autumn collection, and how to work a variety of charms into the fabric.  Harry didn’t really understand Blaise’s job in the fashion industry, but he knew his partner loved it, horrible boss aside.  Blaise and Harry made dinner together that evening, with Draco sat watching whilst he completed the cryptic crossword from the weekend Prophet, that had been neglected until that point, making the odd comment now and then.  Harry could never manage the cryptic crosswords, sticking to the regular kind, but Draco loved them.  This is how evening should always be, as far as Harry was concerned.  Then an owl approached the window with a red letter in its claws and everything went wrong.
There's one chapter left and then the epilogue.  I'm not even sure who's point of veiw to write the final chapter from.  Although I know the last words will between Scorpius and Lily alone.  I think I want it to be from Draco's POV mostly though, I will just have to switch for the final scene.  The whole last chapter will cover a few months.  There will be an epilogue set a couple of years in the future.  I'm not one to write hard endings so I promise things will pretty much all work out.
Blaise came over and gave Harry a kiss, then leant down and kissed the still sleeping Draco, just where frown lines crinkled his brow.  The blond was tense even in sleep.
Blaise hurried to the front door when he arrived at Grimmauld Place.  Narcissa Malfoy was stood outside waiting impatiently.  She looked up with slight surprise when she saw who was at the door to let her in.
Scorpius could see the excitement in Hugo’s face, and he went off into more stories about the twins, their peculiar mother, and their famous grandfather.  Lily had obviously heard these stories already as she got out a book and put some strange white things in her ears before starting to read, once again relaxing back in what Scorpius felt was a far too seductive pose.
“The elves love being covered in paint.”  Harry was sure that they did it on purpose most of the time.  Brightening the dark empty places with their colourful presence.
“Way to ruin the mood.”  Harry replied and pulled away.  “Can you write to them?  I said I wouldn’t contact them again and I’m not sure how well another letter from me will go down?”
“We don’t need to talk about what you saw on New Year’s.  It was nothing.” Harry snapped back, knowing what it was she wanted to talk about.
“Please Draco.  We can make it an official meeting if needs be.  I can come to the Manor and explain to your mother about the probation agreement.  I’ll plan something for after for just the two of us too.”
“It was your potion” Harry said it so quickly that he was unsure that Malfoy had heard him properly.  Before Malfoy could answer, the fire flashed green and Ginny stepped into the room.  She froze seeing the two men stood in front of the fire place, and Harry quickly let go of Malfoy’s wrist.
Since the day Harry turned up after lunch at the Weasleys, both himself and Draco stopped trying to resist their mutual attraction.  He ended up spending almost every evening with Draco, as well as large chunks of his days off.  He’d been upset that they hadn’t managed to spend his 18
Harry was pleased that Malfoy had decided to leave the library, although he was concerned the house elf had implied his Master wasn’t eating again. “Yes, I’ll go there.  Could you tell me the way and send us a picnic in about half an hour?”
Little Draco started screaming and Harry got up to go to him.  Glad for the distraction.  He couldn’t believe he’d forgotten about the Longbottoms.  It seemed so unfair.  But then he’d come back here and couldn’t save his own parents either.  Remus was probably right.  Neville’s parents just weren’t meant to be saved.  Maybe if they’d stopped Bellatrix before she tortured the Longbottoms then she wouldn’t have ended up in Azkaban and who knows what that would have led to.  He decided to think of the good they’d done instead of tying himself in knots over this.  They had managed to save little Harry.  And Sirius.  And little Draco.  And Narcissa.  They’d help little Neville.  He’d start school as the more confident version of himself.  The one that had started appearing throughout 5
“So tomorrow I’ll get Tori set up and you go and meet your old friend.  I’m sure you won’t even have time for things to be awkward as you’ll be bombarded with so many questions.”  Draco teased light heartedly.
Draco seemed shocked into silence by this.  Then gaining control of himself he leant down and kissed Harry passionately.
“Yeah, well he was completely plastered.  I think he bought his own bottle of that stupidly expensive whiskey he used to like and finished off the whole thing by himself.  You have to remember that.”
“Love you too, Draco.  You too Blaise, but you need to sod off back to the office.  We can deal with any blips that happen together, just like that.”
“And I thought you were meant to be paying attention to your treatment regimen.”  Draco replied, without turning around.
“I don’t know why he even lets me near him when he’s like this, let alone let me help him.”  Harry said, a wave of guilt hitting him.  “If I’d just remembered for one bloody second that my friends might check up on me it wouldn’t have happened.”
“I’ve missed you guys too.”  Harry didn’t want to go into his decision to come off active duty.  He didn’t want to have that difficult conversation today.  Ron would be disappointed in him when he heard.
Harry was surprised at how easy it was to set up the wards so that only he and Draco could come and go from the flat.  It made him question the importance of the blood protection that he’d relied on from his Mother to keep him safe at the Dursleys.  That wasn’t something he wanted to think about now.  He had enough to be angry at Dumbledore about without adding this to the mix.  When Sirius was awake, they’d need to add him so that he could leave.  Draco wasn’t sure about letting the other man come and go freely, but Harry wouldn’t trap his godfather here.  Sirius had spent months trapped in Grimmauld place and had hated it.  Harry just couldn’t do it to him, no matter the risk of Sirius betraying them.  He didn’t really think Sirius would betray them anyway.  At least he hoped that his godfather wouldn’t.  They went and found the rooms that had been set up for them.  Rather than going to lie down in their separate rooms, however, they both laid down on the bed in Harry’s, still dressed, and fell asleep on top of the covers.  Draco had set an alarm, as well as requesting that Tawly wake them at 6.30pm.
Hermione had expected a no.  If Teddy really had no contact with his godfather since he a baby, and had such an emotional connection with the one image that her talking about his godfather had distressed him, she would have thought he’d want to keep it.  Maybe Teddy wasn’t like that, although the number of photos scattered around this place, made her doubt it.  This was obviously a family that like photographic mementos.  There were dozens of them on the walls and scattered on the mantelpiece.  She didn’t press, deciding her best course of action with this woman was to seem detached from the situation.  She got up calmly and slowly started to make her way back towards the front door.  As she walked through the hall this time, Hermione made an effort to get a better look at some of pictures.  There were lots of Teddy over the years, many of them seeming to have been taken abroad.  The sunshine in the photos felt brighter and warmer than what she was used to in England, and the scenery and buildings had a distinctly foreign feel.  There was one where Teddy looked to be about 13, dancing on, of all people’s, Draco Malfoy’s feet.  It appeared to have been taken at a party, possibly a wedding.  Malfoy was dressed in stunning, and no doubt expensive dress robes, a wedding band glinting on his ring finger.  That Teddy had been in contact with the Death Eater she’d known at school, was surprising, but not completely outside of the realm of possibilities.  He was related to both Andromeda and Teddy.  It wasn’t that photo that really caught her eye, however.   The one that really piqued her interest was of Andromeda Tonks and a person she thought she recognised as Narcissa Malfoy, sunbathing by a pool.  Teddy was playing in the water with Draco Malfoy, again, but Teddy was younger in this photo, maybe four.  Teddy’s hair matched the pointy Slytherin’s when she first looked.  Then the young child turned towards whoever was taking the photo and splashed towards the camera, laughing as his hair changed to the ever familiar scruffy looking black.
“Yeah, it’s not the most interesting way to spend a night certainly.  But at least with it taking this long, Lee has a chance to get here.”
“He has my mother though.”  Malfoy whispered, eyes closing at the admission of helplessness, but he lowered his wand.
Harry pushed into the house, past the elf who disappeared with a crack.  Harry was unsure whether it was upstairs to warn Malfoy or down to the kitchen or basement to hide.  He walked through the passages and past the portraits that had once been so familiar to him, to the room that Draco had made into his study back after the war.  The people in the paintings all seemed to be ignoring him which suited Harry.  Unlike the Hogwarts paintings, the ones at the Manor didn’t seem to run and gossip when something broke the routine, or if they did, they were a lot more discreet about it.
“They’re lovely fingers.” Harry said from the door, and Draco startled.  Harry walked over to Draco and kneeled next the piano, pulling his hands off the keys and holding them between his. Draco looked at him and sighed.
“Tara told me yesterday that I was allowed to be a mess too.  That you and Draco don’t have the monopoly on it.”  Blaise smiled.
Sirius’ thoughts were rather less pragmatic.  “You know who wins…”  Sirius started then stopped and winced.  Remus had kicked him under the table.  Remus knew all to well about Sirius’ penchant for gambling and definitely did not approve of him using Draco and Harry’s knowledge in such away.  At least before Sirius’ lack of money had stopped some of the worst of his excesses, having access to the Black Fortune did not bode well for Sirius’ self-restraint on that front.  Maybe he would have to have a word with Harry and Draco about being careful in what information they let slip.  Things that could potentially help them ensure some people didn’t get hurt was one thing, encouraging Sirius was another entirely.
“Urr…  Hermione, you’re working from a few faulty assumptions.” Harry knew the only way he was going to be able to explain this was with at least half the truth.  “I’ve been in a relationship for the last two years, and moved out of Grimmauld officially about 18 months ago, although I was pretty much living with them for a while before that.”  He looked down at his tea, stirring the liquid with the teaspoon he’d left in the cup, as he said this, not wanting to meet her eyes.
“Lie down.  Do you want me to stroke your back till you go back to sleep? I promise I’ll still be here in the morning.  I just had to go to the toilet.  I didn’t go anywhere.”
“Exactly.”  Draco said superiously.  Clearly pleased with both being right and Sirius agreeing with him.
“Thank you.  I don’t think I could have walked in their again if anything was left to remind me of…”
Whilst Harry did this, Malfoy walked over to the piles of paint tins that the elves had left by the door and started picking out the colours he wanted.  “So, how exactly do we do this.  I don’t know how to paint walls with magic.  Do you?”
“Why?” Blaise eventually managed to ask.  The intensity of the situation was starting to get to him.
“He’s two.  The fact that we only had one, and it happened at home makes it butterflies and roses to me.”
“That’s it, Tom.  We’ve got you.”  It was a different voice to the one before.  This one sounded more like the pureblood Slytherins who looked down on him.  The ones who hated him because he was a mudblood.  But that wasn’t right.  He wasn’t muggleborn.  The man in the shack… his… Uncle… He was a wizard. His mother… she’d been…..
“Come on then, you.  Enough of this for the moment.  We can talk all of this over with Tara properly when she gets here.  She can chastise us for being ridiculous and then when he gets home Blaise can repeat the sentiments.  The least we can do is provide them with something nice to eat so that we can hopefully stave off the worst of it.”
So I've finished my insane two weeks of studying and hopefully will be able to get the last couple of chapters written and up over the next week or so.  I think there are just two chapters left, but it depends on how long they end up being.
None of them, especially Draco and Harry, were happy about the return of the rest of the school.  It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want to see his friends, he did.  He had missed them, and he felt incredibly guilty for disappearing on them like that, especially on Christmas, but he knew that the happy bubble he’d been living in with Draco and Blaise would have to end.  That they’d have to go back to pretending they hated each other.  They would have to go back to sleeping separately.  None of them knew how they would actually manage that, but no matter how much they thought on the issue, they couldn’t come up with a good solution.  The best they could think of was just to push through it.  It was morosely that that packed up their things from the room.  The room seemed to be sulking with them but didn’t try to keep them there, or at least the door was still apparent.  They said their goodbyes at the door and then Harry made his way up to the tower with his things as Blaise and Draco walked hand in hand with their way down to the dungeon.
The look of amazement in Malfoy’s eyes when Harry said this made Harry sure he’d done the right thing.  He took hold of Draco’s hands and squeezed them.  Harry didn’t know how but he was going to fix this for Malfoy.  But he knew he’d try his damned hardest to do so.
“Harry.  Ron’s just angry.  Honestly, I’m angry too.  But I don’t want you to leave again without saying anything.  I just… I want to understand.  You clearly haven’t lived in complete isolation.  You’ve obviously seen Teddy and Andromeda more than once over the years, you call his mother Cissa for crying out loud. The woman who used to look down at us as if we were nothing but filth. You say you went to Malfoy’s ex’s wedding.  You spend time with his friends.  I just don’t get why, if they could be in your life, we couldn’t even get a word from you to say that you were okay?”
“You are devious Hugo.  I’ll give it a go, what’s the worst that can happen? My potion’s grade improves?”
“Yeah well, we’ve been seeing each other since before him and his fiancée even started dating again.   So really I’m just as much of a bastard as he his.”
“Sirius… If I pass you my wand, to prove I’m not going to try and hex you, will you let me get something out of my bag.”  Harry said, marvelling at the fact that he hadn’t thought to show his godfather the items of his father’s that had thankfully made the trip with him.
Hermione had meant to keep her revelation from the day from Ron, until she had more proof.  Unfortunately, as soon as her husband arrived home, he could tell something was up.  It was one of the consequences of knowing someone more than half your life.  She’d managed to get Hugo and Rose to bed earlier, but her racing thoughts had left her pacing around the kitchen with a gin and tonic in hand.
Hermione felt stunned by everything Harry had said.  She’d wanted more information, but what she got wasn’t what she expected.  It was both too much, and not enough to satisfy her curiosity, posing more questions that answers.  It was if a stranger was talking to her.  None of the memories he described fit properly with her own from that time.   She wanted to argue with him, to tell him he was wrong.  That his memory was playing tricks on him.  She wasn’t so sure it was though, that maybe she had been looking back at that time through rose-tinted glasses.  Mostly though, she wanted the stranger in front of her to turn back into Harry.  She wanted her friend back in her life.  But he was walking away again.  Back to the person she could only think of with disgust.  Harry was right about one thing; she didn’t think she could accept Draco Malfoy as anything other than a coward who’d followed Voldemort.  “Are you going to tell us where you’re going this time?” She appealed, wanting some way to be able to contact him, if he was determined to leave.
“Remember when you used to jump out of bed at the crack of dawn to help me make breakfast. What happened to that person?”  Harry grinned, remembering his enthusiastic little girl practically bouncing with energy while he cooked breakfast back in the Oxfordshire house.
“I think it’s best if I wait a while then.”  Narcissa said, releasing the hug.  “It’s not that I don’t want to be there with you.  I would just prefer you make the decision to accept me back into your life when you’re not upset.  If your Harry agrees, I will stay at the townhouse, however.  That way you can reach me the second you want me.”
Draco absently cast a stinging hex causing Harry to drop his sandwich in shock.  Luckily, it lands on his plate.  Draco is suddenly on his feet; a look of absolute horror on his face.
“Mrs Tonks” Hermione started as she sat down, wanting to get straight to the point. “I’m here because I bumped into your grandson a couple of days ago.”
“I’m tired.  I’m tired of having feelings that I can’t say out loud.  I’m tired of people hating me.” There was a long pause before Draco finished.  “I’m just tired.”
So I got over my writers block.  I'm sorry if the grammar is patchy in places but I need to recheck through it again really but probably won't get a chance till the weekend and now I've finished the thing I want to get it up and see what people think.  I have a short epilogue written that I will either have up later this evening, or at somepoint tomorrow.
Draco burst out laughing. “Yeah, that sounds about right.  The laws of nature would break before Pansy allowed that to happen.” Pansy absolutely did not want kids.
Draco resented the insinuation.  “Slytherin does not equal fucking Death Eater.  Or are you too stupid to realise that?  Besides, not all those that are evil are Death Eaters.”
Friday came all too quickly.  Draco apparated them both into his usual alley, although Harry complained that they were going to be far too early.
“Harry, are you going to tell me what’s been going on with you?  You’ve been avoiding everyone since you got out of this place and we’re concerned.”
“Absolutely.  She’s been treating a friend of mine for a while.”  Harry didn’t tell Robards how long he’d been seeing her himself.  That would lead to questions he didn’t want to answer.
Scorpius stepped out of the grate into the Leaky Cauldron.  A call came from behind the bar and he looked up to see Hannah standing there.
“Oh, and Angelina,” Harry added.  “Any chance you could, you know, not mention this to anyone right now.”
At this point Harry couldn’t hold himself back any longer.  He’d crept quietly down the stairs during their discussion.  Walking through the open door to the living room and saw a head disappear from the fire and Ginny turned shocked to look at him.
“So I’ve been told.” And told and told, Harry thought to himself.  It was one of the first truthful things he’d ever learnt about his parents – he didn’t count anything the Dursley’s had told him.  He looked like his father, but he had his mother’s eyes.  “Siri thought I was James when I found him.”
“You know, the three of us.  We’re here for you.  Whatever you need.  Harry and Draco have an abundance of free time, and the last thing I need is them being bored in this place.  I’ll end up coming home one day to find the whole place up in smoke if they don’t have something to occupy themselves with.  And they adore Teddy.”
“Clearly kidnapping their great and precious saviour and corrupting him.”  Draco resorted to humour and sarcasm, although the words cut a little close to what was more than likely the truth.  For all of their fooling around and messing about in the castle Draco had actually been frightened when the Aurors first appeared.  It had brought back memories of his arrest straight after the war.  He wasn’t ready to admit out loud yet, even to Harry, although he was sure his husband understood without him needing to say it.  Just like he’d understood Harry and his friends’ need to be a bit reckless once they were safely hidden under his potions and charm work.
Blaise did as he was told, although he had no clue what the two of them wanted.  Getting closer was both something he desired and wanted to avoid at the same time.  He downed the amber liquid Harry had poured.  Harry then topped up all their glasses.  Alcohol was absolutely the solution to his conflicted feelings for the moment.
Lily looked up at Scorpius who was blushing.  She moved to sit up, disentangling herself from Scorpius’s arms as he tried to do the same.  They managed to move to sit next to each other rather than the much more intimate way they were seated before.  Lily kept hold of his hand, however.
Ron, Hermione and Ginny all looked at each other stunned.  What the hell had happened?  Harry had just stormed out the house without hardly a word.
Harry opened his eyes.  He felt disorientated.  Even more disorientated than he’d felt when he and Draco had ended up back in 1981, which was saying something.  His mind was trying to put together what had happened.  Looking around the room he spotted Draco.  He seemed to be in a similar state to Harry.  Then he noticed the two older wizards.  Their wands were raised.  Aggression all over their features.  The memories hit him like an assault.  No.  They couldn’t be allowed to do it.  He doesn’t care what the plan was anymore.  He pulled his aching body, with as much speed as he could manage, towards the naked boy in the centre of the room.  Draco was next to him, clearly having come to the same realisation and done exactly the same thing.  They had to protect Tom.  They had promised.
“So we’re agreed we can’t blame ourselves for not extrapolating from one tiny change in Harry’s activities that he was a miserable git.  Let’s move onto the next task in operation stop my wife overthinking things so we can actually get some sleep.”
Hermione remembered reading that passage to Rose for the first time, then telling her about how her and Ron had become friends after battling a troll in the Hogwarts bathrooms all those years ago.  The scene from the book had been so similar, but not quite.  There were other scenes like that, now she thought about it.  The whole fifth book had been about Fred Wolfstar rescuing his best friend from the bottom of a giant lake.  The inspiration could only be the sodding second task from fourth year.  Evan James wasn’t exactly a subtle pseudonym either, not if you really thought about it.  Did that mean the dedication was meant for her and Ron?  She could feel tears welling up in her eyes.
“Yes.” Hermione placed her hands on her hips and glared at Ron crossly.  She definitely knew the answer and it more than likely involved her husband having too big a mouth on him when he was two pints in.
“Nope.  You suggested it.  You know what they’re like.  Besides, it would make a great photo for the album.”
Draco manages to keep Teddy entertained in the soft play area for more than half an hour before the toddler starts getting fractious.  He brings him to the table where Harry and Blaise were sat watching them.  Blaise pulls out a snack and the colouring book for Teddy, who happily starts munching on slices of apple and scribbling with an air of intense concentration.  Draco looks exhausted.
Draco could feel Harry stood behind him as he waited for the lift doors to open.  The lift was empty when it arrived at the ground flood and he stepped in and pressed the button for the 3
“The baby.  I think the baby is coming.” Lily was nearly in tears with her fear, and Harry’s alarm at what was happening rose to meet hers.
I know I said I wasn't going to be able to post again for a while, but this chapter was almost finished anyway and I couldn't help myself.  Now I really will, in all likliness, be disappearing for two weeks.  I have a ridiculous amount of reading to do, a presentation to write, and two essays to plan, all on top of two weeks of lectures.
“Probably not.” Harry snorted at how ridiculously upper-class Draco sounded in that moment.  “But I asked the bartender for something expensive and pretentious.”
“Can’t be bothered.” Draco said and slumped into Harry’s side. Snuggling into the warmth and scent that was entirely Harry.  He felt like he could fall asleep just like this. Knowing that Harry was there.
“Siri… I can smell… Harry…?  Where is he?  Do you have him… Dumbledore… he told me he’d placed him somewhere safe.”
“Come on then you,” Harry said, putting his arm around Ginny and helping her to her feet.  “Off to the hospital with you.”
“This is a mistake” Draco sighed before moving again, this time towards Harry and pulling him into a kiss filled with everything they’d both bottled up for the 20 lost years.
“And who exactly would buy from me.  No one trusts me.  I don’t even really know why you’re still here at all…”
“Okay.  Not the Headmaster.  You’re right.  We can’t trust him.”  Harry said.  He felt like he was talking down someone from the edge of jumping off a cliff.
“I did.  But I can still admonish the quality of the wine being served, even if I’m not going to touch the stuff.”
Blaise lifted Harry and carried him the few short strides to the bed where Draco was lying. He was so pale.  His left arm was tightly bandaged, and he had tubes that appeared to have been inserted into several of his veins, with potions slowly dripping down into them.  He tucked Harry into Draco’s right side, then laced their fingers together and hooked Harry’s ankle around Draco’s.  Other than being on the wrong side of each other, it was how they slept most nights.  Blaise kissed them both lightly on the forehead.  He was satisfied when he saw Harry edge a little closer into Draco.
“Absolutely.  It’ll be fun.  We can get a nice betting circle set up.  In fact, I’ll bet you 10 galleons that the first time you appear in public with me and Pans at least one paper will be speculating about how we’ve brainwashed you into being a sex slave within our harem.  Also that Teddy is your love child and that you tragically and heroically sacrificed your entire happiness and future to care for him according to the wishes of his mother’s will.”  Draco had to admit to himself, as far as the Prophet was concerned at least, his suggestions weren’t too far-fetched.  He’d kept a collection of the articles about Harry over the years, they made for an amusing scrap book, and none of the suggestions made had been any more ridiculous than Blaise’s.
There was a shuffling behind the half-opened door and Harry came into sight, to everyone’s relief.  “It’s okay Tawly.  I’ll let them in.  Just make sure they can’t get to the wing with the bedroom where Tom is.  Draco’s in with him.  Could you get them something to eat?  Some soup or something similarly light and simple.”
This was an admission that Draco didn’t want to make, but something in Harry’s love filled eyes made it impossible for him to keep it secret. “My therapist thought that the best way for me to deal with my fear of fire was to confront it.  I don’t think she meant me to actually learn to cast the spell that nearly killed me.  During those last 6 months I worked on it.  I know it was reckless, but I wasn’t exactly in a good place then and couldn’t bring myself to care.  I just needed control over something when it felt like everything else was falling apart.” Neither of them like bringing up their 6-month separation or anything that happened during that time.  It always led to one or other of them feeling guilty about what had happened between them.  It couldn’t be avoided right now though.
“We don’t need him.”  Draco interrupted, scowling at the passed-out man on the sofa.  “We’ve prevented him going to Azkaban.  Isn’t that enough?”
“That sounds acceptable” his father replied, tight lipped and clenching his hands slightly beside his side before walking out of the store without making eye contact with Mr Potter at all.
“No, you pretty much showed up, and I took you to one of the spare rooms to sleep it off.  Like I said, you could barely stand”
Harry and Blaise worked on the illusions whilst Draco poured over the new book.  They had almost got it down when Draco exclaimed.  “Oh Merlin.  Room, you are the best.  Seriously.  Like the most amazing room in existence.”
“No, I suppose not.”  Malfoy didn’t sound like he cared though and irked Harry.  This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.  Malfoy was supposed to care, and he needed to do something about it.  The war had taken enough from him.  It wasn’t going to take his school yard rivalry either.  He knew it was an illogical way to think but it didn’t matter to him.
“What do I do instead?  I can’t sit around the house.  Me and Draco would drive each other insane.  Well more insane.  We’d probably end up killing each other.  And he can’t leave.”
“My pleasure Draco.  And Harry, I need to give you my thanks for the advanced copy of your latest book.  My children absolutely adore it.  Although they have made me start reading the whole series to them again from the beginning.”
“Lily, I think we need to slow down for a moment before we get carried away.”  She looked hurt when he said this and started to pull away from him.  “Wait Lily, I don’t mean we have to stop, just…” his eyes wavered downwards.
Draco pulled himself reluctantly out of the warmth and comfort of his bed and made his way down the corridor to Callie’s room.  When he got there, she was bawling her eyes out, her right cheek was puffy and bright red.  He accioed the Calpol, that Harry had bought from a muggle store.  There weren’t any pain potions that were safe for babies this age and Harry swore that the muggle version worked for teething pain.
“Stop it you two.  You’re scaring them.  Can you please show us in, or I can? I know the way.  It’s not been that long since I was here.”  Teddy said, jovially.  Grinning at the shocked students.
year, that had only gotten worse through the war, had eased slightly at the thought of getting this potion to work.  The excitement was infectious, and Harry found himself being practically dragged down to the potions workshop.  When they arrived, Harry saw the potion was still sat in the cauldron where it had been abandoned the day before.
“Let’s go back to bed.  I’m not due back at work for at least six weeks and I’ll think about asking for a transfer from active duty, at least for a while.”
“Yes, it is growing rather well.  The kids seem to enjoy working here as much as with the magical plants.  I was thinking of trying to get permission to take a small group of the best muggle studies and herbology students on a field trip to the Eden Project as a post exam treat.”
The room let out what Harry swore was a small cough, and a fireplace that hadn’t been there before appeared, complete with its own little pot of floo powder.
Malfoy took a long deep breath with his eyes closed.   He looked so fragile and vulnerable to Harry.  It made him wish that he could wrap his arms around him and let him stay cocooned in the library.  ‘His little recluse’, Draco had referred to himself as.  It was true, but Harry didn’t want a Malfoy trapped in the trauma of the past.  The day’s he liked Malfoy best, were the ones where he was reminded of the boy he used to be.  Sharp quips and sarcasm.  Someone he could rile up, and who knew just how to push his own buttons in return. “Okay, think I’m ready.”  Malfoy finally said and started take deliberate steps towards the open door.  When he actually stepped into the corridor he froze, and Harry could feel the other man’s panic rising.  His breathing had become rapid and erratic and he looked like he was about to bolt.  Harry did the only thing he could think of.  He grabbed Malfoy’s hand and squeezed it gently.  It was obviously the right thing to do.  Malfoy started to calm down.
“It’s my job to see things from an outside perspective.  You have an illness.  One that isn’t your fault.  But it is part of who you are.  And you have been brilliant at accepting that.  But there are some things I know you want to do that you just can’t bring yourself to without additional help.  You said your mother doesn’t want you to be on your medication when you see her.  Is that what she actually said?”
Harry talked briefly about going to buy paints that afternoon.  Fabricating a story based on a half-truth was definitely easier than lying outright.  Harry would rather they didn’t talk about him at all though.  He managed to steer the conversation onto Ron and Hermione’s day eventually.  It was much easier to listen and nod at the right points than it was to talk about himself.  He even found himself enjoying their company.  Sitting here in a slightly crowded pub, Harry felt in a better than he’d done in weeks.  He knew he’d probably been neglecting both of his friends recently, with all the time he spent in the Manor’s library with the blonde man he knew they hated.  He’d spent the best part of a year with only the two of them for company, and he thought he was probably being unfair in not wanting to use his newly acquired freedom over his life, to spend time with them now.  They didn’t always spend their time badgering him about his life and what he was going to do with it.  Sometimes they were happy just talking about the things they’d enjoyed during their day.  The things that amused them and made them happy.  It wasn’t their fault that the only thing that seemed to make him happy these days he couldn’t talk to them about.  Harry tried to resolve himself to try harder with them, but in his heart, he knew that he probably wouldn’t.
Harry quickly found a spoon with blackcurrant jam placed in his mouth before he could protest.  It was delicious, despite the fact that he still felt slightly sick from the amount he’d eaten at the Burrow.
Hermione nervously stood outside Andromeda Tonks’ house.  It hadn’t taken long to track her down.  Tonks wasn’t exactly a common wizarding surname and she’d lived in the same place since the end of the war.  Her and Edward Lupin were the only registered residents, Edward Lupin having just finished his 6
“Well I’m not exactly happy that you kept the fact that you were having flashbacks at work to yourself.”
The white blinding pain that Harry experiences is something I've written using my own experience of chronic pain.  I have CRPS and the worst manifestation for me has always been the uncontrollable episodes of neuropathy that make it feel like my leg has electricity shooting up from the original injury that triggered the condition.  When these episodes not there is literally nothing anyone can do and the pain wipes out all ability to think. I'm lucky in that I have fabulous doctors and a treatment regime that works for me. I know that others with chronic pain aren't so lucky, and with lockdown my treatment has been interrupted so I'm having more of these episodes than I've had in years.  I just wanted to write something here to give my support to all people who live with chronic pain.
“I wanted you Draco.  I’ve always wanted you.” And with that Harry dragged Draco up off the floor and into his lap.  Their mouths met and they kissed hungrily.  Harry lightly raked his nails through Draco’s hair before trailing them down his back and allowing them to rest firmly on the other man’s hips.
“But I’m not.” Lily started and her hand came up to his face, turning it so he was forced to look into her eyes.  “I’m scared shitless.  I saw some of what mum went through having Freddy.  It looked like it fucking hurt.  I don’t want that.  Then I’m worried that I’ll go through that and take one look at her and not be able to give her up, like Tabitha did.  And then that I’ll resent her the same way Pansy seems to.  I’m petrified that I’ll mess everything up.  That we’ll never go to uni, that we won’t even finish school.  That I’ll have this little girl who I can’t love enough to overcome all of the crap.  Who’ll hate me because she’ll know I resent her.  I just have to tell myself that I’ll be strong enough.  That you’ll help me be strong enough.  That Dad and Draco will help.”
“No, I had no idea.  Your presence at my son’s house was a little bit of a shock, frankly.”  Narcissa replied, a slightly bemused expression on her face.  “Now, we can’t stay here standing at the gates all evening.  Are you going to invite me in?”
Draco closed his eyes and shook his head before he spoke.  “You’ll be the death of me Potter” Draco sighed before sitting up and removing his shirt.  “Tonight you’re mine.  Whoever’s you may be tomorrow is of no concern.”  Draco said this last bit in a whisper and with such bitterness in his voice.  Harry wished things were different.  So he said the only thing he could.
Harry gave James enough money for lunch and his school things then left with his younger two through the back of the pub, into the busy shopping centre of Wizarding London.
“Fine.” Hermione huffed.  “Let’s talk about your love life instead.  How are your partners?  Ron said he met one of them, but he wouldn’t say much.  Just that he seemed a little posh.  Oh and thank you for the chocolate cake.  It was amazing.”
“’Mione!”  A shout came from the living room.  “Hermione.  Come here. Quickly.  I can’t fucking believe it.”
“Yes, you do.” Pansy said smiling. Then added “I wish I could make this whole situation easier for you.  But you’ve been through more crap than anyone else I know and have survived when most would have crumbled.  If anyone could help a pair of scared teenagers through this, it’s you.” Then she leaned in and kissed him on the forehead, leaving him to get himself cleaned and dressed whilst she made the tea.
“I love you too Lils,” Harry replied, then kissing his daughter once on the head he left, hoping she would sleep but knowing that it was probably unlikely.  She’d probably spend half the night up and worrying about what decision she would make.   He knew he’d be doing the same.
“Visiting.” Harry quickly reassured.  “Ron’s dad got hurt.  It’s why we left just before term ended.  I got to my godfather’s place with the Weasleys and it felt like I was being shredded into tiny pieces and I just passed out.”
It took over five minutes for the door of the room to open and Draco to walk in.  Harry’s legs were burning with the strain of staying half in the fire. “Draco, can I come through please?  I want to talk to you.”  It took an immense amount of effort for Harry not to let the pain show in his voice or expression.
“I know I am.  That’s one of the differences.  I can see it.  That’s why I wanted to come and see you today.  I spoke to Draco about it this morning and how I thought it was a good idea for me to come and speak to you alone as soon as possible.  He agreed, although I know it made him anxious.  I think he’s petrified that this will all fall apart again.  I don’t know how to reassure him.”
The one good thing to come from Dumbledore’s letter, was that Sirius had gone from being suspicious of the two of them, to distrust bordering on hatred for the old headmaster, fast enough to give them minor emotional whiplash.  He had promised both Draco and Harry that he would do everything in his power to keep them and little Harry safe.  It not only pleased Harry that he had his godfather on their side but made things a lot easier.  They didn’t need to use the contingency plan to escape Sirius, and Sirius was able to help them look after the baby.  The three of them actually muddled together with taking care of the baby pretty well.  With Sirius firmly in their corner, Draco and Harry felt they could trust him enough to leave little Harry alone with him.  It meant that the two of them were able to pop out to Diagon and grab some wizarding things they needed.  Including an owl, a subscription to the prophet, and most importantly, a wand that Harry could use without the trace on it.  They thought there was a good chance that the trace on both Harry and Draco’s wands from Ollivander’s wouldn’t break until little Harry and Draco turned 17, so both were pretty useless.  Draco took Harry to the same shop that he’d been taken to, to get his first wand, and they quickly got Harry a new wand made.  In fact they decided to get two, and Draco got a second one he could use as well.  Harry had learned the risks of losing his wand in a fight the hard way.  Had it not been for Voldemort’s arrogance, he would never have escaped the graveyard.  They would leave the Hawthorn and Holly wands in Gringotts the first chance they got.  Those wands belonged to their old lives.  They were a reminder of the future both of them were working to prevent.
“Sorry, Harry I didn’t mean to imply.  It’s just…”  Hermione took a deep breath.  “So that’s what he has then.  Bipolar disorder.”
“I don’t know.  I’m not sure you’d know a good wine if it hit you in the face with a sommelier screaming the details of its bouquet at you.”
“Better than you, by the looks of it.”  She snorted in reply.  Tara may be their therapist, but she was also their friend.  He’d been seeing her for two years and had introduced her to Draco a little more than 18 months ago; after Harry had first come to the Manor and seen first-hand the damage the war and Azkaban had done to Draco’s already ropy mental health.
Blaise maneuvered Harry into the bathroom, which was his safe place to talk with Blaise.  Blaise sat on the floor an pulled Harry into his lap.
“Fine.  Instant communication if we need you.”  Harry said, knowing that Blaise would not take no for an answer.
So this is a short chapter.  I originally had planned a much longer section here, covering several years in hiding, but I'm struggling to write it and it's not greatly important to the overall story. So instead there is just this glimpse of the first meeting between Teddy, Andi, Harry, Draco and Narcissa.   At some point I might decide to try and write about the years in hiding again and the relationships Harry and Draco develop with their family and the friends they make.  There will be a large time skip when I eventually sort the next chapter, which is mostly written, but is currently very rough.
“But you have pushed yourself beyond what I would have ever thought possible.  And I know it wasn’t for your own sake, even if I think it’s done you a lot of good.  It was for me, wasn’t it?”
A potion was thrust into his hands and he swallowed it, not caring what it was as long as it took away this pain.
“Oh thank Merlin.”  Draco exclaimed and threw himself into Harry’s arms the second they entered the room.
“Okay, but you’re getting washed up and dressed and coming down to lunch.  You’ve missed breakfast and you should eat something.  It will make you feel better.”
“Yeah they died.  Final battle.  They both rushed off like idiots to fight, with a month-old infant at home, and got themselves killed.  I know everyone says it was the brave and noble thing to do, but to me it seems completely selfish and reckless.”  Teddy was really struggling to hold back tears now and Justin didn’t know what to do.  He just kept his hand resting on Teddy’s.  “But it’s okay, it’s not like I remember them.  Harry doesn’t really remember his parents either.  And Draco’s dad was an awful human being by all accounts, even if his mum is amazing.  And I have Andi and Cissa, and Harry and Dray.  I might not call anyone mum and dad, but I don’t think it really matters.” Teddy sniffed loudly and had to pause to rub the tears out of his eyes before he continued. “Fuck, this took a deep turn.  Confessing all my deepest secrets.  I swear I’m not really like this most of the time.  I promise I’m much more fun.”  It was said in a self-deprecating, half jovial way, as if Teddy was trying to make light of the situation.
Ginny was quickly whisked up to the Labour ward leaving Harry and Lily with little to do but wait.  They went to the cafeteria and got a couple of cups of tea and croissants, then went back up to the waiting area outside the ward.
