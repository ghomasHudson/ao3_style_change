Draco and Harry both turned to find Ron Weasley standing on the corner of the road, dramatically lit beneath a wrought-iron streetlamp. His arms were folded and his hair was blazing like an avenging fire.
Harry supposed that seeing double was better than the alternative, which was feeling like half his body was being smashed by trolls. “I might need a hand,” he admitted.
“Right, sorry,” Draco said, face settling into a cold mask. “Merlin forbid the great Harry Potter admit he’s anything other than fine.”
“Like what?”
"What -- er -- what else did I say?"
“To be clear,” Draco murmured. “The feeling is mutual, yes?”
“When he came back from France, he got a job at St. Mungo’s – but in his first week alone, three people tried to kill him.”
"Er, yes, the first."
"Er, good, yeah."
"He's perfectly all right, as you can see, Minerva," said Malfoy, in a slow, soothing voice Harry'd only heard from him once, on the other fucking set of fucking stairs he'd fallen down. "I'll give him a once-over to be on the safe side. Most helpful thing you both can do is give him space."
"Let me just --"
Malfoy moved several feet away. "I'm sorry," he said finally. "I understand why you're scared."
“Is he quite all right?” he heard McGonagall ask.
"Oh, I loved her, of course,” Harry said, “who wouldn’t?” And only when Malfoy's shoulders relaxed a bit did he realize he'd been nervous. Nervous that Harry wouldn't like his friend? The thought was oddly touching.
"But -- imagine being a child and looking at the news, and seeing your father's name plastered everywhere, called a villain, an evil madman, public enemy number one. Even if he deserved it, I imagine it would be... difficult."
"That curse died when I killed Voldemort," Harry said, and then winced. Really? Was he breaking out the big guns already? "And anyway, Baisley held the job for years."
“Glad we’re in agreement,” Malfoy said. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, back to studying for you – and Franny, you’ll want to turn that diagram the other way round. Remember what I said the other day? Purple on top –”
“Excellent,” said Roberts, rubbing his hands together. “I’ve got temporary Floo authorization for the Debs’ fireplace, so we can go straight there.”
And lastly, well, pain... it was personal. It permeated everything Harry did, it dictated how he lived his days, he spent an inordinate amount of time trying to cater to his pain, and even though anyone who looked at him could probably see his pain, it still felt oddly private. He wanted to keep it to himself, he wanted to hide it. The Healers at St. Mungo's were professionals, they were impersonal -- but Malfoy? With Malfoy, it'd be personal.
"If you open this for me, I'll answer anything you like," he said.
"She -- certainly looks like Ron," Neville said. "Cheer up, Harry, the Hogsmeade weekend's right around the corner, and didn't you say you're staying the night? You'll have all of Sunday with them -- and with Rosie's new teeth."
"That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me," Harry said. The rain was falling more thickly now, big fat drops that slid down the back of Harry's coat and made him shiver. They were standing outside the Three Broomsticks and he could hear laughter coming from inside, could anticipate the warmth and the smoky smell and the taste of mead, and how good it would be to see Ron and Hermione and Rosie. But despite all that, despite the rain, he found that he was in no hurry.
"Oh stop, oh don't, I'm going to vomit again," Hermione begged. She was shaking with laughter. "She always has sensible names for such horrors, what was she calling this?"
Any good mood Harry had been courting suddenly plummeted. "Love to," he said, trying to channel some of Malfoy's coolness, "but I can't fly."
And whoever he was, who could love him?
"Sorry I didn't think of it earlier," Neville said, releasing Harry as they reached the top of the stairs.
Harry thought he should be insulted by this, but it was only the truth. He went round behind Malfoy's desk and sat down, enjoying both the sweet smell of lilies and the odd experience of being behind someone else's desk. He clanked around in his pockets for a potion and drank it as Malfoy came over with two glasses.
"Oh, honestly," said Hermione, at the same time Ron said, "Bit dramatic, eh, mate?"
“Ditto,” said Draco drily, and Harry laughed. They sat quietly for a moment and then Draco said, “Look, today was… Not nice. I admit I was – well, I was a bit worried I might be…”
Ron coughed. "Excuse me?"
Malfoy looked surprised and caught-out, and Harry gave him a cheeky grin as he made his way back to the Floo. It cheered him a bit to think of elegant Malfoy swooping about with a whistle.
"Just you try and keep up."
Malfoy waited until they’d finished crossing the bridge, had made it down the small set of stairs, and were walking across the green towards Hogsmeade before he spoke.
The fall, it hadn't come.
Harry, caught off guard, stuttered, "Oh -- I mean -- yes."
Timmy raised his head and said, loudly and sadly, "I was you!"
Further observations were slow to come because he was too occupied with trying to pass out again, hoping to step right back into oblivion so he wouldn’t have to face the shrill screaming of his indignant body, but it was a no-go. He was conscious, and getting more conscious by the moment, unfortunately.
“How will we get in his office?” Neville said, wringing his hands. “It’ll be heavily warded.”
A moment later, Chloé Barnes crept into his room and stood at the foot of his bed. She was so small, such a child, with enormous, watery eyes and a trembling mouth. She clutched a homemade get-well card in her hand, covered with flowers she'd clearly drawn herself.
“About fucking time,” Harry muttered, and finally, finally, finally, let himself sink into nothingness.
"I am, actually. I was trained in France, after -- after the war. I can show you my certification record if you'd like."
“It’s just me,” hissed Negasi, slipping out from the living room. “I popped in through a back window.” He noticed the man on the floor. “Blimey, you don’t waste time, do you?”
"I know."
“Er, I think so,” he said, wincing at a flashback of himself tackling the goon in the Ragged Pony and hitting the floor; then at another memory of having his arm wrenched brutally behind his back; then another memory of hitting the basement wall. “I certainly didn’t treat it kindly. Draco said he thought it’d have to be immobilized.”
Harry didn't look at him, because he was currently leaning heavily on his arm and if he'd turned their faces would have been far too close for comfort. "In case you haven't noticed, I'm a bit paranoid."
"All Slytherins, though, I bet," Ron said.
It occurred to Harry, for the first time, to say, "Thank you for that. And thanks for fetching Mal -- Professor Malfoy."
He'd wheedled a week and a half's worth of pain potions from his regular St. Mungo's potionist, twenty-two doses in total, and the timing worked out perfectly to cover him from about eight in the morning until ten in the evening -- if he took two a day, as he was supposed to. He'd begged and begged his potionist to deliver to Hogwarts, but they'd explained -- first patiently, then less patiently -- that as Hogwarts had its own official potionist duty-bound to serve the Hogwarts community, they couldn't legally cross-medicate, especially not the kind of heavily-regulated potion Harry took.
"He's been living in France, hasn't he?" Hermione said. "I met a French Healer at a meeting last week who spoke so highly of him I had to repeat his name a few times to make sure we were talking of the same person."
“Let’s get you sat down,” Negasi said, exchanging a look with Draco, who still had a hand on Harry’s back. “My office is just there. You might remember it, Harry, seeing as it used to be yours. I’ve redecorated a bit… more badgers, fewer lions, for one thing…”
about me?"
Say something, Harry urged him, and then turned the request upon himself: say something, Harry.
Draco passed the dish of butter and then the basket of bread, and Harry, still distracted, momentarily forgot that buttering bread was something he himself had not been able to do with any great success since he’d been injured. He picked up the bread in his good right hand and reached for the butter knife with his left, but managed only to knock it out of the dish. Then he tried to coax his left fingers to hold the bread while he wielded the knife with his right hand, but they hadn’t been taking orders from him well all day and he couldn’t manage to keep it steady. Finally, he put the bread on his plate and tried to weigh it down with his left fist so he could spread butter with his right, but he came down too heavily on the upturned edge of his plate and – like a slapstick nightmare – catapulted his entire dinner onto his lap.
"Yes," he said, looking longingly to the staff table, where he could see his colleagues already finishing up their lunch. "Why?"
"D’you think McGonagall would let me go down this weekend?” Harry said. It was an infuriating part of the job that the professors were not only teachers, but de facto guardians, and getting leave to abandon their charges was a long, tedious, and often unsuccessful process.
“Yeah, at breakfast,” Neville said, “though don’t bother waiting, he’s out for the day.”
"The next day, the same group showed up in my office," Malfoy continued. "To investigate my fireplace and see if was Floo connected. They were -- unnervingly excited to discover that it is."
“No,” said Hermione, “Harry’s not going to be biased like our professors were, are you Harry?”
Harry, who was overdue for his pain potion and in no mood, said, "Just trying to help Slytherin along. They'd never win a point otherwise."
They were at the carriage and Draco climbed up first, then reached down to help haul Harry in and get him situated on the cushioned seat as the thestrals began their jouncing journey back to the castle. It was very dark in the small coach, and the quarters were close. Harry could smell the lingering anise and curry from their dinner, and beneath that, the unmistakable wood-and-amber of Draco’s skin. They were facing one another, knee-to-knee, legs barely touching.
"I haven't had any yet," he said -- which was a lie, there was a slice half-eaten on his plate. Had he been trying to save Harry the awkwardness of magicking what anyone else would simply have taken? Was this his way of trying to make up the argument they'd had the other day about his arm? And since when did Malfoy try and make it up to anyone, for anything?
Harry’s heart stopped. He took a shocked, stumbling step, and at his side Draco surged forward in a cloud of righteous anger, snarling “On what
Neville looked at him. "I've told you, he's not like he was, Harry. I think he's put in a lot of work to leave that part of his life behind."
Neville finally tore his eyes away from the Cute Snakewort and settled into the other lawn chair. “Two of them were plants. Not these kinds of plants, obviously – the bad kind, people pretending to be ill to gain admittance to St. Mungo’s so they could get at Draco. Old… friends of the family, I guess. Angry with him for his betrayal of their values.”
"Oh, well now," Harry said, alarmed. "Let's not -- we're here to learn defense, not --"
“I’m fine,” Draco said quickly. “Barely a scratch on me.”
“No,” Harry said emphatically, as Malfoy said, to Harry, “We will need to eat.”
closer, not because he thought Harry might do an accidental faceplant at any moment.
And had it really come to this? Could Harry no longer tell the difference between flirtation and professional concern? Next he’d be hitting on the poor girl at St. Mungo’s who’d taken his vitals each morning.
"This is the biggest disappointment of my week," Ron said. "I was so looking forward to an hour of pure abuse, just like old times."
"All right," he said, "look, I know I'm -- I know you all know who I am. Maybe your parents know me, or you've read about me in the papers, and I'm probably in your history books, right?" Nods all around. "It's natural to be curious about that and I don't mind answering polite questions in my office. But during class time, all I am is your Professor. I'm here to teach you the skills you need to survive, but I hope you'll never have to use them. I have had to use them, as you know -- but I have never used them lightly. The times I've had to defend myself, well, to be honest, those aren't fun times for me to talk about, and my life's not an adventure story, not for me; for me, it's just my life. And Defensive magic has saved that life more times than I can count. Anytime you see me up here, talking to you, still alive, well, that's Defensive magic at work. You can safely assume that if I'm teaching you a spell, I've probably used it. And that's -- that's all I really want to say about it."
Harry could not have been more surprised if she'd suddenly turned into a Hippogriff and flown away. "You've got to be joking." Oh, but it was all making sense, their stupid questions, the way they'd gone batty when he and Malfoy had spoken in the Great Hall... "Hanna," he said. "Er -- do me a favor, and tell them we're not?"
Why -- why -- why had he thought this was a good idea? Why hadn't he stayed home in his own spooky, horrible house with his spooky, horrible house elf, drunk off his arse by the fireplace, chugging pain potions til he couldn't see and living off his friend's good graces until they tired of him and he died impoverished and alone?
“Boy?” said Roberts, eyebrows shooting up. He looked at Harry. “Does he mean you? Last I checked you were a grown man. Anyway, you’re all right for a bit longer, aren’t you?”
“Dougie?” The voice was closer now.
He did not say anything about himself, and Harry realized his heart had given a little jump.
"Haven't you heard? Your position is cursed," Malfoy drawled.
"Well, at least it will be a new experience for me," Neville said optimistically.
Harry Potter?
“It’s so cute it makes you want to kiss it,” Neville said happily, while his student nodded and beamed. “And then when you do kiss it, it explodes its seeds into your mouth, and then you spit them out, so you’re helping it propagate, it’s really quite a clever design!”
“Think we’re – oh.” Malfoy actually stumbled, and for once it was Harry who had to reach out and steady him. “Oh.
"Merlin, no, the old times were horrible."
“Anyhow, when Nimpkins gets my Patronus, hopefully he’ll be on his way with backup,” Harry said. “Then you can do a proper Auror raid, none of this sneaking about with Hogwarts professors.”
He was supposed to meet Malfoy at Betsy's at 2, but the cobblestones were rain-slick and uneven and by the time he turned the corner and caught sight of Malfoy, it was 2:15 and every muscle in his body was clenched from the tension of trying not to topple over. He tried not to imagine how much easier this would be with a cane; he didn't want to get his hopes up.
At least he knew now beyond a shadow of a doubt that his instincts had been right: Draco was in trouble. He would’ve much rather been wrong but at least he had confirmation that he was on the right track. Too worried and in too much pain to search carefully, Harry flicked his wand and sent all the cabinet doors flying open and all the liquor bottles flying out from the shelves, letting them hover briefly as he examined them and then sending them crashing to the floor when he was finished. The smell of booze was quickly overpowering and he saw nothing out of the ordinary; no hint of spellwork, nothing hidden anywhere.
Until, inevitably, the potions ran out.
"Er -- recently? No. Recently, I was attacked by a staircase."
"Oh," Hermione said, wringing her hands, "all right, I'm sorry. The students are lucky, Harry, I know you'll be brilliant."
But finally, finally, he was done. It was supposed to be a light, sunshine yellow, but chartreuse would have to do. It smelled as his other potions had, anyway, which was a good sign, wasn't it? There was no time like the present to find out. He'd brought biscuits as a food-buffer, and before he'd even poured it into vials, he measured himself out a dose and drank it down, then quickly ate a biscuit.
“Ah,” said Negasi, as his spell flew up through the floorboards and paused above his wand. He and Harry both gaped at it.
A moment later, Malfoy was laughing harder than Harry'd ever seen him do. "Of course," he gasped, "of course this is your idea of fun!"
Pockets and stomach full of potion and biscuits, Harry made his way to the faculty meeting just in time for the opening remarks, which were delivered in a monotone by Professor Soobs, who'd replaced Hagrid as Care of Magical Creatures professor when he'd retired to the mountains with his giant little brother. Neville nodded to him as he came in, and Harry took the seat next to him.
"Well, you'll get your railing, at any rate," Malfoy said. "Are you free before dinner tonight, by the way? I have an idea I'd like to run by you."
Draco sketched a mocking bow. “I’d be honored. Can you stand?”
“Potter!” gasped McGonagall as he thumped up to the faculty table. “What’s happened to –”
"Draco!"
"Professor," one of his first years said as he came in. "Your hair looks like a Harry Potter wig!"
Harry wanted to believe him, he wanted it so badly -- and fuck it. He decided to simply do so.
"Fine, take your time," Harry said. "I've only got homework to grade, classes to teach, stairs to conquer." Whoops, now it was his turn to flush. He hadn't meant to say that last part.
"Well," Harry said, beginning to gather his things, "don't let me stop you, I can --"
“Er – yes.”
Merlin, they were young, the students. Young, and loud, shouting hellos at one another, screaming in delight as they embraced, pounding on the tables. He couldn't let himself think of how he'd once been one of them, seated for the first time beneath that starry ceiling, transfixed and overwhelmed and quietly, anxiously thrilled to have at last found somewhere that he might, perhaps, belong.
“Did you get a carriage?” Malfoy asked.
, and far more regularly he ever had been before, but it wasn’t because people
He said it as confidently as possible, trying to reassure Neville as much as himself, and it worked on both of them. They smiled at one another, the same fearful, determined smiles they’d given each other hundreds of times, before countless battles both tiny and huge.
He hoped the owls he’d sent to the ministry were flying fast.
"Rivals," a girl sighed.
"I'll show you later," Malfoy said. “It’s in the wrist, I learned when I was in France.”
"It doesn't work like --!"
With a fizzing sensation, the relentless throb of his leg suddenly faded to a much more manageable thrum, and Harry sighed with relief. Then he sat up, straightened his robes, and went back out to face the stairs.
Harry could not help but glance towards the Malfoy in question, and his heart leaped when he saw that Draco had dragged his head up and was staring at him. His expression, usually so controlled, broke open for a moment, and Harry saw all the things he himself was feeling: fear, relief, concern, desperation, connection. Then Draco’s face went blank again and his head slumped back down.
Oh no.
A charm-Amplified scream echoed through the house, and Ron hurried to get Rosie from her crib.
"She's not a house-elf. She's an Elf, no house about it. Well, her grandmother was. Like most magical creatures, they've had quite a bad time of it, been persecuted to the ends of the earth by -- well, by people like my family. They're native to the American continents and there aren't many left that are willing to mingle with wizards, so they're quite rare. Exceptionally good with wood, and great fun to drink with -- or Betsy is, at any rate. What did you – er – think of her?”
Harry realized he was taking a very long time to answer, but Malfoy hadn't moved, was waiting patiently for Harry to sort out whatever the hell he was trying to sort out.
“Yeah, what’ll you do with us?” asked the barkeep.
Malfoy seemed to consider the question. "Yes," he said.
Hermione was, of course, at work when Harry banged on their door, but Ron answered after a long moment, Rosie over his shoulder and a visibly sodden diaper in one hand. He looked harried and put-out but he blinked in surprise when he saw Harry and stepped back automatically to let him in.
"Why? Is it pain or weakness?"
“It’s your own health,” Kevari said. “And as Auror Roberts so astutely pointed out, you’re a grown man. No one can stop you doing foolish things.”
"Again," McGonagall said after a moment, "your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher."
"Oh, of course," Neville said, bouncing up. "Will you teach tomorrow?"
Smiling to himself, he took a few more steps, feeling lighter and lighter the deeper he went. When he was chest deep he took a breath and then submerged himself, holding his glasses with his good hand, bad arm positioned carefully against his side. It was so cool down here, so dark, so quiet, and Harry felt a little quiver of pure physical pleasure. A rarity, to feel suddenly so happy in his body. When he came back up, Malfoy was so close Harry could see the water droplets on his eyelashes, and he jumped in surprise.
“Yes, obviously, me too. You can barely keep your feet.”
"I have a quick question?"
"I know this sounds quite unbelievable," Harry said. "You know me, I was ready to hate him as much as I ever had, but... I really do think he's done a lot to try and... change. He's broken with almost everyone in his past."
“Er, right,” said Negasi, standing. “I’m going to – are you thirsty, Harry? I’ll get you a glass of water. Draco? Water? Yes. I’ll – I’ll go and do that.”
“You’ve thought of everything,” Harry said wonderingly.
"It does
Class had just ended, and Silvia Grupnik, Slytherin sixth-year, stood before him clutching her textbook. Behind her, two other girls waited.
"This was excellent," Neville said cheerfully. "We should do this again. Next time I'll try to think less about plants when I open the door. And Harry, maybe you could think less about -- er -- about monsters."
“The person who’s been sending him Howlers – Howlers which essentially amount to death threats – has been sending them from Brighton,” Harry said.
"I will," he promised. "I'll see you in class on Monday."
“Is she… er…”
, Harry asked it.
"But Harry says, Harry says the students love him, and that says a lot about a person, I think," she said, then beamed in Harry's direction. "Neville told me in an owl that they also love you, Harry. He said you're a smash hit, those were his exact words! Oh, I adore Neville."
"A margarita!" Neville said happily. "No salt."
Harry's potion worked perfectly -- for just over one hour. And there were so many, many hours in a day and night.
Malfoy sat back on his heels, nostrils flaring, and Harry's mouth dropped open.
“Yes,” Harry said. “I’ve still got friends in the Aurors’ office, I’ll owl at once and ask someone to meet me in Brighton.”
trudge," Malfoy said.
“The list?” Harry said, a little breathless.
"Has anyone else had any odd questions about the Floo system?" Harry asked his colleagues at dinner a few nights later. A third year boy called Jacob had hung back after class that morning and asked how many Floos there were in the castle, total.
The last chair had been low, and wooden, with uncomfortable slats in uncomfortable places and armrests at exactly the worst height. This new chair was cushioned and comforting and supportive and solid.
Harry groaned, trying to get his bearings. He was lying down on something soft; a couch. He was in a living room and the ceiling was not the only thing that was pink. Curtains, armchairs, rug, wallpaper: pink. It was like being in an enormous vagina. Negasi was kneeling at his side, and there were other people, too, but their faces were too blurry for Harry to make out. “Glasses,” he slurred. Then, more distinctly as memory came rushing back, “Draco! Is Draco all right?”
"Will you answer this one, then? Does your lack of walking aid have anything to do with your lack of two working hands?"
"Right," Harry said, when Malfoy's hilarity (and Neville's trembles) had wound down. "Er, Neville, maybe you ought to open the door."
“It’s a rare occurrence, for good reason. I get quite – high-spirited. There’s often singing involved.”
one and I was there, and – you’re both making each other miserable, it’s pointless! You shouldn’t be talking to me, you should be talking to one another, that’s why you’re fighting, really.”
"Someone's spotted the Snitch," Malfoy said.
"Only one I noticed. Otherwise it's -- well, it's been really excellent, actually. Thank you."
“We’ve missed you, too,” Roberts said, his expression suddenly, and uncharacteristically, serious. “Quite a lot, in fact.”
"Thanks," he said, sounding grateful, then laughed. "No, Harry -- we're this way."
"George reckons she's the ugliest toddler he's ever seen," Ron said with some satisfaction, "but still he's got pictures of her all over his office. Here." He deposited Rosie unceremoniously into Harry's lap and Harry buried his face gladly in her chubby neck. "What'll you have?"
Harry felt a flicker of anxiety. "Did I say he was brilliant?"
"You didn't," he assured her. And it was true, he wasn't offended. He was just -- sad. "Why not ask Mal - Professor Malfoy, he used to be quite a good Seeker back in the day."
Harry was struggling to sit up against the arm of the couch but finding it shockingly hard. The left half of his body was a useless, agonizing throb. Someone had folded his bad arm across his stomach and it fell into his lap as he moved, entirely ignoring any requests he made of it; he couldn’t even twitch his fingers. He managed to get himself propped up on one elbow but try as he might he couldn’t manage to make it further than that. Negasi had a hand on his chest, trying to keep him down, though it was clear he was nervous to press too hard or be too rough and it was mostly ineffectual.
Draco made a small movement like he wanted to lean down and touch Harry again, and Harry’s entire body thrilled to the idea; but Draco checked himself at the last moment, nodded at Kevari, and vanished into the kitchen.
Harry studiously did not look at Draco. "Sorry," he said. "I can't do that. I could pick up just the right one?"
"The students," Harry said dreamily, "think we're dating, me and Malfoy."
Harry felt pleasantly steamrollered. "Right."
"Oh, yes!" someone called.
In London he'd be out drinking right now with the other Aurors, recounting the day's adventures, comparing notes, maybe flirting a bit with whoever seemed interested. If he was in the right mood, he might even pick up a Muggle who'd never heard the name "Harry Potter" and have a nice, casual shag with someone who had no idea who he was, what he’d done, what he’d been through.
“Good call,” Harry said. “I will, thanks.” He was grateful Neville had held back from fussing. “I feel all right for now,” he lied.
Kevari was already squeaking a medical bag out of his expandable pocket, which he set on the floor with a thump before rummaging around in it. He came up with a glass vial of a familiar rust-colored liquid and Harry groaned.
Wrong.
"Malfoy thought of it," Harry said. "
"Yes," said Galen Parkinson, "And
A flush rose in Draco’s face, pink as the room around him but far more lovely. He ducked his head, tonguing his split lip absentmindedly; a gesture that made Harry’s stomach do a strange flip-flop. He kept his eyes on Harry’s hand, where his thumb was now pressing gently on a particularly tender spot at the base of his pinky. The muscle was drawn tight, keeping the finger curled inwards, and Draco slowly stroked it, warming it up, loosening it.
Harry cracked an eye, alarmed. “I can’t stay in bed for a week. I have a job. You know, the thing that makes me money so I can pay gits like you.”
She paused to let him catch up. "Yes, tour, Potter -- first your chambers so you can deposit your trunk --" she eyed the enormous suitcase floating obediently after him "-- and then a quick look at your classroom, so you at least know where you're going tomorrow. Then, of course, the feast."
Harry shook his head, sighing. "Look, I didn't mean to shout at you. I -- I can get a bit worked up."
Draco’s thumb stopped moving. “Why do you get upset when I say your name?”
Harry realized, with a horror so acute it was almost hallucinatory, that he was expected to make a speech, and there was absolutely no way to get out of it.
"I'm sorry," Harry laughed, "No, really I am. My students lost their heads the first time, too." He rubbed sand from the back of his neck, grinning, and planted his good hand on the ground, readying himself to try and stand. Malfoy was already climbing to his feet, and to Harry's surprise, he offered his hand. Harry hesitated, then took it. Malfoy hauled him up, then steadied him with a palm on his chest, and Harry was suddenly forcibly reminded that neither of them were wearing many clothes. He flushed and stepped away, busying himself with gathering his wand and trousers.
The potion took exactly two minutes to kick in, and Harry gave himself those two minutes to lie back on the bed and stare up at the canopy. It was surreal being here again, and even more surreal to think that at some point, it would be normal. How long would that take? A week? A month? A year, if he didn't get canned before then?
"Oh," said Malfoy. "Well, never mind. Meeting adjourned."
"You mean, you gave up being a bigoted prick?"
“Are you walking back?” Hermione asked anxiously. “At this hour?”
Malfoy didn't say anything.
"Who can blame her?"
“Potter,” said Roberts, with a nod. “You’re looking well.”
That genuinely sounded more promising than what he'd agreed to do, which was, to wit: humiliate himself in front of the wizarding world's bright young minds, plus his esteemed old professor, plus his dear old friend, plus his childhood nemesis.
Draco glanced at Harry, who said, "I'd love a cup. I'm Harry, by the way."
Well, fine. He could do without until he figured out what to do. Was it ideal, no, it wasn't ideal. Did this current batch of poorly-made potion have an absolute nightmare of withdrawal, yes, it did. Maybe the smartest thing to do would be cancel his classes tomorrow, take a sick day, and stop taking this batch as soon as possible. Get the effects out of his system so he'd just be normally-in-pain by the following day. Yes: that was exactly what he'd do.
“Keep me informed, if you can,” said Neville.
“Yes,” said Harry, who’d been listening intently. He hadn’t expected the extra charmwork and he was both impressed with her skill and grateful for her foresight. She’d anticipated problems that hadn’t occurred to him.
“Have a wonderful evening!” Jacob called after them. “I hope it’s a night to remember!”
"A cursed staircase?"
"Potter, I'm sorry, but why bother concealing it? It seems a waste of energy."
Harry swallowed hard. Then, steeling himself against a rush of nerves, he said, “I’ll always come for you, Draco.”
"As roommates," Malfoy clarified. "Blaise isn't interested in men."
“Are we – are we still in the Debs’ house? What happened?”
"I don't!" she said fiercely. "If I hadn't come looking, you might've -- well, it wouldn't have been very nice for you, would it?"
This idea was more than agreeable to Harry, and Hermione reluctantly complied, after Ron had pried a folder of paperwork out of her grasping hands. She lit a fire in the hearth and curled up in the armchair, while Harry stretched out on the bed-turned-couch with his bad leg up and his bad arm on a pillow across his stomach. Despite Hermione's propensity to over-worry, their house was still the place he felt most comfortable being himself -- this new self, the one who wanted to sit in front of a roaring fire instead of tromp around town; the self who couldn't tie his own shoes anymore but had no trouble demonstrating a nonverbal Undetectable Extension Charm on Rosie's diaper bag when Hermione requested it.
One minute he was lowering himself down onto the next step, and the next minute he was falling.
"I can't," Neville said, looking sorry. "The Herbology club's got their pet cactus show tonight, I promised to judge. Next time."
“Yes, and I even got one back. Very polite on both sides. I quote,
The thing was, Harry wasn't keen on anyone knowing the full extent of his injuries. Only Ron and Hermione knew how useless his left arm really was. Bad enough that every wizard who kept up on the news knew about his leg -- call him paranoid, but he'd prefer to keep it under wraps that he was essentially down not just one functional limb, but two. It wasn't good to broadcast one's weaknesses to one's enemies, and Harry had more enemies than most. He'd managed to keep the damage to his arm quiet up til now and he was dead-set on keeping it from his students and colleagues.
Dishes appeared across the tables and Harry scowled at them. Too little, too late; where were all these sausages before his potion had started wearing off? But food was food, and he was hungry, and those potatoes looked excellent.
"No, no, the -- the spaghetti!"
Still, Betsy’s cane was just about the only thing keeping him up, and he was thankful for it as he limped out of the Floo and made his slow way towards his desk, wishing he were back in his bed with the covers pulled over his head instead of at the front of a classroom with thirty pairs of prepubescent eyes tracking him.
Harry whirled on him, hot with fury. "Malfoy, the newspapers reported every detail of what happened to me since the second those wizards took me from the Ministry last year. Everyone knows what they did to me and what I did to them. My bloody students know that I was stripped naked and tortured for three days and then went mental and turned into a magical bomb. Can you imagine teaching great roomfuls of teenagers who've all seen photos of you strapped to a stretcher with no clothes on and someone else's brains splattered on your face? Really try and picture it."
"Here," Harry said, and flicked his wand to dry Malfoy from head to toe, adding in a little warming charm at the end. Instead of thanking him, Malfoy stared as if he'd just turned a backflip.
After all these years, Harry knew when Ron was joking, and he saw now that Ron was only teasing, not realizing that he was edging towards an uncomfortable truth. "Yeah," Harry said. "I'm worried I might've told you about me and McGonagall."
“No,” Harry said, as Malfoy said, “Yes.”
"It's all the exercise," Harry said. "Running around that bloody great castle."
"Naturally," said Malfoy.
Malfoy looked at him, expressionless. “Why.”
"Thank you," Harry said when Neville and McGonagall had reluctantly gone back to the table.
"Sorry," Harry said, looking around for a chair. "Everything's all slippery, I had to go about half a kilometer an hour just to stay upright."
“Of course it has,” Harry said, trying to control his temper. “Look, I hope that at the end of today Malfoy’s perfectly safe and I look like a bloody great fool and everyone laughs at me. That’s the best-case scenario. But I have a – a
“No, really though,” Harry said, popping his wand out again for the sheer pleasure of it. “This is absolutely brilliant. I never thought – I wouldn’t have imagined – I mean, thank you. Won’t you please let me pay you?”
"Oh," he said. He looked around, as if he'd found himself somewhere unexpected. "I didn't -- no one's ever here."
He sat there now on the last Sunday in September, revising some ideas he had for a new Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook. It was just a silly side-project to keep himself occupied, but he enjoyed the work, enjoyed thinking through the problems of how to explain things and in what order. Boggarts were a natural foundation for Dementors, but what would be a suitable link between the two, something that could be taught in the fifth year, perhaps?
“I think he wishes he were,” Harry said. “He’s never told me why he left off but I get the sense he misses it, and I don’t want him taking his career regrets out on me, just because I happen to be close by. Thanks, I’m all right now.”
He and Malfoy had come to a patch of ground uneven with rocks and roots, and Harry slowed, careful with his steps lest he torque his knee or trip. He felt Malfoy move closer and he gritted his teeth, suddenly irritated by the concern. He wanted Malfoy to move closer because he wanted to
“I want you here,” Harry said, because part of his half-barmy paranoia was the fear that maybe this whole thing was an even bigger ruse to lure Harry away from his students so someone could attack them; a scenario even Harry had to admit was unlikely, but still, he felt better knowing Neville would be around. “I’m going to owl an old colleague at the Ministry, then get a carriage to Hogsmeade to use Ron and Hermione’s Floo.”
She didn't blink, or ask why, or seem to mind at all. "Nah, no problem, it was just cosmetic, anyway. Okay so yeah I think it'll take about a week? You caught me at a good time, pre-Christmas season. In terms of payment, could I very daringly suggest a trade? Mona's gonna be back in late November, just in time for her birthday, and if you come over for dinner and show her your wand I will win the biggest Wife of the Year trophy – no, I’ll win Wife of Life!"
It was Hanna, of course it was Hanna, because she was the absolute last person he wanted seeing him like this; Hanna, secretly his favorite student, beloved daughter of the friend and former colleague who'd found him in that terrible basement.
“He’s fine,” Negasi said, “he’s – Harry, stop, lie down! Oh, bugger, someone go get – stop moving, damn it!”
“Draco?” Betsy said.
"What changed your mind?" Harry said. He could hear the anger in his voice, but he couldn't help it, the wound ran so deep. "When it stopped being fashionable? When you realized the tides had turned and you weren't in power anymore?"
"And you? How are -- wait, is that a new chair?"
been looking.
Ron strode towards them. “You came down to Hogsmeade without telling me?”
"Budge over," he roared. "Why are you walking so bloody close?"
“I sent a Patronus to Ronald Weasley and to McGonagall while I was in the kitchen,” said Draco. “We’ll apparate to the Brighton Floo and then Floo to the Weasley-Granger cottage in Hogsmeade, then take a carriage back to the castle.”
"Anyway," Harry finished. "I thought you should be aware."
"How would you know?" Ron said, handing her an enormous plateful of eggs and sausage and pancakes. "We haven't been to a bloody show in ages. All we do anymore is stare at Rosie. Sit up, Harry, you'll choke if you try and eat like that."
“Professor Longbottom!” she said, clearly thrilled to see him. “We’ve got a new baby, come and look!”
"I'll be fine after I eat something," Harry said, which would have been true two hours ago. He put a few bites of potato into his mouth to demonstrate, and after a moment, McGonagall and Neville were satisfied enough to stop looking at him. Actually, the food did revive him a bit, though his leg was still shouting for him to get up and stretch it out -- standing for the brief, horrible interlude of the speech hadn't been enough.
“Yes, but it’s not intolerable yet. Last year I managed until early November.”
Neville looked up at him anxiously. “It’s probably just a coincidence, Harry.”
“On this particular occasion, I made a lot of people sing Centaur shanties with me, and then I – I think I got up on a table at some point – and was buying everyone drinks – and –” Draco put his head in his hand “—and I was sitting on a lot of laps, apparently, though I don’t recall most of this. There was a man there who was quite aggressively trying to take me home, and I was too drunk to properly object. All I remember is pushing someone away, someone with an awful, scratchy beard. Anyway, Betsy happened to be at the pub with her wife, Mona, you’ll like her a lot when you meet her… and bless them, they recognized a disaster when they saw one. They intervened, closed out my tab, and managed to get me back to their flat. They poured water down my throat and lay me out on their couch and next thing I knew I was waking up to the smell of coffee and the sound of Betsy talking a mile a minute.” He shrugged. “I ended up staying all day. Merlin knows why, but they took a shine to me and I to them.”
"More than once."
“Oh, thanks,” Harry told it, and it hooted once before flapping away again. He lowered it into his lap and wedged it under his bad hand so he could tear open the flap, then read it quickly – and again, more slowly.
"Right," Harry said, trying not to look too dismayed. He thought he'd have a minute to himself, to put his leg up and take a few deep breaths, but no, it was all systems go, apparently. And lovely, here was one of the infamous one hundred and forty-two Hogwarts staircases looming before him, a long marble one he remembered hurtling down without a second thought when he was a student here. No railing, of course, excellent. McGonagall was already halfway down by the time he'd managed to take two bloody steps. He was sweating lightly when he reached the bottom, winded from pain and effort, and his trunk nudged him in the back with what felt like sympathy. McGonagall looked at him, flustered.
He grabbed for the banister but it was too late, his balance was gone and he was plunging forward, tipping over on a leg that couldn't bend, both arms flying forward instinctively to catch his fall, his bad shoulder howling at the sudden movement, and then -- BAM -- he hit the landing.
“I’m a fully-grown man,” Harry interrupted, “and I’m sitting right here, you needn’t talk over me. Or
Betsy's eyes got impossibly wider. Then they shrank back down to their normal size –- and really, was it normal how they grew and shrank like that? -– and she looked a bit calmer. "Thanks for letting me freak out," she said. "I'll do some more when you're gone, but for now, it's all business, baby. I'm gonna make a cane that's gonna hold the most famous wand of my generation, no biggie. But okay so, do you want your cane to be functional without the wand, too? Like, if you pop the wand out the cane'll still work fine?"
"Don't splinch me," Harry said, pronouncing his words very carefully lest he slur them. "I'm damaged enough without you taking off my eyebrow."
“—And go out to dinner, looks like,” Ron said, glaring at the bright sign of the restaurant they’d just exited. He narrowed his eyes at Harry. “Have a nice time, did you?”
Neville shrugged. "If you'll remember, he was quite awful to me, as well. I'm not saying it's been easy, forgiving him. But I think I have."
him. Who’d kissed him, and kissed him
“Nimpkins and that lot should be here soon, anyhow,” Negasi said. “I bet they’ll –”
"Professor, you can't --!"
Harry frowned. "I don't like this."
"Merlin," Harry breathed. "No wonder she won't talk in my class."
“When you put it like that… well, I’m not Draco Malfoy, either. Not really.”
"Oh, yes." Malfoy gave Harry a brief smile. "Anyway. I'm going in. Take your time."
“You’re still an Auror,” said Negasi, gripping his good shoulder. “Still the best we’ve ever had.”
Harry squinted across the room, trying to figure out if he could break the locks without getting back to his feet, but he couldn’t suss them out from this distance so he pushed himself up again and made his way to where Neville was standing. He’d forgotten, in his first rush of panic over Malfoy, that this was Not a Good Day, but, as a friendly reminder, his knee was starting to tremble a little beneath him. He transferred all his weight to his good leg so he could let go of his cane and crack the wards on the filing cabinet, then leaned against the wall as Neville began opening drawers.
“Your coat is nice, Professor Potter,” said one of the girls. “It’s the same color as your eyes, did you know?”
And with a flap of blue robes, Malfoy was gone again.
expecting to see Negasi Seid chained to a stove and making muffled grunts of panic through a Silencing charm.
It was a proper basement, cement walls, bare bulbs, but it was lit by hundreds of dripping candles, which the people crowded inside were trying to avoid. There were about a dozen of them, some in robes and some in casual Muggle garb, and Harry didn’t recognize anyone. They’d been chatting to one another when he’d come in, as if there wasn’t a half-naked beat-up man tied up in their midst, and they didn’t fully stop when Harry entered, though there was an ebb to the noise as they noticed him. They were all adults, he noticed, save for one person, a blond, spotty teenage girl in an extremely frothy white dress, who was standing near Draco’s chair and looking very nervous.
"Thank you for introducing me to Betsy," Harry said. "If the cane comes through, you won't have to be hauling me through the streets anymore."
"Ah, sorry," Harry winced, hoping no one thought to wonder why he needed a cutting charm. He thought he could feel Malfoy watching him across the table.
“No,” Harry said, “there ought to be a carriage waiting for us outside the Shrieking Shack.”
“Depends on if Slytherins are still shite or not,” Harry said, and Ron cackled. Ten-month old Rosie, perched on his hip, cackled as well, always happy to share a joke. “Anyway, Slytherins will be getting favoritism left and right,“ Harry added, "considering who the bloody potions professor is.“
Negasi nodded, clapped Harry again on the shoulder, then turned to jog away through the muddy field, aiming for a clump of trees that would hide his approach from the back. Harry looked after him through rain-spattered glasses, then tightened his grip on his cane and began making his way towards the house. It hurt – everything hurt – but again he focused on Draco’s face and the pain didn’t feel so present.
Hanna was at the back of the group, her arms folded and eyes rolling like she was above whatever nonsense was being performed, and he looked to her pleadingly. She gave him a small shrug: you're on your own.
"Professor," said Galen officiously, "if you're so good at Defense Against the Dark Arts, why didn't you defend yourself against the curses that made you limp like that?"
"But haven't you one in --" Jacob giggled "--your bedroom."
"Well," said Harry, "when she gets back from Vancouver, she can meet it too, if she wants."
Malfoy looked distinctly uncomfortable. "No. They asked me if -- if I had a Floo in my -- chambers."
“Wait,” the man on the floor said. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. Was that a fucking stag?”
"Where it -- goes?" Did they teach these children nothing? "It goes anywhere there's another Floo. You see, you enter when the flames are green and --"
But there was no way he'd be able to hold these bloody peas. He gripped the two-handled tureen with his good hand and made a show of folding his fingers around the other handle, but his shoulder was already seizing up in protest of the movement and his fingers wouldn't cooperate and you didn't need to be Professor Trelawney to predict what was about to happen.
This was what Harry had asked for, of course. Yet it was not really what he wanted. He didn’t want Draco’s Healer concern; but he did want his concern. He wanted his attention and care, except he wanted it not as a medical case, but as a person. As a friend. As more than a friend.
Phil turned out to be very tall and broad when he stood up and clomped over to look. “Hmm,” he said. “Oy, Craig. Take a look at this photo. You know this guy?”
The rest of the faculty meeting went by in a blur, and Harry excused himself five minutes early to take a potion, eat a biscuit, and panic. He couldn't break into that office again, that much was clear. Nor could he let a student possibly be blamed for what he'd done, but maybe no one would be blamed, maybe it would be shrugged off as a mystery and life would go on and Harry would find another way to get his potion. By tomorrow night at 2am when he'd take the last vial.
So he said nothing.
his body. Fuck the men who’d done this to him in the first place. Fuck basements in general!
"I've had a theft in my office," he said.
Harry was still so attuned for insult that for a moment he felt himself bristling. Which was silly, because -- "Yes, it really has."
“Yes. It’s her husband’s bar.”
-- a gut instinct – and I can’t ignore it, even if it is paranoia.”
And THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your kudos and comments, I am absolutely thrilled you are enjoying the story, thanks a million to those of you who've taken the time to tell me. I am way behind on answering comments (see: election) but I'll try to catch up this next chapter.
"Yeah, didn't sleep much," Harry said. "No reason, nothing specific, just insomnia."
Students
“Yes,” Harry hissed in relief, dropping his wand and breaking the spell. “Excellent. We’ve got a time and a location, that’ll be enough to get started with.”
"The students will be disappointed."
“Yeah,” Harry said absently, wand clicking back in place as he gripped his cane again. He went straight to Malfoy’s desk and began rifling through the papers and parchments there, spreading them out clumsily with his bad hand, but he could tell instantly that they were all lesson plans and essays so he propped his cane against the wall and sat down in Malfoy’s chair to start going through the drawers. Nothing.
Harry sat up so quickly that pain shot through his body, and all the bubbles popped. He called, "Poppy? It's okay, let her through."
“A fleece,” said Harry.
“Besides,” said a different robed man, bouncing excitedly on his toes. “Once we prove this works, Azkaban is full of purebloods. They’re as good as dead, anyhow – I’m certain we can convince the Ministry to sacrifice them for the greater good of our wizarding lines. No one wants to have a Squib child anymore than we wanted to be born one!”
with Malfoy, per se, was he?
“Quite a sprain,” Lizzie ventured doubtfully when Harry had reached the bottom, visibly sweating.
“Shit,” Negasi said, putting out a hand to steady him. “You’ve looked better, Harry, I’ll be honest.”
Malfoy went to his wooden cabinet and took down a bottle and two glasses. "Have a seat."
"For providing me with the chance to demonstrate my answer, by giving you detention. Just you, no one else."
2) Harry was still, after all these years, absolute shite at making potions.
"Do all the professors?"
Harry swallowed. This evidence that Malfoy had been thinking of him was almost too much to bear right now. “That doesn’t tell us much,” Harry said gruffly. “Keep looking. I’m going to try something else.”
"Right," he said. "Who's heard of a boggart?"
“Please,” he was babbling, “Harry, they told me you had to stay still, please stop making this so difficult –”
“You’re not still swimming in the mornings, are you?” Harry asked as they set out across the bridge.
"There you are!"
But Harry never found out what Negasi bet, because just then a voice split the air.
He was in the foyer of a very Muggle-looking home, nothing magical anywhere that he could see. To the left appeared to be a kitchen, to the right a living room, and directly in front of him was a staircase leading to the second floor. He was standing very still, ears pricked for any sound, eyes skimming for any hint of where he ought to go first, when he heard the faint creak of a floorboard bending. He tensed, springing his wand again from his cane and shifting his weight to his good leg, prepared to strike.
“Got the address,” he said breathlessly, waving a piece of paper in one hand and a wand in the other. “Found my wand, too, thank Merlin. They live a bit out of town, but plenty close enough to apparate.”
"How'd you do that?" Harry said. "It feels loads better than when I do."
It was freeing to admit it aloud, and they all three retired to the sofas, Neville on one and Harry and Malfoy on the other. Neville began dozing almost as soon as he'd sat down and Harry, for the first time in hours, checked his watch.
There it was, twice in one night! Malfoy's genuine laughter.
"But then you wouldn't be able to come," Harry said. Then hastened to add, "I'd feel badly seeing your friend if you couldn't see her, too."
"What'll you have?" he said. "There's a book of cocktail recipes back here."
The clock struck half six and Malfoy glanced at it, then at Harry. "Well," he said. "To dinner?"
Harry cleared his throat, aiming for nonchalance. “Hi,” he said.
"So like, high functionality, low visibility."
“You are fine, aren’t you, Potter?” Draco said.
people can deflect unHealable curses before they hit."
“Well, Evie will be able to heal that soon enough!” Lizzie turned over her shoulder to beam at him. They were in the kitchen now, a big, bright affair with lots of stainless steel, and Lizzie was marching directly across it and putting her hand on a door in the far corner. A pantry, Harry thought for a moment, but she opened it to reveal a set of stairs and a whiff of damp air, and the truth became horribly clear.
"Yeah, but that's Neville, isn't it? He likes everyone."
Miserably, Harry shook his head.
Ron thunked the pints down on the table and thunked himself down in his chair, grinning at Harry. "So, Professor Potter, tell me everything. What's it like being on the other side of the desk? Do you feel mad with power?"
“She didn’t think
"Yeah, the only battle she'll ever lose."
She didn’t go on, though; she made it to the bottom and then turned around to watch as he made his slow, lurching way down. He tried to detach himself from the difficulty of the task, the pain of it and the knowledge that once he was down he’d be trapped, unable to get back up quickly enough to escape; but detachment only sent him spinning back into that horrible memory, so he tried to focus on the present; but the present was so deeply unpleasant that he gave up on that and focused instead on the future. Just let Draco be at the bottom of these steps and let him be all right, and Harry could handle anything else that happened.
"How are you?" he said.
Besides, even at his best he probably could not have beat Malfoy, who played pool with a kind of lean, focused intensity. Watching him made Harry feel oddly like he wasn't getting enough air. Malfoy was graceful as always, but there was a restrained power in the way he handled the cue stick, gently at first until he was certain of his target, and then with total confidence.
The day of the first Hogsmeade weekend was not exactly the bright, cheery morning that one might have hoped. It was grey and drizzling slightly and the grounds were slick with mud. This did absolutely nothing to dampen the students' excitement, especially the third years, for whom it was their first first visit -- and who were a particularly loud and excitable bunch anyway.
Draco be embarrassed to date him? Harry had felt lately as if Draco might, possibly, maybe be flirting, but suddenly he wondered if that was just ridiculous wish-fulfillment. Draco had been attentive lately, yes, and kind, and very watchful, and perhaps Harry had construed that as flirtation… but he’d somehow let himself forget that Draco was also a trained Healer. Of course he was watchful; to a Healer, Harry needed watching.
"Thirty diamond-plated vials worth," Harry said, and mustered up enough energy to try a grin at Malfoy, who did not grin back, though he didn't scowl, either. "Sorry about that, by the way, I didn't know."
"Eleven stone, ish."
"Several ingredients have gone missing from my cupboards, including a highly narcotic and rigidly restricted form of Daddy Longlegs venom. I'm also missing sixty valuable diamond-plated vials that the school generously ordered for me to advance my own research."
“Is that really Harry Potter?” someone asked. “I thought he’d be taller.”
Harry had been concentrating on keeping his balance, and he glanced up. Malfoy had swum back and was standing ankle-deep in the water, watching him. His own skin was smooth and unmarked and Harry felt a glimmer of rage that faded quickly into something else, something like admiration. Malfoy had such beautiful joints. Maybe this was an odd thing to notice, but Harry'd had to think more about joints than most people, and Malfoy's were without a doubt excellent. Shoulders thick with muscle, solid wrists with a delicate protrusion of bone, perfect kneecaps under muscled thighs, curved ankles. He couldn't help but stare.
Now Harry was starting to get annoyed and a bit nervous. "Yes, so, ten I suppose."
"Motherhood," George said. "It really puts the blinders on."
“Yes,” said Draco, and looked down at Harry, his expression stern. “Be good.”
"Malfoy," Harry said. He leaned forward, good elbow on good knee. "Is there something I should know?"
Which was how they ended up in front of the Room of Requirement at 11 o'clock at night, staring at the door in fixed concentration. On Harry's orders, they were all thinking
Harry got it. A moment later, the charm was in place, and any further attempts by Draco and Betsy to remove the wand proved fruitless.
“Thanks very much,” Harry said, and went back to the alley to apparate. It was harder if you’d never been to your destination, but he focused with as much determination as possible on the woman’s directions and on the idea of the men’s loo in the Ragged Pony, praying it would be single-stall.
Malfoy winced. "Yes."
“This isn’t a problem,” Neville said. “It’s just a – a thing that is. And anyway, Draco’s not a Healer anymore.”
"No, go on, I'm fine," Harry said.
Harry felt his neck get hot, and he took a hasty drink of his cocktail. "You mean see me get walloped."
Harry smiled at Roberts, who was waiting for them by the fireplace. To Draco he said, through clenched teeth, “I think I’m doing rather well. I haven’t fallen yet, at any rate.”
“Merlin, Draco,” Harry groaned. “Would you kiss me already?”
Harry muttered a spell and flicked his wand and the front door snapped open, and with another flick he’d sent Dougie’s unconscious body sailing through it and onto the front porch. Negasi said, “Oh, come on,” and Harry said regretfully, “Sorry, mate,” then sent his friend flying after Dougie’s floating body as he broke the Muffliato and jammed his wand back into his cane. The front door closed just as a tall blond woman came out from the kitchen, wearing an irritated expression and full ceremonial witch’s robes in a lurid shade of turquoise. She stopped when she saw Harry but, to his surprise, did not look terribly alarmed.
He did not have his wand.
Betsy was gazing avidly at Harry, her hazel eyes so huge Harry could've sworn they'd grown. "I mean yeah of course, duh, but also like, not recently? I have a vague cartoony image of glasses and a scar and a lot of hair, but like, his face? Not really."
we're with Potter, who can send his -- his -- oh, it hurts -- his
“Yes. Not that I’ve forgotten what it was like working under you, but I thought this once we’d make a game plan before storming in.”
“Neither do I,” Harry snapped.
,” Neville said, stopping so short that Harry nearly tripped over him. “That’s a terrible thing to say about yourself.”
Harry smirked. “Go on.”
It was full dark, now, and Hogsmeade’s streets were bathed in warm yellow lamplight and window glow. Harry felt more confident on the cobblestones than he had done in some time, relying on the cane for balance and support instead of being forced to move at the pace of a snail to keep from tripping.
the sound of that,” said Harry.
Harry was, in fact, wavering badly on his feet, and he propped his good hip against a stool, not willing to sit completely for fear he’d be stuck. The Patronus, which usually came so naturally to him, was slow to appear and when it did, the normally solid-looking stag was flickering like an old film. He banished it impatiently and re-focused until he’d conjured another that was much more up to snuff, then hastily recorded a message to Nimpkins and sent it galloping away.
He vanished into the crowd and Harry took a moment to enjoy the scene. It was the first time in months that he wasn't outnumbered twenty to one by adolescents, and though he did spot a few of his students perched at the mismatched tables, it was a pleasure to be surrounded by grown-ups. He wouldn't have said no to a bit more eye candy, but Hogsmeade was a village of families, and young single wizards and witches made up a low percentage of the demographic. Actually, the bloke who'd given up his chair hadn't been half bad, but he'd gone off elsewhere. A shame; Harry longed for just five minutes of the kind of eye contact he never got at Hogwarts, the glance across the room, the mutual sizing-up, the fizzy feeling of possibility even if it never amounted to anything. Harry loved to flirt and the weight of his flirtation deprivation was only just now becoming clear to him.
"Right now, everything's sore," Harry said. He'd suddenly lost all energy for argument. There was a stone bench a few paces away and he glanced at it and said, "I need to sit down for a bit. I guess I'll see you at dinner."
"Oh," Silvia said. She sounded oddly put-out. "Well. That does make sense."
say that, wouldn't he. You didn't go around admitting to being a Death Eater anymore, not unless you were in the right circles. But he thought of the Howlers,
This was his favorite staircase because no one ever took it, something that had seemed wonderful just yesterday but now seemed like a possible nail in his coffin. Maybe no one would ever come by, maybe he'd never be able to move, maybe he'd be entombed here and eaten by rats.
Ron looked crestfallen.
They sat in the pub for nearly five hours, though Ron left briefly to bring Rosie home to where George had agreed to come by and put her to bed. They ordered food, and drinks, and then more food and drinks, until Harry was quite thoroughly sloshed and Hermione was sitting on Ron's lap and eating a plate of chips with the determination of the very drunk.
“I did a preliminary examination on him,” started Draco, and Harry said “You did?” just as Kevari said, “Is that what the kids are calling it these days?”
"Sorry," the man said, with a little bow, "meant no disrespect. Thanks for your service."
“Cadaverous,” supplied Draco.
, and the 9 shot across the billiards table -- in completely the wrong direction. It careened off several other balls and came to rest complacently by a pocket on the other side.
"Of course. As always, you’re not nearly as clever as you think you are."
"You need to keep better track of the time. What if this happens while you're -- while you're driving?"
“Yes?”
At least he still had his reflexes. His wand was out and the peas, gravy and mashed potatoes were gone before McGonagall had even finished saying, "What on earth, Potter?"
“Had a lot of questions, have you?” Draco said, passing the potatoes across the table. He seemed amused by Harry’s surliness, which only made Harry surlier.
Harry nearly protested -- if it really was an obstacle course, he'd have liked to give it a go! -- but then realized how much more ammunition he'd be giving Malfoy if he admitted to this, and kept a dignified silence instead.
“Oh, sure,” she said, adjusting her umbrella so it covered both of them, a gesture Harry found rather touching. “You’ll want to go just down to the end of the road here, then you’ll want to take a right, then you’ll want to continue for a bit until you see a sign for Cresswell street, then you’ll want to take another right, then you’ll see it at the end of the lane, big orange sign with a horse on it. You’ll want to go on in.”
“And nice – what would one even call that monstrosity you’re wearing?” Draco plucked at Harry’s pink sleeve.
“Can we, now?” Ron said.
going to Brighton?” McGonagall said. “Surely the Ministry can handle it without you.”
Timmy Perkins looked miserable, and said something very quietly.
He awoke a minute later to find all his students clustered around him, someone's hand on his shoulder, someone else yelling for help, someone else tossing water on him.
The enormous space had been divided into sections, some parts dark and swampy and vegetal like the marsh in the Forbidden Forest, some parts completely foreign-looking, like a patch of sand with what appeared to be an amphora sticking out of it. There was even a sectioned-off indoor bit that greatly resembled someone's parlor. At the very far end of the space, Harry could just make out what looked like a table set with party hats and bottles of liquor.
"Did Be--" he paused, hiccuped "--Betsy make this?"
"It's true what they were saying about brooms at dinner," Malfoy said. "About Nimbus's new comfort line. I think if you wanted to fly again you might try --"
"I guess sometimes that's the best we can hope for of anyone," Neville said, smiling.
"Neville, this isn't your fault, I've just got shite luck and a shite body."
"Eleven... About a hundred fifty-five."
"Fuck," Harry said far too loudly, "Sorry, oh, bloody hell, let me --"
Idly, Draco moved his thumb across Harry’s palm. “I suppose I was overdue for another appearance on the list,” he said.
"Yes, Parkinson?"
“Yes?”
As soon as Malfoy suggested it, Harry
They reached the faculty table and Harry took the seat next to Neville, while Malfoy slid in across from them. Harry adjusted himself a bit, stretching out his leg, and felt his knee bump up against Malfoy's. His first instinct was to yank it away and apologize for letting his Mudblood filth touch Malfoy's pureblood robes, but for one thing, he couldn't move that fast, and for another, Malfoy seemed unbothered. Experimentally, Harry left his knee where it was.
"Terrible," Malfoy said. "You're on Neville's team."
“Sod off and get me a coat,” Harry said, blushing harder, and Ron hurried to the hall closet. He came back a moment later with a very Muggle-looking pink fleece zip-up that Harry was relatively sure belonged to Hermione, which was probably for the better, as Ron was many sizes taller and larger than he was. Rosie, on Ron’s hip, was screaming now.
Harry forced himself to look away, his heart still beating hard, his jaw tight. A picture was coming together in his mind and it was not a pleasant one. He took a deep breath and a big risk. “What’s the first spell you’d cast?” he asked Abigail. “If you got magic?”
"I told them they didn't have to do that," Hermione said tipsily, "but actually I quite appreciate it."
with him. It seemed patently mad that anyone would want to flirt with him when he felt so bloody terrible, but apparently his outsides were doing a good job concealing the wreck of his insides. How could she look past this pink fleece, though? Mystery upon mystery.
"First announcement," announced McGonagall. "We have been approved for an in-castle Floo network and will commence construction immediately."
"Bloody brilliant," Harry said, stabbing a sausage with his knife. The hangover combined with the near-fall combined with his stiff knee and the exhausting prospect of a day spent hobbling around even worse than he already hobbled around had turned his mood very sour indeed. "You?"
“Last document this quill wrote,” Harry said, pushing glasses up his sweaty nose with the back of his wrist. The effort of difficult spellcasting while standing upright had taken a toll on him and his vision was blurring slightly. “Read it aloud for us, would you?”
Harry nodded grimly and took a deep breath. He stepped forward, then glanced back over his shoulder. Neville and Malfoy both made encouraging faces. He gripped the doorknob. He opened the door.
“To take you into the Ministry,” Roberts said. “You’re under arrest.”
"Next announcement is from Professor Malfoy," McGonagall said. "Draco, take the floor."
Malfoy grabbed his shoulder, the bad one, and Harry didn't feel a thing. "Potter, what don't you understand? The way you move will still have consequences on your body. I imagine you've wreaked enough havoc on it with whatever sludge you brewed up the other night, if you don't slow down you'll be recovering in bed for days, and I know you don't want that."
Harry was breathing hard. "Don't placate me."
Malfoy shook his head. "You can see why it's hard not to resent you, right?"
Gingerly, he took his left hand from his pocket so he could lay it across his left knee. He pressed the palm into the aching joint, trying to work out some of the tension, but stopped at the answering flicker of pain in his shoulder. Thanks to Chloé's dad. How had he not known the man had children?
Several times someone had approached them with a tentative, "Hello, Minister, I was wanting to ask --", and each time, whoever was behind the bar flicked their wand and a blaring neon sign lit up above Hermione's head: "No one bothers the Minister while she's drinking, HOUSE RULES."
"He used wandless magic!" Hanna answered, swiveling in her chair. "They exploded!"
Ron came back into the room, Rosie draped over his shoulder, to find them both bent double, weeping with hilarity. He looked at them indulgently. "What's got you two so giddy?"
"Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor." Then, seeing the Gryffindors’ smug smiles and thinking of Hermione's admonishing face, he added, "Er, and ten points to Slytherin."
A very small barn owl was hopping up and down in front of Malfoy’s breakfast plate, a letter in its beak. Malfoy took the letter, frowning. It was a lovely envelope, cream-colored and embossed with a faint floral sheen – a wedding invitation, perhaps? Malfoy had already unsealed the flap before Harry saw a faint wisp of smoke and realized what was happening.
"It's not -- it's not
"I hate it too," Harry said. "Maybe because I've always enjoyed playing the hero."
“But the other,” Neville said, “the other was an actual patient who’d spotted his Dark Mark and decided for a bit of vigilante justice. Leaped on him in broad daylight with a knife. She was – erm – a big fan of, of yours, I gather.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “All right…”
"Curious," said Malfoy at their 6pm meeting on Friday. He was slouched elegantly behind his desk, one ankle on his knee, showing off surprisingly bright orange socks. Even his socks looked expensive, somehow. "And it was the same time every day?"
"What --" Harry said.
Malfoy looked him up and down. "Knee still out of order?"
Harry looked down at him, startled. “You recognized me by my… Patronus?”
Strange, to be going back to Hogwarts again. But Harry's life was nothing if not strange.
Completely flummoxed by this turn of events, Harry said, “Dougie’s – he’s – gone outside to check something, a strange sound, he said. He’ll be back in soon.”
She narrowed her eyes at him, suddenly suspicious, and his heart lurched. “You are a Squib, aren’t you?” she demanded. “Not a Muggle?”
"I -- I only wanted to ask if -- if pixies were going to be on the test?"
"If," Malfoy said, "you consider my mother an admirer."
"Malfoy, were you
Harry absolutely refused to dignify that insinuation with a reaction. “We’re not
Just then, Harry heard a familiar tiny high-pitched scream, like a teakettle, and turned to find Jacob and his gaggle of third years staring at them. When Harry and Draco looked at them, they clutched each other and gasped and began laughing.
The Dark Mark was still branded on his arm, looking brand-new and almost inflamed, the skin around it pink and swollen. Harry couldn't hide how the sight affected him: his whole body went rigid, the old fury sweeping through his veins.
"Very good tooth!" Neville said, after he'd come out from where he'd been pruning an enormous bush of purple, howling flowers. He held the photo gingerly between two soil-covered fingers, then handed it back.
“The cane’s made of holly wood,” she said. “And I called in a little favor and got a strand of unicorn hair, it’s not phoenix feather obviously but it’ll do the trick, which is, so long as your wand’s in there, the cane itself can function as a kind of extension of it. Definitely not for delicate spellwork, but for big blasty things – and for like a disarming charm, isn’t that what you’re known for? – you should be able to use the cane to conduct your magic.”
Malfoy sat at the end of the table and Harry resolutely did not look at him again. His stomach was growling, and he realized with a jolt of horror that he'd forgotten all about the Sorting -- it would be at least an hour before he'd get a chance to eat. He cursed himself silently. He should've scrounged up something to take with his pain potion; if he didn't get something down soon, the effects would fade as quickly as they had come on.
"And they're absolutely convinced it's because you two are having a secret love affair."
Their glasses chimed like a bell as they connected.
"Yes are you kidding?" Betsy was holding it against her cheek now. "This is like the wand all wandmakers learn about in our first year of apprenticeship! Oh god I can't believe I'm holding the wand that dueled Voldemort, twin cores, phoenix against phoenix, I'm holding a piece of history! The things this holly wood has seen! Okay I'm almost done, sorry Harry, but meeting this wand is like meeting a fucking celebrity. Which, I guess
"What concerns you?" Malfoy said.
Immediately he thought of his students' ridiculous theory and wished he could take this back, but Malfoy didn't seem to register it as anything untoward. He only nodded, and picked up his quill, and Harry was dismissed.
"You've shouted at me loads of times and I survived just fine."
“What’s happened down there?” called McGonagall.
Again that crackle of power, asking to be let out.
“Did you notice, Professor Malfoy?” the girl said, turning to Draco. “That it’s just the same color as his eyes?”
Draco’s eyebrows went up, and he opened his mouth to respond, but –
“I can’t blame him,” Draco said quietly. “Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and push myself off a tower.”
"Is it your arm you're worried about? I had a friend in France who lost her arm to a dragon and --" Malfoy stopped walking because Harry had stopped. Harry had stopped walking because all the blood had rushed from his head and was worried he might fall over. "Oh," Malfoy said, taking in his pale, furious face. "Right. Sorry. I forgot we're supposed to pretend like we don't know."
“Hmm,” said Malfoy, and Harry smiled to himself.
“There are still three class periods left today,” McGonagall protested, and then, seeing his face, added very hastily, “which I will cover for you myself.”
"Then come and have a go," Malfoy said, holding out a cue.
Malfoy was right. Harry got angry. "Oh, because if I had a cane, I wouldn't need a railing, is that it? You think I went mental over something I should've taken care of myself? It’s my fault I fell down the other day, is it?"
"That's all right," Harry said. "Maybe I'll be
"You know," Harry confessed, "it honestly never occurred to me that our professors didn't
"Potter," Malfoy said. "Your sleeve's in the gravy."
don't know? Bad enough that his secret was apparently out; was it a topic of discussion, too? Were people laughing behind his back, gossiping about all the ways he was weakened and useless? Quietly, he said, "What do you mean?"
“Looks like you’ll have to stay close,” Harry said, voice low. “I might need to grab onto you.”
“Er – something about – my neck –”
The smile was wiped off his face, however, when he saw the group of students clustered at the end of the bridge. It was Jacob and his third-year army. They had textbooks and parchment out and seemed to be studying in the fresh air, and he hoped maybe they’d be so serious and concentrated that they wouldn’t pay any mind to Harry and Malfoy passing through their little group – but this hope was dashed almost immediately. Jacob glanced up and saw them coming, and urgently began speaking to his friends. Even from nearly twenty feet away Harry could see them all look up like hunting dogs on the scent.
"Ah, she's upstairs crying over Rosie's crib," said George, when Ron asked. "You know how she gets when she's drunk. All right, Harry?"
"That isn't the point," Malfoy said furiously. "The point is, you need to take better care of yourself."
"You open the door, Harry," Neville said. "It's always liked you."
"Most mornings," said Malfoy. "The cold helps wake me up. Got a late start today, as you can see. It's nearly three."
"Erm -- your chair's actually a bit -- I'd rather stand."
Harry, because he was a paranoid bastard, nodded, and Malfoy held out his wand and let a ribbon of text spool out from the tip. Harry had seen enough forged certifications to know that this one was legitimate, even though most of it was in French. Healer Malfoy. Would wonders never cease?
Things got weird in his head when he started thinking along the lines of
"Dad sends his love," Hanna said, sliding into the chair by his bed.
“Lots of arrests, is what,” said Negasi. “Sorry it took so long for us to come find you, Harry – Nimpkins busted into the wrong house at first, the idiot, had to memory-wipe an entire family of Muggles. Anyway, we’re waiting for the Healers. You both got conked on the head and we didn’t think it wise to apparate either of you just yet.”
"Shit," Harry said.
McGonagall looked up from her bowl of soup. “He got a lead on a source for Finicky Rattler venom,” she said. “It’s rare enough that we both thought it best not to tarry, so he’s gone for the afternoon.”
Harry gave him a pat on the shoulder. "I'm okay, Neville, only my bloody knee gave out. It doesn't even hurt that badly, just decided to skive off work with no warning. Hi, Professor McGonagall, I'm fine, please no one make a fuss."
It was unclear how long he lay there, gasping. Pure reflex had had him twisting in time to make sure he landed on his good side, which was the only mercy, and he curled up as small as he could go, as if that might give the pain less surface area to deal with. The pain stole every thought he had, it stole his very mind and turned him into nothing more than a body, a conduit for agony, like the Cruciatus but unrelenting because there was no one on the other side of it to lower their wand and grant him a reprieve. All he could do was try to keep breathing until it released him enough to be himself again.
"What in the name of the Morrigan is wrong with them?" Draco said. He'd let go of Harry's arm.
?" he asked.
Negasi glanced around, clearly spooked. “Where
"This is your office, of course," she said. "Then, through that door and down a small passageway you'll find your chambers."
Harry took the arm and they set off, as promised, very slowly. Harry could hear the shouts of his students from somewhere in the region of Honeydukes and it struck him as absolutely ludicrous that he was walking arm-in-arm with Draco Malfoy of all people, through Hogsmeade. Draco Malfoy, who'd poisoned Katie Bell just over there. Who'd thrown rocks at Harry down that street there. Who was being so careful with him right now, right here, walking so slowly, not seeming to mind that Harry was a lurching, stiff-legged, proper mess of a man.
There it was.
“Lumos,” he murmured, and Betsy’s excellent cane lit up like a torch. The passage was of brick, and it wasn’t far until he hit a door that opened into an alleyway. It was warmer here in Brighton than it had been in northern Scotland and was raining lightly, the sky bright white as if the sun were lurking just beyond the layer of clouds. The air smelled of brine, and Harry took a deep breath of it as he made his way onto the street to get his bearings. He felt a bit calmer now that he was here, taking action, though still he couldn’t fight the battery of images his treacherous brain kept supplying: Draco, tied up and bloody as he himself had once been; Draco, lifeless in a heap; Harry, too late to save him.
Malfoy suddenly dropped his gaze from Harry's face to the stack of parchment on his desk. He adjusted his quill in its inkpot and moved a jar of something green from the right side of the desk to the left. "I want to be clear," Malfoy said, addressing the jar of something green, "that -- that I'm sorry for what happened to you."
“Fine,” Negasi said, vigorously shaking out his hands, “only my limbs are all asleep and they took my wand. I got here just about ten minutes before you, accidentally apparated right onto the bartop and got Stupefied by the barkeep before I knew what was happening. I heard your voice through the kitchen door and then a bloody great crashing sound and I thought you were done for, I nearly shat myself!”
"Okay so not to make any assumptions, but you're looking for a functional medical-grade assistive device, yeah? We're not talking like, ornamental walking cane 'cause it looks badass."
He heard rather than saw the enormous crash of the lamp and of Craig’s body hitting the floor, because he was too busy trying not to get strangled by Phil, who’d thrown his meaty hands around Harry’s neck and was avidly squeezing. Harry, unable to get enough breath for a spell, jabbed him in the eye with his wand, and when he howled, grip faltering, Harry gasped “Stupefy!”
the day before she arrived? So now she's like, totally stranded in the Wand Historiography department and is scrambling to try and make connections with all these extremely suspicious old people her supervisor was supposed to grease the wheels with, and -- anyway, it's just a boring academic nightmare, but she says the city's beautiful so she's just been hiking like ten hours a day. How tall are you?"
Harry nearly choked. Diamond-plated? Oh, merciful mother of Merlin.
“Hi professors!” Jacob said.
He followed Malfoy to the little sandy beach, unsurprised to notice that his footprints matched the footprints Harry had seen earlier. Malfoy lay down his red towel and shucked off his shoes and then seemed to hesitate, fingers fiddling with the buttons of his long-sleeved white shirt, which looked as expensive as everything he wore. If Harry didn't know better, he'd think Malfoy was self-conscious, but what on earth did he have to be self-conscious about, especially compared to Harry?
"It's all right," Malfoy said. "I would've liked to've watched you beat it."
She held up a hand. "You are forgiven. But in the future I'd kindly ask you to bring up any issues you may have
Harry looked down at himself. He’d forgotten he was wearing Hermione’s pink fleece, and he laughed. “It’s the Minister’s.”
"I'm all right," he said, "but I need you to go and fetch Professor Longbottom, can you do that?"
She pursed her lips as she matched her pace to his. "The potions classroom is closer to your quarters, on the third floor," she said. "I'm sure Draco wouldn't mind if I asked him to --"
"Harry," Neville said, coming over from the faculty table. "Are you all right?"
Harry followed their gaze and said, “Oh! No, nothing’s happened, it’s just – something to help me walk.” He looked at them incredulously. “Have you not noticed that I -- erm, limp a bit?”
"The Chairs 'n' Chairs woman? Yeah, how'd you know?"
He ended up in a thestral-pulled carriage with two students -- a third-year named Griggs who'd been hit with a vertigo charm and couldn't stay upright but refused to miss the first Hogsmeade weekend, and a seventh year named Keisha who had ambitions to being an Auror and had clearly only been pretending to feel poorly so she could have a chance to pepper Harry with questions outside of school hours. He'd have minded more if the canny maneuver hadn't put him somewhat in mind of himself as a teenager.
“They think we’re dating,” Harry blurted out.
Harry nodded, and put his good hand on the arm of the chair. It really was miraculously uncomfortable, and his hip was stiff enough that rising was going to be a bit of a production. He held his breath and gave it his best shot, which failed him. Malfoy suddenly found his stack of parchments very interesting again. Red-faced, Harry gave it another go, and this time he managed to get all the way upright. The potion he'd taken at breakfast was beginning its slow fade, reminding him of his primary reason for visiting, and as he turned he looked closely at the brass lock on the door of the wooden cabinet.
“He’s a Healer,” Harry said. “Of course he was worried about me. Healers are problem-solvers and I’m a bloody problem.”
“I will,” Draco promised. “Give her my love, will you?”
“Watch carefully,” she said. “Here’s how the wand goes in. See this little silver circle on the handle? You just –” she lowered the tip of his wand down and a moment later it had vanished into the wood. “Then, when you’re ready, it’s that little raised knot right here.” She pressed it, and the wand sprang out into her hand, while the cane stayed perfectly upright even though she wasn’t holding it any longer. “Oh, and there’s a stabilizing charm on it,” she said. “Figured it wouldn’t do you much good if it was clattering over every time you went for your wand.”
Harry stepped back fully into the flames. “Harry Potter’s bedroom,” he said loudly, and Draco’s face – tight and expressionless – swirled into nothing.
A moment later, Harry's knee buckled. Malfoy caught him in surprisingly strong arms, holding him for long enough to right him, then reinstated the charm.
Feeling awkward with both Betsy and Draco watching him, Harry took the cane on a trip around the store, leaning very lightly on it at first and then more heavily, testing its limits. It was extraordinarily comfortable to hold, and he realized she’d carved the wood to fit his own hand – which explained the plateful of goo, and made it seem very worthwhile. The support itself was also excellent: he felt steadier with the cane in his hand, more balanced and less fearful of falling, and the weight it took off his bad hip and knee was enough to make a marked difference in his pain.
"It's quite all right," said McGonagall. "Are
"Snuck past her while she was watering her jade plant," Hanna said, looking him up and down. "You look much better than last time I saw you."
“I only mean – you know.”
"They won't believe me, Professor," she said confidently. "They won't
very good."
, with a small black circle beneath the words.
"If you're in a hurry for any reason, you should go on ahead," Harry said. "I'm not exactly fast."
“I’m not a myth,” Harry said. “I’m a person. And I want you…" He tried to be honest. "I want you, of all people, to see that person.”
"Well," Harry said generously, "you have much better hair."
Harry turned, grinning. He found he did not care if he was terrible -- he was glad just to be playing. And anyway, not all his shots were as bad as the first. They weren't nearly as good as they'd once been, but although he and Neville were sorely beaten by Malfoy, it was as much Neville's fault as his, and he sank enough balls to make it feel like he was getting somewhere.
Malfoy, it turned out, had been correct. McGonagall granted both of them leave from the castle for the entire evening, so they agreed to meet on the bridge the following day after class. It was just past six when Harry made it out of the castle, and the mid-October air was chilly but clear, the sun hovering soft above the tree line and casting everything in the rosy, forgiving light of late afternoon. Malfoy’s hair was so golden it looked burnished and Harry thought he suddenly understood all the fuss about blondes.
“Merlin, your students were right,” Ron said, jiggling Rosie mechanically as she began to whimper. “You really do like him, don’t you?”
Harry stared, then broke out laughing. "You know, I'd forgotten it was even a possibility. You get used to going without, at Hogwarts. Where's Hermione?"
"Excellent," Harry echoed. As Malfoy neared, Harry saw he had a tiny, winking diamond stud in one of his delicate nostrils, and for some reason this seemed the biggest change from Hogwarts as Harry had known it.
“All right?” Harry said, trying to get through them as quickly as possible.
Draco glanced up from the menu and to Harry’s surprise, he looked grim. “It’s not the most flattering story. Not flattering to me, anyway – Betsy comes off looking lovely as ever.”
Harry closed his eyes. He expected this from Hermione, sure. From Ron, a bit. From Molly Weasley. But from Draco bloody Malfoy? "Well, maybe you should brew better potions."
Experimentally, Harry released her to reach for his glass. She gave another strong lurch and wriggle, but Ron was right: she was perfectly secure. For once, his accidental spellcasting had done something useful instead of destructive. "I'll keep her."
And now the man's daughter was forced to take notes while he lectured on hexes.
What he needed going forward, he decided, was more fun.
Malfoy sighed. "Can we play another game of pretend and pretend I didn't say anything?"
"Show me how it works?"
"If you --" She seemed mobile enough, but you never could tell "-- If you're having your own trouble getting to class, we could talk to Headmistress McGonagall and --"
And, oh, there it was, sweet relief. It swept through Harry like a spring rain, the roar of his leg and the growl of his shoulder fading until they were mere whimpers. He had done it! Thank Merlin, it had worked.
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry said. “I honestly – this is just –”
“Grab him,” he heard Gregory shout, and hands reached out towards him. Someone grabbed his bad arm and twisted it behind his back and he couldn’t help but shout, his good leg buckling, but his bad knee was still Locked rigid and he used it to keep himself upright as he aimed at Gregory and knocked him out just as he’d picked up his wand again. Gregory hit the floor hard and a woman screamed.
“Where’s Dougie? We’re all waiting downstairs.”
“Because this shouldn’t be happening to you, that’s why,” Harry said. “Whoever’s sent it didn’t use a standard Howler envelope, so I might be able to trace the stationary or the spell and find out who–”
"Absolutely not, we're going to the hospital wing. We only have eighteen minutes left until this wears off, and we need to be somewhere we can keep an eye on you when it does."
"Yes," Harry said staunchly. "We've got this massive, magical castle at our disposal, but all we ever do is grade papers and trudge around the lake."
“Truly,” Betsy said. “It was my pleasure. And an honor.”
. What happened to him?”
“It’s odd,” Draco said. “To be on the right side of Harry Potter’s famous friendship.”
"Keep going -- slowly! Yes, it's true, though we're only talking one or two students a year. Just because these types of -- of maladies -- are rare in the wizarding world does not mean that they don't occur."
They were on the flagstones before the castle entrance, now, and a thick group of laughing, chatting students was coming towards them. Harry was suddenly aware that he was very red-faced, and standing very close to Malfoy, and swaying a bit on his feet. He took a step back, nodding and smiling at the students who streamed past them: nothing to see here, I wasn't yelling at your Potions master, we were just in a bit of friendly academic banter, lovely day!
Harry glanced over and found Draco watching him at that very moment. So was he flirting right now? Or was he waiting for Harry to topple over?
Malfoy opened his mouth, then closed it. He looked a bit flushed. He opened his mouth again. Closed it again.
"Out?"
“No,” Harry said, trying to smooth out his expression. “Only hungry, all of a sudden.” He managed a smile. “Fancy an appetizer?”
“Potter,” he said. “I feel as if I’m missing something.”
Harry, by force of habit, had turned towards the Gryffindor table, and he let Neville redirect him up to the professor's table at the head of the room. McGonagall was already there in the Headmistress' position, and Harry had to breathe through the memory of another person sitting in that very chair, twinkling blue eyes, long grey beard.
"Hi," he said brightly. "Sorry to've missed class. Hope you took advantage and slept late for a few days."
"Yeah, and he's tweaked the recipe, actually. They're much better now."
"Right," Ron said, settling himself on the couch at Harry's feet. "Well, she did technically have pasta, only it was ramen noodles -- and she did technically have tomato sauce, only it was ketchup -- but what she
Harry was distracted -- he'd strayed to a bookshelf and discovered a stack of antique magazines, their photos moving in that blurry, disjointed fashion old photos had, and they were unequivocally a 1920s version of gay pornography. He was absolutely too horny to handle looking at the photos for any longer than necessary, and too horny, also, to fully process the implications -- which seemed to decisively point, once and for all, to the fact that Malfoy was, indeed, interested in blokes.
"Harry," Malfoy said, and suddenly his hand was on Harry's locked and outstretched knee, his touch featherlight, so brief Harry thought he might've imagined it. Startled, Harry looked up. Those blue, blue eyes were fixed on his. "I know you have no reason to trust me," Malfoy said. "But I swear -- I swear that right now, I'm only trying to help you. I'm not interested in hurting you any further."
"I have a theory. I think you won't use anything because you're a paranoid bastard and you want to keep your wand-hand free. Just say yes or no, Potter."
If Harry had stayed in London, if he'd taken the godforsaken paper-pushing desk job the Ministry had offered, would he still be invited drinking with his old colleagues? Or would they get close-mouthed when he came near, retreating into that aura of Auror secrecy he'd been so glad to be a part of? Maybe he should have just taken the damn job instead of locking himself up in the middle-of-nowhere Scotland where his one friend would rather look at cactuses than drink with him.
"Hello, Jacob," Malfoy said.
It should have been easy. Harry had a prescription, and all he had to do was give it to Malfoy, the Potions master, and he knew Malfoy would have to make it -- but the idea of this was abhorrent to him on nearly every level. For one thing, that was like giving Malfoy explicit permission to poison him. For another, although he wished he could claim otherwise, the truth was that he was embarrassed by the limitations of his body and didn't want to broadcast his vulnerabilities to someone who would no doubt take pleasure in them.
"Just like old times," Neville said happily, and bounded away down the staircase, with such ease that Harry had to turn away.
“Your shoulder in particular will probably need to be immobilized for a while,” Draco said, and put a palm over the joint in question. His touch was careful, wary of causing more pain, but Harry thought he could feel the warmth of it even through the fleece. “And your wrist.” Gently, he smoothed his hand down Harry’s arm and wrapped his beautiful fingers briefly around Harry’s aching wrist. “Your fingers too, I’m afraid,” he added, and cradled Harry’s scarred hand in his own.
"She's not holding it very well now, though, is she?" said Harry, and right on cue, there was a retching sound from the bathroom off the kitchen.
“Yes, I have!” Neville said. “We’re friends too, you know, he had to talk to
Malfoy snorted and turned towards the enormous wooden sign that proclaimed "Chairs 'n' Chairs," and Harry -- quite reasonably, he thought -- expected to enter a shop filled with chairs. And there were chairs, yes, but there was so much more. It smelled wonderful, the air rich with cedar, maple, blackthorn, hickory, and everywhere he looked, richly polished wooden furniture and intricate wooden baubles gleamed. There was an enormous bed carved to resemble a walnut shell, a couch with the feet of a Hippogriff, and a series of floating wooden rings that moved in and out of one anothers' orbit and was one of the most calming things Harry had seen since Hanna's bubbles.
He gripped Neville's shoulder and let him take some of his weight, and together they made their way slowly down the brief stairs and across the Great Hall. By that time Harry's leg had limbered up enough to let him walk unsupported, and Neville ambled along beside him until they came to the wide, twisting marble steps that led to the sixth floor.
“Not really my concern at the moment,” Harry said. “But the doors’ll stay sealed the rest of the day and we can send a clean-up crew by nightfall.”
“He came to meet Craig about some venom,” the man said. “Only there was no venom, there was only the three of us.” He grinned as if at a fond memory. “Put up a good fight for such a proper-looking fellow, but eventually Craig knocked him out the old-fashioned way and we got him tied up. Then come Lizzie and her husband to take him, I don’t know where. And before you ask, I don’t know why, either.”
"That's still working for you?" Malfoy said, nodding at the empty vial.
"Enough for me," Harry said, "or I won't be able to move this arm at all tomorrow."
“You have not,” said Harry, beginning to grin. “You’ve been infuriatingly subtle.”
“Oh,” said Draco, “yes, no, it looks excellent. Really nice work.”
"Why didn't you apparate?"
Ron sat up, eyes glowing. "No!"
“Er,” Draco said. “A bit of both?”
"Blimey," he said, "I've got to get to bed!"
Despite the fact that he was running a bit late, he tried to keep his pace unhurried; difficult for someone who’d once hurried everywhere, but he'd taken enough tumbles in the past year and a half to not tempt fate. His leg ached unrelentingly, a dull throb twisting down the curse line from his hip to his knee, but it was doing a good impression of reliability today, none of the looseness in his knee joint that meant it might buckle at any time. Good; he didn’t want his first impression on his students to include going arse over teakettle in the Great Hall.
Draco glanced at him. They were nearing the Shrieking Shack, now; Harry could see the thestrals prancing restlessly in place, and he realized Draco would be able to see them, too. They’d both seen their fair share of death.
"It's four ten," Malfoy said. "Well -- four eleven, now."
The name tugged at his memory, and he let go of the wall in order to stick his wand between his teeth and dig in the back pocket of his jeans. Negasi’s letter from that very morning was still there, and he shook it until it unfolded, then skimmed the text.
“Fine,” Harry called, surprised to hear how normal his voice sounded. He would have expected it to come out a croak. “Just the knee – you go on –”
Malfoy shrugged, looking unconvinced. "Time will tell," he said.
"Here comes Professor Malfoy now," Harry said, "maybe you can talk to him, instead."
Then, both of them at once, "Please don't tell Hermione --"
“The Squib?”
It was not a sex dungeon. It was not a dungeon at all. It was an elegant room with windows that looked out over the night sky, everything made of dark shining wood and velvet. To one side was a bar with three green high-backed velvet stools and what looked like a very well-stocked liquor cabinet; on the other side was an old-fashioned record player with an enormous stack of records. There were several plush couches, a bookshelf full of what looked like board games, and, in the center of the room, a billiards table with the balls already racked and ready.
Ron raised an eyebrow. "That's been happening?"
“We ought to give them more detentions,” Harry said, “that’ll distract them.”
Harry focused on spearing a forkful of peas, embarrassed to've answered outright. Well, no one had ever told him how to answer student queries about his bedchamber.
Malfoy had the temerity to laugh at this.
"No, not quite,” Malfoy said, smirking. “She's part elf."
"Very few," said Malfoy. "Many of us went in... different directions. I'm closest with Blaise Zabini, if you remember him?"
"All right, we'll start with attendance. If I say your name wrong or if you'd like to be called something else, let me know. And --" He tried to recall what Hermione had told him about ice-breaking exercises, "Tell the class -- er -- tell us what you dressed as for Halloween last year."
