"Darling! Has Mr Weasley left already?" Narcissa looked at him, pale and scared, but he managed a smile.
"Draco." She sounds pleading. "You have done so much for me, and I have failed you so badly, son. Will you at least listen to me? If you still feel that I don't care then I can leave the Manor afterwards and you are free to build your life alone."
"No, she gave up after two years, when we couldn't do anything for her. The vaults in Gringotts indicated that you were still alive. So there was nothing the Aurors could do." Harry sighs,"Yaxley tried to imperius her, to get to the money. Which is why we arrested him in the first place."
“Ron?” He teases gently, knowing full well that Pansy nurses a crush on the tall Redhead.
* * *
"Yaxley contacted me, after the trial. He told me that I would soon be dead if I didn't disappear." I am still not sure why I just bolted, but then again, people had not been kind and I always protected myself. "I wasn't willing to take a chance, and left the wizarding world."
"Just let me polish your wand, and then it is done."
"Why are you telling me this? I mean, why not just bring me into the courtroom?"
"I see what you mean. Have you specially trained her?" I find myself asking. Not quite willing to leave her company already.
He is not alone, never has been.
The shop had small windows, but they still let in enough light so that it didn’t feel gloomy. The insides were cluttered, with shelves up to the ceiling. However there was also a polished counter with an old fashioned till on top and a couple of armchairs for customer discussions.
He tells the court about his connection to Voldemort, about his insight to Draco's personal nightmares and he talks about the fact that the killing of Albus Dumbledore was not a murder, but a mercy killing, that Severus Snape had been sworn to fulfil his promise by Dumbledore himself.
He is so deeply entranced into the pattern construction, that once again Harry suddenly appears next to the construction table.
The words are out before he has a chance to think them through, and he could hit himself. Why must he flirt with Harry, now the other man will surely be uncomfortable.
In the five years that he had been working with Bill, he had learned to take his time. Of course he had never rushed into danger like Potter and his gang, but he had been cocky and had earned himself several burns long before he had learned to approach the cursed objects with a healthy respect. By now he knew how to avoid triggering the traps, hidden beneath harmless surfaces.
He had gone through most of the possible core fixes already and now began his focus on the wood that made up Draco's wand. Reading through the tomes he had taken from his library.
He continued to chatter until they were back in the house, where he traipsed into the living room.
Thankfully, she doesn’t make him suffer for long. In the afternoon he receives a reply. Draco stares at the letter for a long time, wondering how he has deserved such a kind welcome.
“I am gonna come, if you keep this up!” Draco moans, and Harry pulls of with an obscene popping sound before grinning at him, “Good, I need to take the edge of for you, before I get you ready for me. Now lie back and enjoy.” Before he gets back to the task, and Draco forgets all conscious thought. It is an embarrassingly short amount that passes before Draco can't hold any more and empties himself into that talented mouth. Harry grins at him, like the cat that got the cream and Draco can't contain an amused chuckle.
"No, he is a Phoenix, a fighter. At least I believe he is." I look him over and decide to keep him until I can figure out if someone is missing him. "Thank you for your help. I need to head to bed, can I take him with me?"
"Thank you." Draco raised his glass. "To new beginnings."
"We have one that only you could break." His hand touches my cheek and I lean into his touch.
He works diligently, through each room. He scrubs the floors, strips the old wallpapers and reapplies new ones in bright colours. Still the Manor still looks depressing. More often than not Draco feels like giving up, but then he trudges on. He searches for old furniture that exudes the elegance that he remembers from his childhood. He finds some sort of solace hiding in these memories of happier times, but he knows that he won't be able to hide within the past forever.
The door closes and he is alone. The undrunk tea still on the table, he stares into nothingness for a long time, until Mipsy comes back and gently steers him from the room to bed. He sleeps without recollection of nightmares for the first time in ages.
"I left the wizarding world, and stumbled over a woman with a therapy dog in the park. Lucy helped me open up about the horrors that I had seen and I found myself wanting to help others do the same. I guess without Lucy I would have turned to drugs or other things to help me get over this. But with her I could talk about the things that moved me, I had a reason to get up, and every time that I felt like giving up, she was there and made me smile again. It took time, but I got better."
"No" he croaked "I couldn't let them burn." He closed his eyes, the words flowed even though his throat hurt "We were brewing, I was gathering the last scraps of evidence and suddenly there was a little girl, I have no idea where she came from, maybe someone left the wards open on accident. They had set up the lab in a family neighbourhood. Suddenly she was in the lab and someone must have been so startled by her appearance that they dropped the jar with the exploding ginger eyelashes, because the next thing was a loud explosion, then there was fire and she was screaming."
He forces himself to eat, but the welcome feast that used to be the highlight of many years, tastes like sawdust to him and he eats more out of obligation than true appetite. So mired is he in his thoughts that he fails to notice just how keenly the Headmistress watches him, and how the eyes of a former Slytherin stray towards him again and again as well.
The gasps ring through the courtroom, but Draco focuses only on the Wizard reading out the crimes, he looks incredulously at him but continues to read out the crimes at first.
"You know the way to my heart." Draco clutched at his chest, secretly enjoying the fact that he could make Bill laugh.
Although it should creep him out, that somebody has watched him this closely, Draco cannot help smiling again, as he sips his tea and sucks away at the candy cane. He has no doubt that this is probably a huge joke, and someone will spoil this little innocent fantasy soon enough. But he is determined to enjoy the illusion of someone caring, even just a little, and he works with a little more fervour, to get things done. The reminder that there are people who love him, even if they are far and few, is spurring him on. Suddenly Draco is determined to get his Christmas shopping done early this year, mother has mentioned that she would like a new scarf, and aunt Andromeda, to whom he has just carefully began to talk via owl, would surely like a little token as well. Which brings him to his second cousin, what would he like, Draco wonders? He gets quickly lost in thought and so remains completely unaware of green eyes watching him.
"Look this is what the Blacks have written." Harry thrust the book in Draco's direction.
Draco found himself nodding again, hoping to regain some sort of control over his emotions.
Harry looked at the fallen around the battlefield, at the wands in their hands, and deep within himself he felt a new purpose take hold of him.
“Ey, are you flirting with my girl?” Ron laughs as he comes back to the table with the usual drinks.
“So what are your plans then? Surely you will not just stick around here? I mean going back for your NEWTs is probably not an option.”
“Hello Teddy.” He waves softly and before he knows it Andromeda presses the child into his arms. “Hold him for a second.” She doesn’t seem concerned that he could drop the child and he holds the baby, who glances up at him, as if not quite knowing what to make of the strange man that holds him. When his mouth draws into a moue of unhappiness, Draco hastily begins to bounce the child in his arms, hoping to distract him for a bit, before the all-out crying breaks out again.
“So you think it is not only the fact that we both are guys.” Draco voices his biggest fear.
"Scared Malfoy?" He teases, when I hesitate a little to long.
“This is where I have to tell you that yes, men can get pregnant, and that the lack of equipment is exactly why you feel like shit at the moment. Harry, I have to send you to someone who can actually help you, and I can’t stress highly enough that you have to see them immediately. In fact, I will transfer you, as soon as I made a floo call, because I can’t answer the questions that you have, as much as I want to.”
When they enter the small nursery, the sound has increased to an all-out wail, indicating that Teddy is not at all happy with being left to his own devices now that he is awake. Andromeda steps up to the bed and pulls Teddy to her chest, holding him securely.
A nod.
"Draco Malfoy you are hereby declared innocent of the crimes you were accused of. You are free to leave the Ministry and return to Malfoy Manor."
"So, how long will the tour be? Not that I want to get rid of you, but you said you have to work today?"
“I love you, Mum.”
Harry knew that he was in trouble. Draco occupied his dreams and his waking moments. He wondered what his fingers would feel like, on and inside of his body. And if he did not misinterpret the gestures and innuendos entirely, the other man felt similarly. But giving into his desires and seducing Draco felt wrong when he knew that he would leave probably soon.
“Draco…”
"How can you be so sure?"
“All I want is for you to be happy. So of course we can.”
When someone thrusts a steaming cup into my direction I am startled. "Here Draco." The soft female voice belongs to a woman with blond hair, and a gentle smile.
didn’t work.”
Harry opened his mouth but found he didn’t have an answer, it had never come up, and the last two winters Draco had not even been in the country, instead fleeing to warmer places. It was only because of Harry’s job that he had stayed in England this year.
Then he just left him, stewing on the topic. So what if he liked a certain type of men? It was not Ron’s business. Just because he had met his one true love at school, didn’t mean everyone else did too… In his eyes Draco had made it clear that there was no chance for anything between them, with his actions more than words.
Draco on the other hand seemed to have settled here quite firmly. Harry felt a bout of envy at the thought of Draco being so at ease with the situation. He would like to find that for himself and if he was entirely honest with himself, he wanted Draco in his bed at least once before he had to pack up and leave.
“Well Gentlemen,” McGonagall took up the conversation again. “Since Hogwarts demands that you two reconcile, I will open a teacher's apartment and have you room together for the next week. I trust that this is enough time to solve the problems between you two! The rooms are protected against hexes and curses.”
"Well, this is where it becomes the legend. They lived happily for a while. Lysette was a gifted healer and treated many children of the villagers. But then the plague broke out and she was helpless against the sickness, those who had happily taken her help turned against her and accused her of cursing the village. The mob accosted her in the woods when she was out gathering herbs with Lance. He fought valiantly to protect her, but was killed here. When his blood soaked the ground Lysette told the villagers, that upon her death two trees would grow in this very spot. And that this would prove her innocence. The villagers struck her down as well, but when they wanted to drag the corpses through the mud, lighting struck. In place of the two dead lovers, these trees stood."
“What is it? Maybe if you speak about it, I can set it into perspective? I mean I was always great in deflating your ego.” Draco said it with laughter, but in his eyes Harry saw true concern.
"What happened to my wand?" He tried to focus on the here and now, he still felt normal if a little weak, so the healers had managed to stabilise him in time.
"I am sorry," Draco mouthed to Bill.
, do you know what that is?"
"Thought so." She took another swallow of her wine. "You didn't manage to address the erumpent in the room, being you. Now he comes back and treats you with polite distance, just like you set up during the last years. But you want and expect him to just fall in bed with you, when he has no idea what has been going on in your life? That you actually want him to talk to you, that you want more that a working relationship."
"But that makes no sense." Draco didn't understand a word.
"I thought we would have a picnic?” Harry was confused
"Hey, feeling better?"
I cannot keep my cool for much longer. opening the door to see what on earth Potter is doing with my mother, but what I see freezes me at the doorstep.
Draco stepped closer, and the soft rustling of the trees grew more pronounced. A branch of the Holly tree touched his cheek softly, but not scratching and the Hawthorn - he felt a lump in his throat.
He had researched all of the essences that he had soaked the wood in and all of the cores that he wanted to add, but what if he was wrong? What if the issue lay not with the core or with the wood? What if it was something else entirely?
Draco felt as if punched, his given name from Potter's mouth, sounded strangely right, but he had been wholly unprepared for the shiver it sent down his spine.
"Get to it, Harry."
"But he bears the Dark Mark!" someone yells out and Draco smiles for the first time freely. He indicates for Potter to roll up his left sleeve and there they see only one thing. Potter flinches back.
"You are right. But it was Yaxley, who killed Theo." Harry is very quiet all of a sudden.
He picks him up and carefully takes him inside, into the sparse warmth of his home. But the injured creature feels the gentle heartbeat against his body and burrows closer. The softly spoken words resounding in his ears
He goes about his daily business, keeping the interaction with his colleagues to a minimum. After all, all they can spare him are dark looks and halfhearted mutters about the fact that if he steps one toe out of line they will have Draco carted off to Azkaban far quicker that he would know. So Draco does his job quietly and goes about his business, until the bruises on his soul have healed, to a point, that his open wounds have scarred.
"Lynn", She returns the introduction. "Trust me, I am working with veterans and traumatized people. There is not a lot that I can't imagine," and her smile dims a little. "Lucy is a wonderful help, because most people forget the tight control that they have on their negative emotions, when she is around. It helps to cry and to realize that you have suffered. She doesn't judge. That is the great thing about animals."
Astoria Greengrass had written a painfully polite letter to him, requesting the formal dissolution of their betrothal. He had been so happy that he had allowed himself a whoop of joy within the confines of his room.
She is truly horrified, but he finds himself laughing. It must border on histrionics, because he finds himself drenched with water from her wand before long.
It will take time and effort, but I am convinced that my instinct is right.
So caught up in thoughts was he that he didn't notice Draco standing at his table. "Ok, Potter, you obviously have time to kill but we do need the table." Before he could get angry though, Draco gave him a piece of paper, with a laugh. "Why don't you tell me where you are staying? I promise that I will show up there after my shift is done and then we can talk about your obvious questions."
“Promise you will drop by at Maman's for dinner?” Draco asked before getting out of the car. Harry looked at him and knew that refusing Draco anything was not on his agenda. But instead of exploiting what was probably written all over his face, Draco simply pressed a kiss to his cheek and waved him goodbye.
“Of course I’ll come.” He had kissed Teddy’s head and turned to Mipsy. “I’ll be back in a bit.”
"Hello Draco." Harry felt the nervous energy thrum through himself. This was him, this was why he was an Auror, not because of saving kittens and calming old witches because their neighbours heard music too loud.
He has to admit though that he had missed the former Slytherin desperately, and didn’t understand just why the other man had disappeared directly after their eighth year.
His thoughts drift back to the last time he held this wand, the way it had felt in his trembling, bleeding hand, how he had put all of his trust into the wand and its other owner.
“I know, but at least then I can say that I gave my all to help them, I won’t be a weapon. And I have all of this supposed magical power. Casting healing spells is exhausting.” Harry smiles that slow, sweet smile that seems to be reserved for Teddy and him. “Also I know that you would be looking after me.”
“Is it worth fighting for?” She touches his arm, before he can answer the question, she continues on, “He is in the unused potions room. Just so you know…”
“So, it would not be enough to cancel the charms?” Harry said quietly.
“Harry stop! There is no one in my life!” Draco grabs his hands. He stares at Harry’s face, as if looking for something. He breathes deeply “There has never been a relationship, since I left. I never let anybody close enough. Yes, there have been one night stands, I mean I haven’t lived celibate, but an emotional connection? I couldn’t. “
Draco gave in to his mother's nagging to get out of the house. She all but ordered him to take a stroll in the park and not to come back until he had at least been to his favourite picnic spot.
When he returned to Hogwarts, he kept out of the way of others, trying to make them feel more comfortable about him being there. He is aware that he reminds them of the evil that once sullied the school and his part in those horrors. He knows he should atone still, there are no words forthcoming, no actions that allow him to show that he will be better in the future.
Draco looked around “We are close, you can hear the waterfalls already.”
For the next few weeks I am very busy with new clients. Ever since Narcissa and Luna have given interviews for the Quibbler and the Daily Prophet, I get a lot of requests for help.
Draco snuggled closer to Harry’s heat. “Not all of us are furnaces like you. And sharing my ghosts with you is not always easy. I want Teddy to have fun, but just the idea of stepping outside, makes me clam up. I’d rather stay here by the fire and read, while you tire him out, and then cuddle up with both of you and hot chocolate. Do you think we can do this?”
Draco knows that without the potion that is cursing through his body, there would be none of the conflicting feelings he is currently experiencing. There is nervous anticipation about the flight that he will be undertaking with Harry later. He just hopes he won’t freak out once he actually gets on the broom. But there is also sorrow, because flying reminds him of Crabbe’s last minutes and the pain he felt at losing him in such a horrible way, guilt for the choices he made in the war and wonder that Harry wants to spend time with him at all.
Filius coughed, “Well, I know that you didn’t intend to do this. But I understand that you have been pranking each other since we learned weather charms?”
It takes him a few seconds to muddle through the stilted question. When he has finally figured out just what she is asking, he can feel the blush rising over his entire body.
He jerks back, to spare Harry the embarrassment. Clearing his throat awkwardly he indicates the Healer still in the room with them. His cheeks are blazing and he just hopes that he has not made the entire situation worse.
Harry starts at that. Draco smiles at him and it feels natural for the first time.
“I probably would not have approached you without the potion.” Draco chooses to be honest.
However as soon as the server takes one look at him, she scowls. “We don’t serve the likes of you here!” she all but spits out. Draco feels the colour drain from his face. He has almost forgotten that many Wizards would not be happy to see him out and about. As he ducks and wants to exit the cafe without drawing further attention to himself, he is stopped by Harry’s hand on his back.
Draco looks up at the anger in Harry’s voice. His lips are pressed together so tightly that they are a white line in his face and his eyes shine with a desperate fever. He continues his rant before Draco can even get a thought out.
The basket he lays in contains a soft blanket and just inside is a little bowl of fresh water. The basket is lower on one side so he can look outside, and Draco has placed it on top of a little step ladder, so that he doesn't have to look at the floor, but instead has a perfect overview of the store, Draco is moving behind the counter with ease, he seems to be right at home there and the smell that comes from the oven is divine. He sniffs gently and mewls contently. Here in the safe space of his mind, he can admit that his saviour has matured quite a bit, if not to say he has grown to be bloody attractive. Long legs are encased in dark blue jeans which accentuate a spectacular arse, his feet are in comfortable black slip-ons and his upper body is covered in a soft grey sweater, covered with a dark grey apron, he cannot see if there is anything written on it. Draco seems to be at home in these surroundings when he takes the soft humming and the quick smiles he has for his customers. Coffee after coffee goes over the counter and Draco never loses his patience. He has no idea how long he is watching the enigma that Draco Malfoy is to him, but after a while, he turns to check on his pet. He seems happy to see him awake and comes over quickly, to check that his bowl is filled, and scratches his head softly.
"Good day to you Mr. Malfoy." Draco shudders at the address, that to him belongs to his father, he has never felt comfortable with it. Kingsley politely ignores it. "I just wanted to inform you that your trial will take place tomorrow. I apologize for the delay, but we had quite a few trials to prepare. I trust you have been treated well?"
“I am sorry.” The words were out, before he could  think about them. “I didn’t want to blackmail you into going outside with us. I just think you are missing out on a lot of fun. Not just for Teddy, for us.”
“Well Harry, you know that I like to make an entrance…” He grins and leans into the loose curl of Harry’s arm, which tightens around his waist. Showing quite clearly that tonight he is not free for the taking. Maybe never again if Harry gets his way. And the fact that this doesn’t scare him – terrifies Draco quite a bit.
“So what are your plans for the future? I mean it is not as if you have to work for money, well apart from managing that estate which seems to be a job for itself.”
The roads are quiet and it is bittercold, snow is in the air. I am glad that the flat that I live in has an automatic heating system, otherwise, I would freeze for another two hours at least. When I think how difficult it was in the beginning, figuring out how to deal with not doing magic all of the time. The house looms ahead and I see that my neighbour is still up the lights are still on and her shadow moves through the living room, Vicky works too hard. Tomorrow she will need another extra strength coffee.
Draco talked animatedly and Harry soaked the information up, enjoying the happiness in Draco's features.
Pansy grins at Ron - “Draco has been in love with Harry since 5th year, I think he is more than ecstatic, that Harry is finally on the same page.”
“Merlin, you should see yourself. You are taking my cock so well.” Harry sounds breathless and Draco looks back over his shoulder. He feels full, stretched, but the dreaded pain has not occurred. Harry looks amazed down at their joined bodies.
Mostly he wonders how his life would have been different if he had made different choices. Choices that would make it easier to find peaceful sleep.
The next time Draco swam back to the surface of the crazy dreams, he felt a weight on his left arm pinning him down.
“Are you saying what I think you are saying?” Harry sounds baffled.
“Well as you can see, I am alive and well and not rotting away yet.” He turns in front of her, and knows that she will find him lacking. Cleaning by magic only goes so far and he has been working on the worse grime by hand. It soothes his irate thoughts, but leaves him in a right state outside. His robes are stained and torn in places. He could have changed them before coming to see her, but he was on the other side of the building and didn’t want to keep her waiting longer than needed. She wouldn’t believe his facade anyway. So let her look at him, hair all over the place, probably worse than Potter’s without the grooming charms, hands calloused and nails cracked from cleaning by hand. And he hasn’t even started on the outside, which will leave his hands probably in an even worse state.
Harry blushed a little at being caught. But he stepped up to the bar confidently, allowing Draco his own chance at appreciating the other man's backside.
"The whole one." I might not like it, but Azkaban taught me patience and the ability to listen. There was not much else to do with no visits and letters from outside...
"You knew about the bond?" Father sounds as surprised as I am.
“Oh, that is all that you have as an argument. Fine I will do as you say, but don’t expect that I will do anything to bring you joy in your little ploy.”
“Whoa! Harry, it’s me! We did have a date for flying?” The words come out jumbled and his heart is beating erratically, from the shock.
Draco grins to himself, Marianna almost lost her composure when her unwanted future daughter in law stepped out and, wore not just one, but 20 shades of pink combined into one robe.
"Damn right I am!" Draco suddenly stood in the doorway, and he was beautiful in his anger. Harry felt his heart clench at the sight of the blond man.
"Coffee?" He ventured.
“I don’t know.” Harry looks old, so much older than he is in years. But then he continues to talk. “When I learned that they had imprisoned my godfather without a trial…”
“All the time,” Harry whispers. “And I am terrified of the possibility. How would we raise Teddy? Would you stay with me, talk to him about his magical heritage? I mean no one taught me, I had to learn so much. I am sure I still don’t know half of the things that are normal to you.”
As much as Draco hates to admit it, he is slowly losing it. The music box is suspiciously unhelpful, not a single hint has escaped the old piece ever since he has taken it to his own room. So much for the Manor giving him something like a  map to happiness, more like a map towards madness. When he opens it, he keeps hearing the hauntingly beautiful lullaby though and his heart longs for someone to share this music with.
Potter takes a deep breath and begins to talk, all the while his hands keep stroking Tora's fur. "Well, after the trials - I was a mess. I had thought that with me giving my testimony in writing it should have been enough. But when I sat in on your trial and they stated an example with you, something in me broke." He looks at me and I turn away.
“My guardians were not kind people.” The words are stuck in his throat and he has to force them past his lips. His eyes are dry but burn as if sand has gotten into them and he knows that if he does not speak about this now, he most likely never will and he will be stuck with the pain and the yearning and confusion. So, they need to be spoken, but he has never anticipated how hard it would be to expose himself like this. It helps that Malfoy is just looking at him, quiet but with an intensity that warms a part of him that he did not know existed.
“I will never let go, unless you are asking me to. What you don’t get is that you make me as happy as being with Teddy makes you.”
“Please” he is beyond care that he is begging for it.
They continued their easy chat until Hannah gently shooed them out. Standing outside the Leaky, Draco cast another
So he takes his friend back towards his room, where the box sits next to his bed. Sometimes he wonders if the Manor is mocking him a little, because when he opens the box he can hear the lullaby, but nothing more. It could in all honesty just be a music box made to soothe babies.
Decision made Draco step away from the trees and the wind brushed through the green leaves.
"We all do." Harry gets up with a fluid motion. "I for one need help dancing so would you dance with me? But you need to lead."
"Would you be my fit model, for the upcoming fashion show?"
He looked bloody gorgeous in the fitted jeans, a rust-coloured, v-neck sweater and a black leather jacket, that caused Draco's trousers to get tight. His hair was tousled and he completed the look with sturdy black leather boots.
The entire wizarding world would agree with that statement. After all he had defeated the most evil wizard of all times at the young age of 17 and had then proceeded to fight through the trials for every single wizard that did not deserve an unfair sentence in his opinion. Draco Malfoy had been one of those who Harry fought for. The verdict for him had been the stipulation of finishing Hogwarts and then leaving the country for three years or the duration of his further education, whichever might be over sooner. And Harry had fought for that and not given a damn about the public opinion. He also went out of his way to shake Draco's hand after the trial had finished.
But then the man turned and graced Harry with a smile, that caused the world to drop out from under him.
* * *
"So, you were not looking for me?" I feel relieved that Harry hasn't been here to spy on me.
"I am sorry, I didn't mean to bring back painful memories." He looked at his drink and not Harry's face.
"Stop flattering me, Vic. You get coffee for free more often than not."
Draco felt his heart beat heavily against his ribcage. His wand was an extension of himself, a symbol of hope of change for him. Ever since Harry Potter had sent the wand back to him, and had told him not to disappoint him, he had guarded the wand closely. And if wielding it for a good cause made him feel like he fulfilled his promise to the wizard who had saved his life and his future, that was for him to know.
"Oh no, she just appeared shortly before the Aurors came and took Draco and his father away. She had taken a liking to Draco and when he was gone I kept feeding her. She didn't allow me to touch her though. When Draco came back, she all but clambered up on him. He smiled at her - I wish he had smiled at me like that."
“Yes, healer.” He gets up and gathers his things.
Harry is positively gushing, and Draco takes his time to look at his clothes. The cut and the fabric are exquisite if a little conservative.
"As if I will ever have a picnic when you keep telling Potter about it, and he rains on my parade then!" Draco quietly talked to himself. It was kind of ironic when he thought about it. They broke up because of a missed picnic, and now Potter is inadvertently making sure that no one else can have a picnic with Draco either.
"It is nice not to be alone," Draco's voice startles him from his revery. But he cannot ask "Then why are you?" so he settles for a soft meow. He doesn't disturb the hardworking young man until Draco drops the pen on his own.
“So do I get a birthday kiss?” He quips after a while, and Harry doesn't disappoint him. His mouth is a self-assured as the rest of him, and Draco finds himself melting against his partner. He feels the others erection digging into his hip, and gulps a little. Harry finally releases him after longs heated moment, his mouth feels swollen and his pupils must be blown wide. Draco tries to catch his breath but then Harry whispers into his ear.
Harry grins at that, but admits that he has to pop out for a change of clothes as well.  He is gone in a second but comes back within minutes, holding a bag with takeaway in his hand.
He swallows, but remains silent. All of the eight years have found their way to class by now and he sees several couples standing close. There is Padma with Tony Goldstein and Dean standing close to Seamus - he frowns a bit, when did they become an item?
There it was, a small stubborn plant, taking root on the lava flow. Harry stared at it for a long time, feeling choked and grateful for Draco's understanding.
"Oh cut it. It was unexpected, but you are welcome to call me Draco." He breathed out, hoping to not get it thrown back into his face.
"What happened?" The words were out before he had even touched the smooth finish. His fingers itched, but he had made it a policy to never take a wand from its owner, lest the wand might switch alliance on an impulse. Draco would have to put the wand on the counter before he could touch it.
When it comes to going to bed, they realise that there is only one guestroom. Draco stares at the bed with consternation, but Harry is pragmatic. With one wave of his wand, the large bed splits into two twin beds.
“You know how hot you are, but do you know that you are beautiful to me as well?” Draco feels a lump in his throat. When he looks at Harry, there is so much heat in those eyes, heat and something different as well, Draco decides then and there that he doesn't want to wait any longer.
“Teddy is awake” Andromeda rises, and motions for him to follow her. “He is your cousin, so I would like for you to meet him.”
"How may I help you?"
They are completely lost in each other gliding over the floor in twirls and soft movements while their blended voices sing on
"So why crups?" Even though he has not told me a lot, it is enough to understand quite a bit, and maybe that is what he meant when he said that we are alike, I point to the two animals settled at his feet.
He was the hero, but he was also lonely.
Blaise shrugs. “I thought you would lose control for a bit. It wasn’t really harmful, and not permanent. You got off scot free and I thought a bit of punishment was what was needed. You hurt so many people and never even said sorry!”
He is certain that anything more would not be believable, given the sort of history he shares with Potter. The Minister nods and leaves the cell with a nod and a smile.
"I can live with that, as long as she invites the Weasleys. You do know technically we are not engaged, we simply confirmed the bond."
“I know that the role of a godfather is important, and I didn’t want to intrude. I would have hoped that you had let me know about the visit before, then I would have come by later.”
"Yeah Mate ask him out for a drink. What's the worst that can happen?" Even Ron chimed in.
Draco smiled for the first time in months when Blaise had pointed out that with his hair stuck up in all directions like it was, he almost resembled a bird's nest, like a former Gryffindor they both knew, before he cheerfully hexed his best friend.
“Huh?” Harry looks up from his cup of chocolate
Hours later I cannot convince myself any longer that all is well. Something is not alright, not at all. Mother should have been back hours ago. I find myself pacing, like a caged animal.
“Well the hat sees that you are better suited with Miss Parkinson, at least for dancing so please, refrain from complaints.”
Looking at each other and shooting out of their respective seats they run towards the nursery. Draco can only think,
“Are you willing to work with us, Headmistress?” Draco asks.
Harry released a breath he hadn’t been aware he had been holding. Making his way into the kitchen he asked the house elves for hot chocolate with marshmallows, hoping to soften Draco’s ire towards him. When he stepped into the living room, the sight that greeted him, warmed his insides. Draco had pulled Teddy close to him and read him a story. Gently placing the steaming mugs in front of the two of them and settling into the armchair, with the soft grey throw, Harry stretched his legs out.
“Oh Pansy.” He wipes water from his eyes. Knowing that he must look like a drowned rodent, but finding that he doesn’t care because a tiny smile lurks in the corner of her mouth. “I am sorry I scared you.”
His quarry leans against the bar and Draco can see the bob of his Adam's apple as he swallows reflexively while looking him up and down. Appreciation is clear in those expressive eyes and the hand that stretches out towards him is confident. Draco allows himself a rare smile, one that reaches into his eyes and is rewarded with an answering smile that makes his insides tingle.
"Water," he croaked out. The weight disappeared and he felt a cup placed at his mouth. He managed to sip some water.
“I have the ability to keep your pregnancy going.”
Harry steps down from the dais, and hauls him up, before he can process what he really asked.
Potter had looked at him in that nightmare, and said, “How often do I have to rescue you? Grow up and do something with your life!” And then he pointed to the old potions classroom: “This is where you belong!”
Surely Potter was not offended about Draco removing himself from his aunt’s house? What else was he to do? As a godfather he played an important role in the baby’s life and surely wasn’t happy about Draco spending much time with him. But there is nothing that he can do, other than entering the parlour. He tries to hide his shaking hands behind his back, and keeps his back ramrod straight. But Andromeda doesn’t even give him a chance to collect his wits before striding up to him.
“Well, back then I wasn’t with Ron and didn’t really know you right?”
"Yes Draco, I love you." He seems so calm so sure, that I need to ask again.
“No.” The word is ripped from him.
At the same time Andromeda is also too observant by far and he has caught her more than once studying Harry and himself with a slight frown, as if they are a puzzle that needs to be worked out. The fact that he feels his face heat every time she catches him looking at Harry doesn’t help.
My heart is so full I feel I could burst. He said that he was in love with me back then
“Hey girl, what is so important you have to wake me up?” Gently stroking her feathers he unties the scroll from her leg, before feeding her an owl treat and sending her off to the owlery. He crawls back under the covers only to find himself pulled firmly against Harry.
Draco complies and feels Harry rub in even more lube. He feels strangely empty without Harry's fingers, but then he feels the blunt head of Harry's cock nudge against his opening. He sucks a deep breath in and then there is a sliding motion as Harry breaches his hole for the first time. It burns, but there is no huge amount of pain, Draco is so relaxed that he can take him better than he thought.
But it is wishful thinking only when there so much more important things to be done, like surviving this war in the first place., So he bans the thoughts of frivolities from his mind and concentrates on the work in front of him. It is his way of calming himself, of finding an anchor in these crazy times. It fortifies his occlumency shields in a way that nothing else can.
"Okay then, I accept your apology. Heaven knows how I would have reacted, if my parents had been held hostage. The question if you are a decent human being, well there are at least hundred-thirty years left if not more during which you can prove your worth. But that is not why I am here."
"Oh," Harry blinked
"You wish." I grin, abiding his teasing, knowing that even back then, we belonged to each other, although we would have hexed anyone to indicate as such.
"Not all of them. Remember that I had Charlie’s old wand when I started school? Many will rot in family vaults, and be forgotten. I have no idea what Mum wants to do with...  well-" Ron choked on the words.
"Are you really well again mother?" I need to know that she is strong enough to hear about my troubles. But I won't talk freely until I am sure that she is not close to breaking down again.
"Merci bien!" Harry put his passport away and headed to the rental car counter. The Airport was situated close to
"Sir, I would like to be considered for the next undercover mission"
Now he just has to figure out how an old music box will help him in that endeavour.
“We’ll take her in for observation. At least for the night. Please drop by tomorrow morning Mr Potter. We will let you know what to expect then.”
Harry all but ran back into the workshop and polished the wand with beeswax at high speed. As he walked back into the frontroom he pushed his hair back, and Draco's eyes widened.
“How would you know?”
"I left them with Narcissa, she has gone for a lie down. Patsy and Dot are napping with her." I trust my two girls with Narcissa, they know and love her by now. "Do you have time for a cuppa?"
He stares into the empty fireplace for hours.
“What do you mean? You felt dead inside as well?” Harry felt curiosity niggling at him.
“So, you are sick?”
“No.” Simple as that. Teddy looked at his cousin. Draco frowned and turned back to the newspaper.
“I should have warned you. I am not doing well with people coming up behind me.”
“I would like some hot chocolate.” Teddy grinned. “Uncle Harry, why does Cousin Draco dislike snow so much?”
“Later, I promise. For now go back to sleep.” Harry looked at the clock next to the bed. “Five in the morning is too early to go outside.”
“Pans, a couple years ago you would have said that the other way around.” He gently removes her hand from the glass and hold onto her trembling fingers.
Ron turns on him in a flash and before Draco can understand what is happening he feels his head snap from the punch and the box flies out of his hand, only to smash against the fireplace mantle. His ears are ringing and he tastes blood. The next punch will give him a severe concussion he is sure of it. But the punch never comes.
“Yes, yes! Will you please sit? Of course the order is on the house.” She places them both a little farther back so that they are hidden from the entire room, and Draco wonders if it is because she really does not want the cafe associated with him or if she is trying to give them a bit privacy.
“We’ll all go outside and play in the snow,” Harry grinned, wholly unprepared for Draco’s reply.
“Anhedonia is a symptom of depression. It basically means that you are unable to feel. I walked around in a fog. Nothing could touch me. I couldn’t verbalize what was going on. Tried to just fake the emotions where they were appropriate, before I got administered that potion. And it was the worst feeling in the world. I didn’t know what it was though, until I started to research the potion.”
“With Andy. I just panicked, but you knew how to stabilise her…”  Draco clarifies.
“I will ask Mother about you.”
The final battle had taken so many from this world, that Harry felt as if he was judged for not being fast enough. For not being
"I am glad to see that. The Aurors will bring you up tomorrow at ten am." Kingsley nods at him and moves as if to turn away. Draco hears himself blurt out at question, before he can stop himself.
"No, I was surprised that you were so kind to me, but you are not wanted for anything in the magical world." Harry smiles."If I may be so bold in asking, why did you disappear?"
"Why are you being so difficult?" the statement is so unlike her that I am taken aback.
"Hi. I hope I am not too late?" Harry grins, and Draco's confusion must show on his face, because Harry raises a bag from which an enticing smell wavers into his direction. His stomach growls loudly and he feels himself flush hotly.
“I am just trying to figure out what this one artefact could mean.” And then it just spills from his lips, he talks about his loneliness, and the Manor sending him to find the music box.
"Hey Draco, over here!" Harry had risen from the booth he had claimed a little earlier.
"Why do you indulge him so much?"
True to his word Harry stepped up next to him, only to see a pool of clear water being filled by a small cascade of water.
"He is so angry at me," Narcissa whispers.
By Merlin, Harry is fit. Gone is the scrawny little boy and gangly teenager that Draco remembers. In his place stands a well-defined man. He is not very tall, being deprived of nutrients for a long duration might stunt anyone's growth, but he carries his five foot seven proudly. He has well-defined shoulders and a trim waist, that Draco so wants to put his hands on. He longs to dress Harry in a robe specially made for him.
"Just a second. I am making us a cuppa, we will need it."
"No" Bill pushed him out of the door. "You take care of yourself, and if you come back with a new wand, or another solution I don't care. But this is not going to go away if you run."
"Don't do what?" I look into her blue eyes.
as Draco had called it.
"Well, laughter is better, than a hex and being yelled at." Harry sounds a little gruff at that
"Please don't hex me for laughing." he wipes the tears from his eyes and Harry just stares at him.
"You do look a lot better." I cannot help but quip. "Less like a street-urchin, more like a wizard."
His hands shook even more and he sat down heavily on his chair. The leather case called to him with the power of a siren's song.
Much later he finds himself, naked on the couch, covered with Harry's hot body, sated, aching and deliriously happy. Harry peppers his face with kisses, and they snog for a long while.
"Yes. He would search the whole house for her." Narcissa smiles at me "Oh..., and she absolutely
"Did you have a cat as a child?" she asks, and he wonders as well. Maybe there was a cat at home in Malfoy Manor that Draco missed while being in Hogwarts? Draco is silent for a while, but the smile on his face is sad when he answers.
. We do leave the coast again since it is three hundred meters above sea-level. They do offer guided tours. Tours last about two hours and you'll learn all about the secrets of vanilla farming; from planting the liane to processing vanilla pods and the main crops of the vanilla plants. If you then are still up for it, the tour continues in the primary forest, if we are lucky you will find endemic, indigenous and exotic species."
But before he can gather his thoughts the door makes a sound and he looks up.
One day Harry smiles at Draco over the cup of tea in his hands. And that is when it clicks.
Proudfoot lets me know that he has been called, but not because of an attack on my mother. She seems to have collapsed right in the middle of the street and has been brought straight to St Mungo's.
“Yes Sirius. I think I lost faith in the system for a while. And now they are pushing me towards joining the Auror training in March, I just don’t know...“
Malfoy swallows and hesitates but then words fall from his mouth, words that touch something inside of Harry and he wants to hate them but he can’t.
“Of course!” It doesn’t matter that he is feeling tired and would rather crawl underneath the blankets as soon as he gets home. The weekly pub night is sacrosanct and to miss it is only permitted if one has a high fever or a loved one is either dying or giving birth. Harry doesn’t want to raise the alarm Ron and Hermione would feel if he begged off. He has only been left by a man again, it isn’t as if someone died. Yes, he feels tired, but he attributes that to the sleepless nights he had in the last couple days, It will get better and a night out with his friends will hopefully bring him some needed distraction.
"Well I can't look into his head, but I reckon you must have done something right."
"Hm." Harry took a magnifying glass from the table, and inspected the surface of the wand lying in front of him. Magic of this calibre took a lot out of caster and wand, and sure enough he found tiny cracks in the polish, but they were not big enough for the wand to leak, or to sever his connection. He touched the wand with his finger softly, and shivered. The wand felt broken, feebly trying to connect with his magic, wanting to serve, but not quite knowing how to muster the strength.
"You can always try and consult with my colleague at 'Second Chances'. But from my experience, the chance for reconnection with a wand like this, are slim. He, however, works with infusions, with which I have no expertise, but he might help you. Should you require an entirely new wand, I would be happy to assist you…"
Mother is getting steadily better, more stable and it is thanks to Potter and his crups. I shouldn't feel bitter about this, but I do. Even when she is back at home, I cannot escape Potter. He keeps dropping by to entertain her. I lock myself up in the office when he is there, and Tora is with me. Curled up on my lap, her steady purring makes me feel less on edge. The dull paperwork gets done, while I sip tea and cuddle my cat. I must say I am a sorry sight.
As soon as he wakes, he knows that the potion has stopped working. No longer does he feel as if Harry is the sun beckoning him. The urge to touch and to be as close as possible, yes, even to crawl into Harry’s skin to get near him - simply evaporated. What is left is embarrassment and shame. Shame that he allowed a good person to be drawn into this scheme, that he put his own selfish desire to feel above the pain he will probably cause Harry. But even that is more than the dull feeling of before. As if an ember of the raging fire that has consumed him for the last months is still there. So he lies stock-still, waiting for the moment of Harry’s waking. He owes him the explanation - owes him the truth. Thinking about the fact that Harry will probably withdraw the easy relationship they have formed over the last few weeks, now that he has no physical desire in him any longer.
“Yes Master Draco. Mispy will be right back,” she confirms and pops away to the kitchen before he can say thank you.
Sixteen Weeks that have seen Draco Malfoy confined to a holding cell deep within the Ministry. Of course he knows that this is the normal procedure, they have rounded all of the Death Eaters up, and only those who are considered lighter offenders have been offered the courtesy of being within the Ministry. Draco's father is back in Azkaban and Draco doesn't know if he will ever see him again. He doesn't have the energy to think about his feelings on that. He tries to remain sane, by following the course of the sun within the magical cell window.
"Damn" He had cut himself on the shards, and was bleeding all over the floor.
Draco loved the library where he spent time reading, when Harry and Tibby cooked. For all of his prowess with potions, in the kitchen Draco was more of a hindrance than a help.
It doesn't say anything more, but the war is so deeply ingrained in Harry's reflexes that the wards are up, before the silver otter has dissolved. Now only a handful of people are able to enter the property, and they all have given their blood for the access. Even Hermione and Bill agreed that these protections are the strongest while still being legal. The source that they came from was relying heavily on wards itself, so he is certain he is safe.
His mouth lifts in a smile. And Andy looks at them with exasperated fondness. “Can we head back now? Teddy is still sleeping.”
Draco works hard, but he seems to like his job well enough. It is not what he would have expected for the missing Malfoy heir, but watching him move about, serving coffees, refilling the scones and muffins, as well as serving soup and sandwiches to the lunch-crowd, he seems to be at home. It takes almost six hours before there is a lull in the flow of customers, but before Draco can take a bite out of his own sandwich, the doorbell rings again and a young woman steps inside. She is very pretty with dark straight hair and Asian facial features. Draco must know her well since he greets her with a congenial:
“I feel as if I am melting, everything is warm, and…”
“Mione, why do I have a class for dancing on my timetable.”
"Hm I think Padma mentioned samosas once. Are they an Indian dish?" Harry bit carefully into the small pastry-package only to find his mouth flooded with a multitude of flavours that ripped a moan from him that was downright indecent.
“Relax, nephew. For now you can either look, or leave the room. I am not sure what Teddy has left in his nappy.”
He breathes heavily. Teddy crawls to Harry and pulls on his trouser leg. Harry picks the baby up and hides his face in the soft hair. His shoulders shake, and he obviously is trying hard to keep it together.
"Please, don't cry." Draco was helpless, when it came to crying women. "I knew it would work out."
Draco takes a deep breath, not quite sure what will come out, but finds himself unable to be angry. Instead he finds himself smiling freely, and shakes his head.
There is not much pomp in the ceremony, Hermione indicates for the both of them to grasp their hands. Draco's is cool and dry within Harry's own warm palm.
"I did bring food as I promised." Draco indicated the basket. "Picnic at the beach as planned."
He whimpers and I realize that I am almost crushing him to me. But when I try to let go a bit, his hand grabs my shirt and he pulls me back.
"I have no idea how it came to this. She was fine when she left this morning and now she is here all of a sudden. And I am helpless."
---------------
He is led into the courtroom, and pushed on the lonely chair which puts him in chains immediately. The first stirrings of panic encroach him, but he focuses on breathing. He has no idea what the actual charges are and how he can respond and defend himself, maybe there is no defence for him.
"Oh that! That is a kaffir lime plant. I love the smell and use it in several caris."
Draco snorted "I know I am not the most trusted person in the wizarding world, so I will not take the package from you without your sender's explicit permission."
"It is right there." She reached over and took the wand from his nightstand. The wand looked perfectly fine, but it felt off somehow.
“Don’t worry - I don’t even expect you will be able to ever trust me.” With that he turns away and Harry feels awful, words of apology hovering on his tongue but they won’t come, so he watches helplessly as the former Slytherin leaves.
While purchasing a ticket and getting an audio-guide he was instructed to explore as he wanted. There was no strict path given to the
"Well, of course, that is what you have me as a fitting model, no?" Harry replies.
If he looks very closely at that tumultuous mix churning inside him, there is also happiness because Harry seems to genuinely want to start over with him.
Yes, her future Mother in Law will rue the day she came up with this colour scheme. She looks at him with a calculating expression.
She seems genuinely interested and so he begins to talk.
"Yes. Have a good night, Draco." Harry stepped back and put his hands into his pockets. Draco liked that he wasn't pushing the issue and gave him time to adjust to this new situation between them.
“No, I told you – I consult all around the world, and when Pansy called me, threatening to eviscerate me if I didn’t help you, there was no question about getting to you as fast as possible. Not that that threat was needed.”
He raised his hand and angrily scrubbed the tears away, when a warm hand covered his.
“What?” Harry turned red.
“The music didn’t help?”
Waking each morning, getting up and going about the daily chores, sapped the little spirit that the survivors had.
Draco turned quiet, and Harry realised that he had encountered a barrier. "But enough about me, tell me more about the travelling that you have done."
"I will marry Harry Potter, thus standing by our betrothal bond, forged out of love." His eyes sparkle with love and I shiver at the promise that lies in his subtle touches.
Not much of a mystery when one took into consideration that the last case had caused him next to no sleep for two weeks. But he had forgotten to hand in a request to come in late, and the coffee he had acquired on his way here had ended up halfway on his shirt. So his shirt and robe were stained with coffee, his hair was a complete mess and his eyes where bloodshot. But at least he had made it to the office only 15 minutes late.
“Do you think she would talk to me?”
"Thank you girl", I whisper and wipe the leftover tears of my face. I turn towards the woman who gave me this reprieve and find her watching me, with a soft smile.
"It doesn't respond to me."
“Yes.” Draco tries to look away, but his eyes are drawn to the point where Harry’s warm hand covers his pale forearm. The golden skin a stark contrast to his own milky colour.
“Yes, I will,” Draco smiled.
Damn it! He wanted Draco to look at him as if he was something special! If that was not possible, he would like to talk to him again, like they were friends. This feeling of being held at arm's length hurt.
"What..."
Draco doesn’t even realize that tears have escaped his eyes and make their way down his cheek until Harry wipes them away with a tenderness that tightens his chest.
“Gentlemen!” Minerva had enough. “I honestly don’t really care who started this, but the fact is that something else has taken control of the weather spells that you used.”
"Do you feel better now?"
But nonetheless, Mother should be back from her shopping trip already. Calling Twilfit and Tattings doesn't bring anything new to light. So it is with a heavy heart that I call my designated Auror, to find out if disturbances on Diagon Alley have involved Narcissa Malfoy.
"It looks good Dray. No infections to see."
"Well yes, I love the two, but I picked them not only for being pets. I work with them." He says it matter-of-factly and I want to hear more.
He struggles to retain his cool, but feels that he owes her an attempt of honesty.
Phoenix is fast asleep in the sling when I walk briskly towards my workplace. Settling Phoenix into a little basket behind the counter I whip up the first batch of scones and cookies, before preparing for the morning crowd.
Potions used to be fun. Draco remembers that each lesson gave him a bone deep satisfaction. He loved the little twists and quirks that made a potion special. But now he just fakes the enthusiasm that used to be natural. He works, he keeps his head down, he smiles when he thinks it would be appropriate. He scowls where in reality he couldn't care less if Granger wins more points than he does.
"Well, crux of the matter is that Draco can only wield his wand, as long as I am around, until he accepts that…" Harry blushed beet-red and stopped.
“Are you coming?” Harry calls for him, and when he comes out of the room, the other man looks at him again with admiration. Draco can’t help but appreciate the casual style that Harry shows. Dressed in dark blue jeans and a thick cable knit jumper he exudes confidence.
He stands in his shop, with its nooks and crannies, with the elegant feel and the robes draped for a first look. His work pride demands that he will make the robes individually for each customer, given that someone will set foot into the shop. He has no illusions that people will be suspicious.
Draco smiles wryly. “Well it is not as if we have much choice, right? Maybe Andy has an idea on who would take this little tyke?” As if Teddy knows that they are talking about him, he burrows even closer. “Although I think, she will just be happy if we take him on. I mean half of the time we are taking care of him already.”
“I am sorry, I have to leave. But please know that I love you very much, and will come back as soon as possible.”
Potter is tense and there is no way that dancing with him will be easy.
"So if she would be missing, he would look for her?" A plan grows in my mind.
There sitting on the sofa he usually occupies is Harry Potter. His brain freezes entirely, and he just stands there for long moments, with this stupid cup in his hands, staring as if he has seen a ghost. He can’t bring himself to say anything, his mouth just won’t form words.
"He is okay?" Draco whispered.
Days pass into weeks and before he realises it Halloween is approaching. He doesn’t notice that Harry Potter keeps observing his every move.
He is halfway convinced to drag Harry into doing the correspondence course with him, when Andy comes up with a request that leaves Draco uneasy.
I don't like to sleep. The nightmares are too present, and thus I prefer to stay awake for as long as I can, but sooner or later I have to succumb to the needs of my body.
"Which means that you are definitely brave." Harry smiled. "And I really want to be brave with you."
"I doubt you have something that will work for me, but go ahead."
“I would like for you to visit Diagon Alley with Teddy. The Yule decorations are up and I remember being there as a child. It was so much more magical than any other time.” When he wants to protest, she continues, “Also Harry has never seen Diagon Alley all festive. I think it would be a wonderful idea for the two of you to spend time with Teddy and each other without an old witch being in the way.”
"My wand saved my life. But we lost our connection."
Hermione has been quiet throughout their exchange, but now she pitches in. "Even though it is crazy, it is your best option. I am sure they will try to get a hold of you should you leave the wards."
"I had a wonderful time," Harry says when they finally step of the dance floor, and Draco swears that a blush sits on Harry's cheeks.
“Well, you will probably think it is stupid.” Harry struggled with the words that wanted to spill from his lips.
They grin at him excited and eager, and just for a second he wonders if he was ever that young at eighteen. He feels old and tired at twenty-eight, even his movements are slower than usual, and his breathing is laboured. Maybe he should have stayed in bed for another day. But now there is nothing for it and he is determined to see the lesson through before heading back to the office to catch his breath.
She pales further and turns towards Draco. “I apologize, sir,” she bites out. The old Draco would have revelled in throwing the apology right back at her, but he finds that he is tired of making things worse, and just takes it as it is.
"I am almost done with the Pattern, tomorrow I can make the first trial pieces, not the actual fabrics, but if you want we can see how the pattern works with your body?" Draco is fully in his element and shares his excitement with Harry as soon as they have finished their dinner.
“Yes, why?”
I open the door gently, calling for Tora as if I am still searching for her and Potter answers.
“I need to ask you a very personal question, and if you do not feel comfortable to talk to me about this, I need to refer you to the clinic that you are going to immediately. Because quite honestly I cannot help you with the situation that you are in.”
Harry was about to affirm this, when he realized that Draco was only teasing. "Well coming by each night for Dinner would definitely be an option. If it means you have time for me during the day..." he realised that he was flirting a bit.
Feeling a bit better, he finally managed to open his eyes. As he had thought he found himself in a hospital room, but it was a light and airy. He looked around and found a blonde woman seated on the chair next to his bed. She watched him intently.
He returns the touches, but the biggest gift he is giving me is his complete trust. He opens himself to me and I love his sounds and reactions.
* * *
“It’s been you!”
"He asked after you." Hermione addressed him "And he is furious with you."
"No, but can you imagine growing up with my parents and then coming out as gay? With Father in Azkaban I had other problems, especially before Bill took me on as an apprentice. I do go out to have fun, but mostly in the Muggle world. They don't ask questions and think the mark is a cool tattoo." Draco's mouth twisted.
“When we started the hike, you looked around and marvelled at the scenery, but now you look as if you would like to be anywhere but here. If I have said anything to upset you...”
Draco wants to leave the room, but then again he himself wants to know what spell Harry is under and so he casts.
The fever that had raged through his body following the injury had made everything else pale in comparison.
Talking well through the afternoon about Blaise's plans for the future, well until dinner time.
“I will give you both and then you tell me what to do. The first one is to arrest the father of your child and to have him kept close to you for the duration of the preg-”
"Yes it was a pile of bloody rags, to be honest, I didn't even recognize it as robes. Otherwise, I might have made the connection earlier, that my pet was an animagus."
I am exhausted when Vicky comes in, I have been on my feet for close to six hours already and the cafe is quiet, apart from a regular student who works on one of the tables in the corner. The morning crowd has come and passed, but Lunch has been busy as well. I am just about to have my own five-minute break and a sandwich when she steps in.
"Do you mind telling me, how you ended up here?" Harry didn't want to let Draco go, although he was not sure how to keep him here for a while longer.
“No, you haven't said anything that upsets me.” He breathed deeply, catching a hint of Draco's smell, earthy and masculine.
... you know what. Fuck you! I'll buy a new wand and be done with it and your implications."
“I realised that there was no reason for you to leave Ginevra. Ronald was right, something must be afoul. I wanted to give you a chance to get back to normal before confronting me.”
“So you would have not wanted to be with me without this?” Harry whispers.
"Oh, Merlin!  I am so sorry" I grab the nearest blanket and hand it to him, of course, he is naked, I found his clothes bloodied and torn on my doorstep! "Please don't hex me for laughing!"
"You drink an abominable mix of milk and sugar with a splash of tea, at least you used to in Hogwarts." Draco said after a short thinking pause.
"Harry, if there is something I have never done, in my entire life, then that is forget about you." Draco breathes deeply. "Working with you, as my model was so hard, I tried to be professional because you are my friend. But god I wanted to touch you so badly."
“I am not a healer here as you put it, but I am the specialist healer they sent for. Yes, and I promise I will help you to my utmost ability.” He takes a deep breath, before he continues. “Harry, what do you know about a male pregnancy?”
"He is not harming me!" The chair scrapes over the floor, Harry must have stood up. "I don't know how you have found out about this, but let me assure you that I have known about the nature of my promise, the minute I made it. I might have been drunk when I kissed Draco, but the letter I received from Gringotts later was very clear. And you know what? I am glad I made the promise! What are five years of waiting for me, against a lifetime of unhappiness that you are trying to force on your son!"
"What is taking you so long?" Bill called again.
"Draco, long time no see." And this was all that he could get out, but he wanted to keep Draco's eyes on his face.
"So let me get this right. You volunteer to get bound to me, which if I remember right is equivalent to marriage in pureblood circles, and we probably have to consummate the union as well?" Harry will not admit that the thought of being intimate with Draco makes a part of his anatomy peak up in interest.
“Bed, please” He managed to get out and twisted his head in order to catch Draco’s mouth in a kiss.
I feel tired beyond belief. Ever since I got released from Azkaban, I have gone through mounds and mounds of paperwork, trying to figure out where the estate actually stands, now that all of the reparations have been paid.
Harry stares at him for a while and what he sees must convince him that he is ready.
"Yes, I tried to cast this morning and it just felt sluggish. Lots better than the last time, but it still is slow to respond to my magic." Draco frowned as he spoke. "This is strange..."
Four months have passed since Harry Potter killed the Dark Lord.
"Wow."
Later I will blame my absolute exhaustion for failing to see green eyes follow me.
She picks something of my robes. A soft grey hair.
When they met again a couple months ago, Draco was sure that they could never be more that casual acquaintances. Hogwarts still present in his mind, and his horrible behaviour towards the other man, even though years had passed. But Potter had surprised him, had insisted on putting it all behind them, and wanted to get to know him. So they have been going on dates, and Draco has to admit that he has never felt as free with his emotions as he has with Harry. Doesn't feel judged, just a warm acceptance and wish to be the best person he can be, to keep the approval shining in Harry's eyes. In his own mind he can admit that he wants to have it all with this man, and tonight he wants to show him just how much.
"That is a wonderful idea!" Harry beamed at him.
"Oui Madame?" he answered with the bit of French that he had acquired.
"Ok I got it. I'll bring something around and we can have a picnic at the beach. So see you then." And off he was.
Harry felt his eyes widen, "You know I have." He pulled Draco towards him, kissing him softly, revelling in the warmth of his mouth, feeling it reach deep into his soul. Igniting a spark that he had believed gone.
“What are you doing Andy?” he chides gently, and she musters a tired smile for him.
He was done running.
Harry felt his boxers grow tighter.
Harry Potter was a hero by definition.
She sighs, before looking straight into his eyes. "Marianna has decided that she wants to hold a formal betrothal Ball in two weeks."
“Thanks guys, I appreciate the sentiment. I love you too.”
"Are you going to keep staring at me, or are you going to touch me?" His voice is teasing, but there is something vibrating through it, that takes me a second to recognise. But when I do identify it, I hurry to kiss his insecurities away.
"You know Dray, with your talent you really should try to make a living out of it."
Harry frowned, Bill surely would have mentioned if Draco was seeing anyone, wouldn't he?
"I second his statement! He is not even guilty of the crime he himself feels guilty off!" With that statement Potter stands up and walks towards the chair that has Draco bound in chains. He looks at Draco and there is a gentleness in his eyes that Draco can't understand. But he is beyond caring, what does Potter mean that he is not guilty? The question must be clear in his eyes because Potter turns towards the Wizengamot and begins to talk.
“You are okay with the same room?”
“You are not mad at them?” Harry looks at Malfoy, half expecting fury but only encounters calm and resigned amusement.
“Draco Malfoy, it is really nice to meet you.” Harry offers his hand. Draco is thrown back to a train ride, when his own hand had been rebuffed so coldly, but he grasps the offered fingers before he can think too much about it. All he knows is that being next to Harry makes him feel warm and safe. That is all that is important right now.
"Shit, you must be cold. Wait a second I will get you some clothes."  Gathering some garments quickly, I berate myself.
So he is more than surprised, when everything changes with his morning tea shortly after Halloween.
Well, Pink is the colour she hates most, so it is the best choice to make her despair.
Now it is so much easier to talk about his issues when he has access to his feelings and is not walking through fog.
“The song? You mean to tell me that the voices inside my head are a song?”
Harry smiles hesitantly, “So you would be okay with us staying together in the cottage?”
Being an Auror was Harry's life. But it was karmic faith clearly, that Harry had no idea how to be a hero when it actually counted. When he thought about the figures that he had read about, as a child hidden under the covers, the real heroes like Achill and Hercules. They had a purpose, and special gifts. Harry was just ordinary. That had never been a problem, never until now.
The fact that he throws up, immediately after landing shows that something is wrong. Blaise vanishes the mess with quiet efficiency and hands him a glass of water.
Draco has no idea why Harry emphasises this fact but he sees the lines of worry ease in Andromeda’s face and thus doesn’t argue.
"It is obvious, that we both have very different expectations from a relationship. So I will make this easy on you." Draco stood up and made for the door.
Harry looked at Draco and nodded.
"Well, nobody cared so far," Ron shrugged, thankful for the distraction. Later there would be time for grief. "Ollivander makes new wands. But I remember Dad telling me that earlier on, wandmakers used other cores. Maybe years ago there was a market for second hand wands. Merlin knows I could have used someone knowledgeable, when the old wand was injured but not entirely broken."
"Okay." Immersed in his book Draco did not watch where he put his glass with Pumpkin juice, and it slipped of the small side table, breaking into pieces on the floor.
“Yeah.” Harry felt tears prickle in the corner of his eyes, Merlin he wasn’t a girl, but it seemed that the last encounter with Fiendfyre had shaken some of his emotional protections lose. “When you wrote about your boyfriend, I realized that I was in love with you, had been probably for a while. And well you know I am not good at dealing with emotions. So I tried to keep in touch without letting you know what this was really doing to me. And then you came back, I made a total fool out of myself the first time I saw you, and your were so bloody polite and distant all the time. But friendly to all of the others.”
those are herbs cooked as in mainland France, some veggies such as spinach. Cari is made with beef, chicken and fish, sometimes you can also make it with sausages. It is soul-food basically."
Draco grins sardonically, "Figured it out?"
“Are you going to press charges?” Headmistress McGonegall inserts into the conversation.
“Mum, you look tired. Are you not getting enough sleep?” He kisses her cheeks and feels her skin soft and parchment-like. When has she grown so old? She is not yet fifty, no age for a witch, but there are lines on her face.
He laughs lightly "Is it so hard to imagine that I am in love with you? It might sound strange but over the last years you have become so much more than my best friend. You are the most wonderful thing in my life! When I feel down I want to talk to you. When you are frustrated I want to make you smile. Draco you are my world!"
“There are two options, and I need to know which one to pursue.” Draco looks old suddenly.
"Hi, Draco. Already done with work?" Harry smiled as he looked at his boyfriend.
"If you tell me what I have to do, why not?"
Harry leans against Draco fully now, trusting him to keep him safe and a gentle hand cradles his bump.
"Are you sure that you are alright?" He smiles at me, and I choke a little at the warmth that I find directed at me.
He opened another book in front of him again to double check.  What he read about the Hawthorne and the Holly made his throat close up. To be sure he also read up on other woods and their characteristics, and the more he read, the more he understood, and he saw clearly for the first time in weeks. Tibby was right, he had been looking in the wrong places.
"Well then, we need to find you a wand that will perform the required spells. I am sure we will find one within the vaults." She rose and left the room.
“No.” She is quiet for a while, studying him, sipping at her tea before she blurts out, “You have changed.”
“How long will she have to be here?” Harry addresses the most pressing issue.
Pansy looks radiant, there is no other word for it. As she twirls with her fiance on the dance floor, all of the shades of pink that he has worked into the robe shimmer around her. She looks like a blooming peony, and the smile that she wears is more beautiful than any piece of jewellery she could have worn.
"You know when I thought about my engagement, as a young boy, I never imagined something like this." Draco looked at Harry, contemplating something.
“Just like I did not cast a spell to conjure a permanent rainstorm in Gryffindor tower!”
“Master Draco, you is having visitors. They is being adamant, you is coming to see them.”
"Yes." A simple word, but it carries so much accusation that my knees almost buckle. "My son hides behind that bond! He uses you to get out of his familial duty, and thus in turn is harming you!"
Draco smiles and takes Teddy out of the sling. Squirming he indicates the desire to be put down. Harry shakes his head fondly and waves his wand, setting a ward around them to keep Teddy close. The baby happily explores the floor of the cafe, and Draco is grateful for the seclusion because Teddy has grown restless and he anticipated a temper tantrum.
"Now he only has the cat to give him comfort." She looks at me with such sad eyes, "He loves Tora."
"I don't want to be forced into a physical relationship. Sex with you is not something I want to have on the terms of some old ritual." Looking at Harry was hard, but what he saw in the green eyes was not amusement.
"Wow!" Harry looks at the robe in front of him with admiration. "This is beautiful."
Harry looks at him thoughtfully, and Draco begins to squirm under the intensity of the green eyes.
Harry realised, with a sick feeling, that Ron had lost his brother.
“I am afraid, you will have to talk your differences out.” Filius shrugged. “I believe that once you put your minds to it, you can work remarkably well together. After all, you managed to accommodate all of the students in the Room of Requirements, without anybody getting hurt. You faced up to your problems even though you both could have gotten in trouble.”
"And how does he treat you otherwise?" Hermione enquired, throwing a look at her husband.
"So many wands without owners," Ron whispered. He was subdued, looking off into the distance.
“Just let me research it a bit more, and I will come up with the perfect potion. Draco is not the only one who likes the subtle art.”
“Aurors are following protocol, there are tons of rules and bureaucracy to be filled. If you want to make a career out of being an Auror you will spent eighty percent of the time pushing paper and trying to find a logical connection between seemingly unconnected pieces. Then ten percent planning the raids and only about ten percent actually rushing in wands drawn.” Draco observes Harry closely as he states this and the rapid paleness in the other boy's face tells him all that he needs to know. “With your track record I reckon they would try to make a weapon out of you, a Hit Wizard probably. Do you want that?”
"I admit, I was still working my courage up to that. But the Wizengamot kinda forced my hand." Draco looks a little unsure "But the reaction to the bonding spell, gives me hope:"
"I want you just as much. And you once told me that courage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to acknowledge the fear and working through it." Draco was trembling in his arms and he hid his face in Harry's neck. "This thing with you, is the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced, and given our history that means a lot. But I will be damned if I let you run away again."
If only he knew how right that statement is. But I raise my glass and drink with him.
Something must have shown on his face because Potter, backtracks: "Sorry, that was unprofessional, Mr Malfoy."
"The second crime is the complicity in the murder of Albus Dumbledore."
He is exhausted, embarrassed, but as he tries to extricate himself from Draco to flee into the safety of Gryffindor Tower, Draco just tightens his arms subtly.
And for the first time ever since Draco left, Harry feels entirely whole and unquestionably happy in his own skin.
"So." Harry echoes the statement. Looking at the man who sits next to him, long legs, sharp chin and those grey eyes look at him with undeniable warmth.
Draco closes his eyes, how can he say that he wilfully helped, when he only tried to protect his mother, when he had had no idea what kind of creatures would have been brought.
"Draco Abraxas Malfoy, you stand on trial for several crimes today!" the Wizard sitting on the throne in the middle of the hall bangs his gavel on the podest.
It seems that he has another letter to write. One that is so much harder than the one he has send out during the last few weeks
"So you said you lost the connection to your wand, before I can touch it you need to put it down on the counter, I never take a wand from a client. As you know they can be fickle."
"I do believe you know him?" Robarts quipped and sent a knowing grin Harry's way.
"Are you still mad about the things that happened in school?" She asks softly and I cannot keep a sardonic smile from my face.
"Don't you think, you should tell him that?" Her hand covered his, and the soft understanding in her eyes made his throat close up.
“Tell me a bit about you, what have you done with yourself in the last few months? How long has Narcissa been on the continent?”
If she only knew what I know, but I still need to wrap my head around things. But I cannot tell her this right now, so I try to appease her.
He has a tea invitation with his aunt. The music box on his desk hums softly as if approving.
So why was it so hard to tell Harry upfront what he disliked about the situation? Draco looked into the bathroom mirror and saw his wild eyes.
Harry mumbles something that sounds suspiciously akin to, “Shame, that.”
"So within the last five years or so, you have never wondered why you never had a relationship with someone of your own inclination?" Father sounds honestly concerned and I snort. What a load of cods-wallop!
Tora butts my face again and curls up next to me. When I drift back to sleep there are no dreams for once, and I am grateful for the soothing purrs that keep me anchored. If only humans where as reliable as cats.
"Someone dropped him on the doorsteps, looks like he has quite a lot of cuts, the fur was matted with blood, maybe a broken bone, but I am not sure. I couldn't leave him out to freeze!"
"I don't get it Mione. I am just doing my job. He is nice to any other Auror who takes on the more dangerous cases, but I get my head bitten of." He took a sip of his pint.
“Thank you,” he thanks her and she beams at him. He pours the tea for Pansy and hands her the cup, only to find her staring at him thoughtfully.
"What happened?" he croaked out.
"After three years of running I came here, and I was so tired." Draco leaned back into the warm sand "I think deep down I knew that moving even once more would break me. I ended up stumbling into Maman's restaurant, she took one look at me and gave me a bowl of Cari and just said
"That is not true!" He protested, only to be pinned under the furious stare of his boyfriend.
“Can I be the judge of that?” Draco pulled the blanket out. “We might as well take the break here.”
“Won’t you come inside? It must be dreadfully cold.” The voice is warm and melodious, and he hears his mother in her tones. Turning towards her, preparing for the inevitable frown as she realises just how much he looks like his father, he is not prepared for a warm smile and a welcoming hand reaching out for him.
“You don’t want to be an Auror, well then don’t become an Auror.” Draco just shakes his head. “But I would prefer to have this conversation somewhere more private. Teddy is tired and should be put down for a nap. Let’s head back and then we can talk over a cup of tea.
Seeing Harry act this way amused Draco.
The next morning found him well rested. He loved the room that had been given to him, even though the Hotel Alize Plage only had two stars it was comfortable and clean. And it was situated directly on the beach so that he heard the waves crash onto the shore. He stretched luxuriously on the massive bed, and enjoyed the feel of soft linen against his skin. The room has no glass window, the outside was covered with shutters made from wood, to keep out the birds, but it made the room airy and fresh. Ever since he had started his travels he loved sleeping in fresh air. Even though the time in the forest of Dean had been hard, the feeling of fresh air was something he craved ever since. Sometimes he wondered if it was an extreme reaction to the time that he had spend locked in the cupboard. He needed that illusion of space.
"Do you really want the whole story or just the short one?" he asks after a short while.
“They have a spot for you, and I will make sure that you are actually going there, instead of heading home and trying to sit this out, as you were no doubt trying to do.”
“Well that settles it, you are real.” Draco gets up after having the breath hugged out of him.
They got to know each other all over again.
“Yes he is.” She smiles, but there is grief underlying the brave smile and he wishes that he had been born to a family where hugs were normal, but all he can get out is, “I am so sorry.”
"All in favour of declaring Draco Malfoy not guilty raise their hands!" All remaining hands rise and Draco feels a big lump settling in his throat. He swallows desperately, but no words come.
Draco loses what little colour he had, and stands abruptly. “I understand. Well, I’ll take my leave for today.” He doesn’t give her the chance to say anything more, and Apparates away before he can cause even more of a disruption for his aunt. He sequesters himself into the library fully intending to work for the next few hours, but is interrupted almost immediately by Mipsy.
“No.” Harry forces it out, breathes deeply and continues on. “Because I started to realise by then, that I liked Ginny and Cho because they both were extremely androgynous and tomboyish. I couldn’t process it at the time, but after the war ended and I spent the summer at Grimmauld place, I realised that I didn’t love her. Not like I should. I can’t be the strong one that takes care of everything and protects her.
“Well I think you have to use a Slytherin approach to get him to talk to you. He needs to know that you are not going anywhere and that you are willing to work with him through all of this. The Sorting Hat is barmy, but the selection of dance partners was spot on for all of us.”
But when Harry stepped through the door and smiled hesitantly at him, Draco couldn't help but smile back. He felt warmth and affection towards this man. Harry just got him, and of course he was pleasing to the eye.
“I wouldn’t hex you.” Harry swallows around the lump in his throat. “Sure, you just fucked off and left all of us behind, but it was your life and you clearly didn’t want us in it.” And there it is again, the sharp pain of being abandoned that he has tried to hide away for ten years. But he can’t deal with that at the moment, he needs to find out what is going on and why he needs help.
“What?” The exclamation comes from his best friend “But I thought I would dance with Hermione!”
Much later over breakfast, Harry tried to introduce the idea to Draco who sipped his coffee.
“Yes.” Just that little word and he has me choking up. “If you want me I am yours. I think somehow I’ve always been yours, even when you drove me nuts because you were an ignorant spoiled child. “
"I am late!" Harry skidded through the office doors, completely out of breath and very aware that his appearance was not becoming of the youngest Senior Auror in the Department. He had overslept.
-----------------------
"Yeah well, you don't have a travel restriction on you, and my access to the Malfoy Vaults has been blocked entirely until my father has been kissed." Draco doesn't know why it is so easy to be open.
He was sure he could get off on simply kissing Draco, on drinking his tastes and hearing the soft sounds that he made. Draco divested him of his clothes with nimble hands, and Harry could only try to keep up with him. He touched every inch of skin that he could reach, and kissed the salt of his body. Draco laid down next to him and touched him with just the right amount of self confidence.
“Oh Draco.” She looks at his face, registering the anguish in his eyes and simply drops the baby onto his lap, pulling him into a hug. “It wasn’t your fault! My daughter and husband knew what risks they were taking, and you are so brave in owing up to your mistakes. I am very glad that you are here, and I would love to get to know you better. I hope you won’t deny us this chance? I meant what I wrote. I have lost so much of my family, I would be a fool not to take you in.”
On the next day, Draco finds another cup of tea and a candy cane along with another note.
“No, I am alone.” And that sums the entire problem up, quite neatly.
Teddy blinked at him with the familiar green eyes, that made his stomach clench and long for something that would never be true.
“Oh.” She seems surprised at his statement, as if she expected him to defend himself. They sit in silence for a while, but when it becomes too oppressive she suddenly asks.
"We just convinced her to go home and take a nap. She'd been here for two days." Fleur smiled at him and her eyes shimmered. "Oh Draco, we were so worried. You nearly burned yourself out. I should scold you for scaring us so, but you saved Bill's life."
“I didn’t know anything about it. Hell, I didn’t even believe men could get pregnant, and if I had known I would have been more careful”
"You are not ordinary, as you well know. But I can imagine that trying to date is difficult for you." There was a warmth in Draco's eyes that made Harry's stomach flutter.
The island was full of promises and he enjoyed the scenery that rushed away outside. The colour of green and blue dominated and he felt the tightness in his shoulders ease a bit. Maybe here it would be different.
I flinch when she begins to shave the poor little guy, in his place I would be so embarrassed, but then again he is probably in pain and could care less about his appearance.
He does a good half hour later and two medi-wizards accompany him. They don’t look at him, instead talking in hushed tones about “heart rate accelerated, blood pressure too high and magical exhaustion.”
He stumbled a little over the words and she switched to English - having mercy on him.
"Tu cherches un restaurant?" She cocked her head and grinned at him.
Draco grinned, and Harry took the familiar face in. Gone was the starved and haunted look, that Harry had seen on Draco's face following the battle. He had filled out, his prominent cheekbones and sharp jaw line gave him a chiselled look and his grey eyes sparkled with mirth, instead of cruel humour.
"So you can understand me."
"Not quite, but Lucien is the French form. And somehow it just fit."
Teddy had grown attached to the sound quickly and by now refuses to go to sleep when the box doesn’t play. Which, to add to its oddities, it only does when Draco is around. They made that discovery after a week.
“I just said, that I will leave England to travel for a while and would very much like it if you come with me.” She looks at him expectantly, as if there is not even a question that he will agree wholeheartedly. But Draco feels himself freeze, he can’t say why but he knows two things, deep within his soul and with astonishing clarity.
“I never said I wanted to be an Auror!” Harry states firmly. “It would not make me happy.”
“What was that for?”
“What do you mean, the magical contract won’t take?” Lucius was furious, pacing the length of the office. “I brought everything you required of me - Hair, blood and semen. You should have everything that you need to finalize the ritual without my son being present!”
She is ancient, has seen more than a few struggles within her walls, but all of them resolved themselves over the course of times. But throughout the last few years, the tension has grown, malicious feelings festering like a wound not properly cleaned.
"Yes." Draco didn't want to go further into the details. "My wand got a bit hot, but it still felt connected to me. Only when I came to in St Mungo's and tried to cast a small
"I can't" and I turn away. The soft ‘snick’ of the door is unbearably loud in my ears. Walking through the halls of St Mungo's I feel as if I am back in the damp halls of the prison, but it is only when I recall the way that mother smiled at Potter in a way that she hasn't smiled at me in a long time, I realizes that my cheeks are wet.
Harry strokes his hair, as if to soothe him the way he would soothe Teddy when he has had a nightmare.
There is a flush of pink on Harry's cheeks and I can see quite clearly how far the blush reaches on his torso.
---------------
"What?" I know it was a preliminary marriage bond, but nobody said anything about being in love.
"Look, just spill it. You know you'll feel better."
“Oh my god! Are you really here, or am I hallucinating?” He wants to step up and hug his friend, but his painful hesitation must show on his face, because Blaise steps up to him and hugs him before he can convince himself that he is just imagining this.
"Thank you." Harry grinned easily "Want me to take the little tyke for the side-along? And you do know where to Apparate to?"
“You are aware that she thinks that we are fucking?” He states it bluntly, when the server has disappeared to gather their order.
"Monsieur!"
"What are you going to call him?" Vicky addresses me, covering a yawn.
“Mipsy?” Calling her for tea, he smiles at his house-elf. “Can you bring us tea please?”
"Cari is Mamans go to food. It is a sort of stew made with tomatoes, onions, turmeric and "safran péi" - ginger... coating the meat or fish. That depends on what you put into it. A cari worthy of this name is always served with rice, grains such as lentils,
“Mr Potter, I assure you this course has nothing to do with wanting to humiliate you!” She indicates to the chair
"Phoenix"  Even though he is entirely black as far as I can see, this little guy will have to rise like a phoenix from the ashes.
“More!” Draco wonders, how his voice can sound so clear, when he feels so utterly vulnerable at the moment. Harry carefully introduces another finger and continues to stretch him out.
I think about all of the people that have died during the last few months, and I wonder if I'll ever be comfortable with the feelings of guilt and tiredness that I carry with me every waking moment.
“I just want you in my bed.” Harry kisses him again. “I don't care if I am the one on my back. I know my dick is a lot to take.” It doesn't even sound like bragging, it just is a fact.
"Is it this bad, being promised to me? God, I hope you wake up soon."
"Well mate, you don't talk to him either. And what is there to talk about, unless you pull your head out of your arse and ask him out for a drink, otherwise there is not much for it! He is our department secretary, tell him you need office supplies, book a room for an undercover mission, the likes!"
“Merlin Harry! Can you eat even more obscenely?” Draco admonished him, but there was a definite hitch in his voice.
The last sentence made the hairs on his neck stand up, but he pushed the feeling aside. He focused on the other characteristics of the wood, but nothing really spoke to him.
?" Draco clarified.
He is drawn to her like a moth to flame and follows her inside. The cottage is filled with midwinter light and he takes in the warm sitting room with a fireplace and sofa covered entirely in throw rugs. The bookshelves are filled to overflowing and he sees a lovely back garden hidden behind french doors, with a chair perfect for curling up with a book and forgetting the time.
"No." Harry hated how small his voice sounded. "He is more to me than a quick fuck. Just kissing him, feels so different…"
Draco feels all but invisible, but if he is honest this does suits him. Harry accompanies the stretcher out and Draco watches as he stands there looking lost, for a long time. He calls him back in and makes a hot chocolate for the two of them, all the while holding onto Teddy as if he were a lifeline.
Andromeda stood in the parlour with a screaming Teddy in her arms. Her hair was frizzed and she was pacing with him trying to calm him down.
"YES!" Teddy all but bounced off Draco's hip.
"Yeah well, takes one to know one. Take care Draco, and don't work too hard!" she moves towards him, slowly to give him a chance to move away but he bunts his head against her hand and allows Mungo's petting.
Despite the blatant warning in her missive, he feels a lump in his throat at the chance she is offering him. He immediately sends a confirmation back with her owl.
"Yes, but he is declining. He is saying he is wanting to speak with you, and that it will not be taking long." Tilly bowed and Draco took off at a sprint.
"I don't like the Draco Malfoy that I knew in school." Potter's tone is congenial. "But I don't really know you, and I would like to change that. I have a feeling you and I have far more in common than we both thought possible. And a man who loves his cat so much cannot be a bad guy."
"I am sure it is not that bad." Harry did not want to feel bad for the man, but the overall impression Draco gave off was one of defeat. And that was something he had hoped to never see again.
“But Teddy wants to play outside.” Harry sounded baffled, as if it had never occurred to him not to indulge Teddy’s reasonable wishes. .
"So, to get this right, my wand chose you as the person best suited for me? And you now somehow managed to seal this promise with your blood? But you bled all over my wand when you fought Voldemort and nothing happened then." Draco paced the room. "Are you telling me that the legend of the sacred pair is not a legend?"
Bill sighed: "Go home Draco, get your thoughts sorted."
Heart racing, and his entire being tingling from head to toe, Draco conceded that yes, there was something magical about autumn.
"If Master Draco is being thinking so." Tibby said reverently.
“Have you been the receiving party in your relations with your partner, and did you forego protective measures?”
He is a walking affront to the survivors of the war. But he can’t bring himself to care about anything. So he walks through day after day, week after week in the fog that keeps him isolated from the rest of the world.
“He is not worth the dirt under your shoes!” Pansy would bang her fist on the table if it were becoming of a lady. Instead she grips her wineglass so tightly that Harry fears it breaking.
“You are right, Harry. Most of us learn familial love through blood relation, but when they don’t treat you right, when they hurt you from the beginning, then it is hard. I am so sorry that the people who should have loved you and protected you, couldn’t give you that. For me loving my father... when he hurt me so deeply during my teenage years, was in sharp contrast to the man he was when I was a small child. Until today my feelings for my father are very conflicted. But the bond we have is not broken. I dare say you never developed a familial bond until you met Sirius.”
He has hit a mark, he can see it in the way that the other boy hunches into himself.
I nod and smile at her." She is wonderful. You wouldn't believe what I have seen during the last few months." It feels right to tell and I feel good when I tell her, "My name is Harry."
"Ok spill, what has both of you in such a state?" He cannot sit quietly until they will start talking on their own.
"You must have done something right..."
"Look, Mr Malfoy I am not the kind of person to push someone to do something that might break their family either. When I love, I love fully and then I can be very patient. Even though patience is not my strongest suit otherwise." He chuckles.
"Forever bossed about by my house-elf," Harry chuckled softly, starting to read on the page that Tibby had so gently suggested. The more he read, the more he realised that he was in deep trouble.
“So there is no way to keep this baby alive?” Harry feels tears threatening to spill, and he covers the subtle bump with his hand. He probably shouldn't feel so emotional but the idea of losing this miracle growing inside of him, a chance at a child that will be loved and love him in return...and if he is honest probably the hormones wrecking havoc on his system, make his eyes water.
"Excuse me?" I stare at her. I really don't know why she is so irritated with me. I have taken her advice in the hospital, told her I was sorry for the way I treated her in school and made a big donation to her department. Tora screeches at her and I bend down automatically to pick her up.
“You are not making any sense, Draco! But if it makes you feel better, go ahead cast the diagnostic spell and see for yourself that I am not under any spell.” Harry steps up to him, forces Draco to look directly at him. “Go on, cast the spell and then we can talk.”
“No, let me finish. I left because I wanted to figure out how to make up for the horrible mistakes that I had made in my teenage years, and where my passion for potions and research would do good instead of causing pain. But I also knew that I would never leave, if you asked me to stay. I could not risk that. It was easier to leave and not look back, until I was sure that the person that I saw in the mirror each morning was worthy of your friendship.”
Draco smiled at Bill, before promptly fainting.
I am alone, caught in the fire and I know that no matter how long or loud I scream for him to save me he won't come back, won't rescue me. I swallow smoke fading from consciousness but then I awake in the damp cell of Azkaban. Alone again, why would I matter to anybody? And the fear, to be forgotten settles into my bones, clinging like tar to me.
"Yes, of course, Mrs Malfoy." Harry nodded.
"She is beautiful." The voice is so unexpected that Draco himself almost loses his composure.
Wiping sweat of his face he put the gloves on and picked the wand out of the solution. But before he could dry the wand off and apply the polish, the doorbell rang.
"Draco No!" He couldn't just leave him like this.
It had been one of their first big rows, because the child in Harry had wanted to spoil the little boy rotten at every chance that he got. But Draco had reminded him that children needed guidance and love more than money and possessions, and that he himself had had everything materially that he needed. There had been a haunted look in Draco’s eyes, and Harry had given in. So while Teddy knew without a doubt that he was loved deeply by both of them, he also knew the meaning of the word no, as rarely as he heard it from both of them.
"We also have a bond that could only be made, if we were in love."
"Well of course the entire thing would have been a lavish affair, with my mother planning the party, starting as soon as the signatures were under the betrothal contracts. She would have had the guest list assembled already, and I would have to nod like the dutiful son that I am. My fiancé and I would maybe squabble about the precise shade of ecru for the invitations, and sneak away to get to know each other at least somewhat, without the chaperones that our families would set up. Food and clothes and ceremony would be decided with a combination of old pureblood customs."
"Shit, you must be cold. Wait a second I will get you some clothes." Draco jumps up and runs out of the room.
Harry mouths his erection through the fabric for a bit, before pulling the black pants down over Draco's hips and his cock springs free. He knows he must be quite a sight, but looking at Harry would probably push him over the edge and he wants to last a while longer. That thought flies out of the window when he feels a hot mouth close around his dick, and he arches of the bed with a shout. Only to find himself pinned to the mattress, by firm hands.
"What?" now he is even more confused, "What are you talking about, Malfoy?" And isn't it ironic that Draco is one of the few people that he trusts enough to let him into his home when it is shut tightly against the world?
"And why not?" Defiance blinks up in the clear grey eyes. "Am I not good enough for you? Do you have so many others available?"
He turns towards the intruder and looks into Andy’s face. The line between her brows tells him that she is baffled by his behaviour.
“You made yourself clear and I think I made myself as clear.” Draco turned away from the two of them, Harry stepped outside his heart heavy. That had not gone as planned, but for now he had an excited five year old to occupy.
"Apart from the fact that you did it under duress, did you have fun, doing it?"
He laughed. "Je suis anglais:"
"Love it." Draco settled at the table and they both tucked in with gusto.
"If you don't mind, then yes it would be great to have you here. Tomorrow then?"
"You want to see
“Yes, get on with it” He quips. Harry conjures the lube wandlessly and Draco notices that is smells softly of almonds. But before he can comment on it Harry commands his attention by finally getting to it. He circles his hole, pressing gently against his opening and Draco forces himself to relax. It will not do to make Harry aware, that this is not only the first time with him, but the first time he has ever done this, lest he decides to be too noble and stop doing this.
“Right.” Draco looks up and there is something lurking in Harry’s eyes that he can’t identify. If he is honest with himself he doesn’t want to either. His breath catches in his throat, and he has to look away. It would be wishful thinking that Harry has any interest in him, so he should be happy with this comfortable almost friendship they have managed to build.
“Hello to you too, Malfoy.” He moves his eyebrow. “Are you going to enlighten me?”
He is brooding like that for the next day, until Mipsy pops up suddenly.
* * *
“But what about your work? What about my work?” Harry feels as if the air has been squeezed from his lungs.
“Yes.”
“Ron told me that Harry is not used to touch.”
“No.” Harry sounds absolutely horrified.
A quiet hiccuping child.
"You don't like the submission part? Is that it? You don't like bottoming?"
“No Harry, I was asking about contraception charms.”
I am a little baffled though, as I thought to have felt a broken hind leg, but I am glad to have erred. She works quickly and efficiently, and soon he is all patched up and wrapped in bandages. Only his head has gotten away from the shaving.
“So if I were to ask you out for dinner, you wouldn’t bite my head of?”
"Oh, just wonderful, as if my life is not fucked up enough at the moment. What do you have for me? More books to read, just great."
"Right, but still, you know you don't have to put up with this."
The only time, that Draco wishes for someone to see him is when the Holidays draw near and even the Ministry is infused with warmth and laughter. Then he secretly longs for someone to be there for him as well, to share laughter and secrets with…
"That he is yours, to cherish and protect." Bill guessed.
“He should be in Azkaban,” she fumes, quietly, coldly, all the more terrifying for the intensity of her anger. “Why can he walk the halls of Hogwarts, when others so much more deserving of being here are dead!”
"We arrested Yaxley, a year ago, and under Veritaserum, he confessed that he wanted access to the Malfoy fortune. So he killed Theodore Nott, made it look like a case of retribution against former Deatheaters in order to convince you that you had to disappear. He also confessed that he had intercepted all owls to you from your mother."
"Good day to you too, Mr Malfoy." He tried to save himself by resorting to painful politeness.
"I like your Mum. She seems really nice," Harry said, and Draco could only nod.
Prepared for the outing Draco stands with Teddy strapped to his chest and waits for Harry.
“I am not joking, wish it that I were,” she sighs, and drags her hand through her hair. A gesture that reminds him of Draco so much that it physically hurts.
He seemed to shrink into himself, and she continued to talk fast. “But I understand that I might have expected too much from all of you. I had hoped that this year would give all of you the chance to heal, instead, I left you too much to your own devices. You wanted to make life lighter by pranking each other?”
Pansy is my best friend, but sometimes she just doesn't get it.
Until one day his hand brushes against Draco’s back.
"Scared, yes."
It was silent for a while and he almost thought that Draco had changed his mind, but then his voice carried through the room and Harry was stunned into silence
Draco didn't reply with words. His hand covered Harry's cheek and he slanted his lips over Harry's . At first it was just a gentle meeting of mouths, but soon desire took over, and Harry found his courage again. His arms closed around the man hovering over of him and he pulled him as close as he could. Draco went down on the bed without resistance and Harry let out a little "uff". Out of breath, he looked at the man in his arms, the wideblown pupils, the red lips and he knew the he would never let go. Unless Draco asked him to.
The strong arm that pulled him against the warmth of Draco's body warmed Harry through and through and he drifted of to sleep secure in the knowledge of being loved.
Potter surprised him with a soft smile "Well, I think you still struggle sometimes with the way you have been raised, and the things you have learned after the war. It would conflict anybody. But that is not the reason why I think Hawthorn wood suits you." He looked at him as if he wanted Draco to ask, and so he indulged him.
They take their positions on the opposite sides of the dancefloor and the first strains of music begin to play.
"You know, Draco you make the best coffee in the neighbourhood."
He continued to walk on, thinking back to his time with Harry, and Ginny's insistence that Harry had not always been this difficult.
“Please.” He is almost incoherent, he only knows that he needs more, more of this scent and taste, glorious warmth and fire that is Harry in bed with him.
which was the last of the original tropical forest that had covered La Reunion. Harry tuned the explanation out after a while and simply soaked up the gentle chatter of Draco's voice. When he pulled into the parking lot, he smiled,
“You’ll make your wife very happy one day.” Draco says it just to remind himself that Harry is off limits and that he should not entertain some silly notion of playing house with Harry Potter and a baby. Even though the thought makes his insides squirm with something akin to happiness and desire.
Potter snorts at that, but Draco just plows on focusing on Andy.
Maybe he is becoming too transparent for Harry.
“Of course headmistress,” Draco Malfoy addressed her, but the dull tone of his voice forced a shudder from her.
Come midnight, I am picking the basket up and settle it into the bedroom. I am sure Phoenix will be fine tonight in the basket, but he has other ideas. When I settle into bed, under the covers, I hear a plaintive meow, and it doesn't stop, in fact, it sounds like a cry for attention.
“No, tea is perfectly fine!” He stands there not knowing what to do with himself, well aware of the strange figure he must make in the cozy cottage, dressed in his finest robes. He wishes he could tug on the collar but that would be so undignified.
"That you have" Harry stares ahead, he thinks on the countless occasions when Draco has shown up with a beer or for a cuppa. How he kept telling him, that there would be someone out there for him, someone who would get and deserve him and he releases a startled breath when the puzzle pieces click.
"Ah," Maman Valerie kept looking between them and threw a barrage of French words at Draco, to which he answered gently and with obvious humour.
"Why not? You two are clearly head over heels for each other."
“I think, we need to head back inside. What do you say Teddy?” Harry picked him up and swung him about.
That at least was how it felt like for Harry.
One by one the portraits of our ancestors come to life and speak their verdicts. They are of one opinion. “Lucius Malfoy, shall step down.” As the last one has given their judgement they begin to chant.
He is out of the room before she can lecture him further and storms towards the Gargoyle.
So when the day of the picnic with his best friend came around and their lovely afternoon was interrupted rudely by a hailstorm, he didn’t think too much of it. The weather had been erratic for the last two weeks anyhow. Draco and Blaise sprinted back to the house and had laughed it off, once they were dried off and enjoyed a cup of tea together.
"Not quite- they would give you the option to give up magic entirely. If you declined that,
“When I got here, I had a very serious anger issue. I felt constantly on edge, as if I would erupt into a tirade and yell at everyone around me. But I knew that that would not help me, deal with the underlying problem. So while you feel like the
"She deserves it!" Harry laughs as well and there is mischief in his eyes.
"Then why are you still here?" talking through the lump in his throat was hard, but Harry knew instinctively that he needed to hear what Draco had to say.
"Thank you. I'll wait with dinner until Mother is back."
Harry smiled softly at him. "What if it is not the core at all that is the problem? Tell me again what it feels like, when you try to wield magic with your wand?"
Harry took his hand away. "I am sorry if I misinterpreted this."
"Yeah, which big brother is happy, when you break their little sisters heart?" Harry chuckled, taking a sip of his beer.
"I'll get you back in shape, Phoenix."
“So, you didn't live in England? For the last ten years?”
“Don’t get used to it. I do try to be cultivated, but I am angry at the world that did this to us. I mean I deserve the shame and the guilt, I was on the wrong side after all, but you, you should be happy and free and…”
THE END
Draco stared a little bit at the spot where Harry had just stood, but quickly Apparated after the two.
"Yes, I did." Harry couldn't help but grin. "It has been sitting in the healing solution with centaur tail hair for the last hour."
“It worked.” Draco looks at Blaise. “Just not as you were expecting. While you all thought that I was ok, I was not.” He swallows. ''I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for most of the last two years.”
"I guess my robes were beyond salvaging?" He smiles at Draco to indicate that he is only jesting.
“So, here you are.” She looks at him for what feels like an eternity, but Draco has no idea what she is thinking.
The sheer amount of potion flasks on the table boggle his mind. Surely he doesn’t need to drink all of them now? He still stares at them in shock when the door opens again, and soft steps approach his bed.
"Oh for fucks sake!" Harry clenches his fists. "Please tell me you are not really this dense! Why do you think I am here? Because Teddy keeps looking at me as if asking what I have done so that you don't tuck him in anymore. Even if I don't mean anything to you, please come back for Teddy's sake."
“Thank you, Mipsy.” He smiles tiredly at her, appreciating the concern. It feels good to have someone care for him, even if it is his house-elf. He takes a sip of tea and laughs incredulously.
underneath the usual wards. I only caught it because I recognised the vibration of Bellatrix's magical signature."
When family consists only of his mother and her estranged sister, and all of the old friends have abandoned Draco in favour of fleeing postwar Britain to the continent.  Well, loneliness becomes his friend for a while. He wraps it around himself like an Invisibility Cloak and revels in it, just because it helps to heal, at least at the beginning.
"I haven't done enough to help him?" I sound bitter - but why is it always about me doing something for others?
"So I can hug you?" Harry is still not quite sure where they stand.
“You are offering your home to me, your magic…”
The cold wind made him shiver, cursing that he could not even cast a warming charm, he steeled his resolve to tackle the issue at hand immediately. Giving up on the wand was not an option, it was too much a part of him, too much part of his history. He would go and find the shop 'Second Chances' to get at least another opinion on the situation. Buying a new wand would feel like a betrayal, and he had had enough of that in his life.
“Add to that, that he is also being put in the position of having to follow your guidance and everybody expected him to take over the lead…” Blaise chimes in. “Salazar knows that Hermione is having trouble following my lead. I always have to explain to her why I am better suited for it - last time I had to resort to the law of Physics, why I am in the leading position. Because if I try to argue from tradition she is ripping into me.” His eyes glaze over and a fond smile plays upon his mouth.
never quite restored the original status quo just like glue. Some cracks were always visible.
"You don't look bad yourself." Draco got out, because his mental faculties had taken a short break.
Draco more than understands the feelings of the wizarding world. If he is not able to forgive himself, how can he expect others to forgive, let alone forget what he has done. Thankfully there is owl-order for most things. And others he can grow in the Greenhouses.
"Not guilty."
"It is nice not to be alone, Phoenix." For a long while no more sounds occur, other than my working and the steady purring of a content cat. I do make good progress, but I will not finish everything tonight.
* * *
“Sit down, won’t you? And please if it makes you more comfortable, take off the outer robes. I remember how choked I always felt when I had to wear the formal ones.” She sinks down on the sofa and pats the space next to her. Her smile is warm and a bit weary, as if he is a throwback to a time that she remembers with dread and fondness in equal measures.
"So, you were not looking for me?" Draco looks at him with wide grey eyes.
"You get bonded to someone of your own choice." And it's so easy that Harry can only shake his head. "Malfoy aren't you forgetting a little detail?"
"I need to leave you two now." Hermione seems reluctant to break them up, but leaving without words has never been her forte. "I will try to buy you two time."
"I'll do my best."
Potter turns towards them with blazing eyes. "Do you still believe that he willingly supported this? When he knew that his mother would endure far worse than these injuries should he not comply?"
, Harry was fascinated by the rough landscape.
Ron looks at Hermione who is white as a wall herself, but walks up resolutely, picks the hat from the Professor's hand and deposits it on her head. It takes a long while but when she emerges her look is one of contemplation. She marches over to Blaise Zabini and simply tells him - “We are partners.” Her back is ramrod straight and Blaise just looks at her before nodding.
He doesn't feel his injuries anymore, blood loss making him dizzy. Pure will has pushed him this far, but now he is at his end. His wand lost as well as the emergency port key that he should always carry. His magical reserves almost completely depleted, so that Apparition is completely out of the question. He trudges on as long as he can, but there is nothing left.
“Well, making your life miserable in school is quite something different than wanting you dead. I think my subconscious already knew by then that all our survival depended on you. Thinking about it now I hate that you had to carry that burden alone.”
“I thought you were taking the piss when you told me you would take your NEWTs next January. I thought you would come to your senses and join me in becoming an Auror, instead you are playing house with Malfoy!”
He realises that a month has passed already only when he takes a look outside and sees that the leaves have fallen and the land is touched with the first spikes of frost.
“Of course you can. You need to trust your partner, but other than that, dancing is not that different from flying or even duelling. It is action and reaction.”
Their guide served them slices of fresh mangoes and a platter of lychees, and Harry enjoyed the taste immensely.
"Bill, I daresay as a Malfoy the lifetime quota for fuckups have been more than filled. I am glad you are happy with my work, but I can't just be a normal seventeen year old, I can't goof around, or get drunk, I have to think of my family."
"Well, the guy that fixed it seems to know what he is doing." Draco quipped, leaning into the warm hand on his cheek, but he stepped back before Harry could lean in and kiss him.
"So for two days I am to use this wand and then you have my wand fixed?" Draco swished the wand that Harry had gently placed into his hand and felt a subtle rush of magic in his arm. He couldn't help but smile at Harry.
Later he would not clearly remember how long he had stared at the case, paralysed by fear. What if his wand didn't work for him any longer? Would he have to duel Potter, before the wand recognised him as its owner again? Would he ever again feel the connection to his wand?
Ever since the war ended, he is walking in a fog so dense that nothing penetrates it. Coming back to Hogwarts as a stipulation for his probation period should have terrified him, or at least make him feel remorse for the pain he inflicted on those that have been afflicted by his actions, but there is nothing.
He has gathered the black robe in front of him, the cut is not yet perfect, but it is one of his more polished pieces, and he fervently wishes that one day he will be able to see how the folds of a robe, made by himself will fall over a broad chest, will cover the wizard or witch in front of him in something beautiful that he has made.
"I have Teddy visiting me next weekend, maybe you would like to join us?"
"It will be alright." He called to Bill, struggling to reassure the distraught man. "You can stop the blood flow once the curse is done, and then they can reattach the limb."
“So it is never going to be better?” Harry swallowed, a heavy feeling in his gut.
“Knut for your thoughts?” Draco whispered into his ear, kissing the shell and tugging at his earlobe with his teeth.
“Why do I have the feeling this is no longer only about me?” Draco voices carefully.
The blood is rushing through his ears so loudly that he can’t think clearly. He just knows one thing. He needs to get away from here, before Harry hexes him. The excuse is feeble at best, but he only has one and it should be enough to buy him some time.
He just shook his head. How could he tell her, that he stayed, even though he had blown his cover, because it was more important to check for survivors in the burning building. He had pulled two men out, before the building had collapsed on top of him, he had activated his last emergency portkey at the very last moment, but had carried away burns and smoke inhalation, details that Hermione now filled him in on.
“You know, I never thought I could be truly envious of you, Draco. But I really envy you at the moment,” he finally says and Draco feels his eyebrows climbing up to his hairline.
“Nothing, Dray.” She tries to put on a strong facade and he admires and hates her for it at the same time. They are friends and she needs to hide her pain from him?
"We made shepherd's pie. I hope you like that?"
Draco cannot help it but laughs, the sentence is so Pansy, but then he remembers her tear streaked face and scowls a little again.
Time flew and Harry realized that La reunion had held him for more than a month now. Thankful that money was not an issue he simply extended his stay week by week. He felt the cold creep up inside from time to time, but spending a day with Draco made him feel comfortable again. Draco had promised him a special treat for the upcoming day and he looked forward to another beautiful hike to the
"Good, you have no idea how scared I was to find you unconscious in my shop. I have promised myself to always protect you, and I am not doing a good job so far."
It does not get better over the next few weeks. Harry hates his body for betraying him, for yearning to be close to Malfoy and his warmth, to want his touch, when he knows just how wrong it is.
“Not really. I am sure it was all about being forgiving and a good example for the younger students.” He turns towards her even more.
"I think when it comes to you, I am no hero. I want to be with you so much, it scares the living daylights out of me."
Harry felt sick as he looked at Draco’s fingers and nose. “Oh no Draco.”
Stepping into the little shop that was more of a hole in the wall, he was welcomed by a wonderful smell, he breathed deeply.
“What happens when I touch you, why are you so afraid?”
“Look Harry, this is what I wanted to show you.” He pointed at something just of the road. “No matter how bad the eruption is, someday life returns.”
“Nah, he is fine with Dean and Seamus dancing together and Theo with Clemence. He is not homophobic.”
There was a new softness in his eyes that warmed Harry deeply inside.
Draco looked and shook his head. "What are you trying to tell me? Even the tree from which your wand is made, grows bigger than mine?"
I need to gather my thoughts for a moment, but when Harry looks as if he regrets asking I tell him what happened shortly after my trial.
“I would never laugh about you.”
The raised eyebrow in his face should not look so damn fetching and I turn away.
“You said you have loved before, do you love me?”
"Well, Harry asked me how you were holding up." The casual mention of Potter's name hits him like a Bludger. He flinches a little.
"Am I? So there is nothing to the fact, that each guy that you take home has green eyes and black hair?"
“This baby is alive due to your incredible magical strength, but even your strength is running out.”
Hermione breathes in deeply before she starts talking. "I was at the Wizengamot session today, and they have decided that no wizard should be allowed to have a lot of power to themselves, without being bound to another."
Then a thought crosses his mind that makes his heart stutter.
." The shop was lit brightly and Draco frowned.
“I have no idea what I am doing, but I hope we can figure this out together.” Falling back onto the bed and pulling Harry on top of him is a start, and he hopes to show Harry what feels good to him.
"Well I never thought I would work in a hole in the wall either, and yet here I am," Draco got up and shrugged.
Draco was sentenced to six months in Azkaban, many might say it was not enough. But to me it was too much already. Looking at Draco's face I felt sicker than ever before, and thus I left. The Reporters where swarming around me once again, shouting their questions. But I ignored them and kept on walking.
"Damn!" Draco pulled his wand and cast a quick
Deep down below the surface of London, in the very bowls of Gringotts, there lies a book. Not much to look at and almost forgotten within the many vaults belonging to the Malfoy family.
I stare into my cup. If he didn't want help, what did he want then?
"I will take care of you later, don’t be insulted that you have to wait for a bit." The wand rolled a bit on the cloth as if getting comfortable and Harry grinned at that.
"Shit." It goes without saying that Pansy will not be able to purchase new dress robes within that timeframe, not to mention that no tailor in Wizarding England will serve a daughter of a former Death Eater. Her future mother in law knows this and hopes to embarrass her enough to call off the betrothal. Well not if he has anything to say about it.
Harry wore comfortable robes, open at the front. Beneath he wore a plain black T-shirt and jeans. His black frames had been replaced with silver wire frames, which made his eyes stand out even more. The overall look suited him. He looked right at home here in the Leaky, with a pint in front of him.
“You really want to talk about that right now?” Draco still has that raised eyebrow, when he is incredulous.
"I will kill the Wizengamot!" She is fuming and he does the only thing he can think of. "I'll make us a cuppa first, and then you can tell me what has you up in arms."
In time he will come to blame his immersion into the Black family and the unwelcome reminder of Aunt Bella for the nightmares that plague him that night. Flashes to the scene in the living room, when he was asked if he would babysit the cubs, and the fight with Potter losing his wand to him, losing Vince in the inferno...
“In the living room!” he hears her calling out, and follows through without thinking much about it. It is only when he steps into the room, and sees who sits with Andy that he stops abruptly, clutching the cup between his hands.
He stops in his tracks, baffled for a moment, needing to think about the socially correct response to the person he owes a life debt to. It takes him a moment longer than usual but he finally nods.
It was the cold that drove him away at first.
A simple cup of tea, steaming hot just like he likes it, with the right amount of milk and sugar, has appeared on his desk.  To add to his surprise, a bright red and white candy cane has been tucked against it. Of course Draco checks the cup thoroughly for any curses, but the only thing that he finds is a gentle pulsing warming charm. Just when he has finished casting all of the revealing and anti-jinx spells that he can think of, a note materializes.
Something is niggling at the back of his mind though. It takes a few moments until he realises that it is too quiet in the living room. When he looks at the wrecked artefact which has guided him here, which has ensured his place in this cosy haven that Andromeda's house has become, he feels part of him breaking. His insides freeze as his eyes lock on the splinters of the music box.
When he left the office the cackling sound of laughter reverberated in his ears.
"I'll see you on Saturday then? For the outing with Teddy?" His voice sounded strangely high to his own ears.
