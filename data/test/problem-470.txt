. He can't say anything at this point, it's all too surreal, and the day's events are catching up with him in a maelstrom of unexpected emotion. Suddenly, she's gathered him close, embracing him tightly with a whiff of jasmine and something herbaceous, and he finds himself hugging back equally as strong.
Harry can understand the need to let go, to cede control of his emotions, even if he doesn't experience it himself. But Malfoy's a live wire now, sparking and burning across the room. His emotions are running away with him and there's nothing he can do but hang on. He's lost control and he's scared, but he can't stop. He's got no ground, no anchor, and he's spiraling higher and higher toward an inevitable crash. Malfoy's anxiety is pulsing out of him in waves so thick Harry thinks he can reach out and pluck it from the air like a Snitch.
They were cemented together from mouth to groin, and Draco rubbed his lips across Potter’s with a precision designed to destroy. Potter’s tongue met his with equal fervor, seeking and tasting, mapping out every crevice it could reach. Draco sucked in a breath as his tongue slid along the underside of Potter’s lip, grazing across the tip of one pointed fang. Potter shuddered, and clutched at him for more, but he ended it with a hard, deliberate press of closed mouths. As he pulled back, Potter whimpered and leaned forward, chasing after Draco’s mouth.
"You're a fool," Snape spat. "A cowardly fool. You're not protecting Draco, you're protecting yourself."
He doesn't flinch at her touch, not until she reaches the tip of the sword, and even then it's only a sharp intake of breath. His skin is warm, so warm, and her finger slides easily, aided by the thin coating of clean sweat.
He sniffed at the insult. “Of course. She asked for privacy, and I gave it to her. I didn’t go out of my way to listen. That would be rude, Potter.”
Potter sucked and thrust, and sucked and thrust, beginning a dangerous rhythm that had his heart scrambling to match its cadence. Each pull of Potter’s mouth on his skin was like an undertow, dragging him out to sea, and all Draco could do was throw his hands up and let it take him. The vampire moaned, deep and low in his throat, the sound more a growl of possession than of pleasure. The answering hardness from Potter’s pajamas was undeniable proof that Draco wasn’t the only one drowning on this sinking ship.
Ron looks flummoxed across the table, spluttering an incoherent protest. After a moment of Harry and his wife both glaring at him, he manages to find his words. "So what will you do now?"
Harry watches him turn and walk away. Gone is the defeated slump Harry's been accustomed to seeing on Draco's shoulders. Just as he's about to cross the threshold, Harry calls after him, "I'll be waiting. Don't be late."
The remainder of the day is spent sketching and researching, until his fingers are nearly black with charcoal. He misses the formal lunch, but Blinky (sweet Blinky) brings him a sandwich and watches him with narrowed eyes to make sure he eats.
Draco closed the gap between them, noting Potter's subtle intake of breath. "And what do you want? I mean, you've made all sorts of concessions for me and my future, but what about yours?"
Draco doesn't open his eyes, but breathes out shakily through his mouth. His voice is rough, but this time it's the right kind of broken.
There's a definite pause in the air, but the spell is broken as he tugs on his gloves and grins. "I should get to work. See what's really at the root of the problem."
His fingers curled into the hem of his t-shirt as he balled it up, shoved it into his mouth, and screamed.
Silvestri smiled with the self-importance of a man with the upper hand. “And how far do you think you’ll get with the Ministry’s chains wrapped around your neck?”
Draco is dressed impeccably in a crisp, emerald green button-down and black bespoke trousers. No fraying hems to be seen. It makes him wonder about the trousers from before. Draco has money, there's no denying that fact, so it's a curious thing for him to be lounging about in clothes long past their prime. If he knows Draco, and Harry's beginning to think he really does, he's certain there's some sort of self-flagellation involved. Draco is a martyr to his guilt. Blaise Zabini is the glaring proof.
It's as if everything just falls away in the wake of the calm that thrums through his body. The crowd, the light, the noise—everything—dissipates, and Harry glides forward like a shark seamlessly cutting its way through the ocean. The bodies part for him as he walks, because nothing can stand in his way.
Potter opened his mouth to retort, but closed it, running a hand over his face. “Sure. Whatever. When Kreacher’s done, your room is up the stairs, last door on the left. Mine is across the hall, but there’s a shared ensuite bath between us. Feel free to take a shower. There’s clean towels in the bathroom cupboard, and there’s probably something suitable for sleeping in your dresser.” He started up the stairs. “We’ll sort out everything tomorrow.” Potter stumbled and grabbed for the rail. “Goodnight, Malfoy.”
, of all things, his heart slams in his chest. Because that tiny gesture, so fleeting and imperceptible, makes Harry want like he hasn't wanted in months.
Green light flashed from within the void where Silvestri's mortal heart used to beat, and Potter rolled off to the side, leaving Silvestri staked to the forest floor. Within seconds, his screaming abated, and the corpse seized and turned to ash. Potter grabbed Draco's wand and tucked it in his back pocket, making his way over to Draco without preamble. As he approached, he waved his hand, and the ball of foliage and thorns around him dissipated.
His eyes traveled from her hands to her throat, where no doubt her pulse was fluttering madly. She could feel the pounding in her heart all the way to her toes. Harry’s nostrils flared and he snorted.
With that, he leaves the pub and heads out onto the street, and slips into his coat. He's only got one arm in before the sound of reporters barrels down on him. A crowd of them are at the end of block, running toward him, shouting.
Four hours later, Draco's hands were numb and his back and shoulders were on fire. Yet every single cauldron had been scrubbed to pristine perfection. He sat back with a huff and pushed back the sweaty fringe on his forehead. His knees gave an unsightly pop as he rose to a stand.
“My own shop?” Draco scoffed. “Who in the bloody hell would willingly walk into any establishment I own?” He shook his head. “No, it would have to be mail order. And under a name that certainly isn’t Malfoy.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “It’s the Ferret. Of course I had an issue. Probably will still have a few more in the future. Wouldn’t be us if we didn’t.”
All the moisture in Draco's mouth receded, leaving him faltering for speech, but Potter leaned in and spoke, mercifully removing the burden of needing to form a cogent reply.
Harry’s voice was rougher around the edges, jagged with thirst. She knew the Ministry had kept him here for days, and without the blood he needed to sustain him, was growing weaker and more testy by the hour.
Harry frowns, grabs Ron by the arm, and shoves him into the adjacent sitting room, pushing him toward the sofa. "Get in here, you idiot." Ron falls into the cushions and levels Harry with a stare. "Don't look at me like that. You came barging into someone's home and started waving your wand about. You're in the wrong here."
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Ron said quietly. “I’ve been in on several conversations regarding Draco and a number of other high-ranking Death Eaters. Brought in to help ‘solve the problem’, as it were.”
"This house has no head!" she shoots back in annoyance. "Your father saw to that. And you have chosen not to take his place there. The house has made other arrangements, it seems." Her eyes flash at Draco and he backs down. "Even if only in the interim." She directs her gaze back to Harry. "Keep your seat, Harry. Everything is fine."
Harry is silent as he crouches down and urges Draco's feet apart with his hands. Draco's arse is right above his head, and for a second, he wants to lean forward and bite and lick at the offering before him. To shove his face between those muscled cheeks and thrust his tongue inside. To make Draco shake and scream his name. To beg for mercy.
Draco huffed, but did as he was told, donning a crisp black robe. He turned back and did a saucy twirl. "Does this meet with your approval?"
Harry breathes in scent of Draco's cologne and feels the softness of his hair against his lips as he leans in to rumble in Draco's ear, "Open the door, Draco, and let's find out."
"I know," Draco says soberly. His voice goes quiet and soft around the edges, and his eyes search the rug beneath his feet. "It's just that if I take his place, it means he's really gone. If I can still be angry with him, then it's like he's still here. If I lose that and accept what he left for me, then he's really dead." Draco's eyes glance up to meet Harry's, and Harry is lost in the pain he sees there. "As much as he hated me, as enormous a bastard as he was, he was still my father. And there's a rather large part of me that doesn't want him to be gone. Because even after everything, I still love him."
Harry feels part of his face go slack. Draco's words are implying something, yet Harry can't fathom what he's hearing. "Wh—what are you saying?"
“Oh, well, problem solved, then,” Hermione chirped. “Also, I wanted to extend an invitation on behalf of Molly and Arthur. They would like it if you and Harry could come to a late supper at the Burrow tomorrow evening, and-”
"Absolutely not." Snape's voice drawled across the expanse of the lab. "You will not attend any lesson of mine dressed like that."
"No, but the pain I would have caused you if I had finished that would have been just as great. To you. It would have destroyed everything, wouldn't it?"
Harry's hand lowers outside the cracked door to what appears to be Draco's study. It's ajar enough to allow him to look inside without being seen from the hallway. Draco's bent slightly at the waist, with his back to the door, speaking with a good-looking bloke from the Floo. He makes a mental note to ask how many Floos the Manor has, since there seems to be one in just about every room.
“As good as,” Ron piped up. “He’s your Consort, and that’s a magic that’s grounded in blood. Face it, when you and Malfoy shacked up together, you pretty much got married, and that makes you family. So the Malfoy wards have no choice but to accept you.” He lowered his voice a fraction. “Not to mention the fact that you’ve actually got his blood in you.”
Draco is silent for a moment, his brows are furrowed, and Harry can almost see the words tumbling around in his head.
Harry sneaks a glance at Draco, expecting to find him fuming at the interaction between Neville and his mother.
There's a sob welling from somewhere deep in his soul, inching slowly upward like the spread of poison through his veins. He wants to scream. He wants to howl. He wants to not need this so badly. To not need Harry's direction and calm control to find that quiet place inside where he's
The second his hand touched Potter’s shoulder, Potter’s eyes flew open and he snarled, grabbing Draco and flipping him over onto the bed. Potter slammed Draco into the mattress, straddling him with hard thighs, one hand wrapped around Draco’s wrist, the other wrapped around his neck, pinning him down.
Draco laid out before him like this demands touch, and so touch Harry does. He leans up and over, crushing into Draco's arse, peppering his spine and back with bites, nibbles, licks, and kisses. Draco's skin is salty-sweet, and Harry mouths at him with relish, savoring each taste as if it is last.
Three months gone and here was, from the outset at least, a rational and composed Potter. Far different from the cagey and volatile man he'd seen plenty of. Asking for a discussion, no less. Not pleading, not shouting, not demanding. Something had indeed happened to Potter, and frankly, Draco was inclined to hear him out.
Potter's body covered the other vampire, using his thighs and ankles to press Silvestri immobile into the dirt. He watched as Potter's free hand came up and hovered over Silvestri's chest, steady and unwavering. Potter's eyes bore into the other vampire as the fabric of his robe parted over his heart, baring pale skin to the air. Smoke rose in swirling tendrils and flesh began to creep back, crackling like the sound of someone tearing old parchment.
Hours later, the sunlight is high overhead, streaming down into the greenhouse, and even with cooling charms, the heat is noticeable.
The indignant splutter that forces its way from Draco's mouth is loud in the open air. "And just what am I supposed to do about
"Well, since you haven't told me where we're going, I thought it better to err on the side of caution. Mother always said one should dress as one intends to behave." Draco smirked. "Malfoys always behave with dignity. And therefore, I am dressed respectably." He wrapped the green scarf in his other hand around his neck. Potter's eyes latched onto it like a Seeker after the snitch.
He can't hold on much longer, but Harry has to push him just a little bit. Harry leans to the side and puts his lips next to Draco's ear. Draco's head cranes, chasing him, wanting to lean into him, wanting contact, but Harry pulls back.
"I don't know why you're here, Mr. Potter, and I'm not sure it's something I need to understand. But for whatever reason, either the Manor or your own magic has brought you to us. You came in through our wards with no trouble at all, and I cannot discount that. This house sees you as family." Harry hears Malfoy suck in a breath, but he doesn't look over at him. "So, if it's sanctuary you seek, we will do our best to ensure you have it." This time, her smile is bright and wide, and more welcoming than he ever thought possible. She inclines her head regally and steps forward with a small curtsy. "We are honored to have you, Mr. Potter. May we provide you safe haven for as long as you need."
“Silvestri,” Potter warned. “Go back to your coven. By my good graces, I allowed you to come in and have your say, but I am no longer feeling hospitable.”
Draco slammed the door behind him, feeling oddly hopeful about the whole process. Yes, Snape was the same, and that was comforting. Expecting the worst of Snape's tongue and tedious tasks brought him back to his Hogwarts days. And he wasn't the same man anymore. Then again, neither was Potter. With that, the tiny bit of hope sputtered out, and Draco's stomach took an ominous turn.
"I'll think about it, yeah? How's that?" Harry offers her a genuine smile, but her expression doesn't change. She's not fooled, the Slytherin.
Harry nearly chokes on his coffee as a ripple of the Manor's magic flushes through his groin on a rush of pleasure. He sets the cup down and daps at his lips with the napkin, letting the smile spread wide on his face, because he knows Draco has done exactly as he was told.
"For fuck's sake, Potter, I'm not made of glass," he said, running soothing hands over Potter's arms, pulling him back. Tension coiled underneath Potter's skin, Draco felt it vibrating beneath the surface.
"Anyway, they all demanded to wear whatever they want, which is why Blinky looks like she does. She claims yellow makes her, of all things,
"Nothing that you weren't already aware of," she replied. "I signed for Severus yesterday by proxy."
Potter's hands pulled him close, slotting him against his body. Draco tilted his head and waited for the kiss he knew was coming. The burst of heat in his blood wasn't surprising; Potter's touch never failed to light the flames of his desire. It was the thrill that shuddered through him at the prospect of finally completing this dance between them. Now, as Potter plundered through his mouth with a damning assault, he realized this is what he'd been waiting for. Why the distance had been so hard to endure. This was the inevitable conclusion, and as the moment approached, he was breathless, entranced.
Harry's voice was cold. "Get out, Valeria." His magic pulsed and the front door flew open with a bang. The female vampire didn't move.
Potter managed to hold out his resistance for a beat longer than with Hermione, but soon, he was returning Ron’s hug. Two more sets of footsteps sounded on the stairs and Potter’s eyes shot up over Ron’s shoulder and he stiffened. Ron turned and waved over the newcomers, oblivious of Potter’s wariness.
Harry runs his hand through the softness of Draco's hair, relishing the slide through his fingers. He cups Draco's cheek, brushing his thumb across the zygomatic arch before lifting his chin to raise his head.
Draco hissed at the lance of fire that ripped through his blood, biting back a terrible whine. Potter's hand snaked around the back of his neck, pulling him upright with one hand as if it were nothing. The vampire crouched back to a half-sit, supporting Draco's weight with his other arm, fucking up into him at breakneck speed. Draco crooned and wailed, wrapping his arms around Potter like a lifeline.
Harry rests his hands on his knees as Draco begins a slow, pacing circle about the room. "If that's what you need, then yes."
. His body was singing with it, rejoicing in it, lusting after it. And if he looked at it hard enough, through the right filters, he could feel Potter’s body taking the offering with the same response.
Draco's breath is warm on his face, and his eyes are shining now. Heat is radiating from his body and Harry knows if he looks down, he's likely to see evidence of an erection in Draco's trousers. A slow, pink flush is working its way up his neck, coloring him in patches that Harry wants to lick and bite at his leisure.
Harry drinks him in, standing naked with his clothes huddled in a ball in front of him like a shield, his eyes so stormy and yearning.
It sounds too good to be true, but knowing Potter, he’s too Gryffindor to go back on his word once he’s given it, so it should check out. Honestly, he’s been planning to return to England, especially now he’s gotten his Mastery. The Manor has been empty for far too long, and despite a string of sexually creative Frenchmen in his bed, Draco intensely dislikes the French.
"Yes," he replies. "I worked through it. It's a line of thought I'm slowly learning to leave behind."
"I'm going to be opening a shop here in Wizarding Britain. Ready to wear for the everyday witch and wizard. I'm quite excited. It'll be a lot more work, but I think it will be worth it." She gives him a thorough once over. "You'll have to let me dress you, Potter. I know for certain that isn't something you picked out on your own."
Draco's frown is absolutely adorable. "Traitors. The both of you. I hope you're very happy together."
He pulled on the pajamas he never quite made it into the night before, making his way downstairs to find Granger’s head in the Floo with Potter sitting calmly on the sofa thumbing through an old copy of Quidditch Today, completely ignoring her. To her credit, she was glaring straight at him.
"Fine, fine," Harry laughs. "But you know if it goes any further, at some point, there will be much discussing." He shoots Draco a knowing look. "In detail."
"Idiots who can't see past the Mark." Her eyes hardened. "They roughed him up a bit, but he managed to escape serious injury. He said he was fine. I believed him."
Draco picked up the photo and clutched it to his chest. “This is all I want. I don’t care what you do with the rest.”
"That's because it is," Draco deadpans. "And I'm not thinking about them right now because I'm thinking about us."
"If you manage to come back again, I think it just might happen." She thinks it might be the light howl to the wind, but suddenly her ears are buzzing, like the air is whooshing around them in a fury. But the snowflakes still fall softly, and the tree branches in the distance are barely swaying.
Her hand tugged at the sleeve of his Auror jacket. “Sit down, Ron! It’s upsetting, but we have to think clearly.”
Potter thrust against him, no doubt fueled by Draco’s blood, and that made it all the hotter. He was responsible for this. Potter would never, ever come undone like this with anyone else for the rest of his life. The thought was heady and intoxicating, and even though he belonged to Potter as his Consort, to anyone on the outside looking in, it would appear that it was Potter who was lost, Potter who was bound. The power in that realization thrummed along his skin in time to Potter’s open-mouthed panting against his chest, and Draco held him tight as they rocked themselves to a grunted completion.
"Absolutely," she replies. "I got tired of waking up in strange places with even stranger people. I've discovered if I'm going to have a good time, I'd like to remember it later. This way, I don't make the same mistake twice."
The ensuite is appointed in the same grand vein as the rest of the chamber: spacious, elegant, and luxuriously inviting. Harry turns the shower on and chucks off his pajamas as steam starts billowing out. He steps in, assaulted on all sides from the six showerheads. Harry groans and braces his hands on the tile at the glorious feel of the hot water. The tile must be charmed because it's warm beneath his hands. No bracing cold. He turns and presses his back to it, throwing his head back in pleasure. The pounding spray is heavenly, and the warm tile against his back feels so good he wants to sink into it.
Adjustment made, they come together, skin on skin as Potter bears him down to the mattress. Potter hitches Draco’s left leg high up on his hip, slotting their cocks together on a rough sigh. Draco hooks his ankle around Potter’s waist and keens as Potter takes them both in hand and strokes hard, thumbing through the wetness of Draco’s leaking tip. He’s embarrassed at the high pitch and neediness to his voice, but Potter merely huffs and latches onto one of Draco’s nipples, biting and suckling at the taut peak.
Draco opens his mouth to ask the bartender for a napkin to make an attempt at drying off, but a pristine white handkerchief is thrust under his nose. Potter’s smile is still there, but there is also a low heat banking in those green eyes. He says that Potter doesn’t seem the handkerchief type, but thanks him all the same. Potter shrugs and tells him he carries one for his godson. Apparently, they go for ice cream often, and the boy is quite messy.
Harry's breath stutters when he realizes he hasn't said a single word to Malfoy since entering the room. Malfoy has worked himself into this state all on his own. And that is unacceptable.
His mother’s words came back to him and he found himself wrapping his arms around Ron in return. “One Potter, as your wife requested. You’re welcome, Weasel,” Draco whispered back.
"Not long enough," Narcissa replies with a lift of her chin. She will not allow him to rankle her, and her eyes narrow in response.
. He looks absolutely unruffled at Harry's sudden presence at their side. It's either a Slytherin thing or a pureblood thing, Harry surmises, because Zabini affects a cool arrogance while Draco maintains a cool disdain. He's all polish and galleons in silk-embroidered robes, with strong, white teeth gleaming against smooth, dark skin. Rich brown eyes glitter as his gaze rakes over Draco hungrily—it's the look the hunter gives the rabbit that has slipped the snare.
The Weasel was even worse. Affable and easygoing, he was nothing like the Ronald Weasley he remembered from school. Then again, neither of them were the same people they had been before. This time, Ron made no bones about clattering around Grimmauld, shouting to tear the roof off. Potter had shouted for Weasley to 'fuck off since vampires were trying to sleep', but even he could hear the protest held no heat. Maybe whatever transpired between them had been resolved, or Potter was too worn out from his secretive exploits to effectively posture a threat. Again with the clothes-throwing, but with more man-handling (he hadn't been thrust into a shower that hard since his Quidditch days). Draco should have suspected something along those lines, because he found himself side by side with Ron in the stands cheering for the cringe-worthy Chudley Cannons.
Pansy's eyes glitter with mischievous amusement. "You let me get my hands and my fabric on you and you'll have Draco eating out of the palm of your hand for eternity." Her lips quirk. "If he doesn't already."
"You must think me rather silly, I suppose, asking for a hug in broad daylight," he murmurs into her hair. "I don't think I ever asked for a hug before. They've always been sort of given to me." He pulls back to see the beginnings of tears in her eyes. Happy ones, he surmises, based on the brightness glimmering there. "I hope Draco doesn't think I'm trying to steal you away from him or some such nonsense."
The prickle against his skin and the burn in his chest spread out all over his body, and he sees nothing but Fiendfyre in Potter’s eyes.
Potter stood and instead of walking to the door, stepped closer to the bed. Draco pressed back against the headboard and swallowed, unsure of what was about to happen. Potter reached out slowly and pulled the hand still resting across Draco’s chest away. His eyes flicked to the faint ridges of the scars, as one finger trailed over them. “I’m sorry,” Potter said softly, his eyes dim with remembrance.
"So you push him away, pretend you don't care? Because you think it will hurt less if something does happen to him?" A suspicious gleam appeared in the corner of Potter's eyes, one that threatened at wetness. "You're already invested, surely you see that? It's going to hurt no matter what if you lose him. You have to ask yourself which is worse, having nothing but happy memories, or regretting having nothing at all?"
Draco looked down at his t-shirt and jeans. "I'll admit they're not the most bespoke of garments, but really Severus, they're quite comfortable."
Draco snorted. "No, I wear a Mark on my arm. There isn't room for anything else. However, a trinket wouldn't go amiss. After all, nothing says 'I'm chuffed to have you as my sole food source' like an expensive piece of jewelry."
Blinky lets go of his hand. "You's be sitting, Master Harry. Blinky is to be bringing you breakfast." The cheery little elf prods him in the direction of the nearest chair, forcing him down into it with a tiny, but very strong grip on his elbow.
Harry gathers him close, wrapping his arms around Draco's neck. "Shh, no, no—you're fine. You did beautifully. You did exactly what I wanted you to." He rubs a hand up Draco's nape, threading his fingers through the damp strands of hair. Draco rests his chin on Harry's shoulder, and Harry can feel some tension bleeding back into his body. "What is it?" he whispers.
The smile works its way across Malfoy's lips with some effort, but ultimately Malfoy can't hold it back. "Two weeks!" he exclaims. "I subsisted on stolen apples and pilfered Brie from my own fucking larder whilst trying to avoid shitting my mother's rugs with every step." He's laughing now, and the sound is infectious.
"I thought you didn't offer your body in gratitude," Potter said, his gaze trained on Draco's mouth.
"I don't think she'll be too upset. She dotes on you, you know." Draco's smile is soft. "And she's not my owl. She's yours."
“I realize this is a difficult situation for all involved,” Silvestri said with empathy. “However, should Potter make the wrong decision, you have to understand that it will give me no pleasure to sanction his demise.”
"Of course you are!" Draco hisses in return. "I'm not stupid. Don't think I don't know what all your
Draco's head snaps back and his eyes slam shut. His mouth falls open on a keening, guttural groan that's got to be coming from his toes. The sound is so resonant it hits Harry right in the balls and he has to press the heel of his hand to the raging hard-on in his trousers to keep from joining Draco in plummeting over the edge. The muscles and tendons in Draco's neck are straining against his skin, and Harry wants to lean forward and sink his teeth in right there over Draco's pulse. He wants to feel the pounding of Draco's blood, feel the shake of his body as he rides out the high of orgasm.
“I don’t think it’s as out of your reach as you might think.” Potter tilted his head to the side and studied him, as if he were a puzzle that somehow needed to be solved.
Harry reaches out and claps him soundly on the back. He coughs and splutters, shooting daggers at his mother with his gaze through each hacking breath.
Potter's hand dropped from his cock and he approached the bed, climbing in with a slow, controlled crawl. He'd never looked more dangerous. With his messy hair, lust-darkened eyes, and the rangy tension of an apex predator looking to toy with its prey, Potter loomed over him, forcing Draco down to the pillows.
Harry leans further down and presses a soft kiss to Draco's forehead. When he pulls back, Draco's eyes are wide and glassy. He brushes the back of his hand over Draco's cheek. "No, Draco, thank you. And because you've been so good, I think you've earned some kissing."
Draco closed his eyes and willed his frantic heart to slow. The moment he saw the word ‘consort’ on the parchment, he knew exactly what was being offered. Bound to Potter. Forced to allow him to feed. Tied irrevocably to another master by circumstances beyond his control. Yet, freedom crept over the horizon, blazing as it came into view. But to what end? And how great was the price? How far had Potter fallen for this, for the Savior’s saving grace to be himself?
"And we'll honeymoon in Provence. I love Provence. It's the French I can't stand, but I love Provence."
"No," he said firmly, shaking his head. "You don't get to speak to me. Not yet. Not while I'm within a breath of cursing you if I hear your voice." Draco's eyes flashed dangerously, and Potter eased back, waiting silently. Draco lowered his finger and paced the floor with sharp, pointed steps, keeping his narrowed gaze on the vampire. "Two years, Potter. Two fucking years I sat in Azkaban, and in that time I lost everything I once held precious. I would have waited a lifetime if it meant I could see her again, one last time." A dry chuckle escaped his throat. "So Christmas comes early, and I think that I what I wanted most was right in my grasp. A chance to see my mother again, even if it would be whispered words over her dead body. A chance to say the things I never got to, a chance to make peace with our sins." He stopped, turning his body to face the vampire. "You took that from me. Led me to it like a lamb to slaughter and then snatched it from me like a damned Snitch." His voice dropped. "I don't know if I can forgive you for that."
"I think you'd like that. My hand on your cock. Stroking you. Maybe running my thumb over your slit. Would you be wet for me?" Draco sucks in a gasping breath as his chest heaves. "I think you would. I think you'd be absolutely dripping for me." Harry's eyebrow raises. "Are you wet for me now?"
The shower spray is steaming hot and ready for him as he steps inside, and his first thought is to wrap his hand around his cock and pull on it for all he's worth.
Her face is open and quiet, like it always is when he comes to her in these moments. She is the bedrock of his life, the one constant through the squall of war and the hell of aftermath.
Wonderful. He supposes he should be glad that Gilles never drank red wine, otherwise his five-thousand pound bespoke Huntsman suit would be ruined. Draco makes his way to the bar when a chuckle draws his eye to the right. As if this evening can’t get any worse, fucking Potter is slouched against the bar rail, sipping his drink, looking for all the world like he’s just been thoroughly entertained.
His grip loosened and she pulled her arm back with a jerk, rubbing the skin. “Yes, damn you.” It felt like a lost cause, but her heart refused to relinquish the possibility. “I can accept what you are, because I knew the man you were. And that’s enough for me.”
Those soft words of permission have Draco at the cabinet in a flash, his eyes roving over every piece in detail. In the end, he chooses a thin leather crop and a green silk blindfold. Harry stays silent as Draco turns back around and moves forward. He kneels at Harry's feet and bows his head, raising his hands to present the items for inspection.
"It's alright, Harry. I'm here. Come on, I'll call for backup if I need to." Ron's gesturing with his other hand for Harry to move forward.
Draco scrambles to his feet and regrips himself, leaning forward to use his left hand to reach back and gingerly trace around his arse. The touch is energizing, and flashes quick in his blood like fire. His hole twitches as he works in one finger, then two, aided by the only wandless spell he can still manage. The same one every boy of a certain age learns to master. It's awkward, standing in this position, panting and jerking and fucking himself with lube-slick fingers, but he imagines Harry on the other side of the glass, watching him through the fog. Eyes bright and pupils blown, his gaze never wavering on Draco's every move.
Molly smiled in the way of all wise women. It was a look he’d seen grace his mother’s face often. “No difficult conversation should ever take place without the comfort of a cuppa, dear.”
"Charmed." Malfoy speaks again in the same irritated tone. "The windows. You change the lighting to suit your needs." He points to a side door in the far corner. "Closet's through there. Easels, supplies, whatnot. You'll have to go through it, as I have no idea what's in there. So don't ask."
"And it's helping, you say?" Draco asked. As if he really needed to ask the question at all—it was all written there on Potter's face. Potter was in a far better place than when Draco had left.
Draco turned to find Granger staring at Potter with trepidation. He stood straight, mouth pinched in a tight line. They stood that way for a moment before she sighed, “Oh, Harry!” and flung her arms around his neck. Potter didn’t move, but then his eyes closed and his arms slid around her in return. Weasley let out a small gasp of surprise. Granger’s body shook in Potter’s arms and the unmistakable sound of muffled tears filtered from their embrace.
"I could make you come like this, couldn't I? I could eat you from the inside out and have your cock explode without a single touch." Harry lets his voice drop low, rumbling across Draco's skin. "I could spend hours here, stretching you out, fucking your sweet little hole with my tongue, making you beg for release." Draco's gasping in short, breathy whuffs. "Would you beg for me, Draco? Would you beg for my tongue in your arse?"
Potter nodded. "I know. It took me a fair few tantrums and quite a bit of alcohol to realize that. That you were right about me. About everything. It was," he paused, "a distasteful realization." He sucked in a breath and ran his hands along denim-covered thighs. "I didn't want to feel that anymore." He pursed his lips. "I'm seeing someone."
"You are magnificent—" Draco pants between kisses, "—absolutely magnificent. Do you have any idea what that does to me?" He grabs Harry's hand and pulls it to his crotch. Draco's cock is beyond hard. "That was the hottest fucking thing I have ever seen," he whines as Harry's fingers curl around the rigid length. "I had no idea a spell like that even
When Harry turns and sets his eyes on Draco's, something unfurls in Harry's chest and bottoms out in his toes. Draco's eyes are soft and silver and the slight purse of his lips in thought sends a shiver of want throughout Harry's body. Draco is breathtakingly beautiful. In any light, at any time of day, no matter the situation or context. And he belongs to Harry. The warmth that curls through him has a dark edge, one that trips the light fantastic between possession and
to love you. I'm not afraid to love you. Not anymore. I'm committed to loving you. And loving you means that I have to work on myself and get through my issues." He brushed the back of his hand across Draco's face. "I'd like for you to stand by me while I do that. I need to do it for myself, but Draco, I want to do it for you."
"I don't give a shit who the fuck it is," Harry spits back, getting in Ron's face. "What the hell do you think you were doing, pointing your wand at Draco? You're an Auror, for fuck's sake!"
The tent in Draco's pajamas is unmistakable. As is the darkening spot of damp on the pale blue fabric.
Harry turns to get back to painting when Blinky pops in, her sunny yellow ruffles and bright eyes making her glow with happiness.
Potter leaned forward, and fixed Draco with a stare he felt down to his soul. "I haven't changed," he said. "I'm still me. Fucked up, faults, and all. I still feel the way I did before. The difference is that I'm learning how to deal with those feelings and make different choices because of them. I didn't come earlier because I knew you really didn't want to see me, and also because I wasn't ready."
The fine hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood on end as the taste of her worry grew into something darker.
"Finally," Draco whines, attacking Harry's neck with a series of biting kisses, sucking at him as he grinds their cocks together.
His arse is, quite literally, a sopping mess. Harry's spit is smeared all over the crack of Draco's arse, over his hole, dripping down over his balls. He rubs the bridge of his nose in hard, tilting his head to nip and suckle until Draco's high-pitched whine turns into a lust-filled moan.
Narcissa looks to Draco for confirmation. His head is bowed over his toast, and he crunches into it with force, nodding curtly.
"Because," he chuckles, biting down on her bottom lip hard enough to make her gasp, "your roses are trilling."
Draco headed to the kitchen and found his plate under a warming charm. He rummaged through the cabinets to find a glass and filled it with water from the tap. Potter made no effort to point out were things were, so he rifled through the drawers for some cutlery and then took his plate and glass to the table. He pulled out the chair to sit, wincing as the legs made a loud, scraping noise.
As for the door, 'warded' was an understatement. It was sealed to hell and back with every spell under Merlin, naturally raising Draco's curiosity. A pinkie finger to the doorknob got him a nasty Stinging Hex to the arse for his troubles, and now the fucking thing had taken to spitting one at him whenever he got too close. He gave the door and its hair-trigger knob a wide berth when he passed down the hallway. And if Potter noticed him rubbing his arse and hugging the wall like he was plastered to it when he went to piss, he at least had the decency to not mention it.
Draco's acquiescence is warm and liquid in Harry's chest. It's amazing how a little patience and some self-control can bring out this side of Draco. The one that wants to understand, the one that wants to please. And Harry wants to repay him for his willingness to learn. Harry dips his head and drags the bridge of his nose along the column of Draco's neck, watching him swallow hard in response. He breathes out over Draco's skin, warm and humid, leaving behind just a flicker of moisture.
Draco crouched in front of him, lifted his chin, and kissed him hard, bruising and cruel. Potter whimpered, whispery and broken, and the sound sludged through Draco's veins like lead, oozing into the dark and empty space in his heart that somehow had always belonged to Potter. He pulled back with a jerk, firm in his resolve, even though it weighed heavy on his tongue, more bitter than sweet, chalky and scorched like ash in his mouth.
She pulls back and presses a warm kiss to his cheek, drifting out of his hold with a swish of her skirts before she heads for Malfoy. Harry's breath stalls in his chest as he watches Narcissa enfold Malfoy with the same slow movements. He expected it to be a sort of lip service, what she said earlier about the wards recognizing him as family. But now, seeing her with Draco, it hits home. She's treating him exactly the same way she treats Malfoy. Not as a guest, not even as a friend, but as a son.
"Ah, I see." He says it like he knows something she doesn't. And he might, given that he knows Harry so well. "But you believe they will be soon, yes? I can hear it in your tone," he teases. "Mother's intuition?"
Draco shudders as Harry lets his fingers trail over the warm skin. He kneads against Draco's arse cheeks, and one of his thumbs dips in to brush lightly over the hole. Draco moans.
In seconds, he had Potter's face between his hands and crushed their mouths together on a frantic kiss. Potter clutched at him for support and Draco pulled back, panting.
He registered the sound of Potter’s fingers snapping, and then there was a lube-slick hand palming the bare flesh of his cock. Draco gasped and bucked into the stroke of Potter’s hand, moving along the shaft with distinctive purpose. Those fingers dipped backward to the cleft of his arse, circling his opening. It wasn’t tentative or unsure, but single-minded, and Draco felt his legs part as if they had no other choice in the matter. He felt a finger slowly press on, working to breach the tight muscle. The lubrication mitigated the burn, but he honestly couldn’t tell one fire from another at this point in time.
Harry glares at him. "Please, Draco." His tone isn't at all pleading, but it seems to satisfy Draco, who sighs loudly with annoyance.
Silvestri's fangs were ghosting over Draco's skin, and Draco was so caught in the thrall he was shaking with want. One involuntary jerk and those fangs would pierce his skin.
Harry snorted out a rough breath, watching the light in Draco's eyes fade. He should stop now, he knew that. Stop now, and keep to his course. But Draco's hair was ruffled, his lips were swollen and slick, and Harry was a complete bastard.
"I was low, lower than I have ever been, even after the war, when I came back. My head was in all sorts of places, and I admit to…unhealthy ways of coping."
"Of course I refused him," Potter spat. "I've spent my whole life being at the mercy of other people's prophecies and decisions. I'm done with that. Whatever I am now, I am my own. Silvestri wants me by his side and under his thumb. Two places I have no desire to be. It's been that way from the beginning. I told him that straight off. And when he realized I wouldn't do what he wanted, he cast me out. He told the Ministry I had refused him, of course not giving them all the facts, and because he has such control of the Council, no one there would dare go against anything he said. Basically, it boils down to the petulant whinging of an arrogant man who didn't get everything he wanted." Potter's lips quirked. "It seems I'm destined to be saddled with those forever."
"I thought the Council was headed by a quorum? How can he be their leader? And why was he so insistent? And why don't you like him?" Draco's mouth ran away with him, spouting off the rapid fire questions with barely a breath in between.
Draco's not relaxed, but he's not tense, either. Harry moves to stand in front of him and looks down. Draco's cock is completely soft. It's not unheard of for subs to remain unaffected until the scene actually begins, but in Harry's experience, most subs are at least half-hard by this point. The anticipation itself is a point of arousal. But Draco's not aroused, not in the slightest, and that gives Harry considerable pause. His skin is pricked with a fine layer of sweat, but even with the fireplace going, it's not that warm in the room. He's not anticipating pleasure, he's—
"God, I've dreamed of opening you up like this," Potter panted as he slipped the tip of one finger inside. "Stretching you with my tongue and my fingers, feeling you, tasting you, getting you all hot and slick." The point of Potter's tongue licked around his finger, the twin sensations making his knees lock to avoid collapsing. "I want you wet for me, God, Draco, so fucking wet. Shiny, pink, and perfect, just open and ready for my cock."
This time, Draco barked out a sharp laugh. "The thrall? This from a man who can throw off an Imperius and defeat the most powerful Dark wizard of our time with a disarming spell? You think I'm going to believe that you can't shrug off the attempted thrall of a two-knut rogue vampire?" He laughed even harder, shaking his head in disbelief. "That's rich, Potter. No, I think when you came upon that vampire it was the answer to your prayers. Because I think your friends all knew you had a death wish, and if you died in service, you knew that they would always wonder, and that would be more guilt for you to take to the grave. But murdered by a vampire in the middle of an escape? It's tragic, and unlucky, and utterly exculpating. How fortuitous."
Draco rises slowly and turns, kneeling on the cushions and placing his hands as directed. His head falls forward and his eyes close again. His breathing is rapid, but he's breathing in heavily through his nose to calm himself. To trust Harry. It's a pleasing sight.
He was starting to get to the point of feeling like this was to be his life. Barely civil interaction with a man he was all but married to, time alone with nothing but his thoughts and the company of a fawning house-elf, and sporadic moments of happiness to break up the mind-numbing monotony. He was a second away from leaving his breakfast on the table to brave that damnable door and force Potter into a half-hearted apology just to have something interesting to do, when Potter appeared in front of him.
Draco had pulled Potter hard against him, and their bodies collided as he wedged his face into Draco's bared neck. Potter's hands reached out to clasp his hips, fingers brushing under the edge of his t-shirt to rest on the skin above the waistband of his jeans. Draco expected the rough curl of Potter's fingers to anchor them together, but instead, Potter kept his touch light, stroking in feathery caresses.
Harry watches as Narcissa's eyes rove over Neville with careful interest at his tone. He releases her hand, and she pulls it back slowly, almost reluctantly. "Of course," she murmurs, "and it's Narcissa, please. We're not as formal as we used to be."
Harry knows it's foolish to think that all traces of Blaise's influence would be gone by this point in time. It's something they're going to have to work through, little by little, and some hesitance is expected. But this is how they will build trust. And Harry's not cruel enough to chastise him for it right now.
Harry blows out a breath and leans in with a smile. "Afraid not. I have a date tonight." He tilts his head to consider her. "And you?"
The thought of pressing Draco against these same tiles starts a slow burn in his blood. He imagines Draco, long-limbed and gorgeous, begging for Harry's touch. Harry can see them tangled together, skin on skin, mouths against flesh, panting and desperate as Harry fucks him into the wall. Draco moans and writhes beneath him, clinging to Harry with fingers that bite, like he's the only thing Draco needs in this world.
Hermione squeezed his arm. "Talk to him first. I see your color rising. If he didn't come to you, there must be a reason. Calm down, and find out what it is."
He raises his arms and cranes his neck around to where her eyes are focused. "Oh, my back? Yes, it's a tattoo."
Those last three words thrilled him more than they probably should have, but looking into Potter's eyes, he found an honesty and earnestness that was anything but false.
He returned his gaze to his own paperwork on the table, picking up the sheet of letterhead with the logo he'd decided on. Severus had left the details up to him, specifying only that his share of the profits be donated to a revolving list of charities he had chosen. At the top center of the parchment, a raven with a set of spectacles perched atop the edge of a black cauldron, dangling a dark green serpent from its beak. 'D.S & CO.' was whited out on the face of the cauldron, with the tag 'Quality Potions for Discerning Tastes' written in Slytherin green below. It was simple, elegant, with a mysterious edge that Draco found comforting. Not to mention that one would be hard pressed to connect it to the name 'Malfoy'.
Draco's eyebrow rose. "So, what did he want with you, then? I'm guessing this wasn't the first time you had that particular conversation."
Potter took the statement in stride, tilting his head to the side and smiling. "Do you really think Molly's going to kick you out? I'm surprised she hasn't given you your own wing."
Draco swivels to face him and Harry can see a light in his eyes. "A Malfoy is always punctual." The little grin that slides across his lips makes Harry want to tackle him and fuck him into the floor. "Especially when he's the guest of honor."
Something in Potter's tone had him unwinding the fabric and letting it hang from his hand. Potter's gaze lingered on his neck. Draco frowned as he realized how much of his neck was still exposed, even under the collar of his shirt. "Do you want me to freeze, Potter?"
"What the bloody hell is this?" he exclaimed. "Why does Potter have a ten percent stake in the company?"
Potter vibrated with anger, demanding an answer. "Then tell me why, Draco? If the answer is so obvious as to why I saved you, then why did
"I'll never understand how you were able to strategize to win a war and defeat a Dark Lord with an army of children with tactics like these." Draco's tone drips with scorn.
"Oh," he said, perking up, "I think you should know, I'm pretty sure our owls are involved in some sort of romantic relationship."
Studio is an understatement, as are most things when it comes to Malfoy. The ballroom-sized space is open and airy, with bright white walls that extend upwards to what has to be a twenty or twenty-five foot ceiling. The wall directly opposite the door has to be some thirty feet across, and floor to ceiling windows are reflecting the outside winter landscape. It's gone half-nine in the evening, but those windows are letting in early morning sunshine.
Hermione opened the door to the cell and stepped inside, keeping her back to the door as she closed it. Despite her feelings to the contrary, Harry was still dangerous. And not sleeping as his back to the door would imply.
"I want to know that you're in my room, my space, my shower, smelling like me, fucking into your fist, gasping for me. I want you to make yourself come for me, and then I want you to wear something from my closet and come down for breakfast. Am I clear?"
As expected, the glare does nothing to faze Potter in the slightest. He simply smiles and asks after his mother with genuine interest. He says he hopes the move to Paris was beneficial for them both. He says he understands now why Draco couldn’t stay.
“Anyway,” Ron said, sucking in a determined breath to rise to his feet, “I have a bone to pick with His Pointiness.”
“Well, you certainly know how to sweet-talk a bloke.” Draco scoffed, affecting Potter’s tone, “’Disfigurement looks good on you, Malfoy’.” He sneered and continued, “Nice fangs, Potter.” Potter’s eyes narrowed. “Stings doesn’t it?”
His gaze flicked back to Potter, who stood with his arms crossed over his chest in a measure of impatience. Draco’s eyes caught the attention of a small frame on the desk and when he went over for a better look, he gasped in surprise. Potter was by his side in an instant.
He looks down at where Harry’s hands are clasped together. Before he can ask what Harry’s holding, a hand opens and Draco’s eyes fall on a velvet box that he knows can only come from his favorite jeweler. Harry pops the box open to reveal a thin platinum band studded with sparking pave diamonds. It’s flashy, yet subtle. It’s totally Draco.
Draco sighs. "Ugh. Take her. Not even half an hour and already I'm reminded of why she's a loathsome bint."
It’s far too charming and sincere to be anything but, and Draco feels only slightly guilty at his outburst. But only slightly. Potter apologizes for the deceit in getting him to return to England. He says he was against it from the start, and that Draco should have been approached differently. Potter’s face is nothing but earnest and incredibly handsome and it hits Draco at his core. Draco wants to believe it’s not Potter’s good looks and genuine nature that has him asking how he can help. Outside of talking to his father, of course, because that’s not happening. Period. End of story. Dealbreaker. Back to France before you can blink, Potter. But even though he wants to believe it isn’t, he knows it is.
“Not until you leave the room. You’ve annoyed me, so now I plan on denying you the sight of my glorious nakedness. A worthy and just punishment.”
Harry licked his forefinger, fangs peeking out from beneath his lip and turned another page. “That’s what I said.”
He moved so fast, lightning quick, to grab her wrist and hold it tight. Harry’s eyes stared her down, and she felt herself fall underneath the deep, green gaze. “I could take you now,” he said softly, squeezing tighter. “I could drag you across this table before you could even think about reaching for your wand.” Her breath stuttered against the coldness of his grip, and she was lost inside the endless sea of his gaze. “I could take you to the floor, press my fangs against your neck and bleed you dry before anyone could save you. I could kill you in the space of a heartbeat for no other reason than I am hungry and you are here.” His head tilted to the side as his smile mocked her. “Is that the man you want to help?”
But Draco’s body was no longer content to stand pliant, and against all good judgment, he began to move. He writhed beneath Potter, arching into him, his traitorous body all but begging for more. The action sparked something in the vampire, and suddenly his hands were everywhere, teasing and stroking, ghosting over his water-slick skin. Potter’s hands mapped out the planes of Draco’s chest and arms, and when his hand slid down to cover the Dark Mark and squeeze, Draco cried out in reckless abandon.
"Neville helped me find the flowers, but I charmed them to be everlasting. No matter the season, the weather, these flowers will bloom like this forever. I thought it would be a nice tribute to her memory."
Draco's cry of orgasm is sobbed into Harry's mouth, and his entire body bucks like he's being electrocuted. Harry feels the warm wetness seep into his trousers, and the knowledge that Draco has been completely unmade triggers his cock into bursting. He comes hard, still licking into Draco's mouth, with white lights flashing behind his eyes.
"You thought he would kill you," Draco pointed out. "And you were going to let him. Suicide by fangs?" Draco tsked. "Sad."
Malfoy's gaze is piercing on his back as Harry makes his lap around the room, and he picks up on the silent seething that's being directed his way. He knows Malfoy has changed, can see that in so many other ways, but right now the clock is ticking.
"It doesn't really matter if it's about Owen or not," Harry says. "I've made my decision." He takes a long gulp from the glass, draining it and slamming it onto the table. "And apparently, the Ministry has made theirs. It's done. I'm not going back."
Draco keeps his stare focused on the small centerpiece. "What about you?" His voice is quiet, tone low and soft.
Harry's cock throbs painfully with the need to be inside him, but he can't give this up just yet, not while Draco is taking everything he has to give with such unadulterated
“If he decides he wants to see us.” The hurt was evident, not just in her words, but the slight pinch to her face. She rose to her feet gracefully and smiled up at him. “It’s been a while, and I don’t think we all quite know each other anymore. Perhaps we should reacquaint ourselves?” Granger offered her hand. “I don’t think we’ve been introduced. Hermione Granger-Weasley, brightest witch of her age.”
His left hand throbbed, warm and sticky, and he heard Potter's strangled whimper behind him. Draco turned, broken from his declaration by Potter's sudden proximity. Potter's face was wild and feral, and the swirling darkness he had seen earlier in those eyes had widened, their focus trained on Draco's bloody hand. It was mesmerizing, the intent in Potter's eyes, and Draco brought his hand up without thought. Something warm and fuzzy tingled over him, calling him closer to Potter, pulling him in and draining away his will. Potter's hand snatched his wrist and his tongue came out to lap at the blood in his palm. It was soothing and stimulating all at once, and Potter's lips whispered against his skin, sealing the cut wordlessly.
Nev's right of course, so Harry wishes him well and ends the call, knowing he'll see him soon. He's finishing tying the laces on his trainers when Blinky pops in.
A flick of Harry's wrist puts a Cushioning charm on the floor. He smiles up at Draco, lips pulling back over his teeth in a devilish grin.
Harry shrugged, not liking the guilty way her direct gaze made him feel. “If he wants to go and see her, I have no problem with that. I won’t keep him from her.” It was effortless that after only a few hours they were back to their old habits, and Hermione rolled her eyes and sighed.
"Good morning, Harry." It might be his imagination, but Draco's standing a bit taller, as if there was nothing in the world to weigh him down.
Harry runs a hand over the line of his suit. "Narcissa, actually. I'd be lucky to have on matching socks if it weren't for her."
. He's waited this long for a taste of Draco's mouth, waited this long to see Draco come undone again.
Draco whimpers at the tingle of magic on his skin, and Harry knows he's overstimulated. His heavy-lidded eyes are barely cracked, his mouth open as his breathing struggles to level out, but his face is slack and sated. Harry kneels down next to him, wrapping the towel around his shoulders, careful not touch him directly. He's a bit of dead weight, and while Harry can handle him no problem, he casts a Lightening charm just to get Draco to his feet without any undue jostling. Harry walks him to the bathroom, murmuring soft noises of encouragement in his ear.
"Potter!" Draco cried, fisting his hands into the sheets. Potter's chuckle rumbled against his skin as his tongue circled Draco's hole. Potter's fangs scraped over the sensitive flesh, sending ripples of super-heated pleasure through body. His cock hardened even more, the tip dipping down to drag over the cotton sheet, leaving a thin, wet trail behind. Potter's tongue stabbed at him, wriggling and working its way inside, forcing sounds out of his throat he'd never thought possible.
Behind the charm, Draco’s eyebrows rose, but he remained silent, too interested in watching the confrontation unfold to be bothered by Potter’s vehement statement of possession.
. His body is lax and half-twisted among the sheets, and there's enough skin peeking out to make Harry's pupils dilate, widening to soak in as much of the sight as possible. He sleeps with the heavy repose of the sated and utterly satisfied, spent for all the best reasons, like Harry's completely fucked him out.
Harry grins. "It kind of is." He shifts and pokes at Ron again to get his full attention. "So…how was it?"
The smile on Potter’s face falters briefly and he nods again in quick succession with a ‘yeah’ and a ‘sure’ before some of the brightness in his eyes fades. It’s all platitudes now—he’ll be missed (he won’t), he should keep in touch (he shouldn’t), and he hopes it all goes well for him (that seems to be sincere), but he’s really here for one thing, he says.
Harry's chest swells and his breath catches. He'd expected nothing more than cold politeness from Draco, and here he is, welcoming Neville with genuine pleasure. And the short glance that Draco shoots him again only drives home his theory. This is for Harry. Yes, it probably has something to do with Draco letting go of old habits, but this is also Draco showing Harry that he is capable of anticipating Harry's wishes. Of welcoming Neville so warmly because it's what Harry wants. And he's done it without being asked. Even after the failure of last night's encounter, Draco is showing Harry that he can be a better man, that he's not harboring any petulance or affront after Harry all but tossed him out on his arse.
"Frankly, the worst part was having to go to Snape with my tail between my legs. One more thing he gets to lord over me, I suppose. He always did like that, snarky bastard." Potter's brow furrowed. "Your chat was quick. I thought he'd have more to say."
Draco stiffened. "Oh, yes, His Saviorness and his Boundless Magical Talents. How easily one forgets such things."
"One, your magic brought you here, recognizing your innate need without you even knowing what it is, or…two—"
“I realize the Ministry has you on a short leash, but the Council could be persuaded—” Draco’s footfalls creaked on the staircase, causing both men below to look up. It was the vampire from before, the one present at Azkaban. Draco continued down the stairs, stopping just short of Potter. His gaze raked over Draco with a dangerous gleam of interest that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
"I don't know," Ron whines, slipping back down into the cushions. "It just happened. Hermione wanted to talk to her more about this new shop she's opening, and she invited her round." Ron glanced up at him. "We had her over for dinner. Then we had her on the kitchen table. And again in the sitting room. I think I fucked up my back. If this continues, it will likely kill me."
“Thank you,” he whispered in Draco’s ear. “Thank you, Draco. So fucking much.” There was a choked half-sob in there somewhere.
"Very well, let's begin." Harry gestures with a nod. "Take off your clothes and place them on the end of the sofa."
They clung to each other as they rode out the last of the aftershocks, shivering against each other as they fell in a tangle to the bed. Potter rolled him to the side and spooned behind him, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco. He mouthed at the nape of Draco's neck, nosing through the strands of his damp hair, licking the sweat from his skin.
"Merlin," Hermione whispered. "If he's gone back there—" Her voice broke on a sharp breath. "You don't think—?"
He took a moment to look over Potter. He was dressed in his usual muggle wear. A pair of well-worn denims ripped out at the knees, a pair of scuffed trainers, and a faded t-shirt proclaiming something called ‘Van Halen’.
"You should get over that, then. Because you're going to find that as long as I'm here, I'm going to be looking at all of you. Mark and all. Inside and out. There isn't anything that you won't be able to hide from me." He smiles as Malfoy registers his words with restrained surprise, and possibly a bit of fear. It's an astonishing good look for the Slytherin. "Not for long, anyway."
"I went into your room," Potter said, suddenly more subdued, as if the memories were all catching up with him, "just to see if I could still smell you in there. Hear your heartbeat. But there was nothing. You were gone." He snapped his fingers, and Draco startled in surprise. "Like that."
Harry roared, his magic surrounding her to lift her from the floor and throw her out the open door. Valeria whooshed out the doorway with a shout of protest, arms and legs flailing against the power of Harry's magic. The door slammed shut and the wards strengthened. Her presence no longer irritated them. She was gone.
It's not the first time his sexuality has been on trial, Merlin knows. When he first came out as gay, the resulting backlash took almost a year to die down. And then when Owen came forward to the Prophet with his tell-all article on quote, "the Dark Side of Our Saviour", all hell broke loose. No one cared that Owen Redfield was a consenting partner to their bedroom activities, merely that the Great Harry Potter was a dominating top with a demanding streak. Of course the Prophet and the scheming Rita Skeeter would pounce on the opportunity to make Owen out to be an abused lover rather than the self-serving, Galleon-grubbing jackass that he is.
Harry releases him from the restraints, and they head back into the bedroom. The shower is already running in the bathroom, and Draco commits himself into Harry's aftercare with a sigh and a soft smile.
He threads his fingers through his hair, working it into a rich lather. The scent is permeating through the steam and he's dizzy with it, almost reeling from the potency. It hits him right in the groin and Draco realizes he's hard. Extremely hard.
Ron's head falls back onto the sofa. "Yeah. We had a—" he makes finger quotes in the air, "talk." He laughs. "Frankly, when she brought it up, it didn't send me into a cold sweat like it normally does. You know how she gets when she's in 'discussion mode'."
Which, in and of itself, can be charming…to a point. Draco’s always fancied himself a bit of an aggressor when it comes to sex, but he’s generally topping from the bottom, so to speak. He sort of misses being pursued, being more demanding in his pleasure, and a partner who is a little more fluid in their sexual dynamic. Gilles wants to be pampered, and it’s become obvious that he relies on exceptional fellatio to get it. He can’t deny that Gilles is lovely and delicate, with a softness that beckons to be ruined. It’s been no hardship to worship his lithe body among silken sheets and candlelight, but the man’s personality simply doesn’t deserve it.
“Yeah, we’ll see. Good night.” She left and shut the door behind her. He turned back to Ron, who was grinning like there was no tomorrow.
The daggers are back in Malfoy's gray stare. "You're infuriating. You demand familiarity and in the next breath you're sneering 'Malfoy' like we're first years."
Silvestri smiled and raised his head, but not before the point of his tongue darted out to drag across the marks on Draco's skin. Draco whined and shivered again, his hands flexing at his sides. As always, Harry's eye drew toward Draco's long fingers, and he could see the point of Draco's wand barely peeking out from underneath the cuff of his sleeve.
He has to stretch a bit more, and raises on his toes before his hands curl around the metal. The angle has his hips and his arse lifted high, concaving his back into a slight dip at the reach. The creamy expanse of skin that is on display is gorgeous to behold.
“Well, now you do,” Draco replied, stepping closer, getting his first good look at the Savior in two years. Potter had changed, that much was true, but there were still traces of the Boy-Who-Lived, and it made him understand why Granger was so adamant that the old Potter still existed. He was still there, in a certain slant of light, from the mop of unruly black hair to the square of his jaw (which Draco had to admit he’d grown into), down to the faint flicker of innocence lost in the sparkle of his green eyes. But it was the overpowering sense of danger and the intriguing aura of darkness that made those old vestiges so disarming. Draco’s heart slammed in his chest with the knowledge that this Potter knew how to make those familiar traits work to his seductive advantage. No wonder he’d been biting half of Wizarding Britain. They were probably queuing for him in droves with a look like that. And now that look belonged to Draco.
She nodded thoughtfully. “Yes. Those particular potions are under strict control from the Vampire Council and the Ministry. You have to be approved to just to get on the list for permission to obtain them.”
Potter’s eyes sparkled with interest. “But what if you could? Find a Master to apprentice you, I mean? What would you do? Open your own shop?”
"If you like." That's as close to an endorsement as he's going to get for the moment, but it blossoms in his heart all the same.
Something snaps inside Harry at the noise. It's high-pitched and full of want and frustration, and it tugs at the corners of Harry's soul. The sound threatens Harry's self-control, and he wants to shuck his trousers, bury himself balls deep in Draco's arse and fuck that noise out of him until his voice is raw and ragged. In a frenzy, he attacks the globes of Draco's arse—kissing, licking, biting, sucking—over and over until Draco begins to shake uncontrollably. He bites down hard where the curve of buttock meets the inside of his thigh, where the skin is paper thin and dotted with nerve endings.
Her hand waves dismissively in the air. "I'm not concerned about the rug, Mr. Potter. What troubles me is how you ended up here with no clear destination in mind. You could have ended up anywhere."
Her heart clenched as Ron stared back at her, tears welling in the corner of his eyes. “I just want my friend back.”
"I like looking at you," he says. Harry's voice is thick and full of interest. "You have no idea how much. You're something worth watching."
As soon as he stood upright, Draco knew exactly where he was, and the breath left his body as he stared at Malfoy Manor, bathed in the distance underneath the soft shadows of moonlight.
about Owen and their failed relationship, and how it looks for the Ministry to have an Auror who engages in less than respectable sexual practices and isn't the least bit bothered by it on their payroll. He's heard the whispers. He knows what people think even if they won't say it to his face.
"Nonsense," Harry chides her with a smile. "A witch as skilled as yourself? I don't think so, Cissa. Why don't you let me get Neville Longbottom out here and take a look?"
"No, I don't plan on voicing an objection." His tone is soft and resigned. "Even if I think she's far too old and far too good for him, I can admit that his presence here has changed her state of mind for the better. If he makes her happy, all I can really do is be grateful." Draco glares at Harry's knowing grin and points a long, elegant finger at him. "However, should he make her
Potter spoke, voice hitting a low register Draco hadn't heard before, and the deep, body-shaking tone went straight to his cock. "Get naked and get up there."
Harry follows Malfoy down a maze of hallways and corridors, but his eyes can't be bothered to note the elegant surroundings of the Manor's interior chambers. His eyes are far too fixed on the way Malfoy's spine stands straight, and even more so on the curves of his arse are undulating beneath the fabric of his trousers.
“There were other charges they could have brought. But they didn’t. Why? Think about this, Harry. Really think about it. If they lumped them all together, the Ministry only gets one crack at him. Boom, he serves his time, and then they can’t touch him. But, if they hold back, only prosecute and convict one charge at a time, then Malfoy’s looking at a revolving Azkaban door for the rest of his life. He serves his seven years, he gets out, and if he even looks like he’s stepping one aristocratic toe out of line, they haul him back in and pull out another charge. There’s no statute on war crimes, and they’re still holding Dumbledore’s attempted murder and the torture charges for safekeeping. They’ve got scores of testimony and pensieve memories to corroborate. Even yours. Frankly, if he did get out, they wanted to give him enough grief that he’d just AK himself and save everyone the trouble.”
The stare is discomforting after a second or two, Harry knows, because he's perfected it, and finally Malfoy concedes.
The anger swirling in his body seeped out into his limbs and over his skin, lighting up every nerve in a deadly burn. Sweat beaded at his temples as he grew hotter and hotter, a feat only before accomplished by the sweet fire of Draco's touch.
Harry gives her a formal bow, one he's worked hard to perfect in the past few years, along with the rest of his carriage. He's found that formality and confidence work wonders outside the bedroom as well. "My sincerest apologies for the intrusion, Mrs. Malfoy. I can assure you my presence has nothing to do with the Auror department or your terms with the Ministry." He straightens and offers her a deprecating smile. "I resigned my post two days ago. I am no longer an Auror."
"She didn't tell you?" Draco's voice is filled to the brim with sarcastic astonishment. "Can't imagine why."
Potter couldn't have jerked back any harder if Draco had punched him in the face, and he took every scrap of pleasure he could at seeing Potter falter.
Draco's breath catches and he turns his face upward to look at Harry, his eyes a mixture of surprise and wonder.
"You're running. From your friends, from your guilt. From your life." Draco blew out a hard breath. "From everything." Potter swallowed, but kept silent. "Even dead, you're still running. But you won't get past it. Because it stays with you. It's part of you, like that damned scar that started it all. You can't face it. You can't face everything you lost." Draco snorted. "Wake up, Potter. You're not so special that you're the only one who lost something in this war." He took a step forward, and watched as Potter's body settled, moving unconsciously into a defensive stance.
It hits him hard, like a live wire sparking at contact, and his body jerks as he comes down Draco's throat. As orgasms go, there is no anticipation, no build-up, just the sheer, raw strike of pleasure searing through him like a match thrown into a lake of kerosene. Draco swallows and tongues at him a few more times before collapsing. His head rests on Harry's thigh, and Harry's fingers unfurl to rake through his hair in a tender caress.
Shacklebolt rose and followed her out. The Minister paused at the threshold. “It’s the only way, Ron. I’m sorry.”
Harry frowned. “What for? The Ministry’s taken everything, there can’t be anything left now.” She returned his frown with her patented ‘you’re missing the point’, look.
Draco drew himself up and sniffed with as much dignity as he could muster. "Yes, selfish. I didn't care about which side won or lost. I didn't even care if you went on only to die later," he added with a sneer. Draco's heart lurched into his throat. "But in that moment, I held your life in my hands. My word was everything. I could have been the one to deliver Harry Potter to his death. And isn't that what every devoted little Death Eater wanted? Fuck," he hissed, "do you know the kind of praise I would have received? How exalted the Malfoy name would have been?" Draco shook his head. "But I couldn't do it. Despite everything it would have bought me. I was too selfish because I loved you, because I couldn't bring myself to be the one who caused you to die." He sucked in a sharp breath and squeezed his eyes shut. "I loved you so much I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I did. Whatever happened to you from then on—win or lose, live or die— didn't matter. All that mattered was that it wasn't my doing." Draco looked up at Potter. "I loved you so much that I wasn't willing to live with my guilt. And I hated you for it. Just bloody hated you for it." He was quiet for a second. "Sometimes," he whispered, "I think I still do."
"I don't know," Harry says softly. "But I'm here, and this isn't going away. Not until we confront it."
Potter’s hand clamped down over his wrist, while the other scrabbled for purchase underneath his t-shirt, skittering across his skin to finally rest at the hollow of his waist, fingers digging in with bruising ferocity. The hold sought to keep him in place, and Draco wanted to laugh out loud at the ludicrousness of the gesture, because his body had no intention of going anywhere anytime soon. The pull of Potter’s lips on his wrist was drugging as he drank, and Draco moaned as he floated somewhere between a dizzying vortex of pleasure and pain.
"Well," he drawls, and it sends a familiar twinge of icy fingers down her spine, "I wondered how long it would take before you came to me."
, nails scratching against his scalp like it's the only place his fingers belong. Draco lets out a sort-of hiss, but the longer Harry holds him, the more the sound turns into a throaty, pleased hum of satisfaction.
Draco's tongue is moist and pink as it swipes over his bottom lip. Harry wants to suck it right out of his mouth.
Draco peeked out over Potter’s shoulder to see a smiling Granger, a set of parchments in her hand. Weasley barreled in the door after her, followed by Shacklebolt and a tall, imposing man with a stony face that could have given Severus Snape a run for his money.
Potter outlines a series of theories and connections related to this new Death Eater faction, and requests only Draco’s insight (if he has any) as the case goes on. That’s all, he promises. Just information and insight. To top it off, Potter even says that the only person he’ll have to deal with or speak to is him. No Robards, no other Aurors, no one else. Just him.
He can't feel his arm. All he can do is watch as it descends over and over and over again, wrenching lustful sobs from Draco's lungs. But it sounds like angel song. Joyous and rhythmic, with all the glory of the divine. That's what he hears, but Harry knows it's not real. It's not for him. Because how can a man drenched in so much blood ever be clean? How can a man who delights in the submission of others ever be worthy of it? How can this ever be normal?
"Speaking of which, we should get started." Neville sets his napkin on the table and pushes his chair back. He reaches for Narcissa's hand to assist her in rising. "Shall we?"
Ron stopped short in front of him, and before Draco could open his mouth to head Weasley off at the pass with a sharp reply, the ginger-haired Auror grabbed the front of his shirt and hauled him into a fierce hug. It knocked the breath from Draco’s lungs, and his arms came up to grab at Ron to steady himself.
Hermione (as she was insistent to the point of madness that Draco used her given name) appeared one morning, bright and smiling as ever, to drag him bodily from the comfort of his bed, threw clothes at his person, and slapped a cup of coffee in his hand. Her circumvention of his protests was admirable, so when she offered her arm, he took it without reservation and found himself Apparated to the manor grounds.
Harry grabs it and pulls him into a hug. "No, you daft git. But you will owe Draco an apology." Ron huffs and nods. "A sincere one."
Severus' mouth pulled into a tight line. "Less than a minute and you're giving me lip. I think that's a record." Draco opened his mouth to snark back, but Severus continued, "Have you forgiven him?"
Despite the outward appearance of obedience, Harry knows Draco is tweaked about the whole situation. He thinks it goes deeper than Draco just being a cheeky sub, especially since whatever they are to each other has yet to take shape. He's not coy, not aloof, not trying to draw Harry's attention in that way. It's not about balking against the Dom/sub dynamic. Harry doesn't even think it's about him, per se, but more about Draco's acceptance of himself. And their conversation earlier makes it perfectly clear to Harry that Draco doesn't know who or what he is, so he's relying on the self-preservation tactics he's used in the past.
First, his wandless magic is effortless. Not to mention wordless as well. It’s so unbelievably hot Draco could scream. Potter holds a hand out and a bottle of high-end lubricant flies into his outstretched fingers. Before he knows it, Potter’s teasing around the edge of his hole with a well-slicked finger. One finger slides in carefully, gentle but focused, and Draco’s breath stutters in pleasure. One becomes two, two becomes three, and then the head of Potter’s magnificent cock is breaching him, filling him up beautifully. Potter eases the rest of the way in, bottoming out on a harsh breath. His hips undulate, giving Draco three slow, maddening slides before he hitches Draco’s hips higher, leans over and proceeds to fuck Draco into the mattress.
Harry raises an eyebrow and nods in response. "Once she knows you barreled in here like a bat out of hell, flinging your wand in someone's home, someone she apparently knows rather well, I'd say yeah, you're in the shit."
"Join the club," Draco sneered. "How do you think I felt when Severus died? I loved my godfather. As much as I would imagine you loved yours. It doesn't make your loss any greater than mine."
The addition of Neville at the breakfast table five days out of seven came as no surprise to anyone, and Harry thinks the Floo between Narcissa's chambers and Hogwarts should just turn itself into a revolving door and be done with it. Either that, or just move in.
Draco lunged and pushed his face into Potter’s, ignoring the spray of water into his mouth and ear. “You need my blood, Potter! The heartbeat is just a bloody homing beacon for you. So you can come and drink your fill! So do it already!”
Harry stood his ground and said with resignation, "I'm not doing this with you, Silvestri. I warned you what would happen if you touched him."
Draco had an unconventional beauty that belied definition. His was the beauty of cherished things, beauty that lay in its intrinsic value to the soul, not of a predefined notion. Even in its perfunctory grace, Harry felt the gift of Draco's service. A gift he knew he didn't deserve.
Potter's eyes darkened with hunger as he stripped off his sleep pants, his hand coming back up to give the erect length of his cock a lazy stroke.
As soon as his feet touched the floor, Draco jerked himself out of Potter's Apparition hold, putting distance between them. He pulled off his coat with quick, violent movements, not sparing it a glance as he tossed it over the back of the sofa. Potter moved to take a step, mouth open, but Draco stopped him with a raised finger.
"I see. What, the Dom snaps his fingers, and the su—I'm just supposed kneel for you?" Draco's furious gaze cuts through to Harry, slicing over his skin. "You don't think this is pursuit? Throwing yourself at me and making me—" He stops, swallowing the last of his words.
A heartbeat passed between them and Harry didn't even have the decency to recognize Draco's capitulation until his hands shoved at his knees. Harry let his legs fall to the floor and Draco immediately worked the fly of his jeans open and shoved them to his ankles.
With that, Draco is gone, and Harry can't resist the bubble of laughter that escapes when the doors are slammed shut behind the retreating blond.
"You don't know everything," Draco said flatly. "But I know that you killed the Dark Lord and died on your way to doing it. I realize that's enough to fuck up any sane person, but we both know you were already broken before you struck him down. I think the question here is, how badly?" He stepped forward again, causing Potter to jerk, but he didn't move. "I think you knew you were going to die. I think you were prepared for it. After all, Dumbledore had been grooming you to play the hero and the martyr all along." Draco's lips pursed as he shook his head in pity. "A shame you had to believe your own hype to make it happen."
Malfoy's smile goes a bit firmer. "Tinky decided she wanted to wear nothing but tutus and for us to call her 'Cook'. Because that's what she does, she says. She 'cooks'. I know, it's all a bit weird, but honestly, she's an outright menace if she doesn't get her way."
Two fingers became three and Draco thought he would lose what was left of his mind. Potter moved faster now, both with his cock and his hand, and the brief moment of gentleness was gone. He was finger-fucking him now with abandon, and Draco’s arms fell away to brace on the tile once more as he succumbed.
Lucius stands, unfurling himself from the chair, no doubt to tower above her. As if the portrait isn't already high enough on the wall. No pedestal is ever too high for Lucius Malfoy.
It was sometime later that he awoke to the tingle of the wards he'd placed outside his room. Draco lifted his head from the pillow and pointed his wand at the door. The door rippled and melted away, allowing Draco to see the other side. Potter lay curled up on his side, almost in the door frame, his fingers making absent trails against the grain of the floor. After an hour, Potter still hadn't moved, and Draco went back to sleep.
He could feel Potter’s distress returning, and knew that the comfort of his blood wouldn’t be enough to drive out the vampire’s demons so easily. And while he wanted, because Merlin, yes, he wanted, it was Potter’s pleasure he sought. Draco’s hand journeyed around Potter’s torso, sliding across the hard planes of his stomach, and Potter sucked in a harsh breath, no doubt realizing his destination. Draco let his fingers trail slowly, teasing with the pads of his fingers as they slid across sweat-slick skin that was tense with anticipation.
Draco's head jerks back and he howls, and Harry can see the drops of moisture that have leaked from his cock onto the floor. His balls are drawn up tight against his body, and Harry dips his head to snake his tongue out to dart over them. The rattling chains grow louder, because now Draco's trembling at every point of restraint. The line of his body is taut, defining the outline of long, lean muscle.
Ron held the door wide, allowing Potter to step through. "Come in, then." He scratched the back of his head and split his gaze between Draco and the vampire. "I'll leave you to it, shall I?"
Unbidden, he found himself drifting to his feet and crossing the small room to sit as requested. Before he could open his mouth to speak, she unfurled the parchment and shoved it across the table. “I’ll get straight to the point,” she said, tapping her forefinger on the scroll. “I’m here about Harry.”
Draco bites back a small gasp and his arms flex. Harry has no doubt his fingers are curling into his palms behind his back.
Draco held his left hand, palm up, for Potter. "The crypt has more complex warding. It requires fresh blood." He wiggled his fingers. "If you could, please?"
Harry stands up from his chair and moves to Draco's side, placing his right hand on the back of Draco's chair, and his left on the table next to Draco's. Close enough to touch, but Harry doesn't, because the boundaries of touch have yet to be liberated. He chooses to answer the question by not answering it.
He can calculate the time it takes for Malfoy's expression to wane back into a mask in mere seconds. It's a start. A small one, but a start all the same.
"I know." Potter's voice was subdued. "I kept my distance to hold onto the moment, but I've learned the tighter I hold onto what is, I lose my grip on what could be. And in hanging onto that, I lost everything entirely. The past, the present, the future. You." Draco watched a fine tremor work its way over Potter's body. "I didn't want to love you because I didn't want to have something precious and then lose it. I had lost so much, Draco. I couldn't afford to lose anymore."
He feels a little like a shark as he approaches—shiny gray suit and cunning smile that's all teeth and deadly confidence. He knows he's slick as fuck when he sidles up to Draco and slides an arm around Draco's waist like there's a waiting space shaped just like Harry's arm.
"I mean it, who in their right mind wants to end up bare-arsed on this tragic excuse for fabric? It's an affront to everything I hold dear," Draco protested. Potter hauled him up with a gleam of fond exasperation.
“Good,” she said, rising to her feet. Leaning over to press a kiss to the top of Ron’s head, she smiled. “It’s late. And I’m tired. You boys catch up.”
“Silvestri is right,” Kingsley Shacklebolt replied from his seat across the table. “The Ministry and the Vampire Council have come to an agreement. Either Harry does this, or we turn him back over to the Council for punishment. As he is one of theirs, their rights trump ours.” The Minister let out a heavy sigh. “And even if they didn’t, I can’t see Harry’s fate turning out better with the Ministry.”
"With all due respect, Mrs. Malfoy, I don't see how that's possible." Harry's holding back a bark of incredulous laughter, because her suggestion is ludicrous.
Harry straightens, but not too much, just enough to put a calming, yet confident vibe out between them that, if Harry's instincts are right, will instantly get a response from Malfoy. It's the sort of stance he's used in the past that never fails to soothe and pacify. It's a stance that radiates safety and control, one that tells the sub that Harry's got everything under control and there's no need to worry. It incites trust on a subconscious level, and it's a specialty of Harry's.
, pulling his body tight, making it bow under the strain. The whispered praise keeps coming, dulcet and delicious, and it hits Draco so hard because, yes, he wants to be good, yes, he wants to be perfect, wants to be all of the honeyed things Potter says he is. It fills him with such satisfaction that Draco decides the next time they do this (Merlin, please) he wants to ride Potter so hard he cries.
Draco nodded as Potter's words failed him. "I do, Merlin fuck me twice, I do. But I can see that you are either unequivocally incapable or unwilling to love me back, despite how much you desire me." He paused, taking a moment. "I—I thought it would be enough, you know." Draco sniffed again and raised his eyes to Potter's. "But it isn't. I see that now."
Potter sidestepped him, and Draco noticed he was shirtless. "I mean it; I told you that I was planning on doing it anyway. It's just that my lack of self-control upped the timeline a little. I wanted a bit longer to get things together, but that didn't happen. It worked out, though."
Draco's smile faded a bit. "Well, I didn't sign up for the Severus Snape life-coaching course, so I'm afraid potions will have to suffice."
“Do you actually eat?” Draco asked between delicate bites, silently blessing the house-elf for having above average cooking skills. “Or are you on a strictly liquid Malfoy diet?”
Weasley stepped forward and offered him his hand. Draco took it and smiled as they shook hands. “I’m still going to call you ‘Ferret’, you know. Old habits.”
Ron rubbed a hand over his face. “I mean, he was never going to really be free. You why he was only tried on the one charge? Of letting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts?”
They walk out of the room and Harry turns back to shut the doors, his eyes finding the incredulous Slytherin. "Goodnight, Draco. Sleep well."
They've almost reached the clearing where the greenhouse stands alone, wide and high among the grounds, and yes, Neville's gait has most certainly faltered. The slow pace gives her more time to realize how solid he is next to her. Solid. Strong. Unyielding.
Once they've gone a few steps, Draco somehow reverses the hold Harry has on his arm, and is now the one doing the tugging. He drags Harry off into a shadowed back alcove and shoves him against the wall. Draco's mouth is on his before he can get a word out.
“And what about a man? The light scratch of stubble against your cheek, perhaps? Deeper, breathier moans, the feel of hard muscle beneath you. The weight of a cock in your hand? The taste of it in your mouth?”
Harry steps to the side and ushers Neville forward. "Here, come in. Narcissa, Draco, may I present Neville Longbottom."
The admission was startling, and Draco had to blink to process the import of Potter's words. As it sunk in, it made sense: this room was Potter's sanctuary. He was safe here. And Potter wanted to share it with him.
Harry's hands slide down the frame as he goes. The only part of him that touches Draco is his lips, and Draco's taste burns on his tongue like sweet fire. Draco's scent and taste swirl around his head in a fog, and Harry has to close his eyes and take a deep breath to keep his focus. His tongue swipes a lazy figure just over Draco's tailbone, slow and methodical, and when he presses it flat over the top of his crack, Draco lets out a keening wail.
To reach for Harry is to reach for his own happiness. On whatever terms Harry sees fit. Draco has to either accept that, and place all his trust in Harry, or live with the regret he knows will certainly follow if he doesn't.
"And so you killed him, just like you were supposed to, but I don't think you expected to survive. It must have been disappointing when you did, because now you had to face what your life would become post-AK. What was left for you, eh? What was left for the Savior of the Wizarding World? An Order of Merlin? An Auror post? What? What was left for you?" He paused, taking in the pallor of Potter's face at his words. "I'll tell you what was left. Guilt. So much guilt you wanted to drown in it, didn't you?"
Harry steps back and reaches for the buckle at Draco's left wrist. He unfastens it and takes Draco's hand. Harry turns his hand over and brushes a sweet kiss on the palm before guiding it beneath the waistband of his trousers. He places Draco's hand over his spent cock and squeezes.
Something in his tone gets Draco's attention because his eyes snap to Harry's, heated and full of interest. His lips curl, and it makes the tightness in Harry's groin unravel and snake through to his spine.
“I don’t know about that, Ron.” Harry’s hand curled reflexively to ease the sudden tension that crept into his fingers.
"I was thinking of painting." Harry is horrified as the words tumble out. He wants to say something else, something that doesn't sound completely mental, but he's stopped by Mrs. Malfoy's warm smile.
"Alright, alright!" she said furiously, putting a hand on her lips. She drew a deep breath to steady herself. "I promised Draco I wouldn't say anything, but a couple of days ago, he went to Knockturn to set up an account for potions supplies and such. While he was there, there was," she paused, "an altercation."
Draco went still beneath him, managing his fear to slow his breathing to a deep and even cadence. The fingers that were digging into Potter’s cheek flattened, and he began tap.
Draco sighs and throws his head back. "Harry Potter had nothing to do with my choice to see Blaise."
Draco shoved his hands in the mess of Potter's hair, delighting in the silkiness of the perpetually disheveled locks, fingers curling as though his skin might absorb the texture to memory. Potter moved them in the direction of the bed, Draco guessed, but he couldn't be bothered to open his eyes and check. There was a scrape of fangs just below his ear, and the dart of a slick tongue that licked over the little hollow there, and really, nothing else seemed to matter. Potter could have been turning them in circles, and Draco would have been content to revolve forever.
Draco watched with clear, focused eyes as Harry and Silvestri collided in midair. They fell to the ground with a thud and sprang apart, circling warily, wandlessly casting and deflecting a number of curses. He shifted within the confines of his barrier, able to move only a fraction. Draco frowned. He was well and truly corralled; there was no way he could get out to help Potter.
"I should have killed you a long time ago," she says evenly. Lucius only snorts in response. "But I didn't. You earned your reprieve with one simple act. You gave me Draco." Her smile is cruel. "You owe him your life. You owe that boy everything."
Draco struggled to his feet to meet Potter's face. The cuts and contusions he suffered at Silvestri's hands smoothed and evened out right before Draco's surprised eyes. Before he could manage a word, Potter's arms pulled him into a tight embrace, and the familiar pull of Apparition took over.
Draco shoved that particular thought down and remembered himself. He gestured to the sofa. "Have a seat."
Her eyes fluttered to the hand at her shoulder, and she waved it carelessly as if she had forgotten its existence. “Oh, yes. Ron and I married last year.”
“Think about this rationally, Ron,” Hermione pleaded. “If he takes a Consort, a willing one, and binds himself to them, he will no longer be able to feed off anyone else. He can’t. He may not like it, but at least he’ll be alive.”
Harry stopped short at the edge of the table, frozen by the chilled venom in Draco's voice. He placed his palm on the table for support. "I was in my room."
Her lips curl and her lashes lower demurely. "Possibly. Or maybe it's that I know my son as well as you know Harry. They've danced around in one way or another since the moment they met. Perhaps it's time they finally came together."
Harry unfurls his arm from behind Draco to menace forward and stare Zabini down. "Listen very carefully to what I'm about to say, because I'm only going to say it once. Leave Britain. Now, while you still can. Because there is nothing here for you. There is no circle that will welcome you, no establishment that will serve you. My name carries weight in places you cannot fathom, and from the moment you arrived, the word spread. You are
"How wonderful. We have a studio. I'm sure you'll find it more than adequate for your needs." Her eyes are entreating. "Please…stay."
Narcissa keeps her husband's furious gaze as the frost in her voice turns glacial. "The portrait, Blinky."
Harry's eyes shoot to Draco's face. His head is turned to the side so he can breathe through his mouth. The green silk is still in place, and his hands are white-knuckled on the handles. There is a visible tremble to his grasp.
Draco stepped into the bathroom and had to hold onto the door handle to keep from falling to his knees and praising Merlin for his mercy.
Her head dropped, and for a second he thought she might actually be crying, but when her eyes lifted, she had managed to restrain them. Tiny sparkles welled in her brown eyes, and the effort she exuded to hold them back was tremendous. Granger’s lip quivered. “He’s-Malfoy, he’s hurt people. Feeding without consent, Turning people against their will. It’s getting worse. Two days ago, he almost killed a man in Chelsea. Practically ripped his throat out. The Vampire Council was on the verge of declaring him rogue, and he was wanted by the Ministry.” Her hands came together and slid across the table as if to reach for him. “If he doesn’t take a Consort, they’ll execute him.”
"But we sat down after Par—Pansy, I'm supposed to call her Pansy now—left. We talked about it, and it was different afterward than we thought. It was, I dunno,
"Finally, a declaration of love and you give it to Weasley instead of me," Draco scoffed. "I should be insulted, Potter."
Harry turns off the taps and leads Draco out of the shower, toweling him dry with slow motions, conscious of Draco's every breath and sigh. Harry's soaking wet but he doesn't care, only managing a half-hearted Drying charm on his own clothes. It's Draco's comfort he's concerned with.
"It's not that simple, Mother." Draco shakes his head and leans forward, casting his eyes to the floor.
"Yes," she continues. "I thought we might have a small dinner party tomorrow evening. Just close friends." Her eyes sharpen on Draco. "Pansy's in from America."
Snape's head swiveled toward him with a black glare. "Everything affects the outcome of your grade."
"Then how the bloody fucking hell did you get through the wards, Potter?" Malfoy's voice is a barely controlled growl.
Regret and shame fell heavy on Potter's shoulders, and he stepped back further, as if distance would mitigate Draco's ire.
Neville steps forward and reaches for her hand as she straightens. She offers it, and Neville bows formally. "It is you who honor me, Lady Malfoy. And please, call me Neville." His voice is low and deferential, and full of warmth.
“Shit!” Draco yelled, stumbling back to hit the wall. He pressed a hand over his heart to calm himself as Potter stood there and stared. “For fuck’s sake, Potter! What’s the matter with you?” Water beat down on him as he sputtered and Potter’s eyes roved over him, naked and prone.
"It's alright, Draco." Narcissa puts a hand on her son's arm. "Blinky wouldn't have directed him there if—"
"Nah," Ron waves him off. "I've got my own Slytherin to deal with now. And Pansy and Draco are still tight. So I imagine it's going to be a flat-out riot from now on." He shakes Harry for good measure. "Think about it—Hermione, Pansy,
Narcissa's straighter in her chair than Malfoy and a worried pinch steals across her lips. "I don't know, Harry. I would hate for him to visit and feel uncomfortable. The Manor has left its mark on so many in one way or another. I don't wish to reopen old wounds."
Draco turns to look at him with apprehensive eyes, and it makes Harry want to drag Blaise Zabini back to England by his bollocks.
The deflection was intentional, and Draco wondered exactly how much wiser Potter had gotten in the last three months.
“Honestly, Harry. Put yourself in his place. He’s been in prison, his father is dead, his mother killed herself, and he’s tied himself to you. Now he’s free and he has to put all of that into some sort of perspective. Do you think he wants to be alone to try and do that?” She shook her head. “He may not ask, or let on, but if it were you, wouldn’t you want some support? For heaven’s sake, the man needs some closure!”
The wards rippled as they walked into the boundary of the property, the familiar magic thrumming over Draco's skin in a long, forgotten way. It pulsed the same as Potter passed through.
Draco’s hand came up to rub absently at his chest in response. Potter noticed the gesture and stepped forward, taking Draco’s hand. His fingers were light and cool, and Potter’s thumb rubbed over his flesh almost like a caress as he turned it over and placed the wand in his palm. Magic tingled on his skin, and told himself it was the wand recognizing him after all this time. It certainly couldn’t be from Potter’s touch.
Draco inhales sharply and huffs out through his nose. "Then I choose yes. I choose to commit myself into your hands."
Before he could reply, a gentle knock came from the door and Potter stuck his head in. “Draco, Molly would like to speak with you if you’re done. She’s outside on the back patio.”
It's hard enough to keep her thoughts straight in the hot heaviness of the air, much less without having to stare at his perfectly-shaped backside. His shirt clings to the toned musculature of his back and upper arms, leaving no doubt that he keeps himself in shape. The white cotton t-shirt is damp in patches where the heat has gotten to him as well, and the hem has risen with his movements to settle just above his waistband, revealing a dark, inky something against the tan of his skin.
He looks down at Draco, whimpering and writhing, humping against the table's edge. He sees only beauty, only freedom. Surrender in abandon. Things he knows he doesn't deserve. Fashioned by prophecy, there is blood on his hands, and pain is the only gift he has to give. Tears leak into the corner of his eyes, and he blinks them back, never halting the cadence of the crop. It whistles through the air, smacking against flesh that gives and
"I know what a parachute is," Harry replies with a small smile. "Very well, parachute it is. That will be my safeword as well."
is all about." His eyes narrow and the point of his chin thrusts out as he continues, "And here you are, half-naked,
. Every other pass grazed over a spot that whited out his vision, pulling pleasure up from his toes to coil in a heated mass at the base of his spine. Over the buzz in his brain, the sounds of sex echoed in the room like a dark symphony. Wet, filthy noises, the tell-tale slap of skin on skin, and the harsh, jagged breathing of two men on the precipice of desire.
"Muggle clothes," she blurts out, unable to resist the sparkle of mirth she sees. "Jeans, specifically." She thinks she should be horrified at her own outburst, but Neville chuckles, and the low rumble entreats her traitorous mouth to continue. "And I have a pair of 'flip-flops', I think they're called. They have horrendous little sparkly things all over them." She wrinkles her nose and then smiles. "I absolutely adore them. I think if Draco ever saw them, he'd die of apoplexy."
Ron’s shoulders drooped and he pitched forward to put his head in his hands. “I don’t even want to know who you have in mind, do I?” he murmured.
"Tell that to the heaps of luggage under your eyes. You look positively dreadful." The other man's tone is jovial, but Harry hears the undertone of worry it carries. This man cares for Draco.
Draco gasps for air, his chest is rising and falling like a bellows, his heart is racing, and his pulse is pounding in his ears. Potter continues his merciless assault, mapping out every line, dip, and hollow he can get his mouth and hands on. Touches and teases come from everywhere and Draco can’t wrap his head around exactly what’s happening. The need to touch Potter is fierce, so Draco bats Potter’s hand away and replaces it with his own, circling his fingers around Potter’s dripping erection. Potter grunts like the sound has been punched from his lungs, a short, deep exhalation that makes his pupils blow wide. Potter throws his head back and Draco attacks his neck, memorizing the taste of Potter’s skin on his tongue. He bites at the juncture of neck and shoulder, teeth pressing in a way that’s sure to leave a mark. His tongue laves over the bite, soothing it before sucking again. This must flip a switch somewhere within Potter because he comes absolutely unglued, and Draco realizes two things about Potter he’s never known before.
