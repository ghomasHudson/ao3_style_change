“Oh hey” Ron mumbled at him shyly, looking a tad awkward from his presence, Harry quirked an eyebrow at him “what's wrong?”
AARRGHHH FINALLY I FINISHED THIS CHAPTER!! This one honestly took so long to write! Eventually it got too long so I had to cut it in half:( but here's a 9.7 k update for all you patient souls!
“Because they don't belong here!” Ron said, suddenly bumping into a little Slytherin, he looked like a second year, he definitely heard what Ron had said because his head dropped apologetically, tears already streaming down his face as he ran past them
It was an another set of footsteps that woken Draco from his daze,his eyes fixating in a tall figure, eyes widening, Draco almost choked, Longbottom was standing right in front of him, something wrapped up tightly in his hand, it looked like he arched his back and poofed out his chest, since he looked much taller than Draco remembered, his eyes scared and uncertain, but equally determined.
Small feet padded through the empty halls, reflecting upon the smooth marble. Draco felt incredibly tiny with the high ceilings accompanied by wall length paintings of his ancestors, or so he was told. Watching him quietly with their ice cold eyes, but Draco was too excited to fear them right now. He let his memory lead him down the dim lit halls until he reached a dark wooden door with a soft line of light seeping from under it. Getting on his tiptoes Draco reached for the handle, pushing the cold metal softly as the warmth of the room enveloped him.
"..yeah." the blond sighed, looking down at him with dizzy eyes. Harry kept his gaze there, not caring for any possible first year that might pass through. If someone sees, they'd better enjoy the sight, since what Harry was doing now was claiming what's his. And everyone in school should know it. Know that only he can make Draco look this disheveled, his lips swollen from the time Harry pulled them between his teeth, hair messy because he ran his hand through platinum locks. Who would've known, that the look of hatred the blond once sent his way could bloom into such softness.
“I will” he said, feeling like it's a promise he can't keep.

“As you may already noticed, this room is filled with Portraits of all the previous Hogwarts headmasters”  McGonagall smiled at him, already getting up from her seat “he'd like to see you, I'm getting tired of this bitter old man really”
Draco leaped out of his seat, still unsure of how to feel, followed the woman through the room nonetheless, and there he was, right in the corner, his greasy long hair and boring expression just like he remembered, McGonagall’s hand pushed him closer softly, nodding at him before leaving them alone.
We can flee the country and be a happy family again.

“Oh don't worry about that! You're a lost case anyway you fucking moron!” Potter yelled, kicking the floor angrily before storming out of the toilet leaving Draco alone with his misery, he stared at the now empty marble floor thunderstruck, slowly his face winced in pain “fuck!!” He exclaimed, hitting his head on the wall, completely leaning on it, he opened his eyes wide staring at the high ceiling, his vision becoming blurry as tears flood his eyes, the white ceiling suddenly gained black dots Draco gazed at them and groaned “not you again” he buried his face into his knees, hugging himself, quietly sobbing as a new batch of creatures surrounded him.
“I didn't even say anything!” She exclaimed, and Pansy snickered besides her. “That's it, we're making pie.” This time, Weasley was the one to react, finally lifting his head from his plate while chewing a mouthful of pie “huh? What're we duin?” He asked, and Draco flinched with disgust, don't they teach them manners in the Weasley house? Hermione didn't mind, patting her boyfriend on the back “we will sneak into the kitchen! The house elves love me there, I'm sure they'll help.” Draco had to say one or two things about this situation. first, why the hell would they sneak into a kitchen swarming with house elves? Second, by the way both Potter and Weasley looked at her, Draco found it hard to believe that house elves actually like her, more like the opposite if he were to talk.  “Oh cool!” Weasley said after he finally swallowed, everyone else didn't seem as excited. “Well... there's no need for a thousand of people to make pie so….” Pansy said, casually sliding off her seat “yeah.” Blaise blurted out, standing up and leaving as if he never sat there, when Draco was about to do the same, he was unlucky being within arm reach of the woman, who immediately grappled him and pushed him down to his seat. “Well then, more pie for us.” Hermione smiled sweetly, and Draco already regretting his choice of friends.
Thank you for reading my story for a whole year! I love you guys and hope you enjoy this fluffy chapter <3
Draco had mixed feelings about Minerva McGonagall, but she brought him back, so he should be grateful? He wasn't sure anymore
"Was it- was it the kiss? I'm not taking it back, besides you're the one that started it so you can't just go and avoid me like that." Harry glared, noticing how the taller boy seemed smaller against his frustrated tone. "So if you are angry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or harass you or whatever your Slytherin brain made out of the whole ordeal-"
And as the green twisted in hate and turned, Draco turned into a little boy again. Rushing back home where he knew a mighty storm awaits him.
you.”
Draco's eyes widened with disbelief, talk to Snape? How? He was dead-
“So, how is your school year going?” Draco sipped his own tea,a lame attempt to avoid the question in a polite way, but her gaze was terrifying, as if she could read Draco like an open book, she already knew the answer she was searching for “why do you ask?” his words turning into a quiet mumble under her gaze,he coughed uncomfortably “i mean, studying and stuff” her sharp eyed never left him, as if she was slowly but surely peeling his defense in order to see what she wants to see “is that what you really think?” that question caught him off guard, she sighed “we can skip the talk, i know the weather outside is nice, so how about you tell me while you’ve been skipping all your classes” Swallowing hard, Draco spoke “you made a mistake bringing me back”  he wasn't sure what about this sentence was so painful, but it was, he knew that already, yet saying it out loud felt like making it real
“Way to go Ron.” Hermione groaned “wha- I didn't mean him! I meant- I meant them!” He pointed at the eighth year Slytherins shamelessly
What do you do when you face a shattered soul? How do you help someone after being one yourself?
Harry tried to recall all their years together, Malfoy had always been there, when he first entered diagon alley or when he faced Voldemort, he was just there.
The other creatures were all different, like a bunch of misshapen  animals, so different yet they all cling to Malfoy
see them, why him? why now? the nails digging into his skin now were his, as he dug them deeper and deeper into his palm, seeing his knuckles go white, hoping that maybe some pain may help him wake up
Harry tensed up at the sight, Draco Malfoy, a former death eater, was walking uncomfortably between the glaring crowd
“I- I almost killed Dumbledore I- I let death eaters inside of Hogwarts!” His words escaped quicker than he thought about them, feeling the weight increasing on his back
I started listening to Mitski can you tell? I feel like my writing became more poetic I think.
in order to function like a normal human being?” Draco said, his voice groggy from the sleep he never reached thanks to a certain someone. But Potter didn't answer his remark like he usually does, instead, he repeated his question:
If you want to get into the full crying mood, try listening to these songs as related to this chapter:
Without saying a word, Longbottom flopped down right besides him, pushing his knees closer to his chest, Draco gaped at him confusion clear on his face, when he opened up his mouth to speak, Longbottom cut him off
“What?”
"You slept like dead mate! When did you return from Hogsmeade?" His best friend stood over his bed with what looked like arms folded over his chest. Ginger head blurring together with all the reds and golds of the Gryffindor house. "Huh? Um.." Harry rubbed his eyes lazily, he really did sleep well, his whole body was thrumming with excitement he hadn't felt in years. "Not too late.. just after curfew I think.." he mumbled, now busy with searching for his glasses. "Now when I think of it..I hadn't seen you at all yesterday" Neville frowned from the room's entrance, one hand already on the door handle.
it did, a memory so distant yet so real,  there to follow him with every step.
“Are you okay?” The Gryffindor whimpered, his whiny demeanor making Draco's blood boil, so he pushed him, hard. “ Fuck off!” He yelled, Ignoring Longbottom’s cry of pain as he fell on the ground, Draco ran, blurry doors and corridors leading him somewhere, somewhere safe
"Really?" His frown deepened, lifting his hands from the keys to inspect them, they looked like completely average hands to him. "Yes! You have very beautiful hands Draco, they're meant to do wonderful things."
He was falling him, Draco closed his eyes in hope to miss it, the thud of his body crashing against the ground. He wished he didn't hear it, wished that the sounds of piano were strong enough.
“I love you like… like...er…” Ron's terrified eyes ran around their surroundings, looking for something to compare it to “....like a table…?” He said in a squeaky voice, not facing his own girlfriend, Harry deadpanned, he could've chose anything, but he chose to compare his love for his significant other to a table.
The thing didn't seem to be attacking him, it was just glaring intensely at him, making his whole ride utterly uncomfortable.
I Want You- Mitski
“They definitely have a negative effect on the people around them, that could be a clue”
Potter frowned at him, his dark eyebrows barely seen though his mess of a hair, yet his expression clear as day: disgust, discomfort, all the disses you could think of, all found their way into Potter face “shut it Malfoy”  his hand was leaning heavily on his hip,his intense green eyes burning Draco's pale skin, making him wonder why he felt so ashamed all of the sudden,so little under Potter's all knowing gaze, they glared at each other, not daring to say a thing but oh- Draco forgot, the Gryffindor house is all about daring! and running his life of course
Me appearing half a year late with an another 9.7 K chapter before I vanish again? It's more likely than you think.
Draco smiled, placing his fingers on the keys once again, he was determined back then. Determined to do wonderful things. He played the notes, but something was off about them, they kept spiraling down. He closed his eyes to concentrate, opening them when he was much older, standing on top of the astronomy tower. He looked down at his hands, his beautiful hands. They were not playing music, but holding a wand instead. Pointed at a man with kind eyes, why is he smiling? Doesn't he understand the meaning of the deadly curse on his lips? Seconds away from staining his hands with killing his headmaster. He wanted to drop it, wanted to get back to that room in the manor with his mother, she had so many songs to teach him. How can he play now? He will stain their piano red. But he couldn't stop, not now. His family was waiting for him to succeed, their lives were in his hands now.
“What are you doing?” Parkinson’s voice cold as she sneers at the hand, her eyes trailing on Hermione's features suspiciously
“Last year” McGonagall’s voice broke the chatter “was hard for all of us, but even when the darkness seemed to overthrow us, none of you lost hope” her eyes reflected the thousands of students with pride, she tightened her grip on the glass “we lost many, and it's still hard” Harry  saw Ron flinch in the corner of his eye,Hermione pulling his closer  “but today, you all are no longer war heroes, you're no longer victims, here, at Hogwarts, you can be just children, just my precious students”  McGonagall placed her glass on the teacher’s table before pulling her wand out
Getting out of bed was an easy task. Harry's step was easy with hope and excitement, almost as if he had just woken up to a Christmas morning at the Burrow. Awaiting presents from the only family he had ever known. Ron kept giving him these looks, which Harry easily ignored. It was easy with his good mood. When he reached for his cologne his best mate scrunched his nose "it's Malfoy isn't it" he said, giving him a tired look from where he was seated on his bed. "What? No" Harry said, his smile giving him away. "It's definitely Malfoy! You hadn't touched this bottle ever since Hermione gave it to you last Christmas!" Ron said, pointing at the slightly dusty bottle in his hand, Harry simply shrugged and sprayed himself, coughing slightly from the sharp smell. "I do use it, on occasion"
He had been hit with a sudden cold all the air jumping out of his lungs from the surprise, it wasn't even that deep, even worse, even through his closed eyes Harry knew his forehead hit the soft ground underwater, putting his hands if front of his chest Harry pushed himself up gasping loudly. His vision was blurry, shit, his glasses must've slid off him in the water, he blindly moved his hands in the water searching for the well known circular frames, when he found them, he dragged them out of the water right on his nose. After taking a few quick breaths analyzing what hell had just happened, Harry jerked his face in Malfoy's direction “what the fuck?!” He exclaimed, trying to get on his feet only to fall back down into the cold water with a loud splash. Malfoy had the
With a flick of her wand, two tea cups flew gracefully towards the headmistress's table, landing with a soft thud. “Do sit down, I would like to chat with you” she said, sitting down in her big chair, nodding he sat down himself, staring at his cup of tea Instead, McGonagall took her time before speaking, she casually sipped her tea and then placed it on the wooden table softly
He was angry, too angry to care why.
I had always headcannoned that Draco can play the piano, it only suits him right??? The song used is a song called "Home" from the RWBY soundtrack, it's super beautiful and the moment I heard it I imagined this scene, here's a link if you want to hear it!
“Stop it Ron" Hermione said, smiling anyway, unlike Harry and Ginny,  Ron and Hermione didn't break up, their love was so intense Harry could sculpt it into the most beautiful art piece, sharp but steady, just like their relationship
What did he do to deserve this kindness? Nothing, Draco’s done nothing in his life to deserve that, not from Potter, not from Longbottom, not from Pansy nor anyone else,how is that during his lowest points, kindness just comes to him? After a while of quiet sobbing Longbottom simply left, he had nothing to do with Draco anyway, yet he felt so devastated, so angry, he didn't even manage to thank him, to apologise.
It's okay for him to at least try.
It left uncomfortable warmth on his right shoulder, Draco was sure he could feel little claws cling into him, so while Pansy was rambling sweet nothings, Draco dared to take a look.
They broke up after the war, both understanding they were too hurt, too damaged to care about relationships right now, but this break up made a beautiful friendship bloom, and Harry was all about strong female friends.
“Don't be dramatic, apple is not a someone.”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POoeN5v2U6Y&feature=share
Harry adored this softness, craved it. So he claimed it. Pulling him back into his embrace, his tongue exploring Draco's warmth hungrily, like yesterday wasn't enough. Like his whole life he'd been drowning in water and now he was breathing him. His smell, his hair, the press of his hipbone against Harry's hip. Draco gasped, shivering a soft breath against his cheek as Harry pulled him closer, his knee keeping him trapped against the wall, resting sturdily between his thighs.
But he didn't. Instead, Draco slid off his bed silently, bare feet tapping on the cold floor as he made his way to the bathroom. Harry could see it now, how the bundle of Solus seems a bit smaller, with two of its compatriots gone the rest seems more challenging, as if they're ready to hold onto Draco until his death, keeping the boy from letting them bloom.
"He does?" His eyebrows shot up, he wished he didn't react this way. Since his best friend bursted into a fit of hysterical laughter. "Merlin Harry you're thick, are you? When you're not staring at him for once, the bloke sends you very subtle, but curious glances. It's more of a circus really." Draco looks at him, was all Harry could hear or care about. "..huh" he said, holding his tie between his fingers, his gaze lingering there. "You have it so, so bad Harry" he groaned, falling back on his back dramatically. "Better skip this morning, or else you won't keep it in your pants and start snogging in the middle of the classroom."
She clapped her hands together, humming “great! I need a tad of help with carrying some text books, could you help me young gentleman?” he was startled from her question, lifting his gaze before looking down again “uh-yeah sure” he said, a bit uncertainly.
“Surely doesn't look like it" Ron elbowed his side exchanging mischievous looks with Hermione, Harry completely ignored them
A death eater.
Solus swirled back and forth on his back, and Draco felt like he couldn't watch this scene any longer. He thought about saying 'i'm sorry’ again, but he couldn't, Longbottom wouldn't take half assed apologies, and Draco, well, he was no worthy of telling a heartfelt one either.
“Well that won't be the first time” Luna tilted her head, her earrings tangling freely “do you think it's bad?”
Oh! And I did laser surgery on my eyes, so I am no longer nerfed by god.
“Are you free, Mr. Malfoy?” She asked, her expression unreadable, it seems like she didn't notice Draco talking to the creatures, which is good, he wouldn't want to explain why he was talking to himself to an already sceptical headmistress. He nodded, not saying anything, fixating his gaze on her pointy heels instead, somehow it's hard to face her, like he knows he's done something bad
Still here. Draco thought.
What do heroes become after finishing their task?
Solus, that might be a lead.
“It's very common in the muggle world to cover up scars or old tattoos.” Potter cut him off. “They don't know who he is, they would think you were in some kind of emo phase or something, seriously, they won't bat an eye.” Draco couldn't form proper words, a pureblood getting tattooed by a muggle? In what world would that happen? Potter is mental, absolutely mental. “It's without Magic, so I don't think it will activate some sort of trap.” Potter insisted, his hand now squeezing Draco's arm tightly. Draco grunted uncomfortably, looking down at his mark, could that really be covered up? By muggles no less?
Draco couldn't ignore the weight climbing on his leg, why are those things so heavy? and why do they cling to Draco? It seemed like Blaise didn't notice them just like Pansy.
And it seems like Malfoy was tired of it too, or perhaps he simply didn't dare to approach Harry after what he did, Malfoy may be a coward, but he has a brain.
But what could he see that only Malfoy saw? that thought followed Harry through his day, maybe it was his thirst for mystery, but Harry found himself staring at Malfoy during magical history, this time there were three, one black creature sitting on his shoulder, the second one on his head, and the third one- the cat like black blob that has been attached to him the longest, has been nagging his hand, just them being there felt pretty annoying,he wondered how Malfoy hadn’t snapped already.
someone who treated her badly, honestly sometimes Harry is shocked how kind Hermione can get
! and I personally do not want to return there!” People were dropping their gaze, anyone would find it more soothing to face the floor than the all mighty Potter, the one who defeated him who must not be named, deep down, everyone knew he was right
And as he stepped into the well known train, his back started to feel heavy.
Be prepared for some fluffff after all the pain they (and you) deserve it.
“Draco..?” His attention snapped back to his friend, who gaped at him, and she wasn't the only one, seemed like the whole great hall stared at him, his eyes locked on a certain someone
Entering dinner with his face red and swollen might not have been a good idea, but he still did it.
Enjoy this chapter :)
“How dare you!” A loud thud echoed across the hall, the trio turned around, all Harry could see were colors, yellow, red and blue, all looking at the same scene: red, red dripping down a green robe, red dripping down a pale chin
“Ugh- fine I'll think about it it.. or something.” He exclaimed, yanking his arm from Potter's grasp and turning over so his back would face the git, he pulled his covers back over himself, his cheeks heating up in a very much annoying manner.
“He taught me, in the only was he saw acceptable.” Malfoy said, his voice bitter. But that makes no sense, ever since they were little Draco always bragged about how great his father was, Lucius Malfoy, a great wizard in Malfoy's eyes, the one who bought him the newest brooms and the best robes, a man so dark yet his only son still admired him, no abused person would ever brag about their abuser, right?
Malfoy got up slowly and Parkinson jumped to his side in panic crying quick words Harry couldn't overhear, Draco nodded at her and made his way to the exit, suddenly tripping and falling
“I will go now” he whispered, letting his hands fall, she squeezed once more before letting go, suddenly leaving Draco feeling cold
"Wingardium Laviosa." He said, his voice a bit shaky. But just as it did under his covers, the quill rattled slightly before lifting gently in the air. "It is not perfect, of course." Draco said, turning to his father with a practiced smug expression, though on the inside he was shivering with excitement. "But I assure you Father! I'm going to be better than everyone else when I finally arrive at Hogwarts." Pointing his wand down the quill lowered, splashing the ink only slightly. A chuckle slithered its way out of his father's chest as stared at the ink splatter slowly seeping into his table. "Your form is all wrong, of course." He mused, tilting his head back. "A wizard should not hesitate with his spells Draco." His eyes fell on him, and Draco squirmed. "But... Undoubtedly...you will be the best student to ever attend Hogwarts." He said, his lips curling into a proud smile, making Draco want to leap up and hug him. He stopped himself however, knowing his father was not one for physical affection, so Draco simply nodded. "I.. want to be a brilliant wizard like you, father." He said, his voice reeking of pride. It was true. Ever since he was little Draco stumbled behind his father's proud strides, watching with awe as the man spoke with others at parties and business meetings. Most of all he loved when that powerful man presented Draco as his son, the only heir of the Malfoy family. And strangers would look and gawk at him, showering the boy with attention and praises. Claiming that he looks just like his father, that he will surely make him proud.
Sitting down in the Slytherin table, Pansy still ignored him by chatting with Blaise instead, she had all the right to be mad, he thought.
Like a spirit of some sort.
No matter how much they bicker, Ron and Hermione are made for each other, since the day they met they liked each other and been at each other's throats all the same, Hermione's wit perfectly balancing Ron's kind nature, both of them are Harry's friends and he couldn't find anyone more suitable to date each other,that also means they always come in a pack, thus the pair is easier to find.
“Guess we're not the only ones that noticed” Hermione murmured, tucking her curly hair behind her ear “the crowd really makes the Slytherins look like they don't belong here”
Daring to look around himself he recognized the abandoned girls bathroom, the same he used to go to when he desperately needed to cry, it's ironic, finding himself there again at times of distress, he could lock himself up in here and no one wouldn't care, the thought felt like a stab in his chest
Maybe that's his purpose? Harry wondered, could it be where he comes in? To help Malfoy get to the finish line so when the next time comes for him to turn his back so carelessly to Harry, just like he does now- “hey,” Draco turned to him, one hand resting on the bathrooms door handle “don't just stand there, or does the mighty Harry Potter doesn't need to wash his face?” He snorted, already following Draco in “shut up Malfoy.” He said.
After yesterday's events the eighth year Slytherins decided not to attend the sorting ceremony, instead they all stuck together to Draco taking him to the hospital wing to check that his nose is not broken, they knew that attending Hogwarts will be dangerous with their dark past, and Draco was glad his friends were there besides him, they made the whole situation a kind of a joke, handing Draco a galleon each time someone called them trash, he would then put it in a cup, maybe all this money will buy them a couple of butterbeers to chug down all the bitterness their fellow classmates had for them.
“You seem to be bothered with some else’s problems” she said casually, as if it was written on his face, he chuckled “how did you know?”
"You called me Harry before." He said, and Draco's jaw snapped shut, mouth forming into a thin line.
"Where is he?" Harry said, a little bit too quickly to his liking. "The hell would I know? I haven't seen him since yesterday, he's probably sulking about Hogsmeade still."
It will swallow him.
Standing there, Harry was unsure whether to bolt after Blaise to avoid conversation or stay there staring blankly into a wall. Unaware of his crisis, Draco sat on his bed running a lazy hand through his hair  “we ought to get ready” he mumbled, tired eyes taking in the bright sunlight. “Yeah,right.” Harry spat out, turning around to gather his clothes, his heart dropping when the realization hit him: his clothes are still wet from yesterday. As if his morning couldn't get any weirder. Maybe he didn't have to trust Malfoy this quickly, perhaps offering him a hand of friendship was the wrong thing to do, it only brought weird things and wet clothes. besides, he and Malfoy might never get along, and within seconds time Malfoy will realize this and kick Harry out of his dorm.
“Wait, what project?” Potter asked, looking so confused you might assume he arrived at Hogwarts just yesterday “the project Slughorn gave us last lesson, you're supposed to hang it out in 3 days you know.” Draco said, not even being surprised by Potter's behavior at this point. From their short friendship he had learned that the chosen one is not as clever and amazing as everyone thinks, while he knew this for forever, Harry Potter is nothing more than a huge dumbass. Pansy giggled, looking over Granger's shoulder to look at the boy “you really forgot? You know you're graded for this right?” The chosen one paled, his head quickly jerking towards Granger. “Hermio-”
“Only one way to find out” Draco tightened his tie on his neck and grabbed his bag.
“my father saw it, we were visiting him in the ministry that day, Lucious was practically dragged away from his family’s arms..” Harry simply gaped at his friend, Ron was talking softly as if it was a touchy spot for him,his freckled hands tugging at his sleeves “my father hates Lucius Malfoy you know that, but when he saw the look on Draco’s face… he told me: be kind to him, since now he has nothing left”  Ron bit his lower lip, his shoulders rising as he inhaled “it reminded me of us, when Fred was taken away…” his voice broke at that, eyes filling up with tears that for long have been well known “so, i will be kind to him, not because he deserves it you know? he absolutely does not, but… because it’s the right thing to do”  Harry saw fire in Ron’s eyes, he was burning with angering sadness firing him up from inside, helping him grow, a proud smile curled up on Harry’s face, his best friend truly growed.
"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute."
Persephone gathered George’s blanket off from the couch and followed Ron up the stairs, intent on giving the blanket it back. She bid Ron goodnight and headed up still, until she reached the third year door that read two Weasley names. She knocked—no answer. She would slip in and out, no big deal.
"I remember every detail of every wand I’ve ever sold, Miss Potter. Every single wand wood to the inches—the feather of which will produce your wand came from a phoenix that only gave one other feather—just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for these cores when its sister why, its sister gave you that scar."
Dobby shuddered and Persephone took that as a no, “Oh, no, miss, they would not…Dobby will have to punish himself most terrible for coming to see you again, miss. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, miss—”
“Or is Weasley your biggest fan?” Malfoy asked mockingly.
"Potter, Persephone!"
She stared at him and his smile fell, “Oh—sorry, I thought that was—I mean, isn’t that why you’re not in Quidditch practice? Because you got on the team? Sorry, my mistake,” She smiled sheepishly but kept her mouth shut. No one was supposed to know about that.
“Yeah right,” Fred crossed his arms, smirking in amusement. “What can we help with, young Lily pad?”
Persephone read the inscription and had to nod, “He’s right. That’s amazing…”
Hermione smiled, almost kindly, “I’m really sorry for acting the way I did out of jealousy. And I’m sorry that I thought you were too perfect.”
"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid. He seemed confident in where they were going, though he had obviously been used to a different way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains moved too slow.
She sniffled, “Everyone calls me that! No one bothers to learn my name!”
After Bologna, they spent five days in Florence, where they visited the Duomo di Firenze, quickly becoming tired from the four hundred six-three steps in time spaces. They reached the lantern at the very top of the structure, which was apparently the highest point in central Florence. They visited the Uffizi, where Persephone nearly cried at seeing Botticelli’s finest pieces with her actual eyes. It wasn’t just the gallery which amazed her but the venue itself. It was architecturally fascinating, having been built in the 16
“Oh…” She nodded. That made enough sense. “Wait, didn’t you say something about enchanting some soil when we met? What were you trying to grow?”
Several people joined, and she was sure there would a party in the Gryffindor common room—Gryffindors partied for any small occasion. Hermione followed, and Persephone linked their arms.
"All right—all right—" she heard Quirrell sob. She grimaced in confusion to herself—she had not heard anyone speak. She thought of Snape for a moment, thinking of his quiet voice, but she had to hastily push those thoughts aside when she heard Quirrell pace towards the door.
"What do you see when you look in the mirror?"
“So…so the Quidditch game?”
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
She grabbed his hands, pulling him up and spun into his arms and then he spun her out, pulling her in and lifting her up over his right shoulder. When she was on her feet, she ran away, doing a handless cartwheel followed by a backflip. When she had her knees bent down with the backflip end, he found her and she put her arm over his shoulder and kept her legs bent then straight as he lifted her up into a semi-spin.
"Right," Hermione said, "See you in a minute, I hope...”
They visited the Lestrange vault. It was highly protected and had loads of security. He was only in there for a minute and returned with a heavy bag. She raised a brow and he smiled at her innocently.
"AAAARGH!"
It seemed like any other school—or at least, it seemed very much like Hogwarts. They played Quidditch in the expanding land and they had school tournaments. However, they did not have houses, so it was hard for Persephone to understand how they played against each other.
“Well,
"As charmin’ as yer mum, you are! We knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but never thought for a second yeh wouldn't know abou' Hogwarts, no, not a doubt!” He seemed to be amused but she was now finding herself coiling in defense.
, Malfoy, and we know, like, three, harmless spells—unless your father has been teaching you hexes and jinxes,” She could not ever face Malfoy without a wand—and problem was, she didn’t have a wand.
And awkwardness filled the space as she looked back at the thestral closest to her. It had come closer to her and she almost smiled…it was rather pretty, in a twisted way. She raised her hand hesitantly but she thought better of it, when Ben said, “They’re gentle. They don’t get many visitors.”
“It finally makes sense—why he’s always like that! He fancies you!” He laughed.
She thought for a moment he could read her mind, but then she caught sight of the page he’d turn being titled with the same name. "There's a Ministry of Magic?" She asked without thinking.
While Snape ignored her, he was always very aware of what Malfoy would say to her. He was quick in giving him detention when he said a word about her parents, she’d noticed. She still refused to believe him to be the bad guy, unless Persephone was Percy and Snape was Luke, trying to get on her good side and then make her join Kronos’ side.
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. The sun hadn’t been out in forever. Dudley sniveled.
"Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors.
“I don’t wan you actin stupid, I saw the fangs an’ the eyes—what was that?” He pushed, raising his brows.
Persephone hesitated, “Not a tutor—he was a family friend. He taught me Spanish, and from Spanish I taught myself French, as they as so similar, and I picked up Latin some time ago, along with Ancient Greek, though I’m not yet fluent. Now I’m teaching myself Italian,” She smiled. Ancient Greek from Percy Jackson, of course.
She wanted to ask him what was so wrong with Slytherin—it didn’t seem like it had any negative attributes other than being Voldemort’s house. And why judge a whole house on one person? She was sure not all Gryffindors were cool just because Dumbledore was in it.
"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."
Then she got up, scooping her books into her arm.
It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.
“Oh, Lily, be strong—” George said.
She pulled her hair up into a tight ponytail. She slipped on her shoes and took a deep breath before grabbing the cloak and throwing it around her. She was short enough that it fell all the way to the floor around her. She would have to try not to trip.
“So…so the bank…why’d you be mad to try and rob it?" She asked faintly.
“Well…” He coughed, “Well I was wondering how the wand was working.”
“OI!” They heard. “Down, Diggory. She’s just a first year,” George said jokingly, coming up in between them. Fred and Ben followed.
“Oh—um I don’t think—”
“That’s pretty,” Susan complimented and Persephone smiled, still completely confused by the situation.
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Persephone stared around in concern and confusion. Was he—was he
“Fine—it happens with the full-moon so close,” He said, wrapping his arms around his stomach and leaning his head on the table. “Read the letter.”
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul—”
“Then why are you here?” He asked, grabbing the book back.
“No, no,
She leaned against the wall, “I can just ignore that question, too, then,” She said, crossing her arms.
He snickered, “Well, I didn’t really have much of a choice.”
“You were catatonic—don’t you remember?” Hermione asked gently. Persephone shrugged. “We were in Potions and you said something about rain and then you just stared off into space. You didn’t say anything. I
“You’re starting to sound like Charlie.”
Persephone jumped off her broom just as the Gryffindors spilled into the field. Much like last game, she was engulfed in a hug from her team members, and Fred, who’d picked her right up and spun her around, her arm still raised with the snitch. As he let her down, she glanced back to see Snape landing some place nearby, seeming white-faced and tight-lipped.
It was a quiet afternoon, where they dared each other to eat the dangerous looking beans out of Bertie’s Every Flavor Beans and laughed when the other started gaging in disgust. Persephone was delighted to find she’d come across a strawberry instead of peppermint flavour—she’d only taken the risk on a dare. Peppermints were usually her dinner on days that she refused to do Dudley’s homework—she was not trying to have those memories on the greatest day of her life, or second to, following her birthday.
“Tell me, girl, did the boy succeed?” Salazar suddenly turned to Persephone, “Did he succeed in opening the chamber?”
"He'll turn up," Persephone said sympathetically, “Want some help looking?”
“We would simply give up the task and instead—”
But don't judge on what you see,
Horror-struck, Persephone waved madly at the others to follow her as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, Persephone warning them silently not to move the door by even a wind sweep. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.
“What does that mean?” Ron asked, pointing to the writing on top of the mirror. Persephone shrugged, not taking her eyes off her father.
“Well, gotta be off,” Hagrid said, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (“Knockturn Alley! If you hadn’t found her, Hagrid!”). “See yer at Hogwarts!” And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.
"C'mon, follow me—any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!"
“Why do you always hang out in the sun?” A sudden voice said.
She figured something very important was being kept inside, by someone very important—but all she saw was darkness. She leaned forward, squinting, but saw nothing—and then she noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Persephone bit her tongue back from asking him. She knew better than to think he’d tell her after seeing all that high security.
"You know that girl, with the dark red hair? The one you talked to in the muggle station? Know who she is?"
“Of course,” Persephone smiled.
"Very safe, as they're both dentists," Hermione rolled her eyes.
Susan continued to blush, and Persephone thought it best she not get her hopes on Malfoy. She would much rather not have her friend exposed to scum like that.
When he did speak, he spoke with a surprisingly gentle tone, “Look I get how confusing it is to be told all of this and expect to be okay with any of it. Trust me, I’m well aware of how unfair it is…but I wasn’t lying when I said I want to help you.” He said. She met his eye. “And I know it sucks when someone seems to know more about you then you know about them so…I just want you to know that I’m helping you because it sucks being alone in this mess. If you were wondering why I’m helping you…it’s because I don’t want to be alone anymore in this than you do.”
"What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world—” And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money.
She shrugged, “Could work,” She bit her lip, “Did you read through this entire thing or can I keep it?”
She showered quickly, satisfied with the water cooling her off. She did a thorough job of shampooing and conditioning her hair. Fortunately, since entering the water, she had no hair to shave. She suppose fish didn’t have any hair and mermaids only had hair on their heads. It was rather…strange.
“Good luck,” He told her and she walked out, more confused than ever.
A smarter hat than me.
“Yea!” George pointed at him. “And not to mention she is a first year. Which one of you jackasses earned as many points as she has in your first year?”
“The what office?”
“What is it you wanted to tell us?” Hermione asked. Persephone hummed nervously.
“Oh! Thank you, that’s sweet,” Cedric was the definition of nice boy. “I bet Flitwick’s the most disappointed, eh? He was really looking forward to it…”
The two made their way down to the Great Hall, or where they thought the Great Hall was, when Ron insisted they passed by a portrait twice. It didn’t help when the portraits could move from frame to frame. When they did find their way to the Great Hall, half the students had already been seated and chatting animatedly at all house tables. She caught Daphne’s eye and returned the blonde girl’s wave and smile.
He threw one arm up, “Borrow, we borrow Filch’s shackles, come here and tie ourselves up. The door will lock and we spend the night writhing in pain.” He sent her a sarcastic smile.
A new character: Hades Black, son of Regulus but that's all I'll be revealing for now. Transferred from Ilvermorny, good friends with the twins and a year older than Persephone. Troubled backstory, a supernatural creature (like Remus but not like Remus) and ties to Voldemort. Doesn't belong to one house so he switches as he pleases, doesn't care about houses so he's just apart of all them as he feels.
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Persephone found herself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron, at least twice.
Who had he been talking to?
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Persephone expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
i hope you enjoy it <3
Even while sitting in the back the glares were piercing through his skull, he felt utterly uncomfortable, Draco found that dropping his gaze was much easier when the crowd of people is something uneasy to look at.
“Solus?” The three of them asked in sync, Hagrid nodded handing the parchment back “it sure looks like a Solus, maybe you guys should check it out? I had a book somewhere-” Hagrid got up, searching through his little drawers “uh..” he scratched  his nape “ I can't find it” the teens groaned, Ron sinking deeper in the cushion “of course”, Hermione bit her lower lip “there should be something about them in the library right?”  Hagrid sighed, going back into his chair “I'm sorry guys, I wish I could help more” , Harry shook his head “ it's okay, you helped plenty”
Can love find way through ink and parchment?
Draco swallowed hard, he just couldn't get it, why was she treating it like it's not a problem?
“ But all of us had seen- death..” Ginny mumbled, raw pain in her expression, Ron flinched, but nodded anyway “that's true, maybe Harry saw something that Draco had seen” the group hummed, all staring at Malfoy while slowly chewing their breakfast.
suddenly grabbed me and pushed me against the wall!!”
And yet, he was allowed to walk this road again, he was privileged to study an another year with his classmates, with Pansy, oh how much he missed Pansy,and spending the whole year buried under the thick castle floors hiding in the dungeons with his fellow Slytherins seemed to be all worth it.
reached her office, Draco moaned with delight as he dropped those bloody books on the dark wooden table, looking at his poor beautiful hands dramatically when he noticed how red they became, this was absolute torture, McGonagall is an evil woman.
Who’s intense green eyes glared at him through the whole hall, Draco felt an uncomfortable flip in his stomach,he dropped his gaze, staring at his abused piece of toast “I'm not hungry” he mumbled before standing up and leaving the great hall behind.
“A chance is all I ask for.” He said, feeling his back become a little lighter
“I can't believe you're such a prick”
“there's a thing!!”
But this time nothing seemed to work out, weight, unwanted burden made his movements tense, cutting uneven pieces, burning some parts, Draco found it hard to concentrate with the glares at his nape, why won't it work out? at some point he snapped, pushing the cauldron off hsi table, shattered pieces flying everywhere brought shocked gasps, everyone were looking at him, Draco’s shoulders rising and dropping as he breathed heavily staring intensely at the mess he made.
“Filch was there!! I saved your ass!!”
But Malfoy was not having it of course, blowing off on Harry like that, he actually thought he matured since his sixth years, turns out he didn't really, in seconds he realized how much of mess Malfoy really is, and he had no patience to deal with it
“Oh. I see.”
Shortly after that they reached a tiny classroom, McGonagall opened the door swiftly heading over to the teachers table and pulling out a huge pile of books “carry them to my office please” she said, Draco nodded pulling out his wand only to be stopped by her “oh you won't be needing magic for such a simple task won't you?”  Draco frowned, why bother carrying stuff when you
to laugh, stepping down the shore he just oh so kindly pushed Harry off, ruining his hopes- his trust!
He nodded and they stared at each other. He’d gotten taller, she was now realizing. How old was he? Fourteen? She wasn’t sure but he was very tall.
“Yes,” She smiled at him.
“You’re not…a girl…” Persephone repeated. She suddenly looked at her, very, very confused. She looked like a girl—a very pretty girl at that. She had the long hair, the voice…she even had…well,
She stood on her tiptoes to see and saw a tall figure follow Draco. This must be Draco’s father—he had the same pale, pointed face and identical glinting, emotionless grey eyes. He would have been handsome, had it not been for the look on his face that suggested he thought he was better than everyone and anyone.
So, that evening, she added the books and…
She was sure their camaraderie would not last, but she was perfectly okay with this fact.
written on it in with pink icing.
Persephone did something very stupid and very brave—but mostly stupid. Driven by the thought of the troll hurting Ron, she took a great running jump and managed to fasten her arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Persephone hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and she’d accidently taken Fred’s wand out of his hand and it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
The goblin looked at it closely.
"This needs thinking about,” he said. “I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces...."
Persephone politely avoided looking, “Ballet program so I’ll be staying with a friend.”
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. She thought it a bad idea to grab a lamp so she pulled her wand out and cast lumos—and aha! Light worked through the robe and, checking her reflection in a window, she could see no one would see the light through the cloak. Amazing!
Cedric gave a signature smile, “Swell.” Persephone smiled at his copycat.
They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon put Persephone’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for her, which she found surprisingly nice of him, until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.
"Persephone Potter!"
Instead of finding her father’s wide beam and her mother’s wet eyes, she found something different. She found herself, alone, but she hadn’t realized that the girl was her until she saw the scar. The girl she was in the mirror did not look like Persephone—well, she looked like Persephone, only better.
And then he turned to go deeper into the forest. She cried out in shock, “What are you doing!?”
She glanced up at the High Table. She examined the table closely, and gave a shaking smile to Hagrid when she caught his eye and gave her the thumbs up. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat the real Albus Dumbledore. She recognized him easily from the card she’d gotten in the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts.
"I really don’t want any."
"Nothing—just black—there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop."
They stopped, smiling sheepishly, and the man offered a necklace, “Bella collana per belle donne, eh!” At this, he reached back to clasp a necklace around Diana’s neck, smiling as he did. It was a sweet and genuine sentiment. Diana was beaming the whole next twenty minutes and Ben nudged her, earning him a slap on the arm.
"I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered.
"Oh, yeah, I—I read about that—about me, I mean,” she said, the dizzying feeling fighting its way back into her head. “Haha, yeah, reading, right? Crazy…” She giggled nervously, nodding, not knowing how to respond to this.
“Does if the Ministry sends a letter,” he countered, “Come on,” He nodded to the car.
“Oh—I’d like to see your parents,” Ron said. “And you can see our family, too.”
points, Herman. We both won those points and you know that very well.”
"Oh.” Persephone said. She thought that was for the best—riches and immortality were far too toxic to the wrong people. “And Nicolas Flamel?”
“OKAY!” Hades’ hands came down on both her shoulders, “We will be the best duet, I promise you. We will win, okay? I promise.”
“Looks like Malfoy’s got his nerve back,” Persephone grumbled. “We have to do something!”
“Only two of us could fit under it with Norbert.” Hermione noted. The fact that Hermione was okay with breaking countless school rules showed how desperate they were to be rid of the situation.
Persephone gestured for them to the hall with her head, and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Someone turned a corner and Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run—he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.
“Why?” She asked suspiciously.
The school was a single, sprawling building with carefully manicured grounds, modelled not after the main residences of the royal family but a hunting reservation, expanded in manners to allow for somewhat permanent residencies of the students. Their motto was written on the main hall’s wall, Alacriter Arcana Discimus: "We learn secrets with alacrity".
made sense.
While Persephone knew she ought to keep herself tame around Malfoy, the smile that now always seemed to be lurking on the git’s face during the next week made her blood boil. This was such a perfect opportunity for him—he could at any time go to Dumbledore and not spare a detail of what he’d seen and surely get Hagrid escorted off the grounds even.
She took a deep breath and leaned up, knocking three times. He was still pacing, according to the brief glance at the map. The doors opened silently but she didn’t hear anyone.
the pieces…
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
“It was cloudy, Mum!” Fred said.
"PERSEPHONE POTTER!"
“Knockturn Alley,” said Hagrid grimly.
“Well they are cute,” Persephone said, taking a bite of her apple. George turned to her looking offended and Fred raised both his eyebrows at her.
"Did you get it?" Ron asked when Persephone finally remembered the password and got in. "What's the matter?"
She shrugged and he nodded, “Fred…told me, and I hope you won’t hold it against him, but he told me that you had a panic attack in school, a few short months ago?”
"Yes, yes, that's right," Professor Flitwick said, beaming at Persephone. "Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Mrs. Potter. And what model is it?"
“Precisely,” He nodded. “Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?”
He cocked a brow, “All sirens have ADHD. Did you know that?”
George immediately got suspicious, narrowing his eyes, “What?”
Surrey
She stared away in completely confusion, looking to Ron, wondering if he saw that as well. Ron, wide-eyed, shook his head and shrugged.
. She didn’t need to squint—not at all! She ended up nearly a different looking person—still a red head but with freshly cut layers that made her hair
"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die."
With some interesting stuff,
"Don’t be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished."
“I think we should run through the schedule one more time,” Uncle Vernon said. “We should all be in position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be —?”
This nearly brought a smile to her face, “Har, har, Malfoy deserved it,” She said before turning suddenly to them, inspiration flooring through her veins. “That offer you made—may I make a condition?”
“He does not!”
“Uh, what?”
“Just selling.”
“Right, and get another Howler back,” Ron said, groaning as he shoved it into his bag.
Pansy didn’t lead her out of the library—instead, she led a confused Daphne to another table, just a few feet away from Susan and Persephone, and then she started to talk to Daphne, loudly, about how lucky she was that her father had reserved some lodge up in some mountains. It would luxurious, Pansy assured Daphne (and Susan and Persephone, who couldn’t help hearing every word).
"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. “I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected."
"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" Persephone asked dreamily.
Hades looked tired when she found him. He brightened when he saw her and pushed himself off the wall he was leaning up against. She folded her arms, and watched him approach her.
"Broken wrist," Persephone heard her mutter. "Come on, boy—it's all right, up you get."
It was Draco that spoke, “How dare—”
She slammed the book shut and stood. That was enough for her. Ben had set her up—he hadn’t told her the process and only given her a time sensitive instruction for the impossible.
The giant chuckled.
A letter arrived for her the second time that week. Curious, she opened it to find a paper that look like it had been ripped from a notebook and written in ink. The handwriting was slanted and interesting.
First on her witching agenda was to figure out how to sneak laptops into Hogwarts.
He nodded solemnly, “The spirits of those that came before us—those who have left us their legacy, a legacy that we must protect at the cost of our lives!”
They watched, feeling relieved, only to watch the letter disappear from Hedwig’s grasp. Hedwig continued on her journey as they watched, shocked.
She was seeing something strange—the snitch was moving so slowly in front of her. It was under water? She reached out her hand, her strangely pale and nail-sharpened hand, to grab the snitch.
Persephone furrowed her brows, “Time…?”
4 Privet Drive
At some point, they would figure it out, wouldn’t they?  Hagrid shuffled off, though Ron was still thinking of his presence. “What was he hiding behind his back?”
, the day Gringotts was robbed, or almost robbed?
"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey..." His voice was gruff.  He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. "Budge up, yeh great lump," said the strange r.
“Her name is Lily,” Ron said quite bravely, staring down Malfoy. Persephone felt a swell of courage fill her at the protective tone Ron had taken on and glared at Malfoy.
When they finally surfaced into the common room, Percy and Persephone went flying forward, landing against the couch. For the first time since she’d met him, Percy was laughing hysterically, not bothering to keep etiquette.
"Well, now, welcome to your first flying lesson.” She barked out to them. “I know well enough you have all high hopes of being on a broom today. Well, I am sorry to be the one to bring you the news but no one will be riding a broom today.”
either,” He looked to the ground separating them. “Were you planning to go for a swim?”
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
Persephone had blanked.
Persephone took the bottle and sniffed—it smelt very sweetly and tempting but the word beer in the title chased her temptation away. She was in no way interested or legally allowed to drink alcohol. Hermione watched her with a raised brow as she lowered the bottle before she sighed in relief.
On their last evening, Persephone’s clothes were all washed and she repacked her trunk with her new things in their right places while laying out her uniform and robes for the next day.
She’d also been able to lift things with the air, if she pretended like the air was solid and she pushed up, concentrating on that bit of air. So, air and Earth. It was thrilling to find this—she wondered if the instances of heat resistance meant that she could also do something with fire. She’d go down and stick her hand in the fireplace if that wouldn’t immediately break the façade the Dursleys were putting on. And besides, she was more interested to see whether or not she could do something with water.
She read through the book Hermione had gotten her several times and even went as far into researching through many library books, though she did not find too many outside of the Restricted Section. As tempting as it was to put on her invisibility cloak, she didn’t want to risk it once more. Besides, there was plenty on Human Transfiguration—not enough to saturate her curiosity but enough to teach her how to use her powers. She could change herself effectively into anyone, though she always looked like her natural self.
“Hello, is anything the matter?” She asked.
“I won’t get caught,” She said quickly, touching the sink. Its coolness sent a shiver down her spine.
And then she realized they were sitting so close, they were share a breath. She pushed herself out from under the desk and away from him, “We should go.”
His mood suddenly shifted, “No…no, I don’t play—don’t get me wrong, I love Quidditch, I just have…other…priorities…”
“What are you doing?” She asked, turning to her. For the first time, Persephone noticed her eyes were puffy and tearful and her lips were all pink.
Persephone stared coldly up at her—she couldn’t help feeling tired of being bullied.
“You were looking for Malfoy?” Ron asked incredulously but she had already marched off.
Persephone thought back to how Susan's face flushed when she talked about Malfoy--pretty Susan and awful Draco. She felt no remorse when she said,
Hermione looked at in her surprise and Persephone shrugged, “I’ve got a weird gut feeling.”
Perhaps it was because she might have a serious illness, or perhaps it was because she acted almost amusingly at the grim news, but she was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.
She concentrated hard on the wind, on the air around her feet—she wanted to feel it push her up. She was asking permission, begging for the air to not let her die.
“Bird?” She gasped, suddenly looking down at her legs.
Again: Not sure which house Persephone will be in just yet. I'm playing around with different possibilities right now so it'll be easier to figure it out. What do you guys think? Please do comment your ideas or thoughts.
“Show off.”
She folded the map up, and slid it in her bag.
“Don’t go back? Why?"
"Now wait jus' one second!" Hagrid thundered, “Tha’ the story yer heard, is it?” He had leapt to his feet. In his anger, he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. "Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this girl—this girl!—knows nothin' abou'—about ANYTHING?"
“I’d be happy to coach you myself, but only with a promise you do not pull a stunt like this again, you hear me?” He raised his brows—his suspiciously well plucked brows.
The dorm room was empty. Had…she…hallucinated that? She turned back to the mirror and stared at the diadem. Acting foolishly, she asked, in her mind,
At some point, after feeding Salem and letting her purr herself to sleep very close to her chest, Persephone fell asleep only to wake up sweating a few hours later. She felt disoriented for a long moment and then she felt the full swing of her sudden nausea.
The day turned out great—she’d woken up to a delicious smell wafting through the corridors, she had her picnic basket full of her things for later safely under her bed and she had her wand! She’d need to find Ben—in the mean time, she tried to prepare herself emotionally, for what she would say to her parents, should she feel their presence with her. The looming presence of her parents’ death really hit her, as it had now been ten years. Or it would be ten years that evening.
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.
“Hm,” She considered her for a moment. “Well, Neville does come from a good family, though I wouldn’t be caught dead in his grandmother’s hat. Did you see it?” Pansy asked Daphne, who nodded seriously.
While it didn’t really bother her, when she thought of it, it did. She overthought things and they made her sad—yes, she wished desperately to be going home to Lily and James Potter, to even have the chance to see them, but she had the next best thing—Ron and George and Fred. While she’d never been so outright unhappy with her living situation in Privet Drive, being around other kids her age and talent made her realize how bad of a situation it really was.
The discussion turned to everyone’s family as she popped a grape into her mouth. It was the harder type, the one that made that satisfying tearing sound when you bit into it.
“That is hard to answer, Miss Potter, as a wand is it not just its core—every wand core reacts differently to every wand wood,” He nodded, “Do you mind?” He pulled at her fingers, cracking them.
"Right then," Hagrid said slowly as Hermione, Neville and Malfoy cast her worried glances, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment."
"Hagrid’s!” She called back, nearly tripping over her own two feet.
There were about a two hundred students in the chamber that was not meant to hold even a hundred.
“Of course, Georgie.”
Persephone looked at her in surprise before blushing, “Well…I am happy too…even if he is annoying.” She didn’t really think they were friends but she wasn’t about to say that out loud.
She took a deep breath and turned around, only to find herself face-to-face with the gargoyle from earlier, only this time, it had its arm up over its head. She didn’t like the way it was positioned, as if it was ready to grab her before she had turned around.
Another pause of silence, “You would do great in Slytherin, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that…”
“She’s clearly my descendant,” A throaty, deep voice came from the painting of a tall, muscular man with a lion-like mane of wavy red hair and a beard to match. He had green eyes, peach-coloured skin and was holding his infamous sword. If it hadn’t been for the sword, she could still know who he was, with the gold and red robes. “She’s got a powerful mane of blood red hair!”
"Ron, you've got something on your nose."
By the time they got into fondu, Hades seemed better. He wasn’t wobbling anymore from loss of balance and he wasn’t looking so freaked out anymore. In fact, he looked very sturdy. For a ballet dance, that is. Perhaps he would prefer other dances, hip hop, as boys always for whatever reason drift toward, but she would be very happy if he stayed in ballet.
"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," Ron suggested. "It'd be safe to ask them."
“No, I do not want you to get involved,” She said quickly. “I know what you did to those poor theatre kids last year.”
“I have an idea,” She said, lifting her head up to look at the sink in interest. What had Moaning Myrtle said? That the sink had worked for years? Salazar Slytherin said that his little chamber was on the second floor, but it moved all the way under the school…like a plumbing map.
Dean Thomas was a godsend when it came to copying handwritings. She repaid him with help on the Transfiguration essay they had due—it was a fair enough trade, as he had a lot of mistakes.
The twins took their places next to Ron, in front of Persephone and Hermione caught up with them, sliding into the seat next to Persephone. When Hermione demanded the story of had happened, she told her she would tell her later, and that she had something to tell Ron and Hermione about, when they were alone in the common room.
"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed she's got no friends."
She smiled, “The heir you remember died in Azkaban fifty years ago and the current heir isn’t a he, it’s a she. And she requires help.”
Eventually, summer came to an end. While Persephone greatly looked forward to returning to Hogwarts, she would miss the Burrow. She felt unjustly envious of Ron because she was sure her welcome back to Privet Drive wouldn’t even include letting her into the house.
was evidently the right password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. She gaped at it—she was about to turn around and walk away.
To achieve their ends.
You should read it. He went to the Merge School of Under-Water Spellage in the Red Sea.
She only stopped when she reached the end of a corner, were she could see both aisles. She needed to catch her breath but she didn’t dare take her eyes away from the aisles.
The goblin read the letter carefully, before nodding seriously.
“Irrelevant,” She said.
They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes' time. Persephone had never been to London. She hadn’t even been allowed on the school trip to London—the Dursleys had told the school that she would misbehave as she always did when she was to travel too far. She was edging excitedly at this opportunity. She didn’t think Hagrid had ever been to London either, for he handed over his bills, "Muggle money," as he called it, to buy the tickets.
“We’re not allowed to use magic out of school!” She hissed at him. “We’ll get in trouble!”
How he managed to put a collar on that thing—beyond Persephone.
She rolled the window down, to let Hedwig go, “Alright, Hedwig, to Dumbledore, alright? As fast as you can!” And she sent her owl flying.
“You cheated for him?” Persephone hissed at her, turning back to stare in shock. “Why would you do that!?”
“Yes,” Ron and Persephone said in unison without a moment to think.
“That’s just not fair!” She moaned.
"So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Persephone. She watched him with wide eyes—was he truly mad? "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised."
"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy—" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
“Of Hell,” He corrected.
“Hello,” Her voice was shaking. “Nice to meet you.”
and Snape is all
Thief, you have been warned, beware
There was an office, a private office, kept by Lucius Malfoy. It was on the east wing, on the third floor. It was kept locked with a key that was on Lucius Malfoy at all times of the day. Hades was sure there had to be a record of his father in that room and Persephone had to agree that there was likely some proof in the office. She’d forgotten entirely of asking him to do her a favor of her own, putting her mind instead to the task at hand.
"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now—Miss Potter, let’s see…” He did not turn around when the boy handed him a tape measure with silver markings. When he caught her looking at the boy, he nodded faintly, “My assistant for the summer. Which is your wand arm?"
She rushed from the room, checking thrice to make sure the coast was clear, before climbing the stairs quickly to the balcony. Hades was waiting. Without a word, he nodded forward and led her through the Manor.
"Hagrid!"
"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?" Persephone didn’t know what ‘Wood’ was, but she wasn’t sure she could dodge something named ‘Wood’.
“That is certainly right,” He said harshly. “You did not think.”
She could not find a better place than that bathroom in the dungeon and she felt like this was very bad because she was really about to honor her parents in a girl’s bathroom. She could have asked a teacher to use their classroom, if she explained the whole plan, and she was sure they’d let her use it, but she wanted this to be done alone, just her and her parents.
“Closest natural body of water—the lake,” He said, mostly to himself she had to guess. “I can’t get you out into the lake right now—you’ll freeze or someone might see,” he was muttering now, taking her bag in his hands. “Okay, I know what to do—get you into the lake and find out if youre immune to water temperature.”
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
Stumbling around for words, he pointedly to his desk and she dashed, looking through his stacked books and she pulled out the right book, the same book. She looked up at Gary, who was staring in bewilderment.
"See Professor Dumbledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. "Why?"
," Ron protested.
Ugh, Pansy Parkinson. The bane of her existence. ‘Wasn’t she just terrible, Tom?’
“Who?”
They had reached the end of the passageway now and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, the ceiling arching high above. It was full of small, shiny birds, all fluttering around the room in different directions. Persephone nearly lost her mind at the sound—sensory overload, maybe.
The argument over her moving into the bedroom was a long one, but in the end, the Dursleys made her move into the bedroom. It was aunt Petunia’s responsibility to make it seem she had a normal little girl’s life (as she’d thought this was their goal), so instead of bare walls and a bed, her room became all flower themed. Floral wallpaper, with white lace curtains and flower beddings and just a very floral scent that came natural to Persephone (how symbolic). It was rather strange, the obvious floral theme Petunia gathered for her niece, but it wasn’t very uncommon for her to be just the slightest nice to her.
“Can I see that?” Draco interrupted, his eyes fixated on the withered hand on its cushion.
Then she was splashed with water. She blinked, looking up and seeing Ron standing, an empty water jug in hand. He was reaching over the table and blinked.
She answered before properly thinking of an appropriate response, “An orphan.”
Back in the Room of Requirement, Persephone was sat in front of the fireplace with a heavy blanket over her shoulders and her hair over her blanket, red and curly again.
It varied greatly and mostly came down to a competitive streak between dancers. There was heavy competition between the girls. The first group, Pansy outshined everyone with a phenomenal variation to the music of the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. She would be going onto the next round and to Persephone’s chagrin, she saw one of three woman smile at Pansy as she won the round.
I've decided to change the earlier name of Nico Di Angelo to Ben. I'm not sure why, exactly, but I've been thinking it for a while and I've decided it suits his character much better. Also there's a reason she hasn't been referring to him by his nickname, rather by his given, pureblooded, birth name *wink, wink*
Persephone rolled her eyes and Fred backed him up, “Trust us, Lils, there’s been four years of sexual tension between the two.”
“Someone a long time ago was going to pass a law to make Americans use Celcius but the demography spoke against it,” He informed her. “And I’m not American. I was born
As sketchy as this appeared, she was impressed with the magic. And she was tempted—how useful would it be to never question why she felt one way or another?
Her face fell and she closed her eyes. Now this was a crowded, unfortunate scene.
He offered a perfect change of subject and an opportunity to answer her question, “Not too sure what Quidditch is, to be quite honest.”
She raised a brow in curiosity, “What is it?”
She had not a clue of what behavior he was talking about.
She handed it over, “I’m so sorry Professor Snape, it won’t happen again.”
It seriously wasn’t funny—especially when George wasn’t anywhere to be seen and then suddenly popped up.
Susan looked just about ready to faint from being so close to the man.
She felt like her legs were being stabbed by miniature little knives every two seconds—it made it impossible to walk. She would be glad to get this stupid full moon business over and done with.
She understood immediately—no, he’d never said he was a werewolf but he certainly wasn’t normal. Was he dangerous like he claimed she could be? They sat in silence, neither speaking. He finally broke the silence. “Look, I’m sorry for saying your goals weren’t practical…I meant to say that they don’t do much but secure your background.”
It was the one thing her mother had done right, according to the myth of her aunt’s sister.
Persephone nodded, “Me neither.”
And then, maybe her own scream had blended in as well and something nearby had shattered, someone toppled down and something warm was on her hands.
Meanwhile, in the Gryffindor locker room, the Gryffindor team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes. Slytherin would be playing in green.
He straightened, “If that is all.”
“Um…”
"Oh, Neville," she heard the old woman sigh.
Ron looked at her in surprise, as did Hagrid. “Well, maybe,” She nodded. “They were in the same year, I think, Sephie.”
“No I haven’t!” She squeaked. “We’re just friends!”
She pushed her trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.
She tried to contain herself as she leaned up into his ear to explain what it was and what it did. His mouth dropped open and he couldn’t speak for a moment. She stepped away from him and wondered if, ironically speaking,
She’d been deep in thought when she realized someone was staring at her. It took her a moment to realize that she’d been staring back at the girl in the water.
“I don’t know how you survive without a house-elf,” She shuddered. “Write to me?”
“Right.” Fred nodded, “It’s obviously a load of dung—Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who’s inner circle.”
She nodded, trembling.
She pursed her lips, and changed the subject, “So, last night I told Ron and Hermione about me.”
“Hey…” He said again, “What…how are you?”
She sat down as he said, “Stupid—useless—thing—”
“Ah, ah, ah,” She grabbed his hand, “We’ve found a clue!”
to Persephone.
"So, you’re really Persephone Potter?" Ron asked. Uncomfortable, Persephone nodded. "Huh—well, sorry, I just thought it was another one of Fred and George's jokes," said Ron. "So, have you really got—you know..."
“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,” he said.
She bit her lip—should she tell him? Would he react badly? “I—I’ll tell you later. When Hermione gets here—wanna play chess?” She said, changing the subject.
, she spent the day with the Johnsons, in Diana’s room, where she gave her the most girlish of goodbyes—trimming her eyebrow hair while telling her how to maintain nice skin. Persephone had always took Diana as the most educated girl on the block, that she forgot every pretty dress she owned had come from her. Now, hearing her tell her how to use eyelash curlers was the strangest occurrence.
“Persephone Potter has left Dobby no choice.” He said sadly before a loud crack was heard and he was gone. Confused, she wondered what sort of no choice situation this was. Was he going to burn the school down to make her not going?
‘Okay!’ She said, jumping up and down, pacing back and forth in front of the door. Pointing at the door, it was her target—she would knock and she would knock thoroughly (how do you even knock thoroughly!?).
Snape finished calling the names as Persephone went over what just happened and wondered what she had done wrong. She didn’t raise her hand—yea, maybe that was it. She could apologize after class?  Yes, she’ll do that. That would ease the bubbling feeling of shame in her stomach.
“What?” Amanda sniffed, eating another piece of candy.
"As tempting as that sounds, I have to play,” Persephone said. “I’m the only Seeker for Gryffindor and he’ll be looking for any reason to pick on Gryffindor. Maybe if the only Gryffindor he’s ever tolerated to an extent is playing, we might have a better chance.”
“It’s gone,” Ron said, “The train’s left. What if Mum and Dad can’t get back through to us?”
"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm."
Wood barely gave a pep talk, so it was Fred who took over, “Fuck shit up out there,” He paused, “But don’t die.”
“Well, everyone knows it,” Pansy said looking around. The laughs had quieted and everyone seemed to be listening. “I mean, wasn’t your mum…a magic thief?”
Persephone had always loved old architecture and had always wanted to see some of it in person, but she’d never been able to dream of seeing a place as spectacular as it was strange. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
“Patience is a virtue, my dear,” Fred’s voice came from her right.
“Ron!” Persephone yelled, her scream echoing with the other shouts. It seemed like the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.
Diana laughed, “Shy, but now he is much more…how you say? Friendly.”
“No one can succeed without a mentor—” Fred continued.
She sat up, choking for air, unable to discern where she was for a moment, but she knew well this wasn’t the place she wanted to be.
“Perfect,” Uncle Vernon said proudly, but proud of what? Persephone did not know. “Now, when dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and you,” He turned on Persephone. “Will follow your aunt and say not a word, while I bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. Be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.”
She ended up opening up all the letters and found they were all the same. There was no use in them, so she ended up throwing them into the fireplace later than evening when no one was looking. Apparently, three more letters had come to the house as well. Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.
Along with the loud creak of the door came low, rumbling growls. All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.
She turned to find Cedric Diggory walking next to her. He, too, had a pile of books, though he was carrying them in his arms. She smiled, “Dangerously. You?”
She blinked and looked down, “Oh, yes—observant,” She noted. “I haven’t been wearing my glasses and I suppose I’ve damaged my eyes further, hm?” She tried to pass it off as a joke but she was starting to panic—she couldn’t even properly see the outlines of their legs!
Someone caught up with her in the corridor, “Oi!”
But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Persephone to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.
"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
"That seems to be in order."
golfer, Mr. Mason… Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason…”
“Er, excuse me,” She grabbed her bag and rushed from the room. She didn’t make it far when her legs started to throb painfully. It was as if each step was a stab up her heels. She took her shoes off but this did not help.
"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Persephone and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. She was starting to seriously like this man.
Gary nodded vigorously, blushing red, “Absolutely—Charlie promised to teach me the Bat-Bogey Hex as soon as possible. It’s a Weasley special.”
"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned next to her.
"Well it'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," Hermione said, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.
“Most pureblooded families of the Sacred Twenty-Eight are invited—”
Lavender, who sat behind her, noticed her silence. Persephone, flushing, told her, “I forgot my wand.”
“Consider me dead,” He smiled. Persephone noticed the boy had gotten slightly taller. “You must read a lot,” He noted, staring up at the books.
She dove in deeper into those three, favored subjects. With the extra reading and lessons she was allowed by Flitwick, she was quickly finding a rhythm with using her wand. It took her little to no time to become in sync with her wand—it was like riding a broom in a way. She could only but give a will to her way and the wand followed through. Flitwick also awarded her a nice amount of points, which boosted her confidence up with her wand. It felt like…like all her energy was focused on the tips of her fingers, moving into the wand. She felt….powerful.
"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT" she said firmly.
And as soon as she did, Pansy screamed out, “MY HAIR!”
“Right,” He nodded, and turned away.
"What's that at its feet?" Hermione whispered.
She passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad again."
What else had she truly been expecting?
"Mighta come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. "Yeah...he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after...so I told him...an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon...an' then...I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks....Let's see...yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted...but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home....So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy..."
about?”
“So inspiring…” Persephone told him, wiping away a tear. George nodded, looking dramatically solemn.
Standing away, the boys slid the trunk out the window, inch by inch.
God, what was her name!?
The funeral was a quiet affair of no real distinct characteristic—it was exactly as Persephone expected a funeral to be. It was closed casket, with some people going up to speak some words. There were more mutterings of what a terrible man Cygnus had been, miserable and rude into his latest years. His death was something expected.
"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," The pale boy said carelessly, misinterpreting her glancing at his entourage. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." So he’d taken the James Bond way of things?
—interrupted their spy movements, “I
As soon as she walked in, a sudden hush waved over the tables for just a second and then the talking resumed even louder. Persephone was glad to find Hermione had saved her a seat right next to her, right across from Ron and the twins. She sat down, ignoring that people had stood up to get a look at her.
“So you’re a legilimens now?” He asked sarcastically, flipping through the book.
“Er…” She said, staring up at him with wide eyes.
“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy.
“I’m starving,” She said. “Rehearsals are in ten minutes. You think we can make it to the kitchens beforehand?”
"Yeah—so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Sephie. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe—'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you, gettin' things from Gringotts—knows he can trust me, see.
The last few she could guess whom they were from. One she unwrapped and found it was a chess set of her very own from the secret Santa exchange the Gryffindor tower had done—from Audrey, the prefect.
She nodded happily. Now that it was the end of the year, she could fully appreciated the summer plans. He smiled, “Brilliant! Me too! Hey—I know this might be last minute, but every year, we board someone for the month of the dance program—August, I mean. Greggory just dropped out—would you want to board? It’s only because I live really close to the place.”
“Huh?”
“That’s an advanced spell,” She said. He looked up from his parchment and shrugged. “You were barely concentrating on conjuring the charm—and you did it. Several times.”
“Time for Quidditch, go get dressed,” Fred said.
She sorted her gifts out, repacking her trunk accordingly so they fit easier. She was glad that she’d placed a spell on it to enlarge the trunk, but keep the weight balanced.
“Being the perfect student.” She thought so, at least.
Between the interesting classes, Persephone could only assume one class would be not as fun as the others and that was History of Magic, which was taught by a
“What are your next classes?” He demanded suddenly very serious.
The teacher had them all blindly navigate to a different section of the stage, to allow for no one to know who is who and then, when they were thoroughly confused, the music began.
After putting on her green sweater and dropping off her fudge and weirder present under pillow, she quickly pulled hair up into a fashionably messy pony tail, before joining the Weasleys.
Finally, Persephone spoke, “So…”
“It’s embarrassing—stupid Pansy Parkinson got to me in front of everyone. I thought for sure they would steal my clothes or something—this is definitely worse.” She crossed her arms. “God I hate her.”
“The Sorting Hat spends all year coming up with a new song,” Fred whispered, leaning towards Persephone. “This should be good.”
“Probably.”
"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone—find it, but not use it—would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes...Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them—but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?"
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.
Mr. Malfoy’s eyes fell around the flock of redheads and his eyes landed on Persephone. A glint of interest filled his eyes and he took a moment to smile a most pompous smile. “Persephone Potter…Lucius Malfoy.” He offered her his hand and, not wanting to be impolite to even a man like Draco’s father, she offered hers. He shook it once and before she could let go, he pulled her forward, “You must meet my…nephew, Hades Black.”
"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Persephone in amazement.
"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk." The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap. They both stared down at it, frowning. "He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look..."
Another time, she’d been running away from boys who had tried to hold her down to kiss her during break at school and she’d found herself on the roof of the school. She tried desperately to explain she had no idea how she’d gotten up there, but no one believed her. Another time, she was reaching for something up on the tallest shelf in the kitchen and had put her hand down on the hot stove. She didn’t flinch or anything and she came off unscarred and only noticed when Diana’s mother had screamed. Another time, she had quite literally flown off a swing set at the park, floating gently down and Aunt Petunia locked her in the cupboard for a week. She could only come to the conclusion that she was a demigod daughter of a god. It
She ran into Gary, whom she greeted nicely. She grinned at him, “Excited for getting your wand?”
“Or worse,” She suddenly said. “You said I could hurt someone…or worse. What’s worse?” She asked and upon seeing the look on his face, she knew it wasn’t being expelled. “Oh.”
There a carriage waiting, pulled by a group of thestrals, of which a smaller one recognized Hades immediately, jumping excitedly. Hades seemed to need to hold himself in from going to the thestrals, only waving subtly at them, as if they could understand. Persephone wouldn’t be surprised if they could.
“First years,” Someone spoke in a polished Scottish accent, gaining their attention immediately. A tall woman with stern facial structure and robes of emerald green was waiting by the staircase. She gave off a very immediate vibe that she should not be trifled with. “If you would follow me, pleae.”
He stared at her, quirking an eyebrow, “No—I’m Ben—”
Persephone thought for a moment on what she knew to be the worst and most stressful competition, the competition that made most people break; she stood, leaning over the table to stare into his eyes, “Bake off.”
"Alright, I—think we—lost him,” Persephone panted, leaning on her knees, feeling the cold wall behind her. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.
She took extra-long to pack her things as she waited for the class to finally clear out before she cleared her throat, “Professor?”
“But won’t you be too busy with your Babysitter’s Club?” She pouted mockingly.
“So you’re suggesting I fake my own death?” She asked, laughing nervously, suddenly feeling a foreign feeling poison her chest. “How much of a success rate does that come with?”
Hades stepped forward, brandishing his wand, “Stay still for a second.” She felt a hiss and then something moved her hair. A silk, golden ribbon was tied to the upper part of her hair. “There, gold and red. Works fine.”
“Perfect, Vic will start you up in a few minutes,” He pointed to the play’s official piano guy. She smiled awkwardly. There were more people around, more people had arrived for the rehearsal. Strangely enough, the past few rehearsals Snape had come to watch. She had her suspicions as to why Quirrell always was there but Snape?
“They have their own type of magic, I think.” She said. “They can even launch fire balls from their hands. I haven’t been able to do that just yet, not right anyway.”
Persephone scowled, “Suppose she’s hungrier than you?”
They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
“Don’t worry about it, come on, we should get back—”
trying? Quirrell could have had time to go up to the third floor but saw Snape going and then retreated! This is Luke Castellan! This a Luke Castellan story line, Hermione!”
Persephone did not know if she should simply dive back into the water but the sun seemed fairly early and as her logical brain started to come into play—the Weasleys would be up soon. She swam away, making a movement to push herself out of the water.
She slid onto the seat, sighing in relief—she hated the attention that her name and scar dragged to her. Feeling insecure, she leaned against the window seat, the Italian book propped up on her knees, watching the red-haired family on the platform.
"There she is, Mom, there she is, look!" A sudden, high pitched voice. It was Gary Weasley, Ron's younger brother and he was pointing at Persephone. “Persephone Potter!” He squealed. “Look, Mom—!”
"I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
“Professor! Potter’s cheating!” Pansy screeched suddenly and her nasally voice seemed to break everyone out of their strange trance while Benjamin strode forward and pulled the boy who had knelt by Persephone away from her as he made another try for her arm.
Something suddenly started moving up ahead—Malfoy froze, his eyes leaving Persephone for a moment, a moment long enough for her to pounce. She hit him right on both shoulders, pushing him down behind a tree onto the forest floor. Shocked, he struggled against her, but she was stronger than him.
The boys all stared in absolute desperate admiration, some having dropped to their knees. She stared in surprise, seeing Susan also looking captivated.
Flushing, he said, “Mum says it.” He put a slice of toast in her hand and guided it to her mouth.
“You’re nightmares,” Persephone laughed, her laugh echoing down to the entrance hall as they turned onto the grand staircase. Her laughter was interrupted with louder laughter that sounded too cynical for her not to recognize. She looked down and found an all too familiar blood head attached to a pale, green trimmed robed boy—his wand was raised against something small that his dumb goons were laughing at.
He raised his eyebrows in surprised, “Oh, er, I don’t—”
Persephone had never once believed any one person could be such an annoying nuisance in her life.
“What’s the good of a racing broom if I’m not even on the House team?” He asked miserably. “Persephone Potter’s got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year, with special permission from Dumbledore so she can play…she’s just famous, that’s all. Not any good at the game…didn’t even know about it before last year…” He spat in frustration.
So she knew she could control some aspect of water, just not in front of her best friend. Brilliant. It worked when she was alone in the bathroom in the dorms, but then Hermione Granger walked in and the water sprayed her in the face. Brilliant—thanks Herman. It was only when she remembered her little chat with Ben that she thought she would be sick to her stomach—she was not a mermaid.
“Mm,” He hummed. “Anyway—”
He handed Persephone a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat but
“Oh, no! Please, don’t—if the Durlseys hear anything—”
Most classes had been reviews and lectures now, which Persephone found pointless, since she understood everything. Thankfully, after impressing most of the teachers with her brilliant wand work and magic, she was allowed to simply study for History of Magic. She couldn’t concentrate a bit but it was still worth it.
“Sorry what?” He asked. She rolled her eyes.
in humiliation by the end of this year.”
“Alright Percy Jackson,” Ben snorted, dropping their bags on the chairs. “Feel better?”
She stared at herself in one of the other mirrors, one of the broken ones, and found that perhaps seeing her broken reflection was a rather accurate depiction of herself. She had no control over of how her reflection seemed to fade, in an out. She could only stare at herself, feeling her vision blur and then, walking forward, her fist came forward to break the glass of the Mirror of Erised.
And dammit, she wished Ron and Hermione were there to see how she was right—because it was not Snape. It wasn’t even Voldemort.
she smiled to herself. She threw on one of Dudley’s old t-shirts, the which she’d cut and sewn to fit her as a tank top with bare shoulders, like a halter top. Her pants were rolled messily at the hems, just slightly baggy as she’d sewn it together too loose, and grey, another pair of Dudley’s old pants. She hadn’t packed anything of her preferred, properly donated clothes—but she hardly thought Hagrid, the giant, would care.
"Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Ron’s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"
Quirrell snapped his fingers and suddenly, ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves around Persephone. She was bound tightly by the ropes that quickly solidified to some sort of harsh rock.
“Well, yes, because I am also veela, but more because I am more beautiful than her,” She said, shrugging. “She may be a little racist too—I mean, I am more beautiful than her veela and I had dark characteristics, no?”
“You’re going to take Divination in third year, aren’t you?” Hermione asked in almost disgust. “We need to go through this first before deciding.
“Lily—er, well, Persephone, this is Astoria. Astoria, this is Persephone.” Persephone shook Astoria’s hand.
“Oh yeah, Dumbledore is pretty common, I’ve got five of him." said Ron. "Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa—thanks.”
“I’m worried about Malfoy.” Hermione whispered, even though no one could hear them. “And I’ve been thinking. What’s stopping him from giving that letter to Snape, or McGonagall, or even Dumbledore?” She paused nervously.
"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Sephie. There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on—I dunno what it was, no one does—but somethin' about you stumped him, all right."
"How are we supposed to know which one is the right one? There are at least a hundred up there!” Hermione asked, anxious at the thought of flying.
Quietly, she read to herself,
"DURSLEY!" he boomed.
She was thrown onto someone shoulder and there was a chorus of laughter as she screeched in surprise, “George! Put me down!” She screeched.
Hogsmeade Village was not a place that looked familiar, for Persephone had never travelled there. Only third years and up were allowed to go to Hogsmeade during the school years and only with parental permission. She’d heard a lot about the place from Fred and George and even Cedric. It was apparently one of the only all wizarding villages in the UK. It was composed of cottages, shops and pubs. She knew of Zonko’s Joke Shop and Honeydukes, where the twins would bring her back sweets and show her pranks and such.
“Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present, the Marauder’s Map.”
Daphne pulled her wand out when it came time for the last boy group to perform. Persephone watched her, raising a brow. She raised a finger to her mouth in a gesture to keep silent and then she whispered an incantation.
“He may not be a pureblood,” She didn’t mean for her mouth to fall open, it was simply an instinct, “Would that be the family stuff that sent you to America?”
“I’m pretty sure my parents were married when they had me, thank you very much,” She snapped.
“That she did,” He nodded.
She felt so stupid.
And someone in the comments (Atousa) said something about Hades names should be Pluto since the Black Family loves names taken from astrology. As this makes a lot of sense, there is a reason that he goes by Hades instead of Pluto which will be revealed later on.
“Only that it isn’t a good place to be, most times,” Ron said, staring up at it. “Let’s go in.”
He bought Persephone a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Persephone kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.
It was the only broom that had done anything or the sort of spectacular. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.
“We are
"Three Chasers, one Keeper," Persephone recited, nodding again. She would borrow Ron’s Quidditch book. Or cash in that favor from George and Fred. "Chasers score and Keepers guard the team’s hoops. Right.” She nodded. “What are those for?”
As Ron and Hermione bickered, Persephone thought—magical school expects a magical unlocking technic…or does it? She bent down to the lock and pulled her bobby pins out of her hair, carefully trying to unlock the door with the stress of Filch’s footsteps in the distance.
"Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. "You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best."
“Do you think he got caught?” Neville asked, frightened.
“Perhaps you are part veela,” Diana said, linking their arms.
Maybe he’d have her collect Snape and McGonagall’s permission in written form. She hoped not, as the latter would be hard to convince.
“Pretty tiara you’ve got there,” A haggard woman said, coming close to her. Persephone jumped back, staring hard at the woman who made a swipe for her head. She realized quickly that she had never taken the tiara off her head.
Perhaps Flitwick favored her mother, and knew of the importance of the date, but he nodded to Persephone, “I have not a doubt in my mind that she would be proud to see you today, Ms. Potter.” He said quietly to her, as if not to raise any attention to his praise. “You would make them both very proud, my dear, don’t you forget it.”
“Exactly!” Persephone cried. She was glad Lavender and Parvati were occupied in Lavender’s bed, farthest from Hermione’s. Hermione took a seat across from her. Persephone reached around to untie the ties holding the curtains away. Now as privately as they could be, Persephone whispered. “Quirrell also was the first person to notify the teachers’ about the troll in the dungeons.”
“Or its Quirrell, running out of time because he can’t figure out how to get passed the protections.”
“It’s a game—there’s a siren that has to chase down the sailors and drown them. Not actually drown them but just hold them underwater for five seconds at least. The sailor then becomes the siren and the siren is the sailor and so on.”
She came across as very handy. And she was—she knew how to fix things, not all things, but lots of things. She had once been told in school that she couldn’t help in something because she was a girl and couldn’t keep herself from becoming mad and fixing the thing anyway. She liked proving people wrong—she liked doing things on her own. Why should she have someone do something for her when she could do it herself? Something broken? She could fix it—or she would die trying.
She pursed her lips, “I swam in the lake on a dare. I didn’t know that a section of the water is very anti-witch—it’s just lake water.”
Persephone counted the little bronze ones out to five and the owl didn’t hesitate as it kept still so she could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. She wasn’t sure what to do now. She’d given the other owls cookies—she ended up looking over to the cake, “Do magic owls take tea with their cake?” She muttered to herself, crossing the floor to break a small piece off the cake. She held it out in the owl’s direction and, staring in interest, the owl flew and fluttered onto her hand. Startled, she watched in fascination as the bird nibbled the piece out of her hands.
"Wanted one ever since I was a kid—here we go."
“Lily Potter?” Mr. Weasley asked, his eyes widening, “Molly, Lily Potter—”
“What?” Daphne asked sharply, turning to stare at Persephone with a raised brow.
“She thinks you have a disease, yes, we covered that,” He said impatiently, “Why does she think that you have a disease?”
“Amazing, the freaks match, can we go?” Draco asked coming up behind his cousin. She noticed how similarly they dressed, though Draco has a green handkerchief in his breast pocket. Then she noticed that Astoria had green flowers embroidered into her sleeves, and Daphne had green jewelry on.
“Wood will kill you if you faint from hunger—and then kill himself,” Fred told her, “You wouldn’t want that on your conscious, would you?”
“Hagrid?” Ron asked with her glasses on, enlarging and zooming in on his blue eyes like a bug. “What are you doing in the library?”
“I’m surprise you know what class is,” She said, finally getting close enough to snatch it back. She gave him a smug look and turned away. He tugged lightly on one of her Dutch braids and she smacked his hand blindly without turning. “Are you going to be at every practice?”
"You are
Hermione and Persephone headed into what Ron called ‘every wizard’s nightmare’, which really was just a cosmetics sort of shop. Persephone and Hermione each bought bobby pins that didn’t move from their designated spots and hair ties that took longer to rip—perfect for girls with thick hair. Persephone bought new gel and a new hairbrush, the newer model thank god, hers was getting cranky. It made a style last twice as long.
. However, checking her watch, it was nearly three now. No one would be arriving for several hours. Carrying their trunks, they reached the great oak front doors and knocked. Persephone shrugged, “What else is there to do?”
While she did this, Hermione and Ron had gone to the library. The three had taken it upon themselves to find out who Flamel was, a Hagrid refused to even give them a hint. They’d been spending every free moment they could looking but had found nothing. He wasn’t in
She decided against going to her friends and instead took to Hades’ comfort level—she found them an empty spot at the bar, “So if the ballet teacher hates you, its fine.”
This is what we call a compliment from the stage director.
Ron Weasley, freckled, red-haired, long-nosed, Ron Weasley was grinning at her outside Persephone’s window.
"All right, keep your hair on."
Susan came to stand by Persephone, grasping her hand excitedly, “He’s more handsome in person!”
Hermione was also very competitive, as the two girls were the only two from the non-magic communities in their dorm.
I've been thinking about the future of this fic a lot, but I just haven't been writing it...which happens a lot more than I'd like to admit. I'll have more to say about the chapter in the end notes, but for now, I'll be trying to update more regularly.
“Rubbish,” They both said. “We want you to.”
, the rest of the Hogwarts students arrived. The Gryffindors were surprised to find Ron and Persephone there, sitting as if though they’d been at school for hours. Somehow, news had spread from an unknown source that Persephone Potter and Ron Weasley had flown a car to Hogwarts.
He noticed her as she caught herself and nodded at her, “What’s up Potter?”
"Oh, in Diagon Alley, ‘course. Goes down qui’ underground—did I mention the rumour abou’ the dragons?" said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon."
“My legs!” She writhed against the shackles, grasping them with her sudden claws.
She blinked and was surprised to find tears slipping down her cheeks. She looked away, wiping her wet cheeks with her sleeve. "The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Persephone, and I ask you not to go looking for it again.”
Instead of standing there in front of him in humiliation at the situation, she coughed and started to stumble towards where she thought the right direction was. Instead she bumped into a knight and it came clattering down. She jumped, crying out and stumbled into Cedric.
She wore the diadem of Ravenclaw, she knew well what her feelings were. She liked being around him and thought of him when he wasn’t, liked how he spoke, how he explained things. She liked it when he stood by her and ducked his head down to whisper some stupid joke to her. He treated her like she always wanted to be treated, and she liked his smile, because who wouldn’t like his smile? She liked being the one to cause the smile because he obviously didn’t smile as much as he should and she liked being on the receiving end of the smile. It was just a general thing—but she
Before Dobby earned his freedom, he had been serving the Malfoy family, with Lucius abusing him endless. Only thanks to Harry's trick during his second year he managed to free him, he often wondered if the Malfoys got a new house elf since. Harry rubbed his nape sheepishly “yeah, he protected me to the end.” Now Harry found himself looking at his shoes, it was weird talking about death like that, especially with Malfoy, his feelings never really occurred to him, how he should probably speak about what he is going through more, he remembered openly mourning someone only after Sirius- oh great, another death on Harry's account, maybe he shouldn't think about anything, maybe he shouldn't speak at all. “He teleported you guys out of the manor” Draco went on, not paying much attention to his distress  “what.. um..”
“I'm not quite sure about that.”
"So you're into smooching terrible people, Draco?" Harry teased, quick steps catching up to Draco's long strides, damn his ridiculously lean legs. "You know what I'm into?" Draco turned abruptly, making Harry's stupid, stupid heart leap in his chest. He almost nodded, almost nodded enthusiastically up until Draco grinned, saying. "Peace and quiet. Which you're currently disturbing." Harry froze, frowning. If his hands weren't occupied by heavy books right now he would've shoved him, maybe he should've just thrown them at his face and left. "I can be quiet." He blurted instead, satisfied with how blond eyebrows quirked up with interest. "If my mouth is occupied." Harry said, surprised how easy said words left his mouth, damn. Malfoy froze, his eyes widening just a fraction before he rolled them, pale cheeks useless against his evident blush. "Seems like you're a little bit obsessed with our fling there, Potter. If I didn't know you better I'd assume you're right after your first kiss." He grumbled, cold tone contrasting against the pink of his cheeks. Touchè.
Please comment your thoughts on this chapter, it really means a lot to me <3
the art this chapter was made by my wonderful friend @ugh_ghost_account on Instagram! you should definitely check her out <3
“He hit you.” Harry said, and Malfoy let out a chuckle, though no humor slipped between his lips.
Harry shook his head “I didn't mean clothes, do a cover up tattoo or something.”
Neville didn't answer,but his eyes were focused, he was listening, so Draco went on. “I.. I tried to come up with excuses for what I did, but the more I thought about it I realized that I was pushing my mistakes on other people… my father might've been shitty, but the one who- who abused you was me.” His words fell heavy, cutting through the silence like a sharp knife with every word, he had never blamed himself for anything, even when he ran away, when he pointed his wand at Albus Dumbledore, he always had someone to blame.
I really love Draco's and Hermione's dinamic of friendly rivals, I felt like she really missed a sassy friend like Draco in the books so here I am starting their friendship, i'm trying to take my time to show character growth and romance coming with it
my mother to oblivion? being cruel enough not to kill her, leaving an empty shell of a woman who won't even recognize her son!” a memory of his own mother flashed in front of his eyes, hitting his face like a splash of ice cold water. Her warm fingers soft yet determined on the keys as she taught him piano, her loving voice guiding while he tried to follow his mothers steps, he hated that he thought about her during such a moment, was she still there? All alone in muggle London, her beautiful hands bony and without color, she waited for her son to return, writing him frequent letters, showing him how she's still here, hoping her son remembers her warmth even when he's far away. Draco swallowed hard, noticing how Neville's hand dropped from his chest, and now hanged heavily at his sides like two shaking bags of flesh. “It's not fair. For you to stand here, for you to laugh together with Hermione who you once called a mudblood! And with Ron… and Ginny! Have you ever wondered how they felt? For you to be alive and breathing while their brother died fighting in these halls?!”  Oh. He remembered him, that Weasley twin, he saw his face in the newspaper once, as part of a long list of names, containing rows upon rows of Hogwarts students who died in the war, he came across it only because he was searching for Crabbe, his name wasn't included in the list.
"Still think I'm a brat?" Harry whispered as their foreheads rested against each other. "Oh, most definitely." Draco snapped back, through he clearly struggled to catch his breath.
Behind him, Death Eaters flew in like a swarm of snakes. Their venom deadly, spells swarming of fang like wands, killing him.
Draco blinked a couple of times frowning “sod off Potter, I was already falling asleep!” He said, pushing Potter off his bed. “No please! Your common room is freaky and I don't know which bed belonged to Crabbe and I don't want to sleep in a dead person’s bed!!” he begged with pleading eyes, a slim hand grabbing the wrist Draco was pushing Potter off with, leaving him no means of escape. He jerked his hand back but Potter only held him harder, green eyes filled with determination “I don't want to sleep on the floor Malfoy please.” He wanted to struggle, he really did, but something in him softened, remembering those lonely nights at the manor, small feet tapping on the marble floor as he made his way to his parents room, sobbing to his mother after having a hideous nightmare, and how soothing it was so sleep besides her, feeling safe thanks to her warmth. Before he knew it, a sigh left his lips and he was already falling back into his pillow, shifting slightly to make room “fine just shut up.” He growled, pulling the covers over himself.
Hermione's eyes had an intense fire to them, so overwhelming that Parkinson took a step back
“Ughhhhh”
His fingers might've went purple, his heart was hammering in his chest
He kind of stood there, looking everywhere and nowhere in the same time, the office was filled with so many things it was uncertain where to look at, so in his new manner, he simply stared at the floor
some dumb creatures, you can never be sure these days.
“When you're a pureblood, you have no right to enjoy magic” Malfoy continued, and more than anything Harry wished to get back up again,
"I'm sorry- was it too much? I should've asked." Harry blurted immediately, stepping back to give Draco space who in turn coughed nervously. "No! no." He panted, taking a swift step back. "It's okay, I- I don't mind you touching me" frankly, Harry found it quite hard to believe. Since Draco's wonderfully flushed cheeks paled immensely. "Are you okay?" Harry frowned, noticing how for the first time today how restless the Solus on Draco's shoulders are. "Yes! I'm okay- I'm just-" he looked around himself frantically, noticing the scattered pile of books at his feet. "I suddenly remembered the library is about to close so.. I need to go, see you later." He blurted, immediately shooting to his knees to collect his things. "I can help you!" Harry rushed to kneel down as well, but Draco avoided his eyes like boiling water. Harry reached forward, taking his hand gently. "you don't look okay at all." He said, his eyebrows furrowing. "I said I'm okay!" Draco snapped, yanking his wrist away from Harry's sharply before softening with a sigh. "Really." To that the Gryffindor could only frown in confusion, trying very hard to push down his growing concern. "If.. if you say so." With a little smile Draco gathered the rest of his books. Harry said smile, but it looked more like a squirm, all of his facial muscles tense and uncomfortable. There really was something wrong with him today, was there a piece of parchment in Draco's pocket? If so, why would he be so stressed about it? About Harry finding out what it is? Well trained suspicion curled in his stomach, but Harry forced himself to shake it off. No, Draco was different now. They were friends, maybe something more. In spite of himself Harry trusted him. So no, he wasn't suspicious, just curious.
Can be delicious
"Draco, I have not much time to explain what's going on.
"Wait. What?" Was all Draco said, staring at Harry openly. "What what?" Harry grumbled, his cheeks warming up. He felt like he was talking to an adolescent, or worse, Draco Malfoy.
She tutted, “Best not be too loud for what lurks in the forest will hear you.”
Italy was exquisite. Despite only staying a few days in each city, Persephone soaked everything up. The first night, they’d gotten in so late and the jet lag hadn’t hit just yet so they got this huge cheese pizza—which, by gods, was fantastic. They didn’t sleep so when the sun rose, they were up a good seventeen hours already. Mary made the three of them wear charms that allowed for the adults to locate the three of them, with an added category of intense protection spells. Then they allowed them to walk to their first sight while Mary and her husband went off for their business.
“But that’ll get you in trouble, too,” Ron pointed out. Percy said nothing. “But yes, I agree, this isn't safe—she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on."
He froze in his walk but recovered quickly, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the five of them look up.
There were no pictures of her parents in her uncle and aunt’s, where she lived, and had been living since she was a year old, to help support her claim. Consequently, she did not know what her parents looked like—she did not remember them either. When they dropped her off and left her here, on the Dursley’s doormat, they didn’t think to leave a picture of them.
"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic—no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand."
She was sure she had everything—Hedwig was in her cage, which was shut tightly, as to assure her safety, Salem hidden in her pocket, purring as she stroked her head subtly, and she but carried the potted plant, which had not grown at all and all her things were inside her trunk, even her computer, inside a purse/book bag that Hagrid had gotten her that fit anything inside and never changed in weight. You only needed to know what you wanted to get it out, unless you just wanted to empty the bag, item by item. She would figure out a way to rebuild the computer with magic, if she needed to, because she had all her movies and shows downloaded on—she’d finally risked it and took to connecting to the internet. All that was left to do was waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Persephone’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Persephone, and they had set off.
Right. Sure.
It was hard to resist the temptation to scratch her skin right off but she had to—it would hurt more if she did. She wore thick tights and then pants over the tights to keep herself from scratching the next few days but it didn’t work—while she and Ron were in the library, listening to Hermione say something about whatever she was on about now, she tore her tights.
"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.
"Firenze!" The wilder looking one thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"
“Okay, let’s start already!” Lavender squealed.
“Cerberus?” Persephone asked in shock.
No one but the Gryffindor team and Ron, Hermione and Susan knew of Persephone being on the team. She was kept a secret weapon of sorts—and she trusted those who knew not to say anything but as the boy from her dance class had figured it out, so did the entire student body. People would now regularly come up to her to congratulate her and wish her not to die. And the latter had several different extensions—not to die by being hit too hard, not to die from falling, etc.
Suddenly, some people yelled her name, in the midst of the panic. Without thinking, she came to her senses and screamed, “We’re here! We’re here! Help! Help us!”
She felt slightly out of place, standing in the Great Hall dressed in black as students passed by, passing her strange glances. She was burning red with this attention, until finally, Daphne Greengrass came to her rescue.
She scoffed, “I didn’t want to be in Gryffindor.”
“I believe, to my short knowledge, that it may have been a panic attack.” He said and, answering her confusion, he continued, “You see, panic attacks come in very different symptoms and that was a catatonic symptom. Has this ever happened to you before?”
Their faces fell, “Oh, Lily…”
Put in chronological order, the first strange thing that had happened was that her mother’s friend from Hogwarts was her neighbor under the name of Johnson. She explained it was the most generic, normal sounding name she and her husband could come up with. Her husband, Reginald Cuttermole, was an employee of the Ministry of Magic in the Magical Maintenance Department, a department that took care of maintaining the upkeep of the ministry. He told her that people would tell her that it was an unimportant division but really, they are the backbone of the Ministry.
“Should be. Rich, at least.” George said, turning back around. “Dad talks about him. Rumor has it that was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.”
"Ready?" Persephone asked the other two, her hand on the door handle. They nodded. She pulled the door open.
She turned and said, “Sure,” Before spinning back and continuing.
Quickly, on instinct, she pulled down into the water, staring wildly at whoever it was that had suddenly appeared.
"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HER MAGIC TRICKS!" yelled Uncle Vernon.
“Veela. Native to Bulgaria. They are semi-human people, usually women with very white-gold hair and skin like the moon. They aren’t fully human, though, they have bird heads with a long beak and have long wings from their shoulders, when angry.” She told her casually. “They dance and hypnotize anyone who love women.”
Mrs. Weasley finally said, setting the rag down and Fred and Ron stared in panick while George stared at Persephone. All their eyes had widened, as had Mr. Weasley’s.
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
She sighed, rolling her eyes—what the honest hell? “I think I’ll sleep on it,” She smiled sweetly. “Wait, what secrets?”
It was a split, moment of impulsiveness, but she decided that she had to try it, tonight.
This was something about Persephone Aunt Petunia despised more than even her appearance.
“Persephone?”
Persephone pursed her lips before stepping into the crowd, “Dobby?” She asked out loud. Nothing. No cracks. She cleared her throat, trying her best to contain her anger and keep a sweet tone, “Dobby? Are you there?” She was attracting some odd looks from passersby’s but none of them had big green eyes. “Dobby!” She shrieked.
“I talked to Neville you know..that's what made me blow off on you.. er- if you've been wondering.” Harry muttered awkwardly, grateful that he's glued onto the ground for once, it held him down from running away from his problems, which worked. For a long while Malfoy didn't say anything, his gaze glued to the now pitch black water, they didn't notice how long they've been in the room of requirement and if Harry would've guessed, they've been sitting near the lake for quite a while too so it's no surprise stars had scattered across the sky like sprinkles on frosting, leaving them alone with the soft moonlight and the sounds of the night. When Malfoy finally spoke however, his tone was no longer angry; “What’s magic to you Potter?” Harry said nothing, just gaping at the blond boy besides him. What kind of question is that? Magic is everything and everyone, filling the world with so many wonderful things, filling Harry's miserable life with so much color and happiness, without Magic Harry would still be with the Dursleys, or even worse, thrown away to the streets. Magic is
Merlin, now he was all un-Draco like, apologizing? He would've never even thought about that, clueless of what to do, he wandered around the castle hoping that if he goes far enough those creatures won't follow him, with quick pace he turned around every corner, groaning when he found an another set of dark blobs already waiting for him there
“Enough!” He yelled,his hero persona not leaving him quite yet, and as expected the whole crowd was now gaping at him
“It was Bellatrix, she killed him.”
“Do not let that mark define you.” Snape's monotonic voice made that bruised part of his wrist ache a little, not like it hurts, but he simply feels it's presence, biting his lower lip hard, Draco felt tears streaming down his face the third freaking time today, shutting his eyes shut Draco sobbed softly
Hope you liked this update! I've finally reached scenes I wanted to make for so long!
“Good night, Draco.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It's okay for you to get help" he recalled Snape's words in his head as he made his way through the great hall, eyes, eyes around him all staring, making him feel so small- but he went on, determined, doing his best to ignore the burdening weight on his back constantly pulling him backwards
Their little walk came to a stop when both of them simultaneously turned to opposite directions towards their dorms, Draco was about to go down the stairs to the dungeons when he noticed, turning back to Potter awkwardly. “Er… that's where I go…” he pointed down the stairs and Potter nodded, shrugging “yeah, I have to continue through that hallway to reach my tower.” For a mere second them just being together felt so natural, Draco completely forgot their house differences, and the fact that they live in two different sides of the castle. “Well, good night” he said, not really knowing what to do when your rival suddenly becomes your friend, do you hug? Shake hands? He and Pansy usually hug when they part, would Potter find it weird? While Draco had his daily existential crisis Potter already turned on his wheel, waving “good night”  Harry said, Draco just nodded, biting his tongue so he won't wish him good night again. He lingered for a little while though, watching Potter's back as he descended, a part of him wanted to sigh, he didn't know why, and just as he was about to go down the staircase he noticed it.
“And now, we shall begin the house sorting” McGonagall lowered her wand as Slughorn brought a stool and the sassy sorting hat.
will talk with her, but guess that wasn't part of Hermione's plan
“but don’t you think like..finding out what are they will kinda help Malfoy?” Harry noticed how hard Ron tried not to look worried, he hated the guy even before he saw his sneering face,Harry was surprised Ron showed any interest in Malfoy at all.
“Please help me” he whimpered.
“Are you.. alright?” Potter did not sound gentle nor caring, kind of bored actually, Draco felt himself chuckle, dry and tired, he slowly unraveled his eyes his bloody sight fixating on the thin person before him
“Today we will be making a growth potion, usually used in gardening” slughorn scribbled down the recipe his neat handwriting filling up the board “ you have one hour to complete it, good luck!” With the clap of his hands, the whole classroom filled itself with movement, everyone grabbing the cauldrons and their well needed ingredients, Draco is great with potions, he remembers the confront he got from chopping down the ingredients, creating something new, something useful
Sugar, butter, flour, and a fuck ton of apples.
The pride he once had now has been splashed with shame, with blood of his own friends. Why would anyone want to see such thing? Such cruel, hideous thing?
Not only that his body was sore from yesterday's beating, but there was a actual pile of these black creatures on his bed, all sitting on him “what the fuck…” he groaned, burying his face in the pillow.
I'M ALIVE!! God this chapter took so long to write I'm so sorry you guys;; it had been exam season and I was extremely busy with school, sorry for the late update! But here's a 7k chapter just for you~ hope you like it!
“No.” She said coldly, snapping her book shut. “But why??” Harry whined, trying his best attempt in the world's-most-annoying-puppy-eyes Draco had ever seen in his life. “Because you're supposed to do it alone Harry, I've already helped you with your charms essay, you're on your own here buddy.” Potter just whined, running a hand through his mess of a hair, Hermione softened a little “oh come on Harry, it's not that bad. Besides, Draco is brilliant with Potions too.” She said, and he noticed at the corner of his eye how Weasley sent him a nasty glare, what's his deal anyway? He had no time to think this over however, as Potter shifted his puppy eyes from Granger to him “Draco! Buddy!” he exclaimed, and somehow he felt a jolt of annoyance swirl in his belly, together with a weird hot feeling gathering in his cheeks “me? Helping Potter? Never in a lifetime.” He said smugly, enjoying how the Gryffindor boy gasped “I thought I was your friend now!”
“Did Harry tell you to say it?” He said at last, Draco opened his mouth to answer only to get interrupted “I know you guys had a fight. Probably because of me, and now you're okay again. So Harry asked of you to apologise to me.” He stated coldly, glaring daggers onto his face, Draco could only nod weakly “Longbottom listen-”
After a long minute of clearly debating whether he should take his hand or not, Malfoy reached out, shaking their hands a bit awkwardly, Harry sighed with relief “that's great! Now we could- er, Malfoy?” Harry tried to take his hand back, only to realize that Malfoy has tightened his grip around it, not letting him go “um… I would really like my hand back?” He chuckled nervously, Malfoy no longer looked confused, his expression turning into a glare “uh… Mal-ah!” Harry couldn't finish his sentence suddenly feeling his body jerk forward with a pull from Malfoy's side, and before he knew it, he was falling face down into the water.
“I really am sorry Draco.”
“Nice sweater. Green suits you.” The Slytherin boy said in the end, his smile widening and revealing two rows of perfect white teeth. Harry gasped, his head snapping to look at his clothes. Right, he borrowed Draco's pajamas yesterday, which was fine during the night, but now when the cruel sunlight revealed him, Harry truly realized that he, a proud Gryffindor, was wearing multiple shades of green as his sleepwear which may or may not belong to an actual Slytherin, who was still lying on the bed they had previously spent the night in. They didn't do anything, Harry was just creeped out by sleeping in a dead person's bed, and sharing one with a very much alive Malfoy is a way better option.
He looked at the small piece in his hands, silently unwrapping it, it was a simple piece of toast, nothing too fancy, but it was still
Additional summary: 10k of intense hand holding.
“I was surprised too” Draco said honestly. “It looks so much like a scar.. especially now.” Potter hummed to that, his thumb rubbing his skin gently, his eyes mirrored how he was drowning in thought “have you ever thought about covering it up?”  Potter said, and Draco actually laughed. “A tattoo made by the Dark Lord himself? No magic could remove such evil, also, I'm covering it up the whole year. You know how hot it is to wear long sleeves during summer?”
“Me too” Hermione agreed, tucking a lock of her hair right behind her ear “ it's just… so weird when we can't help you, you know? We got so used to all kinds of adventures…”
“We're here” he heard his mother's head hit the soft seat with relief, her pale arms sliding down from the black steering wheel “driving a car is so exhausting, I don't know how muggles do it all the time” she turned around to face him, a tired smile resting on her face, Draco returned it,still not quite moving from his seat, her palm found its way to Draco's hand, sending a wave of reassuring safety through his whole body “ shall we go?” Unlike his father, his mother was asking, not demanding of him to do what she wanted him to do, and helplessly, just like he did with his father
“It's okay for you to be human,Draco.”

“It's okay for you to be human” he recalled again, taking a deep breath
Malfoy was absent.
“Don't tell me you've changed Malfoy!” Neville was screaming how, and Draco let him, as angry as it made him, he didn't really have any words to fight his accusations. “Don't tell me that all you've done- all these things you put me through are not as black and white!” His eyes were blazing fire boiling behind his tears, who were now pouring out uncontrollably “after all of this … don't tell me that I'm wrong for thinking you were a villain, that you were not the monster- that I knew…”
Blushing hard Harry looked around the room to find his clothes, finding them right in the entrance, damn. Blaise had quite the sight when he came in didn't he?
“What did you do?” Hermione replaced her silly boyfriend, eying Harry with concern “i offered him help” Harry answered, “oh, that's good” Hermione’s face lit up, she was all about helping those in need, even if it was Malfoy
Clenching his hands into tight fists, Draco kept his arms at his sides “no one is fluttering around me Longbottom.” He muttered, finding it easier to avoid looking into his eyes. Neville just laughed, a cold, dry laugh having no humor in it. “I can't believe you're saying this, I can't believe we're even having this conversation! You-” he shoved his finger harder, making Draco take a step back “you come to me saying sweet nothings! You're sorry? Yeah sure! You didn't look sorry when you pushed me down the stairs with those big friends of yours, you didn't look sorry when you screamed the name of the dark lord so proudly, saying how soon all of us will be bowing down at your feet.”
Look, I know it takes so long for each update, And I deeply apologize. This story is very important to me, but life keeps twisting and turning in such ways some times I feel like I'm drowning.
"Oh please, he doesn't want to get in my pants" Harry groaned, the way Draco kissed him yesterday said otherwise, in an annoying, arousing whisper. "Harry, he looks like he's ready to lick the ground you walk on"

Everything about this action startled Draco, why would Potter care, out of all the people? This was so unusual, so un-Potter like, Draco was so tired of things changing, deep in his heart he hoped that at least his relationship with Potter would stay the same, yet that jerk went all the way to offer him
“Welcome welcome!” Slughorn’s cheerful voice rang in his ears “it's good to see you all!” The old professor skipped to his board, leaning onto the thick teachers table “you are just beginning your wonderful year at Hogwarts! And I will be your potions teacher this year” of course slughorn will teach potions, after Snape's death there's no one else to do that, thinking about Snape made his shoulders heavier, shutting that thought he forced his gaze on the teacher.
Can you be freed thanks to a happy potion?
When they finally reached the castle there was no need for a clock to tell them it's way past curfew, they walked quietly through the silent hallways, dim candle light stretching over the stone floors making the boys look way taller than they actually are, none of them talked just walking together in comfortable silence, it's exciting, mischievous even. If someone saw them they'd assume they went for a night swim, sneaking out of the castle to dip into the dark lake, perhaps they should do that for real some time, with them being friends now and all.
Like a slap to the face Ron's spell was hard and cold, especially wet. Thrusting Harry from a beautiful dream to frustrated confusion as he opened his eyes with a slow groan, the warm sunlight of his dormitory making him squirm. "Whyyy" he whined, grabbing the closest object to him and whipping it at Ron, he missed. Damn, where are his glasses?
“He was a dear friend of mine” her usually stern voice suddenly softened, showing raw pain that had yet to sink in, such vulnerability made Draco uncomfortable, like he doesn't deserve to see this
I'll work hard to finishing the next update sooner, thank you for your patience ! <3
Draco seriously hated pie making. He couldn't understand how people did that for fun, especially muggles- who has to powers to cut down a dozen of apples? Draco, apparently. Since this is what he just did. They had finished the pie by Granger pouring a bunch of cinnamon and sugar at the slightly red apples, all stained from Draco's precious blood! Even though he absolutely hated every second of it, there were some nice parts, it really got easier after Potter took one of the Solus, who still curled up happily on his shoulder, life is unfair Draco thought, since these suckers are never this nice to
“You seem edgy” a dreamy voice woken Harry  from his daze, turning over with a jolt, Harry's surprised to realize Luna is standing right in front of him, right, the lesson ended and he was just about to leave for Herbology, not quite noticing the people on the way, Luna always delivered herself in a weird floaty manner, this time around she wore huge circular earrings made of a glass like material, reflecting Beautifully with her long blond hair picked up in a ponytail, with her wand and several quill's and feathers sticking out of her hair-band

"That's your name." Draco reasoned, Harry turned to glare at him.
“Ugh…” a quiet grunt could be heard right next to him, Malfoy popped himself on his elbows lazily, sleepy gray eyes not awake enough for him to grasp what's going on. He slowly turned around, and Harry noticed how messy his bedhead is, one side of his head completely smushed, probably caused by Harry's chest, which now lays cold without Malfoy on it. His eyes narrowed, as if trying to process whether the man in his bed is invited to stay there or not, and then dropped his head back to the pillow, groaning; “quit yelling...it's too early for that.” Harry gasped, only not realizing how raspy Draco's voice sounds, and if he didn't know any better, he'd assume Malfoy just had a
“Why?” Hermione asked, her voice stern
My Tumblr: AyuoChan
What do you do when you face a shattered soul? How do you help someone after being one yourself? Harry looked around his friends, they've always been there for him, supporting him through good and bad, Malfoy was no friend of his, which means he shouldn't be so frustrated, yet he is.
They just bonded, walking in their small group whenever they went, they would be safe that way, Pansy already sat down for breakfast, sitting in a far corner, funnily no one sat down next to her nor in front of her, leaving them a safe food Haven.
“Yeah, like any magic tattoo artist would touch me.”
Closing his eyes tight, it was silent around him, so he hesitantly opened them, seeing himself, a reflection, his gray eyes wet and tired drowning in the dark circles under them, his lips chapped and his skin dry with a slight green tint it it, his hair was a mess similar to his clothes, he wasn't sure why seeing himself like that was so shocking, so familiar.
He noticed 'it’ when he sat down with pansy, suddenly realizing that the weight on his back wasn't just the glares and the shouts in his direction, but it felt more physical, like something was
i hope you like this chapter, i had fun writing it
Hands that were meant to do wonderful things.
“I'd rather not, but I thought maybe…” he stretched out his hand more, Malfoy's eyes flickering between his hand and his face, Harry coughed awkwardly “maybe you'd want to be my friend?”  it looked like all the blood left Malfoy's face as he paled, his eyes wide. He said nothing, just looked at Harry's hand as if it was some kind of alien, Harry moved it a bit closer to him, because it was extremely awkward and also uncomfortable to be left hanging like that, for a second he wondered if Malfoy did that to repay him for the hand he hadn't accepted himself in their first year, he really hoped Malfoy's not that petty. Honestly he didn't knew what urged him to be Malfoy's friend all of the sudden, but also it felt weird if they weren't friends? Especially after all the shenanigans they went through while researching the Solus, even Hermione made up with Pansy, so why can't Harry do the same?
It takes a huge amount of bravery to be
“How do you like your cup of tea,Mr. Malfoy?” McGonagall said softly, already filling small tea cups with boiling water, Draco was in the middle of rubbing his ‘bruised’ hands, suddenly feeling very out of place between all the staring portraits “uh, with milk” he mumbled, immediately feeling stupid, he should be leaving, not drinking tea with the headmistress, but, she did make him do all this hard work… maybe he deserves a nice cup
Harry locked his gaze on the floor, shoulders dropping as he sighs “I don't know”
to heat up and his heart has to beat so fast he might as well be having a heart attack and currently dying. Of course Potter always has to be different, as if he's not so brilliant and important as he is, Draco's poor, poor heart might not withstand an another glance in his direction, so he didn't, stubbornly pushing down his own pants instead thinking about anything besides Harry Potter and his obnoxious boxers. A thing he is glad about though is that he himself wore a plain black pair today, so even if Potter did sneak a glance, he had no blackmail material against him, and Draco would always have a pair of bright red snitch boxers to his defense.
“Well…. Yeah…” Potter said “things happened.. and we sorta decided to be friends afterwards.”  He pointed over at Draco focusing everyone's attention on him. He coughed, reaching for a green apple in a basket and taking a big bite of it. “Yes. One of the Solus bloomed again”  at that Weasley gasped, jerking his head so fast Draco’s surprised it hadn't rolled off his shoulders, only to be disappointed as he's reminded that he indeed, cannot see the Solus at all. “So now.. two of them bloomed? That's progress! How did it happen?” Hermione asked and suddenly Draco didn't feel like answering. How could he describe it to them? Sleeping with Potter had been really helpful, he was too busy fighting over his blanket than thinking about what happened in the room of requirement, this moment he and Potter shared, Draco hadn't played the piano since it was taken away by the ministry, together with his whole life but then, in that burned down room he found the power to play again. Only Potter had heard him sing, that song from his childhood long long ago, one that followed little Draco through nightmares, which at the time were a monster under his bed and not a worse creature lurking in his house, splashing blood over the walls Draco once used to draw on. Somehow he only wished for Harry to know about such thing, about such details about his life, the ongoing loneliness inside a big house and a crowded school. He felt like Potter could understand him, though coming from a different place, though being a hero in the war instead of a mere coward, Potter didn't laugh and didn't ask questions, they shared a knowing silence together, a silence of two things who know nothing at all. He then took a second bite of his apple, avoiding the question as he chewed. “I went to say goodbye to Crabbe in the room of requirement, in its remains, at least.” He said at last, risking a glance at Neville, who stated blankly into his plate, Draco wondered if he had listened in on their conversation, Potter's words flashing inside his head:
“Potions is different than cutting someone's literal
“Well fuck off then! Ice prince!” she yelled, leaving the table crying, he would get up after her if it wasn't the weight keeping him glued to his chair, he noticed that 'they’ got heavier whenever he felt bad, pulling him lower and lower until he sank completely and disappeared, but there was other weight besides those damn creatures, there were the eyes, everyone cared to give him those angry disappointed eyes.
But seeing him now, curled up in such a pathetic state, Malfoy’s shaking figure made Harry's heart ache. Malfoy looked like he was in a lot of pain, which wasn't a physical thing, it looked like the blond was tearing up from the inside, only his Hogwarts robes keeping him in tact. The Solus were only the frosting of a fucked up cake, all on top of him, biting and nagging him, as if he wasn't through enough pain.
"Like magic?" He looked at her, his mind remembering the image of his father, and how his elegant wand fit in his hands. "That too, you'll do beautiful magic, and play beautiful music with them too."
“I'm- I'm a death eater.” He said,his hand gripping the sacred arm tight, reminding himself what's there.
“They repaired it quite quickly, the school I mean” Hermione remarked as they made their way towards the great hall, squished between all kinds of students, the golden trio tried to stick together just like they did during darker times, always there for eachother just the three of them ready to face whatever thats coming
I also wanted to thank you all for sticking with this fic for so long since this month it became one years since I started writing it, it's always so hard for me to finish stuff and not throwing it away halfway through so I am really proud of myself for writing this fic kinda consistently.
“Don't look so pissed Potter, you looked so tense I had to
a wonderful thing which he was lucky enough to experience in his life. “Everything.” He answered, green eyes meeting gray. Malfoy just sighed, his tired expression is now colored with a bit of sadness. “A wonderful thing huh?” Of course it's wonderful! Harry wanted to say, how dare Malfoy even question such a thing, magic is great, just sometimes it falls in the hands of a bad person, but that does not make magic itself bad, magic is never cruel nor violent, at least it's not supposed to be. “For me,” Malfoy continued, finally breaking eye contact “magic is a set of rules which can never be broken.” He lifted both of his hands as if he's holding a wand, practicing movement which reminded  Harry of an orchestrate. He closed his eyes, pale eyebrows furrowed in concentration, each movement of his hand was well trained, as if he's done that many times before. “Not a move out of place-” Malfoy continued to move his hands as he spoke, moving his hands so persistly you'd think he'd been cursed to to that. “Hold your hand not too high, but not too low, grip your wand tight, say the spell correctly, each latin word as if you're fluent in the language, never mumble, never waver, don't hesitate and if you do-” Malfoy dropped his hands, and only now Harry noticed that they were shaking, Harry's eyes widened, realization suddenly hit him.
Like meeting up with an old friend after many years apart, it's a bittersweet feeling that he knows by heart, and it doesn't really hurt now but he
begged Malfoy to let him in his bed.  Should he wake him up? Would that be rude? On the other hand, Draco was sleeping so soundly, he remembered how he caught the boy sleeping when they were brewing a potion together, there's something so soft about him like this, with all of his guards down and his cheek squished against his chest. It's like he fits there, to snuggle up against him- wait. He shook his head, feeling a blush creeping up his cheeks, was that weird to think about Malfoy in that way? He is his rival! Well, not anymore, but they  just became friends, and friends shouldn't fantasize about each other. Tearing his eyes off the blond forcefully Harry looked around the room,with the night gone and a soft sunlight creeping in he could definitely see a comfort in living here, green patterns on the beds fitting just right with the green-ish water seen through the round window, while feeling cozy and secure, it will never be as comfortable as the Gryffindor common room is.
But now more than ever, Draco really felt like being a dick actually, because it annoyed Potter, and annoying him made Draco feel better. besides, playing hard to get is way more amusing. Harry did not find this amusing however, picking up a fork he pointed it at him. “You will help me young man.” He said, trying to be intimidating but honestly Draco thought he simply looked like a joke. But something in Potter challenging him ignited a spark of interest inside him, Draco's gray eyes glistened as he leaned back on his chair smirking mischievously at him. “Make me.” He said, suddenly feeling the mood shifting to something more heavy, some sort of tension he could not get the grasp of yet, seems like Potter felt this too, since he shut his mouth tightly with his brilliant green eyes burning bright with challenge, or something else, that's a thought he should think about later.
“You are a fucking menace!” He heard Malfoy shout at his side before he grunted in pain again, feeling an another creature being thrown at his stomach “Mal’phoy- shtop!!” Harry whined, scrambling his hands to try and lift up the Solus off his face, he felt his pulse queaken as he failed to breathe, his head buzzing from the pain of the fall.
common room, which is warm and cozy, not like this damn hallway!” Draco spat at him, exasperated to the core. Shooting Potter an extremely ugly sneer he turned around walking to the Slytherin common room with quick steps, Potter just stood there, gaping at him for a second before calling out; “Malfoy! Wait! I changed my mind I'm pretty cold!” Draco ignored him and continued walking. Potter followed him looking like an abandoned puppy, whining like an actual kid. “Oh come on! Draco please~”  he scooted closer, reaching for his hand which Malfoy moved out of his reach swiftly. “Don't call me Draco.” He growled, but Potter, being the annoying Gryffindor he is, didn't waver.
And there it was, curvy thick black lines, though faded now, but still, as clear as day marking the shape of a snake and a skull, Voldemort’s mark. Potter did not ask before touching it, his careful fingers just brushed against the skull, trailing it's faded lines. A shiver ran across Draco's skin, usually the mark was touched only to summon
If only he could live his days quietly attending school just like everyone else, maybe imaginary creatures wouldn't be his problem, but the dark mark on his hand separated him from everyone else, black ink buried in his skin that had changed him forever, leaving no place for change, for growth, he will forever stay his miserable self, just with very annoying company now.
One was short, way too small for his age. But his eyes had the warmest shade of green. And that man smiled at him, opening his arms for an embrace.
let the pining begin my dudes
See you all in the next update ~
After the long and agonizing History of magic lesson, Harry fetched his two best friends leading them down their well known road to Hagrid’s hut
“ Have you seen the glares?” Pansy smirked at them, her voice having a pained ting to it,her dark eyes showing what they all felt,alone,and most definitely tired,they know they deserve such treatment but Pansy had a weak heart, she may be able to bully others but can’t handle bullying herself,  “how could we miss it?” Draco flopped into the chair besides her, using that moment to push off the creature on his shoulder, reaching to grab some toast, the creature didn't like this treatment much and jumped on Draco's hand and scratched it “fuck!” He yelled, failing to yank his hand away since the creature now went for his toast, pulling it from his hand, the other black blob beings pulled at his hair or ruffled his collar, all bugging him “let go of me!” He managed to pull his toast away from the beast's teeth, throwing the toast at his plate angrily, not that he could  eat it now.
This chapter actually supposed to have way more scenes in it and while writing I suddenly noticed that I passed my 6k mark by 2000 words!! So I decided it's better if I'd divide this chapter and put all the other scenes in the next one, I have officially started my last year of high school?! Hope I won't be too busy and continue uploading as quickly as I can. Also the wordcount is around 60k now?? Which is absolutely insane!! Thank you so much for keeping in touch and reading this fic, it's super dear to my heart! <3
somehow” he rolled his eyes dramatically but the eyes looking back at Harry were amused, which is much better than their heartbroken version, didn't change the fact that Harry was fuming though.  “So you just abused my trust like that?! Throwing me into the black lake?!”
Splash!
It has been a while since Harry visited the kitchens, ever since Dobby died he tried hard to avoid this place, the guilt swelling up in his stomach each time he remembered his friend running around in these halls, working in this kitchen but not as a slave, but as a free elf. And free he died, buried like an equal near the shell cottage, the soft sand being his bed. Passing through the portrait they entered the well lit interior of the Hogwarts kitchen, swarming with a dozen of house elves cooking and chopping, aggressively preparing for their upcoming meal. The air was filled with all kinds of delicious scents, cooked meat and spices together with the smell of fresh bread just being pulled out of the oven. Hermione breathed in the wonderful smell, smiling widely as she already stepped in approaching the nearest elf.
Both of them were marked by the same person, letting it define their whole life.
Two Slow Dancers- Mitski
“Potter.” He said, the boy immediately noticing him, with his whole gang turning over to look at Draco, all glaring at him.
“Well, you almost did.” Harry mused, his voice hoarse only to squeak like a little girl when Malfoy lifted the Solus in an aggressive manner, kindly reminding him that he could go back to choking him at any moment. “I'm sorry I'm sorry please don't kill me!” Harry sobbed “I didn't die for this!!” Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically, dropping the Solus into his lap. “You should've just stayed dead. Would make my life a whole lot easier.” and for a mere second, Harry agreed with him.
In his head there were loud sounds. He could not pinpoint them quite yet. As his vision was blurry while he rushed. Rushed as far as his legs could carry him. A few sharp turns, a flight of stairs. Draco found himself staggering through the dim lit dungeons. His breathing wheezing loud and irritating in his ears. Unable to stop himself he crushed to his knees, one hand pushed against the wall as he panted. He was certain that he was sweating, even with the stone floor chill creeping up his knees through the thin fabric of his trousers. And yet, he wasn't here. As if floating. Waves upon waves of nausea hit him as Draco curled up into himself and shook, his breathing oddly sounding like cries. "Fuck!" He sobbed, his trembling hand yanking the cursed thing out of his pocket; his father's letter. Draco's vision darkened and all that was left for him was this piece of parchment and his father's neat handwriting. Why now? Why when he finally started to feel happy? He tore it, tore it into tiny little pieces before throwing it down onto the floor, his hands shooting up to grab at his hair.
“Yeah!! There!!” Draco pointed at the growling creature yet Pansy simply rose her eyebrow at him “there's nothing there Draco.”  She said.
“Well, maybe they will call us traitors” Blaise said casually, finishing fixing Draco's tie
“I see things that nobody else sees” he admits
Splash!
Thus Potter broke the silence.
Draco might've been a complete coward, but he didn't kill anyone, not even Harry, when he had the chance to.
I can't believe we're in the final stretch 3-5 more chapters and we're done boysss
Taking a deep breath, Hermione reached out her hand, it was a simple greeting gesture yet it made all the classmates that gathered up around them gasp loudly, as if it was a peace offering between two dangerous nations
Thank you for your patience, it makes me feel like my work is worth something.
Draco slapped the teacher’s hand off his shoulders shrieking loudly “leave me alone!”
here we are at the beginging of the pininng and the character growth stay tuned for the wizard boys to suffer but also fall in love can't wait
He has has vanished from wizard society when You Know Who rose. But he is an acquaintance of mine.
“Draco, you haven't been eating well at all, look at yourself..” Pansy's concerned voice followed him during breakfast as he tucked a piece of parchment safely onto an owls leg, he can't blame her, he really didn't eat much lately, the thing is, he doesn't know why he just doesn't seem to have an appetite, all he can think about is that nagging, tight feeling in his chest making everything around him utterly uncomfortable, and even though he knew that Pansy cared about him a lot, before he could think anything through, he spat at her “oh you're not my mother Pansy, mind your own shit” her expression was pained like Draco physically took a knife and stabbed her, it was getting tighter and tighter in Draco's chest, his empty stomach turning over, gasping slightly Pansy glared at him with wary eyes “but- Draco dear please-” her voice was shaky but trying, trying to reach out for her friend who bluntly refused to accept any help “it is none of your business Pansy.” he muttered, sharper than he intended, Pansy did not give in, reaching for his pale hand carefully “Draco I-”
The weight he felt on top of him? That was Draco Malfoy. His long pale legs draped all over him, a platinum blond head snuggling into his chest, Harry let out a choked noise, Malfoy was bloody heavy, since in addition to a weight of a healthy young man, a bundle of way more heavier Solus all cuddling on top of his back as well. Which would have been cute, if Harry wasn't in actual danger of suffocating.
“Look at that! A war criminal failing to keep his pawns at bay!” someone called out, with echoing laughter to follow them, but Draco didn't bother to see who, instead, he got up and left the great hall
“Harry and Ron,I want you guys to make the batter. It's fairly easy, just make sure to keep the butter cold.” She walked up to them and pointed out the ingredients, sugar, butter, flour, and some water she got while they were washing their hands. She dragged Malfoy alongside her wherever she went to keep him from running away, and the boy made sure that everyone were aware of his discomfort. “Granger let me go I'm not a kid.”
Pain, am I right?
"Full of shit is what you are" Pansy sing-sang. Waving cheerfully from the table as Hermione rolled her eyes. "Tell Draco I said hi!"
He stomped through the hall unsure of where he could go where he would be safe- alone,yes, he needed some alone time to gather his thoughts
no matter what he did he stumbled, and everyone's gaze strictly following him
“O-oh…”  the light on her face died down, eyebrows curling in concern “how did you even manage to fight with him after offering him help? That's a talent I tell ya”  Ron folded his arms over his chest, raising an eyebrow skeptically, groaning Harry glared at his wand “well he won't be needing any help so, we can leave all the Solus thing now”  he muttered through gritted teeth
“it..it will..I guess” Harry scratched the back of his neck awkwardly, “we saw him being taken...you know.. Malfoy’s father..” Ron mumbled, his usually bright eyes suddenly darkening, Hermione took a deep breath at his side.
“Can you guys shut up? Potter was just dumb enough to run into Filch, and I was kind enough to let him stay the night.” Draco finally rose from his bed, taking his damn time stretching lazily, can't he see Harry is in a state of distress?!  Then, the Slytherin boy turned to Blaise, his eyes cold “and you would've known that if you weren't so busy snogging that Ravenclaw last night.” Blaise just shrugged but Harry could see a deep blush creeping up his face “whatever, you're late for breakfast.” He said and then grabbed his bag, giving Harry a wink before striding out of the dormitory.
"Harry."
But because it's the right thing to do.
“I am a someone!!” Draco whined, earning yet an another slap from Hermione.
Perhaps McGonagall was right, they
He rolled his eyes, frustrated at the fact that he's so close to his warm bed yet he's still here, wet cold and extremely uncomfortable. “To my dorminto- oh Merlin" only now he realized how weird that sounds, oh God he's such an idiot. “I- er- “ he mumbled, feeling his cheeks warm up in front of Potter, who still stood there, his mouth agape. “Jesus I didn't mean this in a weird way! Don't make this weird Potter!!” Draco snapped, stomping his feet hard on the stone floor in frustration.  “I'm making this weird?? I was walking to the Gryffindor tower peacefully until
“merlin Malfoy I'm just trying to help you!” Potter tried hard to stay calm, Draco was having none of that “I'm not some charity case for you to froster me Potter!!”
“Harry you're not supposed to be carrying my weight!” He exclaimed, not loud enough for their friends to hear but tough enough to make an impact, Harry couldn't care less about the tone however, since his heart did an embarrassing leap when he heard Draco use his first name. It was beating hard and fast in his ribcage, and he hoped that Malfoy wouldn't see the red appearing on his cheeks. “I want to, is that bad?” He answered as casually as he could, even though he felt like screaming and running a marathon through whole Scotland. Malfoy pouted “seriously, it's my burden to- hey!” He exclaimed as Harry snatched the apple from his hands “you're too slow, Draco.” He said teasingly, stepping a bit closer to him, just so their elbows would touch. He proudly ran his knife through Draco's stolen fruit, peeling it a lot faster than the other boy did. Malfoy huffed frustratedly but didn't move away, letting their elbows touch as for the first time they bear an immense weight, but decided to share it, just so it becomes a bit lighter than it was before. And Harry, though tried to ignore this voice in his head bugging him for the last hour, failed to push away the realization that already had come, standing in his doorstep and endlessly demanding, shouting for him to acknowledge the fearsome thought; that Harry, had long fallen for Draco Malfoy.
The hands that were meant for wonderful things.
But Neville didn't, his gaze fixated on the plate now, he was sniffing pretty hard, and Draco almost offered him a napkin but the boy bit into his creation. “It's sweet” Neville said, and he only shrugged. “It has a ton of sugar in it after all.” Neville chuckled at that, his laugh sad and bitter, but still a laugh “I just..miss her.. my mum” he said, immediately regretting it by the looks of it, since he took an another bite of the pie and made sure to keep chewing. To that Draco could relate, he sometimes also wished he could just stop speaking, but also, missed his mother with his whole heart.
"Harry." He said again, his lips stretching into a satisfied smile when Draco glared at him. "You're acting like a child."
For a second Harry wondered if the boy is still in the bathroom, considering the state he was in,Harry is definitely right.
They battered a nice pie tray and Hermione did the rest, rolling out the dough and pouring in the surprisingly liquidy apple mix, cutting the dough into thin striped and knitting them into a some kind of confusing pattern on top of the pie, it did make it look a tad prettier though. Now they were seated on an elf size sofa, all eagerly staring at their baking masterpiece, filling the room with a deliciously sweet scent. They had made two batches( which Hermione definitely did in purpose so he would suffer more than he already did) one pie for them and the other as a thank you for the house elves that, by Hermione's words 'so kindly let them use their kitchen’. Draco couldn't understand the whole kindness towards house elves thing, these creatures kept peering at him as he might stand up and beat them. For a second he'd get angry at them, but then remember that they're not too far from the truth, since by Potter's words Dobby worked here for a while after leaving the manor, he probably told them all about the Malfoy family had done to him. Draco was perfectly aware that his father was hitting the poor elf, but if he wanted to avoid a slap, he kept his mouth shut about it, sometimes even doing it to the elf himself. He clenched his fists, staring at their pie in the making.
“What the fuck?!” Draco exclaimed, his back pressed to the trains window “what are you doing?” Pansy frowned at him looking as if she wasn't seeing it

“You are a hypocrite you know that.” Draco mumbled, a desperate attempt to keep his head from reeling back to his terrible, terrible gay thoughts, he also pulled his pajama pants on before asking, he may have nothing embarrassing under his pants, but it still doesn't mean he could withstand Potter seeing it. “What do you mean?” He heard from behind him, Draco took his time to answer, the ruffling fabric behind him indicates that Potter had put on some pants, thank god. He slowly unbuttoned his wet shirt, not quite ready to expose himself as much quite yet, but eventually he reached the last button, letting the shirt slide off his shoulder, he could feel shivers running down his skin from the cold air of the room, making him hiss quietly. He was completely aware of Potter's eyes in his back, especially since the Solus scattered away from it and waited patiently on the bed as they always did when he got dressed. As he was taking his sleeves off he hesitated, knowing exactly what awaits him under the white fabric, taking in a deep breath, he took down his shirt completely. He clearly heard Potter gasp, knowing exactly what he saw; the dark mark. Still there, and it's thick black lines as ugly  as ever, quite fainted, but still very much noticeable, just sitting there, ruining a perfectly pale wrist, the air around them appeared to be sucked up by some vacuum, leaving a tense and heavy silence lingering over both of the boys. Before Potter could comment on it Draco said “your boxers are red.”
