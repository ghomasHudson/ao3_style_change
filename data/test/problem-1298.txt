Andromeda steps aside to let him in. “Not at all, but I should probably warn you that Draco is here. I don’t want any unpleasantness; he’s a nice young man, really.”
Sanaz had already turned away from him, but was smiling as she looked at her two nephews, Ahmad and Mehrdad. They were her sister’s children, but her sister and husband were visiting her husband’s family in Germany and thus were staying with Sanaz for the moment, to her obvious delight. Harry thought it healthy that Teddy should make more non-magical friends, and it was strangely convenient that he couldn’t metamorph currently.
? If he could manage breakfast, he should be able to manage simple dinners, as well. He put the thought aside, and focuses again on the child besides him.
And so they decide that Mrs. Picklewilly will start plying Potter first, and Hermione and Weasley would have him over for dinner a few days after that, so the information could have had time to set. According to Hermione “Harry needs to reach that conclusion on his own, or he won’t do it”. Stubborn prat, Potter is.
“Well spotted, Potter.” He straightened up, and stroked his waistcoat. “She doesn’t enjoy the way I dress to dinner, no. But it’s not that.” He said, in a quiet voice. Harry had finished binding the flowers together, fluffing the leaves a bit. He was vying for time, now.
“We see this occasionally, with kids that either have strong uncontrollable magic, or suffer from trauma.” He briefly glanced at Harry, hesitating a little. Harry inclined his head so the man would continue.
“I have a new little job for you, if you’re interested.” Swallowing another bread mass audibly, Lawrence turned his sharp brown eyes on Draco.
“I’m sorry, Potter. That was uncalled for” Malfoy says quietly, looking away. His jaw is clenched tightly, and he’s still panting a little. He starts rolling down his sleeves again, but Harry grabs his arm, right above his dark mark.
Draco pulls him up from the chair so they're face to face and pushes him back against the table. Harry sucks in a breath, and Draco gently bites his bottom lip, before pulling back.
Only a third of the soot is cleared from the wall studded with windows, and night air floods into the room, making Harry shiver. He rolls up his sleeves, and casts with a brutality that surprises even himself. Before long he is sweating, and at first he doesn’t notice the figure watching him from the doorway.
Hermione narrows her eyes shrewdly. “That’s surprisingly introspective of you, Harry. What brought that on?”
Turning to leave, Malfoy follows the path through the clutter, and throws a knowing smile over his shoulder. “I’ll see you tonight.”
You could probably use this fic to psychoanalyze me, if I'm honest. Having said that, I really hope someone other than just me find this sexy. I'm very new to writing explicit scenes, let alone BDSM, so let me know what you think!
He waits for Terran to realise, to back off. The picture is so jumpy it’s hard to tell, but it looks like he does realise after a minute. Draco moves closer, it’s too hard to see what’s going on otherwise. Terran pulls off and Draco sighs in relief, but instead of trying to bring Potter back, he does something that makes Draco see red. He takes off his clothes, casts the preparation spells, and starts to finger him. The bastard is kissing all over Potter’s body, stroking him, fucking him with his fingers. The picture is still lurching and swaying, and he wonders if Potter actually remembers this part at all. Pensieve memories are always more detailed, seeing as they’re retrieved directly from the subconscious.
Harry throws his head back, imagining it. Fuck, but it’s filthy. Something inside him preens at the idea, of being Draco’s so completely. Draco hasn’t even touched Harry’s cock, but his prostrate is being struck repeatedly, and his orgasm crests and breaks like a wave. He thinks he’s probably saying something, something like
The combined thrill of physicality and the ruthless need to reduce Malfoy to a puddle pushes all anxiety from his head, as he sucks and licks. He doesn’t realise he’s hard until he presses closer to take Malfoy further down and his dick presses against his leg. He gasps at the sensation, and the breath causes Malfoy to groan in a feedback loop of pleasure. Malfoy’s thighs are trembling where Harry smooths his hand up and down the fine fabric. He looks up. The man who had looked so put together earlier, like a painting, has come completely undone. His hair flops down over his forehead where his neck is bent to stare at Harry.
“If you’re instinct says baby, then that’s what it is. If you doubt every prediction you’ll make you might as well not make them at all.”
Then, Draco breathes. Harry is not rejecting him. Probably. Yet. That has to overcome any past humiliation.
“Don’t fret,” she says, shushing him. “I’m an old woman, Harry. Falls happen, strokes happen, it’s a fact of life. I’m not scared of death.” Granny smiles softly. “But Draco Malfoy is a young man, with his whole life ahead of him. I’m glad to hear he has time to live it.”
“Oh fuck, Harry. I needed that. I haven’t laughed like that in ages.” Ron takes a deep breath, and looks between their serious faces. “Oh fuck, Harry,” he echoes softly.
“Then you know she died in my home, in Malfoy Manor, and I didn’t do anything to help her. I know I can never make up for that, but I thought that turning the place she died into something that would continue her legacy, that might have made her smile. I used to make her smile, you know, when I was eleven and cute enough to make up for being so annoying.”
“You were upset, you’d just seen your mum. It’s fine.” Harry puts the kettle on reflexively. Tea is always the answer, if not the solution.
Harry looks at it in shock, but recovers quickly. He puts his hand on Malfoys elbow, and they disapparate. They arrive in an alley, separating themselves immediately.
The kiss is shaky and full of tears, but Draco’s mouth curves into a smile against his. Pulling back, Draco stands to his full height, and speaks clear and low. “
“Anyway forget about me, what about you?” says Harry, pausing to take a gulp of his beer. “You’ve got to learn how make a bookcase in time for her birthday.”
“Good morning. Are you going to let the demented creature in, or are you conducting an experiment to see if its possible for a ghost to develop a headache?” she asks, her mouth set in a thin line.
Granny thuds three mugs of tea and one cup of coffee onto the table, like a judge with a gavel. Harry watches curiously as Draco reaches for the lone coffee cup. Earl winds round his ankles like a cat, before hopping onto his lip.
Malfoy stares at him for a long moment, and then slumps, looking down at the beer-sticky table.  It looks like he’s decided to believe him. “If she’s a ghost, why didn’t she visit me?” he asks, voice shaking.
“Careful, baby,” says Terran, pulling his mouth away from his chest and leaving his fingers inside. “You nearly head butted me.”
“I dare say if you studied every book ever written, you would not find an event just like this one. The circumstances are so unique,” she says.
Draco pulls Harry’s pyjama bottoms down to his knees, then starts working on his own belt with shaky hands. He takes hold of them both, stroking their dicks together, murmuring to Harry the whole time. He’s not entirely sure what he’s saying, it’s just pouring out of him like water through a hole in the wall of a dam. Words like
“I thought we did talk,” he says, taking a sip. It burns, as always, but after the burn is the distinctive honey-sweetness.
Determined to take his mind off things, he sends Arthur an owl asking about the Manor’s restoration. He replies promptly, with a message saying he’s there now, and if Harry is free, he could come over straight away to draw up some plans. Harry puts on some practical muggle clothes, and apparates outside the Manor gates. One iron gate swings from its bottom two hinges, squeaking pitifully in the October wind. The greying white stone of the Manor looks like a broken tooth against the bloodless gums of the sky. Two figures walk down the long drive towards him, weeds pushing up through the gravel. One he recognises by the balding ginger head as Arthur, but the other figure is taller, dressed in black, with a suspiciously pale head of hair. Shit. Why wouldn’t he expect Malfoy to be there to make plans for his own house? Then again, Arthur didn’t mention him. Maybe this is another instance of Arthur keeping quiet until the deed was done.
Harry takes Draco’s face in his hand, thumb stroking behind his ear, and kisses him. Draco’s hips stutter, before finally stilling. Warmth pools inside him, and he feels a rush of satisfaction at making Draco come. And, without warning, the realisation comes that he keeps slipping into thinking of him as Draco, not Malfoy. When did that happen?
The waiting room is tiny, lined with chairs, and mainly filled with shelves displaying trinkets and odd pieces of art. On a coffee table is a copy of Witch Weekly, so old that Celestina Warbeck smiles up from the cover with all her original teeth. An old woman in a wheelchair enters through a bead curtain from the back room.
Draco tightens his arms, and pushes his dick between Harry’s thighs. It feels hot, and it looks red where it emerges under his balls, like all the blood in Draco’s body is in one place. Harry didn’t even know this is something people did, but he likes it. The body warm against his back reminds him of his fantasy, the one he thought of when Draco asked him what he imagined when he touched himself. This is better- it’s real.
The room seems to paint itself into life around him, brushing him back into the present. Harry clutches tightly to his hand, and when the silence lasts longer than a few seconds, Harry lifts it towards himself to press a kiss to his knuckles. So sweet. So kind, even after being reminded how much of a brat Draco was, how much of a coward. Harry just rests his cheek on the back of Draco’s trembling hand, his skin warm and dry, and looks up at him. He wonders what Harry sees. Now that he thinks about it, his face is likely streaked with tears, as his cheeks are itchy with salt. He hadn’t even realised he was crying.
Draco refused to live in a city, and especially not London. He had access to his vault now, and could afford to be picky. He chose a cottage, a rather twee looking cottage, partly because he thought it was ironic. He could imagine a sweet old witch living there, the sort who gave sweeties to children and knitted jumpers for cats. Still, he liked it, in a weird way. He wanted something different, too.
“I don’t know,” he says. “Sometimes I think he must do. Other times he’s so unbelievably dense I think a herd of Erumpents could stampede right past him and he wouldn’t notice a thing.”
She motions for Draco to make space for her on the sofa, sitting down and placing his head on her lap. She runs her fingers through his hair, and it’s like they’re fifteen again, like nothing can touch them.
Harry’s mouth hung agape, before pulling into a grin. It was almost worth being sent to the cupboard that night.
Harry whines, and Draco nibbles at his ear. Harry considers refusing, but he’s too far gone to be proud. He needs Draco inside him.
That was the memory Harry clung to on his eleventh birthday, as he sat in the window seat and looked out at the empty drive. It was a clear day, the sky stretching out like a bolt of blue satin. Still, there was little chance of a walk. Uncle Vernon maintained walking was for those who couldn’t afford horses, and Aunt Petunia felt that her constitution was too delicate. So, even while the sun shone brightly, Harry was stuck indoors. And while he had never seen an owl, he had read enough about them in Bewick’s book to know that they slept in the day time. This is just one of the few reasons why he was surprised to see one swooping down towards him to alight on the window ledge.
Harry dances his fingers across the ripples in the water. “I think you’re probably right. But how do we do it? What does it mean?”
She comes to stand over him, folding her arms. Her silky black hair falls over her heavily-lined eyes, her lips a suggestive shade of red.
“Ex-boyfriend,” he corrects. Harry’s not cheating. “He treats me fine, I’m just a freak who can’t handle a normal relationship.”
It’s a quiet corner of the Alley, especially in the middle of a weekday, but even now he can see a few curious onlookers.
He ends up talking to him a little, trying to show the others that this is all perfectly fine and ordinary, thank you very much. Which is bullshit, of course, but he can tell it’s necessary. Just small things like ‘Could you pass the peas?’ and ‘Oh I didn’t catch that match, Ron. Did you Malfoy?’
Malfoy slams his glass down on his table, in a show of mock rage. “Compared to a Weasley? I have never been more insulted in my life.”
Simi wanders over and perches on the arm of the sofa. “Sounds like you’re having way too much fun without me.”
A normal person might have stepped back after that statement, but Harry just leans in closer to the machine. Draco joins him, bending over the machine, and runs his finger over the curve of a copper wheel. The warm light illuminates his face and his hair, and his mouth curves into a proud smile. Harry thinks he’d quite like to kiss that smile. Draco meets his eyes, stumbles, steadies himself by resting his hand on something that looks like a silver horn. The horn belches dust, showering Draco in it all over again, and making Harry jump.
“It’s impossible for anyone to know everything,” says Draco, putting a big steaming mug of tea in front of Harry. He takes a burning sip. It’s perfect.
Only feet away from the entrance, the woman stands half-turned, a look of pure panic in her blue eyes. She pulls out her wand, and points it at Draco Malfoy.
“Lord,” he groans. “That is not an image I want in my mind’s eye.” Draco sighs, and wraps his arm tighter around him. “Well, I’m not calling you Harry. I may have actually made a blood pact when I was fourteen preventing me from doing so. How about a compromise?”
Hermione clears her throat. “Ronald, do you remember me? I’m your wife, Hermione- the one you’re actually married to.”
The toast pops up, making Narcissa jump. Muggle machinery still seems strange and alarming to her. “You need to let him know that you’ve listened to him, that you haven’t been going through the motions of friendship, but have a genuine interest in him as a person.”
He presses his palm flat to Harry’s chest now, and he almost sighs with relief at the contact. Draco’s hand is a point of heat radiating outwards, warming the rest of his body. Draco steps closer, and cranes his head down until their foreheads are almost touching. His silk-fine hair brushes against him, tickling.
They’re all pretty drunk, but Ron’s definitely the worst for wear. If Harry’s not mistaken, there might actually be tears escaping from behind his fingers.
“I could help you,” he repeats, voice lower than before. “We could work through it together, and you wouldn’t have to worry about ruining our relationship, because we don’t have one.”
Draco leads him down wide corridors filled with sulky portraits, and Harry finally notices what he’s wearing. Once again his clothes are muggle, a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and charcoal trousers, but the biggest difference is that he is covered in dust. The front of his hair and his face are clean, as if he’d given them a cursory wipe before coming to the door, but the back of his head and the rest of his clothes are coated in a fine grey powder.
“Up until then I’d always thought he was so wise, that he had the answers to everything. He’d taught me so much. That was when I started to realise that everyone’s pretending a little bit. Even Lupin was, even Dumbledore was.”
“We don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to. But, if you want to try it, we can work off of what we’ve already done. Last time I mentioned your praise kink- do you know what that means?”
“Yes, he did. Even though I had to pretend to force him into it because being read to is apparently shameful for a nine year old. His words were “If you really reall want to read to me, I’ll allow it, grannie” Oh, he’s so precious”. Her smile made her wrinkles stand out, the grey strands in her brown curls shining in the candle light.
Andromeda’s eyes softened, and she stroked his face. “Of course, sweetheart. I did too, you know.” She patted his cheek before releasing him, elegantly sliding off the sofa. “I like your beard, by the by. Suits you.” He smiled in gratitude. She flood home, and too tired to do anything, Harry went to bed as well.
“But-” he started, lip wobbling again. At this, Harry couldn’t stand it anymore, and leaned over to hug his godson again.
. It fortifies his angry indignation. Malfoy seems too caught up in the dough-making to notice his reaction, after all, his back is turned.
Malfoy grinned in delight, eyes gleaming. “Better yet, Potter. Only purebloods know this stuff. They can’t complain of blackmail in this ‘new and reformed ministry’.” He winked, and Harry’s insides squirmed again. “After all, they’re
“Harry’s godson is Draco’s cousin, you see”. Lawrence nods, as if he know this as well. “Draco seems to have taken quite a shine to Teddy, hasn’t he? He’s learning all of his favourite foods, I hear” Neville smiles. Harry can feel a blush creeping up his cheeks. Neville laughs. “Oh, I’m not implying anything, ” –he totally is, Harry feels-, “but don’t you think if Draco wasn’t at all trustworthy and a better person, Harry would let him near his godson?” he asks both Harry and Lawrence. Lawrence looks down to his feet, and shrugs. “Would you, Harry?” Neville presses.
The Wizengamot had granted his father’s reinstatement and re-trial by a small margin. A small margin, that Potter, blast him, could have swayed, had he deigned to be there. Draco felt his resentment grow. He didn’t want Potter to come to his aid yet again, but he still blamed him for this mess. Stupid Potter, with his perfect inheritance and his perfect house and his perfect little family, none of which Draco had now. He couldn’t even access his trustfund, which was in his name, because it was conditional on his being traditionally bonded. He had to scoff a little at that. Father had probably known about his
They were definitely quieter affairs than clubbing, but not in the least truly relaxing. Harry always felt on display. If the paparazzi hadn’t managed to follow them to a restaurant –a rare occasion, then one of the patrons or Marcus’ friends would always turn out to give exclusive interviews on what The Savior did in his free time. Very little, really, but enough to fill yet another column. Truly riveting content, how he would pick out the olives from his pasta! Frankly, if Marcus hadn’t wanted to go clubbing, Harry’d prefer they just stay in with Teddy, and watch a movie. But no, that was ‘entirely to common, not to say
The knot that had lodged itself in his throat since Marcus left two weeks ago lessened slightly. Perhaps he could do this thing after all, even without a partner. He swallowed quickly.
Teddy was up, feeling better after another round of potions, and had agreed to eat something. Not having much in the house, they had another “breakfast for dinner” situation. Definitely not what either Molly nor Mrs. Granger would have provided, he was sure. But, it was the best he could do.
? Me, the lowest of Death Eater scum, how could they not see it?” he spits at Harry derisively. Harry stands, angry, his magic flaring, cresting against Malfoy’s.
“What are you planning, Draco?”. He tried very hard not to approve of her insight. If it wasn’t for her sense of fairness, she would’ve ruled the Slytherin common room.
Malfoy looked at him, stiff and straight-faced. His only tell were his flared nostrils. He seemed to be breathing deeply, appraising Harry anew. Harry felt a bit ashamed at his declaration, but it wasn’t like he thought Malfoy would run to the press. Not with
Draco looked down at the file of information in front of him, willing himself nog to break something in his anger. It wouldn’t do, to make a fuss in the office, least of all over this. Lawrence had come by his apparment this morning, black circles on his eyes and a shit-eating grin on his face. He’d dropped down on his couch, put his booted feet on his coffee table, and scarfed down the breakfast Draco gave him. He’d tried to look disgruntled, but he was pleased Lawrence had managed to dig up something so quickly. He definitely hadn’t talked to his aunt yet, or she would’ve forced some food down him. Maybe mended the hole in the elbow of his shirt.
“Well, I didn’t know you were in the shower ducky, you might’ve warned me” she sniffs, and heads straight to the kitchen. “Get dressed, ducky, I’ll see you in the kitchen” She glances over at him, and she no doubt sees more than he likes, as he stands there in his towel, dripping and tired. “Why not go for the jade robes. It might even give you some colour.” She nods decidedly, and clacks away. He sighs, and heads to his bedroom. She might be right. If he wore anything too bright he’d be a washed out corpse, and black would head straight into decaying-inferi territory. A little coo warns him before Brighid finally leaves her perch and burrows into his neck, her warm body close to his damp one. He strokes her and ignores the claws digging into his naked shoulder. The robes he takes out of the closet are of a more traditional, double breasted style, with classic pearl buttons. Suited for spring, and definitely comfortable. Something he’s worn often, inconspicuous but dignified, and not at all like he’s given up. He carefully moves Brighid to his bed, where she settles on his pillow and keeps an eye on him lazily. She coos, and he can almost muster a smile for his silly owl. Finally dressed, he looks at his watch: 8:23. He wonders how Pansy managed to wrangle an international portkey so soon after the news.
Their meeting ended, and Jasmin smiled confidently when she left them. She was doing so well he wanted to introduce her to Lawrence: they would be formidable at pulling threads and finding out things. If only he wasn’t afraid he would corrupt her completely, he would’ve. But he could only deal with one nosey-parker in his personal life. If Jasmin ever got confident enough, he was quite sure no one’s secrets would be safe any longer, and that just wouldn’t do.
I should be re-working my thesis, not writing fanfiction. I know. It's just, my thesis is making me pull my hair out and I want to set it on fire.
Malfoy sits down for some semi-awkard tea with Harry. Neville has some wonderful news to share, which results in the inevitable fight between them. Although, maybe it's not the usual blond git, that is truly the enemy here.
And while Harry had of course gotten him more than the boots –like new barking-crup printed sheets, a bedside light that changed like the moon and howled in the morning, and a sparkling fireworks cake for dessert, he had still loved the boots best. He had tapdanced around the room belting at full volume “I am the realest wizard!” swinging his hips wildly yelling “Look at my swagger!!” twirling around with arms raised, beard trailing in the air behind him. Harry couldn’t just stand there, and instead had waved his wand and put on the gramophone to some ABBA –of course, Teddy’s favourite, and had awkwardly bopped along, grinning from ear to ear.
“Ah, yes” Malfoy leaned forward to inspect them, and Harry took another chance to study him. It seemed that today, just like before, Malfoy affected the magic in the room, bending it towards him. It took Harry an effort not to do the same, but he shook it off. He wondered if others felt the same about him. Perhaps it was just an illusion of that stupid suit. “Do you mind if I pick them myself, Potter?”
to make him listen. This is too important, it’s just- ” she clenches her shoulders together. Draco cocks his head. He’s unsure whether to include her into what he knows of Edgecombe. Judging by the disastrous conversation he had witnessed between Potter and Belby, there’s not a chance of them getting back together, but obviously Potter wasn’t over him. At least not so much that he wouldn’t be hurt by more news and rumours involving his former lover. It was one thing to be left for someone else, but quite another to be left for a real piece of scum, and still deemed lacking. He decides against it. He’s not sure how to use the piece of information yet, and is sure that without it, Hermione will prevent him from disclosing it,
I also want to thank those of you who left comments in the last few weeks, they were wonderful, and helpful too! I admit, I read them repeatedly when I was struggling with my thesis this week, just for encouragement.
“You don’t say”. That got a little grin out of the man. “Is Teddy going to be alright?” he blurted out, feeling safer asking this man instead of the brusque witch. The tired healer brushed his dark blonde hair off his forehead. “I feel confident he will. Do you know what Internalized Raw Magic means?” the man asked, finally standing and peering over Teddy again. Harry shook his head.
“How did you know about the cinnamon roll? It’s Teddy’s favourite.” Draco tried not to look smug; it had, after all, been coincidence.
“I’ll do something about that Edgecombe, you know. In my own way.” Granger looked up at him, a slight sheen to her eyes. He pursed his lips slightly at her hopeful expression.
funny!” she sniffs, rubbing at her eyes roughly. “These stupid hormones make me cry at everything” She exclaims, frustrated. Draco squeezes her shoulder. “Do you need some carrot cake?” he tries, with a little smile.
It hurt too much, and in that moment, Harry had known he was a coward too, and that was unbearable. And perhaps, he realized, now confronted with the Malfoy that came to Neville’s shop, that had the patience for tea with Mrs. Picklewilly (no small feat, that), that came and cooked for Teddy –and him, incidentally- because Teddy’d been ill and he was his cousin, that there might be things about Malfoy that he
been allowed. The house had to remain pristine, the walls of his bedroom a sedate cream with gold gilding, a terrifying state of cleanliness that had made him learn to mind every single step, every single fingerprint. The most wondrous thing, and the only concession his mother had made, was the painted, glowing, constellation ceiling. The very same as what he was staring at now, actually.
“Don’t get too excited, they don’t give Healers better coffee than the cafeteria, you know”. He smiled. Harry felt the corners of his lips lift. He decided he rather liked the Healer.
won the war. He still suffered from nightmares in which he was trapped in what used to be reality, pain and torture and all-encompassing fear. He settled on honesty, as much as he was capable of.
. He rushed down, shoes making loud noises on the wooden stairs. Potter got a spoon and filled a measure.
wards, even though there is no room in the body to contain it. When the magical core is overloaded or stressed, for example.”
Harry shakes his head. “No, Lawrence. I’m merely saying that given the same circumstances, I probably would have done what he did. Made the same choices, of which there were very few.”
“You have chosen excellent witches, mother”. Tippy brings in the next course, quiche with green asparagus, and they fall silent once more, eating in small bites.
“To get you a husband dear, of course!” she exclaimed, looking imperiously at him from over the rim of her spectacles. Harry opened his mouth to protest, but she cut him off, “or at the very least show that mr. Belby that he’s made the wrong decision!” she sniffed, and added darkly “Taking up with that tart from creatures,
“That doesn’t mean it’s any easier, sweetheart! I still miss dear old Dick every time I look at my jars of pickles, or when I accidently crack an egg too many for breakfast.’’ She smiled slyly “and of course, it’s much colder at night too”. She winked, and Harry managed a shocked grin. “So, we need to make a plan, so that you don’t wile away in that smelly herbal shop of Neville’s, and get yourself a decent husband.” She stated decidedly. “Not that he’s a bad florist, although I must say that when I was but a young witch, there was a florist here on Diagon Alley that - ”
Harry cleared his throat “I will help you, you know” he shifted back and forth. It seemed like his magic went a bit jittery, reaching over the counter towards Malfoy, as if fascinated. Harry steeled his resolve, pulled it back, and raised his eyes to Malfoy’s.
“She’s called Angie, you pillock.” But he took the sickles Draco held out, and went inside, making the doorbell jingle.
“I am not sure I could be convinced currently, mother”. Narcissa delicately places her fork down again.
Uneasily, he stirred his tea again, careful not to let the spoon touch the edges of the fine porcelain cup.
And I haven't forgotten that Harry and Ron are friends, or Neville. Or mrs. Picklewilly. Bear with me for a little bit, yes?
“It’s rude to greet guests in your pyjamas, Ted”. Draco thought it rather ironic, given the fact that Potter was literally wearing a shoulder bearing jumper and see through joggers. Moreover, Teddy’s pajama’s were rather nice and comfortable looking.
. They had plans to start on basic muggle science in the year before they were due to go to Hogwarts, and Harry was secretly looking forward to pouring over those books again. He had always had good grades in primary school, and science was one of the only classes were the teacher had actually giving him compliments.
The sight, after so many weeks, was like a punch to the gut. He wouldn’t floocall, he wouldn’t even do him the curtesy of owling, but there he was, standing on his doorstep.
He briefly fears it’s more hatemail, but then remembers that his wards are too strong; Ron had made sure of that. It seemed he and Potter had devised pretty extensive warding charms against pranks and hateful messages, for god knows what reason. He dredges up a smile for the little owl, and lets it in.
“I think Malfoy’s up to something” Harry interrupts Hermione’s excited chattering about the nursery. Apparently Ron had cooked up something with George that resembled the Hogwarts Great Hall ceiling, but paint-based. He’d snuck out of their bedroom at night to paint it, and the effect appeared to be rather marvelous. Neat bit of magic, that, actually, and Ron had started the whole project for Hermione, or rather, for their firstborn. She was ecstatic and impressed.
Instantly he felt inadequate, just looking at the man. His throat closed up, and he put his cup down to keep mrs. Picklewilly from seeing his hands shaking.
Malfoy had inherited most of the Malfoy fortune and assets after his father had been locked away, due to his being the only legal heir. He wondered what this meant, Lucius’ appeal. What did Malfoy stand to lose? Then another thought popped into his head.
He can see the instant Malfoy spots him. He visibly pulls himself together, taking on the sharp, coldly distant appearance he displays to the public. It’s a little unnerving, seeing the two side by side.
” on stained parchment, which came by delivery owl just yesterday. No mention on that dirty scrap of paper of Harry’s previous owls, asking what had gone wrong, what Harry could do better, or even his desperate attempts to lure him back with his remaining posessions. The house could wait, at least until Harry wasn't so bloody exhausted all the time anymore. When the rooms didn't feel like broken visions of lovely future anymore.
“Your godson was found next to a Boggart, and he has a history of trauma. Not unusual for a war-oprhan, I’m afraid. The burst of magic brought on by his fear and protective instincts overloaded the system, and his magic started eating away at his core.” the Healer grimaces.
The young man turns to Neville, recognition in his eyes. His posture was less angry, but still clearly upset.
“Yes, Potter?” he asks innocently. He sticks his hands again in the soapy water, the clean lemon smell rising in the air.
“And, ehm, what do you correspond about, exactly?” he ventures hesitantly. Mrs. Picklewilly gives him a little smile, which looks entirely too sharp in her face.
The muggle girl behind the counter smiled at him when he placed his order. “Got a sweet tooth, sir?” she asked lightly. She was pretty, with her dark hair in a ponytail, tan skin glowing, smile wide and friendly. Her nametag read ‘Sanaz’. He smiled back faintly. ”Pregnant friend, more like” he grumbled back, though not unkindly. She laughed at that answer. “Oh, don’t look so miserable. She’s lucky to have you as a friend, bringing her pastry”. He took his pastry bag, already looking forward to tea with a cinnamon roll. “Believe me, I’m lucky to have her.” But she had already turned to the next customer, who was loudly demanding she hurried up.
He never cares to make his own lunch, or dinner even. He really only makes an effort for Teddy, and Teddy often doesn’t mind cereal for breakfast and dinner. Plus, Teddy’s also too young to comment on Harry picking at his food while he eats himself. He sighs, and rubs his stomach. He knows he’s lost weight in the last months, and suspects it would be worse if Hermione hadn’t dragged him off for cake all the time. And then Malfoy, all of a sudden, dropping by and cooking. He even had the audacity to prepare meals and stick them in the fridge. Every morning, while taking out the milk for Teddy, he was faced with neat little rows of Tupperware boxes, labeled in precise, cramped handwriting. ‘
An idea strikes him suddenly, and he takes out a little pot, some milk, and cacao powder. After some rummaging around, he manages to find some vanilla and maple syrup, and sets to work while he charms the towel to dry the remaining dishes. After a few minutes, he pours the chocolate milk into a mug –obviously handmade, a bright blue monstrosity dotted with yellow and brown blobs, perhaps designed by Teddy- and turns around only to discover that Potter has fallen asleep on the couch.
they decided to marry, not in any way apologizing for her daughters' lack of household skills, and being
“Dear, I hear wonderful things about the work you and miss Granger do at your department. I wish you would tell me more about it.’’ Draco fought not to raise an eyebrow, and sipped his tea slowly. Too sweet, and already tepid. Knowing very well his mother only liked his job insofar as it improved their family name, he knew his mother bringing it up must serve another purpose.
Molly shook her head, “no, Hermione wasn’t feeling well this morning, apparently she got sick halfway through the floo trip. Poor dear.” Harry nodded, and resolved to call them later. “Ron will at least try to make it later, for Teddy’s proper party”, she added. “The others should be here then too, for now we should at least try to have a regular school day,”  -peals of laughter came from the kitchen, followed by a giant CRASH and SPLAT! “or at least try not to ruin all the cakes before the party”, she added dryly.
He’d taken one look at the lovely, blushing, frilly robes wearing Miss. Rosewood, and removed himself from the restaurant. It wasn’t as if he rejected them for merely being female; they couldn’t do anything about his preferences, and he would maybe set them aside for family's sake –although he hadn’t decided on that yet.
“Do be more specific, Draco.” Her tone was a bit sharp. Hermione lost her patience when she was tired, he knew.
“If you tell grandma Molly, will she make another cake?” he asked seriously, looking imploringly at Hermione.
I admit, I'm so tired that I am sure there will be mistakes in this one, more than in previous chapters. I apologize.
“I cursed a student with a curse so dark, he should have died from it. That was Malfoy”. Lawrence nods, and mutters “I’ve seen the scars”. Harry raises an eyebrow. He hadn’t known there were still scars. His chest feels sore.
Mrs. Picklewilly, even if she was nosy. This week had been going so well. “I can’t believe that he dared to take up with that other fellow, that gentleman from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, you know, the one with the long brown hair.
. He could feel Lawrence practically buzzing with excitement. They were almost to the door when from behind, a crooning voice came “Oh, is that you, young mr. Malfoy?” Draco whipped his head around so fast his neck cricked.
It felt like a can of worms was slowly wriggling its way into his stomach, yet again. He suddenly wasn’t at all annoyed that Teddy had stolen his toast –he wouldn’t be able to eat it anyway, now.
“I’m fine, you know. It saves me having to shave twice a day, and it’s not like Neville cares.” He sat down, and poured himself some tea. He briefly wondered how often he had said he was 'fine' to them in the past three weeks. A heavy silence fell over the table, only broken by Ron's munching and Teddy's occasional hums. Hermione cleared her throat.
“He’s… It’s really none of your business”, he answers, catching himself. He doesn’t need to explain himself to Marcus. He’s not the one who left him for someone else, who suggested he quit his job.
“I wanted to check up on how the preliminary report was coming along, miss. Lacewell”. She flushed and turned to her piles of paper on the desk.
“Enjoy your delivery.” Harry said, with a beautific smile. It cost him, it sure did. But he could see the polite nod cost Edgecombe more. Putting the flowers down on the closest surface, he hid his shaking hands by fisting them, and quickly made his exit.
“It’s okay if you have questions or doubts. But don’t feel like you don’t know your friend, because he hasn’t explained his whole past to you.”
“Godric yes, any day now, and blaming me for it.” He smiled fondly, obviously besotted. Draco tried very hard not to be jealous. While he didn't really want a pregnant wife -Merlin knows his mother would have jumped at the chance-, Neville and Hannah's sweet domesticity did stir some tender feelings in him. Which he subsequently tried to squash, since even reformed Death-Eathers couldn't have such things. He gave Neville a genuine smile.
Neville snorts in laughter. Harry feels a bit wrongfooted, but also pleased. It seemed Malfoy really wasn’t out to get him, and this just proved it. At last, the tension seeps from Lawrence’s frame, and the conversation turns to Teddy. Harry learns little of who this young man actually his, but he can’t help but like him. Something about him is familiar, in his sharp questions, his eagerness to know things.
“I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about.” he answered therefore, trying not to look like he was enjoying this.
Harry takes a look at Teddy, who seems already fast asleep, and sighs. “Fine, then. Come along” he moves, waits by the door to let Malfoy through first. No matter how many times Hermione says he’s harmless (she says he’s ‘truly a kind person, Harry’, but that description doesn’t bear thinking of), he doesn’t want Malfoy alone with Teddy, asleep.
He eats lunch at his desk, ignorning the well-mannered snob living in his head insisting that it is crass, prepared some reports for Hermione, and then gets up to take Hermione to their next meeting.
The prickling turned out to be a stinging hex. By the time lunch rolls around, he’s disabled three stinging hexes, two knee-reversal spells, a tarantallegra, and a very nasty itching powder, which he’d nearly gotten all over himself. Meanwhile, every half hour or so, more would come in. “This is ridiculous!” he mutters. He couldn’t waste his whole day dealing with mail! He gets up, fixes his hair, and goes up to the department of Mail and Communication.
floor. His territory, and he watched it like a hawk. Would protect it fiercely too, which it would come to soon, when their newest plans would be presented.
“Hmm. Bore me to tears with your conversational skills, clearly. And rob Mrs. Picklewilly of her best fruitcake, as I hear it.”
“Sure, Potter. Just let me finish this first, yes?” and he gestures to the sink awkwardly. Potter sighs, and seems to take him at his word, plopping down on the little sofa and turning up the wireless a little. There’s a Weird Sisters reunion special playing, and Draco hums along with the tunes he knows. He doesn’t see Potters eyes lingering on him.
“Right-o, Ted. Let’s get this banana bread in the oven.” He used his wand to fold the mixture, poured it into a cake-mold, then put it in the preheated oven. Teddy was already dancing away, having found some flags lying around in the kitchen and waving them, his pink hair flopping in all directions.
They had been trying to build a wider network of Non-Magical Members of Wizarding society: Muggle families with Magical children, and Squibs. In the department they all took took turns talking to families, engaging them in conversation. For starters, they wanted to ease the transition from Muggle family life to having children go to Hogwarts, as well as helping to ease the strain of accidental Magic. It was one of their longest running projects, and started with Hermione herself going to people she knew, convincing her parents to help. They too, had felt so out of place, not knowing how to help their daughter. In the reverse, this was happening to Melany and Parvati as well, having a Squib son and wondering how best to help him, love him, when he was going to venture in a world they didn’t know. “Disruptors of public order”
“She’s trustworthy, if that’s what you’re asking” he says a bit tersely. “And no, I don’t make it a habit to concern myself overly with Potter.” He scoffs.
The baby’s breath was enchanted to sing a variety of songs, and customers were able to choose what songs they sang. Malfoy nodded appreciatively.
And so, muggle clubnights were out, soirees were in, Teddy was dropped off at Andromeda’s for a sleepover, and Saturday brunches became a regular. Harry always cooked them breakfast, of course, since Marcus couldn’t and Harry didn’t feel right making Ron or, god forbid-, Hermione cooking. She was absolutely brilliant, but still a terrible cook –driving Molly to teach Ron the family recipes “before marriage!” instead of Hermione.
The Wizengamot had argued well into the night about his father’s appeal, finally coming to a decision after three rounds of voting, at exactly 4:38 this morning. It was all over the newspapers, of course, though Blaise had shielded him from it. The Ministry had, however, sent him a letter regarding the decision. He knew that his mother had gotten a similar letter than he: she as Lucius’s next of kin, Draco as his Heir.
, don’t you realize, you as the Savior, the Boy Who Lived –despite being oblivious, might I add, Merlin knows how you managed, holder of the Seat of the Black and the Potter families in the Wizengamot, are still quite the only thing driving progressive laws and reforms!” Harry felt his mouth drop open again.
could be that forgettable. It was making him more upset to think about, and he swallowed a couple of times.
had an excellent reputation for discretion – one of the reasons he chose to dress Hermione with robes from this particular shop. They could talk work and not have their conversations blabbed about to The Prophet, or other such rags. But what he could sense coming now was far more personal.
“Well, alright then. No need to get all defensive.” He eyed her suspiciously, and reminded himself that he
“Oh shush, that’s not true! To be fair, I don’t even really know how he’s coping. He’s always running around and smiling like he’s dealing, and meanwhile he’s getting skinnier and grown a beard!” she exclaims, exasperated. Draco laughed.
“Wanna cook dinner before your dad finds out I’m here?” he asks the boy, and his eyes light up. “You can cook?” he asks in wonder.
“Well, that would explain all the long lunches she takes without me. I’ve limited her carrot-cake consumption to twice a week, you know. I’m trying to be responsible or I’ll get Weasley on my back”. Harry grinned again. “Well, he’s not much better. He gets her anything she wants.”
“It’s just!” she started, and Draco discreetly muffliato’d their corner of the shop. Better safe than sorry, even if
“Harry”, he interrupted again, and smiled. The healer inclined his head, his hair flopping over his forehead.
Potter seats-, their majority was extremely uncertain. Moreover, he wouldn’t be able to have access to the other Wizengamot members, not without lengthy administrative processes. “Salazar” he manages to say. Hermione reaches over to take his hand, and he squeezes it.
“Draco? Don’t we have an appointment with Hermione?” came a clear, high voice from the door. He looked up. Jasmin stood in his doorway, a bit uncertain, fidgeting with the braid hanging over one shoulder. “Miss Lacewell. Yes, thank you. Go ahead, I’ll be right with you.” He quickly shuffled the papers back into plastic folder he got from Lawrence –Muggle, with a fat yellow teddybear on the front eating honey, and sealed it magically.
“Well, we are. Neville and I….” Malfoy takes a deep breath. “We came to an understanding even before Hermione and I did” he finishes, looking like someone had just pulled out some of his fingernails. Huh. This was news to Harry. Neville never said, just treated Malfoy cordially whenever he came into the shop.
“A little cloud of milk, please.” Potter made him his tea, adding even more milk to Teddy’s, and put it in front of them. Then he took his own pitch-black concoction, and finally sat down. He looked worn and in a bad mood.
It started with Neville’s owl at breakfast, which included the day’s Prophet. Harry had just given up on convincing Teddy to wear matching socks, and instead tried to get him to eat his oatmeal, when an owl started pecking at the window.
your dad.” Teddy was rigid in his chair. His clenched hands were wringing back and forth. “But! Aren’t you?” Teddy’s voice gained in pitch and volume. “You do everything Bill does for Victoire, and he’s
“What?” asked Malfoy. “Am I not allowed to have tea before starting dinner, like a common house elf?” he sneers.
“I have home addresses of them”, he offered. He knew most of the conservative members from old, had had to study their family trees since he was little. The Malfoy’s had even intermarried with many of them throughout the centuries, although no one wanted to admit that now, of course.
“What?” he splutters, as best he can, while his lips are crusted with cinnamon sugar. He grabs a napkin, hoping to retain some of his dignity. Always difficult when Pansy’s around, he must say.
“Come in!” Comes her voice from inside. She’s bent over, her curly hair already fizzling out of her bun, but still looking sharp in her navy pantsuit, opals glittering in her ears, eyes sparkling with furor as she pours over the documents spread out before her.
“What are you doing here, Marcus?”. Marcus turns around, looking as charming as ever. He doesn’t look like he went through a breakup at all. But then, he’d already found a replacement, hadn’t he?
, than Belby probably knew. He was sleeping with some of the wives of the other pureblood conservatives.
-barrier from the windows. Neville smiled and looked relieved. He straightened up a bit, and said politely “Sir, could you please make room for any real customers coming through? We have a strictly no-reporters policy today, I’m afraid.”
“Hello, Harry. We went to your Muggle supermarket, Fresco’s or something? If you both help unpack we can start cooking rightaway. We can make pot pies with the chicken stew, that’ll be quick”.  He nodded at the suggestion.
Well, ex-Auror, officially, but he still had all of those skills. He could transfigure his face into someone else’s, so he wouldn’t be recognized. He could, and then he would be just another delivery Wizard. But his Gryffindor courage, and hell, his
Andromeda came home with a hungry Teddy, carrying groceries and looking a little worn, even if she was smiling brightly. Harry had
?”. Malfoy laughed, out loud, a light and joyous sound. Harry wondered if he had ever heard it before, and decided he mustn’t have; he would have remembered.
Harry sighs, but the moment he opens his mouth to argue back –and he definitely was going to, by his facial expression, the floo in the back flares to life, chiming urgently.
“Correct”. Harry says, putting down his tea, and scratches at his beard. It was getting a bit too long, these days.
. Like he’d been standing in a baker’s kitchen –and, of course, of foliage and dirt. It was odd, but rather nice.
“Well, I see nothing’s changed here, then.” He murmered, smiling a little at Harry. “No time to redecorate, even after quitting?” he asks, winking.
Malfoy snorted inelegantly. “If you would have paid any attention, Potter, I wanted to express my extreme disappointment in someone. Although it looks like I might have to buy you the same bouquet”.
“Are you just going to state the obvious?” he smirks. Malfoy stands up, and starts cleaning his own cup.
At least Lawrence hadn’t cottoned on to the fact that Belby was Potter’s ex, even if he now knew the name, although that couldn’t last long. Then he would be back, with his shit-eating grin, putting his boots on Draco’s couch and asking all about the wizarding hero that everyone knew about and that he found ‘roguishly handsome, if you’re into that sort of thing’. And then he would wink at Draco, meaningfully. Draco groaned. He should have
“Ted, is this revenge for the potions? Can we have a truce already?” he starts pleading jokingly, and Teddy smiles beautificially at Potter. Potter sighs again, but can't halt a smile. “I should tell you off, you know. I'm not sure the shower will ever recover from the mushrooms” He adds. Teddy has never looked so angelic as in this moment, on the stool with shaker in hand, large eyes gleaming. Potter groans again, and he meets Draco’s eyes, who is utterly bemused.
People recognizing him on the street wasn’t unusal, but the ones who wished him well were still quite few. He preferred not to have confrontations out in broad daylight. He peered at the source of the voice, and saw a rather harmless-looking elderly lady in flowery robes standing in the doorway of “Pot, Kettle, Pickle”, the crockery shop across the street. She tapped her foot impatiently.
father, was he? How could he be so central to Teddy’s existence? After all, he was still just Harry.
“Let’s go somewhere to talk. Apparition okay with you?” Draco asked him, and held out his royal blue clad arm.
.’’ He mocks again. Now he had gotten her approval, he could carry on more easily. Wooing Potter to the function, back into politics, all the while re-establishing family ties. It couldn’t possibly be more perfect. He had already planned to drop by the market on his way home.
I didn't want to leave you with more angst -trying times, these are, but at least there is finally some plot going on.
, and he wards the door. He’ll owl Neville the unlocking spell, later. Or leave Potter to it. He used to be an Auror, after all. Surely he could deal with a standard warding spell.
“Ehm,” Harry started, “don’t flowers usually mean positive things?” he asked, “Like love, or an apology, or get well soon?”. He had no clue about ‘disappointment flowers’. Did they actually exist? If Malfoy wanted to buy some sort of rotten black roses or other dramatic shit, he was
“Fine, Malfoy. Want to pick them out yourself?”. Harry came out from behind the till and led Malfoy to their flower buckets. Malfoy nodded.
Harry face split in a grin at least as wide as Malfoy’s next to him, who was all aflutter, making more tea. His chest ached. What wonderful news! What he wouldn’t give to be them, in that moment, where everything was new and perfect.
I didn't know I'd ever write "enthusiastic seasoning". But there was no other way to express what I could see Teddy doing.
By the time lunch rolled around, the number of reporters had dwindled to a few desperate and frantic looking witches and wizards, who had gotten themselves cups of hot tea and chairs to sit on. They had clearly decided to wait it out. Slowly, other customers had come trickling in, and while they had all looked curiously at Harry, they had refrained from asking him any questions.
“Harry, why can’t I call you dad?”.  Harry glanced up from his bowl of cereal, feeling sucker punched all of a sudden. They were eating sugary cereal for dinner, the nonmagical kind he always got from Tesco’s.
A lot of things had changed after the war. Not just wizard-society’s sense of security, cohesion, and pride, but equally, the relationship between the Ministry and Hogwarts. A new wave of cooperation and democratization had slowly crested. While Wizengamot members still decided on educational decrees, school governors had been replaced by a real, muggle style PTA, who served as a check on Wizengamot reforms. Membership was free, Wizarding ancestorship not required. Yes, a lot of things were different. Better, even.
had dumped him, for whatever unfathomable reason, and now Potter was licking his wounds in Neville’s flowershop, dejected, stashed away like he had lost his use. Like he wasn’t the
“I’ll send you your things, then” he states again. Marcus sighs, looks pleadingly at him. “I didn’t come here for my stuff, Harry. I don’t even remember what I left here.”
“Yes, Potter.” He answered again, and he looked like he was trying hard not to roll his eyes. He sipped his tea, and put down the cup. A little moisture was caught on his bottom lip, and Harry’s eyes were drawn to it involuntarily.
He locked himself in his office, and set to work. By the end of the day, his robes were ruined, singed in places, his hair was a mess, and he had several scores on his skin where paper had literally attacked him; paper cuts were petty, and they definitely
“Dare I ask why you are bringing us pastry, Malfoy?”. He had placed the two cinnamon rolls in front of Draco and Teddy, and Teddy’s eyes were taking on a sort of gleaming excitement. Draco felt rather the same; these cinnamon rolls
Harry ate his cream puff, and the conversation carried on without his input, towards different kinds of Muggle education. Sanaz’s nephews now crowded around them, getting to the food, and Teddy flopped down next to Harry, reaching for a sandwich. Harry put an arm around Teddy’s shoulders, glad for his presence. “You ‘kay there, Ted?” he asked. Teddy nodded, and swallowed a bite. “Yes, dad” he answered, grinning. Harry scrutinized his kid again.
“Is this again your flower language nonsense, Malfoy? Bribing Ministry members?” he was frowning, but looked bemused all the same. And Draco took it for what it was; a perfect opportunity to introduce Potter to some pressing matters. But he had to goad Potter; he certainly wouldn’t want to give the impression that he was
Malfoys shoulders droop, just a little. “Yes. Me. Problem?” he asks, and turns around to glower at Harry, chopping knife in hand.
“Yes, you, young man! I’d recognize you everywhere!”. Draco sighed. Not wanting to be rude, he made his mind up to see what that was all about. Lawrence was staring in between Draco’s expression of slight distaste, and the rather insistently gesturing elderly Witch. She looked rather deranged, flapping her arm to gesture him closer.
Teddy was rambling on about how Molly Weasley could have six pans on the hob at the same time and still spot them slacking on their reading assignments when her back was turned. It seemed. Mrs. Weasley engendered both admiration and a healthy dose of apprehension in him, and Draco was impressed. Then again, with her whole team of kids and undoubtedly half-team of grandkids, she was definitely a true veteran in the art of raising and homeschooling children. Draco focused on keeping his three pots a-stir, and checked on the little puddings in the oven. It wasn’t really something special, mashed potatoes, carrots and peas, pan-fried chicken, but it was wholesome and easy to make.
“Marcus, stop!” Harry yells, and quickly advances on them, pulling Marcus bodily from Malfoy, who gets pushed against the table, which makes a loud screeching noise as the legs scrape against the floor.
“Again, stating the obvious, Potter. Why should you know?”. Harry shrugs, and sips his tea. Silence falls again.
“Oh, I don’t really.  Just, satisfy my curiosity, Potter. Granger and Weasley have certainly managed, well on their way actually.” Harry looked up in suprise.
Luckily for him, the smell was Pansy taking off the containing charm on the fresh waffles she’s brought, which she’s setting up on the table, together with cinnamon sugar (where did she find that?! It was in his secret sweets cupboard!) and a large dosis of pepper up, freshly brewed, judging by the steam from it. She sits down primly, and pours herself a steaming cup of coffee.
A bit of a short one, and there'll be a sequel to it. I want to write as much as possible, before my thesis-supervisor gets back to me and my attention will be pulled away, again.
“But I haven’t even gotten to the laundry yet!” she yawned. Harry smiled, hand still on her shoulder.
He lights the wall sconces and has just turned back to the sink, satisfied with the warm, low glow, when he hears Potter coming downstairs again.
“You’re just lucky” Sanaz answered him, motioning to Teddy. Hermione rested her cheek on Ron’s shoulder, and put a hand on her abdomen. The three of them exchanged a look. It conveyed all the worry for Teddy, but equally, all the love. Harry smiled at Sanaz. The warm squirmy feeling was back.
“Not at all my intention, Mailwizard Fawcett. I’ll take my leave.” He bows a little, and leaves, taking with him the forms.
. And all of them will be staring, like they had when the previous newspaper articles had dropped. They will be chuckling, whispering ‘oooh, look at the poor little Death-Eater’, and follow him with their greedy little gossipy eyes. He suppresses a shudder.
He got a raised blond brow in return. “I’m sure she never will, Potter”. He didn't seem mad however, amused, rather.
“I want to know about his role in the war” he says, clearly. Harry felt his face do something Neville snorts at, and shoots him a glare. Neville’s eyes turn kind; he obviously understood something Harry didn’t.
to Hermione. In the beginning, Ron and Harry had grumbled about their closeness. Then, Malfoy had started coming ‘round to dinner at their apartment, and Ron had started grumbling less. When Harry had pressed him again on Hermione and Malfoy’s closeness, he had shrugged and said “You don’t have to get it, Harry. It’s Hermione’s call.”
“Ehm. I also added my personal information on that card, should you need some, eh. Encouragement.” Harry glanced at the little card clipped to the top.
“Don’t, Draco. It’s awful”. She pleads. But he’s seen regardless; there no mistaking that those were the papers everyone was secreting away earlier at the department.
There was something scintillating about Malfoy, standing in front of him, swirling grey eyes intent on his, one eyebrow raised in impatient anticipation –was that a pureblood thing?- looking elegant in his slim-fitting black robes.
My thesis should be finished in two weeks, and I'll resume writing lengthier and more in-depth chapters again.
Victoire’s accidental magic usually manifested itself in short bursts of levitation. Likely of cake, today. Teddy’s shrieks continued from behind the kitchen door. Harry had to chuckle, “Good luck with that. Ask Teddy about his boots and he’ll be dancing your arms off!”.
“Hello mister Draco” Teddy greets him politely, and moves back to let him enter. He steps through the front door and feels the flicker of wards when he’s admitted. Curious. Potter could’ve easily kept him out by locking the wards to him. “Hello, mister Teddy” he winks at the boy, who grins back.
“You don’t work here, do you?” she has a high pitched, obnoxious sort of voice, and he’s already on edge. “No,” he answers curtly, drawing himself up. “I’ve been charged with locking up, however. Family emergency, you
Clementia Beauregard was a formidable witch who, due to an unfortunate marriage and oldfashioned laws, had lost her own seat on the Wizengamot. Madam Beauregard could be gruff, but her sense of fairness and justice were her main motivators, and he thought Jasmin would do well to learn from her. Her beaky nose -not unlike the late Professor Snape's, was capable of sniffing out legal fallacies like not other, and she had survived both wizarding wars to come out with a complete lack of patience for uselessness and inefficiency. Groveling was utterly beneath her. Draco had immediately liked her, even if she called him ‘young Malfoy’, still, after years of working directly under Hermione. Hermione had said she was like Headmistress McGonagall, only without the tartan robes and a mouth full of legal-speak.
“So, Teddy will be fine,” he probed again, even though he knew it wasn’t that simple. “why are you so worried, then, Hermione?”
“What? Be meddled with? Not particularly, no. Being drafted into a war without consent was enough, really.” He answered dispassionately. Malfoy’s face lost some of its levity at that, but he pressed on.
“Yes, until then” he replied. Harry walked out to the hallway, where Hermione and Ron walked already with Teddy inbetween them, looking for all everyone knew like the perfect family. He caught up to them. “Let’s have pancakes for dinner, yeah?” and they went home.
Harry has accepted Neville's offer to work in his shop after he's quit the Aurors. He's convincing himself that maybe the breakup with Marcus isn't so bad, no one needs to worry about him, and he really enjoys working with plants. If only that new customer wouldn't make his palms sweat so much...
” the headline proclaimed, showing Marcus exiting one of his favourite restaurants, holding the arm of some guy Harry had seen around the Ministry before, but didn’t know by name.
He won’t even be able to pay Blaise for all his help, as it stood now. It was a small wonder, that his Slytherin loyalty had held until this moment. All of his vaults had been seized the moment of the decision. He only had a few days respite to vacate his apartment because it was exactly three days for the paperwork to get through, and the reinstated Lord Malfoy had to be able to exercise and ‘enjoy all his rights and use of property as was his due’ by then. He would be opening a new bank account now, so at least he’d have access to his Ministry salary. After of course, war restitutions had been deducted. A Death-Eater tax, so to speak. It hadn’t really bothered him financially before, of course, but it was an infinite contribution. To his death. Of thirty-five percent of his salary, no less. He wondered if he could even afford to rent in London, now. Definitely not in the Muggle areas, he supposed.
of all people. And so close, all of a sudden. Which, try as he might to deny it, still made his insides squirm, and his palms sweaty.
The wizard at the front desk eyes him, while letters and owls are chaotically fluttering about at the back. Merlin, this whole department seems so
Harry can practically feel the gleeful look on Malfoy’s face at the words “single dad club”. He groans.
“Heya, Harry” said Marcus, standing on his doorsteps, hands in his pockets and looking bashful. His dark brown curly hair was cut neatly, and he was in old fashioned wizarding robes, belted at the waist to show off his trim figure.
Neville then proceeded towards the door, where the now muted mob was still pressing in on the shop. He switched the sign to ‘open’, and the first reporter reached for the door handle, opening the door about a foot. Harry held his breath.
Draco leaned back, touching his fingers to the delicate pink blooms set on the counter. Potter’s eyes dropped to his hand.
“Do you always ask so many questions? Or are you on an undercover Auror mission, hiding between flowers?” the corner of Draco’s mouth curled up. Would that that be the truth, instead of him pining away in Neville’s shop and trying to hold his act together. “no? Perhaps you’re trying to keep away your many fans by means of dirt and mandrake? I’m sure it won’t fool anyone, Potter”.
“Sure, Drake-o” Lawrence grinned, and took his arm. Frowning, Draco apparated them to an apparition point just behind the National Portrait Gallery. Close by was their usual café, set somehow charmingly in the crypts of a Muggle church. The atmosphere had always reminded him of the wine-parties in the Malfoy Manor winecellars, and too, of the subterranean coziness of the Slytherin common room.
He signed it with his initials, and handed it back over. Potter –rudely-, glanced at the little card. He flicked his eyes up to Draco’s.
The records were nearly all Sirius’s, but some had borne the initials of a certain R.J. Lupin and Harry had taken the lot down from under Sirius’ loose floorboards and kept them in the sitting room, where they could be used. It was something to remember the two old Marauders by, and he wanted Teddy to know this small part of his dad. While the ABBA was Sirius’, there were some excellent Bowie albums of Remus that Harry couldn’t wait to introduce Teddy to when he was a little older. Watching his godson’s elated dancing and utter original ridiculousness, he felt that perhaps he was doing some things right as a godfather.
“Easy, Ted. You still need to get to bed soon.” Teddy pulled back. “Can we play exploding snap first?” he pleaded. Harry cracked. His heart was full, and he was rubbish at being strict anyway.
“Come on, lets help your gran so we can start cooking, right?”.  Teddy complained, but obediently set to shelving the things he could reach first. All in all, it become another lovely evening. The potpies were a success, with Teddy eating seconds, and Andromeda had even brought chocolate pudding for dessert, a treat for Harry and Teddy both.
He wonders if this was his life now: just always being tired, disappointed, and worried. He drags himself from out of the counter to help the witches, and then vows to make himself a strong cup of tea. No biscuits, of course, as Hannah was still recuperating. Not that he was hungry, after such a food-filled weekend. As he lets it steep, he muses about his time in the Aurors. Of course he was exhausted then, too. While Auroring was different from being a Hit-Wizard, there was still a fair amount of dueling and running down criminals involved, especially in the Dark Arts Crime department, of which he and Marcus had been part. At the same time, it had been exciting, and the hands-on approach had been satisfying. Yes, paperwork afterwards had been a drag, as had been investigations that didn’t seem to move forward. He’d never been all that patient, even if he’d gotten better at it taking care of Teddy.
‘Aunt Angie’ gave him a place to crash when he was inbetween student-housing accomodations. Gifted him care-packages, but wasn’t allowed to coddle him all that much. Their relationship was complicated, but they checked in on eachother.
“I did not speak with her long enough to pass judgement, mother”. He keeps his hands still, knowing how much his mother hates his restless fidgeting.
Yet a lot of his friends either had chosen to have children, or were well on their way. But then again, Melany had Parvati, to lean on, to share the burden. Granger had Weasley, who padded all her chairs and stacked her desk full of snacks. Neville had Hannah, who doted on him and made him feel secure.
“Give me a second, Harry”. She answers, already understanding. It was to her credit as a friend that she didn’t try to persuade him differently. A testament too, to her growing sense of parenthood. She took out her wand and waved it in a complicated matter. Little glowing threads of magic became visible around the door. “Right,” she muttered, nodding to herself. Harry could feel the seconds passing, too fast. Hermione hummed decisively, and turned to him. “Can you break these little blue ones? Not the others. Also, I feel like I should say, no need to blow up the door, okay Harry?” Grimly, Harry nodded. He focused his eyes and simply let out a short sharp burst of his magic, not even bothering with any of his auror handbook spells for breaking wards. Distinctly, he heard a click in the air. Not even bothering to thank Hermione, he yanked open the door and rushed inside.
, Granger” he bit out, revealing a bit more than he wanted. God, it was like pulling teeth, talking to Gryffindors. Sweet Salazar. He felt prickly all over.
We see things from Draco's perspective. He works at W.E.I.R.D. with Hermione, has a penchant for muggle suits, and is still ever so much the Slytherin we know and love/hate. And dear lord, Potter has a beard.
Draco accepts Hermione's proposal, and gets her permission. Even if she doesn't exactly know what she's agreeing to entirely. A little Draco-Teddy bonding.
and while the shop was still secure and its customers surprisingly loyal, he had still managed to be photographed in Diagon when he had stepped out to have tea with Mrs. Picklewilly.
Harry inclines his head. “I’ll go and inform her. It’s her choice, however.” He warns, and leaves the room. He can hear Teddy and Malfoy resuming their animated conversation, and figures he can leave them for a little while, after all. He has much to think of regarding Malfoy, and he feels wrongfooted by all that happened today.
“Well, all purebloods learn Latin growing up. It’s a means of communicating more than just plain words. I like to beat them at their own game. Although Shelly isn’t in the pureblood faction, he will have appreciated this particular one.”
“For what, mrs. Picklewilly?” she put down her cup a bit heavier than usual, and it clunked against the china
Draco inclines his head. “I’m sure he wouldn’t, considering I’m still his arch nemesis” He smiles wryly.
“Even if it did, does that still not make me a murderer? Isn’t my soul more torn than even Malfoy’s?” His voice is almost a whisper, hoarse. Lawrence looks pale, unsure. All the fight seems to have left him.
Potter, meanwhile, was sitting quietly at the table, no doubt watching the spectacle Draco was making of his kitchen.
“Well, Draco, I’ve already owled your mother. We’re meeting her later today.” Draco’s head snaps up to look at her, his cheeks bulging inelegantly with the waffles. They were truly excellent, after all.
, including a golden pocketwatch. A quick peek at his feet revealed soft leather brogues, and just underneath his pointy chin gleamed a bright blue silk tie. He looked stunning, if flustered.
It used to be a never-ending joke of theirs, the state of Grimmauld Place. Harry would promise to redecorate, but then they’d get a new case, and there just never was enough time. And after each case, they’d come back to Grimmauld, and it was still the state it was in, not the grand family home it could be, but the dusty thing with the shut-rooms.
He rushes to Diagon, and apparates in front of the shop just minutes before closing time. Cursing himself for his absentmindedness, he steps inside the shop, which mercifully hasn’t yet locked the door. “So sorry, but could you please wait with closing. I’m rather in need of some flowers!” He exclaims as he crosses the threshold, quickly straightening his waistcoat. His eyes look up to find the cashier.
Stumbling out of the floor at Neville’s flower shop, he quickly cleared the dust and then went to switch the sign on the door to ‘open’. It looked quiet on Diagon yet, and his curious eyes earned him a wave from Mrs. Picklewilly next door, and he waved back, smiling. Mrs. Picklewilly owned the shop across from Neville’s, and was a lovely elderly witch who ran a cook and crockery shop that was stacked so completely full you had to navigate it with great care. While he never asked, he was sure that Molly had at least gotten all her cookbooks, if not her pots from “Pot, Kettle, Pickle”.
Abandoned as a child to a Muggle orphanage, only to have discovered his heritage when one of his aunts came back after the war to discover her nephew had disappeared, never to be spoken of again, when her sister discovered she had birthed a Squib. Apparently Lawrence’s biological mother cared more about wizarding blood than family; her younger sister Angeline clearly didn’t.
, for other people to have a better chance. For the fucking war not to kill them all in other ways, even after it ended.
“Alright then. Let’s head out.” Draco threw his napkin on the table, along with some bills to cover the cost of their refreshments. They didn’t mind his sudden departures here; Draco was an excellent tipper.
“Because children and their parental figures have different, complex relationships. And, if it helps him not having panic attacks or related symptoms, why not try it?” the Healer asked him kindly.
“Explain it to me then! Why did you testify on his behalf, Harry Potter?”. Harry looks at him, and sighs.
“Yes, it is rather creative. His appeal is to the legality of pureblood supremacy at the time of his crimes.” She adds conversationally. Harry stares at her. He doesn’t really know what to say. “And as it was a collective charge, if they want to retrial on grounds of only a part of the accusation, they’ll have to retrial the whole thing, starting with reinstating him as Lord Malfoy, the accused.” Oh
It took all his pureblood training to keep his jaw from dropping. Never before had he met an old acquaintance from his mother’s, that was so, for lack of a better word,
“I will be, pup, don’t worry. I got you.” He smiled, and ruffled Teddy’s hair. At least he had Teddy.
“But you are! You’re saying that what he did wasn’t bad at all! He wanted to murder people like me!” he growls.
Draco studies the little purple blob on the magical photograph. It was swimming in darker coloured sphere, its heart beating, probably somewhere knowing it was wanted. His eyes started to burn.
I'm very stressed as my thesis is nearly due, and it's not the easiest time to write atm. Thank you SO MUCH for the kudos, and a special thank you for those who have left comments. They truly make my day <3.
After having given Jasmin a smile and encouragement to keep up with her excellent work –and could she forward that article on nationality and self-realization, please? He checked on other witches and wizards in his department.
He apparated to his kitchen to find Lawrence already there, looking agitated. “There you are!” he exclaims impatiently, and he waves today’s issue of the Prophet in his face.
She sighed again. “yes, well, it doesn’t make it any less awful. He’s…. I’m not sure how he is, actually”. She raised her hand to her hair, messed it up even more, and leant against the desk.
And if he couldn’t really care about messes and spills and groceries, it was probably still fine, as long as Teddy was fine. That was the priority. And Teddy
worried and well-meaning interrogation. His two friends were getting quite good at them. Then again, they'd had years of training, hadn't they?
“You always have a choice, arsehole! What, you’re still talking about this Dark Lord of yours, this Lord-”
Malfoy’s previous annoyance seemed to return. “Well then, if you must. I need flowers to convey my utter disappointment in someone”, he prompted again, his upper lip curling slightly upwards.
“Why don’t you come over and have a little tea with me. It’s not a story one should discuss without tea.” He turns to Harry. “You, calm down and come have a cup as well. There's disinfectant in the second drawer behind you, by the way.” Neville winks tiredly and guides the boy to the sunroom.
“I don’t mind,” he smiled at her “as long as you take a breath in-between to give us mere mortals time to catch up”. Her smile widened, he noticed in satisfaction.
Exhausted, he hurried his way home. At least he could have a nice dinner with Lawrence, and hire him to test their new syllabus.
He sighs, but does as he’s told all the same. He gratefully downs the pepper-up potion, and puts half a waffle on his plate while the steam exits his ears. He ignores Pansy’s little snigger. Perhaps he can eat something after all.
“What he did was reprehensible. He was a horrible child, and he bullied both of us mercilessly” Neville states. Lawrence sighs and turns to Neville, as Harry takes a few deep breaths. His chest felt rather tight. “He made a lot of bad choices in the war, I know. But I think there weren’t many good ones for him at all, you know.”
“Am I to understand that Potter is upstairs covered in slime?” he manages, before a laugh escapes him. Teddy smile is pure satisfaction.
His mother launches into another conversation, about some Janine Livingstone, who apparently married some shop owner called “Picklewilly” –talk about ridiculous names, really, who are they kidding? – who wrote to her after all these years with the most
“And you’re distressed about?”, he prodded lightly. She hadn’t shown this much anxiety since telling Draco the news, from which point he had already started planning for the eventuality; the inevitable questions, announcements, and –at some point far, far in the future, at least to Draco’s hopeful mind, her maternity leave.
“Don’t be ridiculous Granger. I know our bill still needs some fine-tuning, but it’ll get there.” He jokes, feeling inordinately pleased at her frustrated little slam against his chest, and she moves away a little.
He’s just finished up watering the Pond-plant selection, when a couple of witches come in, giggling. Malfoy hadn’t been in, but he had ordered two more arrangements via owl. His eagle owl had looked as haughty as Malfoy, but stayed for pets after delivering the order. The first order, however, had made his hand shake in anger. A bouquet of white columbine, non-magical hellebore, and moping pink larkspurs, their heads drooping because they apparently didn't like the hellebore all that much. He didn't bother coaxing them to stand proudly: they were meant for Reginald fucking Edgecombe, the bastard that had stolen Marcus from him. He deserved moping larkspurs, really. God, the
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry” Harry hastily added, trying for a smile. The Healer regarded him pensively. “Its just,” He messed up his hair a bit more, and glanced at Teddy to make sure he was still asleep, “I don’t know any other parents, that are, you know… going at it alone.” The Healer gave him a wry smile. Colour was slowly returning to his cheeks.
“Welcome to Spectral Sprouts, what can I –Malfoy?!” Upon seeing his new customer his welcome faltered. A silence fell, and he was sure he was gaping.
“Yes. We halted the progress of corrosive magic via potions. I immunized the magical core against it, and stopped renewed outpour of magic. It will halt his magical growth for a little bit, but that side effect will be gone in a few weeks. He'll also have bouts of fever over the next few days, unfortunately. It's his system getting rid of residual magic.”
“Why do you care, Malfoy?” He rubbed his beard, flowers lying tied prettily on the counter. Malfoy’s eyes flicked to the gesture, intrigued.
“I am aware, mother”. His stomach clenches slightly. He reminds himself they have this conversation at least twice a year, ever since the war ended, and father was 'put away'.
“Shut up, Malfoy. It’s a support group thing, I got a reference from St. Mungo’s” he answers, willing himself not to look more embarrassed than he already does. Man, today can hardly get any worse. Then he remembers, Malfoy doesn’t actually have an accord with Andromeda. As far as he knows, he’s in for yet another awkward meeting. Which would be amusing, but it might hurt Andromeda, too. Better check, actually.
“Malfoy, there’s a bottle upstairs in the bathroom, second door to the right. Bright blue. Get it, now!” With a curt nod, Draco rushed up the stairs, found the bottle, and quickly turned back. He had to jump over dirty towels lying on the floor, unwashed bedding in a corner, and he spotted a few dustbunnies scuttling away.
He felt undeniably nervous. What business had he, to be standing here in front of the Black ancestral home, between the dilapidated garden hedges, the creaking gate, and in front of the dark wooden door with a gleaming, golden doorknocker. The doorknocker he had been trying to find the courage to actually
He flicked his eyes over the crisp, Muggle printer-paper again, and sighed. He definitely needed to stop feeling sorry for Potter, for crying out loud. So
,” Draco spits out, gaining in on Lawrence, pushing him against the wall next to the fireplace. “Was a genocidal maniac who
Wednesday saw another delivery,  this time a very strong smelling arrangement of goldenrod, sunflowers, thyme and fennel***. The note said:
“Ah, Harry dear, there you are.” Came Mrs. PIcklewilly’s voice. Harry pulls his thoughts away from his musings on parenting and focuses on the elderly witch who was bustling in with a tray of rattling teacups.
“Oh, I just finished that order. Just a sec.” Potter turned back, and came out with a lovely bright collection of pinks and blues and whites. Just that moment, an owl came zooming through the window, straight for Neville.
the husband’’, he emphasized, when Mrs. Picklewilly's eyes flashed. He stood up and grabbed the dustpan he’d been holding earlier, which he’d put next to the armchair.
She told him about the pregnancy five weeks in, when he found her throwing up her lunch in the office trashcan one afternoon. She was barely showing at this point, although pencil skirts had now made way for sensible pants with magical seams. It wasn’t widely known yet, as she didn’t want the press harrowing her for details. Three months is, after all, still early days, especially for wizarding pregnancies.
Draco hears Potter take a seat behind them, but decides to ignore him. If he's not being chased from the house, he's staying. Teddy is next to him on a little stool, excitedly looking over all the magical cooking. Usually Draco doesn’t use that much magic in the kitchen; the stirring and chopping reminds him of potions, and calms him down after a day of work. But little Teddy seems completely suprised. Didn’t Potter cook proper meals,
He hears the voice exclaim a high pitched “oh!” and the door opens immediately, revealing the pale form of Teddy Lupin. Not in pajamas, but in another curious ensemble. Draco finds he can appreciate the red corduroy pants and purple starry t-shirt, which is complemented by purple buckled boots not unlike the ones elderly Wizarding folk seem to favor. Teddy is smiling at him, even if he looks a bit peaky. While he knew that Teddy was a metamorphmagus, this seemed to be his unmagicked self. Perhaps a side effect from the potions?
“Didn’t know you’d be so fond of Muggle expletives, Potter” he says drily, and takes out a bag of chickpea flower. He rolls up his sleeves in short little tugs, and all of a sudden, his forearms are bare and Harry sees
“I know your mother dear, Narcissa. From Hogwarts, if you must know. We were in the same house, if not the same year.”
Again Potter bent over –Draco was resolutely not looking at his arse, lest he be caught-, and emerged with a slightly ruffled but perfectly serviceable goose feather-quill and inkpot. He thought briefly, then settled on simplicity;
Silence fell again, filled with awkwardness. He wondered if Potter was remembering his abrupt departure previously. He cleared his throat, and resisted the urge to comb a hand through is hair. Potter was obviously looking around for something to say.
, showing pictures of Potter and Belby embracing, and one of a beatifically smiling Reginald Edgecombe, Belby’s new lover.
“Are you saying I am a bad parent?”. He felt defensive. Yes, he had felt inadequate in the last few weeks. But Teddy seemed happy generally, and he had Molly and Andromeda looking out for him, too, who were amazing parents.
, babe!” he had always stated, and insisted on either going out to a posh restaurant –always in the wizarding district, or to bringing him round to one of his friends’
Hermione, as Department Head for the Wizarding Education, Information and Reformation Department –its unfortunate acronym being W.E.I.R.D, was working towards a larger societal reform of which the campaign would start just after the Function. Draco had accepted Hermione’s offer to work for her after she had accepted his stumbling, shamefaced apology for everything he had ever done to her and let do to her.
“That is so cool!!! Is it a boy? Can I play dragon-chase with him? When can I meet him?” he started asking, gaining in enthusiasm , more awake than he had been before then. His hair was starting to curl in his excitement. Harry laughed at him.
When the Manor was still being rebuilt after the battle, more than one orphan had found its way into the manor’s bedrooms and stayed for weeks, if not months. Occasionally those children would come for sleepovers, bringing with them their various guardians, of all types of wizarding stock. Mother, with all her stuck up tendencies, spared no expense in accommodating them. He knew she kept a little notebook with all their allergies, preferences, and birthdays; sending them lovely little gifts when the day arrived, too. Yes, his mother had many faults, but her capacity to love children was perhaps her greatest gift.
The cafe I described actually does exist (Next/underneath St. Martin-in-the-fields, in London), although I took liberty with the menu items.
I mean, 8 chapters until a decent convo is already quite long, and I don't want to wait until chapter 20 for a kiss, right?
First of all, I am extremely sorry this chapter is so very late. You might have guessed it already, but I had a personal health crisis, and all other things had to be put on hold. I somehow, over the last few months managed to pass my defense and graduate. I am recovering, but it's a slow process.
“How about we cook a proper family dinner, Teddy?”. Teddy shrugs, slurping around the juice of the apple rolling down his chin.
“Nonsense!” she exclaimed. “If you are not there to rub it in their noses, the Wizengamot will think they can just sit on their fat, lazy, conservative bottoms and keep any reforms from happening.” Harry snorted and raised an eyebrow.
, it declared boldly, showing a picture of Harry in his auror robes, leaving the ministry, obviously taken a few weeks prior.
They’d met in a muggle bar –the kind his mother wasn’t allowed to know about, and Draco had laughed at his attempts to flirt. He’d then proceeded to show Lawrence just how to go about it, Draco sponsoring his venture with lots of vodka, and they’d been friends ever since. And working together, should the need arise.
As usual, I have no beta, so all mistakes are my own. Please point them out so they can die a silent and painless death.
He was served tea in a blue china teaset, decorated with little black swallows. Clearly mrs. Picklewilly was sharper than her flowery looks made her seem. They perfectly matched the little black swallows embroidered on his blue waistcoat. Not just a batty old lady, then.
For a while, no one spoke as the pastries were devoured. Then, Draco noticed that the table started wobbling, ever so slightly. He frowned.
I am sorry it took this long to get back to this fic, but let me be clear; I WILL NOT ABANDON THIS FIC. This fic will be finished within the next months.
, just off Diagon Alley. It was but the first dress appointment they had, and that of no less than three shops. Hermione sighed, and rubbed her stomach again.
to be intimitated into submission. Two could play this game, and Draco had developed an iron-clad backbone since the war. He wouldn't cow again.
“I think I might even involve Ron” she smirks a little. It’s a good look on her, Draco thinks. Very clever and devious. An idea pops into his head.
“Yes, Malfoy. What do you want?”. He put down the pruning tools in his hands, lest he be tempted to stab Malfoy with them.
Molly stepped forward and hugged him again “You’ll be alright dearie” she whispered in his ear, and he suddenly felt the lump in his throat return.
Harry stood up to help her in her robe. “If it is too much, use your phone, alright? I’ll come get him immediately”
“Is it true?” he asks. He feels like he should’ve known. He wasn’t an Auror anymore, but wouldn’t he be contacted should the case be brought to trial again, as he had been a key witness the first time? He didn’t think he’d fallen out of grace with the Ministry
. Potter had swung open the door and blinked in the light, eyes squinting. Had he just woken up, perchance?
“Seriously though, don’t start stealing flowers. Neville will go out of business, you arse”. A wonderfully melodious laugh erupts in the air, and Harry is rather startled by it. He looks almost fond, his causal smirk almost a smile now.
“I was willing to lay my life down for that approval, for a cause that I was taught was the most important thing. And I did. I died for it.” He says, evenly. He feels a bit distant from the conversation now. He can feel Lawrence looking at him, wide-eyed. The tea is forgotten on the table, little wafts of steam still rising in the air.
“Bloody hell” he chokes out. He hadn’t even thought of that. Their bill was due in a month. The retrial would span
“Well, the git’s a pompous arse, we know that.” Ron interjected, looking almost fond. Sanaz looked bewildered, and Hermione took pity on her.
“Is he, now? The Potter’s were an old pureblood family, as I’m sure you know. Potter has never been active in taking his seat in the Wizengamot as the heir of both the Potter and Black houses.”
. At least Teddy’s there to fill the awkward silence, crunching noises coming from his enthusiastic seasoning.
“Yes, I did.” He was feeling a bit apprehensive now. Lawrence was licking his fingers, now. No tablemanners whatsovever, of course.
“Why would it be dirty?” asks Teddy, all innocent confusion “You better not steal my Slime-Buckets, dad”. Harry groans again. Oh my god, Malfoy is such a bad influence.
Hermione smiled at him, tiredly. “I’m happy we put her on it; she’s acclimatizing well to the intersectionality of Wizarding and Muggle research”. Draco smirked back. “Oh, but I remember you couldn’t possibly hire her, such a young, innocent little girl.” He mocked. Hermione groaned.
,” he tuts, as he reads “Harry doesn’t measure up to the size of his fame.... Savior needs to be saved in bed-”
“Wow” he croaked. “Oh god. Wow!” he added, voice rising. “Mione, that’s amazing!” He jumped up and leaned over the table to hug her, smiling widely. Leaning over to Ron, he knocked over the pumpkin juice, but nobody cared, except Teddy, whose toast was now drenched. “You’re having a baby!” He laughed, clapping Ron on the back. “Well done mate!”. Teddy stared with wide eyes at Hermione, dripping toast still in one hand. “You have a baby in your belly? Like, now?!” He exclaimed. Hermione laughed loudly and leaned over to hug him, and Teddy let her with an ‘umph’.
rather clever, Edward”. If possible, Potter glared harder at him. He was losing the getting-dressed discussion, badly. With a put-upon sigh, Potter turned towards the kettle.
“Hey, Teds. I hope you behaved, hm?” he ruffled Teddy’s black hair, relieved there was no imitation scar hiding underneath this time. Andromeda sighed deeply and set down the shopping bags in the hallway.
Marcus looks between Malfoy, who’s enchanted the dough to keep rolling itself, and Harry, who’s defensively crossed his arms, but for all intents and purposes, has put his body between Malfoy and Marcus.
“So in a way, Malfoy and I aren’t so different.” He states, knowing how true it is, even if he doesn’t like to ponder on it.
Thursday came without delivery orders, but delivered a Malfoy to the door. He stepped in elegantly through the door just after noon, clad impeccably in yet another three piece suit: A dark, nearly black violet, only betraying colour when caught in the light. His silver embroidered waistcoat was decorated with intricate curlicues, and a silver chain must hide another pocket-watch in his pocket; his cravat was a silvery silk. Gleaming black shoes completed the ensemble. Harry’s eyes traveled upwards to Malfoy’s face, whose eyes were intent on Harry’s. Harry hoped he wasn’t blushing –caught staring (appreciatively) at Malfoy, of all people, was not something he wanted him to know. Malfoy gave a quiet cough.
The light inside the shop was dimmed, probably to prevent the press from taking any good pictures of him. Behind the till, looking pained but determined, wearing baby blue earmuffs, was Neville.
Harry, feeling chastised, turns around to properly take care of his hands. He hears the muffled sounds of a tense conversation, the boy biting out short sentences and Neville’s soothing timbre. Harry takes a few deep breaths. He wasn’t on trial, and neither was Malfoy, he has to remind himself. Maybe he should hold off judgement on this boy until he knew what was going on. He forced his shoulders to unclench, and turns to the sunroom.
“What made it smell, was both the thyme and fennel, which, I agree, produce quite the odorous arrangement. However, they symbolize courage and flattery. I like Shelly, and I want him to know I like what he’s doing, now.” He glanced up, finding Potter seemingly mulling this over.
“You need more support for your department. It is no secret that it requires a large budget, most of which comes from old money; old families that feel thwarted because of your recent reforms regarding pureblood education.”
Hello my dear readers, friends! Recovery is a long road, made better by your kind wishes. I'm unable to respond to messages currently, but at least I can post a new chapter.
So, here he stood. He had managed to pilfer the last two cinnamon rolls from the Muggle bakery in addition to a hideous monstrosity with whipped cream and strawberries which he imagined children might like, and het set out to Grimmauld Place. He was sure the girl from the bakery had laughed at him when he had ordered the cream
Harry delivers a lot of flowers with cryptic messages, and Draco starts executing some plans -some of which involve Harry.
?” Hermione had told Harry she wanted to keep it in the family for a little while longer… what business had Malfoy, knowing?!
“How’s your boss, Drake?” he asked. Lawrence knew Hermione, if only in passing. Hermione didn’t approve of his employing Lawrence, since he was supposed to be a fulltime student, and he wasn’t to “corrupt the young”. She didn’t know how they had met, and that it wasn’t Draco who had initiated any sort of ‘corruption’.
I have plans for at least another three chapters, and I have a feeling it's going to be at least 7 chapters long, just because I keep rambling on and adding things.
“He worked to gain first my forgiveness, then my trust, and then my friendship, Lawrence. I didn’t make it easy on him, believe me”. He answers calmly. Harry holds back a snort. Neville was still kinder than most, even if he had some sort of a weird friendship with Malfoy. Then again, he didn’t understand how Ron could stand him, but he did as well. Had family dinners with him, even. Lawrence turns to Harry.
“Ooooh, you brought food!” Teddy exclaims, when Draco puts down the bag on the table, huffing. He was still hot, but smiled at his cousin. He definitely looked better than last time, although that wasn’t saying much. He hears an enormous crash coming from upstairs, followed by even more curses. Teddy glances up, grins again.
After at least a minute he heard some loud banging coming from inside, and after another brief silence, the lock clicked, and Draco was suddenly faced with a gaunt looking Potter in what seemed to be his pyjamas; there was nothing that even gave the impression that what Potter was wearing was fit for public view. A ratty, large, knitted jumper fell off of one shoulder, Gryffindor red with a large W on the front. On his bottom half he wore joggers so threadbare they nearly approached see-through, although luckily the jumper was long enough to actually cover any parts that might lead to accusations of public indency. His mind was torn between worry at this appearance, and finding it all rather
, cooking with his cousin. He flicks his wand, and a pre-prepared cup of tea, dark like Potter had taken it before, floats over to him. A surprised noise comes from behind him, and Draco suppresses a smile.
She cleared her throat delicately. “Don’t take it badly Harry, but I can’t help but notice a few things.”
“Draco works really hard to ensure that Muggleborns and Squibs have a place here, you know this.” Neville states, and Lawrence nods. “He even told me that he fancies you a Slytherin”, and Harry snorts. “That’s a compliment, coming from Draco, you know", Neville adds. Lawrence shrugs, looks away.
“Oh, this and that. Not important dear.” She settles a bit more comfortably in the chair, and continues  “I can tell you she’s not all that happy with old Lucius, you know.” Harry’s mind was reeling. This was private information! He sincerely hoped she didn’t divulge his secrets so easily, but then again, he’d never heard a whisper of this before, so perhaps she
All the awful things Malfoy had done and all the things he should’ve done were in that gaze, and Harry had relented. He had understood something uncomfortable in that moment. Something he didn’t want to remind himself of all that often, and which was before him now, yet again.
“I’m losing my patience here! I’m counting to three! One… tw- Oh, there you are, Draco ducky”. He yanks open the door to the smiking, red lipped smile of Pansy Parkinson, fresh from Vienna, dressed in a periwrinkle blue dress and heels that would break anyone’s ankles. Pansy Parkinson, bones of steel and friend for the ages.
Malfoy huffs. “I expect so, yes.” A small smirk plays on his lips, Harry can see from his profile as he’s leaning over to get something from a drawer. He sips his tea again, considering.
“Draco, darling.” She comes closer, placing a translucent palm over her son’s cheek where he kneels on the floor. Draco shivers with the cold her hand radiates. “You weren’t supposed to see me.”
Harry shakes his head. “I’m sorry that happened to you. It’s not the same, but I know what it’s like to have your only family treat you like you don’t matter.”
After explaining the wards are usually found in the heart of the house, the attic, or the cellar, they set off to find a new door. Guided by the sensation of cold air flowing down towards him, Harry leads Draco upwards. Harry taps his wand to the hatch that leads to the attic, and a ladder unfurls itself. The space is dark, musty, and filled with strange objects.
Harry lifts up, thighs straining, and holds Draco’s cock in place as he lowers himself back down. His renewed clarity of vision means he can see every flinty shard in Draco’s irises before they are swallowed by black. He feels so full. The charm prepared him well, but he didn’t have the chance to get used to the sensation of something inside him the way he did when Draco used his fingers. His fingers are pressing bruises onto Harry’s hips, and the expression on his face is almost feral. Harry starts to move.
“Oh god,” moans Harry. His life is over. He has to tell them, and they’re going to die, and then they’re going to kill him. Ergo, his life is over.
Suddenly, Samuel is standing in front of him, holding out a drink. Harry hadn’t even noticed him leave to go to the kitchen.
Standing in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place where they’d drunk cups of tea in the dark, Harry knows that he can’t stop loving Terran, not any time soon. But he also can’t be with him unless he can give him everything he needs. He’s barely been gone for five minutes, ignoring the concerned creaks of the cabinets, when he disapparates again.
Dinner goes well. Surprisingly well. They come to the mutual decision to have a homecooked meal at Grimmauld Place, to avoid the press. Draco hasn’t had a chance to talk to his mother about what was in the paper yet, and he knows Harry wants to talk to the Weasleys. The sight of Harry stood over the hob, steam clouding over his glasses, settles the anxiety roiling inside him. He’s nattering on with his back to Draco, throwing glances behind him every now and then to where Draco’s sitting at the kitchen table, as if checking he’s really there.
Harry closes the door behind him and follows Draco into the kitchen, handing him the rest of the bottles. True to their word, Simi joins them promptly.
First, he shuffles the cards. They’re bigger than a pack of playing cards, and his hands feel clumsy. One falls out of the deck. He goes to pick it up again but Granny shakes her head.
When Harry arrives in the kitchen, Draco presents him with a mug of tea. It’s exactly how he likes it, and Harry wonders when he learned how Harry takes his tea. Probably when Harry learned how Draco takes his, staring at him from across the Great Hall day after day. Draco’s never been in his kitchen, as far as he knows, but he certainly seems at home. A guest making him tea in his own house would usually rankle, but for some reason it’s different coming from Draco.
They had kissed a while, after they finished the last time, but eventually Harry had decided to go home. He was too sore to go again, and he didn’t want to overstay his welcome. It had been almost amicable, by that point. Someone who didn’t know Draco might have even called him cheerful as he escorted Harry to the door.
“I was surprised you came back, after leaving in such a strop last night. I thought you might be setting fire to the bed, you know, to eliminate the evidence.”
At long last, Draco moves away. He stands, stripping carelessly, paying no mind to where his expensive clothes fall. His cock sways, looking painfully swollen. He climbs back over Harry, kneeling between his legs, and lifts Harry up by the arse. To take some of the weight off his shoulders Harry wraps his legs around him, locking his heels together at the small of Draco’s back, the muscles in his stomach clenching.
enthusiastically, I wouldn’t have thought Saint Potter would ever deign to get fucked by the likes of me. But, if it’s on the table, I usually prefer to top.”
“Perhaps my Draco should take you shopping, he has quite the eye for style,” she says, inspecting her nails.
They arrive outside the ballroom, opened into by a matching set of wooden doors. Instead of trees and animals, there are people, slumped at the very bottom of the doors. Sleeping- or dead. However, this time there is no visible damage. Seemingly unaffected by the state of the doors, Malfoy heads inside.
“Ah.” Malfoy looks thrown off balance, like he didn’t expect Harry to actually tell him. “Was it about the whole…”
“I imagine cleaning up this soot will be the first thing, but that shouldn’t take too long,” says Malfoy.
Before he can come up with an acceptable answer, Potter appears at the table, clutching a glass of whisky and a too-full pint of beer to his chest. He places the whisky in front of Draco, and looks around the room. The only free space is next to Draco on the bench seat.
Yes, I did make you wait fifteen chapters for a kiss. Yes, I did leave you on a cliff-hanger. No, I’m not sorry. Hopefully after this chapter you'll forgive me anyway.
Harry lowers his eyes. “I want you to hold me down, and leave bruises in the shape of your fingers. I want to get on my knees again and let you fuck my face until I choke. I want you to tie me up so I can’t move, so you can do anything you want to me.” He forces himself to look Draco in the eye. “Really, I just want you to use me.”
Harry drains the last dregs of his beer. “Fine then. If I’m Harry, then you’re Draco. We’ve known each other nearly ten years, it’s been long enough.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes and takes Harry’s coat almost without him noticing, the movement is so smooth. “Roberta would never allow it. She’s very serious about privacy, you know.”
When Harry was twenty-one, he was determined to lose his virginity. Embarrassed as he was, he decided to go to a Healer. The Healer told him sexual dysfunction was normal after trauma. Harry tried to explain that it wasn’t a physical problem, but when he tried to explain what actually happened to him when he was about to have sex, he couldn’t find the words.
“I hope I’m not interrupting anything, I just brought something for Teddy,” he says, holding up a parcel.
Harry groans internally. Without thinking it through, he’d tried to comb his hair earlier, and not dress like such a slob. After worrying about acting strangely and giving himself away, he hadn’t even stopped to think about how strange his neat appearance might seem. It was just that Draco was always so well-dressed. Though Harry would never change who he was for someone else, subconsciously at least, he still wanted to impress him.
Malfoy pours them both a generous portion, the amber liquid deep and stormy in the bottom of the glass. “If we don’t want a repeat of last time, we have to do things properly- talk about our boundaries.”
. “It’s nine o’clock, Potter. I know we’re both self-employed but some of us have something called a ‘work ethic’.”
First thing first, he needs to see Harry. There’s no way he’s taking this well, and there’s a good chance this could be the end of everything. He thought Harry would just eventually get tired of him, but maybe that was it, maybe that night was the last time he’ll get to kiss Harry Potter.
Narcissa wrenches herself away, and almost flies through the wall in her hurry to leave. A breath is punched from Draco’s lungs, not quite a sob, and not quite a shout. He collapses back onto his knees, and Harry rushes forwards. He’d watched the encounter in mute distress, and now he only feels terror. Draco is here, and in pain, and Harry has no idea how to help him. His hands hover over Draco’s shoulders, before pulling him into an embrace. Draco leans in for a moment, burying his face into Harry’s neck, before abruptly shoving Harry backwards. He almost falls onto his back, not expecting the attack.
Now it’s Harry’s turn to raise his eyebrows. He can’t raise one at a time, which bothers him no end.
It was only after Roberta had already carried the letter away, that he remember that the Weasley’s had all but adopted Potter. He sighed. There was no use getting into a tizzy about it, seeing as the Weasley patriarch would probably burn his letter as soon as he got it. Even if he did agree to work with Draco, it’s not like he’d be popping round for tea. There was no reason to believe he’d run into Potter at all.
Harry’s eyes flick back to large bed and he can’t help blushing. “Is there anything else I need to look at or are you just fucking with me now?”
“Yes,” says Harry, letting his legs fall open, making space for Draco to crawl into. “I want you to.”
Harry’s not scared but he is nervous, and a little ashamed. He’s still going to do it- he wants it too much.
Malfoy laughs and pulls him into a filthy kiss. “You can ruin as many as you like, so long as we can do that again.”
He can’t quite hear Potter’s sharp, silent gasp, but he can feel his lungs moving against him. Lord, he wants to be this close to him for the rest of his days. He wants to be closer. He wants to be inside him.
After walking Earl, doing the food shop, and buying an eclectic set of vinyl records, Harry returns home to find Narcissa and Bunny in the kitchen. He’d left the kitchen window open on for the owl on purpose, but there is very little he can do about Narcissa- she doesn’t exactly need a cat flap. Smiling at the mental image he’d created, he greets her with a wave.
He clenches his fists where they rest on the table, and then relaxes them again. “Duty then? Because of the debt.”
“Beautiful, darling. So good, letting me fuck you after you’ve already come. You just love it that much, don’t you?”
Draco smirks. “Well, if you want to make it up to me…” He returns to his task, pulling Harry’s shirt up and over his head. “That’s better.”
“Where in the rules did I say that? Besides, it’s actually very magnanimous of me. If you couldn’t push each other then Greg would never have won; his aim is dreadful.”
He groans pitifully, and goes over to the kitchen window. He opens it wider, and whistles. Less than a minute later, Bunny flies through and lands on his outstretched arm. He dips under her weight, and she nips his thumb.
Not that it wasn’t the worst idea in the world- Jones should be tossed into a tiger pit, not welcomed back with open arms- but that doesn’t mean much to Potter right now. He loved him, and that doesn’t just go away overnight. Draco can attest to that.
He pulls out Malfoy’s dick. It’s normal. It’s a penis. A relatively nice one, as they go, but he doesn’t feel the usual fear he associates with them. He breaths a sigh of relief, and the air must ghost over it because suddenly Malfoy’s hand is moving up to clutch at his hair. Something sparks at the base of Harry’s spine. He moves one hand to hold the base of Malfoy’s cock, and the other to press Malfoy’s fingers harder against his skull. A wordless request. He must understand, because his grip grows tighter.
It seemed that this wasn’t the answer Mr Filch had been hoping for, as he turned quite red and bellowed for Harry to leave the room.
It’s actually a little early. Most people won’t arrive for another few minutes at least, but he knows if he waits any longer, he’ll talk himself out of going at all. So he throws the powder into the fire, watches the flames turn green, and screws his courage to the sticking place.
Harry opens his mouth to reply but all that comes out is a yawn. “It’s eleven o’clock in the morning, why am I this tired?”
Harry takes his head out of the flames and floos over. Zabini stands, and wanders over to a drink’s cabinet.
Weasley just barges past him into the hallway. Obviously he could have stopped him; even though Weasley is both taller and broader than him, his wards would never allow anyone inside who wasn’t welcome. Although, ‘welcome’ might be stretching it a bit. ‘Grudgingly admitted for Harry’s sake’ would be more accurate.
Draco makes a soft, helpless noise, and presses his leg between Harry’s thighs. “Is this okay?” he asks.
He doesn’t mention the moments where Malfoy didn’t seem like the same person at all, or how they came to happen. He’s pretty sure Ron would have a heart attack, and Hermione’s voice would reach new levels of panicked squeakiness.
Well fuck. Thank god that happened because otherwise Harry Potter might just have kissed Draco Malfoy, and there’s no way Harry Potter wants to kiss Draco Malfoy. It just doesn’t make sense. He looks at Draco, covered in dirt, with the most affronted expression he’s ever seen on someone younger than eighty, and all he wants to do is wipe the grime from his face. Just to be able to touch him.
Malfoy jabs his finger in Harry’s direction. “Not at first. But yes, Madame Pomfrey healed me straight away.”
Fuck. He’s going to have to think fast. “He’s not out to anyone yet, so I don’t think I should tell you.”
Samuel finally moves, coming to stand next to him at the table and fix his own drink. “As a date? He’s very lucky, if so.”
“Then yes, okay,” he says, leaning back down to rest on Draco’s shoulder once again. “Yes, sir,” he corrects.
The words settle like treacle on his brain- heavy and sticky and too, too sweet. Harry makes another little noise, smaller and more helpless than he can ever remember making before.
Draco’s tempted to shake the insufferable, beautiful idiot until he develops a sense of self-worth, but he manages to stop himself. Restraint is something of a speciality of his, these days. Not that you’d know it, considering he keeps coming back to Potter like a needy Crup. But then, he’s not a saint, and Potter’s always been something of a blind spot.
As he adjusts to his surroundings, blinking open his eyes, he sees a faint outline standing over Draco. The curtains are still closed, and the light is soft, but he sees Narcissa’s hand tracing over her son’s face. She’s more transparent than she’s ever been; like a bubble in glass, only visible from the way it disrupts the view. She whispers something Harry can barely catch, though she could have been trying to shout.
Harry looks out of the window, the sky is dark blue and cloudless, the moon offering the only light. He goes to sit down at the kitchen table, and bumps into the sharp wooden corner. “Ginny’s here?”
“No. Hermione’s been saying the same thing, and Ron’s been trying to give me space but I know he’s worried. I just…needed some time,” sighs Harry.
for comfort, but he can’t let there be any doubt about this. Harry needs to know he’s not just going through the motions of a considerate lover. He needs to know that someone cares about him- that someone wants to
“They store the electricity, which is sort of like their magic. Muggles put batteries in things to make them work, but they run out and you have to replace them.”
“In what way,” says Hermione, keeping her voice bland so she doesn’t alarm her victim with her interrogation. What she fails to take into account however, is that not only is Zabini sober, but he’s also a Slytherin. He’s seen all these tricks before.
Harry starts shimmying out of his jeans. His tight, tight jeans that hug his arse like a… like a koala, or something. He climbs into Draco’s bed in his t-shirt and pants, placing his glasses on the bedside table. Draco strips off entirely; none of clothes are comfortable enough to sleep in. Except his underwear, he doesn’t have an excuse for those. He just wants as much of his skin on Harry as possible. Only to sleep, mind you. They’re too drunk for anything else.
Draco follows soon answer, hips losing their rhythm, fingernails carving white crescent moons into his hips. Draco collapses on top of him.
“About a month,” explains Arthur apologetically. “I didn’t want to tell you all until we were certain.”
“Oh sweetheart, you need this don’t you?” he croons. “Once wasn’t enough, one cock wasn’t enough. You really were made to get fucked.”
Shivering like a wet kneazle, he sinks to the floor and curls into a ball. With his head buried in his knees, his arms wrapped around his legs, the world feels a lot smaller. A lot more manageable.
“Harry, you might not realise it, but he’s done something to you. Don’t worry, though, I’ll sort it out.” Ron stands, a little wobbly on his feet. “Where does he live?”
“I went back to that leather bar, hoping to find them again, to say thank you when I wasn’t hungover and hating myself. That’s when I started to learn more about the kink scene. Anyway, to get to the point, sometimes after or even during a scene, you can drop. You’re all high one minute and then it feels like the world is ending.”
“Are you alright?” asks Hermione before continuing. “Yes, it was all over the Prophet. Not that I read it of course, but you know how gossipy the Ministry is.”
“And I’ve always been big,” he says. “So, people kind of made assumptions about what I’d be like in bed. And yeah, I did like being on top, but I didn’t want to push anyone around. I didn’t want to be rough, or commanding, or mean. After all that time trying to be a hard man, trying not to feel anything, the first time someone else took charge, held me down and took what they wanted… it was like a light switched on in my head.”
“A purr can’t heal someone from that,” Aisling points out. “But I saw what was happening. It was like something was flowing from Harry into the cat, powering it.”
They arrive in a warm kitchen with a small round table, just big enough for two chairs. Malfoy bends over to open a cupboard, and catches Harry staring at his arse when he looks back over his shoulder. Thankfully, he declines to mention it.
Harry takes a settling breath, and thinks of Draco lying on the grass in the orchard. Shading his eyes with his hand, the sun catching his hair alight. His small chuckle, not quite open enough for a laugh. Back in the present, Harry screws his eyes shut and chokes out “
He shifts from one foot to the other. “I said I would be, but I understand if you want me to leave.”
Harry kept silent. Talking back never went well, not when his cousin was too stupid listen to reason and more inclined to use his fists.
The dream is different this time. It starts with Draco laughing. He’s leaning into the shop, midday sunshine glinting off his hair and turning it silver and gold. Every colour is brighter, every smell is stronger. Harry can feel the path his blood is taking round his body, how his pulse picks up speed. The movement jerks around him, and he sees a different face. A young witch. Her eyes are round with anger and anxiety, and the blue is so intense it spreads outwards like a beacon. She’s standing over Granny, lying on the floor next to her chair. Granny’s eyes are closed, but the same blue spills out from under the papery skin of her eyelids. The light pools on the floor, becomes water, and floods the room. It rises up, lifting Granny’s body on a wave, and covering his face until he’s drowning.
“Yeah. I’ve got a pensieve we can use.” He waves his hand at the cabinet his desk is set into, and two double-fronted doors open. A stone bowl moves out, coming to hover over the desk.
“I don’t mind,” says Harry, smiling up at him. Any discomfort he felt earlier seems to have melted away. So what if a nice, handsome man wants to be nice and handsome at him? It doesn’t do any harm. “Thank you.”
Harry wobbles, nearly falling, before he grips the top of the ladder and regains his balance. He cranes his head round to glare at Malfoy. “Give me some warning next time. I don’t want to get skinned alive falling onto a cursed rocking horse, or whatever else you’ve got up here.”
“It’s weird, I didn’t get a good look at it, but I just knew. It isn’t purring, that’s why I think it’s broken,” he says.
Their eyes meet across the living room, and they share a look of panic. They’re united in that, at least. Harry doesn’t know how to act around him outside of the context of a bedroom. Or a shower. Or a kitchen table. He doesn’t know if their tentative comradery can carry them through a conversation where they can’t use their hands and mouths to smooth the rough edges. He takes a deep breath. At seventeen he dove to the bottom of a freezing lake to retrieve the Sword of Gryffindor. He can do this. Never mind he nearly drowned while being strangled by a locket, that’s not currently helpful to the positive attitude he’s attempting to cultivate.
Malfoy’s wearing a muggle suit, pitch black shot through with pearlescent grey, and clearly the height of sophistication. It was probably hand tailored. Harry makes a mental note to tell on him to Narcissa. Andromeda goes to put her arm around Malfoy, and lays a tasteful arrangement of orchids next to the daffodils. Malfoy lays his head on her shoulder in an uncharacteristic display of vulnerability, and Andromeda whispers something Harry can’t hear.
Draco kisses him quickly, there and gone again, like he can’t help himself. “There’s a spell I can use, to prepare you; I don’t like to use it often, but I don’t know how long I can wait. Can I use it?”
Harry nods, but still strokes up his sternum to his collarbone, before retracing the path with his mouth. Draco grasps Harry’s hair in his hands, and moves under the spray, pressing him against the cold tiles. Water darkens his silvery hair, slicking it back against his head, running down his neck and onto Harry’s tongue. Draco pulls Harry’s head back until it knocks against the wall and kisses him with a cruel and selfish tongue.
Harry’s breath hitches. “I liked it when you were, um, rough, but I don’t really know about- you know. BDSM, or whatever. I don’t think I like the idea of someone hurting me, or hurting someone else. I’m not judging, that’s fine if that’s your thing, but I’ve had enough of pain.”
He starts to stumble out of the pub, but Blaise grabs his arm. “Wait, I need to get you home, old chap. You’re too drunk to apparate, you’ll splinch yourself.”
“Oh Draco, your tea! It’ll ruin your trousers.” She rushes over, hovering, realising that she can’t exactly do anything when the spill is on Draco’s crotch. “I know some excellent charms for fabric so not to worry, dear.”
,” whispers Harry. At the far end of the room, nestled under oak beams, is a small round door. Almost like a porthole.
Draco draws his expression into an effortless mask of charm. “Well Molly, after tasting your cooking once, no other food compares.”
Draco fists Potter’s terrible, wonderful hair. If he can’t have Potter’s love, he’ll take everything else he can get. He starts to move his hips a little. Potter can’t take him in that far yet, so he’s not really fucking his face, but just the thought of it makes him burn. On his knees, eyes closed and lashes casting shadows on his cheeks, he looks like a painting. He’s art. Draco wants to defile him.
He keeps drinking. If this dream is telling him that Draco is going to die, he has to know. He has to know so he can stop it. Harry’s eyelids grow heavy. He hears the slight squeak of Granny’s chair as she wheels herself onto the staircase, and the low hum of the steps flattening and spiraling upwards, but now his eyes have closed. Harry stays awake long enough to be thankful that she left him in privacy- sometimes he flinches in his sleep.
that’s cutting him to pieces, leaving him certain that he’ll never be able to pick himself up from this table.
Draco’s heart stops. He tries to say one of the many other reasons why. All true, all part of his reasoning, but none are the whole truth. He can’t wriggle out of it; the potion compels him.
Draco’s smile is amused but not unkind. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed you have a submissive streak a mile wide.”
Harry just makes another pathetic sound, his cock twitching. The idea of making himself up all sweet and feminine and sexy for Draco is turning him on so much his knees might buckle. He closes his eyes so he doesn’t have to look them together, it’s too overwhelming to have both sight and sound right now.
“I don’t want you to cling to a memory, Draco. I want you to live.” Narcissa’s hands moves to stroke over his hair, trembling the whole time.
Draco smiles. That’s always been their way of saying ‘I love you’. He’s no closer to working out what to do about Harry, but he feels better anyway. Pansy’s stroking his hair, and nothing can touch them.
He steadily drinks his whisky, answering questions. Potter doesn’t join in, but he doesn’t move away either. Draco knows he’s listening, tracking every micro-expression out of the corner of his eye. Potter’s drinking fast. It’s only beer, and only his second, but if he keeps going at this rate he’ll be bladdered by the end of the night. It looks like he is still broken up about what he saw in the paper, and he’s trying to drink it away. He presses his thigh more firmly into Potter’s, feeling the heat of him. Reminding him he’s there.
He comes with a sound closer to a sob than a cry of pleasure. Collapsing back against Draco, he heaves in deep lungfuls of air. His body feels somehow heavy and weightless at the same time, only held up by Draco’s arm around him. Draco pulls out and turns him around, manoeuvring him effortlessly. Harry’s breathing begins to slow.
“They thought I was a squib you know. My brother, Rowan, he was the talent. We were twins, and people said he soaked up all the magic in the womb and left none for me. He didn’t care that I was a squib, though. We were thick as thieves- did everything together. Then I started having these dreams. Every night for a year I dreamt of him dying, getting clearer and clearer, until it actually happened.” She stopped to blow her nose, her eyes welling up.
Harry sighs. Anxiety has always made him tense and snappish. “Look, I’m sorry. We probably both have some growing up to do. That’s what I’ve been thinking about, by the way.”
The cat reappears, stepping delicately out of her back like nothing’s happened. She falls forward, catching herself on her hands, before her arms give out under the weight. Shaking his head, he tries to think. Draco and Granny need a healer. Fast.
Next is a stream of Simi’s fellow Masters students. A ragtag collection of people ranging in ages, but all with the slightly manic expression of people who have just finished something stressful and momentous. Simi circulates around the room, sometimes making introductions, and sometimes leaving them to it. Draco and Harry stand shoulder to shoulder, glasses in hand.
Draco just wants this to be over. He wants Weasley out of his house. Then again, he wants a lot of things he can’t have. You get used to it after a while.
“I suppose that confirms it, then.” Malfoy’s grin is sly. “Never play poker, Potter, or you’ll lose the shirt off your back.”
Potter hides his face more completely in the pillow, abashed, until he has to strain to hear him. “I miss you. I miss you inside of me.”
Tonight, Ron’s made homemade burgers on poppyseed buns. Harry can barely finish chewing long enough to answer Hermione’s barrage of enquiries about Arthur and Malfoy.
Harry pauses, measuring his words. “Tom Riddle’s diary had a piece of his soul in it, it came out and spoke to me. He described himself as a memory.”
You were made to feel this good. I want to make you feel like this all the time.” Draco’s voice is sweet and bitter, like strawberry gin. “You should be this full all the time. Stay inside you all day, all night. I’d just sit there for hours with you on my cock, not moving, just keeping you exactly where you should be.”
Harry obeys, taking the digits into his mouth and suckling. The shape of them in his mouth, pressing down on his tongue, provokes something in him. He can’t bounce up and down so vigorously with Draco’s fingers in his mouth, so he changes to a rocking, rolling motion. The change has Draco’s dick hitting his prostrate every time, and he can only suck harder at the fingers in his mouth.
Ronald’s mouth gapes open, the orange hue of his hair only serving to make him look even more like a goldfish. “Again?” he hisses, turning to his mother. “He’s here
He seems so vulnerable like this. Draco’s instincts are torn between wrapping him in cotton wool and eating him alive. Regardless, he’s happy to go at this cautious, teasing pace. His dick doesn’t recover as fast as it used to, and even though he got hard again pretty fast, it’ll still take a while before he’s ready to come again.
my book from the settee over there, but I dropped it half way through.” Harry looks over and sees there is indeed a book lying on the floor. “You might have noticed I rarely use my wand.”
He takes his time preparing him. Distantly, Harry thinks Malfoy’s back must be aching from staying in this position for so long. Leaning over, bent down to watch as his fingers are sucked into Harry’s body. He knows he’s watching, because he can feel his gaze like a physical touch, almost as powerful as the one inside him.
Just gone noon the next day, there is an angry pounding at his door. For a minute he panics that the Aurors have come to take him away again. He shivers, remembering the few days he spent in a cell in Azkaban, awaiting trial. Maybe someone accused him of putting poison in his cosmetics? Maybe someone’s cat went missing, and they decided he must have killed it for a dark ritual? Or, maybe, he’s being arrested for defiling the wizarding world’s Golden Boy. That’s not a crime, of course, but he doubts everyone will see it that way. They’ll probably pass a new law specifically for it. He takes a deep breath, and goes to the door. He hasn’t done anything wrong. Recently, anyway.
“Anyway, I’d always liked reading, so I joined the book club. The woman in charge was Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies professor.”
He can feel his orgasm building, and he just fucks Potter harder. Draco’s head is hanging down, pale hair falling over his eyes, as he comes with a drawn-out moan.
He talks fast, trying his best to keep his words clear. “There are three injured people at Granny Lynn’s shop in Diagon Alley, it’s urgent. Please come quickly.”
“I’d say you’ve got more to cry about than most,” sighs Draco. “And you’re certainly not spoiled. If affection makes you cry, it’s not your fault- it’s theirs.”
Draco looks stricken, his face pale. He knows that Simi’s a muggle, so they definitely don’t know his name because of that. The only thing that makes sense is that Draco’s mentioned him, but why would that make him look so panicked?
Draco laughs. “True enough. I suppose it’s only fair, after I asked you not to call me Malfoy. In bed, anyway.”
Privately, Draco thinks that people don’t give Luna enough credit. She’s more perceptive than people think. He’ll have to be more careful about teasing Potter in front of her. Draco feels his eyes on him, and turns to meet them. They immediately flick away.
Draco nods at him, and looks him up and down as he enters the hall. “What’s up with you? You look all…tidy.” He sniffs. “It’s unnatural.”
Slightly disturbed, Harry walks in. There is no bell, and the door closes softly behind him, but a voice calls “Just a minute!” from another room.
“We will need your help though, Harry. The Manor needs some restoration before we can get the Centre up and running.”
Draco keeps jerking his hips, still hitting that sensitive spot, making Harry keen with overstimulation. He kisses Harry almost chastely as he stills, filling him with a wet warmth. Harry deepens the kiss, using it to show everything he’s feeling, even if he’s not sure what that is.
Draco doesn’t turn up and harass Harry when he gets back to work on the ballroom on Monday, and part of him is disappointed, even though he knows it’s for the best. He’ll never get anything done if Draco keeps distracting him like he did in the attic last Friday. Still, he finds himself a little distracted anyway. He starts off with the same patch of soot he was attacking last Thursday, when Draco came and made his offer. If he squints, he can still see a slight footprint on the floor. He had stood in that exact spot and kissed Draco Malfoy for the first time.
“Drink this,” he says, and watches while Harry complies. “You know, when I was living as a muggle, I was stumbling from bar to bar trying to find something that would make me forget myself. Booze, sex, anything. I ended up in a leather bar, and I met someone there. I tried to proposition them, but they just got me a glass of water and sat with me until they knew I wasn’t going to throw up. I couldn’t remember how to find my way back to my shitty flat without magic. I didn’t know the city and everything looked the same to me. So, they took me home and let me sleep on their sofa.”
Ah. He should have known Hermione would want to pick the story to pieces. “No, I only had one drink.”
Harry cranes his head round towards him, still smiling. “You’re only calling me Potter because we’re talking about school.”
Harry looks him over again, a little surprised. He looks so powerful compared to Harry, magic notwithstanding. It also makes him wonder what Draco sees in him. Would he prefer if Harry was bigger, if he had more muscles? Then again, he did seem to like how Harry fit in his lap, how he could cover him with his body.
He knows the second Potter comes back to himself, because it no longer feels like he’s sat in a rowing boat on the middle of a stormy sea. The scene is still, and he can see everything. The unmitigated shitbag still has his fingers inside Potter, and his mouth is on one of his tight brown nipples. Fuck. Fuck. That must be why-
Draco seems to collect himself a little more, removing his fingers and reaching for a wand. He casts cleaning charms over them both, and settles back down, stroking over Harry’s skin like a nervous pet.
“Don’t say anything,” hisses Granny, removing the ropes from her niece with a careful motion of her wand and concentrated furrow in her brows.
He tries to stifle a whine in the back of his throat and doesn’t quite succeed, so he muffles it in Draco’s mouth instead. Draco palms Harry’s crotch, rubbing back and forth, and he can’t help but buck into the pressure.
Draco kneels down next to the bath and rests his folded arms on the side. He’s left his hair loose, without any of the product he sometimes uses, and it’s already starting to curl from the steam. Harry wants to touch it, but his hands are wet, and Draco would probably tell him off.
He lets himself be dragged into the wider conversation, something silly that Harry only half understands, but they seem to enjoy his lack of cultural know-how. He doesn’t mind being teased- anything to take away from the double tension of Draco wrapped around him and Samuel’s eyes boring into him. The alcohol is catching up to him, and he finds himself laughing more easily, leaning back into Draco’s warmth more freely. At one point, Draco’s thumb slips under the hem of his t-shirt and starts stroking absentmindedly at his waist.
He even kept his job at first- a cashier at Tesco’s. It paid the bills okay, and it was easy enough once everything was explained to him. Sometimes the customers got snotty, but after living with Old Snakeface, a middle-aged woman with an invalid coupon was nothing. But then he’d be stacking shelves, and all he could think about was flicking his wand until they were all in order, labels facing outwards. The final straw was his manager, Tony. He’d always made fun of him for being posh, and he could take that on the chin. He’d speculate about whether Draco was bent, and he was used enough to that. The final straw was when Draco wanted a few days off to help Simi after they’d come out of surgery, and Tony refused, so he just left instead. So, in the end, quitting his job had nothing to do with magic.
Draco hadn’t moved out right away. He was used to living without magic now, and he liked living with Simi. They were the best friend he’d ever had, and paying rent was hard enough with two people. Although, it had been easier to hide that he was a wizard when he didn’t have a wand. Every time the boiler broke, they had to scrape together the money to fix it, because the landlord never got around to it. Then, he would think about how easy it would be to cast a quick
“Yes,” says Draco, resigned to being asked numerous permutations of the same question until Weasley runs out of ways to phrase it.
Warm savoury aromas drift up the stairs. So, Draco really did make breakfast. He’d better go and take a look; if he ever managed to tell Ron and Hermione about all this, this is a story they’d want to hear. He pads downstairs and into the kitchen, immediately spotting his clothes folded into a pile on the chair. The smell of good food is stronger here, and the sight of Draco standing over the hob and pushing something round a frying pan is amusing in its domesticity.
She’s still frowning but she doesn’t push it, god love her. They make it through dinner, and Draco makes his excuses, Molly pushing leftovers into his hands before he goes.
Harry clutched the letter to his chest, holding his breath so Dudley wouldn’t hear him breathing from behind the curtain. Dudley continued to taunt him for a minute or two, before all fell silent. Harry sighed, relaxing his shoulders from where they’d climbed up to bracket ears.
“A Long-Eared Owl. Excellent for long distance delivery, an all-weather flyer, and this one in particular is a favourite of mine.” Athis extends their arm, and the bird hops from their shoulder onto their elbow. “What do you think?”
“What a view,” he says into Harry’s ear, meeting his eyes in the mirror, before roaming over his body. “I could look at you all day.”
“Malfoy,” huffs Potter in exasperation, craning his neck round to look at Draco. “Was that really necessary?”
Hermione launches herself at him, tackling him into a powerful hug, her hair catching in his mouth. “I’m so proud of you. We love you so much, and I hope you know this could never change anything.” She sits back, and cups his face in her hands. “You’re family, and whoever you decide to be with, they’ll be family too.”
Draco nods, and kneels on the bed. Potter turns over so that he’s lying on his stomach, and Draco decides that if he lets him, he’s going to fuck him like that sometime. When he spreads Potter’s cheeks a little, his hole looks red and used. Draco feels a thrum of satisfaction. Dipping a finger in the pot, he brushes delicately over the rim. The salve is cool and tingly on his skin, and he doesn’t have to wonder how it feels for Potter. After all, he invented it for himself, after tying someone down and fucking himself on their cock rather too roughly, a few too many times. He always likes the burn in the moment, but it grows old pretty sharpish once it’s over.
“Luna?” he calls, looking up into an empty room. The lights are off, and he realises how late it is. She’s probably in bed. Cursing, he starts to stand up, when he hears footsteps.
If it was up to him, he would never go back to that godforsaken place. But the Weasley’s are his family now, and Arthur needs him to. Harry sighs, and hopes he can at least do it without running into Draco Malfoy.
He stands just metres away, his wand already raised, and holding the pocket watch in one hand. In the same split second that Harry draws his own wand and casts
“In my defence,” says Harry. “At the time two people were unconscious, one couldn’t breathe, and then I collapsed as well.”
“She does, but I think she’s hiding. She says she’s spending most of her time with you, but I don’t think she wants you to see her.”
A few people at the front look to each other, unsure who to elect as spokesperson, but a teenage girl wrestles her way to the front of the crowd. “We saw the article!” she says, brandishing a copy of today’s
“We don’t drink this stuff to enjoy it, nor do we want the image distorted by the shape of the mug,” says Granny. He nods vigorously as he listens, committing it to memory. He can hear the kind smile in her voice as she continues. “Though I suppose this sort of thing is what you’re here to learn, after all.”
“Wait,” interjects Draco. “Even if the memory of a cat somehow became a ghost, that doesn’t explain how it healed me.”
“Come in mate,” he says, standing back to let his guest inside. That sounded normal, didn’t it? That sounded like something a friend might say. Harry winces. He’s such a bloody idiot.
They go inside, the warmth of the fire hitting their cold skin. A few old men at the bar nod at Malfoy, one raising his glass towards him. A ghost in a flat cap sits on one of the stools, but the muggles don’t appear to see him.
Harry is silent. What would it have been like, to have been looked after this way- if he’d always had people to care about him? Would he still be as fucked up as he is now? Harry has a tendency to blame everything that wrong and strange about his mind on the war, but he realises now that it’s not the whole truth. Something’s been wrong with him for a long time. Longer than he can remember. Draco stands, and uses the towel around Harry’s shoulders to scrub at his hair. He takes the towel, folding it precisely in two before he hangs it back on the rack. Looking back at Harry, his face pales.
No matter his misgivings about his own body, the brief flare of humiliation soon fades. Draco is always effusive with praise, especially in bed, and is quick to make Harry aware whenever he finds something new he loves about Harry’s body. So, while he might call himself scrawny, he knows Draco doesn’t see it that way. Draco loves how easy it is to pick him up, to manoeuvre him how he likes, how he can pin Harry down and cover him entirely. His hair might be messy, but Draco loves to run his fingers through the thick curls and Harry loves the feel of him doing it. He loves when Draco pulls on it. Several times he’s been pulled aside in public, a heated whisper in his ear telling him how frustrating it is that he always looks freshly fucked, and how tempting it is to make that a reality.
“I stunned her,” sobs Aisling, “And took the watch. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, I just wanted to take back what was ours. To make my Grandpa proud.”
He sighs, and strokes Draco’s back. He could wait. He could give it time and see how things go. Or. Or he could try and woo the pants off of Draco Malfoy. Well. He never was one for slow and steady. And they’ve already slept together, surely asking him on a date can’t be so scary? Harry swallows, opens his mouth, and closes it again. He was wrong. It’s terrifying.
He peels his fingers off the desk one at a time, and turns to face Potter. His eyes are wide, anxious, and Draco desperately wants to make him smile again. He walks back over and climbs onto the bed again, pulling Potter into his arms. His words never seem to make anything better, in fact they often make things worse, but he knows how to do this. Draco rests his cheek on top of Potter’s head, stroking a hand through his hair.
“No,” he says, shaking his head. “Only the Master of the house, or the house itself can do it. All you have to do is say: ‘
Now that he’s closer, he can see Arthur is holding a VHS tape. The bold writing on the front reads ‘Dances with Wolves’. Now that Arthur’s distracted them, he needs to get out of this mess. He needs a minute alone to compose himself.
Hedwig. In the summer after his first year, when he was imprisoned in his room and thought his friends had forgotten him, Hedwig got him through it. With a tug on Earl’s lead, he changes their direction, and heads towards Eeylop’s Owl Emporium. It’s much the same as he remembers it- cramped, stuffy, and stinking of owl dropping. Soft hoots punctuate the air like question marks.
Ginerva shrugs her shoulders, recovering from her shock almost instantly. “I’ll have a cider thanks, Malfoy. Whatever’s on tap.”
Draco stands, and lifts him into his arms like a child before placing him carefully back on the bed. He snags the covers from their pile at the foot of the bed and pulls them over Harry, before climbing in next to him.
Draco nods. “Tonight, then. Come to mine at seven o’clock, and don’t be late. We’ll need the whole evening.”
Big thank you to Dia3012 for all your help, and to everyone who commented and left kudos for giving me the motivation to finish this! I was too nervous to write fanfic for years, but I'm so glad I finally did. It was especially fun to put my Tarot skills to use.
“Do you know, Mr Potter, where sinners go when they die?” He did not wait for an answer, choosing instead to provide one for himself. “They go to a place where fire pools like water, where smoke smells like rot, where chains bind your wrists and ankles. Liars, especially, suffer there.” He nodded to himself then, as if impressed by his own poeticism. “Yes, there is a chamber reserved specifically for the torture of liars. There devils burn the tongue from your throat, before bidding it grow back and starting all over again.”
“Whenever you are not here, I will be with Draco. There’s no point me being here by myself, and I won’t follow you outside the house. My reception may not be…friendly.”
“I can understand that, but I didn’t have any control either. So why don’t I want that too? Why do I want to-”
Malfoy winds a hand under Harry’s stomach to lift Harry’s hips off the table, and wraps his other hand around his cock. Harry inhales sharply. Malfoy’s balance is unsteady now, so he slides the hand on Harry’s stomach up to his chest and positions them so they’re almost upright, with Harry bracing his hands against the table. The new angle means Malfoy rubs inside him in a different way, and remembering that he wanted to hear him, he doesn’t stop the noises from spilling out.
Harry sighs in relief, and pulls his own t-shirt off from where he’s lying diagonally across the rumpled sheets. Terran pulls his trousers the rest of the way off, and peels his socks off one at a time. Rubbing his hands up and down Harry’s thighs, he whispers something to himself that’s sounds a little like
“I don’t mind,” mumbles Harry, hiding his face in his Draco’s chest. “I don’t mind if he thinks that.”
He deliberately neglects to remove the body bind; it’ll wear off in less than an hour anyway, and it’ll do him good to have some time to reflect on what led him to that point. The doorstep is still under anti-muggle detection charms, so they won’t have to worry about concerned passers-by. He shuts the door with a slam, turning round to see Harry stood in the kitchen doorway.
Harry stares into one of the mugs and jabs the teabag aggressively with a spoon. “Did you believe what you said? Do you really think I want to be friends with you because of the life debt?”
. The shop window is filled with notices, spelling out cryptic messages. One warns that if your name is Sally and you have a pet lizard, you need to call your mother. Another advises that if you have green hair and a birthmark on your left buttock, it would be wise to check your food for poison.
“Draco Malfoy,” he huffs. “And he says we can use Malfoy Manor as our premises, as he and his mother haven’t lived there since the war.”
On one of these walks, he walked into an empty classroom that wasn’t as empty as he’d thought, and caught Dean and Seamus in an awkward position. He stammered an apology, left them alone, and shut himself in his room. Three days later, after much introspection that consisted mostly of wanking, he realised he was bisexual.
By that evening, he has his head stuck in Ginny’s fireplace. “Gin, have you got a minute? I think I’m having some kind of mental breakdown.”
Ginny wipes her eyes and shakes her head. “Anyway, I didn’t really think about the fact she was a girl until we were already kissing.”
Draco blinks, face frozen in shock for a moment, but the sudden smile that follows is blinding in its intensity. “Yes, I would like that.”
Harry suspects he might be a bit of a freak. Not that he judges Draco for his desires, or anyone else for that matter, but the suspicion is there all the same. That’s what the Dursley’s called him. Freak. Sometimes the niggling voice in his head sounds a bit like Petunia. When things are really bad, he can hear Vernon shouting, see the vein jumping in his face. He can imagine the horror and disgust on their faces just at the thought of Harry sleeping with a man, let alone anything else.
It’s probably only because Harry’s drunk that he says: “He’s actually a lot more, er... tender, than I thought he’d be.”
Six months later, the Charity Burbage Centre is ready to open to the public. Harry watches from across the room as his boyfriend gets snippy with one of the decorators. He’s too far away to see what the fuss is about, but Draco’s making frustrated gestures and his lips are pursed in a way that straddles the line between comical and adorable. Harry’s leaning towards adorable, but that’s probably just because he loves him.
Draco stops himself from falling on top of him, but only just. He’s clearly still lost to the world, gathering Harry into his arms and brushing kisses up and down his neck.
, he finds out for certain that Draco doesn’t want him back, it won’t be because he’s straight. It’ll be because it’s Harry.
Of course he still wants to come, but that doesn’t make him any less anxious. As usual Draco directs this nervous energy into obsessing over what to wear. He needs to give the exact right impression. Obviously they’ve all met before, so first impressions are out the window, but he needs to show he’s changed. He can’t have them thinking he’s the same old tosser he was before. He’s still a tosser, but he’s definitely not the same.
Malfoy doesn’t voice his agreement, but he also doesn’t object to the use of ‘we’. They make an unlikely pair of tour guides. As they go from room to room Malfoy recounts it’s original use, and whatever damage has been done to it, while Arthur gives his ideas for what it could be used for. Harry then explains how the necessary changes could be made. Malfoy is quiet, not speaking more than he has to, except the occasional quiet jibe. Although, they are never directed at Arthur. He seems to be on his best behaviour with him, and Harry gets the sense that he is holding back his harsher comments about Harry on his account.
Harry tries to think of all the things he loves about Terran. His brash sense of humour. His affectionate touches. The quiet nights they spent talking about everything and nothing. They get on well, most of the time. Is that enough? These days Harry’s not so sure.
Trying to escape from these thoughts, he kisses Draco again. The kiss is small, almost shy, testing the waters. Does he still want him, after seeing him cry? Draco makes a soft noise, and kisses him back. He meets him with the same tentative questions on his lips, his tongue, as he licks into Harry’s mouth. Draco pulls their hips flush.
Harry is just about to suggest that they continue another day when Arthur can join them, suspecting that the buffer of Arthur is the only thing stopping them from devolving into a shouting match, when Malfoy speaks.
“The rules are a little different today,” he says. “The first one is the same. Keep your hands where I put them; don’t touch yourself unless I tell you to.”
Draco’s glad he didn’t murder Dumbledore. He’s glad he didn’t identify Potter and his friends at the Manor. He’s glad he didn’t kill anyone at all, in the end. He has plenty of regrets as it is, he doesn’t need to add more by worrying over what he could have done. Still, he wasn’t lying about pushing Potter against a shelf. When he was at Hogwarts, studying in the library, his eyes would drift over to the rows of shelves near the back, where couples would slink away to kiss. He’d tried to imagine kissing imaginary, faceless boys, but they all turned into Potter.
Weasley leaves with considerably less fanfare than when he arrived, his hostility merely simmering rather than boiling over. Draco slumps down into the large armchair, wishing Potter was in his lap again. Wishing he could bury his nose in his hair, breathe him in, let his anxiety drift away. But he can’t. He’s alone, and he’s just offered to relive something awful. Much like using a pensieve, he hasn’t been under verituserum since his trial, and it’s another experience he didn’t anticipate having to repeat. Being forced to spill all his sins, his fears, his desires, to a panel of unfeeling faces was… harrowing.
Draco does so, and the sound of Narcissa’s song fills the room. Her voice is low, with a slight wavering quality. The words wash over them, both stirring and soothing something inside him.
“There,” says Zabini, standing back to look at him with his hands on his hips. “Not half bad, if I do say so myself.”
“No, but really,” continues Harry. “What made you want to do it? I’m guessing it’s to do with the time you spent in the muggle world, with Simi and everyone, but joining up with Arthur still seems like a stretch.”
He feels a stiff gust of wind, and Bunny swoops down to land on the fence. Earl gallops towards her, barking like mad, and tries to jump up at Bunny.
Harry gasps. He’s present enough in his mind to know that he really should want to punch Malfoy right now, but instead he just cants his hips up, hoping he’ll say it again.
Scooping up a generous amount of salve, he uses it to coat his prick, rubbing it up and down. Lying back over Potter, he lets almost his full weight rest on him. Potter makes a punched-out noise, but he just waits, making sure his chest is still rising and falling. Satisfied that Potter can breathe just fine, he slips inside. Holding still for a long moment, Draco dots kisses over the sweeping curve of his neck and shoulder.
“There you go,” he says, handing it back to Draco. “You’ll have to look on your own, I don’t really want to see it again.”
“Hello, Earl Grey,” he says. Earl lets go of the fabric clamped between his teeth, and begins to lick Harry’s hand. Harry picks up the dog and tucks him under his arm like a baguette. “Let’s get you home.”
Most Friday nights Harry has dinner with Ron and Hermione. They take it in turns to go to each other’s houses, and this time it’s their turn. Thankfully, Ron is cooking. Hermione never burns anything, but she’s never gotten the hang of balancing flavours, so everything is either too bland or else it scours your tastebuds.
Harry hisses a series of expletives as Draco moves up and down, nose brushing the hair at the base of Harry’s cock he takes him in so deep. He doesn’t get spit running down his chin like Harry had. In fact, he looks composed, like he would be smiling if he didn’t have to watch his teeth. That just won’t do. If Harry’s a mess, it’s only fair if Draco is too. But how to do it?
