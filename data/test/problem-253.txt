“Most of the time we don’t make it back to the house.”
“You’re one to talk, Potter,” Draco returned, sharply, shooting him an unimpressed look. “I’m not the one who locked myself up in the dorms for five days. Over-dramatisation at its finest.”
that term - was simply not enough to exempt them from due punishment, in newly appointed Headmistress McGonagall’s eyes.
“You’re up, Lovegood.”
Harry’s eyes widened, panic setting in quickly, as the water serpent rose high in the air from the lake and then crashed back down, creating a tidal wave that - thankfully - pushed the current in their favour and the three of them hurriedly swam in the direction of the shore with the creature in close pursuit.
Harry huffed a bit, more laughter than anything else, and turned his head to look at him, fingers tightening around his, instinctively. “I’m not bolting now.”
“And the game sucked you in?” Harry asked. “Just like that?”
Harry opened his mouth. To protest, he’d thought, but found himself saying; “Firewhiskey. Double, thanks.”
Harry bristled, getting to his feet. “I did not
Harry frowned. “You’re not coming?”
“Does that mean you’re stuck here?” Harry asked, as he looked around at the woodland and the small living space he’d built. “Indefinitely?”
Even if the scenery was stunningly beautiful and distracting.
“Maybe we should give them something to talk about, then,” Harry said, before he had really finished thinking it through.
“Has he done anything to us since we arrived here that makes you think we shouldn’t?”
Harry laughed, pulling Draco's hips against his as he lay back down, drawing Draco on top of him. “Shut up.”

before a tongue delved deeper with a moan into his mouth, and then hips ground against his once, twice, hard and needy as him.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but it caught in his throat when he felt Draco’s teeth nip at his earlobe, and he suddenly just wanted this bloody game to be over and done with, already, so he could get him back to the dorms and...well...a repeat of the previous night would be more than welcome.
“Some. Only, I ran away. Did you?”
And now he felt ridiculous, but the swell of jealousy came upon him more strongly, as he found himself wondering if Draco
It was wonderful and
Like hell was he going to tell that to Luna, though.
know the only reason the Elder Wand worked for me in the end was because you were its Master first.”
Almost all of the Slytherins had returned to Hogwarts. Exempt, apparently, from the Ministry promises of greener pastures and gratitude for those who had fought on the right side of the war.
- and his stomach jumped when he caught Draco looking straight back at him.
There was a rush, a buzzing in his ears, and then a pull deep in his stomach just like before.
Harry realised he was gasping, still trying to catch the breath that had been stolen from him, and he reached up, absentmindedly brushing at the wetness of his forehead.
Harry raised an eyebrow, sliding his foot up a bit further, getting closer and closer and Draco would
“You were waiting for me.”
They missed their deadlines on their assignments and negotiated new ones with charm, without shame.
A raft, Harry quickly realised, though it hardly looked like anything seaworthy.
“Alright?”
“Don’t worry, Potter -” Draco said, making his way in the direction of the clothes. “Your pristine image is perfectly safe.”
Malfoy found him a little while later.
He barely had time to register what had happened - to take notice of Draco and Luna and that they were alright - before something else broke the surface of the water a few feet behind where the logs of their raft were separating and drifting away from one another down the current.
He glanced over at Luna, who was going through the cupboards of the cabinet a few feet away with much more finesse than Harry was looking through the drawers - everything he’d gotten his hands on shoved aside when he’d determined their uselessness - and then at Regulus, who was sitting on the couch, one ankle resting up on his knee as he flicked through a journal that had been on the bookshelf.
He wanted Draco’s mouth back on his cock or his mouth back on Draco’s or their mouths back on one another’s so Harry reached for him, pulling Draco up and kissing him, their lips almost frenzied against one another.
“Accio wand!” Harry yelled but before it returned, he felt it.
a good game, wasn’t it?” Malfoy said, preening at the mention. “I imagine you’ll be an
think we owe each other anything," Harry said, before adding with a raised eyebrow. "In any case, you still couldn’t do it, could you?”
Harry waited until Draco looked back at him, confused at Harry’s silence, before he grinned. “We should do it again soon.
for the time it takes to finish it.”
good at following the rules. Just ask my brother.”
—but he turned back to his drink.
Grey eyes, silvery in the moonlight, that would brighten just that little bit when Harry stepped towards him and the slight tug of his lips in that almost-smile as they passed a bottle of firewhiskey between them that Draco had snuck from the Common Room stash, the words coming easier and easier each time.
“This is a
- soft lips parting immediately before a sweep of tongue against the bottom of Harry’s lip made him hum with approval, little sparks of heat and anticipation running all up and down his skin.
“There’s the Awards Ball.”
He was close, very close, to the edge - to safety - when he felt a tug on his ankle before it became a yank that hauled him back under the water just as he clawed at the bank and broke the surface.
Harry grinned as Draco tugged him to his feet, kissing him, thoroughly, before shoving him in the direction of the bathroom, following hot on his heels.
“You wish.”
that surrounded him, twisting in the air, and he could see Draco and Luna in amongst the mist that they swirled in, and then a dementor that made him jerk in fright, and then a niffler that Harry realised must have come from the game the day before when it appeared in the classroom, and there was a flock of Cornish Pixies, all of them swirling in a vortex, until the dizziness made him squeeze his eyes shut.
Nothing of Draco moved but his eyes, flicking to the side at him from where they were focused on the map, but he was tense and evidently irritated at best, or furiously offended at worst and Harry drew in a breath.
Draco started to speak, just as Harry jerked the rudder a little too hard to avoid colliding with something in the water, cutting him off and sending him forward in a stumble, colliding with Harry where he stood with an
He’d seen that look enough times, even if Draco was making a pretty convincing effort of keeping it from appearing obvious.
Draco stared back at him, lips pressed together - with a look as if he had no idea what to do with kindness - before he scoffed, stepping by him. “You’d be the first.”
Harry opened his mouth but before he could say anything in defence of it, the niffler bit down on his finger -
Harry lifted his eyes skywards. “Is this how you like to woo your conquests, then, Malfoy? Sailing?”
“Oi!” the barman called—“Out!”—before the culprit was seized by security and tossed out of the pub.
No one had ever made him
Malfoy’s grin was slow. “A date with Harry Potter. My dreams really have come true this week, haven’t they?”
For, first, came the dancing.
Eighth Year’s would find themselves in detention - what with you all being of age.”
“You think I care about that?” Harry snapped, furiously at his back. “I
“Very true. Although if you look around, we are in a world of unbridled magic. And no war needed to be fought to win it. There is no family around to disappoint. The game can be cruel, certainly -” Regulus nodded, eyes going to the trees, and there was an odd thing like
and he found himself approaching, needing to make sure that - even if it was just this nothing,
“I don’t know what you’ve been so uptight about this week, Potter,” he practically sneered at him, in a way he hadn’t done so in months, now “You’re the one who jumped
Potter, is that you heard a story - that wasn’t even true - from a House Elf, and that’s enough for you to trust him.”
“Obviously that’s not how it worked," Harry scoffed, elbowing him in the side. "I’ve seen things, too.”
Harry had wondered, each time that he and Draco had come upon one another and spoken - each time getting a little bit closer to this - what he would have done. If Voldemort had taken up residence in the Burrow and threatened to do to Ron and Hermione, to the Weasleys - to anyone he loved, his family - the things he was doing to Draco's family, whether or not Harry would have done something different.
He smelled as good as he looked and Harry tucked his nose just so behind Malfoy’s ear. It’d look far more convincing to onlookers this way, Harry told himself. And then told Malfoy, just to make sure he didn’t get the wrong idea or anything.
- enjoy them and that he knew exactly what to say to provoke it.
Harry drew in a breath, eyes going to his hands in his lap, and when he didn’t go on Draco looked at him, and there was both guarded curiosity and distrust and a tiny bit of something that looked like hope when he did.
Harry glanced away at the swell of guilt.
Draco eyed him, looking off-balance at the gesture, and Harry could have laughed at the absurdity at it. At the fact they’d touched and kissed and made one another very nearly beg just a few nights ago, and yet Draco was flustered by something as simple as hand-holding.
His own voice sounded further away, barely more than a whisper, quiet on the breeze, but even then he could hear the shame behind the words.
“Well. You’d be very welcome,” Regulus said not missing a beat. “Though, I have to say, I don’t think that description fits you particularly well.”
Draco had that look about him at the familiar words. The very one that Harry realised had been getting him into trouble these past few weeks. The look that made Harry’s mind war between wanting to kick or kiss him.
“And you have nothing to do with it.” Harry rolled his eyes before looking pointedly at the magazine still lying on the bar.
His stomach flipped as he stumbled back, helpless against it without magic, only just dodging the first snap of its jaws.
“Pity me at your peril, Potter. I’ll have my wand back soon enough.”
Pushed down the unwelcome thought that he knew exactly how his hair felt between his fingers.
Malfoy grinned, lifting and opening it up to the article.
He released a breath, eyeing it, before he glanced back at the lake.
Harry’s eyes lingered, again, taking in the way silvery grey eyes were set, determinedly, on their intended path. The way his tongue flicked out against his lips that were starting to dry in the breeze. The way his hair stirred on his forehead as they sailed forward.
“I suppose I wasn’t,” Draco humoured him, a smile playing on his lips, before he went back to making his sandwich, adding as if an afterthought. “We should do it again, sometime.”
“Could get used to this, I suppose,” Draco admitted, when they finally drew back but not far.
There was bewilderment in the room as she studied it, at what had happened in the meantime to have evoked the return of a wand.
Harry watched Draco from where he sat on the doorstep of the cabin, Draco a few feet away, almost around the corner but not so much that Harry couldn’t see him, wielding his wand as if practicing something.
It thudded and there was a crash on the other side, another thud once, twice more, until the sounds settled and the boggart calmed and lay in wait for the unlucky person to come across it next.
Harry leaned in further and Draco did, too, closing any remaining distance between them, and urged Harry onto his back slowly with deep, searing kisses followed by nips of teeth against his neck, making Harry heat up, desperate for more;
It almost seemed too easy.
And it was then that Harry realised that, actually, this whole thing had been a truly tremendous mistake.
A soft exhale against his cheek reminded him of where he was - who he was touching - and he quickly pulled back, jerking as if burned, and looked away.
There was silence in the wake of his statement and Harry frowned, making to lean up and protest or something, but Draco spoke again before he could.
“Why not?”
“Are you accusing me of whisking his Saviourship off to a deserted island so that I might have my wicked way with him?”
“Mustn’t forget my manners and what not.”
He tossed a small wooden box onto the table in front of them that rattled, quirking an eyebrow. “Fancy a game, Potter?”
“Right. Of course. Never did get the impression you minded all the folk chucking their knickers at you.”
so they trailed everywhere, fingers stroking each area of exposed skin they could find, rewarded with Draco’s sighs and shivers above him.
The brief surprise on Draco’s face turned to alarm at the sound of leaves and undergrowth being disturbed as his eyes shot over Harry’s shoulder and Harry - immediately sensing that something was behind him - turned, and he found himself looking at a stranger; a man dressed in plain tatty clothing, with black, wavy hair and familiar grey eyes.
with once the dust had settled after the war and they’d come back to Hogwarts.

“Are you trying to cast a Patronus Charm?”
“Nice one, Potter.”

At the pieces of the raft that had separated into wreckage and were now being carried off by the current.
But Harry’s eyes didn’t stay on her for long, drifting away of their own accord towards the far end of the pitch where a whizz of white blond hair and pale blue robes shot by in hot pursuit of the Snitch.
A heavy silence fell between them, both lost to thoughts and memories for a while, and when Harry glanced back at the man who’d found them, Regulus’ gaze was on Draco.
“Hm, interesting -” Regulus said, looking at the wand with something close to longing, before he cleared his throat and tossed the book he’d been reading onto the table in front of the couch, getting to his feet. “Seems that note of yours wasn’t quite referring to within this cabin. Enjoy the soul searching, boys. I’m off to bed.”
“No knickers tonight,” Malfoy pointed out. “And certainly not. My lovers are wined and dined and courted, appropriately.”
If he thought Harry was in some way
He’d gone to the graves. To his parents in Godric’s Hollow. To Remus and Tonks. He’d stood at the closed door of Sirius’ bedroom, unable to go in. He’d told them all how grateful he was. How
The professors hadn’t known how to greet him and his fellow students weren’t much better.
“I know you have,” Draco agreed. “But they're hardly comparable, are they?"
“Yeah, I noticed.”
.” Malfoy laughed. “Oh. You should be so lucky. But we would make quite the handsome couple, don’t you think?”
It took a moment before his gaze refocused, turning directly upon him.
He stared at Malfoy long enough and closely enough that he knew—even when another cheer erupted in the Holyhead Harpies stand—that the Arrows were going to take the game. Long, pale fingers curled around the Snitch a split second before Malfoy reared his broom upwards amid the screams and cheers of the Appleby Arrow supporters.
Malfoy lifted a bread roll from one of the baskets, buttering it up as the others attending the function began filling the tables. Once he was done, Malfoy held the buttered roll to Harry’s lips. “Open wide.”
But he carried on first, stepping onto the narrow slats of wood, the bridge wobbling, immediately, with the weight of him. Someone followed, the bridge narrow so they had to move along in single file, and he could smell the scent of citrus that told him it was Draco.
She slipped away, fading slowly before him until she vanished from the spot where she lay, completely, leaving nothing behind.
They carried on that way for close to an hour without much luck - Harry and Draco on one side of the room, rummaging through drawers and nooks and crannies and loose floorboards, while Regulus and Luna carried on looking through the journals they’d come across, combing for clues.
if he couldn’t manage to tear his eyes off the back of Draco's head for a second, a sudden aching need to do something after what he’d just seen.
He reacted on instinct, just as familiar screams began to fill his mind -
Draco seemed satisfied enough with that - that it was something other than pity, that it was something at all - and leaned back against the couch cushions, more at ease now and tucked a hand behind his head.
They rolled out of bed five minutes before their first classes and frequently skipped out on meal times and feasts.
and expected that he must. At least according to the Mind Healer he had, thankfully, managed to ditch along with the Auror Programme.
Harry eagerly scooped up another handful of berries from one of the bowls that Regulus had set out on the table, while Draco eyed him disapprovingly from where he still stood some feet away, having not touched a thing.
“Pumpkin Juice and whatever the Great One here is having,” Malfoy said, when the bartender returned noticing their glasses were running low.
“What can you tell me about my cousin?” Regulus said, seeming to notice Harry had come back to himself without looking at him.
The sleeve and cuff of Draco's left arm remained rolled down and buttoned.
. What do you think they say about Death Eater scum who escape justice, do you think?”
Okay, maybe he
Draco suddenly drew back, the incredible feelings ceasing -
He’d done everything he was supposed to do.
“Maybe we ought to have taken our chances with the Hinkypunk,” Harry joked, eyeing the bridge in front of them.
A commotion outside the pub drew his attention from his drink, the sounds of camera flashes and calling voices becoming louder and turning heads as the door swung open, before none other than Draco Malfoy himself, crossed the threshold, pub security holding the press at the door which shut soundly behind him.
that filled the new area of the cave with light.
“Hm,” Malfoy said, looking at Harry consideringly. “You know what, so will I.”
Harry frowned, before meeting Draco’s eyes once more. “What happens when we run out of lives?”
Their coaxing calls, their soothing words, like siren calls luring them into the unknown.
Regulus didn’t wait for a response and headed on out from the cover of the bushes, making his way down the slope towards the cave with the three of them close behind.
Then a sigh and Draco closed the tiny distance between them, Harry suddenly feeling hands in his hair and lips pressed against his, the breath he’d held stolen from him by the surprise of it.
Harry rolled his eyes, about to make a retort but any reply died on his lips when Malfoy drew him closer, surprisingly strong arms surrounding him and Malfoy’s breath hot on his neck when he spoke close to his ear. “I’ll lead. Just follow me.”
Profuse apologies and more drinks on the house immediately followed.
Draco steered the raft effortlessly, easily managing to straighten them back up on course, and Harry realised he wasn’t lying.
“So, a few of us are heading down to the pitch,” Ron’s voice made him jump, Harry turning sharply to find him standing behind him, with his broom. “You fancy it?”
Draco started to step back.
rather than make any helpful contribution to the task that had been assigned to them by Professor McGonagall.
Harry landed unsteadily on his feet, with a gasp on his lips and a lurch in his stomach at the turbulence of the unexpected apparition, fighting back a wave of nausea as he regained his footing.
“Hm.”
Harry realised when he shifted - finding his back pressed to the trunk of a tree - that, at some point while they’d been disorientated, they’d ended up huddled in close together, taking cover against it.
Luna followed suit a second later.
couldn’t have been further from his mind that night.
He liked that.
Their conversation came to an abrupt halt—though Harry’s giggles carried on, while Malfoy pursed his lips in an obvious attempt to smother a smile—as their table began to fill with others attending the function. The majority were Malfoy’s teammates and their dates, as it happened, and Harry was quietly relieved to have escaped his usual seating arrangements, which typically consisted of Kingsley and Robbards—two he didn’t so much mind—along with other high ranking politicians and Ministry Officials, which tended to make for extremely dull dinner conversations, indeed.
Harry ineloquently scrambled to his feet and Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him, obviously amused. But Malfoy said nothing, just offered his arm—for appearance’s sake, Harry knew—and Harry took it, playing along as they moved with the crowd into the ballroom, while Harry pushed all thoughts of Malfoy’s warmth and
“As Lovegood said, it’s a notorious game.”
- beyond the veil before him, that couldn’t be felt in the others.
Harry swallowed, turning back to the Veil, and drew in a breath - steadying himself and pushing down his nerves - before he stepped through.
why Harry had come back to Hogwarts and he’d craved to be seen as he had been before, so who was he to complain.
He felt a flurry of fabric being thrown over him, before finding himself face to face with Harry, and those sparkling green eyes that shone so brightly, sometimes, that Draco caught his breath.
“What do you do, send bouquets of red roses and invite them to take tea?” Harry was still laughing, taking off and cleaning the butter from his glasses.
Draco didn’t look convinced, his eyes on nothing, with the same hauntedness in them that Harry had seen earlier that day before he'd kissed him. That he’d, sometimes, been able to see in the months since they’d come back to Hogwarts.
“I...er. I just wanted to say that it was good. For me. Um...really good, actually.”
“Your prick didn’t seem to mind the idea a little while ago.”
It was busy, neither he nor Harry particularly early risers, but he noticed Harry had taken a seat at the Eighth Year table with a spare one opposite and - at Harry’s glance his way - he took that as an invitation and headed over, sitting opposite.
“Er…wha - why are you -” Harry stuttered, his cock well and truly springing to life now when Draco undid
And then started this. Whatever
Harry couldn’t even see it fall, the cave suddenly plunged into complete darkness when the last of the lumos went out - Draco’s - to fight off the approaching dementors from above.
“I never knew that,” Draco said quietly in his mind, and Harry remembered, then, when he’d said it. In the Astronomy Tower, some nights before.
A gytrash.
at the Awards Ball celebrating my team’s success this weekend?”
making Harry yelp in surprise at the sting as he dropped it and it scurried off in the direction of the cupboard at the back of the room, nudging and slipping into the tiny gap when the door wasn’t quite latched.
Harry drew in a breath and nodded, even if Draco didn’t bother to wait until he’d done so before he stepped through.
He was pretty sure Harry had just got him all wound up on purpose.
“I went back every night,” Malfoy finally said.
Something that wasn’t quite a smile appeared on Regulus’ face, while he glanced down at the long, pale wood in his hand. “Apparently the Game considers me a member of your little crew.”
Malfoy choked on his drink.
“It’s a
There was quiet for a minute, nothing but the sound of whoever stayed behind moving around in the kitchen area, preparing something to eat.
When no flash of light appeared, Regulus turned to them and smiled. “Well. Looks like you lot did it.”
The cabin was filled with Luna’s soft, dreamy voice, as she carried on imparting various facts about the species they’d encountered so far -
“Are you really thinking about staying here?” Harry blurted out, cursing his inability to play things cool and think a bit before speaking.
He gasped for breath, pulled on his memories, thought of Ron and Hermione and
Harry had also continued to notice—just as he had done at the beginning of the night—that Malfoy was really,
Harry shook his head, starting to say no, but Draco went on, regardless.
Something like
“Our next up is a magic quest. Right up your alley, Potter. Then again, if all your accomplishments come down simply to luck” - he eyed Harry, lips twitching - “how hard could it be?”
“It doesn’t work that way, Potter,” Draco’s words echoed once more, over the flashes Harry suddenly saw before him; the smiling, laughing,
unbearable, I’m willing to admit.”
Despite it now being April - seven months into the first school year since the war - he and Draco were actually the first and only Eighth Years to wind up in detention.
Harry honestly didn’t care.
It wasn’t the first time Harry had seen Malfoy play since he’d been recruited by the Appleby Arrows, so really, he shouldn’t still be getting that little jolt of disbelief at how sodding
The weight above pressed against him more insistently, surrounding him in heat and scent and giving him friction in all the right places.
Regulus’ smile turned from wry to fond, then. “You have your mother’s smile, you know. You ought to use it more often.”
He knew what was coming before it happened, the silent glide of a -
memory to latch onto. Should be easy, I think, in light of recent events.”
here, though, Harry.” Luna said, finishing up her own explanation as to why she was, while carefully folding the parchment in her hand and adding the Hogwarts wax seal. “In fact, I find it surprising that
“Hm.” Draco nodded. “Suppose it is.”
That was a bit of a lie, Harry supposed, and Draco smirked, knowing that, as he carried on making what seemed to be a sandwich.
Harry swallowed, his voice hoarse when he spoke. “This one.”
“I don’t need to convince myself of anything like that.”
Harry took a bite of the sandwich he’d prepared and then promptly almost choked on it when Draco emerged from the bathroom in only his trousers, his hair and skin still glistening from the water of the shower.
While every other part of Draco was sharp for him - his gaze, his words - Draco’s lips were soft and warm, tender yet insistent against his, and Harry’s hands went back to where they’d been before, grasping the front of his shirt and pulling him closer, as he parted his own to him, heating washing over him, a wave of warmth so much better than all the others Harry had been pretending he didn’t want to feel.
A faint whiff of sweet honeysuckle cut through the heated haze of his thoughts.
Harry closed his eyes, willing the world to stop spinning, willing the words to stop.
Regulus glanced back at him over his shoulder, eyebrows raised, with such a look that - for a second - Harry thought Draco just might find himself on the receiving end of a scolding about
Harry swallowed and glanced away - pushing away the recent memory of those lips on his - noticing Regulus and Luna now deep in conversation, before he carried on with peering through the drawers in front of him, keeping his eyes focused intently on
“Er…” Harry began, uncertainly, before grasping the hair at the back of his head.
Before Harry could gather his bearings, Draco had him pinned to the back of the couch, his mouth moving against him mercilessly, tongue teasing and teeth nipping as they worked down his neck, over his chest and across his stomach, before taking Harry swiftly in his mouth, everything happening so fast - every sensation new and exquisite and overwhelming - that Harry couldn’t help the groan that escaped him when his cock was suddenly engulfed it the hot, wet heat of it.
about it and what it had been, for Draco, it had just been another week.
Harry started to speak, to say something, but he clammed up, knowing whatever he was about to say would be something ridiculous.
Then there were kisses on his neck, those soft, teasing, tender ones that no one had ever pressed upon him before, the kind that could make him melt - and Draco was duly mortified at the thought, that he’d melt for him - but he leaned into it nonetheless.
Even if it was a long one.
Draco shot him a look, the same exasperation in his eyes as had been there when he'd mentioned the Elder Wand, before he averted his gaze, staring at nothing.
The wand sparked, the slightest sliver of light, that promptly dwindled into nothingness.
If he ignored the fact that they'd been unexpectedly locked in when the door had swung closed behind them, the cabin actually seemed more like a holiday home than the creepy dwelling Harry had expected when they’d seen it from their vantage point in the forest.
“The dewmander appeared quite out of nowhere.”
Draco glanced at the timepiece - seeing four fifty - and then carefully placed his bookmark between the pages and snapped the book in his hands shut. He put the book on the side table, getting to his feet, and smoothed down his completely smooth, impeccable robes.
“Maybe I ought to stay here with you then.”
Draco smirked, raising an eyebrow, his eyes warm, now, when they’d been cautious and guarded before. “Well. That was an eventful twenty minutes.”
“Fuck this game.”
Harry noticed Regulus’ eyes lingering on Draco’s back as the rest of them followed, Draco several paces ahead and speeding up until he stopped, suddenly, Harry feeling the reason
“Playing at being a hero, was he?”
It was an easy walk from where they’d appeared down to the shore of the lake.
Draco lowered his wand, looking neither surprised nor even disappointed - just resigned - before he cleared his throat. “Well. I have to say I’m disappointed in you, Potter.”
“That your relentless pursuit of me in school was about more than just a desire to prove I was the human embodiment of pure wickedness.”
“Come here -”
This one was surer, Draco's lips seeking his even before Harry had finished leaning in, while hands came up to grasp Harry's hips and pull him in closer, as if this was expected - and
“Dear Cousin Regulus. What's
Draco eyed him, his fingers twitching as if itching for his wand, before he spoke in perhaps the most imperious tone Harry had ever heard from him. “What business is that of yours?”
“Well, you should know better than to take whatever the Prophet says at face value.”
Instead, he’d reassured Ron and Hermione that he was just fine and watched as they fell even more deeply and daftly in love. He’d forced a smile and a laugh at dinner with the Weasleys every Sunday and was left exhausted from the effort. He’d shied away from Ginny’s attempts to touch until he’d finally pulled away, completely. And he’d barely been able to meet his Godson’s eyes.
“Don’t do that, Potter.”
He’d gone to every funeral. He’d shaken every hand. He’d cut every ribbon on the newly restored buildings. He’d spent hours every day writing until his hand cramped and refused to oblige, determined to respond back to every letter himself, even if, logically, he knew that was impossible.
Draco, however, was totally unaffected by both what had just happened and by the look Harry was giving him, and he lifted the map, almost lazily, showing the single visible sketch and words to the two of them.
The - granted, few - sounds Draco had made weren’t something Harry would be forgetting about any time soon.
Malfoy put a hand to his chest. “That hurts, Potter.”
pretty dramatic - it had certainly felt like it at the time. The double whammy - triple, even - of getting caught, his very first time with his cock out with anyone, and that person being a bloke - when he didn’t even know he
They weren’t going to outright lie, they’d decided. They’d simply treat this as if it really were a date and let the rumour mill run wild with it. That would be more than enough to keep their attention diverted elsewhere.
And then he pushed himself from the beam he was leaning against - plucking up an apple from the table and leaving Harry to it - before he made his way from the fort to the treeline, where Luna was standing amongst a group of four thestrals.
It hadn’t felt like just messing around at the time. It had been...well. More than what Draco was making it out to be, anyway. For him, at least. Then again, he hadn’t exactly had much experience in stuff like this.
Before returning to Hogwarts, he’d simply coasted by from May until September, adrift with the war behind him, suddenly purposeless while simultaneously being told it was a time to celebrate,
“Not as wrong as they’d be about your Saviourship, Potter.” The words were laced with wryness, over softness, but there was a flutter within Harry all the same, both then and now. “You literally died for them. Most of us didn’t deserve that, either.”
Malfoy took a swig, knocking back the newly received firewhiskey in one go. “I say. You always do cause such a stir, Potter.”
Harry’s.
Luna stopped breathing.
“You at least give them breakfast, I hope.” Malfoy eyed him.
The statement - he’d heard it before - had already been spoken between them.
Or, perhaps, she was just so stunned at the state she’d found them in, up there in the Astronomy Tower on Monday night, that she’d slipped back into what was comfortable -
“He lost.”
He’d thought he wouldn’t care if it was about him and Malfoy—a nothing thing—but...well...he was definitely wrong on that. It was actually even more annoying than ever.
"We've surely faced worse than this, Potter." Draco glanced at him out the corner of his eye. “Is this what it feels like to fight alongside the Great Saviour of the Wizarding World? I’d always wondered.”
“Just so we’re clear…”
Harry turned to him, sharply, only then noticing that there was a distinct lack of surprise or alarm on his face.
It came back to Harry in a flash, then, his memory mocking his own thoughts - the feel of Draco quivering beneath his touch - and he grinned, in spite of himself, and glanced away.
And they hadn’t parted ways right after, either.
Draco made his way down the stairs of the newly-established Eighth Year Tower.
“It was a waste of a life, is what it was,” Draco drawled, eyeing her. “We’re going to be facing a lot worse than rodents, Lovegood.”
For a second, Harry could see it all. All of the fear and the unease and the vulnerability that he’d only ever seen a handful of times. At the Manor. At the trial. In the Tower.
“Malfoy, give me your wand.”
Especially when he smiled.
There was something about the look the stranger had, then, that made it click, and Harry’s eyes widened, recognising him from the pictures he had seen.
than paid off in the end.
Harry rolled his eyes and flicked his wrist, giving him the finger.
Harry was suitably cowed by the statement. Malfoy hadn’t always been adored, after all.
Long enough, apparently, that the press had finally moved on from their musings as to whether or not the two of them, frequently coined as the ‘Golden Couple’ during their three years together, would eventually reconcile. Said musings had now become ponderings and investigations as to who the next person to
"You saved me. At the Manor."
Past the roaring and the shaking he thought he saw something else appear in the room - a swirl of blue - but he couldn’t think much of it, because his eyes were drawn to the sight of Draco twisting and vanishing from the room with a ‘pop’, as if in apparition.
“So. Malfoy.”
“He’s Regulus Black.”

Harry’s eyes drifted downwards, if only to escape from the intensity of the look that Draco’s gaze was starting to take on, but that was hardly one of his
“As you see.”
“How do we know which one?” Luna asked, with an understanding glance Harry’s way - the only other in the room that knew what had happened - before she cautiously followed Regulus to where he was standing.
“I wouldn’t want to,” Harry said, quietly, still looking at him.
“You consider this a mess?” Draco’s eyes were back on their hands. “I’ve found it rather enlightening, in fact.”
And then the memory shifted and Draco’s words became colder.

The foot was suddenly removed and Draco wasn’t sure if he was disappointed or relieved.
“People get...a
It was still a little bit strange, even months later, to have to make his way down from the skies rather than up from the cold, dark underground but, otherwise, it could have been any other Sunday.
There was a flash of brightness a little while later, building up before it sucked into the counter before where Draco was standing, leaving behind another wand.
“Oh?” Malfoy raised an eyebrow, and he had that preening look about him that made Harry scoff, good-humouredly.
“Would’ve helped if she’d given us a clue as to how she managed to find the
So, he’d woken on September 1st, impulsively packed his trunk before hastily sending off a letter to Kingsley -
Draco recognised the name, that much was obvious, as he regarded him with guarded curiosity.
“Of course I do.”
Draco didn’t sound nearly as panicked as Harry felt.
“Magic, Potter,” Draco said, and he had the nerve to sound exasperated with him. “That’s -”
Draco, who still hadn’t bothered to button up his shirt.
Draco smirked and Harry felt a boot against his calf for a second, briefly enough that it could have been an accident if grey eyes hadn't sparkled.
Harry made to follow, only then noticing that Regulus was heading back in the direction they’d come.
“You’ve hardly seen anything.”
“Pure as snow, then. Now I
Even if Regulus did vehemently protest that he would not be giving up that bed.
But Harry had that
Harry felt something, just from looking. A flutter in his chest and a heat under his collar.
before Draco’s hips jerked, and the sound and the knock against the back of his throat made Harry's own prick twitch with interest and he pressed the heel of his hand against it, at first to stay himself but changed his mind at how good it felt to be touched.
“No. I was engaged, in case you’ve forgotten.”
Harry regretted the statement instantly and Draco looked at him carefully before he nudged him aside.
It was so slight that, in the past, Harry might not have noticed it. He did now, though. The way Draco’s eyes softened, ever so slightly, at the statement before he lifted his chin in turn - the only acknowledgement he made otherwise to what Harry had said.
“I don’t know. Just is.”
so, anyway - unable to stop himself from frantically going back over in his mind any point where Draco might have already lost a life without them realising, and feeling his stomach flip at the thought - just as Luna stepped through.
Regulus lifted his shoulders in a shrug and there was mischief in his eyes that reminded Harry of Sirius.
“How do you know?” Draco looked at him, before turning to the Veil, with eyes full of doubt and suspicion.
“As long as they think I’m involved, they’re not going to be hounding anyone I’m actually interested in.”
It was broken by the sound of scuffling claws on the floorboards once more and Harry saw the niffler scurrying past and out the room.
Harry kept his gaze on him, letting him know that he meant it - that he saw him - and Draco rolled his eyes, pushing himself up from where he was lounging so he was now sitting alongside him.
“Yeah.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, as he dabbed at his lips with a napkin. “Correct me if I’m wrong. But are you saying that the extent of your dating experience is picking up random muggles in bars and shagging them?”
Where the hell was his
They kissed and stroked and got on their knees and used their mouths on one another beneath the lukewarm water, until they both came again, and when they stumbled back out of the bathroom a while later - the shower long-since gone cold - there was another wand lying on the couch.
Luna continually spoke at his side, Harry knew, identifying various magical species with the due wonder they deserved but he barely took in any of it.
Someone caught Harry’s eye across the otherside of the bar. Blond hair, blue eyes, and a build that was entirely similar to another man that Harry always struggled to keep his eyes off of. But then, maybe he was only seeing a resemblance because of all the fuss and questions he’d been fielding from the paparazzi these past few days. Harry smiled and the man smiled back, soft rather than sharp, as Harry half-expected—because
“Oh. Um...they’re still a bit damp, actually,” Harry said, as he buttoned up his torn shirt. “But -”
His own voice came out unexpectedly on a breath -
It was a younger, even more handsome and
“I might have done,” Draco said, smirking. “If you didn’t bolt every time you thought we were going to be alone.”
Harry smiled, pushing himself upwards with a yawn he couldn’t help, and leaned an arm over the back of the couch to look at him. “Set off your Harry sensors, did I?”
Harry didn’t realise how long he’d been staring until he got caught, Draco’s eyes flicking to his, suddenly, and dancing with such obvious amusement that Harry realised he’d known from some time that he was watching him.
None of which, apparently, warranted detention.
task, rather than letting them drift to where Draco still stood beside him.
Malfoy smiled. It wasn’t sharp or smug or mocking. It was just soft and real as Malfoy leaned in towards him.
Harry approached them, doubting that Draco had any interest in playing, now, even if he was doing a pretty good job of mustering up his usual mask of indifference.
Draco, however, and Regulus - especially - were far more inclined to just stay put at the cabin and wait, Regulus happily indulging in a second shower and proceeding to declare plumbing the greatest invention of the Wizarding World, while Luna was keen to explore the surrounding forest and Draco, well...Draco just made numerous suggestions that if they were staying another night that it was his turn for the king size.
Malfoy didn’t notice Harry at first—unsurprisingly, considering he’d chosen the most secluded area of the pub, at the bar up by the wall—and ordered a drink before turning to lean back against the wooden countertop, still smirking away at his ‘public’ and Harry openly scoffed into his drink before he could help himself.
The barman served them up, leaving them to it, and as Harry took a sip—or rather a gulp—of his own, he noticed that the two of them were still drawing the stares and whispers from others in the pub. It was something that would normally irritate him, the whisperings going on this long, particularly when he was out in company. But in this instance, the company was just Malfoy, and despite what might be being said—which Malfoy was entirely to blame for—there wasn’t anything to hide.
Brighter, even.
There were more lights, then. The blue shimmers of the will-o’-the-wisps leading them down a trail that, vaguely, Harry knew they shouldn’t follow but with gytrash on their tails there was little other option.
Harry noticed her eyes were on Draco, where he was at the other side of the Transfiguration Classroom, opting to take a leisurely
the intention.”
Draco strode passed him, his shoulder brushing Harry’s as it did and Harry was an idiot, because his stomach flipped at it.
“Draco, is it?” the man said, addressing Draco, with a look of undisguised interest. “Are you a Black?”
Harry’s eyes went back to Draco - because his eyes were
“What are you doing?” Harry shifted in his seat.
Draco's gaze lingered on him for a moment, before he lazily glanced over his shoulder at where it had fallen. “Four quests. Apparently this could take a while.”

Draco’s eyes snapped to his.
“How is this
The fluttering in his belly seemed to heartily disagree.
“Hm,” Harry recognised Regulus’ voice. “This place is rather well-suited to the lost and lonely cowards of the world, I’ve found.”
The Saviour’s Ideal Match?’—along with write-in columns—‘Write a Letter to Harry’—in papers and magazines, while photographers popped up here, there and everywhere, leading to articles such as last month’s, discussing the suitability of the woman who regularly sold fruit to him at the nearby market of being his new love.
“I think I’ll retire for the night, as it happens,” Malfoy said, adjusting the trousers of the muggle suit he wore, and it took all of Harry’s willpower not to look and see if Malfoy was actually being literal. Dress robes really did have an advantage over muggle attire, in circumstances such as these. “If we leave now, they may just think we can’t bear to keep our hands off one another much longer.”
This place was far too public for anything like that.
, Potter. Good grief.” Malfoy rolled his eyes before attaching it to the lapel of Harry’s dress robes, while Harry pointedly didn’t stare at the odd muggle suit that Malfoy was wearing.
over him now,
“You could always come back.”
Although, really, Harry knew what he was really flustered by was what it meant, rather than what it was.
All who could do life and love so much better than he could.
A screech of a stool scraping across the stone floor made him look up, sharply, just as Draco took a seat upon it on the other side of the desk.
Harry relaxed, slightly - he knew the spell for that - but any relief was quickly chased away when he still couldn’t find where he’d put his wand and he had a jolt of realisation that he must have left it behind in the classroom.
right?”
“Well,” Regulus said, clapping his hands together and nodding at the darkened woodland. “This’ll be you lot, then.”
was the one struggling with keeping his eyes on Draco through the conversation, his nerves stuttering to life and his words stuttering along with them.
Draco made hardly a sound, just a stutter of breath as Harry moved his mouth and tongue over him, hoping he was doing this right. He was pretty certain he was by the way Draco’s fingers grabbled and gripped at the cushion of the couch beneath him, hips twitching with every stroke of Harry’s tongue.
A silence stretched for long enough that Harry didn't think he was going to answer.
“Someone’s needy,” Draco murmured against his lips.
Draco smirked, unabashedly. “No doubt you’re right about Black, though. In which case, you’ll be on the floor, Potter. I was here first.”
He knew Draco had.
Draco walked on ahead, not waiting for the rest of them.
“Says the bloke who dragged us into this mess.”
“Luna,” Harry gasped, getting to his feet and hurrying towards her. “Are you alright?”
The daze that had come over him upon entering the forest had evaporated now, leaving behind only vivid comprehension of what had just happened, heat under the collar and - most fantastically of all - an extremely uncomfortable tightness in his trousers.
The man - Regulus - looked at Harry, sharply, showing interest in him for the first time as he looked him over.
Harry drew back the rolled up fabric he’d torn from the bottom of his shirt from where it had been pressed to his head, peering at it, though it was so soaked through that it was impossible to tell if the bleeding had stopped.
Harry felt a swell of affection - and relief - come upon him.
“Laugh it up, Potter. It hasn’t failed me yet.”
“It’s what?” Draco asked, in a tone that was clearly meant to sound nonchalant but was anything but.
grey eyes flicked down, briefly, letting Harry know that what Draco might not see he could definitely
“Think it’s stopped, now,” Harry said, though he pressed the soaked through piece of fabric back to his head.
you, Malfoy. And you didn’t exactly put up a fight about it at the time.”
Harry held his wand tight, comforted by the familiar pulse of magic that had been returned to him the day before as they carried on deeper into the cave.
The conversation that followed between them was short and awkward. But things had been a bit, ever since they’d split, so that wasn’t much of a surprise. It was, however, just the start of it, as more and more people began asking questions that were just as rude as they had always been, crossing the same boundaries that always bothered Harry before when it had been Ginny he’d been seeing. Or that one date, David, who he had foolishly dared take to a Ministry function a couple of months after he’d come out as bisexual and quickly came to regret.
“You’re coming with us?” Harry asked, surprised, as he got to his feet.
Footsteps on the stairs followed the words, an indication that the conversation was over and one of them had left.
“It’s the truth,” Harry said, meaning every word. “I wouldn’t have been able to do any of that if it hadn’t been for the people I had around me. Not everyone knows everything, but they
"I used to be able to see through him, you know. I saw the things he made you do. Some of them."
Harry drew in a steadying breath, finding that he was getting just a bit fed up of people showing up at the least opportune moments imaginable.
he could hear Draco, distantly - and then putrid, icy breath filled his lungs, suffocating him, and he knew what was happening, as screams filled his ears - his mother’s screams and the cries from that final battle, and then a cold, high voice;
all of the kissing and the touching and Harry could suddenly forget or, rather, just put aside for a minute what they’d done and remind himself that this was Malfoy - Draco - one of the very few people who he’d actually been able to just
A boot came down, suddenly, colliding in the face of the one that held him, freeing him, and then the others scattered as the selma approached - gleaming yellow eyes in the dark water - and then he felt a pull on his arm and he swam and swam…
“Well. He was a Death Eater.”
At Regulus, whose amusement danced in his eyes and the quirk of his lips, as he raised an expectant -
“They’re
Harry stared at him.
“You don’t know me. Or what I’ve done.”
Another gasp, a groan, and then the fingers in his hair released their grip, making their way downwards in slow, lazy strokes before grasping the hem and then light touches, a question, that scorched all the same beneath the fabric had Harry arching up, seeking more, his next groan muffled by the mouth returning to his as the fingertips became palms moving across the tight muscles of his stomach.
Harry grinned, widely.
Draco scoffed, shaking his head, looking both amused and exasperated all at once.
He wondered for too long.
“I’d say your wicked scheme has proven a success, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly as he reached him.
Draco turned, hesitating for the briefest of seconds, before lifting his wand and speaking the incantation.
Luna’s eyes brightened, immediately. “Oh. I think that’s mine.”
Harry wasn’t embarrassed at what they’d done.
“Don’t let it get to your head,” Harry said. “Like I told you, I don’t date. Nothing better to compare it to.”
“I haven’t heard that name in a long time. You’d be James Potter’s boy, then. I’d recognise you anywhere.”
“Watch it, Potter,” Malfoy said, as Harry trodded on his toes for the fourth time. “These feet are incredibly valuable, my coach would have you know.”
“Suspected what?” Harry frowned.
His cock stirred, then, at what could not have been a less appropriate moment in history and he quickly looked away, quashing any notion of want that was rising up within him.
Harry smiled a bit, having to tilt his chin to look up at him. “Yeah. Yeah, they all seem pretty convinced. Good show in there, by the way. You’re not a bad date.”
“This way,” Regulus said after a quick look, handing the map back over before turning and heading further into the forest.
He had no regrets. It had
“Is that your not-so-subtle way of fishing for an invitation, Potter?”
“Maybe not,” Regulus conceded. “But I’ve seen enough. And I know where you’ve come from.”
A brief look at the map and Regulus knew where they were headed, leading them through the trees for a few minutes until he came up short at a point where Harry could feel the magic change, twisting and turning with something hazy, almost sinister.
Harry happily kicked them to the floor.
“It folds out,” Draco pointed out, a smile playing on his lips.
was going to be. Endeavours that involved the press printing ludicrous quizzes—‘Are
Harry rubbed his suddenly sweaty palms against the fabric of his trousers and he wondered if he should suggest they head out together.
- with Draco close enough that he could surely feel it, while Harry breathed in his very scent and could feel the same warmth of the memory that had been haunting him all week.
Malfoy took it all in good humour. Still smiling, touching him and sharing glances at all the right moments as he easily fielded the questions. Harry guessed he’d done this all before and found he didn’t really like the thought of that.
“You first, Potter,” Draco said at his side, from where they two and Luna were eyeing their next destination from the cover of the bushes.
Draco’s eyes found Harry’s once more at the statement, lingering a moment.
Harry frowned, asking the question he’d been wondering for a while now. Ever since they’d first come across one another in the Astronomy Tower some months before.
There were others who deserved it more, he was sure of it. Others who deserved the choice to come back. Come back to their loved ones, to their wives and their husbands, their brothers and their sisters, their children.
The crowd roared, Harry along with them, as the Quaffle flew through the hoop, Ginny clocking another ten points to the Holyhead Harpies.
The timepiece on the desk read six fifteen.
“Your adoring public?”
and the boggart was finally banished away.
“Right,” Draco remarked, as they reached their destination.
Harry felt the memories start to come back to him - of Snape, of Dumbledore, of a green light hitting him in the chest and him falling - and he shoved them away, into the box he had labelled
Malfoy grinned and blew him a kiss.
“Perish the thought,” Malfoy said, before taking a long drink of water from the glass he held, and Harry tried and failed not to stare as his throat worked it down. “The press.”
The sound of voices caused Harry to rouse from where he’d fallen asleep on the couch. Pulled out now, so that both he and Draco could sleep upon it together, once they’d eventually - finally - satisfied their need to touch and kiss, but Harry could tell even before he fully came back to himself that he was now lying there alone.
They followed the blue lights, even when the sound of the breaths and the undergrowth being disturbed ceased behind them, the forest growing quiet once more as they moved further through the trees.
The air suddenly felt cold around them and Harry shivered in it, eyes taking in the mist that swirled at his feet, as he stepped forward, closer to where Draco stood, but his limbs felt heavy, sluggish. His mind, too, in the sort of way it feels in the space between dreams and wakefulness.
and Harry had forgotten that, how his eyes could glint, sometimes, and his words could cut.
“I’ve seen you here.”
And, before he could make sense of what was happening, Harry felt that pull in his stomach, against his will, and he fought it but, within a second, he was twisting and lurching, almost painfully, as he was sucked from the room with a gasp.
Harry’s stupid heart jumped at the thought.
“Forget it.”
A roar erupted out of nowhere that reverberated through the room and his
“So this was the plan all along, was it?”
“About the Killing Curse,” Draco’s voice was an echo in the air, surrounding him, the real Draco before him fading away. “No one said you were dead.”
The pictures snapped of them during their unexpected rendezvous in the pub the other night had been splashed all over the newspapers the following morning. Pictures that had included Malfoy’s thumb stroking Harry’s neck and his lips murmuring close to his ear and his eyes sparkling a little with mischief when they looked at one another in the moments immediately following their arrangement.
, he supposed, for it felt a bit ridiculous to think of him so formally in light of recent events.
It was a few days later, when Harry had only just managed to get Malfoy out of his mind, before a bouquet of a dozen red roses arrived on the doorstep of Grimmauld Place, with an accompanying note that brought all those flutters soaring back.
“The Savior and the Scum -”
There was a scar that Harry had put there, another raised line that trailed downwards and his gaze followed, seeing the others, then.
Harry's hands didn’t know where to settle - he wanted
“I got lucky.”
“Might have escaped your notice that the only reason I was ever Master of that thing is because I was attempting to commit murder.
“I thought so. But I’m not really surprised,” Luna said, smilingly. “I’ve actually thought there may be something going on for a while.”
“Hm.”
He was only just sneaking a peek like a right perv when there was a zap of light - smaller than the other two they’d experienced - which made a concentrated suck into the coffee table in front of the couches.
Harry caught sight of sketched images and words that stretched across them, '
Well. That
at least he tried to.
Regulus shook his head.
with how closely they were still pressed together.
Harry swallowed and nodded, taking Malfoy’s arm.
Harry opened his mouth to protest, furiously.
“It’s a dewmander’s bite,” Draco said, behind him. “Easily cured with magic.”
“You never knew what?” Harry repeated, but his own voice sounded as far away as Draco’s had and Draco didn’t answer, just looked at him in bewilderment for a moment before he turned, slightly.
Rather than taking off his shirt - which Harry really had no objection to - Draco unbuttoned the cuff of his right sleeve and pulled it up in carefully folded over rolls up to his elbow, before reaching up and undoing another button on his shirt, so that now it split and opened up all the way down to the beginning of the hair at his chest, parting enough that Harry could see the silvery lines of scar tissue beneath.
Harry scoffed while Malfoy pulled out the chair at his side and plonked down, before dragging it along the floor with a screech so that they were sitting close enough that their thighs were pressed together.
Draco’s amusement seemed to die away then and, for a second, Harry thought he caught a glimpse of exasperation. But it was there and then it was gone, as was Draco, who strode from the room without waiting.
Eyes opened up along the roof of it, hundreds of them -
“Oh?” Malfoy looked more interested than Harry expected. “Huh. I always suspected.”
That should have been easier.
Luna went next, at a much more leisurely pace than Draco’s brisk stride, and when Harry glanced back, Regulus’ eyes were on Draco’s retreating form, brow furrowed.
“I might ask you the same question,” Draco said, eyeing him. “The place is hardly filled with fond memories for you, either.”
Harry was spared from having to respond by a camera flash going off a few feet away, snapping a picture of the two of them together.
They weren’t there for long.
Regulus grinned, though Harry caught the way his eyes lingered for a second on the Mark on Draco's arm before he turned his attention back to the book in his lap. “I have no regrets, little cousin. It’s been twenty years since I’ve had hot running water. I certainly wasn’t rushing.”
It was only then that Harry heard the murmurs from the people crowding the fence, the snap of cameras that had obviously caught everything.
His return to school had made headlines in the Prophet, none of which were untrue but none would be truer than a simple:
At some point, Malfoy’s arm had come up to drape over the back of Harry’s chair, which Harry had been pretending not to notice.
Malfoy made a hum of laughter. “It’s an improvement on the stones, I must admit.”
Water creatures, as many in the lake as upon the land, scattered both out of his way and into him - lobalugs and murtlaps and plimpies and shrakes - knocking him off course and slowing him down.
Harry glanced at him over his shoulder, lips quirking. “Company’s not bad, either.”
Harry heard the snap of another camera. Someone who’d followed them.
Harry frowned when he saw Draco’s eyes darken further at whatever he was seeing, his frown deepening and a hard swallow of his throat.
, as if Draco had it all the time, with whoever, whenever.
The cabin had unlocked once Draco’s wand returned, their magic along with it, but the map remained unchanged, giving them no indication of where to go next.
“See something you like, Potter?”
Harry raised his eyebrows before he tilted his half-empty pint glass in Malfoy’s direction. “Malfoy.”
He didn't really want to know the answer. He didn't think anyone would want to face the person they'd become when faced with a choice like that. Would you kill or let your loved ones be killed?
Malfoy’s smirk widened as he turned his back on the admiring eyes of those in the pub, telling the bartender to open up a tab as he lifted the drink he’d ordered and made his way to where Harry was sitting. “Potter. Fancy meeting you here.”
Bloody tease.
And then came…
Draco eyed him, before his glancing down between them, and his eyes were playful, now, and unguarded when he looked back up at him.
Draco’s eyes lifted from the food he was studying to Harry’s. One of the very few people in the world who Harry had actually told the truth about what had happened in the Forbidden Forest that day.
“I don’t have mine, either.”
“About last night.”
He was an arse
“Wait -” Harry blurted out, sounding as panicked as he felt.
Regulus Black had told them this place was.
There was silence until Harry met Draco’s eyes, which were regarding him carefully and Harry was sure he caught a flash of something - something like hurt - before they went neutral, almost cold, as Draco rose back to his feet.
Harry stared at her in bewilderment, shaking his head. “What the hell just happened?”
from his mind.
Or, rather, make sense of what had happened on Monday and what had happened since and, also, what had just happened, now.
Harry frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Stop that,” Draco scolded him, his voice still rough and Harry felt him swatting at his arm.
It was familiar, Harry realised.
“You made it past the selma, then,” the man remarked, with a smile playing on his lips, crossing his arms as he eyed the two of them. “It’s been a while since anyone’s come through here. I was beginning to wonder if the game had given up.”
Harry sighed, leaning his head back against the couch. “I doubt she even knows, Malfoy.”
the one who lucked out there. I was in the right place at the right time, that’s all.”
” - turning them over, while he pushed the shirt fully from Draco’s shoulders. Harry pressed his lips to the pale skin of Draco’s throat that had been taunting him for hours now. Glad, finally, to be able to do as he’d wanted, before his lips and tongue moved slowly downwards, needing to taste every last inch of Draco's skin, and Harry relished every quiver against his tongue and each whimper he managed to pull from him.
His silver stag was joined by another - a hare, Luna’s - that chased away those that approached from below but Harry stumbled as it did, his foot catching in a loose plank and he hit the bridge on his knees, slipping precariously close to the edge of the narrow walkway - stopped from going over only by Draco’s hand grasping tightly at his arm - and then his wand was falling down into the abyss below.
The scraping of chairs on the wooden floor startled Harry from his thoughts and he felt suddenly cold, realising that the warmth that had been emanating from Malfoy’s closeness had disappeared.
Draco shuddered, suddenly, above him, his eyes squeezing shut, forehead pressing against Harry's as his lips parted in a silent cry.
Draco met his eyes, then.
“Well,” Draco glanced around the cabin, lifting a shoulder. “Where would you go?”
Harry wondered, in a flash, if Draco knew how to cast a patronus charm but it all happened so quickly that, before any of them could lift their wands to even attempt another, the dementor shuddered and morphed and became a mirror image of Draco himself in torn, filthy Azkaban robes, eyes hollow and breaths coming in visible puffs from his lips. Exactly how he’d looked at the trial.
“You know, you’re awfully clueless for being Savior of the World.”
Harry frowned, coming back to himself, confused at having reached Draco so soon.
Harry immediately let go, heat returning and spreading from his neck up to his cheeks.
“I was never stalking you.”
Harry frowned, not quite making sense of what he’d said quickly enough, and by the time Harry realised what Malfoy meant, he was already down the path and gone.
“I did want to.”
Regulus looked at him sharply, his steps slowing to a stop - the rest of them following suit - and a flurry of emotions seemed to pass over the man’s face, before he spoke.
Draco stared back at him, evenly, not letting any discomfort or - more likely - eagerness show.
Harry grinned and reached to undo the buttons. “Seriously?”
Harry grinned, looking at the Veil, releasing a sigh of relief. “Yeah. Looks like it.”
Draco lingered there, close enough that Harry felt his breath stir the hair at the side of his face, only drawing away when Regulus cast a ‘
Luna said something to him, the crease in Draco’s brow unknitting for a second, his lips flickering in a ghost of a smile, before he schooled it and glanced at the thestral closest to him, lifting the apple he held and taking a bite.
Draco blanched as he stared back at it and made no move to raise his wand - frozen in the face of it - and both Luna and Harry moved then.
Harry stared, foolishly, at the spot where she’d been.
Abruptly realising he was supposed to be saying something, he glanced quickly back at who he was actually talking to.
“Maybe not. Either way, they keep the vultures at bay.”
But then Harry had a thought as he glanced at the windows, where reporters and photographers could still be seen milling about, waiting to catch something gossip-worthy for their newspapers, their eyes pointedly on the two of them where they sat. Harry was struck by the realisation that, with the exception of the occasional polite passing by of one another at Quidditch Games and on the street, this was the first time he and Malfoy had actually associated publicly in...well...ever. And it just so happened to be the same week those
Harry could hear the shame in his words. The same that lingered just on the edges of his sharp retorts and his vulnerable glances.
There was a blinding flash of light.
Draco’s grin was slow, as his eyes left the water to meet Harry’s once more, and Harry realised he’d well and truly stuck his foot in it with that one.
“Oh, I have plenty experience in dating, Potter. Which is more than can be said for you, I’ve heard. The Prophet pegs you as quite the hermit.”
He felt Draco’s hand slip between them, taking their slick cocks in his hand and working them, slowly at first as he leaned down to kiss him again, deeply, and then Draco drew back, touching his forehead to Harry’s and just looked at him, as his fist moved in swift steady strokes over the both of them.
Pulled out the chair for Harry when they reached it.
Regulus cleared a row of several consecutive - impossibly thick - spider webs the full height and width of the cave that could only have been created by a creature that would rival Aragog’s size, and Harry noticed Draco’s eyes go wide as saucers as he stared at them.
One of relatively few students who had, Hogwarts Eighth Year boasting a grand total of seventeen students.
Instead, he looked like he was fighting amusement. Amusement at
“I’m surprised you can even tell past the state that thing’s in,” Draco said, shortly, as if Harry were an idiot for using it before he tossed a fresh piece of torn fabric at his chest.
Harry frowned, wondering if that was really what Draco was thinking.
There was a moment where grey eyes stared into green with such intensity that Harry held his breath.
Said thoughts crept back in quickly though.
Draco hesitated, briefly, in his movements, before he went on, speaking with that infuriating air of faux-nonchalance. “What do you think, Potter? Do you think I would?”
“Though apparently that isn’t enough to put the guard up of Savior Harry Potter,” Draco went on. “If recent history is any indication.”
- the composure he’d managed to muster up for this detention almost dissolving in the wake of that smirk and that tiny touch.
Draco’s lips curved in a smile, not looking up from what he was doing.
“Hm. Should be here,” Regulus remarked.
As such, Malfoy just placed a hand on Harry’s arm as the two of them made their way through the lobby where the press were being held—the camera flashes still snap, snap, snapping away as reporters called out questions after them—and walked into the dining area.
“You know, I never quite figured it out.”
Unthinkingly, Harry reached out, fingertips touching one of the scars on his chest, as guilt and shame gripped him tight, all of a sudden.
Luna went up to the second bedroom a little while later.
Hands that weren’t human grasped the front of his torn shirt, pulling him upwards, up and up until he was suspended above the bridge -
Harry turned the parchment that had been pinned to the front of the cabin door over in his hands, looking again for any further elaboration on what they were actually supposed to be looking for.
Harry frowned, glancing in the direction of where their clothing was laid out, and noticed half the arm of one of his shirts had been torn off.
Harry glanced around at the small tree fort that Regulus Black had taken them to.
They heard the door to the cabin slam shut but ignored it, lost in one another until they heard Regulus’ voice on his approach. “Alright, the map has spoken. We’re on our way -”
Harry caught it, throwing the old one away. “Thanks.”
He was millimetres away when Granger’s voice sounded, urgently; “Harry!”
They followed, a silence falling over the four of them - Harry lost in thoughts about what he’d just seen and
“You’re really not going to come with us?” Draco’s voice said, quietly, a few feet away.
“It’s a celebration of the League, Malfoy. Not your
“Don’t thank me. It’s your shirt.”
Harry shot him a look.
He could only imagine the damage the thing could do set loose in there and, sure enough, a loud thud sounded on the other side of the door, making him quicken his pace to the cupboard.
play on his lips at the gesture.
“Courted,” Harry repeated, frowning. And then he burst into laughter.
“Then you can go as the
Malfoy lifted two glasses from a floating tray, handing one over to Harry.
“Why did I get the choice?”
fit. The apparent shyness only amplified that, tenfold. In fact, Malfoy was exactly the sort of man that would draw Harry’s attention in the muggle clubs and bars he’d been joking about. Exactly the sort of person Harry would normally avoid the press to attempt a date, which felt a tad ironic.
Regulus raised an eyebrow, crossing his arms as he took in the state of them.
Draco raised his eyebrows at the challenge but said nothing else, just glanced around the cabin, making no move to get up to go and shove Regulus out of bed.
Draco tried with evident effort not to match his grin, instead lifting up the sandwich to take a bite and shrugged. “Hm. Far be it for me to disappoint you, Potter.”
Harry met his look evenly, the memory of Monday night coming back to him
“Harry, you’re bleeding, did you know?” Luna said, her normally dreamy voice sharp with concern.
But Harry didn’t think he was overdramatic. After all, it
The place thrummed with magic.
“I think the fact that the worst memories you could have been plagued with upon entering the
Those still in the cave waited.
Harry cast his own, sending his silver stag - brighter than before - at those ahead as he hurried back up the bridge.
and found himself facing a silvery glowing creature with sharp teeth bared and eyes shining white in the darkness.
Harry frowned. “But if you rolled and started the game...how did we -”
Ignored the lure of the Hinkypunk that appeared some time later, opting for the alternate route to what they had chosen.
and the dementor was chased off to the side by his silver stag, speeding in the direction of where Draco and Luna were still at the desk.
Malfoy was going to kiss him. Harry’s brain registered it, just in time for him to say quietly; “Malfoy.”
Why was being able to sail a boat - or, rather, a bunch of logs - hot?
A boggart.
“We play.”
when they reached him, at a point where the magic of the forest changed, becoming softer, and opened out into a small clearing.
A tiny few from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, respectively, and five from Gryffindor.
“My mistake,” Malfoy said, smoothly. “I forget we lowly mortals are not quite up to Chosen One standards—”
And then he lifted his hand, slowly - unnecessarily - licking the non-existent crumbs from his fingers with his eyes still on Harry’s.
Harry felt Draco tense at his side, the words effectively snuffing out his amusement.
Which, of course, he did.
“This would really be more convincing if you’d cut the naff commentary,” Harry said, taking Malfoy’s hand.
“Why do you go there? The Tower?”
Harry reached into his sleeve, his pockets, his robes.
Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes.
Harry frowned at the words, eyes going to Draco where he now stood some feet away, glowering at the map he had plucked up from the ground with such frostiness it was a wonder it hadn’t turned to ice in his hands.
Harry drew in a breath, glancing at the completely unchanged room, as if they’d never left - the wooden box of the game lying in front of them - before he looked back at Luna and then Draco.
Harry ignored - tried to - the bite in his tone.
“I suppose your acknowledgement of said brilliance will just have to do. A hefty endorsement coming from—”
Harry glanced down at his hand as he lowered it from his head, seeing blood - a lot of it - and when he looked up he saw Draco watching him, with a look of apprehension that he quickly schooled into mild concern.
“Can’t say I’ve ever tried to find that out,” Regulus said, and Harry didn’t doubt that it was true, from the relaxed way that he carried himself. “I’ve long since accepted that this is where I am to grow old. I hear this is actually a dream of some, to live out their retirement in some exotic location such as this. I find it rather pleasant, if I’m being honest with you.”
“You’ve wondered, huh?” Harry felt himself grinning, despite himself. “How’s it feel, then? Won’t be able to answer unless you say.”
She leaned over from where she’d been sitting on the couch next to Regulus, lifting the wand and looking at it, carefully.
A shudder and a morph and it was a dementor once more before Luna’s patronus formed and chased it back into the cupboard.
to. That was all. And Malfoy knew it too, his lips curving into a smile against Harry’s, a little hum of laughter escaping him.
until the grinding of their erections against one another through the fabric of their trousers was no longer enough.
It took a moment for him to make sense of his surroundings.
Draco caught that mischievous little smile of his - that always preceded teasing - but, rather than outright teasing, he found himself almost choking on the bite of the pastry he’d just lifted, at the feel of Harry toes - his bare toes - sliding slowly up the inside of his thigh.
“You’re the Gryffindor,” Draco pointed out, and Harry rolled his eyes. “Not to mention the fact that you’ve bested dragons before, if I’ve heard it right? I seem to recall a story trickle down the rumour mill about your great escape from Gringotts.”
Draco reached up, tugging at the top of his robes, loosening them and then flicked at the top button of his shirt underneath, making it spring open and exposing a stretch of milky skin at his throat that glistened with sweat from the heat.
get one over on him, and he’d certainly be getting his revenge for this if Harry dared to leave him with a raging hard on at the breakfast table.
A selma.
Eyes betraying him again, he saw Draco wave off Zabini’s attempt to drag him along, leaving just a handful of Eighth Years behind, and only them two at this side of the room.
“Well. You should.” He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes when he went on, the task at hand apparently far too interesting. “Last year I might’ve stayed. I’m trying to do things differently, now.”
“You can feel them,” Regulus said, quietly, as he leaned in closer. “Hear them. Whispering.”
at the way Draco’s eyes sparkled with mischief.
Four quests and magic for only one of them.
Luna reassured them - looking down at them.
“Circe. The press would go nuts.”
He hadn’t said anything since they’d set off but he didn’t hold himself in quite the same way as he had done at Hogwarts these past few months. Instead, he seemed totally at ease, relaxed in a manner that was familiar but distantly so. And Harry realised he hadn’t seen Draco look like that in a long time. As if he weren’t being hunted or haunted.
“I imagine the point of the game is not to find out, don’t you think?” Draco said, quirking an eyebrow.
foolish, Harry Potter.”
Harry lifted his chin.
Harry fought back another huff of laughter, as he glanced again at the cover of the Witch Weekly magazine that lay abandoned on the bar a few feet along from where Harry was sitting, which sported a moving image of Malfoy blowing him that kiss at the Quidditch Finals a few days before.
Draco’s eyes met his.
“Ah. Well -”
“I really hate this game.”
Harry drew in a breath when Draco’s eyes lingered, acutely aware of their proximity, their near-nakedness and the fact that Draco smelled extremely, unbelievably
He turned on the spot, eyes darting around, trying to take everything in.
“You really believe that, don’t you?”
“Looks like it worked,” Draco said, before he accioed the die without getting up from his stool and rolled a two - for lives - which made the parchment glow once, twice and then fade.
, in fact, as Draco said.
A bright glow in the middle of the desk made Harry flinch, as the wooden box morphed before them, shimmering and stretching and unfolding into a large parchment - a map - and ink lines began to swirl across, slowly forming into locations, one at a time.
Draco walked into the woods without waiting.
Draco blinked.
And then he laughed.
Harry saw Luna a few feet behind Draco, turning on the spot and smiling as she attempted to touch some wood nymphs that appeared to have taken an interest in her, flying in a slow, lazy circuit around where she stood.
“He set a trap. Sirius got caught up in it.”
Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off Malfoy. Or
Draco eyed him, as they carried on walking.
Except, of course, it wasn’t.
And he’d given a none-too-subtle look at Harry at that, which made staying put and waiting a little longer sound not-too-terrible.
Regulus stopped, his back to him, lingering there a few seconds before he looked over his shoulder at him, with that wry smile that looked so much like Sirius’. “Hm.”
thing to Draco - that
Regulus broke off when he stepped around the corner, finding them there - still standing close even if they had reluctantly parted their lips and drawn back a bit - and he chuckled, shaking his head. “Don’t you two ever give it a rest?”
Though Harry - all of them - couldn’t miss the paleness of his features, now, even in the darkness of the cave, lit only by the lumos of their wands in front of them.
When Harry didn’t say anything, Draco crossed his arms, and his jaw twitched in a clench before he went on, eyes guarded.
This look now, though, was something new and while Harry had no idea what, exactly, Draco meant by it, he
he was. And then he’d closed his eyes at night in Grimmauld Place and seen their faces and all the others - the ghosts of those who’d been left behind - and the numbness had faded away for a bit and he’d been overcome with what he wasn't sure was guilt or grief, only knowing that he could hardly breathe for it.
, before Regulus faced the front once more.
“Do what?”
“I’m not testing the waters, I know how it goes.” Harry rolled his eyes, nearly smiling. “So, yeah. I don’t date.”
back to dorms and locked himself in the bathroom, so that he could urgently finish himself off.
a big deal, at least to Harry.
Even if it wasn’t
Luna lifted the die, ready to roll, but before she could a scratching of claws on the floorboards beneath them drew their attention to their feet.
His patronus illuminated the cave as it swept away and he could see others - dozens of them - dementors descending and rising from above and below, so many that Harry was instantly thrown back to the war.
“Even if I hadn’t found the game,” Regulus went on, oblivious to the meaning of the glance shared between them, “Kreacher could have gotten me out.”
Harry glanced down at it, before he raised an eyebrow and unrolled it to look at it himself.
“It’s a nice place.”
know that he was enjoying himself immensely.
When the hell had he started fancying
“Good game.”
“You’ll slow us down with your feet in the water, Lovegood,” Draco sniped, eyeing her from where he stood a little bit off to Harry’s right.
, anyway?
Harry was startled, then, at how much he hated just the thought of that.
It was intoxicating, being surrounded by the scent, the taste of him, and Harry hummed against his cock, drawing an -
And then Harry felt a warm hand on his shoulder, Malfoy’s thumb making a slow, distracting stroke against the side of his neck. It was horribly unnerving, having Malfoy’s hand on him, and Harry froze, uncertain whether he ought to shrug him off, but before he could do anything Malfoy leaned in close, his lips almost brushing Harry’s ear as he spoke.
"I mean you were saving people, Potter. And I - as you well know - wasn't."
“Yeah. Voldemort -”
were of you getting caught with your cock out is rather telling, you know," he said, after a moment, his eyes playful. "We
Harry drew up, letting his cock slip from his lips. “What?”
Draco’s.
A criss cross of raised, silver scars across the soft flesh of chest and stomach that he’d given him. He’d been unable to see them, properly, in the moonlight when he’d pushed the robes and the shirt from his shoulders in the Astronomy Tower, trailing his lips and tongue unknowingly across them as he eagerly chased the soft gasps and sighs of his pleasure.
He hastily hurried up his footsteps, the others behind him hot on his heels, as the dementors swooped up in glides, above and below and on either side of them.
“Obvious, isn’t it? What does it look like I’m doing?”
“The same as you, isn’t it?”
Eighth Years stayed up long into the night in their newly established Common Room, drowning themselves in firewhiskey and party games and rowdy jokes and laughter.
There were others – a phoenix could be seen rising and flying off in the distance, merpeople lounged on rocks along the shore of a lake, a group of centaurs ran across the meadow, from one treeline to the next – and Harry could do nothing but stare in wonder.
"Any change in the map?" Regulus asked, and Harry handed it over without even checking, his mind still all caught up in what had just happened.
“Well -” Regulus’ smile turned wry and so much like Sirius’ that it hurt. “I am
about them when it comes to these things.”
him closer - and Draco did as he asked, pressing into him, so that Harry was pinned tight between the rough bark of the tree behind him and the hot, hard heat of him as they ground against one another, Draco’s mouth achingly slow, taking him apart from the inside out.
She got to her feet, heading towards what she’d seen and Harry noticed she was approaching a kneazle, that was sitting primly just on the outskirts of the forest, engaging in a very thorough clean of its face.
Draco grabbed him by the hair and hauled him up, kissing him roughly, before he yanked his trousers and boxers down over his hips.
Draco shot him a look. “Try to convince yourself that I was ever on your side or that you’re not an idiot for thinking you can ‘save me’ from my terrible fate.”
The question hung between them, going unanswered.
Harry blew on the back of Draco’s neck - because he
Just a little bit of meaningless sex to start it off.
Harry looked at him curiously. “You’re looking for me?”
But, for him and Draco, an exception had been made and Harry was pretty sure the reason was due to the fact that it had been Professor McGonagall who'd caught them on the other side of the rules rather than anyone else, considering the other professors didn’t seem to have much idea of how they ought to be treating Harry, ever since he’d unexpectedly returned to Hogwarts that year.
“What did you see?” Harry finally asked.
“Well. All you need to do, Malfoy, is find a single
“Potter,” Draco drawled, eyeing the fabric over their heads, before his gaze went to a couple of students that passed them, seeming none-the-wiser to their presence. “I always knew you liked to use this thing to stalk me.”
that he’d been giving Harry all week.
“It was lovely to have met you, Harry.”
, though, Harry’s answer was more certain. '
Draco fought a smile of his own, his eyes still ahead, but when Luna stepped by them, walking closer to where Regulus was several paces in front of them, he leaned in close enough that his lips touched the shell of Harry’s ear, his breath warm and tickling his neck when he said; “Exhilarating.”
Other times, he’d spent with those who had been spared.
“A thing?” Ron’s brow knitted for a second, before his look became understanding. “Oh. Is this another of those...y’know...
Which was really what they ought to expect, considering the look Regulus had gotten when he’d recognised the quest they’d evoked.
“Apparently, the first quest is the lake.”
“I did tell you boys this place is
Draco turned. “You obviously haven’t given me what I need.”
Harry only smiled and Draco’s gaze turned playful at the response.
There was a sudden flash of brightness, that swelled and surrounded them, blinding and making them flinch, before it zapped away in a concentrated suck into the ground, leaving behind the map which must have been lost in the scramble.
“Well...um...full of surprises, I suppose,” Harry eventually said, settling on vague, and he couldn’t help but lift his gaze from the parchment he was folding to where he knew Draco was standing, finding those grey eyes upon him, with that frustratingly unreadable
Harry smiled, emboldened by that, meeting his eyes.
Harry had been gazing—a bit dazed and daft, he supposed, after that hour spent in his arms on the dancefloor—at where Malfoy was now standing across the other side of the room, engaged in easy conversation with those who surrounded him when Ginny’s voice spoke at Harry’s side.
once?” Harry snapped, his hands moving in a helpless manner above her, clueless at what he needed to do.
There was a huff of a scoff that made Harry grin but his amusement was quickly snuffed out a second later at the sound of a thud, drawing his attention to where they had just come from, his eyes finding Luna lying, unconscious, in the grass.
Harry suddenly wished that he and Draco were alone so that, maybe, Draco might say something about what had just occurred - even if he knew that was highly unlikely - but Draco turned away, abruptly, affirming Harry's reservations, taking a seat once more at the desk.
“I don’t think feeding each other on the first date is common practice, no.”
absolutely, totally
“Not all of us. My mother’s told me about you. She speaks fondly of you. Things have been different. Since the war. Since my fa...She and her sister have reconciled. Her sister - Aunt Andromeda - she has a grandson. Teddy. You’d still have family. If you wanted them.”
Malfoy was looking at him carefully, long enough that Harry felt himself blush under the scrutiny, feeling that warmth creep up his neck again, the way it seemed to do so often when Harry was under Malfoy’s gaze. He swallowed—which was a bit harder to do than Harry was expecting—and was just about to open his mouth to say something, when Malfoy stepped in closer, crowding Harry’s space where he was still leaning back against the wall.
“You’re playing a dangerous game, Potter,” Draco finally said, though he didn’t pull away.
“Think it’s too soon to boot Black out of that bed?”
“My mother is under the impression that you perished years ago.”
Potter. This place is boiling.”
“I didn’t tell anyone.”
He put his hands on her wrists, her face, feeling her growing colder and her breaths coming shallow. A raised reddened mark, like a bite, on her hand became darker, swelling with each second, purple lines spreading in a slow, steady crawl up her arm.
He said it in such a way that it would be ridiculous for him to be waiting for anyone other than Harry.
“In that case you can rest easy,” Draco said, cooly, eyeing his back. “He’s dead.”
He cleared his throat, straightening up, and he drew his knees closer to his chest. “Sorry.”
,” Draco repeated, and Harry could hear the laughter in his voice. “I never knew the Great Saviour of the Wizarding World could be so easily had. A little bit of wind and water is all it takes, is it? How’m I doing, then, Potter?”
Sirius than the godfather that Harry had known - even if he could recognise who he was, immediately - but his eyes were cruel, menacing even, as they stared Regulus down.
was easier said than done - and peered at it. “How’d this get in here?”
No truer words were ever spoken, at least in Harry’s case.
“Wha -” Harry grabbed him by the arm, so that he had to stop, and pulled him to face him. “Neither of you said it was going to throw us into some
“Well,” Draco’s voice sounded, suddenly, to his right. “Shall we get on with it, then?”
He was just James Potter’s boy. He was just Draco Malfoy’s friend. He was just Harry Potter.
Malfoy, of course, heard him, his head turning sharply in Harry’s direction. “Well, well. Do my eyes deceive me?”
And then, suddenly, Sirius was standing there up ahead, shocking Harry into stillness, while Draco ran into him from behind.
Malfoy’s celebratory smile changed a bit then, holding Harry’s gaze. He raised an eyebrow before giving Harry a mock salute.
