“Why does everyone keep saying that?” Draco grumbled, more annoyed that she was right.  Pansy had tried to force him into discussing Harry every time he saw her after the apology mission.  It was why he’d come here today instead.
The Zabini Mansion was similar to Malfoy Manor in its grandeur — though this Mansion was a much more recent development — except for the fact that the Zabinis rarely used their home for anything other than posh soirées.  Socialites from all over the U.K. and sometimes further were constantly at the Mansion; Draco couldn’t fathom how Blaise or his mother ever got any rest.  The Zabinis entertained guests as often as most people ate meals.  It was exhausting to even think about.
“I’ll see myself out then, shall I?” Draco offered, standing.  He felt vastly relieved he wouldn’t have to choke down the rest of Pansy’s tea.
Draco sighed.  Pansy hadn’t told him they were coming after all.  The cheat.  “Hello, Blaise,” Draco greeted, already affecting the air of haughtiness that a guest of the Zabinis ought to have.  “Apologies for the intrusion.  Mr. Potter here has something very important to tell you, but I’m sure he’d prefer less of an audience.”
“Dray, what a treat!” she hollered, in case anyone missed his entrance.  “What brings you here today, darling?”
Across from him, Hermione was sharing an incredulous look with Ron, who shrugged in bewilderment.  Parkinson crossed her arms, still paying the other two no mind.
“Go on, Draco,” Dr. Finch told him with a surreptitious wink, voice pitched low enough that Connor wouldn’t hear.  “I won’t tell the other one.”
“I’m not sure if that went well or not, honestly,” Harry interrupted as they strode down the street.
Despite the clench of dread in his chest, Harry shook his head ardently.  “That’s ridiculous,” he ground out.
A wizard?  To see Harry?  It must be Ron!  Somehow, he’d gotten permission to retrieve Harry, or he’d come without permission like that summer before second year — either way, Harry was going to the Burrow!
Daphne laughed lightly, voice like a clear bell, and the movement caused her sleek blonde hair to ripple around her face.  Draco was starting to feel very irked by the way Harry was staring at her, even though he knew Daphne was using charms to enthrall him.
He wanted to obey that voice.  He wanted to do whatever it asked.  “Not without you,” he said, catching Malfoy’s wrist in his hand.  “Draco.”
He glanced at the clock again – fifteen minutes left. He sighed, and tried to return to the task at hand.
Harry shook his head slightly, trying to deduce Draco’s motives.  He must have some other reason for wanting to help Harry.  Right?
“I was forced to take it,” Malfoy murmured, voice so quiet Harry could barely hear it.  “I didn’t want to.”
?” Draco demanded with a suspicious frown.  Surely Potter could use his auror status to find out where Greg lived.  In fact, he could probably find out where Draco lived as well.  The thought made Draco nervous.  There were plenty of people who still wanted Draco dead for his part in the war, and if Potter could find him out then it wouldn’t be hard for others to do the same.
Parkinson snorted.  “I was a lousy friend,” she told him casually.  “I threw a fit whenever Draco wouldn’t snog me.  I thought I was in love with him, you see,” she admitted, looking more smug than embarrassed.  “But that was when I was still convinced we were both straight.”
Suddenly, finally, the clock struck noon and Harry was up out of his seat ready to apparate to the Dragon’s Lair, abandoning his reports on his desk. Kingsley wouldn’t be pleased but Harry couldn’t be bothered.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, hating the way that last name felt in his mouth, but knowing Draco would respond better to it right now.  “I only meant….  I didn’t know very much, about Dumbledore.  I… only wish he’d told me more about himself.  I felt like I knew him, but I know I didn’t.  I don’t like… finding out things about him that don’t line up with what I knew.  It’s just, a sore spot for me, I guess.  I didn’t mean to take it out on you.”  Harry swallowed, realizing he’d looked down at his feet during his confession, and quickly darted his eyes back up to make sure Draco hadn’t left.
“And you’ve barely touched your food,” Ron added, far more concerned with Harry’s appetite.  Ron’s fingers twitched toward his fork, and it took an obvious effort to hold himself back.
Hermione blushed, as she always did when someone had charmed her.  Even Ron looked impressed as he watched Parkinson leave.  “I like her,” Hermione declared, facing them again.
Just then however, a memo flew into his face, and, after a moment of spluttering, Harry managed to grab and open it.
“Well, it’ll take even less time if they just find both of us standing here,” Harry countered, making a show a plopping down on the bottom step of the stairs.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s behaviour.  “Daphne, it’s a pleasure as always,” Draco said, forcing Daphne to return her gaze to him.  It was uncomfortable to have her look at him like that, with those hungry eyes, but it was better him than Potter.  “I must apologize for my companion, he’s quite dense when it comes to the obvious.”
The internal battle raging inside Ron finally came to an end.  His hand was around his fork before he even said, “See, he’s fine” to Hermione, and shoveling another bite of pie into his mouth.
Sorry, not the ships you signed up for - don't worry, it's still drarry!  Next chapter is all drarry ;)
Maybe he shouldn’t have teased Malfoy so much.  The smiling had gotten on Malfoy’s nerves and that must’ve gotten them off to a poor start.  Merlin, what an idiot he’d been.  No wonder Malfoy had been upset with him.  Next time, Harry would be somber, and take everything Malfoy said very seriously.  That way Malfoy wouldn’t feel like Harry was making fun of him.  He just had to wait until Malfoy cooled off.  That exchange had been eight days ago.  Was it too soon to confront him again?  He looked well, every time Harry spotted him striding down the street like he owned it, and chatting with Dr. Finch over tea.  Sometimes hot chocolate when it was a particularly miserable day out.
“Sod off, Flints,” Draco’s voice snarled from beside him, and for the second time that day, Harry felt Draco tug on his arm, silently prompting him to go.  This time he obeyed, and Draco disapparated them back to England, into the alley by The Dragon’s Lair.  Harry didn’t even bother to berate him about his lawbreaking this time.  It wouldn’t help.
Daphne pouted her lips at him.  “But Draco,” she protested, somehow dignified and petulant at the same time, “my sister has been waiting for you to stop by.  She’s quite taken with you.”
She looked him over appraisingly, like she was trying to see if he was up to something.  It reminded him of Professor McGonagall.  Finally, the woman offered her hand with a warm smile.  Draco took it gratefully.  “You may call me Dr. Finch.”
The fear that flashed across his uncle’s face was priceless, his eyes twitching and mouth trembling like a buffoon.  Even if it made something in Harry’s gut twist to semi-threaten muggles with magic, he knew it was the only way to keep his uncle from treating him too poorly.
“Ah,” said the old woman, “an excellent query.  You’re familiar with the phrase ‘Here be dragons’?”  She looked at him expectantly.
Draco gave him a sidelong glance, but otherwise didn’t react.  Harry began worrying his lip.  It somehow felt like he had limited time to get Draco to say something, or to smile, or laugh, or bloody well react to something.  There were more Slytherins, this wasn’t the last time he’d see Draco.  So why did it feel like an end?
“Thanks,” Harry said, but then there was just silence, as neither of them seemed to have anything to say.  “It’s rather dark here,” Harry tried, gesturing to the many closed shops and dim alleyways.
“He has?” Harry asked, forgetting about the unfairness of these accusations for the moment.  “Is he alright?”  The Draco Malfoy from sixth year flashed before Harry’s eyes, with sallow skin and sunken cheeks, killing himself to complete an impossible task.  It made Harry’s insides churn to think he might ever look that way again.
Harry was dumbstruck.  Malfoy was a Death Eater.  All these years, Harry was right about him; he was a villain.  But Malfoy was here, now, on the doorstep of his muggle aunt’s house, warning him that Voldemort was coming.  And when Voldemort found out, he would kill him.
Harry’s fists clenched of their own volition.  Anger was rising up in him like it had all fifth year.  “Like hell you can’t,” he growled.  “We go together or not at all.”
Harry felt himself starting to get worked up again.  “That’s not true,” he bit back.  “Muggles aren’t less – ”
“Isn’t it?” Hermione challenged.  “Harry, you were fixated on him all through school.  Half the time you were off stalking him!”
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Connor take a long sip of his beer.  He must be regretting this conversation.  Before Draco could change the subject however, he put his drink down and turned to face Draco more fully.  “Do you want to make out and forget about him for a bit?” Connor asked bluntly.
“What is it?” Harry yelled, starting to rise grudgingly from his seat.  He could hear his uncle’s furious huff from here.
Draco entered the shop and froze, the door swinging closed behind him.  There was a moment where Draco thought they hadn’t noticed him, and he could sneak out again without anyone the wiser.  But then Dr. Finch glanced over at him and smiled, and Harry Potter turned towards him with a carefree grin on his idiotic face.
“It’s good to see you, Lavender,” Draco said politely, absentmindedly taking a sip of his tea and frowning at the sweetness of it.
— gave Draco a pleading look with his über green eyes, which Draco promptly turned his back on and headed off to find Greg.  The storeroom was just behind the bar through an open doorway, and Draco only had to walk past a couple aisles of stacked crates of different types of whiskey and butterbeer before he spotted his loyal friend.  Greg was facing the other way and bent over, shirt riding up as he sifted through one of the crates, giving Draco an unobstructed view of an area of Greg that Draco never wanted an unobstructed view of.
Dr. Finch glanced up at him in amusement, but made no comment at the quote from his favorite muggle play.
There was a beat of silence as Harry took this in.  He’d never seen Malfoy this earnest.  “Why should I trust you?” he asked quietly.  Something about Malfoy’s demeanor made Harry already trust him, but he wanted to hear Malfoy’s answer all the same.
“What a gentleman you are, Potter,” Draco found himself saying.  Harry’s responding laugh made Draco’s pulse double its tempo, and his palms became instantly sweaty.
It was a pleasantly surprising turn of events.  At most he had expected Goyle to shrug him off.  Harry started to smile in response, and Goyle rushed to add, “I’m not though,” as if this was a point of pride for him, and for a moment Goyle reminded Harry of Ron.
Draco gave Harry a stern look.  “You are rather prone to stalking,” he intoned, but Potter just rolled his eyes.
“Not you,” Parkinson snapped, and Harry turned to see her closing the door on Draco’s offended face.  “You’re not nearly as nice.”
“Yes,” Harry assured, grasping onto that thread of hope.  “Now tell me,” he added with a hint of playfulness.  “Who
On the third floor, they exited into a much brighter hallway, and Harry followed Draco to a door labeled 309.  With a last exasperated look at Harry, Draco rapped his knuckles twice against the wood.  “Pansy, I’m sorry,” he called through the door in way of greeting, “but I’ve got a terribly stubborn Gryffindor here and he won’t leave until he speaks with you.”
“And besides,” Hermione went on, “it’s not up to us who Harry likes.  He’s doesn’t even realize it yet himself.”
Draco seemed to realize at the same time as him that they were still holding hands, and there was a moment where they just stared at their joined hands, before hastily pulling apart.  Harry couldn’t quite figure out why his hand felt so pleasantly tingly.  Or why his chest felt so full of warmth.
Draco rolled his eyes and turned to give a pleading look to Dr. Finch, a look that said “Please make him leave.”
Several witches at a nearby table glanced over with shocked expressions and then burst into giggles.  Harry blushed terribly, and lowered his voice to a strained whisper.  “What on earth made you think that?”
Now Draco knew he was being made fun of.  Sighing dramatically, Draco turned and stalked down the street, with Potter following on his heels.  He didn’t slow until they got to the park he had just been in, even though he kept wanting to check that Potter was still there and that he hadn’t gotten discouraged and stayed behind at the shops.
Ros gave him an unimpressed look even though Draco hadn’t technically lied.  “No,” she agreed, “not everything.  But this is.”
Lavender laughed like her girlfriend had told a hilarious joke.  “You’d better be off, Harry,” she said merrily.  “Pans doesn’t take well to guests who outstay their welcome.”
McGonagall tilted her head curiously. “Yes. Potter, this Unity event was created to celebrate all the houses; the Slytherins may not be known for fighting on the day of the Hogwarts Battle, but they should be celebrated for the battles they did fight.” She paused, as if waiting for Harry to interrupt, but he stayed silent, waiting for her to continue. “Ms. Runcorn had a childhood friend, a halfblood, that was sorted into Hufflepuff. They grew apart at school, as many in different houses do, but when Mr. Runcorn imprisoned her friend’s mother, Edwina felt directly responsible. It was one of the first arrests Runcorn made, since he already knew her muggleborn status. Edwina would visit her father at work and sneak looks at his list of suspected muggleborns, then report these lists to me. It was a risky business. She may have been locked up during the Battle, but she saved many lives.”
“Draco?” Dr. Finch called out moments later, a sing-song quality to her voice that meant it wasn’t just anyone at the door.  Draco’s heart leapt to his throat.  “I think this young man would like a word with you.”
Harry seemed instantly taken with her, and immediately did as she asked, stepping inside.  Daphne’s eyes trailed after him for a moment too long, and Draco clenched his teeth as he too entered.  There was nothing to get worked up over, Daphne was just up to her usual tricks.
“Hoping to speak with Albus, I take it,” Snape guessed before Harry could come up with anything decent.
Footsteps picked up behind him, and before he knew it, a breathless Harry was blocking his path.  “Malfoy,” he gasped, “Draco.  I’m
After a moment of scrutinizing him, Petunia gave a curt nod.  Grabbing her purse on her way into the living room, she called out, “Vernon, I’m going to the sports store.  There’s a limited-time sale on those golf clubs you were interested in.  You’ll need to show me which ones you want.”
“So…” Potter ventured in clear bewilderment, “You just forgave him?  Just like that?  You’re not mad?”
“That went well, I think,” Harry said, mainly to see the incredulous look that was forming on Draco’s face in response.
Harry opened his mouth, intending to introduce the two parties, but Parkinson was already berating him.
The Headmistress was looking over some papers behind her desk (much more productively than Harry had been just minutes ago) and didn’t even glance up when he came in
Draco returned his attention to the book he was reading.  It was a fascinating read about shamans in different parts of Asia, and Draco wondered if anyone knew they were just wizards.  How many witches and wizards shared their gifts with muggles and lived among them without contact with the wizarding world?  Were they all like Draco, running away from the horrors of their pasts?  Or did they simply prefer the company of muggles?  Before the war, Draco would have scoffed at the possibility of preferring muggle company, but now he could understand the appeal.  They were just people after all, just like witches and wizards but without magic.  They were prejudiced about different things in its stead, like skin color and gender and sexuality, but at least they didn’t have insane nearly-immortal tyrants rise up every fifty years to try to take over the world.
boy here to see you,” Vernon growled out, emphasizing ‘strange’ in the way he did to avoid the word ‘magic’ or ‘wizard’.  The Dursleys seemed to think not acknowledging the wizarding world would make it go away, though Harry thought their lives would be less stressful if they just accepted it.
“Alright,” Hermione said, and Harry glanced up to see that she and Ron were both giving him meaningful looks from across the table.  Ron had even set down his fork, so it had to be serious, although he was still chewing his previous bite of pork pie.  “What is going on with you, Harry?” Hermione went on gently.  “You’ve been spacing out the whole meal.”
This evening was no exception.  When Draco stumbled from the Zabini fireplace — right into Potter who hadn’t bothered to make space for him, forcing Draco to steady himself by clutching onto Harry’s shoulders — the smooth notes of a muggle jazz band (muggle music was
“Oh,” Harry hastened to say, “I just wanted to let you know that – well, I wanted to apologize to you.”
“Not a friend,” Draco grumbled, but introduced them anyway.  “Potter, this is Dr. Finch, the owner of this wonderful bookstore and the smartest person I’ve ever met.  Dr. Finch, this is Harry Potter, a massive git who likes to wear baggy dresses.”
Draco tried to scowl back, but it came out as a smile.  This was turning out to be a pretty amusing use of his time.  “Then where to next?”
Harry frowned, rage beginning to curdle in his stomach.  “And I suppose you purebloods are above all that, then?” he retorted.  “I suppose you think Dumbledore was a supremacist too?”
Draco frowned at him, trying to pretend he hadn’t just been imagining Harry drenched in butterbeer.  Mill was an odd choice.  It wasn’t like Potter had ever really interacted with her.  What was he going to apologize for?  As ridiculous as Potter’s decision was, Draco stood to imply he was ready to go.  He left his butterbeer on the counter, not wanting the rest, and Harry looked sadly at his own barely touched butterbeer before sighing and standing as well.
“Are you mad?” Draco exploded.  “Potter, I don’t think we’ve ever had a one-on-one conversation — excluding brief exchanges during fights — before you popped up last month.”
Draco pivoted on his heel to face the clueless auror again, and Potter had to pull up short so that he wouldn’t run into him.  “What?” the blonde demanded.
Harry’s face fell, and Draco’s heart lurched seeing such a heartbroken expression on his face.  “Why not?” Harry asked plaintively, reminding Draco strongly of a wet kitten.  It was a testament to Draco’s strength of will that he didn’t reach over and pull the other man into a hug right then.
Greg gave Draco one of his big sloppy grins that reminded Draco of a Labrador Retriever, and launched himself over to crush Draco in one of his signature hugs.  They hadn’t ever hugged in their school days, but once the war had ended, Greg had gotten particularly fond of touch.  Draco wasn’t complaining; Greg’s hugs were the most comforting he’d ever experienced — not that he had much to compare to.  “It’s not a bother,” Greg said in his gruff voice.
“Draco,” Pansy called, stalling Lavender with a hand on her shoulder.  “Just so you know, I wouldn’t mind if you changed how you felt about Potter.  He’s not that bad.”
Harry sighed.  “Maybe you’re right.  They don’t want to see me.  I’m not fixing anything like this.”
“Reading,” he settled on, remembering the muggle bookstore that Draco spent so much of his time in.  “Learning about the muggle world.”
Daphne laughed that tinkling laugh again, ambling over and placing her free hand on Harry’s arm.  Her fingers were so delicate, resting just above his elbow; Draco could almost feel the uptick in Harry’s heartbeat.  For the briefest of moments, Draco imagined
Draco’s lips pursed in annoyance.  For a dreadful moment, Harry thought he was going to reject the idea, but finally the blonde nodded resignedly and set off down the street, making Harry jog to catch up.
“Oh, I did,” Dr. Finch assured him, blinking back into the present.  “Surprised her in Florida.  We lived together for two years.  The happiest years of my life.”  Dr. Finch’s face suddenly darkened, like the lights had all dimmed at once.  “But she was killed.”
“Her father worked at the ministry. He was promoted during Pius Thicknesse’s reign. His job was to sniff out muggleborns and halfbloods.”
Snape was completely unreadable. And silent. Harry bit his tongue to stop from rambling any further. Finally, Snape opened his mouth. “Yes, I know you do, Potter, I’m not an idiot.”
“I wasn’t very nice to you or your friends in school, and I underestimated you.”  Potter pushed his glasses back up his nose, even though they hadn’t fallen in the first place.  “I was hoping to make things right with you.”
“Which is why, Potter,” Parkinson went on, looking thoroughly unimpressed with his lack of a poker face, “I have to ask: what are your intentions with my dear Draco?”
Draco rolled his eyes.  “No — well, yes — well….”  He hesitated, glancing over at the earnest expression on Connor’s face.  It wasn’t like Connor could tell anyone.  With a sigh, Draco went on, “I was in a type of… gang, a few years ago.  Got in with the wrong sort.  I was… terrible, I did terrible things.  But Harry, he saved me, from them, from myself.  He… got the leader arrested, and most of the others too.  They’re locked away for good, and I’m free to live my life.”  The words tasted bitter in his mouth.  “But, I never made up for what I did, I never sought forgiveness, I never tried to redeem myself.  I never apologized to the people I hurt.  Not even him.”  Draco shook his head, feeling stupid for saying this all out loud.  “And now he’s made it his mission to apologize to me and all my friends, when he wasn’t even the one who….”  Draco trailed off, because he couldn’t very well explain how he’d held a wand to Dumbledore’s throat and nearly spoke those unforgivable words.   “So even if he did feel something for me,” Draco continued, defeated, “how could I have someone so good when I’m this sullied?”
“I’m finished,” Draco snapped, pulling Harry from his thoughts once more.  Merlin, he had never been this bad at school, even in Professor Binns’ class.
“Alright,” Draco said, not leading them out from the alley.  His voice sounded strained, and Harry looked up at him to see he had an awkward smile plastered in place.  “Who next?”
Before Potter could say a word, Draco shoved the map into his hands and stomped back into The Dragon’s Lair.
“You are far more than a mere symbol, Potter,” McGonagall cut in impatiently. “You are considered the saviour of the wizarding world. Your words hold weight; as do your actions. What do you think it looks like when you refuse to support the Hogwarts Unity event?”
Harry choked.  Ron had the grace to lean over and pat his back until Harry could regain his breath, but Hermione sat back with a stern expression as Harry spluttered for a response.  “What?  Why would you – who said anything about – I never even — ”
Draco bristled at the idea.  A Malfoy never begged, even the pathetic last heir.  Mother would be appalled.
“My dear boy,” the elderly man spoke, “just tell him how you feel. Severus is right, this is a long time coming.”
that he’d noticed — it was suddenly impossible not to glance at the other boy’s lips every few seconds, or stare at the way the lights reflected off his hair, or get lost in the musicality of his speech.  Draco’s presence was so distracting, so intoxicating, he could hardly keep track of their conversations.  He spoke without thinking, even though that was surely something Draco would take issue with.  He couldn’t help it though — Draco was so alluring.
“Thanks for this,” Connor said with his dimpled grin, placing the romance novel on the desk for Dr. Finch to ring up.  “And, maybe,” he went on, plucking one of the bookstore’s business cards and a pen off the desk and scribbling something on the back of it, “you could call me.”  He handed Draco the card, making sure their fingers brushed.  “I’m here a few weeks, it’d be nice to have a local guide.  If you’re up to it.”
McGonagall nodded and Filch turned to lead the way. As she started toward the door, McGonagall paused to say, “Can I rely on you to do the right thing, Potter?”
Draco nodded curtly in response, and strode past the other man without a second glance.  He knew Harry was following at a distance, since they were both leaving the Mansion, but Draco was grateful for the space.  It wasn’t until he’d reached the front door and apparated onto his own doorstep that he realized his hands were clenched into fists, his fingernails digging crescent-shaped dents into his palms.
“Is that supposed to mean something to me?” he sighed, crossing his arms.  It really was quite cold and he longed for the cozy warmth of the bookstore.
What a fool he’d made of himself.  He desperately hoped Potter would call it quits so he would never have to face him again.  And yet, the thought made him oddly cold.
Harry stood then, making them far too close, so Draco took a step back, hating that it looked like a retreat.  Draco Malfoy didn’t run away from his problems.
Draco nodded quickly, not meeting his eyes.  “Harry is,” he went on, hoping to distract from his slip-up, “a very good person.”
“Don’t mention it,” Harry replied weakly, and she finally broke her uncaring façade to give him a wry grin.
Harry shrugged, not keen on telling them the subject of his preoccupation.  Merlin, they’d just get on him for stalking Malfoy again, like this was even close to the same thing.
“So I guess you’re blameless then?” Draco cut in flatly.  His menacing tone rivaled that of Professor Snape’s.
“Your presence is a curse, Pansy,” Draco informed her with a long sigh.  “We all just suffer through it.”
“Wait, Draco!” Harry said, guilt settling into his ribs.  He caught up with the blonde in only a few steps, and grabbed his arm.
They both stood still for a moment longer before turning back to their table and sitting down again.  It was quiet as they settled in.  They both sipped uneasily at their drinks.
“Potter,” the boy said, soaked to the bone from the storm, his silvery blonde hair plastered to his forehead unevenly.
He had been so close.  Draco could’ve touched him.  How could Harry go from setting Draco’s teeth on edge to making him feel like the most important person in the world?  That was how Harry looked at him sometimes, like nothing else mattered, like nothing else
“All of these books here,” she went on, “contain so much knowledge that most people are unaware of.  To so many people, these books are uncharted territory.  So until you open a book and read it, it could be anything.”
who you are now.”  Harry bit his tongue when Draco’s eyes widened.  “I mean,” he amended hastily, “you’re more yourself now.  War makes people act different than they really are, and now that it’s over, I feel like I’m meeting the real you for the first time.”
Parkinson’s mouth twitched, like she was fighting off an expression.  “What a speech,” she commented dryly, and she stepped aside so he could enter.  “Tea, Potter?”
Draco bit his lip. “I’m not good enough for him,” he whispered, feeling shame creep through him at the admission. “I did bad things.”
Feeling mischievous, Harry went on with an innocent expression, “Pansy Parkinson?  Don’t you know her?”
Bore him?  Harry straightened up hastily, realizing he’d been slumping slightly, and scrambled for words.  “No – I – er – continue what you were saying,” he stuttered so very casually, endeavoring to listen intently to whatever Draco was saying.  Unfortunately, this meant his eyes kept sliding down to Draco’s lips.  He forced himself to look into Draco’s steely grey eyes instead, which wasn’t too hard once he got there.  There was just a hint of blue in those smoky depths, and Harry chased after it with his eyes.  If he stared long enough, he was sure he could evoke the exact color.
Greg visibly stiffened, panic setting into his face — although to be fair to Greg, every emotion he felt was visible in every line of his body.
“Wait!” a voice shouted from behind them, and they turned to see Gregory Goyle rushing their way.  Harry tensed, thinking of Draco’s comment on Goyle’s fighting proclivities, but Goyle stopped several metres away.  “I guess I forgive you,” he said, panting slightly as he shifted from foot to foot.  “And I guess I should be sorry too.”
“That’s bullocks,” Draco snapped, smile vanishing.  “Pansy loves you now, and Blaise is even asking when you’ll be visiting again.  Even Greg has expressed concern over your mental state, without prompting.”
“Also, your house is tacky,” Harry added, as if this was an important point, and Draco couldn’t help but crack a grin.
now.  As much as Draco might pretend that would be a relief, the thought of Harry leaving his life now was making him feel queasy.
“Romance, huh?” Connor murmured from right behind Draco, and Draco spun around to be face to face with the dashing Californian.
Harry, who had just downed his glass like a shot and was swaying slightly as he set the empty glass on the side table, blinked a few times to get his bearings.  Blaise’s eyes followed his unsteady movements with a critical eye, but he made no comment.  “Er, yes, brief…as a button,” he said with renewed valor, and Draco blushed on his behalf.
“What is it this time, Potter?” Draco said coolly, noting how Harry startled out of his trance.  “Is there something on my face?”
Rolling his eyes again, Draco made to leave, but Potter reached out and grabbed his arm.  “Malfoy,” he said, sounding embarrassed — as he should be.
, Potter,” Draco explained with a sigh.  It was hard to believe how clueless this man was sometimes.
could do that,” he sighed, then let out an airy chuckle.  “Who would’ve thought,” he said wryly to the stone, “I’m jealous of Vincent Crabbe.”
“One minute!” he hissed, cutting off Malfoy’s protest and leaving him by the door as he barged into the kitchen.
Ron nodded, though he seemed surprised by his own agreement.  “She’s not as horrible as I remember,” he said thoughtfully.
“Potter, let me interrupt you there. Do you have any idea how much sway you hold over the wizarding world?”  McGonagall peered at him over her glasses.
Harry was shaking his head even before Draco finished his question.  “Because I could see the real you back then too.  Only you were hiding better.”
Draco didn’t deign to answer, taking a swig of his butterbeer instead.  He’d ordered it out of nostalgia, thinking it would lift his spirits, but now he just wished it was firewhiskey.  Remembering Blaise’s specially aged firewhiskey, Draco wondered if Ros still had that expired stuff, and if it would be worth the risk of poisoning to drink it.  He was starting to think anything would be better than one more second dwelling on the way Potter’s lips curled upward when he smiled, or determining the exact shade of green that his eyes were.  Emerald, perhaps.
Harry rubbed his eyes under his glasses, yawning.  It was a wonder his patronus was a stag and not some type of feline.  “Alright,” Harry agreed easily, and Draco was rather taken aback that he hadn’t put up a fight.
Stupid bloody Potter with his stupid bloody promises and his big green eyes and his dumb messy hair.  Argh, Draco was going crazy!
And Ronald Weasley had saved Greg, which Draco was endlessly grateful for, though he would never for the life of him admit that to the arrogant ginger.
“Are you going to keep staring at me?” Draco snapped, and Harry blinked, averting his eyes only to look right back at Draco’s face.  There wasn’t anything else interesting to look at in this dank place.  At least, that was the excuse Harry was going with.
For a moment, nothing came to mind — except for a harrowing image of Potter and Greg snogging passionately, which was hurriedly dismissed — and then Draco remembered Potter’s whole
“Draco Malfoy,” he told her, and her eyebrows raised but she didn’t comment.  “Not a doctor,” he added with a wink of his own.
Draco glared at Dr. Finch, who was all too happy to betray him.  Potter shook his head at her suggestion, then paused and said, as if struck with an idea, “Yes, actually.  Could you help me find it,
“Potter, you idiot,” Draco hissed, dragging him by the lapels into a side alley.  “You just apparated onto a muggle street!”
Draco snapped his book shut, startling a few nearby pigeons, and got to his feet.  All he wanted to do was find Potter and strangle him.  Curse him for getting himself stuck in Draco’s head all week.  He’d survived for three years Potter-free and now suddenly he’d encountered the man twice in less than a week.  At least he wouldn’t be coming back, Draco had been quite clear about that.  And yet, every time Draco’s thoughts drifted they landed on Harry bloody Potter!
Harry wished he could keep his face as expressionless as she could, but as it was, Harry was sure he was practically gaping.  She’d said aloud — well, she’d implied — that Draco was gay, right?  He hadn’t misheard that?
Draco refused to look as off-balance as he felt, but it was difficult with those entrancing brown eyes staring at him like nothing else existed in the world.  “That depends if you want a happy or sad ending.”
“We’ll be on our way,” Draco ground out, turning on his heel without so much as a goodbye.  He didn’t even glance Potter’s way, not wanting to see how he’d reacted to Greg’s suggestion, but he heard the other’s footsteps follow him out into the cool air.  Draco was suddenly quite grateful for the chilly breeze, as the pub had been far too warm for his comfort.  Not to mention the sudden barrage of images assaulting his mind: Potter leading him up to one of the Three Broomstick’s rooms, Potter tugging on the front of his shirt to drag him close, Potter’s sinfully wet lips attacking his own….
But Draco didn’t chose to live with muggles simply because he wanted to.  He had worked for that genocidal maniac, and every witch and wizard knew it.  In the muggle world, he was just another person on the street.  Not that he had broken off all ties with the wizarding world.  He still stayed in touch with his mother, and Pansy, and Greg, and Blaise.  And of course sometimes a bespectacled war hero would pop in on him uninvited.
Draco met her earnest eyes. “It doesn’t erase my past.  I…was like those people…those people who believed they were better than others.  Superior.”  The confession was more difficult than he’d imagined.  His vision seemed to swim and crossfade to the face of the muggle studies teacher that the Dark Lord had tortured and killed in his own dining room, and the way Nagini had swallowed her body whole as she struggled and begged.  Harry wouldn’t have sat there petrified and done nothing.  He would’ve saved her, the great big hero that he was.
Connor turned his gaze to the cover, before looking appraisingly at Draco again.  “Is this your favorite?”
Immediately, Harry felt his muscles tense and his blood boil.  “Yes, I do,” he growled, and both his friends flinched at the steel in his voice.
Snape raised an eyebrow. It was so similar to Draco’s icy controlled looks that Harry felt disoriented for a moment. “Well, you could always ask me,” the former professor proffered with an air of boredom that Harry was fairly sure was feigned.
Flint turned his worried grey eyes on Draco, who stood behind Harry so he couldn’t see what he did, but Flint’s worry seemed to have diminished by the time he addressed Harry again.  “What do you want?” he asked gruffly, like he wasn’t used to being civil.
Harry chewed his lip, lost in thoughts of an emaciated Draco dying in bed with no one to care for him.  “He already agreed to meet with me,” he muttered distractedly.
“Of course you do, darling,” Pansy laughed out, then squealed as Lavender presumably took her by surprise.
“Yes, Potter,” the boy said, exasperation seeping into his panicked voice, “it’s me, Draco Malfoy — now, really, we must go.”
with the owner’s ridiculously over-recycled name printed on top.  “Is it the owner you’re worried about?  Podric Batworthy XXIII?”  He idly wondered how twenty-three generations hadn’t been able to come up with a more original name, or if they somehow thought adding numbers amounted to prestige.
Oblivious, Potter rambled on, “…I didn’t know what that spell would do, Malfoy, I would never have done that to you on purpose — ”
There was literally no response Harry could think to give to that, so he settled with a desperate, “Did you just threaten me?”
“Er, are you sure?” Harry asked dubiously. Snape wasn’t exactly one to listen to student problems before, though Harry supposed he must’ve had plenty of practice with Draco.
Hermione looked mortified, though considering what had just transpired Harry felt he was the only one there who should be feeling that way.  “But you said,” she began timidly, “you were…
“No,” Draco insisted grumpily, “I mean stupidity.  Even you don’t bother me when I’m really pissed about something.”
Harry flashed a grin at him, delighting in the way it made Draco purse his lips in distaste.  “Never,” Harry declared triumphantly.  “I’m a Gryffindor.”
The Dragon’s Lair always cleared his head.  Draco strode out of the park with purpose, heading to his favorite bookstore.  Maybe Dr. Finch would allow him to curl up on the tiny couch in the corner with a book and some warm cocoa.  That was a plan he could get behind.
“Malfoy,” Potter said breathlessly, getting in Draco’s face and forcing him to stop.  “I’m sorry, I don’t think it’s your fault.  I swear I don’t.”
Pansy sniffed haughtily, tucking her legs under herself on the sofa.  “I think you mean stubbornness.  And if that’s a quality you dislike so much, I’m surprised you lasted a day in Slytherin.”
It was a dreary day out, the kind where the sky was as grey as the pavement, and the sun was nothing but a faint glow.  The air was still and bitter cold, and Draco shivered under his padded coat.  His lunch hour was almost up, and he was on his way back to the bookstore when there was a loud
Draco frowned at her as she wiped the counter.  “Not everything’s about Potter,” Draco said bitterly.
“This is about Harry Potter, isn’t it?” Ros guessed, interrupting his musings and giving him a sly smile.
, Potter,” Draco sighed again, and before they could even knock, the door swung inward as if they were expected.
He flew up until the clouds began to obscure his view, determined to put as much distance as possible between them before dropping down to navigate.  They’d only been flying a few minutes when Draco gasped in Harry’s ear and let go with one arm.
“How are you?” Draco asked, trying to avoid the real reason he hadn’t called — or even thought of — Connor, which was that the most famous wizard alive kept whisking him away on apology sprees and that Draco was pathetically in love with the tosser.
The silence that followed was palpable.  Hermione finally came over and rested a hand on Harry’s shoulder, but he shrugged it off.  “Harry,” she tried, “It wasn’t your fault.”
.  Draco cleared his throat awkwardly, standing up straight.  “Fictional character,” he fibbed hastily.  “Shall we?” he asked, already walking away to the front.
Greg shrugged his beefy shoulders, apparently unable to back up his assumption, and turned back to his task.  “I’ll be out in a minute, I just have to finish sorting through this firewhiskey.  Some of these bottles are expired, and Ros says we can’t serve those.”
“Do you need any help?” Draco asked suddenly, and the old woman raised her eyebrows in surprise.  “I mean, do you need an assistant, to help around the shop?”
Harry felt his lips curling up at the corners, beyond his control. Draco liked him. His own Godfather had spoken to it. Draco Malfoy
Draco grimaced, crossing his arms.  “What are you doing, Potter?”  His jacket sleeves pulled up a little at the wrists, and for some reason the pale skin there was monopolizing Harry’s thoughts.
Harry, who had been gaping at the vaulted glass ceiling where the sun was glancing off every surface and creating rainbows and shimmering images of animals that danced around in the light, now looked back at Daphne Greengrass in awe.  “I’m sorry, Daphne,” he began, with a guilty expression, “I have to admit I don’t really remember you from school.”
The lane wasn’t actually a mile long — in fact they’d hardly walked ten metres before they arrived at the front door.  The magnificent mansion had diminished to the size of a large house now that they were closer.
“Is that all you know about me?” he scoffed, but there was something more hiding behind his mocking tone.  Was it resentment, or hurt?
— chastised and pulled Harry away by his arm.  Glancing over his shoulder, Harry tried to give Goyle an apologetic smile but he was already making his way back to the pub.  As they walked, Harry noticed that Draco hadn’t let go of Harry’s arm, which he held in a loose grip, but Harry said nothing, not wanting to bring that to Draco’s attention.
.”  One of his hands reached up to pull at his own hair, a look of torment on his features.  Draco wanted to smooth that look away.  “I fucked up, I know,” Harry went on, his other hand dragging over his face roughly.  His legs couldn’t stay still, shifting back and forth, trying to find a comfortable spot.  “I’ve done it again, and again, and
“Well,” Draco answered in a strange voice — it was a mix between bitterness and amazement, if that was possible — “not every Voldemort supporter was defended by the savior of the wizarding world at their trial.”
Draco let himself smile back.  There was nothing wrong with being charmed by a very forward customer.  “I relate to the rude British man who is really just looking out for his friends.”
“No,” she declared, but her voice was even and she didn’t seem particularly upset.  “Go on,” she urged when he didn’t immediately continue.
Draco rolled his eyes.  Surely Potter must know about Shakespeare.  Even Draco was aware of him before coming to the muggle world.  He was one of many classical artists who had run ins with magical creatures and wizardkind.  He’d written whole plays dedicated to the magical sights he’d seen.  Either Potter really was that thick, or he hadn’t been paying any attention in Professor Binns' History of Magic classes.  “Shall we?” he said, gesturing to the door.
But now was not the time to dwell on that.  He took off as fast as the broom would allow, gaining altitude until the houses looked like lego blocks below, and he could just barely make out the Dursleys driving away in their car.  And even as Harry and Draco flew away, he could still hear the loud bang of apparition from below as Death Eaters appeared and swarmed number four, Privet Drive.  Harry hoped they wouldn’t pursue the Dursleys in an attempt to find him.  Maybe they’d just wait, thinking they’d gone out to the pictures or something.
“Er, right,” Harry began, trying to focus on the woman in front of him and not on Draco’s smirk he could see out of the corner of his eye.  “Pansy — can I call you – ”
The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Annoy-Draco-Malfoy shrugged slightly as he ran a hand through his already impossibly messy hair.  Draco wanted to swat his hand away, on behalf of all hairstylists.  “Well,” Potter started awkwardly, “I didn’t exactly apparate.”  He then held up a small antique key, rusted and attached to a thin cord.  Draco awaited elaboration, but Potter didn’t seem obliged to go on.
“What?” he shouted back, not interested in getting up just to endure his uncle’s accusations or admonishments or whatever it was that warranted him speaking to Harry at all.
There was a moment of silence as Flint stared at Harry, open-mouthed.  His teeth looked like they were trying to jump out.  Then, without warning, he busted out laughing, a raucous, hacking laugh that made Harry want to cover his ears.  “Tracey!” he bellowed, still cackling, his eyes watering in his mirth.  “Get out here, this is priceless!”
“You better not cause any trouble, Mr. Potter,” she told him coolly, and Draco started to wonder if she and Potter had a history of some sort.  “I don’t want anyone upsetting my patrons.”
Blaise was leading them down a hall, the sounds of the party fading as they got farther away from the source.  The hall was filled with portraits of all the men Blaise’s mother had married and purportedly killed; there were eight so far.  Neither Draco nor Blaise were under the illusion that she was innocent, but in their book she was smart enough to not ever be caught and that was an admirable feat in itself.
“Oh,” Harry said, perplexed. He tried to conjure up memories of some unnamed Slytherin girl but nothing really came to mind. “Er…what’s she got to do with this?”
“Shit,” Harry muttered and glanced up at the clock just as it turned to 12:01. Letting the memo fall onto his desk, Harry grabbed his travelling cloak in a rush and bolted toward the emergency auror’s floo fireplace. Professor McGonagall had taken to opening her office fireplace to the ministry’s floo network whenever she and Harry had a meeting, since he had rather consistently forgot and had to floo in last minute. Travelling by floo was still slightly disorienting to Harry and so when he stepped through into the Headmistress’s office, he nearly fell over if not for the wall he was able to lean against.
Harry looked blankly at them.  “Yes, Hermione,” he said, “I don’t have some ulterior motive for apologizing to the Slytherins.”
Draco frowned, crossing his arms.  “How do you know there’s a park?  Have you been stalking me?”  Maybe it hadn’t been stupid to lead Potter away from his home the other day after all.
Harry thought. “Oh!” he said suddenly. “That’s perfect! Thank you, professor” – he turned to Snape – “professors. I appreciate all the advice. And I…I’ll tell him.”
The door flung open, and Harry spun around to see Marcus Flint standing in the doorway, looking wary.  He didn’t appear much different from how Harry remembered him.  He still had large, crooked teeth that made him look faintly trollish, though he’d let his coarse black hair grow out to his shoulders, and it suited him better than the short-haired look.  “Harry Potter?” the man said cautiously.  His nose looked like it had been broken more than once; it had so many twists and turns it was hard to tell if had ever been straight.
Harry frowned at him.  “Are you trying to encourage me?” he asked, perplexed.  Since when did Draco actually want him to succeed?
warned him.  “All the same,” Harry forged on, turning back to Nott, “I am sorry for how us Gryffindors treated you lot in school.”  These apologies were getting quite succinct, but since Harry had hardly interacted with many of the Slytherins outside Draco’s immediate friend group, it was difficult to be specific.
“Maybe he’ll never realize it and we won’t have to welcome Malfoy to the family after all,” Ron suggested hopefully.
And that was how Harry got doused with alcohol for a second time that day, and Draco got banned from the Greengrass Estate forever.
“Of course you didn’t,” Draco sighed, “you’re as good as muggleborn.  Muggle Studies is demeaning and dehumanizing.  We don’t have
He leaned down and conjured a small white tulip with his wand.  Hermione had told him once that muggles had created a language of flowers.  Different species and colors held different meanings.  Harry had never encountered this in his experiences in the muggle world, although his experiences had been rather limited at the Dursley’s.  She said the meanings were based on potion-making ingredients.  Likely, back when wizards and witches consorted with muggles, the rumor that these flowers carried specific meanings, in connection with their use in certain potions, became widespread belief, especially once the wizarding world began to withdraw into secrecy.  The white tulip, Hermione told him, was a key ingredient in Largioserum, a potion that could dissolve resentment in the drinker and urge them to make peace with their enemies.  It was used as an alternative to torture in medieval wartime, in order to convince prisoners to cooperate.  In the language of flowers, the white tulip represented forgiveness.
Draco groaned, leaning back in his seat and burying his face in his hands.  “Hex him?” he suggested.
But even on those miserable days, Malfoy’s hair never seemed to be affected by wind — the most it ever did was appear stylishly mussed.  His white-blonde hair was like a beacon on dreary days, like a lighthouse leading lost ships to safety.  And on sunny days it rivaled the sun itself, a glow forming around his head like a halo.  But Malfoy’s face, contrary to his perpetual glow, was almost always drawn, and tired, and sad.  And maybe that was why Harry kept going back, thinking of ways to apologize, because he couldn’t stand to see that look on Malfoy’s face.
As they continued gasping for breath, Harry felt a cold sense of dread wash over him; it didn’t take a genius to know these two were mocking Harry for all they were worth.  There was something especially humiliating about being the one who had attempted peace.  None of the other Slytherins had received him this poorly — Harry wasn’t prepared for it.  Anger, he could handle.  Caution, too.  But for them to have not changed at all….  Why did he feel so stupid all of a sudden?
No, Draco wasn’t going to waste his time thinking about Potter.  He was going to have a nice, quiet day in the bookstore, organizing the philosophy section and seeking out the next fascinating muggle text to read.  It was a drizzly day out so the bookstore would feel especially cozy.
Draco followed him out though it was tempting to just lock the door after him.  He did throw a withering look back at Dr. Finch, who was unperturbed by his ire.
Harry was dying to say something, anything, just to make it less tense, but nothing came to mind.  He opened his mouth a few times, only to close it seconds later because he couldn’t think of a topic.  The weather was nice today.  Hermione had been nagging him about paperwork again, classic Hermione.  Ron managed to knock over his favorite Quidditch player in excitement while getting his autograph last week, can you imagine?  But Draco didn’t care about Harry’s friends, that much was clear.  The thought left him dejected.
With a reserved sort of snort, Blaise turned his attention back to the pouting Harry Potter and informed him kindly, “No, Mr. Potter, your apology is not accepted.”
When they reached the door, Harry leaned forward and opened it before Draco could, which was a bit odd since Draco was in front, and gestured for Draco to go through with a short “after you.”  Draco couldn’t tell if he was imagining the feeling of Harry’s warmth behind him, seeping into the skin of his back.
Draco suddenly thought of Severus Snape, and his patronus, how it changed to a doe to reflect the woman he loved, how he made a mistake — many mistakes — and it led to that woman’s death, and how he spent the rest of his life trying to make things right because of her.  How Potter was now on a mission to make things right.  If only Draco would let him.
“Are you leaving then?” he spat out, fury and terror warring across his features as he stepped back and out of the way.
It would have been weird to have a laugh with his once-nemesis, so Draco just sniffed haughtily.  “It’s a nickname, not a saying.”
Hermione sighed and smacked Ron’s arm as he tried to reach his fork over to her plate.  “Maybe you should move on to some of the others and try again with Malfoy after you’ve given him some space,” she suggested.  “I’m sure he’d feel less pressured if he saw you were sincere about it, and that you care enough to make amends with his friends.”
Harry blinked, retreating his hand abruptly, like a spell had been broken.  “Sorry?” he asked, all traces of cordiality gone.
Draco rolled his eyes, but didn’t seem too bothered by the jab.  “Did you ever take Muggle Studies, Potter?”
Lavender smirked and snagged Parkinson’s waist in her arms.  “This one’s my girlfriend,” she told him proudly, as Parkinson squirmed away.
“Thanks,” Connor said, and then winking at Dr. Finch behind the counter: “It was good to meet you too, Doctor.”
Harry grinned at them. “Yes. Yes, I do.” And with that he rushed toward the fireplace and flood back to the ministry, feeling electrified.
Scoffing at the implication, but looking entirely unaffected, Draco instead squeezed onto the couch next to Parkinson and Lavender.  The two girls seemed to be gradually twining most of their limbs together, an impressive feat, and it felt oddly intimate to watch, so Harry settled his gaze on Draco, who happened to be staring back at him.  Draco quickly averted his eyes, a hint of pink creeping onto his cheeks.  Harry felt a rush of pride at having put it there.
“Thanks,” he told her, but she was already sinking into the couch, Parkinson settling in beside her.
Connor grinned, letting one of his hands drop onto Draco’s knee, but before either of them could say or do anything more, one of the girls a few tables over gave a little shriek of excitement, and said, “Look!  There’s an owl at the window!”
Harry forced himself not to grin too widely at that in fear of Draco changing his mind, but a small smile wormed its way onto his face nonetheless.  Draco apparated them into a dim concrete stairwell, and Harry had to blink a few times to let his eyes adjust.  His companion had already started walking away up the steps, so Harry hurried after him.  Since Draco didn’t look back to see if Harry was indeed following, Harry felt no qualms staring at Draco’s back as they ascended.  Draco held himself as elegantly as a pureblood was supposed to, with an air of effortless perfection.  Something about it drew Harry in, like falling into a black hole.
Aunt Petunia dropped the spatula she was holding and held her hand to her heart as it clattered to the floor.  “
The walk was short and pleasant enough, though he could do without being almost run over by unapologetic cyclists.  The moment the storefront’s sign came into view, Draco let the corners of his lips quirk up in a soft smile.  He loved the the little green dragons decorating the sides, and the elegant curling font of the words.  It always filled him with a sense of contentment and calm.  It was turning out to be a fairly good day after all.
“Potter, as I said,” McGonagall replied tiredly, “you hold more influence than you seem to be aware of. If you start this trend, many will follow. I’m tired of dealing with the anti-Slytherin rhetoric just within these walls, let alone in the public arena.”
“I think that’s quite enough for the day, Potter, wouldn’t you agree?”  Draco had placed his hands in his pockets, as if to keep them from Harry.  It was just as well, seeing as Harry felt a strong urge to snatch them up again, and Merlin knew what curse Draco would cast on him then.
Greg looked about as concerned as he should be in the circumstances, and Draco watched Potter shrewdly as he decided how to word his apology.
McGonagall noticed his eyes sliding toward Dumbledore’s empty portrait. “He should be back soon. Feel free to stay and chat while I deal with this.” And with that she was gone, the spiral doorway grinding shut behind her.
Harry scanned the gravestones, looking for one name in particular.  Every grave was granted its own body-sized portion of earth, though Harry knew most of these were out of respect rather than necessity; many of these people hadn’t had bodies left to bury.
“You’re wrong,” Draco snapped immediately, a mask of anger falling over his fair features.  “I was myself then, and I’m myself now.  Nothing has changed.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered into the quiet, still air.  He tried to think of any good memories he had of Crabbe, or at least not bad ones.  Nothing came to mind.  But that was alright; those good memories of Crabbe weren’t for him.  They belonged in the hearts of Crabbe’s family and friends.  It was enough to know that they existed.
Draco hesitated.  A drink didn’t mean anything.  It could just be a friendly gesture.    And he did feel bad for forgetting his promise to Connor.  “Alright,” he found himself saying, trying not to think of any possible ramifications, like Potter somehow finding out and never wanting to speak to Draco again.  Besides, it wasn’t like he owed Harry anything.  Perhaps Connor was just the distraction Draco needed to get his mind off that insufferable wizard.
“Fine,” Draco growled, and Harry let him shove him toward the empty fireplace.  “Potter, you first.”
“Well,” the woman went on as if she had expected as much, “in olden times, when the first maps were being created, people hadn’t explored everywhere yet.  And so, in the places they hadn’t explored, they would draw sea serpents and lizard-monsters with the caption ‘Here be dragons’ to indicate the unknown.  You see?”
There was a pause where Rosmerta was undoubtedly deciding whether or not to impart some bit of wisdom.  “Harry,” she finally said, “it’s not about what was done, but about how much you regret having done it.”
“Yes, it was,” Harry whispered, feeling the shame wash over him.  He forced himself to stand up straighter and look at Hermione.  “And I need to apologize for that.”
“Bloody hell, Malfoy,” Potter gasped as they appeared on a crowded street in Hogsmeade, and Draco was stupidly pleased that he’d startled Potter into both swearing and using his last name again.  (He briefly wondered what other ways he could startle Potter but cut short that train of thought as it inevitably lead to snogging and more enthusiastic activities.)
“Honestly, Draco, I don’t think I ever met the Greengrasses,” Harry hedged as they appeared in front of the Greengrass gate.  Little metal songbirds were flitting about the bars, chirping in their tinny voices.  The Greengrasses were all quite adept in charms and their estate was the most flamboyant of all the old families — and definitely the most pleasant.  It almost made up for the Greengrasses themselves.
“Really, Hermione,” Harry said, leaning forward and placing his hand on hers.  She looked up and met his gaze, her warm brown eyes filled with concern.  “I’m okay.”
Draco stared at him, suspicion playing across his features until he forced his expression into something more neutral, and glanced restlessly away at the other patrons again.  “Lots of things, Potter.  You’ve known me for years, don’t tell me you haven’t noticed.”
“It’s the right thing to do!” Harry insisted as he flicked his wand to set the dishes scrubbing.  His friends looked unconvinced.  “And what do you mean by healthy, anyway?  What’s wrong with apologizing?  I would think that’s a good thing.”
“I’m going to drop you off first so you don’t keep pestering me at the bookstore,” Draco informed him curtly, apparently explaining the arm situation.  “Where do you want to go?”
Harry blushed slightly under her dazzling smile.  Draco knew how intoxicating the Greengrasses could be; he couldn’t blame Harry for acting so starstruck.  Besides, Draco had picked this place to lift Harry’s spirits.  If Draco were to interrupt now it would accomplish the opposite of that.
“Nonsense,” she snapped, nostrils flaring, and for a moment she reminded him of Professor Mcgonagall.  “I don’t need to know all the details to know that who you are now is what matters.”
The hope that broke over Harry’s face was worth any amount of groveling, money, humiliation, in the world.  It was like watching a sunrise over a wide, gentle ocean.  “Alright?” he repeated, and his voice was worse, like a man who’d lost his will to live being offered a second chance.
“There was nothing I could do back then,” Dr. Finch said, expression softening out with a more muted melancholia.  “Too many things had to be kept secret.”
“Well, that’s a relief,” Ron muttered into the tense silence, and all three of them busted out laughing despite themselves.
That only seemed to infuriate him more.  His clenched fists were shaking.  “Stop with your insignificant apologies.  They mean nothing.”  Each word was infused with venom.
incident.  “That went well,” he sighed in frustration, and after a quick glance around to make sure he was alone, he apparated back to his flat.
“Lucky,” Draco muttered, turning away to stare at the far wall.  He really hoped his ears weren’t bright red, but after Harry’s sudden arrival Draco couldn’t quite chase the blush off his cheeks.  The loss of composure was unsettling for Draco.
, Draco,” Harry pointed out, as they dawdled in front of a shady barbershop in Knockturn Alley, labelled only
“Oh Harry,” Hermione said gently, a kind smile on her face.  “We love you.  That will never change.”
“I’m… not sure I have the time,” Draco hedged, hoping Connor would leave it at that.  As appealing as he was, with his surfer’s drawl and toned muscles and tanned skin, he wasn’t Potter, and that was his biggest flaw.  Because apparently Draco had terrible taste in men.
, he disappears for a week and it drives you insane!  So yes, he’s the worst person I’ve ever met because at least the Death Eaters were predictable,
— nodded happily and ambled over to the door, waving briefly at Dr. Finch before stepping into the drizzle.
At least Crabbe had been there for Draco, had supported him through thick and thin, had beat up anyone who Draco didn’t like.  Harry wondered if Crabbe would beat him up for upsetting Draco these past few weeks, if he were still alive.  He probably would.
“Only if you make us tea,” Parkinson countered, but it was clearly an empty threat with the way she was smiling fondly at Lavender.
Shaking his head to clear it of those unhelpful thoughts, Draco pulled Harry into his usual side alley, and disapparated them without giving Potter a word of warning.  It was only fair that Potter felt as unbalanced as Draco did, after all.
“An old friend,” Draco told her wryly, kissing her cheek as he reached her.  “You won’t believe this one, Ros, stick around for the show.”
Connor rolled his eyes good-naturedly.  “You stood me up for another guy, right?  So, what’s his name?”
“Blimey, Harry, have you gone completely bonkers?” Ron exclaimed, shoveling more eggs into his mouth.
“I’ve come to apologize,” he plowed on, hoping to appease her.  “I was a right git to you in school.”
“I’ll take this broom and shove it up your arse!” Nott bellowed, and Harry jumped back as Nott brandished his broom, trying to keep a straight face.
“Apologizing,” Harry replied, bewildered as he took in her half-shaved head and not-weather-appropriate tank top and shorts.  “And what do you mean?  Draco’s outside.”
“We were all kids!” Ron retorted angrily, standing now.  Hermione also stood, trying to keep some distance between them, but she was biting her lip in worry, not knowing how to deescalate the situation.  “That doesn’t excuse what he called Hermione!  Or how he treated my family!  His dad nearly killed my sister!”
“He’s not a friend,” Draco insisted, fishing out a £5 note from his wallet and placing it on her desk.
It was five days after Harry had parted ways with Draco at Zabini Mansion, and Harry was enjoying lunch with Ron and Hermione at the Leaky Cauldron — enjoying because he was distracted by thoughts of a certain blonde saying, “Alright” and “Yes” with the most dumbfounded expression Harry had ever seen on him — when Pansy Parkinson interrupted them out of nowhere by slamming her hands down on their table.
Draco whipped his head around to see a grumpy-looking barn owl pecking furiously at the window.  Attached to its leg was a tiny scroll.
This was the graveyard for Voldemort’s supporters who died during the Battle of Hogwarts.  No fancy statues or memorials for them.  The Ministry had set up anti-vandalism wards, but that was the only courtesy the wizarding world had extended.  It was chilling in this small, out-of-the-way place not connected to any town, mostly because it was so understated.  Harry might’ve felt more at ease if there were statues of gargoyles and a perpetual mist curling over elegant marble tombstones.  But it was oddly unremarkable.  Just a patch of dirt on the side of an unfrequented road.  It was just as well, Harry supposed; no one wanted to be seen visiting
“Don’t worry, Greg,” Draco explained with an amused smirk, “Potter just wants to feel morally superior to everyone else and would actually prefer if you
Luckily, the owl was smarter than Potter — not surprising, really — and so as soon as Draco stepped outside, it lifted a taloned foot and scratched through the tie holding the scroll to its other leg, letting the severed ribbon and the paper fall inconspicuously to the ground, and flew away with a indignant hoot.  After waiting a moment for the spectators to turn away in disappointment, Draco leant down and swiftly retrieved the scroll.  As much as Draco wanted to feel irritated at Harry’s thoughtlessness, he couldn’t tamp down on the excitement swelling in his chest.  What was so important that Harry needed to write him?  Did he visit the shop and couldn’t wait around for Draco to return?  Was he finally breaking off his tenuous friendship with the Malfoy heir?  Draco couldn’t open the scroll fast enough, his fingers fumbling in his haste.
When she took her book and turned, Draco could tell he’d been dismissed.  Heart heavy with unsaid words, Draco made his way silently to the door, trying to ignore the telltale sob which emanated from behind Dr. Finch’s desk.
right now) drifted out from an ancient radio in the corner of the room.  A room which was filled to the brim with stylish witches and wizards of all ages.  Several seemed quite appalled by their entrance, including an astoundingly tall woman wearing a color-changing feather boa who gasped audibly at their appearance, but a few others began applauding softly, as if Draco and Harry had just performed a stunt for their amusement.  Beside him, Potter almost bowed but Draco managed to grab his arm to stop them from further embarrassment.
Draco whirled around to face him, and Harry must have missed something because Draco was seething.  “You don’t get to pass judgement on me just because I’m not perfect like you!” he hissed, menacingly quiet in echoey street.  “Not everyone gets to be the hero, Harry, we don’t all get to grow up with the world cheering us on!  Do you really think I had a choice?”  His voice broke a little on the last word, and it ached in Harry’s heart.  “You never had to choose, anyway,” Draco went on, suddenly worn out, slumping against the closest wall.  “You never had to choose between your family and doing the right thing.”
— and here Draco’s stomach dropped; Harry didn’t like him after all, he didn’t want to spend time with him, it all meant nothing —
Dr. Finch didn’t respond immediately.  Her mouth was creased in a grim frown, her eyes shuttered of emotion.  When she finally did speak, it wasn’t in answer to his question.  “Go, Draco.  Live your life.  And love the people you’re allowed to love now.”
“No, I’m serious,” Draco insisted, “you can’t go bothering him if he, say, doesn’t accept your dumb apology, alright?”
Merlin, these reports were not getting written. Harry glanced at the wall clock and breathed a sigh of relief. It was almost his lunch break. He idly wondered if Draco would be getting his lunch soon. …What did he eat? What was his favourite food?
an accomplishment.  You made the people you cared about happy.”  Harry rubbed tiredly at his eyes, feeling himself droop.  “I wish
Harry blushed bright red. “N-no, it’s not that, professor – and…I will – but, it’s this House Unity event. I want to make sure the Slytherins aren’t represented poorly. But I don’t know…I’m not great at speeches.”
Rosmerta finally turned her assessing gaze on Harry, making him squirm as he stood there sheepishly.  “It’s good to see you again, Madam Rosmerta,” he muttered, barely meeting her eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes, but didn’t meet Harry’s gaze again.  He was worried his face might give away something he didn’t want it to.  “A lapse of judgement on my part, but I suppose it’s unavoidable.”  He took another sip of his butterbeer to make sure his throat was going to continue working and not do that thing where it sounded all breathy and nervous.  “Who are we harassing today?”
“Oh there’s no need to apologize again, Harry,” she assured him, gracing him with another coquettish smile despite his abrupt disinterest.  “I already know you’re half-blood.  It’s my business to know.  But it really can’t be helped.  So many pure wizarding families have diluted their bloodlines with muggle filth, there’s hardly any purebloods left.  It’s a travesty.”  She shook her head sadly, seeming to misinterpret Harry’s unease for understanding, and rushed to acquit him.  “At least your father was pure.  Shame about the mudblood mother.  I’m sure you’re nothing like her though.”  Her eyes were full of compassion, as if she were doing Harry a grand favor by accepting him and his half-blood status.
“Yes,” the blonde growled, and Potter seemed to finally realize how offensive he was being, because he quickly amended, “Well, that’s…good.  Great, I mean.  Great for you.”
Malfoy stopped walking abruptly.  Harry stopped a few paces further along and had to turn to face him.
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair.  This conversation was giving him a headache.  “I’m pretty sure I’d only stress him out more.  He’s not exactly fond of me.”
“Parkinson,” Harry greeted politely, thinking it best not to use her first name without express permission.
Ron shook his head, his face starting to turn the same color as his hair.  “Are you mad?” he shouted.  “He’s a spoiled brat, and as soon as daddy let him he became a Death Eater!”
“Because it’s the right thing to do,” Draco finished, raising his eyebrows in a challenge.  Potter opened and closed his mouth a few times, apparently stumped.  He rather resembled a gasping fish.  His eyes were smoldering with anger however, and Draco felt rather accomplished at having finally wiped that cheerful expression off his face.  Potter’s green eyes were magnetizing this close up, and Draco suddenly registered how close they really were, only about a foot apart, gazing into each other’s eyes.  Greg apparently noticed this too, as he cleared his throat pointedly, causing Draco to hastily turn back to his friend as if nothing had happened.
Draco spun around as soon as Harry touched him, effectively breaking their contact.  “Do not touch me, Harry Potter,” he hissed so menacingly that Harry stumbled a step back.  Draco’s nostrils were flared, and he was glaring so hard Harry thought flames might burst from his eyes.
“Sweet?” Draco repeated incredulously.  “Nothing about Potter’s unstable and self-centered behaviors is sweet, Pansy.”  He’d yet to take a drink of his tea, but kept swirling the spoon around in the liquid lazily with a twirl of his finger.  Pansy always prepared it with more sugar than Draco preferred, and he wasn’t keen on tasting it.
Harry hated lying to his friends.  But they just wouldn’t understand what he was doing.  They’d taken it badly the first time he’d brought up apologizing to Malfoy, and he doubted they’d take it much better this time after learning how pathetic his attempts were becoming.
Nott looked like he was about to threaten Harry again, but the shopkeeper starting shouting at Nott to get back to work, and the hair-creature was gurgling at a higher volume now, seemingly upset by the disturbance.
“Back in a moment,” Draco growled, grabbing the map and pushing Potter in front of him to the door.  Once they were outside again, in the freezing cold, Draco glanced up, expecting to see Potter’s stupid smirk, but instead the other man was frowning at him with — Merlin, was that
Potter had promised to come back and see him — and had promised to give it a few days because he was so damn considerate all of a sudden — and then
Harry didn’t have time for her dramatic monologues today.  “Then you should know to run and not look back.”
“Just hear me out, Malfoy,” Harry plowed on, trying not to be intimidated by Malfoy’s silence.  “I’ve been thinking about how I behaved and I regret not, you know, being nicer.  I know I should’ve stopped you from making dark choices.”
Potter was shaking his head before Draco finished his question.  “Malfoy,” he insisted, “I’m trying to tell you, that’s not what I meant.”
Ron at least had the decency to look sheepish, but Hermione just raised her eyebrows unapologetically.  “It’s…not like that,” Harry protested at last.
aplologized,” Harry insisted, butchering the word ‘apologize’, “on two separate occasions, but he won’t forgive me.”
Harry bit his lip.  He hated making Draco upset.  He just wanted to have a nice conversation with him.  And then maybe kiss him.  “You’re probably right,” he sighed, not sure if he completely agreed, but needing to show Draco he was on his side.  “They’re always trying to get me to give a speech too, and I’ve never wanted to.  It always felt like it was for the wrong reasons.  Maybe this year I’ll ask someone else to fill in for me.”
“I’d never,” Draco promised solemnly, then nodded to Potter who was standing awkwardly at his side.  “But
The gravestones here were small and unobtrusive, and it made Harry feel horribly guilty walking through them with his infamous lightning scar and unwanted stardom.  Amongst these bones, he wasn’t a hero, he wasn’t a savior.  He wasn’t welcome.
, we have History of Magic.  They treat the topic of muggles like zoology — you do know what zoology is, Potter?”
Harry worked his jaw.  “How long will it take him to find you?” he demanded, refusing to move toward the door.
“What sort of funny business?” Harry asked innocently, plucking his wand from his back pocket and twirling it between his fingers.  “Magic?”
Harry felt uncomfortable with the whole arrangement.  These were people who had chosen the wrong side, yes, but if history had fallen out differently, these headstones would list
“And that was so private?” Draco muttered, studying the arm of the couch he was sitting against.  It was unclear if he meant for anyone to hear him.
Harry paled, something suddenly clicking into place in his mind. “Runcorn. I…I impersonated him…to infiltrate the ministry.”
“How about,” Harry offered, standing again and approaching the other boy, “I give you no death at all, and we leave here together?”  He was standing in front of Malfoy now, and there was something enchanting about him this close, something in the way his eyes flickered with emotion, or the turn of his mouth, or the strands of his hair dancing in the light.
Harry Potter.  “You didn’t call me,” the man said in way of greeting, and Draco’s disappointment gave way to embarrassment.
“I suppose you’re right,” Harry allowed, but he felt rather reluctant to part ways just yet.  When did spending time with Draco become so crucial to his wellbeing?  It felt as if were he to leave now, something inside him would shatter.
“He’s waiting,” she said, no longer paying them any mind, and instead turning to nuzzle her girlfriend’s neck.
“What are you talking about, Malfoy?” he asked warily, not moving from his spot in the doorway.  Malfoy had minimal cover from the rain under the awning, but Harry wasn’t about to invite him inside.  Petunia would start shrieking about the water warping her hardwood floors, for one thing, and Harry really didn’t need to involve the Dursleys right now.
“I didn’t sign up for this,” Draco cut in disapprovingly, standing as well and blocking Harry’s path with a hand.  Obedient, Harry stopped, Draco’s hand brushing lightly against his chest.  “I’m taking Potter home for today, no more excursions.”
“Draco has apologized a multitude of times to me and explained his situation,” Rosmerta instantly dismissed.  “And he’s awfully polite, unlike most boys his age.”
is predictable.  But what Potter is is terrible, because he’s just stupid and heroic and always trying to
“I’m afraid,” Blaise said, rising from his seat with the effortlessness and fluidity of mist, “I must get back to my guests.  You may stay as long as you wish.  Draco,” Blaise added, turning to him with a fond smile that Draco knew was rehearsed, “I trust you remember the way out.”
Malfoy pursed his lips, but merely said, “You can take mine then.”  He nodded to the side, and Harry noticed a Nimbus 2000 leaning against the wall for the first time.  “Now go!”
“Well – I mean – it’s obviously supposed to,” Harry hurriedly added, “but overall I do worry it – just a bit – might actually be demonising the Slytherins. You know, since they didn’t fight.”
Connor’s worry morphed into a wry grin, though his eyes held some regret.  Draco didn’t have the energy to feel sorry for leading him on.  “The one you’re in love with?” he asked amiably.
“How long do we have?” Harry whispered.  No one was listening but it felt safer to keep their voices down.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco could see Potter frowning at him.  “Oh yes,” said Dr. Finch, reaching below the counter.  “I just got some yesterday, after those tourists from Germany came in the other day asking for one.  Always good to have some on hand.”
Harry smiled ruefully.  “Well,” he amended, “I’ve only been looking for about an hour.  Luckily you’re at one of four places I thought to check.”
Harry took the seat next to him as casually as if they were old friends, and politely asked Rosmerta if he could have a butterbeer as well.  “I’ve been looking for you,” Harry went on conversationally.
“This apology campaign is going well for you, Potter,” Draco remarked as they strode back up the lane and out through the gate, aiming to sound bored.
Malfoy cocked his head to the side curiously before giving a brief nod and striding off down the street.  Harry took that as a cue to follow him, and he jogged to catch up.  Soon they were walking side by side down Norwood Road in silence.  Eventually, Malfoy turned off down another street.  Harry began to wonder if Malfoy was taking him back to his flat, or mansion — wherever he lived.
“Tatiana,” Dr. Finch sighed, looking into the distance.  “She was the most incredible woman I’d ever met.”
Lavender came in through the other doorway as Parkinson pulled open the front door to let Draco in.  He was currently leaned against the opposite wall of the hallway, visible through the door, with his coat slung over his arm and an unhappy expression on his pointed face.
Draco groaned.  It was Harry, it had to be.  No one else would be so stupid as to send Draco letters via owl when he lived in a muggle area.  And no one else would have the timing Harry did.  Draco was caught between irritation, amusement, and relief.  The spot on his knee where Connor was touching him felt uncomfortable all of a sudden.
“There are loads of muggleborns at Hogwarts, and in the Ministry,” Harry replied, equally civil, not wanting to get into another fiery argument.  “It seemed to me like Slytherins were the only magic supremacists in school.”
“What genre would you prefer?” Draco asked, turning to lead him to the fiction section of the store.
There was a tug on Harry’s arm, and he let Draco pull him back a couple paces.  “We’re sorry to bother you at work, Mill,” Draco intervened smoothly, starting to lead Harry away.  “It was good seeing you.”
To his surprise, Connor barked out a laugh — and Merlin, if that wasn’t the most beautiful sound in the world.  “You really
“I’m afraid not,” Draco said.  In all honesty, it was a common sign in the wizarding world for dragon-infested areas, but in a muggle context Draco was unsure.
“Mr. Potter, you can’t seriously be as thick as you look,” Snape retorted sharply. “You and Mr. Malfoy have been obsessed with each other for years – I daresay since the first moment you met. Please tell me Ms. Granger at least noticed.”
Draco looked back at the other man; his hair had somehow become more disheveled than before.  “But he didn’t accept your apology,” Draco pointed out, wondering how Harry had forgotten that so quickly.
“Well, think of someone, will you?” Draco grumped, glaring at the distant dartboard again while he waited for Potter to make a decision.  He briefly wondered if Harry even remembered all their names, but quickly shoved that idea aside.  That would really make Draco hate him, so he’d better wait for proof before overreacting and dumping the rest of his butterbeer over Harry’s head.  Though maybe Draco could get away with doing it just for fun, even if there wasn’t a reason.  The appeal of that thought had nothing to do with the picture it would make, Harry gasping and sopping wet.
“Oh hello dear,” she said in a squeaky voice that sounded as unused as the books around her.  “I’m closing up in a minute, but please look around if you like.”
Greg’s eyes narrowed, glancing at Draco to be sure he’d heard correctly, and Draco nodded in confirmation.  “Well,
He hadn’t known how to find Draco from there, so he’d ended up wandering around the area until he passed by the park he and Draco had visited, and the church that stood next to it had reminded him of a place he’d only heard of.
“It’s still illegal,” Harry groaned, rubbing his temples like that could expel the knowledge of Draco’s illicit activities from his brain.  “I work for the Ministry, I can’t know these things.”
“Because,” Parkinson snapped, waving another of Harry’s chips in his face, “Draco has been sulking for the past five days after your little excursion and I want to know why.”
Draco leaned back, crossing his arms.  “Of course he does.  Weasley’s an imbecile.”  Draco turned his gaze to the rest of the pub, as if looking for a way out of this non-date with Harry.
Draco glanced at him, noting the other’s complete lack of embarrassment.  Damn Potter for not dwelling on Greg’s words like Draco was.  “It went well,” Draco assured him grudgingly.  “Greg didn’t start throwing punches.”
this.”  His voice cracked on the word ‘fix’ and it was taking every ounce of strength Draco had not to cave in to his desire to wrap this man up in his arms.  He hadn’t thought those green eyes could become any more compelling, but the water welling up in them made them positively spellbinding.  “I can’t do this without you,” he admitted quietly, slightly more composed.  “Please, Draco, don’t make me do it alone.”
But how could he focus when he didn’t know when he’d be seeing Draco again, or what they would talk about when they did, or if he could ever kiss those inviting lips in anything other than his imagination….
Bulstrode made no move to stop them or hurry them along, but her hooded eyes followed them to the door.  She was a large woman, only rivaled in size by the Beauxbatons headmistress Madame Maxime.  The dress and apron she wore were heavily stained, and the scowl on her face looked rather permanent.  Perhaps it wasn’t personal after all.  Feeling a twinge of pity, Harry yanked himself from Draco’s grip and jogged back over to Bulstrode, who still watched him like a hawk.
“I’m good,” Connor replied casually, his American accent out of place in the quaint English bookshop.  “I’d be better with a guide.”
“Do you remember?” Potter asked, and Draco snapped to the present.  Potter was grinning as if he wasn’t remembering how Draco had insulted his friend Hagrid and shown what a racist git he was in their very first encounter.
The effect was instantaneous.  Draco’s eyes flashed in anger, then his entire face went blank.  He stood abruptly, nearly knocking his drink over, and swept out of the booth as gracefully and confidently as the late Professor Snape.  Without a word, he began to stride away towards the door.
want to take it further, another dark witch or wizard.  And one of them will be powerful enough to devastate the world again.  And then they will be taken down.  It goes on forever.  Fighting evil wizards won’t solve anything.  If you want to stop this war, you have to fight your battles in the minds of the children.  You have to show them what makes muggles special, the things they can do that wizardkind
The woman smiled back.  “Precisely.”  She then stood, taking out a keychain, and Draco felt rather cold with the thought of having to leave the quaint bookstore.
It took several moments for Draco’s mouth to remember how to form words, but he was finally able to say, “Alright.”
Draco narrowed his eyes, but he didn’t look away, so Harry couldn’t be too disappointed.  “What makes you think that wasn’t the real me?” he asked darkly.  “The one who tortured people, and brought Death Eaters into Hogwarts?”
“Excuse me for a moment,” Draco muttered, slipping off the barstool.  Connor raised his eyebrows, but didn’t protest as his hand slid off Draco’s leg.  Draco tried not to seem too eager to get away.  The owl watched Draco shrewdly as he made his way toward the door, all while those muggle girls were snapping pictures of it with their phones.  This would be so much simpler if he had his wand with him; as it was, he’d left the thing in his bedside drawer, like he did most days when he was spending time with muggles.
Harry felt like he could sing from the rooftops.  He’d spent hours talking with Draco last night – talking, not just yelling – and it had been wonderful.  Awkward and painfully misunderstood at times, but overall, wonderful.
With a sigh, Harry sat up and slumped off his mattress, opting for the chair by his window instead.  He’d sent Hedwig out with letters to Ron and Hermione the previous day, and she had yet to return.  His friends were both staying at the Burrow, a fact that Harry tried desperately hard not to be too jealous about.  Why did they get to be there together, but Harry was forced to hide out with the muggles who hated his guts?
“Right, well, Parkinson,” Harry tried again, “I just wanted to tell you that I’m sorry for my behavior in school.  I shouldn’t have dismissed you so easily just for being a Slytherin, and I should’ve respected you more as a witch.  You’re brilliant, and I never recognized that at Hogwarts.  You deserved more credit, and I know that was hard to get while I was, er, kind of taking all the attention.”
, Potter,” Draco insisted with frustration.  “When you think you’re above something else, you don’t hate them.  You just think they’re worth less than you.  Their lives are worth less than yours.  It just makes sense.”
“Hold on,” Harry shouted over the wind, and Draco only nodded as he slipped onto the Nimbus behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist.  As they lifted into the air, Harry couldn’t tell if the thrill shooting up his spine was from the flight or from the feeling of Draco hugging him from behind.  He could feel the other boy’s chest pressed tightly against his own back, Draco’s face tucked into Harry’s shoulder, and it was doing strange things to Harry’s stomach.
really,” Harry babbled on, trying not to fidget.  “It’s just, I realize that I wasn’t, er, making the best the choices either, when it came to you and the other Slytherins.  So I just – I want to make things right, because….”
Once inside, the walls went from solid wood to crystal clear glass, and the sunlight poured in just as if they were standing outside.  Harry’s mouth was hanging open as he stared wide-eyed out across the rolling green fields, and the several horses grazing in the distance.  “This is magic,” Harry breathed, undoubtedly wondering how so many enchantments could be put on one estate.
Draco swallowed heavily, feeling as if peanut butter was sticking to his mouth.  But he had to ask.  “If the man who killed Tatiana,” Draco began, “came to you today and said he was sorry, that he didn’t believe that way anymore…would that really change anything?  Would who he is now even matter?”
Feeling emblazoned by those words, Harry continued, “Actually, not for that.  I wanted to apologize for how I treated you at school.”
“Puns are not permitted on the premises,” Parkinson admonished.  “And anyway, you should get going if you want to catch Blaise.  He normally leaves for the club about now.”
“You haven’t anyone in mind, have you?” Draco demanded, turning to face him at last.  Potter was looking guiltily into his butterbeer.  “For Merlin’s sake, Potter, no wonder your apologies are so rubbish — you just make them up on the spot, don’t you?”
The earnest question made Draco cold all over.  He never liked to dwell on his past, and that was one of his worst memories, partly because it had been his first real act of evil.  That stunt had nearly caused the death of a Gryffindor girl and the wrath of the Dark Lord.  Of course Potter would conveniently bring that up.
But as soon as he’d gotten several paces away, he heard Ron mention his name, and Harry couldn’t help but hang back, stepping behind a pillar so as not to draw their attention.
“I just wanted to say,” Harry went on, steadier than before, “I’m very sorry for how I behaved at Hogwarts, how I treated you and the other Slytherins.  My friends and I never gave you a chance to prove yourselves, and we were right nasty sometimes.  But honestly,” Harry kept going, and Draco sensed a blunder in the making, “I think you lot were probably meaner to us than we were to you, but all the same, you know, it takes two, as they say.”  Harry nodded solemnly, like he was agreeing with himself.
“And you as well,” Potter replied cheerfully.  He then turned to Draco with a determined expression.  “Malfoy,” he started, “I need your help.”
“I’m not taking you home, Potter, so you’d best spit it out,” Malfoy muttered, as if reading Harry’s mind.
Draco watched Connor’s lips as he smiled cordially at the bartender serving them.  They looked soft.  And Connor was clearly interested.  All Draco had to do was lean over….
Harry shot him a abashed smile to indicate his extreme remorse.  Draco was amazed at the indecency of it all.
“I guess it was all my fault,” Draco went on.  His fists clenched all on their own.  He could still feel the way his wounds had glued themselves to his shirt with the damp, sticky blood that seeped between his fingers, impossible to keep in.  “I’m responsible for almost bleeding out on the floor that day, I’m the one to blame for the scars on my chest.”
“It’s good of you to drop by,” she continued merrily to Potter, ignoring Draco’s glare.  “He has so few friends.”
“Er, Parkinson, nice to see you again,” Harry greeted her, swallowing his previous bite of food nervously.
“We were in different Houses, with different passions,” she went on.  She said the word ‘passions’ like it was a secret between them.  “Our paths never crossed.”
Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.  “You want me to introduce you to Greg?” he echoed slowly.  Of all the things Potter could have said, this was the last thing Draco had expected.
,” he spat.  But he couldn’t manage his usual disgust when Malfoy was looking at him with those wide, fearful eyes.
“Pardon me, ma’am,” Draco said, and the old woman looked up at him with a wan smile.  “Do you mind me asking why this bookstore is called The Dragon’s Lair?”
Draco nodded, both exasperated and in awe of his friend’s suave evasiveness, and stood to give Blaise a quick embrace.
“Oh right!” Harry exclaimed, digging around his jacket pocket for his wallet.  He pulled out £5 and gave it to Malfoy, who looked unwillingly amused.
“And would you stop smiling?” Draco demanded, annoyed when Potter just smiled wider.  “It’s creepy.”
Draco couldn’t be seen in public with him; Harry would embarrass them both.  It would just be awkward.  Harry would realize that Draco was the scum of the earth while he was some sort of Jesus figure, and he would never want to see Draco again.  Draco should write back, to tell him it wouldn’t work, they should stick to apologies and rejections, because that suited them much better than whatever this budding friendship had in store.
Harry stepped towards him, hands half raised like he was going in for a hug.  He dropped his arms when Draco snapped back into the present, flinching violently.  He kept his feet planted though, this time.  He wouldn’t run away.
Harry looked at Dumbledore’s frame again, wondering if there was a spell to summon the subject back to their portrait. A pointed cough startled him and he glanced around to find the source of the noise.
A soft chuckle drew him back to the present. Albus Dumbledore was looking at him, his blue eyes twinkling. “Harsh but effective as always, Severus,” he said lightly.
Harry felt suddenly nervous, like he was a student again getting scolded by his teacher.  “Er, I – I know I’m a bit of a…symbol, but I don’t think – ”
Harry’s feet began moving without him deciding to and he found himself leaving the Leaky Cauldron as fast as he could.  He couldn’t figure out what he was feeling, but his stomach felt tight, and his lungs felt smaller than usual, and his head felt like it was spinning.
“Draco,” Daphne greeted, standing in the doorway with a full champagne glass and her usual smile.  On anyone else it would look kind and friendly, but Draco knew Daphne too well.  Her long blonde hair fluttered prettily in the breeze.  “And Harry,” she added graciously, unfazed by Draco’s unusual choice of companion.  “Please, come in.”
Rosmerta strolled over to the other end of the bar to clean some glasses, waiting for the late afternoon crowd to filter in, and leaving Draco alone with a very awkward Harry Potter.  The silence felt like an itch at the back of Draco’s throat, but before he could think of anything to say, Greg came ambling over to them, and Harry turned his disconcerting grin on the unsuspecting Greg.
Glancing over, Draco registered that Potter was grinning and resisted the urge to grin back, instead opting for a bored and slightly disgruntled grimace.
The pleading look Potter gave him, which made his green eyes seem that much more prominent in his face, was not at all what swayed Draco to turn and lead him down the road.  It was simply because he’d made his point and didn’t fancy standing still in the cold any longer.  Nothing Harry Potter did could persuade Draco to do anything.  Not even batting those sinfully thick lashes.
“Draco,” Blaise said, ambling over to them in a sleek black and green suit, looking pleasantly surprised by their abrupt arrival.  “What brings you here?”  He turned his idle gaze on Potter, who was currently trying to straighten his shirt like he suddenly realized he was underdressed.  “And with baggage?” Blaise added, nonplussed.
Draco snorted, unamused.  “Those are the places that isolate witches and wizards from the muggle community entirely.
The other man’s eyes flitted toward him as they walked side by side, with a considerable gap between them.  “Well,” he said awkwardly, “I was hoping to try again, if you’ll let me.”
“I’m leaving now, Potter, and I don’t want you coming around my work anymore,” Draco heard himself saying, as if from a great distance.  “I’ve moved on, the past is the past, I’m done with it.”  A pause followed, filled with so many possibilities, so many opportunities, so much nothing.  “I’m done with
The stars were hidden behind dark clouds, and between the whipping winds and the torrential downfall, Harry was hard-pressed to see anything even resembling a snow owl in the sky.  The storm just made him feel more pent up.  What he’d give to take his Firebolt out for a ride, even in
He greeted Dr. Finch briefly as he entered the store, and went immediately to the back left corner to sort through books.  Dr. Finch had wanted to re-organize them to reflect subsections of content, so not only were all philosophy books together, but asian philosophy books were together, and books that dealt with philosophy of religion or spirituality went together, and so on.  Lastly, within these groups they had to be sorted alphabetically.  So far, Draco had organized about half the store.  He wasn’t in a hurry though, and neither was Dr. Finch.  He enjoyed the task of looking through the books, and wasn’t keen on running out of things to do in the bookstore.
No, this was stupid.  No more thinking about Gryffindors with hero complexes.  It wasn’t healthy.  In fact, Draco would be happier if Harry never showed up in his life again.
Draco scoffed, not letting himself think too hard about Potter liking him back.  “That’s not a real term.”
“Are you okay?  You look freaked out,” came a voice from behind him, and Draco jumped, cursing himself that he’d forgotten Connor’s existence for a second time that day.
Trying to shake himself from his thoughts, Draco sighed theatrically.  “Believe me, he is.  But also he’s just a complete idiot.”
Draco raised his eyebrows at Harry like he was missing the most obvious fact in the world.  “Potter, Dumbledore
“I, er, don’t know how to….”  Potter trailed off, letting the silence linger.  “That time,” he resumed, more confidently, “when I saw you crying in the bathroom….”
Harry felt an uncomfortable weight settle in his chest.  “That’s awful,” he breathed, thinking of the only other person he knew to receive that punishment.  And Hagrid hadn’t even deserved it.
“Potter,” she snarled, leaning on the table with both hands and crowding into Hermione, who leaned as far as she could into Ron’s side.
Harry slid his hand into Draco’s and pulled them out onto the street again.  It wasn’t much brighter out in Knockturn Alley, but it was empty enough to give a sense of privacy.  When he glanced at Draco’s face, he found his companion was desperately trying to bite back a grin.
Malfoy screwed up his eyes and took a deep breath.  When he opened them, there was a look of determination on his face.  “Potter, the Dark Lord is going to attack this house tonight.  He is going to kill you and anyone here.  There’s not much time.  You need to leave.”
Outside, the storm was as fierce as ever, whipping Harry’s hair into his eyes, but the thought of mounting a broom again, even in such dire circumstances, had him internally whooping for joy.  He was almost free.
“Shut up, Potter,” the other man growled, taking a menacing step towards him.  “You show up at my work — in a muggle area, which you know means I’m trying to
