Crabbe and Goyle snickered from the insult, but Draco had to stop as Hagrid had just come out of his hut holding a tower of crates.
Blaise and Draco just kept running, passing dead bodies as they kept running towards Gryffindor Tower. They both had to make sure Harry, Neville and the others were okay. They didn't talk to one another at all. The death of Pansy hit them hard and they were just petrified. How could someone do something so monstrous?
Harry frowned. What did he mean he was seeing things? He knew very well that Ron was there when he and Draco were inches away from kissing. Just the thought of kissing Draco again sent pleasurable shivers down his spine and it spread some sort of light through his body that he felt as if could chase away his depression. "Ron... Do you accept-" But it was too late for Harry to finish the sentence as Ron had already walked out of the room.
"Merlin." Harry began to move faster inside of Draco, sweat forming on his shoulders, as their eyes locked and Draco tightened his arms around Harry's waist, wanting more and more and more. "Draco," Harry murmured, and he gasped while he tasted Draco's throat, plundering his skin of its sweetness, and leaving the hot wet tingle of his kisses everywhere he touched. Draco gave himself up to the tremors forming deep in him and leaving him in deep, virtuous sounds he never knew he could make. Harry reached down and wrapped his hand around Draco's cock and stroked it frantically, and Draco's vision exploded in light. He contracted around Harry's dick and came, spurting hot liquid over his own stomach and Harry's; grasping Draco like a lifeline, crying out something unintelligible; Harry came too, almost the moment Draco's muscles contracted, and their cries blended together and cut through the night, dissolving at last into gasps and murmurs and moans.
"G-guys," stuttered Neville, hugging the Slytherin girl back. He's not used to girl hugs, and he likes guy hugs better. They are just warmer and more comfortable. "What the hell is happening tonight? The last thing I remember was being..." He swallowed. "Killed. Then I woke up in some hedge maze."
"Mate," said Ron from his bed on the other side of the common room, and Harry hesitantly looked up at him. He's been glancing at Harry every so often when getting dressed and noticed he has just been staring at a particular spot on the bed. "Why are you up so late?"
"Oh, erm..." Harry stood by the door of the bedroom but hesitated when looking at Narcissa and Andromeda. He didn't want to sound rude by not asking them for hugs. "Do you ladies want a hug too?"
Harry blinked again. Then he burst into laughter. David Tennant? Surely Draco could do better at giving himself a fake name than David Tennant, the guy who plays Doctor Who. The legendary first Doctor from the incredible tv series of Doctor Who.
And Ron, even if he dislikes Draco, accepts the fact that his best mate likes the Slytherin. He may not trust Draco as much as Hermione and Harry does, but he'll do everything he can to befriend the snake for Harry.
Hermione sat back down in her seat and crossed her legs over the other. "Good!" she said, glad that is over with and that Harry will go find Dumbledore. "And that is exactly what you should be doing now, Harry."
Draco just raised an eyebrow at her. "'You know'? Pansy... if you're suggesting that Potter and I-."
"Harry, let me," Draco says and when Harry sleepily gets up from on top of him, he pulls the sheets and duvet underneath them down past their knees so they can get in under the blankets and snuggle up close to one another to keep warm. "Much better. Have a goodnight sleep, Harry."
"Honestly, mate. Just say it. Neither one of us will be mad at you."
Harry grinned as he ran out of his professor's office. Where can he go? He decided to check the bottom floor of Hogwarts first, the basement. Mostly stunned bodies and a lot of bloodshed, nothing else. A lot of stunned bodies as he could tell. He sighed and with his wand, he sent a Patronus to Severus so he can take these students to the Funhouse. But he sent around five bodies, with a levitation charm, to the Room of Requirement. All the professors are in costumes, except Snape, and are around Hogwarts somewhere. When they see stunned students, they take their bodies to the Funhouse and lay them down in a room. Harry doesn't know what rooms, but he knows the students will wake at around 10: 15 pm at the max.
"Thanks, 'Mione," Harry whispers to her, hugging back loosely. "I had so much fun."
Harry felt relieved that Ron had found out about what professor Umbridge has been making him do to himself in the detentions. His hand was bleeding from under his shirt. It was nothing he couldn't handle though. Although, he just didn't want anybody to worry about him and well, it was too late for that as he was sure Ron would say something to Hermione too.
Ron sighed and turned his head around to look at him, remembering seeing his mate and Malfoy kiss in the middle of the Great Hall. He then said what's on his mind. "I kissed Blaise," he said. "But it was under a Mistletoe," he added quickly.
Harry squeezed Draco's hands lightly. "No, Draco. Don't apologise. Never apologise."
Harry just sat there in silence, listening to the bird's chirp, watching the lake for any signs of the giant squid, and watching the ripples run up the shore a little. He sat there, even when the task was being set up, waiting until he could start and get the task over and done with, hopefully, without getting killed.
Hermione smiled warmly at her best friend and his love life, even if it hasn't started yet. She believed that someday, it'll come true. She just listened to Harry ramble on and on about the dance he shared with Draco. It was adorable what he was telling her. How he wanted to be with Draco forever, it was just like a Hallmark Movie. A true love story.
"Alrighty then," said Ron and another yawn escaped from his mouth. He knew that if there were dementors present in the castle Dumbledore would ought to know, wouldn't he? How about the other professors? They would know if it too so what was he worrying about?
"I just wanted to go for a walk around the castle," Harry says, and he looks to the left of him at a large castle window overlooking the green mountains in the distance. He walks to it and looks at the scenery below him of the grounds of Hogwarts. He saw students outside playing around, running, or sitting and reading books. The presence of Draco joining him by the window brings a little flutter within and he has an urge to be closer. "Hermione and Ron have been doing their own things. It's fine though. I like my peaceful walks around Hogwarts."
Once Hermione and Harry entered the Great Hall, they searched for a free spot away from Ron. Harry sat in his usual spot, overlooking both the Slytherin and Hufflepuff tables, whereas Hermione sat opposite Harry, only seeing the Ravenclaw table.
"Um... Professor, what are our zodiacs?" Lavender asked whilst raising her eyebrows as she was curious to what the special word meant. She knew of a lot of Divination words, but 'zodiac' was new to her.
Harry rolled over to face Draco with a smile. He could still taste the remains of Draco's semen explosion in his mouth and he wanted to keep it that way no matter how disgusting that sounded. "We really should get down to the Great Hall," he then says as he unbuttons his pyjama top but doesn't take it off. "I don't want Hermione to worry about me." He got up and threw his legs over the side of the bed. "She knows I haven't slept in my own bed for a day; she'd be wondering where I was."
Hermione's hand shot up rapidly.
Harry yawned, rubbed his eyes from sleep and looked up at the angel that lay next to him. "Morning," he said tiredly and could not believe he never had a nightmare during his slumber. Perhaps, it was because of having Draco near him. Yeah, that must be it.
"Do you believe in magic?" Harry asked the snake with a small grin. It was a fake grin, of course. He pondered if snakes could see beyond the soul... "And if I may asssk, what isss your name?"
Lucius rose an eyebrow and looked over at the three Weasleys exiting the castle. "Alright, then," he said, sighing because he hasn't spoken to this family in what feels like decades. "You should start planning my funeral now. Goodbye, my dear family." Draco and his mother laughed at the sarcasm.
Ivy sighed and let them go to class, and wished she were two years younger so she could be in their class. "Bye then!" She then remembered she had a spare instead of class right now. She grinned and thought a trip to the library to read would be quite nice.
And then the next song came on. Ed Sheeran - Photograph. Harry and Draco were swaying to the music, arms wrapped around each other tightly. Harry frowned from the song's sad tone and rests his head back on Draco's shoulder. He then started to tear up. The song brought back so many painful memories from his past and the Dursleys including the abuse, torment, and suicide attempts.
Neither Harry nor Dean liked an angry or irritated Hermione, in fact, nobody did, so they entered the boys dressing rooms. Minutes later, they came out of their stalls all dressed up.
"I guess I was very sleepy and needed some rest," Harry talked in a soft-spoken voice, managing to sluggishly get up off his bed and walked towards the window closest to Ron to look out to the morning sun and everything below him that included trees, the forest, birds flapping around.
Harry and Draco's faces turned bright red at the anonymous comment. Hermione glared at the back of the common room, hoping to find where that voice came from. She looked back at the Gryffindor and Slytherin couple sadly, "I think it's best if you two go somewhere else. I don't want any other comments coming your way, especially if they're rude."
"It's okay, nobody gets it on their first try," Hermione assured her friend with an encouraging smile. Although whenever she tries something for the first time, she always gets it right. It's because she always reads about it first in a book and makes sure she knows the hand gestures of the spell and how to say it correctly. "Try again."
Harry eyed the new screen set up on the side of the Quidditch stadium suspiciously. This was the first game where it was in use. Right now the screen was panning around the stadium seats, with large letters inscribed above it that says, 'Snitch a kiss'. That's right; the kissing cam had come to the wizarding world. To help improve the invention, Dumbledore had the bright idea to add a charm that caused to focus on two people that were in proximity of each other who the most chemistry. Already Hermione and Ron had been zoomed in on along with Neville and Luna. The latter being a surprise for everyone, especially Neville. He didn't seem to mind once his mouth was occupied with Luna's. In fact, one could say he looked positively blissful.
Seamus chuckled at the Slytherin and knew there was something more to that. After all, he now knew Harry and Malfoy have been getting a little heated in bed. It seems like there are only blowjobs involved with Harry and Draco. "Ye mean yer boyfriend?"
Hermione nodded, glanced at Pansy with a smile and looked back to her Professor. "The Confundus Charm is a charm which causes confusion in a person or bewitches an object," she answers proudly. "It appears that there are varying degrees of confusion caused by the spell, from simply tricking a person or thing about a specific incident to confusing a person to the point at which they endanger themselves."
Harry pulled away from the kiss just slightly, his heart skipped a beat as silver eyes opened and stared up into his green eyes. He smiled down at the blonde and bit his lip. "That was incredible...," Was he supposed to say that? Now he began to blush a little.
"Very good, Ms Granger," said Professor McGonagall with a relaxed smile. One thing is for sure, she enjoys the students who know about the spells beforehand. "20 points to Gryffindor! Now, go ahead and practice the spell on these muggle pencil cases."
"And do not call me a celebrity!" Harry snapped at him. He hated being called all these names. "I wish I was just a normal wizard who goes to Hogwarts and has actual birth parent. I'm afraid that I can't have that wish. I have to deal with all these things that I cannot control in my Goddamn life all because of this fucking scar created by fucking Voldemort!"
Well, he wouldn't know how to react to that. Angry? Oh, yeah, for sure! He would not let Malfoy ruin their friendship if that is what Malfoy was going to try to do. He made an oath to watch the Slytherins carefully to make sure they are not up to anything off like love potions that would make everyone delusional so they can take over the school. Whoa! Okay, he knew he was going a bit far, but you got to keep your eyes on your surroundings, right? What was that word that creep of a professor used? Continuous vengeance? No... Constant vengeance? Yeah, that sounds about right... But the last word wasn't right. He knew that... Constant... Constant... Constant vigilance! Yes! Constant Vigilance!
Harry shook his head at Draco's apology and sat down with him, the smell of the foods was delicious, and he couldn't wait to have this delicious looking breakfast. "Don't apologize, Draco. This is magnificent and nothing I've ever experienced."
"Well... Look at the time. It's nearly time to go to our last classes of the day," Draco said rather quickly and decided what good a way to spend the rest of lunch, was with his boyfriend. And it's so the conversation stopped right there before it gets too dangerous. "C'mon Harry, don't want to be late." He got up and dragging Harry by the hand out of the Great Hall with a grin on his face.
"Oh, don't be silly!" Harry said and remembered Hermione looking across the table at Pansy so many times. "Everyone knows those two are meant for each other. Those two need to get together some time, they practically boil their eyes into the back of one another's heads when the other's not looking in class or the Great Hall."
He withdrew his mouth to the sound of Harry begging him not to, but the begging turned to groans of pleasure as he flicked the pointy tip of his tongue over the very end of him, teasing the little seeping slit and sighing his gratitude for the succulent, salty-sweet flavour streaming over his taste buds.
Harry looks at the position Draco's suggesting and smiles a little at the thought of him riding Draco. Merlin's fucking beard. He wants to try that, to fuck himself on Draco. He looks at Draco whose silver eyes are filled with lust just like before Herbology. "We can do that one if you'd like," he says desirously and ruts himself on Draco just that once.
Harry chuckled at what Draco said. At least the Slytherin gets his sleep, not like Harry ever does. "Aww!" he coed in a mock-baby tone and placed a hand over his heart while his other hand helped support the invisibility cloak covering them from the world. "Does poor little Dwayco also want me to tell him a bedtime story and give him a kiss goodnight?"
Draco narrowed his eyes at Pansy, his best friend. At least she was quiet when she admitted how apparently red his own face is. "I know, I can't help it," he said with a dreamy smile over at Harry, and then he checked out his nails to distract himself from Harry, but it was just too hard.
"We're a little thirsty," said Sam with an innocent small smile.
Ivy slid her finger out and then back in at a painfully slow pace. Lavender squirmed and growled under her breath as Ivy continued to finger her. "Ivy..."
Neville nodded with a warm smile although he doubts the Slytherin hates him. "I can live with that," he said happily. Then he jabbed the Slytherin in the chest with his thinger. "Just... do not break his heart! Or I will come after you!"
Harry didn't complain since he didn't want to get into any more trouble, and he doesn't know how to make dinner or what to make. If only he had Dobby here to help him. He knew how to make food. Every house-elf does. But what angered him was how his Aunt mentioned Draco in such a disgusted tone. When Aunt Petunia left the kitchen, Harry thought about what to make. What he needed was a recipe book which he knows where one is. In one of the top drawers of the kitchen cupboards which he looked to find immediately.
He couldn't exactly bob up and down, but he tried to. Harry's hands found their way under the table and in Draco's hair, gripping tightly as Draco flicked his tongue and massaged under the head of Harry's cock, and his head moved back and forth when swallowing him whole. The Slytherin kept the gentle suck for what seemed like forever, but was probably only two or three minutes, and he was listening to his boyfriend's beautiful moans and sighs coming from above him.
Draco shrugged and looked back at Harry, giving him a smile. Of course, he would love to find out if this were the room he wants to see. Anything Slytherin he just needs to see. "Shall we find out?" Harry nodded and opening the door by the handle. Obviously, it didn't work.
"Nope," Pansy said, smirking as she shook her head. "Payback, Dray!" She opened one of the bottles and tipped it upside down, getting ready to squeeze it in case Draco comes too close to her. "Just one squeeze and I will smell the sweet scent of revenge!"
Harry got interrupted by Ron and their conversation which he was sitting up and wiping his eyes from sleep. "Harry, we have a long walk ahead of us tomorrow," he told his best mate sleepily, and his eyes were half-open. "Get some sleep."
"Harry, can I talk to you for a moment?" Cedric Diggory, the 6th year Hufflepuff, stood at the bottom of the steps outside the stadium, looking up at Harry.
Pansy still glared at Draco, not knowing if she should believe him or not. She stared into those eyes she knows so well and did, in fact, see the truth. She sighed, regretting even thinking Draco would say such things. "Alright, I believe you."
"Yes, how very exciting! It will be on a Saturday after the first task, just two months from now," the headmaster said, giving big a smile with twinkling blue eyes. "Your parents already know of the dates as they were sent out when the term started. You are all required to wear dress robes. That is all."
"I guess so," said Harry with a shrug. He knew he shouldn't have said anything because it would just lead to more questions. "What did Snape want to talk to you about after class?" He added more questions just so he gets answers about things.
The professor got up from her desk and she nodded at Hermione to listen. "Sure!" she said as she walked over to Harry's desk. The professor picked up Harry's parchment and scanned over it and liked what she's seeing. "Excellent work, Mr Potter. If you'd like, you can read page 230 in your textbooks since that's what we'll be doing in the next lesson."
Draco pouted at him; he was only acting anyway. But how dare his father take away his Harry Potter! "No Potter?! What? Why!"
"Right, of course," Harry said and reached for his wand from in his robe and cast a "Tempus!" The time showed that it was near dinnertime. "Well, if we want to get dinner then we should do it now," he suggested gently. "Then as we finish early, we can come back here to start what we were going to do."
Neville crossed his arms on his chest. "Name's not Longbottom, remember?" he said with a grin, but he really didn't mind being called his last name. He prefers his first name though. "Also, that's okay. Ask him out when you feel comfortable."
In the Slytherin common room, everyone who was under the age of 14 was removed from the common room and ushered to their dormitories by Snape and the Prefects, and he moved all the furniture to the side so there was enough room for the dancing that would be taking place.
"No," Harry said and shook his head slowly, not wanting to talk about the task right now. That was not on his mind and was the least of his problems right now. He just didn't want anything to do with the bloody task. Apparently, these tasks were terrific and difficult? Good. Perhaps he can die easily then.
Pansy said the Password to the Slytherin Common room and entered without hesitation. Draco didn't know how long it had taken Pansy, Ivy and himself to get down to the dungeons. It felt like it was just a matter of seconds. Draco and Ivy entered the Slytherin common room behind Pansy.
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
"Oh, look! Did Draco just walk past the compartment!" Ginny then asked quickly, wanting Harry to realise he had been heard spitting out his love confession by Draco. She saw Draco shake his head at her in disappointment and disappear from her sight.
"Yess," said Serpentine with a nod. "Albusss and I have met a few timesss on sssome of hisss tripsss. I have not ssseen him for centuriesss though."
Draco smiled and gave a little wriggle with his fingers as a goodbye, and it made Harry's cheeks glow with a little blush. "Bye, Harry and thanks again!" Harry gave his own wave goodbye and flew off down to the Quidditch locker rooms to get changed.
Harry smiled at the centaur's warm greetings. Odd, but nice greetings. "Hello Firenze, it's so good seeing you too."
Draco smiled down to the floor at nothing and nodded. “I enjoyed it very much, father.” He looked behind him at Harry, who was walking towards the Weasleys.
"Yes, Aunt Petunia," Harry says and gets "rewarded" by Dudley farting in front of him. Harry winces and moves to the other side of the car, behind his auntie. He frowns and looks out the window as the car starts and Petunia starts driving to the shopping centre.
Fred chuckled at that thought. "Dumbledore, a dancer?" he asked in disbelief. Though the man when he was younger could have been a dancer and nobody would have known it. "More like Dumbledance." Harry laughed at the same thought.
Draco felt his heart flutter for a moment. His cheeks warm up and he leaned over and kissed Harry on the cheek. "That so sweet of you to say, my lovely Gryffindor boyfriend," he said sweetly with a gentle smile.
"What's wrong with me? What is wrong with you!" Draco snapped; his arms folded on his chest as he leaned against the door. He frowned a little, hoping Harry was okay and that the scars will heal. "I thought you weren't hurt that bad."
Lavender frowned at the news. She wanted to take one home with her, so she has another animal to add to her collection of pets. She already had a lot of muggle animals such as bunnies, hamsters, llamas, and horses. The other animals she has are Pygmy Puffs and a Crup.
Harry nudged Draco on the arm, shaking his head at Draco's playfulness. This is serious to him. "Not whatever," he said, a little unimpressed with his boyfriend's behaviour. "His name is Neville." He cannot believe he has to repeat himself.
Harry walks into a large rectangular room and the first thing he saw is the three tall arched glass windows which were looking out into the Black Lake on the far side of the room. He didn't see any Merfolk, fishes, or the Giant Squid swim by though. The windows appear to have their own dark green curtains hanging down and just touching the floor.
Draco took a step backwards, feeling a little anxious about these three Gryffindors. "Of course, I would never hurt Harry!" he said in a near snappish tone. All he wants to do is find Harry and make sure he's okay. "You all should know that."
"Well done, Ms Granger. 20 points to Gryffindor!"
They worked silently next to each other and finished the re-potting. Harry was going over the entire conversation in his head. What did Draco care that Ron was talking to him again? He planted the final sapling and gave it to Draco, which when Draco reached his hand towards the pot their hands touched, and they looked each other in the eye. "Do what you want to me, Draco," he told him and gave a quick pat to the Slytherin's hand. "But don't fight my friends."
The professor just nodded at his student and got back to reading without saying a word. He trusts them to not misbehave or use the wrong type of spells in his classroom.
Harry looked around in satisfaction at the member with as of the D.A. as they tried to produce Patronuses. Half the group had already been able to at least produce a silver mist and a few had actually produced a corporeal one, Cho, Fred and George, Hermione and Ron.
Draco nodded, thinking the same as Harry. He really did love spending time with Harry as the boy is just completely amazing. "Yeah, it really was." He couldn't help but dreamily look at him, like he's staring at some angel. An angel which his green eyes shine in the sunshine, and hair, although messy, a beautiful black colour.
Harry stared at the black and red picnic blanket. But the thing that made this picnic even more romantic was the garden they were in. But, where were they? What garden were they in? This looked nothing like the London gardens. Then he noticed the large historic structure just a few thirty meters, by his calculations, away from them. It was Malfoy Manor.
Draco didn't know if Harry was lying or not, so he just let it be for now. If he wants this friendship to build, he rather it be with no lying. He doesn't know what Gryffindor friendships are like, and if there's lying involved which actually is a little disappointing. He really disliked seeing Harry look so...numb and dead to the world. The dull look in his eyes was so familiar, but he just could not decipher where he's seen it from. He only hoped Harry was telling the truth and that he really was well. "Okay, but if you need to talk about anything to me...Anything I'm always here for you," he assured him with a soft smile. "You know that, right?"
“You mean people don’t believe his stories?” Harry asks him. He was curious at why someone would write stories about themselves and claim that the story is true. It was just unbelievable.
He remembered that there weren't only Hogwarts students in the castle, there had been Durmstrang and Beauxbaton students around Hogwarts. Harry just pushed the thought of having not one, but two other schools in Hogwarts because he had intense social anxiety. He hated his anxiety because it kind of stopped him from doing a lot of things. A lot of very harmful things might he add.
Harry just nods, wondering what kind of gossip the Slytherin's hear about. Was it gossip that would have ruined someone's life if it were humiliating or just good gossip like if two people have started dating? How he wishes this blonde Slytherin can be his, but he knows about Ivy. He still has a disliking for her. He doesn't understand why he gets so worked up when he sees her with Draco. It's just... He wants to be the one next to Draco, holding hands, hugging... kissing.
Ron gulped. He looked to the side, a tear falling down his face at the sight of Neville, leaning against the wall with blood gushing out of his chest. His fellow Gryffindor sank down to the floor, seated with his back against the wall. But another figure made itself clear. It was some sort of cloaked figure with a weird long white mask. The cloaked figure had done this to his mates.
"Someone's in love," Parvati teased her best friend with a smile. Harry forced a laugh at that true fact, and Lavender started laughing back.
"What?" Ron asked as he looked over at Harry, but Harry, Ivy and Draco were already getting up to go somewhere. He didn't want to miss out on anything fun, and he wanted Blaise to come too. "Wait for us!" He yelled and got up, grabbing Blaise by the arm while ignoring the Italian's "WhOAh!" and caught up with them.
Harry shook his head and looked up at Draco with a small smile, knowing Hermione won't be telling a thing. All she would do is bombard him with questions about his lunch with Draco. "No, she'd never tell anyone. Even if I ask her to tell someone, she still won't tell anyone."
"Dobby asks of Mister Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy to do that elsewhere and not in the kitchens where Dobby and all Dobby's house-elf friends are working," the house-elf requests them. "Enjoy the meal. Dobby must go and clean dishes."
Cedric saw that Harry looked quite uncomfortable, talking about Draco like this. "Is there anything in particular that you want to talk to me about, Harry?" he asked with his calm tone and a reassuring smile.
Draco had to agree with the Weaselette there. What about Cho? He knows what happened on that week before Christmas. It doesn't take long until information starts to spread in Hogwarts.
"Hi Harry!" Ron said cheerfully when holding up his best mates' trunk, and Harry looks at him and fakes a smile. But then he sees the bruise on Harry's jaw, and focusses his eyes a little to look at it more. He wasn't the only one who spots the bruise as Fred and George both go up to Harry and inspects the bruise.
Harry wiped the tears from his face with his sleeve. Draco saw a glimpse of red from Harry's wrist and felt so sad. Who could treat someone so innocent like that?! He felt anger boil through his veins. If he gets his hands on this Dursley family, he swears he will make their life a living hell!
"Oh please, give us the information!" Hermione asked her in a pleasing tone. She'd like something to embarrass both boys with in the future.
"I don't know, mate," said Neville with a shrug, fiddling with the hem of his blue plaid pyjama shirt. He doesn't know if he should be worried about this or if someone's messing around in McGonagall's office again.
Harry was just walking to the Willow tree from the Herbology greenhouses and he pushed his way through the elongated branches. Right as he came through the leaves, he was blindfolded by two hands and he felt warm lips on his cheeks which sent warmth all through his body. It was Draco as he could tell from the citrus scent that filled his nostrils, but he also smelt fresh food from nearby. "Draco..."
Harry gave a small but fake smile and cupped his hand over his cheek the boy kissed. It lingered there, like if you stuck a lollipop to your skin but it was a nice feeling. He felt bad for liking the kiss. Was it acceptable to like guys? Harry didn't know but he hoped it was. But even if it weren't, he would just feel worse about himself. His self-esteem lowers every day.
"What makes you think there'll be around two?" Draco asked quite sharply, his eyebrows raised.
Ivy turned around to face the Gryffindor. She was surprised to see Harry up this early. "Hello, Harry," she said with a downturned expression, and she was leaning against the rails. She actually prefered to be alone right now so she doesn't get caught doing harmful things to herself.
Draco nearly cackled from hearing that reply. OoOOoooo... The Mistletoe did it.
"I have absolutely no idea what you just said, Draco," Harry says sweetly but he knows his blonde boyfriend must have complimented him by speaking French. "You know I don't speak any other language besides English. Do you mind saying that in English for me please?" He gave him a little wink and leaned down to kiss his forehead.
"Hey, no doing that!" Draco snapped at her, but he couldn't be angry at Ivy. He didn't want to get angry because that's how Ivy gets upsets and asks him what she had done. "Vous savez qui j'aurais préféré me tordre le nez." ("You know who I would rather have boop my nose.")
Harry actually smiled at Draco. True smiling was quite rare for him as he would always use fake smiles but for Draco, it seemed he could give him real ones. "Two can play that game," he said boldly as he pointed his wand at Draco. "Anteoculatia!"
Draco watched as Harry left the Great Hall with Granger. His heart was hammering hard against his chest because of Harry and that he couldn't even hear what Pansy and Ivy were shouting from the blood rushing all through his body. Draco forgot that he zoned out and had been staring at Harry's ass.
When Draco dug his fingers into Harry's buttocks, the split-second pain wrenched Harry's orgasm from his grasp and it barrelled out of him, flooding Draco's hole with an incredible volume of hot, slippery come.
"Goodbye, Harry." With a wink, Draco turned around and left the Gryffindor's alone when walking out the front door to the apparition area.
"Shay and I never started anything sexual until a month after our first date," Dean said and smiled over at his boyfriend, remembering the night very well. "We did the do when we both were ready. There's nothing to worry about, Harry. Whenever you're ready, go find Draco and tell him you want to have the best time of your life with him."
"I remember when I tried getting on the Hippogriff, and of course, I knew I made a mistake," said Draco with a smile. Then he watched the Hippogriff furtively. "I was a little jealous of Harry because of how incredible he was at flying that beast, so yeah. It shows you right there, on this weird box looking thing of what happened that day."
They slowly get up from the couch though they still felt the last inside of them, intertwined their hands and headed out of the Slytherin common room. But before they made it to the secret entrance, Harry pinned Draco to the wall. Harry restrained Draco's hands to the wall, just above his shoulders. He smiled at the powerless boy in front of him and kissed him hard.
Draco kept up the rhythmic thrusting movements, loving the feel of Harry's hot and wet mouth on his prick. Before he knew it, the tension building in his gut was becoming warmer and he knew he would come soon.
“Draco sssaysss that you have a really cool name, and I think ssso too, obviousssly! Alssso, Draco and I have to depart asss dinner isss almossst ready. SSSorry.”
"It's just... the Tournament is in two days," Draco said and looked down at his hand twined with Harry's, and Harry nodded. "And then after the final tournament, there is only a week left of school."
"It's alright," Draco said and looked out the window at the clear blue sky. The sky was never this clear in the United Kingdom. "Anyway." He looked back into her eyes, "Where am I?"
"Good Morning, Harry," Hermione said while she dished herself a bowl of warm porridge. She had a new book with her this morning: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. And she had her purple bookmark in one of the pages closest to the front cover.
Lavender smiled up at Ivy and caressed her arms gently. Her arms then trailed to Ivy's bras. She sat up, looking deep into beautiful ocean blue eyes, and reached behind the girl to unlatch the bra straps. As the last clip was undone, the Slytherin's black bra slid off onto Lavender's stomach. She gaped at the sight of another girl's boobs other than her own. She reached up and fondled them, squeezing lightly, and poking them gently. All she could say was how gorgeous they were.
Harry let out a small smile at the Weasleys; it was actually nice to see a loving family for once. Yes, the Dursley's gave each other love, but not as much as the Weasleys do. This family was just a full-on love giving family.
"Stories, about me?" Draco asked and he looked overly surprised, proud, and amused.
Draco eventually opened his eyes. He woke up earlier when Harry started kissing his jaw and for real, it was making his pants tighten. He enjoyed it though, it's why he made it seem like he was still asleep. "I'm awake, I'm awake," he says and sits up, feeling Harry on top of him. Merlin... "What's the time? I feel like we've been asleep for hours."
Harry washed off his blade under the icy cold water from the taps and put it back in his mint tin, spelling it shut. He washed off his arm, watching as the sink turned a light red as his blood ran down his arms into the sink. Once he finished washing off his arm, he rolled down his sleeve and placed the mint tin back in the cupboard and closed it. He walked back down to the Common Room and back up the stairs into his dorm room. He stumbled into bed, raised the covers over him and fell asleep as his head hit the pillow.
Seamus tried helping Cecelia, but the Nun threw Seamus across the room without even touching him. She made him land in a chair, just so she doesn't actually hurt him. She didn't want to hurt anybody, but she will just to make everything look real.
Harry blushed at the compliment as well as having Draco wipe his thumb over his lips made his heartbeat rapidly. Especially when Draco used his saliva to wipe over his lip. "T-Thanks, Draco," he said a little nervously and rubbed his hands down his pants. "Um-, y-you have really pretty lips." If it was possible, his blush deepened as he just admitted something that he shouldn't have.
"There's your prince, Harry," said Fred and gave Harry a little tap on the arm with the back of his hand. "You better go after him before someone else does. And of course, we will be right behind you when you ask him."
"Unless you want to start moaning out loud for the entire train to hear, then sure, go ahead," Draco said sarcastically, deepening the kiss. He wouldn't mind that actually and they’ve done it before. He has been craving Harry's hot sexy body again after that awful boring Prefect duty.
Harry felt his heartbeat accelerate and when Draco's face was just an inch away from his face, he abruptly closes his eyes. Draco felt the same, although his heart has been beating rapidly ever since his and Harry's first kiss. And when he saw Harry close his eyes, he smiled. And finally, the feelings they had for each other was sealed as their lips meet. They both felt happy and complete.
Hermione nodded her head, and she noticed the distant stare from Harry over her shoulder. She knew who her best friend was staring at and had a feeling he was thinking about the blonde Slytherin too. "Yes, and I think Pansy also saw it too."
"WHAT?", they both screamed in utter confusion. They whipped their heads to stare at each other, eyes still wide and faces red.
George laughed at these predictions Harry came up with and thought of a few he could actually use. "A positive prediction would be that you'll pass Divination by doing your very hardest," he suggested, grinning. "That's one. Oh, and that you'll be taking Draco to the Yule Ball if you ask him quickly."
Dean finally caught up to Ginny, who he found hiding behind a statue of a knight. Jesus, this girl was a terrible hider. He sneaks attacked her by jumping in front of her with his bloody knife at her throat. Ginny screamed, but Dean quickly stabbed her in the chest, and she dropped to the floor, lifeless.
Draco looked down at his best friend like she had gone mad and snorted. "Wow, that's very thoughtful," he said and gave her a playful nudge in the arm for a tease. "I think you're turning into a Hufflepuff, Pansy."
Harry wished he knew how to make a movie. This could be a great thriller movie. 'Hogwarts Massacre'. "Now, who wants to start pranking!" he asked everyone loudly.
"Thank you, Draco," Harry said with a small smile, his cheeks still felt warm from blushing so much. What an interesting morning this has been after crashing into none other than Draco. "Same to you!"
Harry just smiled at the two. That smile turned into a mischief one as he said, "You know... Malfoy's ass-"
Ron nodded again, looking at the mess of hair Harry had. He ran a hand through it and smirked, feeling how messy and curly it was. It wasn't tangly or had knots in it which he thought his mate's hair would feel like. In fact, this was his first time feeling his mate's hair. He was thinking of a good hairstyle to do for his best mate. "Okay, but firstly, have you finished getting dressed?"
Harry tried to not let out a laugh, but he failed. These conversations keep getting more amusing every single day. "Who are you and what have you done to Draco Malfoy?"
Harry was about to say something to tease Draco more but realized that they were already in the dungeons at the entrance to the Slytherin common room. He remembered the memory, following Draco into the common room as Crabbe and Goyle as Ron.
Harry smiled a bit and grabbed another small piece of toast from the plate. He actually liked doing this. He then fed the next piece to Draco and watched as the blonde ate it. He watched those soft cheek muscles move as he ate, and that sharp jawbone moves up and down.
"Just woke up," Harry lied since he was up all night. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes and feeling a familiar burning sensation from his left arm. He tried to ignore the pain, but it was too powerful. He felt numb, the good numb, the emotionless numb from his cuts. He sluggishly grabbed his glasses from the bedside table and put them on.
"Oh, I'm-" was all Harry managed to choke out before the first jet of hot, salty come coated the back of Draco's throat. "Draco!" Harry bellowed, pushing him that last fraction of an inch so that he fell headlong over his own edge and came himself, grinding his enclosed bulge into his grasping hand frantically, as though the motion could make him orgasm any harder.
"That's why I'm asking you, Harry-kins," George said and span Harry around in the dance, grinning a little at how well his favourite little non-blooded brother is doing at dancing. It appears his twin has taught Harry well. Maybe he can teach Harry a little something too.
Ivy rolled her eyes at him but know he was only concerned about her health. "Fine, I'll eat," she said, and she really will if it's concerning him. She just doesn't like the taste of food anymore. Even ice cream tastes like ashes. "Not my fault my mother doesn't feed me."
Draco looked down at the table, admiring all the small outlines of carvings students have made in the past. "You know I'd never hurt her, not in the state she's in. Not ever.," he told her in a flat voice and knew how hard it was to keep her blades hidden from her. "Have you hidden her stabby's in places she'd never find, even if she is in the 6th year?"
"Great," said Harry. "And John, Chase, Florence, Lyra and Jake, you're in the funhouse at your stations. The rest of you spread out throughout Hogwarts and scare as many students as you can. Now let's go!"
"There's no time for explanations Professor, we have to get Ivy to Madam Pomfrey immediately!" Harry said quickly and his expression crossed with worry and exhaustion. It was tiring carrying a body with his magic. It was slowly draining him.
Harry remembered the hat saying the exact same thing to him. He chuckled at the antler horns on top of Draco's head and he had to admit that they kind of suit him and made him look... handsomely adorable. "The antlers suit you; you know?" he said as he felt his face redden with a blush that snuck up from his neck.
"Anyway, as I got older, she began acting more..." Ivy had to stop there and blink back tears that were welling up in her eyes. "She was more aggressive toward me. She began to hit me, didn't feed me enough, lock me in small spaces for days without food or water, locked me out of the house sometimes. It all just got worse the older I got but I've been in the muggle world a lot, so I know my way round to hotels and restaurants if I need it."
One day Harry felt like he had literally nothing fun to do, (even though he liked reading) whilst living with the Dursleys. He could go for a walk to just head into town, but he had no money to buy a coffee or lunch. He could have sat outside in the gardens, but no, he was just feeling too depressed to do anything he'd like to do. So, he just stayed in his room, doing nothing unless Aunt Petunia wanted him to do something productive.
"No, I-Uh- Um-," Harry stutters and rubs at his neck, cursing himself for stuttering in front of this older bloke who would know a lot about relationships and dating. "I wish but no, we're... Uh... I kissed him, but it was before the first task. Oh, and we sort of kissed each other this morning and can you please not tell anyone..."
Harry watched as Draco finished his dinner in under nine minutes. Is that even possible or is he just a slow eater? Raising an eyebrow in amusement, he asked, "How do you finish a meal that fast? You're like a damn cheetah."
Harry's smile brightened, he looked at his friends and said, "I am never washing my face again."
"Are ye kidding me?" Seamus then asked his dormmate with raised eyebrows, clearly surprised at the information he's being fed. When Harry didn't say anything but shake his head, he then had to believe him. "That's incredible! How long have ye and Draco been doing that for?"
"Yes, we will see each other soon," Draco says with a near dreamy-like smile towards the Gryffindor. When Harry turns around to leave, Draco grabs his books from his father and proceeds to the apparition point in Diagon Alley.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione said dreamily with a soft smile and a hand over her heart. It's the most romantic thing she's ever heard of. "That all sounds so romantic. Have anything else to tell me?"
Joslyn sighed sadly and gave a small frown. Draco came over to her and gave her a big hug. "Thank you for taking care of me, Jos," he said appreciatively, smiling at her as she pulled out of the hug.
“Oh, that makesss senssse,”
"I have to agree with you there, Divination is worthless," Draco says, nodding in agreement with him. He doesn't even recall getting a singular thing right in Divination. Apparently, you had to believe in Divination to be able to do it. "Hope you get to your class on time!"
"Mm-hmm... You forgot to take her when you left 12 Grimmauld place before Christmas," Hermione said disappointedly, crossing her arms over her chest to show how pissed she was. "You were lucky we had the integrity to look after her."
Draco smelt the pine in Harry's shampoo and conditioner. Although, he smelt banana flavoured gel in his hair. Weasley! he thought and scowled. Draco ignored the thought of Ronald Weasley putting hair Gel in his boyfriend's hair. He continued to dance slowly with Harry, and he squeezed Harry's hand, feeling a little squeeze back from Harry.
Hermione was adding strawberries to her porridge, a little confused at what the boys were talking about. She was confused at herself as she knows she hardly gets confused unless she's missing something important.
"I know, my Dragon," Narcissa said kindly. She waved her hand elegantly into the air, "I'll be as quick as a bee."
Draco looked to the ground, thinking about this option. He's been to plenty of bars, wizarding bars. Just not any muggle ones. "Didn't you say it was a muggle bar?" Pansy nodded. He would actually like to try out this muggle bar and see how various it is from the wizarding ones. "Sure," he said, nodding as he began to think about this muggle bar.
"It was on the cheek," Draco said and to his disappointment, both girls groaned and sank back into their seats with long sighs. "What? It's what I could only do! I couldn't just go up to him, kiss him, then walk off."
George turned his head around and gave Harry a smile. But Harry could see beyond the mask, as he now knows about the particular mask George's wearing every day.
"Malfoy's don't cry," Draco mumbled while ignoring Harry's heroic speech. Well, he definitely heard everything the Gryffindor said, and it really calmed him down. He looks down at the dark rocky ground while wiping his eyes with his sleeves.
"Sure, blame it on the mistletoe," Ginny said, rolling her eyes at him.
Harry returned the smile, especially when being called by his first name. He gave his attention back to the massive shadow figure he saw floating around some trees and pointed his wand at it. "EVERTE STATUM!" he shouted, watching as an orange beam of light flew out of his wand and hit the creature. He quickly moved back to the tree with Draco and panted.
And then it came to him; Harry hadn't come. How the hell had he managed that? Given that they were both ways past any kind of stopping point, Draco was astounded.
Draco smiled down at Potter, feeling his cheeks burn a deeper shade of red. Potter would kiss him again? That was exciting to hear, and he would like to kiss him again too. "Yeah, it was," he said, biting his lip to stop him from sounding dreamy. "Aren't you with Weaslette though?"
Ron saw his best mate becoming distracted with who knows what and nudged him on the arm. Unfortunately, Harry's freshly cuts were where he touched him, but he didn't know. "Harry?" he whispered softly. "You are going to help me, right?"
Harry thought the other wizard would hex him, and he wouldn't have cared. He let the boy named Justin heal him, feeling the warm calming magic overwhelm his senses. "You've kept this from Dudley and his friends all this time? And aren't you Dudley's age?"
He found Blaise up in the boy's dormitory just meditating on his bed. In the past he always wondered what the point to meditating was, and he now knows its use is to clear the mind and relax the body. It was an odd thing to do but helpful when there's a test coming up.
Draco felt a little irritated that Finnegan pushed Harry out of the way, instead of lightly tapping him on the shoulder to get him to move or to nicely ask him to move out the way. But what he was a little confused about was the game Harry mentioned. "What's spin the bottle?"
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry, he opened his mouth to say something but closed it as he had nothing to say. He just couldn't say anything as there's just nothing to say about the Hufflepuff house.
Draco nodded slightly. He just hated journalists who work for Witch Weekly. "Yeah, it's just..." He tried but hoped to Merlin that Harry wouldn't hate him for what he's about to admit. "That Rita lady came by the other day and asked us Slytherins about you."
The Weasleys were like a real family to Harry and it made him a little grateful. They feed him right, treated him like he was a part of their family and showed Harry that they care and appreciate his existence. Not like the Dursleys ever did, and how miserable and alone they made him feel. He would still scratch at his cuts from time to time when he is spiralling deeper into his mental state. He didn't care about who was looking because it would just seem like an everyday gesture. But still, he always found ways to cut when the Weasleys weren't around. He mostly cut at night when they were all asleep so he could relieve his emotional pain. Except for one night.
Joslyn accidentally let out a loud 'REEEE' and shouted, "DRARRY IS REAL, MUTHAFUKAZ!" Hermione scolded her for swearing so she apologized. But like... Drarry!
Harry stared at the blade, remembering the last time he used it. Merlin, that was a rough day. But every day's a rough day for him. Harry rolled up his sleeve past his elbow and took in the last scars he had made previously during the Holidays. He lowered the blade down to his arm and felt the tingle of the sharp cold blade. Without consciously making a decision, he sliced the blade across his skin. He hissed in pain but felt overwhelmed as the sudden feeling of anxiety had disappeared from inside him.
Harry nodded slowly, still looking at the ground with a blank expression. "Yeah, I'm fine. Another lie it was, and he's not too happy about it. He wished he could tell Draco but if he does, he just knows Draco will throw him to the side of the footpath and walk away after calling him a freak.
"Let's just lay here for a short while and then go get lunch in the kitchens," Harry said as he felt that familiar weird feeling of his body sending his brain happy messages from the sex he and Draco had. The incredible sex, might he add. He wondered if sex is addicting, like a drug or cigarettes.
"I love you too, Draco," said Harry and he leaned up, capturing Draco's lips in a soft kiss. Everything around them was forgotten. The Masquerade Ball. The garden they were in. The students dancing inside the ball. The music played in the background. Just everything was forgotten except for each other, and they wanted to give each other as much love as they possibly could. After, Harry pressed his forehead to Draco's. "Shall we head back inside?"
Hermione nodded, thinking she knows exactly how Harry felt because she also wanted to read the last chapters of 'The Maze Runner'. She was nearly finished and had about five more chapters to go. Then after that, she will start some of the Agatha Christie novels.
"I promise," Harry assured him with a nod. He distractedly took a couple of sips of his Hot Cocoa and stared ahead of him at a white pillow. If only it had a little tinge of blonde to it. Okay, what the fuck was he thinking?
Goyle looked up at his blonde friend sitting on the tree. He was shocked and confused right now due to the fact that Draco called Potter his first name. What happened to 'Potter' this and 'Potter' that? But most importantly, what happened to Draco. "Why're you calling him 'Harry' now?"
He then looks down at the cock which is flat against Harry's stomach and his pulse drummed across his entire body at the sight he was seeing. Harry was perfect. At least six and a half, if not seven inches. He's never seen anyone's cock but his own. So, this was new to him. And this was Harry's cock which was slightly covered in what looks like a sticky white fluid, and same was his black boxers. "Merlin, Harry Potter," he whispers and looks back up and sees that Harry's cheeks weren't just pink, they were a raw, burning red and his eyes were so shiny, it was hard to see where the pupil ended, and the iris began. "You're beautiful." He crawls forward and presses a quick and gentle kiss to Harry's parted lips. He then crawls back down so he has a view of Harry's dick again, and he leans down and nuzzles his nose on Harry's groin with the little black hairs.
"Do you want to though?" Draco asked carefully as he had to ask just in case Harry didn't want to, for whatever reason. He didn't want to force him or anything. What if he had claustrophobia? Or a fear of mazes? But the look of curiousness Harry gave the maze told him that Harry isn't scared of mazes.
Harry sighed; might as well tell her or she'll become more curious about whose been sending him letters throughout the year. "Yes, it is from Sirius," he said with a little nod and shows her the envelope. "I've been talking to him since the start of school, just about how I'm doing and the tasks and about a someone you know and my liking for him."
And while Ron fell asleep on the couch, Harry was still up in the dormitory laying on his back on his bed while looking up at the canopy above him. He was wondering what Draco was up to, and where he could be. Possibly the Slytherin common room or dormitory, obviously! He sighed and rolled onto his side, staring out the window closest to Neville's bed. The snow was falling lightly across the grounds, and there were only a few birds flapping around happily in the sky.
"It was hot, that's how it was Potter," Draco said softly, not sounding insulting for once in his lifetime. He didn't want to sound insulting to Potter at all. That Malfoy is gone and was last years problem.
Harry couldn't comprehend who said that. All he knows is that Dudley and Aunt Petunia don't sound like that at all. His eyes were trying to scan the room and what was around him, but he could only see blurry people around him.
Every student in the room said, "Good afternoon, Professor."
"Pansy wouldn't have minded if you were to choose Harry over her to go to the ball you know," Ivy said and she flashed him a smile which didn't reach her eyes at all. Draco better have known this. "Wouldn't you, Pansy?"
Ivy smiled, showing her fangs. She shut her lips together then smiled again, her fangs had gone. "It's a little bit of both," she said with a shrug, her hands gripping onto the bed's mattress. "But yes, I can take them out whenever I want to and when I smell blood they too come out. I learn to control my powers when I was around eight years old. My mother taught me but when she had work she hired an actual full blooded vampire to teach me. He taught me everything I needed to know and how to control it all by the time I turned eight."
“Let’s just say that the rivalry between us has faded and become something more,” said Harry coyly as he looked beside him into Draco’s silver eyes, and the blonde Slytherin looked right back at him.
Harry froze, looked to his side and fount his cousin staring at him with disgust and... He couldn't see what that other emotion was, and he didn't care. Without a care, he shoved the pills in his mouth and tried swallowing them all. Of course, they all didn't go down easy and in a couple of seconds, everything started to spin and he felt some gross frothy liquid start coming up his throat.
He rolled his sleeves up past his elbows and glanced at his pale, scarred arm. Softly he was pressing the hard edge on his sensitive skin before applying weight to the blade and slitting the flesh between his wrists. Dark red blood rose like crimson raindrops to the cut, running over his hand and onto the floor. The pain was satisfying, and he needed it, as though Ron had experienced the discomfort. For a couple of moments, he was relieved with anything from his pain. And as the blood was drying and the wound began to form Harry had his guilt relieved, he didn't think it would last long but it was something.
"Bloody hell!" said Ron, his eyes wide with fear.
Fred and George looked at each other and smirked, not thinking that they would be asked to be Harry's Yule Ball partner ever. "Freddo here is free," said George, pointing to his twin beside him. "I'm going with a Hufflepuff guy named Steven."
Blood ran down Cecelia's neck slowly as the nun kept eating at her neck. Cecelia rolled her eyes to the back of her head, moaning in pain as her blood dripped down to her feet.
Draco Malfoy was worried. Utterly worried. Harry had been looking much more depressed and duller for the last few days. It was more than how Harry would normally be, duller than he'd ever seen him. He didn't even think Ron and Hermione even saw the difference in Harry. Draco knew there were now two more days until the end of school and that Harry had to go back to those darn muggles for two weeks. Two weeks is still a long time, too long for someone who looks so dead to the world. He still had to give Harry his birthday present, even if his birthday is during the holidays but he didn't know if he'd even be able to see Harry at all.
But as he made his way to Gryffindor Tower, he heard someone crying from Moaning Myrtles Bathroom. He curiously made his way down the stairs to the unused girl's bathroom; he heard the most amazing singing he'd ever heard in his life. Well, the only singing he's ever heard close to him instead of on tv or the radio. He didn't want to scare whoever was in there, so he just peeked around the corner of the arched doorway.
Draco turned around to look at his best friends and shrugged. "This bears some investigating, don't you think? And I want to find Harry. Whatever this is...this Purge thing...I need to make sure Harry's okay. Are you coming?"
Draco looked up at Granger in surprise, never expecting her to be the one to ask Pansy out first. He always thought it would be Pansy who asks out Granger. Not the other way around. He knows Pansy. She will always do things first before the other and get things done. He looks beside him at Harry again and frowns when seeing Harry just staring at the empty plate in front of him. He wanted to help him but didn't know how except give him all the love and attention he can.
As Ron slid into bed, he could just see his best mate's green eyes staring down at... whatever he was looking at. Although, it kind of scared him. It was possible that Harry could be sleeping with his eyes open. But just imagine that. Imagine waking up to eyes staring at you and a body lying motionless with just the slightest motion of their chest moving up and down. It'd just be horrifying. He blinked at the boy and closed his eyes, letting sleep take over his body as he lay in bed.
Hermione gave Ron a disgusted look for even talking with his mouth full of food. It was disgusting, to say the least. "Ron!" she scolded with narrowed eyes. "Where are your manners?!"
Harry just stood there, and he cupped his cheek that Draco kissed and chuckled a little. It was sweet what Draco did, but he doesn't know why he did such a thing. When thinking back in time a little to the day where he saw a heart doodled with his name in the middle on Draco's work during Herbology, he pondered if it was true. That Draco liked him. But who would even like him? A freak who's enslaved by his own family. A freak who cuts himself. Shaking away those dark thoughts in his mind, he decided to head to Gryffindor common room. He found Hermione in that very spot he always finds her, and he walks up to her with a smile. "Hello, Hermione!"
Harry remembered that on the news, the girl suffered so much with her abusive mother and not knowing where her father was after the divorce. The news reporter said the girl committed suicide by the age of 15, the girl was one year older than himself.
Draco smiles and looks at the leaving figures of the two seventh year boys holding hands. He wished he were like them, but with a certain guy. A certain guy he's currently standing next to. He looks at Harry, into those emerald green eyes and says, "It still looks like your stalking them, Harry."
"SOD OFF, WOMAN!" shouted Blaise at her, his nostrils flaring with anger but also horror. "Nobody CARES about your dead life!"
Draco linked arms with Harry for fun but also so it would look like they were a couple. There wasn't anybody around them so he could pretty much hold hands with him, but that would just make his cheeks burn with an obvious blush which he doesn't want anybody seeing. His pale skin can't hide a blush as well as Harry's porcelain skin can.
Harry frowned at the floor where he vomited. Looks like he's got some cleaning up to do. What he didn't like was how his suicide attempt failed because of Dudley. Attention seeking prat is what Dudley called him. Yeah, sure. Let's go with that then. It appears that he's an attention-seeking prat. How utterly nice. That will totally make him feel better. Thanks, Dudley.
"Why of course," said Luna sweetly, skipping up to the doll. She picked the doll up and placed it in her arms. She didn't cradle it, she just held it tightly.
"Yes!" Pansy spat and shooed him away with her free hand. "Go! Otherwise, I'll send a stinging hex your way once I learn it. Oh, and don't you have that study date with Harry during lunch? You don't want to miss that do you?"
Harry’s just continued staring at the black bony horse, and he squeezes Draco’s hand every so often just to make sure he’s not in some weird dream. It just doesn’t make sense. How come Draco, Neville, and Ginny can’t see them but he and Luna can?
"Okay, now you are going too far, Ms Parkinson!" Draco told her in a warning tone, narrowing his eyes at her to warn her to stop whatever she's about to do. Merlin, this woman can be a tough one to deal with "Give them here!"
Ivy bit her lip, thinking back to the early morning as she woke up. Ignoring the memory of crying herself to sleep. "I got... Some new clothes, a dress to the Yule Ball which I ordered online myself, new shoes, books, incense burners and the last two I know are from you, Harry. I love the tarot cards and the wall décor of the imprinted deer skull. It's very pretty, even for a dead animal."
Draco saw the reaction from Harry and the centaur and began feeling jealous. He felt anger boil through him as he thought of his Harry being taken away by a... a... creature ... a... centaur! He moved closer to Harry like he was some animal guarding its mate and glared at the familiar centaur. I swear, if that bloody centaur says or does anything with my Harry, it will regret ever seeing the sight of 'The golden boy' ever again and... and... my father will hear about this! he thought, crossing his arm over his chest like a child who was in a tantrum. Hmph!
Harry sighed tiredly and rubbed at his forehead. How did Rita even get inside the School without being seen by every student and Professor? "Were you the one who said anything about him?" he had to ask
"It's alright," said Harry with a wave of his hand in dismissal. "And yeah, Dumbledore has dressed up as Gandalf. It's because a young Muggle-born named Chelsea called him that. Dumbledore didn't even seem mad. He just said a non-verbal spell which changed his robes into Gandalf's robes and replaced his normal hat with a white pointy one. Just like Gandalf's. Oh, and he somehow transfigured his wand into Gandalf's staff which he then said, 'You shall not pass!' Honestly, I was laughing so hard from it."
Hermione noticed the familiar frown on her best friends face and she knew it was from the hate mail he had been getting from the article Rita Skeeter had written. That witch! "Are you going to read those, Harry?" she asked as she was eating a nice bowl of warm porridge with almonds and maple syrup in it.
"It's from your mother," came the familiar and calm voice of Blaise Zabini. Draco looked over to him, and Blaise cracked an eye open to glance at him. "Not to be a snooping little git but I may have read through it and," he smirked, "all I'll say is it's a damn surprise."
Everyone had returned to eating, discussing what they'll wear and who to take. Dumbledore was about to head back to his seat but decided to say a few last words. "Actually...." Every head turned back to the headmaster and Dumbledore smiled at everyone. "Only muggle-borns and some half-bloods will get this joke. Why does Voldemort prefer Twitter over Facebook?"
"W-Who is it?" Harry asked with a frown. He entered a third finger into Draco's entrance which earned him a pleasured gasp from his Slytherin boyfriend.
Harry nodded at the suggestion to walk around the castle with Draco. Although, he felt guilty because he believes that he also laughed a little at the twin's prank on Draco. God, he felt bad and wanted to just isolate himself again from everyone, but Draco was here. "I'm sorry about them," he said a little solemnly. "And I would love to spend time with you." They smiled at each other and decided to start their walk around the castle together.
"Yes, but Draco told me that he's not too keen on having his father finding out about me and him," Harry told her with a slight frown, wishing this could all be easier. Would it be easier if he wasn't the bloody Savior to the wizarding world? "I understand that, of course. I shouldn't have asked him anyway."
Harry watched as the boys were pretending to be in a sword battle One of the Slytherin boys said "Ducklis" and turned Dean's shield into a rubber duck. Dean dropped the duck in surprise and hid behind Seamus. Harry watched as Draco turned his pencil case into a shield in no time, he watched as Draco's smile grew and oh, how he loved that smile. It always seemed to brighten up his day.
George held his hand to his heart and sighed in defeat. "Oh Freddie, how will we ever deal with being beaten by Harry?" Harry gave a little chuckle at them, but it didn't reach his eyes like a normal laugh would.
"Mr Creevey!" said Professor McGonagall, and everyone turned their heads to look at the younger boy. "What are you doing in my classroom?"
Oh, don't you dare look back
Ivy shrugged her shoulders, not exactly knowing who will win this big event or not. But she always chooses the girl contestants over the boy ones. "My money is on Fleur."
Ivy walked sat down on the table beside him; she didn't want this to feel like it was her fault but deep down she believed it was. Pansy and Draco exchanged looks of worry and sympathy at Ivy, they both knew what she was thinking. That it was her fault.
Hedwig hooted and gave Harry a friendly peck. She wasn't dumb. She could practically sense the emotions in humans and the vibes she was getting from her owner told her something was up. What she lacked was the ability to read minds then she'll be able to figure out why her owner looks so down all the time.
Ron kept staring at the couple with grins as he knew exactly what they did last night in
Good, he is asleep. It gave Harry time to do his thing. He slowly and quietly, turned to his left side of his bed and dangled his feet over the edge of the bed. He got off of his bed and tried not to make a sound and moved towards his bedside table. His glasses were the first thing he got and he put them on, and quickly walked to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom while trying not to wake anybody else up.
"Yes," said Hagrid with a small nod, and glanced around the corridors for other students passing by. He saw none but what he was about to tell the young Gryffindor was important. "It's abou' the..." He bent down to whisper, "Task."
"Nope," Pansy repeated, her smirk only widening. Oh, she loves when she has all power over Draco because of his silly hair products. It just means when she wants something, she can get it easily by intimidating her friend. Looks like she's going to get a free nail job done sooner than she thinks.
"Harry?"
Draco felt a single tear run down his cheek from what he saw. Was his father going to hurt his mother? He didn't want to believe it so he scanned the room for them but didn't see them. He felt relieved that was not real but then he thought about Harry and how this maze was affecting him. Or how it could be affecting him. He didn't exactly know.
"I ran into Cedric Diggory," Harry said and then remembered the pamphlet the Hufflepuff gave him. He leaned back, Draco's hands sliding out from his pants, his legs bent on either side of the Slytherin's thighs, and he reached into his robe pocket to pull out the pamphlet. "I believe in these pages we'll find a few moved we can try out. It's what Cedric gave me for some reason." He opened the pamphlet up, not seeing the sparkle of interest in Draco's eyes and the first page his eyes come to is the moves section. Merlin... there's so many.
Just as the Professor granted ten or more points to Gryffindor house for Hermione's great explanation of the Charm, Harry sighed and leaned his head on Draco's shoulder. He's already feeling fatigued and it hasn't even been half a day yet.
Draco looked to his side and gave a yearning look at the entrance to the Slytherin common room and sighed. The thought of dating Harry just seems like a dream come true. But he could make it happen if he had the courage to go up to Harry and just ask him out. "But what if he was dared to kiss me?" he suggested, and a little frown appeared on his face.
Harry flushed from the rather sexual compliment, he was sweating, and his body was spasming from the orgasm that hit him hard.
Harry pulled his thumb out of Draco's mouth and started to crawl back under the table, but Draco grabbed him by the hand, making him look up at him. "Where do you think you're going?" he asks in a whisper, lets go of Harry's hands, and starts unzipping his fly.
"Um..." Harry didn't know what to start off with. The crush part or the liking boys' part. There was just so much to say!
Draco had enough, he grabbed his wand, made sure nobody was looking and cast a "Tarantallegra," on the boy. He pictured the boy doing backflips and headpins in the middle of the floor, and that was exactly what the boy was doing.
"Hey!" Ivy yelled as she hid her face from the snowballs that were being thrown at her unexpectedly. She felt the cold snow on her face and shivered. "I'll get you!" she just made out in a shaky voice and looked over at the two people throwing cold icicles at her. It was Draco and Harry. She quickly got up and started throwing her snowballs she hid to her side at Harry and Draco from the ground.
Harry then watched in horror as the bathroom door's handle started moving so he quickly dropped the toilet paper in the toilet bowl. He didn't know if he should just try to be as quiet as he could or actually flush the toilet and head on out. He heard a knock on the door.
The doll began to near them. Then, in a chilly, cold voice, it said, "Do you want to play a game?"
"Draco has no concept of this, doesn't he?" Severus asked him, raising an eyebrow.
All heads looked their way, but the boys chose to ignore them and sit at the Slytherin table. They began dishing up food on their plates and talking to Ivy and Blaise while Ron stayed quiet and ate in peace.
Ivy smiled at Ron and tried to make it as big as possible as she reaches over and shakes his hand. "Hello Ron, I'm Ivy," she says and after the handshake, she grabs her fork and cuts mini slices into the strawberry jam scone. "Ivy Black."
When Romelia blacked out, her black hair knotting together against the corridor wall, Christina sighed and looked behind her at her brother.
Harry nodded at them and waved goodbye. "Alright, goodnight Georgie and Freddie," he said sleepily with a forced smile. Harry knew those two always stayed until up around 10:30 at night, just to finalize their pranks. It's just something they do, it's like their routine.
Draco sighed and rested his head on his hand over the table, wondering why he is still here being interrogated by his friends. "You girls are so annoying sometimes," he said while fingering his collar, gesturing how annoyed he was with them. "Can't you just give me a break?"
He pondered, if he brewed a Polyjuice potion and took one of George's hairs, would it make the situation with George worse or... No, he just wouldn't do something like that to George. He knows the bloke would hate him if he did so.
"A house-elf told me about a special room, it is supposed to transform into whatever kind of room you need," Harry explained it simply. He was excited to see this room which sounds impossibly real.
Lucius rolled his eyes, shook his head but played along.
Joslyn sighed in relief, thinking he was going to ask her how to put them on. Oh, how weird and embarrassing that would be. She would have rather died on the spot if that happened.
Harry shook his head, "No, not mad at all." He just doesn't get mad at all anymore. It's just upset. It's his main emotion. Depressed, stressed, and upset. "But it can be a bit much with Ron, Snape, scar and the Tournament."
Draco kneeled down and gathered up a couple of snowballs in his hands, ready for a snow fight. As Harry's back was turned to him, he took his chance and threw a snowball at Harry. It hit him right on the neck, and it hoped that it hurt so he can go kiss it better whenever he's next alone with Harry.
"No, Harry," Hermione said while shaking her head. She wouldn't tell anyone unless she's given the approval to do so. Pansy would be the first to tell obviously. "I wouldn't tell a soul unless you allow me to."
"Good morning, George," Hermione said with a yawn.
"I believe we should go now," said Harry, and he brings his hands down to intertwine one with Draco's. he really doesn't want Hermione worrying about his whereabouts. But she's probably dancing with Viktor or Pansy. "Can I just ask..." He flushed a little at the question he wanted to ask his boyfriend. "Was that your first time giving and receiving a... blowjob?"
Harry got out the piece of hair he found, held it hard so it wouldn't fly away and held it towards Hermione. Hermione cast some kind of spell, in a second there was a flash of green light. The green light showed a line of magic leading up the street, and around a corner.
"Nothing," Draco said and shook his head. Then his parents popped into his mind and he hoped that they were okay. He wouldn't have cared if they found out he was in Australia. "You just remind me of someone."
"Well, look who's come back," said Hermione with her own smile, glad she could see a smile on Harry's face again. It's quite a rare thing to see honestly. "I'm afraid to ask how detention was if it gave you a smile. Or you are just happy because you're out of detention."
Draco's head shot up as he heard the word 'Food' come out of Joslyn's mouth. He jumped into her lap and booped her hand with his little nose.
Harry just shook his head, remembering that Draco apologized for the article even before he saw it. "I don't believe Draco would say anything like that at all, Hermione," he said in a voice that's firm. "Because of the truce, he wouldn't because I know how much he cares about the relationship between us."
It was now a week until the next task and Harry made his way to Charms alone. That's what he wanted to be, all alone. That is until he heard footsteps come running up to him. He swiftly turned around, blinded by a glistening of whiteish blonde hair and lips that smashed on his own. Harry kissed the Slytherin back, moving his hands up the Slytherin's arms and around his waist. He loved how Draco can be in the morning, so lovable and sweet. "Hello, my love."
Lavender yowled loudly, reminding Ivy of a female cat. It echoed off the walls and into Ivy's ears. Lapping up her juices as they poured out, Ivy swallowed them without hesitation. Lavender's legs, which had acted as posts to prevent Ivy from moving as she was licking her, shook with a mighty terror then fell on the bed. Ivy gave Lavender's fanny one last lick to get as much juice as she could, making Lavender shiver with pleasure from her second orgasm. Ivy moved herself up and moved to the side until she was laying on the bed facing Lavender.
He continued to deepthroat Harry's cock with his mouth as the Gryffindor spirals from his orgasm, but eventually, he had to pull away from his boyfriend's soft cock and just stare at it for a few seconds. Blinking, he gave a kiss to the velvety head, put Harry's cock back in the dark blue boxers and zipped him back up. He crawled back up onto the seat, his legs spread apart and facing Harry, and smiled at his boyfriend who had a bead of sweat run down the side of his forehead. "I love you," he says sweetly and places a lingering kiss to Harry's cheek. "I don't think I'm hungry for dinner anymore, but I will still eat dinner. Oh, and it's your turn."
Harry's just staring down at Draco's lips as he couldn't believe he had just been kissed by those incredible and soft lips. The lips he has kissed before when Draco was asleep, the lips which kissed his cheek and forehead. And it wasn't just Draco's lips he had been feeling. He felt an intense fluttery feeling deep within himself, and fireworks exploding somewhere within him too. "That was..." He tried to continue but he just could not. He was speechless and a little out of breath. He could still taste Draco in his mouth, and it lingered there like a candy's sweet flavour.
Ivy nodded a little sadly. But she will try her best to hide the others from plain sight. "That's true but who'll find out if nobody tells?" she asked the dirty blonde haired girl beside her. She opened her mouth to say that nobody would since she will sneak them out easily but was interrupted by the soft sigh coming from in front of them. She smirked at the two boys in front of her who started kissing and watched her cousin stick his tongue down Harry's throat.
Dumbledore beamed at Harry, his blue eyes twinkling. "It's not a problem, Harry,” he says and waves a hand airily at him. “Now, if you excuse me, I have urgent matters to deal with."
Blaise shook his head at his stepfather. He’s not going anywhere with this man. He grimaced at how much pain his stepfather looks like he’s in. “No, father,” he replies quietly. “I’m good right here.”
Draco took another sip of his butterbeer. Even he didn't know what a music player was until now. It was an intriguing muggle object though it reminded him of a gramophone.
Harry shrugged. That's a question he's been asking himself for many years since it has started hurting. "I'm not sure, Draco," he said and deliberately rose his eyebrows and tilted his head. "The next time I come across another person with an Avada Kedavra scar on their forehead, I'll make sure to ask him."
"So good to see you too, Mr. Malfoy," Harry responded and shook the older Malfoy's hand. He did not know how Mr. Malfoy could become so nice from when he last talked to him, unless it is an act.
He then looks up and notices Pansy, and Ivy are staring at him with their jaws dropped a little. "What?" he asks them with his smile. He could still feel Harry on his lips and taste him slightly. It was captivating.
"It's me, Harry... Hermione," said Hermione. She took off her lilac coloured lace mask with small pearls on it and smiled at him. Harry widened his eyes a little. How didn't he see her under the mask? Merlin....
Draco felt his face and neck go warm at the sudden compliment, especially with the word 'pretty' coming from Harry's mouth. He just feels like skipping through the corridors of Hogwarts with a smile now. Merlin, this is how Harry makes him feel. "I hate to admit this, but I would still have to insult you and your friends."
Harry nodded, blushing even redder if possible. The thought of vomit actually made him a little sick since he has a weak stomach but he held it down as he doesn't want to embarrass himself any further than he had done with the mashed potatoes.
As Harry got down to Hagrid's hut, he saw his Gryffindor classmates and the Slytherins all huddled around something sparkly. Once he got closer, he realized he was staring at goblin gold. Harry stood beside Ron and Hermione, giving them each a fright like he just appeared out of nowhere.
Everyone lined up to Hagrid, waiting to get their piece of gold though the Slytherins were a little lazy with doing so. Finally, when everyone got a piece of gold, they all stood around the mounds of gold, waiting to lure their own Niffler.
"The charm 'Colloportus' is the locking spell," Hermione told the class, just as proudly as usual. "it locks anything from doors to chests. The only spell that can open a lock that has been locked by 'Colloportus' is the 'Alohomora' charm."
Dean, Harry, and Hermione kept calling the reindeer students Prancer, Vixen, Rudolph, Dasher and Blitzen because it was hilarious and it all excited them up for Christmas even though Hogwarts and the Wizarding world don't celebrate Christmas liked muggles do with Santa and his reindeers.
Throughout summer holidays before Harry's 4th year, Harry had been feeling more depressed than ever. And oh, how he hated the Dursley's guts so much. Aunt Petunia always woke him up at 6 am in the morning and having to cook food for three people in the morning, and sometimes at dinner time, was really annoying and exhausting. He wasn't allowed to cook for himself, it was just pure slavery for what the Dursleys put Harry through.
Vernon glares Harry's way, knowing it's all Harry's fault for making sweet Mrs Figg act up like this. "I assure you my son has chores too," he told her. "Dudley helps make dinner, does the dishes, and cleans up after himself. He does the backyard, and Harry does the front yard."
Harry laughed slightly as he cracked his knuckles and neck. He then glanced over to his left, "Say, Draco? Want to give them something to really gawk at?".
Ivy sighed with her hand cupping her cheek. "I know," she said and starts drawing invisible shapes on the table with her finger as if her finger was a pen. "A certain Slytherin has her eyes on Hermione too. My friend Pansy Parkinson."
Hermione kept buggering him about his date, and what he would wear, where they were going for their date. She didn't hear that much, only about a muggle restaurant or two. She was so proud of Harry, for taking the lead and asking Draco out.
Harry rolled his eyes and pinkie swore to him quickly. "I have to go," he said when staring down at Draco's hand, which the black Malfoy ring still lay on. He blinked and looked up into Draco's silver eyes which sparkled from the artificial light. "Goodbye everyone!"
Hagrid smiled warmly down at Ron and gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder which nearly knocked the air out of Ron's lungs. "It's alrig', Ron," he said gleefully and looked to his favourite Gryffindor seeker. Only Gryffindor seeker actually. "I'm just 'ere to see 'arry. It'll only take a minute or two."
Draco smiles and runs a hand through his hair. "It actually was a love letter and I included where you could meet me in secret if you were interested," he explained and then bit his lip. That seemed easy to say but it really wasn't. "It had a charm on it where if you look closely words will start appearing from the picture and forming a sentence. If it wasn't for Weasley seeing it and putting it in the bin..." He hesitated and looks to the saltshaker. "I'm hoping you get what I'm saying here, Harry. But if you don't as I know you get adorably oblivious..."
Harry laughed at the thought of the Dursleys driving him anywhere, let alone to go on holiday to play Quidditch. He'd probably get punished for even asking and suggesting going out to play Quidditch. "That would be difficult considering I'm usually locked in my room."
Draco sighed; he didn't want to lie to Harry, but he also didn't want him to worry. "A potion for eating disorders," He said and gathered the right ingredients from the bookshelf for the potion and placed them aside from the cauldron. Like always he kept his potion ingredients down here so no sneaky Slytherin dormmate would steal from him.
He stroked his cock, watching Draco: the furrow of his brow, the way his hair had both curled and flattened in places, wet with sweat, the painful-looking flush of his cheeks, the way his own gaze seemed locked on Harry as if Harry was his entire world. But Harry is his entire world and even his universe.
Ron said he should tell Dumbledore about Umbridge and what she's doing, but Harry doesn't want to worry the headmaster as he knows he has other issues to deal with. Not to mention the headmaster hasn't spoken to him since June.
"No, I can do my own hair thank you," Ron says with a little shake of his head, a little worried about if Harry does something wrong and styles his hair into a swan or something. But a swan seems a little too difficult which he knows Harry won't be able to do. He just doesn't want his hair all messed up.
Harry laughed at the snake, but it wasn't a real laugh as he felt too down. "Ssso, you're not going to bite me?" he had to ask as he knows snake bites hurt. That bloody Basilisk.
Harry strolled through the castle, trying to find Ron but he just wasn't anywhere to be found. So, he decided to just head back up to the dorm room. He collapsed on his bed with a smile, wondering how he could actually do that. How could he smile? He doesn't know and doesn't care at the moment.
Harry felt his cheeks warm up from the compliment as he stared into soft brown eyes, and a tinge of red appeared on his cheeks. "Thank you, again." It honestly didn't make him feel any better. This was only one person out of a whole world of seven billion people.
Through the first 10 minutes of the class, Draco couldn't help but glance at Harry a few times. He knew Harry was glancing back at him and he liked it. No, he loved it. At times, they would even stare into each other's eyes, admiring the beauty of them.
Seamus and Dean started kissing each other in front of the whole class, wanting to be apart of this kissing session and it's so their classmates don't just pay attention to Draco and Harry. They knew how awkward it was having people watch you as you kiss your lover. They heard tons of 'Awwe's from around them and one or two "Eww's' coming from the Slytherins but they didn't care.
Fred gave Harry a knowing look as he said, "I dare you to kiss the prettiest person in this room."
Draco cleared his throat and leaned out of the hug so he could look back into green eyes. Curious green eyes. "So, um..." He didn't think it would be easy nor hard. Here goes nothing. "I've really liked a guy for such a long time him but it's hard to tell him that I like him."
They moved their shoulders smoothly and parallel with the floor instead of up and down while waltzing together, and they felt elevated and lowered as they moved onto their toes. Their feet were like the waters of a stream: smooth and buoyant, and full of energy. Everything and everyone around them was spinning and were a faint blur to their vision, they only paid close attention to the other's eyes.
"Congrats, Georgie. I wish you fun!" Harry said and rubbed a hand self-consciously through his hair. Then he turned to Fred. "So, Freddie? Want to be my Yule Ball partner? I was counting on you know who to ask me, but he hasn't yet. And I'm not very... I don't think I'm able to ask him. I lose my bravery when with him at times and often I forget about the Yule Ball when I'm with him."
"I'm ready!" Draco assured him, holding onto Harry's waist for balance. "Don't let go of me or I'll come back and haunt you from the grave, Harry." Harry gave a laugh at the Slytherin and what he told him. There's the Draco Malfoy he knows and... loves.
"I'll let you know when I want something," said Harry as he didn't want Ron to get him anything. He doesn't want Ron using his money to buy things for him, or to give him any favours like doing his homework and such.
Draco watched in fear and utter sadness as Hagrid brought Harry's lifeless body up to the castle. He couldn't be dead, right? He just couldn't. He loves this bloke. This just can't be real. Draco let a tear fall down his face, but he wiped it off quickly. He felt a hand rub his arm and looked up at Luna Lovegood who was staring down at him with a frown. "I'm glad you care about him, Draco," she said in her dreamy, but broken voice.
"Hello, Harry," Ginny said.
Draco pointed his wand back at the yellow door's handle and muttered, "Apertio!"
Harry placed his hands around Draco's neck, and just as Draco was about to place his hands on Harry's waist, he sees some of his bodily fluids on Harry's lip and heat rose to Draco's cheeks. He quickly used a thumb to wipe away his semen from Harry's mouth and pressed his thumb to Harry's parted lips.
Draco would have run out of parchment if he tried to write down why he loved Harry so much. He needed Harry in his life. They were like the Leprechaun gold coin to the Niffler, he was the Niffler and Harry was the gold coin. Or perhaps it was the other way around.
Harry noticed that Ivy used the bunny ears thing when she said 'raise' and 'take care'. He understood what she was gesturing. Ivy's mother wasn't taking care of her in a good way. It was like him and the Dursleys.
Harry glared at Draco and walked into the storeroom; he didn't realize that Draco was right behind him until the door closed behind him. "What's wrong with you?" He exclaimed, moving to shove Draco aside.
Draco laughed at the thought of someone hugging a house-elf as he leaned away from Harry's neck. Is that even possible? But he wouldn't caught dead hugging a bloody house elf. It's disgusting. It's probably like hugging a rat. They are slaves after all. "You can if you want to, but I don't think house-elves are too keen on hugging."
After gathering everything that had just happened, Harry kissed Fred back and lifted his hand up to Fred's cheek, feeling his long red hairbrush against his fingertips. This was a funny feeling, kissing another boy but it was a pleasant feeling. In fact, Fred was a good kisser. The feeling of Fred's soft lips on his own felt nice, even if he wasn't attracted to him in a lovey-dovey kind of way. Not like he was with... Draco. Then, Harry felt kind of guilty for kissing Fred, even though he and Draco weren't together. Harry was about to wrap his arms around Fred's lithe body, but Fred opened the gap between them, and they were panting heavily.
Draco smiled, mounted his Nimbus 2001, and looked over to Harry, "Race you!" He then took off, flying around the castle towards the Quidditch Pitch. Harry grunted and soared after the Slytherin. He leaned down on his broom and accelerated faster, coming closer and closer to Draco. As soon as they were at the Quidditch Pitch, Harry cast a "Lumos" on the snitch and let it go. The glowing snitch immediately flew across the Pitch with Harry and Draco in pursuit. Draco followed every move that Harry made, in tight formation behind him. Attempting to shake him off Harry went higher in a vertical barrel roll than he usually would fly, and then doubled back and flew straight down towards the ground.
Harry watches as Neville, Ginny, and Luna Lovegood wander over to their carriage, and he notices Luna looking in the direction of the bat-like horse creature. He suddenly feels hope, that he really isn’t seeing things. So could she see the creature? What was it though?
Harry gave the boys in front of him the biggest fake smile he could make. He didn't want to stay here for long as these two obviously want their alone time. He wished he had someone to spend hours and hours of alone time with. Hopefully, his forced smile was enough to make them not worry about him because why would they worry? He's just a burden to this Earth. "Perhaps I'll see you out in the field someday, Joshua. I was thinking of becoming an Auror too." The dream to become an Auror was fading away. He just doesn't see himself as an older man with a job. He doesn't see himself at all.
"I like that idea as well," Draco said and got Harry back with a bump to the shoulders and a charming smile which made Harry's heart flutter in his chest. He smiled at his Harry and placed an arm around him, keeping him close to both his body and heart.
"Wow," Harry gasped. "Just wow."
But first things first, Cody, the tall blonde boy who's the older brother of Christina who both dressed as Purge killers, whipped his phone out, pressed play on an audio recording and set his phone down on the ground. Christina spelled Cody's phone with a loudspeaker charm, making the video sound x100 louder.
Draco nodded and pulled him into one final kiss, memorising the way Harry’s soft lips move against his own. It will be a while until he sees Harry again, so he wants to savour every last moment he has with Harry. Then the kiss ended, and Draco stepped away from Harry, smiling sweetly, and went off to his father who was already paying for his books.
"I think Harry Malfoy is the better option," Lucius said, smirking because he wants the Malfoy name to go on in the future. "Draco, what do you think?"
Pansy and Draco looked at what Blaise had spotted. Is this what the lady meant by 'Purge'? Creepy doll-like things? Either way, it was horrifying! They wanted nothing to do with weird and creepy dolls. They wanted to get away, back into the Slytherin dungeons where it was nice, warm, and safe.
"Harry do you have to go?" Draco asked him sadly and pouted a little at him. Why does he have to go? Does his boyfriend have something important to do? What's more important than himself? "And why do you have to go?"
Harry walked over to Draco's bed and he got in easily. When he saw the smirk appear on Draco's face, he closed the curtain, shutting out all light from in Draco's bed. He pulled off his cloak and leaned down on his Slytherin, crushing him under his body. "Well hello again, my love," he says silently and nearly purs when Draco's hands move up his body and grip onto his arse cheeks. "Needy, are we?"
"Yeah, that would be true," Harry said with a fake small smile, pondering when he'll see Ron and Hermione next. But by the sound of 'more students coming to Hogwarts', his social anxiety was starting to increase already. Why must life be so hard? "I know that Fred and George would still be plotting ways to get into the age line," he said just to start a new topic. An intriguing topic. "Do you think they will make it?"
"Oh?" said Ron, raising an eyebrow with interest. This just got interesting to him and everyone else. "What like?"
We can't keep running away from who we are.
"Hello, Harry," Draco said, locking his arms around Harry's waist and smiling at the sight of breathtaking green eyes that were staring into his silver ones.
At some indeterminate point, Harry had ceased sucking, and Draco had started fucking. He only realised that he was abusing Harry's mouth so roughly when he was a couple of thrusts short of his orgasm, and then it was too late to be gentle. But from the noises Harry was making, Draco thought he seemed not to mind the force. That was the last thought he had as the orgasm lashed through his body, curling his toes inside his shoes with its intensity, and forcing its way into Harry's mouth and down his throat. He could feel the come drenching his too-sensitive skin as it collected in Harry's mouth before it was eagerly gulped down.
Joslyn sighed. Should have known better than to take him outside of her bedroom where questions would be thrown at her. "He's my friend mum. Mum meet Dra-... David Mallet. David, meet my mother," she said and really waiting for this to be over so she can show Draco the movies.
Harry shook his head, not wanting anybody to get into trouble right now. "Nah, I think Draco should have a say in this actually," he said to her and wondered what punishments Draco could give the twins. The thought was intriguing though. He would like to see the part of Draco that he hasn't seen yet.
Hermione noticed Harry's distraction in class, Draco Malfoy. She had no clue what was going on between those two, but she had a hunch as she has caught Harry ogling the Slytherin a lot. She's also caught Harry staring at a lot of guys throughout the years and completely ignoring the pretty girls he's ever come across with. She smiled at her friend and continued writing down the ingredients for a potion.
Draco was warring with himself inside. This was his fantasy, something he'd imagined for a very long time. Surely, he could give himself permission to make the most of it.
Draco saw tears start to form in his cousin's eyes, so he gave her a side hug for comfort and loaded some sausage rolls on her plate. He knows that she loves her sausages and pasties, it's one of her favourite meals besides Lasagna. She's always making some things up like how Lasagna is the food of the gods and goddesses and that some cat names Garfield even agrees with her. Who the hell is Garfield though? It sounds like some butler's name honestly.
They sat at the Slytherin table together, but Blaise sat on the other side of Harry and Draco next to Theodore.
She took my arm
"Hm?" Harry looked back up at Draco into his Silvery eyes. He didn't hear what the Slytherin said to him, only about thinking which is exactly what he was doing. Merlin, how dangerous it would be if Draco could see his thoughts.
Draco rolled his eyes at them, now wanting to get away from them. That's just the thing. How can he get rid of these girls without them following him or somehow finding out where he is? "Yeah, you know because I told you like... I'm not sure, a year or two ago?"
Of course, Fred had to make this more awkward for Harry. Fine, if this is the game that will be played, so be it. "Truth." He hasn't played this game at all if he's being honest.
"I just..." Ron trailed off. He just couldn't be mad at Harry even though he knew he should.
"Well, I'm so glad you told me about the relationship you and Draco have," Hermione began. "I am so happy you have sorted your rivalry aside and have begun something new with him. I hope you and Draco have the happiest time together, whether there are fights or not. But fights are healthy in a relationship. Just not too many. You belong together. You're like two peas in a pod, inseparable."
Ivy returned her hand to the soaked patch of neatly trimmed blonde hair and rolled Lavender's clit with her forefinger. Lavender threw her head back and moaned as Ivy treated her with the Gryffindor kindness, she had shown her and the thought of Ivy drinking her blood had disappeared from her mind. Ivy toyed with Lavender for a few more moments, watching in amusement as she looked so vulnerable and her mouth parted to pant lightly, then went even lower.
Draco smiled as he leaned away from Harry's beautiful light and feathery kisses and he pressed his forehead to his boyfriends. "We should probably rush to class now as we don't want to be late," he whispered as he stared into bright green emerald eyes. "However, maybe I do want to be late if this is what you'll be giving me all morning."
Harry let out a sigh and looked up at Cedric. All that was on his mind was the kiss with Draco and he couldn't get rid of that memory. He didn't want the memory to leave actually. He doesn't think he would be able to concentrate in class now. He's just too ecstatic that Draco had kissed him. It had been a dream for a very long time, and it had come true!
Narcissa shook her head with a little smile at her son for his shenanigans. Then she turned and banished the dead trees around the front yard.
"We're really sorry about our little Ronny and Ginny," George said with a cracked voice, and he rubbed at his nose. He hoped it wasn't all because of him and Fred that their younger siblings were raised like this. "It's a shame. We thought we raised them way better than this."
Another minute hit as the second name flew out of the goblet. "Fleur Delacour, Beaxbaton," Dumbledore called out. A loud applaud was coming from all over the Grand Hall.
Harry flinched. He angered his uncle. Now a punch or a kick was surely to come. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he cried over and over again.
Lisa screamed and ran for her life. She did NOT want to die yet. Not until she's like ... 80!
They were both making constant, quiet noises and Draco guessed they would come together. He made a final, brutal push downwards, letting the weight of his body force the entire length of Harry into him. The sudden dull pain that registered from the penetration could not dampen the bliss he felt at rubbing his groin flat against Harry's jerking body. Draco had taken it all and it was the most uncomplicated, serene feeling he'd ever known.
Draco smiled sadly at Harry, reached his other hand up to brush a few strands of his bangs out of his emerald green eyes and placed a kiss to his forehead. He didn't care who saw him now. He got a positive letter from his father about his sexuality and Ivy and Pansy know he's only been kissing Harry multiple times. They have no idea that he's dating Harry.
"Oh, okay then," Ivy said and got up from her seat to give harry a light hug before he had to go for whatever reason he had. "I'll see you later, Harry. Stay safe and be happy for me." She leaned away from the hug and smiled at him. "Remember that you're not the only homosexual in Hogwarts so Ron Weasley's words don't only affect you. It affects all of us. And don't think that it's your fault he's acting this way. It's his choice if he decides to be a homophobic shithead."
Harry grabbed the practice snitch out of his pocket and showed it to him. "I know it would be better to use a practice snitch," he said and threw the practice snitch at Draco, who caught it easily with two hands. "Don't want to be out all night trying to catch a real one."
Ivy sighed at her cousin. How did he not know this about love? "Draco," she said softly and looked at Pansy for a second then looked back at him, smiling as she believes she knows something he doesn't. "Crushes don't exactly last this long. They last about a month or two, but it's been more than that. You love Harry. I can see it in your eyes, and the way you talk to him. If you want Harry, then go get him. Pansy and I won't be there to help or guide you. It's all on you."
Harry kept blabbering on about the Slytherin, "Lips that look so soft to the touch, to kiss... Beautiful pale skin..." He remembered watching the Slytherin in his sixth year. That arse that moved so elegantly in those pants. Merlin. He felt an erection start at the thought of the blonde's arse. "The tightest ass..."
Harry and Draco stared into each other's eyes again and never broke eye contact. They danced around each other to the beat of the song until it finished. By then, McGonagall announced that the food would be served soon so everyone should find a table with their dates or go to the back of the Great Hall where the photos will be taken. After the announcement, a few people started going to the left corner of the Great Hall where pictures were being taken in front of the three big white fir trees or they were getting food by the food tables.
“Come on, Harry. Let’s go inside,” said Draco. He squeezed Harry’s hand, letting him know he wants to move and head inside. Harry smiled at him and let Draco pull him inside the bookstore by the hand until they were lining up behind a few other witches and wizards.
"Right," said Harry, smiling brightly at the two snogging blokes. "Draco and I are going to leave you two alone so enjoy yourselves!"
He chose to get back up and try to walk through this hell maze without. He began walking through the maze; turning left, right, left, and right again. What he wanted to know is why such a hell of a maze could be in such a beautiful garden. He hasn't the slightest idea why anyone, not even Helga Hufflepuff would put such a maze in this garden of Amare.
Fred and George nodded at the blonde Slytherin. But they didn't believe him when he said 'best friends' because do 'best friends' really stare at each other in a loving way? Do best friends kiss each other on the mouth? No, they don't think so. "Alright then, brothers and sisters we must take our leave," they both chorused together.
"Um..." Harry said a little uneasily, and he sat up, rubbing his arm up and down. Could he say it? After a moment of thinking about if he can, he finished. "The first time happened during the night of the Yule Ball. After dinner at the tables, we headed out and he took me to the Slytherin common room and to the boy's dormitory. We were making out on his bed, and his knee touched a part of me and rubbed that spot over and over again until I... um... you know. And err... he cleaned me up with his tongue and mouth. He gave me my first blowjob and then I did the same for him."
Draco watched as the Hufflepuff contestant, Cedric Diggory, walked out of the tent and into the arena. The Hufflepuff was tall but compared to the arena, he looked like he could easily be squashed by a fly. As soon as the bell rang, Cedric looked around his surroundings, seeing a big rock and transforming it into a puppy.
"Barely," said Draco with a smirk. He knows how well Harry can fly. Harry practically dived for the snitch and luckily flew up when he was a few feet from the ground. Harry just has luck on his side. He has gotten through the first task but what about the second task and the third?
Draco nodded in agreement. But then there was a moment of silence, neither bloke knowing what to say as the thought of having kids with each other popped into their minds. "Do you and your Gryffindor roommates have get-togethers every now and then?" Draco asked him curiously.
"What's this about me?" Pansy asked, leaning towards the two with an eyebrow raised and a confused look on her face. She certainly hopes she isn't being gossiped about without her permission.
*****
"Oh, sorry," Draco said quickly but chuckled at Potter's sarcasm. He lifted himself up off of the Gryffindor, held out his hand for Potter to take so he can help him up.
"I guess I'll go then," said Harry with an unwilling shrug. He didn't care if he was the one who tests it out, he just wanted to know what his apparent true lover is even though he wished it to be the guy he's been crushing on for ages.
"Yup!" Harry just didn't sound too enthusiastic about this conversation. What if Ron wouldn't accept him for liking guys? "That's his boyfriend, Joshua. Nice guy," he told them earnestly. "Do you have a problem with people liking the same gender?" He asked softly, raising an eyebrow while feeling a little sick in the gut from lunch even though he only ate half a sandwich.
Draco walked up to the sobbing family of red-heads and there he saw one of the twins' dead. Lifeless. The other twin looked so broken. Apart from him was gone, long gone. Draco felt so sad for all these families who suffered and all the friends that were lost. His eyes laid on Harry's green ones, they both stared into each other's eyes, tearful and bright and they hugged.
Draco reached his hand up, letting the cold air hit it as he pushed back Harry's fringe. He looked at the lightning bolt scar that lay on Harry's forehead. He traced it with his fingers, feeling the scar under his fingertips. it was odd but...amusing.
Draco shook his head, reached his hand up to Harry's hand on his cheek and pressed his hand to Harry's. He turned his head to the side and placed a kiss to the palm of Harry's hand. "I don't think so," he said softly. "Again, I'm really sorry Harry."
Hermione giggled at her blushing friend and shook her head. She asked first so she'll get the answers she wants first. "Nope, I want to hear this first. There is no talking yourself out of it, Harry. You know the rules."
Harry shrugged whilst looking down at the grounds of Hogwarts from one of the dorm windows. The storm had calmed down a bit since last night, but it was still sprinkling outside. He started to ignore every word that was coming from Ron's mouth as his train of thoughts kept moving through his head.
Harry grinned from the other side of the ballroom. He was back in his Freddie costume until 10:20, which he'll have to rechange into another costume. Merlin, he hates contact lenses. So bloody annoying! But it'll help keep his identity a secret until midnight. Placing his cup of Halloween punch down on the table, which Hermione helped him make, he strolled over to Draco.
He had passed Hermione who was calmly reading a book about whatever she was reading that must be interesting, and Ron who was versing Fred and George in a round of Wizards chess. They didn't even acknowledge him when entering the tent so now he just feels worthless all over again. If only there was a place where he had enough privacy to cut himself but since there wasn't any space he just laid down on his cot, facing the wall and scratched at his cuts from under his sleeves.
"I'll hopefully be seeing you in Magical Creatures," Draco said and gave Harry a solemn look. He was blushing a little from the kiss he gave Harry, and he didn't mind if Harry saw it. "If I don't see you, I'll be worrying about where you are, so you better be there."
For three times a week, Harry and Hermione have always gone jogging at 6 in the morning, and ever since their first jog, Harry’s noticed an increase in upper and lower leg muscles and has noticed he’s been able to run further than he normally could. Aside from that, he’s been eating at a normal rate for men his age instead of the little meals he used to have. Although the jogging has helped him, he still feels rather depressed every now and then.
"That's wonderful!" Cedric said, beaming at the young Gryffindor. "But, that's not half of what I'm here to talk about, Harry. It's about the third task. On Monday, before classes start, we have to meet the minister of Magic and Crouch and talk about the third task."
Luna beamed and told Harry exactly what a Nargle is from what it looks like, its colour, and what it does. And after the long but very interesting explanation, Ginny had cut in. "Isn't she cute?" she asked with a loving smile at Luna.
His eyes shot open and he sat up, staring around his surroundings. Everything was dark, and it only made Harry more scared. He kept his hand under the blanket and rolled his sleeve up. He scratched hard at his wrist, feeling the scabs rub off and little blobs of his blood slowly appear. This is exactly what he needed as he felt the wave of numbness hit him. He just kept scratching, scratching as hard as he could from under his sleeves. Feeling fulfilled, he crawled back under the sheets and just lay there in silence waiting until the next day came.
"I am thinking of sleeping in Salazar's room, or even Godric's if we find it," Draco said earnestly, smiling slightly at Harry and how he thinks he doesn't believe him. Even he wouldn't believe himself for saying such a thing. But the rooms seem neat, and the cleaning magic still works in the room, so he has a good feeling that there won't be any rats living down there. Or so he hopes. "I just want to sleep as soon as I can."
Harry knew what he had to do, but did he want to do it? The answer clawed through his head. Yes. He wants to cut and there's nobody to stop him or hurt him. No Ron to call him Faggot or disgusting muggle words he learnt from somewhere. Probably from his own father. He wondered how Molly would have taken to hearing those words come out of his mouth. Harry sighed sadly and turned around, knowing what to do. He didn't want to feel pain any more right now, even if he knew it only made him know he was human.
"You. Me. Alone. Walking," Harry spelled out. He just wanted to spend some time with his boyfriend since he won't have time to. The last task was in two days and he had a lot of revising to do.
Draco nodded as he understood how it is with a bookworm of a friend. Blaise is quite a bookworm. That is if you catch him reading a book. "Let's head back to the library's secret room," he said and linked arms with Harry again. He smiled at the red tinge that resurfaced to Harry's cheeks. "I need to clean out my cauldron." Harry gave him a quick nod and headed back to the library with Draco.
Seamus cleared his throat, knowing they had been found out. Only a few people know of their relationship, and it wasn't Harry. Neville, and a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs in their year.
Harry felt his cheeks warm up as Draco linked arms with him, and he tightened the grip a little. He walked with Draco out into the snowy grounds, which Ivy was leading them, and Ron and Blaise were behind them. He remembered the last time they linked arms together, under the invisibility cloak after flying. It was a great night, even if he did wake up with a red face from windburn. One thing they haven't done is hold hands though.
Anyway, I hope to see you very soon, maybe the Summer Holidays I can come to visit.
"Wait!" he yelled at them and stood in front of the two girls with dark hair and a boy with light brown hair that are slightly younger than him. "Can I come into your common room, please? I have a gift for my boyfriend." The three Slytherin's looked at each other, a little uncertain. "It's Valentine's day after all. Please? I'm begging of you!" He frowned at them. "This is the first ever Valentines gift for my boyfriend. This is very special to me and will be to Draco."
Draco watched his friend hop onto the bed and silently lay there. What happened to jumping on the bed and acting all childish? He chuckled at him and walked up to the bed, rested his hands on one of the posts and watched Harry close his eyes, deep in thought. He just wanted to join him, be close to him, hug him, kiss him.
"Do you mean to tell us that that maze was our only consequence?" Draco asked the elf in disbelief. At least he and Harry know not to go back in it. Who knows what else it could hold inside the walls of the maze?
The professor looked up at his student, he knew Dean and Seamus were good friends. Very good friends actually. He's seen them snogging in the halls which surprises him a little. Of course, he has had to teach a lot of LGBTQ+ students in the past and present and he finds them quite extraordinary. "Very well, Mr Thomas," he said in a squeaky voice. "Be quick! This will be an exciting lesson!"
Draco kept his hands in front of him, guiding him through the mirror maze. It was actually getting a little easier. But then Pansy screamed. Of course, when she screams something is obviously bad.
"That makes sense," said Narcissa with a nod. "I garden to calm myself down. But I don't get down in the dirt and mess my nails and hands up. I prefer them clean even if a simple spell could remove the dirt and smell from my fingers and hands."
Draco took no hesitation and ran to the shower, opening it up and escaping through the door inside the shower. Blaise and Pansy followed him from behind. Last but not least, Seamus, Neville and Ron followed after them. They headed down the dark hallway, the only light was the candles on black holders on the walls to the side of them.
"P-Parvati," Ginny said, her stuttering only getting worse, but she gained her bravery. She shakily pointed her finger towards the cloaked figure. "L-Look over there."
"I know a few but they're muggle games," Harry said, biting his lip at the way Draco was looking at him. Honestly, he could just stay here all afternoon and have those pretty silver eyes staring at him and that handsome face so close to him. It was just him and Draco, alone in this room like nothing else in the world mattered. "Truth or Dare, spin the bottle, Kiss, Marry or Kill, and Never have I ever."
Harry turned around and was face to face with his friend, but also secretly his crush. "Hello, Draco," he said and blushed slightly as the Slytherin was quite close to him. The best part about having Draco here was how he made him feel. It's like being blessed with warmth and a presence that makes him feel loved. "Whatever happened to using my first name, Draco?"
"You are welcome and wow that was hot," Fred answered truthfully with a soft smile. He rose his arm up and pressed the back of his hand against his mouth.
It was such a beautiful day at Hogwarts, the school had just started only months ago, the Tri-Wizard Tournament had come to Hogwarts. So far, Harry had finished the first tournament, and how that day was probably the most frightening thing he had ever gone through. He sure as hell, was near an Anxiety attack whenever he woke up from a nightmare, even thinking of that day, scared him.
"I'm not your uncle, Harry. It's me, Ron. Do you remember where you are?" Ron didn't understand why Harry was so upset about this nightmare he had. What was his Uncle doing to him in his dream? He hoped it wasn't anything terrible. He is sure as bloody hell hoped Harry wasn't being hurt because he will storm that muggle's house and hex that bloody bastard of an Uncle no matter if he's not allowed to do magic underage.
"So, Harry," Hermione said with a curious and slow smile that builds. She still doesn't know if Harry's going with anyone yet. Her first guess is a certain blonde Slytherin. She doesn't have any other guesses though. Who knows? Harry might surprise her. "Who are you going with?"
Harry grudgingly entered the Potions classroom and sat next to Neville, like he did earlier in the term, but he didn't want to think about that day. He watched as everyone entered the room after him. Seamus, Dean, Draco, and his goons and lastly Lavender. Everyone was chatting wildly; Harry couldn't help but glance up at the Slytherins. As soon as his eyes met a certain silver-eyed Slytherin, he looked away with a little blush that rose from his cheeks.
Surprisingly, Viktor Krum made an appearance with the Durmstrang boys. Ron couldn't believe his eyes that the Viktor Krum has come to Hogwarts, it devastated Ron even more, as Viktor decided to sit with the Slytherins.
"It was a pleasure meeting you, Joslyn," said Hermione kindly with her own smile.
Harry watched Draco get into bed but left a large enough space for a second person to enter. Was Draco going to let him sleep in his own bed? He was!
Ron just couldn't think straight. There was a killer in the castle called a 'Nun', and his little sister was out there in the corridors, alone, but thankfully with two other people. He hopes Parvati was taking care of her, and whoever else. But he just wanted to know where Hermione was.
"No, otherwise I would have known," Ivy said and shook her head with a small smile. She would have known someone was staring at her, and it wasn't Harry. Nobody has been looking at her, it's why she feels like a ghost all the time. Just a soul travelling in her own little world. "He was definitely looking at you, the only time he looked my way was when he entered the Great Hall which I smiled at him and he returned the smile. Besides, you know I'm a lesbian."
"I care for people, not like my father ever does," Draco said with a smile towards the tent Harry could be in. He couldn't wait to see Harry's beautiful face and everything. "I'm more of my mother than my father, even though my father thinks I'm like him. And when I was younger, I sort of wanted to be like my father. That was until I realized how obnoxious and rude my father can be to others."
Draco smiled at the floor and ran a hand through his hair. "Harry asked me to be his date to the Yule Ball," he told them, and he watched as Ivy and Pansy bloody squealed and hugged each other. After the hug, Pansy cupped her mouth with her hands and bounced from foot to foot while Ivy bounced on her tippytoes out of excitement.
This woman is my destiny
Harry just blinks and leans his head on Draco's shoulder, trying to find where his innocence has gone to. He just let his boyfriend suck him off in front of house-elves. God... Merlin, forgive him. "I love you too, Draco," he eventually says and leans away, turns his head to the side and looks at his boyfriend. He swipes his thumb along Draco's bottom and top lip, gathering the semen from the Slytherin's mouth onto his thumb before pressing his thumb to Draco's parted lips. The Slytherin closed his mouth over Harry's thumb, closing his eyes, and sucked off the semen like it's a sweet he's been craving for months.
Harry sat down with Fred and George, drawing figure eights on the wood of the table with his finger. He looked up at the twins with a forced smile, knowing he can ask one of these blokes easily. "I actually wanted to ask if any of you are free for the Yule Ball?"
On the other side of the mirror, more red writing was displayed. Draco read what's on the mirror in blood, "Say it three times."
Hermione looked at Harry's steak with a frown, then looked at him. She leaned to her best friends' ear and whispered, "Can I have half of your steak please, Harry?" She isn't hungry for steak, but her body needs it.
"I haven't asked him out yet because... I just don't know when to," Draco tells the girls, who look at him with bored and disappointed expressions on their faces. "You try talking to your crushes and asking them out. It's actually pretty nerve-wracking."
He hid himself well under his hoodie and kept his hoodie down and over his head where he feels a little safe and secure. People still were staring at him, and he really was feeling like he was close to dropping off the edge now. The tears began to fall down his face, so he quickly looked down so nobody could see. What was their problem? Did he have anything on his face- Oh, of course? The bloody scar. Thanks, Voldemort.
"Oh," said Harry, then feeling a little uncomfortable with what Viktor is doing. He swears that hand is moving down south to where it shouldn't be going. He quickly stepped away from the older bloke's grasp and said, "I'm 14."
Harry thought about last year and in Hagrid's class. Draco had become so unbelievably attractive and was so hot, even if he was a mean git. His white-blonde hair that shone in the sunlight, his perfect mouth that should be blessed with kisses from the angels, those silvery eyes that he swears are made of actual diamonds... He was brought out of his thoughts as a hand was being shaken in front of his eyes.
Harry turned his head to face his new friend but also his crush. He looked him deep in his silver eyes and gave him a little smile. "Yeah, same here," he told him, and he sees a sparkle in those eyes which makes his heart flutter. "Otherwise, I wouldn't be stuck here with you," he added cheekily.
"He didn't do anything, Ron!" came the infuriated voice of Ivy Black. She picked up a snowball from the pile of snowballs she made and threw a snowball at him. Then she began muttering something in French. "Comment osez-vous empiéter sur ce moment! Ne voyez-vous pas qu'ils allaient s'embrasser?!" (How dare you intrude on this moment! Don't you see they were going to kiss?!)
Seamus looked away, afraid the blush on his face was too dark that it'd just be embarrassing. "Let's just keep going..." Ron smirked, knowing there's going to be a lot of unanswered questions for him.
"A prank, yes," said Harry, smiling under his Freddie mask. "The whole killing spree thing was a prank for all you Purebloods and half-bloods who know nothing about the muggle world. It was hilarious watching you lot run around the castle screaming your heads off."
Draco puffed out his cheeks, earning a little chuckle from Harry which he smiled at him for. "Dare," he said easily and now wondered what she had in mind. Would it be simple or hard for him? Would she have him do or say something?
Draco nodded understandingly at her. He doesn't get what she's going through but he tried to understand it and to help her as much as he possibly can. "I get that, and would you like me to make you a sleeping potion?"
"Oh, but how can normal trees have magic?" Joslyn asked him, catching her breath as they still run. It was a few K's until they reached her house, even if the suburb was quite small.
Soon after them, Neville came into the room with a smile on his face but when hearing moans, he froze and looked to Harry's bed. He swallowed and looked to the two wizards on their own beds beside him. Dean was reading and Seamus was just staring up at the ceiling of his 4-poster. When Seamus looked his way and smirked, Neville just shook his head and went to his own bed. All that was left was Ron, who was probably with Hermione and still in the ballroom.
"Perhaps someone did place his name in the Goblet, but didn't ask for Potter's consent first," Snape suggested with a scowl, knowing Potter somehow got himself into this. He just needed to find out how.
Like someone heard Blaise reject the offer, a presence that they couldn't see began to write on the mirror. 'Say it or she comes for you'.
Lucius sighed and waited until his wife got back. He continued to drink his tea and stare at the picture. It really was beautiful, the way both boys looked into each other's eyes. It brought tears of joy into his eyes, he let them fall down. "I am not like you, father," he muttered as he closed his eyes. "I won't ever be like you. How dare you raise me like this."
"I love you too, Draco, so very much," Harry whispered sweetly, cupped his Slytherin boyfriend's cheeks and kissed him with all the passion in the world. he didn't even care if he could taste himself on Draco's mouth.
"You may commence, read the instructions carefully," Snape said coldly, looking directly at Neville and Harry who he knew will mess up the potion.
Draco blushed even more from Harry giving him a rose and from what Harry had told him just then. "Yeah that really was a wonderful kiss, by the way, Harry," He said as he gave Harry a beautiful smile that he knew Harry loved. "You're a really good kisser too. I love your kisses and I love you." He then leaned in to kiss Harry before he could answer back.
Ivy and Pansy looked at Draco curiously as he was staring at this one spot beside him. They shook their heads a little at each other with smiles and got back to eating their dinner.
"Wow," whispered Draco, his eyes never leaving Harry's green ones. "That was incredible!"
"With this penny," said Mike, smirking at all his fellow Gryffindor's surprised expressions. "I'll make it disappear. Watch closely, everyone." He held the palm of his hand out and placed the penny on his lifeline. He placed his other hand over his open one and then closed them together. Giving his closed hands a little shake, he blew into them and opened his hands up, showing the crowd his simple magic trick. "Walla! Vanished! But where?"
Harry blushed when he and Draco locked eyes, so he looked down at the floor as he removed himself from the hug.
Well open up your mind and see like me
"Ah," Harry said and nodded a little. But then he scrunched up his face in disgust at the table, hoping this Mie Goreng doesn't have slimy animals in it. "This dish better not have snails or slugs in it. I wouldn't be able to stomach it and will probably lose my appetite for an entire month."
"So, Harry..." George started. "Got any blokes on your mind?"
"All done," Mrs Weasley said, and Harry looked at her in disbelief. "Yes, I'm done," she said when seeing Harry's mouth open to say something back. How could she be done? He didn't even hear her cast a spell or anything that feels like healing magic occur to him. He felt nothing.
Harry laughed, ended the hug, and hopped on the train. He found Draco in one of the back compartments with Hedwig out of her cage, sitting on his lap. He closed the compartment door behind him and smiled at his boyfriend, ignoring the glare from his owl. "I think I might be jealous."
"Um... you're welcome, Draco," Harry responded with a warm smile, thinking about doing this again sometime though it was Draco who came down to the pitch to watch him. He hoped that in the future Draco would come by and see him more or he can go find Draco if there aren't many people around. "It was great catching up with you."
Draco looked at her strangely, like she thought that he was a cat when she was petting him. "I'm not a bloody ferret anymore, Jos," he told her with a frown.
"That was interesting to hear," said Seamus, smirking over at Dean. The three teenagers began to laugh at them, and Harry hesitated when hearing his dormmates in the room with him. He pondered how long they've been in the room for. He didn't mind though. As long as they enjoyed the...noise.
And then Harry was left alone in the kitchen. He sighed; he was really worried about George and how he deals with Fred's death. But right now, he needed that morning walk in the park.
Harry and Hermione got a last good look at their Nifflers and put them back in their mounds of gold. They were disappointed they didn't get to spend more time with the Nifflers, or even keep them even if they're not permitted to be kept as pets.
Harry grinned and hugged her back. Well, his grin was hidden behind his Freddie mask. He grimaced at how itchy his eyes were becoming though. "Thanks, 'Mione." Then he looked at a girl with blonde hair tied into two braids. "Emilie, is the blood on the walls done?"
"And what if I choose Harry to be with forever?" Draco asked him, his eyebrow quirked up. He knew that was a lot to say but he just had to ask. He had to know if his father would accept him for liking males.
"Good evening class," said Professor sprout in her usual bubbly and light tone. "We're going to be taking care of muggle flowers. Why? Because we all need to know about muggles as well as our kind. Now, I'd like everyone to form groups, please."
"Sorry..." Harry said slowly with remorse. Hedwig glared at Harry but then turned her head around to look the other way in ignorance.
“Um, I beg your pardon?” Draco said with a puzzled expression, his eyebrows furrowing. “What language is that? I only know French.”
The Dursleys were much meaner than they were in Harry's third year. Abusing was all they did to him, whether it was something little or big that he did. Like if he didn't hang out the washing, didn't clean the dishes right, burnt food, didn't clean the entire house.
"There are two ways you can play spin the bottle," Harry explained but thought of the most common way to play it. Especially with Draco. "It's basically a game with a group of people and you place an empty bottle in the middle of the group. You spin it and whoever the bottle faces you must kiss them. The other way is when the bottle faces you, you must do a dare from the person who spun it. And Kiss, Marry, or kill is when someone gives you three names and you have to choose to kiss one of them, marry the other, and kill the last. For example, if you gave me Ron, Hermione, and Ms Norris as the three names. I would say..." God this is tough. "I would Marry Hermione, Kiss Ron, and kill Ms Norris."
Ron's ears turned a dark shade of red. What is Malfoy getting up to... "Yes, of course!"
"Ah, I see." Silence had crowded the space among Harry and Fred for a moment. "Did you want to test that theory then, Harry?" Fred then asked with a challenging smile, lightly licking his lips.
Ron, who just flew out of the room with Blaise on the back of his broom noticed Harry and Malfoy fall off their broom. He smirked when seeing Malfoy fall on top of Harry, so close to his face like they were about to kiss. He stopped in mid-air, cupped his hands over his mouth and shouted, "Oi! 'Mione! Look! You better have 10 galleons ready because my bet will be happening soon. Just look at Harry and Malfoy!"
"Yeah?" Draco asked in a bubbly tone. He stared at his hands like they were somewhat interesting to look at. He missed the feeling of Harry's warm hand touching his. It just felt so right, so soft, so wanted to be his.
Draco smiles and hands his father his books, and gave him a stern look to hold them or else. He ignored his father's rolling his eyes, and he pulled Harry into a hug. "I hope your week brings you joy and yes, I hope to see you at the train. Oh, and..." He leans away from the hug only slightly and reaches for Harry's hand.
"Don't push your luck, Ivy," Draco says and turns around when he reaches the entrance into the boy's dormitory hallway. "You better be up by 7 in the morning for our shopping spree or I'm leaving you with Pansy. You know exactly what she's like when she misses out on shopping."
"Thanks, Draco." Harry pondered if he'll get told off for wearing non-Gryffindor clothes. Maybe he won't be recognized? Hah... Pretty unlikely. Everyone just needs to see his scar and that's it for him. once dressed, he made sure everything fitted, which it all pretty much did. A perfect fit.
Draco tried to cover his blushing face, but it was no use. At least the only person who saw his blush was Ivy and nobody else. "Anyway, have you ever noticed how he's changed since our second year?" he asked as he knew Harry's demeanour has changed to something quite... alarming. He's worried for his crush's heath.
George Weasley, with bed head, stood in front of Harry tiredly. He had to admit that George looked kind of hot with his hair standing up at funny ends. "Thank you!" the Weasley brother said quickly, rushed into the bathroom and locked the door behind him.
"See you in Herbology and Potions I guess," Harry said with that forced smile which he hoped was enough to fool him. He didn't like this any more than he had. Spending a minute or two with an adult was stressful, and he knew he'd be hit with the 'are you okay' question a lot.
"Mm-hmm!" Joslyn teased them and smiled at the two. "You really should, though. I believe you would be an amazing and adorable couple. Don't you think so, Hermione?" she asked the other girl but didn't look at her. Instead, she was making a heart shape with her hands at the two boys.
When Ron gave Harry a small smile back, Seamus slid down the seat of the table to them, smirking at the conversation he and Dean heard. "So, Harry, who's top and who's bottom?" he suddenly asked, leaning closer to the three. "With you and Draco, I mean."
Harry shook his head at Fred, gave him a frown, and quickened his pace, catching up to George in a second. George looked back at Harry who was catching up to him quickly. "Hey there, little brother. Who do you think will win? Gred or me?"
He checked the time with a "Tempus!". He could not believe his eyes. It was 10:00 already? Unless he and Ron went down for an early breakfast... Yeah, that must be it! Time flies fast when you are having fun. No wonder the time was so slow at the Dursleys. The only things that made the time fly by were the chores he was instructed to do. But it did not matter, as long as he was working hard on something as it always took his mind off his depression and everything else.
When he finished, he went back down into the dormitory and decided to 'do a Hermione' and read his new textbooks for the year. He thought it would be good to know what he is up against throughout the year.
"Dobby and his friends know everything, sir," said Dobby with a wry smile. Then he shrugged as he said, "Dobby and his friends are used to it. Dobby and other house-elves have been apart of at least one Pureblood family. House-elves know what baby-making is." Then he grinned at the Slytherin. "Dobby has seen how Mister Draco Malfoy was made. But Dobby didn't stay long. Dobby left and continued doing Dobby's chores around the house while Mister Draco Malfoy was being made by Mistress Narcissa Malfoy and Master Lucius Malfoy."
As much as he'd love to tell Pansy all about the dancing with Harry, he still had thoughts running through his brain. If anything had happened to her, he didn't know what he would do with himself. He couldn't lose Ivy; she was his sister more than a cousin. "The only thing it could have been would be feeling alone and left out, especially when she made us dance with who we wanted to dance with. She wanted us to be happy, that's why she helped us. Knowing her low self-esteem, she'd be doubting herself right now and that is why we need to find her before..."
Cho raised an eyebrow at her best friend. She knew about Draco's crush on Harry as she could easily see it but didn't know about Harry's crush back on the Slytherin. The Slytherin was honestly like a girl and how they show their signs of having a crush on a guy. "Wait... So, you're saying Harry likes Draco more than a best friend?" she asked him carefully, and her eyebrow seemed to raise a little higher at the obvious look on her friend's face.
Harry did a quick 'Tempus' and it told him it was nearly 4:00 PM. Time really does fly when you're having fun or with people. "Well, I guess I have to go now," he said and sounded like he didn't want to go at al and that was true. He didn't want to go at all, but he had a dorm mate to talk with, so he got up from his seat and went over to Draco.
What happens if Draco never ran off into the Forbidden Forrest during their first year? What would Harry and Draco discover with each other and these ... feelings?
Fred sighed with defeat and replied with, "Truth." Easy peasy. But he wants to know who Harry's crush is. It's a must-know.
Seamus and Neville also placed their wands up at Draco's throat. "We mean it, Draco," Neville finally spoke instead of having Dean and Seamus say anything for him.
Padma and Lisa both rolled their eyes at the strange Ravenclaw girl and backed away from her thinking that her weirdness is contagious.
