By lunch he was squinting at his food with one eye open due to the sharp throbbing pain in his temple. He shot a glance at Harry and saw him laughing with the other Gryffindors. Weasley seemed to be re-enacting something that everyone was actively listening to. Draco stabbed at his salad, utterly annoyed that he was the only one that had apparently been plagued with nightmares.
Harry stared at him, mouth agape, “Snape is your godfather?” He finally burst and Draco laughed at the sheer indignation.
Thank you for the amazing words and comments last chapter and in this story. Let me know (without being overly mean please, I'm sensitive) how you felt about this chapter. Love you all!
“I figured out how to keep you from drowning!” Draco said pulling away so as to not make Pansy feel completely awkward.
Draco smiled “Sap,” He commented fondly. “I’ve had a question for quite some time but I imagine you aren’t going to want to answer it.”
“At least we aren’t freezing our arses off this time,” Draco commented as Fleur disappeared into the hedges.
Harry felt badly that Draco was leaving everything he knew just to be by Harry’s side, but the selfish part of him was so thankful he didn’t have to go back to the Dursleys alone again. The anger he had felt during the school year so often had multiplied and mutated. Harry constantly felt angry or sad, with barely any in between. His mind just kept replaying the night in the graveyard over and over. The look on Cedric’s face…
Draco’s lips were pulling into a thinner and thinner line as Harry told his story; he finally let out a breath and forced a smile, “I owe Theo a great deal then. You did the right thing; he would not want it publicised that he helped you. I will make sure he is aware how thankful you and I are. I would be worried about the Beauxbatons students identifying him, but my guess is they won’t be on campus long enough to say anything. How many were there?”
“I know what you mean,” Draco agreed, his mind briefly wandering to the pile of letters slowly amassing in his trunk. Draco forced himself to not become preoccupied by them and refocused on the green eyes staring down at him at that moment. “But in my completely unbiased opinion, Weasley wasn’t exactly the best of mates to you this year either. He deserves to be ignored for a bit.”
Harry clawed at his chest, ripping his shirt open, he felt like his entire soul-mark was on fire. It dully reminded him of the pain he had felt when the Basilisk had bitten him. Like an inferno had sparked from the sun on his chest and was threatening to spread to the rest of his body.
“That oaf, Hagrid, was chatting my ear off; I was worried he would report me for being out on the grounds, so I had to let him.” Theo was glad Pansy seemed to have caught on.
Draco moved forward and carefully pressed Harry’s glasses to his face, Harry blinked a few times before a small appreciative smile was aimed at Draco.
Ron had been trying his best to make up for his lack of friendship the last couple weeks. Harry was happy to have him back, but the betrayal still stung a bit. The only upside was that Ron was not questioning Harry whenever he decided to ‘go for a walk’. He desperately wished he could clue in Ron about Draco, but he wasn’t ready yet. He knew Ron would not take it as well as Hermione had.
Draco froze. He had been sure that he had been blocking Harry from feeling that. He had also hoped Hermione wouldn’t say anything. He would have to investigate his mental shields soon. “Did Hermione say something?”
A few moments after he heard the ward’s door swing shut after Draco, they flew open again and Hermione and Ron quickly appeared inside the curtains.
A few moments later the fire changed colour again, Dumbledore caught the slip of fancy paper, “The Beauxbatons’ champion is Fleur Delacour!” An absolutely gorgeous girl got up from the sea of powder blue uniforms and practically floated from the hall. Draco had the distinct impression she was part Veela.
Draco winced at his slip up, refusing to look at the now silent Matron. He knew he would see pity if he did.
"No one is going anywhere, Harry," Hermione said, shooting a look at Weasley, her face softening when she looked back towards Harry.
Harry was resolutely staring at his plate, doing his best not to get pulled into the siblings’ argument.
“Crouch attempted to finish what the Dark Lord started tonight. He sneaked Potter away while we were distracted. We have him apprehended and the real Moody is safe. Potter has been though a great deal. It seems the Cup was a Portkey, as you suspected. When Potter and Diggory grabbed it, it transported them to a location where the Dark Lord was reborn.”
Harry laughed out loud, and Draco softened at the sheer relaxation and joy on his face. “Fine, but close your eyes.”
“Blimey, what happened to Malfoy?” Ron asked and Harry was relieved Hermione spoke up. He didn’t think he could answer Ron’s question without betraying himself.
Next chapter is an intense one! This one was sort of set up for it. I promise to update soon!! Let me know your thoughts!!
“So what does that mean?” Harry asked, perplexed. Draco and Hermione were staring at each other, seemingly having come to the same conclusion.
"You were limping; don’t tell me you're fine! If you're allowed to be concerned about me, I can be concerned about you." Harry crossed the room peering into the cauldron, and peeked at Malfoy from the side of his eye.
“Thanks,” Draco sneered, snatching the book from him and paging through it idly. Longbottom stood there for a moment, looking lost, before he squeaked and left. Draco leafed through the pages realizing the book focused on different ingredients found in Herbology often used in Potions.
Harry had pretty much decided to just live in the bathroom until his neck healed when there was a series of knocks on the door. Harry ignored the knocks, staring at the door with wide eyes, hoping they would just go away.
Harry sighed, “That’s like if I judged all wizards on the actions of, like, Voldemort, or something.”
“It’s not worth repeating, it was homophobic. He should know better than to talk like that around me. Obviously, I’ve never come out officially to any of them, but it’s one of those unspoken things. I could have gotten back at him publicly and no one would have questioned it. He’s been away from high society too long; he’s forgetting his manners. His mother would curse his tongue if she knew what he said. I just didn’t feel like dealing with him being pouty towards me.”
Harry, on the other hand, was the most at ease before a task, thus far. He had seen Harry walking the grounds with Mrs. Weasley and William Weasley, and had felt nothing but joy filtering through the bond. Draco had seen the other champions with their families and was happy the two Weasleys had come to support Harry. Better them than the damn Muggles.
The twins were more serious than Harry had ever seen them; they quickly grabbed his shoulder and Hermione’s and shoved them out of the tent. Outside, it was absolute madness. People were running around, screaming, fires had broken out around the campground, and smoke filled the air. Harry looked up and saw the campground manager’s family spinning high above the ground.
“Merlin, watch where you’re going!” Malfoy whipped around as Harry stumbled again, his hands shooting out to catch Harry before he could shove into him again. Harry’s eyes flew open at Malfoy’s hands grasped the bare-skin of his biceps. A searing hot pain flashed across his chest and his eyes flew up to see Malfoy’s grey eyes widening as well. One of his hands released Harry and flew to grab his own chest, a hiss of pain sneaking past his lips.
Draco took a bite of food, sneaking a look over at the Gryffindors, Harry was sitting next to Weasley chewing idly, looking exhausted.
The Canary explosion the following morning pretty much washed all talk of Draco or Lucius from the school. Everyone was instead marvelling over the magical brilliance of the Weasley twins. Blaise Zabini had returned to his normal self at dinner time. Harry was still wondering what Zabini had done to piss them twins off so badly, but wasn’t too bothered about the Slytherin’s misfortune.
“Yeah, I’m fine, felt like a Blasting Curse,” Harry said, accepting Longbottom’s hand as he helped him to his feet, rubbing his ribs as he did. Draco wished he could do the same. He was struggling to keep his composure.
“I told you my aunt and uncle didn’t like me. My uncle hates me. He never wanted to take me in, but Dumbledore somehow got Aunt Petunia to agree. Uncle Vernon has never been shy taking out his frustrations on me. Sometimes he goes too far. They never punish Dudley for doing the same thing to me either. I was Dudley’s personal punching bag for a time.”
“I wonder how he did it,” Theo said casting a look over his shoulder at Harry. Draco was grateful to be able to look over at the Gryffindor table uninhibited. Harry looked up at him, probably noticing the group of Slytherins staring.
“What happened to him? Why can’t I feel him?” Draco demanded. Harry looked to be asleep. His eyes were shut and hands folded carefully across his stomach. He had a couple of cuts marring his face, a split lip, and a bruise along his cheekbone that Draco suspected would be a black eye come morning. There was a distinct impression and slice in the bruise that looked as if the person who had hit him had been wearing a ring of some sort. Draco felt his blood boil.
“How does it sound so pretentious from the Beauxbatons students, and so, not, when it’s from you?” Harry mumbled before hauling himself upwards and attaching his lips to Draco’s.
“I’m not up to his standards, so he reminded me of my place. Nothing I’m not used to. It’s fine. You absolutely need to go. I’m well enough to get back to the Castle. Go find Harry. I’ll go to the classroom,” Draco said abruptly, like he didn’t like the words coming out of his mouth. “Please,” He tacked on after a brief pause and Hermione realized how completely miserable Draco sounded. All of his bravado and swagger had completely disappeared. She didn’t want to leave him alone like this, but knew how infrequently Draco said ‘please’ to people. He really needed a moment alone.
Hermione took a sip of her drink, then the two of them startled as a loud noise echoed behind them. Ron had jumped down onto the landing, making a bang. Harry turned around and Ron stared at his arm around Hermione’s shoulders.
Harry’s head snapped up and he stared incredulously at Draco. “You and Hermione, and I guess Dumbledore, might be the only ones in the school who believe me.”
The other part that bothered him was that Malfoy hadn't even been the one making fun of Ron, which was out of character within itself. Harry found it hard to believe he would have cursed Harry or Ron with their backs turned. Malfoy was at least always up front about their confrontations.
“Get Draco inside the Castle, Severus!” Dumbledore commanded and Severus instantly hauled Draco to his feet and pulled him towards the Castle. The pain abated and only residual pain in his arm and leg throbbed besides the now permanent headache.
Draco had wracked his brain for any solution and had only come to exactly one option, but wasn’t sure if it would fix things or make everything blow up. He was waiting in the classroom one last time before he doomed himself to the only solution he could think of. Finally, hours later, he slowly made his way back to the Slytherin Common Room. He wasn’t exactly sure what time it was, it was getting hard to get his brain to focus on anything besides Harry. He had tried to cast a
“Stop saying things are fucking fine!” Malfoy burst; he pointed his wand at a rock and watched as it exploded. A fine dust blew past Harry’s cheek.
Hermione immediately began hurrying towards the Castle again, at double the pace. “I didn’t know. I thought it was just the cut on his cheek that was hurting him.”
Draco thumbed across Harry’s cheek, “I’m a little obsessed with you, if you haven’t noticed. What’s yours then? Red?”
“Admittedly, I am appreciative of your help with the issue. There are not many people who could make the Minister listen to reason,” Dumbledore agreed and Draco shrugged.
At this point the rest of the Fourth year Slytherins were staring at Draco, waiting for him to speak.
“Well I suppose my parents thought it was the best, that and Dumbledore insists I go back every summer.”
When Draco woke again, the ward was flooded with muted light. He squinted upwards and realized Madam Pomfrey had filtered the sun from flooding the ward. Presumably for Harry’s visitors to be able to catch some much-needed rest. Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be found, but the school-age Weasleys and Hermione were all in various positions of slumber. In the far corner, Ginny and Luna were leaning against each other. Draco had no idea when the small Ravenclaw had been able to sneak into the ward. As he glanced at them, Luna smiled serenely at him, running her fingers through Ginny’s hair.
“Do you, er, know why you’re here?” Draco asked hesitantly, worry filling his eyes. His hand linking with Harry’s again.
Harry was impressed by the effort Ron was putting in towards his friendships with the Slytherins. Harry supposed now being bonded to one helped. Hermione, Ron, and Pansy had been slowly but surely getting to know one another more. Unfortunately, the timing of summer hols hadn’t helped. It hadn’t even been 48 hours since they had bonded. Hopefully Draco would be able to get his license to Apparate and then things would be easier. Pansy would also be able to freely use the Floo to get to the Weasleys, it was just a matter of her parents allowing her to. Draco had said that her parents would not be pleased she bonded with a Bloodtraitor and a Muggleborn. Harry had asked if Pansy could do the same thing Draco had done. Unfortunately, along with being bigoted, Pureblood culture was also very misogynistic. Pansy would not be able to take on the Head due to her being female.
Harry grinned, he noticed now the anxiety flowing through the bond. He rubbed his mark, and did his best to send soothing feelings Draco’s way.
Draco smirked now, leaning into the ice pack and Harry’s hand. “I’m not particular about what it looks like if it gets the job done.”
"Look Weasley, obviously we have never gotten along, but things change. I was a right prat before and I'm still a 'pompous arsehole' now, but Harry is my soul-mate. I love him and will continue to do so. I'll be by his side until he sends me away and even then, I will fight tooth and nail until he takes me back. We kept things quiet to keep the two of us safe, as I said, but obviously that all went to shit tonight. Voldemort is fucking back, and we almost
The "Set Lucius on Fire and Make Him Walk Across Legos" club meets on Tuesdays at seven :P That chapter was hard to write, I'm not gonna lie, I hope I did okay. Lots of character changes for Draco. We're actually getting kind of close to the end here. I don't quite know how many chapters, but she's within sight!
“Good. I must go. Do not worry for me. I will contact you when I am able. For future reference, my Patronus is a doe. Please have Potter teach you the Charm as soon as he is back on his feet. You will need to know it.”
“It’s massive,” Remus remarked and Sirius smirked and nodded, waggling his eyebrows. Remus rolled his eyes.  “I wonder why he hasn’t said anything.”
“A proper couch to snog on,” Pansy clarified, flourishing her wand.  A wide and plush green couch materialized where a desk had been. “It obviously won’t last more than a couple days, but I’m sure either of you are capable of renewing the spell.”
“How long does Potter normally make you wait before he shows up?” She asked, charming a chair to be more her style and more cushioned.
“Yup,” Harry popped the last letter, slightly pleased by the sheer irritation on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy sighed before glancing around and sitting down next to Harry. His fingers tracing paths in the mix of soil and sand, he was silent for awhile, waiting for Harry to speak.
Draco blinked at her, but did as he was told. Blaise would pay later for what he had said that he was sure of.
“You’re absolutely useless, how have you survived this long?” Malfoy sighed before checking around the side of the tree and dragging Harry back onto the trail where a large mass of people were shoving their way through. Malfoy had Harry’s forearm in a death grip as he quickly cut his way through the crowd. Harry idly wondered how one fostered such a skill; Malfoy was incredibly good at getting where he wanted to quickly.
Draco was making his way  across the grounds to his seat with Pansy and Theo on either side of him. He, Harry, and Hermione had been up until two in the morning practicing Summoning Spells in the abandoned classroom. It was the only way Harry would be able to get his broom to the task. Harry had finally seemed to get the hang of it before they called it, but Draco was still terrified something would go wrong. The only thing helping him from completely losing it was the evidence that Harry did extraordinary feats of magic when he was stressed out or running on adrenaline, which he no doubt would be when faced with a mother dragon.
Did I spend 10 minutes trying to figure out when it's appropriate to use 'whom' over 'who', yes. Did that at all clarify my question about it in this chapter, no. So if I dropped a who where a whom is more appropriate, forgive me. I teach elementary school and there are definitely still moments when I feel completely out of my depth, who vs whom is one of them.
“That’s rubbish,” Draco sighed, like it was the worst news he had ever heard. “Oi, Potter, best hope that this task has nothing to do with Potions.”
Draco felt eyes and whispers follow him as they moved towards the Great Hall. The whispers increased tenfold as they entered. Draco strode towards their table with confidence. He had barely began steeping his tea when Severus placed a hand on his shoulder and practically drug him from the Hall.
“You all coming to breakfast?” He asked and they scrambled to follow him. Definitely eager to see reactions. They met Pansy in the Common Room. Her eyes bulged at the sight of him.
“You sound funny, Pans. Pants. Pants?” Draco slurred, marvelling at the way the words felt in his mouth.
Harry lay back onto his bed, staring at the ceiling, the last thing he needed this year was more excitement.
“Don’t be, look, stop.” Malfoy settled his hand over Harry’s making his fingers release the small roots, and Harry froze. “What can I do?”
“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Draco burst. His wand already twirling viciously in his hand, sparks flying off the end.
“I love you so fucking much, Harry James Potter,” He declared, bringing his lips to press against Harry’s forehead before returning to his mouth again.
Draco was having difficulty even keeping a straight face and keeping up the charade with Weasley. Why wasn’t Harry saying anything? Why did it still feel like he wasn’t even in the same room as him? All Draco could feel was that weird cut off exhausted feeling. Even when Harry was sleeping, he normally expressed some emotions, this wasn’t that feeling. Draco was barely keeping the panic from completely taking over. He was glad he had concocted a lie having to do with his ribs, because his breathing was coming out in harsh gasps.
His eyes focused on Draco’s neck just as Hermione spoke, “Those are quite some love bites Malfoy has. Harry could you pass me the sugar?”
“You need the post-Cruciatus potion,” Hermione piped up. She had read all about the Three Unforgiveables after their class with Moody. It had specifically said that to ensure lack of nerve or brain damage, taking the potion within 90 minutes of exposure would greatly increase recovery of the victim.
Draco bit his lip, feeling tears welling up once again, but forced them back down. He absolutely would not cry right now.
“Oh!” Pansy hastened her pace, “Hurry up then. You’ve been stashing him away for far too fucking long.”
“Oh you two are absolutely unbearable. Merlin Draco I’m glad to see you happy but this is just downright sickening,” Pansy complained and Draco stuck his tongue out at her.
Draco glared at the back of Harry’s head; they were back in the dungeons, unfortunately for Potions class and not their extracurricular meetings.
“Put down he was sick, whatever, just please leave our marks out of it. Please Madam Pomfrey. The danger he’d be in...” Harry trailed off. “Imagine what Lucius Malfoy could do with the information. Please.” Harry pulled out every option he could think of.
“I wouldn’t miss it,” Draco promised, leaning down and pressing his lips to Harry’s forehead, then ducking further and pressing his lips to Harry’s before straightening. He quickly buttoned Harry’s top and squeezed his hand once before disappearing through the curtains. Harry sighed, plopping his head back against the pillows. He could hear Pomfrey escorting Draco out and was once again thankful about how helpful she had been towards the pair of them. Harry didn’t know what Draco would have done if she hadn’t covered for him. Hopefully Hermione would have helped someway.
Draco sighed, but again forced a smile, “I appreciate it, but Father has made up his mind. Nothing I say or do is going to make him happy. I won’t allow him to figure out about my soul-mate, I assure you.”
“Well at least you are prepared to protect yourself in all aspects of the word, at any rate,” Dumbledore responded after a few moments of silence.
Draco was sure he had never paced as much as he had in recent months. It felt like he was constantly pacing. He hadn’t been able to see Harry since the task and he had finally gotten time to make it to the classroom close to the Gryffindor Common Room. He had seen that Harry was okay in classes, and it seemed the school was back to (for the most part) loving Harry again, but Draco was still very anxious. He just needed to see Harry for himself, without the distraction of their peers, and then he would get back to normal.
“You’ve been getting angry more often than you used to,” Draco commented simply, without any accusation.
Draco released one of his hands, and tugged Harry’s collar to the side. He planted his palm across the span of Harry’s mark. “This is mine,” Draco said fiercely.  He grabbed Harry’s hand and tugged his shirt to the side as well and pushed Harry’s hand against his moon. “This is yours.”
“Get up here,” Draco whispered, moving to the side so Harry could fit next to him. Harry did as he was asked, pulling Draco against him.
“Is this what you prefer? Do I have to manhandle you, for you to take me seriously?” Malfoy grit out, hands fisted in the front of Harry robes.
"Not so fun being the uninjured party is it?" Draco taunted, packing up some of his supplies. Harry noticed the potion was gradually changing from a slate gray to a green colour.
"Don’t get your knickers in a twist," Harry mocked him, pulling out the map and checking it. "There are some prefects about to pass your house, but other than that your path is clear. Pansy is pacing in your Common Room."
“Thanks. I was coming back from training and then out of nowhere some of the boys from Beauxbatons grabbed me. They took my wand and put me in a body bind. Of course, my wandless magic was fucking useless without you there. At that point I figured the only way I was getting out of it was if you felt it somehow. Then they beat me up a little bit and said some bullshit about me not deserving to be a champion, like I even wanted to in the first fucking place, and then they used Crucio,” He took a deep breath, remembering the sheer agony he had been in.
“It’s all rubbish as I said, but the Potters weren’t because it’s also a popular muggle surname, and they are too pro-Muggle. I also personally think it has to do with the fact that the Potters were a massive Indian line, and the wizard that created the list was racist and petty. There were all of these trade issues back then; I don’t feel like getting into it. Most of the old families still found the Potter name to be a respectable family until your father married your mother. Another huge part of the Sacred 28 is the pure magical power each of the families has. It’s part of the reason why my Father probably wouldn’t consider a serious marriage with Pansy and me. The Parkinsons have never been the most powerful of wizards and witches. The Weasleys are even known to have more power than they are, which is obvious if you look at any of them. I will give them that. But obviously, the Potters are insanely powerful, as was your mother so in terms of power you would be a ‘respectable’ match. If you weren’t male my Father would probably even consider it after some convincing.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, using a twig to poke holes into the pattern he had drawn. “I see, thank you, that completely clears everything up.”
Thank you all so much for the astounding reaction last chapter. It has definitely helped me get through the past few days of absolute shit-show here in the US. Also, very much gave my ego a stroke knowing yall liked my fave quote as much as I did. Any guesses on who the next soul-mate bonding will be? I'll give you a teeny hint and tell you that both characters are named characters within the HP universe. I can't wait until we get there. Thank you times a million again. I hope everyone is staying safe and sane. Take time for self-care, turn off social media, whatever you have to do. I love you all, see you Monday.
“Did that seriously just happen?” Ginny asked, her eyes switching between Ron, Hermione, and the door.
Draco straightened his robes and tidied his hair. He knew that Harry preferred when he wore it loose, but had to do something more than his normal every day hair style. He had settled on tousling it in the way that it sometimes looked after he had been flying, somewhat slicked back but also loose. He knew he had done the right thing when he went to retrieve Pansy from the girl’s dormitories.
Draco says "I speak French" and then "You like that?" at least that's what Google says. Sorry if I'm butchering things I don't speak a lick of French.
Draco had hoped the Second Task would be simpler and less anxiety inducing, but feeling what Harry was going through but not knowing what was happening was worse.
Draco sighed, looking briefly down at the snow at their feet, before bringing his head back up - a practiced smile on his face. “I appreciate it, but Father has made up his mind. Nothing I say or do is going to make him happy. I won’t allow him to figure out about my soul-mate. I assure you.”
“Rules are rules, Mr. Weasley. Your friend needs rest, you can visit again in the morning. I assure you I will take the best care of him I am capable.”
“Nott saved me, Draco. I don’t know what he did but one moment I was being cursed and the next moment he’s leaning over top of me looking scared out of his mind. He didn’t know where to take me, but I was able to get him to take me to Hagrid’s. He left me there, worried that Hagrid would assume he’d done that to me. I asked him why he saved me and all he said was ‘you know why’. I told Dumbledore as much as I could remember about the boys who attacked me, but I didn’t say anything about Nott. I didn’t think I should, is that okay?”
“The Durmstrang champion is Viktor Krum!” Dumbledore’s voice rang out and Draco clapped, Blaise elbowed him, cheering as well.
“Fine, just let me pack up here, I’ll be along in just a few minutes.” Draco hoped they would leave him to it.
Hermione nodded, they were finally past the village, and she felt the anxiety settling back in now that they were getting closer to the Castle.
“Who’s ruffled his feathers?” Draco asked and everyone around him laughed. They were just about to get up to leave when Hercules soared down and landed neatly in front of him. Draco plucked the note from his leg. “Get going Hercules, you don’t want any of this food.”
Harry was silent for awhile, his quill was still, Draco wanted to revoke his question, but part of him needed to know. He had always thought Harry grew up spoilt and pampered, but things didn’t line up.
It was a testament to their friendship that Ron was being as polite as possible, it also took Harry practically biting his tongue off not to make a comment about ‘the fun night’ Hermione had.
They kissed!! Woo!! Please keep in mind as we move forward with their romantic relationship that these boys are 14. I also try to keep in mind that legal age is 17 in the Wizarding world so it's more like our world equivalent of two 15 year olds. Just a like, note.
Malfoy cut him off, “We both know what happened earlier,” He pulled at the collar of Harry’s shirt, exposing the sun tattoo. Simultaneously he pulled down on his own collar and the corner of an elaborate moon, made up of blues, purples, and even yellows around the rim, peeked into view. “We don’t have time right now. Just get out of here, it’s not safe. We’ll speak more at Hogwarts.”
“You are dismissed,” Severus intoned, and Draco got to his feet, packing up as slowly as possible. His plan worked as Harry left the room flanked by the rest of the Trio, ahead of him. Draco waited until they were out in the corridor before pointing his wand at Harry’s bag and casting his spell.
Draco had been very relieved when he had heard the next task wasn’t for a couple months. He needed the time to catch his breath after the absolutely insane last couple months.
Draco nodded, he was sitting up completely in bed now, most of the colour had returned to his skin. “Yeah, a lot better."
“Like your godfather’s mate did not show you outright favouritism constantly? He never let you get away with anything? I highly doubt it!”
Soul-mate bonds were some of the weirdest magic that Harry had encountered since finding out he was a wizard. There was no precursor to two people becoming soul-mates. Sometimes it was between friends, but sometimes it was between two complete strangers. Or two nemeses, Harry added as an afterthought, his mind straying to his apparent bond mate.
Dumbledore had just announced to the school how three Beauxbatons’ students were caught the night before after assaulting a Triwizard Champion. He had openly stated how one of the students was already on the way to Azkaban after use of an Unforgiveable was proven by his wand. The other two students who aided him had been expelled from Beauxbatons, had their wands snapped, and were already back in France where they were now forced to stay.
“Draco, what are you doing up here? We’ve all been searching for you,” Pansy called, running down the corridor. Draco was leaning against a wall, not quite able to support himself with how exhausted he felt. He felt like every cell in his body weighed as much as a dragon. His chest was on fire, although the rest of his body was freezing.
Without a word, Harry reached down and grabbed a pillow that had been half-shoved underneath the couch. In one fluid motion he brought it up towards Draco and by the time it had made the two-foot journey it was transfigured into an ice pack similar to the one’s she had grown up getting from her mother.
“So what spells are there to allow Harry to swim better, or dive farther?” Hermione asked, smiling at the two of them.
Harry stared at Malfoy, he looked much the same as he did at the match, except he was wearing a different set of robes. Harry couldn’t comprehend how he was wearing two long sleeved layers of fabric in this heat.
Hermione was confused, Harry couldn’t heal things. She was also still having trouble wrapping her mind around the fact that Draco’s father had done this to him.
“Come on, love,” Draco said carefully reaching his arm under Harry’s arm and helping him to his feet. Harry went with him with no restraint.
Draco hoped Pomfrey would heal them soon, having two red eyes stare at you was disconcerting to say the least. She had said she was waiting for Harry’s mind to heal before attempting any superficial healing.
Draco was successful in dragging a quiet chuckle out of Harry at that comment and was able to pull the rest of Harry’s disgusting kit off and get him under the spray of water.
“Your bond was going into rejection wasn’t it? That’s why he was so sick! Harry that’s so dangerous! You both could have gotten so hurt!”
Draco was pretty sure his nails, regardless of how blunt he kept them, were going to shred the palms of his hands where he kept them clenched and hiding in his pockets. Sure enough when he saw and felt the pain of the dragon’s tail hitting Harry, his nails cut into his palms, Draco couldn’t inhale a breathe as he tried to gauge how badly Harry was injured. Shortly after Harry finally achieved his prize and flew away with the golden egg under his arm. Excitement and happiness clear emotions on his face and coming through the bond as he was dismissed from the task.
*Insert 1 million crying emojis* It's done everyone. I literally cannot believe I have clicked finished on this fic. I feel like we were just at the Cup! Seriously you all have become my own little family and I love you dearly. Thank you for sticking with me through this adventure, for giving feedback and endless encouragement, for loving these characters as much if not more than I do. I promise the next installment will begin posting soon. I hope you will all join me there. I already started writing and it's so much fun to be quite different than the books. It will be a whirlwind for sure!
Draco laughed, “Yes well. Harry seems to really like him, so there must be something there. One out of two isn’t bad, at the very least.”
Finally, they made it inside, which was thankfully mostly empty with almost everyone above 3rd year down at the village. They made it to the classroom Draco and Harry met in often, Harry quickly casting the spells that barred the door, and burst through. Hermione followed quickly, shutting the door and locking it behind her.
Father set a firm hand on Draco’s shoulder, tossed a handful of gold onto the table, and steered Draco out of the pub. Draco knew there was no use resisting. Father would make sure he left, whether he liked it or not, and Draco wasn’t keen on being Imperiused today if he could help it.
“I made fun of you for that, constantly! I dressed up like a bloody Dementor to distract you. I was essentially making fun of you for being upset you heard your parents dying. That doesn’t strike you as something I should be cursed for? Fuck, how are we soul-mates?” He scrubbed his hands over his face, ending with his hands clutched in his hair.
“It’s Malfoy, isn’t it?” She asked and Harry nodded dumbly. He knew she had already figured it out. “When did this happen?”
“Of course he is, probably to lecture me about my last potion. Someone here got me distracted,” Draco pinched Pansy’s side and carefully slid her off of his lap. “I ought to go now so he doesn’t make a scene tomorrow.”
Sirius returned shortly after escorting Harry back to the Castle, he quickly transformed back into his human self, helping Remus mend a few broken objects from the training session.
Severus fixed him with a cold stare. “You know me better than that. I will forgive these transgressions due to your emotional state. If I wanted you harmed or dead, I assure you I would have already done so. I can assure you I would have done it before having to put up with this pitiful mewling. If I had been the one to orchestrate Potter’s abduction, he would not have returned. Collect your thoughts, and stay here. Do not leave until I return.” Severus thrust his wand at him and swept from the room. Draco realized the truth in Severus’ words, as much as he yearned to sprint to his soul-mate’s side.
Harry took a good look at him. Malfoy had a massive red mark covering half his face, and on both of his exposed hands and forearms were a myriad of cuts and red welts.
“Look, I am sorry I kept this from you. There was a million times I wanted to tell everyone, and it was so horrible to hide it. We kept it a secret for so long that I was afraid what would happen if I did tell you. It took
The thing about the Cruciatus is that the pain is overwhelmingly intense but only for a few seconds. Draco suspected Harry must have seriously injured his leg, perhaps broken something. The pain wasn’t abating. Harry seemed annoyed if anything, so Draco was trying not to panic too much. There was a feeling of relief through the bond before suddenly Harry’s emotions seemed far away. Further away than they ever had been. Draco tried to reach out and sense Harry’s magic but the little rainbow line was nowhere to be found.
“No, obviously, not. We shall go with my preference then, is that all right?” Luna asked and Ginny stared at her in absolute confusion.
Harry didn’t answer for a few moments, distracted by the feeling Draco was eliciting, “He, er, said that I should take the egg for a bath. Which like, I appreciate the tip, but I flat out told him what the First Task was, so this is kind of bullshit.”
Thankfully Pomfrey was standing just outside the door and handed Draco a change of clothes for Harry. Draco didn't spare a glance past her before grabbing the clothes and going back into the room.
"I promise I wouldn't offer if I didn't mean it. Here," Draco buttoned up only half of the buttons on his shirt so the majority of his mark was still visible but he wasn't walking around practically shirtless.
“I assure you I am, there’s no lasting damage. My fore arm has been twinging and my forehead, but you had to have known that. You’re feeling the pain currently!” Draco defended himself.
Draco felt what he had determined to be jealousy floating through the bond and he couldn’t help but smirk. Harry did seem to get considerably jealous over his relationship with Pansy, which was extra hilarious to Draco since he had been friends with Pansy since they were in nappies and the last thing he wanted to do was be in a relationship with her. There was also the small bit where his soul-mate was a man, but that apparently wasn’t glaring enough for Harry to comprehend. Draco was beginning to understand that he pretty much had to slap the plain facts across Harry’s face before he would grasp it. Merlin his soul-mate was so brilliant and also so fucking thick.
“We might as well wait,” Theo said hopping up onto the same table that Harry had previously been at; Draco wouldn’t be surprised if his seat was still warm.
“Look, Potter, soul-mates might just be a silly thing to you, but they mean something to me. They’re important. Do I think the universe is playing some massive joke on me, making you my soul-mate? Yes. That doesn’t change what we are.”
The rest of the weekend past without incident. Draco kept an eye for Hercules, but expected it would take at least a day for his classmates to write letters and for there to be a turnaround. Instead he busied himself with another task he had left unattended. Getting revenge on Blaise for his homophobic comment. His first instinct had been to create a potion, but Blaise knew he was the best Potion-maker in their year and would immediately suspect him. There was one other place to go, and Draco hoped they’d give him the time of day.
That was how Harry found him. Draco had been repairing the dishes for the third time and figured he wouldn’t be able to repair them again; they were barely holding on as it was.
Nott seemed to understand what he said though because realization dawned on his face, he threw Harry’s arm over his shoulder, hauling him to his feet and dragging Harry in the direction of Hagrid’s cabin.
Draco was getting increasingly worried. Harry had faded somewhat, he figured due to how far away he was, but the hour was up and the gillyweed was going to wear off. Draco swore to Merlin if Harry drowned because of Weasley he would never forgive him.
He turned around at the sound of his name and smiled at Hermione as she ducked out of the tent. Her hair was pulled back into a neat plait and her dark skin almost glowed in the bright summer sun.
Draco recognized the formal wording to her acceptance and breathed a sigh of relief. She was matriarch of the Weasley family and a Pureblood herself, so her words were binding. Draco could not be held to the wrongs Lucius had committed toward Mr. Weasley or anyone else in their family.
A few moments later a massive shark head surfaced, and Draco was shocked to see Hermione surface as well, gasping and recoiling from the shark until it morphed back into Krum’s features.
Draco took a sip of his Butterbeer, as his Father took a sip of his own drink. Draco stared at the amber liquid and wondered how awful it must taste. He preferred his own whiskey chilled on the occasion he could have it, but his Father believed clinking was improper and only drank it chilled when alone in his study. Occasionally he would cast a cooling charm on his glass, but found it burdensome to have to continue to cast it.
“Shh, it’s me,” Hermione whispered from where she hid. “I’m sorry, but I just needed to tell you something before you went down.”
Draco pressed his lips desperately to Harry’s, a feeling of absolute euphoria settling over him as Harry kissed him back. Harry’s arms came up quickly around his shoulders, hands fisting in his hair, and Draco couldn’t swallow the groan that came from him at the feeling. They kissed feverishly, warmth and pleasure flowing from where their soul marks pressed against each other. Harry’s tongue swiped across Draco’s bottom lip and a sigh escaped him.
“Thanks for the cloak, Draco,” Theo commented and Draco grinned at his friend. Theo hated to admit it, but he was often quite cold in the cool temperatures of the dungeons. The cloak was enchanted to keep the wearer warm, but the charm was concealed so that no one would take the piss for Theo needing a charmed cloak. It was uncommon for men’s cloaks to be charmed, but gold could buy you pretty much anything. Draco was happy his friend had liked the gift and not been offended; it was a testament to their friendship that he had received it well.
“Draco, what the hell happened here!? I saw your father leave the alley, but you weren’t with him. He left a trail of blood,” Hermione trailed off at the look on Draco’s face. Hermione didn’t curse often, but she just couldn’t fathom what she had stumbled upon. What sort of parent did this to their child? Hermione paused in her thoughts, her mind straying to Harry. The way he had begged her and Ron to send food and the story Ron had told her about how he and his brothers had rescued Harry from his Aunt and Uncle’s house before 2nd year, after pulling bars off of his window like he was a prisoner in his own home.
Draco shrugged, “Just seems beneath me to waste time on those that do not matter. I’d rather spend time with Pansy or in the lab with Severus.”
Harry shrugged again, breaking eye contact. “Uncle Vernon didn’t like it if I did better than Dudley.”
Hermione looked even more worried, “Of course, Harry, you know your secrets are always safe with me.”
“Then I guess there will be enchantments or something to keep him from summoning it, he’ll have to go into the Lake. Merpeople can’t leave the water all the way. If they took it, it’s in the Lake.”
Happy Monday! (at least for my other fellow North Americans) I hope you enjoyed this Drarry palooza of a chapter. Thoughts? Some explanation for the magic behind soul-bonds/soul-mates. I wasn't sure if it was clear, but basically the more they interact the stronger the bond becomes. We're learning some more about the boys, anyone catch on to each of the boys mannerisms? Did you catch them previously? I was getting conflicting answers on Draco's relationship to Sirius, so I went with the one that made sense to me. Anyone have any thoughts or questions?
“Er, did you get a hold of some punch I wasn’t aware of? I’ll be quite cross if you’ve been holding out.”
Harry smiled at him and Hermione, whom was settled on the couch next to Ron. Her hair was still smooth from the night before, and Harry could see what he had recently learned to be makeup on her neck. It was subtle and Harry suspected she had some love bites of her own. Thankfully, Ron was completely oblivious.
Harry waved his hand at him dismissively, unfolding layers on the paper before groaning loudly. “You’re definitely going to need my help; it looks like every single professor is out on patrol.”
I cannot believe how close to the end we are. I finished editing everything today (thank you President's Day for giving me a day off of work), and there is officially just one chapter left in the first installment of The Sun and The Moon. I have never completed a long fic like this before, so thank you for sticking with me and your wonderful feedback.
“What the fuck!?” Draco cursed, looking around wildly. Similar sentiments to what Draco had said were echoed up and down the table. The Gryffindors, along with most of the rest of the school were roaring with laughter. Draco briefly found Harry’s eyes, revelling in the joy lighting in them and flowing through the bond.
“Hermione wouldn’t have kept that a secret anyways! Right, Harry?” Ron asked, bumping him with his shoulder.
“Shh, Draco, it’s okay,” Harry muttered and instantly Draco relaxed. His eyes darted to Harry, confusion on his face and flowing through the bond.
Draco was going insane. It had been over a week and Draco had not been able to meet up with Harry. He had spent the entire time trying to figure out how Harry had done it; he had also tried to funnel his energy towards figuring out how to cover the soul-bond but had come up empty. Nothing in the library was very helpful, and he could not risk getting a book from the Manor without drawing attention from his parents.
I hope this chapter was everything yall hoped for, it was definitely a fun but tough chapter to write. As always thank you for everything, we're already almost at 500 kudos which just absolutely blows my mind. Also over 300 subscriptions, and about 150 bookmarks (my numbers are higher than what is shown, I'm assuming for private users). I never dreamed I would ever get a response like this one. You all make my days better.
Draco’s wand twirled in his hand viciously, sparks emitting from the tip. Draco busied himself with focusing on sending Harry soothing feelings. Harry was still overcome with despair and Draco couldn’t fathom what could be making him feel this way. He hoped Hermione or the Weasleys were with him. The pain in his leg and arm still ached.
As he stepped through, he could feel the concentration of magic around him as clearly as if there were a spiderweb of strings flowing around him. Draco focused on the feeling and suddenly he felt the residual magic of every Malfoy that had ever walked these halls. He could feel the power flowing around him from all of the witches and wizards casting around him. Draco closed his eyes, concentrating on one specific line of magic, made one thousand times easier by the fact that he was already so attuned to Harry. He placed his hand against his chest and focused as hard as he could, a thread made up of every colour of the rainbow reached out from him and away. Draco smirked, opening his eyes and followed the feeling of the magic reaching out from him. Like there were marks on the floor pointing him in the correct direction, Draco quickly and easily was able to find Harry inside the Great Hall.
Pomfrey must have sensors set up to know exactly when someone was coming or going because she materialized and opened the door. Immediately Parkinson and Nott shoved their way through followed more slowly by Crabbe and Goyle, already firing a thousand questions at Pomfrey. Harry snuck out behind them and made his way up to Gryffindor Tower. He had been surprised, but thankful, that Hermione had not been waiting for him outside the Hospital Wing. He was sure she would be waiting up in the Common Room for him though. It was still quite early, so hopefully most people would still be asleep.
The students were finally able to return inside and Draco was thankful, he was hungry and it was cold. The Durmstrang students fit their way into the Slytherin table and Draco found himself having a good time conversing with the students, most of which had pretty solid English skills. Draco looked forward to speaking to some of the Beauxbatons’ students, French was a language he could actually speak and understand.
"Ron and Hermione think I went to bed. It’s going to be annoying sneaking back in, but..." He shrugged.
Theo stretched, “Gryffindor of course, fucking Scarhead got himself into the Hospital Wing just now. He wouldn’t stop crying about it. The only thing that saved me was Snape, he was looking for you, Draco.”
“Put your hand on his chest, quickly now,” Pomfrey ordered, making elaborate moves with her wand, some potions flew from across the room and settled onto the table next to her. She thrust one at Harry, “Drink and brace yourself.” Harry did as he was told and then immediately cried out as Draco gasped beside him. His hand felt as though he had set it onto Aunt Petunia’s stove while making breakfast where he held it to Draco’s mark.
“Draco and I can tell when the other is touching their Mark. It’s more intense when you touch the other person’s. I don’t know how it will work for the three of you though.”
Harry snapped his mouth shut, "I'll be better." Annoyed at yet another thing that Malfoy just seemed to
“Well if it screeches and Diggory said to bring it into the bath my guess is merpeople. They’re the only things that make sense, plus the Lake has a tribe I think.”
“I doubt the two of us will ever be best mates but we have to at least be able to tolerate each other. I understand anyone’s apprehension about my relationship with Harry, but he’s my soul-mate and I’d do anything for him, full stop. I hope to prove to you my worthiness of Harry now that you are all aware of our relationship.” Draco said the final words of his declaration with his eyes fixed on those of the black dog taking up the foot of Harry’s bed. Sirius licked his hand and Draco wasn’t sure how he should feel about that. He was sure he would hear more from Sirius once he wasn’t bound to his Animagus form.
“Do not let Dumbledore use you to get closer to the Dark Lord. He may or may not try. No matter what he says, do not follow through. He will make it seem of the utmost importance; he will make it seem as though Potter’s life depends on it. It does not. Do not let yourself be another pawn for Dumbledore to sacrifice.”
Normally Draco ate a muffin or scone with his morning tea. Draco was largely a morning person so he was often the liveliest of his group at breakfast. Hermione noticed that for three straight breakfasts, Draco ate only half of his pastry and was significantly more muted. On the fourth day Draco received post at breakfast. On this day he only tore apart his muffin, and barely actually consumed more than  a few bites.
Harry stared, he couldn’t help it. Malfoy’s mark took up as much space as Harry's. It spanned the entire left hand side of his chest, the exact same spot as Harry’s. The moon was as detailed and elaborate as his sun. With swirls of purple and blue spiraling out from each side. Harry found himself unbuttoning the rest of his shirt as well and heard Malfoy gasp a quiet intake of breath.
“I’ll take the bloody potion if it makes you stop crying. I just don’t want to waste it. Seriously I am okay,” Draco assured them, forcing himself to sit up. He was obviously coming off as too weak, lying down. “Please don’t waste your tears on me,” He said as he wiped at Harry’s face gently.
Vivid child abuse happens in this chapter (Lucius is awful). Feel free to read until asterisk and then pick up afterwards to miss the child abuse scene.
She followed the path turning the direction the blood trailed and gasped, Draco was laying in a heap in the snow, his face covered in blood. She sprinted the rest of the way up to him, braced for the worst.
“Oh,” Mrs. Weasley looked surprised. “I imagine yesterday’s event were quite the ordeal for you, Draco. I’m sorry I didn’t realize.”
Harry understood. His mind was beginning to clear and his thoughts didn’t feel as disjointed or hard to connect.
Draco rolled his eyes, “It’s asinine to anyone under the age of 40 probably. It’s the twenty-eight ‘most pure’ Pureblood families left. It includes those who haven’t married outside of the Pureblood lines too much and respected the ideals of Pureblood custom. Technically, Weasley’s younger sister would be a suitable match as well. They’re still considered part of the 28, despite the fact that they’re considered blood-traitors now.”
“I have not dismissed you,” Dumbledore pointed out, his voice sounding on the edge of angry. Breaking his quiet, unassuming grandfather charade, for once.
“I’m not going bloody anywhere! You’re hurt!” She burst, quickly assessing him. She didn’t know what to do that wouldn’t make things worse.
Draco fought his way down the stands, desperate to find Severus, ignoring Pansy’s frantic words. He made it halfway there, his forehead stabbing with pain at intervals like the worst migraine imaginable. Harry was full of terror and then disgust. Draco could barely figure out what the emotions he was feeling were, but the pain was coming through loud and clear. He struggled his way to the bottom of the stands, despite how much he felt like he was making a massive scene, barely anyone looked his way. Everyone was more intrigued with Fleur and Krum who had just left the medical tent, making it clear that a Hogwarts Champion was guaranteed.
"Is that you? Can I feel what you're feeling? This is insane!" Harry asked, feeling even more anxiety bloom in his chest.
“Which of you cast it?!” A tall, professional looking wizard yelled at them, wand pointing directly at Harry’s face. “Who did it?!”
Harry smiled, reaching up and flipping the two of them over so Harry loomed over Draco. “Best get used to it,” He whispered, ducking his head down to Draco’s chest.
“Magic is weird,” Harry commented, chancing a quick glance over at Draco. Draco and the other fourth year Slytherins were still staring over at them, as were many eyes in the Hall. Public bondings always gathered attention. The skin around Draco's eyes softened minutely as Harry looked at him. Harry couldn’t shake the image of Ginny and Luna leaving the Hall, hand in hand. He desperately wished his bonding would have been as easy and carefree as Ginny’s.
“Because in my experience it doesn’t fucking work like that! You think the grownups will come and save you, but they don’t. You go years always feeling hungry and being hurt and you figure this must be how it is for people who look like me.
“You’ve just been sitting here like everything was fine!” Harry burst, attempting to sit up. Draco pushed him back down.
“No it’s fine, it just makes me question whose idea it was to stick you with muggles. I understand family, but this is ridiculous.”
Hermione rolled her eyes now, “Yeah, and that’s terrible, but Harry I’d rather him call me that and you, you know, not die!”
Pansy was fixing tea when he sat down and he noticed she had no other food on her plate, he leaned down nestling into her neck as if he was kissing her.
“Eventually, maybe,” Harry said, a smile in his voice. Draco knew them meeting like this so often was a bad idea, but he couldn’t stop himself from doing it. Not when he felt how much happier Harry was afterwards. It had absolutely nothing to do with how much it brightened his mood as well, none at all.
Draco dropped the two hairs into the goblet, “I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, have found and accepted my soul-mate, Harry James Potter. I vow to use my magic and life to protect and uphold the Malfoy magic, and the Potter magic. I now lend myself to your judgement.” Draco cast the end of the spell and opened up his mental shields, focusing on the goblet and dagger.
“I would thank you to not do that without my permission, Professor,” He said underneath his breath, knowing Dumbledore would hear him.
Draco snorted, “Of course she did. Pretty much every pureblood child in Slytherin, along with some other houses, wrote to their parents about it. As I expected.”
“Staring at the water, freezing my bollocks off, and feeling every little thing that happened to you but having no reference to what it may be, definitely wasn’t very fun. I have to admit.”
Draco pulled the note from Father, shoving it in his pocket before securing the new note to Hecules’ leg. “Thanks, I’ll have plenty of treats tomorrow morning at breakfast. Make sure to come,” He instructed. Hercules gave him an affectionate nip to ear before spreading his massive wings and soaring from the Owlery.
An echo of thanks rang around the room towards Draco. He had gotten each of them a gift. Draco had always been quite skilled at giving gifts, and they were the easiest way to gain someone’s trust and make them feel indebted to you. Draco also just really loved giving out presents.
“Glad to see you’re in one piece,” Pansy affirmed looking at Harry. Her gaze switched to Draco, “Hercules has already been by with a letter.”
“Would you like to explain what just happened?” She asked turning towards Harry, her tone still icy. She summoned a chair for him to settle on.
“You did it, I am so proud!” Draco smirked, and found himself unbuttoning the top of Harry’s shirt without even realizing what he was doing until Harry’s eyes were on him.
“Oh, all right,” Pansy said squinting at him but packing up her things. Vince and Greg whistled at them and Draco rolled his eyes.
Thank you for being such an amazing part of my 2020, I hope this fic has helped you through some tough times. I hope to wrap this story up soon and then move on to Year 5. Saturday is my birthday so I hope to get another chapter out then as my gift to all of  you, but we shall see how busy I get.
Tomorrow Draco would need to be strong, he would need to speak to Theo, and he may have to orchestrate the disappearance of whomever had done this to his soul-mate, but for now he let himself be overtaken by his emotions and be thankful that Harry had made it out mostly unscathed.
“They went to go grab a meal; they skipped lunch to spend time with me. Thankfully they took Pomfrey’s explanation well, mostly Pansy just yelled at me for not coming up here sooner. They won’t say it out right, but they were worried.”
“That still doesn’t solve the problem of me being able to do anything but swim the surface of the Lake. And I don’t really love the idea of losing a best mate because I failed to get them back from a tribe of merpeople!”
“It’s theorized that the larger a mark the more powerful the bond between the two people is. The more it is capable of. For instance, the marks my husband and I have are on the smaller side. It took quite awhile for us to be able to sense one another’s emotions, and even now we can only send very simple messages to each other when we’re apart. The marks the two of you have are quite large, I imagine you share your emotions quite easily. However, this is all theory. Just because a mark is small does not mean it is inconsequential, there are exceptions to every rule.”
Next chapter we're back with Draco's perspective! I hope you all enjoyed some Draco and Hermione interaction! Thank you for the wonderful feedback as usual. We also will be getting a bunch of really exciting stuff next chapter! I promise. It's the best one yet. (In my opinion anyways) Any guesses as to what? (**Spoiler Alert**: At least one more person finds out about our fave soulmates)
“I’m sure I have no idea what you’re on about,” He smirked and dropped some ingredients into his cauldron.
“Er, I lost my wand,” Harry said quickly, embarrassment flooding his body. Both of their heads whipped up as a loud explosion echoed across the sky.
“Why suffer ourselves when we can make others do it?” Draco asked. “Honestly Weasel, can you even read?” He asked as Ron once again was about to add the wrong thing.
Sirius nodded, “I can imagine any son and only heir of Lucius Malfoy is going to be raised in the typical Pureblood fashion.”
"I hope he's okay," Hermione said, shooting a look at Harry who was still silent. Two weeks ago Harry might have been laughing with Ron, but it had looked absolutely painful what Moody had done to Malfoy. Harry was slightly disgusted with himself that he would have ever laughed at something like that. Harry couldn’t imagine how he would feel if he was transfigured into some sort of animal and made to perform in front of his classmates.
“I’m sorry we disturbed you,” Dumbledore apologized, “but perhaps it is best that you are awake for the moment. It seems that we will have to begin plans sooner rather than later. Molly can I count on you and Arthur?”
Theo and Pansy filed out into the hallway, Draco slowly following. Just as they were about to enter the Common Room, Draco felt what was unmistakably a hand trail across his shoulders and down one arm before disappearing. He glanced around and saw nothing, but his body sung with the feeling only one person would leave.
Draco felt the magic flow over him, like being doused in water. The magic was everywhere, seeping into his mind and soul. He felt warmth like when Harry touched his Mark. He figured the Malfoy artefact must be reaching out to check on Harry’s magic. Draco had no qualms that Harry was powerful and pure enough to pass its test.
Harry tried to relax as much as he could; there was no use worrying over it. He wouldn’t see Malfoy again until September 1st. He might as well enjoy the last few days of summer hols. He just wished he could talk this out with Ron and Hermione, but there was absolutely no way he could do that before figuring out where he stood with Malfoy.
Draco hurried the opposite way, bolting up a back staircase that took him up a couple floors without him having to go near the Great Hall. He finally made it the classroom and was gratified to see that Harry was already there.
“Dray, can you switch with me, there’s a draft in this seat,” Pansy needled and Draco squinted at her but agreed. As he settled into his new seat he instantly realized why. He had a direct eye-line to the Champion’s table, and more specifically, Harry. Draco decided for this he could forgive that Merlin-forsaken nickname.
Harry broke eye contact, removing his hand from Draco’s chest for the first time, crossing his arms. Draco hissed at the loss of contact and Harry uncrossed his arms and pressed his clenched fist back onto Draco’s chest, still refusing to look at him.
Draco winced and smiled for real this time, “Apologies, I forget sometimes. I’m just so livid. Three of-age wizards attacking a 4th year, it’s preposterous. Absolute fucking cowards.”
Harry looked up; eyes sliding past Ron’s face to Malfoy’s, who was currently staring at Harry from across the Hall, eyes squinted in similar concern.
Draco couldn’t even be surprised that Harry would have the luck to get the worst and most vicious dragon of the bunch, because of course he would. Draco wasn’t sure how often he breathed throughout the entire time Harry faced the Horntail, and a sharp ache was centred behind each of his temples from the stress of the day. Draco heard Harry bellow the Summoning Charm all the way from where he was in the stands, and then it was just a matter of Harry waiting to see if the spell worked.
“What is so urgent?” He asked his head whipping to each side to check if anyone had noticed them speaking in the shadows.
Please give me your thoughts on this final chapter, I will dearly miss you all and will be reading and rereading each and every comment you write. Seriously thank you for such an amazing ride. See you again soon.
“Sorry, I couldn’t let him keep talking shit,” Draco looked around at the stares he was catching from everyone in the room.
“If he is back, he is fine. You must stay here until we figure out who has been trying to harm him. He escaped, but you are vulnerable should anyone have caught on what you are to him. I will go, you will stay and I shall return to collect you.”
“Draco, Draco, can you hear me?” She asked, falling to her knees beside him. His grey eyes blearily looked up at her, his whole body was vibrating softly with shivers.
Harry was trying to puzzle out the feelings coming through the bond, but did his best to focus on what Hermione had said. “Er, I don’t remember a whole lot, I was kind of distracted. I kept worrying about getting back for my meeting with Sirius. There were four dragons, so one for each of us. They were massive.”
“Introducing Canary Creams by Weasley’ Wizard Wheezes! Available by order through us!” The Twins yelled, standing on top of the Gryffindor table.
“I only know them vaguely, but I think they were both hoping it would happen. It’s Imogen’s birthday today,” Ginny clarified.
“I don’t like when people try to heal me,” Harry shrugged. “Look is this how it’s going to be? You sneaking up on me in bathrooms? Worrying about me?”
“He did say something about going swimming, I said he was mental, but he said the cold doesn’t bother him.”
Malfoy inhaled quickly, his eyes falling shut. Harry immediately recoiled, brought out of his inane thoughts.
Draco did as he was told, carefully pulling the chair out so it didn’t screech across the ground. Draco could feel the anger swirling around his Father almost physically. Today was not going to go well.
Severus stared at him a beat, his eyes widening minutely at Draco's use of Harry's first name, before staring down in horror at his arm. His hand flying to where Draco knew his Dark Mark was.
There was barely anyone in the corridors with it being so early, which Draco was grateful for. He was not in the mood for people right now. Draco finally whispered the password to the stretch of wall that signified the entrance to the Common Room and stalked inside, making a beeline for the boys’ dormitories.
“Oh yeah,” Harry’s fingers went to his shirt and he quickly unbuttoned it so that the sun became visible.
Draco felt the other shoe drop, and panic filled his entire body. He was sure of two things, one Harry was incredibly hurt. He never went to the Hospital Wing unless forced to. Two, Theo one hundred percent knew about Draco and Harry’s bond. Draco forced himself to project calm, like he was attending dinner with his mother after an afternoon in Lucius’ study. Press the pain and anxiety down, and portray confidence. He could do this.
“I found him behind the Three Broomsticks. His face was bleeding, his father was not pleased with him and left him there. I thought it was just the cut on his cheek. He was out of it, but I thought it was just shock. I didn’t realize his father has cursed him too.”
In that moment Harry desperately wanted to come clean, but knew he wasn’t ready yet. Ron wasn’t ready yet.
“But what about the take on yourself not being able to be open with anyone? I wouldn’t have made it this far without being able to trust Ron and Hermione, and how can I do that without them knowing me at all?” Harry countered.
“Ah yes, well, in my defence he needed to add them and hadn’t yet. He was going to make your potion get messed up, I was simply trying to save your marks for the day. If a few brains happened to hit his face before making it into the potion, well I’m a seeker and not a chaser for a reason.”
“I wasn’t sure if you were expecting it to be more of a platonic bond,” Harry shrugged, eyes fixed to the floor.
“How would they even know about you, anyways,” Harry said, grasping his hand, having returned from his experiment with the window.
“You threw frog brains at him in Potions yesterday,” Harry informed him and Draco bit his lip to keep from smirking.
Malfoy stopped chewing on his lip, instead digging his hand slightly into his ribcage, wincing. Harry felt pain quickly shoot through his torso, and gasped, his hand flying to his side.
to keep our bond a secret. It’s just what had to be done. We’re going to get some backlash, obviously, but I… I almost lost you. I’m not wasting another moment pretending or hiding. I couldn’t stop thinking of all of the things we weren’t able to experience and I never want to think that way again.”
Fudge whipped around, eyes bulging as they landed on Draco. “Young Malfoy, what are you doing here? Surely you were not injured during tonight’s events?”
“Draco!” Harry yelled, falling to his knees next to the couch. Despite the fact that Hermione had seen the two of them together multiple times, it still struck her as odd to see the two of them interact further than insults and thrown curses.
Thank you for the astounding reaction last semester, your kind words made my week. Please let me know how I did here. I tried to do these boys justice.
Harry tried to scream, to make any noise at all but the silencing curse held firm. His only hope would be if the pain got so intense that Draco would feel it. He was sure Draco probably noticed the anxiety and fear coursing through his body now, but probably wrote it off as anxiety for the task coming up. The boys had already been kind enough to punch him a few times, but Draco probably wrote that off as hits during training.
“Oh yes, it’s quite nice to be able to get into the village. The Castle has been so stuffy,” Luna said, casting a glance at Ginny, a small, dreamy smile on her face. Hermione noticed it more often than not on Luna’s face.
“So Draco, any plans for your birthday? It’s coming up,” Pansy asked, and Draco was thankful for the change of subject.
“Is he all right? What happened to him?” Draco heard Harry ask, his voice urgent. Why was he asking about him?
"Pretend hiding this is as important as hiding the whereabouts of your godfather. You don’t understand the danger we’d both be in if my Father finds out." Malfoy said urgently, stepping closer and shaking Harry’s shoulder slightly.
“I do, but that’s hardly the point. We’re an absolute mess,” He sniffed, rooting around for his wand. He pointed it at himself mumbling a spell and suddenly all of the sand and other debris vanished from his body. Harry was still distracted by the way Malfoy’s hair fell around his face, no longer in its normal slicked back style. Malfoy pointed his wand up at his head, and Harry grabbed his arm.
they will treat Harry badly. As I am sure you have always been aware of. Let’s go Harry. We know all he cares about is making you worship this school as a reprieve from those awful people. It’s fine, I’ll slum it with the muggles awhile.”
“Thank you for defending me and telling me what’s been going on, Harry. I was starting to go a little crazy wondering what was going on with you. But we should get back and go down to breakfast. You need to be publically seen away from Malfoy. Don’t be afraid to argue with the Slytherins if we see any. We’ll take a walk down to Hogsmeade, and then maybe go to Hagrid’s. You can sneak back up to see Malfoy while I visit with Hagrid. Parkinson and Nott are bound to be suspicious; it definitely sounded like Malfoy tried to say your name before he passed out.”
Draco could feel Harry’s anxiety flare at the words. Draco couldn’t stop himself from rolling his eyes. They could not kidnap children; they’d been over this. He was still at a loss. Apparently, Ron and Hermione had been called to Dumbledore’s office last night. Draco had been thankful no one had even attempted to approach him, but both the egg’s clue and just now they had said just one person would be taken.
“Draco!” He yelled, falling to his knees next to the couch. Draco knew he should pull himself into a more dignified position, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He felt completely and utterly exhausted.
Draco bid Harry goodbye, wincing when he turned away from him. It was hard to look at Harry without being filled with rage. Most of the blood vessels in both of Harry’s eyes had burst, leaving the corneas almost completely red. Draco imagined that Harry’s captors must have silenced him and being unable to make any noise had forced the blood vessels to pop from the exertion. Draco remembered back to a time where he hadn’t been able to force down the screams and Lucius would silence him. Lucius had often had to heal his eyes as well. Couldn’t possibly allow Mother to know, after all.
“We won’t be bothered tonight,” Draco called, leaning back against the table, arms crossed against his chest.
“Happy Birthday, Draco!” He smiled and Draco felt the happiest he had in a while. Maybe everything would be okay. At the very least, Lucius no longer had control over him. He was finally free.
“Oh, er, thanks,” Harry said, and Draco detected a blush crossing his cheeks. “What was so urgent? Are you all right?”
“Fuck, Draco,” He gasped and Draco forced himself to pull away, a smirk on his face. Harry mirrored him, a pleased look on his face. “Why haven’t we done that before?”
Harry chuckled and shrugged, “Better safe than sorry.” He hopped up onto the table again, an infuriating smirk on his face.
“You know I’m always a sucker for some sweets,” Ginny grinned, adding some chocolate frogs to her basket. “Ron’s stash was empty last I checked.”
“They couldn’t force a 14 year old to enter a tournament reserved for adults, but here we fucking are,” Draco spit, anxiety gripping him. “Well, I’m not letting them take me, they can shove it.”
Things had not gotten better for Draco since Harry’s name had come out of the Goblet of Fire. His friends had not thoroughly bought the lie he told about sending a letter off to his father and then snooping around afterwards as his excuse to why he had taken so long to return to the Common Room. He had been roped in to making buttons for his entire house and then some, all making fun of Harry.
“If our siblings keep finding their soul-mates before us, I’m going to develop a complex,” Fred complained, looking at George.
Next chapter we see some major conversations, and a moment you have all been waiting for. The major Draco and Harry coming out. I hope I do it justice...
“Oi, Weasley, your father is in the paper again!” Blaise Zabini called from across the hallway. “Is that really where you live? I guess what they say about the paper is true, it really does add a stone or two.” He brandished the picture of Mrs. Weasley standing outside of the Burrow.
Harry suddenly understood why Draco had reacted the way he did. Harry couldn’t accurately describe what he was feeling, but knew he had never felt this good before in his life. Draco continued for a few more moments before letting up, Harry collapsed back against the ground, breathing heavily.
Harry grasped at his back, one hand coming up into his hair. “I’m sorry, I can’t imagine what that must have been like.”
“He will be fine; I have placed him into a Dreamless Sleep to allow his body and mind to recuperate with as little stress as possible.”
Draco forced himself to nod, distracting himself from what Harry was experiencing. He cast the spell and felt some slight relief as the air heated around them.
"We need to be careful; both of us need to tone it down. If we suddenly aren’t at each other’s throats, people are going to notice.”
“You do not cast spells at a man whose back is turned!” Moody growled, Harry noticed Zabini staring at the ferret with his mouth open.
“I’ll let you two have some alone time, I’ll go run interference with Ron. I’m glad you’re okay, Draco,” She said briefly touching his shoulder before quickly leaving the room. Draco was thankful that Hermione had more tact that most people.
“I’ll take the bloody potion if it makes you stop crying. I just don’t want to waste it. Seriously I am okay,” Draco groaned, pushing Harry off as he sat up. Hermione didn’t miss the way the colour fled from his face as he became vertical.  He looked down at Harry, brushing his thumb across Harry’s cheeks.
Blaise and Greg laughed, “Yeah, you know how he is.” Theo had a historic reputation for being hard to get out of bed.
“Hey,” Draco crossed the room, abandoning his potion, he lifted Harry’s chin with a finger. “You don’t ever need to worry that I’m upset with you for being remarkable. You should be proud.”
I'm excited to hear everyone's thoughts! See you again in a couple days (I will most likely be keeping to this Thursday/Monday update schedule, but that could possibly change based on life).
“Yes, my soul-mate, Harry Potter. I heard you saying things that I believe my barrister would definitely consider as defamation of character. I must have misheard though; an upstanding wizard such as yourself would never stoop so low.”
Draco ducked his head, he had completely forgotten about the cuts, they were so small, and they were so close to healing he hadn’t wanted to waste the potion to heal them. “I was slightly worried about you during the task.”
“It’s a muggle ice pack, it’s all I could think of,” Harry apologized, carefully settling it against Draco’s face.
“No obviously they could be together! I mean I live with Dean and Seamus, I just honestly didn’t realize. Look at Mum and Dad’s marks!”
“I don’t understand why they can’t just summon our stuff for us; it would take so much less time.” Ron complained, flat on his stomach, trying to tug a shirt out from under his bed.
Harry closed his book at the sight of Draco’s tiny heart figure. Harry quickly got dressed before making his way to the Common Room.
“And Wormtail,” Harry spit, before shaking his head and smiling at Draco. “Regardless, they created it. I have no idea how, Lupin said it took every one of their skills and aptitudes to get it right and they barely finished it by the time they graduated.”
Harry sighed, “I feel awful, I’ve been such a shit friend to Ron. It’s just really nice getting to spend time with you. It makes me forget about all of the bad stuff happening out there.” He gestured vaguely towards the rest of the castle.
Harry’s voice was harder than she’d ever heard it, “I’ll fucking kill him,” he vowed. Hermione couldn’t help but agree.
“I know you must be exhausted, let’s just get you cleaned up, and then you can sleep, okay? Let’s get this kit off.”
“You’re absolutely freezing,” Hermione said her voice climbing several octaves. She began melting the snow around them, drying Draco’s clothes, and setting a Warming Charm. Draco’s eyesight was beginning to focus as he watched Hermione unwind the scarf she had been wearing and scoop snow into it from a few feet away before pressing it to his face.
"I just don’t think Malfoy would have cursed us, Zabini was the one yelling at Ron. I don’t know why Moody said he did."
“What did he do to you? I’m sorry I didn’t find you sooner. It took me a while to get back to the village,” Harry gasped, one of his hands coming up towards Draco’s face. Faster than Hermione expected, Draco caught Harry’s hand, and pushed it away.
Everything had led up to now, Draco nervously pacing in the spare classroom near Gryffindor, utterly beside himself. Harry was mad at him, and he had every right to be. Although mad was sort of an understatement, Harry was absolutely furious with him.
“Thank you, so fucking much,” Draco’s voice was muffled by Theo’s shoulder. He felt Theo’s arms come up around him and squeeze him back briefly.
“Harry, I’ve known I was gay since I was, like, 9 or 10. Why do you think I was so adamant my Father not know you were my soul-mate?”
“We could just be the three best mates that ever could be,” She said finally, sarcasm dripping from every word.
Draco fixed him with a look, “Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t matter. I’ve made my decisions now I have to deal with the consequences.”
“Come on,” He said, ducking into the nearest unlocked room, keeping a sharp eye out for anyone else.
“Fine,” Draco allowed and watched as she ran back down the alley. Draco sighed and let the tears he had been stifling, loose.
“Not at all, why are you dressed like you were outside?” Harry asked, noticing that even Draco’s hair was slightly wet. He assumed from the icy rain coming down outside the window.
“You can call me a Mudblood today if you need to. I don’t care. Whatever you need to do to keep your father from catching on or doing something.”
“I’m not up to his standards, so he reminded me of my place. Nothing I’m not used to. It’s fine. You absolutely need to go. I’m well enough to get back to the Castle. Go find Harry. I’ll go to the classroom. Please,” Draco begged. He wanted to be alone. Hermione had seen and done enough.
Realization dawned on the two of their faces and they covered their mouths with their hands to quiet their laughter.
I know everyone seems to be taking Draco and Harry's bond pretty easily right now, but there isn't really another alternative. They barely know what to do with Harry let alone Draco, also Hermione's approval is another massive part of things. We will see more aftermath of that the following chapter.
"Well, er, Mr. Malfoy, it's obvious you care deeply for Harry and Merlin knows he deserves to have someone in his corner in these uncertain times," Mrs. Weasley trailed off looking out of her depth.
Draco also had to respond to the letters from his parents. He hadn’t even opened them yet, and had made Hercules stay in the Owlery instead of returning to the Manor as he often did when Draco did not write back right away. Draco sure had a lot of things to figure out in a short amount of time.
“Listen. To. Me.” Severus commanded, his voice offering no argument. “Yes, it seems the Dark Lord has arisen. We will do everything we can to get Potter back. I am not your enemy –”
Draco was putting on quite the show of pretending he wasn’t absolutely filled with rage, but Harry smirked at him. “You do know I can feel what you’re feeling, yeah?”
“Shh, it’s me. I’m sorry, but I just needed to tell you something before you went down,” Hermione hastened to get out.
“Then it suddenly stopped,” Harry looked around quickly and realized they were surrounded by a curtain.
He scrambled towards where he knew the Gryffindor Common Room was. He knew he couldn’t get in or wait for Harry there, but he could be close. Draco went to an empty classroom, shut the door, and promptly let himself have a tiny breakdown. Draco was almost overwhelmed by Harry’s emotions, loud and clear despite the distance between them. Draco knew without a shadow of a doubt that Harry had not done this to himself.
Draco looked back to Harry, cracking his neck and fingers of his left hand as he did. Harry was staring up at the ceiling through his glasses, his emotions contemplative.
Draco laughed again, “Merpeople? Honestly, I’m going to start making you read. You know absolutely nothing about the Wizarding World.”
“Yes, quite disheartening indeed. I feel the best solution to this conundrum would be removing the Dementors from Azkaban, as a first step,” Dumbledore interjected.
Suddenly it was like Draco’s forehead was splitting in two. Draco clutched at his head, biting down hard on his lip to keep from screaming or vomiting from the pain. As suddenly as the pain started it stopped, there was a moment of relief before overwhelming disbelief and despair shot through and Draco forced himself to his feet.
I was made aware by a reader that I use the phrase 'you guys' in my thank yous and that is gender specific. I wanted to apologize and say that I definitely was not trying to insinuate that only guys read my story and I am only thankful to them. I am thankful of every person who reads my story (and also maybe that dog on TikTok who uses buttons to speak and could probably read this for all we know) and will endeavor not to use gender specific language in notes going forward. So thank you times a infinity times infinity to everyone who has taken the time to read, comment, kudos, bookmark or subscribe here. I again am struck dumb by the wonderful reaction yall have given me. Love you tons!
“Deadly serious. He performed a very Dark ritual tonight, injuring Harry in the process and was brought back to his full body. It is a ritual my father had been worried might be used to bring him back.  I could have sworn he was going to bring it to your attention, quite odd he didn’t. It’s a disgusting process, at any rate, but when has Voldemort ever shied away from the lowest of the low when trying to achieve his goals?”
“Fucking Longbottom of all people had the book I needed,” Draco groaned and looked back towards Pansy. She had kicked back in the chair she had transfigured and was smiling at the two of them.
“Harry, I don’t curse Muggleborns anymore, okay? I don’t call them names I’m supposed to. I don’t make Greg and Vince beat the shit out of them. I don’t run the Slytherin Common Room like I’m supposed to. I spend barely any time with my House. I let a girl who I am not betrothed to or bonded to cover me in love bites, and I don’t heal them. I’m supposed to have more decorum than this. I’m supposed to be the perfect Pureblood gentleman. I am breaking almost every one of my father’s expectations.”
“Draco, I-” Draco cut him off as he wrapped his arms around Theo and pulled him into a suffocating embrace.
“Too bad, I have,” Draco spit, tugging Harry with him. They made it down the spiral staircase where the Weasleys and Hermione were waiting.
“I know, I know,” Harry waved him off. He understood the logic, but he still wished he was learning something more exciting than ‘run away’.
“Perhaps you could give it to his parent’s?” Draco said at a lack of anything else to say. How did one comfort their partner when they literally watched a teenager get murdered less than 24 hours ago?
Staying at Hogwarts for the holidays was a first for Draco, but he was very glad he had an excuse to do it. He knew that Harry always stayed for the holidays and Draco couldn’t imagine going the whole holiday break without being able to see or talk to Harry. He actually wasn’t sure what would even happen to their bond if they attempted it. Which made his Christmas present to Harry even more apt. Draco had paid extra to ensure the purchase could not be tracked back to him, but Harry’s gift would be delivered.
Shortly after getting comfortable, Dean, Seamus, and Neville entered the compartment, gushing about the Cup.
Harry excitedly made his way down the tunnel to the Shrieking Shack. Regardless of the fact that he’d been training for almost a month, he still got excited and filled with adrenaline each time he tread the path to the dilapidated house.
Shout out to sp-ac-ep-re-si-de-nt (TheQueenOfStars)  and crispy_croissant for their correct guesses that Harry stole Draco's tie! I hope you all enjoyed the Yule Ball. We're starting to see some divergence from the canon. This is from both the changes in Harry from his relationship with Draco as well as changes due to this soul-mate world. I absolutely love the idea of Parvati and Harry getting to share their culture a little bit. We also get a little tiny bit of smut at the end there.
“Interesting,” Pansy mused as Draco chugged the Pepper-Up. Almost instantly he felt better. He rubbed at his Mark idly, hoping to send some comfort Harry’s way.
"Thank you," Harry forced a smile and Draco kissed his forehead again. Most of the blood had washed away from his scar, but Draco veered slightly to the right to avoid getting blood on his lips.
Harry was beginning to feel less groggy, but it felt so nice feeling Draco play with his hair and talk aimlessly to him.
“Moody, check the maze,” He commanded and Moody thudded away. Dumbledore crossed the space and was muttering things to the other professors. The minute stretched by and Draco grew agitated.
“Shut it, Potter, it’s me!” Harry stopped struggling and realized Malfoy was the one holding him behind the tree, his pale hair glinting in the moonlight. “You need to go, get the fuck out of here.”
“Pans, we both knew that was never going to happen,” Draco sighed. “And I am with him. I know, he knows, that’s all that matters.”
“You’re annoying! You lose your mind if I so much as stub my toe! I can’t be a little upset when you were beaten and tortured this afternoon? Seems slightly hypocritical,” Harry complained, wiping his face with his arm, still kneeling next to the couch.
Draco laughed, “I will make sure to tell her your critiques. I have to agree though. My cheeks have not been pinched even once.”
Draco was musing over the possibility when suddenly a beam of yellow light flashed across the grounds. Part of Draco realized who it was aimed at a moment before it made contact with Harry. Draco yelled out but not before he felt like he had been punched as Harry flew through up into the air. Hermione whipped around and shouted something that Draco belatedly realized was a Cushioning Charm as Harry fell back down to the ground about 25 ft away.
“Are you going to tell me where you were or should I continue to feign ignorance about the fact that you’re sneaking around the castle constantly?” She asked as soon as Harry made his way into the room.
Draco entered the room he had called home the past four years and saw Theo pulling on trainers at the foot of his four poster. He stood up as Draco entered the room.
Harry’s silver stag leapt from his wand and trotted into the clearing before Harry let it dissipate. Malfoy stared at it for a few moments before shaking his head, and pacing a few steps.
“Come on, Draco, we’re meant to go inside.” Pansy pointed out and he let her steer him through the doors. They followed directions to make their way to a seat until the Champions would be introduced.
As always thank you for the fantastic-amazing response! This started as a simple drabble in my head after reading a different soulmate Drarry AU and transformed into what you are all reading now. I've never really shared my writing too much and you all are so incredibly encouraging. So thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
“How is Mother?” Draco asked as their drinks were set down in front of them. His Father had ordered a dark whiskey for himself and a Butterbeer for Draco.
“Let’s think about this logically though, say it is a person, which we don’t know for sure. What would be gained by Dumbledore outing the two of you? No, he knows keeping your relationship secret is important. I doubt your father would be okay with you being stuck at the bottom of the lake against your will regardless of what that meant in conjunction to your relationship with Harry. Dumbledore isn’t trying to get sacked. No, if it is a person they’d choose someone whose family wouldn’t raise a fuss.”
“Can I help you?” Draco asked, raising his brow, he fought off a wince from the ache that ran through his face at the movement.
"Oh, okay," Harry looked back down at Malfoy’s chest and noticed the dark shadows further down on his torso. "You did break a rib, goddammit Malfoy!" He cried, instantly enraged.
“You’re annoying,” Harry whinged, “You lose your mind if I so much as stub my toe. I can’t be a little upset when you were beaten and tortured this afternoon? Seems slightly hypocritical.”
“You will not sully the Malfoy name,” Father snapped. “Things are changing and we will be among those honoured for our loyalty. You will ensure our legacy continues.”
“Welcome to the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament! Last night someone near and dear to the Champions was taken. They will have one hour to retrieve them from the Black Lake, or it will be gone forever!”
“Ugh! That’s the worst, what was he prattling on about? Some terrible creature or one of his favourite Gryffindors?”
Draco finally slowed to a walk as he made it to the hallway that the Hospital Wing was attached to, twirling his wand viciously. How was he going to get in there? He was sure if the amount of time had passed that Theo had heard it from Hagrid and made it back to the Common Room that it had been at least a fair bit of time. If he thought back to the pain he had felt earlier, then it was definitely enough time for Harry to have visitors. Hermione would obviously be fine with him, but he was sure Weasley would be there too. He had to think. He had to calm down for a minute and use his fucking brain.
Harry’s hands went immediately to grab Draco’s hips, not allowing him to go far, “Are you feeling this too?”
Draco was doing his damnedest to focus on what Pansy was saying but he couldn’t get his mind away from puzzling out the feelings Harry was sending. It had been the normal exhausted feeling Draco was used to when Harry was training, but the anxiety tinging the bond was odd. It was even more frustrating that he could barely sense him. Harry was just too far away. Suddenly, intense pain seared through the bond and Draco barely kept himself from grabbing at his chest. Draco hid his discomfort by burying his face into the space between Pansy’s shoulder blades, squeezing her against him in a weird pseudo-hug. The pain lasted not even a minute before it abated.
“This tournament has been awful,” He said instead. “Padfoot is convinced someone is after me. The shit at the Cup. Things are changing, you can feel it in the air.”
“He touched me, Draco, he can touch me. He took my blood,” Harry cried, massive sobs wracking his body.
“That prize seems worth it enough, and it’s all so exiting, we’ll get to meet the other two wizarding schools!” Ron gushed.
“Don’t fucking touch me, why are you still even here? Shouldn’t you be with your Master?” Draco spit, futilely trying to rip from Severus’ grasp. With everything going on he had forgotten that Severus was not his ally.
“They’re the three things needed to maintain fire,” He said as the thought suddenly occurred to him. “Heat, oxygen, and fuel. The fire will not last without all three. The universe is telling you that two of you would not work without the third. All three of you are essential. That’s why they didn’t bond without you.”
He cleansed the goblet and dagger of his blood and the hairs and stowed them in the bag he had brought with him. They were his now. Draco glanced around the study, but decided it was better if Lucius wasn’t aware of what had happened today. He quickly duplicated the artefacts and left the decoy where the original had once been. If Lucius thought to check he would instantly know it was a decoy, but Draco was confident. He wouldn’t think to check on the artefact, he barely paid attention to any of his Head of House duties. Once upon a time he may have felt the loss of status, but Lucius was not in tune with the lines at all. Draco threw the Cloak over himself and exited the study, reapplying the wards as he went. Next, he made his way to the dungeons. He had sworn to fix the balance and he intended to start at that moment. He continued down the flights of stairs and corridors until he got to the very base of the Manor. Draco reached out to the lines again and saw them rise up around him, bright as day. The lines all overlapped on the stone in front of him.
