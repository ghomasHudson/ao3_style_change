"Ron?"
"Was it because…" Harry said, faltering. He didn't want to be presumptuous, but he'd thought about it a bit, how Draco hadn't seemed entirely concerned by the purpose he invited him for. How he'd called him back, held his hand out for him, said,
Harry glanced around, wondering if maybe someone else would ask. No hands were raised yet, so Harry decided he might as well put his own up. Maria turned, keeping her face carefully calm, as she smiled.
“Er,” Ron said, reaching up to run a hand through his hair. “Actually, mate, I have… And it’s pretty bad.”
On his table was a copy of the book
The chances of us being attacked once out of this room are astronomical. Especially if the Ministry doesn’t do anything to fix their past mistakes.”
When they got to Quinn’s, they dropped off Milla and Hester’s trunks, before going to the fireplace. Quinn pulled out the small box of Floo powder, letting Harry go first.

“My son is going nowhere with one of your kind!” Vernon snarled. He was shaking now, and slapped a hand on the table. “I want you both out of my house, right this instant, or I swear, I’ll-!”
she wakes up…
Petunia Dursley pressed her lips into a tight line. Looking from Jonathan to Harry, then back again, she huffed. “If you’re here to come begging for a place to stay, you won’t find it here.”
He was vaguely aware of somewhere called the ‘Come-and-Go Room’, but hadn’t ever been there himself. Supposedly, it could become whatever the summoner needed, whether it was a place to relax or a library. It could likely turn into a room where they could practice, but he still didn’t know where it was, or how they’d get so many people in without being seen. There was always the Marauders Map, but it was still a risk. Someone would notice a large number of students disappearing from the same corridor at the same time.
And then it was November, an entire year since that day. Harry thought about it, often, almost obsessively. He tried to imagine living a life like this until he was forty, and felt his lungs seize at the thought.
Draco was cocking an eyebrow, meeting his gaze. He set his quill aside. He unknowingly had a blotch of ink on his jaw again, a small streak in his hair. Harry had just asked him what his patronus was.
"I didn't blame you for wanting to be free," Draco said. "Obviously you would. So did I, for that matter, which was why I agreed to the alteration myself. Even if it had saved my life, it was also greatly interfering in it."
He tried to get Draco to come with him once more by trying to take him away from a whole gathering of people with a, "excuse me, may I borrow him for a minute, please?" Once again when Draco was alone again, hands trembling around the food table. Once again, pulling him away for a dance to Draco's exasperation. He danced with Harry for all of five minutes before sliding away from him to see to every other matter. Harry tried to stay with him for the rest of it, putting a hand to his back, pulling him close by the waist, trying to get
Harry got out of bed, feet planting into the floor, and went over to him. The window was large enough for them to sit together on the sill, with some space between their feet.
That being said, while the barebones and certain details of the fic (and a LOT of the first half of this chapter, embarrassingly) are similar to GfD, it has come to take an entirely different path by chapter two!
"It makes sense. Neither of you are ever at the Great Hall," Hermione points out.
They never made it there because Draco had grown pale and shaky half-way through the walk to it. Harry took his elbow, his other shoulder, led him away from eyes and behind a tree in case they needed to Portkey back to their hotel.
Draco hums. He lightly tosses the one he's reading on top of the pile. "It just feels strange. Like they were written by somebody else. Not me."
"Mother…"
Harry, on the other hand, didn't sleep all through the night, holding Draco tightly as the thought about what had almost happened kept him awake. He would have chosen to walk away too soon, to return back to his Gryffindor dorms and sleep in contentment through the night, unaware and ignorant that that day and night was the last time he would have ever seen the boy that he had at some point fallen in love with already. He would have woken up the next day to learn that Draco—
Draco knew something had gone wrong with the alteration to be having this effect on him, though he didn't know how exactly - he knew this had happened because he was in love with Harry. He just didn't know that Harry knew the alteration had gone wrong - and Harry is afraid that Draco finding it out now would cause him to feel hurt and betrayed and doubtful of Harry's love in some way, and so it would make him sick again (because negative emotions between them affect Draco badly now)
"Will you tell me what's been on your mind?"
The scuffle stills. Without his wand, or essentially his magic, he feels more vulnerable.
doing here, boy?”
As he walked quickly, he caught sight of Draco, who was standing in the stairwell to the dungeons with Pansy. The two stopped as he approached, but Harry simply gave them a nod and walked past them. They didn’t say anything, just let him pass, and he reached the kitchens without fanfare.
Sorry for the delay. Been real slow going on OotP, and this took a lot longer to finish than I thought.
“The Wizengamot has also voted against investigating the Death Eaters that Harrison has named,” his father added. “For the last month, it has been debated. And, even with the fact that he couldn’t possibly have known about some of them, they believe that the endeavor would be a waste of time and resources. In act, it seems that they would rather put said resources into reassuring the public that He Who Must Not Be Named hasn’t returned.” Carefully, his eyes roamed the table, before landing on Harry. “How have the students reacted since the original article?”
He tried to focus, concentrate, as the Dementor came closer and closer. It’s gray and scabbed hands came up, reaching out towards them. The panic rose in his chest as a rushing noise slowly filled his ears. Harry tried to cast again, hoping his Patronus would work this time, but only another feeble wisp came out of the tip of his wand.
Before Harry could dart away, Draco had already stooped down to pick him up.
“What?” Harry asked, blinking for a second. “Oh, right… Well, sort of. My family calls me that, but most of friends still call me Harry.”
Pulling out his wand, Harry looked from one end of the alley to the other, wondering where the Dementor would come from. He listened, hoping to hear the rasping breathing before they could enter the alley. If he listened hard enough, focused, he could just barely hear…
Harry floundered, not sure what to say, and reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose in exasperation. “Greg, that doesn’t explain why you were sitting next to my bed. Staring at me. While I was
Swallowing the lump in his throat, Harry finally spoke up. “Is she going to be okay?”
“After what happened at the Ministry, and what you said about… About the dementors and Lily, I thought you could use something of hers. Or that she had made for you. I thought this would be best… After all, it’s been enchanted. Euphemia and Lily’s magics should be imbued in every strand they wove. Their love… It’s an old fashioned style of knit, long before even the times of the Hogwarts founders. That’s what gives it that warm feeling. It’s their magic and love reacting to you.”
Grabbing hold of Dudley’s sleeve, Harry yanked him towards the alley. They dashed inside, and Harry was ecstatic to find that it had an overhang as a makeshift roof. They wouldn’t be dive bombed and ambushed then.
As Derrick turned to the nurse to demand answers, Harry walked to his mothers side. Had she been left to suffer all night? While they had sat on their hands, wondering when she would return, had she fought for her life? If Harry had gone with her instead of to the Dursley’s, would she even have gotten hurt?
With a nod and a smile, she reached into her basket and began to unpack it. First was a small tarp, folded into a tight square, that was set aside. Next came a few small plant trimmers, as well packets of seeds and hand spades. These were put to the side with the tarp, as well as two sets of gloves. Then came the blanket.
of heels on wood flooring. The door opened, and a woman appeared, staring at Jonathan.
There was a soft chime from a cat clock on the wall, signalling the half hour mark. He looked up at it, beginning to wonder just where the time went. It was already six-thirty, and if he wanted to make it to dinner without being suspicious, he’d have to leave now.
As Harry was frozen in place, his father moved quickly forward, knuckles white from how tightly he was squeezing his cane.
XxXXxX
Harry stood in the back with Ron, watching as Freya spoke.
“Supposedly,” his mother said, “James Potter's mother, Euphemia, started this for you just before her passing, and your birth mother Lily finished it… It was found in the Potter’s house, and put with their things after the attack.” She let out a sigh, reaching out to fuss with the blanket, pulling it a bit tighter around him. “I know before, you said you didn’t need to know all about the Potter’s and their families… That the photo album was enough… But I think you could used this.”
“Oh,” Dudley said, almost soft. “That cop… He a relative then?”
It looked hand knitted, and rather worn, like it had been made many years ago. It was also small, like it was meant to be used as a small throw blanket, or just something to wrap around one's shoulders when getting out of bed late at night. His mother smiled at his confusion, and leaned forward to throw it around his shoulders, pulling it around him. It felt… warm, but in a familiar way. Like he’d been wrapped in it before.
"You don't know anything!" Scorpius exclaims, having made his way to Matthew now.
Harry shrugs, still smiling broadly. "Maybe. But I say you right deserved it."
On the wireless, somebody keeps on singing between their heads.
"No. Not… this was after," Draco says. He clears his throat. Potter has gone very quiet, eyes snapping up at him, his brows furrowed. "I don't know who it was. I was just… I was walking down Knockturn Alley. I didn't notice him coming. My mother had to… it's a big part of why she made me come back here."
"Draco… come on."
Harry moves closer, and Ginny doesn't move away this time. He kisses her cheek, drawing her close to his chest. They stay there for a long time.
There, he said nothing for a few seconds. Whatever he'd moved aside before, he seemed to be fiddling with it a bit.
Draco broke away with a gasp, pushing him back by the sides of his waist—Harry gripped his hands and kept them right there, overtaken by an overwhelming need for proximity and closeness. He stood up on his knees and threw his legs on either side of Draco's lap in a straddle, as if he could hold him right here and stop him from leaving, from leaving with a terrible finality that could never be reversed, from—
? That you make me want to be here in this godforsaken world where nothing ever feels right anymore?"
"Okay," Harry whispered.
A silence comes over them, then, and there he is again, at a loss for words. Not knowing the right ones.
Draco can't speak, can only stare at him. His brows scrunch together, his lips parted in uncertainty.
"Actually," he said. "I'll sit over there." He nodded at Harry's side of the chair, which he was just about to take out.
Well, he knew what to do, just to at least postpone the questions and the freak-out.
Draco meets his gaze, holding it for a moment. There's a twitch of something in his face and in his fingers, restless and agitated. "It's much too strange."
"Grey."
"Just sounded nice, I suppose. To my seven year old self," he said, finally. "The freedom of touring around the world in a camp bus, when I was so locked away all the time, making a living off of screaming bloody murder into a mic." He didn't entirely know what he was saying, just saying anything that came to mind. "I, um… I used to close myself in my room and just garble nothing into the back of a hairbrush, thinking I sounded brilliant. Only one of the neighbours ended up calling the muggle police, and… and I don't really know what they thought was happening but..."
"In a bit," she said, touching his shoulder and following him to the kitchen, where the pan was wafting up smoke on the stove, the smell of tomato and curry spices filling the air. "Is Malfoy here?"
But he does. He does tell him, even if he's concise and straightforward about it. He tells him about a picturesque life where nothing went wrong, where there was no Voldemort nor Death-Eaters. His mother, happy and untroubled, and his father a different man. Severus, not so different from who he was here, and him becoming a Potions Professor just as his godfather was.
, twisted and ugly.
he repeated in thought, looking at Draco quietly, watching him turn his head away, and Harry's gaze, falling to his mouth,
They've settled in an alcove somewhere on the third floor, which Draco had chosen by looking through the Marauder's Map. Harry had found himself oddly fixated by the fascination alighting his gaze as he followed the paths, Harry following him.
When he turned around, it was to Draco watching him from behind, brows knitted in puzzlement.
He halts his words there, like he meant to say it aloud and then lost his nerve at the last second. The lingering and heavy weight of it, the unsaid, the memory, weighs heavier between them in the silence that follows, draping over them suffocatingly with the tautness of its tension. There's a scuffle, Potter's head turning away, his body turning into the curtains in his peripheral, like he's about to walk out. Except he doesn't. Except he turns back around.
He fixed up the room when he steadied, and called Bill.
That's an idea that Harry can't even wrap his head around. "Wow. That's..." he says. His throat convulses around his lack of words. Everything he can think of saying sounds underwhelming, so he gives up trying. "What—what did you see there?"
October was when Harry crossed paths with his childhood again.
But then everything Draco still didn't know had cast a gloom over him, when Draco had taken his arm and wrapped it around himself as he shifted over onto his side and let Harry push his mouth into the nape of his neck, breathe him in, falling back asleep for another hour or two.
That time Malfoy, sitting behind him, had softly mumbled the answer to the question Harry was asked in Transfigurations, more to himself than to Harry, surely. Harry had felt slightly guilty for repeating it back to Professor McGonagall, when she'd nodded, sharp, and smiled at him in approval.
"I'm sure I can take him, really, Ron. You don't have to worry about that."
"Do you want me to come along?" Harry asked.
They're lying together, faces close on the pillow, blankets up to their underarms.
"No. I'm not." Potter says. He hesitates. "But I do worry about you."
"Fine. You're too much drama anyway," Draco mutters, distracted, breaking into a laugh when Harry shoves at his shoulder. He then holds one up to shake it at him, putting it back in the box as he's saying, "You've kept them all since the very
Harry didn't like the look of that mischievous smirk. He did
"So what is this?"
"What?"
Except Malfoy called for him with a quiet, "Potter." And something in his voice made Harry stop before he could move beyond a swift turn of his body, made him look back at Malfoy, who had just stepped up to him, one hand in the pocket of his pressed dark trousers.
Draco reaches out to touch her arm, tugging at her. Narcissa is beginning to fall apart once more, falling forward into his shoulder, clutching at him, and his heart twists at his thin and frail mother, at the frantic sounds of her weeping, the sounds of the grief she still carried around with her of the last year.
"No you won't," Draco grits out, and then tries to get up, pushing onto his hands and feet. For Merlin's sake, he can't stand a repeat of St. Mungos again, confined to bed for hours on end. "I'm not staying here for bloody
There's a memory, of him at seventeen and small in his father's arms, in his home, rasping,
Harry shrugged. He kicked off the ground, until he was high up in the air. He smirked, bouncing his eyebrows down at him.
Did he know it had something to do with the alteration that Harry forced him into?
Draco had kissed him in a life of such vividity his mind can hardly comprehend it anymore, and then here, once, in a hospital — short-lived, featherlight tentative. He knows this, in reality as well as dreams, but it's something else entirely to have Potter kissing back, wanting as well. To know, even if as a very disconnected fact, that this is real. This is nothing that he will have to wake up from.
"I can't
Harry stilled.
Potter's throat convulses, his eyes having gone hazy. It still haunts him, in some way, and that knowledge pulls taut in his chest, that he hasn't been safe, full of laughter and joy, all his life. That he was ever unloved and afraid and hurt, that he's eighteen and he had to save the world and lose too much as he did. That he
In the dark of a room full and suffocating with his own sorrow, Draco was tugging him up from his neck with a grip to the sides of his hair, hands coming onto his cheeks and maneuvering his forehead onto his own as he was saying, over and over,
"I wanted it. Now I don't," Malfoy said carelessly, simply. Fickle prat. "Anyway, you should put that on, hide that scar of yours lest your fan group recognize you and gather to you like ducklings to their mother."
Sweet little things he's never imagined Draco would ever want to do.
"He... he left," Neville says. He seems to be realising what's gone on, looking distressed about it. "I'm sorry, Harry. I thought he would have... he came in packing everything, not saying anything. I tried to ask him why...and I don't know, I guess he arranged for a train back to the King's Cross Station or something, which should be leaving around now..."
"From what?"
"You beat me to it," Ron said. He was getting up from his seat, hands held up to take her into his arms. "I had a whole bloody speech ready, 'Mione. Oh my bloody Hell—"
"So what are we doing today?"
Harry shrugged. "They just didn't want to." A memory came to mind, and he snorted. "I remember… when I was about...four, maybe five... my aunt would sit beside the tub and give me all these instructions on bathing myself, right? And every time she would have to correct me, she would — I'm not joking — she would touch me like this." He poked Draco's hand with the very tips of his fingers, and his breaths trembled on a laugh. But Draco wasn't laughing, and his hand had gone still in Harry's hair. "What?"
"I don't want to—"
Harry couldn't speak, his eyes following Draco when he walked past him. He watched him ignore him for a moment in favour of continuing his work, his back to him, and then Harry turned and headed for the door, leaving the room.
"Just go," Draco said, his voice thick and quivering, pointing a shaky arm out the door. He set his jaw. "Get out."
feel it." He paused, tapping his fingers. "Ideally, it should be… something steady and constant, you see. Something fulfilling.
"Ah, I see." Draco said, stepping back from her, gestured towards the kitchen. "Join us for breakfast then."
"Do you understand?" was what Healer Francine said at the end, sounded pointed as she did, like there was a private, hidden meaning under the surface that only she and Malfoy knew.
Harry fell asleep somewhere around five in the morning. By the time he woke up, it was nearly twelve.
The ending is definitely meant to say that Draco won't care, that he's fully certain of Harry's love for him and he has no doubts and it won't hurt him irrevocably the way Harry is so clearly afraid, because he has seen all the proof he needs for it (including the fact that Harry is even willing to switch places with Draco so that the curse is more redirected towards Harry instead, pretty much willing to put himself in the line of danger for him)
ended somewhere else entirely.
"And I'm very glad you're okay," Hermione continued.
"What happens to those who don't love and crave?"
They flooed out.
“Bring him over for Christmas,” Ron says, shifting his head around on Hermione's lap to meet Harry's eyes. “I bet mum would like to meet him.”
"I don't know. Even emotional bonds are an entire category all on its own, you know. Different types of it. Some even thrive on negative emotions, did you know?" She huffed, a mix of weirded and awed. "Okay. So maybe yours isn't affected by negative emotions, but then in that case, it would be on the basis of positive emotions, so it
"How would you?"
"Aunt Andromeda," Draco said. "Not that it's any of your business."
"Yeah," Dudley said, and smiled, tentatively, in a way that was hard to reconcile him with the boy that used to beat him into the sand of a park. "You too."
Harry grins at that, slow and small. "Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So… so come on with me." He jostles his hand out of his coat pocket, reaches down between them and takes a hold of Draco's wrist. Draco glances down at it, Harry's hand loosening, hesitating. "I—it's under a Fidelius charm. I'd have to—"
He and Malfoy were made to sign a contract at her office, sitting together in adjacent chairs. The contract had several stipulations, among them being that:
He goes quieter. His answers become shorter. His gaze becomes lower, the tremor of his hands repressed around the arms of the chair. She notices it all, and where it tangles together.
"Do we really need to be discussing this?" Draco asks, faintly disgusted at thoughts that he refuses to entertain.
He stirred to the sunlight in his face, his vision bright red behind his closed eyelids. He stretched out on the bed without opening his eyes, yawned cavernously, and realized only seconds later that his elbow didn't knock into any pillows.
"You don't remind me of them. I think you're better than where you came from." She smiles, then, and looks at him, reaching for his hand. "And I'm very glad you're here, Draco."
Draco walks some distance away, holding the Galleon to his ear. "Can you hear me?"
Harry swallowed around his heart, beating fast and wild in his throat. "And what does that mean for him?" he asked. His mind was racing, full of puzzling gaps, full of questions. He felt nauseated, and he wasn't entirely sure if it was just the bond, the effort of trying to stay upright through his illness. "Why isn't he here with us? Why isn't he hearing all this
They lapse into silence then, as Harry's mind whirls on the words, all the little hope he derived from the letter before now in ruins at his feet. It's like being left behind, being the only one that didn't move on. It's like watching a train take the boy he loves away, all over again.
"Whatever, Potter," Draco interrupts. Harry looks up at him, and finds a conflicted expression, as if he's warring with himself over something. "I want to see the map."
"Would you like to tell me what's on your mind?" Luna asks.
"Tell you a secret?" Harry said.
The process of Mind-Healing won't be a focus in the story. I wanted to use it as a method for glimpsing into the way Draco feels after waking up.
"No," he finally said, cocking his head thoughtfully. Then, to Harry's surprise, he huffed, a small upturn at one corner of his lips. A near-genuine smile.
Harry's movements hitch, falter. He finally moves, putting a pawn one step forward. "Oh. What'd she say?"
close."
—beyond
Harry doesn't realise how obvious he is about watching Draco pass him by in corridors, meeting his eyes with a quick smirk, until he turns away and finds Ron staring at him.
“Alright,” Maria said, stepping forward. She looked almost resigned. “Alright, all of you. It’s time to settle down.” She turned to Umbridge. “Madame, I believe that you have disrupted my class long enough. Perhaps you should be out of the room while I teach.”
Harry turned to find the redhead seated at the little table in the kitchens, a plate of pastries in front of him and crumbs stuck to his stuffed cheeks. He couldn’t help but sigh, and moved to sit across from him.
“The only marks I care about right now are the scores on these students OWL’s,” she hissed. “As is
to be wrong. Because, surely, they couldn’t be
Pressing on the blanket, she smoothed it down on his shoulder and smiled. “It’s okay to grieve for them, Harry. It’s okay to take the time you need to come to terms with everything you’ve been through. And, if you want or need it, we can ask Skyla to find someone trustworthy for you to talk to about the things you’ve seen. But today, we’ll take a break. Take a step back from everything, and just do something for you, alright?”
The others were quick to follow Harry through. First Sirius, then Marrissa, Milla, Hester, and Quinn. Together, they made their way into the dining room. Much to Harry’s surprise, Quinn had been right. Everyone had come. His siblings, their children and spouses. Everyone sat at the enlarged table, having tea and cookies like nothing was out of place.
“Mr. Zabini,” she said, laughing a bit. “Why on earth would you need to know how to
The words were not meant to be callous, but that’s how they came across. They were a cold chill that washed over Harry’s entire being. His father… didn’t want him here. He wanted Harry to go home. To leave his mother here, and wait for someone to tell him she was okay.
“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” she said with far too much pleasure. “I trust you received my note about the time and date of your inspection?”
Getting up from where he had been sitting next to Harry’s bed, Greg came around to help Harry up. Or rather, he grabbed Harry from behind, under his arms, and bodily lifted him to his feet. He dusted off Harry’s shoulders, looking rather pleased with himself.
“Expecting?” his mother said. Her eyes widened, and the air grew heavy at the normally wonderful knews. “Russell… Surely you don’t mean…”
As the day turned to evening, and evening into night, Harry started to get worried. His mother still hadn’t returned. When it got to around their usual supper time, Harry went down to check if maybe she had come back, and Harry just hadn’t been informed. He found his father standing in the entrance hall, scowling as he watched the door.
With a shrug, Harry glanced at the clock, finding that it was already time for class to start. Harry downed the rest of his tea, moving towards the door. Freya wasn’t too far behind him.
When they reached Hogsmeade, Quinn was there, waiting to greet them. He kept a smile on, though as they grew closer, Harry noticed how strained it looked, his brothers eyes darting back and forth. When they reached him, Quinn gave his two children a tight hug.
Thankfully, no one was there when he arrived, and he was able to set his bag on his bed before transforming. The problem came when he tried to slip out the door to sneak into one of many cat passageways that Crookshanks had taught him to find. It was less of a problem, and more of a surprise.
The sound of Lily Potter’s death slowly filled his ears, growing louder and louder. Voldemort’s laughter soon followed, filling his ears and crushing his soul with darkness. As the stomach churning smell of Dementor’s breath began to fill his lungs, he heard the thump of a body falling to the ground.
He knew that there was no way to shake Greg once he had his marching orders. The large boy was loyal to Draco, and thus to Harry, and if Draco said that Harry needed watching, then Greg wasn’t going anywhere. As annoying as it was, Harry would have to deal with it. After all the time he’d spent with Draco in the last years, he often forgot that Greg and Vince were right behind them, so he supposed he would soon forget about his new shadow.
Almost instantly, Harry could hear the quick
There were no rolls of parchment on her desk, so Harry had to work carefully to open one of the drawers. It took a while, but he didn’t want to risk changing back. While the woman was a slimy pink toad, she wasn’t exactly stupid. Harry wouldn’t put it past her to have some sort of alarm in her office if anything other than a cat entered.
Harry cringed. The Slytherins, while not outright saying they didn’t believe him, also weren’t speaking to him unless they had to. He understood that they were all in dangerous positions, but he missed his friends. And he needed the allies. As many as he could get. There was a war coming, after all.
“It took a bit longer than I thought,” Maria sighed, glancing at the clock. “And I don’t think we have enough time for the quiz. Now, I’ve been offering this to all of my classes, but if you’re worried about not passing a quiz, I’ll be putting up a schedule for my office hours by Friday. On weekends, I’ll be holding tutoring sessions based on what will be coming in the next week. Even if you think you might be the only one to come, please ask for help if you think you need it. If it means your class gets to move on sooner, then it’s worth it.”
Instantly, Harry froze. He turned, watching Vernon and Dudley Dursley walk in. His aunt stood quickly, eyes darting back and forth between Harry and her husband, clearly worried. She wasn't the only one though.
As she left, Harry shared a look with Ron. They both knew she likely wouldn’t let the topic drop. It was only a matter of time before she perfected the idea and they had to hear it all over again.
XxXXxX
It really didn’t make Harry feel any better. The idea of spending more time with his best friend was… appealing, he didn’t like the idea of anyone following him around all the time. He
Blaise only groaned as they reached their common room. “Everyone’s kissing the Ministry’s ass, because Fudge has them convinced we’ll all die if the Dark Lord is back. I don’t see why he couldn’t, at least, investigate just to be sure. Rather than simply saying it can’t be true. Does the man not have a brain?”
Harry did his best to remain calm. He didn’t snap or roll his eyes. Taking his usually calming breath, he pulled his wand from his pocket, and placed it on the table. Petunia jumped at the sound it made.
Slowly, Dudley gave a bit of a nod. He shot Harry a look before heading towards the door. Harry, not wanting to run to catch up with him, gave the adults a quick nod before following after him.
She went on to explain several facts about Hungarian Horntails, as well as dragons in general. The class, for the most part, ended up being a lecture. Most didn’t want to get too close to the dragon, and the most student interaction was boiled down to answering questions based on uses of different parts of dragons, like their blood, dung, and hide.
Harry frowned, not sure what his friend was talking about, much less why he would say it in the hallway where anyone could hear. If Umbridge was trying to pin something on him, the last thing he needed was a joke about having an army. The Ministry was on pins and needles, trying to find anything to discredit him, and they wouldn’t hesitate to take his family down with him. They wouldn’t care if his father was on the Wizengamot, if his sister was probably the only witch capable of diffusing tensions with centaurs, or if Emit and Neva had enough of a reputation of years of honest journalism to tear the Ministry a new one from a different publisher. In fact, the Ministry likely saw that as all the more reason to break them down.
“But Umbridge is already gonna be gunning for him!”
After his talk with his mother, almost a week ago, he had started again on his training with Sirius. They were working on spells that his godfather had thought of as particularly helpful in a duel, though once Harry got back they would move on to the Animagius ritual. They had decided that being an unregistered Animagius had more pros than cons, now that Voldemort was back for sure.
Harry tried to not think about it, even when his father told him to go home.
to leave?” Umbridge hissed, standing straighter and seeming to make herself look as imposing as possible. “I am the Inquisitor! You can not make me leave a classroom in the middle of an inspection. This will result in poor marks on-”
Pressing her lips into a tight line once more, Petunia turned back into the house. While she didn’t exactly invite them in, she did leave the door open, so Harry led the way inside.
“Wow,” Blaise laughed after dinner, as they walked down the hall, the gaggle of first years a bit behind them. “It’s only the first day of classes, and you already have an army. Well, your family is practically one already, so I guess this is more like a second troop.”
“Vernon, sit down. This is more important.” She shot Harry a look, before turning to her son. “Dudder’s… I want you to go for a walk with… with Harrison. He’s… going to tell you something that you might not believe, but it’s true. It’s all true. Alright, Popkin?”
“Brother, actually,” Harry corrected, smiling lightly as he sipped his tea. “He’s very dedicated to his work, so it’s best not to bother him at the moment.”
?” She stopped taking a deep breath. “No, no. I am… I am calm… You are fine. And today is… your break day. We’ll… We’ll talk about this later.”
She turned, as if to go back to her desk, only to realize Umbridge was there. Instead, she veered off to the left, toward Patil and Brown. Meanwhile, Umbridge watched on, like a viper waiting for the right moment to strike.
So Harry simply sighed, spending a portion of the next week preparing. Though, he had to agree that it was important that he know what he was doing ahead of time. There was an incantation he needed to memorize and repeat at dawn and dusk, a potion he would need to brew, and he’d have to be mentally prepared for the change his body would endure. Not only that, but he found that it was deceptively hard to keep something on the roof of his mouth without accidentally swallowing it.
The silvery wisps of vapor shot out from the tip of his wand. The Dementor paused, but only for a second. It continued forward, and Harry saw Dudley give a heavy shudder, wrapping his arms around himself. Harry swallowed, feeling helpless as he used one arm to carefully push Dudley back, the other keeping his wand up.
Shoving him, Harry turned and started to run. He wasn’t sure where they were, had lost track of the house in their walk, but up ahead, he could see a small alley. If he could get to it, maybe he could hunker down, defend Dudley until Jonathan could come find them. He’d have to try using his patronus, even if he would likely get a strike for it, since his parents weren’t around to dampen the trace. But there wasn’t anything else Harry could do.
His vipers were happy to have their home change, if it was only a bit. Even Gift, as grumpy as he was, gave a soft pleased hiss when Harry told them what he was doing. It had been a long time since Harry had the time to add to the garden, or even spend time with the snakes. He’d been so busy last summer, training, that he hadn’t gotten the chance. But he supposed it would be fun to continue this throughout the summer. He could expand his bedroom garden…
“But if we were to be attacked-” Blaised tried, brow furrowed, only to be cut off by Umbridge’s laugh.
Shaking his head, Harry did his best to focus. “Anyway, the reason I came back to talk to Aunt Petunia. See, there’s this… Well, there might be a war coming. And you and your parents could get caught up in it.”
Stil, his cousin seemed happy, even if his aunt seemed warry. He was sure that Vernon would have a few choice words. Or… a lot of words. But he didn’t give a damn about what he thought, so why worry?
(See the end of the chapter for
over the weekend. Now we find out that he brought a cat to school?”
Ron hummed, taking a large bite. “Then wha’ do you need ‘er for?”
“It’s just until Umbridge is gone. Just deal with two weeks of review and then we can go back to actually learning defensive spells. Just keep your head down and don’t let the toad goad you into doing something stupid, alright?”
There was a long pause, in which Harry awkwardly tapped his fingers on the table, and then concluded that this must be the end of their half-coherent conversation. He was about to pick up his spoon, set beside his plate. Draco's notes were stacked together, away near the edge, the table clean.
," Ron said, sitting back, putting his hands up with a laugh. "We heard you the first hundred times. We know."
Paris was a place Draco had gone often as a child. They booked a room in the wizarding district
"I know," Harry says. He can't look up from the table. He swallows. "I'm so sorry."
"And I'm not going to keel over right when you look away from me. I'm really feeling alright."
* * *
Draco led him over to the couch, sat him down there before he left and came back with a glass of water, kneeling down at Harry's feet as he handed it to him.
Draco narrows his eyes, feigning bemusement behind a repressed smirk. "You just did."
"Of course," Harry said, softly, like a promise.
almost imperceptible over the loose curling of the backs of his fingers, the tuck of a touch into the haven of his half-folded palm, fading away as the dream fell into another dream, full of incoherent, distorted images that made no sense to him when he awoke.
He wonders if she knows. If Potter's told her anything. It's a sickening thought.
Draco stared at him, a twitch of something between his brows. He leaned closer, quietly, "Is it the—"
Malfoy's face was very still. He turned his head away, made a sort of apathetic noise. He leaned forward, reaching for the bottle on the table. There was a pause, one that felt longer than it was. He poured himself another finger, not looking at him, and then said, "No, Potter. Frankly, I don't give much of a damn about anything when it comes to you."
, and he always has plans. They meet at Quidditch practice, mostly, and sometimes at night, but then they're both so knackered that they don't really do more than kiss.
In these letters, Draco is somebody painfully tender and sweet, and Harry has known him, in the way he looked at him, and bought him sweets, left him notes. In the way he took care of him in little ways. The way he held him close and kissed him so gently.
Malfoy hummed, glancing away. He made a small, close-mouthed scoff in his chest, and then looked back at him again, grey eyes almost icy in its colour. "My, my, Potter." A corner of his mouth curled, something of a hollow smile, an almost-sneer. "To be a married man and to engage in such
"I'm not agreeing just yet," Malfoy said. "I need time to think."
Not studying, Harry supposes in secret when he is there, because he's too distracted by Draco's mere presence beside him, engrossed into his own book, or by the smell of his hair when he's leaning against Harry's shoulder, explaining something to him. He's busy trying to listen, to not think about kissing him instead, because Draco is always annoyed about it after they get carried away. Harry must look absolutely stupid and dopey, smiling at him, because sometimes Draco just breaks off with a huff and a dart of a glance away, and just settles back against his shoulder again.
, was the desperate whisper of a thought that came to him, only he didn't know who or what it was addressed to.
One after another after another, Harry was driven down to his back as Draco lowered himself over him, a slow kiss-by-kiss that pushed him further towards the bed. Draco's hands, at his neck, his jaw, through his hair, the two of them losing themselves in each other.
Weekends are always spent at a pub with Ron and Hermione, but there are times they are joined by Draco, Luna and Neville as well if they ever end up there at the same time, and Harry likes those sort of weekends. Draco usually watches their interactions from a small distance, commenting or adding a quip every now and then to something being said, fiddled slightly with his drink and smirked at Harry's jokes. He doesn't talk a lot with Harry while everybody's around, doesn't talk a lot in general among others.
"Sorry," Draco whispered, brushing his fingers over the bridge of his nose. He was frowning, perhaps with remorse, his face softened and worn as that of one on the verge of slumber.  "Sorry for everything I... sorry."
Every night, he ends up here, sitting stone-still on the foot of his bed, his gaze losing focus on the wood line patterns of the floortiles. His mind is becoming hazy again, full of fragmented memories and dreams of a boy and a man in another faux life that was more real than anything here.
But some days, when Draco is with him, he almost feels at home, almost feels real again, the way he did in his dreams.
Draco looks a bit at a loss. "Well, no. I'm very careful with everything I do. Perhaps small explosions, only, but nothing like what you've described..."
But there was something Draco was searching for, within that question.
It's a mundane moment, like any other, when he tells him that. The only difference is that they're walking down the High Street, having come out of Honeydukes with too many bags of sweets again, and when they come upon a space between two buildings, Harry pulls him into it by the wrist and up against the facade, just because he felt like kissing him again. He's not a romantic, and he knows that, but it's very easy to brush a kiss against his mouth in that moment, whisper into it, "I'm so in love with you."
"We are in no need of stooping to such self-abasing schemes, Arthur," Narcissa responded, coldly.
* * *
Still, there had been few moments that they mildly interacted, wordless and uneasy, such as that time Malfoy had picked up his shrivel figs for him —  having rolled over to a black oxford after they'd slipped from Harry's hands. Malfoy had been seated in the adjacent row right beside him, handed them to him without looking at him.
Harry barely managed to pull himself out of a self beat-up session to make his way up to Umbridge’s office before dinner. He slipped in, alongside another cat, that eyed him with an air of cautious curiosity. Still, the cat was more than happy to let Harry wander around the office once he knew Harry wasn’t after the bowl of milk in the corner.
“Wizards use weird names…”
His mother was silent for a moment, frowning slightly. “Ron and Hermione?” she eventually asked. “Or… the others as well?”
“Alright,” Dudley said. “You’re… a wizard.”
“Wherever he is,” he whispered, “I hope you’re making him feel better.”
Before Maria could speak, Umbridge stood.
“He was called into a meeting with the headmaster last minute,” Marrissa supplied for Harry. “We didn’t really get a chance to hear what it was about.”
Another note was scratched into the clipboard, but Umbridge was already asking the next question. “You’re the great-great-granddaughter of the renowned Seer, Cassandra Trelawney, correct?”
Almost immediately, Draco stopped. He slowly lifted his foot, took a step back, and stared down at Harry. Grey eyes peered down at him, as Harry mentally kicked himself. He wasn’t supposed to let his friends and classmates see his Animagus form. If they managed to connect the white marking above his left eye to his scar, the entire point of being an unregistered Animagus would be moot.
Harry couldn’t help it. He smiled. “Yeah… Ron and Hermione have been helping me map out the tunnels, and decorate the main Chamber. Hagrid even built a bench that’s down there.”
Harry frowned at that, wondering what the toad would want with that information. Surely how long McGonagall had been a professor was irrelevant. Right?...
(See the end of the chapter for
“So far you have had four separate teachers,” Maria continued, adding a note of each teacher to their corresponding year. “Which has led to a bit of a disconnected learning environment. So, to start off, we’ll be running review lessons on each major subject until you have it all perfected. As they say, better to have one sharp sword than a hundred dull ones, yes? Now, before I begin our first review lesson of your Year One course work, are there any questions?”
Hermione swallowed. "Well. He's… um. He's the primary source. Do you remember that? So… so if…"
"Fix it.
Her eyes are distant, and it's a long time when they fill again with herself. When she manages to compose herself, pull her hand away. She closes her eyes, her chest heaving, as if to put away the last of what she felt. She does not leave, even when she seems like she could use some air away from a room suffocated by the weight of what he's told her.
They had drinks together, leaning sideways on the couch, arms sprawled across the back of it. Elias' temple was supported on the curl of his fingers, and their legs touched as they talked in front of the burning fireplace, chasing away the January cold, talking about a lot of things. Elias pointed out the ring on his middle finger, asking, "what's it for?"
"As do I."
"So…" Harry started, when he was done with waiting for Malfoy to speak up, because he certainly didn't look like he was going to any time soon. "What are we doing here, really, Malfoy?"
Draco's insides go cold.
"Yeah," Harry says. "We... we did talk about it."
Luna was giving him further lessons on how to substitute wand movements with hand movements, but when Draco began to grow frustrated, she'd stopped him, made him sit down with her on the grassy embankment and take a break.
Song for this chapter: This Is Me Trying by Taylor Swift
How terrifyingly strange, to be so aware of his own being and breathing and beating heart, still beating even after everything, even after having died once already. How terrifyingly strange, to not only be so aware of himself, but of somebody else's own being and breathing and beating heart, the breakable fragility of Draco's body pressed against his own side. How terrifyingly strange to be so in love with another person, to have all these overwhelming feelings and realisations in the ache of his own bones and stomach and heart, and to still be so held back by the force of his inhibition, because in that moment all he wanted was to turn his head and kiss Draco Malfoy, and even now — even now, he did not, paralysed by fear and doubt, by all the reasons he could not, by the way things often never were as one wanted them to be.
Draco couldn't bring himself to go through with it, in the end. Not even in his hopelessness. Not even in that overwhelming, exhausting love and grief that he had felt then. At the core of himself, it wasn't this, him, that he wanted to forget. It was how it hurt the way it did to remember him, and everything else that came with him. It was his dreams, and the way they made everything in his life lose colour in comparison, made Draco need him sickeningly. But that was not the fault of what they were born from in the first place.
Draco put something down on the table, deliberately calm, turning to him. "What will you be doing exactly, Potter? Cuddling me back to health? Or perhaps we just fuck through all hours of the day?" He stared at Harry, unwavering, for a long moment. In a lower voice, "How long? We still have nearly two decades ahead of us, do we not. So how long?"
"I want to say everything. Only that would be a lot of things, and I suppose that would be somewhat underwhelming, wouldn't it be? To…" He didn't finish what he was saying. His jaw worked, teeth clicking. "So I'll say it for that, right now. For cornering you in the Room of Hidden Things, making it harder to end it all."
"Well then. Did you work them out?" he asks, a hint of something thin and wry quirking up at his lips, though not quite a smile. He looks up at Harry, looks a little like he's faintly bored of this conversation, but Harry knows by now that usually it means he's trying not to show something underneath the surface. "Or perhaps you need another two weeks of ignoring me to work them out some more?"
"Draco."
dot on the Marauder's Map. He lifted his head to look at his best friends, Ron and Hermione, snuggling with each other across from him. "He didn't show up for any of his classes since two weeks before Christmas holidays." Harry had spent those holidays with the Weasleys, Hermione, Andromeda and Teddy at the Burrow. He knew Malfoy went back to the Manor to spend them with his mother. "He just sits cooped up in his room all day long now. He doesn't even come to the Great Hall to
"Come on." Malfoy nodded his head, and then walked towards the door.
Draco. He's coming home, back to Wiltshire, tomorrow. He's coming to stay here with his mother through the winter holidays.
"I know." Harry dipped his head, so that his forehead was against Draco's. He tugged at the button on his collar idly, one arm around his back. "I know. I'm the one that's scared."
Draco eyed him.  "The curse could act up any minute for us."
a desperate sort of fear. He breathed, tried to calm down, lowered his voice, "And can we please stop acting like I was the only one that didn't want this damned
"I'm sorry," Harry said. "You didn't really deserve that. And it's just… I just wish they would leave the war behind already."
Then he heard it, a moment later, and his heart seized up and skittered in his chest towards a speeding race. He straightened, slightly, one sock still half-way off.
Draco turns to look at him against the tremendous resistance of his own body.
Some of the tension, that's been following Harry all through the day, drains from his body. Still, his heart feels tight in his chest, his head aching as if it's split in two directions.
"I'm afraid not," the solicitor said to that, and went on to explain how it would be a symbol for the formation of the marital bond, the channel between their magical cores that allowed the circulation of the curse's magic, that it signified an agreement to join them together.
"He's gone," Harry says, his voice thick. "He... he just
"Hm." Harry's lips quirk into a small smile, and he leans in slightly. "That's only for friends, Malfoy."
"Why do you need to know that?"
Potter leaves a moment after, when he is ignored. Draco pushes himself up into a sitting position, back against the pillows, his spine aching and his back muscles throbbing with the echoes of a broken body, fatigue laying thick over his bones. It feels a little less like being trapped inside of himself, sitting up like this. He reaches for the notes, reading through them, trying to, but his foggy and drowsy brain isn't cooperating much.
you think I like this very much myself? Living with you here in this house?" Malfoy leaned forward, slowly, mouth curling around the edge of a sneer. "
"I wouldn't have expected it either, two years ago."
"What's this, Potter?" Draco said, with the jump of a brow. He had a hand under his jaw, looking up at Harry from the tilt of his head into it. "Are you recording me?"
"I like that," Draco whispered, a breath coming down from bliss. "The way you say my name."
"I only just got here myself, Potter," Malfoy brushed off, waving a hand dismissively. Harry felt a strange sort of twist in his chest at the blatant lie, and the possible idea behind why Malfoy lied. Harry shook his head.
Draco took over all the further conversations to Harry's relief. He was asking all the questions for Naborowski, letting him speak about himself, adding a bit of general points here and there or personal opinions about the topic at hand.
Teddy pointed at his ears.
* * *
There is a way that he's looking back at Draco now, fixated and soft, held there the way they were in firelight. His eyes, brilliant and evergreen, and in them the thinnest sheen of the tears that had once saved his life.
His steps faltered when he saw him, always the first thing he looked for these days.
The train whistles, beginning to roll forward. It is a silent ride, for the most part, save for Lovegood and Longbottom's murmurs of conversation every now and then.
But something always held him back.
When they broke away, ending on a soft peck, Harry dropped down beside him, slid his arms under the covers and wrapped them around Draco's slim waist, scooting closer to push their foreheads together.
She only smiles at him, a little rueful.  Then she goes back to brushing her fingers through grass, as if grounding herself to it, letting it be quiet for a while.
exactly?"
"Why?" Malfoy was whispering, close to his ear, teeth a slight scrape against it. There was still that smirk on his maddening mouth. "It's not like we'll have anybody else, Potter. Not for a long time."
Another memory treads through his mind, one clarity amidst foggy faces and the white walls of a hospital, faded. Everything that happened around the memories he's had cut out of his mind—they've all gone faded.
“I was thinking,” he started, going slow. “We need to make sure everyone who could be a target knows what’s going on, right?”
It was then that it hit Harry. Somewhere that fit nearly every criteria. It was secluded, with many entry points, and enough space for everyone. The only real problem would be the locked entrances. Harry was the only one who could open them, and he couldn’t exactly open them all at once. But, if they staggered arrival times, and started with the youngest groups first… He wouldn’t even have to lead groups in once he’d opened the door, thanks to the work he’d done the last two years.
“She’s not really a monster… Actually, she’s really nice.”
! I knew you were one of them! One of those freaks, just like the boy!”
A glance showed Trelawney scowling, but hunched into herself, as if trying to retreat and protect herself from the toad like woman. She looked almost offended, though a pause caused her to loosen, just a bit, as if realising the question wasn’t as rude as it had seemed. “Almost Sixteen years…”
“Is this about why you left?”
“Sirius wasn’t the Secret Keeper for the Potters,” he started with. “Remember last year, when I mentioned Peter Pettigrew? Well, he was. See, James, Sirius, and Pettigrew were all unregistered Animagi, and Pettigrew escaped Sirius by turning into a rat. That rat was then found by the Weasley’s who named him Scabbers. When Ron was in the paper that summer, with Scabbers on his shoulder, Sirius broke out of Azkaban to kill him before he could betray me or my family again.”
"I'm sorry."
Draco raised his brows, unconcerned and cool. "For the record, I
A while after, Harry checked the time. It was almost eight. They'd been in bed together for about an hour.
"Yes," Harry reassured with a derisive snort. "Go on before he bursts a nerve."
Draco pushed off the doorframe then, made his way over. "Actually, I'd like to try, with Teddy."
"For one: Headmistress McGonagall won't stand for it, and you know everybody's scared of her wrath. And two…" Harry pauses, licks his dry lips. He glances down at his fingers, idly rubbing sheets between them. He shrugs. "Well. They all know, don't they? That they can't do anything to you? Not unless they want me on their arse for it."
"Any more concerts you want to use my name to get into without paying, or can I go now?"
"I did," Harry said, softly.
"He's not worth that."
"Are you coming or not?"
Draco hesitates, and it's clear. He wants to say,
"He's revealing all your weird habits to us, Harry!" Ginny shouted over the music at him.
His chest hurts, looking at her, feeling the shame curl around his heart. He's known she's grieving, known she isn't talking about things, knew she didn't like to, but Harry never pushed. In part, it was because he understood the frustration of being pushed into talking about things before one was ready to, but mostly, he thinks he might have just let it pass because he didn't know what to do about it, how to help. How to say all the right words and be there. He still doesn't know how to feel anything of his own most of the time, only ever talked about things to a boy in a hospital bed that he'd thought wouldn't be listening.
"Right. Well," Harry said, looking down at the bag in his hand. He just wanted to go home, see Draco again, have dinner with him and kiss him before bed. "I suppose I should—"
" Harry cut in, defensively over him.
Malfoy blinked. His jaw muscle locked, for a split second. "Potter, this isn't the place for a damned quarrel
he is reminded. Potter, who is calm and comfort and still the only thing that makes even a bit of sense in a world that's grown a stranger to him, but who now also means to him everything that he will never have, who means to him all his love turned to grief, and the impossibility of a dream that hurts worse when he's already seen all that it could be.
Malfoy was saying that as if he expected Harry to know exactly what he was talking about, as if Harry was feeling the unease of it all the time. Xavier had explained that the faster flow of the magic between them had very similar sensations to an increased amount of magic, which was why it wasn't all too different for Harry than before. He just felt it a lot less than Malfoy did.
Dudley nodded. That was all he did. He just looked uncomfortable. "Yeah. Okay."
"Don't you sound sure of yourself?" Harry can imagine the cock of his eyebrow to go with those words, and he presses a hushed smile into the finger against his cheek, gripping the coin tighter.
"Well, of course. Being with you is always a special occasion, darling." Malfoy's voice was falsely sincere and soft, but very clearly carrying over to many of the other inhabitants. "And I hope to make it so that it can be forever."
"Alright?" Harry asked, and was very conscious of what was on his canvas—the incomplete half-way profile of a face, turned just so over a shoulder, and the strokes of burgundy at the very bottom of the canvas. There was the outline of hair still uncoloured, swept up into a half-up, the half down loose over the nape of a neck, tucked over an ear but for a swirling tendril. A moment in motion stilled into a painting.
"I wasn't a very good person."
There was the rough sound of Ron awkwardly clearing his throat.
"When did you and your wife get married? How did you two meet?" Dudley asked, always two questions at once. Harry didn't correct his assumption. He didn't think he could really be bothered to deal with whatever can of worms that would open.
"You've been driving me insane," Draco whispers, fingers touching the tie bundling Harry's hair up at the back of his head. He opens the tie one-handed, until Harry's hair is free. Harry smiles, laughs a little into his mouth as Draco pushes a hand into the back of his curls, pulls him close by the nape of his neck, and finally kisses him.
Malfoy did not seem as famished as he had claimed to be. He was eating far too slowly for that to be true, every now and then forgetting that he was supposed to be putting a spoonful of his soup to his mouth as he got lost in thought. They sat in complete silence as they ate, while Harry waited for Malfoy to start with whatever he wanted to converse about.
His mouth pressed tight together. "I know what you're thinking," Harry said, not looking at him. "And it's wrong. He was framed."
Malfoy shook his head, coughed a bit to clear his voice, and then inhaled and exhaled, trying to regain his breaths back.
He was leaning his forehead against the dried canvas. He opened his eyes and saw the face in front of him clearly. For the first time, he saw not his eyes, or his hair, or his cheeks, or his hands, but wholly the person in front of him. All of him.
"Draco," Harry said, quietly. His throat felt strange, a little dry. His temples still throbbed from the alcohol in his system.
The next chapter begins with Draco awakened by Harry's tears, unbeknownst to Harry, and is calmed only by the sight of him. Harry later tells him of his father and godfather's death, and his mother being on House Arrest. He decides to stay with Draco at St. Mungos after witnessing his grief from outside the door. Having lived a bright and beautiful life that is completely opposite to his reality, one where Harry could never feel what he'd felt for him there, Draco tries to push him away by pulling all of his old antics to save himself any more grief. Harry eventually explodes out of anger and leaves, and then on calming, decides that it is best for him to not stay if Draco doesn't want him there.
, he thinks to him inside his head,
Harry was caught in the question of what had him so suddenly withdrawn, if it was discomfort, but then he'd caught Draco smirking slightly at something he said, and for a reason Harry couldn't entirely fathom, it lingered in the back of his mind all throughout dinner. Harry looked over at him more often after this, after everything he said, even catching sight of a slight smile.
Malfoy took his trembling hand in his own gently, cold palm wrapped around the back of his, and slipped the silver ring onto his second finger. He knelt upright on both his knees, hands on Harry's thighs, and kissed him hard on the cheek, nearly making him fall off his chair with the force of it.
Harry didn't say anything when he did come in, pretending he heard nothing.
If Luna does, Draco doesn't know. She acts just fine around him, besides her usual eccentricity. His throat convulses. "Why are you telling me all of this?"
Harry's eyebrow arched. "You don't want to… you don't want to hear about what I have to say about this?"
"So delightfully boring," Draco sighed, clapping lightly.
"No I haven't!" Ginny says, with a bubble of laughter in her voice. "Don't tell me you've lost him again now, Harry!"
"You think you're funny, do you, Potter?" Draco said, grey eyes narrowing.
* * *
"Yeah, okay. Uh, Ron?" Hermione was gripping him by the biceps and trying to drag him away, but Ron was still stuck to his spot, struggling to process what was happening as he stared at Harry, a wrinkle in his forehead.
"Harry, um," Harry said. "You can...just call me by my name, really." They haven't talked much throughout the last two years, ever since the curse had happened, but Harry did find it rather strange for her to be addressing him so formally even now.
Malfoy had shared much of himself tonight, without sharing any vulnerability or emotion in any true way. He somehow had a way with that, with talking about dark things like he was just telling Harry about the upcoming weather, things about Voldemort living in his home and the constant threat of death looming over him and his family and being tortured by his aunt and Death-Eaters that treated the Malfoys like scum in his own home and Dumbledore and his father dying in Azkaban without them ever resolving their issues, without Malfoy getting to say goodbye.
Neville's expression clears, and then it just becomes bemused.
"Just talk."
hurt and
He was older. Of course he was, nearly six years later. He had a trimmed beard, and a round belly, and a healthy flush in his cheeks. There was a little girl in his arms. She looked just like him.
"The floor. The counter. The bloody stove, Potter! I don't give a damn!"
and something about
Malfoy shrugged. "I haven't really worked that out yet."
" Harry faltered, swallowed hard. "And we're stuck together for twenty years after all."
And then there are the days when Luna is joined by Ginevra Weasley, due to which Draco is forced to make up one excuse or the other. Usually he doesn't bother beyond a half-hearted,
"May I have your hand, please?" Luna asks, is scooting close to see him, and Draco doesn't know what she understands, how much she does. He doesn't know how to feel about it, only that he wants to cry, but he can't and he doesn't. "I won't touch you."
. Scorpius beams at his father from the back.
"I'm not looking at him all the time."
" Harry said. He swallowed again, untangling himself to shift onto his back and face the ceiling, scrubbing a hand through his hair. "God. I've been so stupid."
Draco's hands moves down to his cheeks, his jaw, smirking down at him. "You caught your foot in somebody's dress and fell on your face is what happened."
"Ever since you came back from the Malfoys', right?" Ron asked, in a low voice. He was flushed up to his ears, his jaw clenched. "There's no way he didn't have something to do with this! You go on ahead. I'll be there in a bit."
strangely anxious he had been about it until he saw the familiar, snow-blonde hair and silver eyes again.
In return, Harry told him that he loved science-fiction books. He liked digestives. He'd been interested in art since he was a child, and used to collect a lot of art supplies. He used to watch a lot of television, in particular game shows and talent competitions, which he had to explain to Draco what it was
"I…" Neville's mouth opens. "He didn't tell you?"
Malfoy's eyes had opened again, heavy-lidded and so very grey. They lowered, in a slow flick, at their hands.
Malfoy looked away, clearing his throat uncomfortably. His lips were pursed. He was watching the other patrons.
"I'm sure," Draco said. "Most of them hid it well. But not Pansy. She made it very clear she hated everything I made, and flat out refused to 'undergo such torture'."
Harry could feel his body, the muscles of his abdomen stilled and taut against his hand.
And maybe now Harry wonders if he only loved those dreams of him, but...
Luna leans a little close. "I think he found your wandless magic very impressive," she says, in that conspiratorial way she did at times, like there's a cryptic meaning hidden under the surface. She retreats back again, smiling at him wider.
"Don't make this difficult for me," Draco begged, breathless and shaky and crumbling, sounding like he was about to lose all control and composure and break down completely any second. "Please don't make this difficult."
Draco's steps falter, but he resumes then without much of a hitch, and he's pink in the cheeks, huffing as he comes over in front of him. He's wrapping the scarf around Harry's neck, swatting Harry's hands away and buttoning up the rest of his coat, quick and precise and done within seconds. "Yes, yes. Merlin forbid the Saviour of the Wizarding World ever lift a finger to help himself."
, because wasn't it him that ruined it all?
grateful for the intervention.
Draco takes a spoonful. He tastes nothing. But somehow, having Potter in front of him makes it easier to let it settle, the sight of him that makes the unreachable and intangible malaise in him settle down into a calm and ease and

On Saturday, Hermione had come by before breakfast to check on him. She was sitting with a chair pulled up to the counter, reading the papers as she listened to Harry telling her about Elias whilst bustling about the kitchen. She looked up when he got to the way the curse had reacted at the end of the story, frowning.
"I'm rather tired of people getting overly involved in my life," Draco said, whirling abruptly to face him at the foot of the stairs, forcing Harry to stumble to a stop. His gaze was flat on his own. "You have no right to say anything."
Harry quickly scrambled up, Malfoy off of him, leaning on his palms and feet. Malfoy seemed just as confused and wild-eyed about it all, his chest still heaving like Harry's, blinking hard up at the ceiling.
Potter quiets upon seeing that, swallowing again. His fingers curl around his waist, thumb tracing over a marred, smooth line. He still hasn't seen them, what they all look like. Draco's body. He's only touched them during a heated kiss, a hand slipping under his shirt, laying warm over a meld of skin and too smooth tissue.
Draco's jaw shifted, close-mouthed, and took another swallow of his drink. He didn't say anything, and it wasn't clear whether it was out of grief or anger or hurt or nothing at all, or perhaps all of it.
He'd spat the word out, hardened in satire around the edges. "in case you've
Harry tries to repress a small, amused snort.
Then it's another silence, and just when Harry opens his mouth to break it, to take his request back—
Draco only then becomes aware of the tug at his own cheek, there of its own accord, unbeknownst to himself.
For a moment, there was nothing, but for a tilt of his head. He seemed very lost in his own thoughts.
Draco clenches his jaw. It quivers around his mouth anyway. "Fuck you."
"Oh." There is a long silence. A long, long silence. He thinks this is where he really hurt her. He doesn't look behind him. He doesn't know how she feels about the fact that it had been another boy and not another girl. He doesn't know if it matters to her. His heart is racing, thick in his throat, and the silence goes on so long he thinks she's gone, until she says, "Were… were you together?"
Is he alone and afraid? Is he safe and alright?
Harry's mind snags onto the last part of that. It skips over him with no meaning. "A good part of their lives…?"
wants anything like that."
Draco told him. Then, the Roman Forum, all the ancient, architectural fragments of stone, leaving behind history. In the evening was a visit to the Colosseum, an oval-shaped amphitheatre lit up gold when the sky darkened.
New Year comes and goes, and then they're standing at the train station, Draco leaving for Cardiff.
On Wednesdays, Hagrid invites Harry, Ron and Hermione into the hut for tea. Then it's off to Quidditch practice for him and Ron, during which Harry gets to see Ginny as well. Then, around evening, after a shower and a change of clothes, they all go out to The Three Broomsticks.
Narcissa continues the motion of her fingers, running through his hair.
, because letting go must mean he can imagine throwing them all away, but he can't. Not yet. Maybe one day, but the day is never today.
Thinking of the only family he's ever had.
He was standing there by the door, all velvet robes and wavy hair twisted up into a low plaited bun at the back of his neck, white-blond swirls falling over his temples. Two lines of braids crowned his head, the cross of each one dotted with a miniscule, beaded glow, like fairy lights all throughout. He was smiling as he was conversing with somebody, all crescent-moons in his cheeks, a crinkle in his eyes.
, Harry thought to him, and smiled, when Draco's attention broke away from Arthur's story and he looked at him.
He was rather hoping he'd get to share with Ron, who has been paired with Dean. Maybe they could discuss switching roommates, which surely the other two parties would agree to.
before I let this door slam right into your face and break it."
He shrugged again. Harry wanted to break something. "Only to make sure there were no ill-intentions involved, of course."
But Harry took too long to respond, because he couldn't tell if he was joking or not.
"Right. Well." There was a pause, still in that toneless, cautious way. "I suppose you'd know more about it."
It was weeks after reaching the end of their travelling journey that Draco began to wither drastically. He got out of bed late most days, a blatant contrast to his habit of waking early. His magic grew more erratic — he would try to cast a small spell, and it would either fizz out, or something in the room would explode, and he always looked visibly uncomfortable whenever he did try.
It occurs to him that Draco might just be embarrassed, and angry for it. In that case, Harry doesn't know what to do. He remembered wishing he'd come back after he'd left, the way the want tugged in his gut, but it hardly feels like Draco has at all when he won't even look at him unless Harry's imposing his presence on him.
But all he wants right now is to be close to Draco, to hold him, and to sleep right here. Just sleep right here, next to him.
Fuck. How did they even get in?
"I'm saying that because you love Harry," Hermione interrupted. "And Harry loves you. I mean, he
Ginny sighs. "I'm not good with this, you know. Dealing." She gives a mirthless half-laugh. "I remember after Second Year, everybody would just be looking at me all the time, trying to get me to talk. They'd be so worried. Everyone except — " She pauses, her eyes clouding slightly. She's looking away, her throat convulsing, and when she speaks, her voice breaks on his name, "
He lifts his hand again, tries to focus on bringing his magic back to the forefront and into his fingers. It takes too long for the little glowing lines to form, but eventually they come, swirling around his hands. He draws them into a constellation, a dragon's head, a secret all for himself. Luna smiles and draws a half-crescent moon among them, white among gold.
Draco's chin quivered, lips pressing tight, firm. He blinked, rapidly, trying to look away. "I'm tired."
The words filter in through his thoughts, the shadow of a presence coming to loom above him. Draco lifts his head, blinking, his gaze flitting upward.
"Hi," Harry said, swallowed, and it was awful, the way his voice came out.

Draco shifts his head closer to him on the pillow. Harry smiles, murmurs,
When Harry knocks at the door of Draco's dorm one morning, it's Neville who answers. "Harry," he says, seeming a little surprised by him here. He knows who Harry usually knocks on these doors for. "Hello."
