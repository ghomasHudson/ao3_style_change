“She was asleep when we left,” Narcissa assured him as he went, once again, into his husband’s comforting arms. “An elf will inform her of our whereabouts when she wakes. Maryellen says she’ll come by the town house tomorrow to finish taking your measurements, Harry.”
A blissful but still hard Harry said nothing as he summoned the tube of lubricant from a nearby drawer and opened it to squeeze some onto his fingers as Draco spread his legs. He used one hand to shift Draco’s balls so he could see the other man’s entrance
“Hey! I was polyjuiced! She kissed me when she thought I was him! Not like I seduced her or anything!” Ron said defensively as he picked up Cattermole’s wand. “Look, come with my brother and me. I’ll explain things on the way.”
"One problem at a time, Draco.” Draco murmured to himself as he entered his bedroom. “First thing to tackle is helping Harry. How do I help Harry?" He sat at his desk and pulled two sheets of parchment from the drawer. Then he wrote a title at the top of each one and began to think.
“You have there, a list of the wizengamut members and the order in which I’d like to speak with them.” Harry explained, taking it back. “I’d better add Amelia Bones to the list, as well as the queen’s representative who witnessed my title acceptance.”
“Yeah...” Harry sighed and went quiet as if thinking what to say. “I’ve been thinking about that day and...”
“Maybe that’s why you don’t appreciate the true value of them, Draco.” Harry smirked. “You know, I almost forgot the need for your punishment.”
As Harry strolled the halls of Potter Grove, he made a decision. He would write to Olgok for advice on his health but, in the meantime, Harry would remake himself. Dumbledore had tried to mold him a certain way but he didn't fit that mold so he'd have to break it and make a new one.
“You act normal, silly.” She told him. “You’ve informed him of the name change and he welcomed you to the family. Just relax and let him be. He’ll come to you if he needs more information. That’s the way Slytherins do things, Harry.”
"It does." Draco confided. "I'm also happy to report that he seems to be quite serious about us being more than mere flirtation."
"No. It's too dangerous, Dud. I can't let you do this. You're safer in the muggle world." Harry said, holding up a hand as if to immobilize him.
Harry looked down into Draco’s piercing grey eyes and found them hypnotizing. He lowered his head and softly captured Draco’s pale pink lips.
Harry smirked in mild amusement. "Yeah, Dud. We've a Ministry and a Minister of magic. We have a lot of things muggles do. It's just that ours are magic. Have I blown your mind yet?"
The display touched Harry in a way that very few things ever had. “Thank you very much, Dooley. I’ll do my best to remember that.”
"You can probably guess what must be necessary to rip the soul, Harry, but I shall tell you." The old man whispered. "Murder."
Stepping out of the fireplace, Harry's eye was drawn to the simple lettering on the window of the door to his left.
“I felt the presence of the dragon egg in first year, Harry.” Draco confessed. “Well I felt a presence but I didn’t know what it was until I saw you, Weasley and Granger in the gamekeeper’s hut with the hatchling.”
“I’ve finally achieved it! I’m normal in something.” Harry started to laugh. “We have a normally abnormal family, Draco. They’re all nosy and want to help when we want nothing more than to run our own lives. I’ll be writing owls all afternoon telling them that we’re together so nobody will try to do this kind of thing for our own good again.”
Lucius chose that moment to return, but he was in a foul mood. “My father’s portrait was inside the spells you put up, Harry. He has demanded that I apologize to both you and my son. I’m very sorry to have misjudged the importance of the items you requested in the letter, Harry. My only excuse is that it’s been over seventeen years since I’ve dealt with a pregnant person’s cravings. Draco, I’m very sorry I didn’t think of your feelings in this. Can we eat yet?”
“Draco, it’s so good to see you.” Adrian smiled warmly. “But as I was just saying to Harry, we need to be going. Daphne’s parents have the kids and we promised them we’d be back as soon as we could.”
By the time the pair made it to the garden, Lyra was awakening also and Lucius left the boys with Harry while he went to see about his granddaughter.
“My parents have the kids until we get back home.” Draco told his friend. “I was hoping to check on Pansy.”
Harry grabbed hold of Cedric and caught the cup as it fell, once again tugging them through time and space only to fall into the staging area of the last tournament task. The fanfare was deafening until people began to notice that Cedric wasn't moving. Then the screams began.
“I can’t believe we’re all free on Wednesday afternoons. We’ll have to talk to Marcus about letting us watch him at our place on that day,” Pansy smiled at her friends.
Draco sighed as he led Harry to the love seat. “Theo should be in touch soon. It wasn’t long after I got here that he fire-called about Lav.”
“As for the ‘letting you’ comment… Draco – look at me,” Harry asked. When the blond looked up at him, he said softly; “Draco, I’m not ‘letting you’ do this; I’m helping you do it. Spouses in love should support and help their partners realize their dreams. It’s your dream to be a Potions Master; isn’t it?”
"He's just a kid, Uncle Severus." Draco protested. "Nothing his father or any other family member did should affect how you treat an innocent child who wasn't even born when the offense occurred!"
"I was fifteen months old." Harry reminded the group. "Albus Dumbledore is a powerful wizard who had access to both me and a Master of potions who has reason to dislike me - and my father before me - after he removed me from my rightful guardian's custody to place me in a home with people who hated me."
Where was the blond’s sense of self preservation? Harry sighed. “Then wave your wand over the thing and just
He lost himself in the telling of his story. He told them all about Sirius and Remus and how they’d been close friends of his parents throughout school. He told them about James, Sirius and Peter becoming animagi to help Remus with his furry little problem.
On the morning of the twentieth day of July, Draco called Harry’s name in a very panicky tone. He was in pain. He’d spent half the night tossing and turning in bed while trying to find a comfortable position and yet not awaken Harry.
"Whether you're blood or not, Harry, you'll always have a place in this house and this family." Molly came over and hugged him. Then she turned to Draco. "And so will you, Draco…"
Draco smiled sadly at him and rolled over knowing that he couldn’t say what he was thinking at this moment because something deep within him was telling him these dreams weren’t his own.
Harry felt himself harden at his husband's words. He pushed his growing erection into the other man's hip and heard a whimper. "I love the way you let me take control of you...of your beautiful body..." He cast a spell and smiled as both he and Draco were rendered nude. Harry ran his hands over the lithe body that was already showing a slight swelling in the abdomen. "My love and our children...You have no idea how happy you've made me, Draco. I want you so badly, baby."
“Another point to make is that...” Draco glanced at his father. “This type of creature only manifests its powers in the presence of its mate.”
The floo activated again and his time Hermione walked into the kitchen moments later. “Hi, Harry! Good morning, Draco! Harry, I forgot that you’d raised the highest level of your wards and tried to send someone through.”
Harry pulled away from Dumbledore's grip and looked around but there was no trace of the blonde third year. He shook his head to clear it and started to follow the headmaster again but then Ron and Hermione were beside him wanting to know what was going on. He told the same story again only slower and with more confusion as to why Voldemort might've taken him from the tournament just to spar with him.
“That’s fine.” Draco nodded with a quick smile and hurried from the room to collect his broom on the way out. He got as far as the porch before he wished he’d stayed, but it was for that very reason he needed to go. Harry couldn’t be pushed to get over this divorce. He couldn’t be rushed into a new relationship and Draco cherished his friendship with Harry too much to lose it by being the rebound man. Already missing the feel of Harry’s kisses, Draco decided to wait and see what Harry said when they spoke next before making any more life – or relationship – altering decisions. So, with a sad glance back at the house, Draco apparated home.
"Pup! How are you?  What's this about squibs and dementors and potions?" Sirius rushed over but the device held him back.
Smiling to himself, Draco changed into his newest bathing suit before heading to the kitchen. He took the water pitcher and two glasses with him into the bathroom and cast a cooling charm to keep it chilled.
In the old days, he would ask Hermione or Dumbledore about it. Now, of course, he’d be hesitant to ask anyone, but he'd written to his solicitor last night and hopefully he wouldn't have to ask.
The blond wasn’t far behind but he was a little off balance with Lyra in his arms, so Harry had to catch him. He didn’t say anything but, with the sparkle in his grey eyes, Harry could almost hear Draco joking about his hero complex. That being the case, the brunette wasn’t terribly shocked to feel the soft pressure of Draco’s lips on his cheek a moment later.
“Erm…Harry, I’m getting peckish…I know it’s nearly dinner but I think a snack is in order.” Draco said quietly. “We can always have dinner a little bit late…right?”
"There are a few more things I'll teach her before she can come home to you, Mr. Malfoy-Potter," Jon grinned. "I'll bring her here in late May and then Arthur can bring her to you where she'll stay."
Madam Pomphrey caught up with Harry and Draco quickly and informed them of the things Draco would need for the length of his pregnancy. "There are vitamin potions and stomach calming draughts. He'll start the morning sickness soon if he gets it at all. Most men are lucky enough to escape that part of pregnancy while almost all women must endure it."
He started to chatter about their friends and she just smiled and commented on his ideas until their food was gone.
“Oh, yes...well...” Draco paused with a wince as Harry touched the darkened skin. “Viktor and I were out flying the other day and I fell.”
Draco flushed. "If I remember correctly, I believe you gave me a choice, Harry. You made it clear that you wanted me but let me choose to give myself…and I did."
"Go have a seat at the table. I'll have the elves serve and only be a moment." Harry hurried to update his cousins.
The elves looked surprised to have this decision placed in their hands but held a rapid conversation in their own language before once again facing their masters. “Dinki and Dooley are believing that Kreacher is the suitable elf to accompany the Masters to Hogwarts.” Dooley bowed his head as he finished speaking.
"Will he wake up soon?" Draco asked as he reached out to touch the baby's hand as Harry had moments before. "I'd love to hold him; play with him."
Harry’s appetite almost spoiled when they mentioned snail slime and animal blood so he politely asked them to avoid shop talk at the table.
“That would be great.” Harry smiled. “The summer is the busiest time of year for us. The whole of our year gave birth between July and the end of September so we have many events to attend. That’s not to mention my own birthday and Draco’s which just passed.”
Harry took his wand and placed it to his temple to remove his memory of the last hour. Then he stood up. “I have paperwork and I want to see Draco later. I’m not going anywhere.”
Harry chuckled uncomfortably and scratched his neck. “Well, blonds are definitely my type, you see and...Damn if he isn’t the hottest blond male I know of.”
"The potion will only be effective for two weeks." Narcissa informed them. "If you haven't taken it by then you'll need a new one. Let us know."
On August sixth, Lavender was shopping with Theo in Diagon when she fainted. She was taken directly to St. Mungo’s and diagnosed with preeclampsia. Eustace Theodore Nott was born just a week early so, leaving the twins with Draco’s parents and Dinki, Harry and Draco ventured out to visit her.
Harry noticed Narcissa bite her lip and wink at him covertly which caused him to choke on his coffee. Conversation remained light and comforting for the rest of the meal.
Harry smirked. “Good…You deserve a good marriage, Luna. You’re a sweet person and a good friend. May I congratulate you on your baby?”
"He did but then, he sent me back there every year knowing they hated me." Harry said grimly, ignoring Snape's scoff. "But thanks to you, I was able to see the strange light in his eye when I told him we sparred a bit before I got the cup back and returned to the school."
Seated in a dark corner of the cinema Harry felt bold. He’d heard stories of people who had seen couples having sex in dark corners of otherwise crowded places. Now he wanted to try it. “Dragon…” Harry whispered taking one of Draco’s hands in his own. “Would you like to sit in my lap?”
Lucius was sipping a cup of tea when Harry joined them in the sitting room. He nodded politely and motioned with his eyes toward the room’s other occupants.
She’d looked him in the eye and seemed to evaluate him for a moment before nodding her approval. “I’ve heard tell of the things you witnessed during the war, Mr. Malfoy-Potter. I believe you.” She then handed him sanitary robes and insisted he change. “I’ll numb the area before making the cut. Your job is to keep him calm and focused on you.”
"I can't count on Voldie, though he is technically my cousin. I'm seriously considering the Malfoys." Harry admitted softly. "Something about the way the lake appeared in my dream just pushes my thoughts in their direction."
Draco glared a moment longer before sweeping off toward the lagoon. He hurried through the garden and as he entered his favorite place on the grounds, he tried to recall which direction Nagini had come from.
Draco sighed. “Harry, I was going to suggest that he pick the first topic anyway. Shall we just go ahead?”
It was Harry's turn to smirk. "Ah. Well...there lies an interesting coincidence. We seem to have had an unofficial truce since the end of the war trials, so I was thinking of friendship...until I happened to be in a small alcove yesterday afternoon and overheard an interesting conversation."
Draco shivered at the thought of either one. “Isn’t there something in the middle?” Harry’s grin would’ve been enough to harden his cock if it wasn’t already. Draco squeaked in surprise as Harry lifted him into strong arms and placed him on the bed.
Lips met creamy white skin as Harry pressed Draco against the cool tiles in their shower. The tiles warmed slowly when Harry touched one with his wand and Draco gave a sigh when Harry reached around him to play with the faucets.
Lucius’ eyes widened as Narcissa, Pansy and Andromeda all glared his way. Harry focused on his upset husband instead; patting his shoulder and rubbing his arm.
“According to the journal from Merlin’s vault, the first ability to manifest in a dragonlord is usually sensing the presence of a dragon.” Lucius informed Harry. “The next stage is to feel the emotions of a dragon or flight of dragons.”
The last new student went to Hufflepuff and everyone looked to Dumbledore to signal the elves but he sat silently for a moment longer to allow Professor Mcgonagall time to move the hat and stool behind the podium.
“By your choice as well as Draco’s, you are my son’s Dominant husband. You are a member of the Malfoy family and no one will take your family from you again.” The elder blond looked like some kind of avenging angel.
Draco thought for a moment and stood up. He went to the end of his desk and bent at the hip while placing his hands on either side. “This would work, and the back of the couch in the sitting room is just about this height as well.”
"No need to talk, is there?" Vernon aimed a smirking glance at Harry before looking at his son. "He's put us all in danger from creatures and other freaks like him. I won't have him here any longer! The freak has endangered us and corrupted you. He'll have to leave."
“I’m sorry.” Draco held Lyra a bit tighter as he thought of her or her brother going off to school…having a family… being on a different continent from him and Harry…fighting in a war…dying…
“You were gone for quite a while with my mother, Harry.” Draco said softly as they walked down the hall.
"It's in my trunk. I had it on but felt too warm, so I took it off." Draco pulled out one of his monogrammed handkerchiefs and blew his nose.
. He’s here somewhere, Mione. Come through.” He checked the hallway and peeked into the sitting room before she reached his side. “Do you think he saw the prophet yet?” He asked as they moved toward the kitchen.
"Potter Grove... I haven't been here since we were children, Moony." Sirius whispered in a reverent tone.
“Mistress…Polli is being sorry to say this.” The elf had tears in her eyes. “Missy Dromeda is not awakening.”
“She told him that she was sick and that she might be going to heaven soon. She also told me that she mentioned missing her husband and daughter.” Harry informed the blond. “Teddy’s four years old now. I wonder if he’ll ask about her or still want to talk about her…”
“Oh yes, and then you’d be annoyed at me for an altogether different reason, this morning.” Harry rolled his eyes before tipping the blond’s face up to look at him. “Draco, I’d rather you be annoyed at me for embarrassing you than because you’ve done something harmful to the babies. From now on, when I tell you it’s time for bed, you’ll go without objections. Am I understood?”
He was a lot calmer with his arm around his husband. They entered the apartment and Kreacher greeted them with dinner on the table.
“The Christmas before last, I got Molly a lovely pair of pearl earrings. This year I want to get her a necklace to match.” Harry told his husband as he opened the door.
Harry's eyes widened but he didn't know what surprised him more, Dudley studying voluntarily or the twins entertaining Remus without knowing a few key details. Stepping into the kitchen, Harry cleared his throat to announce himself. "Molly?"
"You mean Snivelus." Sirius grimaced but he couldn't stand the thought of Harry going to this meeting alone.
Harry nodded and stood. The walk wasn’t long but it calmed him. The training room had dummies set up with fake wands and they looked mildly threatening. He didn’t even give his friend and partner a chance to take aim. He fired off so many hexes and curses that Ron just ducked behind a bookcase and rode out the storm of Harry’s temper. Some of them were nasty ones, like the Sectumsempra curse and others were simple but still deadly like Bombarda. Some were even juvenile like Ginny’s Bat-Bogey Hex. Ron didn’t see Harry get this way very often or over something petty and it was never anything good that came of it. When Harry fell silent, Ron peeked around the corner to see Harry kneeling on the ground surrounded by bits and pieces of debris.
“It looks...weirdly enough... like the inside of a hen house.” Draco muttered in disdain and feeling everyone’s eyes upon him, he shrugged. “My Uncle Xeno has chickens.”
“Well, I'm not practicing for the ballet! What does it look like?” The boy in question was in absolute distress. “Please help me get off this platform?”
For Draco’s birthday, Harry invited Lucius and Narcissa to tea and all of their friends came to the apartment for a lovely party that same night. He opened many gifts and accepted lots of well-wishes for his nineteenth birthday. Among Draco’s birthday gifts had been Neville’s promise of a potions garden, so Harry gladly told Neville that he could bring a small contingent of Longbottom elves onto the estate in Kent during the summer holidays. The Longbottom heir knew of Draco’s dream to run a small apothecary and this was something he could do to show Draco that the past truly was past. Secretly, Harry began to take note of things other apothecaries sold and was sure to include all potions ingredients, regardless of their prices or the level of danger in use – he was only creating a list, after all.
As he was leaving the apartment, Fred and George walked up. "So, we came up with something to punish Luna's bullies but Gin has another idea and we kind of like it."
Harry sighed. “Is that why you really left that day we all went flying? You wanted us to have time alone to figure that out for ourselves?”
George grinned and began to tell the story. “So yesterday, Ron was constructing the new crib and Angelica wanted attention but only her daddy would do, so she wasn’t happy at all when he wouldn’t play with her…”
"Fudge is afraid and he's ruled by his fears, Harry." Remus said grimly. "His plan seems to be discrediting you and those who appear to be your allies. Keep going."
“Me too...” Draco mumbled with a light stain of pink on his cheeks. “Pansy just canceled on me, actually… Y-You really wouldn’t mind following along on my errands?”
“I never said that...did I?” A smirk appeared on the blond’s face. “Sorry, Harry...Old habits, you know?”
The food dishes slowly disappeared from the tables, except for Draco’s apple sauce, which seemed to get refilled quite often.
"I'm not. I'm just calling it as I see it. Look at him! Draco is my husband and we're in HIS home and he looks like he's on the verge of tears!" Harry hissed at her. "You did that!"
"Now I've missed my window to enjoy breakfast." Harry growled in the direction his cousin had gone off in. "Dobby, can you get me some fruit or something?" Dobby appeared with a plate of fresh fruit from which Harry took an apple and suggested the rest be placed on the desk in the sitting room.
Harry shook the skeleton key out of the envelope and into his hand. It was old and made of bronze. There was a bird at one end with his wings outstretched encircling a deep blue sapphire and it carried with it a sense of something about to happen. He stuck the envelope into his pocket but held the key up to show the others before pushing it into the lock.
Lucius lifted an eyebrow skeptically, but Severus nodded. “I see the merit but we seem to have lost the urgency that brought the meeting sooner than planned.”
“I thought-” Zack hesitated but only for a moment. “I thought Malfoy was searching Slytherin with you tomorrow.”
Harry woke up first and saw everything. The elves had decorated the suite. The fireplace mantle and columns had been laden with evergreen boughs and holly that were tied with white and red ribbons. The bathroom door was adorned with a wreath and a small tree with white twinkling lights stood in the sitting area. A pile of gifts was arranged neatly under it. Harry smiled thinking that he’d need to thank Dinki for doing that.
Dudley stared at his cousin in amazement and had to dab away a tear. All the times he'd been less than fair to Harry and here he was doing something like this. He resolved to never act that way again.
“And I can’t promise you that I’ll spontaneously change my whole personality…” Lucius went on as Harry swiped away his tears. “But if you can forgive me for everything that has happened since then perhaps Narcissa...and I...can try to be there for you as well as our son.”
Harry started to nod but then he noticed something else and put some things together. "No need. I know who I can ask."
Harry looked up into the older man’s eyes. “Did you? It’s always nice to meet people who knew them.”
He looked well...for having survived a war, not to mention his houseguests during said war and the house arrest that had been his sentence...he looked awfully fit also. Seeing that Malfoy was finishing his task, Harry whirled around and grabbed Michelle's hand as he rushed back to her side.
“Was something supposed to happen?” Blaise looked mildly curious but his tone let Teddy know just how interested he really was.
“I forgave you as soon as you’d been properly punished, Dragon.” Harry hugged the blond tighter. “That’s how punishments work. If you do something wrong, you get punished and then it’s over. The slate is wiped clean and I won’t punish you for it again unless it happens again.”
“Then, why are you sad? From the sound of that kiss, you should be over at his house rather than here.” Teddy waved vaguely around himself to indicate the house.
Harry grinned as sped up to get inside the suite. He hurried directly into his office and pulled out the letter from his solicitor. He cheered when he finished skimming it. "The first puzzle piece is almost in my hands!"
Harry didn't like the idea of sending the private news of Draco's pregnancy in an owl because he was just so used to worrying about information ending up in the wrong hands.
The morning of Draco's birthday dawned with a delightful surprise in the form of a fluttery movement in his belly which woke him from slumber. Without thinking, he shouted his husband's name as loudly as he could while placing one hand where his daughter had just made her presence known.
Harry fluffed the tree branches and placed a Notice-Me-Not charm on the special Christmas ornament he'd gotten. It was also charmed to only open at Draco's touch but Harry wanted everything to be just right. Draco would be arriving any moment and Harry still had other things to do.
Hurrying toward his apartment, he couldn’t wait to tell Draco all about the class. As he got close to the Flint apartment, Harry started to have a bad feeling… When he got to the portrait of the boy in Quidditch gear and found it open with nobody in sight Harry almost had a panic attack. “Draco?” He called tentatively.
“No. I’m fine – really.” Teddy hid his face in his godfather’s stomach as he hugged Harry. “I was having so much fun looking at the book and it wasn’t till Draco got up that I felt it and had to run.”
He was also the man who'd put that stone to use as bait for a psycho in a school full of innocent children. He was also the man who'd made Harry participate in a barbaric tournament that could've killed him when he was just fourteen. Now to find out that his misdeeds went much further back in time than Harry could have expected was just too much. The man would pay. Somehow he would pay for his crimes.
“Good. That was very good, my darlings. Now let’s put them together. Say ‘please come, Papa’.” Harry reached down just as Caelum pulled himself up to stand next to Harry’s knee and carded though the strawberry blond locks.
"Please move my things to the largest room on the fourth floor." Harry requested. "Also, Dudley's things should be moved to the master bedroom. He'll be much more comfortable there since he's living here long term."
"Is that just a pile of cushions?" Harry chuckled in surprise. "An overstuffed couch... centuries old tapestries ...so chaotic but all tied together by the yellow and black patterns. I love it! Dobby! Our sitting room needs colorful cushions!"
Harry looked at her and chuckled. "Of course you do. I'm getting a special tutor for it because of the family secrets."
“Shhh…” Harry whispered. “Deep breaths, Dragon; it’s okay…just relax…you’re safe. It was just a dream.”
"Well, I suppose that sounds more feasible than the idea of one person out there who is destined to be your perfect mate." Draco smirked. “I mean how long would it take to find that one specific person in the entire population of the world that makes you whole? What are the odds you would find them at all, much less be born during the right generation?”
The boys felt the tingle of magic performed on them and the Minister just nodded. Seconds later, Harry saw Dean and Ginny pass the same group; the Minister nodded again. Ron and Hermione took their turn and, after yet another nod from Kingsley, they all went back to the table.
“I mean anyone.” Harry quickly corrected him. “The Malfoys will be there as well as Snape... and let’s not forget that the whole reason for the meeting is that Voldemort himself wants to talk to me.” When Sirius remained silent, Harry pushed the final button. “Now, I’ve asked that Wormtail be excluded for everyone’s safety, but I can’t exclude the main person of interest.”
Harry watched her fly over the grove before allowing himself to become distracted by the black dog running around in the garden. That reminded him; if he wanted to become an animagus, he'd need tutoring so he hurried off to join his dogfather in the garden. When he arrived at the section of garden where he'd spotted Sirius, he laughed so hard he needed to support himself against the nearest tree.
“They did very well today.” Harry sighed happily before his gaze turned sly. “Caelum? Can you tell Daddy why we learned the word owl today…”
"You remember what we discussed about the dreams, Blaise." Draco looked around the dormitory. With the others gone, he could talk about it so, as a precaution, Draco cast muffliato around their beds. "With my heritage, I could have any number of powers I don't know about yet. Let’s not forget that Potter's mere presence was enough to trigger an early awakening of them. Now that he knows he's the lost son, anything can happen."
"Well, when you rushed in and announced that the meeting had to be moved up, I knew whatever had riled you was important." She told him as they came to a stop. "Draco, to a certain extent, we've been quite strict with you but you're getting to the age where you need to have enough confidence in yourself to make choices and follow through on them."
“If it’s female, it lays eggs but only another basilisk can fertilize them and not many wizards are willing or able to contain more than one basilisk.” Tom went on. “If it’s male and you give it the eggs of any compatible snake species, it will fertilize them but, as I'm sure you're aware, basilisks don't reproduce in the usual way. So when this happens the only trait that's passed on from the basilisk is venom and it's not as potent as the basilisk's. It probably won't even be as potent as Nagini's."
After the glow faded, Loveday took the quill and found a small blank margin…he drew one short line and when it disappeared, they knew it had worked.
“Oh, right!” She swished her wand to conjure the jar with Imperturbable and Unbreakable spells on it and then she looked around for Rita’s animagus form. “You remember, Ron. That pesky flying insect problem we had…in fourth and fifth year…”
Harry nodded and allowed a small smile to form as the boat finally began to slow. It blossomed as the vessel sailed through the illusion of the cliffs without a hitch. Walls of stone were on either side of them for several long moments until they suddenly burst forth into a large hidden cove. “That’s what I was hoping to find, Dudley.” He pointed to the island that dominated the space.
"Roody, please find something suitable for Winky to wear." Harry said softly. "Winky, I'd like you to help Roody here for now. I'll find you the right permanent home soon but since my family is in residence at Raven's Roost just now I think we need you here. Dobby, I have a favor to ask you...please stay."
“You disobey me and then think to cover it up while suffering the effects of that self-same disobedience?” Harry’s emerald eyes were flashing with anger and Draco was almost shaking with fear. “How many times have I asked you to take care of yourself, Draco?”
"Understandable and I may have excused you for simply being tardy but since you did not arrive until the last five minutes of class..." Flitwick paused since Harry didn’t stop what he was doing. “May I ask what you’re doing?”
Harry stood just to the side of his husband and placed his hand on the other man’s pale globes of flesh. “This is not for pleasure but punishment. Repeat to me your crime, Draco.”
"Dobby, what I'm about to tell you might change your mind about the headmaster." Harry told him with a frown. He then filled his little elf friend in on the summer's discoveries.
“Her position as first-born notwithstanding, it is her brother who is the official Malfoy heir.” Lucius went on motioning to his wife.
“V-Viktor was here.” Draco looked around worriedly and clung to a half-naked Harry. “He saw us kiss and raised his wand with the killing curse on his lips.”
Once the floo activated Draco whirled on his father. “What were you thinking?! We’ve just barely begun our relationship and you know how he is!"
The woman was young, with pale skin and hair that was a dark reddish brown. “It was tragic but not unexpected, Rax. I was never in the best of health to begin with. It’s lovely to meet you, Mr. Potter.” She curtsied to Harry.
“Yes, our little Alison is asleep for the moment.” Seamus sighed happily taking a sip of lemonade. “It’s nice to have a slight reprieve. She’s been colicky lately.”
Draco shivered slightly as Harry repeated the words he’d said that day. “I haven’t forgotten how it felt to have your arms around me as we soared above the flames.”
Draco whimpered as Harry breached his opening and began pushing further in. He moaned loudly with every centimeter that filled him. Harry kept pushing in at a slow but steady rate until Draco was fully seated on his cock and then he stopped to allow Draco time to accept the intrusion.
The brunette looked his husband over carefully. He felt the leash of control he had around the blond as a tangible thing. “You’re so beautiful…my Dragon…”
“Ten sickles says - he’s looking to find the entrance to Slytherin’s secret quarters before me and not finding anything.” Harry snorted. “Five more sickles says - he’s got Zabini helping.”
“This has nothing to do with traditional BDSM, Harry.” Astoria informed the man who might become the savior of her livelihood, while carding her fingers through her husband’s platinum locks. “His very subconscious tells him that he must submit and he does submit… in everything.”
Draco snatched the other two pieces and placed Harry’s piece between his teeth before leaning in for a kiss. Then he laid back and ate his own.
“I’ll have to thank him later,” Harry whispered pulling the blond back into his arms. “Let’s slip out, love. We’ll see all of these people at King’s Cross in a few days time.”
Draco smiled and moved Harry’s hand from one side of his stomach to the other just in time for Harry to feel the next slight flutter.
“Did you tell the aurors that I was one of the accusers?” Harry asked, glancing at the nearby auror.
Harry rolled the words over in his mind. He'd heard from many people that Dumbledore had been a very amiable person in his youth. He'd been friendly and outgoing - charming and sociable but he was still all of those things so what exactly was this nutter saying?
Harry's mind was racing. He looked at Remus again. "Could this have something to do with your 'headquarters' remark earlier?  Did my parents perhaps authorize him to one of the accounts?"
“Control?” Draco smirked. He was surprised the she would bring up such a topic. “Since the beginning of the war, Harry seems to have become more decisive and…well, inspiring. With me, he just…”
A moment later a deep gravelly voice cleared their throat. "Mr. Potter, please follow me. Your guests may join us."
When Harry reached the nursery he saw that Lucius had arrived before him. The older man was just finishing up with Caelum who always woke before the others.
April came quickly and soon enough they were welcoming Hermione's new baby boy. Ron and Hermione appreciated their gift of a new crib - especially when they watched it assemble itself. They also appreciated that Harry and Draco wanted to spend more time with their daughter, Angelica. They knew they would need help with controlling her powerful magic.
Harry stared at Draco a moment longer before turning to face their guests. He swept his god daughter into his arms for a quick hug before placing the little one into the warded play area with the twins. “Draco says we haven’t gotten anything from the ministry. What’s your letter about?”
Harry grinned. “I’ll show you the memory in my Pensieve. He apologized and then proceeded to comfort me. It was quite an experience to hear that man tell me that if I could forgive his past crimes against me, then he and your mother would try to be there for both of us rather than just you.”
“Here we are.” Lucius stated solemnly. “Harry, this residence is tainted by neither the war nor the presence of the Dark Lord.”
The blond's lips twitched as he took his place in Harry's arms. "You know, Potter... I think I'll like this role more than I ever considered."
“Dobby helped me and my friends many times. He wasn’t happy as a Malfoy elf and I found a way to free him,” Harry told her quietly. “I was there when he died.”
“You’re only one person, Harry!” Molly broke in. “You’re not alone in this world. You have family…friends…Draco.”
"Dragon?" His mother asked from the doorway. "Are you sure you don't want to wait a few days to go back?"
“Well, I’ll tell our circle that you’re home. I’m sure some of them were friends of yours.” Harry took the papers and smiled. “I’ll just fill these out so we can go.”
“H-Happened? N-Nothing... happened...?” He kept flashing back to the fall and the kiss and he sighed when he saw the knowing look in her eyes. “Draco and I got there first. We just chatted a bit until Harry got there and then we all went up to the pitch at Hogwarts. Draco set the snitch loose and they’d just started to look for it when I got called away.”
"Well, now, lad, my little corner of the world is just outside of Loch Ness, which is to the south a-ways." MacLeod informed them and gestured toward the water. "That there's Loch Dochfour."
"This session will be your first." Zack's eyes widened. "The members don't really know where you stand on most issues because they're not in direct contact with you. Those of them that have school aged relatives don't know or care about the opinions of children."
Harry cradled the blond for a moment before cleaning them both up and settling into bed beside him. The two young men slept for a while but Harry woke to find Draco rubbing against him begging for another session of love making. This time Harry was gentle and sweet as he lubed and stretched his husband. He kept Draco on his back and reveled in giving his Dragon as much pleasure as he could. They slept the rest of the night and into the next morning.
This gave Draco a mission and, when Harry got him back to the Manor, he insisted on a visit to the family tree tapestry in the library. After escorting Draco to his intended destination and calling Dinki to attend him, Harry went looking for his in-laws. He found Lucius reading in his office and, after knocking on the door, he walked woodenly to the sofa across from the desk.
"It's called the Scepter of Dagobert. It was created in the seventh century, stored in a French basilica with many other treasures from the French regalia and stolen in the late seventeen hundreds by an unknown perpetrator." Bill explained. "According to my research, its maker, Eloi - Dagobert's treasurer, was a wizard who specialized in goldsmithing. He imbued it with several magical abilities via runes. Parselmagic is among them as shown by this rune meaning serpent. It’s called iar."
“Teddy Lupin – though not a blood relative – is also a very beloved member of our family and the new Black heir.” Draco announced with a gesture toward the little boy.
“Nothing! It was nothing. Viktor and I had a horrific row when I called her ‘Granger’ during dinner that first time...and I was just...” Draco trailed off seeing that Harry wasn’t fooled.
“Lucius blames Draco for being abused…says he could’ve stopped it or escaped it. He pointed out that Draco wasn’t under constant threat. He worked and socialized and such so he could’ve gone to the authorities during one of those times.” Harry told her.
“St. Mungo’s.” Draco called as he threw the powder. He disappeared in a puff of green fire and Harry only waited thirty seconds to follow him.
Korlag had found an ideal shop location in Hogsmeade and helped to secure it. Lee and his father had been in contact with Korlag and the twins, and the whole reason Fred and George were asked to go down to the bank was to see the site via memory in a pensieve and sign more papers if they approved... which they did. That night they planned to pack up all of their experimental materials and current projects to be moved into the basement of the shop. The next day they'd place the wards. Sadly this meant that they'd be meeting Harry, Ron, and the girls at the Hogsmeade station instead of traveling with them.
"Hum again if you meant that as a 'yes', my love..." Harry said gripping the hair in both hands. The second hum made him smile as he moved in an out of his husband's mouth with a smooth rhythm.
“I hope it’s alright that I assumed you’d enjoy being in proximity to your friends…” McGonagall said with a smirk.
Harry’s gaze turned predatory and he adopted a smirk. “You look so beautiful, lying there, Dray…” He licked his lips and moved to stand at the foot of the bed. Draco’s legs were slightly spread so Harry had a good view of his body. “Take your cock in your hands…I want to watch you touch yourself, Dragon.”
The brunette was overcome with pleasure at just the sight, so he took his place between Draco’s legs and pushed slowly into the welcoming heat of his husband’s body. The baby-bump didn’t let him close enough to kiss Draco’s lips but Harry could kiss him any time he wanted so he settled himself as deeply inside the blond’s body as he could before beginning to move. It didn’t take long for Draco to start gasping and moaning in pleasure. He set a steady rhythm with the movement of his hips and Draco met him thrust for thrust until Harry groaned loudly with the words they both wanted to hear.
Draco hadn’t minded Harry grabbing onto him but now he felt the need to stay close because he was undeniably creeped out by the room.
Neville and Seamus ended up joining the Weasleys when they arrived while Lavender and Theo took Selene to join the group in the garden.
“That sounds familiar…” Draco said frowning softly as he dug into his memory. “In ancient Greece, men would eat a large orchid tuber to be sure their child would be a boy. Women…or Bearers…would eat several small tubers to make it a girl.”
“I assumed they behaved that way normally, Harry…and we haven’t been entertaining any other children.” Molly shrugged her shoulders. “Why don’t you go up and visit Hermione and then head home? I’m sure Draco misses you by now.”
Draco peeked back out the door and Harry could see that he was undressed. “Why not? You’re not the one who’s not allowed to wank…”
“They say my mourning period for Marion is long over and they want me to marry again to procreate,” Marcus sighed.
Hary flushed. "Well we were at the nearby park. I'd noticed an increase of owls in the area but only Hedwig was coming to the Dursley house so I thought that if I could go for a walk or something the owls would find me...anyway Dudley and I were heading back for dinner and the dementors caught us in the small tunnel between blocks. It was just me and him. I saw them and panicked at first because I was with a muggle and I didn't want to get in trouble - underage magic and all. But they forced the issue and I had to cast the patronus spell."
Harry didn’t know how to control his instincts yet so he just stayed still as his unknowing husband lifted him up.
“You lied to me...What else did you do, Draco? What did you say to her in that letter?” Harry frowned.
Harry hadn’t thought of that but it did sound reasonable. “And your parents? Will they be as amenable to this plan? Will they come with us too or will they stay here with the children?”
He'd heard other boys...straight boys... talk about girls and their breasts and knew he didn't feel the same way. Then he'd heard Dean and Seamus talking about sex and male quidditch players and he was easily able to imagine the feel of a flat chest and six pack of abs pressed against his own lightly toned body.
Lucius cleared his throat and cast Sonorus. “Mr. Potter was indisposed. He’s better now, and the wedding will go on as planned. He will be joining us in just a moment.”
Tom nodded immediately. "I was in Romania for a while after my injury when you were young. I stayed with him and we settled on a code. I will set things in motion and let you know when we can expect him."
Draco didn’t know how he was still upright. Harry was creating such bliss inside him that he should’ve come ages ago but was somehow restrained. He recalled the ring just as Harry found the tiny bunch of nerves that made up his prostate. His eyes flew open. “Oh-ooh!! Harry, yes!!”
While the Director was speaking to Sirius, Olgok was busy mixing a new potion. As he brewed it, he spoke. "The potions that are influencing you are dangerous because they're blocking your natural tendencies. Your body should've absorbed more of the nutrients in your food over the years. Your mind should've been able to absorb more knowledge. With so many powerful witches and wizards in your family your innate knowledge of magic should be more developed than it is - even considering the disconnection and being raised by squibs."
Harry sighed and added the potion to both cups before sitting down. “I think I know what you’ll say, Andromeda, but go on. We’re listening.”
It was a little quiet as they ate but Harry didn’t mind because they were together and Draco had finally opened up to him a bit. He finally felt like the friend he’d wanted to become. As such he thought back over the things Draco had said. “What are the other reasons that are stopping you from getting out of there, Draco?”
Draco lowered himself to his knees in the puddle of clothing and kissed Harry’s feet which were still covered by the man’s shoes. “You know I did… Master.”
“I’m loyal to you, Draco.” Blaise declared. “As far as I’m concerned, he’s the Dragonlord’s consort.”
Draco watched Harry Potter and his redheaded companions walk into the great hall. The way they were acting made him suspicious. Something had happened.
The dog's demeanor changed from proud and confident to cautious. She seemed to know she was being tested.
Lucius appeared to seriously consider this. “They need correction if they misbehave. Those things are punishment.”
Draco twitched and squirmed when the feather caressed his balls but whined when Harry bent to begin a different activity.
"I'll bet you think it'll be me...but Seamus is actually the submissive in our marriage." Neville smirked.
Draco moaned from the words alone and adjusted his position to accept Harry’s member. Lowering himself gently and yet deliberately onto Harry, Draco felt his muscles stretch and mold around the man he’d come to love. When Draco felt his husband’s hair tickle his ass, he looked deep into the emerald eyes and began to move up and down on Harry’s arousal. “Harry, I – I – I can’t – I don’t want the control, Harry… It’s not who I am!” The blond panted remembering his husband’s promise from that morning. “I love how it feels to be yours, Harry.”
"The Ollivander family has been making wands since the second century." Harry informed his cousin. "The wandmaker who sold me my wand was the most recent generation of the family, I suppose."
“Draco, I’m going to look you over now so I hope you’re ready. Your nipples are pierced…good. Your pubes are bald… I’m glad. Your cock is nice and hard…very good.” Harry was touching each part of Draco’s anatomy as he inspected it, “Your hole is perfectly clean, and ready for me…You’re such a good boy, Draco!”
“Thank you all for being there today to show your support as I took my next steps into adulthood. So much is changing in my life...” Harry’s voice trailed off for a moment as he recognized the echo of Ron’s words and glanced in his friend’s direction. “You know, change doesn’t have to be a bad thing. I’m older; yes...but I’m really just seeing the world in new ways and gaining control of my life. Everyone needs to take those steps one day and it may be that it’s happening earlier than you think it should but I feel ready.”
2nd Pregnancy (6 months later)              December 1999 – September 2000                           - Louis Alexander
Being manhandled this way had Draco moaning in pleasure but was quite restricted with the cage around his cock.
Having just left the university library after being there for almost eight hours, Harry was completely drained of energy. He agreed enthusiastically with his friend when she tugged on his arm to pull him into the usual coffee shop.
“I’ll do that.” Harry’s lips curled into a grin and tilted his head toward the blond. “I like this...”
Draco felt Harry’s hand as it was dragged from his belly to his buttocks. Quite suddenly, Harry’s other hand joined the first and they pulled in opposite directions, spreading Draco wide…and then he felt it. Something, he knew that it was Harry’s tongue, was pushing at the sensitive puckered skin hidden there. The tight ring loosened under Harry’s insistence and Draco moaned at the intimate intrusion. The blond whimpered and whined as his husband continued his onslaught of pleasure.
"I was thinking of Braxton Aloysius for our little boy and Wisteria Asphodel for our lovely princess." Draco said dreamily.
A well organized – and beautiful – potions garden was laid out with a border of harmless plants and flowers that would protect the children incase they got too close. All the herbs that Kreacher and Dinki would need for the cooking were in a collection of pots near the door leading inside while everything Draco would need for their household potions and the apothecary was in the ground. Some were night blooming and some would blossom during the day. There were also some plants that would be useful either way. There was even a hothouse for the plants that didn’t normally grow in the United Kingdom.
Harry murmured a quick 'thank you' and left the room. Eager to see if Ron had settled in, Harry knocked on the door to his room. He wasn't expecting the storm cloud that greeted him.
"You did say 'lots of coffee'." Harry grinned. "I asked them to keep it coming until I signaled differently."
Draco stared at the snake and knew Harry was about to speak parseltongue. He hurried to the door and called out for his uncle.
“Probably nothing, mate. Things are just coming together.” Ron said with a yawn. “Let’s sleep on it. See you at breakfast.”
“And the Wheezeys too?” Teddy’s eyes widened as Harry confirmed this. “That’s a lotta people!” The little boy sat quietly for another moment before nodding his sad acceptance. “So what’s the other things you wanna talk about?”
Draco glanced at Harry’s face and then back at Pansy’s. “What if there was someplace for you to go?”
It wasn’t long before both infants were full and Harry laid Lyra into her bassinet which was next to the bed he shared with Draco. As he lifted the covers and settled himself next to his beloved husband, he was vaguely aware of Dinki placing Caelum in his own bassinet. Harry carefully cuddled up close to Draco, who sighed in his sleep and moved unconsciously into the space Harry wanted him.
“I took a few moments to speak with the boy, Harry.” Lucius chose his words with care as he watched the younger man. “He told me to some extent what you said after Andromeda died – that he didn’t have to worry and he had many people looking out for him and that we all love him. I applaud your approach to things of this nature as I unfortunately have no finesse with young children. When my father fell ill and died I was brutally honest with my son.”
“I know.” Draco sighed quietly. “But things are complicated right now. I need to take some time and look some things up and maybe talk to my father. It could be related to... well, you know..."
As soon as Pansy was settled again, the trio walked to the nearest wizarding establishment and flooed to its Godric’s Hollow equivalent. Harry pointed out the chapel and they all walked over.
“Harry,” Narcissa began as he sat down. “Did you and Draco get the letter I sent you – the one asking about anything we could get to accommodate both of your needs during your stay?”
Harry was speechless at the news but instantly enclosed Draco’s shuddering body in his arms. The still-pregnant blond was inconsolable for almost half an hour. Harry soothed and cuddled his husband until he finally calmed, then carefully explained to his adopted family that miscarriage was one of Draco’s worst fears.
He tilted the box so everyone could see. “Brooms! I’m sure you recall that mine was destroyed during the war. I’d mentioned it to Harry while we were courting and he confessed that his was lost as well.” Draco sniffed clutching Harry’s hand. “You remembered…”
Hermione and Ron made a point of pulling Harry away for a chat about his moodiness. When they found out about his depression and subsequent trip to the London Townhouse, Harry’s best friends made sure to speak comforting words while insisting on more visits and further contact between them.
“Viktor is a good friend of mine Harry. We lost touch for a short while during the war, but he was at Bill and Fleur’s wedding and she’s just given me his new contact information so we’ve reconnected.” Hermione told him sharply. “Now that he’s dating Malfoy, he’s decided that we should occasionally double date. Last night was lovely and Malfoy was very different…He was quiet and polite.”
"You can write to me or, since it's a special circumstance, you can call by floo or mirror that night." Harry grinned at him.
Lucius Malfoy stared at the paper in his hands; it was a letter from the ministry. Within seconds of snapping his fingers to call for one of his family’s many elves, one appeared. He told it to request his wife’s presence and then dismissed it. Several moments later, Narcissa Malfoy walked into his study.
“He’s always saying that he wishes he knew you better. He saw how you flew against that dragon and I think he’d love to fly against you.” Draco bit his lip. “Maybe you can get him to play a Seekers’ game someday. Will you join us for the game?”
When the sun rose the next morning, Harry couldn't wait to get to breakfast and see if Draco got the letter telling him about Harry's 'choice'. Ron and Hermione woke soon after he did so he waited until they were ready.
Harry hid a smirk while slipping Caelum’s shoes on and fastening them tightly. “Don’t whine. You’ll set a bad example for the babies.” Caelum giggled as Harry placed him into one side of a double occupant pram.
After picking up Lucius’ miniature, Harry approached and casually took in the opulence. “King sized four poster…lovely…as are the drapery and bedding. Draco, I’m impressed by the décor. Let’s see how impressive your obedience level can be. Shall we?”
"Yes. Then my friends weren't contacting me and my letters to them were coming back unopened... the newspaper wasn't even coming and there was no logical reason for it.” Harry explained. “So I began watching the skies... and the trees. Owls were coming but they weren't getting close enough to deliver anything to me. Hedwig wasn't restricted but she also wasn't bringing me mail and I wanted to know why."
"Fred and George think there's a loose brick in the fireplace mantle that could be a secret passage trigger." Ron tagged along as Harry made his way back to his suite which worked out well because it meant they could update each other on the search for the founder's quarters.
Korlag took them into the office where the arrangements were made to create a company called Marauders Ltd. Fifteen hundred galleons were set aside to be deposited into the vault dedicated to the company and the transaction would take place as soon as the paperwork was complete. Harry, Sirius, Remus and the Weasley twins would have exclusive access.
He thanked his friend and turned to face the group. "Ancient relics and artifacts of the magical world." He flipped to the table of contents. "Light and dark uses for objects of shadow... rituals to enchant objects..."
Harry blinked. His best friends were canceling on him? That never happened. Unwilling to give up time with his best mates, Harry shook his head. “Wait so…what other day can we get together, then?"
“Thank you, K-Kingsley.” Draco stammered in surprise. He’d always expected to become on a first name basis with the minister, but he’d never thought it would happen so soon or through his husband.
"Professor, before we start, I'd like to say that I appreciate you using my title in public... but in private, please feel free to be informal with me." Harry told her, quietly using his fork to cut his flapjacks. "You're my head of house and you know me well and you knew my parents. I don't want the title to come between us."
Harry gritted his teeth but grabbed a blanket and threw it at his cousin as he ran for the kitchen. Ripping open the refrigerator door he swiped  the cover off the black pudding container and pulled out the chocolate bar. He took a chunk for himself and handed the rest to Dudley who cowered on the couch. "Eat. You'll feel better in a bit. I don't know where your parents are but I'm not cooking until they're back."
Draco sat in Harry’s lap as he expressed his excitement and anticipation for the next lesson. “I have homework due next week, Harry. Al won’t be back until I’ve finished this assignment so I‘ll be doing more bookwork than anything over the next few days but the books are so interesting that we almost didn’t even notice what time it was.”
"Yes, Lord Potter; several." Korlag told him as he laid out a map of the British isles. "There are a number of castles in the UK that now belong to you but only the inhabitable ones are unplottable."
Harry and Draco looked at the pair and back at each other with a roll of their eyes before getting back to their meals.
Harry didn’t like the sound of that so he took another sip of water and watched Draco take a deep breath before matching his husband.
“Mione, I’m so sorry! I was just really excited that you’re pregnant with my baby!” Ron hugged her lightly. “I didn’t mean to hurt you, Sweetie!”
His own achievements were slow in coming, but Draco remained persistent. The third level of his training was getting more and more difficult and he was becoming more and more frustrated. He poured over books and notes but still couldn’t seem to understand why it was dangerous to mix calming potions and sleeping potions but valerian root could be added to a calming potion in order that the recipient could rest peacefully.
“Mother woke me when she came to help with the children.” Draco told him “She told me Andy’s solicitor is joining us for breakfast and it seems that she’s written letters to each of us.”
“Please to be excusing Dinki, Masters, but there is being an unknown person arriving in the floo.” Dinki said after popping into the dining room next to Harry’s chair.
“It’s ok, Dray. I’m sure I’ll be fine.” Harry told him, reluctantly pulling away from the other invisible boy. He and Lucius waited for the door to open and close before Harry took the cloak off. “What can I do for you, Lucius?”
“Being so good to Draco...” Narcissa said. “We love him...we do, but I now realize that our love always came with conditions. Yours doesn’t seem to and I’m glad of that.”
Hermione was so much better at dealing with information than him. He wished she was here right now. She could probably explain the logic behind all the recent events. Hermione had a knack for research and there was so much he needed to know. She’d left things off in June by wishing him a good summer. She’d hugged him. Something was clearly holding her back from replying today but she was her own person and could usually take care of herself. She was also friends with Ginny so hopefully they'd be in contact with one another and the Weasleys would tell her something or at least get her to write to him for details. She needed to know something was up with Dumbledore.
Near the end of the night, Blaise was speaking to Theo, Ron, Harry and Draco about a proper ceremony to announce godparents and such. Blaise had chosen Draco for godfather of Lawrence and Luna had asked Ginny to be godmother. Theo’s older sister was the only godparent to their son, Eustace, whom they were calling ‘Stacey’. Ron and Hermione had named Harry as the godfather to Angelica and hadn’t felt the need to name a godmother.
“Oh, just a little heads-up - if you do become my general assistant, you’ll be dealing with my business partners as well.” Harry smirked and held up the contract he, Remus, and Sirius had signed with the twins.
“Did Harry tell you about our potions garden, sir?” Draco asked smiling. “I’ll have to show it to you before you leave.”
2nd pregnancy (Pansy and Marcus)       December 2000 - September 4 2001                   - Adalia Sage Flint
"You are indeed, my young friend. Enjoy your reception..." The older man smiled and waved them forward.
"Bisbee? Tilly?" Harry called. As soon as they arrived, he asked for a box and a bunch of towels or old fabric. "This poor little owl was rejected by its mother. I'm going to find someone to take care of it."
“Well, we’re not. Please wait until we get to the suite?” Draco asked quietly, pushing Harry’s chest gently.
"Yes, well, it isn't meant to be waved, you see." She smiled kindly at him. "We utilize our powers just being in contact with the wand."
“They’re flowers of course. They grow in the jungles of the Arctic Circle and just being near a proper arrangement of them can fix any fertility problems they might be having,” the lovely blonde told him solemnly.
“This is even better than the one at the cinema; right Harry? Mmmm!” Draco’s eyes closed as he bit into his second slice.
“Oh! Draco, you’re awake!” His mother sounded overjoyed when she saw him but, when she noticed their mirth, she frowned. “What’s so funny, young men?”
“Yes, yes; of course! My grandson must be well rested!” Abraxas said enthusiastically. “Those babies of yours must be taking it out of him! Oh, and Harry...you may call me Rax.”
“And Lavender is on bedrest because of what happened during her first pregnancy.” Seamus rolled his eyes at his husband’s forgetfulness. “I told you that, Nev.”
The brunette rushed into the room. He was half naked and dripping wet but he just knew he’d heard Draco’s voice calling his name. So, of course he’d gone running.
“Draco, you don’t need to apologize every time the war is mentioned. It’s not your fault Voldemort did all those bad things.” Harry placed a comforting hand on the blond’s shoulder.
Harry turned to face the others. "The snake needs to test my blood. He's going to bite me but his venom doesn't affect the Potter bloodline so don't panic or interfere. If I don't allow it we won't be allowed in."
Harry huffed but went to his cupboard and took two tumblers from the shelf. Setting them down, Harry visibly calmed himself before greeting his old friend. "Hello, Dean. Nice to see you. What's new? Hired any former..."
Draco loved that game. His eyes fluttered closed as he prepared to resist becoming overwhelmed by the sensations Harry would bombard him with. Soon, his cock was surrounded by warmth and wetness but Draco just grinned and bit his lip, moaning lightly as he felt Harry’s lips close around him. He whimpered at the feel of teeth lightly skimming his sensitive flesh and, when the head of his cock came into contact with the back of Harry’s throat, Draco cried out in pleasure but wrapped his hands in the comforter below him still resisting the urge to come.
“I can...” Harry stared at his boyfriend. “We can have babies... without a potion that takes months to brew?”
"I had just started the Quibbler and was so entrenched in paperwork and legalities and trying to hire reporters and such that my dear Pandora was forced to shoulder most of the duties of parenting our sweet Luna." Father and daughter shared a smile. "She visited with Lily several times between June and September when the fidelis charm was applied for the last time."
"The key opened the boathouse on Loch Dochfour and gave us access to the boat that brought us here." Harry turned the envelope over to show the elf the name on the label. "I am the Earl of Inverness."
“Oh, you have an appointment with Madam Malkin’s for the new robes I promised. Be there tomorrow afternoon at one and she’ll take care of you both,” Lucius informed them as he unfolded the morning edition of the Daily Prophet. “Ah, they were able to place the story in this morning. I’m rather pleased they didn’t wait for the evening issue.”
Draco nodded with peaceful silence as he cuddled Lyra close before turning to watch Harry give the vial to Dinki.
"I did feel a little weird ordering it but you're the one who has to eat it." Harry smirked. "You know, Dray; that reminds me of something."
Harry was already there and Draco grinned thinking of the last time they'd seen each other. The kisses they'd shared had been so sweet. The letters they'd exchanged after the kisses had been almost as sweet.
His thoughts wandered until the sky began to darken. Arthur lit the candles on the cake as Molly started everyone off on a round of ‘happy birthday’. The birthday boy blew out the candles and left the slicing to Molly as he was badgered into giving a speech.
"Luna Lovegood's parents and mine were friends too... make of that what you will but consider your words carefully the next time we meet." Harry's grin remained sharp edged as he stared the other boy down. "It's really too bad you don't have more respect for others. I acknowledge you as a relative but you and yours will not replace anyone in my eyes nor in the public eye. Must I make it any clearer?"
“You don’t have the luxury of illusions here…none of us do.” Draco continued as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “If the wizengamut accepts Hermione’s suggestion, you’ll all be expected to make statements and publicly endorse this plan. Ginevra, you might be able to get a note from the healer who delivered Lucas and Lance that could possibly extend your period of rest for a few more months, but Katie and I will have to take on a third child each.”
Harry took it and looked inside to find nundu spikes. He tied the sack closed and pulled out his trunk. He made quick work of enlarging it and dumping the contents of his rucksack into it before placing the sack in the pocket of the rucksack. Then he held it open for the snake to enter easily. She was silent as she settled in.
"You are now, officially, Lord Harry Potter, Earl of Inverness." Korlag grinned at him. "I'd like to be the first to congratulate you, Lord Potter."
Harry nodded back with a grin. He was so glad things were working out this way. He felt that Draco truly loved and understood him and Harry was making the effort to reciprocate. Together they could make a brilliant life and it was already happening…now if they could find a way to get the ministry to lay off of their fellow citizens!
Harry thought for a moment and relaxed next to the blond. “Can you deliver a message to my cousins?”
The Minister walked in just then and saw the purple cloud. "Talk about working fast, Harry! You and Draco are the first parents of all the couples that married in the last month. Not only that, but you have two babies on the way! Congratulations, my young friends!"
"That is Rowena Ravenclaw's son, Warin, and he appears to have wed Helga Hufflepuff's granddaughter, Gunnora - as indicated by this gold line." Korlag stepped up to touch the parchment. Using his finger, he traced the names as he read them. "Their daughter, a witch named Felice, married a muggle and birthed three children - a female squib named Edith and two wizards.  One for each line. Your mother, Lily, was that squib's great granddaughter and she married James Potter. Let's open his now." He motioned for the other goblin to bring the Potter chart. "Now, it is known that James Potter descended from a pureblood line - the Peverell family, I believe. Among that family's descendants, there are several fairly famous ones but the one who stands out is Godric Gryffindor - yes there he is..." Korlag traced a line on the chart. "And he was rumored to have conducted an affair of the heart with Salazar Slytherin's elder daughter, Sabelina. The affair is now confirmed by this red line. They were unwed when the child was born and she apparently allowed Godric to raise him with his wife who was infertile due to a childhood disease."
“You’re quite a bloody klutz…” Draco trailed off as he took Harry’s hand and stood, looking him up and down. “Well, you clean up pretty nice, Potter… I’m – uhm – Yes… we should go…”
"We can sit in the outside portion of the Three Broomsticks," Harry suggested, "That way, you'll still see the birds and trees."
"Anyway, next thing I knew dementors were attacking me and my cousin. I saved us from them, but then my relatives kicked me out, thinking I'd used magic on my cousin. He took offense on my behalf and asked to join me, so I took him with me to Diagon Alley and the bank." Harry went on. "The goblins told me that my magical guardian had refused to bring me in, so I told them I had no clue who this 'guardian' was but he wasn't doing a very good job. After informing me that Albus Dumbledore was the guardian in question, they performed several tests during which they found my ancestry and verified the four baronies that I was entitled to claim along with my cousin’s squib status."
“Mmmm…” Draco smiled softly. “That was lovely…but I almost miss that week we had in Hogsmeade last year.”
“I’ll wait here. It’s relaxing on the porch. You take Mione into the memory and come get me after.” Harry told Ron as he sat on the cushioned bench outside the door.
"Did you think I wouldn't find out?" He lit a candle on the dresser with a glance. "The way you laughed when your own cousin stood barefoot in the corridor outside the great hall! You're a disgrace to the house of Hufflepuff."
The older man's face fell. "I...I just can't believe that the man who has taught us and our family... the man who runs a school would abuse a child!"
A glance told Harry that his godfather was taking this seriously so he gave the man a reassuring nod as Draco passed the list to Harry. The young lord saw that his partner had gotten all the points he wanted to discuss, so he passed the parchment along.
"Since Fred and George aren't here to look after Ginny on the trip to the train station, I decided to come early." Molly explained with a smile. "I've brought a casserole."
Luna and Ginny were taken to Helena's suite which had two bedrooms with a shared bathroom and sitting room. Remus and Sirius were given Warin's suite. Dudley and the twins were led to guest rooms on the same floor as the others but as Harry was waiting for his turn he checked on Sigmund.
“I’m glad one of them got my eyes – my mother’s eyes,” Harry smiled. “Caelum’s eyes have deepened a little don’t you think? I’m sure he’ll have your mother’s blue eyes and it’s a lovely combination, isn’t it? Pale strawberry blond with blue eyes and my skin color?”
"Alright – get undressed and join me on the bed, Dragon." Harry reassured him while unbuttoning his own shirt.
“Alright Dearest, but if you feel the slightest bit off I want you both to come home.” Narcissa looked directly at Harry.
Then it hit Harry like a lightning bolt. This was the level of calm he’d been searching for! This was the realm of consciousness where he could explore himself and figure out what form his soul would take as an animagus.
“I-I’m just so happy, Harry,” Draco sniffed, looking at Marcus. “You know, when we first got together, Harry didn’t really like the whole idea of me going further in potions.”
Harry chuckled at this bit of attitude, “One of my rules is that you will always address me as Master.”
“If you sit, I’ll let you hold one at a time,” Harry motioned with his head toward the smaller sofa. “Molly, would you tell George and Charlie to come in with their spouses? This room is big enough for all of us as long as a few keep going in and out.”
Harry looked and looked for Draco but only when lunchtime arrived did the blond make an appearance. He and Ron were heading into Muggle London for their midday meal when Harry saw a flash of platinum hair and shouted while waving his arm to draw his attention. “Draco!”
Harry told him and Draco became intrigued so Harry promised to take him someplace with that amenity during the summer.
Soon enough, Draco swallowed every drop of Harry's essence and then allowed himself to be lifted onto the bed where he and Harry proceeded to give each other much more pleasure.
When they'd left everyone's earshot, Draco whispered to the brunette. "You've a suite and an office?"
2nd pregnancy                              September 2000 – June 4 2001       - Twins             - Cadence Lily and Etamina Marie
Draco’s footsteps padded across the floor and he was sniffling as he opened the door. “Hi...Thanks for letting me crash here.”
"I know the theory of it but they are so rare that I have never had the opportunity to attempt it." Severus' eyes widened. "I was told the chamber was inaccessible. I asked for the remains!"
“Draco, why don’t you go to class and tell Flitwick that Pansy and I will be along shortly while we bring Tanis to his daddy,” Harry said.
"Course it's not." Blaise frowned, worried. "I suppose we'd best get some sleep if we're going to be in any mood to spend the afternoon with Potter."
Harry decided to let his devious side show for a moment. “I can spin it so they’ll support our requested date, but only if it’s what you want.”
"Yes, anyway, he's trying to reclaim the objects because they are...what?" Draco frowned as Harry stood and began to pace.
"I think you mean muggle, but yes. We'll want to blend in with both worlds, Dudley." Harry told him nodding.
“Indeed. One announcement should cover everything,” Lucius told them. “I’ll write to the Prophet in the morning and have them say something along the lines of ‘the misters Harry James and Draco Lucien Malfoy-Potter announce the names of their children who will be born this summer’ and so on. Good night, all.”
“Oh, Draco…I love the way you look.” Harry held the blond close to him. “You’re beautiful and I love seeing your body – the way it moves and responds to my touch. Please don’t feel self conscious, love.”
Harry winced inwardly at the concern in her blue eyes – the blue eyes that matched his son’s so closely. He sighed and went back into the house via the nursery doors. He didn’t want to feel this pre-occupied by the deaths of his family members. He just couldn’t help it. Harry stood between the twins’ cribs and placed one of his hands on each. He treasured his children. He treasured his husband – no matter how they’d originally met and clashed for so long. He walked over and lightly touched the pillow on Teddy’s bed. He treasured his godson too and hoped desperately to live up to his own expectations of what a godfather should do for his godson.
His heart beat again and he escaped with his friends never knowing if he'd see those eyes express an emotion other than terror.
“Strangely enough, she just wants her vault, the guest bedroom set and half the assets we acquired during the marriage.” Harry sighed and motioned that they should be on their way. “She doesn’t want the house or to take the kids from me – says she’ll get a flat in London and as long as I let them visit her during the holidays she’ll apparently be content.”
“Dinki is being patient, Master Harry.” She nodded. “You is being finished with Dinki, Master Harry? Dinki is being needed in the kitchen.”
"James preferred this one while the three of us visited during holidays from school." Remus nodded with a sigh, his eyes went to a point above and to Harry's right. "The head Potter elf was named..."
“Yes, Draco told me that the Boy-Wonder loves him…” Blaise smiled at Harry. “And considering the way Draco defended him – he Loves Harry just as much.”
“We were under a secrecy spell, remember? Don’t despair, though. I have it in good authority that it’ll come up in conversation tomorrow afternoon. We’re going to join his search for Slytherin’s hidden quarters.” Draco grinned. “Aren’t you going to mention the fact that I called him my mate?”
Harry kissed her cheek and did as she’d suggested. While breastfeeding Hugo under a towel, Hermione told him all sorts of statistics that agreed with Molly on most counts so Harry felt infinitely better during the rest of his visit.
“So, you think that the damaged support wall represents Granger?” Draco asked to confirm. “What about the outer walls that were completely destroyed?”
"Harry, you're not really going to tell them all my rules...are you?" Draco asked with a blush as he rejoined the group.
Harry frowned. “No…we aren’t in mourning, my love. We are lucky and we need to live our lives while remembering how close we came to knowing a little girl named Adrielle Vega Weasley.”
The Golden Trio grinned at each other and took some of the secret passages to get to the Great Hall this morning. Harry was sitting at the Gryffindor table reading an owl from Kingsley when Draco finally showed up.
“I-I didn’t know that. I thought it was a panic attack or something of that nature. When I get worked up, cool water always calms me and he’d been crying so I just… I didn’t want him getting dehydrated in this heat.” Harry stumbled through his explanation.
“Well, that’s easy to fix!” Lucius frowned as he turned to look at the portrait frame beside the chaise lounge. “Severus? Do join us, won’t you?”
Harry was speechless. “I hope you don’t mind, but after dinner, I’m going to share my dancing skills with your mother.”
“Perhaps if you simply allowed either Arthur or myself to accompany you when the two of you venture out,” Lucius offered.
Harry was a little bewildered but took this twist in stride. The boatyard was made up of a large lot of land and a small shop. A one level castle tower was situated at either end of the lot but it was unclear what their function was.
“You hated socks, darling, so I’d put you to bed wearing them but when I’d check on you during the night they’d be gone.” She smiled fondly at her son. “Hats were even worse. I’d put a hat on you for a cold day and they would miraculously change into something else. Once it was a toad and it hopped off into the garden pond. Another time it became a bird and flew away!”
Sensing her masters’ distress, Dinki quickly snapped her fingers and instantly held a tray with two glasses and a pitcher of cool water. She set it down on the nearest flat surface and filled both glasses halfway.
"Oh! Oh, Harry Potter, sir!" Dobby bawled falling on his little knees at Harry's feet. "Harry Potter is being such a kind wizard! Dobby is being so happy! Dobby was not knowing how to tell Harry Potter that being free isn't all Dobby thought it would be!"
Harry turned Draco around, pulled up his trousers and cupped his pale, wet face. “I’m sorry this punishment was necessary…but I’m not sorry for executing it. I love you and our children love you. We need you to keep your strength up and we need to be able to trust you. Understand?”
“Luc, be nice…I know you remember how we were and I’m sure it’s the same with them. Call for dinner, please, darling; I’m ravenous.” Narcissa smiled softly.
“That may be true, Father, but I marry quite soon and you get no younger. I inherit eventually and will have control in the future.” Draco smirked. “He’s going to take care of me...and in turn, the Malfoy estate.”
"Sort of..." Draco bit his lip. "I know lots of kids our age are doing more than kissing and I do want to do that with you but... well... I've always imagined... you see..."
Harry continued to stare the blond down. “And how difficult is it to eat three meals in one day? Think of the children. How are we supposed to teach them the right things to do if we don’t do them too?”
"I wanted you all to get expelled but Dumbledore refused." Severus hissed. "He said 'boys will be boys' and 'just a prank'. You deserved to be expelled and then forced to register your animagus forms!"
“It...it’s probably just a dream, Roody. It has to be...” Suddenly reminded of another house elf, Harry snorted in disbelief that he hadn’t thought of the former Malfoy elf in a while. “Is Dobby still at Hogwarts, Roody?”
“Yesterday, Caelum vanished the outfit I’d put him into and crawled around the nursery in just his nappy as if to escape.” Narcissa said to Harry. “Lyra simply laughed and waved her arms around at the time but she has her own fun. That little one is a real firecracker, boys. She changed the color of my clothing last evening. I’d been wearing a lovely silver blouse with a long black wool skirt – do you know? She changed the blouse to gold and the skirt to navy blue.”
When Draco had finished his gardening work he took Dinki and the twins inside while Harry remained to have a longer conversation with the adder. He found out that she didn’t have a name as she’d been born in the wild with nobody to call a nestmate. After asking if she’d like one, Harry decided that her name would be Amice, meaning ‘friend’. During their visit, Amice happily volunteered to provide scales, venom, old skins and even blood if Draco needed them for his potions work. When she retreated to her nest, Harry rejoined his family to inform his husband of the benefits to their new friend.
“Her name is Silvana and Daddy is holding her right now, Lyra. You need to be calm and gentle with her so we have to have rules.” Harry told the twins and saw Teddy mouthing the name. “The first rule is: no jumping on Daddy or Papa while they’re holding her.”
“How should I do that?” Harry smirked as he moved his hips to move in and out of Draco’s slick channel. They moved together and got closer – so much closer – to their peaks.
What did he want for the rest of his life? He didn’t know… He knew only what he didn’t want. He didn’t want to make the decisions anymore. Hopefully this would be the last one he’d ever have to make. Of course, that meant that what he really did want was to be taken care of. As he thought about that, he felt deep longing begin to build and Draco nodded to himself. He acknowledged silently that he longed to be held and kept safe… protected, pampered and even pleasured… Perhaps, one day he’d even be loved… He took a deep breath and summoned a quill and ink-pot. About to place an X in the box he’d chosen, Draco was interrupted by Headmistress McGonagall’s face suddenly appearing in the fireplace.
She sat up and reached out to her husband. "I can see what's implied, Arthur. I see it and it just isn't possible!"
"True." Harry chuckled. "Well, I'd like to see my room, so I'll leave you for the moment. I'll ask Ziva to set a time for dinner and see you then." He picked up the rucksack Dudley had been carrying and stepped into the foyer. He only glanced into the other sitting room before calling Ziva. "Please lead me to my room and let us know what time dinner will be ready."
“Sure. It sounds like fun.” Harry nodded and gave Draco his floo address. “Are you joining us for lunch?”
Draco's heart started to fall but then she nodded and made her way over to the window. He thanked her as she placed the yellow diamond and pearl pendant in a box and gave her the money for it. As he stepped outside, he was met with a welcome sight.
“Harry!” Hermione was holding a strawberry rum smash and a gin and tonic. She kissed Harry’s cheek and handed over the gin and tonic. “Here you go, Harry. No ice. Just the way you like it.”
"Maybe I'm just tired but you're not making sense, Malfoy. You have been such a git for the last several years and now you need to speak to me urgently, but you're not afraid of your father or Voldemort. " Harry looked incredulous. "What's the bloody emergency that couldn't wait for morning or the train?"
Harry said nothing but, as the timer reached the last ten seconds, he took Draco’s cock into one hand and lightly ran a fingertip from the opposite hand in a circle around the head before sweeping it across the slit.
Harry bent down and whispered into his fiancé’s ear. “I could take the massage to the next level… I could touch you and explore you…learn your body but refrain from the consummation.”
“You vampire!” Draco accused, touching the spot as Harry cast the cleaning spells. “You know I like it too…” He whispered cuddling into Harry once he was clean and dressed again. “Let’s go see our children.”
One day in April, Draco was reading a new book on the subject of complex potions and he just couldn’t grasp the concept. He ignored the plate of food that Dinki brought him for lunch in favor of further study. Several hours later, when Harry called him for dinner, Draco stood only to fall back into the chair from dizziness. He called his husband and heard Harry as he hurried through the house. That’s when he noticed the still full plate from lunch and raised his wand.
“Yes,” Draco nodded. “We should encourage them with smiles and cuddles as well as replies to their babbling.”
“That’s great...” Harry frowned and repeated his correction but she didn’t seem to take notice. “Draco, would you like some tea?”
“I’ve wanted you for hours, Dragon. I’ve been holding back my desire since this morning’s shower,” Harry said softly as he whispered the release spell for Draco’s hair tie which fell gently to the floor. “I didn’t want to ruin the celebration by being late so I held back. But now, I can have you for the rest of the night. And, I’ve been informed that breakfast is actually more of a brunch which means we can sleep in a bit longer than usual.”
3rd Pregnancy (6 months later)           (early)   July 2000 – March 2001                                        - Amethyst Violet
“That’s what he said when he found out that I’d learned it in school from a half-blood I dated but I love the sounds it makes...so soothing.” Draco sounded wistful. “I should get my guitar from its hiding place.”
Sirius chimed in a second later. "He'll ask Snape to escort you to headquarters and I'll be there to meet you."
"Thanks." Harry smiled and went to the drink table. He ordered two full champagne flutes and a pitcher of pumpkin juice for his table. He carried the champagne and the pitcher appeared on the table when he got to it. After handing Draco his champagne, he waved Dean and Ron off to the side. "It's all set, guys. We three couples will be discreetly tested with the spells that detect consummation. All we have to do is dance in front of the Headmistress' table in just under ten minutes."
On the other hand, an example of someone who wasn't making things easy on him was Madam Amelia Bones. She hadn't gotten back to Percy, so Harry decided to try writing to her in person.
Harry took his cousin's hand and showed him where to find the pulse on his own neck. "This is what it feels like when the person is alive. If you don't find a pulse, put your hand in front of his mouth to feel if he's breathing. Then check for identification or a wand."
In an instant, Draco’s hesitancy turned to elation. “That sounds lovely, Father. We’ll look forward to it.” He grinned and winked at Harry as the other boy looked on nodding his approval.
Fred and George said they had news for Harry but wanted to meet after the feast so, as soon as they arrived at the castle, the group parted ways to meet with friends and find seats. Ron remained with Harry but the awkwardness was palpable.
“You don’t have to ask.” The blonde whispered and leaned a little closer, already remembering the last kiss they’d shared.
The one defining factor in all of these was Draco's hair. He had to mess it up in every instance. How could he possibly pull it off?
"Fine." Harry rolled his eyes. "I had a feeling this might happen." He pulled out a familiar bit of parchment and laid it on the bed. He showed Fred and George that it was blank and bowed to his godfather.
"They also found spells and potions in my system that had kept my full potential bound for years." Harry swung his gaze to the man he'd known as a potion master. "Their healer performed a ritual and gave me a potion to fix the damage."
"It was probably done by whoever had access to you before you were placed with the squibs. The potions also affected your emotions. The parts of your mind that control free will have been dulled. The potions have made you calmer and more agreeable than you might otherwise be. Drink this." Olgok handed the potion to Harry and watched him begin to drink before turning to the humans. "Come! We must hurry! The longer Mr. Potter has these blocks on him, the more likely he is to become unstable and lose control of his magic and emotions."
“For an open secret they sure did keep it under wraps.” Harry smiled. He did indeed remember the wedding Kingsley mentioned. It had been the third ceremony of that day and he’d suspected for a long while that the Hufflepuff and his fellow Gryffindor had something going on besides friendship but neither of them had ever let on that it was true. “They always swore they were just friends. I was shocked to find out they were allowed to marry because they were both purebloods.”
“My best friend is Muggle-born. I understand your anger, sir, but terrorizing me and my pregnant husband is not the way to get justice for your wife,” Harry told him. “Have you found her? Is she alive?”
New Years Eve approached quickly and, when the Malfoy-Potter family awoke that day, it was to see a thick blanket of snow on the ground.
"Harry, you and Draco may take Teddy for a little while." Andromeda said softly. "Cissy and I have some catching up to do."
"Except that Dumbledore had access to both me and a potions master who would know how to make these test potions." Harry looked at the goblin. "Professor Severus Snape is knowledgeable enough about potions that he could've made them. Couldn't he? Remus?"
Harry graciously agreed to leave but offered welcoming words to Helena. "If you'd like to visit my suite, I'd be happy to see you there."
Draco's eyes widened as he scrambled through his underwear drawer, finding only a small drawstring pouch.
Ron stepped up and tried to push the button down but that didn't work. "Well, what if the poker turns or something?"
"Yes. He asked Ron and me when we were planning to enroll and offered to speed up  the process." Harry gritted his teeth. "I was pressed to answer in front of everyone."
“That’s...” Harry stared at the man for a moment and then reached out a hand. "Thank you for telling me, Mac."
“Not yet, Dragon…” He pulled out a licorice wand and a package of Jelly Slugs. “There’s more of this in our room; a whole assortment from Honeyduke’s.”
“I used the memory of that embrace to comfort myself during the weeks of funerals…” Harry smiled sadly. “Then came dreams of the blond dignitary…and one day I decided I wanted to know what made a certain other blond I knew of tick.”
“Yes but it doesn’t say what the powers are that awaken, only that they were sleeping.” Harry pointed out. “It could be talking about yours... or maybe it's talking about mine...”
When Draco arrived in the front hall of Malfoy Manor, it was bustling as it had the day he left for school. His mother was directing the elves in cleaning the house and preparing for guests. His father, having gone through the floo first, was now attempting to borrow one elf to clean his study and another for the library.
"Go. I'll only be another moment." Draco told him, taking down the privacy spell. As soon as Blaise was gone, Draco closed his letter and called Potter's elf. "Dobby?"
"I'll talk to him." Harry promised her before gesturing to Ziva. "This is the head Potter elf, Ziva. She'll show you around and introduce you to the others. The five of them take care of this townhouse and a place in Wiltshire called Potter Grove."
"Right. Eleven sickles, wasn't it?" Harry asked digging into his pocket. He looked down at his eight sickles, ten knuts, and one galleon. "Dud, how much is in your pouch?"
Harry cleaned the blond’s hand with another charm before allowing Draco to straddle his hips. Harry took hold of his cock and kept it steady as Draco sank onto it.
Harry rolled his eyes behind closed lids but then looked into his fiancé's molten silver ones. "Draco, would you please come with me to Hogsmeade this weekend?"
Arthur and Molly stood just behind Lucius and Narcissa while Ron and Hermione waved from down the hall. His best friends each had hold of one of his children while Teddy was up on Ron’s shoulders. Teddy waved enthusiastically and called out his name but Harry quickly placed one finger on his own lips to hush the boy.
“Ok, Dray, but I want someone with you at all times. I don’t want anything to happen to you.” Harry told him while he dished out some eggs and fruit for each of them. He was quite amused lately because Draco had developed a craving for each meal. Eggs had lost their effect of disgusting Draco as long as they were mixed with salsa and he’d begun to crave them for the protein they provide.
"So the first dream didn't give you any sense of urgency?" Sirius murmured in a thoughtful tone while fingering his thin mustache. A slow shake of Harry's head was the only answer so he continued his thoughts. "The second one sent you into a panic for information and reassurance from Roody. What exactly was it that worried you?"
Madam Malkin pushed him into his dressing room and while he cast locking and hardening spells on the curtain, she hurried into her back room through a hidden door in the mirrored wall.
"At fourteen, I outflew a dragon, saved my best friend from the depths of the Black Lake, and survived a deadly obstacle course only to be kidnapped by someone I thought was trying to kill me." Harry shouted at the older man. "When I got back to the school with new knowledge, I was sent back to my ordinary life of neglect and abuse at my relatives’ hands! That was also soon disrupted. This time by dementors, forcing me to go on the run with my cousin who’d finally realized that they didn’t treat me like they should!"
“They just thought it was hilarious.” Harry explained as he summoned the teabags and dropped one in each mug. “They’d known he was gay and they knew I was drunk and they’d all heard Ginny’s little barb.”
“Father, you continue to widen the rift between Harry and I.” Draco snapped. “Kindly remember that I’m in charge now.”
“So his students didn’t see him at all?” Harry frowned. “His fellow teachers? What about any family?”
Soon, lunch was over and Pansy excused herself to write letters to Blaise and Theo as well as some of her cousins in foreign countries.
"Ron, I forgot something in our apartment. Won't you come with me to get it?" Hermione asked, her eyes were sparkling.
“He shouldn’t know this until I get there, but I’ll be joining him in his suite at the Manor until the new Malfoy heir is conceived,” Harry nodded. “I’ll expect Draco to move in here with me once that happens. You will allow him access to his child or children – if the first is a girl – and when he’s in public he’s not to submit to anyone. Are we clear?”
“Well, that’s settled, then.” McGonagall stated as Harry handed over his letter. She read them quickly and instructed each boy how to fill his out properly. “You should tell Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley as soon as possible to avoid any…” She broke off as the gargoyle in front of her office could be heard moving aside.
