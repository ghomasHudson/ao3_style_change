“Excellent,” said Dumbledore. “Tell him what has happened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry – “
“I hope neither of you is thinking of entering,” Sarah said in warning, sending pointed glances at the twins.
Fred stood beside her, one arm around her waist as they watched their children excitedly chatter with Harry, Draco, Hermione and Ron’s kids.
Lyra snorted violently at the memory. “That was only because you decided not to cut your hair the entire year. I just so happened to prefer a shorter style at the same time.”
“Come on. We’re leaving,” He grabbed her arm and roughly began dragging Sarah towards the gates. She tried to pull out of his grasp but he wouldn’t let her go, instead tightening his grip until pain shot up her arm.
“We never ask if someone is okay,” she elaborated. “You, me and Draco always ask what we’re thinking.”
Harry’s Banishment Charm was wobbly and his pillow gave a half-hearted flop but didn’t fly into the box they were aiming for.
“Hermione wants me to work on the egg,” he said miserably, waving at their group. “I can’t get out of it this time.”
One of the giant’s massive hands swopped down upon them – Sarah let out a real scream, ran a few steps backwards and fell over. Wandless, Harry, like an actual idiot, braced himself instead of moving out of the way as the hand flew toward him and knocked a snow-white centaur off his legs.
“Draco’s always been by my side,” he whispered to Sarah, voice thick with emotion. “I never realised how much I relied on him until he was gone.”
“I haven’t seen him since he told us about Vince and Severus,” Lyra replied. Pansy and Blaise nodded in agreement. Greg didn’t move, seemingly not even aware of the conversation.
The tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiralling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din.
Sarah swallowed her mouthful of shortbread and stared at the professor. Her tone of voice was not at all what she was used to; it was not brisk, crisp and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual.
Her feet hit the ground so hard that her knees buckled, the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said, “Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true their father’s dying…?”
They walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of brutal-looking Healers. Eventually, they stopped on a floor and looked around, trying to find any signage to point indicate where they were.
Snape stalked out of the room and Sarah saw Harry sag into his bonds, looking defeated. The door closed with a snap, echoing around the once again silent room.
“Sorry Professor!” Pansy shouted back, not sounding sorry at all. “You can’t be serious,” she said, lowering her voice, causing all of them to lean close to her to hear her words. “Potter would never offer to protect
Sarah’s other classes were just as interesting, despite Ron constantly claiming otherwise. Ancient Runes and Ancient Studies soon became her favourite way to pass the time when she wasn’t reading. She had gotten into the habit of practising runes by writing notes to Draco or Hermione, who had rolled their eyes at her but had eagerly learnt to reply.
Harry looked from her to Draco, Ron and Hermione, who murmured, “I think Sarah’s right. We need them.” And when Harry unconvinced, “You don’t have to do everything alone, Harry.”
Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the three fights, Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and the two Malfoys, Narcissa still standing in front of Sarah’s prone body.
There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoy’s humiliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently flushed with happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red.
“So you are still your lovely self,” George commented as they began walking upstairs. “Good, I was beginning to worry you’d lost your spark.”
“We’ve been walking around the grounds and castle all day,” he explained. “I didn’t think anyone was going to come – there was no way it was the Dursleys.”
“He’ll be able to soon,” promised Sarah. She spun Lyra around until the girl was facing Harry and Hugo, her back pressed against Sarah. “Look – he’s even trying to listen to what we’re saying. Aren’t you, Hugo?”
“They may have already checked your manor and then decided to come here,” Hermione said. “They would know that we felt comfortable here.”
Lyra wasn’t quite sure how to respond to that. “Er – thanks, Luna,” she eventually decided to say. “Do you want to sit with us?”
Sarah was glad that most people were leaving. She was tired of everyone skirting around Harry in the corridors and muttering, pointing and hissing at him. Sometimes she even got a dark look sent her way.
“Life is full of pain, Professor,” she said evenly. “It’s learning how to deal with it that makes us strong.”
Sarah followed Fred as he led her further north. After ten more minutes of flying through the cold air, Sarah felt herself pass through an invisible barrier. Out of nowhere, a house appeared before them about half a kilometre away. Sarah and Fred landed in the front yard and the door flew open, revealing Fleur, her silvery hair pulled into a messy bun.
Professor Lupin laughed before whispering something in Neville’s ear. Neville looked dumbstruck by whatever was said but he shook his head and drew his wand slowly, shaking all over.
“Yes, but it will tell us how much more we’ll need to know!” cried Pansy. Sarah had forgotten how much she got like Hermione and Draco sometimes about schoolwork. Those two in question where on the other side of the common room, currently bent over a gigantic pile of notes with the Ravenclaws who had returned, Padma Patil and Terry Boot. “Sarah, please study at least
Sarah and Draco lurked near the entrance to the dungeons, waiting for Harry, Ron and Hermione to arrive.
“This room is usually reserved for the Minister an’ the like,” Tom announced, looking around the intricately decorated room with pride. “It’s yers as long as yer need it.”
The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.
Sarah shook her head and Draco’s expression fell. “I was so sure we’d be prefects together,” he said.
“I was surprised,” Harry replied, idly grabbing Draco’s hands in his own. “You were so professional and so…unlike the Malfoy I had known. But I really think it was the way you handled Fluffy that made me interested in you.”
Sarah walked through the ‘S’ section of the library, looking for anything she could find on snakes. An hour later, she collapsed into a seat at the table in the far corner, a massive stack of books in her arms. She searched through information as dull as the nutritional value of mice for a snake’s digestive system to information that made her pause and read entire paragraphs of in interest.
Harry, Fred and George were back from their meeting with McGonagall. They were sitting in front of the fire opposite Angelina, who looked as though someone had killed her crup. The reason for that soon became obvious.
“It’s for their safety,” Draco told him. “If they were free to interact with the other animals, they may get sicker. The cages keep them healthy and comfortable. We do have an open kennel section of the clinic as well, however. That’s where we take the injured animals that don’t have a home and we try to get them adopted.”
“At least let him get through the main course before you assault his eyes with your collectibles,” Draco pleaded.
“Then he magicked you onto a stretched,” said Ron. “And walked up to the school with you floating on it. Lupin soon joined him with Sarah on her own stretcher. Everyone thought you were…”
To add to that, Marcus Flint had started demanding daily Quidditch practices to prepare for the upcoming Gryffindor-Slytherin match. Sarah had told Professor Lupin she couldn’t continue with Patronus lessons or she would collapse from sheer exhaustion.
“Father was bragging to some businessmen last week about something happening at Hogwarts this year,” Draco said, reclining back to lie flat on the grass, his head pillowed by his folded arms. “When I asked him about it, he said that the Triwizard Tournament was going to be held at Hogwarts this year.”
“The more the merrier! It was just going to be Moony, Draco, Sarah and I,” said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that Mrs Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help with breakfast.
“As long as you guys didn’t get up to anything I would,” Sirius continued. “I would hate to need to have that conversation with you. It means I’d have to have it with the boys as well.”
“I’m fine,” he said truthfully. “Draco and I spent the day in Godric’s Hollow. We bumped in Remus and Sirius, actually. They’re well and Teddy is as cute as ever.”
“And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the locket – “ Harry said.
“All right, Rosalyn, let the poor men inside before you start molesting them,” a bright voice called from the other room.
“I know that, Fred,” said Sarah calmly. “But how are we going to explain that we knew he was injured when they haven’t even been able to tell your mother yet? It’s going to throw horrible suspicion on Harry. The Ministry in particular would be extremely interested. We can’t.”
“Honestly, completely hopeless,” she complained. “You would think  that here they would at least have
Fred laughed loudly and drew her down so that they were sitting cross-legged on the pillows. He reached into the picnic basket and began to withdraw a selection of Sarah’s favourite foods.
“Are you okay?” Draco asked him, his eyebrows furrowing slightly. “Lyra said she was going to look for you. I hope she didn’t do something to piss you off?”
“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,” said Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the obvious lie, “killed while trying to save himself –“
“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,” Mr Weasley said in a constricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day the Weasley’s when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.”
“Or he could be innocent,” said Ginny. “The poison could have been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself.”
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant evening,” said the default Ministry woman’s voice. It echoed in the small space and they all glanced around nervously.
She had just gotten settled when Hedwig let out a loud screech from inside the car, immediately followed by a booming voice.
Draco knelt down beside Harry and wrapped an arm around the other boy. Sarah frowned as he rummaged around on the floor and then held up a golden locket. Harry took it and opened it. Over his shoulder, Sarah saw a note written in spidery handwriting.
“Name, age and date of birth of patient?” she asked. Potter answered her questions without hesitation and Draco tried not to pay too much attention, instead inspecting the bagel Rosie had brought him: feta and avocado, his favourite. He startled slightly when Rosie called his name.
At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had moved upstairs. Quietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs.
Theo rose on unsteady feet and headed toward the window. A protective barrier kept the water a few inches away from the window itself. Theo opened it widely, took a deep breath, and thrust his head into the cold water of the lake.
“But what about the conversation you mentioned?” Granger continued, directing her question toward Lyra.
Harry gratefully sunk into his embrace and said, “I – I’m okay…Head hurts a bit…I don’t like Occlumency much…”
The crowd parted and Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry’s arm and pulled him to the front. Initially, Harry tried to drag Sarah with him but she shook him off, holding onto Draco so she wouldn’t be a victim of Lockhart’s ego.
“Rosmerta, m’dear, I don’t like them any more than you do,” said Fudge uncomfortably. “Necessary precaution…unfortunate, but there you are…I’ve just met some of them. They’re in a fury against Dumbledore – he won’t let them inside the castle grounds.”
Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, travelling by Apparation to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety.
The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd, or the sounds of the clashing giants, or of the stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a single stroke, Neville sliced off the great snake Nagini’s head, which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the Entrance Hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at his feet –
Fred said he’d wait down in the common room for Sarah, as the stairs to the girl’s dormitories turned into slides whenever a boy tried to walk up them.
“Draco was always amazing at making me feel better,” Sarah commented as she sat on the end of Harry’s bed.
“We better head to bed, we have an early start tomorrow,” he sat, sitting up and forcing Sarah to as well.
“I really don’t want you going back there alone,” Draco finally said, shifting so that he could look up at her properly from his position with his head resting in her lap.
“You’ll always be my number one,” Draco said in a serious voice. “You know that right? Even though we’re all getting on with our lives, nothing will change that. I don’t care if I have to fight your husband, we’re still having time for us.”
“Dad fixed him right up,” George said. “Just have to tweak it a bit so it doesn’t suffocate the person who eats it…”
Snape’s lips thinned significantly and his nostrils flared. Sarah was barely able to draw in a breath.
“You think you’re great, don’t you, Deaumont?” Crabbe sneered, striding forward and pushing Sarah out of the way to stand in front of Buckbeak. “It’s easy. I bet it’s not even dangerous at all, you great ugly brute.”
That reminder brought forth the negative thoughts that had been swirling around Harry’s mind recently. He hummed softly and embraced Draco, not willing to let him go any time soon.
Pansy scowled. “Of course you did,” she muttered, and then, in a firmer voice, “Also, we don’t use that name here anymore. From now on, she is to be referred to as that hag, wretched slut, cold-hearted bitch, or communal leg-spreader. Nothing else.”
“I think it’s ridiculous,” Sarah exclaimed. “Ron’s being an idiot and drawing his best friend into it. I understand he’s upset about losing his rat, but
“We saw him talking to Fudge and then they went up to Fudge’s office together,” Harry said. “Mr Weasley wants to tell Dumbledore.”
,” Sarah hissed, continuing to demolish her lunch. “It’s completely ridiculous and he has no right to treat us like that!”
The words had a powerful impact on Umbridge. She glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her Inquisitorial Squad, her bulging eyes resting for a moment on Crabbe, who was too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face.
“I was so angry when I turned around to find him holding you by the neck,” Fred whispered. No one else was listening, they were all talking quietly amongst themselves. “I didn’t even think. I just pulled him off you and started punching.”
Sarah watched as Snape moved closer to Crabbe, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Crabbe smirked, too.
“Ah, yes,” said Lupin when they reminded him of his promise at the end of class. “Let me see…how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough…I’ll have to think carefully about how we’re going to do this…We can’t bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on…”
Suddenly, his hand disappeared from around her neck and she dropped to her knees on the grass, holding her throat as she heaved great lungful’s of breath.
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.”
“Of course, you’re not going back either, Malfoy,” leered Crabbe. “You could never part from your loyal bitch.”
His eyes snapped to hers. “The voice!” he said, looking over his shoulder. “I just heard it again – didn’t you?”
The gargoyle guarding the entrance to the Headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Sarah wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.
Draco and Hermione descended into a detailed discussion of the questions and answers while Sarah, Harry and Ron reclined against the wall, resting before lunch. The fifth years ate lunch with the rest of the school and then trooped into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until called for their practical examination. Sarah was surprisingly calm as she waited. She knew she was one of the first people that would be called and instead of practising wand movements and incantations, she imagined herself flying or relaxing in front of the fire in the common rooms, effectively calming her heartbeat down.
On their third lesson, Sarah had managed to Apparate into her hoop but had also left a finger behind. Apparently, swearing at the top of your lungs while staring at your dismembered finger is not appropriate student conduct. Sarah was still pissed that Snape had taken twenty points from Slytherin. She wasn’t the only one who had been injured. There had been a few other people in the last lessons to get Splinched but so far no one had successfully Apparated.
“You don’t see me eating Draco’s face off right now, do you?” he exclaimed. Draco looked entirely too interested by the idea and Harry smacked the back of his head lightly. “Mind here, please.”
The seats that had encircled the dragons’ enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank, rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below.
The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered; though the wands remained connected, a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they were enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, cage of lights, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals.
The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Travers was hanging back, watching and several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.
“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry. “And quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits to smile at the four of them, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.”
“Dumbledore is not the master of this house,” Sirius said in a tight voice. “He doesn’t get to decide who lives here or not.”
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must be Wartcap power in there.”
“Do you want to wait until later to do this surgery?” Charles asked, oblivious to Draco’s long-suffering sigh. Draco knew that the man meant well. It just didn’t help that Draco had spent most of the night before drinking with Pansy. Even after all these years, she could still drink him under the table.
“Doesn’t that take you back, Moony?” Sirius said brightly. “Reminds me of Evelyn and James. Those two used to fight like cats and dogs over the most pointless things.”
His chest rumbled with his quiet laughter and Sarah let herself rest there for a while, just enjoying the feeling of simple comfort.
“I hope he didn’t try too hard,” Sarah commented absently. “I would have given him the counterspell had I known.”
There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, “You are speaking like a child. I quite understand that your father’s capture and imprisonment has upset you, but – “
“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. “So we’ve finally got a Defense teacher who knows his remedies?”
“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?”
Mrs Weasley waved her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile pf potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.
Each morning he would hand Draco his robes while the other boy was busy checking his bag. He would add a few more slices of toast to Draco’s plate, despite his assurances that he was not hungry, knowing that in a few hours, the blond would be complaining about lack of food. He would always flush whenever Draco flopped down next to him on the couch, despite there being armchairs nearby. Harry hated to admit it, but whenever Draco was around, Harry found himself falling into a confused, bumbling idiot.
. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch’s cat’s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know – Creevey’s been attacked.”
“I remember you mentioning it a few years ago,” Sarah said. “Harry’s right, it’s a brilliant idea. Just don’t expect Draco and me to go easy on you when we verse you.”
“Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. “You’ll be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.”
“Such a loving letter, don’t you think?” she said casually around the treat. “I sure do appreciate all those hidden threats and barely-veiled judgements.”
“How’s Harry?” Sarah asked, hugging Hermione quickly before settling herself on the edge of Harry’s bed.
“He won’t,” Draco assured. “He doesn’t like Crabbe very much but because our fathers are all associates, it will not be unusual for him to speak with Crabbe.”
Sarah was silent for a long moment as her thoughts whirled around in her head. Snape said nothing, just merely observed her silently from behind his desk.
“I’m glad it’s beginning to work out,” she whispered. She turned a harsh glare on Fred. “But if I find one of those sweets in my food, I’m breaking up with you.
“If we get that far…” winced Sarah. “Michaels, you’re supposed to be aiming for their hands not their faces!”
Draco lifted his head; his grey eyes were clouded and shining. “I can’t ever apologise enough for what my aunt did,” he said hoarsely. “But Neville
“He’s right,” Hermione affirmed. “Many muggles find that colour to be particularly stylish and striking.”
“That’s wonderful, darling,” Sarah said, sitting back upright. She leant around him and addressed his date, “Luna, it’s so lovely to get to speak to you again. How have you been?”
“Mr Potter,” Draco called and Potter’s head whipped up, his green eyes meeting Draco’s. He got to his feet, holding his cat carefully to his chest and jerking his head at Teddy to follow him.
A tap on her arm brought her attention back to the conversation at her own table. Fred was looked at her questioningly and she realised he must have asked her something.
They all collapsed into laughter as Draco continued to rant about his nickname. Sarah felt a warmth blossom in her chest as she watched her boys tease each other and cheer her up without effort.
“If you keep announcing your shagging schedule to everyone, I’ll throw you in the lake,” drawled Blaise.
Lyra smiled softly and took a small sip of her drink. It was actually quite strong, as Charlie had already revealed earlier in a whisper as they gleefully watched Percy down a cup.
“The Imperius Curse can be fought, and I’ll be teaching you how, but it takes real strength of character, and no everyone’s got it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!” he barked and everyone jumped.
“If I’m being completely honest,” Draco said with a small smile, “I think I’ve already had enough for tonight.” He looked Michael up and down and didn’t miss the small gleam that ignited in his blue eyes.
“Does that mean that Miss Sarah will not call on Dobby when he is needed?” Dobby said, his lower lip beginning to tremble slightly.
Warrington scowled deeply but left, muttering a quick, “You’d better watch out for yourselves” as he left.
Sarah leaned on Neville, still feeling extremely queasy from the trip, and hobbled over to the telephone box. Miraculously, everyone managed to squeeze inside, although Ron did have to awkwardly reach past her to dial six-two-four-four-two on the receiver. Within seconds, they were descending into the ground, blackness closed over their heads, and with a dull grinding noise, they sank down into the depts of the Ministry of Magic.
“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago,” said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. “Let me know when they’re back.”
“That’s brilliant!” Potter exclaimed. Draco could practically hear the smile in his voice. “When do you think he’ll be able to come home?”
“Don’t lie to yourself, darling,” he said, smiling slightly. “And don’t frown, you’ll get wrinkles.”
Draco flipped them over at one point and bore his weight down on Harry, causing the other boy to groan loudly.
“I’ll stop when the hag apologises!” cried Pansy, drawing the attention of some students. She ignored them and flipped her short dark bob over her shoulder. “Until then, she deserves all my wrath.”
“It’s payback for a dare he made me do a while back,” Sarah muttered distractedly, standing on her tiptoes to see over the top of the student’s heads. “There they are!”
Sirius joined them in drawing room after lunch as they tried to clean out the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantlepiece. They were crammed with an odd assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages Sarah could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Sarah was quite sure was blood.
“ – and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said Sirius. He and Kreacher had been getting progressively more and more hateful to each other over the course of the last few weeks, especially since the Weasley’s had stayed.
“Well, considering everything that’s happened in the last few months, I think I’m allowed to be slightly peeved off,” Harry said wryly.
He sat back enough to pull her sweater off, distractedly shucking his own shirt off in the process. Sarah barely had time to blink before Fred’s hands were everywhere, somehow managing to get their clothes off without separating his lips from hers.
“For the last time, I didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had an enemy no one knows about – don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it won’t work – I can stop you!”
Potter, unexpectedly, blushed a deep red. He scratched the back of his neck as he avoided the accusatory looks his friends were giving him.
The next few days passed in the same fashion. Harry’s real birthday celebration consisted off too much cake, Honeydukes sweets and games in the front sitting room. Remus had disappeared briefly and returned with a selection of muggle and wizarding board games.
Kings Cross Station was even more crowded than usual. Large families pushed together, tearfully saying goodbye to their Hogwarts age children. Yet nearly everyone looked slightly wary – the scars of the previous year were going to be difficult to erase.
Sarah shrugged. “We have to learn somehow,” she said. She smirked suddenly. “Besides, I sometimes have a problem following rules, especially if they’re stupid.”
Sirius huffed and puffed as he lugged Sarah into the parlour, dropping her unceremoniously from his back. Draco’s quick reflexes stopped her from hitting the ground.
As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry leapt over an armchair and body-slammed Greyback, setting the pair sprawling to the ground. Draco raced to help them. Sarah felt something smooth press against her hands and realised that Narcissa was handing her their wands.
“Uh shit,” sighed Sarah, turning to face Draco as he stomped his way toward her. His silver eyes were flaming and he looked positively murderous. He stopped in front of her and Sarah waited.
Harry nodded. “Yep,” he confirmed. “Dumbledore got what he wanted and then dropped me off back here.”
“Of course,” Sarah snapped. “Believe it or not, Sev, I’m not an imbecile. I understand my actions earlier were stupid and emotion-driven – it won’t happen again.”
“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head titled a little to one side as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.”
“Good, because there’s only so much optimism that Draco and my bodies can take so we need your Gryffindorness at full capacity.”
And so, thus began the start of their lives together – but both knew it was merely a continuation of the way they already lived because for them, the greatest thing was that they had both learnt how to love and were loved in return.
“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. Sarah and Draco glanced at each other in shock. “Can’t you give it a rest?” Harry continued. “You’re always having a go at each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning his shepherd’s pie, he swung his schoolbag over his shoulder and left.
Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony.
“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we’re off to do. She’ll try you two next, so brace yourself. Dad and Kingsley have both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She’s determined.”
“Good thing I wrote you a letter then!” Sirius announced. He produced two thick letters with a dramatic flourish and Remus rolled his eyes at him. Sirius handed one of the letters to Harry and the other to Sarah, who raised an eyebrow at the dark-haired man. “What?” he said, “Did you think that I’d only give the boys the talk? You have a boyfriend, too!”
She got off the bed. “Get up,” she said, smirking at how he blinked for a few moments hazily. “Go get dressed, I’ll meet you in the kitchen.”
He shook his head. “No. I had intended to separate myself as much as I could from the Wizarding World. I definitely hadn’t intended on bumping into Harry.”
Severus sighed. “Right now, I would guess that Draco would choose to do the subject just so you could,” he said, flicking through papers. “Also, I believe Miss Granger would want to try, just to show off…”
Sarah kept her polite façade fixed firmly on her face as she smiled and said, “Unfortunately no, Mr Bagman, I’m staying with my boyfriend and his family this summer.”
By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under the dishes and dishes of Mrs Weasley’s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, Draco, Sarah and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky.
And then suddenly they heard a shout and opened their eyes to see that Draco had launched himself at his father, knocking his wand out of his hand and placing himself in front of Sarah and his mother. Lucius barely had a second to realise who had stopped him before Draco’s curse hit him in the face, and he crumpled, unseeing grey eyes staring at the ceiling.
“Oh blimey,” said Lee, covering his mouth. “That was me. Fred and George let me a couple, I’ve been levitating them in through her window…”
“Lovely,” Pansy drawled. Lyra could see the relief sparking behind her dark eyes. “Whatever would we do without your good soul, Potter?”
“You need time to finish your studies,” Fred agreed. “And we should travel. Once you graduate, we’ll go on a trip before training starts. Just you and me.”
“Ugh, I still don’t like this,” Sarah huffed, sitting down in front of Draco and leaning up against his chest. “Draco and I are going to be happily sequestered in my dorm with Pansy and Blaise. You can tell us everything tomorrow.”
“That reminds me,” Madam Pomfrey stated suddenly, causing Lyra to sit up straighter in the chair beside Draco’s bed. The matron pushed a small bag of potions into her hands. “Take one of these every day at dinner – it’ll help increase your nutritional levels. Don’t think I didn’t notice.”
“Snape killed him,” said Harry. “I was there, I saw it. We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that’s where the Mark was…Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realised it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobilised me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under the Invisibility Cloak – and then Crabbe came through the door and disarmed him – “
“Wait a second – “ Draco gasped. He rolled off Harry and to the side, reaching into the bedside table and grabbing a small bottle.
“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure that was advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.”
She glanced around the room at the group they had managed to get together. Every free surface was claimed by someone: the Weasleys; Harry’s fellow Gryffindors Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan and Neville Longbottom; and their small group consisting of Draco, Hermione, Harry and herself. Ron was making his way over with plates piled high with food.
The school could talk of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. Th Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat grey pony, who’s painting had once hung in the corridor leading to the North Tower, according to Harry, Ron and Hermione.
“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are – one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!”
A cry went up from the group as Sarah and Fred were spotted. Beaming faces appeared before them as hugs were exchanged and tears were shed. Hermione was shamelessly sobbing as Pansy handed her a handkerchief, her own dark eyes suspiciously shiny.
At last, the Floo flared green and Lyra stepped through, closely followed by Draco and Narcissa. Pansy immediately jumped forward and embraced Lyra, who raised her arms as if in a daze and put them around the smaller girl. Blaise pulled Draco’s thin body close to his broad chest, murmuring something Harry couldn’t hear.
She calmly walked through the crowd of students, who had thankfully turned back to their own conversations, and up the boy’s stairs into Harry’s room.
Her spell narrowly missed Crabbe as he jumped out of the way at the last second. It collided with a wall of junk, which exploded, causing them all to take several steps back. Sarah raced towards Harry, who was diving toward a nearby pile, frantically scrabbling through the various objects.
Sarah was eating breakfast the day of the match when a jet of light suddenly shot her way. Theo shouted and pushed her out of the way; the spell soared over their heads and hit the back wall of the Hall, leaving a smoking scorch mark behind.
Five minutes later, the rest of the crowd left the Great Hall and walked down the lawn to the Quidditch Pitch, which was now completely unrecognisable. A twenty-foot hedge ran all the way around the edge of it. there was a gap right in front of the stands: the entrance to the vast maze. The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.
They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived before Sarah, Draco, Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.
“Sorry,” the other girl shrugged. “Having spent so much time with Ron and Harry, I don’t get much exposure to maturity.”
“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?” Ron said. “There’s no way she was there, there’s no way she could’ve heard – “
Draco’s laugh echoed around them as Blaise and Pansy appeared, each demanding a dance with Sarah and Draco.
“No charm will work on these,” said Madam Pomfrey. “I’ve tried everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites. They’re similar to your scars, Sarah.”
“He doesn’t have a choice, Sarah,” Dumbledore said apologetically. “How this situation arose, we do not know. It seems to me that we have no choice but to accept it.”
Sarah thought about it for a long while. This wasn’t the first time that Ron had been stupid and ended up hurting those around him. Was it worth forgiving him when there was a chance of him doing it again?
Madam Pomfrey nodded, smiling at the brunette. “And I would teach you along the way – it would be very practical and may mean outside reading at some points to ensure you understood the concept of something.”
“The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding. In light of what has happened – of Lord Voldemort’s return – such ties are more important than ever before.”
“Sarah and the boys can show you guys to your rooms,” Sirius said as Remus conversed with Mr and Mrs Weasley. “They’re on the second floor, I think.”
Draco internally rolled his eyes but began the proceedings. In all actuality, he preferred working with Charles during surgeries because the boy talked much less than his sister. It was no wonder that she got on spectacularly with Rosalyn.
As the three boys made their way over to the Slytherin table, a blush began to rise up Draco’s neck.
“Okay,” Sarah said, nodding to herself. “I’ll talk to Snape tomorrow. I might even consider dropping History of Magic,” she continued sadly. “If I want to learn anything I can also use the Manor’s libraries.”
Lyra frowned slightly at that. “We can get some, Orion,” she told her son, who shook his blond head at her.
“Draco, what happened?” Sarah said as she forced the chocolate down. Even though she didn’t like eating it solid, it did make her feel warmer.
The next morning, Sarah had barely woken up before Draco was dragging her out of bed, a letter clutched to his chest. She threw on her uniform and followed him out of the dormitory, the other girls still sleeping peacefully behind them.
“Actually, I don’t,” Hermione confessed. She ignored Harry’s shocked expression and went on, “All I really see is two grown men who have a mutual interest in each other.”
“The bitch!” she cried. Heads turned their way and Sarah snapped at them, “Pay attention to your own lives!”
“Is she okay?” Potter asked in a whisper, turning around again and acting as if he were struggling with Draco.
Fred released her so that they could look around the Hall. There was no sign of the dark-haired boy.
“Talk to him,” she urged. “The two of you just need to clear the air. He’s probably doesn’t even mean to pull away.”
He led her to Griphook’s room in time to see Harry agreeing to Griphook’s terms and shaking his frail hand.
“Fred’s two years old than me,” Sarah shrugged, “but he doesn’t mind that I want to take it slow. I understand about Viktor, though. You need to do what you’re comfortable with.”
And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Lyra saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pyjamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the Hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Lyra the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers. They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Lyra looked Death Eaters were folding under the sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde.
“You don’t have to if you don’t want to, obviously,” Harry said quickly. “It was just a thought but I completely understand if you – “
“Of course they didn’t,” Hermione interjected. Draco shot her a grateful look. “They weren’t in there long enough.”
“Harry wants to buy stuff,” she translated. “Grab me a basket, dearest?” she fluttered her lashes at Draco and pouted her lips slightly.
After a quick breakfast and another potion for Ron, they packed up the tent and reversed the protective enchantments. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town.
“Did you really think we’d have sex with everyone here?” he asked, rolling his eyes. “Unbelievable.”
He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M, which he had taken from the witch’s purse.
When the dog sprang back toward them, Ron pushed Harry out of way and the dog’s jaws fastened around Ron’s outstretched arms. Sarah and the others leapt forward as the dog began to drag Ron away like a rag doll, but something hit the four of them so hard across the chest that they were knocked off their feet.
“Don’t get snarky with me, young miss,” Tom grunted. “I’m the one being generous enough to give yer the best room in the place.”
Sarah smiled brightly at Harry and the twins. She reached out and closed George’s hand over the money bag.
Sarah turned back to Harry with an unimpressed look on her face. Leaning back against the wooden chair, she crossed her arms over her chest and scowled at Harry.
Harry’s smile widened and he shrugged cheekily. “I don’t have any plans,” he admitted. “I just couldn’t stand you staring at that pile for another hour.”
“Is that right?” Fred laughed, rolling so that he was leaning above her, resting on his elbows. “I look forward to having you as my personal Healer. Think of all the benefits.”
Harry’s stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in its saucer. He tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together so that some of the hot liquid trickled down onto his robes.
,” Sarah groaned, slamming shut another thick tome. “We’ve gone through practically every book in the library surrounding snakes!”
“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that goblet – I – I reckon they’re trying to do you in!”
Sarah transfigured her robes into an imitation of Madam Pomfrey’s as Draco and Hermione went to Harry’s side.
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin. Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed. “It’s always best to have company when you’re dealing with a boggart. It can get confused. The charm to repel a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart off is
Draco’s face pinched but he nodded and entered the lift. The others quickly followed, everyone gripping their wands tightly in their hands. The gate clattered closed loudly behind them and the lift began to descend quickly. When the cool female voice said, “Department of Mysteries,” the grilles slid open again and they stepped out into a corridor where nothing was moving but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift.
“I spoke a different language? But – I didn’t realise – how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?”
The Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one I the morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Sarah bid the boys goodnight and climbed the stairs to Hermione’s dormitory, where she found the girl sitting on her bed, eyes red-rimmed and puffy. Sarah said nothing but wrapped Hermione up in a warm hug, before laying them both down and stroking the other girl’s curls until they both fell asleep.
“I know, mate,” said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry’s plate, “she’s bang out of order.”
Sarah watched as Hermione disappeared into the crowd before resuming walking. Draco caught sight of her frown and asked, “Everything okay?”
“Anyway, sorry to ditch you guys but we’ve got somewhere to be,” Sarah said, pecking Fred quickly on the mouth and giving the other two hugs. “Blaise has brought us a little surprise to celebrate the start of term.”
“Well, in that case,” Fred smiled crookedly at her and prised her arms apart to hold her hands gently. “Sarah, it has come to my attention that, astonishingly enough, I find that I quite like you.”
Sarah looked over at Hermione and the question she had been about to ask died in her throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Muggleborns with such tenderness in her expression that Sarah felt almost as if they had surprised her in the act of kissing him.
“That’s Filch,” Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard.
“Well, we won’t find out unless we look at it,” Harry said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor despite their warning shouts.
“That one goes best with the other decorations,” Sarah said glumly. “No offence, but I’ll be much happier when this is all over.”
Sarah’s stomach gave a jolt. It felt as though the thestral’s head was suddenly pointing toward the ground; she had actually slid forward a few inches along its neck. Sarah scrambled until she felt slightly more secure on the invisible body. They were descending at last. Bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides. They could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous inset eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows. Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling toward the pavement. Sarah gripped the thestral with every last ounce of her strength, braced for sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Sarah gratefully slid off, stumbling into a wall without a shred of her usual grace.
Hermione’s lip wobbled as she struggled not to sob loudly. Heavy footsteps sounded and Sarah refused to look up as Greyback knelt beside her and ran one large, sharp nail up and down her body. She clenched her eyes tightly shut as Hermione’s screams and Bellatrix’s questions filled the room.
“Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination class, and we were reading the tea leaves, and – “
Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. at last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table and approached the portrait of Ariana.
Harry had been grumpier recently due to Dumbledore’s extended absence. He had told them about his first private lesson with the headmaster and everyone had been more confused than relieved. Apparently, Dumbledore was intent on showing Harry memories regarding Voldemort – or Tom Riddle, his birth name – before he had gained power. Harry’s frustration at a lack of answers and an incredibly slow pace was starting to grate on everyone’s nerves, no one more so than Draco.
Draco and Sarah awkwardly avoided eye contact with the others. Sarah could vividly remember one dinner where her father had spat that word out talking about someone he worked with.
He waved over his shoulder and sauntered away, trying to push images of green eyes and bright smiles from his mind.
“Apparently McGonagall’s done an excellent job of fixing the place up,” she said. “Mr Weasley was talking to Bill about it last night.”
“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for us to change.”
It happened so fast that Lyra wasn’t entirely sure who moved first. All she knew was that a moment later, her arms were wrapped around George’s neck as his gripped her waist, their mouths pressed together. When they pulled back, she was fully sitting on his lap but neither of them seemed inclined to move.
“T-took?” sobbed Mrs Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it when I was eleven years old. It – it – it –
She turned away from the window and her gaze fell upon another peculiar object, standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a beautiful but austere looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear-trumpets curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings were stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead.
“I’m going to pretend you didn’t say that,” she said. “And If you ever say it near Pansy or Blaise, be prepared to be given shit about it for the rest of your life.”
They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Sarah struggled, trying to throw off the Snatcher’s hand, but it was hopeless: Draco and Harry were squeezed tightly against her on either side, she could not separate from the group, and the breath was squeezed out of her.
“And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t noticed!” said Hermione. “Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble…”
They had arrived back in Grimmauld Place and as soon as they had all stepped into the kitchen, Ron had turned a furious glare upon Draco and Sarah. Sirius and Remus glanced up in surprise from where they had been drinking tea and talking.
The day found both Harry and Draco dreading the evening. Harry because of his first Occlumency lesson with Snape and Draco because that was when his mother’s reply should arrive. Sarah waited with Draco in the Gryffindor common room for Harry’s lesson to finish, both distractedly trying to complete their homework for the day. Fred and George were demonstrating their newest product, Headless Hats, and the common room was full of shrieks of laughter and excitement.
Draco wrapped an arm around her shoulder and hid her from view as she struggled to suck in enough air to fill her lungs.
“I don’t deserve it,” Greg said softly, and Sarah was startled to see the tell-tale signs of tears in his eyes.
“Who knew Fred was capable of uttering such a vituperative comment?” Sirius said in mock horror. “Moony, protect me from the mean ginger.”
“He’s fine, still sleeping,” she replied tiredly. She was exhausted. The extra classes were interesting but with the day she’s had, she was more than ready to go to sleep.
“Anyway, Sarah and I were walking behind Katie the entire time,” Harry said. “If either of us had been the target, she would have just given it to us.”
“Mum was all too happy to provide for this,” he commented absently as he filled a plate and handed it to Sarah. “She thinks you work too hard.”
Snape’s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard’s hat at once.
“That’s right,” sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin.
When the last person had taken their seat, Dumbledore picked up his menu and said very clearly to his plate, “Pork chops!”
Sarah groaned as she dropped into the seat beside Draco at the Slytherin table for the Welcoming Feast.
Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed triumph. “You’re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?” he said, his eyes glittering. “I’ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a goblet along. And very lucky I did…lucky for, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance as it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along with passageway and out of sight.”
“Did you know?” Fudge cried at them but before they could reply, Bagman’s voice filled the box again.
“That’s only because he knows you need much more help in that department,” Draco said primly. Neither of them noticed the interested listeners who leant closer to hear better.
Harry looked out the window and was surprised to see that the sun was setting. He hadn’t even realised how much time had passed.
Sarah had merely shaken her head and smacked Ron up the back of his head for his stupidity. She had spent a few minutes calming Ginny down before sending her along to class.
“Honestly, we have to learn how to Disillusion ourselves,” Sarah muttered, stretching up and hearing her back pop. “You boy take up too much space.”
“Well, it could have been anyone,” Hermione frowned. “I just don’t understand how she was expected to get it into the castle…”
“I love you, too,” she said, kissing him softly. When they broke apart she said, “I’ve been thinking. I think we should move into the Manor.”
The four of them slipped out of the kitchen and began the ascent up the many rickety staircases to the top level. Ron’s room was just below the attic. On the third floor, a door stood ajar. They caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at Harry before it closed with a snap.
She turned around, her wild dark hair whipping behind her, and smiled maniacally at the sight of the newest observer.
With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry, Hermione, Draco and Sarah spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry and Draco were out on lookout while Sarah made some food, Hermione keeping Ron company.
Lyra was peacefully eating dinner, minding her own business, when Harry dropped into the seat beside her, his face set in determination.
“How is everyone this fine morning?” Draco called, opening the curtains and windows to let in the cool October breeze. “Hopefully, some of you will find a new home today, how does that sound?”
“The Burrow is going to be horrible,” complained Harry. “All he’s going to be talking about is Lavender. And Hermione was supposed to go as well!”
Nobody laughed this time: there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him again.
Lyra stared at Madam Pomfrey as she puttered around Draco’s bed, picking up and replacing various potions and ointments.
“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice then when you did it, Harry.”
“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him beside Sarah, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between George and Ron instead.
“The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black is ready for you, Master Draco,” Kreacher muttered, “and your…
came from the kids' table, Sarah had to disagree with that sentiment as she got to her feet, resigning herself to teaching a lesson on appropriate and inappropriate words.
He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, leaving Sarah standing before the quivering Hufflepuffs.
Everyone laughed at Sarah’s comment, even Warrington, who seemed angry about it. Crabbe flushed pink.
“Shut up, Parkinson,” Harry exclaimed. “You talk as if you never walk around with marks on your neck or on Blaise’s.”
Draco and Harry finally got a moment to themselves and simply stood there, foreheads pressed together and hands intertwined.
Sarah nodded in agreement and took a step back, tearing her eyes from the floating brains. They hurried back into the dark circular room; the ghostly shapes of the brains were now swimming before Sarah’s eyes instead of the blue candle flames.
“No,” Sarah repeated, jumping to her feet and grabbing Harry’s arm. “He didn’t put his name in – that’s ridiculous.”
“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs Weasley. “She’s not old enough! What were you two thinking, bringing her with you – “
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?” asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.
“I’m not ashamed,” said Neville very faintly, still looking everywhere but at them. Ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds.
“I believe I technically count as a customer,” Draco replied coolly before Harry could. He got to his feet. “Potter, I don’t think I’ll be getting this book. It makes absolutely no sense.”
Care of Magical Creatures earned Harry another night’s detention when he snapped at Crabbe while the other boy was describing how Buckbeak went to attack him. Draco had stepped forward and politely told Professor Umbridge that the Minister had already heard this story and, as the person who was injured, his recount held more weight than that of Crabbe’s.
“We’re paying them!” he exclaimed indignantly. “And it’s not like we’re forcing them. The little snots volunteered.”
“Can’t I just be in a bad mood?” he snapped. “Or am I only allowed to be happy-go-lucky all the time?”
Unknown hands dragged Sarah roughly outside. Before she could stop them, someone had snatched her wand out of her hand. She grunted in pain as the same person punched her in the stomach. From the corner of her eye, she saw her friends in similar positions of restraint.
As they hurried down the corridor, Fang lolloping beside them, Sarah’s mind raced with possibilities of where the diadem could be hidden. Where would Voldemort have thought was a place only he knew…that no one else would ever be able to find…a place that could hold a million hidden things…
“This is the wizarding section,” Potter explained. “There are muggle-repelling and notice-me-not spells around the entrance so that muggles don’t notice anyone coming and going. I thought it would be good to have it available, just in case, you know?”
Harry knelt beside her, his face pale and stained with tears. Tremors still rocked both their bodies from the aftershock of the Cruciatus Curse. Harry released the Cup but tightened his grip on Sarah. In turn, Sarah tightened her hold on Cedric’s robes.
“Getting to all your classes!” Ron said. “I’ve heard you talking about your Ancient Studies lesson yesterday but we had Care of Magical Creatures! And you’ve never missed a lesson of either.”
He tapped one of the bricks with a wand. It had a small design engraved into it. It almost looked like –
Draco nodded and immediately stood up, grabbing his bag and walking toward the Gryffindor table. Ron didn’t notice Harry leaving.
“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, “is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.”
But Voldemort broke off: Neville had run forward and charged Voldemort. He hit the ground, Disarmed, Voldemort throwing his wand aside and laughing.
“Harry’s done lots of renovations on the place!” Teddy inputted happily. “He sometimes even lets me hit something with a hammer.”
They finally reached the judge’s table. Viktor, Cedric and Fleur were watching as they skidded to a halt, arms resting on their knees as they gasped for breath.
“Nearly there, Ron,” said Hermione as the gamekeeper’s cabin came into view. “You’ll be all right in a minute – almost there – “
“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn right harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, then inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.”
“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.”
“He means that ve are the only people he can stand at school,” Mila said smoothly. Her accent was less obvious than Viktor’s and Sarah thought that she might have been German instead of Bulgarian. Mila had bright blue eyes and startling blond hair with dyed pink tips.
“Er,” said Ron tentatively, “my dad told me about one…Is it called the Imperius Curse, or something?”
“Silly?” Harry said crossly. He turned his bright green eyes on Draco’s inquisitive silver ones. “Sarah drained her magical core helping Madam Pomfrey and just did more magic on me.”
“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.”
George snickered. “You need to watch your language in my joke store, Lyra. I might just have to fire you.”
But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.
Draco was sitting at the desk in his and Harry’s room doing his latest Charms essay when Harry walked into their way. Draco glanced up and was surprised to see that the other boy had a determined look on his face, his hands clenched into tight fists at his side.
Mrs Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who moved Sarah out of the way and turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand.
Ron suddenly clapped Harry on the shoulder and declared, “Right! Well, I’ll go tell ‘Mione, shall I?”
“Finally!” said Ron, grinning at them as they sat down. “We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s and – “
“I’ll talk to him later,” Draco said dismissively, eyeing the Gryffindor table where Harry was angrily stabbing a piece of roast piece. “Let him cool down a bit…”
“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort’s silencing charms seemed unable to hold.
As the wand sealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Sarah knew that he had succeeded. Harry picked up the holly and phoenix warmth, smiling softly down at it. Draco stepped up to him and laced his fingers through Harry’s free hand.
“You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,” he said, observing her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair. “Surely you did not use it all? I told you that three drops would be sufficient.”
Harry hesitated for a long moment, glancing around the room to make sure no one could eavesdrop on them.
Harry looked surprised for a moment. “Er…No, actually. I hadn’t.” He stared down at the wooden table for a while before saying, “Do you think he is?”
“I do,” said Remus firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. The “Boy Who Lived” remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.”
It was nearly lunch by the time they said their goodbyes to Hagrid and made their way back towards the castle, Ron thankfully, slug free.
Sarah cheered along with the other Slytherins and a few students from the other Houses. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. “Do you think he’s all right?” she squealed through her fingers.
Sarah’s voice broke on his name, and in an unusual public display of affection, Theo grabbed her free hand, holding tightly onto it.
“From Professor Umbridge,” muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall’s beady, square-framed eyes.
“I know,” said Harry. “I mean, that’s only the second time I’ve don’t it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once – long story – but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to – that was before I knew I was a wizard – “ he rambled.
“No, you basically did,” Lyra continued. “This means I can tease you about a certain someone and you can’t do anything about it.”
She spluttered and hissed, launching it back at him and causing him to fall flat on the bed. “Of course, I do!” she announced. “He’s nearly one! He can say my name now!”
“I don’t know where we went wrong with them, though,” said Mrs Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans. “I would think that if they wanted to do something like that, they’d at least make the effort to be more prepared but they won’t listen to – OH NOT
bemoaned Draco. “Maybe you should just go pick Teddy up yourself…That way I can live a nice, long life.”
“I didn’t properly introduce myself earlier,” said the woman who had crashed into Draco, “My name is Tonks.”
“I saw we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called to them. “Straight into the water before it realises we’re here!”
Sarah and Fred bent over in fits of laughter as everyone sorted themselves out, blinking in tired confusion until they realised who exactly had awoken them.
“You can keep your cock to yourself, Draco, dear,” Blaise said breezily. “I’m not interested. Just wanted to know if your talents were actually as good as you said they were.”
Harry’s birthday arrived in a flurry of last-minute baking, present wrapping, and diversionary techniques – the last of which resided upon Sarah so that the others could set up the dining area for the birthday dinner.
“I heard you were dating George Weasley, Lyra,” Luna continued. “Congratulations. It will help with both your Nargle problem.”
He pushed them back until they stumbled toward the bed, falling in a heap on the soft comforter. Harry immediately clambered on top of Draco, licking and kissing up and down his chest.
They all looked up to see Hermione and Weasley standing before, the former looking quite pale and the latter looking as though he was going to collapse at any moment. Considering he had just lost his brother, Lyra wasn’t surprised.
The air had frozen: Sarah’s breath caught and solidified in her chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the castle, their faces hooded and their breath rattling.
But Pettigrew’s eyes just widened and he smiled slightly. Hermione screamed at Sarah and she whirled around, coming face-to-face with the werewolf.
“Means I’m now free to access my vaults as well as walk through London,” he continued gleefully. “I haven’t felt this alive in years!”
by Cassandra Vablatsky. When she turned back to him, he was staring intently at a book which had a depiction of a large, black dog on the cover.
“I can’t even be upset right now, I’m so happy!” Draco shouted, pulling Harry into another bone-crushing hug. “You’re amazing, Harry! Amazing!”
“Oh no,” said Sarah, quaking so badly that her knees gave way. “Oh, shit, that was terrifying. Oh, my fucking Merlin.”
all the facts – but a general picture. It’s better he gets them from us, rather than a garbled version from others…”
“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,” Hermione explained as she resumed her seat. “But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.”
“There’s no way that will work,” Sarah disagreed. “Even if it did work, how would you explain to your parents how Harry got here?”
The drawing room, once a place of laughter for Sarah and Draco, was now dark and cold. They were forced into the middle of the room, directly beneath the chandelier.
Sarah had taken over running the Hospital Wing when Poppy retired the previous year. Even though she was slightly sad to leave her job as St Mungos, she loved Hogwarts. And Harry had practically begged her not to leave him alone when their brood of children descended upon the school.
Mrs Weasley’s face softened fractionally. “I don’t blame you, dear, or Harry or Draco.” She patted Sarah’s cheek softly.
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be risk-free – “
“Oh, you know,” Narcissa said breezily, “the usual mind-numbing hobbies. I’ve taken up painting recently. Unfortunately, it seems I do not share the natural talent that Draco has. I believe I may try something less ego smothering next time.”
“But it’s due on Friday, Hermione,” Weasley whined from across the table. “I don’t see why we have to finish it now!”
“Did the blood test reveal anything?” Potter asked Draco. He had placed one hand on the back of Edward’s back, seemingly unconsciously.
Sarah stood up to see Moody moving his wand up and down, the ferrets following his movement – they flew ten feet into the air, fell with a smack to the floor, and then bounced upward once more.
“You’re joking,” he laughed. When Blaise continued to look at him steadily, he turned to Pansy, who looked as if she agreed with Blaise. Draco let out another weak chuckle before grabbing his drink from Pansy and downing it.
Draco grabbed her hand and led her to a clear patch of grass around the other side of the house. They could see open fields bathed in moonlight with the stars twinkling gleefully above them.
“No,” Potter was saying. “He only really has contact with Teddy and me during the day. Luna came over a few days ago so he might have been exposed to something she was in contact with?”
Harry’s eyes locked with his and Draco felt something in his chest tighten at the sincerity in the green irises.
At that moment, the doors burst open and Draco rushed in. He relaxed significantly when he saw Sarah sitting calmly on a bed.
Harry looked closer and blinked in surprise. “I think it did,” he said in wonderment, “It would explain how my father and his friends used it until they graduated.”
Fred kept doing what he was doing for a few seconds longer before listening to her pleas. He climbed back up her body and crashed his lips to hers as he positioned himself and pushed forward. They both groaned and gripped each other tightly as he let her adjust.
“You’d get bored down there and try to come and see what we were doing,” Harry shrugged. “Easier this way.”
“You have to clear your mind,” Sarah repeated for the unknown time that evening. The three of them had sequestered the Room of Requirement to practice but so far Harry had been struggling to make any progress.
Honestly, I think I might've gone overboard with the boggart but I think it's good for the plot? Maybe?
“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. “Good, good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange, Mr and Mrs Malfoy,” said the old goblin, hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, “I shall take you to your vault.”
When they arrived in the Burrow that afternoon, laden down with various bags, Mrs Weasley and Hermione gushed over the boys’ haircuts.
,” said Snape dismissively (over in the corner Crabbe snickered), “but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spellcasting. Not all wizards can do this, of course; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some” – his gaze lingered maliciously on Harry once more – “lack.”
As the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next morning, Hermione, Draco and Sarah gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.
At long last, five hours after she had arrived in the Hospital Wing, the last student was sleeping peacefully dosed up on a selection of Pepper-Up potion and Dreamless Sleep. Madam Pomfrey and Sarah slumped into chairs and groaned as their sore muscles protested the movement.
“Where are Harry and Ron?” called Sarah, looking around quickly at the emptying platform. She spotted Mrs Weasley looking around with a worried expression on her face.
The Slytherins waited until the other Houses had left the Hall before following Slughorn, who was wearing magnificent long, emerald green robes embroidered with silver. They were heading, as Sarah saw when she stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors, toward the lake. The warmth of the sun caressed her face as they followed Slughorn in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows. An aisle ran down the centre of them: there was a marble table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beautiful summer’s day.
Sarah laughed and walked away. She saw Hermione and Viktor talking intently, Hermione subtly wiping her eyes. Sarah was about to go over to them when she felt an arm wrap around her waist.
Sarah did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.
Sarah rolled her eyes and allowed herself to be pulled along by him. They had Apparated on the outskirts of a forest about ten minutes ago and Sarah still had no clue what was going on.
“Yes, but it doesn’t make me wish it wasn’t necessary at all,” Draco muttered, threading on hand through Lyra’s loose hair.
Harry nodded and kissed her forehead quickly before hurrying out of the library, leaving Sarah to turn back to her essay.
Draco had stood in shock, gaping at the smaller woman’s spiky haircut. Eventually, Sirius had peeled the woman off Draco’s prone form and steered her into the kitchen, where she managed to bump into three chairs along with way.
“Ron,” she said suddenly, cutting off his retelling of one of his saves. “No one wanted to say this but I have to – the only part of the match we actually saw was Davies’s first goal.”
“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Lyra heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your head,” he said quietly, “be it.”
“Well, that’s why he and his friends came, I think – well, they’re obviously interested in learning defense, but if Ginny hadn’t told Michael what was going on – “
Neville had gone bright red and stuttered slightly, “We-well there should be some in the Potions supply closet?”
“And he ordered – Kreacher to leave – without him. And he told Kreacher – to go home – and never to tell my Mistress – what he had done – but to destroy – the first locket. And he drank – all the potion – and Kreacher swapped the lockets – and watched…as Master Regulus…was dragged beneath the water…and…”
“There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,” said Dumbledore, “but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuff table, “enjoying our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.”
“S’pose so,” Harry said to Ron; but just then, Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the Gryffindor table toward them.
Sarah turned into Draco’s chest and his arms wrapped around her. It was a long time before either of them drifted off to sleep.
“I’m incredibly sorry but I’ve just seen someone I need to speak with,” Sarah said, already tugging Blaise away. “Enjoy your evening!”
“Draco, be nice to Sarah,” Remus said mildly, not looking up from his conversation with Bill. Draco blushed as Sarah smiled smugly at him.
“Oh, it’s no bother at all,” Molly declared. “As long as everyone acts their age, there shouldn’t be any problems.”
They moved at the same time and she dodged before sending two lightning-quick spells their way. The jets of light hit them and their wands flew toward her. She grabbed them from the air and smiled brightly at the dumbstruck boys.
He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred grey fish on his face. Sarah glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as she expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. Sarah clenched her jaw to refrain from swearing at him. It was one of those days where Sarah had been unsuccessful in finding somewhere to get supplies; Harry and Draco had even ventured out with her but to no luck.
Lyra hadn’t yet forgiven the other girl for how she had acted when Harry told her he wasn’t interested in pursuing a relationship with her. Apparently, they had gotten closer during sixth year but Harry had been adamant with his decisions. Ginny hadn’t taken it well. She had screamed at him loud enough to draw Lyra and Draco down from their rooms, with the twins arriving just in time to see the redheaded girl slap Harry full across the face and call him a “self-righteous bastard who never thought about anyone other than himself.”
They found her in the first unlocked classroom they tried. She was sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Sarah could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.
“Honestly, I’m somewhat glad we were never trapped in this place,” Lyra said. “At least the Manor has class.”
“Yes,” Harry said, a smile tugging at his lips. “Hermione was telling us how Lavender couldn’t stop shrieking about it.”
“Let’s see if Draco’s answer changes when it’s his sister on the line as well,” Bellatrix cackled, passing Lyra to Greyback despite the girl’s struggles.
“I still can’t believe you didn’t tell me,” he grumbled that night during their first D.A meeting of the term. He slashed his wand slightly more viciously through the air than was warranted and Lee had to duck as a hex flew swiftly toward his face. “I’m your
“Yes – yes – a boy,” said Remus again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. Sirius released Sarah and strode towards Harry and Draco, pulling them both into a hug.
“Go!” she hissed, pushing Sarah away. Sarah took a few unsteady steps forward before collapsing to the ground in a painful heap.
The Fat Lady was snoozing and not too pleased to be woken up when they arrived on the seventh floor, but she swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the empty common room.
On the surface, he knew that there was nothing wrong with being gay. Seamus and Dean had been making eyes at each other for the last two years and no one cared. Harry also knew that Terry Boot was known to sleep with both males and females. It wasn’t like Harry thought it was
Draco’s eyes widened comically and he held up a hand. “Potter, Lyra has already explained the truce she has made with you and your Gryffindors. Don’t feel like you need to say anything else.”
“Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
“Is that so?” Draco said coolly. “I can’t say the same about you.” Sarah knew he was lying, Lucius Malfoy made it a habit to mention Karkaroff and Durmstrang at least twice a year during summer.
There was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where it was going, and Sarah knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling on to its broad back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling below them like a grey and green map, Sarah’s overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast’s neck, she clung tight to the metallic scales, and the cool breeze was soothing on her burned and blistered skin, the dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind her, whether from delight or fear she could not tell, Draco kept swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. Harry’s pale face was directly opposite hers; he had an expression of pure relief and joy tugging at his lips. Sarah was honestly leaning more towards Hermione’s coping mechanism. She just wanted to crawl up into a ball and cry for days.
that automatically it means he was as Dark wizard?” said Harry, glaring at the girl. She wasn’t given an opportunity to do more than shake her head quickly before Professor Binns interrupted.
“Remus is going to be pissed you told them,” Draco said in a flat voice. He suddenly looked at Sarah. “Do you think this is what mother meant in her letter? Do you think these were the unexpected guests?”
With a sharp whistle, the match began. Lee Jordan was providing the match commentary, to Sarah’s great amusement. He kept getting told off by Professor McGonagall for focusing on the Firebolt instead of the match.
“With you lot as godparents, he definitely will,” Ron laughed, joining them. Draco was with them within a moment and the five of them smiled happily at each other. They hadn’t felt this free and happy in so long and they were going to cherish it, however long it lasted.
“Well, lucky for you, Draco is a genius at Charms,” said Lyra as she subtly jabbed Draco with her elbow. “I’m would have failed for years without him.”
“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said Crabbe. “And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”
“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” demanded Fleur. “You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?”
She kept chattering on to Lupin’s amusement. They decided that Sarah would go back to the Weasley’s on the train and Lupin would pick her up from there. That would give him time to sort out his house and prepare a room.
The weather remained undecided as they travelled farther and farther north. Rain spattered the windows in a half-hearted way, then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more. When darkness fell, the lamps came on inside the carriages, dimly lighting the space. Sarah dozed in Draco’s lap while he slept on Harry’s shoulder; the three of them quite tired after their interrupted sleep the night before.
“Mr Malfoy, Miss Deaumont, Miss Parkinson, Mr Nott,” Dumbledore said gravely. “Can you come with us, please?”
“Draco, I cannot stay,” Narcissa said instead, not answering Draco’s question. “I must leave now that Sarah is safe with you.”
It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands. Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “He can’t be back, Dumbledore, he just can’t be…”
Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.
“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our programme, that Harry Potter is still alive?”
Snape sneered but at that moment, the kitchen door burst open and the entire Weasley family, plus Hermione, came inside, all looking very happy, with Mr Weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas.
Sarah grimaced at the reminder. She knew she would have to go back to her Manor when the term ended and she was dreading it.
“It’s just hard,” Harry muttered. “And I’ve just been feeling angry all the time. It suddenly rears up inside me and then disappears.”
She sighed deeply and muttered, “I slapped Ernie because he was spouting all this nonsense of you being influenced by Draco and me and that our “
“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.”
The door behind them burst open. To Sarah’s horror, Ron came in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.
Lyra scoffed and leaned further into the cushions of the couch she had commandeered. “Well, it looked like a painful process so I thought I ought to rescue you from your suffering.”
By the evening before the second task, they had still failed to figure out what to use to keep Harry breathing underwater for an hour. Harry, Sarah, Draco and Hermione were sitting in the library, desperately scanning through book after book of spells that could help Harry.
“Just because you don’t understand the appeal of cock doesn’t mean that others are so unfortunate,” Blaise grinned back.
“Ha!” said Blaise triumphantly. He turned to Draco and hit him in the shoulder. “He definitely smells you, mate. How does it feel to be in
She kept counting and casting, not stopping even though hand tried to tug her away. She dropped her head to Remus’s chest, barely breathing, barely thinking –
“Because I like you!” Cho said. “And you seemed to like me last year! I know that whatever you have with Malfoy isn’t going to last – everyone knows that. There’s no way someone like him could ever be with you.”
“The only reason I deal with such horrid treatment is because I love them, Teddy,” she said with a pout. “Protect me from the nasty meanies.”
“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear!”
“Oh shit,” breathed Sarah, gripping Harry’s arm tightly. Hagrid had tried to teach Grawp their names but he hadn’t been able to pronounce them properly. “he – he remembered…”
want to hear about the times McGonagall stopped you from doing something revolting,” Pansy shuddered.
Everyone she knew was bombarded with questions surrounding the article and Draco had eventually had to put up an ongoing
“Fred’s right,” Mr Weasley said gravely. “You all need to go. Head into the woods, find somewhere safe – I’ll come find you when I can.”
person he knows that has any sort of connection to his family. He craves it. He’s never known that true love of a parent. Give him this opportunity.
“What?” Pansy said flippantly. “If you get to have a shag than so do I. It just so happened we were already on your bed. It’s not like we could’ve moved to one of the others when Sarah and the boys were occupying them.”
“Really what nonsense!” Professor McGonagall said angrily. “Harry could not have passed the Age Line and Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an old student to do it for him, I’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else!”
“It’s not as though we never get time,” Harry said, contradicting his previous words. “We were just busy and now everyone’s pairing off…”
A loud voice distracted her from gazing at the still water. Mila and Aleksander were pushing their way toward her, ignoring the grumbling students in their wake.
Sarah cringed slightly. She hadn’t told anyone other than Amanda and Tom the real reason she had left.
“That was years ago,” Sarah said, waving her hand. “And I’ve been dating Fred for nearly as long. Surely he wasn’t interested in me the entire time.”
“Of course I do,” said Hermione at once. “But I want more than that, I want to be properly trained in Defense because…because…” She took a great breath and finished, “Because Lord Voldemort’s back.”
“There, there, darling,” Sarah said, leaning over the table to pat Draco’s head slightly. “We all still love you despite your manipulative tendencies.”
Hermione didn’t react, just kept mechanically spooning food into her mouth. Sarah glanced at Draco to see her won worry reflected in his eyes. It was at that moment that Harry appeared in the kitchen. He didn’t seem to be able to look at Hermione, and same vice versa. Somehow, Sarah and Draco had found themselves in the middle of one of the most awkward and difficult friend breakup ever.
“Molly – Arthur – “ said Professor McGonagall, jumping up and hurrying to greet them. “I am so sorry – “
“If that dog can get in, we can,” Harry panted, lighting his wand and darting here and there, trying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches.
It was still dark outside. Mrs Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove, while Mrs Weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets. He looked up as the three girls entered and spread his arms so they could see his clothes more clearly. He was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt.
,” said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Sarah’s essay and she was pleased to see she had gotten an O.
Sarah looked at Pansy’s upside-down figure from her position lying on the couch. The short-haired girl was flicking through a large Charms textbook with a frown on her face and ink stains on her fingers.
“Damn right, you will,” Sarah grumbled, making herself comfortable again. “It’s bloody freezing up here.”
“We can’t do anything even if we knew what attacked Mrs Norris,” Sarah said sternly. “There’s no reason discussing anything about whether it’s possible or not, we just have to keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary and stay out of trouble.”
He stood up suddenly and marched away, leaving a devastated Hermione gazing after him. Ron followed quickly without a single glance in Hermione’s direction.
“Travers,” greeted Sarah. She recognised him from one of the many Malfoy parties. Not only that, but his voice revealed that he was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.
“Oh and guess what?” he said in excitement. “I managed to free Dobby from Mr Malfoy. I gave him a sock.”
“Harry,” Hermione elaborated. “You must not have seen him much before they left, but he wasn’t looking too good. Ron told me that he barely slept last night, just sat watching the stars most of the night.”
Harry grunted in agreement and reluctantly rolled off Draco, falling in a heap on his side. Draco reached over for his wand to clean them up and then tugged the covers over them both.
“No, he won’t,” countered Lyra, pressing a quick kiss to George’s lips. “Hermione is continuing to study. That man will have so much free time he won’t have anything better to do.”
“We’re not doing anything,” one brave one said haughtily. A glance down at her tie confirmed she was a Gryffindor. “You can’t kick us out.”
Draco frowned and flicked his gaze down to the wounds that Sarah tried to cover. His face paled and he spun around suddenly.
Harry, Sarah, Draco and Hermione scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.
“Maybe we should move first and then you can go?” Draco offered, answering Sarah’s previous comment.
Harry gasped in outrage and immediately began listing all the possible other options in a situation like that as Draco and Sarah laughed themselves to tears. They eventually fell asleep that way, curled around each other and savouring the comfort of the others’ presence.
“Couldn’t have put it better myself,” said Professor Lupin, and Sarah glowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears. This means,” he continued, ignoring Neville’s small sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?”
She moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essays for marking. Sarah gripped the black quill, feeling slightly uneasy for some reason.
Dean, who had been walking past at that moment, stopped dead and looked at them oddly. He opened his mouth as if to ask a question then paused, shook his head, and continued walking.
“The Department of Mysteries?” said Luna, looking mildly surprised. “But how are you going to get there?”
“And if you want something more worthwhile and fulfilling,” Sarah added, “maybe you need to be looking somewhere other than Lavender.”
“I’ve been getting them all out of The Burrow,” he explained. “Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eater’s know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the family – don’t apologise,” he added, at the sight of Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood traitor family there is.”
“There must be something he thinks is important in the memories,” Sarah pondered. “Something that will give you the answers as to how to stop Voldemort.”
“Deaumont, sir,” she said quickly. “Isn’t it true that legends always have a basis in fact? I remember you mentioning about a treaty created by warlocks in the early tenth century, yet when one looks back further into its creation, they can see that the foundations of the treaty were identical to a Scandinavian myth dated back into early BC times.”
“Really, what has gotten into you all today?” said Professor McGonagall, turning back into herself with a faint
“Ouch,” Aleksander said, settling beside Sarah and throwing an arm around her shoulders. “He’s good now, right?”
“Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt go! Potter’s really putting it through its paces now, see it turn – Chang’s Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt’s precision-balance is really noticeable in these long – “
Sarah’s mind was in freefall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the impossibility, because George Weasley could not be dead, the evidence of all her senses must be lying –
Sarah pulled back slightly to see that Fred’s eyes had widened in panic. Yep, he definitely hadn’t meant to say that.
“Huh, that is odd. But it doesn’t matter, really. He’s probably just trying to finish what Voldemort didn’t,” Harry muttered bitterly.
Lyra frowned down at the parchment and answered quietly, “Mother just let me know that father died in Azkaban last night.”
“It’s my business if you’re blackmailing someone,” said Ron. “George’s right, you could end up in serious trouble for that.”
“The same for you,” she said in relief, dropping down beside him. “You took a nasty hit – both of you,” she added to Luna. “Are you feeling all right?”
“See here, Dumbledore,” said Fudge, and Sarah was dumbstruck to see a slight smile dawning on his face, “you – you can’t seriously believe that. You-Know-Who – back? Come now, come now…certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You-Know-Who’s orders – but to take the word of a lunatic like that, Dumbledore…”
Crabbe leaned over from where he was sitting nearby and said in an undertone, “Maybe the stupid oaf’s got himself badly injured.”
“Well, the quicker you pack, the sooner it will all be over and you’ll be back here with me,” Harry reasoned. Draco shivered as Harry’s warm breath caressed his ear. “Besides, if you pack now, it gives us more time before you leave.”
Snape didn’t say anything until she was seated in front of his neck in his office. He paced back and forth on the other side of the wooden desk, hands clenching and unclenching. Suddenly, he stopped.
“Sirius, what are you doing here?” Sarah exclaimed, looking around wildly. None of the Muggles seemed to notice their group but Sarah was still worried that someone would be shouting about an escaped murderer on the middle of the platform.
Harry thought for a moment before answering in a soft voice, “I feel really happy. I love it when he’s near me and talking to me and I miss him when he’s not. It’s the same for you and Ron and Hermione but it’s also different. I know that no matter what I say, he won’t judge me, he’ll just support me.” Harry looked at Sarah quickly. “I’m not saying you don’t either it’s just – “
There was no time to argue the point further. Sarah could hear footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew too late, that Harry ought not to have shouted and given away their position.
“Yes, but not as my girlfriend,” Fred clarified. “Mum is ecstatic. But I think a part of her always thought you would end up with Harry or Draco.”
Sarah and Draco walked into the library after a Potions lesson to find Ron sitting at a table trying to complete his History of Magic homework.
“I’ve had an idea,” Hermione said, gazing into space. “I think I know…because then no one would be able to see…even Moody…and she’d have been able to get onto the window ledge…but she’s not allowed…she’s
daft?” she asked, disbelief painting her words. Draco, Hermione, Remus and the Weasleys jumped and turned to look at her. None of them had noticed she had woken up.
Sarah looked down fondly at her pseudo-father and brother as Remus slung an arm around her shoulders.
Ron had muttered angrily the entire trip back and was now sitting at the opposite end of the table to Hermione, glaring fiercely at the bundle of orange fur held tightly in her arms.
“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it, though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.”
She was awoken not long after by Hermione’s shrill shout of Harry’s name. Sarah fell off her bed and groggily grabbed her wand, getting to her feet only to realise that they weren’t in any trouble, Harry had just had another vision.
“You can be not okay without understanding why,” Harry said softly. “It’s important to know the reasons behind the feelings.”
“Heard what?” Harry said, glancing at Hermione, who was still currently engaged in her conversation with Percy.
Sarah felt her face pale as the Gryffindor team looked at her and Draco. She caught Harry’s shocked green eyes and shook her head quickly.
“He did it, he did it!” Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. “You saw what he wrote on the wall! He found – in my office – he knows I’m a – I’m a – “ Filch’s face worked horribly. “He knows I’m a Squib!” he finished.
Harry sighed in obvious relief and leant forward to kiss Draco, the other boy reciprocating enthusiastically. When it deepened Sarah threw a handful of grass at them.
They all turned to face Ron, who looked up from where he was speaking with Rose and shrugged apologetically.
The group made their way to dinner, where Jack Sloper, one of the Gryffindor Beaters from the previous year, handed Harry a tightly rolled scroll.
“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavour,” said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.
He never got to finish his sentence because Sarah had straightened, snarled harshly, and whipped her hand across his cheek. A loud
Conversation quickly turned toward what everyone was planning on doing for the rest of the holidays. The twins kept suspiciously quiet about their plans and Fred just smirked when Sarah poked him inquisitively. Sirius came to check up on them at one point, claiming he was bored because Remus was too busy being a responsible adult with Bill to pay him any attention.
Draco choked on a suppressed laugh and turned away before the Transfiguration Professor could notice.
The elf froze beneath Harry and the boy climbed off him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes. Sarah and Ron were gaping at the scene as Draco joined Harry at his side.
Before they separated – the Gryffindors to Herbology and the Slytherins to History of Magic – Sarah healed and cleaned Harry’s cut.
Before Sarah could snap back that Lockhart was a fraud and destined to ruin their education, Professor McGonagall stalked into the room.
He smiled weakly at her and took another meagre bite of his food. Sirius looked up at them with his large, dark eyes and Sarah sighed, placing a gently hand on his soft head.
Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly, was sitting in the corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled
“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognise that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.”
She paused, looked sideways at Harry, and went on, “And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just theory but the real spells – “
Sarah couldn’t decide who was more annoying: Cormac McLaggen or Lavender Brown. Both were constantly hounding Harry and consequentially, Sarah and Draco. McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticise the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain. On more than one occasion, Draco had to calm Harry down so that the other boy didn’t punch McLaggen.
“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.”
“Oh, that would be wonderful!” the younger girl exclaimed. “People usually don’t want to pair up with me.”
“I’m not sure,” Hermione said cautiously. “Ron mentioned in his letter that he and his brothers were going to check him in a few days if he didn’t reply soon.”
“He mentioned to Hermione and me that Ron suggested he should just wait at the end of Potions one day.” Sarah let out a huff and Draco added, “You can imagine how well that went down…”
“That’s a horrible image, thank you, darling,” Draco grimaced. “Do you want to buy anything or should we leave?”
“I’d really prefer not to have survived all that just to be eaten by a dragon!” cried Sarah, eyeing the water with rising fear. She could now see the dragon’s wide, yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.
“All right,” he said, poking her velvet-clad thigh. “No need to wet your panties about it. It’s just a bookstore.”
“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,” said Remus. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumour that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”
“Don’t forget that Blaise’s daughter is starting as well,” Fred reminded them. “And didn’t Pansy decide to send her kids here instead of France?”
Sarah flinched back as Voldemort ran a thin finger down the side of her face, disgust coursing through her like a river.
“You could be right, Sarah,” he said. “That was a dementor – horrid creatures. They guard Azkaban. They make you relive your worst memories.”
“Everyone’s okay!” she said quickly, waving her wand around his head to check if he had a concussion. Luckily, he seemed fine, just exhausted. “Madam Pomfrey is looking after Ron and Hermione but everyone else is fine.”
“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs Weasley’s back was turned he pocketed it with a wink.
“Bloody fucking wanker,” Sarah muttered as she quickly packed up her stuff and practically ran out of the library. The meeting was in his office all in the way in the dungeons meaning that Sarah had to sprint down four floors to get there in time.
Sarah tuned out the rest of the conversation and let her eyes wander lazily around the large Ministry ballroom. Familiar faces popped out from the various tables: Parvati Patil and her new husband, Dean Thomas with his arm slung around Seamus Finnigan, Pansy on the arm of a Russian supermodel Sarah couldn’t recall the name of, Daphne and Theo looking as exhausted as Sarah felt (they had had their first child only a month ago), and Sirius and Remus, both grinning broadly at something Kingsley was saying a few tables over.
Harry sagged in relief and continued walking, Sarah following behind him, a contemplative look on her face.
Potter nodded with a large grin and Draco watched in amazement as the wall opened up, not dissimilar to Diagon Alley’s entrance, to reveal an entirely new room.
Remus nodded. “You’ve done a good job,” he praised. “But now, we all have to be getting back to the Burrow – Molly wants you all there for dinner.”
“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them
“Well you would have if you hadn’t immediately disappeared upstairs with your boyfriend,” countered Sirius, one dark eyebrow rising.
Sarah knew that Harry felt responsible: it was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that they could question him. She caught Harry apologising to Fleur in the kitchen one night as they prepared dinner in late April.
Mrs Weasley looked over her shoulder from where she was standing in front of the stove, waving her wand and stirring multiple sauces at once.
Professors Snape, McGonagall and Dumbledore had descended and were striding toward the Slytherin table. Heads turned as they passed and eventually stopped right in front of their group.
“Draco! Harry!” Sarah cried, wrenching herself from Hermione’s bed and scrambling through the growing crowd on the stairs.
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene but Sarah couldn’t find it within herself to be relieved. Judging by the other’s faces, neither could they.
The other three sat down in the chairs around the table and tried to continue their homework. Harry was sitting with his head in his hands, looking very green.
Percy stiffly let his mother fuss around him as his brothers and father glared at him. Remus was watching with a neutral expression on his face, his hand resting on Sirius’ arm as the other man tried to look around the back door after Harry and Scrimgeour.
Sarah shared a look with Harry and he shrugged. Helpful, that one. She turned back to her daughter and smoothed the stray curls away from her face.
“Oh, yes, I see,” said Travers. “Yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands require a little breaking in, don’t you?”
“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, bowing again, and continuing in an undertone, “Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother’s heart – “
“Oh, yes, I’m okay. Thank you for asking,” Luna said with a misty smile. “Even though I don’t like the fact that you and Lyra are forced down here occasionally, I’m glad to have the company.”
“But you’re behind – very behind – on dealing with curses,” said Moody. “So I’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other. I’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark – “
“Deaumont! Malfoy! Quidditch pitch in fifteen minutes! We’re having a practice!” He stormed out of the room as quickly as he had entered.
“And you’re looking particularly run-down for someone who’s been having food and shelter provided for them,” drawled Draco, stepping up to embrace the other Slytherins. “I’d like to see how you look after living in a tent most of the year.”
Draco burst into the drawing room to see Lyra convulsing on the floor, Bellatrix standing over her, wand raised.
Sarah drew Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl and spin: a hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider and wider, finally forming an archway on to the narrow, cobbled street that was Diagon Alley. Sarah settled a sneer on her face and sauntered forward.
His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own, Draco’s following with a slight smirk. Sarah just stared at Ron is disgust and didn’t bother raising her own, Harry knew she was on board.
A short way farther on, they saw two tiny little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls’ toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past the five of them he muttered distractedly, “In broad daylight! Parents having a lie-in, I suppose – “
“But isn’t he just the cutest when he screams ‘COCO!’ and his hair turns blond?” she pointed out. “Even your cold heart would melt at that.”
He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet, and theirs was still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.
Sarah, it’ll suffocate him!” screamed Ginny, immobilised by her injured ankle on the floor – then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater’s wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious.
She pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the Death Eaters ahead of him and close in on wherever Draco and Harry could be. Remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase, she burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pyjama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.
“I’m guessing your father told her about the Toffee,” Sarah muttered to the twins as they ducked the starch projectiles.
Harry had to take a moment to process the questions. When he did, he grinned and said, “It’s Wednesday, Ron. Teddy’s at school. I have to pick him up in an hour but I can drop by the Leaky afterward?”
Draco laughed loudly and the pair joined the others in front of Hagrid’s door. The large man was looking down at Ron in slight confusion but he seemed unperturbed by the boy spewing slugs over the threshold.
Draco nodded quickly. “I was worried that Kreacher had taken Sirius’ order literally and had left Grimmauld Place and gone to the Manor. Because, as you know, only myself or my mother could officially give him orders.”
“Any updates on the – er – object?” asked a portly wizard, hesitating slightly with a glance at the teenagers.
“You’ve got to listen to me,” Black said, and there was a note of urgency in his voice now. “You’ll regret it if you don’t…You don’t understand…”
Blaise shrugged and said, “I never know whether she’s trying to set a record or if her husbands just have abysmal luck.”
“Why were you on that corridor in particular, though?” Snape continued to question, his eyes darting to Sarah. “It is not the most direct route, especially if you intended to get warm as soon as possible.”
“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry demanded, glaring at Ginny as Lyra firmly said,  “We’re not together.”
Draco quickly grabbed his hand. “Wait, we have to be careful,” he said. He glanced around at the others. “And we have to stick together. No one knows what goes on in the Department of Mysteries except for the Unspeakables. We have to be prepared for anything.”
“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s that real thing – the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.”
Sarah stood and gave a sarcastic wave over her shoulder as she left the room. She decided to go to the Slytherin common room to see Blaise, Pansy and the others. She had been avoiding it ever since the article had come out and threats were hissed her way.
“Follow after us,” Sarah said before running at the barrier with Draco, emerging onto the crowded wizarding platform. They shot past Mr and Mrs Weasley and began hauling their trunks onto the train. Fred and George appeared briefly to help them before disappearing into the carriages.
“Oh, I know,” Lyra said, shuddering. “He’s demanded I use it so that we can prove we’re civil to each other. Granger even asked that I call her Hermione.”
As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers from the Slytherins in the crowd but boos could be heard from the other houses. Sarah saw the Gryffindor team arrive opposite them to loud cheers from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, and a small part of her was sad that Slytherin didn’t get as much support due to their reputation.
“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It says we’re supposed to puncture them with something sharp…”
“Don’t forget that Mrs Jones is coming back today with her bulldog,” Rosie called as Draco went to go fetch his lab coat.
“Faster,” Draco moaned, trying to pull Harry’s body closer to his own. Harry obeyed him and increased his pace. His face dropped down to Draco’s chest and bit and licked at the skin there. Draco knew that he would be covered in small marks come morning and vowed to wear his highest turtleneck sweater.
The little colour remaining in Sirius’ face drained from it. He looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. Remus’ steady hand around his wrist may have helped. “I know it’s hard, but we’ve all got to act as though we don’t know anything yet. We’ve got to stay put, as least until we hear from your mother, all right?”
Sarah whistled. “Damn, Harry, you might actually be able to improve your skills this year,” she said, glancing at the dark-haired boy.
Fred, still looking slightly suspicious, leant down and kissed Sarah quickly. Harry laughed as she stuck her middle finger up at Sirius’ snickers.
To make matters worse, Crabbe had somehow enlisted the help of some nasty older Slytherins to help make him badges that flashed POTTER STINKS whenever pressed. The majority of the school wore one, pressing it gleefully whenever Harry or Sarah or Draco walked past.
“Er – yes, actually,” Potter said hesitatingly. “Why a muggle clinic? No one’s heard from you for seven years and now you suddenly turn up here?”
“I’m so glad you’re here!” Sarah babbled. “I’ve been meaning to try to send you another message because I’ve missed and even though Harry is excellent company I wanted to see you – how’s your mother? Has my father been annoying you much? Will you stay for dinner here? Or can you stay the night?”
Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed. Ron and Hermione joined them a few moments later and the four of them slowly walked further away down the damaged corridors.
Sarah couldn’t believe her eyes when the giant was suddenly pulled back from the doorway to reveal the lumpy feet of Grawp, wrestled with the larger giant until they were much farther down the lawn, away from the castle.
“If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!” he said fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more colour, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.
Lyra turned the letter over curiously and blanched when she saw her mother’s handwriting. It wasn’t as if she wasn’t in contact with her mother, but it was unusual to get such a large letter; Lyra couldn’t help but be cautious.
“Okay, you lot. Up to bed now,” Mrs Weasley said, ushering them up to their rooms to collapse in the sweet oblivion of sleep.
Her, Theo, Pansy, Blaise, Draco and Lyra were all spread across the various beds in the Sixth-Year boys' dormitory. Millicent was smirking profoundly at them from her position on Crabbe’s bed.
“Well,” Sarah said carefully, “I guess we can tell you that Mr Weasley was injured, which was why we left so suddenly, and we stayed with them the rest of the holidays.”
“Grawp,” Sarah gasped, holding her shaking, blood-drenched hands in front of her. “Centaurs took Umbridge and Grawp attacked the centaurs.” She turned to see the other six looking at them in shock. “Can we
“Well, I was in Hogsmeade for business a while back and I bumped into him,” Fred explained, informing Sarah’s smouldering eyes.
did you call us?” shouted a wild-looking black centaur, whom Sarah recognised as Bane. There was a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstrings around them.
“And keeping stupid brothers from being insensitive gits,” Ginny huffed. “Also, be careful if you go check on Harry and Draco, it’s been suspiciously quiet up there.”
“You’re amazing, have I told you that recently,” Fred said, flying to the ground to let Sarah clamber on the back of his broom.
He dropped her onto the couch next to the fire and sank into the cushion beside her, letting out a groan of relief.
“Actually, on second thought, I wouldn’t want to be versing Harry on that,” Draco said, frowning slightly at the gleaming broom.
“It was extremely enjoyable, yes,” he said, taking the seat beside Sarah. “You have no idea the things Harry can do with his – “
“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice from above, and Sarah’s head was pulled back by her hair. A beam of wandlight fell onto her face and Greyback laughed.
Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart. Bellatrix’s gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.
Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid’s weight, was rescued by Sarah and Draco, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.
“It’s too late now for us to do anything,” said Sarah. “We just have to accept it and move on, okay?”
She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house. Sarah wrinkled her nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that they were beside her, Sarah noted how tiny she was; bowed down with age, she came barely up to Harry and Draco’s chests. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry’s face. Her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. Sarah wondered whether she could make out Harry at all; even if she could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.
“Is it my imagination,” shouted Draco, after a considerable stretch of silence, “or are we losing height?”
Draco smiled softly at him. “It was meant to be an opportunity to escape and explore for a while,” he corrected. “But I don’t want to do that without you.” He paused and added quietly, “Unless you don’t want to go?”
Sarah glanced back up to the stands where Draco, Hermione and Ginny were standing, staring at her in complete shock. She sent them a little wave.
“Out of the way,” he snarled, roughly pushing past Sarah, causing her to stumble into Harry to stay upright.
“You mean it?” he asked in delight. He dropped another kiss to her lips and Sarah pulled back quickly.
“I understand why you brought me up here,” Sarah said as she collapsed on Hermione’s bed, “but why Draco?”
“And just look at these books!” said Hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the large, leather-bound tomes. “Wow…”
“I know that,” Harry snapped, causing Draco to reel back slightly, a hurt expression on his face. Harry sagged slightly. “I’m sorry. I’m just tired and sore.”
“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Sarah saw the ghostly white shape of an albino peacock above her and worried for a split second that it would recognise her or Draco; the horrid creatures had always had a vendetta against them.
“Let’s go have that fun conversation,” he said, with as much enthusiasm as one walking to the gallows.
“It would be if you actually made the effort to start said relationship,” she replied reasonably. “I don’t want to hear any more about this until you figure yourselves out. Now leave me alone, I have an Arithmancy essay due tomorrow and I’m not done yet.”
Harry hadn’t even paused to look. He had kept flying and snatched up the small, struggling Snitch. The stands exploded with cheers. Professor Lupin was applauding madly beside her and Hermione and Draco were jumping up and down, hugging each other. Sarah grabbed Draco’s arm and dragged him down to the pitch where Harry and his team were still hovering midair, hugging and crying.
“Hufflepuff will have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said George, ignoring Sarah except for a playful ruffle of her hair.
“Yeah, they’re great!” said Harry as he helped Draco bring the tea over to the table. “Er – how are the flobberworms?”
The morning of the Ravenclaw and Slytherin Quidditch game dawned cloudy with a hint of rain. Sarah got good luck hugs from Harry and Hermione, and she couldn’t help but notice that Harry’s eyes followed Draco sadly.
“Tell me if you need me to stop,” panted Harry as he began to prepare Draco. A single bead of sweat was making its way down his forehead and Draco reared up, licking it clean before pressing his lips to Harry’s jaw and sucking hard. Harry’s fingers stuttered in their movements before resuming at twice the pace. Within minutes, Draco was arching against Harry, begging with both his words and movements for Harry to enter him.
“Blaise, your dramatics are putting me off my breakfast,” Pansy said loudly, cutting into their conversation. “And where is Draco? I need to go over my Charms notes with him.”
“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Professor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the students. Sarah was sure she could hear Blaise’s obnoxious whistle amidst the noise.
She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation; it was like a malediction, and Sarah wasn’t surprised that Ron retreated several steps.
. Sarah and Draco broke away from where Fred and George had started juggling bottles and went over to her. Harry was sitting on one end of the couch and moved over to give them room to sit. Sarah made sure that Draco was pressed tightly up against Harry’s side and ignored the elbow he jabbed into her ribs.
. This little pile of a human sitting in Sarah’s lap was so dependable on her and Sarah hadn’t known she could love something quite as much as she loved her children.
“Forget it, it’s not important,” Draco dismissed, pulling out his textbooks. “We need to get started on that Charms essay.”
A few minutes later, she burst through the portrait hole and into the Gryffindor common room. Ron was just leaving.
“Okay,” Sarah whispered. “Don’t forget the revealing spell your Mother taught us for the Manor’s books. I don’t want anything giving us away.”
“Hermione, we know,” said Ron sternly. “And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?”
!” Draco spluttered, spinning to face her. She was sitting with a very smug expression on her face. “He’s a customer, Pansy. It would be completely inappropriate.”
Ron apologised to Sarah and Draco for his thoughtless words and they began discussing what Professor Binns had said.
that after what you’ve just been through? Do you want to come back to mine or do you need to be at home right now? I can get Molly to look after Teddy…”
“At least I know how to fix myself back up,” Sarah remarked, cowering slightly at Professor McGonagall’s glare. “Right away, ma’am.”
“What are you two scheming about?” Theo asked, coming up beside them with a bag of sweets. Draco and Pansy were paying for their enormous piles of chocolates.
Hermione scoffed. “Of course he did. As if Slughorn will just hand him over the memory. It’s obviously something he wants to deny or forget, judging on how he tried to alter it.”
She leapt forward and grabbed a handful of Floo powder, throwing it into the fire and calling out her destination. The last thing she saw as she stepped into the green fire was the hateful face of Antonius Deaumont, teeth bared in outrage as she whirled away into nothingness.
She sucked in a deep breath to shout the incantation when the boggart shifted once more – and Sarah’s father appeared, wand raised.
! And if it hadn’t hit him it would have hit Crabbe. What if Snape hadn’t been nearby? What would you have done?”
“Sorry to break up your lovefest,” he said in a voice that showed he definitely wasn’t sorry, “but Sarah’s been calling for your arses for the past ten minutes. I think she’s going to storm up here soon and drag you downstairs.”
Nobody answered, but Sarah knew they were all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident two days before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.
“Please: we need some help. We need to know anything you can tell us about the lost diadem,” Draco beseeched her.
“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this enchantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practice. May I emphasise that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of the Hall, and that you would be unwise to try. I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet space in front of you.”
“It’s extremely unprofessional!” Draco exclaimed. “I should have just told him to contact reception and – “
“Prague?” Draco asked in a blandly polite voice. The hand behind his back was motioning for Lyra and the others to leave but she refused to move, despite Pansy’s insistent tugging on her arm. “I’ve heard it’s lovely this time of year.”
“Range of sweets to make you ill,” Fred whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. George and I have been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, colour coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half – “
Sarah groaned and rolled off the couch, getting her feet under her at the last second. She sulked towards the open bathroom door where Draco was tugging his work uniform over his head.
Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor Umbridge addressed the class once more.
“I think Hermione’s right,” he went on. “The mark is important and we need to know why. Besides,” he added with a small smile, “it’s just Luna.”
“We wanted to ask if you could teach us how to repel dementors,” Sarah said evenly. “We saw you do it on the train and again during the match.”
The round-face Gryffindor boy was holding what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot, except it was covered in what looked like boils rather than spines.
“Cecelia Francois,” Sarah said, putting on a slight French accent. It was the name of one of her very distant cousins.
“Come on, Harry,” Weasley snapped. “I don’t even know why you bother to talk to her.” He grabbed Potter’s arm and tried to pull him toward the Great Hall but Potter resisted, tugging on his arm until Weasley released it with a confused look.
Draco shouted back something that Sarah couldn’t hear before dropping into motion. The four of them, plus Ron, Charlie, Hermione and Bill had descended into a ruthless makeshift game of Quidditch in the backyard of Sarah’s Manor.
“You can do sit with him, Draco,” Hermione suddenly said. “Don’t feel as if you need to keep me company.”
Draco groaned pitifully. “It’s the horrid Umbridge woman,” he said. “She’s Senior Undersecretary to Fudge, remember? Father used to deal with her whenever he had business with Fudge.”
Sarah had hobbled over to his bed, her muscles still spasming every so often as an effect of the Cruciatus Curse.
“Harry!” Aleksander cried, ruffling Harry’s wet curls. “I’m glad you’re all alright, Sarah was nearly losing her mind with worry.”
Lyra turned accusatory eyes on her husband, who shrugged unapologetically. She had not been impressed when her children had begun asking if they too could ride a dragon like Uncle Harry, Uncle Ron and Aunt ‘Mione.
Kreacher straightened and peered at her but said in a low voice, “No, no one has accessed the House of Black after your filth lived in it.” Sarah coughed pointedly and Kreacher glared at her. “It has been empty since you left.”
Harry’s knee bounced up and down repeatedly as he sat on the couch waiting impatiently for Lyra and Draco to come downstairs so they could all leave for the Burrow. He had managed to convince Molly to have only a small gathering for dinner; all Harry really wanted to do was sit in his newly renovated sitting room and drink copious amounts of firewhiskey while trying to deny the fact that he was currently
“Captains shake hands,” ordered the umpire, Madam Hooch, as Angelina and Warrington reached each other. Sarah could tell that Warrington was trying to crush Angelina’s fingers, though she did not wince. “Mount your brooms…”
“You should be fully healed in a few days,” Sarah assured George. “You’ll be back to your handsome self in time for the wedding.”
They had never had a practical Defense lesson – the pixies debacle with Lockhart couldn’t count. Hesitantly, they back up their bags and waited for more instructions.
Draco looked around the dormitory, nose scrunching as he took him the unmade beds and clothing littering the floor.
“You know,” he muttered angrily. “For once in my life, I’d like it if people actually told me things.”
“And let’s not get into that,” Sarah said, interrupting Fred as he opened his mouth with a mischievous gleam in his eyes. “Do you think you’ll be able to get in?”
As the days stretched into weeks, Harry mentioned to Sarah that he thought Hermione and Ron were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he had accidentally come upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realised he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. Sarah had told him to try not to worry about it and assured him that she would keep an eye out.
“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with an incredulous laugh. “Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would’ve been great about it. And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.”
She smiled as her team clapped her on her good shoulder and began to disappear into the locker rooms.
“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.”
Sarah laughed. “He’d never kill you, he likes you too much,” she stated. “He would, however, make you sleep alone for a few months until you came begging for his forgiveness.”
“Mate, you better never scare me like that again,” Millicent warned Sarah as she bit a chocolate frog’s head off. “If you do, I’ll make sure petrification is the least of your worries.”
Bill and Charlie burst into raucous laughter and ruffled her hair one more time despite her grumbling protests.
Sarah was just thinking that all they needed was for Dumbledore’s pet bird to die while they were alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.
“Ron, please shut up,” Sarah said desperately in a hushed voice. “Draco and I should really be leaving. We shouldn’t be here – “
“I have!” she said distractedly, rummaging around for Harry’s wand. It had fallen onto the floor when he fell out of bed. “I bumped into Neville last night and he told me that Gillyweed will let you breathe underwater. I got Dobby to get me some. You have to eat it before you go into the water.”
“I’m not too bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at their reaction. “Charlie, Fred and George always made me Keep for them when they were training during the holidays.”
“I’ve always wanted to see Norway,” Lyra said. “Maybe we should go around Europe. We could even go to America. And Canada sounds lovely.”
Harry nodded sheepishly and Sarah burst into quiet giggles, turning around to bury her head in Draco’s chest to muffle the sound.
“Please tell me you have the antidote with you,” begged Fred. George was holding Alicia around the waist to keep her on her broom.
Draco chose to ignore the comment about Blaise and instead turned to the two unapologetic girls, his eyes wide in disbelief.
“’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.”
She waved Draco on when the blond paused and waited until everyone had left the room before heading to Professor Lupin’s desk.
Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the five of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Sarah realised their mistake just in time: she launched herself sideways, shoving Draco and Harry out of harm’s way, Ron doing the same for Hermione, as Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent Horn.
Draco also bought a pair and Harry bought three for himself, Hermione and Ron, who went red with embarrassment. Ron always had an issue when it came to money, considering how the Weasleys were quite poor.
Sarah and her father had been fighting nonstop since her return from Hogwarts. Antonius was set on erasing her “diabolical behaviours which have poisoned the Deaumont name” by cutting her off from her friends and lecturing her on the expectations of a “proper pure-blood”.
And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a suddenly sharp voice, “Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.”
“This is ridiculous,” Sarah said loudly, crossing her arms over her chest. When no one responded she cleared her throat and said even louder, “This is ridiculous!”
As she was turning a corner that would lead to the marble staircase, a body suddenly appeared before her and she came to a quick halt. Zacharias Smith’s sneering face looked down at her.
She caught Draco’s eye over Harry’s shoulder and knew that the blond could immediately tell something was wrong.
“No worries,” Ron said waving a hand. He pulled a shirt over his head and leant against his tiny desk. “Not to sound rude, but why are you in here?”
But nobody had as much to do as Sarah, Draco and Hermione. Sarah and Draco had now completely stopped going to Gryffindor Tower, instead sequestering themselves in the Slytherin common room where they knew they would be able to work without distractions. Pansy, Theo, Millicent and Blaise studied with them but always gave them lots of space. When they couldn’t deal with the extra people in the common room, they would move to the library and meet up with Hermione, who usually needed to get away from Harry and Ron.
“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to give it a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the
Sarah slowly descended down the stairs, her mind whirring. What was Voldemort so happy about? Why was Snape being so harsh with his training? Why wasn’t Dumbledore training Harry?
Draco chuckled at her retreating back but dutifully put away the report he had been working on. He had originally come into work to avoid his mother harassing him about marriage again but reluctantly accepted that he needed to relax after the last hectic few weeks. Just as he was locking up, his phone buzzed and he rolled his eyes when he read Rosie’s message:
Draco felt himself flush as Harry chuckled lowly next to his ear. Hermione, who had overheard the conversation, sent Draco a warm, knowing smile and raised her glass slightly to him.
“Thank you,” Sarah breathed. “I wouldn’t know what to do without you. Who would help me babysit Sirius?”
He shrugged one shoulder. “It was pretty expected but at least now I know. It means I can try to avoid that particular curse in the future.”
choose him first. So, while I may offer the suggestion to give Draco the benefit of the doubt, it does
“Blooming, lad, blooming!” Bagman beamed. “I hear your father’s around, Miss Deaumont. Have you seen him?”
“Harry, drink this, drink it!” she said urgently and she threw towel upon towel on him. His face and arms were covered in thin scratches and he was breathing heavily, coughing up large amounts of water.
“Language, Draco,” Narcissa admonished weakly. Her pale eyes reflected the sky and were pinched around the corners with worry. “Sarah – that’s – I cannot believe Antonius would…”
They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached their group first.
“That’s not necessary,” Harry said uselessly, trying to cover Draco’s mouth as he launched into a gleeful explanation.
“Is all your family going to be amazed that we have actual human emotions, Weasley?” Lyra asked when she had calmed down slightly.
“We weren’t the sole witnesses,” snarled Harry. “There was a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?”
“If you’re sure…” Hermione said reluctantly. “I will willingly make any excuse if you need to get out of there.”
Sarah eagerly jumped into a conversation about Healing with Aleksander as the others continued to chat around them.
“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It’s still raining in there.”
“That’s what you were meant to help me with,” she drawled. “Why else would I bare all my brother’s and my misgivings?”
Sarah and Draco exchanged concerned glances. Draco moved to sit beside Harry, grasping his boyfriend’s hands in his own.
“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.”
Ron perked up, having an excuse to interrupt Draco’s rant. “Somewhere over there,” he said, pointing along the shelves. “Looking for another book. I think she’s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.”
“Not like I could even pick anyone up,” George said grouchily. “Half the people there are my relatives.”
“Off you three go, I shall see you at dinner,” the professor said, ushering Harry, Sarah and Leanne out of the ward.
“Put a Bludger through his head and I’ll be eternally grateful,” she groaned, sitting up against Fred as Madam Pomfrey rushed over.
“Oh, it’s you two, is it?” said Madam Pomfrey, looking as if she was struggling not to her roll her eyes in exasperation. She ignored Harry’s words and bent down to stare closely at them both. “I suppose you’ve been doing something dangerous again?”
“Aw, shame,” Theo said emotionlessly. “Maybe now I’ll finally be able to sleep without hearing you two going at it every night for hours.”
“…but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the Quaffle from her, I can’t remember his name, it’s something like Bibble – no, Buggins – “
“Maybe, Hermione,” George said dismissively. He turned to Sarah and said, “D’you reckon Remus will let Fred and I join the Order?”
, I have. Don’t laugh, all right?” Ron said defensively, turning redder with every second. “I-I thought I’d try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on. Laugh.”
“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girl’s dormitory.
“Draco, Sarah,” Mr Weasley said once the shabby tents were set up, “Narcissa said that if you wanted to stay with her tonight in her tent you were more than welcome – she sent an owl last night.”
Half-buried in rubble, Sarah tried to raise herself; she could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in and the end of Luna’s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside her with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by and Harry, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed his finger to his lips. He leant down and helped Sarah out from the rubble as quietly as he could. The other three were huddled nearby, each as dirty as the other.
In the far corner, Sirius was passionately reciting one of the adventures he and the other Marauders had gone on during their schools years as Mr Weasley, Fred, Bill and Fleur watched on in glee, Remus shaking his head every so often and correcting Sirius when the details became slightly too exaggerated.
The Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another’s minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Fred’s chest kept squeaking their names. Within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.
“Hermione – Sarah – you’re not supposed to be in here – “ said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.
“And what about you, Sarah?” Millicent asked. Sarah was surprised that the girl was talking to her again. “Will you stay safe?”
Draco refused to relinquish his grip on Sarah until Bellatrix pressed harder against Hermione’s throat. It was only then that he allowed Sarah to be passed to his mother. Narcissa held her gently as the boys stood in a tight group, Greyback’s wand aimed at them.
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry. He was staring angrily around the group. “What makes me say You-Know-Who’s back?” he asked, looking Zacharias straight in the face. “I saw him. And so did Sarah. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn’t believe him, you don’t believe me, and I’m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.”
More than once, Sarah nearly got detention or lost House points for defending Harry against the horrid students. Harry tried to tell her it wasn’t worth it but she would just shut him up with a look.
“You need to go downstairs down,” Hermione whispered, her brown eyes wide and worried. Immediately, Sarah sat up straighter and began pulling on the dressing gown Hermione handed her.
“Good to know you two have such a healthy and loving relationship,” Blaise said dryly, scowling slightly as Draco stole one of his bruschetta pieces.
Sarah flung herself into the waiting compartment, narrowly missing whacking Blaise over the head with her floating trunk.
Sarah was thrown backwards into the wall. All the breath knocked from her lungs and she slid to the ground, clasping at her chest and wheezing.
“Don’t worry boys,” Sarah said. “At least you still have Harry and I. We haven’t been taken over to the dark side.”
“Talk about the leech…” Sarah muttered, leaning her head backwards to look at the door of the compartment upside down. Lavender was standing in front of it mouthing something at Ron. From her angle, Sarah couldn’t decipher what the other girl was saying. Lavender than breathed on the glass and traced a heart with her and Ron’s initials inside it before kissing the glass and walking away.
“Harry! You shouldn’t speak of him that way!” she cried. “Maybe Kreacher is feeling that way because he’s a
Sarah swatted his arm. “You can’t live for your mother or me! If you and George think that leaving soon will be the best for you, then do it. I can help soothe your mother.”
“Good man – goblin, I should say,” amended Ted hastily. “Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of those old high-security vaults, I suppose?”
“ – and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry – you’ll still have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear!”
“God, this place is going to the dogs,” said Crabbe loudly. “That oaf teaching classes, my father’ll have a fit when I tell him – “
“That was years ago, Draco!” Rosie exclaimed. “He’s obviously gotten over whatever pissing fight you had or else he wouldn’t have let you treat his cat.” She leant forward and placed a small hand on Draco’s arm. “I’m just saying give it a shot,” she continued softly. “If he’s not interested, then fine, you’ll move on. And if he is…well – ” she smiled brightly, “I think he’d be good for you.”
a witch, however, it was odd behaviour to come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she ought not to have been able to see Sarah, Draco, Hermione and Harry at all. Sarah had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as she had reached this uneasy conclusion, the woman raised a gloved hand and beckoned.
Fred, Harry, and George all stomped off, shaking with rage. Madam Hooch turned back to Sarah and her eyes softened somewhat. “Miss Deaumont, I recommend heading up to the hospital wing. I’ll deal with Mr Warrington.”
Draco stiffened slightly beside Harry but kept eating as if nothing was wrong. Sarah sat down beside him and squeezed his knee gently.
She leant back in her desk chair and calmly observed him, gesturing that he should sit in one of the hardbacked chairs in front of her desk.
“No problem at all, Mr Weasley. We are grateful for your family’s kind hospitality,” Draco replied smoothly.
Crabbe, who had joined on this year as a Beater alongside Goyle, to Sarah’s great annoyance, scoffed loudly. “Are you sure you’re not sleeping with the Weasel
After breakfast, Sarah dragged Harry and Draco away into the living room, shouting over her shoulder that they had some things they needed to do at her Manor and would be back tomorrow morning. She then shoved them through the Floo and they disappeared in a whirl of ash and smoke.
Clutching their purchases, Mr Weasley led them through the dark woods, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious. Sarah caught Draco and Harry trying desperately to contain large grins that kept breaking out across their faces. The stadium itself was completely gold and towered above them into the black sky.
“Ah, yes, that,” Narcissa said, setting down her teacup and clasping her hands in her lap. She peered intently at them all, Draco and Sarah in particular. “Once my house arrest is over I will be moving to one of our properties in France.”
Whenever Sarah caught sight of one of these, she would beam excitedly. Umbridge had just ensured that every single person in the school would read the interview by banning it. She was right. By the end of the say, the whole school seemed to be quoting the interview at each other, whispering about Harry’s fight with Voldemort.
Sarah wrenched her attention away from the stairs and looked down at her arm and saw, to her horror, that she had pushed up her sleeves, revealing the scars left by Bellatrix.
Mr Crouch stepped forward into the silence and told the champions that the first task would take place on the twenty-fourth of November and that they would only be armed with their wands. They would also be exempt from their end-of-year tests.
“I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here,” said Sarah. “You were ordering him out of the kitchen.”
An older woman stepped up beside Draco and said, “It’s nice to finally meet you, Draco. Your mother sent me a picture once, many years ago. You have grown into a handsome young man.”
Not everyone was enjoying the party, however. Lavender was standing in a corner with Parvati, glaring at Ron with red eyes. He had finally grown a pair and broken up with her. Sarah hadn’t been able to stop laughing every time she saw Ron get flustered by the angry girl. Hermione was now significantly friendlier toward the redhead now.
“Try not to question that too much,” Theo muttered in her ear, guessing where her mind had gone. “They were absolutely horrible this summer.”
“Sarah, your father still has many ties within the Ministry,” Snape cautioned. “He will not hesitate to use them if necessary.”
“Why don’t the others like Draco?” Teddy asked, glancing up at them all. “Grandma said that his dad wasn’t a very nice man but that didn’t mean that Draco wasn’t nice. And Cissy is nice. She bought me ice cream last time we went out with Grandma.”
“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don’t need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they’re all trapped inside their own head, incapable of a single cheerful thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.”
“What happened?” Ron asked them. “Sarah’s refused to say anything but she’s been muttering under her breath. She’s freaking me out.”
It was in the way that Draco’s smirk was softer when he said, “Morning, Harry,” and the way that he would wordlessly hand Harry a cup of perfectly-made tea when they were both relaxing in their room. It was in the small corrections offered in Potions class, the bright laughter that came whenever Harry did something stupid or said something funny.
Sarah raised her eyebrows but nodded slowly. “Okay…So, I think the question ‘how are you?’ was just answered.”
Much too soon, Hagrid whistled for Buckbeak and the hippogriff obediently began to circle back to earth.
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago – the precise date is uncertain – by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much prosecution.”
The four of them broke out laughing but soon returned back to studying. Exams were the week before Christmas break and Draco was determined to get perfect marks. And then came the next issue…
The whistle sounded, Sarah and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground and they were away.
“We did everything,” Draco whispered back. “They shouldn’t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.”
Sarah and Hermione refused to speak to Ron over the next few days. Sarah was furious at him for what he said before abandoning them and didn’t hesitate to constantly scoff or make scathing comments whenever he said something positive about destroying a Horcrux. But mainly, Sarah was angry on behalf of Hermione. The two girls spent most of the following days together, Hermione ranting and fuming about Ron and his audacity to come back acting like he never left. Sarah knew that Hermione was still incredibly heartbroken by his actions and wasn’t ready to forgive him any time soon. The only time Harry had approached Sarah pleading for her to be nice to Ron, Sarah had shouted herself hoarse about how Sarah had spent
“Erm…” she said. Both Sirius and Remus’s eyes were locked onto hers and she couldn’t find it in herself to lie. “They’re from your dear cousin, Sirius. We ran into her at Malfoy Manor.”
Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.
Despite her best efforts, Sarah just couldn’t play to her usual level. Her arm was throbbing and causing the edges of her vision to blur whenever she caught the Quaffle one-handed. Adrian Pucey helped her as much as he could, appearing beside her so she could deposit the Quaffle into his hands.
name has only be mentioned once and in passing, else she would be in the same position. Now, if you let me write the story from that angle – “
“The less you know, Pans, the better,” Sarah said. “Okay, boys, I’m sick of Draco’s nagging – let’s go.”
“You’ve grown on me,” George conceded. He opened his mouth to say something else but was interrupted by the arrival of Verity. The energetic blond practically bounced over to them, kissing them both on the cheeks with a flourish.
Once more the wall spun and became still again. Harry approached a door at random and pushed. It did not move.
“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of
She was falling down steep stone steps, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of her body, she landed flat on her back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. For a moment, she could only groan and blink away stars. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eater’s laughter and Harry’s worried shouts.
Sarah nodded and turned back to her own breakfast but Harry couldn’t help but notice that she still wasn’t her usual self.
There was some scattered, unenthusiastic applause. Only those who had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped hard, Sarah and Draco among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes.
Hermione released her and took a step back, reaching to gather her hair in a messy bun that barely contained her adventurous curls.
Her father had refused her from visiting Malfoy Manor and Draco had been beside himself with worry when he hadn’t received a letter from Sarah for more than a week into the holidays. Sarah knew that her father would have stolen any letters she attempted to send, so she had waited until her father was away at a business meeting before summoning one of the Malfoy house-elves. Tibby had been ecstatic to see Sarah and had happily promised to deliver to Draco the letter Sarah had written, which explained everything. Since then, they had been communicating through the house elves, who only popped up once Antonius was sound asleep in the master’s chambers.
“Well, yes…” Sarah said in consideration. “But remember that moment in Diagon Alley before school? Where Crabbe was in Borgin and Burkes?”
“It’s all righ’, Fang – it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, leaving Sarah, Harry and Draco alone.
