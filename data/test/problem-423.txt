“Are you sure, Harry? I don’t think you heard a word about my latest Wizengamot case,” Hermione scolded, turning from where she was cutting vegetables for the evening’s meal to give Harry a disappointed look. “It’s quite interesting, and may be important for you to know. After all, we don’t know yet if Teddy will develop any werewolf tendencies with his genetics—”
“Hi, Malfoy,” Harry returned.
“Right...” Harry glanced between his friends, noting that Ron was looking anywhere
“...Harry?” Teddy squeaked.
“Here, let me,” Harry’s fingers brushed against Malfoy’s heated skin, gently rubbing his cheek as he wiped the flour from his face.
“Teddy, did you know that you’re morphing?” Harry teased, resting his hands on the boys hips and lifting him from the training broom. “If you want to convince us to let you fly higher, morphing into Draco would probably work better if you used that
Draco’s bright eyes flickered across Harry’s face, searching, before he raised a hand and brushed sweat-damp curls from Harry’s forehead.
He was quite happy as he was, here, with Teddy and his friends. In fact, he realized, he was happy whenever he was with Teddy—at the Burrow, at Grimmauld Place, and even at Andromeda’s cottage.
“Was it upon seeing Draco heal Teddy’s bruises that you realized you were in love with him, then?”
She spluttered as she caught her breath, “Oh my
“…what?”
Ron coughed quietly, taking another deep sip of tea. Hermione narrowed her eyes, “What do you mean, he’s corrupting Teddy?”
He’s sorry.
“Whatever you say, Potter,” Malfoy’s voice called out behind him as he turned the corner, leaving Harry alone, standing in the middle of the sitting room.
“Well, where is he?” he demanded. Teddy began to squirm uncomfortably in Harry’s arms, and he slowly knelt to let him down. His godson hesitated, wringing his hands together and looking between Harry and his grandmother, as they stared at one another.
“Okay! Can I count?” Teddy asked.
…for truth…
“Well, he was kind of upset on Saturday,” Harry shrugged, looking down at the bread in his hand as he began to tear it apart, “I may have yelled at Malfoy in front of Teddy. He didn’t like that much...so I figured maybe buying the Kneazle would help smooth things over.”
in how he—
This smell…
Harry stumbled into his bathroom, tugging his t-shirt over his head before turning on his shower. Within moments, the room was filling with steam. He turned to look at his reflection in the mirror, at the angry red of his chest where the coffee had scalded him. Grasping his wand, Harry murmured a quick healing charm, relaxing at the instant relief it provided. He quickly shimmied out of his jeans and pants before stepping underneath the spray of water with a loud groan, closing his eyes as he let the hot water wash over him.
“But you fell from so high up!” Teddy whimpered, burying his head into Harry’s neck, blond curls tickling his nose.
A hand gently rested upon his shoulder, squeezing reassuringly. “So...” Ron started slowly. Harry could see him fidget, glancing quickly towards Harry before focusing back on the center of the pitch. “You and Draco. What’s going on there?”
Harry pushed himself from the table, quickly standing straight as he took a hesitant step towards Malfoy. “No! No, that’s—that’s not it, Malfoy, I swear.”

Draco gracefully began to remove his robes, revealing a simple white shirt tucked neatly into dark trousers. Harry’s gaze wandered over Draco as the man looked around the sitting room. These clothes suited Draco much more.
“Why are you calling me ‘Draco’?” You ask, hesitant—more vulnerable than you would like.
Teddy frowned, kicking at the floor as he grumbled, “I guess...but he’s taking

was being reminded once more to behave. “Of course I will, Andy!”
The fever breaks.
, Harry...” he whispered against his skin. Draco pulled back gently before thrusting back into Harry with such force that Harry screamed into the pillow. He quickly set a punishing rhythm, cock dragging across Harry’s prostate on every few strokes, sending sparks of pleasure coursing through his body. “Gods, you feel so good, Harry. So good for me.”
Potter stops, hovering above you, emerald eyes blazing as they stare into your own.
Pulling his trousers, his pants, down to his knees.
Harry paused, taken aback. There was no way Malfoy was telling the truth. Harry came to Andromeda’s cottage every Saturday afternoon to pick Teddy up and bring him to Grimmauld Place, where he would spend the remainder of the weekend while Andromeda visited his sister. He would have known if Malfoy was there, too. He would have seen him before this.
You stare down at him, at his desperate eyes. A brilliant green, begging you for something you cannot give him.
talked about it the other week.
Harry set his drink aside, leaned forward, eyes intent as he gazed across the room at Draco. He parted his lips to speak, and—
On Thursday evening, as he stood over his sink, hands pruning from the soapy water as he washed the dishes from his evening meal, Harry heard the familiar
“Exactly. No one is paying enough attention to him, so he’s getting away with
Draco stiffened beneath Harry’s fingers, looking up at him with wide eyes. “What?”
“Fuck...” A moan sounded above him. “I know you’re jealous of my flying skills, Potter, but was
As his fingers dipped downward, Harry slowed, letting them linger in the hair below his navel, pulling gently at the strands. It had been days since his last wank, weeks since his last pull. Between early mornings at the cafe this week, visits with his friends, and spending as much time as he could with Teddy, he had been too exhausted whenever he had a moment alone.
A soft cough sounded from behind him, and Harry turned his head to see Malfoy standing awkwardly at the side of the kitchen, watching Harry as he held his godson. Malfoy’s pale brows were furrowed, and he looked confused, before he straightened and offered a smile towards Andromeda.
Harry spluttered, “Are you joking? Ron, this is
Marking you.
” Harry stuttered as Draco’s tongue dove deep within him. He would not be able to last long if Draco kept this up, and he wanted more than just Draco’s mouth and tongue. Hesitantly, he whispered, “...
Harry sped after him, following the sound of Draco’s cackles on the wind as he leaned forward on his broom, pursuing Draco in earnest.
You watch it burn before you stride forward—confident, unafraid.
, scrambling to Teddy’s side as his godson cried, tears streaming down his flushed cheeks.
Draco’s gaze flickered to the mugs, and he raised a brow at Harry. Harry shrugged sheepishly, cradling his mug between his hands and lifting it to his lips. Draco huffed a soft laugh before turning back to the story, his soothing voice bringing to life the adventures of
“Wait—Potter, stop.”
“It is!” Harry stated quickly, “Yes, absolutely. I’d love to have Teddy stay at Grimmauld more.”
“Hello, darling. Did you have a good rest?”
Your fingers tremble against porcelain as you sink into the water—a warm comfort you do not deserve.
Gods, you are so confused…

against the door to prevent any noise from waking the sleeping child, before he followed Draco back downstairs.
Harry turned his attention towards the back of the cottage, soft voices drifting in from the gardens. His lips began to curl and he bit the inside of his cheek to keep himself from grinning too much before making his way outside.
At this, Harry squeaked, because
He spluttered out a halted
Harry groaned, rolling his eyes and tossing his hands in the air in exasperation, “Merlin, Malfoy. His name is
But now...well. He wasn’t expected at Andromeda’s for a while, yet.

Startled, they sprang apart. Harry’s hand felt cold, bereft after the sudden loss of Malfoy’s warm palm.
“Teddy? Are you alright?”
Not that he would have even stood a chance, of course. He had only just realized he was even interested in Draco...let alone what he might
t-shirt that Ginny had deemed fit to complete his current ensemble, which was constantly rising up and revealing the dark trail of hair on his abdomen. He shrugged, trying to loosen the material that stretched across his shoulders, absentmindedly scratching at his collarbone, poking out from the deep V of the neckline.
Harry snorted, rolling his eyes as he watched Malfoy lift his fork from the bowl, thin lips wrapping themselves around the toasty, chewing with precise movements and raising a judgmental brow towards Harry, like the posh git he was.
He heard Draco whisper an

This, however, was new.
—he was smart, and successful, and
But he wouldn’t spontaneously come by. Not when he was likely busy with work and his boyfriend, and when Teddy was no longer staying with Harry. Not when he did not know that Harry never reverted the wards back, and that Draco still had access to Grimmauld.
“That’s irrelevant,” Harry grumbled, “The point is that you are all wrong. I don’t want to ask Draco out and I
Within moments, Draco finished his charms, the room silent but for their soft breaths.
Harry! Draco can teach you to waltz. He can!”
Slowly, Teddy began to morph. His tanned skin began to take on a distinctly green hue, nose flattening until all that remained were two small slits for nostrils. His hair remained its regular turquoise, but as he opened his eyes, they were a bright yellow, vertical pupils slitting the iris.
Everything you need, standing in front of you.
Malfoy frowned. “Why ever would he be mad at you?”
he would be with blond hair and green eyes. How his friends had all looked at him as if he were the stupidest man alive.
“Oh!” Harry grinned, relaxing as he realized that they would only be speaking about Teddy—because after all, why would Andromeda ask about anything else? He cleared his throat, straightening in his armchair as he faced Andromeda. “It was brilliant. Truly, if you would like to visit Narcissa more often, I am happy to have Teddy stay with me! We practiced flying in the gardens. And you know about his Quidditch Camp, right?”
“Ah, yes,” Draco snorted, turning his head to look away. “When you were attempting to catch me in the midst of being
“Bye, Nana!” Teddy waved, watching his grandmother as she tossed Floo powder into the hearth, calling out for Narcissa’s flat and disappearing in a burst of green flames.
“Okay,

Harry groaned, licking his lips and throwing his hands in the air in defeat. He didn’t know how to explain it. He didn’t know
“You’re serious,” Draco murmured, astonishment clear in his gaze.
“Er, yes...but I was wrong, Draco. I know that, now.” He took a deep breath. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have acted like such a twat. But I

sounded on the other side of Harry’s ear, causing him to startle and groan as his head swam with the sudden movement.
Harry chuckled indulgently, resting one hand against Teddy’s back. “Oh, you are, are you?”
“Of course they are, for wixen. But with creatures, it’s more complicated,” Hermione set her cutting knife down, turning towards Harry, her eyes sparkling with the excitement of a complicated case. “Creatures have their own systems in place that operate outside of Wizarding Law. House elves, vampires, Veela, werewolves—all of them. For werewolves, they have a pack—other werewolves and beings that they are tied to. It’s like a family, but instead of being connected by blood relations they’re connected by an inherent bond that forms. A found family, if you will.”
Harry frowned, trying to recall who Maggie was—although he supposed she must have been the welcomewitch who greeted them upon their arrival. He glanced at Malfoy, curious as to why or what they needed to discuss without Teddy there.
to people now. That’s rather a big deal, I reckon.”
He whispered, “What do you mean?”
Teddy rushed back towards his cousin, situating himself on Malfoy’s feet as he wrapped his small hands around slender hips, gazing up expectantly, “Come

was what he needed to know to figure out what Malfoy was doing.
Draco stopped in front of Harry, gazing down at him. They were close—Harry could feel Draco’s breath against his skin. Harry inhaled sharply. His tongue darted out, wetting his lips as his eyes flickered across Draco’s face, before he tugged his bottom lip into his mouth.
“I know,” Teddy sighed, rubbing his face against Andromeda’s leg before raising silver eyes towards Harry.
Sincerely, deeply.
“...quite well done, Tedward. Although I dare say we have some work to do before you can accomplish that particular morph,” came a familiar voice, tone warmer than Harry had ever heard before. Harry’s steps faltered, for surely that couldn’t belong to Malfoy...yet, he
“Alright, Tedward. Take a deep breath for me. Ready?” Teddy nodded shakily and Malfoy pressed the cloth tenderly against his wounds. A quiet breath hissed through Teddy’s clenched teeth as the dittany touched his skin. Teddy winced, followed quickly by Malfoy’s soothing voice. “Shh, it’s alright. You’re okay.”
His heart jumped, and he had to quickly snuff out the flicker of hope that sparked within him. He had let Draco know that he would have access to Grimmauld when Teddy stayed with him last week, and that he was welcome to come by.
“It’s because this was never going to be casual, for me, and he knows that, and he didn’t think it would be the same for you,” Draco murmured against Harry’s lips, voice low and breathy. “I have liked you for longer than I care to admit. I will deny it if I need to—believe me, I will. But
“Will I see you on Monday, Draco?” He asked, grinning up at his cousin.
Despite gaining on his godson rapidly, Teddy still reached the lemon tree well before Harry, thrusting his fists in the air as he yelled out in victory.
With one last chuckle, Harry tossed a handful of Floo powder into the hearth and called out for Grimmauld Place. He sent Teddy’s trunk through and waited a moment for it to reach its destination before following, holding Teddy securely at his side.
Ginny sniggered, “It’s
It becomes cruel…
“Harry—” Draco started, but Harry did not give him a chance to argue.
he hoped that he did not ruin this.
Not how he wanted it to be, anyway.
No one gets away with that without getting punched!”
Here you go again…
, Draco. I don’t want to rush into this. It’s not just about sex, for me.” He swallowed, looking up at Draco through his lashes. “I want—I
“But I thought we were all having lunch together today,” Teddy whined, shifting to his side. Gary gave a startled meow, falling from Teddy’s stomach as the boy sat up. He stared intently at Malfoy, eyes shimmering as they slowly began to morph to an emerald green.
Harry grimaced. He hadn’t looked, not really. Teddy had been screaming, so desperate with his pain that Harry had not thought to question it. “Er...well, I tried.”
He was met with silence for a few moments before George spoke again, amusement poorly disguised as confusion, “Luna? She would have told me about that, certainly.”
Harry licked his lips, unceremoniously tugging the remainder of Draco’s trousers and pants from his body as he stared down at Draco—spread wantonly across his bed, cheeks flushed and a smirk tugging at his lips, cheeks dimpling handsomely.
But you can’t.
. Despite his experience with the Dursley’s, he did enjoy cooking. Perhaps this would be the career that Harry finally connected with. The corner of his lips tugged up in a smile as he circled the word. He would have to reach out to his friends, perhaps owl Rosemerta to see if she would be willing to take on an apprentice at The Three Broomsticks.
A sharp
You don’t understand…
Harry nodded, glancing once more to Andromeda and Malfoy, his gaze lingering on the man as he slowly rose from where he knelt on the floor. Their eyes caught and for a split second time seemed to stand still before Malfoy swiftly turned back to the sink to continue washing the dirtied dishes.
Draco stiffened.
“Yeah, I am,” Harry nodded, turning Draco’s hands over in his own, his thumb rubbing soothing circles over the center of Draco’s palm. He hesitated, furrowing his brows for a moment, before deciding that Ginny had been right—
He rocks you back and forth in the bloodied water.
You are
You laugh, a choked breath of air, to disguise the pain—the realization of exactly what
“Master Harry called?” Kreacher’s hoarse voice grated against Harry’s nerves, and he grimaced before opening one eye to look at the decrepit elf at the edge of his bed.
Of course Ginny would have talked to Hannah already. Harry would not have been surprised if Ginny had some kind of surveillance hidden in the café, just waiting to watch for the moment Harry quit. She always had been ruthless when it came to winning.
You gather your clothes.
You can feel it.
Teddy pouted. His gaze flickered between Harry and Draco before he stepped forward, wrapping his arms securely around one of Draco’s slender thighs.
“Hello,” she slowly closed the book she had been reading and set it on the end table beside her before resting her hands in her lap. “You’re here early today. Lunch hasn’t been served yet.”
“Teddy, why don’t you go gather your things? I will be off momentarily, and then you and Harry can go to Grimmauld Place. I am sure that dear Kreacher will have prepared a wonderful luncheon for your return.”
an idiot, Harry.”
He grins, sharp teeth pulling at his lips, eyes blazing dangerously with a promise.
Harry choked, coughing as tea spewed from his mouth, some dripping out of his nose. He was sure that his face was as red as a blast-ended skrewt for how hot he suddenly was. Setting his tea beside him, the china clattering loudly against the furniture, Harry took a few moments to gather himself. He took deep, slow breaths in an effort to soothe his aching lungs.
It burns…
“Draco?
, for Andromeda to have so thoroughly distracted Harry every time he arrived early, preventing him from encountering Malfoy at all.
You groan, giving yourself over to him.
“Don’t what?” Ron asked. His eyes were wide, shining with feigned innocence. He was a Weasley...younger brother to the founders of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. There was no way he was innocent.
“I won!” he proclaimed, his face flushed in excitement as he maneuvered his broom to grin at Harry.
Hermione, Ginny, and
He blinked, raising his eyebrows defensively as he asked, “What?”
Malfoy spluttered, turning swiftly from the cloud of flour in front of his face.
him—all while forgetting that Draco had a bloody boyfriend.
You lose yourselves.
Draco smiled softly, threading his fingers through blond curls and placing a fond kiss to the boy’s forehead. “Yes, Tedward. I will be here in the morning.”
Draco began to lift himself from his chair. At the movement, Harry nearly fell from his own seat, scrambling frantically to stop the other man.
“Anyway, I must be off,” Ginny mounted her broom in one swift movement, throwing a wink Harry’s way before speeding off. “See you later, losers!”
Ron hesitated briefly, biting his lower lip before shrugging one shoulder, “I don’t know, mate. The ferret seems pretty responsible these days. He probably had a legitimate obligation.”
Teddy dropped his overnight bag on the floor next to Harry’s face, rushing over to Andromeda and offering a sheepish smile, “Goodbye, Nana. I hope that you enjoy your weekend with Aunt Narcissa.”
was altogether unexpected. Brilliant, surely, and a testament to the skill that he inherited from Tonks, but a shock nevertheless.
Draco tilted his head, squinting at Harry.
“What?” Harry turned slightly towards George, narrowing his eyes. That smirk never meant anything good.
Harry sighed, glancing briefly towards Hermione before once again focusing on his godson. Teddy was clutching George’s hand and talking excitedly as they made their way back to the home.
? Helping him morph so he can do what, exactly? What’s your game plan here? What are you actually—”
“Why wouldn’t I be?” Malfoy asked coolly, rinsing a bowl and setting it primly to his left to dry.
“Right,” Malfoy nodded slowly. His fists clenched at his sides before he released a breath, body relaxing. Harry heard a soft
“You have to understand,” Draco started, voice soft, “that Jesse looks out for me. More than anyone has since the war...since my parents.”
As everyone began to leave, Ron turned his gaze on Harry and Draco, eyes slowly cataloguing where they had been bruised only minutes prior. He looked at Draco, running his eyes over him appraisingly to ensure he was no longer injured. “You okay, there, Ferret?”
You open your eyes.
never be—anything more.
Shrinking his robes, Draco placed them into his breast pocket, before turning and pausing as his eyes caught on Harry’s.
“Hm, I don’t know, Teddy. You do look awfully Weasley-like,” he teased.
“You brought him here—” Draco paused, his voice soft, almost vulnerable. “You brought him to me, because he asked?”

As his eyes settled back on Draco, Harry let himself look at the other man—really

“That

, except perhaps to look after Teddy, which was his responsibility as his godfather.
“Come with us,” Harry said, running his thumb across Draco’s cheekbone. “Come to the Burrow.”
Harry blinked, dumbfounded, as he stared at Ron. “What? Malf—he—he’s healed you?”
“Oh. Trainee Healer Malfoy?” The woman asked, tilting her head curiously as she observed him.
“Is it true? I can go see Mr. Neville’s plants soon?” Teddy asked, wrapping his arms tightly around Harry’s neck.
Ginny huffed, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear, “Draco introduced us, alright? You know he has been training in Emergency Healing. Whenever we are injured, more often than not we go straight to the Accident and Emergency Department. I’ve seen him there a lot and...well, we got to know one another. He’s not such a bad bloke now that he’s actually thinking for himself. Even Ron thinks so!”
“Er...Malfoy,” Harry stuttered, gesturing a hand up towards his own face. “You’ve got something...just there.”
In the beat of the music.
“That’s what, Potter?” Malfoy asked, his voice void of any emotion, face shuttered.
“I see the truth. I can hardly say the same for you, stuck in your old schoolboy rivalry as you are,” Andromeda said, her icy voice cutting at Harry. “Draco had other obligations, the nature of which I am not keen to share.”
jogging bottoms aside,” Ron huffed. “Harry...come on. You’ve been obsessed with the git since we were kids.”
“You...what? But...why?” Harry stuttered, gaping.
But is this living?
“Teddy cares about you, and I can see you care about him,” Harry slowly extended one hand, staring determinedly into Malfoy’s vibrant eyes. “So, I figured...it’s been five years. Why don’t we just...start over? For Teddy.”
You let him
The shopkeeper’s eyebrows rose steadily as he hummed. “That is a fine name, for a fine Kneazle.” Slowly, he began to shuffle back towards the front counter. “Shall we gather everything you will need for little Gary, then?”
Harry cleared his throat, fingers pressed against his chest, “Er...I—I don’t—what?”
“Have a good trip, Aunt ‘Dromeda. Give Mother my love,” Malfoy kissed Andromeda’s cheek.
Teddy sniffed, rubbing an arm across his face to wipe away his tears. He nodded shakily, “Okay.”
Teddy squealed in excitement. He reached for Gary, still gnawing at the string, and placed the Kneazle gently in his lap. Taking a deep breath, Teddy nodded. “Okay. Here I go!”
Malfoy cleared his throat, “Potter, why don’t you grab the tomatoes and bacon?”
A brand, stitched across his wrists just as they are across his chest. Silver ropes, golden threads braided within, holding it together.
His hips stutter, emerald eyes boring into your own, shining with a light as bright and deadly as the killing curse, “Draco…
“Mmm...and nothing else of note happened, aside from Teddy’s endeavors at his Quidditch Camp?” Andromeda questioned, settling back into her armchair and gazing at Harry unwaveringly.
He breathed deeply, attempting to calm himself as his heart began to thrum against his chest, hope sparking within. If what Ginny said was true—if Jesse really wasn’t dating Draco, but rather
Harry shook his head, pursing his lips as he placed his cleaned plate to the side to dry. He grabbed a handful of cutlery and dropped them into the sink, reaching in to begin scrubbing at some spoons.
Draco smiled—a small, almost shy curl of his lips—as he stepped into the flames, “Good night, Harry.”
” Draco groaned loudly, throwing his head back against the pillow and reaching down to thread his fingers through Harry’s curls. He tugged lightly, fingers spasming as Harry sucked, before simply resting them against Harry’s skull, holding him and gently massaging his scalp.
“Yes, well...Yule Ball aside, that doesn’t dismiss the fact that the waltz is an outdated dance that has no place in modern society,” Harry shrugged, raising his chin in determination.
Harry began to ladle the fragrant soup into bowls, one by one, before handing them back to their recipients. As he moved to pass Malfoy his dish their gaze met and held. Malfoy hesitated before reaching forward to grasp the bowl, cool fingers brushing briefly against Harry’s own, a stark difference from the heat of the soup. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and quickly looked down, ladling soup into his own bowl and sitting down.
“I know, ‘Mione! But he did want Gary. He was rather convincing,” Harry mumbled, shoving a piece of bread into his mouth.
“Draco heals people!” Teddy smiled proudly. “He works at Mungo’s!”
It was the man that Draco had been pictured with in
As he stepped back through the Floo and into the sitting room, Harry deflated. The house was quiet, save for an inquisitive meow as Gary observed him from his perch on an armchair—questioning where Teddy had gone.
“I’m okay, Teddy,” Harry said quietly, trying to smile despite wrapping his free arm around his ribs to ease the pain.
Just as he was about to dig into the meal, Harry glanced at Andromeda and paused. She raised an inquisitive brow, her gaze calculating as she observed him. He raised both of his own in response, tilting his head in question.
“Harry...come on. You’re great with kids. You love Quidditch. You need to do
. Ginny came by the other day and told me that
Harry began to walk towards his family, gravel crunching loudly under his feet. Teddy turned quickly at the noise, a bright smile spreading across his face once he saw Harry.
He turns to his friends—the Weasel and Granger—before making his way to the dance floor.
Yet, as Harry watched Teddy rub his nose against Gary’s, pure bliss reflected in his gap-toothed grin, Harry couldn’t regret his decision.
“Er...Teddy is in his room, getting ready for bed,” Harry explained, nodding his head towards the hallway that would lead upstairs. He paused, shifting slightly on his heels before blurting out, “I’m glad you came.”
Any heat that had smoldered in Draco’s eyes was immediately snuffed out. He sat up quickly, swinging his legs over the arms of the chair so that they rested flat against the floor. In the blink of an eye, Draco looked like the perfect pureblood—sitting straight in his chair, face void of any emotion, hands resting loosely in his lap.
And if that meant keeping an eye on Malfoy, then so be it.
Harry’s mouth snapped shut at the high, terrified voice that screamed out. Teddy only sounded like this during his particularly frightening nightmares, and Harry instantly shifted focus to his godson.
“Oh...” Harry frowned, nursing his Firewhisky in the quiet of the room, the only sounds the crackling of the firewood and Gary’s purrs. Narrowing his eyes, Harry paused, thinking back to whenever Ron spoke of his raids as an Auror. Never once had he mentioned seeing Malfoy in the aftermath.
“But...” Teddy whimpered, chewing his bottom lip as he hugged the Kneazle closer to his body. His eyes flickered quickly around the room as if trying to think of something—
Determined to catch Malfoy in the act, Harry didn’t bother knocking at the front door as he normally did. Andromeda liked to welcome Harry into her home every weekend, offering him tea and biscuits, before he took Teddy back to Grimmauld for the remainder of the weekend while Andromeda visited her sister in France.
were together, and that...well. She didn’t really say, actually.” Harry frowned, recalling how Ginny had urged him to talk to Draco. “But she said that there was a reason that Jesse didn’t like me...And that I should ask you about it.”
You floo to his first love…
But then…
Draco’s lips twitched, a light flush spreading across his cheeks, “Hello.”
…you were never your own person.
we found six gnomes!” He gazed up at Harry excitedly, his turquoise fringe bright in the sunlight, silver eyes glimmering with pride.
?” Harry narrowed his eyes at Ginny, who only smirked sharply in response.
Ginny sighed, “Because, Harry. It’s not my place!”
Without a second glance, Teddy scrambled out of the sitting room, his loud footsteps echoing throughout the halls as he made his way up to his room to prepare for bed.
Malfoy was definitely teaching him bad habits.
“Are you quite certain?” Draco asked. “Only I could have sworn that Ginevra’s invitation specified a 10:00 arrival. I do believe we have nearly half an hour until our presence is required.”
Harry coughed, his eyes widening slightly at her clear dismissal. “Er...I’m not—that is, I didn’t just come to—well certainly
“Did he, now?” A chuckle echoed between the bookshelves, deeper than Harry would have expected. “Well, we will definitely have to work on your reptilian features so that you can surprise him.”
“Wait, what? Who?”
Taking a deep breath, Harry squared his shoulders and made his way out of the house to join Teddy and Draco in the garden.
, it was how much he wanted this
“Yes!” Teddy exclaimed with one last push, surprisingly forceful as Harry tripped into Malfoy’s chest. Malfoy’s hands reached out to stabilize him, before Harry quickly pulled himself back. “Draco is a
“Of course not,” Malfoy frowned. His eyes flickered between Harry’s eyes and his mouth briefly before icy silver met glittering emerald—challenging. “Why don’t you explain it to me, Potter.”
In an instant, any apparent innocence that Ginny may have been projecting disappeared. Her eyes glinted with satisfaction in the knowledge that Harry would tie himself to this wager.
It wasn’t until Draco’s fingers pulled at his hair, dragging him away, that Harry pulled back. He whined, panting, as Draco wrapped his hands around Harry’s arms and hauled him upwards.
“Hey, Teddy,” Harry grinned, placing a wet kiss upon Teddy’s cheek as he stood up, before turning towards Malfoy, who stood stiffly at the kitchen counter.
But it was
the other month, and how close you were. And...I mean, at the camp last weekend, I don’t think I was exactly

with them? No offense, mate, but...you don’t really seem to have the personality for it.”
“Well, I’ve run into him a few times. You know, with work.”
“Good,” Harry grinned up at Draco, pleased when a light flush began to bloom across the man’s cheeks. Just then, Ginny circled above their heads before gracefully landing in front of them.
Draco smiled fondly, running a hand through Teddy’s dark curls before turning on his heels. Just as Draco was about to cross the wards, he lifted his gaze. Harry wanted nothing more than to take a step forward, to chase after Draco, follow him as he crossed over the wards.
“I did,” Draco nodded, “But needs must.”
“Now that you are here, love, I must be going. I trust that you will all behave?” Andromeda gracefully stood from her chair, giving a firm look to Malfoy and Teddy, and staring pointedly at Harry while she waited for an answer.
“Yes, Potter?” Malfoy questioned, laughter clear in his smooth voice, waving a hand in a quick circle in front of him as if to indicate that Harry now had permission to continue speaking.
Draco hummed.
Hermione cleared her throat softly, smiling indulgently as she watched Harry. “Did you hear me, Harry?”
“You can’t save him, mate.”
? What’s the point of it?”
His throat felt thick, and Harry struggled to swallow, until Draco raised his eyes from
it would not mean that he would be interested in
Harry swallowed thickly at Draco’s gentle touch. He bit his lips and averted his gaze, his cheeks heating as he felt a sudden flood of warmth rush through him, followed immediately by the cool comfort of a healing charm. It felt too intimate—in the middle of the Quidditch Pitch, a crowd gathered around them—to have Draco’s magic wash over him, caressing him, lingering like a lover's kiss and easing his pain.
With a glance at Malfoy—who nodded and gave a soft smile towards him, what the
“Anyway, if he has these pack bonds with you, Teddy is going to want to instinctually do whatever is within his means to help strengthen those bonds—not only the bonds that he has himself, but also those between whom he considers his pack,” Hermione stated, “A pack is a family—a familial unit, as I said. You and Malfoy calling each other by your given names will only strengthen that bond for Teddy.”
“What?” He asks, voice cold, “What do you mean by that?”
“No,” he said, pressing a finger against Draco’s lips, “You should come with, Draco. Ron and Ginny like you. I’m pretty sure George does, too—although, to be fair, he may just like the drama of it all...”
is clear, let us move on,” He looked down at Teddy. “Shall we go find Gary?”
They looked as if they were floating, waltzing on air. Harry watched quietly from the doorway, curiously drinking in the scene unfolding before him, before Teddy looked his way and squealed.
to what the customer wanted. The comfort that he had experienced in the kitchen at Andromeda’s cottage with Teddy and Malfoy, or when he helped Molly at The Burrow, had been completely absent at The Three Broomsticks.
Harry took a deep breath, eyes widening in shock as he stared at his friend, “Wait...what?”
“Well...er, Teddy and I practiced flying earlier in the week. Before his Quidditch Camp,” Harry said slowly, hesitantly, as he reached for his own cup of tea.
The only response he received was a high-pitched wail.
Harry hummed as he looked around the garden, gaze settling on the lemon tree beside his kitchen window, its leaves vibrant in the sunlight, fruit heavy on its branches.
Harry froze. “What do you mean?”
“Wait—I thought you took the day off?”
Draco rolled his eyes, reaching for his broom and gracefully mounting it.
for him.
cast over their group.
A halo of light reflected on the crown of Teddy’s platinum blond curls. His cheeks were flushed, bright green eyes wet with the last of his tears, one dimple pulling at the corner of his mouth as he smiled shakily at Draco.
Merlin, he hoped that Draco could get used to it, too.
With a quick nod, Draco shot up into the air, leaving Harry staring dumbly after him. He shook his head, laughing under his breath at the sheer absurdity of Draco and Ginny being...what, friends?
“Oh...well,” Harry bit the inside of his cheeks, feeling his face flush, “Er...what were you going to ask?”
The panic calms.
Harry laughed, halting beside the boy and ruffling his hair.

“Damnit,” Harry groaned as he rolled off of Draco, rubbing his hands across his face in dismay. He adored Teddy, but the child had
All that mattered was that Draco hesitated—that he had this chance.
Teddy sheepishly glanced up at Draco, still scuffing his shoes through the dirt. His hair shimmered, shifting to a darker shade of turquoise, and as he raised his eyes they were a brilliant green, “Do you really have to go?”
He had to try.
He’s gone.
“Yes, Draco. I have,” she confirmed, eyes settling on Malfoy for a moment before flickering towards Harry. “And I trust that Teddy’s waltz lessons have been going well?”
the man out the door. “We have to go
He’s pressing you into familiar sheets, fingers ripping at your clothes.
“Yes, I am aware,” Malfoy frowned.
Harry returned the grin, running his hands fondly through dirty blond locks of hair.
Suddenly, the hearth roared to life, green flames erupting with a loud
“Well, look at that!” The shop owner grinned crookedly. “He likes you. Looks like you’ve got yourself a familiar!”
Draco, leaning against the headboard of Teddy’s bed, fingers gently threading through the boy’s hair, while Teddy curled up against his side.
“He’s different, though. Watch.”
Malfoy spluttered as he clutched at Harry’s sides, warm fingers digging into his skin in an effort to keep Harry from falling to the floor.
“Oh!” Ginny chimed in, “Are we talking about Teddy convincing Harry to send him to Quidditch camp by suddenly becoming a

called him Tedward. “Yeah...I did. Is that okay?”
” Harry groaned, shoving Ron away from him as his friend cackled loudly.
“Mmm,” Harry nodded, “Yes...they call each other
“What?” Malfoy questioned, voice cool and monotone as he stared at Harry, eyes wide.
Andromeda hummed, raising one eyebrow just as Malfoy had earlier, amusement shining in her eyes. She patted Harry’s cheek once more before looking back at Teddy, “Darling. Be good for your cousin and godfather while I am away. Do you promise?”
That boy was every bit his father’s son, Harry thought. A Marauder to the core.
“Alright, Teddy. Are you ready?” Harry asked, mounting his own broom.
You swallow.
“That’s wonderful, Teddy,” Harry said through gritted teeth, keeping a gentle hand on his godson’s shoulder. “Why don’t you go and see how lunch is coming along while I talk to Malf—er, Draco for a moment?”
Platinum blonde hair framed his face. His right eye remained a brilliant amber, glimmering with mischief, while the left was a stormy grey, silver threaded throughout, a perfect mirror of those belonging to the man behind him.
“Alright,” Harry shrugged, inhaling quickly as he pushed himself away from the counter. If Malfoy said he was fine with Teddy leaving early, then Harry would just have to take his word for it.
“He’s fine.”
A sudden
“Hey,” he said, his voice quieter than he had intended—almost intimate.
To his side, Ginny squeaked, her hands lifting quickly to her mouth in an effort to withhold what Harry suspected was laughter.
Harry hesitated as he watched them walk away, reeling from this new version of Malfoy. He was still the snarky, stuck up prat that Harry was well familiar with. Yet, with Teddy, he was shockingly caring and gentle. Malfoy was the one that Teddy reached out to when he was hurt, when he needed comfort...
“Why, Draco?” Potter runs his fingers along your neck. He leans forward, lips brushing against your ear before he suckles at the lobe. “Do you not want this?”
“Sorry, my hearing isn’t what it once was. What’s that I hear? Ronnikins, is that...denial?”
They don’t know how you hide knives within your grasp, ready to strike as soon as your opponent exposes their neck. They don’t know the darkness that lives within you—suffocating anyone who dares to breathe within your presence.
Teddy squealed excitedly, wriggling down from Draco’s shoulders until his feet were firmly on the ground beneath him. He thrust his training broom at Harry before reaching out to them both. One small hand grasped Draco’s, the other clasping Harry’s. He smiled brightly as he looked between them.
Harry furrowed his brows, tilting his head slightly in question. “Er, yes? I didn’t know what to do...clearly, I was no use,” he started, shrugging absently, “You’re a Healer. Teddy wanted you...why wouldn’t I bring him?”
“Of course it would,” Harry glanced at Draco, throwing a quick wink his way, reveling in Draco’s wide-eyed surprise. “I’m sure your cousin loves it when you look like him.”
Harry bit his own tongue sharply in an effort to prevent himself from groaning aloud.
“I suppose I will be green,” Draco said, reaching for the tiny pawns and placing them on the board game.
When Draco pulled his hand away, his fingers dragged against Harry’s arm. Harry inhaled deeply and lifted his gaze to Draco’s, whispering a hoarse, “Thanks.”
“Harry...we are going to start a permanent Quidditch Camp for kids,” she said slowly, staring at him with wide brown eyes. When he did not respond, she huffed. “Alright, let me make this perfectly clear. The Harpies want to hold a monthly Quidditch Camp for kids to start learning how to fly and play. We will need volunteers, but we will also need regular staff to help organize it since we won’t be able to during our season.”
“Mmm...don’t stop on my behalf, Potter. I was quite enjoying the show,” Draco leered, cheek dimpling as he spread his legs and let his eyes roam over Harry’s exposed body.
every weekend.
if we leave now. Don’t you want to wait for Draco to get here?”
After the Harpies scrimmage, Ginny and Angelina had come down to talk to Harry and Teddy. As soon as Angelina had mentioned that the Harpies would host a Quidditch Camp for wizarding children in two weeks time, Teddy had spun to Harry. His hair had bled of all color so quickly that Harry barely blinked and it was platinum blond, amber eyes shining as he reached both hands forward to clutch at one of Harry’s.
Malfoy’s gaze snapped back to Harry, eyes widened incredulously. “Excuse me?”
Wiping his suddenly damp hands against his jeans, Harry stood up and began to clear the table. He was washing the dishes, setting a freshly cleaned plate to the side, elbow deep in soapy water, when Draco and Teddy entered the kitchen.
With that, Teddy spun on his heels and strode out of the kitchen to the back garden, slamming the door behind him.
Right?
Inhaling quickly, Harry cleared his throat. He squeezed his eyes shut, breathing slowly in an attempt to calm his suddenly rapid breaths.
“Why’d you yell at Malfoy?” Ron asked. His back was turned as he continued to stir the stew, eyes focused on the steaming pot in front of him.
Closing his eyes, Teddy furrowed his brows as he concentrated. For a few moments, nothing happened. Gary’s tail flicked from side to side before he stood on his hind legs, propping his front paws against Teddy’s chest with a meow as he lifted his small head closer to Teddy’s own.
Harry chuckled, grinning as he looked down at his godson. “I don’t know, Teddy. What?”
Harry froze, eyes wide as his eyes flickered across Ginny’s face, looking for any hint that she was lying to him. Slowly, she lifted her finger from his lips. He took a shaky breath and whispered, “But...they were at that gala together. They were pictured in
“Well then, we will see you tomorrow, Andy.” Harry addressed Andromeda, hesitating to move his gaze from Malfoy’s stiff back.
Harry lifted his eyebrows curiously. “Oh?”
“Yes, darling,” Andromeda ran comforting fingers through Teddy’s turquoise hair, “He often does. You know he has to, though.”
“No. We need to see Healer Malfoy,” he growled. Teddy let out a choked sob at the sound, fingers grasping weakly at Harry’s t-shirt as his hair began to morph to a dull, dirty blond.
“But you said you would stay until we went to Harry’s,” Teddy’s high voice whined, echoing down the hall.
As they approached, Harry took a sharp turn, whipping around it with a finesse he hadn’t used since playing Quidditch for Gryffindor prior to the war. He laughed aloud as Teddy cried out in frustration, eyes zeroing in on the lemon tree straight ahead.
They all believe it. And you are so fucking good at portraying that image…
“Yes, yes,” Harry nodded, running a shaky hand through his wet hair as he caught his breath. “Er, you asked me something? When I was in the shower?”
Harry snorted before taking off in pursuit. “Oh no, you don’t!”
You part your lips, you need to say something—you need to make it stop.

Claiming you.
“Yes—wait, no!” Harry frowned. “No, nothing like that. Andy would sense if it were something big, but she’s enamored with him. No...whatever he’s doing, it’s more subtle. It must have something to do with them—with Teddy and Andromeda. He’s trying to manipulate

Ron squinted suspiciously. “You sure?”
tell you,” Ron shrugged, propping an elbow on the couch and resting his hand along Hermione’s thigh, thumbing gently at the seam of her jeans. “It’s like I said...I see Malfoy at work pretty regularly. He’s normally at St. Mungo’s whenever I’m there. Don’t get me wrong, the ferret is still a prat, to be sure. But he’s an okay bloke. Heals me up all the time and doesn’t even say anything bad about me,” he paused, shrugged with indifference as he drained the rest of his tumbler. “Most of the time, anyway.”
“Er...well, I suppose it’s when he’s feeling really strongly about something,” Harry mumbled, suspicious of whatever Hermione was trying to imply. “You know...when he’s upset, or wants something. Sometimes when he’s just really tired. Why?”
he needs to teach me.”
“First one to the lemon tree?” Harry raised a brow in question.
The room was quiet for a few minutes, filled with only the sounds of Teddy’s sniffles and hiccups, and Harry’s voice humming a made-up lullaby.
Suddenly, Harry realized how close he was standing to Malfoy, one hand resting against his face in what could have been a caress if it was anyone other than
“So I’m ‘Potter,’ now, am I?” Potter chuckles, leaning forward and nipping at your collarbone, sucking at the skin.
It reminded him of Sundays at the Burrow, when he and Teddy joined the Weasley’s for breakfast.
“Do you doubt my expertise as a Healer, Harry?” Draco asked slowly, his voice low and monotone, devoid of any emotion. It was the lack of inflection that startled Harry the most.
His given—
“Promise you will come and say good night, and read
Harry hadn’t been this close to Malfoy since he had pulled him from the Fiendfyre five years ago. It felt like the heat of those flames were licking at him now as he stared up at Malfoy. Harry’s eyes flickered between Malfoy’s icy silver irises, trying to find the scheme held within. Movement caught his gaze as Malfoy’s tongue wet his lips.
Harry rounded a corner, two figures finally coming into view,  sitting cross-legged in front of one another. Teddy’s back was towards him, his small frame wriggling around. Atop his head was a dark brown mop of curls, the same that Harry saw every morning when he looked in the mirror.
I know who you are.
Harry groaned, “Come on, Gin. Are you really going to make me say it?”
“Clothes. Off.” Draco murmured, tugging at Harry’s shirt.
Ron brushed by Hermione, gently squeezing her shoulder as he made his way to the stove, checking on the rest of the stew that they were preparing.
Harry laughed, tightening his grip around Teddy’s hand reassuringly. “It’s alright, Tedward. I will just assume that he taught you
The smug prat—he was washing the dishes like a muggle just to get a rise out of Harry. That had to be it.
“And?” Draco questioned, humming as he observed the results of the diagnostic charms. He pulled his fingers from Teddy’s curls, brushing them gently against Teddy’s cheek, before shifting so that his wand hovered over Teddy’s injured leg. His wand hand began a slow, complicated movement—some healing charm that Harry surely did not understand.
“You fell asleep. Did you rest well?” Potter asks, raising one thick eyebrow as his bright green eyes stare into your own.
, he couldn’t. Andy, he has always hated me! We may be friends now, but—he can’t—it’s not possible...right?”
Harry blinked, dumbfounded, at Hermione. “Are you joking? What about just being there, at Andy’s? She and Teddy are obsessed with him! It’s not right!”
Euphoria.
“This,” Draco nodded to the sink full of dishes and to Harry washing them by hand. “Correct me if I am wrong...but I do recall that it seemed as if you were quite perplexed when you caught me washing dishes the muggle way. And yet, it appears that you are doing the exact same thing.”
Harry snorted, shaking his head. Now that Harry knew that his godson was spending time with Draco, he could recognize why and

The room was silent for a few moments, no sounds beyond the distant echoes of Teddy’s voice as he spoke to Andromeda down the hallway and their own soft breaths.
They finished their meals, and while Teddy licked the last of his crumble from his plate, Andromeda rose from her chair.
“Brilliant!” Ginny squealed, lunging forward and wrapping her arms around Harry’s neck, pulling him in for a tight hug. “Oh, I’m so glad you agreed, Harry! You’re going to be

Harry looked at Ginny, bewildered, “What are you talking about, Gin?”

“And you think that he—” He paused, trying to comprehend everything that Hermione had said. “You think that me calling him

You had no warning…
“That’s right,” Andromeda set a comforting hand on Teddy’s shoulder before looking back to Draco, “Thank you for coming by, dear. We will see you next week.”
Andromeda remained where she was, turning her head to observe Harry as he approached, sitting back gracefully on her heels. “Good morning, Harry.”
Flames lick at your skin.
You want to scream, to cry for help, to escape.
“With the Weasleys,” Harry clarified quickly.
“There you go,” Ginny grinned brightly. “Go, go, Gryffindor.”
Andromeda hummed softly before giving a curt nod, “Well, alright then. As long as your lessons were completed. Now then, it is time for lunch. I have prepared stuffed guinea fowl with new potatoes and roasted vegetables. Come along, darling.”
Harry watched him for a moment, smiling indulgently. “So...what are we making?”

Harry scoffed, waving the proffered hand away as he began to push himself up, “I’m fine.”
“Er...what?” Harry stuttered.
Draco sat in Teddy’s bed, his back resting against the headboard. Teddy’s arms were wrapped tightly around Draco’s torso, his head resting lightly atop his chest.
“Oh?” Hermione’s fingers paused in Gary’s fur as she focused on Harry. “And why do you say that?”
“Oh, shut it,” Harry laughed, grinning at the other man. Draco’s smile softened and he looked down at the game, pale lashes fluttering against his rosy cheeks, freckles prominent against the flush.
“Harry!” he yelled, tripping as he pulled himself from Malfoy’s steady grasp and stumbled towards Harry.
It feels as if it were the last chance you had—and maybe it is.
“No, you gave me some bullshit excuse. That’s all that you did.”
“Oh, er...” Harry hesitated, eyes flickering as he looked at the abundance of vegetables growing before him. “Well, I’m not much of a cook. Any of it would be good, I think.”
Teddy bit his lip, nodding his head quickly. “Okay!”

By the time Saturday arrived, Grimmauld Place was transformed, the once dull hallways now bright, sunlight reverberating throughout and bringing a warmth that Harry had never felt in the home. He had remodeled when he moved in after the war, trying to make it less gloomy, but it had never seemed as alive, as welcoming, as it did now.
Ginny and Angelina stilled behind Teddy, gazing in confusion as they looked at the child before Ginny grinned amusedly and leaned over to whisper something in Angelina’s ear.
“It’s short for Garfield Lasagnaface McWhiskers,” Harry grumbled. A loud snort of laughter escaped Ron, and Hermione and Luna smiled indulgently.
When he finally raised his eyes to meet Andromeda’s, she took a delicate sip from her tea, brown eyes twinkling with mischief, one side of her lips tugged up in an amused smirk.
be imagining this—and licked his lips, slowly lifting his heated gaze to Draco’s own.
Harry couldn’t help but feel that part of the reason for Malfoy’s departure, despite any rounds he may be assigned that day, was due to Harry’s presence. Aside from the Saturday that he had been late—which Harry now realized must have been due to his job at St. Mungo’s—Malfoy had always stayed with Teddy through lunch.
Teddy sighed heavily as he nodded, “Alright.” He reached up, fingers grasping desperately before Malfoy let out a soft huff of laughter and leaned down to embrace the boy. “I love you, Draco.”
Teddy tripped as he skidded to a stop in front of Ginny.“Now that they are better, can we fly some more?” he asked, “Please?”
He suddenly remembered the other week, when he had been sitting with his friends, commenting on how cute Teddy looked when he morphed—how
“Hey!” George cried out in defense, while Ron and Ginny laughed uproariously. The group swiftly dismounted and made their way towards the home. Ginny wrapped her arm through Jesse’s, smiling brightly at her boyfriend as they walked past Harry and entered the Burrow. Ron and George shoved at each other, stumbling as they approached, before catching Hermione’s raised brow and grinning sheepishly. George snickered and rushed inside while Ron placed a chaste kiss to Hermione’s cheek. Hermione rolled her eyes, smiling fondly, before they turned to join everyone for their meal.
A firm grasp, holding you down.
Between attending Quidditch Camp each month, as well as flying regularly with Draco and Harry, Teddy was already mastering his broom. Draco had commented the other night as they lay in bed that they may need to take the training charms off soon—though Harry was more reluctant to do so.
“So, er...” Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, glancing across the darkened room to look at Draco.
“Tedward,” Malfoy said firmly, “You know that I cannot stay when I am required at St. Mungo’s.”
Harry felt as if the air in the room was suddenly gone, vanished, as his breath caught in his throat.
Smoke.
And how that was impossible.
Before Harry could think any more about it, the door to the gardens slammed open.
! I just have to figure out how.”
Harry laughed, returning Andromeda’s exuberant greetings, before smiling cheekily, “We did enjoy our time together, Andy. If you ever feel the need to visit Narcissa for an extended leave again, I’m sure that we will be fine.”
reconciliation.
Teddy sucked on his bottom lip, shifting from one foot to the other. “But...do you think he will be mad at me?”
Teddy simply nodded, stepping forward and placing his hands against Harry’s back as he began to push Harry forward, towards Malfoy.
“Yeah!” Teddy’s hair began to morph sporadically, shifting so quickly between colors that it resembled a kaleidoscope. He bit his lip between his teeth as his hair finally settled, a deep rosy hue that perfectly matched his flushed cheeks as he shyly looked up at Harry between thick lashes. “I like that only you and Draco call me that.”
You can feel breath against the nape of your neck.
“You know that I love you, Harry. You are a wonderful godfather to Teddy and I will forever be grateful that you have been there when his parents could not be. But let me make myself clear,” her voice lowered, cutting through the room with the precision of a

us to think. No, it has to be something different. Something bad...”
“Are you okay?”
You don’t recognize this room.
,” Harry gasped out, throwing his hands in the air. He was always helpless when Teddy wanted something. He wanted his godson to have everything that he never had, and if that meant adopting a Kneazle...well, then so be it. “He can stay at Grimmauld.”
The room is on fire, just as you planned. Flames consume documents, proposals, statements.
But no one will believe you.
Glancing down at Teddy, however, who was staring up at Harry with pleading grey eyes, Harry let out a soft sigh, “Of course, Teddy. Finish your ice cream and we can go say hi to George.”
that you can.”
The welcomewitch’s eyes widened as she watched Teddy, astonishment clear across her face at the young metamorphmagus before her.
“Fine.” With one last huff, Teddy  glanced forlornly at Harry and made his way to the sitting room, presumably to finish his morning reading.
“Oh, no, love. Thank you.” Andromeda smiled softly, gently placing one hand against Malfoy’s pale cheek in a quick caress, before she turned to place a soft kiss to Teddy’s forehead. “I will see you tomorrow evening, darling.”
“Of course I bloody well asked!”
You lie there.
Harry paused at the sight. Now that he was no longer worried about Teddy, he took a moment to appreciate how the robes hung from Draco’s lithe form. While the ghastly color certainly did not suit his pale skin, Harry noted that the man looked quite distinguished in them.
Teddy ran into the room, dragging a charmed trunk behind him as he skidded to a stop next to Harry. “I’m ready!”
They lay beside each other for a few moments, listening to the sounds of their soft breathing. Harry fingered the sharp lines of Draco’s jaw, the tendons of his neck. He lingered on the curves of Draco’s shoulders and the freckles he found there. “Stay with me tonight,” Harry whispered hesitantly, slowly raising his eyes back to Draco’s. “Please.”
Harry chuckled, fingers wrapping gently around Teddy’s own, “He’ll join us soon, Teddy, don’t worry.” He squeezed his godson’s hand reassuringly, smiling when silver eyes met emerald. “Are you ready?”
at this rate. I cannot take this anymore!”
“Then we’ll figure it out when it happens, like we always do.”
“Teddy is adjusting quite well to Andromeda moving to France,” Hermione observed as she sat beside Harry on the steps of the Burrow’s porch, overlooking the gardens and the pickup game of Quidditch unfolding there.
letting Draco know how he felt. “Anyway, Ginny disabused me of that notion. I, er...may not have been the most observant friend to her in recent months.”
Within moments, the pitter patter of paws echoed down the halls, and Gary nonchalantly strode into the sitting room. He flicked his tail, gazing up at Harry as if questioning what was taking

was yet to be determined.
“He always has to go early,” Teddy murmured. Harry had to strain himself to hear the words, and froze when he did. He looked up towards Andromeda, only to find her gazing back at him.
Having decided to leave Rosmerta’s employ, and with no other career prospects lined up, Harry spent the majority of his time the following week lingering around Grimmauld Place, preparing it for guests. Teddy would be staying there the following week while he attended quidditch camp, as Andromeda had decided to extend her weekend visit to France to a full week, and Harry had eagerly jumped at the opportunity to care for his godson for more than a weekend at a time.
Harry chuckled, running a hand along Draco’s flank. “Mm, but what if I don’t want to?”
“You know what,” Harry grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Hey, Ted,” Harry laughed, running his fingers through unfamiliar blonde hair as they sat up. It felt like silk, and his stomach churned, before Harry focused on the one familiar amber eye in front of him, “What on earth are you doing?”
“What?” Teddy gasped. His eyes began to water, morphing quickly as he turned to gaze beseechingly at Draco, amber shifting to a deep, forest green. “But...Draco!” Teddy’s lower lip began to quiver, a lone tear making its way down one flushed cheek. He choked back on a sob, “I-I wanted you to tuck me in! And read
Harry and Draco stared at one another for a moment before Draco called out, eyes locked on Harry, “I’m here, Tedward. I will be right there.”
“You’re a brilliant cook, mate. I’ll bet this is it for you,” Ron nodded encouragingly, offering a lopsided smile as he stared up at Harry from the floor.
“Well, hello boys,” Ginny purred. She stood on the tips of her toes, greeting Harry with a kiss to his cheek.
Harry nearly choked on his tongue. He felt as if all of the blood drained from his face, before flooding back in so quickly that he was certain his cheeks must have been as red as his best friend’s hair.
“Don’t you?” Harry rasped. He was so close to Malfoy now, a subtle scent of citrus wafting up to him as he leaned closer. He could feel the heat of Malfoy’s body against his chest.
Harry’s gaze flickered towards Draco, who stood stiffly with his arms crossed tightly over his chest. Harry noted how the fabric of his shirt strained against his biceps, before looking into stormy grey eyes that watched him closely, one pale eyebrow raised.
“Love you,” Teddy murmured into Malfoy’s neck.
“What?” Draco’s steely gaze snapped back to Harry, eyes wide and pink lips parted. His cheeks were flushed—whether from his efforts to get to Teddy or from Harry’s statement, Harry was not sure—and Harry could not help but notice the light smattering of freckles across Draco’s cheeks that stood out against the blush.
Time seemed to slow as Teddy began to lose his balance.
“I mean, what are you doing
Ginny snickered, “Yeah, but what does the bursting
Like a curse…
He had just defended Malfoy.
Teddy whimpered, nuzzling into Malfoy’s neck and wrapping his limbs around him as the man stood gracefully from his armchair despite an armful of child.
“Er...he was late,” Harry tore off another piece of his bread, popping it into his mouth and chewing slowly.
“Malfoy is up to something.”
“Hey,” Harry murmured, smiling shyly. He wriggled around under the sheets, moving closer to Draco so that their heads rested atop the same pillow.
You turn your head, nuzzling into the solid warmth behind you. It helps, you think, as hands grab your hips, holding you down.
“Er, well...” Harry cleared his throat, suddenly feeling uncomfortably hot as his friends gazed at him. “Well, he is surprisingly good with Teddy...and Teddy and Andy like him. So, I mean...I guess he’s got to be okay, right?”
She paused, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes and instead looking around the kitchen. Harry leaned back in his own chair, sighing heavily as he crossed his arms over his chest, narrowing his eyes, “Alright...that does not answer my question.”
Harry frowned, confusion beginning to pull him from his heated daze.
As he watched the flames licking at the hearth, Hermione and Ron beginning a soft conversation to his side, Harry’s mind drifted.
“No,” Harry started, quickly continuing to defend himself, “but we all saw that article in the
“Er...with what?” Harry blinked, confused. This conversation felt like it had taken far too many turns for him to realistically have been able to follow it.
Andromeda narrowed her eyes, a small smirk tugging at her lips. Harry had never thought of her as a Slytherin until this moment. “And I, as his grandmother and guardian, have the right to withhold information that is not necessary for you to know. If Draco wants you to know what has prevented him from being with Teddy this morning, he can tell you. But it is certainly not a requirement that I disclose his personal business to you.”
“His cousin.” Harry stiffened, shoving his hands in his pockets.
“No, I’m not,” Harry hissed. He could not believe none of his friends believed him. “I am not

Harry frowned, narrowing his eyes suspiciously as he observed Ginny for a moment, “...I can’t tell if you’re serious or not.”

Like a secret…
, of all people, was not stepping up in his role as godfather.
Harry hesitated. He knew that he had arrived early, and it was still supposed to be Malfoy’s time with Teddy. But he had never been good at telling Teddy
Draco lifted his hand from Harry’s chest, fingers twisting into Harry’s curls, holding him in place as he darted forward, bringing their mouths together in a wet kiss. It quickly shifted, from open-mouthed and passionate to merely breathing into each other as Draco’s thrusts began to quicken and his hand wrapped around Harry’s cock, pulling at it and swiping his thumb across the wet head every few strokes.
“I don’t—“ you swallow, voice thick in your throat.
Harry had begun to suspect it was all intentional.
Draco turned to watch as Teddy ran around the pitch, chasing a handful of other young wixen. “Well, then. I trust that you will take my professional expertise into consideration when I say that Tedward is perfectly capable of participating in this endeavor.”
Teddy whined from where he lay, limbs spread-eagled across the floor, looking up pitifully at Harry. “But I don’t
Frowning, Harry recalled some of Teddy’s most recent morphs, “He’s blond a lot, I suppose. Sometimes his eyes will change—turn kind of hazel, almost grey.”
He knew.
“Draco,” Potter whispers, voice quiet and low, as if he is speaking to a startled Hippogriff. “I have called you by your name for nearly six years now.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Yes, well. Now that
“Good. I’ll see you on Sunday, then,” Ginny winked, sending a wry grin his way, before striding from the kitchen. Within moments, Harry heard the
But, Harry couldn’t look away from the photo. The evening light shone off of Malfoy’s platinum hair as he leaned in to the man standing next to him. The man was older, tall with chestnut brown hair and dark, sparkling eyes focused solely on Malfoy. He leaned in close to Malfoy—too close to be mere acquaintances—before the photo looped to the beginning.
. “Listen, Draco...I know that you probably don’t feel the same way. And that’s alright. But I couldn’t stand you thinking that this was something else—or that I liked
“I promise!” Teddy called out, rolling over on the floor so that he could smile up at Andromeda while Gary pranced around on his stomach.
“What!?” Harry gaped, looking quickly between all of his friends. “What are you talking about? I’m not
Just as he was about to pull the handle of his broom up, to avoid a collision, Harry caught sight of red hair glimmering in the distance, blinding in the morning light—
“Wait...what?”
“Oh!” Teddy suddenly exclaimed, standing straighter and pulling back slightly from the cage. His eyes were wide, focused on a small Kneazle who was watching him from the corner.
was—was not mutual.
“Stop,” Harry groaned, darting forward and sucking Draco’s bottom lip between his own. When he leaned back, Draco’s eyes were wide as he stared down at Harry, pupils blown so that there was but a thin ring of silver outlining black. “I just meant...
Andromeda merely hummed, reaching for Teddy’s hand and turning her back to Harry, “Come now, Teddy. Why don’t we finish packing for your weekend with Harry?”
“Well at least I did
Teddy glanced up at Andromeda, eyes wide, and whispered, “I thought we weren’t supposed to do that?”
“Of course,” Harry agreed quickly, reaching for a knife before beginning to slice the tomatoes into thick slices and levitating them towards Malfoy.
subtle when it comes to Draco. Nearly everyone knows you fancy him—everyone except, perhaps, Draco. And Jesse to a certain extent.”
They worked in silence for a few moments, offering quick smiles to one another, gently pushing at the other’s shoulders, as Teddy stumbled in his haste to add more topping to the second crumble.
“Don’t worry, Teddy. Draco and I are just going to talk. Go ahead and see how lunch is coming along.” Harry relaxed his smile, rubbing his fingers reassuringly through Teddy’s hair as it returned to a vibrant turquoise. Teddy had always been abnormally attuned to Harry’s feelings, and now was not the time for him to realize that Harry doubted Malfoy’s intentions.
“Er...” Harry wrinkled his nose, a soft breath of laughter escaping him. He let go of Draco’s hand, reaching back to rub at the back of his neck instead. “Well, I thought that you two were together—after that photo in
“Well, nothing, it’s just—” Ron took a deep breath “—Teddy morphing like that. Isn’t that a bit odd?”
“Finally! Can we go

and all.”
He took a quick breath, trying to calm himself, before following Draco up the stairs. Listening to the sounds of Draco’s soft voice, rising and falling gently as he read
“Right, er...Malfoy—” Harry started, hesitating as he and Malfoy stared at one another. “I’m er... I’m sorry. For what I said.”
Draco threw his head back, exposing the long line of his throat, a loud bark of laughter escaping him—free and wholly undignified. Harry grinned as he followed in their wake, unable to take his eyes off of Draco as he laughed aloud, spinning around and wrapping his arms around Teddy before throwing the boy over his shoulders and making his way out into the garden.
“The reason that no one else danced during that waltz at the Yule Ball was because they were so hypnotized by what an absolute fool
“Harry, you have to pick something!” Teddy laughed, kicking his legs lightly against Harry’s thighs.
Harry grimaced, turning back to the sink of dirty dishes. There was one last glass to be washed, and Harry reached for it, desperate for something to do with his hands as he searched for something to say.
Harry’s ankles had already tangled between Mafloy’s as he tripped, and within moments they lost their precarious balance and fell to the floor.
The man would probably look quite intimidating, Harry thought, if not for the flush still painting the apples of his cheeks and the tips of his ears.
Harry returned Andromeda’s greeting, keeping an eye on Malfoy as he did so. Malfoy turned around and reached for a hand towel, drying his hands before folding the towel and neatly draping it over his shoulder. Harry narrowed his eyes, wondering why Malfoy didn’t just dry his hands with a spell, instead of drying them as a muggle would. It had to be beneath him, after all. Raising his gaze from the towel, Harry caught Malfoy smirking at him.
For Teddy’s sake.
Harry watched, helpless as he flew towards the boy—too far away. Teddy’s grey eyes shimmered with fear as his hands lost their grip on the training broom, arms windmilling frantically in the air as he began to fall.
“Yes, Teddy. That is precisely how apologies work.”
You don’t want this.

He spins—

He was beautiful, Harry thought.
Harry’s lips twitched as he tried to stop himself from grinning, bemused by the idea of
Crossing his arms firmly across his chest, the cloth of his shirt straining against his biceps, Malfoy narrowed his eyes once more. “So I ask you again, Potter. What are you playing at? In case it has escaped your notice, we are no longer at Hogwarts. This is not sixth year. I am not up to anything.”
Dancing the waltz alongside Malfoy felt a lot different than dancing with Parvati at the Yule Ball. He was used to tripping over his feet, stepping on his partners toes, whenever he danced. Yet Malfoy’s firm hand on his back led him gracefully through the room and Harry didn’t stumble once.
Harry inhaled sharply as Draco reached for his wand, whispering soft incantations, his wrist moving gracefully with the movements of the charms.
as Malfoy swallowed, his fingers twitching and brushing quickly up and down his trousers before settling once more at his sides.
talking about him. It was a constant stream of:
“He really wasn’t mad at me,” Teddy whispered, gently running his fingers across Gary’s back, a loud purr reverberating throughout the room.
It melts.
“You can trust me, Draco. I’ve got you.”
Lazily, Draco turned his head, one perfectly manicured blond brow lifting as he stared at Harry. His lips pursed, fighting a smile, though the dimple in his left cheek revealed his amusement.
It burns as I throw it back; as I swallow.
, Harry called it quits.
“Fuck.”
?” Harry snarled, stalking into the kitchen and making sure to block Malfoy’s access to the rest of the cottage. The ferret may already be in the house, but Harry would be damned if he let him get any further and inflict any damage.
He said it was fine.
Creatures grasp at you.
was here—when
“Because I cried, and he ran away from me,” Teddy muttered, looking down at his feet.
Harry hesitated for a moment before turning to look at Malfoy, who continued to focus on scrubbing the dirty dishes. “Er...Malfoy? Are you sure you’re okay with him leaving now?”
ask him out. I don’t know what has gotten into your heads, but...stop.”
Food in hand, Harry spun on his heels, eyes wide as he stared at the identical expressions of shock in Malfoy’s and Teddy’s faces. Teddy’s hair had morphed to a light blonde, his stormy eyes a near mirror of Malfoy’s own. Both of their lips were quirked in bewilderment, pale brows furrowed above silver eyes. Except for his youthful, tanned face, Teddy was the splitting image of Malfoy.
“But it does!” Teddy squeaked. “It’s very important. Draco
Over the past few weeks, it had become clear that Draco regularly spent Saturday mornings with Teddy, giving Andromeda time to pack for her weekend trips to France without worrying about watching her grandson. He would make lunch with Teddy, clean up, and leave all before Harry was due to arrive.
“I said,” Potter murmured, biting at your throat, “that I am going to fuck you.”
Teddy was sat on the counter, legs swinging and heels tapping against the cupboards. Tears were still streaming down his flushed cheeks, soft huffs of breath escaping as he tried to control his sobs. Next to him, Malfoy was laying out a variety of vials on the countertop, whispering words of reassurance as he did so.
For a few moments, no one spoke. The only sounds in the room were Teddy’s heavy footsteps overhead, and their soft breaths.
but Harry quickly drew a line through it. As much as he adored Luna, he knew that working at her sanctuary was not a career he wanted to pursue.
It isn’t long until you feel him…
Your eyes meet.
“Alright, Tedward. Let’s go,” Malfoy strode past Harry without a glance as they made their way back to the sitting room, Teddy talking happily on Malfoy’s hip.
After all, Harry thought, both Draco and Ginny were obviously mischievous gits who were up to no good. They would surely only cause chaos if they worked together...
Fuck.
Harry could handle this. He could win.
“Master must learn to not indulge in too much temptation with the blood traitors,” Kreacher grumbled as he placed a plate full in front of Harry.
Harry could feel his cheeks heat. He gaped stupidly at Malfoy, “What? No I don’t!”
. Running down the hallway, following the soothing voice he could hear murmuring in the distance, Harry skidded into the kitchen.
Clothes are torn from your body, cool air caressing your skin as you are pressed down, down,
, per se, but surely Harry should still be there as much as he could when Malfoy was with Teddy. Just in case, he thought.
“Yes, exactly!” Ginny exclaimed. “See? Harry, he’s different now. We all see it. And we want you to be happy, we want you to—”
“Hello,” Draco replied. A corner of his lips twitched, the dimple revealing itself in his left cheek, and Harry couldn’t help the soft huff of laughter from escaping him.
“What. Happened.” Draco spat, glaring daggers at Harry. His voice was deep, crisp, sharper and more venomous than Harry thought he had ever heard before.
Music began to echo throughout the room. It was the same ensemble that Harry had heard when he first arrived. Malfoy’s soft
Teddy’s breath stuttered as he attempted to quiet his sobs. His lower lip trembled, hands reaching to Harry, “Up, please.”
“So. That’s new...”
It had been the shortest he had lasted in any job thus far, but Harry did not regret leaving. He smelled heavily of coffee, his chest still stung from where the burning coffee had splashed against him, and it was only 10:30 am yet he had been awake since 3:00 that morning.
“You—“ Teddy stammered. “You called me
They spent the next few minutes on the side of the pitch, silent but for Ron’s occasional snickering, as Harry observed Teddy—carefully avoiding looking in the direction of Draco and Jesse.
“No…” you murmur, shaking your head. “No, I would have known. I would have
“What..? I just said he’d be cute with green eyes...” Harry started.
“Oh, certainly,” Andromeda grinned sharply, “Teddy told me all about his adventures at camp. He was quite enthusiastic about it. It sounds like it was quite the event.”
“Hey there, stranger,” Ginny greeted, striding towards Harry and jumping up to sit atop the counter.
“Yes, I do believe I understood that,” Draco said flatly. Harry hesitated before looking back at Draco, only to find the man gazing at him with amusement shining in his eyes. “Harry...If you think that I did not already know that Teddy spent Sunday mornings with the Weasleys, you are even more daft than I originally thought.”
! And I’ll prove it to you; I’ll find out what he’s doing.”
Harry!” Ginny squealed.
It was never going to be you.
Andromeda turned towards Harry, smiling warmly as she summoned the cups towards them, “Harry, my darling. We have not had a chance to speak since my return. How was your time with our dear Teddy?”
so long to be ready.
lost control?”
…Potter
Kreacher continued to complain as he left Harry’s room. Harry just stared at his wardrobe, the door cracked open forebodingly. Slowly, Harry pushed himself from the bedside table and made his way to the armoire.
The only thing that seemed real was the time he spent with his friends and with Teddy.
“Finally!” Teddy cried, scrambling from the armchair. Gary squawked, hissing his displeasure at being disturbed from his perch. “Can we go
The sudden iciness of Andromeda’s glare struck Harry, reminding him of the sisters she had distanced herself from. He had never felt that Andromeda was dangerous, but in that moment he knew that she could be just as much of a threat as any of the Black ancestors.
You hope he forgives you.
You swallow him down, relishing in the burn as he hits the back of your throat, as his fingers pull at your hair, tugging you closer, asking for
that you had to abandon Teddy? Updating your ridiculous wardrobe, perhaps?” Malfoy’s jaw was beginning to clench as he grit his teeth. “Mm, no. Nothing as mundane as that. Maybe you were out with that wizard again, hmm? I forget what the
“Ah! Merlin’s beard, it
The doors to the sitting room closed behind them and Andromeda let go of his arm, gliding towards her customary armchair and gracefully sinking into its folds. A pot of tea sat on the center of the coffee table, steam slowly rising from its spout.
“Gods, why wouldn’t I?” Harry breathed out sharply, biting back an adoring grin. “Your crumble is the best I have ever had—but do
He would begin apprenticing with Rosmerta at the Three Broomsticks tomorrow...and, surely, it would be better than working for either Neville or Hannah.
,” Harry mumbled, raising a hand to scratch at the back of his neck.
“Of course.”
Firm.
There isn’t anything in it for him…
The music swelled, and Teddy and Malfoy continued to spin around the room, slowing only as the instruments began to quiet, until all that remained was the quiet echo of the strings.
Harry caught himself glancing towards Malfoy more than he would like to admit. Now that they had agreed to be friendly towards one another, he found that he was still curious about how Malfoy interacted with Andromeda and Teddy—more so, even, than he had when he suspected the man was up to something.
“I mean...it really is quite cute,” Harry paused, considering for a moment before smiling softly. “You know, I bet he’d look adorable when he morphs like that but with green eyes.”
?” Draco’s eyes widened incredulously.
You grin, pulling him towards you.
“What do you mean?” Harry narrowed his eyes slightly as he stared across the table, watching Ron shuffle in place.
,” Harry repeated, frowning as he looked between his two best friends. There was no way Andromeda would willingly let Malfoy spend time with Teddy—let alone
you have never…
Well beyond your grasp.
, Potter?”
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, “Yeah, well. I think we all know that herbology wasn’t ever going to be something I’d be good at. I never understood plants.”
You do not tremble as you rest it against your wrist…
“I did!” Harry quickly replied, bending down to lift Teddy onto his hip. “You were brilliant, Ted!”
, too!”
Emerald eyes—furious—are watching you from across the dance floor.
towards Teddy and Andromeda. Not only had he appeared genuinely disappointed to leave their company, Teddy and Andromeda didn’t seem to want him to depart, either.
Teddy rolled his eyes, pursing his lips as his hair began to lighten. “Fine,” he grumbled, shifting on his training broom to get into position, “Can we go?”
“Draco—Are you alright?”
Draco tore his lips from Harry’s own, nipping at skin as he kissed his way down Harry’s neck. “Harry—”
Just like that first time.
With a burst of speed, they both rushed towards the lilies, Teddy’s giggles echoing throughout the garden.
Harry paused as his  fingers brushed over Teddy’s shoulders. “What?”
“You—what?” Ginny blinked, shaking her head in disbelief. “
“Yeah!” Teddy cried, “C’mon, Harry! You can cut the tomatoes.”
Draco licked his lips, taking another slow sip from his drink before setting it gently atop the table to his side.
Harry let out a deep, relieved breath as he Apparated to Andromeda’s the following weekend.
“I am washing the dishes, Potter,” he drawled, blinking innocently. “If I am washing them incorrectly, you are more than welcome to take over.”
. “You don’t need to worry.”
“Of course I do!” Teddy exclaimed, wide eyes beginning to glimmer with tears again. “Let’s go! Let’s go find Gary!”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, losing himself for a moment as he stared into the flames of the hearth. And maybe he
Fuck, fuck,
’ Was that it Malfoy, too busy fucking your latest conquest to care about your responsibilities?”
“Ouch!” Harry grimaced. “We’re going, now! I was waiting for you. There’s no need to bite me!”
“STOP!!”
The garden was silent but for Teddy’s stuttering breaths, desperately inhaling between his sobs. Harry’s gaze flickered between the three of them. Andromeda slowly raised her eyes from her grandson, her icy stare suddenly intent on Harry. Malfoy was focused solely on Teddy, his lips parted in shock.
Harry heaved a deep sigh as he Apparated back to Grimmauld Place on Saturday morning, his body aching as he tugged the apron from his body and vanished it with a wave of his hand.
As they ate, Andromeda asked how Harry’s latest venture was going, and he shrugged, flushing with embarrassment as he focused on his meal. He did not want to admit to yet another failure of a career when Malfoy was sitting directly across from him.
“You’re a Healer?”
abandoned at his feet.
. And everyone knows that is the best!” Teddy nodded to himself, sure of his place in Harry’s life. Harry chuckled; he couldn’t deny Teddy’s importance.
“With who now!?” Ron’s eyes widened as he snapped his gaze back to Harry.
“Oh!” Harry glanced away, grimacing, “Well, er...we have Sunday Brunch at the Burrow every weekend.”
“Three...two...” Harry paused, smiling as Teddy began to nearly vibrate, waiting for the countdown. “
“That’s it, Harry,” Draco rasped, biting at Harry’s jaw as his other hand began to pull at Harry’s nipples.
Ginny frowned, gazing at him quizzically. “Of course...why wouldn’t he be?”
“Of course,” Harry nodded, walking further into the room. He sat on the loveseat by Teddy, where Malfoy would remain in his peripheral vision.
“Yes. I couldn’t very well tell Teddy we couldn’t keep Gary. Not with the connection they share,” Harry shrugged, choosing not to disclose the fact that Teddy had also been rather convincing at the Menagerie.
friction.
Harry raised his eyes to meet Malfoy’s as he began to cut his own toasty, replicating the precise movements that Malfoy had made with his own meal. He dipped a triangle of his sandwich into his soup before slowly lifting it to his mouth, wrapping his lips around the parcel of food with a soft hum, never once letting his eyes part from Malfoy’s sharp gaze.
“Hey!” Teddy frowned, pouting up at Malfoy as he crossed his arms over his chest.
Harry couldn’t look away even if he wanted to.
may mean.”
You don’t hesitate.
The table was set and they all sat down—Andromeda and Teddy sitting opposite one another at the head of the table, Harry and Malfoy sitting across from each other at their sides.
Draco smirked as they stared at one another. His eyes sparkled with amusement, “It’s about time that you realized I was better than you, Potter.”
Harry’s eyebrows rose swiftly, his mouth dropping in awe, as he watched Malfoy and Teddy waltz around the room.
They were just finishing their evening meal when the sound of the Floo roared from down the hall.
Harry grimaced.
“I’ve got you.”
up to something.
“Yes!” Teddy squealed, hugging the Kneazle so tightly that it squeaked. “Did you hear that, Gary? You’re coming home!”
The fire…
“Can we practice turns?” Teddy asked. His small hands were grasping tightly to his broom, keeping it steady in the breeze that lifted him in soft waves, riding the currents in the air.
Harry’s lips curled in a soft smile as he watched Teddy race around on his training broom. Ron and George hovered on either side of the gardens, guarding their improvised Quidditch posts, while Ginny and Draco darted around him, feinting one way and then another as they tried to distract the boy from his goal. Jesse was watching closely from the ground, ready to attend any injury that may be inflicted.
Teddy shifted excitedly from one foot to the other. He reached eagerly for his broom and swiftly mounted it, smiling proudly when he did not need Harry’s help.
Harry’s eyes snapped open, “Shit, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to—”
Harry and Draco stood in silence for a moment, listening to the
“Yes,” He nodded once, crossing his arms over his chest. “And he is going to call me Harry. That’s what Teddy calls us, and we want to make sure that Teddy knows he doesn’t need to worry us about fighting. This makes sense.”
. What in Merlin’s name could he be doing? Instincts or not, it’s not as if he has the means to coordinate any sort of intervention.”
hell, they act like George and Ron do with one another, more often than not. They are certainly
She thought Teddy wanted to—instinctively—do what he could to make Harry happy? He huffed in bemusement, placing a quick kiss to Teddy’s forehead as he pulled the boy against him in a quick hug.
“What’s his excuse, Andy? He doesn’t have one—" Harry began, cut off by a snort of disdain.
“That’s probably because he hasn’t been caught yet! Have the Aurors even been looking at him lately?”
“You say that he is morphing without the ability to control it, correct?” At Harry’s stiff nod, Hermione hummed. “Well, what if it was not strictly uncontrolled? What if these morphs were instinctual in some way?”
Softer, perhaps. Genuine. It seemed as if every time Harry saw him with Teddy, he saw more of this side of Draco—patience and adoration evident in everything that he did.
“Yes, yes. I need Healer Malfoy. Now.” Harry dismissed any pleasantries. He did not have time for them. They needed Draco.
“He‘ll be back this weekend, Gary. It’s just you and me, now.” Harry sighed, running a hand over the Kneazle’s small head as he made his way out of the room and up to bed.
“Oh, right. Of course,” Harry nodded, shoving his fists into the pockets of his jeans and looking away, focusing his gaze on his godson instead.
Teddy opened his mouth widely, taking a deep breath as if preparing for a long winded story, when Draco quickly interrupted him, rushing over to place a gentle hand on Teddy’s shoulder.
“Ready?” Harry asked, glancing towards Teddy as he readied himself. “Three...two...
“Good,” Andromeda smiled, approaching him slowly. As she stopped in front of him, she raised her hand and caressed his cheek. They stared into one another’s eyes for a few seconds, considering each other, before Andromeda spoke again. “Do not hurt him.”
Silver eyes glinted with a challenge as they stared back at Harry. He clenched his jaw tightly, fists held tightly at his sides. Of course he had a problem with that. What gave Malfoy the nerve to intrude upon Andromeda and Teddy’s quiet home, bringing who knows what kind of darkness with him?
Draco tilted his head, narrowing his eyes as he scoffed at Harry, “Potter...he
“So, Andy said that you’ve been spending more time with them on Saturday mornings.”
!” Ginny rolled her eyes, jumping down from her perch on the counter. She folded her arms across her chest and leaned against it, instead, watching Harry carefully. “Seriously, though, Harry. What’s going on? No one has heard from you all week.”
After all, he had grown up with nothing but stern. He did not want Teddy to ever experience what he had. And yet...well. Perhaps he could be slightly more firm...only sometimes, of course.
Harry looked around the room. Andromeda observed the three silently by the hearth as she prepared for her departure. Draco’s jaw was clenched, his porcelain skin paler than it normally was as he waited for Harry’s response. Teddy shifted anxiously on his toes, bouncing up and down, a constant plea escaping his lips, “Please, oh please, please,
Which was nothing, Harry noted, rolling his eyes with a bemused smirk, since Malfoy had wiped the wrong side of his face.
Andromeda hummed, her thin lips twitching as she lifted her book, gaze settling onto the yellowed pages. “Teddy and Draco are in the kitchen.”
Harry’s eyes roamed over Draco’s body, spread wantonly across the armchair. Gods, but he looked absolutely
But Ginny was right...
Desperate for
It was not as if Harry had planned on saying no, anyway. But with Teddy looking at him so earnestly, desperate to experience his first Quidditch Camp, Harry had quickly agreed not only to enroll him in the day camp, but also to purchase his first training broom so that he could begin to practise at home.
Teddy laughed, wrapping his arms tightly around Harry’s neck as they made their way into the Burrow, the warmth of food and love enveloping them immediately upon crossing the threshold.
“I do, but...I really want to see Gary,” Teddy mumbled. He shuffled back and forth for a moment before stammering, “Draco...? Would you mind if I went to see Gary now?”
Malfoy moved so elegantly it looked as if he were dancing on clouds, Teddy giggling along for the ride as they swayed to the music. The two paid no attention to Harry as they focused on their choreography, gliding across the floor completely in tune with the melodious song resonating throughout the room.
“I finished work early, figured I would come straight here,” Harry turned his gaze back to Andromeda, offering a sheepish smile. He normally didn’t arrive at her cottage until just before she left for France.
. The more he thought about it, the more Harry realized Andromeda often had tedious requests for him when he first arrived;
They were so eager for Harry to find his career, having both found something that they were passionate about so soon after the war, while Harry had struggled to find his place. He forced a grin, raising his Firewhisky in acquiesce.
You frown, looking at the tea placed in front of you.

Hermione smiled fondly at Ron. “Yes, like us. And all of your family.”
Malfoy startled slightly, as if he had only just realized that Harry was there. He slowly deposited Teddy on the ground with a subtle nudge of his shoulder, pushing him gently towards Andromeda before turning to look straight at Harry.
Hermione reached across the table to gently touch Harry’s hand, as if comforting a distraught child. “Harry, are you sure this isn’t like sixth year? You’ve been between jobs again. Are you certain this isn’t just a way for you to fill your time?”
Andromeda hummed, nodding her head, bright gaze set firmly upon Harry. “Ah, yes. And how did that go?”
“Alright, my dear,” Andromeda said soothingly, “Draco is quite competent, of course. I trust that he healed Teddy’s bruises with the utmost professionalism and care.”
Hermione laughed lightly, “I asked you if you are looking forward to helping Rosmerta?”
“Are you kidding, Ronald?” Ginny snickered. “Merlin, Harry wouldn’t last a
“Shh.”
The Prophet
“Of course. Why am I not surprised that Ronald will be late?” Draco drawled as Ginny let out a loud bark of laughter.
“Alright...” Harry nodded slowly, fingers itching to reach out and hold Draco’s hand in his own again.
As Harry observed the camp, his eyes caught on Teddy, who was flying circles around the other children—quite literally. He handled his training broom with such finesse that it was clear he had an innate talent...or he had practiced for far longer than Harry had helped him.
He was good with Teddy. Maybe he was also good
. Cousin Draco knows that it is! He can show you!”
“Tedward, Harry didn’t—”
“So you can just
His fingers twisted in the sheets and he turned his face into the pillow, trying to stifle his moans as Draco masterfully rolled his hips, working his way in to the hilt. When he finally paused, balls resting heavily against Harry’s arse, Harry shuddered. Draco let out a shaky breath, running a hand soothingly along Harry’s back and leaning forward to press an open-mouthed kiss against Harry’s sweaty neck.
“What if...” Teddy began slowly, fingers twisting around the Kneazle’s tail. “What if we kept him at your house?”
You hum, eyes flickering as his voice washes over you.
To you.
“Haven’t you read
He was shocked, that much Harry knew. After all...they had only just shook hands, agreeing to be friendly towards one another. Perhaps referring to Malfoy by his given name was one step too far.

Harry and George watched as Teddy skipped over to the display, gently reaching out to pet the small creatures. After a few quiet moments, George raised a questioning brow at Harry.
who was up to something. And yet here you are. You go from hating me one moment to—what?—asking after my career?”
“Harry, no.” Draco shook his head once, firmly. “It’s in the past. We have both changed since then...” Draco looked away, eyeing the exit, as he swallowed. “Unless this changes things for you. I would understand if it reminds you of our pasts, or if you realized you did not want—”

The fucking
“Come on, Draco...” Harry tugged at Draco’s shoulder so that he lay on his back, propping himself over Draco and leaning down to suckle at Draco’s throat. “It’s early...plenty of time until breakfast—until Teddy wakes up. I want to—”
But I have spent enough time on my knees.
Draco gasped, dropping his head and biting into Harry’s shoulder as his hips stuttered. Harry could feel the warm rush of Draco’s release and he groaned, grinding himself back on Draco’s cock. He released his grasp from Draco’s hair, one hand intertwining with Draco’s on his cock as he chased his own climax.
“Oh, shut it, you prat,” Harry chuckled, kicking his pants away before jumping back onto the bed and tackling Draco.

Andromeda hummed softly, peering at him speculatively before pronouncing, “Bon appétit.”
A sudden heat roared through Harry’s gut as he stared at the image, watching raptly as Malfoy repeatedly leaned towards the strange man.
“Yes!” Teddy nodded firmly, widening his eyes excitedly. “Draco wouldn’t let me, but you will! Please, Harry? Can we fly higher?”
You leave.

My mark is against his skin.
Malfoy scoffed, one pale eyebrow quirked in disbelief as he stared blankly at Harry. “Right.”
“Oh my
“Draco is teaching me how to waltz!” Teddy smiled, eyes shining with excitement as he looked up at Harry, nearly vibrating out of his skin. “Watch,
he suddenly was.
“Alright, alright,” Harry laughed, sparing one last glance to the kitchen.
Harry could feel his face heating as they all watched him. Clearing his throat awkwardly, he turned to watch as Teddy chased George around the yard, laughing uproariously as George stumbled, allowing for Teddy to tackle him to the ground.
“Wow,” Teddy gasped.
“No, no. Thank you, Luna, I’m fine.”
Andromeda could do little more than smirk before the door to the sitting room burst open and Teddy ran towards them in a whirlwind of excitement.
“Draco helped me practise my morph again this morning!” Teddy squealed. “I can do something else, now!”
Standing up, Harry listened for any sign that the creature was on his way to the sitting room. The halls remained quiet, no indication of paws padding across hardwood floors, and Harry rolled his eyes. The Kneazle was certainly a Black—overdramatic and stubborn.
It can’t
“Yeah. We are,” He drew back slowly, wishing desperately that it was true.
Draco’s words staked him in place. Harry felt frozen in fear, unable to breathe. Harry thought his entire body might burst into flames, hot hope licking over his skin.
godson.” Teddy pulled back and squinted suspiciously at Harry, as if Harry were hiding something from him.
You cry out as he bites at your nipple, paying no attention to the shirt covering it.
“Only if you are ready for bed within the next five minutes,” Draco replied.
Draco softened his voice, smiling reassuringly at Teddy. “No, Tedward. I did not stay in the guest room.”
But no one hears you.
“Teddy!” she cried, resting a hand gently atop Teddy’s shoulders, eyes wide as she stared apologetically between Draco and Harry. “I am so sorry—he ran out before I could stop him!”
They’ll know better, now.
But it wasn’t love, really, was it?
Malfoy froze, eyes widening as he stared back at Harry. Harry could see Teddy grinning to his side, looking back and forth between his cousin and godfather, but he could not tear his own gaze from Malfoy’s.
“It doesn’t surprise me!” Harry said quickly, shrugging when Draco raised a questioning brow towards him. “You’re...er...well, you’re good...with Teddy. And other things...so I’m sure you’re good at this.”
“Are you sure about that, Harry?”
A few hours passed before Harry heard the Floo roar to life. He was in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner, while Teddy changed into his pajamas upstairs. He had taken to washing dishes the muggle way again, but at the sound of a voice calling out from the sitting room, Harry threw a quick charm at the sink so that the dishes would finish cleaning themselves.
Harry’s hands were suspended over Teddy, trembling as he stared at his hurt godson, unsure of how he could fix him when he wasn’t sure what was wrong.
“Good heavens, Teddy. You would think you hadn’t just spent an entire week with your godfather,” Andromeda chided, though there was amusement clear in her voice.
“Potter, what—“
“Alright...how about a rematch, then?” Harry raised an eyebrow, smirking at Teddy. He nodded towards a bed of lilies. “First to reach the lilies and then come back to the lemon tree wins.”

He hadn’t realized until the past few months how he had merely been
“Yeah,” Harry murmured, finally tearing his eyes away from where Jesse had reached out and rested his hand on Ginny’s forearm.
Messy ebony curls—
he learned it from Malfoy—before placing his hands on his hips and glaring up at the two adults, “You don’t think it is useful. Probably because you don’t know
Pressing against you.
Harry frowned, trying to catch Ginny’s gaze to no avail. “Why? Why should I ask Draco when you
Draco nodded towards Andromeda, “I will see you next week.”
“There’s guest rooms. Here. If you wanted one—to stay the night, that is. Er...I’m sure Teddy would love it if you were here when he wakes up.”
Harry smiled quickly towards Andromeda as Teddy’s small hand grasped his own and began to pull him towards the sitting room.
“It’s alright, Draco,” Potter soothes, running this fingers through your hair. You cannot help the groan that rumbles from you at the feeling, as he grips your hair and
Draco laughed, smooth as treacle, and Harry shivered at the sound, his fingers twitching at his side, aching to reach out.
A small hand tugged lightly at Harry’s shirt, and Harry startled as he looked down to see Teddy staring up at him, turquoise hair glimmering in the early afternoon sun and silver eyes sparkling. “Is the soup ready, Harry?”
“What?” He asked, clutching the tomatoes and bacon defensively to his chest.

As Andromeda began to
“Teddy—” Harry sighed, watching as his godson’s eyes began to fill with tears, hair bleaching of all color to a striking platinum. He squeezed his own eyes tightly, trying to block the desperate image.
On Saturday morning, Harry awoke determined to catch Malfoy in the act.
Harry felt bereft as if something—or someone—were missing. He kept looking to his side, hoping to see a blond head standing next to him, only to turn back to the pitch disappointed.
“Yes. If you must know,
thing!”
Jesse knew that Harry fancied Draco. He was glaring at him so much during the Quidditch Camp, how could he not have known Harry wanted the man’s boyfriend? Ginny, however, shushed him before he could do more than squeak.
Harry reached out, gently tracing the dimple that appeared in Draco’s cheeks, as he quietly replied, “Hello.”
Draco huffed an amused breath against Harry’s neck. “Alright, then.”
Harry scrambled off of Draco, nearly tripping out of the bed as he pulled his shirt over his head and unbuttoned his jeans, shimmying out of his jeans before bending over and tugging his pants to the floor.
Ginny reached out, gently clasping Harry’s elbow and leading him to the kitchen table. They took a seat, Ginny pulling a chair directly in front of Harry’s so that she could hold his hand between her own, as she took a deep breath, “Harry...I promise you, Jesse is
As he finished his recollections, Harry took a deep breath, looking between his friends expectantly, waiting for them to respond in astonishment.
Teddy sighed, kicking briefly at the ground in his frustration, before looking back at Malfoy. “Okay...but you
Malfoy turned his head slowly, platinum blonde hair glowing in the light shining through the window, before raising an eyebrow and meeting Harry’s eyes defiantly.
“What are you doing—!?”
Harry put on a burst of speed, the likes of which he did not think he had ever matched before, in an effort to reach Teddy in time.
“Oh, right...” Harry nodded dumbly. Clearing his throat, Harry turned back to Teddy. “Sorry, Ted. Dra—er, Malfoy’s right. Crumble comes after lunch.”
He reached for his wand, waving it over himself, smiling gently at Teddy as the healing charm took effect, the deep bruises showing on his porcelain skin immediately beginning to fade.
“No!” Harry pushed his chair away from the table, standing abruptly and glaring down at his friends. “No, this is not an
Ginny heaved a deep breath. “Harry—” she started, looking firmly into his eyes, “—will you join us in running a monthly Quidditch Camp? As a job. That you will be paid for.”
Bending at his hips, Draco leaned down to press a kiss to the crown of Teddy’s head, then turned on his heels and strode gracefully from the room.
. A curse? No…
Within moments, they were standing in the lobby of St. Mungo’s, clean white walls glimmering around them, Healers and patients rushing through the hallways.
I fear—
“Honestly, Harry. You should pay attention to these things! The case was not relevant, but the inherent hierarchy that they were contesting is.”
“Teddy...” Harry started, speaking softly as he turned fully to face his godson.
Not now.
I inhale sharply, watching him dance, catching his eye.
Malfoy’s hand was surprisingly warm, his grip firm. For a moment, Malfoy’s gaze was focused solely on their clasped hands, holding still between them, before the silver irises flickered up to meet Harry’s.
Gentle.
“We’re pregnant!”
“What in Merlin’s name are you wearing, Potter?” Malfoy spluttered.
“But Harry...Uncle Ron says that you watched Draco all the time back at Hogwarts,” Teddy said, wide eyes gazing at Harry with feigned innocence. Harry had no idea what his godson was playing at, but he didn’t like it.
Draco blinked slowly, bright silver eyes boring into Harry.
“That’s too bad, Tedward,” Harry replied, ignoring when he saw Draco stiffen at his side upon hearing the nickname. “It’s time for bed. Maybe Draco will even read you a story—since he does it so much better than I do, after all.”
But it didn’t matter what he wanted, Harry reminded himself. He needed to focus on Teddy, and how important it was to him that both his godfather and cousin were by his side during his first Quidditch Camp. He and Draco had just started getting along, and Harry could already see how happy it made Teddy. He promised himself that he wouldn’t let his feelings for Draco get in the way of that.
The elderly man grinned as he watched Teddy with his new familiar. “So his name is Gary, is it?”
“Come along, Potter,” Draco whispered from the hallway, teasing.
Well, fuck it.
Harry blinked, staring uncomprehendingly at the entrance to the sitting room. Everything, from the moment he arrived at the cottage this morning to dancing with Malfoy to this very moment, made no sense. He felt as if he must surely be dreaming, because how could any of this had actually happened?
A sharp knock on the bathroom door startled Harry, and he slipped in his effort to push himself from the shower wall.
, Harry!”
With a quick shake of his head, dismissing his sudden confusion, Harry made his way to the kitchen to make some hot cocoa—Teddy’s favorite drink before bed. He summoned three mugs, carefully pouring the sweet drink into each, before making his way upstairs, the mugs of cocoa floating behind him.
