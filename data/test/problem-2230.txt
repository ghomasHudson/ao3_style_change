As it turns out, the Forbidden Forest isn’t nearly as scary when there isn’t a racist, maniacal, sadistic split-souled madman on the loose trying to kill you and everyone you love.
“I’m going to eat you out.” Harry says, slipping Draco’s legs over his own shoulders. Draco whimpers.
, by the way, and we sort of just. Stared at each other. For a bit, actually. And he noticed the rain had stopped, and then Ron knocked.”
Mrs. Weasley squeaks when the statue begins marching off, pulling out what looks like a little stone flute and playing a tune Harry doesn’t recognise.
Harry understands that, and he wonders if Malfoy’ll go back to playing regularly once the cabinet’s fixed and Narcissa Malfoy has been rescued.
“Shh.” Malfoy says, hand groping Harry’s neck and shoulder until he finds Harry’s mouth and covers it.
Harry smiles, withdrawing his fingers and glancing around the room for a towel or old tshirt to wipe his hands off on.
“I don’t think you’ve learned your lesson.” Alpha says. “You need to remember that eating only makes your hole disgusting, and you’re only useful as a hole.”
“And? You don’t need for me to be hard to fuck me. Won’t take long for me to get it up again anyway.”
“What do you mean, you’re not staying? Where are you going?” Harry demands, slouching against the wall outside Potions whilst they wait to go inside for class.
As Harry brought them closer to the winding road leading up, Malfoy shifted in his seat again, sitting on the top of the backrest whilst clutching the door and windshield.
“I’ll bring in Neville and Harry if I have to.” Ron says, crossing his arms with an impressive air of authority. Smith looks at Harry.
“Not really.” Harry shrugs. “I started living there after the war because it was already mine and it has protections on it that made me feel safe. But living there reminds me of staying there whilst Sirius - my godfather, your cousin - was alive. He died during our Fifth year.”
“Or what? I think Harry Potter could find another job. And even if I couldn’t… I’m married to a Malfoy.” Harry says, and Ron shrugs in agreement.
Draco doesn’t back down, though the tears fall down his cheeks. That alone is its own defiance, Harry knows Alpha didn’t allow crying.
He marches straight over to the man in the violet shirt, pausing just before he’s within his eyeline and adjusting his demeanor appropriately. He knows how to switch tactics on a dime, learned it from a very young age from his father.
Harry feels like if Malfoy tried touching him now, he’d explode. He wouldn’t even come, he’d just blow up entirely like a bomb was set off.
“But I may as well have.” Draco runs a finger along the raised skin on his arm, disrupting the scabs. “I’ve never killed anyone, but I stood by and let it happen. I’m the one who let the killers into the school. It may as well have been me.”
Draco shifts to lay on top of Harry, his thigh resting over Harry’s morning wood. Harry wonders if he’ll acknowledge it again.
“Y-yes-” The Furby crackles, one eye twitching so it halfway blinks, then opens again, then halfway blinks, then opens. It’s horrifying and pitiful.
“I did. He took them off to sleep last night and didn’t put them back on in the morning. I don’t think he was allowed to redress after his act was done. He was dressed when I left for here, though.”
“No, bisexual.” Harry corrects. “I don’t think I need to ask you if you are, considering you’d gone to the club.” He points out. Zabini shrugs.
“Oh hey.” Harry laughs, lifting the blankets for him to get settled. Draco’s little white face pokes out.
“We don’t use real names for the performers. It’s a false identity, it protects you. Archie’s real name is something else, but that’s what we call him to keep things straight. You’re Asher now, get used to it. Don’t use your real name on the floor, you’ll regret it.”
“It’s not quite like that. And anyway, you’ve never spoken to her. Would you pass me that cloak, please? He’s very heavy and I can’t get the covers free.”
“Go away, I’m busy.” Harry says shortly, gesturing vaguely to his erection. Draco hisses, but turns and leaves, strutting away angrily. Harry hears him going down the stairs, then shuts the door and returns to his business.
Draco scoffs, looking at Harry with the same look he’d had when Harry had asked about tshirts back when they’d first bonded.
“That makes sense.” Harry says, knowing Skeeter would probably be able to tell the glaring differences in Draco now versus Draco at fourteen, when she knew him. The less press about Draco, the better. “You did this, though?”
“That’s very generous of you, George.” Harry says with a smile. George nods, walking back over to Draco.
“Yeah, I figured.” Draco says with a weak smile, gesturing to his attire. “Will you be around here today or might you visit Daphne?”
“I’m sorry for not telling you before. You’re allowed to use anything in this house, soap, shampoo, paper, towels, clothes, blankets, food, dishes, whatever you want, even if I didn’t name it just now. You can use anything, you don’t have to wait for permission. Okay?”
“You called me ‘sweetheart.’” Draco says. He grabs his notebook from where it was tucked under his own pillow.
Harry shuffles closer, wrapping his arms around Draco’s. Draco lowers his cheek to rest against Harry’s forehead.
“That’s really good! I know bad things seem to chase you, but maybe this is a good thing overall. I mean, obviously for
“Yes.” Draco looks up from the pillow. Harry can only see his eyes and nose again, the rest of his body is wrapped up in his soft red blanket.
Malfoy turns his face a bit so his hand covers his eyes, and Harry finds it inexplicably cute to see Malfoy embarrassed by his mum.
While the kettle is heating up, Harry brings the bag of chocolate from the side table and puts them all into a box, which he leaves on the table in front of the seat Draco usually sits in.
“Is that why you thought I was disappointed in you when I said I wasn’t going to fuck you tonight?” Harry asks from behind his palms.
He whispers through tears. Hermione frowns, but takes Draco’s arm, not removing the bandage, but healing through it. Draco scowls at it as the blood fades.
“Yes, I know.” Malfoy says dryly. Harry smirks. “Well after Honeydukes, I usually like to pop into Gladrags, Scrivenshaft’s and of course, Zonko’s to round out the trip.”
Malfoy grimaces, adjusting his shorts and picking up his shirt from the counter. Ever since they started living in muggle London, he’s begun dressing more and more convincingly muggle. It’s a bit weird to see, but Harry can’t say it doesn’t suit him.
She has to use a Sonorus to call everyone back inside for lunch, and the Weasleys Jr. arrive just as they’re sitting down.
So Harry gets out of the tub, dripping green-tinged water everywhere, and closes the bathroom door behind himself.
"How could they think he's done this on purpose? Upton said he'd put it in his report, that he's just as innocent as you!" She says. "I mean, he's obviously not the same as he was. You know that Board I'm on? The muggleborn initiative I was anonymously asked to head?"
“Alright fine, but you’ve got to get to sleep soon or you’ll be useless tomorrow. We need you well rested, especially you, Harry.” Neville says, setting Malfoy back down on the sink.
Potter came by midmorning with a cup of coffee and a plate of bacon and eggs from the kitchen, but Draco's distracted.
“Of the two of us, I have far more brain damage, so I doubt it’s that.” Draco says lightly, holding up his trembling hands to glare at them for their betrayal. “Have you heard of asexuality?"
“I pretty much just told him not to have kids.” Draco mutters, tossing his billfold onto the dresser and toeing off his shoes. “I mean, we could’ve done a full diagnostic set and brought in a cursebreaker to sort it, but the patient didn’t want to be put under for that long.”
“I know, there’s nothing stopping me from just Apparating to the coast, but it feels like cheating somehow, like if you’re going to the sea you have to do the work to get there or something.”
“Give me that.” Draco says blandly, snatching Potter’s crumpled shirt from where it’s balled up in his hands. “If you tear mine, I’ll hex your bollocks.”
Harry lays back down, pulling Draco close and interlocking their legs so Harry’s thigh rests against his crotch. His hand cups Draco’s arse.
Greyback let out a menacing growl, and Harry instinctively lifted his arms to protect himself from the bared, bloodstained teeth.
“You could get a line along your spine, I've seen that before. Or your chest - collar bones or sternum.”
“That’s okay. Do you need your punishment?” He offers. Draco nods. “I don’t know what rule you broke.”
“Harry did come out of there looking like he’d just been properly snogged.” She agreed. “I’m sure it will be fine. Many people are still rather intimidated by Harry from what happened at the beginning of last term, they won’t come after you or anything.”
“I gave you a potion the first time you were here, but it only prolonged the effects of the injection they gave you so it wore off more slowly. You had a higher dosage than I thought, that’s why it didn’t work right. Lust potions make you crave touch, and depending on the type and strength, they can make you lose rational thought. But they’re highly addictive, and very illegal. I wish we knew how long you were given them.”
Harry looks beyond the door to see a body with red hair and a look of laughter on his still face lying on a table. The air around him looks foggy.
“What are you doing here?” Malfoy asks, righting the basket he’d knocked over and pushing a variety of what look like bugs back into it.
Harry stares in bewilderment as Malfoy shuts his eyes, turning in a circle as he speaks under his breath again. He really looks like a fairy, right now, with the wind tousling his hair and the red and orange leaves swirling around him.
“Have at it. I love having my hair played with.” Harry agrees easily, settling himself more comfortably and closing his eyes.
“Can’t wait, can you, Potter? Good thing there isn’t class today.” Draco teases, helping him get it off. He removes his trousers as well before starting to undress Harry.
“Yeah… I mean, I think we have. We haven’t talked about it or anything but I would call us friends. He gave me his wand because mine broke in the fight.”
“I like the way they look.” Malfoy says, shrugging. “And why not? I can take them out anytime I get tired of them.”
Harry has no idea how Draco had identified what ‘the wrong spot’ had been, much less where the right spot would be.
“We’re all sort of in the same boat. From what I’ve heard, most of them chose to believe he had a room and board deal with Adams and Thorn that got out of hand sometimes.” Jack says bitterly. “That’s what happens when you hire London’s low life, they know there’s nowhere else to go. All that’s important is survival.”
“Emergency?” He asks, moving to the sink to wash up. He works very hard to walk normally, even as every muscle protests.
“Okay. That’s what I meant, before. You may like to remember things, and it will be easier when you don’t have your head full of other things that scare you to forget.”
Harry’s head felt foggy with the sensation, even as concentrated to his foot as it was, and he wondered how Draco was feeling. He set his foot experimentally against the bulge in Draco’s shorts, lightly pressing. Draco moaned, his eyes fluttering closed and his hips thrusting against Harry’s foot once, twice.
“Hope your hair’s firmly attached-” Harry warned, grabbing a handful and using it to keep Draco’s head in place.
“Yeah. We had been friends a long time. You were my favourite of the group, you were always really funny. Everyone liked you, you were very popular outside the Golden Circle.”
Draco almost enjoys the eeriness, now that he has Harry’s hand in his for the scary bits and as many kisses as he wants.
Harry doesn’t stop when his voice starts cracking from overuse. He continues when his tongue feels dry as a desert. He keeps going as his eyelids droop.
“But- why only tomorrow?” Draco asks. “You should- should find a potion that always lowers effects, not just for tomorrow. What about the day after tomorrow?”
“When we were in school together, we weren’t friends. We fought all the time. One of the last years we were there, I cursed you while we were fighting. I didn’t know what the curse did then, but it cut you. Cut your chest open, every scar. There were more cuts that I guess didn't leave scars. On your neck and face. A professor named Snape healed you before you died. I’m so sorry.” Harry’s chest tightened remembering Draco bleeding out on the floor. He’d regretted it then, but now, he regrets it even more.
Once the elves have decided they’ve sufficiently expressed their joy, they disappear again, and Draco looks at Harry.
Harry looks up, catching Mrs. Weasley looking abruptly away from him and busying herself with already perfectly folded fabric serviettes.
“Yeah, me too.” Harry says. “Considering my track record along with the Falcons’, there must be a bet going around about how injured I’ll be mid-season.”
Harry is mentally talking himself up to sliding his hand from Malfoy’s back down to his arse when Hermione bursts into the room.
"So, George. I think maybe George and Fred never told anyone about this. They said they would but never mentioned when. And they likely thought I'd never give it away given that most everyone they know hates me."
“Alright, I’ll get out then. If you pull out the stopper that you’re sitting on, the tub will drain. Then you can shower.”
“Would you like a cup of tea, Potter? Sandwich? I was just about to wash Draco’s hair for him. Might be nice if you stuck around to chat. I’m so dreadfully dull sometimes. One can hardly expect me to keep up with the kids these days.”
Scrolling back, Harry finds a post from Halloween. Malfoy had dressed up for the occasion, muggle-style, though it was most likely just an excuse for him to put on a costume.
“You’d know if I was drowning. I did some reading on the bond after we met with Hermione, and evidently, if either of us had a serious injury or was close to death, the other would feel it.”
Draco tucks his face into Harry’s neck, sniffling quietly. Harry holds him close, rubbing his arms gently.
That was no more than a few hours before Draco had been taken. That must’ve been why Draco started trusting Harry, it’d just happened. It was his last real memory of Harry.
take care of her, and you’ve done a great job with it. You can’t change how your father sees you, or how he treats you. And if that means you don’t visit them anymore, that’s more important than inheriting their money.”
Last thing! I realised yesterday that The Secret Garden would make a cool AU/crossover and took it upon myself to write it. I'm considering posting it as a one shot or something maybe but idk? Would you guys be interesting in reading that?
“Why? You want Malfoy in a collar with your name on it?” Neville asks with a glint in his eye that Harry doesn’t like.
Not intentionally, on either of their parts. But Goyle’s dot on the map is usually quite far from Malfoy’s.
Alone in the room with Draco, Harry’s mind runs through a circle of thoughts, mainly featuring a variety of curses to bring the club owners to justice.
“Master Draco gives Peppy and the elves more credit than we deserve. Master Draco found how to do it all himself, but he wasn’t strong enough magically. Peppy tried to have him eat more, but he was very difficult.”
Even Lucius's appearance did not ruin the fun, though his curt 'evening' and vague nod at the room while he steadfastly refused to make eye contact with anyone was certainly weird, though expected.
“Well… yeah, sometimes. I mean, I bought the waffle maker when I was a bit drunk, but I didn’t get around to using it until Draco. But I would make scones anytime one of my friends came over for breakfast or tea.”
“Ah, the elusive silver gown I’ve yet to see.” Harry perks up. “I’ll get some dark blue robes to go with it.”
“I don’t know much about him but he did heal my hand in under two seconds when I cut it on a box cutter last week- please welcome for his first ever Truth or Dare night, our new healer, Draco Malfoy!”
He nearly drops the jar of valerian when Potter steps right up behind him - would have, if not for Potter's big hand closing around Draco's fingers and guiding the jar back to the counter.
“Alright,” Brutus says, looking rather tickled. He stands beside Draco and together they survey the room. “The thing is, I’m fairly large myself, it’ll take a lot for me to get drunk. Knox is built like an ox, Willows may not be very big but he holds his alcohol surprisingly well. Prott can drink like a yank, and I know he barely says a word but Crane once drank an entire bottle of vodka in an hour and still managed to walk in a straight line at the end of the night. Scarrow... well, it's hard to tell when he's drunk because he always acts like he is, but he can and will drink any amount of anything.”
Malfoy laughs, taking off his shoes and socks, selecting a pair of deep green snakeskin heels. He slips them on easily, using Harry’s shoulder to help balance.
“And unfortunately, you still won’t get an answer, we should rejoin the gala. There could be other suspects around.”
“Hm, you say that now…” Draco mutters. “Oh sure, this is fine. ‘Pick up a random book and read it in the most sexy voice you can manage.’”
“Where does the rest of it go?” Harry asks, dutifully following her instructions and rather pleased when it looks reasonably even.
Their whole history - the curses, name calling, rivalry, fights - all flash through Draco’s mind, and he wonders if he’d been nicer in the robe shop… Maybe it would all have been different.
going to tell you. At the right time. It just- It never quite seemed like the right time, you know?” George offers.
“That’s alright, you can be quite close with someone without it being romantic. I was very close with Pansy before school, even fairly affectionate though we were never romantic.”
Harry wouldn’t have thought that far in advance, but was now faced with the notion that Malfoy had slept with a man in a female body but still being a man in his head.
“You have the subtlety of a Hippogriff in heat.” Malfoy says as he fusses with the utensils in the drawer. “Yes, I’ve got a friend who obliges me occasionally.”
“Don’t freak out.” She whispers. Before Harry can ask why, she’s pulled away, leaning up on her toes to kiss him.
Draco is forever grateful he’s gotten his blushing reflex under control, otherwise this would be humiliating.
Harry knows he hasn’t been to one of these stuffy events since before the war, and despite his spoken disdain for them, he’ll be buying dress robes on their lunch break and pestering Harry to get his own.
He’s gotten used to falling asleep with the lights on, he’s gotten used to Draco’s little snores. He wonders if he’ll ever sleep as well without them.
“Alright, fine.” Malfoy sighs, cut off when Harry knocks at the doorway, despite it being open. “Potter? What are you doing here?”
The door opened, and a different man came in. He was handsome, Draco noted vaguely through his blurred vision.
“You’re starting to get the hang of it.” Malfoy says, teasingly but clearly pleased. “Get violet, though, it goes better with your eyes and skin tone.”
“Not 17?” Malfoy asks. Harry frowns. Malfoy is about the same age as him, doesn’t he know his own age?
“I did my healer training on the Continent, in Belgium. We had a break so a few of the other trainees and I went to Paris.”
“Okay, you don’t have to answer me directly, just-” Harry pauses. He grabs a biro lying on the table, holding it up to Draco, who takes it in his mouth, looking confused.
Harry and Malfoy went to a different furniture store considering the usual one was halfway across the city. This one was much smaller, closer to a woodshop with a storefront.
“Would you like to see?” Malfoy asks hesitantly. Harry hasn’t heard him so unsure of himself in a long time.
While his friends returned to the conversation, Harry kept watching the dancer. He’s graceful, lithe, and when he unbuttons his shirt to fall dangerously over his shoulders, his collar bones make Harry’s throat feel dry.
He runs into Blaise Zabini near the Slytherin common room entrance. Zabini gives him a confused look.
“Having spent the entirety of my time at Hogwarts as Mister Potter’s close friend, I can assure you all that he and Draco Malfoy had a turbulent, antagonistic relationship. But after the Battle of Hogwarts, Mister Potter has had no contact with Draco Malfoy until the day he was sent to Malfoy Manor to sort through the room of cursed things, at the Ministry’s command.
“No, I visited the reserve a few times when he first started, but I was apprenticed at a charms shop and still convinced I was woefully heterosexual, so I didn’t consider the reserve as an option until my 20’s. Planned on getting married to a nice young man and having a litter of offspring. But I met Luv at work, because she was a regular, and all those happy, suburban, parent-pleasing goals went right out the window, and here we are.”
Tonks enters the hospital with her mother supporting her. She collapsed onto a bed, sobbing, and Harry’s heart sank as he guessed what had happened.
"A lie is different. If you ask if I am alright, and I say I am okay, but I am not okay, that is something I don't mean. If you ask if I am alright and I say yes, that is a lie."
“Draco, you probably sleep a lot because your body is still in recovery and that takes a lot of energy. Do you get tired easily, like by using stairs or walking around for a bit?”
to be the embarrassed one between the two of us.” He says, nodding to Ron and Neville before pulling Harry out the door.
“Yeah, I know. Why is Blaise here? And why are you here? I thought you guys were doing something this morning.”
“I was just kicking him out.” Draco lies, seeing the hurt flash across Potter’s features. “I- I mean, he followed me in because he- he thought I was ill, but I was seeing him out before I- before I go to the library.”
“You’re right. Okay, I’ll be right back, we can get this blasted thing done. I’ll write so you don’t have to disturb Draco.”
“Well naturally, I imagine having spent so much time with the Weasleys, eating fast is the only way to make sure you get any before it’s gone.”
“Hey, it’s alright. We’re home, you can relax.” Harry says. He takes Draco by the hand, leading him upstairs.
Malfoy rolls back onto his back, arching upward as he stretches. Harry yelps a bit, pulling the sheet over Malfoy’s chest.
Harry tries again, murmuring the word and blowing. The wings shift, but it doesn’t take off, so he tries thinking the spell very hard and blowing.
"And one of those opinions is probably that they shouldn't bring up your sleep talking." Harry says with a smirk. "You know, you call me Harry in your sleep."
“No, you don’t have to. It’s not something we’ll be keeping track of each time. Only something for you to become more aware of.”
“For all the shite you give me for talking in my sleep, you do a fair bit yourself when you’re having a nightmare.” Malfoy continues, evidently not noticing Harry’s awkwardness.
Finally, Neville excuses himself, wishing the cat a happy birthday and thanking Harry for the strange meal.
By the end, Harry’s ears are very warm, and even without looking, he can hear Hermione’s laboured breathing as she tries not to laugh.
“You know, in school the last year, you repaired a Vanishing Cabinet. There were two, one in Hogwarts and one in a shop in Knockturn Alley, which is close to Diagon Alley. They were broken, usually if someone stepped into one, they would appear in the other, like Apparating except it could go through wards that stop Apparition. But something was broken, so they didn’t work. You managed to fix them somehow. Dumbledore was very impressed.”
as your boyfriend, that’s why you won’t call me that, even though we basically are.” Potter says, barely concealing the hurt. “Draco-”
“Thigh holster?” Harry suggests weakly, but Malfoy gives him the same look he’d give if he was wearing his own face. It’s refreshing to see the familiar expression on the new face.
"I've actually written back and forth every quarter, updates and future project proposals and whatnot. He's donating far more now than he was in the beginning to fund everything, nearly triple."
“Huh.” Harry says, not looking away from the trees at the edge of the Forest. “I thought it would be lower.”
“I’m sorry, I’ll make sure to ask from now on.” Zabini says, and Harry is glad to hear he is taking this seriously.
Not wanting to rehash the incident to Potter, let alone the other four people present, Draco retakes the position he’d been in that day, facing Potter.
Once Draco has calmed down enough, he joins Harry in the shower briefly to wash off the sweat from before.
Draco casts a diagnostic spell anyway, confirming the injury is indeed contained to his foot and nothing else is amiss. Potter doesn’t seem to be entering shock, anyway.
“That’s pretty common in Britain too.” Willows says. “That’s why everyone thinks I’m a blazing homosexual - I painted my nails once and a girl tried to adopt me as her gay best friend.”
“It’s something children do. I didn’t realise, I should’ve known you wouldn’t understand what it is, I’m sorry. But either way, I’ve promised and I’ll try to keep Ron from embellishing any stories he tells me.”
“Oh.” He says, tilting his head and looking at Harry like there was an answer to a complex problem written between his eyebrows.
exactly, but he sort of shadows, keeps an eye out around himself. He knows Malfoy is more than capable of defending himself from unwanted attention, but doubts he would in this disguise.
“I guess you’ve got the whole Room of Requirement bit. But it’s not like he was involved much in the war. He was at Hogwarts for Seventh year, you weren’t.”
Ron looked up at the other auror with an earpiece twice, first in shared anger, then silently communicating something Harry didn’t understand.
"It doesn't bother me if you’re mentioning it to open up a discussion or if you just have nothing better to say to me. But if you're still angry about things, then punch me in the face and move on, as I've tried to."
“It’s alright, Draco, it’s only a bump. You’re safe here, you’re with me now. It’s okay, you’re okay.” Harry coos, continually petting his arms to soothe him.
The stark black of the Dark Mark stands out against his pale skin, and he instinctively tries to hide it. The shirt he’s been assigned doesn’t allow for that, though.
“I mean- yeah, sort of. Asking for consent is not always a plain question like that. Like a couple, like Ron and Hermione, they probably don’t ask every time. You can ask either of them if they’re comfortable talking to you about it.”
“Come with me, after school.” Harry clarified, and Draco looked around like the answer was somewhere by the lake.
Wizarding Romania is not so very different from wizarding London. Sure, the language is different, but Draco speaks six languages fluently and has no trouble conversing. The shops sell very different things, but he manages to find himself a hot meal easily enough.
Potter finds him there, two fingers deep in himself, leg stretching him obscenely open and drawing closer to finishing with every whine.
During Draco’s first day back, he was plagued constantly with the majority of the tamers ‘popping in’ to his office to say hi.
Leaning in, Draco lowers his voice to just above a whisper, right beside Potter’s ear. He deliberately brushes the shell every few words.
Voldemort steps back into view, looking paler than before but with red-glowing eyes hungrily taking in the carnage.
Draco hadn’t slept in a couple of days, at least not around Harry, and from what he’d said, Harry didn’t think he
Without a second thought, Harry is out the door and heading toward the nearest shop he’s pretty sure sells women’s clothes.
Harry felt the curse hit him, distantly realised his body was falling lifelessly to the stone courtyard ground, but it seemed far off and unimportant now.
“I’m not mad at you, Draco. Or disappointed. It’s okay, please stop crying.” He says, kneeling down on the floor near Draco.
Potter gestures to Draco’s uncovered forearm, where the scarred remains of his mark are mostly covered by a violet tattoo boldly proclaiming 'BLOOD TRAITOR.' Surrounding it, magically tattooed vines twist and in the proper seasons, pale pink flowers bloom.
“Okay. Thank you for trusting me. You’re not. And I was spoiling you earlier because I want you to feel safe and happy with me, not because I think you’re… that. I want you to feel comfortable and warm and nice and spoiling you is the best way I could think of to help you after you were so scared and upset last night. I’ll stop if you want me to, but I hope you know that I don’t think of you like that.”
No matter what he says, Harry doesn’t get more than a short answer from him the entire meal. He doesn’t try taking Draco’s hands, after his reaction this morning.
“Leo?” Draco asks with a frown. He can ignore the perusal, it’s not unusual for him to be stared at.
“Hot tub. You’re telling me after all that internet exposure, you don’t know what a hot tub is? It’s a staple in porn videos.”
Malfoy laughs, Summoning his water glasses from the shelf and filling them without lifting his wand. Harry swallows.
Draco rests his head against Harry’s shoulder, letting his eyes fall closed as the fingers in his hole move deeper, stretching his hole open.
“I’m not supposed to. There’s a difference.” Malfoy mutters, ripping his shirt off and stalking off in the direction of the house. His shirt flutters to the ground.
“Skim, Potter. I trust you can do that?” Malfoy says without looking up. He shifts to tug at his shirt until it isn’t caught underneath him. Like yesterday, it’s very large and nearly falling right off his shoulders the way he’s lying.
“Timmy Tommy’s come back to Hoggy Warts!” He sing-songs, swooping down to make a rude noise by Voldemort’s ear. "We didn't miss you, Tim Tommsy Riddle."
“Well, ‘Mione’s been extra busy lately, so I’ve got to stop by the supermarket and pick up some things before dinner.”
“I’m sorry. I understand why you want to feel your important things there, but I hope you know that I would never take them, and no one else comes in here. I wonder if we can find whatever it was after the club is shut down.” Harry says.
Draco has turned on the shower, and it could be any amount of time before he’s done, so Harry floo calls Ron.
Draco hisses, tugging the robe around to hide their activities and tucking his damp, flushed face in the crook of Harry’s neck.
“Draco, that’s so good!” Harry exclaims, setting him back down again. He pulls Draco’s head down, kissing him soundly on the forehead.
A couple tears fall onto Malfoy’s cheeks, but he doesn’t say anything else. Harry tries a different question.
After sending her three Patronuses to find Snape, McGonagall sits down and nudges her glasses up further on her nose.
“I can’t say that’s not true, because I don’t know. But I really doubt there’s another megalomaniac with a personal vendetta against you who’s taking over Britain and committing genocide on the way.”
“I’ll pop by the pet shop again and see if they have a list of human foods that cats can eat, just to be on the safe side.” Harry tells Draco. “Cat food smells awful to me, and I can’t imagine it’s much better for you.”
“After the war? The war, where I was an active member on the wrong side and shortly after came into my very obvious, unconcealable Infairitance? No, I didn’t go back to school.”
“Mims, would you take us?” Draco asks, holding out his hand and grabbing Harry’s. She obliges, transporting them instantly to the entryway.
“The flat. Now that no one’s looking for us, it’s as safe a place as any. Greg, Theo, Pansy and I can’t go home for the holidays on account of our parents being in custody pending trial.”
“I’ve been grinning like a moron since I left him at Blaise’s.” Harry admits. “I had quite the time trying to brush my teeth that night.”
“Erm, okay. No, even if you want me to, your body needs to heal. Do you remember what Marion told us?”
That’s not that surprising to Harry. He remembers how thin and gaunt Draco had been during Sixth year, when he built the house.
“Well, yeah. But also just surprised to hear from you at all. I’ve been to the club he mentioned and I’d never seen anyone who looked like you there.”
“Love you? No, I don’t mind you staying at all.” Draco says softly. He gives Harry a light smile, half his face soaked in the orange morning light. “I’ve got a whole lot of fruits I want to make jam out of, and I would love some help.”
After cockwarming for a long, long time, the handsome man will hold Draco’s balls and touch his cock a bit. Not enough for him to come - Draco isn’t supposed to come - but it’s nice, to relieve the feeling.
“I’ve a whole day’s worth of snogging to make up for.” Harry murmurs, pushing Draco back towards the bed. Draco grins, locking the door with a wave of his hand and letting Harry climb on top of him.
“Thank you for telling me. You did really well.” He praises. Draco blushes a little bit, looking down with a small smile. “Is it okay if Marion asks questions now?”
“No, hey, no, it’s not your fault. You’re not those things. Your parents did bad things - your father is the reason why you were abducted to begin with. If anything, it’s
“Dreary, but what can you expect?” Draco says, tucking his potions case back into its shelf. “St. Mungo’s was absolutely delighted to have me back.”
“Good lord, I forgot he works here.” Malfoy mutters. “Alright then, shall we end this painful conversation before it gets weirder?”
He brings Harry to the kitchen, where there’s a stove in the corner with a fire crackling. The cupboards are painted a pale green, and they’re already filled with glassware and china. The large windows let in endless light, diffused by the clouds overhead.
“Have you met me? Besides, I’ve always appreciated fashion. Menswear is so dull. It’s exciting to be able to wear the styles I’ve admired.”
He would be out on the floor again tonight, and the challenge was exciting even if he really just wanted to go home.
There’s a great deal of dead time for a Seeker. Well, sort of. He’s still supposed to be looking for the Snitch, but his mind is unoccupied.
Draco only owns a few of his favorite books, though he must read a thousand every year. He says he doesn’t have more because he doesn't have space to own all of them, but Harry guesses that he can't afford to buy that many. He always reads them at the shop when it's quiet or borrows them from the library.
A few hours later, Draco gets ready for bed and lays down, feeling very sad and lonely. He’s just made up his mind that Harry isn’t coming after all, when the man himself walks in, letting in a bit of light when he opens the door.
“The author was interested in protecting creatures. He wanted people to understand them.” Draco says, and Harry wonders if he’d written out what to say about each gift.
.” Draco swears, pulling on Potter’s hair to bring his face back down to kissing level, whether to prevent Potter’s smug comment or because Potter being smart
“This is what I hoped we’d avoid with all that shit they were giving him. I’m going to give you another potion, it’ll be a shot in your arm, is that okay?”
“That seems more weird.” Draco says quietly, not really wanting to further alienate himself but very confused at the image.
Draco gasps as Potter nails his prostate dead-on, unable to move anywhere with how Potter’s pinned him down.

“Last week.” Malfoy says around a yawn. “I'm surprised you haven't noticed them, considering how much you look at me.”
Draco has gotten much better at flirting, and the men seem to find him captivating. Sometimes they'll come back multiple days in a row to see him, buy him drinks, try to persuade him to come home with them or sneak into a private room.
Malfoy keeps an entirely straight face, and Harry groans, falling against him again and biting Malfoy’s lower lip.
“What?” Harry asks back, looking up at Malfoy and realising that he’d just said what might be considered a very strange comment to make to someone you barely call a friend.
While he was distracted, Malfoy had slipped the needle through his earlobe and was now fitting a ring into the hole. It joins various others littered around his ears.
“But that’s the problem.” Draco says dully. “If I only hated him, I’d have burned this letter and forgotten about it. I
As soon as they’re inside, Harry can practically feel Draco’s anxiety. There’s loads of people here even as early as it is, because it’s Saturday.
Given how terrible he had felt, he can’t explain how he ended up at the same club the next night, this time alone.
Harry looked into his frightened silver eyes, and accepted the Hawthorn wand he knew would work better for him than the fallen one from before.
He doesn’t react when he sees Draco, but his eyes linger for a second. He looks over at Pierson, who’s standing nearby wiping sweat from his face, still in the clothes he wore as ‘Draco.’
More tears stream down Malfoy’s cheeks, and he gestures to his darkened bedroom with a jerk of his head.
“I know.” Draco says. “They didn’t make sense. You didn’t like me then. The kiss was very confusing. And the last was like the confusing memory, I made you up.”
“Yes, Ms. Patil. She has taken a higher position in another department, and unfortunately, that’s all I can disclose. I’m sure as your former partner, she would be happy to relay any other pertinent details to you.”
Harry has finished his food and sips his tea as Draco eats. He knows Draco doesn’t like when Harry just sits and waits for him to finish, and usually stops once Harry is done.
So when Malfoy comes, fingers clenched in Harry’s hair, entire body shaking and arched sinfully off Harry’s lap, Harry holds onto him. Keeps Malfoy from drifting off too far, even strokes his leg a bit to help him calm down afterward.
“Before we faced the dragons - me, Cedric, Fleur and Viktor - we had to draw one of these from a bag to see who would face which dragon. I got this little guy, and he’s been passed around the Gryffindors ever since.”
“How awful.” Hermione says sadly. “It’s been four years, do you think he’ll be able to regain his agency?”
Somehow, quiet Crane spread the word that Draco had returned to the reserve, and he was fielding curious tamers all morning, explaining what the hell a Malediction is and why it’s so bad.
“Shh. Calm down, Harry.” Marion says soothingly, closing the exam room door behind the three of them. Draco collapses onto the nearest chair, drawing his knees up and whimpering. Harry sits one over from him, not touching.
Hey at least things are a little bit nicer for him now. Next chapter is from Draco's perspective of 2 May, 1998...
“Exactly. It’s all in good fun. Greg has three nephews on his wife’s side and they specifically requested pirate wizards, so here I am.”
Malfoy drops his end, and Zambini curses. Harry picks it up, helping Zambini carry it down the stairs and off to the side.
“I want to. I want it. I’m just- You’ve got experience and I don’t, and I'm- I’m worried it won’t be how it’s supposed to, and- and maybe I won’t look the way I should or something embarrassing will happen and you’ll never look at me the same way, or you'll be worried about my seizures or something or I’ll accidentally injure you somehow or worse, just
here." Draco corrects her, guessing she'd not been paying attention when Greg told her the dilemma. "But thank you, I appreciate it."
“Potter? What in the world-” Draco cuts off when he notices Potter’s mangled foot. “Merlin, come on…”
After he’s come, he takes those memories from the pensieve and stores them in a bottle in his cupboard. He’ll be able to recall them from watching them again just now, but they’ll be preserved and won’t dull over time, protected like that.
“Okay I am actually curious how sex works with you and the married friends considering you’re only into one of them. I imagine Pansy would get bored if it was just you and her husband going at it.”
“We’d better head out before it gets busy then.” He says, and Harry nods, shutting his door and following Draco out the castle.
“You dated a girl? Why was she crying?” Draco asks, sitting up a little bit and listing away from Harry.
“Wanna go for a Seeker’s game later?” Harry asks before he can think twice about it. “I need practise if I’m going to be captaining the team against Durmstrang.”
“You could move back in with me later. When you’ve recovered. I would love to date you, Draco.” Harry admits.
“Would it help if I sat by you?” Harry offered, summoning his quill and parchment over to the bed. Draco shrugged.
Harry grins, leaning down again to press their lips together, tongue slipping into Malfoy’s mouth greedily.
of time to get himself prepared earlier, half wishing Harry’d walk in while he was riding his own hand. Sadly, that was not the case, but he’d managed to get three fingers in comfortably, and had stopped before finishing, so he was extra worked up already.
“You don’t understand how it’s to my advantage?” Potter asks mildly, very close to laughing. Draco scowls at him.
Harry sinks into the bath, glad for all the bubbles keeping his modesty intact. Malfoy opens his eyes.
“Right, well. I was cocky, arrogant, and stupid. That’s how I wound up cursing you and nearly killing you. It sort of made me reconsider some things. I’ve grown up, and I’m still stupid, but I think I’m less cocky and arrogant than before. You can ask Ron or Hermione what they think.”
On their way to the head table in the Great Hall, Harry makes a detour by the Hufflepuff table to give Teddy a high five and ruffle his hair.
“Not too much, I’m sure.” Draco says flatly. “And you’ll know where to find me at the end of the day.”
If you're binge-reading this, here is a perfect spot to take a water break! Or maybe go to sleep, take care:)
"I'm sorry, Harry. We're just… we didn't want everyone to think George had lost his mind and treat him with kid gloves all over again. You know what I mean."
Potter’s hands shift up Draco’s back and beneath his shoulder blades. He feels the all-encompassing heat of Potter’s body.
"Yes I do! I know loads about them!" Harry protests. "They were some of my first friends! I've been close with George ever since-"
"I've got preservation spells on it and I replace the fluids often enough that the insides will still work once I figure it out." Malfoy says, sitting back more solidly and sipping his tea again.
Either way, Harry gets in bed and reads for a while before he’s tired, then holds Draco’s hand as he falls asleep.
“Yes, well, you’re the figurehead, that’s something.” Draco shrugs. “At any rate, the point is that I’ve determined to show my parents that although I’m willing to forgive them, they no longer have any right to tell me what I can or should be doing.”
“I won’t hold you to the dance, but I have a feeling he’ll pounce again if you leave the floor too soon.” He says lowly. She nods.
“Harry, I can’t- I’m gonna-” He whines, his hands fisting in the sheets. As soon as he speaks, Harry moves his hand away again. Draco scowls at him, pouting.
Once he’s done and out of the shower, he finds Draco licking his paw in the kitchen, steadfastly ignoring Harry.
“He’s not sleeping with the Goyles.” Potter says, looking at Scarrow. “It’s the Zabini's he sleeps with.”
“What, are you cosplaying as a Tim Burton character?” He says, eyeing the shiny platform boots that might make Malfoy close to Harry’s height.
Malfoy’s eyes show no recognition as they roam over Harry’s disguised face, and really, Harry knew he wouldn’t be noticed.
"Are you thinking about that time you caught a cold and were spreading germs all over the castle?" Harry asks.
“I’m not some lovestruck maiden pining away for the man of my dreams, Potter. Greg loves me fiercely, if platonically, and it’s more than enough.”
“Yeah. He was great.” Harry says sadly. “He was a good godfather. Did everything he could for me, listened anytime I needed to talk about stuff. I miss him a lot.”
“I think I have to.” Harry says. “Draco, I’m going to pick you up now. If that’s not okay, squeeze my hand.”
obvious, because Harry continues to message Malfoy back and forth into the night, then again in the morning during breakfast.
Did I just watch Midnight Mass halfway into writing this? Yes. Did it Inspire me to throw something about forgiveness in here? Sort of.
A stranger has come up and started petting Draco while Harry was distracted. Draco is looking at Harry with very wide eyes, and Harry holds out a hand, so Draco hops across the table and away from the woman and into Harry’s protective embrace.
“No, we do!” Harry assures him. “I’m trying to think of one you might not remember. And a lot of nice things we’ve done have ended up not-so-nice because I triggered you by accident. I’m not good at Occlumency, so I don’t think I could stop the memory before that part.”
He himself lays across the sofa on his stomach, taking the book from the top of the stack and opening it.
Harry rolls his eyes as Malfoy smirks maliciously. He takes a quick step toward him, and Malfoy squeaks, putting his hands against Harry’s stomach.
Though Harry went straight through the gate, it took him a second to notice Draco wasn’t immediately behind him.
“Ever since I found him, I kept wondering why no one did anything.” Harry says quietly. “It seems like all the employees knew he wasn’t there by choice.”
Before Malfoy can go on about Harry’s Saviour cock, he pushes inside, immediately gasping out a groan at the feeling.
Also, I have two different Royalty AUs - Prince Draco/Knight Harry and Prince Harry/Viscount Draco,, so let me know if I should keep working on those to post!
Unrelated but I'm kind of toying with the idea of doing kinktober ? Idk, I've never done one of those writing challenges and it seems fun. Maybe I'll write shorts for that and just post them on Tumblr? Idk, are you guys into that sort of thing?
child.” Draco suggests, squeezing her hand. “You could get one fairly easily, as a wealthy married couple. I see how you both watch Daphne and Isla.”
Lucius Malfoy’s eyes search the ranks of students where they’re filling in gaps where fallen aurors and Order members would have been.
“Do you think it’s something you can do because you don’t need a wand? Maybe you have a stronger bond with magic, or something?”
passionate about dragons, in which case he didn’t really want to get her started on the subject, or leaving society was a sign she was unhappy with some aspect of it. Bringing it up defeats the purpose of her leaving.
as tall as all the rest of them. After adjusting their size to fit, he brings Harry out to the room to sit on the bed and wriggle into them.
He’d ignored it in bed because, obviously, he’s always just hard whenever he wakes up, but here, half an hour later, he’s unbelievably more so and tingling with tense energy.
“That’s the most obvious way to not say it.” Harry mutters. “Anyway, McGonagall’s in her office, I’ve got to go chew Malfoy’s head off for being a twat.”
The next dress is a deep green, the neckline plunging to his navel, the skirt flaring out from his waist. Harry’s eyes freeze over bared patches of skin over his sides. He licks his lips.
The house-elves, Peppy, Mims, Chatterly and Lolly, Apparate in and take their bench in the front. Everyone else follows suit quickly.
Once the crowd is out of sight, Harry turns back to head up to the tower, wondering if he can get some more sleep before lunch.
“Draco, you’ll tell them I treated you well, won’t you? I kept you company, I kept you safe from the others. It was Fenrir keeping you from leaving. He threatened to bite all of us if we tried letting you free.” Alpha says, looking down at Draco imposingly. Though his voice is almost pleasant, his posture demands submission.
By the time he makes it over to Harry, he looks exhausted, his eyelids lowered how some might see arousal, but Harry sees something worse.
Instead of the library, Draco goes to the dungeons, locking himself in the dorm and leaning heavily against the door.
“As good friends as one can expect after missing eight years of each others’ lives. I’m not as close with them as I’d like to be, but we keep each other up to date with life.”
“I can’t work for him. I’ve lost all respect for him.” Harry said, realising it as it came out of his mouth.
“I mean, we’re comfortable with each other. We snog, we’ve talked about sex before.” Harry says. Draco shuts his eyes, though he couldn’t see anything in the darkness anyway.
“See you around, then. Good luck with the potions.” Potter says, mouth very close to Draco’s ear, breath hot over Draco's throat.
place for fairies. Just like selkies are at home in water, giants in the mountains, there must be a place where Malfoy won’t feel judged or uncomfortable.
Harry hums thoughtfully. Letters might help Draco figure himself out, and maybe reconnect with some of his old friends.
Harry currently, and may possibly even like him. Malfoy also may have enjoyed the snogging and it’s probable Harry could talk him into doing it again.
The lights on the stage went out, and shadowy figures took their places - three, by the looks of it.
“Well it was the first thing I’d read of hers.” Greg says. “So it was rather shocking. And I am very glad I’ve managed to keep from hearing what the three of you get up to.”
“I can’t believe you’ve waited this long to inform me.” Malfoy says crossly. “Wizarding porn is so useless - all heterosexual and only about 5 second loops of action. What sort of porn is on the internet?”
“We’re going to remain faithful to that bond, even though it was unintentional. Which is why we’ve asked you all here.” Harry continues. “Draco and I have grown very fond of each other in the last several weeks.”
“Gladly.” Draco says hoarsely. Potter laughs lightly, one fist loosening to move to Draco’s side, hot and searing even through the layers of clothes. He looks over Draco’s shoulder at the papers scattered over his desk.
By morning, Harry decides the happenings of the night will be one of those weird experiences that you just…
“We’ll have it recast.” Lucius says. “There’s only the one man’s ring, but we can have a second made. Take it, Draco. Please.”
“Is-is crying not okay? You said-” Draco wipes his eyes quickly. “You said crying was good. Am I in trouble?”
“Okay.” Draco says, standing. Harry takes the seat behind the desk, glancing over what was laid out that Draco had been using.
“I- sorry, nevermind-” Harry stammers, feeling his entire body flush with embarrassment. “I dunno why I asked-”
“You cosplaying as a cupcake?” Malfoy asks, looking at the voluminous skirt fluffed out around Harry’s knees.
“I’m fine.” He says. Harry is about to say something, but he’s cut off by Draco gagging, then puking into the rubbish bin again.
“Yeah, I mean. When I met you, you were even more cocky than me. You insulted all my friends and tried to make friends with me, but I said no. We hated each other for the rest of school, I think.”
“It’s odd to see one of the previous tops of our class be so rubbish at potions now.” Ron had whispered to Harry. Harry shrugged him off.
“We can go in quickly, I just thought you might like some sweets.” Harry says as he feels Draco’s hand tense in his.
“You feel absurd in street clothes? You were just wearing a ballgown!” Harry exclaims. Malfoy rolls his eyes.
“Hm. Should probably add another layer then. The flat was so cramped, it got absurdly warm whilst we were there. Too many people, certainly. Greg warms up the place like no one else, he runs so warm.”
"If you don't want it, you're free to go. I will punch you if you're rude but I will stop messing with your aura in public." Harry promises.
“The Pied Piper is a muggle story, but if it was true, I think he must’ve been a wizard.” Draco says, turning. “The statue will keep the gnomes distracted enough for easy de-gnoming, or if you like, they can keep following behind him.”
“Well, we’ll just have to give it a shot and see what you like then, right?” Harry offers, slipping his fingers into Draco’s waistband.
about it. I didn’t plan on that, I was new to going out as her, and… I was a bit more mouthy than I should’ve been.”
The article has some quotes from partygoers, mostly stating that Meredith is an incorrigible flirt and mysterious as they come. Malfoy skims it for a moment, then shrugs.
“Pansy Parkinson bought me a pair of heels as a joke at school, but I kept them until one of the heels broke off.”
“The twins were always in trouble, but they got good enough marks, so they weren’t kicked out before that. I loved their pranks.”
"I meant that I'll fight you!" Malfoy says frantically, turning to put the carton of juice in the fridge as Harry snickers.
The library only has a few first and second year students loitering about, homework in front of them whilst they talk amongst themselves.
Harry walks up, snatching the cigarette and taking a pull. It makes him want to cough, but he tamps down the urge.
“Pucker up, Alex.” Scarrow says, making loud kissy noises as he crosses to circle to plant a noisy kiss on Crane’s grimace.
“I’ve been wondering that all day, but I just know for some reason, I guess it came up at school sometime.” Harry shrugs.
Deciding to feign sleep and listen in on whatever Malfoy says, Harry keeps his eyes shut and stays still.
“Don’t apologise for that, everyone’s bad when they first start relationships.” Harry says gently. Draco sighs, lowering his hands back into his lap. Harry glances at them, seeming satisfied when they’re not twitching uncontrollably like before.
“The old books? I don’t know, there’s just so many. I can’t be bothered to sort through them all. There’s loads of stuff in that house that I don’t know what to do with.”
“I haven't decided.” Malfoy says around a yawn, arching backward into Harry. Harry is very confused by this. “I've been considering getting my nipples done. Maybe more on my ears, I don't know.”
“You’re a strange egg, Malfoy.” Potter says, taking another pepper before Inkwood bats it from his hand and returns the jar to the kitchen.
“You know I have.” Harry says. “You’d have to be an idiot not to notice, and I know you’re not an idiot.”
Malfoy grows increasingly animated, his feet pressed against the front of the counter to keep him balanced as he’s leaning so far forward, he’s nearly falling off it entirely.
Drake accepts the strawberry from Inkwood, cheeks faintly flushed, but turns to face her grinning girlfriend, who leans forward to whisper in her ear. Drake squeaks, clapping a hand over her mouth.
“You take good care of Draco or you’ll need something a bit stronger than Expelliarmus to stop me.” He warns, quiet enough that Draco doesn’t hear him. Harry nods.
Hands are lingering low on his hips - big hands attached to strong arms - but barely touching, and Draco could very easily get away if he wanted to. Draco shifts closer against the man’s side, wishing he could say
By the way, we've got a lot of ground to cover coming up.. do you guys prefer longer chapters or more chapters? Word count will probably be around the same in the end either way. (long chapters will probably be no more than like 5-6K, which is the length of all the Inside Grey Eyes chapters)
“He’s in shock.” She finally announces. “He should snap out of it at some point, but it could take awhile.”
But if Malfoy wanted privacy, he could’ve arranged for it. Silencing spells, screens or hell, he could go somewhere else in the flat.
Draco nods, his hand replacing Harry’s as he chases the feeling from earlier. Harry settles down near Draco’s hips grabbing a pillow.
“Just because we’re here doesn’t mean you have to do anything you’re not comfortable with.” Harry says before giving Draco a warm kiss. Draco nods.
“I’m glad you slept so well last night.” Draco says casually. Harry tucks his knees up behind Draco’s, which considering Draco is slightly taller, Harry’s face is pressed against the back of Draco’s neck. He smells very good.
Nevermind that it’s a lovely shade of lavender and says ‘girl pwr’ in white cursive down one of the sleeves, nor that it’s sold from the women’s section. Draco likes it, and Draco will have it.
Potter doesn’t say anything, just looking at his plate, so Draco puts his hand in the middle of the table to catch his attention again.
Minerva takes the scribe’s parchment to put into action any promises Harry may have made. Severus takes all the gifts to put in their proper places.
“Like you were looking for your own enjoyment rather than to find a weak spot.” Potter shrugs, and Draco grimaces.
And so, now, when Draco is brought something silky and indecent to wear for the day, he slips it on without question.
“You’ll stay here until you’re no longer a person of interest.” The man says. It doesn’t make Draco feel any better.
Malfoy opens one eye slightly to give Harry a wordless look of disbelieving amusement. Harry shrugs, and Malfoy rolls his eyes.
A light knock brings Draco out of his reading. He frowns, wondering who it could be. It isn’t Harry, he doesn’t knock anymore, and Hermione and Ron don’t knock so timidly.
“I’m happier than I’ve been in ages - happier than I thought I’d ever be again. Completely and perfectly incandescently happy. That’s more than enough.” Draco says, looking at Harry with those grey eyes full of secrets and surprises and depth and
Harry loads up his YouTube and Instagram pages to browse whilst in the Three Broomsticks. He coughs a bitter laugh when he sees that Malfoy’s somehow been posting regularly despite being back at school.
“If you think forty-seven minutes isn’t enough time to go from holiday cheer to ready to burn your ancestral home to the ground, you are
“I could have vanilla sex with him, but… There’s too much history, you know? If I’m going to be in any sort of long-term relationship, I have to build it up over time. He and I are still working through all the shit I’d started before, we haven’t even begun to start building trust. It’s all…”
Draco whines again, rubbing his cheek on Harry’s leg. His fingers twitch on the bed, but he doesn’t otherwise speak.
"Figured." She says mildly, still not looking at Draco. "You should see a mind healer, though. That shit sticks with you if you're not treated."
Harry stays for dinner, which is much less awkward than usual, so he puts his plans for a string quartet on hold.
Potter’s finger twists around inside Draco, and on the pullout, grabs Draco’s hand to remove it from the hole. Draco whines as he clenches around nothing.
That weekend, after leaving Draco’s room to dress, Harry was surprised to open his own door to Draco, who was dressed warmly, if a bit formally, lounging against the wall across the corridor. He looked nice, Harry noted, very cool waiting around like that.
“Yeah, a bit. And sure, I think you make an incredibly attractive woman, but I’m not more interested in
“Right then, where were we?” Ron asks suddenly, and Draco prays to Merlin, Morgana and Circe that he hadn’t heard Draco speak.
She continues brushing, more gently, and Malfoy sets his elbow on the sink, resting his head on his palm.
Harry hadn’t seen him at many meals. For the first two days, he hadn’t been to any. Finally, his third day at school, he was seen walking into breakfast with Luna. Sweet Luna, who Harry smiled at anytime he saw her. Harry found it strange to say the least, considering the last he’d seen them interact was while Luna was a prisoner in Malfoy’s cellar, though he doubted Malfoy’d had anything to do with that.
Draco opens the garden with a flourish, and he and Harry part to stand in front of the bird bath facing each other.
doing to them? Their hot skin against yours, the sound of their breath so close, their moans, gasps and whimpers…”
Then, he recognises the Hogwarts corridors, evidently watching Memory Draco walk through them with someone he’s holding hands with.
” Ashe moans, plunking her elbows on the table and setting her face on her hands. “Why are they all gay in the wrong directions?”
“You four.” She says quietly, keeping her eyes on the rest of the Hall. “You will be the Horcrux hunting team. None of the other professors but Snape know of this task. We need him on the front lines.”
” She says with wide eyes, making Draco laugh softly. “Unless a wix takes pity on us to grant a portkey or Apparate us themselves.”
“Just one more thing. I haven’t written my report yet. Draco, does Harry know about… the man whose name starts with Z?”
“My body needs it - soaking in the hot water, the perfume, the flowers.” Draco says, standing up and drinking the last of his tea.
Finally, he suggested Pierson break into a potions cabinet, acting like he was going to give himself the injection.
I have decided I will be writing a scene or two from Draco's POV and post it as a separate chapter, it's just a matter of picking what to write
“And the drama queen has left the chat.” He mutters, leaning back in his chair and wondering where he left off.
Draco looks around at the room, which has several heavy bookcases and Summons one randomly, then tucks his wand back inside his sleeve.
When Harry stands, he’s surprised to find his body is not entirely disinterested in seeing Malfoy like this. He'll have to be careful, or all this power will go to his head.
The room is easy enough to spot, with a glass-dome-enclosed haunted mouse which Malfoy’d had in their flat beside the door. The mouse scratches at the glass when it spots Harry, and he ignores it as much as possible, as he had in the flat. It’s one of Malfoy’s creepier artefacts.
sure. No one saw. But there were Death Eaters everywhere, and all of a sudden, they all just… vanished.”
“Yes. You took Dumbledore’s wand, but you didn’t hurt him. Dumbledore… well, it was all very complicated. Do you want me to explain it now?”
“It’s very complicated, Mother.” Malfoy says distractedly, standing on his toes to stare at a spot where the stoat’s fur is singed.
McGonagall makes an announcement that would not have excited Harry nearly as much if it was made the week prior.
“Kinky.” Draco says with a wiggle of his eyebrows. “I would’ve let you. I would’ve let you anytime since you were outed. Anytime, anywhere.”
Draco takes it out of his ear and waves his wand at it. The audio gets louder, loud enough for Harry to hear it.
That in mind, he whips together the most lavish meal he’s made, with the good jam he’d received as a birthday gift and hadn’t gotten around to using yet. He pours Draco some of the fancy tea Hermione had given him with a ‘you deserve nice things, Harry. Enjoy the tea.’ He uses the muggle waffle iron he’d always wanted and had one day just bought on a whim after a couple too many drinks.
Deciding to go get his map from the tower, Harry rushes past people shouting his name and congratulating him.
Then he enters the nightmare that Draco had tonight. He recognises it as a continuation of the memory from the last time Harry used Legilimency.
“I’ve dated two girls, actually. Both at Hogwarts. And she was crying because the boy she dated before died.”
Harry nods vaguely. He has a prickly feeling over his skin at the idea of being poked and prodded at, remembering clearly all the times it had happened to him as a child. How much worse would it have been had they wanted to sleep with him too.
Malfoy has become increasingly transparent to Harry the more they work together, though, Harry notes, he’s still able to fool most other people he met into thinking he’s got a stick up his arse. Harry prides himself in being the exception.
“Very good, Mister Potter, this looks exactly right.” He congratulates, evidently having missed Harry’s little display only a moment before. Harry acknowledges him and Draco covers his hot face with both hands. Everyone in the room is staring at them with either surprise or blatant amusement.
Shaking his head, Draco sits back against the wall he’s leaning against, eyeing Potter over the mouth of his bottle.
“‘Mione, Ron’s about to tell you something and I need to explain first or you’ll never believe me.” He warns her, and she looks heartily amused.
“This crown is made of red asters for undying devotion, pink asters for sensitivity and love, yellow orchids for friendship and new beginnings, white alstroemeria for support and strength, and pink alstroemeria for romance. I love you, darling.”
He knows she likes Harry, but she’s so pleasant with Draco that Harry wants to laugh. She’s always avoided what she calls ‘warm and fuzzy bullshit,’ so the fact that she’s willingly gentle and sweet to him must mean she’s really fond. Harry can’t blame her.
“Absolutely.” Draco smiles. “I was in Brussels because that’s where the majority of the training was based. I’d met up with a mutual acquaintance of my dear friend Blaise, I believe that’s the instance you’re referring to.”
“Have you been here as long as he has?” Draco asks. “And did you meet Luvenia here or come as a couple?”
They don’t have to speak for Harry to know when Malfoy’s in need of repairs. It’s written all over in the dark circles under his eyes and his limp white hair.
“I’m flattered, but I’m pretty sure he just said that because I’m the only one here.” Potter says with a smirk.
Harry ignores that, releasing Draco’s hands to Vanish the knife and heaving him off the floor and onto his bed.
“I’ve wanted to wear this out for a while, it moves so nicely.” Malfoy says, walking about the room to demonstrate. “But it’s very heavy and no good for dancing.”
Malfoy hops up onto the counter and spins around so he’s on the same side as Harry and his feet dangle between them. He's not wearing shoes.
“Well, you’re part of my sex life now.” Draco says. “And all our coworkers are pretty obsessed with it, so I hope you've considered that they’ll likely ask you about how it was or if there were kinks involved.”
“I’m really not, but I want to do what I can.” Harry says. “How does it work? Do you find something that might work and give it a shot? What sorts of things have you tried so far?”
“He’s a distraction, my Prince. With the greatest respect, we have had some people mention that he was disruptive to the court proceedings.”
“She won’t tell anyone. She works privately, I’ve gone to her for years now. In the last four years, I’ve managed to cut off multiple fingers at work, but she’s gotten them reattached and working properly.”
Well, he looks like exactly the sort of person who runs a mysterious little shop tucked into the wall with a loosely defined set of services and a reputation for
“Correct.” Draco says with a smirk. “Beater was out because I’m far too small. I couldn’t play Keeper because I always duck out of the way instead of trying to keep the ball out of the ring. They thought I might’ve been a good Chaser, except that I’m terrible at paying attention to so many things. Hence, Seeker.”
“Where are we going?” Draco asks, slipping his hand into Harry’s as soon as the front door is closed behind him.
"Want me to head the lads off? You should wake your charming prince so you don’t miss dinner entirely.”
“Mrs. Zabini is keeping her distance from Death Eaters. And considering Greg and I both were, however briefly, she’s not extended an invitation this year. Hence, flat.”
“I’m not the best company tonight, but while you’re here, you might as well stay. I’ll be plenty of fun in the morning.” Malfoy says through a yawn. It’s possibly the least sexy way to proposition someone, but Harry’s body reacts to it anyway, and he kicks off his clothes down to his pants and slips in beside Malfoy.
“There must be somewhere else you could’ve worked.” Harry says disbelievingly. “Muggle London, or something.”
“I imagine. You’re a wonderful boyfriend. I can see how much you care for him even without knowing his thoughts.”
“Worry not, sweet pea.” Potter teases, setting the tip of the plug against Draco’s rim and pushing, slow and steady, drawing a long, desperate whimper from Draco.
“Your turn, sweet.” Knox says. Drake’s smile is gone immediately, and she glares at Knox for a moment.
“Yes, Potter, if I had been born with a male body and transitioned into female with the corresponding bits, I’d have surgery scars, yes?”
“Okay, forget what I said earlier. You have to answer my questions, alright?” Harry says firmly once Malfoy has stopped puking. He sets the bin aside, getting a glass of water and making Malfoy drink the whole thing.
Draco nods, and feeling a bit cheeky, Harry keeps Draco’s wrist pressed to his lips for a couple open-mouthed kisses.
“The Hogwarts teams will be playing against Durmstrang.” McGonagall continues. “In an effort to bring some life into this school, to celebrate victory and to thank those who sacrificed for our freedom.”
of dresses to try on. Harry hardly wants to at all until the girl assures him that she’s very supportive of all self-expression.
Aurors rush forward to snap magic-dampening manacles onto their wrists while everyone behind Harry hurries back to pick through the fallen bodies to find anyone still alive.
“You’re not out of luck.” Harry says, scooting closer. He plants his hands on Draco’s outstretched legs, but Draco doesn’t react. “Listen to me, Draco. Listen.” He shakes his hands to get Draco’s attention. His head rolls forward lazily like he can’t even be bothered to move.
“I’ll signal you, I’m waiting for the leader to go back. Stay near the hallway to the kitchen and I’ll go first.”
Harry stares at Draco’s bruised inner elbow for a minute. He starts to wonder if he’d become an auror like he was meant to, if Draco would’ve been found sooner. He’s always had a knack for finding him, and would have no doubt been put on the case due to their history.
“I’ve shared a mind with Voldemort himself. I think I’ve seen just as much shit as you have. Trust me when I tell you this is worse.”
“Yes. It was- I didn't- Part of- Part of my punishments. Alpha... wasn’t working when I saw you.” Malfoy shudders, and Harry’s heart drops.
“How do you know?” Draco asks. “I haven’t got any experience, I barely know how libraries work here let alone in the muggle ones.”
“Better.” Jack comments. “Go talk to the man in the violet at the table in front of the second stage, he’s been morose all night. You don’t tell him you work here, you just sit down and flirt.”
“Yes, but she also didn’t do anything to get my father to see reason. Do you know, he smashed all our crystal champagne flutes upon returning from Azkaban?”
"Yes! Remember when Greg and his parents went to Morocco the summer before Fifth year and you spilled tea on your lap when you saw him?"
To any future readers- this chapter is a good stopping point to give yourself a little break. Make sure you stay hydrated and get enough rest:)
“You don’t need to be talking directly to be flirting.” Ron says, brushing off Harry’s attempts to complain more. “I’m telling you, Harry, it’s all in that book. Loads of the stuff that worked with Hermione would work on Malfoy too.”
“‘Yes, Madam Pomfrey, it was entirely Malfoy’s fault, he kicked my testes clean off. I’m a Ken Doll now.’” Harry says with a smirk. Malfoy grunts, finally shaking Harry’s hand off.
He’s there for so long that Potter resorts to just holding him, one thick, veined forearm across Draco’s legs and the other behind his lower back. They meet clasped over Draco’s hip, thumbs flicking over the creases in Draco’s trousers as if it’s the most natural thing in the world.
When she finally gets around to sticking the needle in, Harry bites down his cry of pain. It does hurt, a lot, but not worse than some of the other things he's felt. He keeps a stoic face for Malfoy’s camera.
When Draco lifts the lid, all of the things Harry’d carelessly tossed inside are neatly folded or stacked up on one side, while the other has pages and pages of written notes, all of Draco’s parchment paper stored from the bathroom product deliveries, his knitting practise from Mrs. Weasley and the clothes he’d worn out of the club, which had only been the boots, trousers and what looks like a sparkly black thong.
Malfoy whines, shifting his hips. His free hand moves to his nipple, and he sighs as he pinches and tweaks it.
“Potions research. I need a specific kind of beetle but it’s supposed to be a certain colour so I’m collecting a whole lot so I can find the right colour in my lab.”
“I was cutting up a ginger root and my knife slipped, but fortunately I was able to keep from getting blood in the cauldron. But it’s still there, the cauldron, I mean, I need to go put a stasis over it, I don’t think I did before I came here. And I’m fairly certain I got blood in the halls - it’s no good to leave your blood lying about, Potter, you should know that. I’ve got to check and clean up any, because the-”
“Hm. Well, it’s really designed for a person with breasts. Sort of… hugs that.” She says with a frown. “Heteronormativity and all. But if you’ve got a safety pin, you can take it in near the zip in the back so it stays up better.”
this job. I have a criminal record - nonviolent - and this place was the only one that would hire me.”
Harry holds up a finger and leaves. He’d just seen several vases of roses in another room yesterday.
“Fair enough.” Harry says, and Draco turns back to his reading. “Did you watch me in the Triwizard Tournament?”
Draco can’t attack students, that’ll get him expelled! Harry fights again, but of course it’s no use without the counter-curse or time enough that it fades on its own.
“They haven’t been this bad in a long time, obviously something’s wrong.” Harry points out, taking his hand again. Draco sighs.
The next day, Sunday, they all gathered in the small shop, lights brighter and less mysterious, scent of Amortentia mostly gone, the heavy dark cloak hanging off its hook and door to the second body’s room open.
Greg sits down and pulls Draco with him so Draco ends up lying across the sofa with his head on Greg’s thighs. Astoria is sitting in a nearby armchair, flipping through a catalog.
How Harry had immediately started going out with Ginny only a week or so later, and hadn’t seen Malfoy again until that night in the Astronomy tower. How he hadn’t even
“Greg’s father stood alongside mine with the Dark Lord, and didn’t have a stint in prison in the middle of it. I had a rather wretched Sixth year, if you remember, and Greg and Crabbe were really the only people I could say anything to, though I still couldn’t say much.”
Mrs. Weasley greeted them both warmly with hugs (though she asked first). She sent their coats and scarves off to a hook near the door and pulled them into the kitchen, where she was preparing the food.
It certainly doesn’t. The tacky pleather seats have been replaced with Imperviused upholstery, the floor is now wooden instead of carpet, and even the bar has been redone to be clean lines and wood paneling instead of the grungy black painted walls.
“I am your boyfriend.” Harry says, but Draco waits for him to continue, which he does with a sigh. “I just… it feels like… not enough. We’ve been arch-rivals for ages, and then sort of allies. You’ve saved my life and I’ve saved yours. You mean
In the dim light from the street lamps outside, Harry can make out the silhouette of Malfoy, lying on his back with his knees bent and spread.
The sound of the floo fire, followed by Ron’s greeting, startled Harry, and he Accio’d his cloak quickly, throwing it over Malfoy.
“You were also playing as a child.” Narcissa points out. “And you were put on the team when you were eleven, playing against older Seekers.”
Harry very cautiously tucks a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear, tracing the shell with his pinky. The barely-there touch sent a wave of magic up his arm. He hears Draco’s breath catch, but he doesn’t say anything.
Malfoy is already at breakfast when Harry arrives the next morning, poking at his food and glaring at the table.
Jack sighs, leaning close to the table to scratch at his jaw with his manacled hand, chained to the tabletop.
Harry takes a breath, stilling Malfoy’s hips on his lap. There’s only one way out, and it’s through the front doors.
Harry eventually decides on a few different items, mostly to give Ron to cheer him up as exams approach.
Their places at the centre of the table were reserved by two flower crowns – one made by Draco for Harry, and one made by Harry for Draco.
) later, when Malfoy seems a bit more present. For now, he wraps his arm around the little waist and lifts the pale arm over his shoulder, supporting his weight. Malfoy leans his head against the top of Harry's. Harry smiles.
life to speak of. It really feels like it’s just the first of many things to spiral out of control again.”
“Yeah, I know. I haven't felt like this for a while, and the fact that it's Potter... I'm just... it scares me a bit, Greg."
Harry brushes his teeth, takes a piss and splashes some water over his face before he has time to think too hard about the day.
“It doesn’t have to be a big deal. As you’ve said, we are married. Besides, we both know it was because of the magic.” Harry offers, demonstrating by brushing his fingers over Draco’s arm. Draco flinches away, finally looking up at him.
“Okay.” Draco says absently, moving the record box over to the desk. Harry watches him for another minute, but leaves when Draco just stares at it from different angles.
Finally - gloriously - the stars align, and Draco has made it all the way around the circle and into Potter’s lap.
“Well, Archie’s coming off stage now, why don’t you tell him how unrefined you think his line of work is?”
A few minutes later, he hears footsteps coming up behind him, and his left hand grasps his wand inside his robe pocket in preparation.
“To be fair, the man’s man’s man thing wasn’t my idea.” Draco says loftily, though he’s still laughing. “And Potter, have you
Eventually, they had to go back out to serve their detention. Harry grumbled about it the whole time they were redressing.
With a wave, Malfoy conjures a blackboard and some chalk, rising to put their names on it. Harry’s surprised when he adds his parent’s names.
“I’m going to be the talk of the town come Monday.” Ron grins, running his fingers over the intricately stamped leather outside of the holster. “This doubles as a gauntlet too, protects my arm and all. Thanks, Draco!”
Outside the shop window, the florist across the street is putting out his window displays. Harry’s eyes land on a particularly pretty lilac arrangement.
Malfoy, strangely, looks a bit pleased at Harry’s declaration, though Harry can't imagine what he'd said that would make Malfoy happy. The Twins snag the book from his hands.
Potter makes a wide turn, keeping his eye on the dragon before speeding to where Draco stands with his arms crossed.
George also pledges a percentage of his profits, and Hermione looks like she’s about to cry in delight.
“Ron’s an auror, he can’t know you’re here or he’ll arrest you.” Harry hissed. “Go upstairs please.”
“I already own everything I need. You needn’t trouble yourself about me, the second I heard the word ‘gala,’ I was planning.”
“Somehow, it doesn’t feel quite so bad to tell myself that I’ve screwed up, because it would feel a lot more final coming from one of them.”
Harry manages to shield himself and Malfoy from the incoming fire, and knocks back, disarms and petrifies as many as he can see.
Malfoy’s hips and legs were in the worst shape. Finger-shaped bruises in different colours marred his hips, along with a long, thin mark running from the top of his hip bone down his thigh. His knees were a mottled red and purple. His shins were freshly bruised. A large bruise along his right thigh covered most of the outside of his leg.
Draco, no matter how much better he seems, still acts like he’s at the club. Defensive. Afraid. Careful. He expects Harry to hold him to the same unbelievably cruel standards as his old bosses did. To him, it’s simply a less painful version of the same thing.
“Draco?” Harry says gently. He takes Draco’s sweaty hand. “Hey, it’s alright. You’re okay, you’re safe here with me - Harry. No one will hurt you, not anymore.”
“Shush.” Harry mumbles, wrapping his arms tighter around Malfoy’s middle and twisting their legs together.
presents. He gets very excited anytime Harry surprises him with something, and always thanks him with all manner of affection, effusive praise and or sexy things
“Things I think about. I can explain better when I write.” He says. “And some are letters that I messed up writing.”
“Oh, it’s the little Malfoy cockslut.” He snarls when he sees Draco. “Should’ve bitten you when I had the chance.”
He hears a muffled gasp from Drake, but is distracted by Potter taking his own shirt off, revealing rippling muscles. Draco swallows.
“Who was everyone in a previous life?” George says with a flourish. “For example, in a previous life, I believe Percy was a vicar, and the stick up his arse stuck around for this life too.”
“Fuck you, Potter, it's called letting off steam.” Draco sniffs, pulling at his cock absently. “And it's cousin incest not parent-child incest.”
“Il ne parle pas français. Parle en anglais maintenant.” He says to Zabini, who smirks slightly but nods.
"If I'm going to do anything for you, you have to be nice to me." Harry says, sitting on the bed. "Which means no snapping at me."
wanted for me to bring my marks up. How am I supposed to do that without studying?” He points out. Harry grunts, laying across Draco’s lap along the sofa like an overgrown, spoilt cat. Draco pats his bum placatingly.
“I don’t usually, no. Something come out?” Harry asks nervously. He’s rarely read something good in the paper. Robards laughs, pulling a copy from a nearby table that Harry had ignored.
“Surprise me.” Draco says instead of humiliating himself. Jack nods, a private congratulatory nod which doesn’t give anything away to Stewart.
Harry’s words dissolve into laughter as Malfoy starts tickling his armpits, the lotion making his hands slick and impossible to grab and pin back.
“That said.” Draco continues on a whim. “How would you like to come over to mine tonight? I’m a rotten cook but I can throw a frozen pizza in the oven.”
“Beyond what Mister Robards has already explained regarding the events leading up to and including the accidental bond, I can add what Mister Potter had told me in personal conversations at the time, that Draco Malfoy had been nothing but polite, professional and helpful in Mister Potter’s work in his home.
Harry sits back on his heels, making quick work of his clothes, and once he’s naked, he helps Draco remove the last of his.
“No!” Harry protests too quickly. Neville grins. “I just-” Harry runs his hand through his hair, but doesn’t come up with any good reason, so he just leaves the room to Neville’s laughter.
Draco seemed especially excited when it was time to open gifts, although initially, Harry assumed this was due to his love of opening them.
“Well, you probably would be too, if you woke up one day and your eyes were growing to twice their old size. It only took a week for him to Change from how he was before to the way he is now.” George says, continuing to take food from the platter.
“It’s the second.” Malfoy says quietly. “The pulverised Mullein, referred to as Graveyard Dust, affects the olfactory center, which is where smells are processed. Amortentia doesn’t smell like anything, it persuades you to imagine a certain set of smells based on what you already know you like.”
It’s not the same as what had happened at the Ministry, it’s not shock, and it’s not decision fatigue. It’s something else.
“You’re going to ruin me.” He pants, planting both hands in Potter’s hair as he opens up for the rest of the cock.
“Draco doesn’t like him because Hugo used to pull his tail all the time.” Harry says, and Ron and Hermione say
Between the melancholy shower and the lengthy process that is getting dressed, Draco doesn’t make it to breakfast. Greg slides him a scone in Transfig.
“Lovely, thanks.” Harry says, flopping onto the sofa and moving Draco to his chest as he lays back. Draco allows himself to be arranged so Harry’s nose is pressed into his fur and one of his paws is in Harry’s hand and petted softly. Draco has exceptionally cute, soft paws.
“Dobby keeps these here for Master Harry Potter, just in case he might come visiting and want a bite.”
“There’s a curse involved, and various sea creatures. One of them nearly dies but is saved by the power of love.”
The flashes of green light still play behind his eyes when he blinks, and he pets Draco’s fuzzy back absently as he catches his breath. Draco seems fine with curling up on Harry’s chest, contentedly purring.
“I’ve got pants on. You’re naked.” Harry persists, shuffling away as much as he can in such a small bed. “You’ve got absolutely no shame.”
Potter’s mouth twitches a bit, but his face is mostly impassive as he bends to grab some more bottles from the floor.
“I know. And I’m sorry. I’ve… well, I’ve had to work through a lot of feelings around you since you started healing here. For a long time, you only brought out the worst in me.”
“Can I try it? I’ve never had that before.” Harry says, nodding to what appears to be the only glass available. “You don’t have more?”
“After that article about me snogging a man back in… oh, 2001 or whenever it was, Molly sat me down to express her complete acceptance of my sexuality, which was incredibly awkward because then I had to explain bi and pansexuality to her.”
done? Perhaps you’d like a ruler to get consistent spaces between your shit and the desk edge?” Harry asks in irritation.
“What’s been tried so far?” Draco asks, eyeing the tourniquet cutting off the right arm’s circulation. “He’ll lose the hand if that’s not removed very soon.”
Ron and Hermione are heading the other direction, evidently having just come from the kitchen themselves.
Draco moves his hand from where his fingers were resting tentatively. He’ll have to work to remember all these instructions, but Draco is a quick study and he’ll catch on fast. He has to.
The plug is vibrating evenly, but Harry nudges it deeper inside his pet, changing the setting to an almost random pattern. Draco’s stomach clenches and he groans, long and loud.
Draco did not know what he meant. The handsome man explained more later, as Draco whined at the sensation of the cock inside him pressed into a spot that feels much better than everywhere else.
“Not really.” Harry says again. “I’ve talked about him a lot. It does make me sad, to remember him.”
“No, it wasn’t, not really. You were pretty rude about it. But now… I don’t know, you’re so different now, it sometimes scares me. It’s not your fault at all. But I sometimes wonder if you’ll ever recover from what happened to you. It makes me happy whenever a little bit of your personality shines through.”
“Yes, he said he didn’t like the idea of me alone there all night, so he would keep me company.” He repeats.
Short chapter but the next kicks off my favourite part of the story:)) It will also be the last in Harry's POV, at least for a bit. It switches to Draco's POV and I think it'll stay like that for the rest of the story.
“Scots have.” Harry points out. “And tunics are still a thing in some places. Wizards basically wear dresses.”
Harry’s not sure if it’s just an expression, or if Draco is fully aware of its effect and is using it intentionally. He’s also not sure which answer would be cuter.
“When I’m happy, we talk about stuff, we do stuff like baths and cuddling, I tease you, it’s fun, yeah?”
“Those aren’t really conversations. They only last a few minutes.” Potter says. “And I know I’ve only encouraged it.”
“Yeah, went better than I thought. So you want to know if you may not be interested in sex with ladies because you’re more interested in men, right?”
The game continues, featuring questions such as have you eaten frog legs (Draco yes, Potter no), do you speak multiple languages (Draco yes - several, Potter yes - parseltongue), have you had multiple sexual partners at once (Draco yes - ha, Potter no), have you flown in an aeroplane (Potter yes, Draco no), have you ever been tied up in bed (Draco hell yes, Potter 'does being pinned down count?' no).
Thank you all for voting! The top choice was Beauxbaton Boy, which I'll be linking when the final chapter of this goes up:)
in ages. You’re only making fun of my friends, because you know if you made fun of me, I wouldn’t care, not anymore."
“Yes, I’m aware. Anytime I’m entering a long-term physical relationship, I like to move slowly so we have time to get to know each other. I place a great deal of trust in my sexual partners or dominants, and trust has to be built up.”
“The sink water’s good, there are glasses in the cupboard. There’s also some different things in the icebox if you want.” Malfoy says, gesturing to the bar.
“It’s a very vague question, I barely know any of you.” Draco says casually. “Besides that, Potter’s the only one who’s taken me to see any of Romania, so he gets points for that.”
Malfoy doesn’t speak, he seems to be losing himself in the music and dance as he bites his lip and looks down at Harry through heavy lidded eyes. He nods almost imperceptibly, but Harry sees it. His heart pounds in his chest.
“You can sit, if you want.” Harry offers, shifting over a bit on the bench so there’s room for Malfoy, but he drops to the floor where he was standing, sitting on his heels with his hands resting on his thighs. It doesn’t look very comfortable and Malfoy is stiff, looking pained.
There were also plans for the smaller sitting rooms to function as small coffee and tea rooms where guests could visit for refreshments, or pop by and take something to go.
’ It is carefully formatted to have space for more rules, then a note about the hand rubbing and his punishment, as well as a list at the bottom of what things he’s decided are ‘good.’
up to him and say ‘Hey, I like you more than originally planned, would you want to go out sometime. Also I think your arse is fit as hell.’”
He still hasn't taken his wand back, and Harry wiggles it. Malfoy glances down and looks away quickly.
“He has almost no memory of Hogwarts. Actually, I’m not sure he remembers any of it at all. He doesn’t remember me beyond my name, or the Sectumsempra scars.”
“You shouldn’t be allowed to hide it, your Mark.” A voice says from behind Draco. He turns to stand but is hit by something which Vanishes his shirt.
“You shouldn’t, that’s a horrible idea.” Draco says. “That’s not what I’m saying. The point is, if you want them back, it’s time to put the work in.”
“I’m out, mate. I’ve told Hermione we could spend the evening in the library. Enjoy your… attention.” He says with a smirk, getting up and handing the box of beans back to Harry.
“If anyone decides if Jack should be put in prison, shouldn’t it be me?” Draco asks, looking out toward the Wizengamot. “I was the person they hurt at the club. I don’t want Jack to be put in prison. He doesn’t deserve it. The others do. Not Jack.”
Harry grabs a brush and uses blue paint, finding a spot where the sky peeks through the trees and makes it easier to see the paint hovering in the air.
“Why’d you take it off?” Harry asks, stepping into one of the studies to find Neville working on something.
Harry turns his attention to making some breakfast, and after a while, Draco jumps onto Harry’s shoulders, his claws scratching Harry’s bare skin lightly.
Deciding to ignore the nickname for Voldemort, Harry’s about to point out that he only listed two things, but Malfoy pushes his loose shirtsleeve up his left arm.
hold me and take care of me and help me and kiss me when I never did anything nice to you? Not one nice thing.
I have all of you to thank - if it wasn't for your consistent comments and support, I don't think I would've continued writing/posting content (gotta get that sweet sweet serotonin somehow amiright). I am so excited every time I see familiar usernames commenting, and I love whenever there's a new reader whose lil avatar starts becoming a regular. I feel so blesst to have bonded over shared frustration at the originals or squealed together about these two idiots I'm obsessed with finally getting their shit together to kiss.
“I don’t know if you can eat eggs.” Harry says. “Then again, who knows what an animagus can and can’t eat, if you’re even Malfoy to begin with.”
on anyone until Fourth year. Not even you! I mean, if I was going to like a girl, it’d make sense for her to be one of my mates, right?”
“This music is nice.” He says as they sit for dinner. Their food is long cold now, but Draco doesn’t even seem to notice. He might not recognise the dish as usually having been served hot, though.
Draco’s eyes roam his body as he moves, grabbing a tie for his hair from the sink. He knows he’s half hard, has been for awhile. He always seems to be around Draco.
“That makes me upset.” Harry says. Draco doesn’t answer, just wraps his arms on top of Harry’s, where they cross his own chest.
“We’re sure, Harry. It’s been an hour.” Lupin says gently. “Madam Pomfrey’s got his body, she confirmed it.”
“I’ve tried it. I broke the bed frame. It’s not for me.” He says, flexing one arm with a bicep bigger than his head.
"Oh good, I was hoping he would." Draco says, licking the syrup off his fork in a way that should be illegal.
"I- I’ve got to finish that... essay.” Draco continues, grabbing his bag and cursing silently as his ink bottle falls out and smashes on the floor.
“Sounds like a nightmare. I was considered a Potions Master after opening my shop and I didn’t kill anyone for a year.”
“Do you still have glamours on now? I can’t see the scars on your chest, but I felt them there earlier.” Harry changes topics. Malfoy sniffles unhappily for another moment.
“Blaise asked me to stay the night there. He says respectable people don’t have sleepovers with their new boyfriends on the first day of the relationship.”
“No offense taken. I hope you have a wonderful time with him.” Draco says honestly. The man smiles warmly.
Draco’s tears fall onto the pillow. The pain in his bum forgotten, he bites into his tongue harder to keep from sobbing. The handsome man made it clear that would be unwelcome here.
Malfoy scoffs, balling up the camisole and tossing it aside. He pulls his own shirt back over his head.
“I told her a lot of things today. I could not tell her everything at once.” Draco interrupts Harry. “They are not real memories, it does not matter if I keep them.”
“What could Saint Potter ever do against me, a Death Eater.” He challenged. It felt good to joke about something they’d barely spoken of. It felt like the wound had healed along with his new tattoo. Harry feigned shock.
He steps right up behind Harry’s chair, pressing his chest to the backs of Harry’s shoulders. Harry faces forward staring at the camera with a disturbed expression, watching Malfoy in the screen.
Malfoy yawns again, shifting on the ottoman so he’s curled up on his side, hair falling to the floor in a curtain of white.
“Can you listen? I have advice already from Shannon. I will tell you so you don’t worry. I don’t like to hide things from you.”
When Harry finally Apparates back home after spending another forty minutes talking about Hannah with Neville, he goes searching for Draco.
“You’re a really lovely person. You know that?” Harry asks, standing and moving to stand in front of where Draco sits on the stage. “Every day it seems like you’ve got a new idea to make someone’s life better.”
“Ladies first.” Harry says with a smirk, opening the door. Malfoy rolls his eyes but doesn’t look offended, leading the way down the hall.
Greg sits for a minute with them at the table, but when Draco’s stomach growls, he chuckles softly and gets up to make some breakfast.
Several people erupt in Potter’s direction: Inkwood, who is currently throwing a party; Ashe, who prides herself on her parties; Willows, who likes to think he’s everyone’s favourite, apparently; Scarrow, who actually seems like he would throw incredible parties; and Drake, who firmly believes she’s better than everyone else at most things.
him!” Harry insists, trying to remember. The white-blond hair and long, slender legs didn’t help him recall a name.
Draco doesn’t mention Potter knowing about the Unforgivable practise. Or Potter’s extremely low opinion of Greg in general.
This one is in the air, the chilling feeling of wind whistling through clothes prominent. Draco’s on a broom, and as he looks around, Harry sees the Quidditch pitch. It’s a game, judging by everyone in the stands, but there’s no commentary, and the other players below are blurry, moving repetitively like an unfinished thought.
“Draco.” Harry says again. He waves his hand in front of Draco’s face, but gets nothing. “I don’t know if you can hear me or not.” He mutters. “Can you squeeze my hand, like last night?” He asks.
“Oh pretty stupid. But you’ll die of curiosity if you don’t, plus you already gave me your money, so see you there!”
“I used Malfoy’s wand for most of the war.” Potter says abruptly. Everyone looks at him. “That part’s not in the book.”
Harry blinks at her. Suddenly, he realises that if Draco can spend three days locked in his study, he probably did the same for other things he was ‘drawn into’.
“Alright. Okay then, so we find a way to fix this body and then you jump back into it and everything’s splendid, yes? You’ll tell your mum and everyone?”
“Isn't it...” Malfoy begins, resting his head on one hand, elbow impolitely set on the table. “Don’t you miss your friends?”
Both boys held their breath as the running footsteps went past, Malfoy’s wand held aloft between them and trembling with their combined anxiety.
They’d clearly been on the bed. Now Harry’s hair is mussed more than usual and his clothes are in disarray, and once glance at himself tells him he’s not fared better. They’re both out of breath.
“No, not about that.” Draco says, taking a deep breath. “I think I’m ready to have sex, but I want to do it there.” He says in a rush.
Leaving Lucius’ letter under the pillow, Draco puts it from his mind and recalls the hushed alcove meeting with Potter just yesterday that had left him hard and wanting.
that was. Harry keeps pressing into him, eventually adding another finger which is very cold at first, but he starts enjoying it again soon. “How does it feel?”
“Not now. Not… yet.” He concludes. “Soon, but maybe we could ease into it?” He offers, and Harry nods.
“Mm. I can’t wait for the honeymoon.” Draco says with a salacious perusal of Harry’s outfit. Harry grins.
Frowning in concentration, Malfoy drags the brush across the air, and the thin paint stays where the brush had touched, like he was painting on glass.
Harry is back only ten or so minutes later with tea, and Malfoy is back to himself again with his robes done up to his chin and blood red slacks underneath.
“I uh. I like when you pull my hair a bit. I found out that first time we wrestled in my room." Draco says, flustered. He puts his mouth back on Harry’s prick so Harry won’t respond to that embarrassing tidbit. Harry puts his hands back on Draco’s hair, but doesn’t pull this time, likely to avoid choking hazards.
“Okay.” He heard Draco whisper back, and Harry waited a moment before sticking his head into the living room.
“Yes, we are friends.” Draco says flatly. “And I have nothing to say about his presence here. Go away.”
“Hello Potter, I didn't realise you had unrestricted access to our home.” She says mildly. Harry opens his mouth, but she continues. “I saw him going outside to the side gardens.”
Draco leans in closer, twisting his hands into that absurd mane of jet black hair. It’s coarse and curls around his fingers so divinely. It feels sturdy enough to tug on, and he does, earning him a soft moan from Potter.
“I’ve got three kids, they need to eat. Everything I earn goes to them. They’re all at boarding school so that they don’t live with me in an alley with a dozen other people.”
“Brilliant!” George says cheerfully. “So we’ll use that in the colognes. We’ve got to find a way to change it so it’s stable, doesn’t get more potent over time, you know?”
“I wrote them to you.” Draco says, running his finger along the edge of the folded page. “Some of them are just drafts. Not finished. Badly written. Some are… very nice love letters.”
“Nearly, those are my favourite colours. Well, and the spring green, but it’s not as common in luxury items.”
When they finally get around to Harry’s favourite part of the evening, the dance, he has to forcibly keep his hand in place on her waist.
“What are you going to do? Take away house points? Gryffindor will win after my dearest darling wins the war for us. Call my father? From what I hear, neither one of us is on speaking terms with him currently, so I doubt that’ll do much good. Anyway, as I’m of age, I no longer answer to my father.”
“Yeah, interested? I’ve been told I’m excellent.” He says, wiggling his eyebrows. She rolls her eyes.
Harry cries, finally sitting up. “If he doesn’t fancy me back, he’ll be the most insufferable twat about it.”
The tamers all Apparate to the reserve together, but Draco goes straight home for a hot bath and some reading.
“Yes. It didn’t work. He couldn’t lose his job.” Draco says, looking away from the examiner to Jack, who stared at the floor.
“Potter, I’ve been looking for you. You read the papers?” Robards asks as Harry is making two cups of tea Monday morning.
“Right, most wizards use quill pens. Yours is called a fountain pen, the ink is stored inside it, it’s muggle.”
Harry mounts his broom normally and kicks off to hover just off the ground, holds steady, then starts trying to plant his feet on the broomstick.
Harry hadn’t had to deal with much shit from Malfoy this year, preoccupied with murder and treason as he was, but now that he’s not so distressed and conflicted, it leaves more space for gittishness in his mind.
For once, Greg let Draco curl up into his side as he had when they were children, and which Draco blames for his love of cuddles, Greg and people bigger than him in general.
Draco is sitting crankily on the kitchen table, the green ribbon tied in a large, messy bow at the back of his neck with long tails hanging around the front. He also has a pointed muggle party hat held on by an elastic around his chin. He doesn’t look pleased.
He crosses the floor to stand in front of Draco’s cot. His hand reaches out easily, and though Draco flinches away, he tucks a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. The phantom brush of his fingers makes Draco’s skin tingle.
“It is our home.” Draco says, his eyes moving between both of Harry’s. “It is your second Christmas present.”
“I was waiting for you.” Harry admits. Malfoy’s heavy-lidded eyes blink closed slowly as he smiles lazily.
“Furthermore, when we return in the new year, we will be welcoming some guests all the way from Bulgaria - the Durmstrang Quidditch teams.”
He turns to face them, and Harry watches frozen as the girl Vanishes the bandage around Draco’s left forearm. Harry is close enough that he can hear the cloth tear away scabs.
“Have you ever ridden a horse?” Inkwood asks, and moves out from under Ashe and one seat over into Potter’s empty seat. Potter doesn’t move, but Draco does, along with Weasley, Prott and Scarrow.
Harry plugs the tub and starts filling it, and after poking about some cupboards for a moment, finds several tall purple pillar candles and a glass vase full of dried rose petals.
“Do you live here alone?” Harry asks in surprise, the house silent around them suggesting not even servants live here.
“Well, I’ll be, I was just starting to think I’d have to fire you for skipping out.” Neville says with a generous smile.
Deflating a bit, Greg lifts the blankets for Draco to slip in beside him. They sit up against the headboard, listing into each other.
He makes them Draco’s favourite breakfast, quaffles (Draco didn’t write it down so he remembered the wrong name and Harry hasn’t corrected him) with tea and jam. He keeps stroking Draco’s hand anytime he can.
Draco moves to lay on top of Harry, twining their legs together and holding Harry’s hand against his lips.
“Accio, rubbish bin.” He whispers, catching it as it flies to him. He holds it in front of Draco in time for him to puke into it.
“I know. It’s to prove I’m serious about you. Do you know how hard it is to find fresh roses at this time of year?”
“She’s got a point, Potter.” Draco laughs, digging his fingers into Potter’s thick muscles rather greedily.
The trip to St. Mungo’s is dreadful, and when he steps out, he has to take a moment to regain his bearings.
Holding himself above Malfoy on his elbows, Harry works himself in, the squeeze nearly enough for him to come like that. Malfoy’s hands push Harry’s shirt further off his shoulders onto his arms. Malfoy grips Harry’s biceps.
“You know, when ‘Mione had Crookshanks at school, she was always talking about a cat’s purrs accelerating physical healing somehow, like hidden magic in a muggle animal.” Harry huffs a little, and Draco lifts his head as the sudden movement jostles him.
As the memory ends and the new one starts, Draco allows Harry to see deeper, to almost hear Draco’s thoughts.
“Someone told him about the higher education system muggles use. Usually, unless you have six years worth of higher education, you’re called Mr. or Mrs. instead of Professor.”
“I- shut the fuck up, bastard, I’m about to put your enormous cock in my mouth, the least you can do is be grateful.” Draco says, giving Harry the most severe look he can muster. Harry presses his lips together, clearly trying not to laugh and not doing a very good job at it.
"Don't die on me, Malfoy, my love, you've got to pull through-" Malfoy wheezes, curling up so Harry's hitting his shoulders and sides.
Harry picks out something nice for Draco to wear. He remembers how Draco used to dress, and while he’s usually given him muggle clothes, he hopes that something similar to what he used to wear will help him be more at ease in the busy shops.
“You know, you can just say you want my company.” Harry says mildly, rinsing off his brush and dipping it into the red.
“Guess who taught him the spell!” Draco finally screams. Something breaks behind him, but he doesn’t turn to see. “Guess who the
Harry sits back the way Draco is, looking up at the sky. The hum of the bugs nearby is soothing rather than irritating. Draco’s hand finds its way back into Harry’s coat pocket.
“This one’s closer, definitely.” Harry says. “I don’t think it’s quite right, but it’s closer. You really like showing off your tits, huh.”
“Fortunately, they’re not the bad ones, I’ll give you potions to clear your system. You got lucky on that front.”
The heels click along the floor, and Harry feels a bit like a newborn pony trying to walk for the first time. His ankles wobble, but Malfoy keeps him upright.
The show began to wind down as it grew later. Harry had no regrets about not performing, as he would’ve missed this production being backstage.
Draco presses his lips together, turning to walk away and find a place to sit and eat his cooling lunch.
“All he would say is that you told him you regretted it happening, so he wanted to save you the trouble of having him around.”
“If you see something you think you’d like to wear, you can pick it up. When we’re done looking at everything, we bring it all to the front and pay for it.”
Ron relays the whole embarrassing situation beginning with pre-Hogwarts bed cuddling and ending with Harry’s ill-advised snog.
Harry snorts, but continues anyway. His fingers find the studs above Malfoy’s arse and tweak one, making Malfoy squeak.
Hermione tilts her head, looking at Harry like she looks at homework problems. Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
“Oh.” Draco says, turning his head to face Harry, facing still pointed sky-ward. “Is it a Malfoy tradition, too?”
A few minutes later, he has a detailed list of things Draco should be fine to eat, and he heads next to a party store.
The royal advisors, Severus, Minerva and Remus, enter through a smaller door, moving toward the throne.
“Unpacking. Well, trying to.” Malfoy says, his entire upper half disappearing into his trunk as he digs around. “I can’t find my other pink boot.”
“Your… your cock?” He asks groggily. He looks down at the limp cock in Draco’s hand. Draco is crying.
Hermione was clearly involved in the planning, as Draco’d been connected with Dean, who is a successful artist now with wonderful paintings hanging in all sorts of important people’s homes, as well as Harry’s.
Potter shrugs, leaning against Draco’s desk. He makes the simple action look obscene somehow, and Draco pulls his eyes north of Potter’s belt.
“If you want. I asked you to come so I can make sure you’re fed before you go home. But I’d like for it to be a date, too.” Harry admits.
“Oh.” Harry says. “It’s- It’s a crane, you used to fold those in school sometimes. Do you remember?”
“I wonder if that means you’ll be able to get your memory back from before, it seems like it’s still in your head somewhere if you could remember names.”
“I mean, at first it’s just, you were new, you know? We always want to learn about the new person. It was the same when Skylar first got here. Everyone wanted to know why she was just leaving society at eighteen to join us hermits out here in the middle of nothing.”
Draco sighs, shaking his head. He often wonders if his own parents would have made life this difficult had they been alive to see him now.
He excuses himself by saying goodbye to Harry and leaving the table, running his fingers along the wall to keep from walking into it.
Ahh I've rewritten the outline again and mainly bc I really Can't with this story, we're ending it a bit more abruptly than originally planned
Every time Harry has used the desk, it’s been tidy and clean. But now, there are papers with notes written in his lovely handwriting, his notebook lying out and two books off to the side.
“You’re right, that is pretty creepy.” Malfoy says, pausing. “But I’m the same, so I suppose it cancels out, doesn’t it?”
“I hate when you do that.” He grumbles, and a little smile softens Malfoy’s features. “I didn’t know you thought I regretted it.”
Draco holds his wand a foot or so away from his arm, murmurs something under his breath, then yanks his wand back like he’s snapping a thread. He uses his own wand to set up Ron’s wand as the holster’s companion with some other nearly silent spells.
Between the two of them, they make short work of the pie, and Harry licks off his fork to reuse on the treacle tart.
Before leaving the bathroom, Harry snaps a discreet photo of Malfoy, focused on something on his mobile, and posts it with every dancing emoji he can find.
“This is a good place to talk.” Malfoy says, sitting back with his teacup and sipping at it slowly. “So ask away.”
“No, we didn’t have to. Dementors answered to me because of-” Malfoy gestures at his arm, where the Mark isn’t anymore.
Prott is dared to talk in a British accent for the next hour, and everyone cringes as he does it horribly.
Finally, he leaves with a receipt and orders to return at the end of the work day for the final fitting with no idea of what he’ll be wearing.
“It doesn’t quite feel fair for you to be off the hook for the questions, though.” Inkwood says with a shrug. “Anyway, Aspen’s book says a test of Occlumency is shield duration, so if Harry casts Legilimency on you, and you keep him out for a certain amount of time, that’ll determine how strong of an Occlumens you are.”
“These will clear the STDs from your system, and prevent the lust potion withdrawals. Would you like to know what’s in them?” She offers. Draco shrugs.
“And anyway, you woke me up a fair amount too.” Harry reminds him. “By the way, I’ve got a recording of you praising my flying abilities that I can and will show our whole class if you decide to be a problem again.”
Harry pulls Malfoy into his chest and holds him there, cheek pressed to the top of Malfoy’s black hair. After a moment, Malfoy’s arms circle Harry's waist.
Harry has started getting a tad short with Ron, though he apologises for it and explains it away as frustration with how long the work’s taking.
He feels freshly terrible when he remembers what had happened when he’d sliced Draco open - dismissed it as
"You weren't responsible." Potter says immediately, almost like it was an automatic response he didn't think about. Like he'd thought about it before.
“No, I didn’t tell them.” Malfoy says dryly, not an ounce of tone in the statement. It makes it impossible to decipher what he might be thinking. “Just politely requested them to not mention it to you in lieu of our considerable history.”
The man Draco’s with moves again, starting to fuck into Draco more. Taking his cue, Draco starts riding him.
Draco grumbles as he’s tossed unceremoniously onto the bed, but Harry pins him down with searing kisses that drive him mad, with the promise of more in the morning.
He realises later that the Slytherin dorms are quite a long walk from the bathroom, and that Malfoy has some balls to walk down there at 3a in nothing but a towel.
“Do you remember what you’ve worn while you’ve been here? Or what you wore when you first came here?”
“I think he would if I asked.” Harry shrugs, picking up speed and darting off in Malfoy’s direction.
If they want to think Malfoy is being girly for Harry, then let them see Harry spitting in the face of their concept of masculinity.
Harry scoops a pliant Draco up, making sure to bring the notebook. When he lays Draco down and tucks him into the blankets, Draco is just staring at the ceiling. Harry takes a book and tries to read while Draco… does whatever he’s doing.
He’s not really sure why. He just feels stupid and foolish. Idiotic, to think taking Malfoy out would fix anything, that he could solve Malfoy’s discomfort by bringing him into a world he’d never been part of and now could never fit into.
“No.” Draco agrees. “Though I’m fairly certain a trip here will eat up any time you’ve saved by cutting corners.”
Mr. and Mrs. Weasley walk at the front of the little group, each holding one of Rose’s hands as she and Mr. Weasley marvel at the lights dancing on the houses.
“Well for one, I believe one should always be prepared for unexpected company. For another, it’s fun.”
“I suppose I survived being target practise in the halls before, I’ll get used to it. I didn’t have you to talk to before, either.” He says. It does feel less awful than if he’d been alone as he was earlier this year.
“Quite a temper on you.” The man says dryly. “Should be interesting. You’re being kept here for your own safety. You’re wanted by the Ministry for treason. They’ve already got your parents, and they’ll face the Kiss. You’ll stay here if you know what’s good for you.”
When they try to get two cocks inside him at once, his accidental magic lashes out, and all eight men are thrown to the edges of the room.
It’s Hogsmeade weekend, and Dean and Seamus are probably the only Seventh years that are staying in the dorms.
In the week since Harry agreed to do… whatever he did with Malfoy, Malfoy had been shockingly non antagonistic, brewing potions peacefully without commenting on Harry’s when Slughorn praised him for his work, not sneering when something had gone wrong with Hermione’s and she’d received a bad grade.
“I- okay. Thank you.” Harry lets Draco hug him. It feels strange, naked like this, and he tries to keep his hips back, away from Draco’s. Draco’s head fits itself into the crook of his neck. He’s so quiet, Harry usually forgets Draco is actually taller than him.
“I don’t think so.” Harry says, raising his eyebrows. “And I think I would know if I did. You’re easier to be around, though. So I don’t… I don’t despise you.”
Harry has gotten better at mingling, chatting meaninglessly with the people who approach him. His fame, which used to bother him so much he’d wished he was invisible, is a useful tool now.
“It’s a convertible, the roof comes off and I haven’t put it back on for winter yet.” Harry explains. “We’ll throw on a notice-me-not so we don’t get funny looks leaving the city.”
“What’ll it be, lads?” He asks casually, but his eyes linger on Draco. Draco quirks a brow in success, and Jack hides his grin by turning to grab two fresh glasses.
Harry doesn't need to move the mirror, it's exactly where it was before and bigger this time, so their entire bodies are visible.
“Draco, I thought I heard you Apparate in. No coffee this morning? Harry says you’re usually at breakfast with everyone.” He says, clapping Draco roughly on the shoulder.
The house is in the middle of nothing. There’s no forest to hide, only flat grounds as far as he can see in the darkness. He stops running, looking around for somewhere to go.
Scarrow very carefully stands up and wobbles over to the kitchen, where he straightens up, appears to give himself sort of a pep talk, and turns back to the circle.
After a frustrating day at training, Harry Apparates home, tired and sore, but finds himself at the gate to Malfoy Manor instead.
“Goooooood evening, ladies and gentlemen!” She shouts, grinning. “If you wouldn’t mind finding a drink and taking your seats, first game’s about to get started!”
“It’s alright, you don’t need to be sorry for being sick.” Harry says, rubbing Draco’s shoulder. “Can you try eating a piece of bread?”
This man is hard. He's hard against Draco’s thigh and doing nothing to hide it. He's rocking his hips into Draco in time with the music, his arms blocking Draco’s escape. Keeps telling Draco what a pretty boy he is.
He knows Draco keeps all his clothes hung neatly in the closet, and has his pants folded up and tucked in the front of the drawer with Harry’s, which are wadded up and shoved carelessly. Maybe Draco should have his own dresser to keep things.
“Where do you expect him to go? I doubt he’ll have friends, the Ministry certainly won’t help. That leaves him alone. Maybe he could go to the Manor, but no one will be there. He’ll be vulnerable to another abduction or attack, not to mention he’ll develop horrible coping mechanisms.”
Even as he shrinks back down to his current size, all points and angles, Malfoy draws his bony knees up, hunching in on himself and seeming even tinier than he is.
“I always… I. Whenever he gets like that, I just feel like… like I can’t take care of even myself, let alone Astoria. What kind of husband can’t take care of his wife?”
Harry grabs his hands away, stilling them against the floor. Draco huffs, dropping his head back again.
“Are you going to be good for me, pet? Wait for the timer to finish? Or do we need to be done today and start over tomorrow? Again.” Harry says softly.
“I heard from my dad.” Olivia interrupts. “Draco never talked about you before teaching here, but… well, he does now, with quite vigor. I’ll leave it at that.”
Draco doesn’t react to anything Harry does, but he keeps talking anyway. About Quidditch, about Dean and Seamus’ wedding, about a book he started reading, anything he can think of.
"They can restrain themselves!" Malfoy protests. "Particularly if it's mine, they make sure I've had my fill first."
In reality, Harry’s been trying to avoid looking at Malfoy. At least his front, though he’s far less successful in avoiding eye contact with Malfoy’s bum.
Draco hasn’t moved since she started, even his shaking has stopped. But that worries Harry more than anything.
But that’s how he finds himself with one hand on her waist and the other in her hers. He shivers as her thumb strokes lightly down Harry’s neck from where her wrist lies on his shoulder.
“Bill Weasley, cursebreaker, powerful wizard, has agreed to cast the Imperius curse on both his brother, Ron Weasley, as well as me, in a demonstration.”
“Oh, that’s smart.” Harry says, recalling Dumbledore using the same method. “Dunno why I didn’t think of that.”
, faster, harder, insistent, Harry imagines shoving the skirt aside, pulling Malfoy’s pants down and taking him right here, in this corridor where Malfoy’s whines can be heard by the Durmstrangs in the Great Hall.
“I’m alright, thanks. Have to keep my figure, you know.” Malfoy says, patting his flat belly. Harry snorts.
rules are, whether or not Draco expects him to follow the same, or if he has his own separate rules.
“I don’t think so, no. See, I’ve been trying for months. Maybe a year now.” Draco says, gesturing to the knife. He holds up his arm for Harry to look at. Scattered around with the fresh cuts are scars in different stages of healing, some clearly from long ago. His mouth drops open. “Tried to get rid of this, but I’m a coward.” He whispers, staring at the mark.
“I don’t know. I don’t know if I’ve had it cast on me before. But I can stop him very easily. I was mad he tried.”
Now only in silk pants, Malfoy glances over his shoulder at Harry watching him. His hand is hovering over folded black material, and Harry realises it’s half a question.
He finds him and Ron throwing Bertie Bott’s candy beans into each others’ mouths from across either side of an alcove.
They talk about ordinary things like their houses and Neville’s ideas for the business and Ron’s promotion.
He’s right. There are a few people in the Ministry still who refuse to work with Malfoy, they only cooperate with Harry. It’s infuriating, but Malfoy brushes it off anytime Harry tries to bring it up.
“C-Crabbe.” He cries, staring at where a seventeen-year old Slytherin lay amongst the rubble and corpses. His sleeve was rolled up to reveal the bottom edge of a Dark Mark.
“You… can absolutely not answer me. But… how did you get there?” Harry asks, halfway done with his own food and looking at Malfoy’s completely cleared dish. Malfoy stares at his empty plate for a long, quiet moment.
“I’m really not that hard to understand.” Draco says. “There are some complexities in my life, but I myself am not that complicated.”
“It seems like… at least most of the employees knew. But they knew they couldn’t do anything or they’d be fired, maybe tortured or Obliviated themselves.” Harry finally says.
“You didn’t like me. Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.” He says quietly. “But… but Blaise did. And Jack did, and… they-”
“No, the kind I like aren’t the type of shoe to be worn regularly. Most pureblood wizards are fond of a heel, but typically wear it in a boot and not a sandal.”
“No! He gifted me full ownership of The Three Broomsticks as well as including a lengthy, heartfelt apology for everything he put me through when he was a child. His generosity allowed me to open a second restaurant in Derbyshire as well as purchase a lovely home in London.”
“So can I, Triss, you’re not special.” Ashe says hoarsely, winking at Knox. “What about you, Harry?”
Malfoy is now wearing a shiny, champagne coloured dress that shone in the light. It has tiny straps holding it up, and his tits are barely covered by fabric. The skirt starts at his waist, but is in two pieces, exposing his legs all the way up above his hips, and Harry can’t tear his eyes away.
People tend to assume he is unarmed when they see his empty right hand, but Draco has started favouring his left for such things to catch them off guard.
The variety of acts grew, and Harry wondered who had set the program, as it was a perfect order of pacing, a loud followed by a quiet act, a fast paced followed by a slower. Really well done, and it kept the crowd’s energy high and enthusiasm going.
“I know.” Draco says, sitting a bit closer to Harry on the sofa than is customary, and although Zabini definitely thinks it’s weird, he doesn’t mention it. At least Draco hadn’t sat on Harry's lap, that might have been too strange for Zabini.
“Oh but it is, everyone’s too busy admiring me that they don’t notice they’re giving away important information.” She says. “It’s perfect for that.”
“Yes. Mrs. Weasley told me that Ron told her I like apples, so she brought me one from her garden. It was yellow. I recognise the smell.”
Watching Malfoy twirl around in circles from a distance, Harry would almost think him smaller than he is, as he looks just like the stuff of storybooks Harry had seen growing up. Tiny enough to wear a foxglove as a hat, as suggested in one of the books he’d read.
“You know, there is a shocking amount of gay boys there, someone should do a study on it.” Harry says.
“Gross. I’m sorry I haven’t come to bed yet, I didn’t think they’d be gone so long. Ron and I’ve got a bit more to do on this before morning.” Harry says apologetically, rubbing his hands from Draco’s knees to hips. It’s
“Unrefined? You wanna keep riding that high horse or will you deign to grace us mere mortals with your comments?” Archie says angrily.
” The demanding voice shaking with need, betraying the command as what it really was, a desperate plea.
By the time Harry does get up, he’s feeling refreshed and surprisingly well rested despite getting his usual four and a half hours of sleep.
Rough hands yank his clothes out of the way, and two fingers shove their way inside him without warning. Draco bites his tongue.
“No? I guess that makes sense, we were asking about why your health was the way it was.” Harry says gently. “Are those the questions you mean?”
“Better, I think? It’s really hard to tell.” Harry says. “I think he’s stopped thinking that he’s just there to… service me. I’ve had to explain it to him a couple times. But he’s getting more comfortable, maybe?”
“Malfoy wouldn’t just take off without warning if he wasn’t intending to come back.” Harry frowns. He pets Draco, though it’s more to comfort himself than anything. He doesn’t want to think about why Malfoy disappearing for good troubles him so much.
“I was a bit bored earlier. Hoped maybe you’d be done quickly and we could have some fun tonight.” Draco says lightly, shifting his hips a little.
keeping things from him, but I won’t say anything.” Harry promises. “If it’s important to the case, though, you should tell him yourself.”
"Oh everyone I've slept with in the last six or so years." Draco says easily. "Alright then: ordinary conversation between two blokes who have a history more complex than a spider’s web. How do you like working here? Do you see yourself doing this for the foreseeable future?”
“He’s actually gotten a lot better than the first night. If I’m there, he’ll answer your questions honestly. He uh… at the club, he was abused. Clearly. But there were rules that, if he followed them, he would be hurt less. He was really confused after I brought him out, didn’t know what he was allowed to do or not do, kept thinking he was in trouble for everything, so I made a new set of rules with him. That’s why he won’t take his clothes off, I said he should stay clothed with people who aren’t me, he’s usually naked at home.”
Rebecca makes a strangled noise, flinching, again and again and again and again. With a shriek, her hand drops her wand as she jumps back, nearly falling over in her chair before she manages to run over to a rubbish bin and puke.
“I wonder if you liked shopping before. I’d seen you several times in Diagon Alley, but you were usually in some sort of mood anyway. I actually met you for the first time in a robe shop before we went to Hogwarts for First year.”
“It’s okay, Harry.” Draco says quietly, ripping off part of the page and letting it fall into the fire. He tears a second piece, and a third. “I forgive you for hurting me.”
Draco carefully closed his book, setting it aside as he too sat up, keeping eye contact with Harry’s mischievous green eyes.
He opened the door slowly, seeing Draco curled up in the armchair by the fireplace reading a novel. It was… really cute.
“You know, it’s sort of cute that you think you can hurt me.” He says bitterly. No one responds. “Funny you should mention prison, I actually learned a lot there.”
Draco grabs Harry’s hand, pressing it against his cock. He thrusts against Harry’s palm with a moan.
“You slept through all our morning classes. Don’t worry, I have notes.” Draco says. Harry shakes his head.
“Madam Rosmerta.” Robards began. “Will you please describe how you spent your winter from 1996 through 1997’s spring?”
Harry lets Draco take his hands, put Harry’s hand on his shoulder, which is ridiculous since he’s a good head shorter than Harry even with boots on.
“I hope you change your mind.” Robards says, and Draco reappears dressed as he had been the first time Harry had seen him this summer, black shirt and tie, trousers, jacket and shoes.
“Do you think you’ll get used to shopping?” Harry asks gently. “I know it overwhelms you now, but maybe as you recover, it won’t be so bad.”
“Alright. It might feel funny coming off, but it shouldn’t hurt.” She says, pointing her wand. Two murmured spells later, and the band snaps open and lays in a straight line. Draco picks it up, looking at it.
“I’m with ‘Mione on this, finding a benefactor who could fund their salaries I think is the best option.” He says. “In fact, I’d like to start off the donations with my part of the Black fortune - I think old Wallburga would be pissed about it, and that’s a good tribute to Sirius. Maybe I’ll poke around the house to find her portrait to tell her.” Harry says with a grin.
“I don’t know about that. But it’s certainly been much harder than I thought at first. Like I said earlier, there were a lot of fuck ups, I’ve said things I shouldn’t’ve, done things, upset him in ways I still don’t really understand.”
“Fine. We’re on our own, no backup until you send a Patronus, so stay conscious or we’re shit out of luck.” She says. Harry snickers.
He doesn’t manage to get his pants back up before Draco’s tongue swipes along the ridge and Harry gasps, his head falling back.
"Of course you can. You can take 'there was only one bed' and turn it into a full length novel that people will buy, given a real plot I reckon it'll fly off the shelves."
all the way to England on Christmas Eve, but Prott is taking a Portkey, Draco is using the floo and Willows says he’s ‘playing it by ear,’ which most likely means he’ll ask to borrow Draco’s floo the day-of.
“You take forever.” Harry mutters, quickly leaving the room before the problem in his pants becomes a
“I don’t have detailed knowledge of him because, unlike you, I didn’t spend seven years stalking him and watching him like a hawk.”
Draco moves very willingly into Harry’s arms, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder so his lips brush against Harry’s throat.
Following the sound, Harry walks as quietly as he can, finding Malfoy lying on his stomach, watching bees work on the flowers, his bare feet kicking in the air.
Carlotta gives him one final squeeze of the hand before she leaves the floor, glancing around warily.
“Oh I like that idea.” Draco breathes, downing the last of his beer and standing. “May I sit on your lap?”
Peppy sets the plate on a small cleared section of the desk, along with a large glass of water. She moves Draco’s hand with the mug back to the desk, and removes his fingers from it to put them on the sandwich she’s brought up.
Draco is still in the bedroom when Harry passes through toward the bathroom. He speaks just before Harry picks up his towel.
“You have a lake? Of course you have a lake.” Harry snorts. “How have I lived here for a week and I haven’t heard of it?”
Harry snorts, plucking a bit of moss out of the tray before it’s snatched back by Malfoy, accompanied by a slap to Harry’s hand.
“Right. Okay.” Malfoy whispers. “I- remember at the flat, when you asked if I… if I got fucked before?”
Seconds later, a tall, lanky blond took his place, clad in high heeled black ankle boots, black boxers and an oversized white button down.
“Yes.” Draco says. He steps forward, flipping to the back cover of the book to reveal a large pocket with a single blank page inside. He pulls his blue sparkly pen out of the snuff box and passes it to her. “Write something on here. Not a creature's name.”
Hermione is talking about her work with Mrs. Weasley, who tuts over the state of things. Ron mentions some things about the aurors here and there, but it’s mostly Hermione.
Malfoy did say that he occasionally wakes up in bed with one of the other boys in his room, and he does sleep naked. So-
Given that he’s spent around ten years as an Occlumens, Draco is rather confident in his abilities. Because of that, he reasons, there’s no need for Potter to see anything at all if Draco just taps out right before his shields give.
Ron knocks his knee against Harry’s thigh with a knowing grin and a pointed look at where Harry had only started tearing away the wrappings. Harry flushes and resumes.
Harry wants to laugh, strangely. Draco is here after four years of relentless torment, fresh off an encounter with his abusers, and he wants Harry to improve his own mental health too.
“I’m too old to keep carrying you.” He complains as he settles with Draco on his lap, curled against his chest.
“So if I was never Meredith again? If I burned everything in that closet and never spoke of it again, you’re interested?” Malfoy asks.
Ashe answers her most embarrassing caught-by-parents story- masturbating to a picture of some muggle singer Draco doesn’t recognise the name of.
Malfoy stops by his desk to pull on a pair of socks and remove his cloak, revealing the silky golden dress shirt and dark red slacks the dress had transformed into. It looks gala-worthy, and Harry wonders if Malfoy doesn’t want anyone knowing he can
"It sounds like you really lucked out with that." Harry says absently. Malfoy gives him a questioning look. "Everything you've mentioned is a good thing. The wands, getting rid of the Mark, the hypno-eyes."
“Well.” Potter shrugs. “So no, I probably won’t be here forever. I'm really not that passionate about dragons anyway. But right now, it’s hard to imagine going back to the Burrow and pretending everything’s fine.”
“Correct.” Malfoy snaps. “Preferably not in front of any upper-year Slytherins, though. And Ravenclaws, they’re smart. Even a Seventh year Hufflepuff might realise-”
Draco mourns the loss of the memory. He thinks it might have been nice. He feels warm like he'd been happy, however briefly.
“There’s leftover pork from yesterday, should be good on sandwiches.” Harry says, running his fingers through his hair as it tickles his forehead. “Do you know a barber nearby?”
“Naturally. I had no reason to rescue you. But since I did, and have been keeping you safe here, I expect you to return the favour. Unless you prefer the Dementors?”
“Oh hello! How’s your cat?” One of the employees who had helped Harry the last time asks him cheerily.
To Harry’s relief, Draco is able to keep his smaller breakfast down, and eats another slice of toast after.
“You have an incredible memory.” Harry praises. “And I promise I will never punish you for something that isn’t in the rules.”
Draco slumps against the wall, still missing a shirt. Harry sees the raised white lines that he’d put there.
“No, you said ‘I suppose,’ and I thought you were answering a different question. I’m glad you are going, though.” He hurried to add, as Draco was starting to look like he was second-guessing his decision to show up.
