"Boiled with a side of tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Preferably with a couple of slices of toast," he replied, placing his mug of coffee on the table. He had to admit, though grudgingly, Granger's coffee was as good as the one he usually made.
Conscious, Draco covered the mark with his right palm and blocked it from Ron's sight. "He doesn't need to know. Besides, he doesn't care," Draco replied, itching for a second fag.
led us to. We shagged, like you wanted,” Draco said. “I still am the whore you need,” Draco whispered so softly that it never reached Harry’s ears.
“If it’ll make you feel better, I’ll give you my sundae,” Ginny said.
“Will you take me back after I am completely healed?” Harry asked feebly, blinking back tears of hopelessness.
From the pocket of his Auror uniform, Harry took out a small red ring box and placed it on the ground within Malfoy's reach before assuming his former posture.
“You like that, huh, Harry?” Draco asked, throwing the wand away and giving his unwavering attention to the wound on Harry’s waist. Using his fingers deftly, he played with the wounds, scratching them, pressing into them, and pinching them – left one on Harry’s chest and his right one on Harry’s waist. More tears escaped his husband’s eyes and Draco wound his legs around Harry’s middle, pulling him close. “Answer me, darling,” he cooed in Harry’s ear seductively.
Harry smirked. "Ten seconds. Don't make me count them down."
“The last time he was here, I wasn’t bothered,” Draco divulged sharply. Though he was still apprehensive about his situation with Harry, Draco wanted to communicate with his husband. The tiny bit of hope lurking around the corners of his heart wanted a chance to mend the battered tapestry that was their lives.
The first step in rehabilitation was to admit that there’s something wrong with you. Harry had accepted that his anger was causing issues in his life and not many patients of hers do it. Denial. It’s as strong an emotion as it’s a word. It hindered whatever progress that could be made and closed in on its target. When it had been taken care of, then would come the actual problem of finding out which space the person found himself in. Did he love himself extremely or was it the other way round? If they did either one of them, why? Everything would be built around the simplest of questions – Why? How? What? When? Until, such a time when the patient would be ready to face the hardest question of the lot – Who?
“What’s wrong with
"Another chance to copulate with me and another chance to finally kill me. Is that what you meant?” he asked calmly. “’Coz your interview with the Press certainly gave off the vibes,” he continued.
“Where’s ‘Mione?” Ron panted.
Thank you Madcheshirefox, Rose, Babygirl33, Scarsandstars, IamMyself, Irisk, and Jacqueline for your comments!
"How's your nose?"
~ Wheezy
“Yes, I am a poof for you, Draco, and I’m quite certain that deep down, you want this too,” Harry remarked.
"But how? I mean, I'm so frigging happy about it but didn't the Healers say... otherwise, 'Mione?" Harry asked.
, Draco. Tell me; what happened?”
Thank you Madcheshirefox, Irisk, MadamePerverell, Kikukaku, canadianliverfailure for your precious reviews.
Pulling in a deep one, he looked at Harry, who was now sporting a bright red bruise on his right jaw. He’d been a punching bag and a whore that miscarried to Harry because of the choice he made. But as he previously said, he wasn’t really given a choice exactly. The choices were already made for him by external forces. Despite what he wanted, Draco had to go with the choice that was crafted for him. Taking the Mark was loads better than losing his family. Taking Harry’s hand in marriage had seemed a better place than slowly losing his sanity until he was administered the Kiss.
“Yes, I was. I wanted to move on from my past. That was one of the reasons I went back to Draco. We are similar. I can’t explain it properly but he and I, we’re the same though we were on the opposite sides of the war. Maybe that’s what made our situations so similar. I felt like he’d understand me when no one else did. And to my surprise, he’s all I ever asked for. I was happy to be by his side but,” Harry trailed off.
“You’ll be having a round stomach instead, Draco, given that you don’t work out,” Harry pointed out.
Thank you for all the support, guys! Here's the promised update. God, it's been so long and churning out a fresh chapter just took away so much tension from my mind.
“Good. Have you contacted him lately?”
“How do you fly?” she asked and her question seemed so dense to Harry.
“I don’t want to talk about it so can you just give it a rest?” Draco said after a pregnant pause.
The Press flocked his office even before he reached there and his colleagues looked at him with sympathy cloaked in apologetic faces because they couldn’t stop the media anymore. After the Prophet printed about the loss of his baby, the media couldn’t seem to calm down. They wanted more and Harry had nothing to give. He remembered acquiescing to the media’s presence as he sat down in his chair, locked the door to his office, cast a silencing charm so that the media’s enthusiastic questions wouldn’t reach the ears of his colleagues, and waved a hand at them to proceed.
“Then yes.”
“I’ll go and check on them now, okay? Please calm down,” Ron sat her down on the sofa while he shook her head. “No, I’ll go,” she insisted.
“You can’t subdue Harry if he… you know, gets violent. Besides, I’ll die worrying about you, love. Let me handle this,” he pacified her until she acquiesced, albeit reluctantly.
"Let's NOT think about it, please?" Harry interrupted them and heard them sigh in dejection.
Since seeing a Mind Healer apparently brought a change of attitude in his husband, Draco wondered if he could be cured too. His right hand involuntarily found the burns on his Mark yet again. This time, he didn’t pinch them but traced them with his thumb. Could he be saved from the abysmal pit of nothingness after all? Did he
“Yes, Mr. Potter. We are currently trying to dampen the connection Draco’s core has to your magic, as your husband, and to the baby’s magic as its Father. Good news is that we’ve stabilized him but the bad news is, we don’t know when his core will break free and start eating away at your baby’s magic because the protective shell created by your magic is almost gone due to his late admittance here. We will do our best in retrieving both of them,” Yeager said with a hint of sorrow in his voice.
"I kinda have this problem with...," Dean said to Sam in a fearful voice, waving his hand back and forth.
‘I deserve it.’
“We have sex, don’t we?” Harry shrugged and the motion annoyed Draco to no end. Ron winced as if the words physically hurt him.
"Please, Potter, it would be inglorious of me. I put your gift in your wardrobe. Feel free to dig it out," Draco answered and without further ado, Harry rushed towards their bedroom for his gift like a child, followed by Draco, who nervously wished to see if Harry accepted his gift or not.
“How long?”
Well, isn't it just a far-off dream?
“Fine then,” Draco gave in because it was exactly as Harry said. There was no denying or burying the truth. He sat down on the sofa and gestured Harry to do the same. Once they were seated, Draco asked with a sneer, “What prompted you to bawl your eyes out like a baby earlier?”
"Flying?" Sam asked.
"Hello guys!" Harry's greeting was a bit more enthusiastic than Draco's but that was to be expected as he knew the guys in the room, unlike Draco.
“Get your nasty self off me, Potter, now!” Draco was beyond coherent thoughts as his mind and heart raced with similar revolting intensity. For the first time in all the years he’d known Potter, he felt terrified of the man rutting shamelessly against him, spewing obnoxious words that were so not the boy he once used to know.
“I’m not here to hurt you, Draco. Please, stop struggling and let me heal you,” Harry’s face contorted painfully, desperately willing Draco to give him a chance to prove himself. His heart was racing wildly and when Draco stopped throwing his limbs around and relaxed into a calm posture, he smiled down at the blonde who was looking at him cautiously.
With a last fleeting look at Rose and the others, Draco walked past the ward, cradling a tightness in his chest which was almost the weight of a hundred giants put together. The second hardest part was journeying through the crowd scattered in the ground floor towards the Floo Networks. Every look pierced him like a thousand needles. He could hear them blame him even with their mouths tightly smashed shut into a thin line. Their respect and love for Harry Potter only kept him safe from their wrath.
“What is it, Draco?” Harry smiled even harder as he put a few packs of Lays in the trolley.
Draco couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He believed that something changed between them. Heck, he even started to question his kind-of warm feelings for his husband which were more than just romantic and lustful. He would’ve fallen in love if they walked that road but this incident wiped the slate clean of anything that might subtly even allude to like or love or happiness.
"Ronald Weasley?" his throat felt sore as he spoke.
And loneliness, Draco realized scathingly, turns you into someone you never thought you were.
“Say my name or we stop right here. You have one minute,” Harry ignored Draco’s protests.
“Remind me who put me here, Potter. Besides, I DO own the place,” Draco shot back, wiggling his ring finger encircled by his wedding band for Harry to look, and howled silently when Harry’s knee kicked him in the small of his lower back.
“Is Potter not your name?” Draco shot back.
“You’re welcome,” Ginny said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why should I?” Anger bubbled in every part of his body. His magic thrummed in his every vein asking; no, demanding to be released.
“No, don’t. I know I said I’ll give you time but your condition is only getting worse with passing time. I can’t stand on the sidelines and watch you destroy yourself.”
“St Mungo’s,” he whispered clearly and soon they were floating through a good number of chimneys. Harry put his arms around Hermione – one round her torso and the other round her protruding belly, and stayed close to her lest she or he should be hit by the walls of the fireplaces they were passing through.
"They'll be fine, Harry," Hermione said but she didn't believe her own words. There was a high chance of miscarriage but she prayed for the baby and Draco to be alright. She didn't agree with Harry's methods but if Draco's carelessness murdered the child, she didn't have the heart in her to forgive him. Maybe, he didn’t know that newly conceived babies could die of alcohol ingestion. But Draco was ready to abort the child. Hermione saw it in the man’s eyes yesterday; his need to get rid of the baby. She glanced at her husband and Ron simply nodded at her.
“I’m sorry. Please, Draco, let’s talk,” Harry requested.
“Interesting,” Draco cooed. “So, you never bothered to get to know why?” Draco asked in succession.
- Graphic sex with penetration, Twisted Harry Potter, short chapter
“Thank you,” he relaxed into the chair.
And the woes of her Godfather, Harry Potter, prolong.
“Mate, you alright now?” Ron’s voice broke the stupor that took over the pair.
It was precisely at that moment, Draco's heart throbbed in something that wasn't pain, something that was clearly happiness and fondness as he watched Harry smile widely before saying, "Thank you, guys!" in a nasal tone. For the first time, he wanted Harry to look at him with the same intensity of affection and love he directed towards his friends and Draco reluctantly realized that he was extremely jealous of Ronald and his wife for making Harry smile like that when he couldn't. It hit him hard as he didn't want to accept his heart pounding for one Harry Potter. So, he decided to ignore the thudding inside his chest and not dwell on it anymore but to his dismay, his eyes already looked at Harry differently. They were irrevocably focused on every inch of Harry's face and his shirtless expanse of chest and slightly swelled stomach that was so unlike an Auror.
Why he had ever agreed with Harry to let his Floo connection always remain open for Ronald and Hermione, he would never know. He should've said no and this untimely visit wouldn't have happened. He rolled his eyes when Ronald's voice yelled Harry's name again, followed by Hermione saying, "Don't shout, Ron!" Draco supposed those guys were right outside the bedroom door waiting for Harry to open it.
“You can’t take it; can you, when I point out your mistakes?”
And then there were some unsaid lines between them.
“This isn’t about me, Mr. Potter. It doesn’t matter to me if you think my office is foreboding or tasteless. Each has his opinion. The road to recovery will be the path you walk on and I believe it is you who must choose it. It’s difficult to live by someone else’s choices,” her voice was motherly to his ears.
“Potter,” Draco whimpered when he felt his husband’s tip position at his ready and inviting aperture.
"You wouldn't. You can't," Draco smirked as he moved down, causing Harry's tip to slip in a little and his husband groaned mutely above him.
"You can't take my name away from me, Potter," he hissed through clenched teeth as his hand gripped Harry's bicep tightly.
“Draco, look. I wanted a family. And I wanted you to be a part of it. So I did what I did,” Harry explained.
"Naturally, it's impossible for me, as the Healers said. We asked for an artificial alternative and the Healer prescribed me a Pregnancy Potion. Artificial pregnancy to produce the eggs and reform the uterus so I'll still be able to carry the child as usual but the delivery will not be normal. You need magical means to deliver the baby," she finished.
all these months, were you?” there was a tired resignation in Harry’s tone.
My baby girl is waiting to meet her Uncle Draco. Drop in anytime.
“You don’t specifically need me, Harry, and you know it too,” Draco said without breaking eye contact.
"He must be. And so must the baby. I don't know what I'd do without either of them," Harry paced as he spoke.
“Yes. That much I am sure of. But he needs a source to feed off of at least for the first few months just for stability. Else, his magic will act up like that of a child and could harm him and others around him. Currently, his core is feeding on the baby’s undeveloped magic and the protective shell of magic surrounding the baby which was formed by your intervention,” he continued.
Sifting through his cupboard, Harry found a small rectangular package under his Auror uniforms and proceeded to unwrap it. Round black glasses without lens, so similar to the ones he wore but way more sturdy and authentic, sat in a wooden box.
P.S. Lie17, I loved your profile pic. Yuri on Ice is one of my favorite animes!
“Maybe. But I never intended to. I will not let you go back to that place. Not after all this time,” the promise in Harry’s words struck a pleasant chord in Draco’s heart. It sang to him that he would forever be safe from that godforsaken place. Then its pleasance faded and was soon replaced by nothingness once he remembered that Harry was equally dangerous. The days when he lived in this very house in a state of constant fear of his life and sanity flashed before his eyes. His helpless cries when his unstable magic wrecked their home in search of Harry’s magic rang in his ears. And just like that, the thread snapped.
Surprisingly, Harry waited for Draco to finish. When Draco heard Harry cough a couple of times, he sighed, stood up, and opened the window to let all the exquisite smoke out. “Thank you,” he heard Harry murmur and he grunted in acknowledgment.
"God, this tastes awful!" he exclaimed to no one in particular.
“Yes,” Draco replied and watched as Harry brought the cigarette to his lips and sucked on it rashly, like a first-timer usually did; like Draco had done on the grounds outside his Manor all those months ago.
Within minutes, the group found themselves in St Mungo's and Harry screamed for a Healer to look at his spouse immediately. The lady at the front desk rushed towards them, ordering the Chosen One to remain calm before calling for a Healer, who came along with two helpers.

Yet, things have changed beyond recognition.
Thank you Eraramech, CherylMercury, Im_a_bird, Lie17 for your support through comments!
“If you’re afraid of losing control, take someone along with you. They will keep an eye on you and stop you when you’re going too far.”
Then, he screamed gutturally.
"Come closer, you prat," Harry said as they broke the kiss for air but then realized that there was no space in between their bodies except for two layers of clothing.
“I hope that one day you will,” Harry answered without pause.
“I’ll let you in on a little secret,” Ginny said as she watched Draco snitch another spoonful of her ice cream. “The one I ordered is Harry’s favorite.”
“Would you please stop blubbering like an idiot and get on with whatever you came here for?” Draco said tiredly.
Still, he put the tube back in his mouth and tried the same for the second time. His lungs seemed to adjust to the invasion for he didn't break into a coughing fit but did choke once or twice. When he pulled for the third time, the action seemed rather pleasant and his head bobbed back, hitting the Manor's wall in a silent thud. He didn't understand why he felt so open, so good but could feel all the blood rush half to his head and half towards his nether regions. He craved more. Fourth time felt like an orgasm was being ripped out of him and his hips swayed suavely searching for contact as his erection pressed into his trousers. Draco's face was surrounded by thick smoke he blew out and he even wanted to inhale it. The act was heavenly and his body felt so weak and high at the same time. He fell to the gravel road and his hand with the bud lay to his side, completely forgotten. All the thoughts that weighed him down, his parents' death, fearful days in Azkaban, Harry abandoning him, the miscarriage, him being a Death Eater, Harry spitting on him, the Prophet calling him a murderer, Harry calling him a murderer, Harry making love to a stranger on their sofa in their home, his failed attempts at erasing his mark, him pathetically starting to develop feelings for Harry... He simply forgot them all.
“Ten minutes?! Doing my hair takes longer than that!” his complaints remained unheard.
Harry’s palm traced Draco’s right side slowly, starting from his hip to his underarm as if he was trying to find something hidden. When Draco squirmed, Harry grinned and repeated the motion on the other side, causing the blonde to squirm harder.
The digital clock clicking away on top of the Television box read eleven in the night and his stomach growled.
Immediately, Ron slid his arms under Harry’s shoulders and dragged him away from the wall. The cream wall was now blotted with Harry’s blood on the spot where Harry hit it. Harry struggled in Ron’s grip but he couldn’t shake his friend off of him as he wasn’t as big or strong as Ron, physically.
"We face that all the time, Mr. Weasley. When he calms down, talk him into attending the counseling sessions, please. I can sense that Harry Potter has anger issues which haven't been dealt with after the war. It was hard on all of us but we weren't the ones who faced the Dark Lord. Harry did. And, I strongly believe that his mind is very much unstable at the moment, despite his semblance. If left alone, he could be lost to all those who care for him," he patted Ron's shoulder and inclined his head respectfully towards Hermione before leaving them alone to mull over what he said.
Even now Harry couldn't understand why Draco would be unwilling to create a family with him. If he'd asked Draco to carry his child for them, he wouldn't have. He was pretty sure of it. Biologically, it wasn't a man's responsibility to carry and care for life. Yet, he wanted to have that happiness together with his husband - the joy Ron had. Harry wanted to watch Draco grow fat to accommodate the growth of their child. He wanted to carry a pregnant Draco in his arms no matter how much it hurt and show the world how beautiful they'd be. How happy they'd be. And how wrong people had been in assuming that Harry sharing his life with Draco was a terrible idea. It might've been selfish of him and he was certain that Draco would throw a raging fit once he was educated about his condition. Never once did Harry imagine that Draco would be capable of murdering an unborn child. He didn't count Draco to be such a barbarian. Yet now, considering Draco's actions, he's being forced to think otherwise.
As he felt the disdainful stares on him increment, Draco wanted to go back to the confines of his smoke filled room and hold a wholesome cherry between his hips. Inhale its purity. Slurp at the lingering bitterness after. Now that he thought about it, he didn’t
“You don’t mean that,” Draco hated the way his voice shook. Harry meant what he said. Draco could see it in the man's unforgiving green eyes.
“What do you mean why?” he snapped.
“Look, Draco, you have been absolute shite to all of us in the past; I can’t deny that I hate you for it – every second of it. But we’re adults now, not children anymore and I think it’s high time we moved on from our collective past. I may not forget it but I choose to forgive,” never once did she break eye contact with Draco during her monologue and Draco was so deeply pulled into her words that he maintained that bridge of connection between them. Then she broke it by staring at the wall.
“You bastard!” Draco said dangerously. “If anyone, ANYONE at all is to blame for the death of the baby, it is you. Don’t you go prancing around accusing me of killing it because I never did!”
"Why should HE be okay with it?" Ron queried.
~ Wheezy
“Some couples like to hit each other and it helps them find gratification sexually. Rough play. Dominance and Submission.”
"Doesn't it feel like deja vu to you?" Draco queried. His head was spinning at the similarities in their meetings.
"Do you think he's read it already?" Ron asked.
When the Healer smiled encouragingly and followed him to the door, Harry was suddenly overcome with the tiniest bit of hope that he would be cured and he turned around to address her once he was out of her office.
"Draco, bloody hell, mate! Are you mental?!" a hand, Draco guessed, slapped his own hands away and the put-out bud rolled on the gravel.
"No," he shook his head adamantly in refusal.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Here, this is for you. I knitted it myself," Molly said and placed a huge package in both their laps.
Three weeks after their anniversary, on a rather warm Spring Sunday, Draco and Harry found themselves at the Weasleys for lunch. Draco felt queasy but he wouldn’t give up on Molly’s cooking for anything in the world. He thought that whatever was troubling him would pass once his stomach had its fill of Molly’s delectable food. But, his condition only worsened as his stomach started somersaulting a few minutes after lunch. Abandoning his one-sided conversation with Hermione about the Architectural development of the Wizarding World, he rushed to the nearest bathroom and emptied the contents of his stomach rather violently.
"Ugh," Draco gasped so loud that had they any neighbors, they'd surely hear it.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
"No. I won't listen to anything you say. I don't care that the Malfoy estates are now yours. Don't make me lose the ONE THING I've been given by my parents. You HAVE to know how I feel, Potter," Malfoy cut Harry off with his rant.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
Ropes materialized out of thin air and bound the blonde from the neck down, his hands plastered to his sides with no give. Draco never stopped thrashing, even though he was bound as he tried to push away from Harry however much possible with his bound bare feet, on the kitchen floor like a fish out of water, yelling at Harry to release him all the while promising that he would go to his room and never come out.
“Yet you do not have the freedom to break in,” he countered futilely and before Rita could smart-mouth him, he asked the reporters, “What do you want to know?”
Just to spite Harry, Draco wanted to remain intransigent yet he sat there, hands apart, staring daggers at the old lady opposite him who wasn’t in the least hiding her distaste for him. He contemplated
"For you, darling," Harry spoke aloud the sentence he wrote down in the paper Draco was holding.
“Disillusionment Charm! I can use it on myself. No, my magic isn’t strong enough to perform such a complex charm. You can do it, can’t you?” he asked excitedly but Ginny looked unfazed. He could already read her expression that screamed there would be no Disillusionment Charm involved whatsoever during their trip to town.
"Can you check the mail, Draco? I'll hang up our coats," Harry requested, taking Draco's coat when the blonde nodded his head in affirmation.
The letter which Hermione sent crinkled annoyingly on the tea table and Draco grudgingly resolved to visit Ron and Hermione’s home that evening. He would go see the baby, give her a gift probably, and if this resolve of his didn’t melt completely by then, he would talk to Harry once again if the man looked sane enough. Just a casual talk; an exchange of common pleasantries. The thought of it seemed so foreign that his heart pounded against his ribcage in a mixture of anticipation and excitement.
Imagine his surprise, when for the second time, he found one Hermione Granger lounging about in the Kitchen, cradling a mug of coffee - Draco's precious coffee at that! Only this time, she looked plump and extremely cute wearing her pregnancy fat. Draco was beyond horrified that he put cute and Granger in one sentence but before he could recover from it, she got up and fixed a cuppa for Draco.
“Because -,” Draco tried to think of anything; something so that Ronald would leave him alone. What could he say? Why was he still staying? If he said he liked Harry, would Ronald leave him alone? But, that would be lying as Draco still wasn’t sure that he liked the man after everything that’s happened between them. If anything, he could admit that he was fond of the man as long as neither of them hurt each other either physically or mentally. Did he need Harry for the sex? But he could live and had lived without sex for so long that it wasn’t necessary for his life. Yes, he’d appreciate some pleasure but it wasn’t mandatory. Somehow, his silence seemed loud and answerable enough to both of them. He had no choice but to stay there. It was inevitable. And, Ronald knew. His stare bore deep into Draco and he wanted nothing more than to hide. It was as if the ginger-head could read his thoughts and point out his fears.
"Expelliarmus," Harry's whisper was dangerously silent and unnecessary. He could've wrenched Draco's wand out of the man's hand if he wanted to but there was something about using magic that induced an incredible surge of power in him. The feeling only intensified when Draco started thrashing in his hold, frantically ordering Harry to let go of him.
Ron quietly looked at the pair and sighed for what seemed like the thousandth time.
“No, Potter. I didn’t let them have a piece of me and I won’t let you too,” Draco spat venomously.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
“You do know the implications of bringing me wherever you want, don’t you?” he asked.
“A light neon green,” Harry nodded and the bottle was immediately added in their to-buy list by Draco.
Thank you for all the Kudos!
“Hold on, Draco,” Harry was trying to have some sense of control over his body as he applied a good quantity of lube on his own member. Looking down at an utterly rumpled Draco was not helping and he closed his eyes just to maintain his erection. Their moment of intimacy finally arrived and Harry didn’t want to spoil it by cutting it short.
"Binding his magic temporarily," one of the guys answered Harry's doubts and he nodded in acknowledgment.
"You have NOTHING to be sorry about. I should be doing the apologizing for what I did," Harry said, tracing his eyes over Draco's wounds.
“I didn’t see the necessity in sending one,” Draco retorted weakly.
That got Malfoy to open his eyes and stare hard into Potter's green eyes alight with nothing but dark intentions. Anything, anything at all, was better than dying but Draco couldn't fathom whether he could live with marrying Potter just to escape death. And not to mention his absolute loathing for the man. What would his Father say about this union? Imagine the horror of tainting his bloodline with Potter's filthy half-blood lineage!
“Mate, what are you doing?!” Ron exclaimed in concern. Hermione stood near the door with her palms plastered over her mouth, unable to take in the horror she witnessed not only then but the day before. She hadn’t imagined that her best friend, who always smiled and always felt like home, would be reduced to an angry slobbering mess.
Harry let Draco talk. He knew how much pain Draco needed to get off his chest and one of these days, he had been planning to introduce Draco to Healer Arya Reynolds. It would do both of them immense good if they wished to stay together; especially, if Draco wanted to be with him even after the pain Harry put him through. Given their situation, it didn’t seem highly likely that they’d remain together after everything was said and done.
“No. What purpose would it serve? I already freed you,” Harry’s eyes found Draco’s at this instant, an action which seemed too intimate and overbearing at the same time for Draco. Yet, he didn’t look away. Nor did he blink as he feared the little moment of companionship formed between them like a fine thread would snap.
“Well, can you get him for me? Do I have to ask for everything?” he said irritably.
When he came back from the hospital, Sebastian was nowhere to be found and he got no explanation except a small note from Hermione in the bird’s cage which read – ‘Until you get better, we’ll look after him. I will visit when I can; IF I can. Take care, Draco. I’m sorry.’ The absence of the owl hurt him more than it should’ve but even he knew that he was in no position to take care of himself, let alone another living being. At least, his owl was in a better place than him. Sebastian had no blame to carry and no pain to feel. He was free where Draco was bound. And Hermione’s half-arsed apology changed nothing at all.
Please do leave a kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
Harry raised a palm, effectively stopping Rita, who was about to ask something. They had their turn and now, it was Harry’s.
Harry gulped back the tears of shame that filled rapidly behind his eyes at Draco's acknowledgment of his interview.
“Mum will be here any minute, Harry,” he heard Ron.
Yet, they followed him every single night. He screamed in unison with the Hermione in his dreams. He felt all the cuts rip him open and scar him just like it had happened to his friends. He could feel Death holding his soul not so gently and plucking it out of his body and he would open his eyes to a peaceful night, a silent scream gurgling in his throat, begging for all of it to stop. Then, he would sob into his pillow as images of all the dead people he held dear - Sirius, Remus, Fred, Tonks, and many more - flashed in front of his eyes like a movie.
“Don’t you frigging dare tell me where I belong, you old hag!” Draco cursed. The anger he so desperately tried to contain in the confines of his mind and heart seemed to burst like an overblown balloon. More than a few heads turned in his direction; more than a couple of wands pointed discreetly at him. With his head held high, he spat one apoplectic look at the witch which left her scrambling for words to hurt him. He felt his magic waver and coil out of his body. It was not good. Letting out his magic would be a blunder hence he needed to calm down. If only everyone stopped looking at him like dirt stuck to their shoes! He closed his eyes and tried to take deep breaths in an attempt to reign in his uncontrollable magic. It was supposed to work but why wasn’t it? The pressure of getting hit by a curse from his onlookers was so heavy that his mind couldn’t focus on his magical core.
"Surely, Draco," Harry replied as if it was obvious.
“Um, it’s 3 Galleons 13 Sickles 6 Knuts,” the boy informed and when Ginny was about to pay the whole amount, Draco stopped her.
Draco was more than okay with it.
“You’re so freaking amazing, Draco. So beautiful,” Harry kissed every bit of Draco’s face as he rushed them to a point of pain and pleasure mixed together.
His voice didn’t falter with reluctance but was filled with a confidence that only resided in the truest of truths.
They were a couple of degenerates. Even though he despised Harry for giving him as much pain as happiness, Draco’s heart raced wildly at the thought of Harry eating him up,
Thank you, all, for welcoming me back, for your warm kudos and comments and sticking with me even though I haven't updated since very long. Please do expect frequent updates from now on.
When Malfoy didn't respond, Harry sighed exasperatedly, as if leaving Draco to his death was physically hurting him instead, and got up to leave. He didn't even step a foot away from the blonde when Malfoy's hand shot forward and gingerly picked up the ring box Harry had placed in front of him earlier. Taking a few steps back, Harry watched as Malfoy sat up with great difficulty and pried open the red box. For a while, he wasn't sure if Malfoy, with an expression of disgust, was just examining the platinum and gold ring he purchased for this occasion or was about to throw it away.
He imagined how exhilarating sex would be with Draco but that was a thought for another day. Just not today.
Wheezy.
“If you’d only taken into consideration that it was my FIRST time and had been a bit gentle AND used a condom from your gift collection, I’d have been okay,” Draco replied, blushing red partly in anger and partly in embarrassment.
“Do you hate him?” she asked.
Harry gulped. Under the golden light filling every corner of the bathroom, Harry took his time to actually observe Draco. His eyes traveled from Draco’s now wet hair to his eyes rimmed with dark circles which made his already pale flesh look ghostly white; then to his lips which darkened in color with black edges due to Draco’s frequent smoking; his body which looked thinner than he remembered; and his outstretched arms – the Mark which Harry spat on sat glaring at him with tinges of something Harry could only make out to be greyish bubbles and red lines. Without his glasses, Harry couldn’t clearly see what was marring the Mark and he squinted to get a closer look. At once, all that he wanted to talk melted away into nothingness.
“So you know how to heal cuts?” Draco asked snidely, the first one to break the awkward silence between them.
“Forgive me. I know you are not joking,” Draco spoke, clutching at his stomach, trying to calm himself down from the high of laughing so much at a stretch. He would not like to admit to anyone else, not even Harry, but the silence that usually surrounded him these days that yes, he’d like to venture out into the public to go shopping or eat at a restaurant or simply a park to sit on the bench and smell the green grass and wet soil. Yet, he also knew it was impossible. People would simultaneously hurl rocks and spells at him if he dared to roam out in the public like a free man. His marriage to the Chose One might have dissolved the rest of his time in Azkaban but it certainly did not absolve him of his crimes. He was still a criminal on the loose under the guise of Harry Potter’s husband.
"You would've never consented to it. Think about this, Draco. We have a chance at being parents; one which we previously thought wasn't possible. To be frank, I didn't think the potion would work. Not until today," Harry approached Draco and sat beside him and Hermione moved to accommodate him, though her hand remained squarely on Draco’s.
“I can’t take you to Mum’s as she’s still bitter about your… condition,” Ron said, clearing his throat.
After what felt like hours but only a few minutes, Draco regained control and he blinked furiously to look down at himself. He'd not known that he sat down. Seeing that his lit bud was almost at an end he proceeded to put it out using the road but then stopped abruptly, an idea striking his mind in the eleventh hour.
The realization hit him like whiplash and Draco dropped his wand arm back to his side. Not bothering to be secretive anymore now that he was pretty sure that no one broke into their house, he strode into the living room. There they were on the sofa, his husband rocking his hips with another man, their erections as clear as a summer morning, with only boxers tethering them to whatever meagre modesty they have left. The stranger noticed Draco first and pushed Harry away and his husband, not expecting the shove, fell on the ground. Draco would’ve laughed if only he hadn’t found his husband cheating on him with someone else IN THEIR HOME!
(See the end of the chapter for
“We brought Sebastian back. He’s in the living room,” Hermione revealed not so excitedly, nonetheless, trying to cheer Draco up.
Harry came stumbling in with Draco’s two suitcases and a large duffel bag filled with clothes and other essentials they’ve purchased for Draco now that his possessions had long been gone before coming to this place.
“No offense, Harry, dear, but I think Draco is safe here,” Molly interjected sharply.
"Shut up, 'Mione, and get the hell out. Both of you. This is between me and my husband," Harry cut her off before she had the chance to say something.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
“Harry only gets worse around Draco and I’m afraid he’ll do something he’ll regret,” Hermione mumbled, her hands fisting Ron’s nightshirt tightly until they wrinkled.
Tomorrow would be a new day to live better.
“Mate, I think you need to sit down for this,” Ron said.
By evening, he realized that he was out of Marlboro Lights too and he needed money to purchase them. If anyone had ever told him as a Malfoy that one day, he’d be completely broke and would beg for money from Harry Potter, he would’ve scoffed indignantly and murdered the guy for even thinking of such blasphemy. Now though, he needed the money, at least to buy a pack of Lights.
“We can fly, can’t we?” Draco had asked. He wanted to know what it’d be like after all those years of yearning for a chance to fly away. Flying was something he desperately missed and when his eyes found a cluster of them in the garage, Draco couldn’t help the words of interest tumbling out of his lips.
- Welcome! And that moment of realization is yet to come.
His mind screamed at him and he blanked out momentarily. He shook his head in an attempt to clear his thoughts before paying attention to Arya.
There was literally NOTHING fresh about Fresh Market and Draco simply couldn’t understand why Potter ordered groceries from such a ghastly shop. When he heard its name, Draco thought there would be thousands of fruits, vegetables, kinds of seafood, poultry places in hundreds of stalls and people would be flocking everywhere. Yet, Fresh Market was just a small shop that took up rather large floor space. There were no stalls but fruits and vegetables were put in big baskets on one corner of the first floor. In another corner, there was a glass partition that opened into a smelly room, where all kinds of aquatic animals – common and exotic were placed on crushed ice. That room had been chillier than the rest of the shop. There was another partition too in which bottles of whiskey, wine, rum, gin, and tonic took up the shelves in an aesthetic sequence. There were many shelves from one corner of the floor to the other, on which several packed, tinned, and processed foods were placed. There were four to five refrigerators that had frozen items – frozen chicken, fish, peas, corn, tofu, and many more.
“What is it with you uncultured people? This is
“Dammit, you’re running a fever,” Harry felt guilt rush through him for not noticing Draco’s condition. Draco lay pliant under his hands and only whined once when Harry touched his armpits as he was slightly ticklish there.
“Careful,” he whispered.
"I think I deserve an explanation if I'm going to choose you, Potter," Malfoy snapped, his voice breaking pathetically towards the end.
Inhale.
It was another month before the money in his reserves was down to the last sickle. Since Harry had stopped coming home after beating him to a pulp, Draco lacked the sickles his husband brought home for him. Previously, he didn’t require them as Harry ordered groceries to be delivered to their doorstep since Draco couldn’t go out alone into the public. Now, as Draco scrutinized the empty refrigerator and his empty wallet, he supposed he should do something about it. He previously attached a letter and sent Sebastian out to deliver it but he didn’t receive any response from Harry even after two days.
"I see," Draco drawled, holding back the urge to punch something. He was extremely angry at everything. At himself for never making the right choices in his life. At Harry for breaking whatever self-worth that he held protected despite the adversities in his life. At Harry’s brainless toads for friends for always siding with the hero even though he clearly was in the wrong. And their half-arsed apologies didn’t matter in the least.
“What should I do?” Draco murmured and looked up at Ron. “What can I even do?” he asked.
“God, no!” his answer was immediate, like the strike of a snake. “I think I married him because I wanted to see how loss looked like. To be given everything and later stripped off of it must be scarring, don’t you think?”
"Let me go! LET ME GO!" When Draco didn't stop yelling, Harry wandlessly accioed a kitchen knife and pressed it under Draco's chin, in line with his throat. At once, Draco shut his mouth; he didn't even gulp for he feared he'd accidentally cut his Adam's apple on the knife doing so. His body stilled, though his respiration quadrupled in intensity. Draco could feel his heart thudding maddeningly against his ribcage and he couldn't calm down, not with a knife at his throat.
“I’m sorry,” Harry whispered, pressing a chaste kiss on Draco’s head, his own tears cascading down and mingling with Draco’s tears.
Draco was sitting at his dining chair, having his dinner. There was no use in waiting for Harry because the man never seemed to come home after Draco's miscarriage. They never really addressed the issue and Draco very well knew that a discussion was long overdue.
Immediately, Harry pulled out a vial from his pocket and emptied the transparent liquid into Draco’s Espresso.
"They didn't. Your newly-formed magical core did," Ron replied, clearing away any further questions Draco might've had. Oh, how wrong he was as Draco still had a few more questions for Ronald.
"Cold medication does that. If it's okay with you, shall I wake him up with a spell?" Hermione asked and Ron snorted indignantly.
Tears of anger and betrayal rained down his cheeks like flooded rivers. If looks could kill, Harry would've turned to ashes under the intensity of Draco's stare.
“Get out,” Draco said spitefully.
“Don’t couples have sex, Draco? Or should I give you the talk?” Harry asked.
“Blimey, mate, no! I Flooed in and you guys weren’t downstairs. So I figured you’d be here and I heard you yelling. I had to make sure that no one was hurt,” Ron said apologetically and Draco snorted.
telling me this? Granger, I can understand but why you? And why now?” Draco asked when Ron stopped speaking. Just a couple of days ago (probably a week or two before), they talked, didn’t they? Yes, they were furious with each other and Draco threw punches but they
They did as told and his ring sat snugly once again against his ring finger. He had officially and legally chosen to become a Potter. Even his Father’s name was no longer attached to his first name after the exchange was done.
implied self-harm
the Dark Lord’s Mark to taint his skin, Draco paved the path for his destruction. When his eye caught a pack of Marlboro sitting invitingly on the tea table, Draco’s hands leapt for it urgently and he lit a cigarette. It didn’t matter that Harry was eyeing him and the cig with a look of utter distaste. It didn’t matter that he was spiraling down into an abyss of rot that he could probably never recover from. All that mattered was in order to tune out Harry and his own thoughts, Draco needed an external stimulant.
He heard Harry’s voice in his head when for the umpteenth time, Harry’s eyes swept over him.
“Why are you on my side? I don’t deserve it, not over your friendship with Harry,” Draco said.
That was the last needle, the thousandth one, and Harry breathed deeply, taking into account all the inquisitive eyes of the seven reporters sat in front of him in transfigured chairs.
“It can also mean that I don’t want to fly,” Harry retorted.
Ginny grinned at Draco’s obvious attempt at normalization.
“It’s not me, Draco. It’s what Harry decided. I cannot go against it,” she said apologetically.
Harry learned then that Draco liked to eat rice and added an extra bag to their basket. The time where he ordered for one turned into two and he could not explain the warm fuzzy feeling engulfing his heart like a tsunami. Draco scrutinized every shelf for things he might have wanted and whatever caught his interest went into their basket. When they came face to face with condoms, Draco had flushed a light rose color. In the Wizarding world, condoms were only available in the apothecary and they weren’t even that necessary as there were always protection spells. One could say, condoms were only a ‘kink’ for the wizards and not a necessity.
“Was it pity because his parents died just like yours?” This one hit close to home yet Harry gritted his teeth and listened to all of their questions which pierced every inch of his skin and soul like a thousand needles.
“I think I better go home,” Draco said, wanting to be left alone. 'Your home is Azkaban, Death Eater!' he distinctly heard another stranger, a man, scream but Draco couldn't point the man's head in the crowd. He didn’t want to be talked down by these people nor did he want to be saved by Harry. This is what his life had come down to. He couldn’t go anywhere of his own accord without Harry for protection. Though he’s out of Azkaban, he’s barely independent.
Years ago, the Wizarding World got rid of all the Dark Lord's supporters and gave a handful a chance to live free albeit without their magic and away from the only world they knew. You were one of that handful because I appealed for you. I don't know how or if the others released along with you survived but you did. I made sure you did. I broke you apart and glued you to me. I broke myself and fit myself in your wreckage. If you were the broken bowl, I was the golden lining that brought us together. Neither can survive beautifully without the other. But the thing with gold is, it can be melted and redesigned. I allowed myself to not be the gold stuck between the cracks of the bowl. I broke free. In doing so, the bowl held no form anymore. It turned to jagged faces and cutting edges once more. Was I wrong? Everyone tells me I'm not wrong. No, not everyone. Just 'Mione and Ron. 'You chose what made you happy, Harry. We are with you no matter what,' that's what 'Mione said to me the day I decided to get married to Ginny. If only I had the guts to come to you... I wronged you, yes, but I wasn't wrong in choosing my happiness, was I? If I asked you this now, what would you say to me? Would you tell me to shove it and leave you alone like I did for the past twelve years? Or would you assure me that what I had done was for the best for the both of us? Or would you turn violent and slap or punch or kick me? I fear the worst of all though... Your indifference. Yes, I think I'd be absolutely terrified if you act as if I'm no one to you.
- None
“It doesn’t matter,” his voice echoed his thoughts.
"The Ministry wards no longer locate this place. Harry made sure that no Ministry wards were in place before buying the Manor and coming to me with the papers and asking me to place new wards on the place. So, I did. Only the Weasleys and the Potters can walk these grounds," Ron said.
(See the end of the chapter for
I didn't want to cause a scene so I invited you in, locked the door and told you that I was sorry for whatever I had done to you, that we could work things out and be together once more. I begged you not to marry Ginerva. You never even wanted to wear a promise ring and the ones I bought for us still sit at the bottom of my wardrobe waiting for your acceptance. And you came home that day with a ring on your finger and all I could think about was – 'What about the rings I bought for us?'
At that dubious realization, Harry only pummeled the wall harder.
“No,” Draco repeated strongly and Ronald sighed exasperatedly.
Harry sighed. He didn’t want to be there being treated like a person who’s broken in their head. Yet, he was the one who implored his best friends to help him. Even as he sat on a comfortable chair in his Mind Healer’s office, he could see flashes of blood and he could hear howls of pain and terror. He wanted it all gone.
“I really wanted to have a family of my own, ‘Mione. Is it wrong of me to have a child with my husband? With Draco?” he asked, his bright green eyes glassy due to tears.
?” Ron queried.
Harry grimaced yet he nodded in reluctant acceptance.
Pain was good. It kept him sane in the absence of his Lights, which he quite frequently required in the presence of his husband. The slashes on his back would be a constant reminder of what they were to each other. The Hero and his villain who never had a choice in choosing the said roles.
Thirty minutes later, Draco made his way down the stairs quickly as he could not bear one more minute of Ginny’s incessant grumbling. He was dressed in a plain white button-down shirt and black trousers, upon which he threw a long black robe with glassy green borders which looked eerily similar to his school robes, save for the tie and the house emblem. This time, he made sure to not gel his hair back and leave it free and falling over his face. At least, he could partially drown himself in it.
"You frigging murderer! First, it was my friends at Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Fred, and now, you killed an innocent little baby. My baby! And, you say no? How dare you! Say you deserve it, you prick! Frigging say it, you Death Eater scum!" Harry squeezed Draco's neck tighter, cutting off whatever minimal supply of air he'd been getting as he willed for the blond to admit that it was his mistake. Everything!
“And didn’t use a condom or a protection spell so that my sperm could impregnate you,” Harry said off-handedly.
Harry tried to tell his mind.
“As I said, it’s up to you,” Harry said, nursing his jaw which was throbbing with passing seconds.
“Yes,” Granger replied softly.
"Couldn't you have told me this before?" Draco queried angrily.
“Look, first of all, I don’t know how you guys broke into my office –“
P.S. I love Ginny so I'm incorporating her into my story in my own way :D
The final punch cracked Draco's sanity, not his bones.
"Mate, you need to talk to him about whatever that's happened. Even I can see that the ferret's not in the right state of mind and I'M supposed to be the thickheaded one of the lot," Ron chuckled humorlessly.
“I am concerned, as I should be and I expected I would be. Your list of self animosity apparently is longer than what you love about yourself,” she noted.
Rolling his eyes, Draco took the proffered mug from its place in the air and occupied the chair across Ginny, leaving the table as a divide between them. They glared at each other – it was more from Draco’s end as Ginny’s gaze simply seemed to be perusing his defensive stance and for once, he was really glad to be wearing full-length sleeves that covered his physical misgivings which could never be erased even after he ceased to exist.
Do you remember?
“You sort of had a mild panic attack,” Harry answered carefully, taking the glass back from Draco and putting it aside. “You’re still shaking,” he said, rubbing Draco’s palms.
Harry had another episode in the morning for no reason and stormed out of the room after barely managing to stop himself from smiting Draco. A few blows were exchanged and Draco was awarded a sore stomach as a result of Harry's foot stomping down on it. Harry wasn't in any better condition either. Draco was sure that he gave Harry a sore jaw with his extremely strong sock on it. As he currently lay on the kitchen floor unable to get up yet, he trembled in fear of what was to become of them. This couldn't go on forever. He couldn't take Harry's surprise attacks on him anymore.
“Will you ever stop?” Harry had asked. Stop what, Draco couldn’t understand.
“Though I’ve made peace with where I was, I always waited for you,” Draco whispered to an empty hearth as the green flames died down.

your home to walk in and steal my coffee whenever you frigging desire!” Draco yelled. This really wasn't a great way to start his day.
"This is for my baby," Harry announced before landing his fist on Draco's half-broken nose, effectively finishing the task. "Say you deserve it again."
“You look like a Slytherin,” Ginny commented, with a hand on her hip as she stood by the Floo.
Believe me, I remember what you were to me.
“You’re pregnant, Draco. That’s all. Let’s go home and celebrate now,” Harry burst in controlled anger.
“Is there a reason you do not want to fly?” she asked.
“Is the drink green in color?” Draco asked, picking it up and bringing the bottle close to his frowning and curious eyes in an attempt to examine and find out which color the liquid inside was.
~ Wheezy
Draco furrowed his brows and nodded in acceptance. “Okay then.”
She didn't answer. Because she had no answer. The only respite both of us could get from this awkward situation was me shutting the door in her face.
“Some muggles prefer instant coffee,” said Harry.
I hope you remember my love for you.
Love,
“I lived under the Dark Lord’s thumb!”
Blow.
Situated away from the Wizarding world, close to the muggle country suburbs, Harry’s bungalow stood alone with a small yet spacious lawn that was not taken care of at all. There was a garage attached to the left corner of the bungalow with its shed down and Draco wondered if Harry drove a vehicle, magical or muggle. Harry opened the black gates for him.
"There is a reason why I refused and I think you know why," Draco said.
"Answer me and I'll cut the cake," Harry winked and Draco blushed harder as he was once again reminded of his heart racing for his husband.
Arya raised an inquisitive eyebrow. “Were you expecting a reply?”
“How dare you insult me, you scum!” the old witch’s voice rose an octave, making it shrilly and raspy.
He was sat in the Mind Healer’s office – sparsely furnished, save for a wide desk and a couple of chairs around it. The desk was littered with what he supposed were case files of her patients on one side and on the other side, a quill stand, a couple of ink bottles of distinct inks, a round gold clock that winked at him every minute, and some more files in an orderly way. There were bookshelves on the walls which hadn’t a door. Basically, there were too many books to his utter dislike.
Harry just smiled and fit his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, earning a needy gasp from the blonde, whose hands fisted Harry's shirt on his back as his body arched into Harry's face involuntarily.
This time, the tears he shed weren't because of physical agony but of extreme joy. He didn't know what he did to deserve Harry's kindness, nonetheless, he was happy to receive Harry's feelings and he'd accept them with all his heart. It was only Harry who knew about him, who watched him during his lowest and was now helping him get back on his feet. He would forgive and forget all the bruises they had given each other if this would become his every day. Draco felt needed for once, after many years, yet he wasn't entirely ready to admit what it was that he felt for Harry. Maybe, he liked the man too. Maybe not. He just wasn't sure.
"I can do it," Draco protested but made no move to get away from Harry. He quite liked the way Harry was taking care of him. The gentleness was too precious to run away from. Who knew how long it would last before Harry regained his harsh demeanor and started punching Draco everywhere visible and invisible to the eyes?
“You don’t have to tell me now if you don’t want to,” she said softly after a long while and Harry nodded.
"Have you been to my place?" Harry enquired.
The look on Ronald's face was priceless as it morphed from the utter shock that they slept together to an expression of slight disgust at their homeliness before settling down into stuttering shame. To Draco, however, Hermione's lack of expression as if she knew about them all along, hurt his childish ego and he gave the pair his best sneer.
“Really? That’s great, then. Besides, don’t tell me you haven’t thought about this, Draco. All those years of hatred was you begging me in your own way to do you; pound you into oblivion; make you mine. So, let me, Draco,” Harry said as he fingered Draco’s wedding ring with his thumb.
“Let’s go, Harry,” Ron insisted as he tried with all his strength to push Harry towards the exit or the Floo but Harry wouldn’t budge.
“How are you, Draco?” she asked.
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.

"Okay, good," she said as she relaxed into her husband's loving embrace.
First, Shacklebolt made Draco remove the band he already placed on his finger during his encounter with Potter in Azkaban and placed it together with Harry’s wedding band on a small velvet cloth. The ring Harry bought for himself was similar to Draco’s but the gold and platinum weave it sported was in the opposite direction to that on Draco’s ring. Their rings had three medium-sized platinum rings held together by gold wires that weaved through them vertically. On Draco’s ring the weave slanted towards the right while on Harry’s ring, it was to the left. Shacklebolt whispered some magical incantation on both the rings and they were enveloped in a pale white glow once the spell was done.
Love,
He paced back and forth in that tiny room before deciding to sit as his legs felt extremely weak. So did his entire body. The fact that he was extremely exhausted wouldn’t even be the bottom line of his pains. If only he could lie down and rest like there was no tomorrow!
"Get out of my sight, Malfoy," Harry ordered.
"Happy birthday, Harry!" those two voices were too loud for Draco to ignore but Harry slept like a log, his head resting on Draco's chest.
"You should leave now, Potter, if you want to make it on time," Draco remarked. Something seemed strangely off in a good way about the atmosphere between them and Draco could vaguely sense where it was going. A red hue dusted his pale cheeks upon remembering how his eyes seemed to trail Harry whenever he was around in a good mood; how he liked it when Harry called him darling and how badly he wished for those thin fragile lips to meet his own instead of wetly lingering on various spots on his face. He didn't care that he was fawning over the man who hurt him whenever he was angry; he only wanted Harry to meet him halfway and continue pursuing each other as intimately as possible. In the back of his mind, his Father's voice echoed that he would be a shame to their family if he surrendered himself to a man instead of copulating with a woman but Draco suppressed that part of his mind as he didn't care what his late parents said about his need and want for Harry, to be taken care of by him. Draco was mildly horrified yet at the same time excited that he wanted Harry to stay.
“I saved him,” Harry whispered incredulously.
After all this time, after all his dark years, Harry believed that Draco had changed. Even when his friends visited them on his birthday and Draco laughed along with them, Harry really trusted that there was some hope for him. He couldn't understand why Draco was back to being a stubborn pureblood prick again. It was so reminiscent of their school days but Harry only felt so damn angry, triggering the part of him he was trying to lock away and be a better person. Draco always knew how to crack open that lock and in the back of his mind, Harry knew that if Draco didn't listen to him, he would no doubt punch the blonde into oblivion. Harry wanted to stop himself so bad yet he couldn't as he looked down at the man he once hated as a boy in his life. All that animosity came rushing to the forefront and all he wanted was to mess up the infuriating blonde under him.
"Good. Yes, you be ready and I'll be ready too," Harry nodded, with his hands on his hips, an early Christmas blush decorating his cheeks.
“This isn’t sex. It is rape,” Draco couldn’t hide the quiver in his voice. "As of now, you don't have my consent!"
When Harry sidestepped Draco's gaze and didn't give him an answer even after his time was up, Draco simply nodded his head assuming correctly that Harry wanted the child and got up to leave. Hermione and Molly tried to stop him, tried to coerce an unmoving Harry to stop him but he paid them no heed as he Flooed back to his and Harry's home. Harry only watched warily as his husband's drooping posture was engulfed in green flames. As soon as Draco's stepped into their home, his entire body trembled with equal parts of anger and anguish and his throat itched for something liquid. Something that WASN’T spiked with an Artificial Pregnancy Potion. Something adult and strong that would make his pain bearable. Forgettable.  Almost running to the kitchen, he threw the drinks cabinet open and picked up a bottle of alcohol. Without even bothering to pour the drink into a glass, he drank directly from the bottle, emptying more than half of it in one go, and feeling the effects of it lightening his dark mood already. Picking up another bottle, and another just for safety, he locked himself in the guest bedroom and drank like there was no tomorrow.
"Don't test me, Draco," Harry warned breathlessly as he pulled back and collected himself enough to rival Draco's waning smirk.
“Yes, I do,” Harry answered, back to normal.
“I only need you, Draco, and I won’t let ANYONE, not even my friends, take me away from you. You’re mine and I am yours. I will leave, for now, and let you think about everything,” Harry waved his palm around.
But when Harry's other hand closed around his thigh, a gesture which asked Draco to stay, Draco did just that. He got under the blanket and moved closer to Harry after finally removing his thigh from Harry's punishing grip. As soon as he did that, Harry rolled towards him, his palms fisting Draco's nightshirt as if trying to hold on and save himself from falling off the cliff; his legs nudging themselves between Draco's rather forcefully, and his face resting relaxedly under Draco's chin - an action which caused Harry's long rough hairs to tickle Draco's nose.
“Ron?” Hermione questioned as they were almost close to the hearth.
“I’m planning to go shopping today,” Ginny placed her empty mug on the table.
“Yes, you did. You have so much good in you that you willingly saved the man that hurt you in every way possible.”
That night, Harry didn't open his eyes to the darkness. It defined something in both their lives as they found peace in welding together each other's misery. They realized that they needed each other to stay sane. And for the first time, they weren't afraid of their own selves.
Draco’s eyes snapped open in sheer surprise. “Are you crazy? Get on with it!” he said, rolling his hips down but Harry only pulled away.
“No. You’re my first,” Harry replied and Draco sniggered. “Hey! It’s really hard to admit that I lost my virginity after twenty-six years,” Harry continued.
“Me too,” Draco pecked Harry on the lips before fixing himself a cup of Espresso.
“I did now, didn’t I?” Draco’s tone held sarcasm in copious amounts.
"You WILL stay down," Harry intoned once and for all. Draco shut his eyes and nodded his head a fraction to let Harry know that he would comply. He would lay down and take all of Harry's wrath until he was satisfied or until he killed Draco. Death now seemed so tranquil to Draco.
"Close your mouth, Potter," Draco chided.
I hope you don't remember any of these memories that weigh my life down.
“What do you feel, Mr. Potter?” her voice was supposed to be extremely soothing according to Ron and ‘Mione but Harry wanted nothing more than to un-hear whatever she was saying and would be saying.
“Damn right I would not! Who in their sane mind would ask for that?” Draco barked.
“Accio Flu medicine!” he incanted as he plopped down on the sofa weakly.
“I’m not Harry! Besides, he isn’t even here,” Draco maintained.
“I won’t be beating around the bush but I think you need to stay away from Harry,” Ron said and when Draco was about to protest him indignantly, Ron raised a hand, gesturing him to stop talking and hear him out first. Draco snapped his mouth shut so as to not spill all the profanities he cooked up for Ronald in a mere span of seconds. “We failed as his friends miserably. When he needed us after the war, we weren’t there for him as we were trying to fix ourselves. We left him alone. The Harry you see right now is not the Harry I once used to know. I will be thoroughly ashamed later for saying this to you but this Harry is dangerous. He’s okay when he’s in a good mood but I can’t say the same for when he’s, you know, out of sorts. And if you stay together, I’m afraid the outcomes in my mind are too bloody. I can see that you’re trying to hold on,” Ron said eyeing the two rings on Draco’s finger and instinctively, Draco hid his left hand from Ron’s sight, “but for how long?”
Please do leave Kudos! Or a comment, if you wish.
"It wasn't bad," Draco stated and Harry guffawed until his stomach hurt.
'No, I don't deserve this.'
“Since this is our first session, let’s talk about something that you like about yourself,” she started.
“Whatever you say, darling,” Harry spoke around the popcorn in his mouth and Draco sneered at Potter’s lack of etiquette.
“Ha, I knew it!” Draco screamed and a few popcorns rolled onto the floor.
“I like to enjoy the fruits of my labor, darling,” Harry called out as he watched Draco’s form disappear out of the kitchen.
“Get out, Harry,” he whispered silently, still rubbing the Mark though the spit was long gone.
Malfoy was thrown into silence. Tears threatened to fall from his eyes yet somehow he held them back. Harry Potter was humiliating him in every way possible and he could do nothing about it. It wasn't enough that his freedom was in Potter's hands; it wasn't enough that he was slaving himself instead of dying; it wasn't enough that he now had to live with a man he hated the most. The loss of his estates or their money didn’t bother him more than the fact that he now had to give up the only thing his parents left for him, the only thing he prided himself about for years. He had to give up being a Malfoy and become a Potter in order to live.
I didn't leave you because I didn't love you. You must know this but you probably never will. I left you because I loved someone else more. Maybe it is as good as saying that I don't love you but then it would not be the truth. I must never say lies. So, I have loved you. I love you. But I love Ginny more. I love that she is with me in a place where I want to be; where you are unwelcome. I love that I don't need to hide myself or her or my kids from anyone. I love that I can display to the world the love and affection I have for her, which I can never do when I'm with you. Does this make me a selfish, conniving prick? Then so be it. I had a choice and I made the right one. Whether or not it was the correct one... Well, time tells. Twelve years is huge chunk of it to say that my decision was right as well as correct. Yet as I sit alone in my office reviewing policies, assigning cases, training the young and worthy, I kind of miss you. You were a knowledgeable wizard. Your brain worked wonders even during Hogwarts. I'd imagine how beneficial it would be if you were here. Just like Hermione, you might have brilliant and tactical ideas. You could work together and our world would brighten more. I could see you everyday, your smile and your eyes, your pomp and your gait; I could listen to you blabber about work, your ideas coming into being and resonating loudly for all the witches and wizards to hear. I would lift you to your success. Or I could get you a job in my department. You were always good with spellwork. If not an Auror, you could be anything you wanted to be. I'd take you to those parties you fancy and watch you roam around socializing with everyone, giving speeches in my stead. And in the dark nights, we would strip each other off steadily like gentle breeze over the clouds. Every inch of my skin would be yours. And yours mine. On days when I want to lose complete control, I'd let you guide me down onto the bed... On my back, like you loved, or on my hands and knees, or against the frigging wall or over the couch, if you preferred it rough. God, our love making would be so explosive. You turned into a beast whenever I'd relinquish control. You made a mess out of me and I would never stop begging you for more. More of your tongue, your mouth, your teeth biting my lips and nipples and whichever place you'd love to bite and mark as yours. I'd surrender for you anytime. You could keep me naked and vulnerable and I'd do the same to you. We could forever live tangled under the sheets, making love to each other. Taking turns. Then I hear a loud cracking sound from a misfired spell. Like a wave crashing down, I come back to the present and realize that my daydreams are worth nothing. I wouldn't do a frigging thing. I love my life the way it is now. Without you. I'm happy with my family. I'm content. I don't need to rely on you anymore. Or so I think.
“Mister Cooper? Will you punch in our orders?” Ginny asked, pulling the boy out of his trance.

"Happy now, are you?" Harry asked mockingly as he stopped beside Draco, who was visibly startled when his husband marched into his room angrily.
“Ron, please. Please,” Harry finally resorted to begging and the urgency in his tone cracked open the harsh indifferent hatred Draco built around himself rather poorly. He’d been meaning to talk to Harry anyway. Seeing that he might have to postpone his visit to the Weasley Residence as Granger and Rose were currently residing at The Burrow, this would be his chance to talk to Harry.
“So, Harry, you are an Auror, yes?”
The one that looked at him through the mirror was altogether a different person. Azkaban peeled layers off him yet he surmised that he looked even worse now. It wasn't that he had gotten any thinner than before but his face - he couldn't recognize it. Its pale and bony features were haunted, and his nose visibly broken though it was mending gradually. Draco put a bud between his lips and using the tip of his wand, he lighted it up into a nice cherry. Ever since he took up smoking, he always wondered how he'd look while doing the act. So, here he was, a week after he was rescued from the death grip of his husband, standing inside the bathroom and lighting up a fresh cig.
Healer of Mind, primary
He didn’t know how much time had passed since the bathroom but Draco felt relatively better as he opened his eyes. Looking around the room, he surmised that they were still at the Weasleys but judging from the darkness, he concluded that it was nightfall. He slept for more than four hours! Sitting up gingerly, the pain in his stomach felt like an illusion of the past for it seemed to be perfectly all right now. Pain no more, his attention found voices outside his door.
“You look like shit,” she pointed out.
Draco Malfoy flashed in the back of Harry’s mind; all bloody and on the verge of unconsciousness. He distinctly heard Draco screaming
Thank you Lie17, Ea, and Personwhoneedsalife for your wonderful comments!
“Draco, let me,” he had asked breathlessly and his husband obliged by lying down on his back on the bed.
Choose well.
"I'm his husband," Draco murmured.
"I want to buy Christmas presents for everyone," by 'everyone', Draco meant Harry, his friends, and his surrogate family. It was Harry's turn to gape in shock at Draco. The sweater, the gifts would be a silent plea from Draco to the Weasleys, asking them to forgive him for their losses even if they were not inclined to accept him as Harry's husband. It wasn't like he needed them to play a part in his life but a bit of forgiveness never hurt anyone and it would help Draco in believing that he was worth living after all.
Draco observed this little change in Harry. It started on Harry's birthday and since then Harry seemed to frequently address him as darling these days and to Draco’s horror, he liked it. His heart fluttered whenever Harry said that word and he wondered what it all meant. Harry Potter was a choice he made and being married to the man and living with him was bound to develop some feelings, right? Was it the same for Harry too? Because the way Harry looked at him changed as far as Draco could tell. Then again, there was a chance Draco could be wrong as his own unexplainable feelings for the man might be deceiving or tinting the looks he received from Harry.
“Okay. I’ll try,” Harry agreed and stood up to leave once his Healer gave him the okay.
“You were eavesdropping,” Harry accused.
“What do you think I am, Harry?!” Draco yelled uncharacteristically. “Do you think I am NOT broken? Did you frigging take a look at me before stating like a prudish prick that YOU are broken? How self-absorbed can you be?” he spat, with his arms stretched wide to his sides, well, as much as possible in their medium-sized bathroom.
“Why are you here, Harry?” Draco asked when the silence separating them, more like joining them together into one, became too heavy to hold.
“Ron? What the heck are you doing here?” Harry asked and Ron sheepishly walked into their room, glancing between a fuming Harry and a sneering Draco.
, it wasn’t just enough. He wanted more of it, like an unforgiving drug. The Flu medicine which he took before freshening up had made him numb. It was the only reason he’d accept for even coming down to St Mungo’s. What in Merlin’s name was he thinking? Agreeing to Ronald Weasley’s invitation! He shouldn’t have! If the people around him knew that he had not Harry’s protection anymore, they’d jump at the knowledge and curse him to all the constellations and back. He pinched a burn scab on his Mark harder and hissed in pain, which thankfully went unnoticed by Harry, who seemed to be lost in his thoughts. That’s good. As long as Harry didn’t acknowledge his presence, they’d be alright.
All the pieces of the puzzle suddenly fit together and Draco looked at Harry with eyes filled to the brim with betrayal.
“Yes, Mrs. Reynolds,” he smiled genuinely.
- implied self-harm, self-harm, cuts, sex, blood-play (is that what you call it?)
"So," Hemione cleared her throat before stealing a glance from her husband. "We think you should go and talk to Draco."
"You KNOW the Mark," he stressed, hoping that she would unsee his shame he tried to burn but failed every single time.
“We have our ways, Mr. Potter,” Rita interrupted, looking at Harry from above her horrid red glasses.
Harry didn’t answer and Draco didn’t push for one. Their bodies trembled as Harry clung to him harder and cried silently like there was no tomorrow.
“Harry needs help,” Ron said apologetically.
“Talk to me, Draco,” she coaxed.
If he'd chanced a glance at Potter, he would've seen Harry's eyes glued to Hermione's stomach rather darkly. Harry always wanted a child in his life. Now that he's married Draco, he didn't know if he could ever get one. He wasn't even sure if Draco would agree to raise a child with him and he supposed that he'd have to do it alone. Still, he thought, it would be nice to become a family with Draco and their child.
"You're bleeding," Harry pointed out breathily.

Draco didn’t say anything to Harry about the change because he couldn’t stay with his husband anymore. Not after the hospital incident. He remembered it took hours for him to finally reach their bedroom and he promptly fell asleep on the bed due to exhaustion. He remembered the pain and all the blood covering the sheets underneath him when he ingested the first dosage of the Uterus Removal Potions. He remembered how he pleaded with an absent Harry to lessen his pain by sharing his magic with him. He remembered lonely days and equally lonely nights. Then one night, Draco guessed through the haze of his pain, Harry walked into their room and Draco’s magical core immediately sought out Harry’s magic.
It wasn’t always bad with Harry. There were times when he was laughing and smiling till his stomach and cheeks hurt and he felt like he didn’t deserve them at all. Yet when his eyes found Harry looking at him with something akin to devotion and pride, he would tell himself that this was his chance at redemption which he wouldn’t ever let go of. The pride he so long carried had successfully only propelled him towards his downfall. Now that it had been mellowed quite well, Draco grasped at the branch Harry extended towards him. Only, he never imagined that it would be Harry who would let go of that branch.
“Harry? Harry!” Hermione called out to him impatiently as he began striding away towards his room soon as he flooed into the Weasley Residence, completely ignoring his pregnant friend who was anxiously waiting for Harry’s and Ron’s return. “Harry Potter, you come back here now!” she bellowed.
