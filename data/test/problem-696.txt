“How’d you feel about that?” Draco nudges—he can tell there is something there.
Even in this odd position, Draco can tell something is bothering Potter. While last week he was tense, this week he is a ball of pent up nerves laid out on Draco’s couch. He doesn’t ask. Doesn’t want to see the twitching muscles tighten and recoil. Whether it’s something Draco should know about or not, Potter will only tell him if he wants to. So Draco says nothing. He performs the spells, helps Potter down from the couch, and moves back to his desk.
After the movie, Harry and Draco decided to take a nap. Harry asked the room to give them beds but it only gave them one. They looked at each other blushing.
“He had a nightmare, that’s why I’m in his bed!” Draco said, the blush still on his face.
“I think that I’m going to get dinner here if you don’t mind,” Harry said, addressing his friends. He made sure that he didn’t let go of Draco though because he didn’t want him to leave.
“A person that would love you unconditionally?” Harry repeated. “What do you mean?”
Harry laughed at her rambling, “Thanks ‘Mione. Really!” He added when she gave him a confused look. “I was kind of worried that you wouldn’t be ok with me liking him.”
They arrived at a dead-end before Hagrid turned to face everyone. “Dis is like teh wall at teh Leaky C’ldron,” He said before tapping a pattern on the wall which Draco quickly memorized. “Yer names are on teh doors. Now go find yeh rooms.”
Harry blushed. “All we did was watch a movie and take a nap together in the Room of Requirements!” He said, trying to defend himself and Draco.
All of last night the only thing that ran through my mind was ‘How the hell did those two become friends?’ The last time that she saw them together they were fighting on opposite sides of the war and now they are acting like they have been friends for years. That just doesn’t happen unless- no! That’s not possible. I shake my head, trying to clear my head of those thoughts.
“I hope this year we have a normal professor,” Harry sighed.
Harry looked down at his arm. Not being able to come up with a reason to not let him he shrugged and stood up. Draco pulled out a medkit from his own trunk and told Harry to sit on his bed before walking over to him and crouching down in front of him. He grabbed out something to clean his arm before wrapping a bandage around it.
“Yeah...” Harry said slowly, not looking up at Ron. “He found out on the train.”
Harry shot up, tears still flowing freely from his eyes. He ignored Draco, not realizing he was there and ran to his trunk. Draco got up and followed him, trying to get him to calm down.
Draco was about to say something else but then the new professor came in.
“Yay!” Harry yelled, suddenly jumping up and wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck, causing him to stumble a bit.
“Please?” Draco begged, giving Harry puppy dog eyes.
The door to the compartment slid open, “C-can I sit here?” A quiet voice asked.
“P-Potter?” The person asked.
Not knowing what to say, Draco pulled the now crying boy into a hug. Harry held onto him like his life depended on it and cried harder than he ever had before. Draco sat there rocking them back and forward, rubbing small circles onto his back.
“Oh come on. I know you two like each other!” I whined.
“A bit after school ended I was forced to get the mark,” Draco said slowly. “I-I was scared that you would find out and hate me for it so I did everything I could to keep it from you. Voldemort gave me the task to find a way to get Death Eaters into the school and kill Dumbledor and I knew that if you were to find that out you would hate me more.”
When they did come down Harry was leaning on Draco whining. “Draco, do we have to go? Can’t I just sleep?”
“Afternoon,” Draco corrected. “We seemed to have slept through lunch. Hermione and Pansy are probably going to kill us later.”
They got on, not even thinking of looking for Ron and Hermione who Harry was sure were looking for him. The entire ride there neither made the move to let go of the others hand. Once they arrived at the castle Harry stopped them.
“Oh- I’m sorry Harry! I didn’t mean to get you upset! Oh!” Hermione stopped walking and pulled Harry into a hug.
“I don’t know. As long as I can remember I guess. But after 5th year I started having dreams about Voldemort,” Harry answered, looking at his lap.
“I-i don’t want to talk about it,” He stuttered, turning to look out the window.
Ask and you shall receive! Thank you all for the comments, they really encouraged me to write more (Even though I should be focusing on other things.... *cough cough* school...) Every time I get the email saying that I got a new comment I smile. It makes me so happy to know that people actually like my stories! Anyways, thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoy the chapter!!
Hermione ignored him and instead looked at Pansy. “Do you think that something happened between them over the summer? When I went to their room to go get them this morning they were in Harry’s bed cuddling. You just don’t do that with someone you were enemies with the day before!”
“I can’t let you do that,” Harry whispered. “I mean I’m already lost. There’s no way to help…” He trailed off.
Harry sighed, “I can’t wait to get out of here. I just want to go to the common room already.” He could feel everybody staring at him and Draco and it made him anxious.
“I-I’ll be okay…” Harry hiccuped. “I- it was-” he started, “Wait, why are you being so nice to me? I thought that you hated me?” He said, pulling away from Draco. He didn’t want to pull away from him though. Being in his arms made Harry feel safe. Safer then he’d felt in a long time, if ever.
“Don’t be too bored without us,” Ron winked at him.
“Oh! Sorry! I didn’t mean to go off topic!” Harry said, blushing slightly. “Um, could you give me some time to think about it?” He asked looking away. “I- I don’t really want to jump into anything if that’s fine with you.”
Harry nodded. “So when you saw me after your birthday you knew it was me? Why didn’t you tell me?” He asked quietly, finally looking at the other.
“N-no you’ve got-,” Harry stuttered.
“U-um, the only thing that I know is what ‘Mione said the other day. That there are some creatures that have soulmates that they love unconditionally.” Harry mumbled.
Harry set the razor down and undressed to get in the shower to clean off the blood and sweat. He stepped in and watched the blood drip from his arm for a minute before getting out of his trance and cleaning himself.
“It’s fine. You keep it, it looks good on you,” he said, winking.
“Oh, Harry! We love you too, so much! I promise that I’ll do my best to help you through whatever you are going through!” Hermione said, her tear coming back full force.
Harry whined a bit before resting his head on Draco’s shoulder and watching the movie.
Hermione smiled at him and nodded. “Of course, Harry. We’ll be there! Now let's go over to Draco before he decides to come over here and steal you away from us for the rest of the day again,” She said causing Harry to look over to the Slytherin table -- which he realized they were closer to than the Gryffindor -- and saw Draco staring at him with worry. Harry gave him a small smile before looking back at his best friends.
He was vaguely aware of the fact that he was led over to the bed or Madam Pomfrey fussing over him making sure he was physically okay.
I hope you are enjoying my story, I'm having a lot of fun writing it! Enjoy this next chapter! Bye Bye!!
“You’re obviously planning something! Pansy’s got that look she gets when she thinks she’s onto something!” He argued.
“Potter, wake up. It’s just a dream,” He said, shaking him a bit more. “Harry, come on, wake up!” He started to shake him a little more aggressively. Soon he got Harry to wake up. He pulled the now awake and crying boy into a hug.
Ron groaned. “Please tell me that you’re not going to try to find an explanation ‘Mione. I may not like the git but he seems good for Harry.”
“While you and Draco were skipping class together doing who knows what,” Pansy laughed.
“Shh, you’re okay now. It was just a dream,” He whispered, slightly rocking them back and forth. Harry clung to him as if Draco were the only thing keeping him alive. He cried harder then he had in a while. Draco kept rocking them and whispering calming things in Harry's ears until he finally calmed down a bit.
For at least an hour Harry laid there crying into Draco’s chest before he calmed down and fell asleep in Draco’s arms. Draco tried to get up and go to his own bed but anytime he tried to untangle their limbs Harry whimpered and pulled him closer. Giving up, he laid there for a little bit before placing a kiss on Harry’s head and drifting to sleep himself.
Harry listened to the five of them talk like they had been friends for years. It was nice to know that they could all put their pasts behind them and become friends. After a while Harry had fallen asleep, his head falling on the Dracos shoulder. Draco smiled at the sleeping boy before saying, “I think we should call it a night. I need to get this one to bed.” He nodded to the boy laying on him. They all bid him goodnight as he carried the small boy up to his room and tucked him into bed.
“Hello everyone! My name is Professor Lessy. Aimer Lessy,” He said. “I welcome you all back for your 7th - er 8th year for some of you, I guess. This year will be pretty much a review of years 1 through 6, so it will be an easy year. I have heard of the crazed professors that have had this job before me and I can assure you that I will harm no one nor am I not who I say I am. Headmistress McGonagall made sure that I took several tests and questions under Veritaserum,” He said.
“His treatment regarding the curse and researching for a cure, yes,” says Draco.
Draco nods again. “Good. Okay.”
Draco assists Potter back into his wheelchair and they relocate to the other side of the room.
“Yes and no,” he says with a shrug.
“Male, mid-30s, some kind of destruction curse to the back. Diagnostics show it’s nerve deep and spreading fast. Standard stasis charms aren’t touching it.”
Potter is grinning, and Draco can’t help but grin back.
be treated any differently. He can’t walk, okay, but why do I apparently have to be the one to remind people—Potter himself included—that he still has full use of his brain?”
Too many seconds pass. Seconds in which Draco is too stunned to muster a coherent response. His mouth opens—as do his eyes, too widely, he knows—but no words come out.
Potter’s blush grows darker.
It’s really no wonder Potter doesn’t want to talk to Draco.
“I get it, and I love her for it, but I don’t understand the concern. You’ll find something. You always do, right? You said you have a perfect track record with your previous cases.”
“What guy?”
“You’ll
Draco rolls his eyes.
“The idea of not just someone’s hands or lips, but of… of
“And look, okay,
“Yes and… no?” prods Draco.
Potter shakes his head, but he’s smiling.
“It just… doesn’t matter, does it?”
“No more curse means nothing to monitor and keep under control. You don’t need to be under my care at all. In fact, let me get your discharge papers.”
“It’s just so fucking

open mind. But you should still be able to experience sexual pleasure. Potentially even orgasm, given enough time, patience, and practise.”
Draco tries not to think about the fact that it’s Potter beneath his wand when he’s casting diagnostic charms and examination spells. It’s easier to forget that Potter’s the patient when Draco’s at his desk, poring over his books and journals and making notes. It’s impossible to forget when Weasley and Granger-Weasley visit.
Draco laughs. “Yes and no.”
sounds scandalised, and Draco might have been offended if he actually cared.
“Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself…” Potter mutters, dropping his head and rubbing his temples. “Really didn’t need to be thinking about Voldemort and my cock at the same time.”
Draco feels his face crease in confusion. He lifts his shoulders and holds his hands out, palms up, in silent question.
Finally, Draco steps forward.
Potter is late.
“Nope. No one wants to publish the stories of this sex-deprived hermit.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
, eventually. Just not as quickly as you’re used to.”
“Today,” Potter says, nodding his head several times. “Yep.”
“Oh, I bet he loved hearing that from you,” says Granger-Weasley with a laugh.
Draco takes a deep breath. He’s come out dozens of times over the years, and he’s happy with who he is. But that doesn’t make preparing to defend and validate himself to others any easier, especially against someone so obviously libidinous as Potter.
“But… that doesn’t help me, does it?” Potter grips the arms of his wheelchair. “It’s stupid, and
you about the knitting?”
“This is... not my area of expertise.” At Draco’s words, Potter’s face falls. “There are Healers whose area it
“She’s an apprentice curse-breaker these days—took her experience and her trauma and channelled it into her career, only needs one arm to wield her wand, after all. She writes to me on occasion, sends me interesting trinkets from her travels.
“Ron?” he says. “What happened this time?”
Draco doesn’t meet with them directly—he’s far too busy trying to find a way to heal their friend. But he’s eavesdropped on a couple of conversations they’ve had with the Mediwitches who care for Potter while he’s unconscious. They know Draco is Potter’s Healer, and they don’t kick up a fuss about it. Because they also know that Draco is an excellent Healer who knows the most about the dark arts of everyone outside of Azkaban.
“Was the sex you’ve had a waste of time?”
Potter grins, and Draco regrets his response already.

hard to pick someone up for casual sex.”
Potter’s eyes opened wide in alarm and he shook his head.
Potter nods and they lapse into silence again.
“Professionally, yes. I have a perfect track record with previous patients, I would hate for you to ruin that by failing to attend a simple appointment and letting the curse continue to play merry with your spinal cord unchecked.”
Draco shakes his head, his smirk turning soft. “Doesn’t matter. Shall we get on with the other thing?”
go out with me?”
“Ah, yeah. Sorry I’m late, I—” Potter hesitates. “Well, I had an excuse planned, but I was just embarrassed after last week.”
“How am I supposed to manage that?”
Potter closes his eyes and shakes his head before finally asking, “What was the spell that hit me?”
. I can’t even
After a few deep breaths, Potter seems to settle. His fists loosen and he leans up on his forearms.
“Yeah, ah,
you caught me off guard. At the very most, I should have already been aware that this would come up.”
Draco is also quiet as he sits at his desk writing up his notes. He carefully details his observations of the curse, how fast the Gemino aspect is reactivating in order to to spread the Tabes curse. He taps his fingers on the desktop a few times before flipping back and checking his notes from previous weeks’ observations.
Potter nods.
. Of course Potter’s in and out of St Mungo’s like most people are in and out of their own kitchen for snacks.
“No, no—not like that.” Potter shakes his head. “I mean, yeah, being paralysed is a pain in the arse—or rather, it
“Sure, sure,” says Potter with a wave over his shoulder as he disappears.
someone?”
“I’m sorry, Harry.”
“I’m pretty sure that won’t help,” interrupts Draco.
“You’re here about Potter.”
. The idea of exploring this with them, of discovering new pleasure with them. Yeah… it’s… definitely working.”
“Is that even possible? It doesn’t feel like it.”
“That’s reassuring. With Granger-Weasley on your back about it, I can stop worrying about you not showing up.”
He’s so lost in his thoughts about the first sip of beer he
“Sorry, what?” Draco is totally thrown by the unexpected topic.
, surely.
“I can’t—” Potter’s head falls forward, burying his face in his hands.
Of course Potter wants to talk about it, why else would he have brought it up? Draco puts on his listening face and hopes it’ll be enough, because unfortunately he has no real insight for Potter.
“Can’t we just skip? I don’t want to go to class,” He said, laying his head on Draco’s chest. “I’m tired and I don’t feel good.”
“Well? Do you want it or not? I’m not cold so you can use it,” He said, shaking the sweatshirt a bit as if to get Harry to decide faster.
“It is odd,” Hermione said. “How can two people go from acting like they hate each other to acting like the other is the most important person in the world the next time they see each other? It just doesn’t work like that.”
“Mhmm,” He hummed. “We should be getting ready now. Hermione? If you don’t mind…” He said trailing off.
“That’s because they were arguing about something they didn’t want people to know about!” Pansy defended.
When he saw him pull out a razor that was covered in dry blood he started freaking out. “Harry no!” He yelled, trying to grab the razor from him. “Calm down! Come on, give me that. Don’t do it!”
Harry groaned, “Draco!” He whined, holding out the ‘O’ like a child. He danced around on his feet as well, as if that would help him. “Please? I don’t wanna go!”
“That’s fine! You have two months to learn! And I’ll help you!” The blonde smiled before turning his attention back to the movie.
“Malfoy already knows?” Ron said, surprised.
“Ginerva Weasley, stop that this instant!” McGonagall yelled. “My office, now.”
Draco quickly sat up in his bed when he heard someone scream. Looking around he saw Harry thrashing around in his bed, his face soaked with tears. Quickly, he got out of his bed and ran to the sobbing boy.
“Huh? How?” Harry asked, tiredly. He laid his head down on Draco’s shoulder closing his eyes again.
“What? I’m not,” she spat. “Harry loves me, why would I make him uncomfortable? I think you’re the one that’s making him uncomfortable being at our table filthy Death Eater.”
“Then why not in 6th year?”
“Hey mate, what took you guys so long?” Ron said when they arrived.
“Hmm,” The blonde hummed, looking between him and his friends who were smirking at Harry. “What happened when you guys were coming in?”
“Harry,” Draco said before doubling over with laughter.
For the past two days, he had been with the boy constantly and now that he wasn’t by his side he felt weird like something big was missing. He was beginning to believe the half-hearted confession that he blurted out so that his two friends would get off his back. Maybe he really did fancy Draco.
He didn’t eat much of the apple before he sighed, it was about time to get to Kings Cross Station. Yes, it took him two hours to eat some of an apple. He threw the leftover apple in the garbage, grabbed his stuff, and flooed to the station.
Draco huffed, “You’re acting like a child,” He said, messing up Harry’s already messy hair. “But fine. Let’s go to our first class and after, if you still don’t want to be there we can go to the Room of Requirements and stay there for a bit. How does that sound?” He said, giving in.
He was 20 minutes early because Hermione said if he wasn’t she would drag him out of his house. As he walked towards the train he spotted a group of red hair. When he walked over Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, and Ron all ran up to him and engulfed him in a bear hug.
Everyone went off to find their dooms, girls in the left tower, boys in the right. Draco walked up the stairs followed by Harry. The first room they passed belonged to Ron and Blase, the second Neville and Theo, and the third Harry and Draco. There were at least two more floors above them for some of the other students. The two boys walked into their room and started unpacking.
“Alright then. You set it up, I still don’t know how to work that thing well,” Draco said walking back to the couch while Harry went to set it up.
“Can you tell them?” Harry asked timidly.
“Hey, Harry?” Draco asked after a while, causing Harry to look up from his trunk on the floor. “Can I bandage your arm? So that it doesn’t get infected.”
Ron and Harry huffed out a laugh. “Yeah, they might,” Harry said. “I’m sorry for making you cry,” He said softly.
Draco smiled, “Sure. Y’know you’re adorable,” he said, ruffling up Harry’s hair causing him to blush more and giggle.
They walked a little bit before Draco spoke up again. “So do you still not feel good or do you just not want to go to class?”
“No, you need breakfast. I’m not letting you skip it. You didn’t eat much of the dinner last night,” Draco replied, dragging Harry down the stairs.
Quietly, Harry snuck up to his shared room and locked himself in the bathroom. He sat against the door with thoughts spiraling in a direction he didn’t want them to go. He’d gotten so absorbed by his self-destructive thoughts he never heard the frantic worries of the blonde that had apparently seen him hurriedly sneak away. He never noticed the door behind him give way as Draco forced it open or the loving arms that wrapped around him in an attempt to calm him down. He didn’t realize that the second there had been arms around him he’d started crying or that his face was now buried in Draco’s shoulder or the fact that there was a crowd of people standing in the entrance of their room watching the scene unfold with worry.
“Hey, are you going to eat anything?” Draco asked, looking at Harry with worry.
When Draco woke up he found Harry wrapped in his arms, sleeping soundly. He smiled at the boy in his arms, pulling him closer and resting his chin on Harry’s head. He hoped that when Harry finally woke up he wouldn’t freak out and get mad at him.
“Would you like to talk about it now or do you want to sleep a bit first?” He asked when their eyes met. Harry looked out the windows to see that the sun was beginning to rise. He knew that he wasn’t going to be able to fall asleep now. After years of not being able to sleep past sunrise, his body refused to even try anymore.
Harry couldn’t wait to get out of this class and out of their -- annoyingly obsessive -- watch. Instead of paying attention like one would think he was doing, he sat there wishing that the boring droning of the ghost would end and that he could once again be in the company of Draco Malfoy.
Draco sighed and started rubbing circles on Harry’s back again. “I could take you to Madam Pomfrey and see if you could stay there for a bit but that would be your only other option,” He said.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, sitting down on the love seat with Draco while they waited for Ron and Blaise to come down.
“Oh, um, I guess. Well, I - um, I don’t really know how to explain what I did,” Harry lied. “But I did find some more rooms that we never cleaned out. There’s a whole ‘nother library full of books that I’m sure you’d like, ‘Mone. I also found a room that looked like Sirius had hid a ton of Gryffindor things in. Like, there was a whole freaking lion running around on the wallpaper that was painted red and gold and the carpet was red and - and - there was just so much!” Harry laughed. “Though it looked like it was found. Maybe after he ran away -- I don’t know, but it was all torn up and burnt. I fixed it up though and I found pictures of the Marauders…” Harry trailed off, looking down at the ground as they walked.
“W-we’re not-,” Draco started.
On the way to the Great Hall, I think about Harry and Malfoy. There are two ways that they could become good friends like that after being at each other's throats for the past 8 years but I’m not sure which one of my theories is right. I’ll have to go to the library later to do some research.
Harry sat in his History of Magic class, unable to fall asleep like a majority of the Gryffindor’s that accompanied him. He sat in the middle of Hermione and Ron with Ginny, Neville, and Luna at the table in front of them.
“‘M-mione, we really only just became close yesterday,” Harry muttered.
When I don’t get another response I try the door only to find it locked so I did Alohomora to open it up. I walked in and looked around to see Draco’s bed already empty. (I couldn’t see Harry’s bed from the door. Draco’s bed and Harry’s closed curtains stopped me from being able to see) “Harry?” I ask, walking into the room. I heard someone mumble and groan in Harry's bed so I walked over and opened the curtain. “Harry it’s brea-” I cut my sentence off when I see Harry and Draco cuddling. “Eeeeh,” I squeal, causing both of them to jump up in surprise.
When Harry calmed down Draco pulled back to look at him. He whipped the tears from his eyes and smiled at him. “Harry, you can be your own person now. You don’t have to listen to what other people say or be who they want you to be. Be yourself. Be happy. I want you to come to me whenever you feel sad or like you’re going to hurt yourself. I’ll help you. I’ll always be here for you,” He whispered.
“Are you sure ‘Mione? I’m fine with waiting for you,” Ron asked, ignoring his growling stomach.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and laughed. “Alright, silly. Let’s go find Pansy and Hermione.”
! I’d do anything for you, and you know that!” Ron said, hugging Harry back.
“I am not a whale's penis thank you very much!” Harry said, pretending to be offended.
The four of them made small-talk for a bit before Blase and Pansy came over and sat near Draco. “There you are! Finally found you!” Pansy said.
“Anyways,” Hermione said. “I’m going to go to the library after dinner and then tomorrow, when we go to breakfast, let’s talk to them. You’ll get Draco and I’ll get Harry.”
I climb up the stairs glancing at each nameplate before reaching Harry and Draco’s room.
As Draco was lost in his thoughts Harry started to wake up. He felt himself surrounded in warmth and tried to snuggle close to it until he realized that the warmth was moving. Opening his eyes, he saw that his face was tucked into someone's chest. Pulling back, he saw that he was snuggled up to Draco. His face heated up in a blush when Draco looked down at him.
“What’s got your panties in a twist?” Pansy asked, a small smirk on her face.
Harry laughed a bit, rubbing the back of his neck. “I wanted to remodel Siri’s house a bit so I was a bit caught up and forgot to write you guys back, sorry.” Draco didn’t believe a word Harry said but he didn’t comment on it.
“Harry? What’s wrong? Are you ok?” Hermione asked him, for once, worrying about something other than the lesson.
“Hey ‘Mione,” Harry interrupted. He agreed with Draco, Hermione looks like she’s planning something as well. “What book are you reading?” He asked. When Hermione’s planning something you could usually get an idea about what it is from the book she has.
Too soon had Hogwarts start to appear in the distance. Reluctantly, Draco shook Harry’s shoulder in an attempt to wake him. “Come on now, we are almost there, time to wake up Harry,” He whispered.
“Yeah, mate! You haven’t done anything that you should have to apologize for,” Ron said, giving him a reassuring pat on the back.
It was the same dream every night and every time he’d wake up crying. This morning when he woke up, however, the dream had affected him more than it had other nights. He sat up in Sirius’ bed drenched in sweat and hyperventilating.
Back in 6th year, Draco had gone through an inheritance. The Malfoy line had Veela blood that went back for many generations, each child becoming one on their 16th birthday. He learned early in his life that he would soon become one himself and all the things that came along with it. His father told him that he would have a mate, someone that he would spend the rest of his life with if they were to accept him. If they didn’t, he would spend the rest of his life in depression.
“Nothing. Ignore her,” Draco said quickly.
Draco chuckled and pulled Harry back down onto the bench. “It’s okay. I don’t mind being your pillow if it means that you can actually get some decent sleep,” He smiled. Thinking about it after he fell asleep on Draco he didn’t have a single dream like he had taken some Dreamless Sleep.
In the Great Hall Hermione, Ron, Pansy, and Blaise sat at the Gryffindor table talking about what they had seen in the dorm room ignoring the odd glances sent to the group.
Soon, sleep overtook them.
Harry smiled and pulled Draco back into a hug. “Thank you. Thank you so much for everything,” Harry said.
Suddenly Draco grabbed Harry’s arm. “W-What are you doing?” He said, trying to pull his arm back.
“Come on, I bet Pansy and Hermione have our timetables,” Draco said standing up, pulling Harry up with him.
“You two are absolutely adorable!” I respond, smiling.
Harry dropped the razor and clung to Draco’s shirt, burying his face into his shoulder.
Harry groaned, fixing his glasses that had started to fall off his face. He looked around trying to figure out where he was jumping up and pushing himself as far as he could against the wall when he saw where he was lying. “I- I’m sorry, I-I,” He stuttered, his face as red as Ron’s hair.
“We overslept. Good thing Hermione came to get us or we would have missed classes too,” Harry said, sitting down in his normal spot, pulling Draco down next to him.
“How long have you been having nightmares?” Draco asked after Hermione left.
“What does that mean?” Draco asked, looking back to Harry. “Why didn’t you eat a lot when you lived with the muggles?”
As per normal Ron filled his plate and dug in and Hermione was lecturing him about his bad eating habits. The Slytherins also got their food and started eating. Harry, however, just stared at the food in disgust.
“What happened last time?” Ron asked, shoveling more food in his mouth.
Harry looked back and forth between Ron and Hermione, tears forming in his eyes. He really didn’t deserve friends like them he thought. He pulled them both back into a hug as he started crying.
In the library, Hermione looked for some books that might be related to Harry and Draco. In the end, she had 12 books. Sitting down she sorted through them before picking one out to start with. ‘This is going to be a long night,’ she thought to herself.
They went down to the common room so that when the boys came down, they were ready.
“Harry, mate, I don’t really like the fact that it’s Malfoy of all people, but I can see the way that he looks at you is full of care -- it's the same way I look at ‘Mione! I can tell that he won’t hurt you so I’ll support you, but the second he hurts you I will hex his balls off!” Ron said.
“You’re so mean!” Harry whined.
“No, I had a big breakfast so I’m good,” he said with a reassuring smile.
I look at Harry concerned. “You still are getting nightmares? I thought you said they stopped after You-Know-Who died.”
“Potions? When did you have that class?” Harry asked.
“Oh honey, how have you been? It’s been too long,” Mrs. Weasley asked.
Using one hand to lightly hold the others wrist Draco reached up and held Harry’s face, forcing him to look at Draco. “Shh, calm down. Everythings ok. I’m right here, I will protect you,” He whispered.
“Harry James Potter! Where have you been? I was worried sick! You just ran out of class and disappeared for the rest of the day!” She said, hitting him in the back of the head with the 53 chapter book that she’d been reading. “You’re lucky that I love you enough to get your note. Next time though, I won’t be so kind.” She handed Harry a stack of well-written notes and turned around with a huff, to continue reading.
“Sure, tink dats fer teh bes’,” he said before standing up and addressing the entire Great Hall. “Good evenin’ ev'ryone. Can teh 8th yer’s follow me to yer commn room.”
Harry chuckled a bit. “I’ll try not to,” He said and walked off.
“All except Remus,” He said, looking down at the table.
In the Great Hall stood Fred, Remus, Tonks, Madeye, Cedric, Sirius, and his Mum and Dad. They stood there yelling at Harry, telling him that it was his fault they died. Harry fell to his knees crying and apologizing profusely even though he knew they would never accept them.
“Hey Harry,” She started, while changing his direction from the Gryffindor table to the Slytherin without him noticing. “What did you do to Padfoot’s home during the summer? You said you remodel it?” She asked.
Ginny had come up to him before class had started and tried to sit next to Harry before Ron -- not so subtly -- pushed her out of the way and started a conversation with him about Quidditch.
“I guess,” Harry said slowly, moving closer to Draco.
Harry shook his head. “Of course not! I just got a bad impression of you when we first met -- you kind of reminded me of my cousin to be honest. You made fun of the first friend that I made and then you started fighting with me after I told you I didn’t want to be your friend. I didn’t know what to do so I just fought back, I guess. I’ve never hated you though! And if you came to me and told me what happened and that you didn’t want it I would have tried to help you. I’m not sure what I would have done but I’d have tried something!”
“Woah, okay, calm down, you’re keener than Hermione.” Potter holds up his hands to ward Draco off. “Yes, I spoke to Ron and Hermione. They are both very pleased that I’m going to go ahead with getting the curse removed. Their…” He pauses. Swallows thickly. Carries on again. “Their caring and positivity is really helping. Reminding me that this is a
The only thing that keeps Draco’s patience in check is the knowledge that if he were in Potter’s position he wouldn’t be handling it nearly as well. That and the one night Draco thinks he has a minor breakthrough and rushes to St Mungo’s at three o’clock in the morning to perform a certain examination spell on Potter’s lower back, only to hear quiet sobbing coming from his room. Draco leaves the spell till morning and refuses to think about what he hears.
“The erectile dysfunction.” No beating around the bush, as it were. Draco’s voice doesn’t even waiver.
“You’re telling me,” Potter says with a seething whisper. “That I’ve got a dick that I want to use but can’t, and you’ve got a dick you can use but don’t want to?”
“I’m done,” says Draco as he steps away.
“Do you want to… talk about it?” Draco is a little out of his depth here, and the idea of talking about this sort of thing with Potter, of all people, is rather awkward.
“Huh.”
“I understand.” Draco waits for Potter to drop his head and look at him. “Thank you for apologising.”
other thing has apparently become
“Oh.” Potter’s brow wrinkled, as though he hadn’t even considered the possibility.
“Are you telling me there’s some other treatment going on?” pushes Granger-Weasley.
“I’m sorry.” Potter drops his head into his hands. “I didn’t mean to—”
Potter’s eyes, suddenly clear and alert, find Draco. Every member of the golden trio has him pinned and even Draco will admit it’s a little intimidating.
“I’ve been doing some research, and I think there’s hope. Possibly not the hope you want, but you need to broaden your horizons, both mentally and physically, and with some patience—”
you to tell me— It could be even worse than—”
“She came to see me because she hasn’t found anything either. And obviously, she’s worried about you.”
Draco is barely even on his feet by the time the door slams shut behind Potter and he’s left standing in the silence of his office, wondering if that could have gone any worse.
“Sure, of course.” Draco brushes it off, but he feels awful for not being able to help. “Just… think about it, okay?”
“Okay… Well, you asked last week, with your physical sexual function paralysed, how you could have, and I quote—” Draco glances down to check his notes. “—‘The bluest balls you’ve ever had in your life’.”
“Even if you had found someone to take home—”
“I’m asking you out, you prat.” Potter accompanies his words with a roll of his eyes.
As Potter sits, a ball of fraught energy across the desk from Draco, Draco himself starts to get a little antsy. He sits on his hands, forcing a calm openness to his face. He waits.
“He’s fine,” she finally answers. “Frustrated, obviously. He’s still not used to being so limited in his mobility and capability, but he’s enjoying some new hobbies. He’s drawing and writing and knitting. Oh gosh, don’t tell him I told you about the knitting!” Granger-Weasley clamps a hand over her mouth.
things. They don’t know what songs you sing in the shower, what silly little things make you smile, what particular odd foible is going to annoy the hell out of them.”
By Friday, Draco is not prepared. He doesn’t believe he ever could be. He knows he has to explain it to Potter
“Are you all right, Potter?”
“Oh, it’s
“Fuck, shut up, forget I said anything.” And Potter is already turning around and moving quickly on his wheels towards the door.
, that I really started to suspect something was up.”
“No pain, pins and needles, or even a slight itch?”
—that he’s almost completely neglected to take into account Potter’s mental health.
“I meant—” Draco shakes his head. “—seek pleasure from those more simple acts of touch
“Maybe he should be frightened.”
” Potter pointedly cries as he leaves the room.
Potter looks Draco in the eye, desperation clear.
Draco stills for a moment, wonders how blunt to be. He’s quiet for too long.
As he’s helping Potter back into his wheelchair, Draco has to say something.
“Pinpointing the exact reason I’m still single, thanks for that, Potter. All that time I’ve spent dating and getting to know people. Totally wasted.”
“Weasley’s worried about that, is he?”
“Then what—?”
“Healer Malfoy,” Draco replies automatically.
She sits across from him in one of the guest chairs at his desk, one leg thrown over the other and a large folder on her lap. Granger-Weasley exudes efficiency, and the first words out of her mouth only confirm the notion.
“How is he doing? Really?”
“Not many people have,” Granger-Weasley tells him before also looking up at Draco expectantly.
. It’s
The wide smile on Potter’s face droops slightly, and while Draco understands his hesitancy, he knows Potter will be able to find someone. Not because he’s Harry Potter, but because he’s a funny, sarcastic, complex character, who’s going to make his someone stupidly happy.
The following Friday Draco is resigned to having little to no conversation with Potter as they just get on with what needs to be done. The whole thing is obviously hugely uncomfortable for Potter in a myriad of ways. He may as well not try to make it any worse.
Potter nods as he turns his chair and makes for the door. “Yeah, all right, I will.”
“Someone to take me home—I never take anyone back to mine.”
thing. Draco takes a moment to wonder at the fact that he’s somehow become Potter’s private sex educator, considering his own very limited experience, but he can’t exactly stop now.
“We can fix the curse?” Potter’s face is lit up with hope. He’s leaning so far forwards Draco is afraid he’s about to topple out of his wheelchair.
Harry glared at Ron before sighing, “Nothing. It doesn’t matter.”  Draco looked at him, confused but Harry just ignored him.
Harry looked down at his plate before sighing, “Fine.”
He never got the chance to tell Harry because of the war, but now that they were close, he might be able to tell Harry and have him accept him. He hoped with all his heart that Harry would accept him.
Hehe sorry not sorry
“Do you want to go ask Hagrid if we could leave now? You guys are fine with that, right?” He said, looking at the 8th years that sat at the table. They all nodded in agreement so Draco took Harry’s hand and walked up to Hagrid. “Hey, do you mind showing the 8th years to the common room now? Most of us- the ones sitting at the Gryffindor table that is - are ready to go.”
“I-I um,” Harry stuttered, trying to listen to them all talk at once. “I’m fine. And ‘mione, there’s no need for that. What’s new with you guys?”
“Found out? What do you mean?” Hermione said, worriedly.
Reminder: Please do NOT read this story if you get triggered easily! I want to make sure that every one stays safe and that my story is not a cause for someone wanting to hurt themselves.
Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat and said, “Uh, hey Gin. I’m fine how about you?”
“This year, since there is an extra year here we have decided to make another dorm room for them. After these announcements, I would like all 8th years to follow Hagrid to your common room. This year will be different from how it was like while Dumbledore was Headmaster. We will be having parties so that the houses can get along better. The first party will be in two weeks. Slytherin and Gryffindor will be together as well as Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Communicate with your houses to pick a day for the party. 8th years may attend if they want or they can have their own in their common room. On another note, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden and all students,” she said looking directly at the Golden Trio, “must be in their common rooms by 10. Now that I’ve said that, let’s eat,” as she said this food appeared on the table and people started eating.
Potter nods.
Potter lifts his head in apparent surprise. He also tenses. Draco can’t help but notice it, as he’s looking down at his back. So, not easier, then.
“Masturbation is getting better.”
Draco rather thinks the blanket will be to keep his legs warm, because Potter won’t be able to feel when they get too cold. It’s actually quite sensible. Not verbalising this thought to Potter is
sure…
Draco doesn’t know what to say, but he definitely doesn’t want to ask Potter to repeat himself. He settles for blinking several times.

At least, that’s what Draco tells himself.

“Regarding your
“I’d be worried if you said it
Granger-Weasley listens with her lips pursed. When Draco’s finished she nods slightly.
It’s Draco’s turn to smirk. “You’ve no idea just how unbelievable it is.”
“I wish my dick worked,” sighs Potter.
“Pretty much.” Draco shrugs. “I will clarify, I have
“Climax?” suggests Draco.
Draco bites his lip, but concedes a small nod.
“Okay?” Draco says quietly back.
Draco is just sitting down to lunch when he gets the call. He abandons his sandwich and jumps in the Floo to St Mungo’s. He’s met at the other end by an attendant and led through various corridors of the Spell Damage ward.
Potter’s face hardens and his eyes narrow at Draco. Draco doesn’t react. Potter can get angry and sulk as much as he wants—all he has to do is ask for help, or
doesn’t have time for, but will definitely have anyway, he doesn’t stop to think when he hears a knock at his office door.
Draco furrows his brows. “That’s fine—you’re not asexual.”
“So, they caught them, they’ll be punished, they’ll hopefully never be able to hurt anyone again. That’s good. That’s
Draco internally cringes at his word choice, but ploughs on, hoping Potter won’t notice.
As Draco had hoped, that gets a bark of laughter from Potter.
Potter goes without complaint. He lays quietly, doesn’t fidget or make small talk. Draco lets him be as he gets on with the spells. When he’s finished, Potter doesn’t sit up straight away. He’s resting his head sideways on his hands, facing the wall when he speaks.
“I can’t put it off any longer,” Potter says. “Even if you told me I had more time, I couldn’t take it. Hermione has been harassing me no end this week and asking why I didn’t get it done last week. And Ron’s worrying so much he’s not sleeping. He’s not
pissed off about getting sexual advice from someone who doesn’t care about having any.
“Right, well, while you consider your options for a tryst, shall we move over to the examination couch?”
Potter audibly swallows.
Eventually, Potter grips his armrests, takes a deep breath, and speaks.
“But,” interrupts Draco, “I
When Draco steps back he feels a bead of sweat fall from his temple down the side of his face. He glances up at the clock—it’s been 45 minutes, but it feels like hours. He’s drained. He needs to eat his lunch, drink three litres of water, and shower.
“Tabes…” repeats Potter, moving his arms and trying to pull himself up to a sitting position. “Never heard of it.”
Draco smiles tentatively. “Thank you.”
see them.” He holds a page up for Potter to see.
A further five days later Potter is released from St Mungo’s with confirmed total paralysis from L1/2 down, a shiny new wheelchair, and weekly appointments set up at Draco’s private office.
So, when Draco opens the door for Potter he simply says, “Good afternoon,” and motions him towards the examination couch.
, Potter would be alive and well if we removed the curse. And that is looking like the only way forward, currently. I’ve sourced every book I’m aware of—and a few I wasn’t—that even mention the Tabes curse, and there is nothing that even hints towards a counter-curse. I expanded my research into curses in the same family—Diruere, Festuca—but still, nothing. Two weeks ago I began going over it all again from the beginning. I’m gaining no new insights so far. I’ll keep going. Obviously, I’ll keep going. But while we wait, the curse…”
may not get a lot of things about me correct, but I… I do enjoy sex. With people. Not often the same person. So, I can’t argue with them there. But no-one’s getting hurt. Well. Not unless we…”
“Which will leave Harry permanently paralysed,” finishes Granger-Weasley.
“Going back to serious, though, I’m sorry too. You caught me off guard last week, but I’m your Healer, and at the very least I shouldn’t have let you
Draco nods. He can understand this must be difficult for Potter, but if it helps them find a solution, surely he knows it’s worth it.
“I’ve been keeping the situation quiet from the press and the public, so I wasn’t going to go to my usual spots to pick someone up. Had to be Muggle. But the thing about Muggles is I don’t have the ‘Harry Potter’ thing working in my favour. That’s usually the exact reason I go to Muggle clubs, but it turns out when I’m just some random vaguely-attractive guy in a wheelchair, it’s
Potter looks up at Draco before trailing off. Draco’s sympathetic look may have morphed into mild alarm, if the way Potter swallows and holds up his hands is any indication.
Draco can see Potter nodding awkwardly again.
“Is this you letting me know you need help?” Draco asks, as gently as he can manage.
“Yes.”
After seeing Granger-Weasley out, Draco collapses back into his desk chair and begins to prepare himself for Friday.
“Lay on your front. It’ll just take me 10 to 15 minutes to briefly monitor the curse as a whole, and then check the reactivation status and re-cancel the Gemino aspect of it.”
“My lack of a sex life?”
“Now, regarding your blue balls.”
“Have you talked to your friends?”
“I’m also a knitter.” Potter sighs. “It’s not just my job… it’s the what ifs. What if you find something. What if you figure it out. What if I go through with it and the next day you or Hermione suddenly have a bloody epiphany and it’s too late?”
“But it
“Would what?” asks Draco as he pulls himself back from his pondering.
“Potter?”
“Hermione’s been different this week, too. She’s only popped in to see me every other day and she seems more relaxed, not worrying over every little thing she says or does. It was when she said things could be worse because at least I still have the
The muscles in his shoulders twitch; he moves his head around, never resting it for more than a few seconds; his fingers rub and pinch at the material of the couch. It’s slowly driving Draco to distraction.
“There was a chap who got hit with a cursed Bludger during a friendly Quidditch match while on holiday in Brazil. Knocked out his fine motor function. Forget not being able to walk—he couldn’t even pick up a spoon to eat cereal. We managed to eradicate the curse from his body, but it left irreversible damage behind. He can feed himself and play football with his kid in the park, but he’ll never be able to play Quidditch again.
Potter slowly shrugs one shoulder. Draco has to pause and close his eyes for a moment, begging Merlin for patience. He’s rewarded when Potter actually speaks.
recommend taking your best and
“I know. And I’m feeling good, but also fucking petrified. Once it’s done there’s no going back. I’ll never be an Auror again—I’ll have to find a new career. But what the hell else am I supposed to do? I’m the bad guy catcher.”
Draco’s eyebrows rise without his permission. He can’t believe Potter is trying to play some kind of, ‘I’m Harry Potter’ card to assure himself everything will be fine.
“It’s fine,” interrupts Potter. “I know I’m—” He cuts himself off with a small frustrated huff. “Can we talk?” Potter gestures over to Draco’s desk.
The notes tell him nothing he didn’t already know. The Gemino is already growing resistant to the spells used to inhibit its actions. It is reactivating quicker, and will eventually be unable to be stopped, allowing it to start spreading the Tabes curse through Potter’s body. Time is running out for Draco to find a way to counter the entire curse, and the only alternative would leave Potter alive, but irrevocably paralysed.
“I can imagine. Though I did rather mean it to be the sort of thing one tries with a partner.”
“So it’s all theoretical.”
you understand yourself a little more. It’s… no one I’ve ever dated was a waste of my time.”
Draco closes his eyes and sighs.
Potter turns his wheelchair and leaves Draco’s office like he has done so many times before. This time, Draco follows him.
isn’t going to help my blue balls.”
There is silence for several seconds.
A slight squeeze of his fingers to Potter’s back, and Draco begins to cast.
The door opens, and Draco looks up to see Potter roll into the room. He does a double-take, and even stops to check his diary. Potter definitely doesn’t have an appointment.
“That’ll be because the curse is still there, isolated, but impacting on your spine.”
“So,” says Potter, “I have one last question.”
“Your research—You’ve tried this?” Potter
“I looked into it, and it’s unfortunately very much a part of complete paralysis at L1/2. In hindsight it’s clearly a result of the curse and the resulting pressure on your spine, and I apologise for not being aware enough to anticipate it. I’m a dark arts specialist, not a neurosurgeon, but that’s not an excuse.”
“Next week, Potter,” he affirms as Potter whizzes off towards the door.
“The only real change, I’m sure you’ll be glad about, is that you won’t have to have these weekly check ups any more.”
“I’m going to cast the usual spells—ensure everything is as we expect, cancel the Gemino so it can’t interfere—then instead of renewing the stasis spell, I’ll isolate and extract the entire curse. Doing so will leave the damage caused by the location of the curse touched with dark magic, and render it permanent. Do you understand, and are you happy for me to continue?”
Draco waits with his eyebrows raised expectantly.
you slept with?”
“Take me home,” interrupts Potter.
“Of course I am,” she says with an air of impatience.
Potter looks confused for a second before Draco tilts his head towards the examination couch.
“I said no, okay?” And with that, Potter turns his chair sharply and moves quickly over to the couch. He doesn’t wait for Draco to catch up before pulling himself up and laying face down.
Potter snickers.
“Not at all, please go on.”
“Sure. What about? Got some more sexual advice for me?” Potter punctuates his question with a wiggle of his eyebrows.
“Park yourself wherever you’d like.” Draco motions vaguely to the room at large. “Let me just…”
And Potter is gone.
Potter’s head is shaking before Draco is even finished.
It takes a few minutes, and Draco tries not to watch, but Potter gets himself up on the examination couch.
As expected, there is no change in the curse. The Gemino has reactivated but is not yet far enough along to have started multiplying and spreading the curse. Draco cancels it, then monitors it for a few minutes to confirm it’s dormant again for the time being.
if he doesn’t need it. Draco isn’t the bad guy here. For once.
Draco smiles, and he waits.
Draco can’t help the small frown that breaks through his mask of professionalism. “It is,” he murmurs.
“How long do I have?”
“Well, I dunno if it would be a

only end up feeling guilty about it.”
“I haven’t tried again since last time. What you said—about how the sex wouldn’t be what I’m usually looking for—it stuck with me. Because it won’t be what anyone else is looking for either. It was hard enough trying to score in a wheelchair, and that was before anyone knew I can’t even get it up. How am I supposed to find someone who wants to

“How? How do you find that—

“I know the people I sleep with,” protests Potter. “Always make sure to get their names beforehand.”
Potter laughs and his eyes light up. Draco wonders what songs he likes to sing in the shower.
“They’re your medical notes, Potter, I write everything down. Don’t worry, I’m the only person who’ll see them—only person who
“I won’t?” Potter asks, before frowning with realisation and saying again, “I won’t.”
“Come in!” he calls as he locks and wards his drawers.
“Okay,” Potter finally says. He looks Draco in the eye. “Okay, let’s do it.”
“But otherwise, you might be on to something. It was easier with the other items. I could almost imagine it was someone else. I’ve got a ways to go if it’s ever actually going to be enough to…” Potter gestures helplessly with an open palm.
The light-hearted jovial mood Potter’s abysmal sex life has created dries up as they go through the usual routine of the monitoring and stasis spells. The results are never going to get better, but Draco fears they are getting worse faster than he was anticipating.
stop talking about my balls.”
He knows this is hard for Potter. Has been for every one of his patients, sitting in this room, or a room at St Mungo’s, or lying in their bed, waiting for Draco to heal them in a way they had never anticipated. Potter is no different.
“But…
Draco waves his wand swiftly, lifting the spell that’s keeping Potter unconscious. It doesn’t take long for Potter to come around. He groans and blinks up at the ceiling, before turning to look at his friends. He doesn’t have his glasses on, but the ginger hair must be obvious.
“How are you doing, generally?” Draco keeps his voice carefully casual. He’s asked this before, but he’s hopeful at getting a better answer this time.
. Without them being the prelude to more. Fully embrace them as the whole experience.”
“We don’t have much time left, Harry,” says Draco carefully.
“Hey mate, how are ya?” Ron asked after he let go of Harry.
“You’re going to have to tell them now,” Draco whispered. Harry knew he was right. Hermione wouldn’t leave him alone until he told her the truth and she’d know if he lied.
They found the girls across from the doors of the Great Hall waiting for them. Harry let go of my hand and ran up to Hermione, interrupting their conversation.
“Hey, Harry. Draco. Good morning. How was your night?” Hermione asked from the couch she was sitting on.
“I’m tired!” Harry protested.
“Hemione already knew that we did the other night too, and I’m sure that she already told Pansy too,” Harry said, innocently confused.
Draco looked at Harry with wide eyes. “Really?”
“Back in fifth year Millicent and Daphne had an argument and Pansy thought it would be a good idea to ‘investigate’ and help them fix the problem. Let’s just say that it ended up with both of them trying to turn Pans into a bird. Snape got there before the spell hit her, thankfully,” Blaise replied.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, are you feeling better now?” Draco asked Harry, as he put some food on a plate for him. “Eat as much as you can, ok?” He whispered so that only Harry could hear him.
“Harry please,” Draco said quietly. “Give me this. You don’t need it. I can help you, just please put the razor down.”
“Harry, shut up!” Draco said, blushing as well. “You’ve just told two fangirls that we slept together!”
“He- Hey guys,” Harry said, pulling back and whipping his eyes. “I want to talk to you guys after dinner, later. About everything.”
“Thank you. Thank you for being here, I love you guys more than you could know,” He cried.
“Yeah! Harry, you are my best mate -- my
“I- uh,” He started. “Good morning?” Harry didn’t know what to think about how they were laying. It seemed to him that Draco was fine with it since he still hadn’t let go of him and for some reason, that made him happy.
“Hmm? Oh! It’s a book about creature inheritance. I got it from the library last night,” She said. He had no clue what she could be planning with that book. Harry felt Draco tense beside him and gave him an odd look as Hermione continued. “It’s really interesting. I kinda wish that I had gotten an inheritance, Having a mate that would love you unconditionally forever sounds so appealing, don’t you think Harry?”
“Oh! There you are, Harry! I was wondering where you two ran off to,” Hermione said, handing him his timetable and starting a small conversation with him as Draco talked to Pansy.
‘No,’ he thought. ‘Not a panic attack. Not today.’ He knew the only thing that could help him was cutting. The pain calmed him down. He had grown so used to pain growing up with the Dursley’s he didn’t know how to cope without it. After years of Vernon and Dudley punching and kicking him he’d grown to love the pain.
They’re silent for another few moments. Draco gives Potter the time. Eventually, Potter sighs.
Draco throws his notes in to the desk drawer, slamming it shut.
With Potter settled, Draco moves to the door.
He looks at the back of Potter’s head and wonders if this might be easier.
It’s all over in just a few minutes. All very anti-climatic, really. Draco drops his wand, leaving his hand pressed against the warmth of Potter’s back for a few more seconds before sliding it away.
That earns him a furrowed brow from Potter.
“Oh no you don’t. No first names. That’s never a good sign. I’m leaving.”
me that, but the bags under his eyes and his off-the-charts irritability sort of give it away.” The finger tapping on the arm rests increase in speed. “He’s worried I’ve left it too late. That you won’t be able to remove it all. That I’ve been too stubborn and it’s too late.”
They keep Potter in a magically induced state of unconsciousness while Draco does further investigations and research into the curse that hit him. The Tabes curse is brutal, consuming everything in its path, absorbing what it can and leaving behind nothing but decay. To Draco’s knowledge, no one has ever survived coming into contact with the curse.
At this, Weasley looks over at Draco, but it’s Granger-Weasley that gets there first.
Potter’s friends are there, obviously. Along with a Mediwitch, whom Draco strategically places himself slightly behind, in case of vitriol.
Potter’s head lifts from the couch.
“He’s generally coping pretty well, all things considered. Well enough to have stood up to Ron and Molly, telling them to stop bringing him food and fussing over him.” She screws up her face. “Wait, no, not
Today is fine.”
“I’m not telling you anything, is rather the point.” Draco clears his throat and tries to get them back on track. “
“Hi, Malfoy. How are you doing?”
“Yes, I’ll pay. The Copper Pumpkin isn’t far from here. They do amazing curly fries. As for when… well, the only commitment I had on Friday evenings got cancelled… so what about right now?”
“The other thing. That I told you about a couple of weeks ago. Before beating a swift retreat?”
“Doesn’t work,” he declares, parking himself in front of Draco’s desk. “I dimmed the lights, played some music—really set the mood—but it was just like tickling yourself.”
“You worry about me?” asks Potter with a small, droll smile.
Draco winces. Talking about sex with Potter has been enough to get used to without throwing Weasley into the mix. “Please don’t put that kind of image in my head.”
“Fine,” says Potter. “I’m doing fine.” He drops his head back to the couch and mumbles into his forearms. “All things, you know, considered.”
“The patient is
“That’s great, Potter, I hope it goes well for you. But why are you
“Not many.”
“How are you—”
“You said—”
“It’s not the same—it doesn’t really feel sexual or like I’m really masturbating. But it feels… nice. I feel
“Understandable,” says Draco with a nod. “I’m just glad you didn’t skip out completely. I would’ve been knocking on your door at home—these appointments are
Now facing the right way, Potter’s almost at the door and moving fast.
“Hermione
Potter nods and says, “A couple of blokes had broken into someone’s home.” He reaches out to the bedside for his glasses.
And then Draco isn’t smiling any more, either.
“He’s frightened too, of course,” she continues. “More frightened than he’d ever actually admit, but he is.”
late. He hopes Potter isn’t such a stubborn bastard that he won’t show up at all.
Draco simply hums and tries to look sympathetic. Luckily, Potter doesn’t seem to need Draco’s input.
“Getting down is… more difficult,” Potter admits. “Going legs first when…” A sigh. “When your legs don’t work.”
“Can the curse be safely contained indefinitely while we search for a fix?”
Potter’s response is a single four-letter word.
“But?”
” Draco
“You mean
history, and this Draco enjoys talking about considerably more.
“Healer Malfoy,” Draco corrects automatically. But Potter is already gone.
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have snapped at you, or—or said those words at all. It was unfair and untrue.”
Draco hums and nods in encouragement.
“That doesn’t sound better.”
“So do more of that. Explore other parts of your body, not as a precursor to intercourse, but to fully engage in and seek pleasure from alone.”
“I think we covered this last week, Potter. Dating. Remember?”
“I don’t feel sexual attraction.”
“No, no, nothing like that.” Potter holds up his hands to placate Draco’s concerns. “Nothing feels any different. Not in terms of my body, anyway.”
Between researching Potter’s curse, possible avenues of treatment, and potential cures; and researching erectile dysfunction, sex, and intimacy while paralysed, Draco has a pretty busy week. It’s a good job he currently has no other regular patients, else he may not have got any sleep.
“Have there been any other physical changes or symptoms? Even innocuous things you don’t think are linked could be relevant.” Draco ploughs on, even though Potter is already shaking his head. “Headaches, back pain, joint tenderness. It’s simpler if you tell me and we get it on record now than waiting for me to guess or until anything progresses further than we’d like.”
“Whatever it is, you can tell me, and we’ll figure out whether it’s related to the curse or not, okay?”
“Yep. Good to go.” Draco finally steps back to help Potter back into his wheelchair.
“Granger-Weasley mentioned you were writing. What about being an author?”
Potter gives a gentle nod. “Yeah. Yeah, I think I did.” He wheels himself out of Draco’s office and through the reception room. “See you next week,” Potter calls over his shoulder without stopping. “I’ll try to be on time!”
By the time Draco starts to utter some semblance of a sentence, “Well, that would—” Potter’s nervous energy is channelled into
Potter holds his arm out, wordlessly waiting for Draco to help him back into his wheelchair. Like it’s automatic. Second nature. Like it’s not an issue at all. Draco smiles, because it
“Stand back.” Draco draws his wand and steps forward.
Potter slips into Draco’s room, rolling himself right up to Draco’s desk. Still, Draco doesn’t look directly at him. In fact, he makes a point of turning a page in the book he isn’t really reading with an unnecessary flourish.
It is a fraught and awkward five days in which Draco and Potter are civil and polite to one another. Draco hates it. He answers and re-answers the same few questions Potter keeps asking.
“Well, Weasley needn’t worry. If it was too late I wouldn’t have let you leave last week. Another week or two,
” he growls.
Draco shrugs. “He doesn’t want to be treated any differently. And he
Draco looks over his desk at Potter. He notes the slight strain to his smile, the over-bright eyes, the attempts at humour. Potter already knows what’s coming. He knows, and he desperately doesn’t want to hear it.
“Er…” Draco feigned innocence. “I am not at liberty to reveal that.”
Draco takes a breath before speaking.
“It’s been, what, over two months since I was hit? Two months you’ve been researching the curse and searching for a way to fix it. And we’ve barely spoken about what you’ve found. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that’s because you haven’t found anything worth talking about.”
“I’m fine, but— You’re not my patient any more, Potter.”
“How does it work? The… procedure, or whatever… to remove the curse? Does it take long? Is it painful? I need to prepare myself.”
Draco gives a small nod. “Sure.” He points across the room. “I’ll need you on the couch. Let me know if you need help.”
Potter is still looking at Draco, but his eyes have a glazed look about them. His mind is clearly elsewhere. Draco can’t blame him.
Potter pushes himself back across the room and pauses in the doorway to look up at Draco.
Potter’s mouth is a flat, resigned line as he nods. “Yeah, I know.”
. But it doesn’t stop me thinking about it.” Potter rubs at his face before letting his hands fall to his lap and looking at Draco. “I do have a question, though.”
“Oh… fuck.” Not very professional, but that’s the very least of Draco’s worries right this second. “No, no… I’m sorry. I’m not—I’m not talking about the curse.”
“You’re a free man. How do you feel?”
By next week, Draco’s research has uncovered enough information that he has some questions for Potter. Potter, obviously, is not exactly forthcoming with answers.
Potter throws his head back, mouth clamped shut, cheeks reddening. Draco hadn’t realised he’d be
Okay, so they’re ignoring the other thing. The
conversation.
“Good afternoon,” says Draco as he watches Potter pull up at the desk.
Draco tries to imagine how Potter would feel about the paralysis being irreversible. It’s not ideal, but it’s better than the current alternative. Granger-Weasley said he’s coping, sticking up for himself against the people coddling him. He would be
“Yes, alone, right.” Potter clears his throat and looks away. “I’ll certainly give it a go. Shall we?” He points over to the examination couch.
“My point is, you can do whatever you want to. You’re not

to. I meant—
“Sorry,” says Potter. “Again. For the…” He waves vaguely towards the examination couch. “...rant.”
This time, when Draco finishes his notes, looks up, and sees Potter waiting, he doesn’t say anything.
“Yeah. So. Hermione paid you a visit?”
“There’s the rub,” says Draco, trying to ease them into the further issue. “The spell wasn’t simply a Tabes. It was modified and wrapped up with an enhanced Gemino spell. I cancelled the Gemino when Potter was first brought in, but it’s so tied up with the Tabes that it can’t be completely removed without also removing the entire curse—”
Draco shakes his head, but he’s smiling as he writes up his notes.
By next week, they are back to pretending there isn’t a threatening deadline hanging over their heads. And of course, all Potter actually wants to talk about is sex.
Draco wants to offer some sort of reassurance, but doesn’t know what to say. He gets no further than, “Potter—” before Potter’s head whips up and he looks Draco directly in the eye.
Potter sighs. “Okay, yeah, but I guess I mean, whether sex is involved or not, I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to connect with someone. To be with someone and know each other inside out. To have someone to share… everything with.”
friend to bed, wouldn’t you rather actually know the person?”
“Potter.”
“Potter,” says Draco, slightly out of breath from sprinting the short distance across his office. “Sorry to keep you, do come on in.”
. I can tell it would be better with someone else. If I didn’t know where I’d be touched next, or if it was someone’s actual hands or mouth…” Potter shivers.
“Sure,” says Potter easily. “I talk to them all the time. Yesterday, Luna and I were talking about the fact that, to your stomach, all potatoes are mashed potatoes.”
They make their way back over the Draco’s desk. Draco’s rummages in a drawer for a blank discharge sheet, barely registering Potter’s lost look. It can be overwhelming, coming to the end of treatment and being thrust back into the world without the support of medical professionals, but Potter still has his friends, and in fact—
Draco carefully does not ask for further details.
Weasley’s face tightens, but his voice is gentle as he breaks the news. “One of the adults was hit with an AK, but it’s not your fault, Harry.”
, and spells to evacuate your bowels are fucking
Draco drops his hands and looks up at Potter, brow furrowed.
“I know, I know. Really, I do. Hermione reminds me of that fact at least twice a week, somewhere between working, kids, and research.”
Draco opens his mouth, but he really isn’t sure what to say. Potter doesn’t even seem to notice.
“That’s what I’ve been saying.”
“Of course.”
to help Potter.
And, no offence, but it was a bit weird thinking about you while I was stroking a feather over my nipples.”
Several long, heavy minutes pass. Draco won’t rush him. Whatever Potter has to say is obviously difficult for him, but important enough he feels he needs to tell Draco. So whatever it is is worth the wait.
“You’ll find something!” Potter shouts over his shoulder as he speeds from the room.
“Thanks.”
, the… the other thing.”
“Why haven’t you removed the curse?” asks Granger-Weasley. She’s practically buzzing with repressed energy—it’s obvious she has a lot of questions to ask.
“Oh, yeah, that. Sure. Yeah.”
Draco shrugs. “It hasn’t worked out yet, but it will. I’m picky and not willing to settle.” He smiles at Potter, who gazes back uncertainly.
Potter is quiet for the rest of their session. He only speaks to thank Draco for his help and advice, and to bid him farewell until next week.
“I thought I’d give the whole dating-and-getting-to-know-someone a go,” explains Potter, as if that actually explains anything.
“Didn’t you just say you were single? Obviously it’s working out great for you.” Potter winces immediately. “Sorry, sorry. I’m obviously a massive dickhead today.”
“Erectile dysfunction!” cries Potter brightly, lifting his head and smiling at Draco.
“So,” repeats Potter.
“What have you got?” asks Draco as he enters exam room four.
Carefully, Draco smooths an open palm across Potter’s back, above the L1/2 impact site, where he knows Potter can feel it. He’s never touched Potter’s back like this before, and he doesn’t need to now, but he wants to offer Potter some comfort. To let Potter know that he is there, and that he’ll be okay.
“They’re of a theme.”
“Why the hell won’t my legs move?” he asks the room at large.
Potter grunts, but does as he’s told.
“And similarly, the other way around, the paralysis hasn’t extended? No pins and needles, numbness, or unexplained skin abnormalities around or above the waist?”
“All done,” Draco tells Potter. “Everything’s as expected. You can get down now.”
here. Just because it’s Potter doesn’t mean they can’t have this conversation.
While he’s performing the requisite spells, and while Potter is in the best mood he has seen him in, Draco dares to make conversation. If he’s fishing for information at the same time, well, that’s just because Potter is one of the least forthcoming patients he’s ever worked with.
“If the intent is to pleasure oneself sexually, I think the word works.”
This time, Draco shakes his head. “I knew at the end of our last session that I need to tell him. But I know he won’t take it well, and I know he’ll blame me—which is fine. He’ll need to process, and he’ll need someone to blame.” He looks stoically over his desk at Granger-Weasley. “I can be that for him, but he will also need support.”
They don’t talk about it next week. At least, not straight away. It’s still the

“So I date, I hit it off with someone, we’ve got so much to talk about it’s great. But then what if they can’t handle—can’t handle the weird sex? Don’t want to find out what turns me on? Just want to get their own rocks off? That’s so much time to invest in someone that it might not work out with.”
“Doesn’t it?”
“Maybe try masturbation again, but not with your own hands.”
Potters sits up and Draco can feel his eyes on him, but Draco keeps his gaze averted until it lands on Potter’s wheelchair. Pulling his eyes up to meet Potter’s he raises his eyebrows in question. Potter’s nod is only slightly less stiff than it was last week.
Draco just about succeeds in fighting an eye roll.
“As I said, it will involve broadening your horizons, trying new things, and having a
it’d be time to start worrying. But
“Why don’t you think you can have that?”
. Granger-Weasley obviously isn’t going to leave this alone. Draco expected no less.
“It’s getting stronger,” finishes Granger-Weasley. “The Gemino is becoming resistant to the spells keeping it at bay, like we knew it would.”
An hour and a half passes before either of them looks at the clock, but for once, Potter doesn’t seem in a hurry to dash from the room.
And with that, Potter skilfully twists his chair 180 degrees and pushes himself towards the door. His wand is out and the door is open before he reaches it.
“What do you mean?” Potter’s voice is quieter, more unsure.
working.” Draco attempts to keep the smugness from his voice. “You need to keep going.”
Potter doesn’t notice. He’s too busy getting increasingly frustrated that he can’t get himself up.
“So,” he says eventually, “all this time you’ve been listening to me talk about sex and giving me advice about sex and you… don’t have sex yourself?”
He steps back, holding the door open as Potter wheels himself through.
“Huh.”
“Anything.”
“You said—” Potter speaks calmly with his eyes closed. “—about physical changes and symptoms.”
“Okay,” Potter whispers to the wall.
“You’re struggling with it.”
Just as quickly, Potter clamps his mouth shut. Draco folds his forearms on his desk and waits.
Draco does, but the small smile is on his face the entire time.
“I don’t think that’s going to happen any time soon.”
Draco looks down at the notes on his desk. His observations of the curse and the research that has lead him around in circles with no useful results. When he speaks, it’s to the table top.
“Okay,” mutters Potter into the couch. He takes a deep breath. “Do it.”
“If none of it is—” Potter makes a vague circular motion at his own crotch. “—working, why do I currently have the bluest balls I’ve ever had in my life?”
important.”
“What for? Finally listening to common sense?”
Potter’s fingers are tapping on the arms of his wheelchair, teeth all but gnawing on his bottom lip. Still, Draco looks at him and remains silent.
running out of time.”
Draco scribbles his notes on the discharge papers, practically illegible, as they should be. He signs his name and slides the form and quill over to Potter.
Definitely not ideal.
“It’s okay to be angry, Potter. This happened to you, and it isn’t fair, and you’re allowed to be angry about it.”
“No need to apologise,” Draco tells him. “It sounded like you needed it.”
“No.” Granger-Weasley’s words are firm. “No talking like that. Even if we don’t get anywhere with the research or how to cancel the curse, you said it can be removed.”
“Shoot.”
Draco can only nod.
Draco nods. “In the five days Potter’s been here the Gemino spell has already started reactivating and will begin spreading the Tabes within a few days. The Gemino will need monitoring and cancelling again at least once a week, but that’s only sustainable for so long. The more it’s interfered with, the—”
sex. I don’t feel sexual attraction to others, or generally. I don’t masturbate—I don’t get, ah, blue balls.”
“Of course, yes. I’ll do it. Ron will do it. We’ll visit him after his appointment on Friday evening.”
“I’m pleased for you, Potter. I hope you find your someone.”
Next week, things are easier between them. Potter arrives on time, they smile and nod in greeting, and trade typically dull, safe small talk. It’s only when he is performing the usual spells, with Potter laying on the examination couch beneath him, that Draco’s notices something is off.
“So people know some things about you—some things that
“Right.” Draco drops his arms and regrets even asking. “Of course. Well, we’re done here.” He steps back from the examination couch.
Draco takes a deep breath and speaks to Potter.
“There was a young girl not long after I became an independent Healer. She’d picked up an enchanted watch. A strangulation curse began in her fingers, slow moving, but severely restricting blood flow as it spread to her palm and her wrist. There is no counter-curse. There was only ever one possible treatment.”
“Sorry?”
Dashing to the door, he pulls it open to see Potter in the small reception room. He’s in his wheelchair, tapping his fingers on the armrests, eyes moving constantly about the room.
with me and help me find a new orgasm?”
Potter nods into the padding beneath his head. “Yes. I understand.” Potter’s breathing is heavy, but steady. “What will happen to the curse when you’ve removed it?”
Potter physically recoils.
Draco isn’t sure Potter really hears him, as he still seems caught up in his own thoughts, but he drifts over the the couch all the same.
“Was there anything else, Potter?” asks Draco.
“I haven’t found anything useful. What about you?”
“I— It’s—” Potter hesitates to speak.
“No offence taken at all.”
Potter is a charming shade of red, but he’s looking intently at Draco as he nods. “They do, yeah.”
“Er, hi,” says Potter. As if he genuinely believes Draco doesn’t know he’s there.
“About the curse, Potter. Have you talked to your friends about getting the curse removed and what your life will be like moving forward?”
They go through the usual motions. The small talk, the spells, the getting Potter down. It seems to go much swifter than normal. Of course it would. The one day Draco wouldn’t mind the small talk dragging on a little while longer, delaying the inevitable.
“You’re going to need to accept this, Potter. I might still be looking, but I’m only going over things I’ve already looked into in the slimmest chance I missed something. We’re fast running out of time.”
other thing, with the original other thing now apparently their main focus.
Potter sits up, a small frown on his face. “I don’t feel any different.”
As the hospital staff push forward to turn the patient over and make them more comfortable, Draco moves towards the door to leave. He only makes it one step before the strong jaw, slightly crooked nose, and broad, scarred forehead stop him in his tracks.
“Generally, yes.”
“Are you kidding? I hate the line, but—I’m Harry Potter. Everyone I meet already knows too much about me. How can I build a real relationship from that?”
“How are you doing, generally?” asks Draco, carefully keeping his voice casual.
Draco laughs. “I make no promises.”
“Harry would be alive and safe if the curse was removed? I said it and you looked… unsure. If there’s something else going on, you need to tell me. Harry’s given you consent to discuss his treatment with me.”
“I know.” Potter rubs at his eyes under his glasses. “It’s been really difficult since I was released from St Mungo’s. Since I woke up, really.”
“Still thinking about me?” asks Draco.
“We’ve got people on it. Murder
They repeat the process. Draco steadies the wheelchair and loops his arm around Potter’s waist, allowing Potter to lean against him and manoeuvre himself into the seat.
“Worried… professionally?” The corners of Potter’s mouth twitch briefly before turning down again. “Sorry. Sorry for running away last week and sorry for generally being an awkward, unhelpful patient. You’ve been nothing but professional and—and haven’t treated me any different because of—” Potter gestures to his legs. “—this.”
, but it’s… since this whole thing…” Potter sighs and picks up his finger tapping again.
Draco immediately relaxes. This, he can deal with, and his autopilot takes over. “I’m glad you felt able to tell me. There’s no shame in admitting you need help. I can contact St Mungo’s—their physiotherapists will no doubt have magical aids that can help with—”
“It’s hard. I mean, obviously it’s hard. I forget, sometimes. Try to get up, do something.” He sighs. “I get frustrated a lot. I live in a house with a lot of stairs, which I thought wouldn’t be that much of a problem—I can Apparate inside my own home…” Potter trails off.
