“Mocking me isn’t the same as teasing me.” Draco says, not knowing why his mouth is still moving and words are still coming out when he just wants Harry to-
“Well mate, if we come back later we’ll help you get to the shower, yeah?” Ron suggested, feeling pity for Harry.
The area is oddly quiet, the snow absorbing each snap of twig or rustle of whatever nocturnal creature is snuffling around.
Draco’s tailor was the opposite of Pierre, the castle’s portrait artist. Instead of being eccentric and excitable, Sebastian was stoic and tight-lipped. He took his job far too seriously, but did it with such speed that Draco
Draco looked at himself in the mirror. His tunic hangs loosely off of him, and his trousers are tied tightly with a leather strap. His normal clothes weren’t spectacular, but they were hardly anything like what a peasant would wear. The fabric was imported from luxury clothes shops, his tunic was woven delicately by one of the best seamstresses in the Kingdom, and his shoes had been specially made for him, embellished with gold ringlets. He wished he would be able to fill out his clothes better, like Harry did, but he was always naturally skinny and the cloth makers had thought he would be filled out from fighting. He never looked horrible, though, even if his clothes didn’t fit him. His face is one of beauty. He has a naturally gorgeous complexion. The clothes that Adelaide had picked out today were much nicer than what he’d normally wear, but that was because half of the kingdom was seeing him.
“Oh, I’m here.” He says confidently, flopping back onto the bed, staring up at Harry as he kneels next to him. Harry smirks, clambering over so that his knees bracket Draco’s hips. He lowers himself down, so that he’s sitting on Draco’s lap, and Draco’s body hitches up involuntarily.
“No distractions.” Harry says, tilting his head back to break the kiss. He holds Draco as if he weighs nothing, and it’s a bit romantic but it also makes him feel like a damsel in distress.
“Basically. As soon as the next day rolls around, people are more concerned about the next ball and already planning what they’re wearing. I always used to to play the tired card and leave early to go to my rooms, but now I don’t really have a choice. I think I’d feel bad if I just ditched Celeste during the night.”
“Great.” Harry said, airily. “Great. Good.” He said again, quickly standing from his seat and making his way to the door.
“You saw me get injured?” Harry now turned completely toward Malfoy in surprise. He had been in the Quidditch grounds when he hurt himself.
Professor Pomfrey had come in 10 minutes after Harry had woken up, and at her arrival, Draco woke up too.
“Ah, right. Cadogen used to hold mini tournaments between our teams, but I’ve never competed in a proper one before.”
“Well maybe you should think about what you do, BEFORE YOU DO IT!” Harry cried again, his anger slowly starting to become sadness.
“But for now try and get back to sleep, a bit of rest will do you good.” She pulls out something from under the chair. “I’ve brought the book I gave you, to get you out of your foul mood.”
Draco looks between Narcissa and Lucius as Harry steps back. “What is he doing here?” He says, lifting his chin to return back to his perfect posture. He doesn’t know what’s gotten over him, but Draco blames the way he’s acting on Lucius, who hardly lets Draco confer with people outside the castle. Draco couldn’t care much about Harry being here, or at least, he could act like he didn’t care. Draco was a prince after all, he can be cold and demanding all he wanted. But he wasn’t sure if he wanted to be that to Harry.
Draco doesn’t get Juliet out this time, instead traversing down the rocky faces on unstable wooden steps.
They head to the stables, Harry pretending to be Draco’s ‘escort’ and dramatically bowing at everyone they passed.
Draco groans, bringing his hands up to cover his face. “God this is so embarrassing, I can’t even skip a stone!”
“Beauty is pain, is it not?” She says as she ties the end of the braid. Draco doesn’t move from the stool, and Adelaide sighs.
“Good. I’ll contact your parents for payment, and advise whoever is styling your hair on the night.”
“It’s tradition. I’d rather the dancing just be us swaying from side to side.” He shrugs, and takes Harry’s calloused hands into his own. “I don’t think we’ll be doing this dance tomorrow. If so, I’ll be praying for your dance partner’s feet.”
“Now, Draco, get Adelaide to- actually, while you’re here, show Sir Harry to the master bedroom in the bed chambers and then have Adelaide give him a tour of the castle.” Narcissa says sharply, her eyes piercing through Draco’s.
Draco does what he’s told, and only opens his mouth to let out a hiss as Harry preps him. It’s tight, almost unbearably tight, but Harry is smiling at him and Draco can feel his erection pressing on the back of his thigh.
He’s in a relationship with Harry. Harry Potter the knight. Sir Potter. He feels his lips against his own, his hand in his, lingering and strong. Touching him, caressing him. Harry doing the same.
Draco has found himself smiling at the other knights as they pass, and he’s always surprised to find them smiling back.
He doesn’t know what to feel right now. If only Harry could admit these things when he was sober, and maybe Draco would find the answers he was looking for. From their time together at the beach, Draco had a glimpse of hope that maybe there could be something between them, but what with drunk Harry saying right now, he couldn’t feel any more insecure.
He’s almost about to turn away, not really caring for whatever they were doing. Harry catches his arm before he can even think about it, and pushes him through the doorway by the small of his back. Draco tries to focus as he steps in.
Things with Harry have basically been perfect. Harry’s perfect. They both seem on the same page, both full of want but also compassion and warmth. As unhealthy as it is, they both want to be with each other as much as possible. Whether it be talking in an alcove for a few sacred minutes, or quiet, peaceful nights nestled together in Draco’s room, Draco too tired to do anything more than kissing and feeling horrendously guilty about it. Harry says that he doesn’t mind, that Draco should get some sleep, but lately that’s been impossible. Sleep hasn’t been coming easily since the ball.
Harry just rolled his eyes. “But there’s still people who are mad. So I am much safer in the castle then being anywhere else. I’m glad for it, though.”
“Jesus mother fucking christ.” He practically shouts, slowly stripping Draco out of his clothes. Draco tries to cover Harry’s mouth with his hands, but Harry grabs them both and pins them to the door.
“I’m off to the stables, thank the kitchens for my breakfast.” Draco nods and makes his way out of the hall. Talking about Celeste was painful, and it made it that much worse with Harry Potter in the room. How can he be an all-mighty Prince if he doesn’t act like one, in front of everyone. Even though Draco hated his Father for being so controlling, he sometimes did care about his position.
Draco rolls his eyes and points at an armchair, indicating Harry to sit down. Sebastian swats at his moved arm.
“Well for you they are.” He concedes, tying up the string on the front of the ghillie shirt and turning around, finding Harry staring directly at...well directly at his cock. Draco forces the blush away and Harry’s eyes meet his face again, coughing and righting himself. He helps Draco carry the tailored clothes and passes them over to Adelaide as delicately as Draco has ever seen him.
“Rather uneventful.” He lies. “My father was out on a call last night, so we missed our midnight mass and instead had it this morning.”
“I just- It will change everything. And it’s too late now. There’s nothing I can do.” He exhales, closing his eyes even harder.
Draco didn’t say anything, he just removed the cloak he was wearing as the heat of the furnaces blasted warmth into the office-like area. Draco could hear muffled voices coming from the other side of the door, and Harry just stood, focused on something embedded in his fingernail. This was the first time that Draco had truly seen Harry at loss of what to do, or say or feel. Harry’s friends were charming enough, but Harry seemed to lose his confidence when Draco made it clear that he was confused at the whole situation. It was common for townsfolk to be flustered at his presence, but with Harry being here it felt almost embarrassing. There was a pink flush on Harry’s cheeks, telling Draco that maybe he was embarrassed too.
He’ll see Harry tomorrow, and Draco can tell him all the tragic events of the night. And then they can kiss and Draco’s world wouldn’t be titled anymore, and Harry can find the warmth of family in Draco.
Draco pushes back from the garden table and carefully takes off his tunic, resting it on the back of his chair.
Having a crush on someone was a lot more intense than Draco had thought it would be. Or perhaps that was just him.
“I don’t know! It’s nerve-wracking, I feel like your Father is always watching.” Harry said, looking around, checking behind an aisle of books to see if an angry Lucius was there to tell him to get back to work.
“Then do what I do, sit still and look pretty.” Draco huffed, a small smile sitting on the corner of his mouth.
you do? Frolic around the castle. You’d best count yourself lucky that Celeste was willing to marry you.”
‘Give your mother and father my love. And Juliet too. Farewell for now, Prince, I am most eagerly awaiting your next letter. Love, Princess Celeste.’
‘Draco-‘ It read. ‘I loved this. Honestly, you should consider contacting a publisher. Now, I know you’ll disagree but if you just...’
“You really want to be in it?” Draco asked, surprised. He knew Harry had always got into shit against his will, and he didn’t know why Harry would willingly enter himself under his own accord. He felt a kind of relief at knowing that Harry was too young. If he died, he wouldn’t have someone to poke around and annoy.
(and p.s please let me know if you like it by leaving a comment. I’m also happy to explain anything that’s going on that may confuse you. Like the time this is set etc...)
She grimaces, and the worry in her eyes is clear in the bright morning light. “You’re mother and father visited, and they’re trying to find you the medicine as quick as possible. The only problem is that the closest apothecary with what you need is in the next land.”
“Is it to do with Sir Potter? I saw that you were quite uneasy last night when he was in your study.” Adelaide quietly says, walking further into the room.
It is very short and I hope you forgive me but I like the way this ends and it will give me more time to write chapter 4 which will hopefully be a lot longer and a lot juicier(!)
Harry is there almost like he’s waiting for him at the bottom, to greet him and then snatch him away from Celeste. If only.
“Reminds me of the time when my hip was actually fully functioning.” Harry sighed, playing with a small dent in the wooden table.
“Thought it’d be fine? You really think-“ He starts, raising his voice but stopping, the need to tend to Harry’s injuries overcoming him.
“Draco,” Adelaide says, but stops. She walks over to Draco and kisses the top of his head. “I’ll be back later.” She smiles and leaves.
Still, he cares for the other man more than he can imagine. He listens through the crack in the door, and when he hears the heavy snores belonging to Harry, he slips through the door.
Dumbledore had begun saying when the first challenge was, but the goblet had turned red and spat flames everywhere. Harry didn’t know what’s going on. His friends were asking around to find an answer.
Draco thought at that moment that Harry would probably love his lake. He could share another one of his private spots with Harry. He sort of felt like Harry deserved some place where he could rest, because knowing Lucius, he must wear Harry out with all his tasks.
“I’m not sure...” He says, reaching over to pick up the parcel and inspecting the glossy paper. There’s a name under one of the folds, and Draco recognises it as Adelaide’s messy script.  He grins, explains to Harry that it’s his present from Adelaide, and rips the packaging open.
Harry stared, piercing his green eyes into grey ones. He took a deep breath and saw that Draco wasn’t pleading for him to come talk to him. Wasn’t showing that anything that had happened between them meant something.
“No, no. It’s nothing like that. I just feel bad and there’s nothing I can do.” He says, holding his head in his hands.
“Talk about-“ He snaps. “What’s she got to do with you? And who says I want to talk to you anyway?” Draco says in exasperation, waving his hands about.
Harry settles himself in the far corner of the sofa, allowing Draco to rest his legs on his lap. He ought to get a bigger chair...
And now, Harry and Draco are treading through the snow to reach Lake James. It’s the first time they’ve spent more than a minute together in a while.
Harry woke up four hours later, hungry for food. As he cracked open his eyes and began to sit up, he heard a whining noise coming from just outside the infirmary. Ignoring it, Harry grabbed his glasses and took a dose of his medication so that his ribs could heal without becoming completely deformed.
There are eager faces turned in his direction, and Draco decides they’ll play a game where everyone can play. He deals out the cards, explains the rules with an alacrity he didn’t know he had, and allows the game to start.
“So, mate, you said you needed a new sword? Are they putting you back on the field?” Ron asked, placing his hands on the table and folding them, trying to seem business-like.
“Prince Draco.” Harry says, bowing. Draco stands in silent shock at Harry’s professionalism towards him, something Draco didn’t think Harry had. He was a charmer, Draco thought. He isn’t really like this.
Time ticked slower and slower each minute Harry had to lay next to Draco. He wanted to run away. Run as far as he could. But his body was broken and tired. What’s Draco going to do now? Draco can’t get away from him. Can’t escape him. If he had the choice would he do it? Leave Harry? Out him to the school?
Before he can close his eyes, there’s a clattering come from down the hallway. Draco feels as though he wants to cry. His sudden submergence in freezing water earlier has weakened his body, and he’d rather do anything than stand up and inspect the situation.
Draco slowly turned, shrugging his shoulder that Harry’s hand was on. Did he not want Harry to touch him?
Maybe ignoring Harry was going to be harder than it seemed, seeing as they were staying in the same castle. Why was he trying to ignore him again? Oh right, because he was a fucking twerp who thinks he so handsome and intelligent. Not to Draco, though. Harry is just an annoying mess of a person, and he completely ruins Draco’s Prince image.
“Shit.” Harry says suddenly, stopping abruptly. Draco lifts his head to meet is eye, and Harry is grimacing and clenching his jaw.
“It’s so unfair.” He slumps back against the bed in exasperation. “Can I look at him like that? Am I allowed?”
Draco opens a drawstring bag and pulls out bandages, cloths and a selection of different salves. He sucks in his breath as he moves closer to Harry. His hip was still slightly covered by his tunic and so he delicately tries to pull it up, avoiding any physical contact.
It wasn’t like Harry hadn’t done this before, though. He’d slurp his cups of tea, scratch his silver fork against the clay plates and left crumbs of everything absolutely everywhere.
“Don’t worry, Ron, you’ll be fine. If anyone is getting killed it’ll be me.” Draco added over Ron’s panic, his face deadpanned.
Harry drops his head onto Draco’s shoulder, and now Draco doesn’t know if he’s felt anything but pain and affliction.
Draco nodded, even though he wasn’t hearing a word. All he could feel was Harry’s hand on his, and how strange it felt. Something new, something unfamiliar. He tried to pull out of the touch, but found no use. He couldn’t tell if he liked it or not, and Harry wasn’t any help either. He was just looking out, across the lake.
“I mean they aren’t wrong.” Harry laughed, picking up his books. He shot a smirk at Draco but could see he wasn’t taking it as a joke. Never once has he felt bad about hurting Draco, but now his heart hurts when he sees Draco so upset.
Harry turns to him, smiling softly. “No, not really. There’ve been times when I’ve wondered.” He shrugged.
“There are many strange things you could have told me tonight and I would have believed you, but you admitting feelings for a man was not one of them.” Adelaide muses, but her face is inscrutable.
He tried looking around but the room was still dark, and his vision was still blurred after his accident and the lack of his glasses. He immediately put them on and and grabbed his wand, before he realised that Draco was sitting cross legged on the other bed, glaring at Harry.
There was no way out of this, Draco deduced. He can’t just say ‘Sorry I haven’t been replying, I’ve just found out I’m gay and crushing on the most gorgeous resident knight. Hope you’re all well!’
The tournament was all that everyone could talk about. Lucius had made the  announcement earlier that morning and now everyone was getting prepared for the next day. Everyone was excited. Everyone apart from Draco.
“How do you mess it up this bad?” She grumbles, tugging strands back. “I think it looks very smart!”
“I heard him shout at you and the other knights earlier. And what was that about an invitation? Surely he’d want you there?” He asks with an irate tone.
“Ah, great, thank you.” He stood up quickly and pulled the sword out from the bag. “Ah, wicked.” He said, admiring the sword.
“Let’s not go back.” Draco groans, leaning his head back onto Harry’s chest and looking up into his eyes.
“You know you’re parents won’t be happy.” She says to him, trying to say it as though it was a con to the idea, but the grimace she gives says   something else entirely.
He caught a glimpse of blonde and stopped. Draco was at the end of the corridor, his hands on his thighs as he was taking deep breaths.
Harry nodded, although it hardly looked like he was paying attention to Pierre. He was looking, sort of studying Draco’s face. Draco squirmed slightly under Harry’s gaze, whatever the meaning behind it sending shivers up Draco’s spine.
She supports his back as he rises up, his joints clicking painfully and headache worsening at the sudden movement. He sways.
Harry stood, in awe at the room. The gallery was like a long hall with two floors, the stairs to get to the second floor in the middle of the first.
‘I hope we are still in contact by the time we’re eighteen. It’s been thrilling talking to you again, I remember when we were nine. We would run through the castle’s gardens, much to my mothers dismay. I hope you remember too, it seems like long ago since you moved out of the land.’ A smile and a nostalgic feeling. A sigh.
On their way to Draco’s library, a rumbling sound emerges from the sky before there’s a heavy downpour of rain. The walls of the corridors seem to echo the sound, and it’s so comforting that Draco releases a contented sigh and lets his whole body relax, bumping into Harry’s shoulder companionably.
Harry stood in awe immediately as he set foot on the ground. It wasn’t the biggest spectacle in the world, Draco thought, but there was something in the way that Harry was looking at it, with the sun glinting off the surface and onto his face, that made him see it through new eyes, and fell in love with the area all over again.
The soft spot that Harry has for Draco was a major benefit in this situation, as Harry began to make his way back to Draco, a worried expression on his face.
“I was definitely too big for my boots back then.” Draco laughs, partly enjoying himself but also panicking slightly about how Celeste’s face is inches from his.
“It’s just- The castle is so restricting!” Draco flopped back into his bed. “The lake and the beach is the only place I can go, and it gets boring staring at body’s of water for hours on end.”
His head is on Harry’s lap, and Harry himself is absolutely quaking. His usual coffee-coloured skin is white.
The deep strokes steal his breath away, and with every thrust he can’t help but moan. Harry has his head pressed into Draco’s shoulder, biting his collarbone hard enough to leave a mark. It’s not a surprise that Harry is very physical, all sharp edges and electric energy. Draco’s up for trying anything, it’s not like his new-found adventurous side should stop in the bedroom.
“Oh, I thought you would know about them, I guessed at the castle you’d-“ Ron started, but stopped after once again speaking whatever was on his mind. It was refreshing for Draco. “Never mind.” He said guiltily.
Harry shot awake. He was used to Hermione shouting him awake. He thought something was wrong. The last time he was woken up by a shouting voice the campground at the world cup was on fire.
They share a meaningful glance, both thinking about what happened yesterday and what will happen now.
“Sir Potter.” Draco nods after a seconds hesitation, still oddly baffled at Harry’s presence. Although Harry was very popular in the Kingdom, Draco had never formally met him. He only became a Knight recently, but his popularity grew quickly. But Draco was going to try all he could to be a proper prince, because Harry Potter was in his castle.
Malfoy was close to screaming but decided not to and slammed his head into his pillow instead. He didn’t want any more injuries and have to stay even longer with ‘Saint Potter’.
Draco laughs humourlessly, “Already got one.” He wants to add ‘It’s called Celeste’ but that’s too horrible. He already feels bad for her.
Draco rests his forearms on the stone windowsill and watches. He doesn’t mind the chill floating through, doesn’t mind how it blows the fire out and leaves goosebumps over his skin.
Draco slumps into his bed, allowing his eyes to drift closed again, and only waking up for dinner. Whatever Draco is feeling, he’s either going to have to sort it out or ignore it all together. But it is Harry Potter, and ignoring him has proved to not be easy.
The large room with long tables and glowing sconces is occupied, by his parents and by Harry Potter.
“Yes, he did. But he suffered an injury and couldn’t carry on the same, and then he started working for us.”
He waited until he caught Draco’s eyes, but Draco kept his head down low and didn’t look up at all, like he could feel Harry watching him. Like he was avoiding Harry all together.
Draco thinks he’s blushing from head to toe. He’s never been held like this before, and it’s doing things to him.
“Apart from making announcements, no. We have a lot of what the town has in our castle, Father thinks it’s a waste of time to venture outside...” Draco stopped as he noticed Harry’s bright green eyes searching around his face, his mouth twitching into a playful smile.
“You’re not an ungrateful snob, Draco.” Harry relies softly, turning his head to look at Draco. Draco is looking right back. “It makes sense. All of it, really.”
When he turns back into the room, Harry is now trouser-less. He glances down at the swollen hip that is covered in gashes. Draco loses his ability to breathe, partly because of the sight of Harry’s wounds but also because all that Harry had on now was a white tunic and a pair of pants.
There’s a small smile tugging on his face, but it quickly drops as he opens the door to the dining hall.
“Oh shush, Ron. Malfoy has been in the hospital the same amount of time that Harry has been in for. Don’t you think you could be a nice person for once?”
“Morning Xalvador.” He mutters, stroking the large black horse that belongs to his father. He breathes in a scent of fresh hay, but he quickly scrunches his nose up at the foul smell of the horses.
“Draco- I didn’t. I don’t know how I was picked.” Harry exclaimed, trying to get Draco to understand.
“Ooo! Ada! I like that nickname. I shall now call you Ada from now on.” Harry smiles and Adelaide blushes profusely, her hand covering her mouth.
“Because he’s fun.” Harry announces a bit too loudly. Draco blushes at the embarrassment. What time was the tailor coming again? “Besides, I bet you five gold coins that Draco
“Yes, yes. I though this was an adventure. Why so tense, Potter?” Draco smirked, pulling the hood down.
Before he enters the grand doors, he applies his ‘Prince Draco’ facade. A grand smile, proper royal etiquette, the likes of what he’s been brought up with.
“Oh stop, I’m blushing.” Draco said in a silly voice. Harry had never seen him so at peace before, and he knew that Draco never acted like that in front of his friends before, in fear of judgment.
Harry looks down at his torso, where Draco’s pristine white shirt stretches tightly over Harry, almost at ripping point around his arms.
Draco takes him though a load of new steps, something faster and flashier. Harry’s stumbling is almost endearing.
“Shhhhh” He says, rubbing small circles on his cheekbones with his thumb. Harry tries to laugh, but with all his shaking it comes out as a squeak.
“Well I’m sure it had a name, it’s not actually my lake. I bet you there’s a book about it in the castles main library.”
Draco knew that they didn’t have much, seeing as the shop and Harry’s flat are quite small, and that they had their own house to pay for, and all the people in their family that they had to pay for, too.
“Sebastian will be here soon.” His mother says lightly, although she’s wearing the same face his father is.
Before Draco can even ask what he’s planning to do, Harry suddenly ruts up. “Oh, God, Draco.” He moans, sarcastically.
“I remember you telling me that you just didn’t love her, and god if I had known then that you weren’t straight.” Harry says, taking his hand. “We would be doing this a lot sooner.”
“Did it mean something to you?” Harry blurted out, unable to keep quiet anymore. He needed to know, for his own sanity.
Harry’s eyes widen and he bites his lip in trying not to laugh. Draco shouldn’t find it sexy. What’s his life come to?
“You always have little spots, don’t you?” Harry asks, watching as Draco settles himself and crosses one leg over the other.
“I’ve got to get back. Royal duties and everything.” He grimaced. Taking the bag and flipping the hood onto his head.
Draco lay there, in shock. He watched as Harry flashed him a sheepish grin and turned away from him. Had Harry just said Draco was his type? Draco’s breath quivered as he tried to control his emotions. But before he could even stop himself, Draco turned and sat at the edge of his bed, and slowly stood up and walked to the side of Harry’s bed. It had just hit him, but Draco realised that this was the closest they had been in their whole lives. But Draco loved it. His heart thrummed in his throat and his head was a blur. He lay a hand on Harry’s arm, tensing up as he met warm, hard muscle. Harry froze at the second he felt Draco touch him, but decided to let Draco do what he was about to do. Draco lowered his body on to Harry’s bed, and inched up so close that his chest had met with Harry’s back. He knew Harry could feel his heart beat a million times per second, but he didn’t mind. He wanted Harry to know that he didn’t mind. He wanted Harry to know that he felt the same. That somehow, Harry was his type too.
But, one time, a week after Harry had borrowed Draco’s book, Draco came back from wine-tasting to find his book on his bed with a slip of parchment rested on-top.
“Yeah, the rows go all the way down the gallery, all the way back up and ends halfway upstairs.” Draco said, gesturing to the iron railed balcony above them.
“It was taken from their house when they died, and they never rightfully returned it.” Draco explains. “If I’d have known, I would have taken it earlier.”
Juliet is tugged by Draco as he gets her out of the stables. The grounds are silent and dark now but the fires inside the castle provided a faint glow.
“Okay, and? We have a swordsmith in the south wing.” Draco replied, his eyes narrowing in slight confusion.
“I’m...going to go...go sit.” Draco says quietly, tightening his grip on the paper. Much to his chagrin, and overwhelming affection, Harry follows. Draco lowers himself into a groove in the wood, and Harry settles himself on the sand.
“Hey!” Draco growled loudly over the sound of Harry’s chuckles. He tugged the hood back so that it rested on his head and shot a deathly glare towards Harry.
“I hadn’t realised it affected you that much. I thought you liked the attention.” Draco said defensively, sinking back into his chair.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Adelaide shouts, barging past Harry and standing in front of the sofa. “Please tell me you did not just throw yourself onto that couch in your new ball outfit.”
He was nowhere near Harry’s level, but through the element of surprise, he finds himself straddled over Harry with his sword pressed lightly against his neck.
Harry stared into Draco’s face for a couple of seconds, something on the tip of his tongue, but his face dropped and he shrugged with a smile. “Nothing. Everything. Romeo sure likes the stables.”
His mouth met Draco’s, and Draco immediately relaxed into the touch. Harry brought his hand up and carded it through Draco’s hair, pushing Draco harder into his flustered face.
“Yes, the lady’s in land can be a little obsessive at times.” Harry laughs, his face jokingly desperate.
“One of the townspeople that looked after me was friends with Ron’s mother, and so we saw each other often. Hermione was local to the workshop and she visited almost everyday. Ron and I had thought that she just had an interest in wielding, but now we know it was because she was in love with him.” Harry said, earning a chuckle from Ron and an exasperated gasp from Hermione.
“Oh, you wish.” Draco replies softly against Harry’s lips, sliding his hands down Harry’s fabric-clad torso. He breaks off, looking down at Harry’s clothes,
As soon as the food was taken up to them, they sat cross legged across from each other, appreciating how much better the great hall food was compared to the lousy gone-off meals that they got from the infirmary kitchen. They both smiled into their sandwiches when the other made a sarcastic comment which always came out as friendly teasing.
Draco’s admittance inspired by the song ‘She’ by Dodie! Also medicine scene may have been inspired by that one episode of Merlin...
Before he can even get close to the ground, Harry catches him. One of his hands is pressed to the small of Draco’s back, and the other on the nape of his neck. He gazes into emerald green eyes that look down at him, and watched as Harry’s face cracks into a smirk. Draco had completely forgotten what he was going to say as Harry’s warm palm fits perfectly around his head. Draco is so close to just rising up and grabbing Harry’s neck like the way he was doing to him right now, but he loses all confidence.
When Draco looked up as he turned into the back-room, eight faces stared at him, their eyes and mouths wide in shock.
‘Have fun.’ He thought to himself. The voice in his head sounded a lot like Adelaide, and he decided if he wasn’t going to enjoy the trip out, at least it will make Adelaide happy that he’s living his life by his own rules.
He pulls it out, admiring how precise the stitching is and finding the usual pocket tucked in just under the arm hole. There’s a always a name tag attached to the collar, but Draco realises it doesn’t have his name on. He looks closer, and in gold thread reads:
“Sounds nice.” Draco smiles, happy that Harry is having a normal day besides the confusing events of last night, or technically this morning.
“At your absence, Sir Potter was telling us about his quests and battles. You’re the same age and you have yet to accomplish anything whereas Sir Potter has achieved more at his age than some of our oldest Knights have in their lifetime.”
He throws his head back in laughter and applauds Adelaide for her knowledge of Draco and her sense of humour.
The child in the first one looked nothing like Draco, his cheeks too chubby and nose too small. As Harry progressed along the wall, the portraits changed. Draco had too. He lost his polite smile at the age of nine, and it turned into a sneer. His blonde hair grew by the age of three, his high cheekbones revealed at the age of seven and his pointed, long nose prominent by the age of eleven. Then Draco saw himself at fourteen. He had a grand smile on his face, and noticed the gleaming ring on his finger, the bulk of it a great difference to his slender hand.
There’s a blanket of silence, and Draco’s heart drops. Well, what had he’d expected? It wasn’t like he wanted to be friends with them all anyway...
“I need you teach to me.” Harry says, mustering up a confidence that was severely lacking moments ago. He straightens his back and towers over Draco, his eyes pleading.
“Night.” Harry closes his heavy eyes and felt his heartbeat slow down. Maybe the next two weeks wouldn’t be so bad after all.
“I’m just informing Sir Potter about the inner workings of the castle. It’s an honour we have such a brave Knight working for us.” Narcissa informs, shooting a stern glance at Draco.
“Ah, yes Ada.” Draco quickly coughed, putting a smile on his face. “Tea would be grand.” He said warily, noticing Adelaide’s eyebrow shoot up in concern.
“It’s a good thing though, I guess, I don’t know what you would have done if we had told you a story about Harry without knowing that.”
Harry lay in silence. Did Draco Malfoy just call him beautiful? No, it must have been one of his infamous sarcastic comments. But why did he sound so sincere? “Well at least you can agree that I do need it, if I hear that laugh one more time I might actually go crazy.”
“Fine.” Harry scowls, but a small smile appears on his lips. His face was beggining to grow pinker, too.
“What the FUCK?” Ron said, turning into the corridor and finding Harry and Draco snogging. Behind stood a red faced Hermione and an angry Pansy Parkinson.
“Yes, I’m sure. I never knew my parents, so it’s hard for me to miss them that much.” Harry shrugged subtly.
“Don’t have high expectations.” Draco drawled, because it was actually very boring. Draco would rather write a million meaningless letters to Celeste than have to spectate people dressed in metal playing with metal.
Harry couldn’t take one more second of her whining and was about to shatter his glass of water in anger but before he could do so, Hermione and Ron walked in.
“As much as you look so fucking delicious in this, I would like it off now.” Harry says with need and hidden desperation. He’s running his hands up and down the insides of Draco’s thigh, slowly inching up.
Ron scooted around the growing customers and opened a large oak door, revealing a larger room with metal scraps, furnaces and work tables. There were more gingers working around the room, all smiling and greeting Harry with warmth and comfort.
“M’not.” He says through chattering teeth. Draco reaches out and places both of his hands lightly on either side of Harry’s face, staring into bright green eyes.
“I am not meticulous. I just take my job seriously, and part of my job is to be loyal to you and your family. How am I supposed to be loyal if you and your family don’t trust me first?”
He’s standing in one of the castles many rooms, adorned with the usual gold-edged furniture. He thinks it might be the spare parlour, if the misused atmosphere and stale air was anything to go by.
Draco visibly sags, relief flooding him. He was very glad that this was what Harry was worrying over, and not the fact that Harry had somehow found out Draco’s interest in him and was appalled by it.
“It was crazy when we found out Harry wanted to be a Knight. It was practically impossible for a person living around here to become one, and we had thought Harry was a lazy bugger who didn’t go out.” Ron grinned.
“Juliet’s a beautiful horse.” Harry says, making conversation. He didn’t strike Draco as a talkative type, but then again regarding Harry’s position he may be the most talkative man in the kingdom.
Draco focuses back onto his own steps, twisting Celeste expertly and trying not to notice everyone’s attention on him.
“Well, on the battlefront I got hit in the hip, and it messed it up. It’s not anything bad but I can’t walk for too long without it starting to hurt and seize up. I’ll live, though.” Harry sighs, rubbing his right hip over the fabric of his trousers. He pauses and then continues, “Cadogen, our commander, demanded that I leave to heal. I protested, of course, because I didn’t want to be stopped by a minor setback and so I asked if there were any Guard Knight jobs. Cadogan said he knew your Father, so he talked and now I’m here, I guess.”
“Sure I can. I am the Prince.” He said, but it was hard to ignore the sadness in his voice. “As long as you keep to yourselves no one will say a word.”
Draco lifted his hood, quite displeased with Ron’s statement. He had trusted Harry enough to reveal himself, knowing that he was so close to whoever these people were.
“Are you- reading a book?” Draco said from where he lay, watching Harry as he concentrated on the ivory pages.
“Right, Mr Malfoy” Pomfrey sighed “Two weeks you will be spending here because of your foolish actions. You’ll have to get a friend to bring you classwork and you will  need to take this medication every hour.”
Draco clips down the stone stairs and makes his way to the stables that were lodged far behind the castle.
“Not particularly.” Draco said, pausing to look at Harry’s face. “It’s Weasley who you should be asking.”
The sun slowly rose and left a golden light throughout the hospital. The morning owls had visited for the first time since their arrival, and it was all the same stuff. Draco’s weekly daily mail paper and a letter from his Mother. He put the paper to the side and read the letter from Narcissa. Although they had only just arrived back at school, Narcissa still missed Draco. Draco missed her too. Her letters show more and more concern about Lucius and his behaviour. Draco wants to help but he has no power. No strength to stand up to his own Father.
Draco buries his face further into her neck and clutches to the fabric on his bed, trying to get his frustration to subside. His small hiccups grow into loud sobs, and his body begins to shake in weakness.
Draco stood up from his stand and ran off, out of the hall. Harry looked from Dumbledore to a running Draco. He stood up, feeling judged by the eyes and ran out after Draco.
If you are enjoying this fic please do leave a comment!! It helps a lot with motivation and I’d love to know what you think 😌
“Won’t you get recognised, too? Surely you don’t want that.” Draco said in a small voice, loosing the aim of his argument.
“That’s alright, just do it the old-fashioned way.” He winks, and because he’s an established heathen, he moves his hand from where it was resting next to Draco and pulls it up to his mouth, spitting on it.
He waited for Draco to return. He wanted to see him without his shirt. It was selfish but Harry couldn’t help himself. Draco walked through the door, with Hermione and Ron hesitantly supporting Draco as he slowly moved. Harry silently cursed when he saw that Draco was back into his pyjamas, obviously so that Ron and Hermione wouldn’t see him half naked.
“Well you should be thanking me. I saw you leave. I could have told your father.” Harry smiled and shrugged innocently.
“And I felt like I owed it to you. I truly am sorry, both for pushing you in and for what I said.” His eyes are sunken and he looks crestfallen.
With only a few plans on today, Draco finds himself in the library. His finished letter to Celeste is sitting on his knee, but Draco has no effort to send it off. Instead he listens to the steady beating of rain, glad that he was inside.
Draco sucks in air as Harry guides himself in, the feeling much thicker and fuller than Harry’s fingers. Harry slides slowly back, testing, and Draco gasps as he thrusts forward, Harry now fully inside him.
“Hi.” He smiles sheepishly, lowering himself behind the back of the sofa so that all Adelaide could see was the top of his head.
Draco smiles after what seems like a while. A lot of things have been happening at once, and he doesn’t feel like himself.
Harry’s breath caught and his heart leaped, but after a second of gazing he stopped and carried on with his work. How can Draco make him feel that way?
Ron turned to Hermione. “Why are you sticking up for that slimy git?” Ron muttered under his breath in the direction of Hermione. His hand was clutched around his wand. He knew Harry would be having a hard time with Draco.
He extends his hand so Draco can grab it, but stops when a snowflake lands on his hand. They both look up, snow falling delicately, and even throughout it all this is it. Moments like these are truly who he is. Who he wants to be and who he can be for Harry bloody Potter.
Draco swings his arm back with Harry’s aid and throws with as much professional technique as he can muster, but as it reaches the water, the small rock just makes an infinitesimal splash and then sinks.
The outfit he’s donning is far too large and his narrow shoulders are lost in the bulk of the shoulder pads. Naturally, the fabric is a dark green to match the general aesthetic, and there’s an absurd amount of buckles lined down the middle of his torso.
Things are different now, though, for better and for worse. He tries to focus on anything but the latter.
“Oh I couldn’t forget.” Celeste replies, and Draco notices that Celeste has moved close to him on the bench, and their shoulders are almost touching. “Or that time when you didn’t have a horse, and you’d thought it was a good idea to have a try on Xalvador, who was far too big bear in mind, and you fell of.”
“I am sweaty, my heart is going a million miles per hour and I could quite literally eat a horse right now.”
Harry places one hand on Draco’s hip to manoeuvre it forward and places his other on Draco’s elbow. Then he doesn’t let go.
The sun shone through the delicate glass, leaving green shadows drifting through. Draco wafted his hands through the rays, making his pale skin glow.
The small dust particles float around the air, swishing behind Draco’s flowing cloak. It was his favourite one, because it was the one that Adelaide had made him. Even though it was scorching outside, he wore the elegant fabric with pride. He ducked through small archways and went down hundreds of steps.
The table was quiet that morning, and Draco misses the sound of Harry’s slurps and the way he holds his cutlery. He would have though it odd if he thought about Harry this much when he first arrived, but now Draco had found a remedy for his boredom and he really enjoyed the adrenaline rush from his earlier outing.
Draco smiles to himself, unable to hate this man. Now he has the question of does Harry truly like him, or does he see him as a conquest?
Ron raised his eyebrows, his mouth twisting in hesitation. “It’ll cost you, mate. I know we normally do swords for free but we can’t give away the expensive items.”
A smile starts to spread on his face as he allows himself to think of only Harry. No obstacles in his way, no difficulties. He can just see Harry, in a full suit of armour, lying on his bed and smiling up at Draco. It’s a nice thought to think.
They slowly helped Harry up from his bed, and Draco pretended like he wasn’t bothered. But he was so happy for Harry that he could stand up. He had already shown off that he could when he made his way over to Harry’s bed. It was the only thing on Draco’s mind. That he and Harry Potter had shared a small hospital bed. And Harry didn’t move. But now Draco didn’t know what to do. He doesn’t know how to show affection. He got an occasional hug from his friends. And from his Mother. But he doesn’t know how. He had just shown Harry that he was interested in him, but now he couldn’t say anything. He doesn’t know what to do.
“There was a tempest. We’d left fallen people in the mud. It’s just the sound, it makes me feel like I’m back there. Like he’s just dying all over again.”
Harry had to return Romeo to the stables and have a briefing with Lucius, so they reluctantly said goodbye.
Draco emerges into the forest, and inhales  deeply, taking in the scent of moist soil and fresh lavender. The early morning sun streams through the leaves of the vast oak trees, illuminating small patches of Draco’s pale skin and leaving a calming warmth on the back of his neck. Draco makes his way down the same path he has always taken since he had gotten Juliet, and reminisces about Adelaide teaching him how to hold and control the reigns and how to calm the growing horse.
Harry lifts his head back from the dip between Draco’s neck and shoulder, and Draco knows. He can see it in the greens of his eyes and the way his lips twitch in need for something. Something that Draco’s neck or mouth can’t provide.
“I hope you have an alright evening.” Harry says sympathetically, hauling the portrait and book under his arm.
“If I find a single thread out of place then you’re one dead man, Draco Malfoy.” Adelaide says with a stern glare.
Draco feels like he’s dangling on Harry’s arms for far too long, and so he places his feet flat on the ground and stands up. He flattens out the rumples in his shirt and flicks at his misshapen hair. He tries to speak but all the words in his head are muddled. Dancing with Harry is slightly maddening.
“I need to get dressed for dinner.” He says into the calm air, wanting to elicit a response out of a very silent Harry. He’s worried, just for a second, that Harry is completely disgusted, and so he turns to look at him. If his wide smile and flushed face was anything to go by, Draco thinks he’s done pretty good.
“Lucius, I’d hardly call it a battle, more like a petty squabble.” Harry shrugs, and winces as Lucius slaps him on the shoulder in laughter.
“But...what?” He says, looking up. Harry is smiling from ear to ear, and Draco leaps forward to kiss him. He doesn’t care that Harry is dirty.
“Night, Harry.” Draco blurted out. If this is what it took for Harry and himself to become friends, he would have done it a long time ago.
“Her names Celeste, she lives-“ Narcissa starts but stops abruptly as Draco stands up, finishing the last of his fancy breakfast.
“Alright, thanks Ada.” Draco rubbed his sleepy face. Draco headed down to breakfast, hoping Harry might be there so he could entertain him, but as he passed through the courtyard, he saw Harry on duty with Knight Arthur.
He pulls his left leg too far back and doesn’t bend his elbow enough. Harry tuts. Draco smiles to himself. There’s definitely something wrong with him.
too long, and it’s overwhelming as some semblance of order comes flooding back, stealing his breath away.
“Yeah, I am.” He said, before remembering about Harry’s eagerness about the nature surrounding the castle. What harm could it do if Harry saw his lake?
There’s a faint chiming echoing from another part of the castle. Draco listens, and it’s the twelve o’clock bell.
“Our hair.” Draco repeats, smirking. “It’d be fine if our hair was an ashy blonde but, unfortunately for us, platinum hair runs in the family,” He explains “It’d be fine for my mother, her being from the noble family of Black. Her hair is much darker, but for me and my father we have no such luck.”
“Not like she had a choice.” Draco said under his breath. He doesn’t really know what to say to the rest of that.
“Was that an apology?” Harry smirked, knowing that Draco could faintly see the outline of his face in the moonlight.
“Excuse me, everyone.” He says to the huddle, extracting himself and smiling at how easily he’d gotten away.
Harry’s hand that was on his cheek now moves up onto the side of his head. He’s pulling him in, kissing him slowly and passionately. It feels right, kissing him. He can’t believe he hasn’t been doing this all that time. “I’m sure their idea of friends includes lots of platonic snogging, huh?”
“There’s always a first for everything.” Harry laughs, shuffling down so that his legs weren’t intertwined with Draco’s anymore.
“I’ll make sure to secure the lock on Romeo’s stable door.” Harry says, laughing, with no note of nervousness at all.
Harry’s love is encompassing, a constant in Draco’s life of misfortune. The road ahead is uncertain, he can’t even begin to think about his future. The trips to Celeste’s castle, the wedding.
A small piece of paper flew out of the goblet, and Dumbledore caught it. He stopped in his tracks. And turned around to face the audience in the hall.
Everyone is starting to leave, bowing to where Lucius stands and clapping the winning man on the shoulder. Draco dashes past them, on a hunt for familiar back curls. He can’t find them, but he does find a head of striking ginger hair.
“Oh, sure it was. Well anyway, I was 16 and had just signed up to be a Knight and needed a place to stay that was close to Cadogen’s training area. Ron said that the flat above his workshop was free and if I could deal with his loud family then it’s mine. I’ve dealt with his loud family for a long time now, so it was a no brainer.” He shrugged, sending a humorous smile towards Ron.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco said, slightly taken aback, as Harry turned into the cobbled street. Draco quickly scuttled behind him, keeping his head held low and trying to keep his expensive clothes covered.
“But Adelaide, surely you can just pretend to be me and sit in our box.” Draco said, following Adelaide as she watered the extensive gardens. The weather was getting colder as it edged on into late September, and Adelaide was sure she could keep the red roses alive through the chill.
Harry’s body had gone numb. Why was Dumbledore saying his name? What was on the last piece of paper?
The second he wakes up, he’s got a splitting headache and his limbs are heavy and limp. He sits up too fast, and almost coughs his lungs out.
Harry opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He stared at Draco’s face, trying to read his emotions, but it was empty.
“Hey, Jules.” Draco whispers, even though he is the furthest away from the castle that he could get without passing through the large iron gates.
“Ah, of course. Your job is to lie around all day and be fed grapes by your maids.” Harry raises and eyebrow, teasing Draco.
There was a general sound of affirmations and Draco smiled pleasantly to himself. There’s a bustle of sound and Draco quickly takes off up the corridor already knowing he’s late but not really caring.
He shakes his head, as though trying to clear out any thoughts that are at the forefront of his mind.
“Never learn, boy. Eighteen years, still always moving out of place. Does not do well for my art, eh?”
“Yeah, though I’d rather not.” He huffs. “What I said and did was completely out of line. Bringing up Celeste and... you know what else.”
The thing he feels most of all is guilt and pity. Celeste wants him, she likes him. He doesn’t know if he’s making it better by trying to be loving or just making it worse for himself and his situation.
“I’ve got to go write this letter to Celeste, now. That was the main reason why I was on my way there in the first place. Peace and quiet.”
“I can’t do this anymore.” He admits into the open air. He doesn’t know if it means he can’t talk to Harry anymore, or if he can’t withhold his status and relationship with Celeste.
It was from Celeste. Of course it was. Draco skimmed his eyes over the neat writing and quickly tucked it into one of the pockets in his trousers. It was a heavy weight in his pocket, even though it was only one thin sheet of parchment.
“I guess we can share Adelaide as our honorary Mother.” Draco laughed faintly, trying to ease the tension in the room. It wasn’t bad tension, though. It felt sort of like a peaceful silence.
“Merlin you were running around like a headless chicken! Did you think I was going to punish you?” Draco laughed, something that came deep from his chest.
“Don’t clap at me, it’s all Draco’s!” His smile is lopsided and it’s obvious he’s taken a couple sips on his oh so long journey back.
Harry smiled for a couple of seconds, thinking about what he could do when he was out. He turned his head towards Draco, who had soft smile on his face.
Almost as if Harry’s reading his mind, he sheds Draco of them and throws them carelessly onto the floor.
The world seemed to stop as Draco felt release. His breathing quickened and that only surged him harder into the air. His black cloak flailed behind him and he felt freedom. Like he couldn’t be slowed. Nothing could stop him now. The wind whistled in his ears and his heart jolted against the movement of the run.
“Draco, I will only be able to help until you tell me what the matter is. I’m here for you.” She nods, sighing.
“I’m not risking my job, Draco. And I don’t want your execution to be my fault. Alright, the blacksmiths is just over there. Follow after me and act- normal. Well as normal as possible.”
“I was.” He says so softly that it comes out as a whisper. “I was happy.” He says again. “Me and Celeste had known each other for a long time, and at the start it felt like I was going to marry my best friend. I think I was just so young that I was blind to the real world and thought that I was sorted for life, you know?”
He’s passing the main part of the castle, the room opposite the entrance hall. It’s cleaner than it’s ever been, which should be impossible because it was immaculate before. He’s been careful not to touch things or move items around when as the castles been cleaned, and due to that he feels as he’s been locked up. Yesterday with Harry was a breath of fresh air, literally, and he’d only wish these next few days will be the same.
“Appreciate the easy work, Potter. Won’t be long until he starts asking you to braid his hair.” Draco smirked, diverting his gaze from the fire to Harry.
He stands on his tip-toes, and through the window, he can see the beautiful display of warmth from a happy family.
“You’ve sworn allegiance to my father.” Draco states, stabbing pains all over his body as the words leave his mouth.
“I’m sorry for shouting, Ada.” He whispers, blinking back tears. ‘Just suck it up, Draco’ He tells himself, and sits up on the bed.
“Draco, I don’t like the attention. In fact, I’m sure I hate it as much as you do. Well the attention focused on your personal life, not the attention focused on your demeanour.” Harry shrugged, playing with the fabric on his wrists.
There’s an orange glow coming from the front of the Swordsmith’s, and Draco jumps off Juliet so that he doesn’t make himself obvious.
“I’m trying to run from your Dad, he’s put me on a shift but I desperately need to pick up my sword for the tournament tomorrow.” Harry said, looking through the arches incase Lucius appeared.
It seems like no time at all has passed as the ball looms closer. The whole castle seems in a frenzy, and Draco can’t seem to rest for even a  minute.
Harry diverted his eyes as he realised that he was staring at Draco, watching as his delicate pale fingers slid across the worn pages of the book.
He took Draco’s hand and sighed. This was exactly where Harry wanted to be. Nothing could stop him, he had no worries. As long as Draco was beside him, he knew everything was going to be alright.
The wood-lined path opened up to an alleyway behind a tavern, and Harry held Draco back with a light hand to his chest, stopping him from walking any further.
Ron held out a hand to Draco and he grabbed it, uncomfortable in the contact. Hermione went around and helped Draco up. Ron pulled a face at Harry and he laughed. Draco pulled a face too.
And Harry had seen him weakened. Had seen him with red puffy eyes and messy hair. That’s what angered him. He didn’t like people seeing him defenceless. He wasn’t used to it. It was a force of nature that makes him push away people who  don’t mean any harm. Who would like to know Draco as Draco, and not a Prince.
“You’re pulling back to far, you see, and you’re letting go to fast. You want it to glide, not plonk.” He said in a reassuring tone, taking the impromptu lesson seriously.
Draco was just about to ask a question about the way he should position his feet before the sound of charging horses came his way. Through the thick group of trees, Draco could faintly see his father and a group of 5 other men, probably his most respected Knights, heading this way. The was a deer just a few feet in front of them, running for its life.
“Not until a bit.” Harry smirked. He bent down to pick another flat stone off the floor, passing it to Draco. “You try.”
When Draco wakes up the next morning, his eyes land on the pile of letters on his bureau. There’s a thick feeling in his throat, the dread of responding all too real.
Harry woke up in a cold sweat as soon as his nightmare ended. “Fuck.” He sighed, moving his dripping hair that was stuck on his face. When this normally happened, Harry would go for a shower and walk to the quidditch pitch. But that was how he got injured in the first place. And he couldn’t go now.
A castle in England. High turrets and towers. Secret alcoves. Fire-lit hallways. Dark grey stone. Rooms on rooms. Books on books. A 14 year old Draco Malfoy.
There’s a large crack of thunder, and the lightning illuminates the fear on Harry face. Draco looks outside, seeing a storm, and then looks back at Harry. He pieces it together immediately and goes to close the curtains, shutting away a blinding reminder of the weather outside.
Draco shook his head, trying to clear the message out of his mind so he could avoid the problem. If he thought about it one second longer, he might actually explode of panic. But it didn’t help when Harry came slowly walking in, shirtless with a towel covering his lower half. The image was ruined by Ron and Hermione standing on either side, touching Harry where Draco should be touching. But he hadn’t told Harry that. He hadn’t told Harry he wanted to hold him forever.
“You’ll be proud of yourself when the sky turns pink again.” Adelaide quotes from the top of her head.
“Oh, she’s not? Why don’t you go marry her then!” Harry smiles, and then it falters and turns into a pitiful grimace. “Sorry.”
“Fleur Delacour.” He announced. Harry had applauded and wiggled his eyebrows to Ron, much to Hermione’s dismay. He chuckled and turned back to Dumbledore.
“I can’t, sorry. It’s Arthur’s birthday. We’re going into the village and having a couple of drinks. Maybe tomorrow?” Harry’s casually leaning against the frame, and Draco’s doing everything he can to not reach out and touch the dip of his torso.
“You know what I mean.” He shoves Draco playfully, chuckling into his neck. His breath flutters against Draco’s collarbone and Draco shivers.
“Not even the slightest?” Harry pouts, making his eyes to wide and soft. What has Draco got himself into?
Betrothed. He thinks, playing with the fabric of his pure white dress shirt. He remembers being 14, remembers once staring in awe at the ring, staring in excitement. When you’re 14, everything seems like it will forever be permanent. You have your wife chosen for you, and you must love her forever. You’ll become King and Queen, and be content with your life. At 14, you don’t know yourself. You don’t know what you’ll be like in 4 years. You don’t know that you’re unhappy with your betrothment until it starts to eat away at you. But now it was 4 years later. Draco wasn’t unhappy, he loved Celeste, he told himself frequently. It was something he had to remind himself of.
“That, whenever you see a pink sky, know that you’ve survived just that little bit longer. And then you see it, again and again and again. And you know that there’s something worth fighting for.” She says, turning towards Draco and squeezing his elbow with a delicate hand.
“Draco!” Lucius shouts. It causes the remaining few left in the castle grounds to look in their direction, and Lucius has to wordlessly reprimand him, using his stern eyes to convey a message of ‘Get here now, and stop talking to those peasants.’
“What Hermione was saying, earlier.” Draco started, his sudden talking making him stop in his tracks.
Draco doesn’t pay attention though, as he sees Harry turn, and green eyes meet grey. Harry’s face is chiselled and tanned, and his teeth a bright white beam. His muscular arms fill out his cream dress shirt and as he stands up, he is a good 3 inches taller than Draco.
Harry continued his conversation with Ron and Hermione and got caught up on all his work and then they left to go to the library. Harry felt restless even after sleeping the whole day, but he couldn’t help but acknowledge that Malfoy was a couple metres away from him, softly breathing. Harry had never seen him this calm before.
“I’ve never been able to get my hands on these...” He starts, turning the book onto its side to look at the extensive family tree. “That’s my parents.” He points to two names on the tree. “James and Lily.” He follows the line across. “My mum had a sister, Petunia. And my grandparents on my dad’s side are... Fleamont and Euphemia.” He says, eyes flicking up to Draco’s excitedly. Draco smiles back.
“Who are you kidding? Never in a million years.  Harry would never want me. It’s stupid. I’m stupid.”
Harry walks Draco back to his rooms, and they part with a tight hug that’s far too long and far too close. Not that Draco minds.
He was sitting at his bed, his surroundings a faint blur. There was an angelic stream of light coming through the windows, and he felt like he was in the sky. He felt like he could fly forever. Draco sat at the end of Harry’s bed, his gaze drifting off to the side. Harry reached his hand out, trying to hold Draco’s hand. He touched it, and Draco looked up, his face blank. ‘Draco!’ Harry screamed as Draco began to fade away, and Harry couldn’t no longer feel his cold hand against his own warm one. The light became dark and stormy, and clouds formed all around him, suffocating him. Where Draco’s body was, a dark black cloak stood, in the shape of his body. Harry tried to move away, tried to reach for his wand but his hand went through his surroundings, and the cloak came closer. Harry felt like his body was clamped down. He couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see. Everything was black.
“And then this is Prince Draco’s study. As you can see this is Draco’s wing of the castle.” Sounds a voice outside Draco’s study two hours later from when he had first sat down. Draco recognised it as Adelaide’s, even though she sounded more nervous than ever.
“Sod off, Malfoy.” Harry rolled his eyes, taking it as a joke. Sometimes Hermione’s laugh became borderline scary.
Harry looked between Ron and Draco. He knew Draco was scared, and he knew that Draco won’t be able to run away. “You. Don’t you dare bloody look at Harry.” Ron pointed his wand at Draco, and stood right in front of where Harry was standing.
The weight of the water pushed down on his chest. He slipped calmly under the water, before hearing a clatter at the door, making him shoot up.
Draco arrived at the shop, glad he hadn’t been lost trying to get through the deepest part of the land. The streets were always alive, with thousands of carts selling things down the roads, dozens of shops containing all that one could need and forever bustling with people. It was hard to navigate where he was going.
“Morning.” Draco says, stretching sleepily on the bed, pressing his palms into his eyes. Harry must’ve left the Weasley’s shop early in the morning. The thought that he might have come back so soon just to see him makes his smile wider.
“Yeah, alright.” He concedes, giving Harry a detailed description of the directions to a secret alcohol store near the kitchens. Harry nods, giving Draco’s shoulder a squeeze. Even after he withdraws, Draco can feel the ghost of his hand.
He breathed quietly, listening to the silence of the hospital. He grabbed his wand and cast a lumos, getting out a book that Hermione left him. He would never normally read, but he got so bored and he knew that there was not point trying to move around.
Draco’s heart thrums and he picks up his speed, entering through the door and finding himself pushed against it once it’s closed.
“Why are you wearing it anyway? Aren’t you off duty?” Draco had decided to memorise Harry’s timetable, just so that he’d know when Harry was free to go to Lake James.
“I need my cloak.” He said, scooting around Harry and making his way to his bed chambers down the hallway.
He has a grand smile painted on his face, and he doesn’t even cover it when Adelaide turns up to open his curtains and get his stuff ready for the day.
Draco jumped on top of Juliet, pulled his cloak so that it covered his clothes, and made his way to the secret path that led to the beach.
“She’s so lovely. She’s honest and genuine, and I feel bad that I can’t return that. It feels awful.”
“Not how I’d thought it would be.” He starts, trying to find the words. “I remember her being jolly and sweet, and I’d thought that’d be different when we got older. But...she’s sort of like me.”
Draco couldn’t speak. All the words in his head were jumbled. He heaved in one last breath before it all come out again. His knees began to buckle underneath his frail body.
Harry catches his eye. “We’re just two troubled men with horrible love life’s.” He says so quietly that it’s almost a whisper.
Harry stared at Draco’s blank face, but was suddenly distracted by his rumbling stomach. He realised he hadn’t eaten anything at all since being in the infirmary.
Draco crashed into Harry’s side as h moved to catch up, and looked up to see Harry gazing at a photo of a woman. She had long, wavy black hair and eyes as blue as the sea. ‘As blue as a suffocating peacock’ Pierre would at. Underneath the painting, in curved gold script, said ‘Celeste Holloway’.
And now here he is, something to live for and a promise for something much more than the measly fate he’s destined for. Fate changes.
Draco didn’t realise Harry was talking, he was too caught up on that stare, no, more like gaze on his face. He didn’t seem to mind, though. Ever since their adventure yesterday, Draco feels comfortable in Harry’s presence.
“Draco, even if I may not understand, I will listen. And I will help as much as I can.” She smiles, rubbing his arm.
“Take your time.” She whispers, moving her hand from Draco’s side and into his soft hair, slowly pulling the strands through her nimble fingers.
“I have too many responsibilities to be caring about this, but it’s all I can think about, Ada. What’s wrong with me?” He cries.
“I ask myself the same thing, but it’s my Fathers doing. If anything it’s good. I like my privacy. Something you obviously don’t take into consideration.” Draco shrugs.
“Hey!” Harry shakes his head. Draco notices he has little dimples. And a light smattering of freckles. “You know you like my scruffs.”
“I don’t think that’s anyone else’s fault but your own.” Draco responds without sympathy. Some things you can just jump into without preparation, but ballroom dancing was not
Unfortunately for him, the business of the past couple of weeks has kept him from seeing Harry, and the only time they could communicate was when they passed each other in the corridors.
Harry’s eyes quickly darted off to the side to look at Draco crouched in the corner of the stone. He turned his attention back to Lucius and shook his head. “No, Sire.”
Harry woke up in a cold sweat that night. It was the same nightmare that had happened a couple of nights ago. But this time Draco wasn’t there. He couldn’t hold Harry.
Lucius always put on that front. A facade to make it seem as though his family was perfect and organised and happy. He put it on at feasts, at balls and in the presence of the public when making announcements. He did seem glad that famous Harry Potter was in his palace, though, but it was more to do with the fact that he was well respected in the town than the fact that he was a good Knight.
“Possibly, but you’ll never find out.” Draco said with a cheeky smirk, which never failed to make Harry’s heart flutter for no reason at all.
Draco just groaned and tried to think of ways to avoid the tournament. Perhaps he could accidentally choke on a piece of bread, or maybe Juliet accidentally flings him off the saddle, or perhaps when he’s...
“If you’d been a real man, maybe you would have actually become a knight. You wouldn’t put shame onto this family. Sometimes I wonder why I still keep you here. At your age, I was doing what’s right for the land and learning how to fend for myself. And what do
“Don’t you have work soon?” Draco asked, obviously wanted to accept but worried that he’ll just embarrass himself or they’ll run out of time after his many failed attempts.
“Boyfriends.” Draco affirmed. His breath hitched in his throat, but he knew he had to say it. “Maybe I am gay. Just a little. Only for you.”
Through the thick of the trees he can see knights on horses riding in. The armour glistening in the night light.
He wiped his tears and put on his emotionless mask. “Yeah.” He nodded turning back around to greet pansy.
He hides behind a wide oak tree, peering around and watching as the knights head towards the stables. He can’t see Harry in the group, no raven black hair or bright eyes.
Harry pulls his head back, considering, and Draco can see the cogs working in Harry’s brain, a warning sign for danger.
“Sir Potter is looking for you.” Adelaide quietly says, picking up Draco’s abandoned shoes from the floor.
Harry went into the great hall for dinner that night, and saw Draco immediately. His hair was tousled and rough and there were growing dark bags under his eyes. Harry thought that maybe Draco wasn’t getting any sleep either.
Draco is beyond angry. He never thought he could hate his father more, and yet here he is. He feels sick at the word ‘worthless’, being called that multiple time by the man himself and knowing how it felt. His father would never see anyone equal to him, he always had to be the best.
The ring gleams and glows, reflecting the flickering orange light of the taper candles surrounding him on the table.  The silver band was large, having a carved ‘M’ in the middle, surrounded by leaves and dragons.
He understood why Harry wanted to get to know him, and fine, maybe Draco wanted to know more about Harry. But Draco was scared. He doesn’t let people into his life that fast.
“He’s here! He’s really here! I’ve got to put something nicer on! I’ve got to impress him!” Adelaide said as she closed the door, safe from others hearing her swooning.
Ron desperately looked between Harry and Hermione. “Am I the only sane person to exist? Harry, why would you even want to help him in the first place? Hasn’t he tortured you enough?” Ron accusingly said.
“I’m sorry, too. This is my castle and I should be welcoming. It doesn’t mean I’m going to be nice to you, though.” Draco gave a weak smile.
Draco’s sheltered walls began to build up around him, but he takes a deep breath and makes himself speak. For his own sake. And Harry’s.
“Hey, there’s more horrible things to be bad at. If it makes you feel any better I couldn’t tie up my boot laces until I was thirteen.” Harry shrugs, though he acts like he’s proud of that fact.
Draco squints, and it’s unmistakably Harry. Draco curses to himself, grabbing his dropped items so he can run back up, but before he’s able to step a foot back, Harry has noticed him.
“Don’t call him stupid, Draco. You said you were ‘friends’ now. And anyway, Sir Potter is very interesting. His stories are fascinating.”
“God, Draco...” Harry says, lips planting kisses over the flat plane of his naked body. Draco removes his hands from the chains and rakes them through Harry’s hair, grabbing onto the curls at the base of his head, lightly urging him closer.
Draco groaned into his pillow. He absolutely dreaded having his portrait done. He’s had to have one every year of his life for as long as he remembers, and he still wasn’t used to the numbing pain of sitting on a wooden stool for hours.
“Speak of the devil.” Harry grins, and Adelaide laughs. The smile drops as soon as she takes sight of Draco’s hair.
He’s been tossing and turning all night, and the sound of festivities coming all the way from the village doesn’t help.
Ron froze and turned. “What the FUCK do you think you’re doing. I don’t even want to start with you.” Ron walked up to where Malfoy lay and picked up a fist. But before he could even swing back, Hermione had put a stupefy on him and he fell to the floor.
“Fine, fine.” Harry sighed with humour. He glanced at Draco for a couple of seconds, before finding words to say.
“Ah, Draco- I just wanted to- You said that I could use the library and I got bored, I can go, it’s fine. Here’s your book and- Oh Merlin I’m so sorry.” Harry rushed out on one breath, scrambling around the area in-front of the hearth.
“That wasn’t what I was expecting, though. I thought you would have told me about a maiden who you dated when you were fifteen that broke up with you over letter.”
“Around once every two weeks I’ll have to go to Celeste’s palace attending events and spending time with her.”
Later that day when the sun began to set, Harry followed Ron out to the Quidditch grounds. They try and do as many practical turns and tricks as possible but it always ends up with them playing a one on one seeker game. With Harry being the obvious winner.
Ron and Hermione came to visit not so long after Harry and Draco were confronted by Snape. He was glad that Snape had taken house points off of Slytherin as well as Gryffindor, because Draco deserved it. He deserved it after his reaction. Harry couldn’t tell what he really thought about it though, he just seemed to be in shock.
“Maybe but I...” He coughs again. “I think it was...” Another cough. “Harry pushed me into the water.” He finally wheezes out.
Cleaning charms didn’t work on Harry anymore. Every time he used one, it proved useless. It was the first time in his life that he had been wanting to have a shower. His ribs still seemed to be damaged, even after taking so much medication. His concussion had been healed and his vision was back to normal in no time. Well, as normal as it could get. Even if Harry’s ribs had miraculously healed themselves, he thinks that if he were to stand up he would have forgotten how to walk.
There was obviously things that Draco didn’t know about all three of them. There was still so much he had yet to learn about Harry as well.
From the corner of his eye, he can see Celeste’s ring glimmering proudly on her hand. Looking at his own has been unbearable recently, but he always knows it’s there.
“Thank you, Miss Granger. Although Mr Weasley seemed to have a different opinion on me when I first arrived here.”
And in the end, Harry was wrong. Draco was far too many sheets to the wind, and was now stuck with the troubles of having to gather himself and going to get his clothes fitted.
“I wrote it.” He says embarrassingly, feeling his face grow hot. “But!” He adds, “You cannot read it now, it’s nowhere near finished. That’s hardly a first draft.”
“Wow.” Was all that Harry could say, making his way to a row of at least 300 different portraits. Draco’s family history was all over these walls. Most of the people were smiling, if not sneering, in the paintings. They generally all looked like different people, but if you looked at their noses there was a familiar sharpness to it that had been passed down. There were all different sizes of paintings, the larger ones being the male Malfoy heir and the smaller ones underneath that his wife and children, who then carried on the chain. The portraits right at the start of the line dated back to centuries ago, judging by their clothing. All do them were painted to perfection, capturing everything that went on, onto the canvas.
‘I am counting down the 4 years until your arrival, but until then, I hope you keep our betrothment ring by your side. It is a great shame of your distance from the Malfoy castle, but I am not to fret for too long.’ He writes, fiddling and twisting the silver ring around his finger.
It’s nothing like the desperation of last night. He can feel the hairs on the back of his neck rise, not from coldness this time, and truly drinks in Harry like this.
“I honestly just needed a new sword wielded for a tournament coming up, and then Draco came along. He’s cooped up in there, you know.” Harry shrugs with exasperation.
Adelaide just smiled at Draco with knowing, although there wasn’t really anything that could be known. Draco was acting normal. Yeah, definitely.
“They’ll be at the breakfast table.” Adelaide smiles with a grimace, sorting through the items dotted around in Draco’s private bathroom. She had comforted Draco as much as he could in his troubles, but there wasn’t much she could do to change Draco’s fate. She’s trying though, and Draco would never refuse the comforting reassurance that Adelaide has and will always present to him.
Draco manoeuvres a heavy Harry onto his large bed and pushed him lightly so that he can lie on his back.
“Fine, but I know that it had something to do with me.” Harry playfully said, knowing he was getting on Malfoy’s nerves.
“I don’t find you funny.” He says as seriously as he can muster, but finding it rather hard, seeing as he’s almost naked.
“A nice person? Hermione? Are you forgetting who we’re talking about here? It’s Malfoy! He’s a- He’s a prat!” Ron exclaimed, and both Hermione and Harry rolled their eyes.
“No mistress right now, actually. I supposed that being able to have time away at this castle would give me time to think.” Harry laughs.
“I don’t understand why they don’t just bring up food from the great hall instead of having gross food that one of the infirmary kitchen elves make.” Harry explained, while using his fork to pick around the odd looking colours in his chicken.
The dark green fabric is pulled halfway down his thighs, along with the underwear worn underneath. Harry’s taking in the sight of him, all of him, and he feels as though he should be embarrassed but he’s far from. It was hard to feel anything but want.
“No, no. I insist. Go on then, you have a castle to be protecting.” Draco smiles and nods politely, turning back towards the castle.
“Thanks. I’ll see you later.” And with that, he turned to go to his study. His heart was beating, his head was sweaty and he could quite literally eat a horse.
“Well yes, I know that.” Draco rolls his eyes. “But what are you doing at the castle? Surely you have other plans.”
Draco sighs and tries again, but like everything else that happens in his life, it doesn’t go the way he wants and the stone sinks depressingly.
“Do you want me to stop?” Harry asks, his face growing disappointed, deepening when he looks back down to Draco’s cock.
Harry doesn’t seem to be paying attention to his rambling, only keeping his focus on the clothes that Draco is neatly folding or putting on.
“Oh yes, of course, I hadn’t mentioned. I am feeling slightly flustered to be honest... well anyway,” She said, smiling, her hand twisting excitedly through her dark blonde hair. “Your mother and father want to talk to you, my guess is about Sir Harry’s arrival. It should give you an answer to your questions. I haven’t heard much, though, he only arrived 15 minutes ago. Do tell me what the King and Queen say. They’re in the solar room. Would you like me to prepare you tea when you get back? I am sure you have a lot of letters for Celeste to be writing.” She nodded in question.
“Potter, this is my library. My room is three steps down the corridor.” He waved his hand, exasperated.
He trusted him for the shortest amount of time, but in that period that was the only thing he needed trust in. He needed Draco’s trust. He had it, but Draco didn’t have Harry’s.
“I know, I know. Breathe with me.” He says, doing what Adelaide normally does when Draco’s finds himself not able to breathe while crying.
Harry looked at where Draco was sitting, a heavy book in his lap. Harry saw that it was the same book he was reading last night. Harry softly smiled and got an elf to get his and Draco’s dinner.
“I don’t need you mucking up this evening, young man.” She says sternly. “Sit down and let me fix it. Harry, don’t you have somewhere to be?”
Harry just smiled, but the smile was gone when he saw that Draco had left from his seat and headed back to the school.
“What? Don’t think I understand having to keep quiet? Being watched under scrutiny by the kingdom?” Harry raised his voice slightly, turning his body towards Draco.
“Your family goes back thousands of years.” Harry said, looking at a particularly scornful photo of what Draco read as his great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather.
“Well of course it is, I’ve been at the castle 24/7 for the past two weeks or so, how do you expect me to come home and clean?”
“Any reason? I doubt Pierre would let me go until he’s finished.” Draco gestured towards the paints that sat on a table.
And Draco does, letting tree branches thwack them and tossing his head back in the wind. Harry loses his grip on the saddle, and ends up with his hands firmly placed on Draco’s hips. Draco woops and Harry barks with laughter.
Draco doesn’t say anything, just smiles at Harry from the bed and admiring the way he’s leaning against the door frame.
Draco scowls and Harry laughs, shoving Draco off the swing. He helps him gather the cape that has somehow made its way to the floor.
“I’m not sure I’m going to get any more free time, my father wants to do a speech and from then on it’ll be lots of conversations with people I don’t know...”
see him. It’s a bit surreal, seeing the person he’s been sending letters to for the past nine years.
Draco shoots Harry a very stern glare. “Oh come on, Draco. Loosen up a little!” He laughs. Draco kicks water into his face.
Draco stands up, appalled. He’s not particularly a fan of being reduced down to something for the purpose of being a bit of fun for Harry.
“Fucking hell.” Harry says, running his finger over the faces on the portrait. James and Lily are positioned close together on the picture, their faces beaming at the painter. Draco can work out a Harry’s green eyes from Lily’s and a sharp, strong face from James’.
letting go when his father announces that the winter ball is coming to a close and that they’ll play the final song.
“Doesn’t have to be soon.” Harry says reassuringly, sliding a hand under Draco’s jaw and moving his head up, capturing his lips
Harry read a couple chapters, but was distracted at Draco’s soft breathing as he lay there. Harry closed the book and looked up at the ceiling too. He wanted to see what Draco was looking at, but saw nothing apart from worn bricks. He then realised that Draco was probably lost in thought, and wasn’t too focused on the old pieces of rock.
Draco is so relieved that Celeste isn’t staying the night, and that instead she’s going back home with her mother and father.
Some are smiling at him, impressed. Some are whispering to each other, nodding in his direction and not seeming as though they utterly hate his guts. He supposes he should have tried to be nice since the beginning, but it’s not too late to start.
“Don’t you think your a bit old, Adelaide?” Draco laughed, slightly sighing in relief as there was nothing to be worried about.
“Focus on your feet before focusing on my face, Harry. I need to preserve my toes for the ball.” Draco says, stepping backwards. Harry’s face drops at the sudden loss of touch but it quickly livens again as he realises it’s the start of the dance. When Draco turns to look at Harry, he can see a pink flush rising under the fabric of his tunic. Draco circles around, Harry turning with him. Their forearms are held mere inches from each other, Harry stumbling slightly as Draco turns the other way, trying to understand how many times he should circle around.
“Merry Christmas, Draco!” She says with alacrity, coming to his bedside and shaking him. Adelaide has always loved Christmas.
“I don’t know to be honest. I just- when I get attention from girls. I don’t like it. And I never really understood it. Then I saw Sirius and Remus together, and I felt like that was the answer. That’s what I wanted in life. I didn’t want to hug or kiss a girl, and it was because I liked boys.”
The distance between them had stayed, and neither of them tried to move. Harry lost hope. He wanted to stand up and kiss Draco and tell him he loves him. But Draco didn’t move. He sat, reading the book, occasionally flipping the pages.His body was fragile as it lay vulnerable on the bed.
“I mean...you looked pretty sick. I’d just come out of- of your room, and you quite literally collapsed on Adelaide. She told me you needed the medicine so I went and got it.” He says sheepishly.
Draco immediately knows who it is, and though he’s not angry at him, he feels as though his own subconscious is trying to push him away from Harry. Whether that’s a good thing for him or not, he doesn’t know.
The sound of the waves immediately washed Draco over with a sense of peace, and he made his way down further, the floor turning from dirt to sand.
‘Well, why don’t you bloody take him in as your son.’ Draco thinks in his head, tempted to say it out loud but only releasing a small sigh in its place.
“Ah...fuck, Harry.” He whispers into his ear, breath catching. Harry speeds up, his naked form somehow perfect whatever he’s doing. Through the haze of bliss, he’s aware of the stark difference between his pale body and Harry’s tanned one. His slim body below Harry’s athletic one. The dark, unruly hair that’s splayed across his chest as Harry licks a hot stripe up his neck and nuzzles at a sensitive point under Draco’s ear.
He could now feel his friends prodding him on the back, pushing him forward. But that wasn’t his biggest problem right now.
“Harry?” Draco asked, wondering why Harry was on the complete opposite side of the castle than normal.
“It’s fine, Harry. Sorry.” Draco said reluctantly, but his face showed that what he said was heartfelt.
He’s afraid that somehow, if he lets Harry out of his sight for more than a second, something horrible might happen. Draco spends a lot of the time gnawing at his nails, surges of worry apropos to nothing.
