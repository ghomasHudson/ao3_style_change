Draco squinted his eyes at the twins, not quite believing but his heart at ease when he heard it. “Are you sure?”
Potter softly chuckled, “You too, Sweetheart. Now, go!”
Draco gaped.
"Alright, let's stop," said Harry, deciding to put a stop on his teasing seeing the pouting that was set on his little husband's face which he was sure the younger man did not even realise. "Go change into your pyjamas, it's late already. We need to rest."
Harry tempted to ask but he knows better;
Harry immediately snapped his eyes away from the twins to look at Malfoy’s determined face.
"Figured so." said Draco, rolling his eyes in mild annoyance before he gave Harry a rather dramatic sigh. "Well then, since you were practically begging."
They obediently move, sending each other a mixed look; where Zabini, Parkinson, and Ginny were amused, Hermione and Ron looked rather bemused by the situation and Harry doesn't know what to feel.
"There you are." said Harry.
Now, that was exactly what Harry would like to hear. He carved a satisfied grin; widened when Henry rolled his eyes.
“By using what, ‘Mione?” asked Ron and Hermione coughed into her fist, “I forgot.”
“I mean- you're practically left alone with a stranger-"
Draco gaped in disbelief before he scoffed, lifting a hand to rub his cheek, as if he could put off the redness that was painted on his skin. "Don't be ridiculous, and stop saying nonsense!"
"I don't cuddle."
"Did too." smiled Harry. "Tell you what, if we cuddle, I'll tell you how we met."
Their interactions were something he almost looked forward to everyday. Key word:
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "I'm alive, as you can see- what are you doing here, Potter?"
Harry suddenly felt like something twisted in his chest, it felt like a disappointment. From the moment the twins have spoken to him, he has already been adjusting the idea that the twins might really be his children in the future. Doesn't matter that Malfoy might be his future husband, it was all in the future after all. But now, seeing the evidence with his own two eyes that this man was clearly not the older version of him, he felt like someone just splashed a bucket of cold water to his face. Waking him up from his daydream.
Albus picked up the old robe with the Slytherin crest and nodded, “Here.”
Malfoy stopped dead on this track, gaping as Henry laughed aloud. Zabini, Parkinson and Ginny follow his action - even Hermione cracked an amused smile while Ron looks mortified.
“Are you sure?” asked Ron, taking a spot behind his girlfriend. “Did Malfoy say something to you?”
“Blimey, these kids are dangerous!” stated Ron.
“Hello, Draco.” greeted Henry, smiling gently.
A sigh.
Draco didn't dare to give any assumption.
“So,” said Potter, as he drummed his fingers on Draco’s thigh. “How's your crush been going so far?”
Harry followed Henry's trail with a surge of excitement and a new sudden burst of energy. He doesn't know what kind of help Henry was talking about, but if they were involved with a half naked Malfoy, then why the hell not.
Draco laughed, as he halted on his step and jolted his shoulder on where Harry had put his head on. "This is me."
“Nothing.” Henry quickly waved him dismissively, “You, young people won't understand.”
“Merlin, you're such a vulgar. I can't believe I'm going to marry you!” Draco blurted out, slapping his mouth when he realised his chosen words. Henry, bless his heart, only gives Draco a coy smile.
"Thank you." said Harry, pulling a chair and sorting himself before he squirmed around, uncomfortable. He looked up when he heard a chuckle from McGonagall.
“I'll have you know, you look so fucking hot like that.”
“Don't you remember, I said I'll stop once-"
“Was that why Scorpius said that your blood was special?” Potter jumped in.
There was dead silence as everyone turned their eyes on him. The twins seemed to communicate to each other with their eyes when Albus looked at him dead in the eye, “If you think we're your sons, Mr. Harry Potter, You're dead wrong.”
“He's a wizard, and you're okay with it?”
“You know I do.”
Oh, doesn't he know the drill already.
“Well, at least he's good looking.” Zabini nodded in approval. Malfoy scoffed.
Harry nodded, "I have to get him before that then."
Malfoy heaved a deep sigh move to stand in between the two of them. He propped his hands on his waist, sending both Henry and Harry a warning look. "Rule number one: if one picked a fight, the other must not fight back."
“We-"
Harry pressed a grin when Malfoy's glassy eyes turned sharp as his eyes widened in alarm.
Harry knew something went wrong when the moment the front gate of the Palace was opened, there was no sight of the two warriors greeting them from the other side of the gate.
His heart felt at peace somehow, once he understood the feelings he had towards Malfoy. It was bizarre indeed, having a crush on Draco Malfoy of all people. Nevertheless, at the same time, it felt as if a complex puzzle has just solved; indeed, some took days to put each pieces together, sometimes it took months and in Harry's case, it took them for about seven years, going through a war even, though they have fought in different sides but they have managed to survive and it was time for them to start a new beginning and knowing his feelings was reciprocate, Harry can't wait to explore this feelings with Malfoy.
He has survived the war, of course he can survive minor injuries.
He frowned at the foreign feelings creeping through his chest, has been from the moment he had heard about the whole situation, and quickened his pace when he remembered that the sole reason why he was out of his bed freezing his arse off was the only current resident of the Hospital Wing.
"Pardon?" Malfoy raised an eyebrow, gazing down at him with a dry look.
“Let's greet him!” Albus had already climbed down his seat before Scorpius could stop him. He promptly followed, almost falling down his face when he clambered to the floor and chased down his brother.
“You've got to admit that you're impressed with us, Dad.” said Scorpius easily, giving them a bright smile.
He saw from the corner of his eye as Malfoy shifted in his spot with an unreadable look on his face. “How should I know, Pans. I've never met him, remember?”
) have accused Malfoy that it was just his plan to steal Harry's cloak-
Harry nodded, agreed. Of course McGonagall will make sure of that first.
"I don't see why that was a problem?"
Draco shook his head, and slowly moved to the other side of the bed as Harry climbed in, and they worked together to peeled the quilt silently, putting over the warm material over their bodies and they lay down side by side, looking at the ceiling. It was a nice night, and Harry felt content to have Draco by his side. A reminder that being here was a definite chance that he could save Draco’s life. He knew that this time, he could make it happen.
“Well, you may never know.” Hermione crossed her arms.
Harry suppressed an incoming smile, just looking at his stance alone showed him that Draco was annoyed at him. "I was only gone for a few minutes, though." he shrugged, and carved a playful smile as he continued, "Why, did you miss me?"
"Older dad, younger dad." said Albus.
"Then let go of me." growled Malfoy.
"I feel better now. Thank you, and uh, I'm sorry for you know, that."
They continue to give each other remarks but Harry’s attention was not on them anymore. He threw his sight to where he looked before; where Hermione, Malfoy and the twins sat together, huddling close with the Book of Old Curses in between them.
Harry gave a light laugh; proud and resigned at the same time.
And ran.
Just earlier, Headmistress McGonagall has quickly brought them to her office after the commotion at the Great Hall. And right now, he suddenly felt light headed with all the information he received.
The twins grinned at Ginny delightfully.
Henry only let out soft chuckles. “Again, I'm sorry but I really do need you to strip.”
Malfoy and Harry stared at him incredulously.
They looked at Potter in unison, managed to draw an amused smile from the man. “We need to read more about Time Travel, I guess.” He shrugged.
“Now,” Malfoy began, taking a deep breath as he proceeded, “Everyone, meet my sons; Albus Severus and Scorpius Hyperion. They traveled back in time in order to save me.”
“I'm pretty sure you won't be here if you were not Harry Potter's sons.” McGonagall pointed out, and Albus broke into a fit of giggles that got a smile from Scorpius.
"And I you," said Draco.
Potter shook his head, “Nothing. You’re going to stay here with the kids?”
Harry laughed, heart filled with fondness of this sweet creature who was currently sending daggers at his direction. Merlin, he couldn't believe this was the same person who wouldn't stop tormenting Harry every chance he got with his art of seduction, driving Harry into madness and leaving them both a huge mess by the time they were sated and exhausted. It was like learning a whole new personality of his husband, as the Draco he knew by the time they met again, was a confident Draco who did not bat an eye over any sexual innuendos. It was like falling in love all over again.
"Blimey!" cursed Seamus, before he turned to Harry again. "Well, fix it because Pansy won't talk to me otherwise!"
It was just a crush, after all.
“Of course he's alive,” Scorpius giggled despite the remark, “Papa was just sick, he's not dead yet!”
Draco narrowed his eyes and haughtily sniffed, “I have nothing to say but to agree. I'm trying to convert him, you see. Though, I am not sure how that's been going.”
Henry curved a mysterious smile, stepping closer to Malfoy and whispered something to his ear - something private that managed to make Malfoy flustered, red from his face to his ears.
Harry thought the mysterious packaging they have received yesterday must've been involved with this sudden change of events.
Leo was a reserved person; collective, calm, compassionate, kind hearted, and a great friend that sometimes Harry questioned the universe how a wonderful person like Leo had Malfoy for a twin brother, because Malfoy-
Harry bit his lips unconsciously as he continued to observe the twins; horrendous matching hair in black and white-blond, green and grey eyes, and their dad was a Gryffindor.
Harry looked into the pair of grey eyes desperately, afraid that it was going to be his last moments seeing those eyes looking back at him. The pair of eyes that always filled with devotion and love, the pair of eyes that were currently stare at him with calmness despite the cataclysm that was surrounding them at the moment.
That got a laugh from Draco and Merlin, wasn't he beautiful?
“What?” Draco breathed, he doesn't think he can't function quite well after Potter cutting all his functioning wires with his words.
“Albus, that's enough!” said Malfoy firmly, a hand on his temple as he closed his eyes with clear exasperation. “Alright, I need everybody to sit in a circle.” He instructed all of a sudden.
"Dragon," said Leo softly, voice controlled as he gathered himself carefully. "You're the only person who can perform this role with perfection."
“10?!”
“He won't stop crying!” She gestures. “We tried everything, but he won't budge!”
Harry took a shaky breath at that, pushing the image of a pale face Draco with sunken cheeks away from his mind. "He was bedridden. The curse literally took his magic, his energy, his ability to function. It was fine for the first year, he can still perform easy spells even though he couldn't walk anymore. But nowadays, he can't even open his eyes without exhausting his body." said Harry, wiping tears that suddenly gathered around his eyes. "He- he couldn't eat, he couldn't even do anything anymore. I was- I was ready to give up, the Healer said that there was nothing to be done anymore, his body has give up and it was only matter of time before- before he- I should've been better, I should've paid more attention to him, I should've put more effort, I should've-"
Draco was impressed, as he understood now how these two boys managed to come this far. Scorpius was the one who searched for information; in other word, the brain in this plan of theirs, and Draco was sure that Albus was the type who dive head first the moment they knew they had come up with a solution. He must be the one who anchored Scorpius into action.
"I've warned you." said Malfoy, "And I'll do worse if you didn't move your hands right on this instant."
Draco sharply stared at the two boys. If earlier he felt as if the air sucked out of his lungs, right now he can't seem to breathe. As if it was an impossible thing to do.
“Papa’s old books?”
Even if it was actually Potter, what exactly was his agenda by sending all the articles?
“Potter?”
Harry saw him give his brother a knowing look, a look that didn't sit well in his stomach. Worsen when Albus blinked, and twisted his face in a grimace as if something just occurred to him.
He felt Granger’s hand on his face in an instant, wiping the tears that seemed to gather on his eyes. No wonder everything was blurry.
And he was loved.
“You're meant to say that since they did the ritual with three of your things from this time, they need to have three things from the future to send them back?”
Because if he was, then the universe played him a big joke. Harry Potter was the last person Draco wanted to associate with, even if the Saviour of the Wizarding World managed to save his life twice. He was doing his very best to avoid the Saviour’s cronies since the term has started, let alone Potter himself. He watched anxiously as his sons shared a long look when Albus suddenly pfft-ed while waving his hand in a dismissive manner.
“Right,” He clasped his hands together and and forced a smile, “Looks like we have no choice but to ask Harry Potter for help.”
“Let's go, Dray!”
“You took so long to get the drinks, I had to check up on you!” protested Potter.
Potter curled his lips upwards. “Maybe not tonight.”
By this point, if another Dark Lord came and straight out killed Harry on the spot, he would be glad to let them so.
“That's because you did nothing.” Albus shot back, mirroring his brother's action unconsciously.
It took a moment of embarrassment for Harry when Malfoy finally reacted. “You're... worried about me?”
“Dra- Draco.” Pansy suddenly slapped his knee rapidly, and he stopped to see that everyone had frozen as they stared dumbfounded at Draco’s back, even Blaise had woken up from his nap. That was when Draco realised of the shadow looming behind him. He quickly turned around and looked up to see a man; possessing the most unimpressed look Draco ever saw as the man crossed his arms, raising an eyebrow at him - no, not at him but at his twins.
Henry sheepishly smiled, a sudden pink colouring his cheek lightly. Harry narrowed his eyes.
"Like I said, I just want to see your condition. I might not be able to if I waited for tomorrow." Harry easily shrugged.
A man who will give him two wonderful children, who were risking their life by travelling back in time to save his life.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “What for?”
He saw curious eyes watch his movement, and he ignored them, as he took a purpose stride straight towards oblivious Malfoy, heartbeat increasing as he got closer and gave Malfoy's friends a thankful smile as they kept talking to him as if nothing was happening, and saw as Pansy urged him to drink, taking his food away in the process. Despite the mild protest, Malfoy did as told, unaware of Harry who had stood right behind Malfoy, and the whispers that erupted around them. Pansy gave a nod when Malfoy put down his cup, and with a sudden force of bravery, Harry tapped Malfoy's shoulder twice.
“Yea?”
"Not like that, you brute!"
"Malfoy came to me this morning and accused me of telling the truth!" exclaimed Seamus. "How did you know?"
Draco found himself walking into a dark alley, eyes dropped onto the pair in an instant just in time to see them leaning to each other intimately with desire painted on both of their faces. Draco smirked, extending his left hand to his front and silently summoned his golden bow, right hand already holding an arrow.
“When did you learn how to fight like that?”
He was satisfied when Draco flushed even more, his face went alarmingly red. His little husband's eyes were wide as saucers, as he looked at Harry with stupefaction, clearly surprised by Harry's words. "You're- you're shameless!"
Draco smiled at her in thankfulness and received a smile in return. He suddenly felt a set of eyes watching him so he lifted his eyes to meet a calculating green eyes. He raised an eyebrow in question which was answered by a set of shrugged and smiled.
Draco swallowed, willing himself to calm down when the sudden words made him feel agitated. “I'm ready.”
He dragged his unfocused eyes to Henry, and the brain slowly interpreted Henry's instruction. “Undress?”
He didn't have a crush on Malfoy, was he?
"Albus and Scorpius had told me about it." said Draco softly, and Harry was glad that he just said the right words.
It was something, but it was not what Harry wanted. He wanted more.
He fell asleep like that, just thinking.
But he also doesn't know how to stop.
Harry instantly recalls the hysterical sobs of the first year, and he was stunned. “What?”
Draco laughed, delighted. “Stop giving me hope, Love. You're going to kill me.”
"Well, what do you expect, Harry?" McGonagall raised an eyebrow, amused. "They're your sons, after all."
"Oh, my little Cupid." chuckled Harry, dragging a single finger across Draco’s cheek with a butterfly touch. "I'm not going to kill you."
"What?"
Harry slowly put the piece of old parchment away, unaware of another two sets of names were making their way towards the Hospital Wing as he rubbed his tired eyes. It can't be, Malfoy can't be the one who has been stealing kisses from him, was he?
Harry heard the chaos before he heard Ron's exclamation. He followed Ron's line of sight along with the rest of the student to see Headmistress McGonagall strived into the Great Hall with two little boys on her tail, watching their surroundings with great interest.
Harry couldn't help the smile that was growing upon his face. He made a drastic decision and extended an arm towards Draco. "Let's cuddle."
Albus nodded eagerly, while Scorpius frowned as he patted his body around for something. He brightened when he found it, and pulled it out from his trousers’ pockets.
“You lot can go now.” Henry shooed, gesturing to the rest of them to evacuate the room.
“Well,” began Harry, hugging the small pillow that he snatched from the sofa. “I know that he was a male since the first time he kissed me - I heard him. Also, he smelled so nice and his hands were really soft.” He grinned, as he recalled those hands on him, sobered when his friends stared at him with a blank look and he immediately added, “I think I can say that he was a powerful wizard too, not everyone can cast a perfect Disillusionment Charm after all.”
Harry's eyes turned slit in an instant. “Just for the night, yes he is.”
Harry replied by pulling Malfoy much closer, now aware of the position they were in and he can't help but grinned, pleased by the situation. Malfoy looked like a damsel in distress, leaning backwards with Harry as his sole source of balance. If Harry let go, Malfoy would surely fall onto his arse. That thought made him chuckle, and Malfoy's face twisted in confusion adorably.
“I suppose so.” Harry imitated his action, nodding as he eyed his friends. “Are you okay with me kissing a bloke?”
Draco’s eyes widen with smug mischief as he steals a kiss from Harry. “I have my own way.”
The twins nodded their heads simultaneously, giving him a big bright smile. Draco promptly choked into nothing.
"I can practically know what you're thinking," said Harry, chuckling.
He went and took a shower when the first spek of sunlight showed itself. By the time he was dressed in his uniform, his friends just woke up.
Harry stopped dead in his tracks, mouth agape as he stared at the scene in front of him in disbelief. Malfoy was half naked, pale skin on display sprawling on top of Henry in a very compromised position. It was the sight of Draco and Henry lip locking that got Harry to move as he marched at the two men hastily, heart twisting with a foreign feelings as he took a grip on Draco’s bicep, and yanked him backwards making the white-blond haired collided to his chest.
With a final kiss that was dropped on his forehead lovingly, his culprit took his leave, but not before he made sure that Harry was in a comfortable state by tucking his blanket up to his body.
As much it was a shocked to hear Hermione has used the word ‘sex’, she was right. Malfoy and Parkinson would be around the twins’ age if they- better not think about it.
He softly cast Alohomora when he arrived in front of the Hospital Wing, carefully sneaking in and winced when the heavy door made a creaky sound. He looked around the place once he was in, just to take in the sights of it. He knew that Madam Promfey was probably somewhere in her quarter, dead asleep now that there won't be another set of students who will interrupt her sleep.
“What?” asked Potter, curling his lips upwards.
“Stop looking at me like that!” whispered Draco harshly.
“Wait, are you sure those books were the one papa used in his 8th year?”
Harry watched in alarm as Malfoy smiled fondly to his boys. “That's really good! Now let me handle it, okay?”
“Shut up.” Harry hissed at the older man, annoyed with the smug face that was presented to him.
The twins then grinned mischievously.
Silence.
He tried to bribe a group of young Slytherins to tell him what got Malfoy busy but other than losing ten galleons for the information, he received nothing but chocolates. A small box of chocolates in fact. He brought the box over to the Gryffindor table on dinner, handed them to the hungry hyenas of his friends as he watched with narrowed eyes as the group of young traitors of Slytherins were apparently talking to Malfoy. No doubts reporting to the white-blond haired of the situation. His suspicion proved when Malfoy glanced over to their table, sought Harry's eyes with both confusion and amusement written on his face that got Harry to pinched His lips together. Embarrassed that his scheme was caught red handed, he moved his attention elsewhere and started to talk with Ron. When he looked up to the Slytherin table again, he was pleased to see a soft smile carved on Malfoy's face.
Potter hummed, biting his lips as he tried to keep the smirk away. “It's been almost a year, from what I've heard about. Is it true?”
"I thought rule number one was 'no groping in public'?" said Henry out of nowhere.
"Don't touch me!" Harry swatted the older man's hand as soon as they were out within Malfoy's hearing range.
He has found him, obviously, has planned everything even. It was the execution that became his problem since his target was apparently busy with his house's agenda.
“I'm so flattered.” Draco rolled his eyes, adjusting his grip on the tray. Potter laughed next to him as they walked back to their booth. Potter suddenly hummed, something that suggested he was about to say something rather ridiculous knowing how eloquent the man can be sometimes.
During free time, he set on making himself busy by studying with Hermione at the library, of course dragging Ron along with him - much to the other man's chagrin.
“Oh. Then, thank you for having a crush on me.”
"Papa, how come you didn't ask who dad is?”
“He doesn't look like Harry though.” Ron commented suddenly and they simultaneously turned to him in disbelief - Malfoy looked horrified. “What, I know all of you were thinking the same thing.”
“Nonsense!” Henry laughed, swinging a hand over Malfoy’s shoulder and dragging him towards them. “He's my husband - well, not yet but there's no harm flirting with your own husband. You boys are just jealous.”
"If you pushed me away one more time, I'm going berserk." said Harry instead.
He unconsciously lifted his head to chase the soft lips when they were apart, but a hand on his chest prevented him from doing so. He frowned, and cracked his eyes open to catch his culprit only to see that no one was even there except for a small heart shaped chocolate that had fallen down into the ground when he moved to stand up.
Perhaps Malfoy was the one who missed the point because despite everything, there was a reason why they picked Draco Malfoy instead of Leo Malfoy. And as much as he hated it, no matter how much he protested the idea; deep down, he perfectly knew why Malfoy fit the role better.
"Harry." warned Hermione and Leo.
Draco unconsciously swallows.
"We found him!" yelled Ginny in excitement, eyes went glassy with tears.
“Malfoy, talk to me. What's wrong?”
"That's right," nodded Ron. "Can't walk around as you wish when there were crazy people invading your house."
He received a brilliant smile from Henry. “That's my sweetheart.” The older man released Draco’s face as he stepped back, pulling out his wand from his back pocket and Draco took a deep breath as Henry pointed the wand at him. “I'll start from your right toe, followed by the left, both of your calves and up till your fingertips.”
“Most people, yeah! But if you wanna go shag Malfoy, then be my guest, since you’re such a slag for it apparently.” Ron looked just as shocked at his words as Harry felt. The color that had been heating his face drained at the accusation. “...Harry, fuck, that’s not...I’m sorry...I didn’t--”
“And when you leave?”
“Right now, at this very moment, I just want to sleep.”
“With Hermione.” Harry tensed. “Why? Is it weird? I’m sorry. I didn’t -- I’m just tired.” He tried to sit up but Draco wouldn’t move his head.
“Hang on. I think Ron has something he’d like to say. Don’t you, Ron?” Hermione turned to stare at him and Ron sighed.
“Yeah.”
“There’s still time.” Draco sighed. “I almost wish that you had figured it out. Might have saved us both some trouble.”
“Fuck.” Draco sat back and stared down at him. “We should...” He cleared his throat. “We should get back.” His usually perfect hair was quite unruly now and Harry couldn’t help but grin.
“I do love when you curse, darling.” Draco was breathless and his hair was hanging down around them. His cheeks were tinged pink and his lips were red. It was, without a doubt, the hottest thing Harry had ever seen. “I’ll make a proper Slytherin out of you yet.”
“He is offering Harry to start immediately.” Percy clarified. “Rather than return to Hogwarts to complete his NEWTs, he recommends that Harry start his training immediately and study for his NEWTs there.”
“Bellatrix was a monster.” She pulled her hand back. “Besides, I will wear this scar with pride.” Hermione brushed her hair back.
“The parental figures in our lives wanted us to be what they wanted.” Harry shrugged. “Now that it’s all over, we can do whatever we want.”
“Well I am. I have got to take my NEWTs if I plan on getting a good job in the Ministry.”
Harry let himself be held and cried into Draco’s shoulder. His chest ached but the gentle touch of hands on his back helped to ease it a little. He didn’t know how long they sat there on the bed while he cried. But when he finally calmed down, his eyes burned and his throat hurt. Draco eased him back onto the bed and pulled him in close. Harry rested his head on Draco’s chest and sighed.
“--Weasley going to get over himself?” The voice was muffled but was definitely coming from somewhere above him.
“Oh. All right.” Harry stood up but Hermione grabbed his hand.
“Just a bit, yeah.”
“Same to you.” Harry sighed. “You know, it’s funny. I always thought it was Slytherin and Death Eaters that were so prejudiced. And, I mean, Death Eaters, definitely are. But the rest of us were just as prejudiced against Slytherin. We wasted seven years hating each other because we thought we were supposed to.”
“I think they can all spare a moment to help the Chosen One.” Malfoy tried to pull him up but Harry pushed his hand away.
“So, uh, you and Harry are friends now?” George raised an eyebrow.
“Everything all right?”
“I’m just worried about you!” Ron jumped up. “It’s Malfoy! It was barely a year ago you two tried to kill each other in a bloody loo! And now your best mates and snogging and holding hands! You’ve got to admit it’s weird.”
“Give him some time. I think he’ll come around. You’re his best mate.”
“Yeah. Guess it’s gonna take a long time before we’re all okay again, huh?”
“Well, you certainly seem fine. Far be it for me to think otherwise.” They sat in silence for several minutes. During which, Harry realized he was half off the bed and his glasses were pressing uncomfortably into his face. He sighed and rolled over onto his back and scooted until his whole body was on the bed.
“No. I mean, not really.” Harry shrugged and did his best to avoid Draco’s gaze. Until Draco gently took his chin and tilted his head to look at him.
“Did you?” Draco arched his brow as he fought back a smile. “And what did you think about?”
“Wow. Well, all right. Good then.” Harry relaxed and hadn’t realized that he had been tense. Hermione really was such a good friend. “And Ron?”
“Now that you’ve got me, what will you do with me?” Draco stared up at him, his pupils blown wide and his chest heaving.
“So you really died?”
“And you weren’t?” Draco looked down at him and Harry had said one of those stupid things again. He absolutely hated the look on his face. It was the same look that Molly would get when Harry came to the Burrow for the summer. The same look that Lupin and Sirius had shared when he had arrived at Grimmauld Place.
“Mmmm?”
“Good morning again, darling.” Draco grinned down at him. “Sleep well?”
“Of course, she does.”
“If you want me to get out of this bed, you’ve got to stop looking at me like that.” Harry shoved him gently and Draco fell back against the bed.
“Hello, Draco! Will you be joining us for dinner this evening?” Molly handed him a plate and Harry suddenly felt warm all over when Draco smiled back at her.
“Good. That’s good, Harry. Keep doing that.” Malfoy squeezed his shoulders again and Harry sucked in a breath when he did. Truth be told, it wasn’t hard. He had spent an entire year obsessed with Malfoy. He had watched him and followed him and scoured the Marauder's Map to find him. Now that Malfoy asked him to be attuned to his very breathing, that was simple.
Harry fell through the door of the Room of Requirement and slammed it shut behind him. His heart was pounding from running to the seventh floor and the adrenaline from his fight with Ron. He almost felt dizzy as his blood pumped through his veins too fast. He stumbled over to the bed and collapsed on it, breathing heavily. Sometimes when he fantasized about having a normal family, he rather forgot that huge blow out fights were almost as normal as warm and cozy dinners together.
“If you say so.” Ron shrugged. “You really think that nobody would go through the trouble of drugging you just to have you?”
“I’ll tell you later.” Harry muttered. For a moment, he imagined that this must be what it felt like to introduce a new partner to your family. And again, he desperately wished that his parents and Sirius could be here. He tried to picture the look on his godfather’s face when Harry told him that he was dating Draco Malfoy. It was a shame he would never get to see that face. It was pretty funny in his head.
“I really died.”
“Harry...” Draco reached out and pulled him into a tight hug. He stroked his hair and his back. “I am so sorry. You didn’t deserve to be treated like that.” Harry buried his head in the crook of Draco’s neck and took a deep breath.
“I think I would have remembered walking in on you having a wank. Especially if it was about me.”
“Well, clearly you’re going to decline.” Hermione leaned forward to look at Draco, as if she wanted to know he agreed and would back her up.
“You already are a force for good. You were rather instrumental in the defeat of the Dark Lord. Harry may have finished the job but he wouldn’t have made it without you. Without you, he and Weasley would have just stumbled blindly to their deaths. Or run headfirst into it.”
Harry had wasted months, MONTHS, wandering aimlessly around England. With no real idea of where he was going or what he was doing. He had dragged Ron and Hermione along with him because it turned out he was a selfish git along with everything else. Ron had been right to leave. He could see that now. The anger and frustration hadn’t been with Ron. It had been about Harry. And the horcrux. And really, Ron and Hermione had spent months not with one horcrux around their necks, dragging them down, but with two. They deserved medals.
“No, but you were right before. If we don’t make an appearance there’ll be hell to pay later.” He cast a quick cleaning charm over them. Harry forced himself to sit up and then get off the bed. If he stayed lying next to Draco much longer, they would never get up. Since there was no point in being modest anymore, Harry simply pushed his bottoms down and kicked them off.
“Harry Potter.” Malfoy squeezed his hand and gave him a small smile in return.
“About your bloody Muggles. And how they treated you.”
“Gorgeous. You’re usually so put together and everything. I like your hair all mussed up and your cheeks are a little pink from the pillow.” Harry got up on one hand to lean over him. “You look beautiful.”
“Draco Malfoy.” Harry couldn’t help but grin as he took his hand.
“I’ve been on the run for the last year. Food was hard to come by.” Harry shrugged. “It was harder on Ron and Hermione. They’re used to three square meals a day.”
“Did you... You saw your family when you died then?”
“Oh! Harry, dear, I forgot! You received an owl this afternoon.” Molly pulled an envelope out and handed it to him. He didn’t recognize the handwriting. Draco shared a glance with him and Harry shrugged. He opened the envelope and pulled the parchment out. His eyes scanned over it and he had to read it twice before he fully comprehended it’s meaning.
“That’s it?” Harry jerked up and stared at her. Ginny laughed and tossed her hair back. “Harry, no offense, but I could have told you that. You wanna know a secret?”
“I’m sure that Kingsley thought this out, Molly.” Arthur rested a hand on her shoulder. “He wouldn’t just make the offer willy-nilly. He must think that Harry is ready.” They all looked to Harry and he wanted to sink into the floor.
Harry gave a startled shout when the door behind him opened and he fell out into the hallway. It was too bright compared to the total darkness of the classroom. He blinked against the torchlight and looked up to glare at whoever had interrupted his well-earned reprieve. Just when he had thought this day couldn’t get worse. Draco Malfoy was stood over him, an eyebrow raised as he looked down at Harry sprawled on the stone floor.
“Great minds...” Harry trailed off and turned to watch Malfoy. “Shouldn’t you be with your parents?”
“I died.” The laughter was finally subsiding. But now he had to choke back sobs. “I was dead. I died. Alone. Only ghosts to keep me company.” Harry finally looked up at Malfoy who was much closer now. “I died.”
“You would have been absolute rubbish.” Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek and laughed when he was batted away with little enthusiasm. “We really must get up if you want breakfast.”
“Of course I mean it!” Harry growled in frustration. “Look, I accept your apology and I appreciate it. But I promise you that Draco hasn’t bewitched me with potions or spells or anything like that.”
“Fuck, Potter, you can’t just say things like that.” Draco panted and it was Harry’s turn to smirk. He pushed Draco’s shirt up but didn’t pull it up over his head. Harry trailed kisses and bites down his chest and abdomen. “Harry Potter, I swear on every god I know that if you don’t touch me right this second, I will die and then I will kill you.”
“For everything.” Harry shrugged.
“Because I always put too much on people. Ron and Hermione have been putting up with it for seven years. I risked their lives time and again and I thanked them by pushing them away and yelling at them.”
“Yeah, except he used...” Harry squeezed his eyes shut. “Seven.” He still had to swallow down bile at the thought. And he had thought the incident at the Ministry a couple years ago had been horrifying.
“Yeah, don’t do that.” Harry laughed. “But thanks for the offer.”
“How very kind of him.” Draco was still petting his hair but there was a strain in his voice. Harry opened his eyes to look at him.
“Glad I could help.” Harry closed his eyes. This was a bit odd. Harry didn’t sit like this with Ron. Or Seamus or Dean or Neville. Hermione sometimes. He hadn’t really even sat this close with Ginny since last year. But Draco was right. It almost felt like a spell had been cast in this room. It had settled over them and let them take refuge in each other. And some part of Harry knew that he should get up and go find Ron, Hermione, Ginny. But another part, and at this moment, a bigger part, wanted to stay right here.
“I’m not entirely sure we should go down to the Great Hall looking like this.”
“I have no idea. To be honest, I haven’t ever thought about it. Father raised me to be like him. And my father never worked a day in his life. He influenced other people to do his work for him. But my mother and I won’t be able to survive on the Malfoy name. Not anymore. I suppose I’ll have to find a vocation.”
“We are.” Draco answered simply. Harry snorted into his pumpkin juice when he didn’t elaborate at all.
“Yeah?”
“I--Yeah, I know.”
“Yeah, it is. You didn’t get the notice? I could have sworn we posted a notice.” Harry snorted and Ginny gave him a smirk. “So...” She sat down next to him. “You wanna tell me what’s going on with you?”
“What does?”
Distantly, he wondered where all the Slytherins were. Had they stayed in their common room? Had some ventured out to join the fray? Were they all huddled together in the Great Hall? Were they mourning for friends or family? Both sides had suffered significant casualties. Not just today. Harry certainly wasn’t about to begrudge their mourning. Regardless of who it was. Sirius had once told him that the world was not divided into good and evil. But never had it been more evident than today.
“You make an excellent point.”
“Stroked something enough.” Harry couldn’t see his face but he could hear the teasing smirk hidden in those words.
“Much rather see you.” Harry finally forced his eyes open and stared up at him. He lifted his hips to tug his pants and bottoms back up. Draco frowned for a moment before Harry tackled him onto his back. It was times like this Harry really wished Sirius was still around. He wasn’t sure their relationship would have survived something like The Talk or How Do I Have Sex with Another Man but they both would have tried. As it was, trying his best and going along with whatever Draco did had worked so far.
“He is a rather upstanding young man.” The voice sounded amused and then Harry registered fingers in his hair.
“How has it worked for you so far?” Harry scowled but said nothing. “As I thought.” Draco sighed and paused in his petting of Harry’s hair. “I always thought that the way you were treated at school was the same way you were treated at home. It never occurred to me that Dumbledore would put you in an environment like that.”
“Yes, darling?” Draco sat up and looked down at Harry with a smirk.
“Of course. After that I plan to get involved with the Ministry. I’ve always wanted to be a force for good in the world. And I think the Ministry could use some changes.”
“That isn’t exactly a long-term goal, Potter.”
“Why?”
“I pity anyone who dares to stand in your way, Granger.” Draco gave him a smile and she returned it.
“Merlin...” Malfoy looked a bit sick as well and that made Harry feel a bit better.
“Really? What about?”
“Not really. It was just like Sirius said. Like falling asleep.” Harry wrapped his arms around his knees. He wished Sirius were here to offer him more words of comfort.
“Why would he do that? Voldemort is dead, his father is in prison. What does giving me a love potion get him, exactly?”
“No.” Harry shook his head. “No, they – Fred – Madam Pomfrey has more pressing matters.” He rested his forehead on his knees and desperately wished his mother was here. Everything hurt. Maybe he was dying again. Maybe his resurrection only lasted long enough to finish the job.
To think he had woken up this morning with Draco. And had his first hand job. And given his first hand job. They should have just stayed in that bed. Harry would have strong words with Draco about that whole waking him up and forcing him out of bed thing later. For now, he would just enjoy the peace and quiet of the grounds. And let Draco have time with his mother.
“It isn’t as bad as it sounds. Especially if you find something that you genuinely enjoy doing.” Hermione was talking to Draco. Harry wasn’t sure if he was dreaming or not.
“It was abuse, Harry. What they did to you. It was abuse.” His voice was firm even as his touch was gentle as he cupped Harry’s face in his hands. “I need you to understand that. You were abused and you did not deserve it. You did nothing wrong.”
But on the floor of his old Potions Master’s classroom with his old rival pressed against his side, nothing was expected of him. Draco had already seen him break down. And he had never really expected or wanted to see the big hero. He may even be relieved to find that Harry hated that part of himself more than Draco did. It was a relief. Here, he could just be Harry. Not the Boy Who Lived or the Chosen One or whatever. And Draco could just be Draco. He didn’t have to be a Death Eater or the dutiful son to a pureblood family.
“That must have been a sight. A clean King’s Cross.” He shook his head. “...Did it hurt?”
“I can hear you, you know.” Harry finally decided to interject in their conversation. He blinked open his eyes and found that his head was pillowed in Draco’s lap under the tree. Hermione sat beside them with a book propped up on her knees.
“And my father?”
“You wanted to know about the Muggles.” Draco simply nodded. “For the first thirteen years of my life, I was never told I was loved. I was never shown I was loved. I was shown fear and hatred. My own family kept me in a cupboard. I think it was easier for them to pretend I wasn’t there.” Harry took a deep breath.
There was a quiet shock that ran through the Weasleys at Draco so casually joining their family for dinner. Harry was surprised himself that he willingly sat at what had always been the Gryffindor table. Ginny and Charlie shared a knowing look. George and Percy both looked rather floored. Ron and Arthur had dark looks on their faces. Molly and Hermione were the only two that seemed perfectly fine with this new arrangement.
“Don’t use my own argument against me! It isn’t fair.”
“Harry, ignoring it will not make it go away.”
“More than likely.” Draco pulled back. “But I think we should worry about that when it happens and not before.” He leaned down and pressed his lips against Harry’s.
Harry desperately wanted to scream in frustration. But that would draw too much unwanted attention. Instead he clenched his fists so tightly that his fingernails pressed into the skin of his palms. Breathe. Just hold it together for another minute or two. He could do that. He had to do that. Harry was so tired of doing things that he had to do.
“You...called me Harry.” Good. That was a genius thing to say. He suppressed the urge to groan and hit his head against the wall behind him.
“I am. Jeez.” Harry rolled his eyes but started to put some food on his plate. Draco followed suit and they all fell into a mostly comfortable silence.
“I just...” Harry pulled the pillow over his face. “Sometimes it makes more sense.”
“And Hermione deserved quite the apology. From myself and on behalf of my entire family.” Draco grimaced slightly and Hermione reached out to touch his arm gently.
Draco surged up and caught his lips in a kiss. Harry smirked against his lips. He wasn’t the only one easily riled up. He had learned fairly quickly that Draco absolutely loved to be complimented. And it was so easy to compliment him. He still had no idea what he was even doing but it felt good. And he didn’t want it to stop.
“You’re an idiot.” Draco sighed but rested his head on top of Harry’s. “Do you often sit like this with your friends?”
“Harry!” Hermione waved when she saw them. Harry returned the wave and started walking over. Draco let him go.
“Mate, I’m just trying to look out for you!” Ron was shouting now as well. “He’s a bloody Death Eater!”
“So, when I say it’s hard to believe that people care about me, it’s not for nothing. I spent eleven years thinking that I wasn’t loveable. I was conditioned to believe that I wasn’t loved or worthy of love. And I did believe it. Sometimes I still do. When Molly makes me a sweater for Christmas. When Hermione tries to get me to be more cautious. When Sirius wanted to spend time with me. When you’re here with me instead of anywhere else.”
“Gay rights, mainly. For wizards and Muggles.”
“Fine. Will you at least send a damn Patronus so nobody thinks that I’ve abducted you.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “You send a Patronus and I’ll take you to an actual bed. And not to shag, oh Chosen One. You’d fall asleep halfway through.”
“Angry with you?” Draco frowned and stepped closer to Harry. He took his hand again. “No, Harry, I’m not angry with you. I’m worried and curious and confused but not angry.”
“I had my fair share of panic attacks last year. Blaise dealt with them when he was younger so he was able to help me.”
“I’ll see you in a bit. I’m going to eat with Mother.”
“Yeah. I know what you mean. Like, how dare we be happy when...” Harry trailed off but George brightened a bit.
“Don’t let Ron get to you. I think he’s just...shocked. And he doesn’t know what to think. You know how he can get. I seem to remember the two of you had quite the row before the first task in the Triwizard Tournament.”
“You were the one who ran first.” Scorpius whispered back, giving his brother a side eye.
"Hey, hurry up!" Seamus' voice from the door startled them both; Harry thank Godric that his culprit's soft yelp covered up his sudden body jerk.
A hard smack on his back retrieved him back to reality and he reached a hand to rub the abused spot as he regarded the guilty person with an irritated look. “What's that for?!”
“And never once I thought Potter as the father of my children!” said Malfoy incredulously.
Draco gasped, eyes widened as the blushed on his face deepened, immediately took a look at his surroundings as if he had just realised that he was still at the Great Hall. "Merlin." he said, giving him an astonishing look. "You are mad."
“How'd you know?” asked Ron, as he moved to take a seat in front of the Irishman. The rest of them automatically followed his action.
He spend his time talking to a man for the past few hours, entertained with the way the human outwardly enthralled by his existence and tried to feel him by spreading his fingers to his thigh, getting higher by the seconds when his detector chimed for the second time that night and he subtly turned to see both Harry and Ginevra was already on their feet, already saying their goodbyes to their companions as they headed for the entrance.
By the way his younger self evidently dropped his gaze down to Draco’s exposed chest, Harry knew instantly what the ruckus was about.
He heard Potter laughed, patting his head. Draco disapprovingly frowned at the man, for messing his perfect hair.
Ginny laughed, carefree and loud as she dropped both of her hands on his shoulders, and gazed down on him in a knowing look; bright and wide.
"Excuse me?" exclaimed Scorpius, giving his brother a disbelief look. "You were the one who had insisted on looking after dad, while I went and took the Map and you blame me? You were the one who lost him!"
"I want you."
"Merlin, if we can be quick about this? Pansy are waiting for me."
Draco bit his lips, not denying that the man in front of him right now was indeed very attractive.
Harry nodded, memories of Draco who was glowing and looking much healthier during his pregnancy playing through his mind. Draco did not encounter any complexity during those months he was carrying their sons. He was having a healthy pregnancy.
Harry frowned at him. “Now, that's ridiculous. Don't you dare say you never thought about it. Black hair, green eyes. Who else got that if it was not me?”
Draco Malfoy’s crush.
"Nothing." replied Albus. "It's not our problem anymore."
"If you don't come back to me within twenty four hours, I will kill everything." said Harry, agreeing reluctantly. After all, they were equal in every aspect and he has promised himself that he will never look down upon his lover's abilities. He refused to be an overprotective lover to the point that he was suffocating them. He was scared, obviously, but he knew he needed to put his trust on him.
Draco wasn't sure what to feel about that too. “Why are we talking about my virginity all of a sudden?”
"Come on," said the older man. "Let's not keep Draco wait." he gestured, and took a step forward towards Malfoy.
"Says the person who's sneaking in the Gryffindor tower to send his love interest a fucking chocolate."
Now that the twins were literally standing in front of him, he could finally see them up close; the matching set of faces with the same unruly hairs with opposite colours and cut, down to the colour of their eyes. Harry noted with surprise that Albus harbour the clear set of grey eyes, similar to Malfoy's and when he turned to the other twin, hoping to see exact copy of grey eyes, he was taken aback when his eyes met with a pair of green eyes instead. His eyes widened as he stood there with stupefaction and felt Hermione’s tight grip on his robe, he knew she saw it too.
Harry just nodded and didn’t turn around to the child that had pushed him. Instead he looked up to his savior and regretted it the second he had done it. The person holding his arm was a boy around his age, he had light skin and his hair was white, he looked like an angel, like a winter child or something. He had sharp outlines but his lips seemed soft. Harry’s eyes walked up his face to the eyes of the boy, they were light blue, like crystals, and they were ice cold. So cold that Harry almost started freezing.
Blaise Zabini was a rich boy his age with similar believes as the Malfoys. His mother got divorced several times, or better, she got widowed, leaving Zabini and his mother with lots of money.
Protect him? Why would he need protection? Harry went trough everything alone till now, he was perfectly fine on his own. “The Slytherins did nothing to me, they are all very nice” Harry then said and smiled. “But wouldn’t you feel better if you are somewhere that connects you with your family? With your parents? Slytherin can’t give you that”. Dumbledore said. “So you want me to go to Gryffindor instead?” Harry asked. “I think Gryffindor could give you back a little bit of family.”
“You did that very bad then, Draco” said a different voice from the door. Two Boys walked through the door. One had dark skin and dark short hair. He looked like the total opposite of Draco, both equally beautiful. His eyes looked at him and Harry tried to make himself tiny, felt ugly and unworthy to sit here.
Draco looked at Harrys eyes and felt an urge to touch his hair again. He didn’t want to be friends with harry, no he wanted to be more for harry than just a mere friend.
“Yes” Draco said and then said the password for the dorm which wasn’t some stupid sweetname.
Harry was terribly lost and the moving stairs made it not one bit better.
(See the end of the chapter for
The gargoyle looked at him, nodded and then went out of the way. Fu**ing finally!
(See the end of the chapter for
idk what i'm doing
It was still raining. Then he walked in the direction Harry had run off to.
Now he had lost his first, his one and only friend. But Hogwarts was the first place that told him he was okay the way he was. Harry didn’t started to believe so, but he started to hope, started to want something. Harry just couldn’t accept that now not Harry but others got treated the way he is getting treated at home.
His face looked very strict and his hair was as black as his clothes. His eyes were close together and his nose was long. He couldn’t be older than 35, way too young to be a professor. His skin was light and he seemed kind of… sad. Or maybe just angry. Or both.
Oh yeah, Dumbledore bashing starts around now
Why did that angel still hold his arm? Harry felt dirty beside that boy, ugly and disgusting. The boy looked at Harry for only a second, then stared down the boy behind him.
Harry just run. He didn’t knew where to go or what to do. Why did he scream at Draco? And hit him??
Harry tried to walk the rest up but kept falling against the banister. After a while, it stopped to move and Harry took all his remaining strength and run up the rest of the stairs.
“So You Guys think the Headmaster has some dubious business going on?” Blaise asked and leaned back in his chair. Draco didn’t want to talk about it with the others but after Harry and Draco went back in their dorm, these idiots caught them and didn’t want to leave it be.
************
It was a hard time to find the train, but now that he stood here he wasn’t quite sure what to do. Hagrid had left him a long time ago and he was bad at talking to others. It also seemed like all the other children around him already knew each other. Harry looked around in fear. He wouldn’t find anyone to sit with. Even among Freaks he was the biggest freak. He smirked because of that thought. He tried to enter the train but got pushed and almost fell down if not for a strong hand to hold him up. “Oh, sorry, didn’t see you there” a voice said from behind.
And yeah, what could he do now except for protecting her child?
Before Ron could say anything more, the door crashed open and a man in black clothes rushed in.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was around six back then. His uncle didn’t let him go to the bathroom because … Harry couldn’t remember why. The whole day he had done as always, hoping that he would be allowed to go to the bathroom at the end of the day. The whole day he had asked about it, in the end begged. His uncle had told him that he shouldn’t act like that, that everyone could go a day or two without peeing.
“What is your problem Professor?” Harry heard Draco’s Voice ask. Harry raised his head, surprised and scared. Snape turned around. “Sit down, Mr Malfoy or I shall-” “Shall what? Half the class didn’t knew the answer to any of your questions, I reckon only Granger and I knew the answers. Still, you picked on Harry Potter just because he’s a celebrity?”. Draco said angry. Snape came back, furious. “I will let you come again for another hour if you don’t sit down Mr Malfoy!”.
What was Harry for him? The boy who lived, the chosen one. His father was obsessed with harry potter, but he wasn’t what Draco thought he would be. Just a little boy that probably went through some hardships but was still so innocent.
But who was he, to put the responsibility of survival of the magic world on the shoulders of a little boy?
It’s funny how Harry thinks that now, but every time he had tried to fight back, nothing but pain had welcomed him. Maybe Draco was right after all, maybe Harry deserved all he had gone through. The death of his parents, the pain, the hatred. It started to rain. Harry tried to safe himself from the rain and went inside. He didn’t knew where he was nor how he could get to his dorm. He saw a little storeroom, a little bigger than his cupboard at home. It was empty. Harry went inside and closed the door. In here, no one would hurt him. In here, he was safe. Vernon was too fat to get inside, he needed to pull him out.
What should he do now? He already went up all the stairs, there was no way he would go back. Maybe he could climb over the gargoyle.
Harry shook his head. “Nothing can give me back my dead parents. I mean, I didn’t even knew them. Sure, I’m sad they’re dead but not because I loved them but more because the life I can remember was terrible. I’m okay as it is, Thank you” Harry started to feel uncomfortable.
After a while, Draco still got up. He couldn’t sleep like that! It was part his fault that Harry wasn’t here and he didn’t wanted Harry to tell someone how Draco had freaked out.
Draco put on his coat and left silently. He went back to the place they departed.
Blaise was different from Pansy and Nott since he was unpredictable and Draco didn’t knew him well, didn’t understand him. He was curious about him, which was why he was keeping him around.
Draco returned to their dorm, but Harry wasn’t there. “Hey, Draco, took you a long time to find back” Blaise said and laughed. Draco never really considered Blaise a friend, but now that Draco thought about it, did Draco consider anyone his friend?
“Where is Harry?” Draco asked and sat down. “The last time I saw him he was with you”, Blaise said and Draco nodded. “I see”. Draco thought about looking for Harry, but then layed down on his bed. He wouldn’t search for Harry, he wasn’t his friend…
The other boy wasn’t as beautiful as Draco or the other angel, but he was cute in a way. He was also more tiny than the two angels but not as tiny as Harry, no one was as tiny as him. He had dark blond hair and brown eyes. “Who is that?” said the boy with the dark skin.
“Maybe we should ask Snape about it.” Draco said. “There are other things I wanted to talk about with him anyways”. He thought back to the incident in the bathroom. “Draco, When we get to class, please apologize to Hermione!” Harry pleased. Draco sighed. “Harry, I see that you have problems I don’t know of yet so I will try to be nicer but an apology goes a bit far”.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My name is Pansy Parkinson” the girl said then. “I am Blaise Zabini” said the other angel. “I’m Theodore Nott, you can call me Theo” said the second boy at last and Harry nodded. “Nice to meet you all” he said then shy. “Isn’t he cute” Pansy said. “Can we keep him?”. Blaise chuckled and sat down beside Harry.
Dudley is-”Harry thought for a second. “How do you know how my cousin his Professor?” Harry asked confused. He talked to no one about his family, not even Draco. “I am always well informed about your life. I personally brought you to the Dursleys.” He answered calmly.
“You can’t just ask him that. I apologize for my friends, they don’t know any boundaries” Draco said then, looking at Harry, waiting for a reaction. Vainly.
“I don’t know the password” Harry said after he got up again. “Then you can’t enter” the gargoyle said. Harry nodded. “Where are we anyway?” Harry asked then. “This is the gargoyle corridor.” “And where does it lead to?” Harry asked curious. The gargoyle looked at him, thinking if he should continue talking to the child. “To the headmaster’s office”. Harry opened his eyes in shook and took some steps backwards. “Then, good night-” Harry said and tried to sneak away but then the gargoyle moved away and revealed the old man from before, who called himself Professor Dumbledore. “Hello Harry” The old man said in a calm voice. “He-Hello Professor Dumbledore”.
“Yeah, alright, i’ll apologize”. How come he always ended up doing stuff he swore he wouldn’t do?
Harry said he couldn’t be Draco’s friend, but they haven’t been friends in the first place.
Maybe that had always been inside him, a this furious anger.
Snape knew that it was idiotically to be so obsessed with his love Lily, but what could he do?
But he’s not a pig...
“What house you think you will go to? Have any preferences?” “I don’t know yet, I will just go there where I’m told.” Harry said silently.
Still, the storm was coming, slowly creeping up his Back. Soon, the dark lord would arrive.
“My apologies for touching you so violently. I just wanted to get away from that disgusting being and you seemed uncomfortable so I dragged you with me.” The angel said and waited a little bit, probably expecting any reaction from Harry. Without success.
Yeah, that wasn’t so bad at all. Now he didn’t need to face Draco that hated him by now. Harry curled himself up and started to sleep, tired from his fight with Draco and his emotions.
When he opened the door he heard the voice of Professor Dumbledore
But he could live with it for a while. Just a bit. Being a friend was okay.
Harry touched Draco’s Hand, writing thank you on it. If someone had said that Draco had been red after that, he would have denied it.
When he finally arrived at the gargoyle, the gargoyle said “Password?”
“You would be perfect as a Slytherin Harry!” Pansy said then. “What? Why??” Harry asked shocked. “You are a pure blood as much as I know and you will be a strong wizard for sure. I mean, you defeated you know who as a baby, you survived death with nothing more but a scar-”
Harry was shocked by the question. Sure, he was angry at Draco, but he still was his one and only friend and the first person he felt safe with. “I...Parents don’t define their children” he said then.
Now, in Harry Dream, Dudley was there, laughing and pointing fingers at him while his uncle hit him again and again. Every punch made Blood drip on the floor. After that, his uncle would wait till Harry washed it away after punching him again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at Harry a little bit longer, then looked at Pansy. “How is your mother?” he asked. “She’s doing fine, nothing to worry about” she answered quickly and gave her attention back to harry, who was happy that they all had stopped looking at him.
“It’s not your fault Harry, don’t worry too much” Pansy said and touched Harrys Back. Harry flinched because of the touch and then laughed. “Yeah, I’ll go take a shower” He said and took some clothes with him. Since he started to shower whenever he felt like, it became his favorite activity. It felt like he was protected by something so warm.
“Maybe just die” he whispered and laughed. He sighed.
“What brings you to my office in the middle of the night?” Dumbledore asked and held the door open for Harry to enter. “I can’t go, I don’t know the password” “It’s acid Pops, now you know”
When Harry awoke, he thought he was in his cupboard, still feeling the dried urine between his thighs and the pain in his back.
“That might be true, but doesn’t that child represent your cousin?” Dumbledore continued asking.
In thee end he peed on the floor n the kitchen and then was forced to stay in the dirty clothes and clean everything up. Just to get beaten up with his uncles belt when he got home and Dudley told him about what Harry had done.
All these people weren’t his friends, friends were people that didn’t betray you yet and want to use you. That wasn’t meant to be negative. Draco was using them, they were using Draco.
It was weird. While warm water went down his body, Harry thought about the last days. The headmaster had a problem with him, the house teacher of slytherin had a problem with him. How come so many people hated him without knowing him? It was weird already to find out that he was something like a celebrity in the magic world. If you think about it, being a celebrity for not dying is kind of weird already.
“You could try” Harry whispered. “Yeah Draco, get a hold of yourself. Mud blood is a bit harsh to call someone” Pansy tried to help Harry and then put some meat on Harrys plate. “Oh, i’m full” Harry tried but Pansy shushed him.
He leaned forward and put on a considerate face. “Isn’t it rather that you want to change houses?” Harry turned around, quite surprised. “There is no shame in not feeling well sometimes Harry. Considering your path, I feel like I have to protect you. You have many bad memories in connection to slytherin”.
Idk how to write children
“Draco-” “Tomorrow” Draco said and wanted to go in. Harry held his arm. “Are we still friends Draco?” Harry asked, scared to lose his first ever friend.
He would find that idiot!
I'm German btw so pls don't be mean because of my English >.<
Harry said nothing. They went down the stairs, the way back harry came from and after a while they arrived at the dorms.
“It is weird that he tried to convince Harry do change houses. He’s the headmaster, he shouldn’t favor any house nor should he hate one”. Pansy said and took a sip of her black tea.
Draco got up, unsure what to do. He should just leave it be, Harry wasn’t his problem. Not his friend, not his anything.
Unlike Zabini and Pansy and Nott.
And the end of the staircase was a gargoyle, ugly and scary. You couldn’t walk past it. Behind the gargoyle was a door.
“You are okay with sleeping in the same room with a child whose parents helped to kill yours?”
“Are we gonna be okay?”
“I died!” Harry was aware that this was probably not the right response. But that knowledge was far away, distant. And he couldn’t stop laughing. “They all spent 16 years trying to keep me alive so I could die when they wanted! That’s...come on! That’s hilarious.”
“Honestly, George...I’m not sure we’ll ever be okay again.”
“Because Hermione is.” Harry grinned at his best friend. Ron turned red and went back to his breakfast.
“You don’t know that.”
“Can’t.” Harry managed to choke out. Malfoy turned to give Harry his full attention now. Damn. He shouldn’t have said that. “I should – I meant to –” Breathe. “Thank you. For your help. Back at the Manor.”
“Apparently her and Molly had a mother conversation with a single look the other day. They both agree that you are in desperate need of a mother.”
“Not really?” Draco raised his eyebrow. “So you believed some of it?”
The dark, cool, quiet of the dungeons was shockingly welcome for once. His steps had led him, unbidden, to his old Potions classroom. Maybe drawn by the recent revelations of the man that had spent years protecting Harry. And tormenting him. Harry leaned back against the door, closing it behind him before he pulled the cloak off.
“...Please, Harry.”
“What was it like?”
Harry Potter groaned sleepily when he felt cool air on his skin. He groped blindly for the blankets to try and pull them back on. His hands came up empty, only feeling the warm space beside him. A gentle, quiet laugh reached his ears and he groaned again. It was too early for this. He rolled onto his other side and pulled the pillow up over his head. He was warm and comfortable and still tired.
“Dumbledore at King’s Cross? I would have thought he was too good to take the train.”
“Of course we are. We’re going to be fine.”
“And, it may not mean anything now, but I will do anything in my now very limited power I can do to help you. A lot of Father’s connection weren’t necessarily interested in the Dark Lord coming to power. Most of them were merely hedging their bets.” Draco sneered and Harry couldn’t help but grin at him.
“Yeah. Yes. That’s me. Open-minded. Definitely. Open to new ideas.” Harry managed not to groan at how utterly stupid he sounded. Merlin, what the fuck even was today? Draco leaned over him and Harry held his breath. Draco looked over his face and a smirk tugged at his lips.
“They aren’t quite so foolish as all that.” There was a beat of silence. “Oh, all right. Not anymore. Harry became a lot more careful after... Well, he learned to be a bit more cautious.”
“Oh, good.” Harry sighed heavily. That was just what he needed. More people telling him to eat all the time. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled him into the Great Hall. He had managed to sleep through lunch somehow. He must have been more tired than he thought. Draco walked right over to the old Gryffindor table and directed Harry to sit beside Hermione and he dropped into the seat next to Harry.
“Exactly! How can I be happy or excited or anything when he isn’t here anymore? I know that Fred...he’d want me to be happy. To be okay and move on. He’d tell me to stop being such a morose git and get over it.” Harry laughed.
“That was terrible. You ought to be ashamed of that terrible sex pun.”
“You can’t distract me by snogging me.”
“I think we all figured that out.” Draco stroked his hair back from his forehead. “It is curious though. If he was the most powerful wizard in an age and he was gay, why hide it? Surely he could have done so much for the gay community.”
“Yeah.” Harry muttered. “I’ll...I need to think about it.” She squeezed his hand before letting go.
“’Course. ‘M fine.” Harry didn’t bother to lift himself off the bed. The mattress dipped and then Draco was running his fingers through his hair.
“Don’t be a tease, Harry.” Draco leaned down and kissed him again. Now that they had started, it was as though they couldn’t stop. And he wasn’t complaining. Harry chased Draco’s mouth as he pulled away.
“You’re just so easily riled up. I can’t help myself.”
“Potter? What the bloody hell are you doing down here?” Harry waited for the usual irritation to surface whenever Malfoy spoke. But it didn’t come. Distantly, he wondered if his existential crisis and grief was taking up too much of him. And then realized that he still had tears running down his cheeks.
“It turns out that you aren’t such an insufferable.” Draco glanced over at him and Harry grinned.
“Dunno. I hadn’t thought about it. Didn’t give my future much thought at all.”
“Yes?”
And, on top of everything, Harry had died. He had died. He had walked into the Forbidden Forest with certainty that he would die. Sure, he had walked into the forest a number of times before and had always worried that he wouldn’t walk back out. But this time, he had known. And he hadn’t walked back out had he? Hagrid had carried him back out. He had been sure, just a couple hours ago, that the only thing that had truly died out there had been that piece of Voldemort that had clung to him. Now...maybe a piece of Harry had died too.
“Yeah. Fine.” Harry sat down beside her, putting space between him and Ron. Harry hadn’t told either of his friends much about his relationship with Draco. Hermione had surmised and didn’t seem to mind too much while Ron, well. Ron seemed to suspect that something was going on. And he definitely did not seem to be okay with it. He hadn’t said anything to Harry directly of course. But whenever Draco was around, Ron ignored both of them.
“There‘s no need to be concerned about that. I don’t even know where they are. And I don’t ever have to see them again. A fact that I’m sure we are all grateful for. I’d very much like to just forget about it.”
“I was thinking...” Harry groaned as he dropped back onto the floor and winced at the impact. “If I had been sorted into Slytherin if things would have turned out different.”
And the other problem with family was that they usually knew exactly how to press one's buttons. Ron likely hadn’t even done it on purpose. Maybe he had but Ron wasn’t cruel. A git sometimes, yeah. But not cruel. Still, he had harped on one of Harry’s biggest fears. Nobody really cared about him. They only cared about what Harry could do for them. That fear had only gotten worse after seeing Snape's memories.
“How are you George?” Harry winced even as he finished speaking. George just shrugged.
“Why is my nickname the Giant Squid?”
“Of course, not, Draco, that’s not what I meant.”
“Still.” Draco pressed closer to him. “I rather enjoy not having to actively hate you. It’s quite a relief.”
“What was that look about?” Harry looked up at his pillow and Draco glanced down at him. He tilted his head slightly to the side as he contemplated how to answer.
“As much as I hate to admit it, you rather helped there too.” Harry shrugged. “It was incredibly stupid but Fiendfyre is one of the few things that can destroy a horcrux.”
A breeze of whispers suddenly touched Harry's lips sending tingles to his entire body, and he had to repress a gasp that was about to form.
“That's brilliant, Potter.” Blaise nodded in approval. “So, what do we need to do next?”
Harry watched as they fell into a small argument. Zabini, Ron and Ginny choose to be observers while Malfoy already had Albus on his lap, watching the girls with the same unimpressed look on their faces.
Not that he was wrong.
Draco felt a little bit light headed as he gave Henry a mindless nod, “Al- alright then.” He shakily breathed, eyes blank as he tried to process Henry's words.
That can only mean one thing; “I guess we can find the book in the Restricted Section at the library.” said Draco, index finger reached out to touch his chin in a deep thought. “However,” He continued, “The only way I can bring the both of you is without you being seen by anyone and that is impossible. I barely know Disillusionment Charm myself, so we need another plan.”
Harry whipped his head to see one of twins was giving him a challenging look as he heard gasps around him. Even Malfoy looked surprised, his jaw was slightly dropped in disbelief. “Albus!” he scolded, “That was a very impolite thing to do!”
Draco rolled his eyes at the man's words, but rewarded him with a smile nevertheless. He took a deep breath and slowly nodded. “Yes, I'm honoured to be your boyfriend, Harry Potter.”
“I would appreciate it if you didn't shout like a Neanderthal, Weasley. My sons are sleeping.” said Draco calmly, as nonchalant as he could.
Draco frowned in perplexed when all of them burst out laughing at Potter who turned bright red.
“Do you know anything else about your mysterious kisser apart from being a Slytherin?”
Specifically, they were filled with the thoughts of the owner of the name that Harry currently engrossed with on the Marauder's Map, who was probably sleeping soundly seeing that his name has been static ever since Harry has laid his eyes on it for the past few minutes.
“-I fall in love with someone.” Potter finished in a whisper and Draco nodded slowly.
Their uncle widened his eyes and laughed out loud, throwing his head back and clutched onto his stomach. “And they know me too!”
"He will be safe, Harry."
He regarded them warily, “What?”
“I'll pray for that day to come.” replied Draco, winking back at the attractive man in front of him.
They stood still when they heard aunt Hermione’s voice, and quickly tugged the Cloak off them as Scorpius moved to put the Cloak back in the trunk and Albus worked to deactivate the Map. They simultaneously jumped in their dad's bed, scrambling themselves under the blanket and feigned a sleep just in time as the door was opened.
Harry gave Draco a gentle smile when the younger man turned to him. There was something close to a shed of glassy tears gathered around his eyes and he knew that his little husband was enormously affected by his words but he tried to not let it show. They looked at one another, just a touch of a moment before Harry tapped his hands, and nodded to the other side of the bed.
Malfoy merely raised a brow.
Harry turned to Malfoy, who was still looking up to him helplessly. “Are you okay? Did he touch you inappropriately?”
“Papa, you sound funny!” Albus laughed, and Scorpius copied. “But you look just like in the picture!”
It was in late November on Monday morning, the first time it happened. One moment it was just a regular breakfast within the Great Hall, when a chorus of delighted squeals broke out through the Slytherin’s table which promptly transformed the hall's atmosphere.
Draco gaped, unconsciously inching away from Henry as he stared at the older man incredulously. His action however, managed to make Henry laugh out loud, throwing back his head and he put his hands on his stomach.
“We use dad and papa’s wands of course!” Albus shrugged.
“Can we just focus at one moment that it's all in the future? Anything can happen!”
“Stop that, Pans.”
He blinked when Harry grinned at him. Fucking hell, what an attractive demon.
He smiled.
“Later.” Draco answered, eyes locked on his twins as they were engrossed with Granger displays of magic. The Weasleys and Potter watch the interaction with interest. He raised an eyebrow when Potter handed his wand to Albus who received it with a large grin, and started to mimic Granger’s hand movement. Draco chuckled when Albus whooped in delight when he managed to copy her.
He swallowed the bitter taste in his mouth as the man reached them and drew a good natured smile on his face. The man's gaze fell on each one of them, and Harry can't help but notice there's a twinkle in those - dear Merlin, his eyes were green. They stopped on Harry, there was something in those eyes that made him unconsciously gulp. He can literally feel the man's magic, so powerful that he was sure the others can feel them too.
His ears perk up when he heard voices whispering; loud enough to fill in the dead silence of the night, but still low for Harry to listen to the conversation. He forced his heart to calm down, taking a steady breath to convince the night visitors that he was dead asleep. Whatever they were doing, they definitely didn't want anyone to find out and well, Harry was curious enough to know and he'd be stupid if he ruins their fun.
With that, they simultaneously turned to the person who had seated himself next to Harry, face slightly annoyed as he bore his blue eyes towards his brother's grey one, clearly unimpressed by his brother's behaviour.
"I mean," drawled Malfoy, waving his younger brother dismissively. "Despite our eyes, we're basically the same person. A perfect copy of each other, because we're
“I beg your pardon?!” Draco can feel his eyes bulge out, staring at Henry astonishingly. He unconsciously raised his hands to put them protectively in front of his chest, giving the older man a stinky eye.
Zabini shrugged, “Truce then.”
Since they were allowed to the Restricted Section now, they only have to use the Invisibility Cloak on the twins and because of Malfoy’s probation, he decided that it was much safer if the Gryffindors were the one who will retrieve the book with the twins-
Irritated, he turned to look over his shoulder only to have his lips kissed in such a brief moment - only lips pressed against another lips - but hard enough to ensure Harry that it was not his imagination. His nose was prodded fondly with a gentle finger when the lips disappeared, and felt something was tucked just behind his back; a heart shaped chocolate.
And then it happened.
"Are you really sleeping?"
Draco automatically held a breath, before he released them shakily. “Since when did you become such a beast?”
"He is," nodded Scorpius, before giving his brother a disapproval look. "But that doesn't mean it gave you an excuse to be rude to him."
“You don't have to be scared of me, Draco.”
“It's time to go home, Malfoy.” smiled Potter sweetly, creating those ridiculous somersaults in Draco’s stomach but he sighed instead, “I guess I am.”
“Slytherin.”
, or did you miss the point, Granger?"
"-but you're afraid that he was cursed during his time away before he met you again."
Albus however, immediately dropped his act hearing Malfoy's words. “I am sorry, papa.”
“Perhaps it was because you were the only one in this room who's actually a virgin?” She Weasley piped up, uncertain.
“Huh?”
“I- over there, I- I'm sensitive."
"Potter's boyfriend." said Malfoy eventually, lips curved in a teasing way as he regarded Harry and it took willpower for him not to squirm in his seat.
He pulled out the spare wand from his back pocket as he tapped his left wrist, couldn't help the snort that escaped when 'sleeping, safe' written under Albus and Scorpius' tattooed name on his wrist. He tapped for the second time, chuckling when he saw where the twins had resided themselves. Knowing his sons, seeing they were actually at the Gryffindor tower, mainly sleeping in his former bed was reassuring enough. He trusted Ron and Hermione to keep their eyes on the twins.
Ah, there it is. Regardless, Draco decided to play along and nodded. “He was.”
He and Granger gasped simultaneously, grasping each other's hands and threw a dirty look at the red haired man and he heard Potter chuckled at that.
Henry touched his lips with his thumb, eyeing Harry with a look as if he was caught doing something bad. “I don't know what you're talking about, we didn't do anything.”
The twins skipped next to their parents - Harry was not sure what to feel about that - but suddenly Scorpius made a turn and went to him and grabbed his hand, smiling up to him. Harry caressed his head in return.
“What can we help you with, Malfoy?” asked Hermione when nobody took the initiative to speak.
Their father promptly nodded in agreement, “Yes, of course.” he breathed, glancing at the two of them, “That would be perfect.”
Harry felt warmth spreading through his cheek by the sudden appearance of the soft smile. He blinked rapidly, pushing up his glasses to cover up his embarrassment. "It's- It's fine. I would do that to everyone."
“You'll live!”
"A whole lot of problems!" said Draco, and he got down from the bed, marching angrily at him. "He won't stop apologising!"
A death glare stares down at him, manages to gives him chills so he quickly put on a sheepish smile, hands lets go off the injured pretty hands to rub down the toned thigh in a gentle manner.
“What, Harry?” asked Hermione, who turned out to be the victim of Harry's jab attack. She swatted Harry's finger away, a little frown decorating her face.
“Doesn't matter. Stand down, both of you.”
“That was because I will make sure you never noticed.” Potter grinned, slowly lowering his hands down to Draco’s waist and pulled Draco towards him.
"Bye, Potter." sneered Malfoy, though without that much malice and walked away immediately with his head stubbornly facing forward, leaving his friends behind.
“Truce.” They announced in unison and lifted their own pumpkin juice to clink it together in the middle. Albus and Scorpius laughed as they took a sip of their drink.
At that, Harry sighed. "I did, actually." he bit his lips, frowning a little before he continued. "Like I said before, professor, we have a theory that the curse was casted in between before and after Draco graduated from Hogwarts. I have given Draco a full body inspection and yet, I found none."
"Don't leave me, please!" begged Harry desperately, using his leftover strength to pull Draco into his lap, and wrapped his arms around his lover, bringing their face together. "I can't do this without you."
He briefly glanced at the particular name on the Marauder's Map, been static ever since the first time Harry sought his name on the old parchment.
“Dad?!” Ron squeaked, mirroring Harry's inner voice but was ignored.
Draco blinked, perplexed. "What?"
"I mean, not everyone but only those who are in need-"
"Whatever for?" frowned Harry.
“Well,” Potter cluck his tongue in a playful manner. “Ron always said that I looked at you like you hung the moon, especially after you kissed me. I've been dying for your kisses, did you know that?” He bent down closer, wrapping his arms full on Draco’s waist, pulling him closer and Draco raised his arms to rest them around Potter's neck. He bit back a smile from forming when Potter playfully rubbed their noses together. “Hermione been giving me a hell of a week, because she said and I quote, ‘Stupid moron who doesn't realised his own feelings, I hope Draco stops being in love with you!’”.
“I don't mean the two of you.” He waved them away. “I just can't believe-” He stared at the four Gryffindors in front of him. Granger and She Weasley’s faces looked like they had been painted with red, Potter looked rather embarrassed whilst Weasley coughed into his hand.
“Malfoy?”
"Whatever, come on."
He waited patiently when he saw Scorpius ran towards him with determination. “Papa!”
“You're a virgin!” announced Weasley. He noticed Potter promptly turned his head to Weasley in surprise before he turned back to Draco, dropping his jaw in shock.
"Seamus." shrugged Harry.
Harry's eyes widened, heart started hammering through his ribcage as he looked at Ginny unbelievably. "What?"
The occupants of the room grimaces in unison at the name, Harry included.
"I can!" exclaimed Albus with too much enthusiasm as he started to mimic their dad's movement, peeking around the place as his eyes darted around to look for Scorpius.
Leo frowned, before he chuckled as if something clicked inside his head, and gave his brother a smile that could melt a hard metal. "I need your help, brother. Can you do it for me, pretty please?"
“Oh, we miss you so much!” cried Albus, burying his face into their father's robe.
“So, uh, I'm actually done with my meeting and we should probably head back now…” Potter trailed off, gesturing to his son who's sleeping soundly in Draco’s arms.
McGonagall nodded, lacing her fingers together. "His magic collapsed, I assumed?"
He turned towards Ginny who was running towards him urgently, legs carrying her as fast as she could. There was a large giddy smile carved upon her face that led Harry into confusion. He has never seen those smiles after the War.
"Careful, love."
Draco laughed, taking a sight on a very irritated but adorable Potter. Oh, what a cruel world he's living in.
The chocolates.
Apart from that, a successful bond from a Perfect Match could produce enough Enhanced Magic for the entire department for a year and Draco understood now why the entire department had sent him off as if he was about to fight in a battle of the century. Perhaps he was, considering that ironically, a Perfect Match must be done within twenty-four hours or the match would be nullified. Hence why the department decided to give him the assignment; he was the best shooter with the perfect accuracy. He was known to finish his assignment within record time, and he was their best bet to pull up the job. He won't let his department down by doing a poor job at it. He has an important image to maintain after all.
Albus held up the familiar ten inched hawthorn wand, as the holly wand with phoenix feather core sat firmly in Scorpius’ hand.
Ha. He talked as if they can't hear him.
Henry softly laughed, but Harry can see that the man felt overwhelmed to be standing in front of Malfoy. It promptly reminded him that Malfoy had fallen ill in the future and probably, it has been a long time for Henry to even see the light in those grey eyes.
Harry immediately shut his eyes tightly as soon as the words were uttered; frustrated with the way he felt, frustrated with the whole situation, and even more so when he could feel his eyes turned wet. He was being selfish, he knew that. They have already planned the mission months ago, they have agreed and he had tried to ignore it until the day has come and yet when it does, his selfish heart couldn't let it happen.
Zabini let out an amused smirk, “Ah, I can see where Albus got that mouth of his.” he said cheekily and laughed when Harry got flustered.
If only Harry moved faster, if only Harry knew where to find Draco, if only he was not distracted by his own battle, if only he was there with Draco, he would have arrived much earlier, he would have manage to prevent it, he would have protected him, he would not have to witness the sight of the Elder Sword of Voldemort sunk right into the chest of his lover where his heart was placed, he would not have to witness the way the light in those grey eyes dimmed, he would not have to witness the way his precious body was tossed aside as if he was nothing.
Ron snorted, “If you think-"
That tone also indicated that the person who will be on the receiving end would experience a great deal of justice. It didn't sit well with Albus to know that the person would be their older dad, even though he was pretty sure that their older dad was very much capable of defending himself.
Ah, yes.
Harry helplessly stared at the door, hoping that he hadn't screwed their silent truce. Since they got back, the Slytherin was nothing but polite not only to him, but to everyone he interacted with. It was as if his self arrogant prat sucked out of his body, leaving a nice version of Draco Malfoy behind.
“Come on!” Draco groaned, laughing when Harry growled again, bending down to bite his ears. “Don't make me do things you don't want to in public, Draco Malfoy.”
"Look," said Harry, there was no way in the bloody hell he would give when he knew Malfoy felt the same too. "Do you like me?"
Draco laughed aloud at that. “I love Granger.”
“Actually,” said Scorpius, giving Draco a sheepish smile, rubbing his nose discreetly. “We found the book in your study room.”
), or those short greetings they have shared every time they bumped into each other (
Harry ignored him.
"I know that." replied Harry, unwrapping his hands around Draco but letting a hand drop at the back of his lower waist, just because.
"It's suicide," said Harry, voice cracked at the mere thought of losing this person. "You know it's a suicide mission and I can't let you do that!"
“Well-”
Harry looked over his shoulder to see the grey coloured eyes already pinned to him. He mentally swallowed. "Perhaps your choice of a husband was wrong."
“Calm down papa, it's not everyday we got to hug Harry Potter.” said the white-blond haired twin cheekily and Malfoy blinked in disbelief as snorts and chuckles erupted from their friends. Malfoy turned to Zabini when he voiced out a remark, and they fell into a small banter. Harry decided to choose the chance and regard the white-blond twin by nudging his shoulder softly.
"And yet, here you are, crying like a baby." teased Ginny, grinning when Harry scoffed.
Malfoy cleared his throat, smoothing down his robe in the most awkward way, as if he doesn't know what to do with his hands. “I need to speak with Potter. It's urgent.”
"You'll see," replied Ron, sinking his teeth into his chicken. "They kept us awake last night."
Draco raised his brows at the black haired boy, nonplussed by the way his mind was thinking. It was a sly plan indeed, to use the Cloak to enter the Restricted Section. But first, there was one thing Draco needed to know. He turned a speculative gaze to Scorpius. "How did you know about the Invisibility Cloak?"
ourselves." the desperation dripped from his voice like water, and Harry wanted to tell Draco how wrong he was, even if he knew it was a lie.
"I'm afraid they are too flashy for my taste," Harry said good naturedly, before continuing in earnest "They are beautiful, though. You did really go —"
Was what Harry wanted to say.
With a different body structure and form?"
In the end, their long-awaited family time finally came along two weeks later, and there was no one happier than Draco.
He watched Potter's face break into a look of pure innocent confusion, "Malfoy?" the git asked like he was seeing him for the first time in his life.
"Did daddy hurt you my angel?" he kept on talking, "daddy is very sorry darling, I didn’t mean to. Please stop crying baby, it's all done now. No more soap I promise, okay?  That's it darling don't cry," the words poured out of both of them like rain, and little by little Oiliva started to calm down, her wail turning into little sniffles.
It took another whole day before they got to bring Olivia to their home at Somerset. When they walked into their little cottage in the countryside, they were welcomed with open arms. Hermione stood teary-eyed beside a happy Ron who clapped Harry solidly on the back, before melting into a cooing puddle when his eyes landed on their daughter. Molly was the first one to take Olivia into her arms, dropping a huge kiss on her forehead while both Harry and Draco tried to keep their footing straight. They hadn’t had a single drop of sleep since the trip to Edinburgh, and everything around them felt like a drunken happy daze, everyone cheering and cooing and pulling them into warm hugs. Both of them were reluctant to leave until Molly shooed them away for a much-needed bath, but a shower had proved to be the just the thing both of them needed then. Upon returning to their living room, clad in fresh clothes and a clear mind, the sight of their daughter sleeping soundly in Molly’s arms as everyone circled her, struck them with a sense of happiness they didn’t know existed before.
"Sorry," he grinned. "My eyesight is
But then, all of his doubts vanished into nothing the second he saw Draco's face when he held Olivia for the first time. And Harry watched, mesmerized how the once scared, panicked man melted away at the sight of their child and got replaced with a man who was so
"Thank Merli —"
And Harry felt his heart in his throat once again.
The rest of her bath went on without trouble. With the little episode concerning the potion being over, getting Olivia into the water wasn’t all that hard, and they let her splash about happily while both of them got the rest of the foams off of her body, swiftly pulling her out and wrapping her in a warm blanket once she was cleaned.
"There’s my baby!" he cooed at her while setting her down on his arms, and watched her brown eyes brighten, hands moving around without any aim. "Are we ready to take a bath today? Are we?" he kept on talking, walking towards their bedroom, Draco walking ahead to their bathroom to get the water started.
," Potter explained while staring at him with the same stupid smile, "I lost my glasses, you see," he said pointing at his face. And it was only then that Draco noticed the absence of the hideous round framed disgrace on top of Potter's nose.
, did he pull anyone as close to his eye level to confirm their identity. It seemed that Potter  most of the time just ignored the face of anyone he was close to. He could even pick out which was the Weasel and which was the Weaslette, even with both of them sprouting the same sort of short, red hair.
Thinking of such rubbish, he took a turn left to exit the dark empty hallway when he was suddenly pulled backwards with a hand on his elbow. The next thing he knew, he was being shoved roughly against the stone cold walls and being pinned there with two very strong hands at each side of his head.
He had also taken to asking Pansy for help, because if anyone knew about the latest gossip surrounding Boy Wonder, she would be the one. And as it turned out, there were no rumours floating about the castle that Potter had smashed his face up with some miserable cow's. It was only Draco. Only him.
The fourth time it happened, Draco was speechless.
"You will most certainly
Eight years down their relationship and three years into their marriage, Harry still wasn’t used to that damning smile of the blond man, and every day spent with Draco seemed to unravel a whole new side of him. Draco was a book with endless pages, filled with unknown stories Harry had yet to read of. And adding Olivia into the mix had only added a completely new chapter to the man he had come to love helplessly. And goddamn if Harry wasn’t mesmerized by it.
Draco fed her a bottle of water while Harry got onto rubbing the baby oil on her, and soon she was sound asleep in her clean dry clothes without a care, while both of the men stood beside the crib looking like they came from war.
"I was just out for a walk," Potter replied.

"Maybe you should admit you like my old glasses."

"This is the fifth pair you rejected, Draco," Potter eyed him in exasperation.
But that was not the point of this inner monologue. Potter was
to something. After their second proximity incident, Draco had taken special care to note the specky git's whereabouts and behaviour; watching him with the corner of his eye whenever he could. And in his observation, he had noticed that while Potter did fumble around like a blind fool without his glasses, not once,

The day their daughter was born was a day filled with chaos.
"While most may be
Harry couldn’t wait for the day she learned how to smile.
And instead of laughing at Draco's face, the sodding bastard just kissed him on the spot.
"H-how could you p-possibly do this the fourth time Potter!?" Draco all but wailed. "
He remembered trembling for his life, his hands shaking uncontrollably while trying to contact Harry, who had been gone on a stakeout for three long days by then. And after numerous attempts with failed owls and patronus charms that turned into mist every time he said Harry's name, he had broken down and called for Hermione, who was kind enough to come through the fireplace that very second, holding him up by the shoulder and telling him to pull himself together.
Love has

Hearing his name Potter tilted his head, "Malfoy?" the man enquired, just as last time. He had
Harry still remembered the casual way Draco had said those words ten years ago, his legs dangling loosely  from a window of the owlery, how easily he had fitted himself right beside Harry after that, demanding Harry to pull himself together.
Among all their friends and family, it was Molly who was taken the most with Olivia.  Even while having three sets of grandchildren from Ron, Percy and Charlie, Olivia struck a very special place in her heart. And both of them couldn’t have asked for a better overprotective grandmother than her.
Harry let out a squawk of protest, "What do you take me for?!"
It was on a bright morning, precisely three days after Olivia came into their life, that the prospect of bathing her came to light.
"Let's get you all cleaned up O-love-ya!" he cooed, "put a towel on the bottom of the tub will you, love? We don't want her to slip."
dies when you leave yourself behind. You yourself should have known this." he said coldly.
"Yes yes daddy is very wet, thanks to this little Terror," Draco said with a small huff, "now it's her turn," he said before grabbing the bath pitcher, filling it with hot water before gently pouring it atop of her head, watching her squirm in Harry's hold and sputter.
"You thought I was
"I couldn’t tell if it was
he conducted, still trying his best to recover. What in the name of Merlin was he doing, thinking of Potter's eyes like that in his presence? Those were strictly his personal night time thoughts that had no right to come out in daylight. He must still be in shock from the surprise Potter gave him. Yes, that must be it.
The third time it happened, Draco was left suspicious.
"Loves to see us in pain, doesn’t she?" Draco muttered from behind him, his voice fond despite the accusing.
"Don't let her slip."
were what I wanted more Draco!
were what I choose over everything else! That's how reality works!"
He shot Draco an alarming look, and in return the blond ran a hand through his foamed up hair once more, clearly feeling as distressed as Harry.
Potter, the insufferable bastard, actually laughed at him.
"It's just a little water, darling," he kept cooing when Olivia made little noises of distress, stopping every now and then when she got too squirmy.
"I never stopped." Draco had smiled.

Harry sighed before moving away with an amused smile, watching Draco cradle Olivia into his arms, slowly dipping her down into the tub, feet first.
After a second, or an hour — Draco couldn't be bothered to tell — Potter finally seemed to have enough of him; stepping away from Draco with one final smooch on his lips, the sound of it echoing throughout the bathroom as he gave Draco a rather pleased look.
"It feels like we've been kept apart for
And now, there he stood, right in front of Harry with those same eyes and that devil like smile that always made Harry's knees go weak, looking like everything that had happened between them hadn’t affected him at all. As if ten years ago Draco hadn’t walked into Harry's life, hadn't single-handedly consumed every inch of Harry's world, right before leaving him in pieces once more.
What in Godric's hell do you think you're doing?!" Draco hissed as he yanked himself away from his grip, stepping sideways to get himself out of the inappropriate position as gracefully as he could muster.

"Tomorrow?"
When Draco finally had enough and decided to end it all, Harry's whole world had fallen down in front him. It had taken him a year to pull himself together, but when he did, he had picked up his fallen dreams like they were his last chance at survival. And now, a two years later, he had seen half of the world, had been to places none of his friends ever heard of, working as an independent researcher for magical creatures who had already published two papers that were praised all around the world.

"What can you possibly ask of me?" Draco stared at him suspiciously. Maybe now Potter would go ahead and reveal the evil plan that he had spawned all along. Maybe he would say that he was actually doing this to get bac—
"Alright alright!" Harry chuckled, clutching him closer still, smiling into Draco's foam soaked neck.
"We met when we were
"Po—" the words turned into mush in his mouth as the searing panic replaced itself with a blazing blush that ran through his body, and in the dark he was sure he saw a smirk graze Potter's lips. He could feel Potter's breath on his chin.
"Well if you insist on picking out the worst possible choices, then surely we will. None of these suit you!" Draco countered, before looking away stiffly. "Maybe you should just, stick to the old pair you had," he mumbled as he eyed the simple black wired rims on the shelves, his face turning a soft shade of pink when he caught on to the devilish smirk spreading on Potter's lips.
Draco stared at Porter, horrified as the smirk on the idiot's face grew.
"C-can't you just accio them?" Draco forced himself to sputter out, bringing an end to his train of thought that was taking an alarming turn. He took another step back from the glasses-less idiot just for safety.

Draco sputtered before pinching his nose. "Next time, please
"When you are done laughing at my misery, a little help would be much appreciated!" he gritted through his teeth, trying his best to save his face from the splashes their daughter was descending upon him, and in turn, Harry sniggered some more, before finally taking pity on him. With the jumper rolled up to his arm, he moved swiftly between Draco's, taking a hold of Olivia with a winning grin.
"And that was enough," Harry said, and Draco swatted his arm.
After another thirteen hours of utter madness filled with tears, paperwork and bittersweet goodbyes, she was finally theirs.
then he and Draco were the perfect example for it. They had crashed and collided after the war like lightning to the ground, and without realising, they had consumed each other completely, leaving behind only the skin.
Draco, again being too lost in his inner monologue, missed the way Potter stumbled forward while talking, steading himself with a hand on Draco's shoulder at the last minute.
Draco asked in utter confusion.
"O-live," Draco called her.

"Yeah," Harry couldn’t help but agree.
"Harry?"
Getting a new place to move around in, Olivia let out a joyous gurgle, which was quickly followed by a loud yelp from Draco as the first splash of water landed on his arms, completely drenching him in seconds.
We were supposed to travel the world together! All those plans about Egypt, China, Morocco! But —"
"Yes."

Draco stared.
"Yes, Molly don't worry," Harry insisted once more, turning around and giving Draco an exasperated look from the floor in front of the fireplace "We got this."

"When are you getting your glasses?" he asked.
"Everything, yes."
The crowded ballroom room seemed like a haze; fluttering in and out from his vision like those awful muggle traffic lights that always hurt his eyes, making him irritated. It was the third function he attended this week, the last two being for work, and this one, god knows why he came.
"Say that for yourself!" Harry swatted him without realising. "I saw the uhh, the photos of your fall collection. They were — you’re really
away in that stupid job of yours. And I couldn’t murder myself like that either. One war was enough to drain the life out of us. So I did the only thing that was left to do." Draco sighed. "I let you

"Come to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow?"
"D-don't you have
"See you then," Harry said, giving her fond a nod before ending the call.
He stared at Potter for a good two seconds before whirling himself away, "G-goodbye, Potter," he said, leaving before he could embarrass himself any further.

"I believe I said that already but, yes."
"Yes," Potter nodded solemnly. "I thought you were Luna," he explained.

After watching them for a few minutes, Harry pushed himself up and walked closer to his husband, who kept rattling on about how they

"W-why are you here?" Harry couldn’t help but ask again. He needed to make sense of their whole conversation. He was supposed to be shouting. They were both supposed to be shouting at each other. Wasn’t that what exes do?
you, Harry," the man whispered aloud, and suddenly all Harry could feel was pain engulfing his chest.
"I couldn’t tell if —"
"I know." Draco mumbled.
Like cold water to his body, the airy tone sent shivers down his spine, and even in the state he was in, Harry still clung to it like a helpless traveller. He had missed that voice. He had missed
for goodness sake. The shop owner was staring at them with wide eyes.
The coat Draco made for Harry was moss green in colour. It felt fluffy on his skin while looking like it was made out of leather, and the carefully sewn patterns on it only showed themselves when the sun hit it just right.
"A hidden surprise that only shows itself to the ones who look," Draco had mumbled into his neck after Harry wore it for the first time three days after they met at the function, and Harry had chuckled.
"Can I then interest you into buying one of my designer coats, then?" Draco asked in a pleased tone, and Harry chuckled.
"Thank fuck," Draco said, dropping his head onto Harry's shoulder and Harry let out a little chuckle, watching as Olivia broke into one of her dazzling smiles.
The sight that greeted him in their white tiled bathroom floor, made his heart clench.

"No, Potter! Reality works how you want it to because it's your
"I promised to never lie to you, Harry. The moment you came into my life, I promised to never lie to you. And you needed to hear the truth in the end. I was dying, living a life like that.

"She's going to cause all kinds of terror growing up, isn’t she?" Draco muttered, looking at her sleeping face, and dropped his head on top of Harry's.
"None of those, that's for sure," Draco said wrinkling his nose.
"I just want to talk, Harry," Draco said softly while eying the empty glass in Harry's hand, his brows slightly crooking. He never liked it when Harry drank too much.
"Draco —"
"No kidding," Draco muttered, staring at him blankly. "You do know that you are allowed to leave the castle grounds at reasonable hours, being an eighth year, yes?"
"I brought you along to help me pick a pair of glasses, Malfoy. Not to reject every single one I try!"
"Watch it, Potter, you are squishing our
The Draco he saw now around Olivia was every part of the man Harry had fallen in love with. With his over the top monologues and dry humour that even their six-week old daughter seemed to enjoy, Draco was in his element as always. But now, along with all the things that made him Draco, he had this whole dimension of softness to him, this whole new side that oozed out fatherly love Harry never knew he had in him, putting Draco in a new light in Harry's eyes. At the time when they talked about having a baby, a part of Harry was scared that Draco wasn't ready for the responsibility of it all. The process of finding a mother who was ready to have them as the adoptive parents were messy, and as the due date got closer and closer, the panic that filled Draco terrified him, keeping him up at night at the thought of Draco crumbling under the pressure and just,
"She got that from you," Harry replied easily, earning himself a pinch on his hip in return.
Three years after the war when he had once again run into the blonde-haired man, he knew his life wouldn’t stay the same. Studying at the same university under different subjects didn’t seem to lessen the amount of time they saw each other. Even though Harry had taken up The Study of Magical Signature just to relax a bit before joining the Auror department, Draco and his little struts around the hallways of their University while clutching some obscure book on healing had kept him up most nights. His downright obsession soon turned into infatuation without the shadows of war surrounding them, and soon Harry found the sly tilt of those thin pink lips more distracting than destroying. He was a lost cause by the time Draco Malfoy started to smile at him.
"To study, of course," was Potter's bland reply.
—" Draco sputtered while trying to steady his breathing, his heart hammering wildly in his chest.
"What do you think of this one, Draco?" Potter said flashing him a devastating smile while sporting a thick square looking frame on top of his nose. And as much as Draco liked the sodding bastard, he scoffed.
And Draco did just that.
with most of the returning eighth years. He had a good, civilized talk with Granger and even a stiff little conversation with Weasley that had ended with an understanding nod from both sides. Hell, he even apologised to Longbottom for everything he had done in the past. Draco was half sure he was going to be sent to Azkaban with his family before, so it was a surprise when Potter spoke for them at his and his mother's trial, saving both of them from that horrible sickly place.
The sound of their laughter echoed throughout the bathroom.
"But we got caught
"Well, that was…" Draco grimaced as he touched the tips of his hair.
"My game?" Potter's voice broke Draco out of his little trance, and Draco did his best to give the man a glare with the blush he was sprouting. It was unnatural, being this close to him.
he sputtered indignantly, pushing his nose up high. "I'll have you know that the Malfoy's ar— mmpph!"  the rest of the words died in his throat as Potter's lips crashed onto his own, causing all sorts of alarms to start ringing inside his head.
Potter had seen fit to sit beside Draco in potions since the start of the year, claiming that the rest of his friends were already
Molly's face gleamed with unexpressed concern just as bright as the fire, but she reluctantly stopped with her prodding.
"You'll have the next seven years to do this, so best watch and learn for now boys," Molly had told them with an amused smile after looking at their swollen face, and both of them had nodded stiffly in return.

"You better not," Draco said coolly, before going back to his sunny self, "Let's get you all soaped up now, Olive," he kept talking while taking a hold of her hand, and with big doe eyes Olivia kept watching as Draco slowly began to rub the foam all over her little fingers and arms, his rambles never stopping.

Harry would be a fool if he said that he was content with his job as an auror. He would be a fool if he said he didn’t hate every second of going to the ministry when both of them were together. But the pay of an auror was steady and travelling and leaving things behind was hard. So he had settled for the safer option, for

It wasn’t fair. The way Draco made it all look so effortless. As if leaving things behind came second to nature to him. Looking back, Harry sometimes wondered if it actually was natural for him all along. Maybe it was only Harry who was foolish enough to not see it. He had always been foolish when it came to Draco.
If anyone asked Draco, he would say that Potter was only looking for an excuse to skip classes, and when the opportunity struck, the git grabbed it with

“Draco...” Harry whined and felt Draco chuckle against his skin. Draco leaned them back until Harry was laying on the mattress again.
But she had never been further from his mind. Instead all he could feel was heat. The once cold stone floor now burned under him. And when Draco gently pressed his tongue into his mouth, the fire engulfed him entirely. Draco moved and braced himself over Harry, his hands on either side of his head. Harry was on the floor of Snape’s old classroom and he was snogging Draco Malfoy. He could never complain that his life was boring.
“Potter. Harry!” Malfoy shouted. And it pulled Harry back enough to focus on the other person in the room. “You’re hyperventilating. And I need you to stop. You need to copy me. Can you do that? Copy my breathing.” Malfoy kneeled in front of him. He had his hands on Harry’s shoulders and was squeezing hard enough to hurt. “You need to breathe, Harry. After everything that we’ve been through, I am not going to be accused of killing the Chosen One hours after he defeated the greatest dark wizard in a century. Breathe, you fucking idiot.”
“And that’s not what Malfoy wants? Hermione told me what you did for him and his mum the other day. You think it didn’t occur to him that if you were head over heels for him, maybe he’d escape a life sentence in Azkaban? Which, by the way, is what he deserves.”
“Deal.” Harry sat up and sent a Patronus off to Hermione. She would be the least likely to go directly against his wish to be alone and rest. He still had things that needed to be dealt with. The wand in his hand, for one thing. But Draco was right. He needed to rest. There would be time to deal with the Elder Wand and the victorious dead and Ginny and Draco. There would time to figure it all out. For right now, he could stay with his old rival and just be Harry. And that was an immense relief.
