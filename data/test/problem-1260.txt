She's an eleven year old saying that she wanted to kill someone just to get their hands on a fortune that she would never get as he is no longer a Potter... I can't believe....." he never got to finish as his magic snapped around them.
Cold, flu, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, malnutrition, dehydrated, broken ribs, ankle, wrist, arm, leg, dislocated shoulder, hip, lacerations to back and anus, whipped, punctured lung. (Health potions given by Severus Snape, Poppy Pomfrey and Narcissa Malfoy)
"No Tev! Bweakfast! Hungwy!" shouted Otiz to the man but one look given by Harry as he came into the room had the boy scampering off the table like he had a Firebolt attached to him.
"Greater good my ass" mumbled Harry to himself in the common room only for a pair of shoes to come into view has he was watching the fire burning gently in front of him and didn't notice anyone come into the quite room, he was left alone to think as it was the weekend and everyone besides a few first years had headed out.
Right away Fudge appeared and saw how upset Harry was and he could almost see the steam coming off Severus due to his anger.
Draco I can forgive you for all of that but I can't forget you for being an arse to my first and only friend I had made. I'll be going to school as Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape I will never be Harry James Potter again".
When dad.... when dad found me during the summer holidays... was when I was almost killed by my uncle, didn't want me to be there anymore and so took it upon himself to beat me within an inch of my life.
They both had decided that they would also booby trap some of the doors so then people would also get attacked by their pranks... This was going to be so much fun!!!
"You have lost your say completely after we delay with you after trying to kill young Mister Snape, so I would kindly ask you sit down before I make good on my promise at your court case" said Amelia, making the girl sit down.
"The headmaster is getting stranger and stranger" said Theodore Nott to his friends, Otiz took a sniff at him and then licked him, he had promised Harry to stay in his animal form while in classes ect... but he could be human in the common room as well as the dorms.
Severus watched as Harry only grabbed three things: a picture of Lily, his wand and his robe. Severus looked strangely at Harry "is that all you're bringing?" Severus asked unsure. "This is all I own sir" Harry mumbled, this only angered Severus, how cold these stupid muggles do this to Lily's son? He didn't let his anger show, he didn't want to scare Harry. "Harry I need you to hold onto me, we are going to apparate". Once this was said, Harry came over to Severus and took a hold of his arm and they apparated to Hogwarts.
Tom in this has a Hungarian accent ok as he's trying to portray someone from Hungry, just image it if you don't know what it sounds like.
"Hadrian it's not happening we aren't going to tell you so stop asking" said Blaise only to result in him turning into a canary for the rest of the day thanks to the Weasely twins snack boxes and Otiz' magic.
"Enter" Remus came in and smiled slightly he knew he was right he had smelled Sirius within Hogwarts and it was so strong here in Toms office! Now where was Padfoot?!
"These dunderheads don't know how to even gold a spoon. T for Troll, it's bad" there was red marks all over the work he wasn't even reading the work to grade ithe was so annoyed, tears streaming down his face.
"Every good now onto the blood adoption, you do understand that with that he will no longer have the blood of the Potters or the Evans line within his system. He will still get his all of inheritance from his birth parents but he will be forever Heir Prince but on the records he will be a Snape. Is this truly what you want?" the last part was namely directed towards Harry who again shifted.
"Otiz get your furry little butt over here and stop pestering dad and his friends" came Harry's voice making everyone jump as they weren't expecting it.
"Hadrian calm down ok" said Theo who rested his arm on his shoulder making the boy take a deep breath.
As this Covid-19 is going around and that I have to self isolate due to my health and a very bad mould allergy thanks to the harsh winter weather we had, which has made my chest weak, I can update more often than not..... I hope everyone is healthy and safe..... stay safe people and dont go out unless necessary ok....... Sumire 🌸🌸
"Mister Sötétség if you could share your views as I don't think we need anymore evidence due to what we have here" said Amelia to the court room who all nodded in agreement.
The three left just as they were pulling into Kings Cross station, Marcus had ended up within the compartment of Harry and his friends.
"NO you stupid thing she won't live if you don't let go!" screamed Otiz making werewolf Remus let go blood sprayed everywhere and Sirius came to inspect the wound that his best friend his mate had given her, he tutted.
Every saw this and all wanting to know who this was and so Albus got up and walked over along with Severus and Remus.
"That's right Remus, Harry is now Hadrian and no won't answer to Harry, he has improved greatly after getting his ex friends away from him, just Miss Granger is bullying him now, Dumbledore is out of office as you both can see I am now Headmaster.
He once again stepped a little closer to the boy "Harry it's quite alright. Do you know who I am?" Severus asked his voice gentle. Harry then looked up from the floor to stare at his Professor, he was so confused "P-professor?" Harry's voice wavered, Severus only nodded. "Are you ok? Who did this to you?" Severus asked, Harry then became very interested in the floor, he then started to cry and Severus wasn't sure what to do so he reached out and placed his hand under Harry's chin to lift it up. As soon as Harry looked up, he did something that surprised Severus and himself, he launched himself into Severus' arms.
He knew what each one was saying which at first shocked him but once he got over it he loved his gift that Lady Magic gave him.
"The goof if spoilt rotton by my son... Don't even think of saying no to that because I know that you have given him extra raw meat compared to his normal meals" said Severus to him only to have Harry blush.
"This is yummy" said the little high pitched voice that seemed to be a young female, what Draco heard was pure England while Harry heard Parseltongue.
This made everyone in the court room gasp, the boy sitting next to the potions master looked nothing like Harry Potter so who was the boy? and why did Albus as for an unknown boy to a court that was to do with Harry Potter.
"Lucius this is meant to be a surprise for the end of June beginning of July for their birthdays we need to make it special!" said Narcissa
"What in Merlin's beard, Otiz what's gotten into you of all things?!" cried out Harry as he was pushed into a wall away from whatever he had seen.
These only stopped when they finally were able to leave on the 28th of June and they would be back on the 11th July, two whole weeks away.
When he said that Hogwarts noticing the magic and the words ripped her house badge of her cloak she was wearing and she disappeared into an unknown room, which only had her book, clothes bed and table in, in a very much smaller room was a shower and a toilet. It looked like she was going to be there for quite a while.
Otiz called curled up on Narcissa's lap purring away due to being scratched behind his ears. "Hadrian when did you find this beauty, I have never seen anything like him before" she said.
Sirius just sighed he didn't want his godson anywhere near Severus but if the man had helped him and saved his life there was nothing else he could do, he was in Azkaban for most of the boys life he didn't really have a say anymore.
"I forgot that you can also understand that language" said Severus as he ruffled his son's hair making it look like the birds nest it used to be.
Severus was downstairs in the kitchen drinking some coffee with a small fry up in front of him while reading the paper which was floating when Harry came in.
"Do you want to tell me what that was all about Otiz?" asked Harry but the boy only sniffled into him more, Severus left the room only to come back with a sippy cup with blood in it for the boy.
Otiz noting the change in magic around Albus pointed his finger at him and said "you is meanie" then snuggled into Remus.
He tried to find his wand or anything that would help him but all he found were some books, magazines and what the hell was that box in the corner of the room?
I showed him the documents that I carry around mind you these are just copies to our esteemed Headmaster who didn't even look at them again, afterward we both left".
"Lupin get out of there before something bad happens to you as I don't think Hadrian's familiar will hold on much longer" said Severus and out came a sandy haired man wearing worn out clothing, looking like a right mess.
"Oh... Hi dad" he mumbled but he knew his father heard him and Severus have him a look to say 'either tell me now or we will talk about it in a detention tonight'.
I don't care if I'm caught or not you will pay for what you did to my family, my sister of all things!! You Snape are are nothing but a wimp and has to hide behind this stupid thing..." and he went to kick Otiz only to have his foot stopped by a hand and a wand pointing into his neck.
"Potter just get up from there right now!" Ron's voice getting louder making Harry shrink he hated loud noises.
Once the poor boy had let his father finally up, they changed clothes, yes Severus went for Muggles clothes as well.
"Pott- I mean Snape.... Merlin that's freaking, I'm sorry for being an arse to you over the past year or so can we let everything go and finally be friends?" said Draco to Harry who was now looking fully at him while drinking his tea.
Mister Weasely follow me please, I would like a private word with you and what you have done to the rest of your peers. This is not how a Gryffindor should act much less than a human" and she storked off having him following, still blabbering his secrets as he went.
"Ah Mrs. Weasely what can I do for you today?" she asked ignoring Ginny, "well I need some new robes for the twins they've jet again Merlin knows what on them again, it's easier to get some new ones that try and fix them" laughing.
"Oh ok...." he wasn't sure about this so Poppy stepped in this time along with Minerva and Narcissa.
Remus just continued to laugh slightly and tapped his shoulder and walked out with the rest of the staff who were also giggling at what the hybrid had called him.
"Miss Cruise I will say this now so then everyone here and hear what I have to say "I am his father now, I adopted him in August, after what I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life...." he was going to continue and say what had happened to poor Harry but he was cut off by crying.
~stay away from him, you smell of danger and blood, you touch one hair on his head and I will kill you~
Fifth memory from the age of seven, thrown back outside in the dead of winter and had gotten frost bite
"What Severus is trying to say is that he has been called to the Ministry for a trial for someone has declared that his isn't your rightful guardian and so....
Within seconds they were crawling to the top of the tower and then it dropped, Lucius and Harry screamed in joy while Sirius screamed in terror at it all and mumbled "let me off" over and over again not liking it.
I was going to make you my Heir in everything including blood but when Severus gave me your reports it was I that suggested that he adopt you both in writing and in blood to keep that coot off of you so then you can have a normal childhood with him.
Remus just sighed and sat down, "this boys is my friend Sirius Orion Black, Lord of the Ancient House of Black, who is the cousin of Narcissa Malfoy nee Black and Hadrian's old godfather" explained Remus.
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is now in prison after being brought to court I wonder what is going to happen to him now, will he stay there or not??, I have plans don't worry
The twins ended up going into their room and sat down on the floor in between their beds plotting on how to help Harry.
I... I mean we would like something to be done about him, he shouldn't be allowed to treat anyone like this much less so than a young boy" explained Severus to Fudge.
Arthur stood in the office but once Minvera gestered to the chair that his daughter had just vacated he sat down, Severus sat in the other and bridged his hands on his lap, in thinking but the others to knew he was annoyed.
"Mr. Cruise I would like to know why you think it's a good idea to pick on a fellow student and one that was once apart of your own house" said Severus to the boy.
"Oh yeah I forgot about that as well, oops Mother and Father won't be happy with that. I have also heard that the new Headmaster will be joining us as well".
Harry was at lunch when it happened again, he had just put a small portion of mash and some turkey on his plate and was about to eat when Ron and Hermione came over.
"Hello Harry my name is Remus John Lupin and I was a very close friend to your parents James and Lily, I'm so sorry about what happened to you back then, I wasn't in the country to help you at the time.
"Ok Professor" said Harry as he slowly got up from the bed slowing his overly large pyjama top and bottoms to Severus who looked disgusted with them "when we got out we will be getting you some new clothes as well" and with that Severus left the room having Harry follow him as they headed towards the bathroom.
"Oh it's away from her, upstairs now" said Molly once she noticed her daughter had finished her food, "up early we have to go out and when we get back the garden" Ginny moved upstairs moaning and groaning as she went but her parents ignored her.
His hair lay completely tidy on his head thankful that it was no longer looking like a bird's nest on top of his head like it normally was, it was now smart and neat, it really was a combination of James and his own hair.
"They know I'm the smartest witch around!" she stopped and thought for a moment, yes that must be it! She must be here because she was doing so well they thought that she would be better off to study without any distractions in place i.e. the other students.
"What......a...are..... we....we going..... to tell.......eve....ever....everyone" mumbled Harry quietly but didn't get an answer until Severus sat down placing some plain pancakes in front of Harry while he handed him the fruit as well.
"It's Otiz! He's really mad about something" explained Theo who was now squished between Blaise and Draco shaking.
"Very well Madam Bones but please call me Tomas..." and he smiled at her, she nodded and he continued.
I think you need a lesson on how to act and how taking someone's familiar could harm both of them" said Flitwick to her.
"Very good young Heir Prince, we will begin shortly after everyone has stepped up to their places we will begin right away" as Griphook said this another twelve Goblins came forward and spaced themselves evenly around the Faustian Mark and began chanting.
Severus slowly got up with the help from Remus, Otiz was again glued to his robes holding tightly too it while Severus went to the dorm Harry shared with Blaise and Draco.
With introductions finished they finally go onto the important business that they were called here for.
Yes he knew but he wasn't going to tell on them after what he had learnt from Severus and Minerva as well as Ron saying what he said last night, it disgusted him.
Severus and Remus where shocked, more so than Severus, the fuzz ball was now a teenager! What had happened now!
"It has come to my attention that two......" he stopped when he notice his voice had changed to something that was very high, squeaky and very girly.
If I was lucky enough to get something to eat it would most likely be a mouldy piece of bread, a couple of crackers if I was really lucky and a glass of water, that was it.
Everyone looked at where it could of come from but no one had their wands out.. no one knew who is was but she was now unconscious.
"Dumbledore it has come to our attention that you have been making past, present and future students, including making Hadrian Snape go against He Who Shall Not Be Named.. " everyone shuddered besides Dumbledore of course.
"Where in Dumbledore's name is my wand? I can't do anything if I don't have it, I need to get out of here, I need more books to read and to tell the teachers that even the brightest witch can't finish these they are just way to hard.
Dinner was a very fun event in its self really, everyone still had animal ears and tails and coloured hair and every so often fireworks would be going off as well as the fire crackers, one went off right under the staff table making Dumbledore squeak due to having mouse ears.
"So Maxie we heard you went nutters again saying that there was a World full of Witches and Wizards and that your name was Ron Weasley" said the twins laughing at him.
"Hadwin me pway?" only for Severus to pull out his toy snake and the toy wolf that Harry had named Mooney.
He clamped his hands over his mouth trying to stop himself but he couldn't they are now coming thick and fast.
Otiz was again out for her blood but knew it wasn't the best time or place to do that so he would wait for his time and being the type of animal he was he could wait as long as possible.
"I would be but my son has had a massive panic attack due to your lion that's meant to be in isolation...." he left it there for her, wondering what she was going to say next.
You are not allowed out of your room unless called for, you are not alowed out of this house unless I am with you, you will not be allowed to talk to any of your friends if they send an owl I will be the one to reply to them.
"Thomas Riddle get off me right now or I will hex you! I don't care if you were once Lord Freakin Voldemort I will hex you into outta space if you don't let me go!" Tom did showly.
Tom laughed at it all and hid his wand from Severus and winked up at Harry who laughed at his father's sigh.
In the Great Hall, Tom was looking out for the Muggle born that tried for remove him from office for no reason besides she thought he was in the wrong.
"Really Sev I've been with Hads since Christmas and you don't even know who I am" and he turned away.
"I was asked by Albus to check on Hadrian, I found him locked in his room barely breathing he had many broken bones, a collapsed lung, he was dehydrated and malnourished, I've only just managed to get him to eat about half of what he should eat.
"Ah Severus just the person I needed to see. I have a list of potions that I'm running out of, could you possibly make some more for me please. Mr. Malfoy why are you here??" she asked them both only to stop at hearing three voice shouting at the only patient in the ward.
Fourth memory from the age of six, being stuck in the cupboard for a week with nothing to eat or drink.
"Harry we will tell them that I have become your guardian, that is all. Your name has been changed on the school registers now you are Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, my son as of three weeks ago.
My aunt finally told me that my parents were killed after Hagrid told me that what they had told me in the first place, that my parents were drunks and killed themselves and that they were lumped with me because of it.
"What are they doing here!" he practically screamed making Harry flinch and curl in on himself, this made Otiz come to his defense, his parents looked on at their son while Severus tried to calm Harry down.
Albus was furious at those blasted twins! Everything now was ruined! How could they do something like this! Yes he was paying their younger siblings and the know it all girl, for some reason he wasn't able to bribe the other Weasely's. Damn it all to seven pits of Hell!
Minerva was fuming and they could tell right away and just turned to one of her lions and said "please bring Miss Granger to me at once and if you can get all the evidence I would be thankful for" the student nodded and left the room to get Hermione, only for Fred and George's friend hand over everything that she had gathered up.
It was all his fault that Harry wasn't back with the Gryffindor's, the Headmaster as well as his relatives! Harry should of been back where he belonged but she didn't want anything to happen to her like it did with Ginny being treated as a Squib and Ron now with the Ministry not knowing his fate was killing her.
"Ok so, Hadrian what's the matter with you all of a sudden?" she asked making everyone else nod all wanting to know what was wrong with the ex golden boy of Gryffindor.
"We are meant to be together!" she coughed out as he tried to get up but with Otiz' magic swirling around her it was impossible everyone could see his type of magic.
"Hadrian have a drink and something to eat it might help relax you more?" said Severus handing the boy a cup of tea, with his normal, well normal amount to Harry, of milk, Harry just looked at him and shyly took the cup of him "thank you..... dad" was mumbled to him and then slowly but surely he started to have a drink.
"Ronald is in the Muggle World just because he wanted his best friend back! You... Everyone here shunned him and then he lost his magic!
"You stupid girl, never move from a predator they will only kill you faster" said Otiz his voice now gruff and sounding a hell of a lot older than what he truly was, she was still screaming and he did the one thing he knew, he put his hand over her mouth to stop her, silence was golden at that moment.
"Daddy, daddy I have the freak! Can we go home now? seeing him has made me want to play a game, plus he has all his missing chores to catch up on. Right mummy?"
Severus sat there for a few more minutes thinking that his son was asleep he went to get up but that when he was hugged by a limpet and wouldn't let go so he brought him to to the living area and placed on his lap on the sofa.
"Oh hurry up" whined Otiz which sounded like his child form which made harry laugh non stop making everyone smile, since Severus had decided to adopt the boy back in his second year they had seen more and more smiles and laughs coming from him then any of them knew what to do with him. he was really coming into his own person.
"Your sorry your damn brat just admitted to over five hundred people, teachers and students alike that she was going to kill my son...MY SON! She should be the one to say something like that not that I would accept it to be honest.
Otiz glared at him, his glare was on par with Severus but it had no effect on Harry anymore living withe Severus made him immune to it all.
Harry finally turned round and met Griphook in the eyes and then he sighed "very well young Heir Prince we will get to it right now, but I have to warn you that it will hurt. That is something that I can guarantee you on that and I am sorry".
"Hadwin puppy!" shouted Otiz making everyone in the hall look at the small boy in a long white stop with dark blue around the cuffs and black shorts and black shoes.
Hermione didn't know what to say as she knew they belonged to her and would get into trouble if she said that they weren't but if they she didn't she would get into more trouble. She didnt know what to do either.
My uncle would beat me so many times with so many different items his favourite would be the belt or even the bat, I would come out bloody and bruised but I thought that was how a family acted I knew no different it only got worse when my letter came...."
Suddenly an owl swooped in and landed on his desk, right away he asked if he could collect the letter from the owl and Professor McGonagall just nodded she wanted it out of her class for the time being.
"Draco calm down Hadrian isn't saying anything because he gave up the name Harry James Potter the day I adopted him and so won't say anything to you until you call him by his new name" explained Severus to Draco as he placed a cup of tea in front of him, his son and then sat down himself.
"Miss Granger I will have to give you detention about trying to steal Mr Malfoy's familiar during your detention I will explain what is right and wrong with how you have acted just today alone, first class of the day and you are already in trouble.
"I guess but will it hurt?" was all he said making Lucius almost laugh but it was Arthur that stepped in.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy you will stop this petty childish behaviour now or so help me" sneered his father making both Draco and Harry jump in their seats. Draco hung his head and sighed while Harry turned his head into Severus more and gripped tightly onto his robes still crying.
"Yes little one we are, but I don't know about your hair? Can you change the colour of it by any chance?" asked Severus.
She went and sat down on her bed and saw a new book sitting there which was nothing but a stupid story book something called Tales of Beetle and Bard, how was she meant to pass the stupid time with nothing but a child's book?!
Severus and Tom both knew Harry would be back for the three others he didn't have them and he had a thing for collecting things if they were in a set, it must of come from Petunia always neat and tidy and if something as part of a collection she had to have it so then people would envy her, so then she would be the talk of the neighbourhood.
Harry was getting ready for down to Hogsmeade he needed time away from his father and his friends.. they were like children when they got together.
Ron and Hermione looked towards Harry and Otiz and cringed at him, not liking how he was looking at them.
"Otiz..." was all Severus said making the hybrid jump over to him and almost onto his lap but stopped at the look he was given.
"You Sötétség will be out of here once I speak to the Governor's of the school board, they will reinstate Professor Dumbledore and you will be out of here!"
Once they were back at Hogwarts. Severus and Harry walked down to the dungeons, they took many twists and turns which made Harry very confused he had never been in this part of the dungeons. Severus stopped abruptly Harry could only look up at him and wonder why, Severus looked around and whispered "Horned Serpent".
"Please Mister Snape I would prefer that you sit on the bench instead of the table" said Filius getting up on the books.
Otiz then nuzzled his way onto the bench next to Theo who he licked on his face making Harry laugh at what Otiz was doing.
"Quit fussing over me Poppy, I am fine" he said to her but he knew he had a concussion from the impact of Albus' out of control magic a.k.a. his tantrum.
"So your shoes are up there again?" he said as he looked up to them and sighed before he could help her get them back down he was pushed landing on the floor making Otiz growl at who ever it was when he looked he was it was the stupid know it all or at least she thought she was smart enough to be classed as that but even Crabbe and Goyle were beating her at exams.
"Tom Tom!" he was bouncing up and down like crazy, like he had eaten a month's worth of sugar (A/N please don't do that people you'll just end up I'll)
"Come on Hadrian let's go to bed, we each have our own rooms, two to a room really and as I have a spare you'll be sharing with me...." he leaned in close and continued "plus it's close to Uncle Sev so it's ok" this made the boy smile slightly but still didn't move from his spot.
Draco and Harry had decided to play chess mind you Harry was awful at it but he was slowly getting better, he held onto his wolf for comfort but he too was slowly falling asleep.
Otiz right away jumped up and hissed and then went to attack who ever it was but ran into the corner of the room only to yelp out in pain as he hit his head.
I walk towards the edge of Hogwarts once out of the school's boundaries I apparated to 4 Privet Drive, it was late in the evening, the only light that could be seen was the street lights. I spotted the front door and went straight to it, looking around I saw no-one so I pulled out my wand and whispered "Alohomora" the door opened with a soft click, not loud enough to wake anyone.
"Hi...." Harry hid right away from the man dragging Otiz with him now that he was back to his animal form, growling at the man.
Harry wanted to go over to her and ask what was wrong but all she said was "thank you" and showed Lucius and right away and he took it out and place it around her neck.
He was interrupted by Severus saying "Albus how dare you! He has had way to many near death experiences just in the past two years from his uncle's beatings alone! If you won't take him out of that damn household I will remove him myself. I'm not bluffing. Good evening" and he was gone.
Once at their table Draco pushed Harry in being the right gentleman he was brought up to be making Harry blush.
Inside the room Harry at in the middle of the room, crying hugging his two stuffed animals tightly, he wanted Otiz in here with him but somehow he couldn't get into the room and he didn't know why.
"You told her to look for me and Draco, Tom that's just mean! how could you do something like that I don't spy on yours and dad's relationship".
"How did they find out anyway... I mean Mr and Mrs Weasely?" at this he looked straight into onyx eyes.
"I can't believe our Saviour has turned into a slimy snake of all things, what is the Wizarding world coming to? What do we do when He Who Shall Not Be Named can come and get us and kill us all!"
Earlier, right before school year ended. Harry was injured in a Quidditch match Gryffindor vs. Slytherin, Poppy had nursed him back to health yet again and sent him on his way, but when he was in a coma she did a full body scan and found out some very interesting things about one Harry James Potter.
"Molly and Arthur sent a howler to them as you know we saw them over Christmas, made friends with most of the Weasley family he loved Molly but when Ronald and Ginerva mostly Ronald started to abuse Hadrian, Otiz went on the attack they only stop thanks to Molly and Arthur coming in.
"Ok Otiz I'm done here for now lets see what we can  do until tomorrow while Hadrian packs his things, have you seen Tom?"
Draco came running in half and hour later claiming that he had finally finished his homework but stopped once he saw Harry and Severus in the lounge talking to his parents.
Harry had been staying over at Malfoy Manor for the first half of the summer holiday as Severus had something to do i.e. potion collecting as well as planning Harry's birthday surprise as everyone had been keeping it all hush hush from both boys as it was going to be a joint birthday present to the two, even Otiz had been told to keep it a secret in his child form, mind you he was told in his teenage form so they all knew he would do.
"Sorry Theo he's upset about Granger, that's all. He doesn't mean to do that honest to Merlin he doesn't, this just means I have to sort it out as he's very stubborn" said Harry leaving the group to talk to his familar.
"Otiz shuush" said Harry and he kind of stopped only to hide under the table but kept close enough to Harry and Severus ready to protect them at any cost.
"Otiz calm down, you being angry won't get Hadrian to open the door, come with me and I'll explain what happened when we were out" said Severus.
I can't believe what I've just been told about one Mr. Harry Potter for crying out loud, how the hell did he manage not to let anyone see as well as tell anyone, Merlin he must be in so much pain, I need to tell Albus about this right away.
"Dad I don't really want to go home now" moaned Harry as he packed his bag as they were leaving the following day.
Madam Sprout came into the greenhouse and saw the stranger, she smiled towards him but he glared back at her. ((Image Sev's glare and insert it here))
In Gryffindor tower Hermione was sitting on the sofa, cushion in hand screaming into it as Ron and Ginny came walking back in wondering why she had stormed out from Potions.
Severus was dressed in a white shirt, black trousers and highly polished shoes, his hair was drawn back into a low pony tail, he had decided that his back robe was too much as he would look like he normally did at school so decided on a dark blue robes with silver lining and buttons.
Everyone looked towards the youngest male Weasely in shock, all the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws that Ron had bullied all stood up!
"To be honest I don't even know why we are here everything seems to be in complete order, I would like to pass round the file to the court so then that can see" and she held a file which was labeled with both Harry's birth name as well as his adopted name and the court case number.
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU HAVE HURT YOUR FRIEND RONALD WEASLEY! YOU WERE HIS FIRST FRIEND AND NOW THIS IS HOW YOU ACT! GINERVA DONT FOLLOW IN YOU BROTHER'S FOOTSTEPS I THINK YOU HAVE FOLLOWED THE WRONG OLDER BROTHER HERE!
"Pansy if Dray won't buy you any do you think I will, I need to get some quills and then finish my homework before my father finishes what ever he had to do today, we are meant to have some father and son time, plus I have been invited over to the Malfoy's for dinner tonight".
The day of the meeting was here and it looked like that both Minerva and Severus had decided to take the task of Headmaster for the day, half the day each and the rest of it working on completing their lesson plans and marking homework, Harry wasn't happy that he wouldn't be spending the day with his father but when everything was explained to him, he left it and told him that he would be in Hogsmeade with his friends and Otiz.
A door slowly formed out of the stone wall and opened to reveal Severus' private quarters, Severus allowed Harry to walk in first. Harry looked around in amazement, there were books everywhere, the walls were a dark green, there was a black leather sofa covered with papers, Severus then started towards a room with a closed door, Harry stayed put, Severus then turned around to look at Harry.
He passed over to the two of them and dropped something unceremoniously onto their laps, it was pure white but when Harry took it into his arms it gave off body heat and it smelt like lillie's of all things.
At the end of the feast Otiz was out cold and was happily snuggled on Severus, everyone made their way out of the Great Hall but Albus had other plans.
We also can see some blushing relationships starting we all know about Wolfstar 🐺🎆 and everything but I wonder what is going to happen to Remus John Lupin and Sirius Orion Black?, how is their relationship going to go?
"I thought I told you lot to be careful! You Mister Fuller will have detention for the rest of the week, where you will clean every cauldron from the lessons as well as help me with preparing the ingredients. CLASS DISMISSED!" he bellowed at the end making everyone leave as fast as they could.
That snake loved him as well as Otiz, she wasn't so sure about Draco but as she had said "mate is mate" what ever that meant to him, he didn't care he was just happy that he could have private conversations with her and she wouldn't tell as soul or at least she didn't tell Tom he hoped.
At her detention with Filius, he was trying and failing to teach her the Freezing charm but she kept going on and on about Tom being Headmaster and not Dumbledore and what ever he said he was screamed back at by her.
Once settled in bed Harry just kept looking around not wanting to sleep but he was so tired he couldn't keep his eyes opened but he was forcing himself more than anything.
The tape measure wizzed around him and Otiz had to stop himself from chasing it due to his mixed heritage. He so wanted it.
"What cans Grippy helps with?" he asked nervously twisting this pillow case in his hands a nervous habit he had picked up just recently.
Albus was enraged the Weasley idiot had been cast out in front of the whole school! In the Great Hall no less! Why in Merlin's name would he do that!
Most of them have been placed by Albus Dumbledore but I do think that all twenty seven of them were placed by him, some have broken before the cleansing.
"Draco, Nott and Zabini I want you three to make sure that Hadrian here is ok while I go and speak to the Head of Griffindor, don't let him out of this room" said Severus pointing to Otiz who was now snarling at anyone that came into the room or even close to him.
"Pomona can you keep an eye on Hadrian for me please, I know he has a double with you next" asked Severus to the woman further down the table who nodded and smiled at him.
Noting that Otiz was lost for choice Harry glanced at his dad who tapped on the toys, he now had snitches one stuffed and one interactive, a children's toy broom, a toy Quidditch set that let you play out games.
"He then started to tell me and Professor Lupin what the was supposedly told by Hadrian's relatives that what he had been through over the past eleven years were just accidental mishaps but both is us, Professor Lupin and I knew he was lying, this was all after Hadrian and Otiz had left of course.
"What are three stupid little lions doing in with the snakes, you know we are poisonous" he cackled slightly to them.
The twinkle in his eyes had gone and he yet again threw everything off his desk including his most precious lemon drops.
"Yes dad!! I can't wait can we see Mrs. and Mr. Weasley as well as the twins?" he asked almost jumping up and down like an excited child.
Burnt chest, cut to cheek, cut to lower back, frost bite, pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydrated, rash on bottom
"Hadrian is having a panic attack after he was verbally abused by Weasley, asking why he was in Slytherin and not in Gryffindor like last year" explained Draco to her while leading Harry over to a bed.
"If I can't even be bothered to even write my own classwork, I love having a self writing quill best thing I ever bought".
Once they were finished they headed out, down to the bus stop and into town, which by Severus' surprise was huge he hadn't spent much time here as he would always stay in the castle over the smaller holidays and then during the summer he would go off and look for potion ingredients around the world, he never really went into town.
"I went to school with them and your father James kept my secret about my furry little problem, I will tell you more about that later if you let me that is".
Severus had tied his hair at the nap of his neck and wore sunglasses, while Harry had a cap on his head and a pair of sunglasses as well.
It was not 10 am and they were finally getting ready to head over to the Malfoy's, Otiz wasn't sure about the whole travel by floo thing but he was with Harry and he knew he would protect him, like he would protect him and Severus.
"As you know the Longbottom's are in St. Mungo's at this very moment and as for Black... Well that is another completely different matter that we will get to at another time" said Severus slightly adjusting himself as he now held a sleeping Harry in his arms.
"But..." she was stopped by her mother as she thanks Madam Malkin and left the store dragging a persisting Ginny behind her.
Narcissa came in with Draco following her wondering why they had to have a talk bout some stupid guests coming over of all things, all he wanted to do was to be outside practicing his Quidditch nothing more, nothing less, he hated having these kind of talks first thing in the morning.
"Sorry Mister Snape I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable it's just fascinating he is able to transform into three different types; animal, child and of I had my guess teenager" and he started circling Otiz again.
Tom just sighed at this but at least he had a somewhat plan he could use to help him get back to Severus, the only thing he needed to do was find out his favourite chocolate and plan the food which was easy enough, a nice three course meal and some wine and Severus' favourite film and he hoped everything would go as planned.
"Before we do the adoption papers I would like to see a full medical history of Harry and then we can see what we can do afterwards" this made Griphook smile again and out of nowhere pulled out Harry's self updating medical report, he passed to over to Severus so then he could read it.
As the day went on Ginny kept blurting out how she was going to be Mrs Harry Potter, she had gained many a detention from the teachers as she kept interupting them.
She headed up to the Headmasters off not caring in the slightest that she was missing out on one of her lessons, she at this moment in time didn't care.
"Don't even think about it young lady, I'm using the same spell I used on you when you were a mare tot so" Molly didn't finish as Madam Malkin handed her four pairs of new school trousers which were going to be sent to the twins later that day.
Just then a firework went off sending Otiz up in the air and hiss at the twins he almost bit them but stopped when Harry laughed, the firework sent out little pictures of the houses this one was a dancing Hufflepuff logo.
"I can get your shoes Luna" said Otiz as he transformed into a larger size of his normal form and gently picked up her shoes and handing them to her.
"I am Tomas Marvolo Sötétség" and he sat down once Amelia nodded in his direction, then she turned to Albus attorney.
The train ride home was quiet but still loud but not as loud as it would of been in the Gryffindor compartments. Harry was reading a book on Astronomy for some unknown reason he found it interesting, Hedwig was sleeping on the over head compartment while Tyki was sitting on the bench next to Harry.
Both boys by the time they have arrived at their dorms they had both silently vowed to protect the young boy who was now their friend and not the boy who lived, he was just a young abused boy that deserved friends and a family of his own.
"What in Merlin's beard has gotten into that man of late!" she almost screamed but stopped as she had patients resting.
Hermione wanted to say more when a large dog came out of the shadows and growled at her, Tom just signaled to it that he was to do no more, the girl was just leaving, it backed down.
Werewolf Remus noticed the change in the air, his mate was trying to protect his now extended pack but the stupid thing was there being protected by the fox that now looked human, he snarled only for Otiz to snarl back at him, him being more dominate at the moment as he was protecting their cub, always protect the cub more than anything the cub was the most important.
"I was called into the office during lunch as you know and when Hadrian didn't turn up the Headmaster flipped out asking where he was and I told him that his named had changed and Potter doesn't exist, then he told me to go and get Hadrian".
"Harry or should I say Hadrian now, is fine now he was rescued the summer just before his second year by Severus..."
"Oh stop staring will you" sneered Otiz as he headed toward the Slytherin table and placed Harry gently on the bench and sat down next to him.
Everyone sat down in their places Otiz even had a booster seat right next to Harry, in front of plate he had a sippy cup full of blood which made Draco cringe at the thought about this little boy would be drinking blood.
Otiz switched to his teenage form and smiled to him as he watched Harry head to the bathroom to wash and get ready for the day.
"After you sign these documents Albus Dumbledore will no longer be his guardian are you ready to take on a teenager" smiled a very happy but evil Griphook, Severus just smiled and picked up the quill from the ink pot and signed away on the parts needed and the handed Harry the quill to sign the last part, once the quill was lifted off the final signing point magic flowed through the room, making a magical contract making Harry Severus' son from this day forward.
The reports showed nothing out of the ordinary for a baby a cough or cold here and there nothing alarming to be said until it reached the age of two and then it was bad and I mean really bad.
Ron and Hermione were pissed, now they are sporting weasel ears and cat ears on their heads but what was making everyone laugh more was that Hermione had whiskers growing, the same with Ron.
"Snape!" sneered Ron towards his ex Potions professor, it was a sneer that Severus would be proud of if he hadn't bullied his son.
As they were walking to the zoo, yes Harry had wanted to go back to the zoo even after what had happened last time, letting the snake loose by accident. What it's called accidental magic for a reason!
"Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore" Otiz hissed to them, this made everyone shocked if they truly thought about it, it all made perfect sense!
"Harry it's ok, can you look at me please? It's me Professor Snape, can you please look at me?" asked Severus to the scared boy, who slowly but sure made eye contact with the man in black. ((sorry people had to say it like that, I am watching men in black at the same time as writing this))
"You know there isn't any student called Potter in Hogwarts anymore" said Severus as he ran his callus hand through his son's hair.
He wanted to know that one word but he had promised so he was going it alone to the best of his ability.
"Welcome to another new year at Hogwarts! I would like to welcome all the new students that have come this year to start their education but I would also like to welcome a new teacher to our staff this year..." he trailed off when Remus looked at him and stood up, he still had a bar of chocolate in his mouth as he completely forgot about it.
The following morning as the students walked into the Great Hall for breakfast they noticed a man sitting up at the Head Table, a select few knew who he was but they said nothing.
"Come here goof" said Harry, "why don't you go see dad and Professor Lupin, I know you don't like him but he seems nice enough" and he pointed to his father and the sandy haired man.
You will stay in isolation until the end of year, you will lose points but it will not affect your house, at any point you are not part of any house from this moment in time".
Percy got up and looked at his much younger siblings in disgust and after what seemed like hours but was only minutes he finally spoke to them, making sure that everyone in the Great Hall could hear him.
"Get out!" screamed Harry to him, to Albus of all things, this made Otiz go on to attack and there now standing on the floor was a fox that was twice the size of a normal fox, his blue fur so dark now it was like the night sky, his emerald eyes glowed dangerously and he had something like steam coming from his mouth and right away he threw Albus to the floo and right away the Headmaster was now gone.
He slowly put his knees down and grabbed some toast and butter, Severus saw what he was doing and so got some yogurt and some mixed fruit and placed it in front of Harry as well as some pumpkin juice.
"Thank you for coming Mister Flitwick, Madam Sprout, Pomfrey and McGonagall as well as Lord and Lady Malfoy and Heir Malfoy, Lord and Lady Weasely, Heir Weasely and lastly Mister Weasely I know this was all short notice but it has come to Gringotts attention that Lord Prince would like to blood adopt his son Heir Hadrian Snape".
They made him do House Elf work, treated him least than an House Elf to be the better term really, they raped him, broke his bones, he was locked in a bloody cupboard under the stairs for ten years, there is so much more but you don't need to know that.
"That is Hadrian's familiar Otiz, he can take one of three forms, his animal form that looks like a light blue fox but he is in fact a hybrid animal, next is the small boy you see who is about six and then lastly a teenager of fourteen.
"I am Nairi and I'll be looking after your apartment during your stay" and she smiled again, this in turn made Harry smile as well.
Poppy came out of her room after counting her stores and making a list of the ones she needed to hand to the potions professor.
We do not see your name or Ginerva's name any where on the Ministry's records you have never belonged in the Wizarding World after Lady Magic took your magic and bound it.
Once in the kitchen he spotted Severus who was once not in complete black, he had a dark grey top on and black trousers on and dark dragonhide boots, he was sitting at the table drinking his coffee, reading the paper with a plate of pancakes in front of him, Harry sat down and started to each his breakfast.
"With Lu-Lu and Tommy!" and he spun around and giggled as the three walked out of the Hall and onto their second lesson.
"They wouldn't leave me alone dad" was all that Harry did to him only to have Ron and Ginny rebuttal saying that they did nothing wrong.
"When we first met at Madam Malkin's before first year, then on the train. If he had taken my bloody hand back then, none of this would of happened!"
"I am his father now as you know I have given you copies of all the documents from both Gringotts as well as the Ministry there should be no reason why my son should go back there!"
At the end of class Ron stepped right in front of Harry who in turn cowered to him but Otiz being back into his animal form, he was now bright red with anger, static flying everywhere.
And so the group split up: Harry, Draco and Blaise as one and Theo and Pansy as another. Otiz had made sure that Draco was with Harry because he meant safety for his familiar.
The staff members saw what he was on about, the Dursley's where right in their faces, the poor boy was so scared!
Severus sent the young blond a glare, by Merlin he hated that name from his godson, Draco just ignore him sand carried on with what he was saying.
"Otiz don't go eating the quill again or I won't get you more meat from me" said Luna making everyone laugh.
He snarled at them, she was by his mate no one was allowed by his mate unless they were in his pack which was only him, Sirius, Lilly, James, Harry or should we say now Hadrian and now it also included Severus Tomas and Draco all by fault of them being in Harry's life now.
I have helped you in more ways than you will know, after you killed me I was left for dead as particles and I traveled around and over the last few years managed to come back to what you see me s now.
"Lupin make yourself useful for once and pick out some clothes, ones that are in the age range of five to seven years old, we don't know how quickly he will grow so I would rather cover all bases" said Severus looking through a rail of clothes.
~Says the idiot that let the girl out of punishment and angered his boyfriend~ she curled up on top of the cover she had stolen in front of the fire.
Severus noticed this right away and so pulled out copies of Harry's medical reports from both Poppy and St. Mungo's and placed them in Albus' desk once again but he didn't look at them so Remus took hold of them and read through them getting angrier and angrier.
"Miss Weasely it is a child, a scared child for that matter, it looks like young Mr. Snape's familiar can take a human form" said Minerva to everyone, Albus wasn't happy.
"Just wait until I tell the headmaster about this you two will be sorry, if not I'll tell your mother" she said as she got up and walked out of the hall.
"Getting those three together is worse than anything in the world" said Harry once his food came which was nothing but a simple ham and cheese sandwich with a small salad. He had made sure that he had ordered Otiz a rare steak and placed his blood next to it.
"What's happened?" everyone turned to Otiz wondering what had happened between the pair but all he did was sigh and then transformed into his animal form and headed up to bed.
Otiz listen to the whole thing, he was in his child form drinking his blood, Harry and Severus had yet again managed to get him to wear something different than his normal colours, today he was wearing a purple top with a silver dragon on and black trousers.
He dragged Harry to the Whomping Willow making Otiz and his friends follow not liking where this was going.
The last present for the Malfoy's Harry was slow to give it to Narcissa as he really wanted her to be surprised and once he handed it over she opened the small box and right away began crying.
"Severus I think he's completely out cold now" said Pomona as she got up to sign her name on the parchment like everyone else did, lastly Severus signed his name.
Otiz wanted to sit on the bed as well but the wasn't much room anymore, if his sat on his hunches it might fit but if he laid down no hope in Merlin was he going to fit!
He had hated the whole thing and then someone offer to buy him something and so did his father. He had had nothing like this before, yes he had gone on holiday during Easter break but this was something completely different.
As they came round the corner, Otiz squealed he saw something he could have fun with as a boy and as his normal self, a interactive toy snitch!
Tom was filling in some paperwork with Sirius under his desk sleeping, he so wanted to be with Harry but he wasn't sure if that was a good idea or not, he knew Remus must of known he was there as well but he again wasn't sure and so decided to stick close with Tom to be on the safe side.
"No it won't but you have to think of certain time frames for us so then we can take them and place them in the Pensieve, just like we did before with Severus ok?" as he explained everything.
Harry looked at the letter not really knowing what to do and so pocketed the letter until after dinner, he wanted to tell Severus about this right away and he knew he had to wait until just before dinner to tell him.
Then Otiz noticed Tom who smiled at the boy only to have said boy look at him making his eyes flicker red like Tom's had done.
"Ok Mister Weasely I would like you to hand over ALL of your quills so then I can keep them and you will serve detention with Flitch as well as Professor Flitwick and Sprout, during your classes you will be sitting at the teacher's desks so then they can keep an eye on you!
Oh finally peace and quite now that all the brats have gone home for the summer, I wont have to deal with them for six freakin whole weeks, I can finally relax and work on my potions that I have to prepare for the hospital wing and make my own personal ones as well. Awe the bliss of it all.
"No I don't care! He has made the worse mistake! How could he take one of the greatest Wizards to court over nothing! I tell you that freak has lied about everything!
"He's about six I think, but his lisp makes him sound younger than he is" said Hadrian as he sat down on the sofa in the living room again.
He was clutching his head in pain and so rushed to him right away and without Albus even noticing Poppy had taking Severus to the Hospital Wing.
Grumbling up the stairs she noticed right away that the door was missing meaning she couldn't even sneak out!
"I will leave her like that for a bit longer, come on now its time for dinner" said Percy as he got up from his seat and headed to the common room door leading everyone else out while Hermione carried on venting to no one.
He took a deep breath and took hold of the goblet and started drinking, my Merlin it was horrible, the rusty taste in his mouth, he wanted to spit it out but at the same time he wanted to keep drinking so then he would be finally out of Dum-Dum's filthy hands that wanted to use him for his own stupid little game.
"Now I must tell you about him, he is a cross between a Japanese cat demon called a Bakeneko and a Kitsune which is a fox demon. His eyes will change shape depending on the day and the emotions of our young man that's he has bonded to, his fur will spark when touched but will not hurt those that he trusts, he will lick blood, he will walk without making a sound to others but those who he trusts will hear him, he will keep his wildness but again to will be gentle with those he trusts. He has sharp teeth and claws, has nocturnal habits and they have abnormal speed and agility and that is his Bakeneko side, from his Kitsune side he can shapeshift. Please feed him raw meat when you eat and he will stay with you always" said the teller.
"Hadrian... could you come with me for a moment son" said Severus just loud enough not to wake the sleeping child on his shoulder but loud enough for his son to hear him.
"Oh Remmy, Remmy what have you done to her, she's going to become the one thing that you hate the most, she's going to become a werewolf. Oh my love" he slowly walked over to him and werewolf Remus hunched down and whined to him as if to say sorry.
"Ru'et pwease" mumbled Otiz into Severus' chest making the Malfoy's all look at him wondering who he was talking about, while Harry brought over his toy snake.
Severus got up and went to the spare room and knocked "Harry it's alright, it's just me. I'm not going to hurt you come on out" he said but he got no response from him and so he tried again, still nothing and so he slowly opened the door.
"Come along now you two it is past curfew now, and I would also like you two to listen to Professor Snape on this please don't tell anyone of what you have learnt" said Minerva as she led the two boys out of the private quarters and back to their house for the night.
"TEV TEV me bored! Tommy no funs!" came the voice Severus was hoping he wouldn't hear for the day as Otiz was being a pain and not matter what they said he wouldn't calm down.
He had to get the boy.... no the brat back under control and fast and if taking that bat to court he would do anything in this power to get it!
As all of them were leaving the noticed Hermione looking at them all and went onto the verbal attack once again but instead of listening to her the group just walked passed her, the shunning in fall force like it was with Ron.
I adopted him for his protection, I have also made the Malfoy's his godparents and I also asked the Weasely parents as well to be godparents as well, hopefully they will accept.
The portraits of the past Headmasters all looked at him and then looked at each other, some commenting on how he was acting.
"My name is Hadrian Snape, I'm not longer Harry Potter I was adopted in the summer!! Just leave me alone will you" said Harry to is ex friends they weren't happy at all.
"I'm not Harry Potter" said Harry loud enough to be heard but Jacob didn't believe that, and smirked "you are Harry Potter you are a spitting of James Potter one of the best seekers of all of Hogwarts history and so are you Harry!! Why in Godric Gryffindor did you leave?" shouted Jacob to the now whimpering and shaking Harry.
Fudge had always wanted to get something on Dumbledore and this had to be the most juiciest tip bit he could gather.
Harry was beside himself, he just couldn't wait to go to the theme park, when Draco's birthday was upon them Harry just couldn't sit still as it was soon going to be the day that they would spend at the theme park with his family and he just couldn't wait for it to come.
On the other side sat Dumbledore in a grotesque robes of snot yellow green with bright purple Patten's that changed every so often and his lawyer, who was a Squib who no one really cared for their name and if it was said they completely forgot it.
"Otiz Hadrian Severus calm down or I will bind you to the wall for a week!" said Harry getting up from between Blaise and Theo, walking to Severus' private rooms, locking it.
"I want to do magic I don't want to be a bloody Muggle! What would my parents say about this?" asked Ron to them but Tom just smiled at him.
"Minera, Severus" said Arthur but Molly said nothing to them she was furious with her daugther how could she do something like that, she had warned her children but would they listen no........
When my client young Mister Snape lost his biological parents at the age of fifteen months due to who he may not be named and then placed with his ex relatives on that cold Halloween night he would have died then.
Hermione looked at the book she was given and saw that she knew it by sight, it was the first years potions book! Why in Merlin's name did the fake Headmaster give her that?! Her grades were at the top!
Harry was happy enough but something in a window caught his attention more than anything and went over to have a look at it, it was beautiful, the gems in it could be replaced to but anyone's birthstone it in, it was perfect for Narcissa and he smiled and called over Severus.
On the platform every student was either saying goodbye to their friends or trying to find their parents or even both and once Harry stepped off the train he heard a voice he never wanted to hear but he did.
Changing back Otiz glared at him, "pray tell me Hadrian why you did that, you know my nose is sensitive and it hurts!" Harry just laughed at his familiar.
Harry had never seen that colour before what could it mean?! He wanted to know but at the same time he didn't.
"You idiot I told you not to do something like this but you still did!" screamed the gentle man who loved his chocolate.
They carried on talking about what was going to change in the school, Remus not noticing the dog laying next to the desk as Tom ran his hands through the fur.
Minerva was not happy, she had made it completely clear what would happen to him if he carried on but would the boy listen to her or even his own parents from last year's Howler, nope.
"Miss Weasely this is not how a student yet a young lady of one of the Sacred Twenty Eight families should act, you are a lady and should act like it" said Minerva.
BULLYING IS SOMETHING ONLY COWARDS DO AND I HAVE NEVER BROUGHT UP MY CHILDREN TO BE COWARDS OR FOR THEM TO BE BULLIES! NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS!
"Ron just leave them we are in enough trouble as it is" said Hermione as she tried to get around the six others who were heading into the classroom, everyone in the hall was watching, waiting to know what would happen next.
Minerva sat back in her chair and sighed this was going to be a long rest of the year, who knew her lion's could be so vicious!
It had been weeks so far and none of the pranks had stopped, everyone still had animal ears and tails as well has their hair was still a different colour, even if they had changed colour over and over again, it was almost Easter and nothing was being done to stop them.
That felt nice and he wanted to have that done to him again and so let Narcissa help him with the memories.
"I think it's time to go to Gringotts now as they are expecting us along with Poppy and Minerva as well as Filius and Pomana" and with that they all headed to Gringotts.
Now I you would excuse me I have to do damage control on my son that you have cause. Oh and if you try to get rid of Lupin due to his furry little problem you won't have a.... Oh what is the Muggle saying.... Oh yes that's it... a leg to stand on!" and with that he left.
"Draco please give me a name and I will guard you like the hybrid Kitsune that protects Hadrian" said the Occamy.
"Well Miss Weasely it looks like you too are in some trouble, I think both Porfessor McGonagall and I would like to have a private word with you in... your office Minerva? or mine?" said Severus to Ginny before directing the last of it to Minerva.
"Sir what has happend?" asked Rioghnach Byrnea she stood up and slowly walked over to them, Otiz growled at her, pupils going into slits, he was scared, nervous and angry he didn't want anyone near his family at the moment.
Meaning that it would be the Weasely family, their two oldest  Bill and Charlie; who he hadn't seen since his first year about Norberta, were coming to celebrate with them they had managed to get the time off, Theo and Blaise were coming as well as Draco's friends.
He next looked over at the other three red heads at the table, he took an instant like to the twins and licked their hands right away, Percy on the other hand would take some time but he knew that he would stick with Harry no matter what after what had just happened.
"Hystrifors" muttered Harry but it sounded strange as he kept trying not to laugh, as he was about to try again and firework and fire cracker went off making everyone scream.
Soon they were on the Smiler which made Sirius full on ill as he was going through loops and that strange smiling face wasn't helping him at all they others loved it and found it funny, they were soon off the ride, Remus had to help him off with the help of Arthur.
Harry had a hard time choosing between the Rook or the Wedge Tailed Eagle feather quills and so he got a couple of each and a lot of dark blue ink bottles.
"Oof! I'm going to be sick, just leave me here and go on without me" and he laid down on a bench, only to be pulled up not five minutes later by Harry and Otiz.
Soon he was wolking back to his office to stew on what he had learnt from Harry and Otiz, chocolate and a romantic evening just the two of them.
"I can't believe you Harry of all things, nothing can be that bad to have Snape adopt you!" said the last voice looking at him with disgust.
"Headmaster please I am the boys father and as his father I am allowed to join said meeting, he is underage to attend a meeting he or his parent feel that it is something bad. I would also like to say that his name is Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, he is no longer Harry James Potter how many times do I have to tell you" snapped Severus at the end of his speech.
The next morning you could tell that they were walking on dead feet, their eyes had bags under them, they were not hyperactive and blubbery and they looked like they were in fact zombies.
Once the hallway was completely clear besides the five students and one teacher, Ron finally let go of Harry's elbow, he ran right into his father's arms and cried.
In the Griffindor common room Hermione was trying to convince everyone that Tom was a bad Headmaster and that only Dumbledore could be Headmaster and not Tom!
His uncle also said that he refused to help around the house, that he made his cousin Dudley do everything while he was out playing with his friends at the park".
"Yes love he yet again says his name is Ron Weasel.." she was cut off by his satin "it's Weasely, my name is Ron Weasley how did I get here anyway?"
"What in ghostly name are you doing there, my lesson on the Goblins War's is in no far complete, go sit down" and right away he was back talking about the Goblins.
He got off the floor; hand tightly in Otiz' fur making sure to ground the pair of them but Otiz' eyes had changed colour, they were now a deep dark purple......
Draco, Blaise can you take Otiz for me please, he knows you two more than anyone else in this form. The reason why he's holding onto me is because he doesn't feel safe".
"Everyone sit down and be quite for once in your miserable lives " and he glared at the older years and at a few of the younger as they were still talking quietly.
Otiz was climbing all over Sirius as he was tall and started pulling his hair to make him move to have a look around more which he happy obeyed they fox turn boy as it was him that had locked him into his Animagus form, they were soon whispering about what pranks to pull on everyone.
"Ok mister time to get you some toy's to keep you occupied" said Severus who was now carrying the child, who had buried his nose in his neck since Madam Malkin asked him to change his clothes.
In the Great Hall everyone was wondering what was happening Dumbledore's chair was empty and it looked like the rest of the staff members didn't care about it, one or two yes but everyone else nope!
"I think you're right, him being six and stuck inside isn't helping him, he has too much energy, yes we have the garden but it's really not much".
Severus rubbed his back and glared at the students before him "twenty points from Gryffindor each for bullying and detention both with Flitch for a week each to you Mister Weasely and Miss Granger. I suggest you two go to your next class" the pair fled the office as fast as they could.
"Draco listen and listen well, I will not have myself repeating what I'm about to say am I understood?" asked Severus to the blond boy opposite him, only to gain a nod.
"So Poppy hasn't told you yet? well I was informed just recently that Mr. Potter's household currently at the residents of 4 Privet Driver is unsafe for the child. Albus he's a young boy, a second year at that, he has been abused since he was three years of age......" I replied sadly. Dumbledore could only stare back incomplete shock "Severus my boy, I'm afraid that I'm aware of this already. It is only safe that he is with fami-" Albus was soon interrupted by my uncontrolled temper, thank you father for the only thing you gave me. "Albus how dare you! He has had way to many near death experiences just in the past two years from his uncle's beatings! If you won't take him out of that damn household I will remove him myself. I am not bluffing. Good evening, Headmaster" and with that I stormed out of Dumbledore's office, only to leave behind a very shocked blue eyed man.
"Professor me and Blaise were walking to Potions with Hadrian..." Draco was cut off by both Ron and Hermione saying his name was Harry.
"Tev sowwy" and he went over and hugged the man's legs, said man looked down at the child and sighed.
Tom didn't know what to say about that 'meanie pant' really?! Severus Tobias Snape had called him meanie pants! Oh he was going to be having words with him about that if only he knew how to get back into his good graces, like he used to be.
He smiled at them but they still weren't Otiz his beloved nutty hybrid familiar, without realising his spells that he had place broke and the door opened.
The following day Harry had to wake up Severus even though it was 5am in the morning which Severus wasn't happy about.
Tom still hadn't worked out how to grovel to Severus it had been three weeks and he still hadn't a clue.
"Fine..." said Albus twinkle in the eyes gone, but only for the time being. Otiz stood next to Hadrian not moving, breathing deep fur starting so change to a blood red colour.
"Otiz I want to introduce you to a very close friend of mine, this is Hedwig..." said Harry pointing to the snowy owl on his shoulder who had just finished of her treat "...Hedwig girl this is Otiz..." he then made sure that they were both looking at him, even though one had meat handing from his mouth, "...I want you both to get along with each other and no fighting, please" both nodded and then went to groom each other happily.
"Snivellus! Of all people it had to be Snivellus Snape!" said Sirius as he paced the room trying to work out how he was going to get his godson back from the slimy snake  (I'm sorry sevvy)
It must be a joke of some sort yes that was it a joke, they must be testing her to see how quickly she was able to finish it.
"Albus I ask you to stop this right now or so help me I will leave this office with my son and go and talk with the Minister right now and have them send over all the paperwork regarding this matter" he sneered.
Harry just laughed out loud making everyone look at him again but right away turned back to their lunch.
As they were out for the evening students went about studying after their time in Hogsmeade if they were allowed to go that is and one third year was completely banned until further notice, the teachers weren't going to make an opportunity for her to attack a fellow student if she was in Hogsmeade.
"I'm sorry Hadrian.. as I was saying I didn't mean to do any of those things, killing your parents when you were but a babe.. I'm sorry.
It was becoming the norm for them on holiday at the park, get up, wash and dress for the day and then head down for breakfast, order that they wanted, either talk mushy to each other aka Charlie and Tonks as she liked to be called instead of her real name Nymphadora no one minded much but is was kind of a bit to much.
Harry and Draco left the classroom and headed to the stairwell to the office and once they got their Severus was waiting, having let his class go to the library for the rest of the period.
"Still I think I'll spy on you lot then" walks over and takes Otiz waking him up, him going full on fox form growling.
I know about all the hardships you have been through as I have been through them myself in some way or another and I want you to remember that you are no longer there, you are my son Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape and you will always be.
As the two headed out, Tom called out to then "just don't get caught, I don't want to have to hide a scandal as well as all this paperwork!"
After dinner the adrenaline of Lucius and Harry has faded and they were soon asleep on the sofa together, they had been running around the park like small children and going on any of the rides they deemed worthy of them and their thrill seeker ways, Harry they could understand but Lucius it was different they had never seen this side of him before it was quite refreshing to be honest.
I didn't have any friends at school that is if I was allowed to go but once the officers came stating that I was meant to go at the beginning of the year, which by that time was now after Christmas they started sending me.
"I can see this monster isn't helping you Hadrian" said Tom sitting down on his bed and placed Otiz on his lap and started helping him pack for the year, nine months without being at home but at least both his parents, could he count Tom as his parent, he wasn't sure yet, were going to be at the school so he could always visit but that wasn't what he wanted, he wanted to be able to see the Weasley family even if that meant he was near Ginny, yuck!
As of late Harry had been feeling that he and someone watching him all the time which was kind of unnerving but as Otiz hadn't kicked up a stink he knew that person wouldn't of harmed him right?
"Ok everyone we can look he's closed his inner eye lids we are fine to look at him" said Tom going to check everything of the now basilisk Harry.
Harry was looking at this man who claimed to be his parents best friend, yes he wanted to know more about them but now he had Severus as his father. What did he want more? To know his birth parents or not?
The charms potions and blocks to tie the magic so then they would not exceed a certain level and to make them easier to bend to your will it is stated that Gringotts that you have permission from the family to do so and when we checked with their parents or guardians that nothing of the sort happened.
Otiz is a light blue fox with the same coloured eyes as our Harry, he is very protective of Harry, if you want a picture ask me
Everyone did as they were told including Otiz who's fur was now a bubble gum pink, "I would like each and everyone one of you to read the chapter about the Hystrifors charm and I would like an essay on it and then at the next lesson I would like you all to perform it. Points will be added for how well it turns out design wise that is".
He ignored her and once her rant was done he carried on "Albus Dumbledore is now in Azkaban due to what he has done, I am not liable to say but he shouldn't of done any of it, Miss Granger I will not be changing the office as it fits my needs".
"Have a drink little one and you'll feel better. You missed out on dinner last night, you slept right through it" and he handed over the cup to the little boy, who was still snifflering.
The Weasely line has one Heir by the name of William Arthur Weasely and two apparent heirs by the names of Charles Anthony Weasely and Percival Ignatius Weasely and the Prewett has two co Heirs called Frederick Gideon Weasely and George Fabian Weasely.
"What's going on here!" shouted Minvera to the class making Harry whimper slightly at the sound but Draco had it covered, he started to rub his back before he started to have a panic attack.
He stood up making everyone look at him he just said "Granger what are you doing with my familiar I've been looking everywhere for her, you stole her off me! Who knew you would stoop so low to steal someone else's familiar's, just because you can't get one!" he went over to her and Coco went right into his hand and up his shoulder to wrap around his neck.
"His name is Harry Potter and I'm going to marry him, or kill him when I get my hands on him! He should stay away from that slimy snake he's calling his father, both of his parents are dead, he should stay with his loving relatives" interrupted Ginny.
They arrived at Malfoy Manor where they were welcomed by all three Malfoy's in the Floo room but when the three Snape's stepped out they noticed Otiz in Harry's arms.
They were soon unpacking for their two weeks stay, everyone had a room to share, the Snape family (Severus, Tom, Harry and Otiz), Weasely's (Molly, Arthur, Percy, Fred, George and Ginny who would be sleeping on the floor), Malfoy's (Narcissa, Lucius, Draco, Blaise and Theo) Bill, Charlie and Dora as she liked to be called all roomed together like Sirius and Remus were.
"He's so cute" said Narcissa as they waited on some refreshments to come before they all headed for dinner.
"Me always can, just no wanna. Wanna stay with you, no weaving behind gain, I lonely" was all he said before he started to drift off to sleep.
In the forest one bushy haired girl was trying her luck to save the day like she thought she could do with no help but she stopped when she noticed Sirius on the floor groaning at being thrown.
Severus' gifts consisted of two potion journals from Draco, from Narcissa he got some rare potion vials that were made from crystal which had his name engraved on them and from Lucius he got some rare potion ingredients. From Harry he got some new black robes with green and silver detail on them as well as some potion note books with the Slytherin house logo on.
"Who are you?, you look like a second year with your frizzy hair and buck teeth" said Sirius as he got up and looked around, "damn in the forest again, just like my Hogwarts years, I miss them", looks around again ignoring Hermione all together as she tried to tell him but failed to tell him who she was.
"Lets" was all that the two males said and within ten minutes everything was signed and went to the Ministry to be filed along with the adoption papers into the Snape family vault.
"...with this" the twins finished as they piled on some more eggs to their plate, making her huff in annoyance at them, they got away with way to much as it was.
But as he kept reading he was getting paler, if that was even possible, he was shaking with anger and grief! How in Merlin's name did the boy live though all of this.
"Well we are expected on the following day after Yule so..." said Severus to his son who was now half asleep which made him smile towards him, it was late after all, ten hours on the train for Harry and an awful end of term teachers meeting was not what Severus called fun and so they headed up to bed.
Yet again Dudley was banging on the glass of an enclosure scaring the poor animal inside, inside the enclosure it was a Komodo dragon.
After breakfast Harry was tag teamed by Ron and Hermione asking what on earth had happened, but Harry didn't want to say anything and so stepped back slightly only to bump into his father.
"Professor McGonagall how nice to see you please do come in" said Harry to her but she just shook her head and motioned for him to follow her.
Uh... So annoying. Three grown men acting like school girls talking about their youth and who they once loved.. yuck nope and so he decided to drag his friends; Blaise, Pansy, Theo, Draco and of course Otiz into Hogsmeade for the day.
"Thank you Draco" said the newly dubbed Coco as she fluttered her wings slightly as she got comfortable on his shoulder this time. Her tail over his right and her head on his left.
They left his memories alone thinking that it would drive him into insanity which he tried to do with Harry but in Ron's case it would just make him look like he was crazy.
Once they had the quills and ink they left Luna as she was meeting up with some of her friends, not knowing that it was Hermione she was meeting up with.
"Otiz just marked you as someone he can trust, he's done that with everyone so far that he's met, me on the other hand he took a bit of my blood after I gave him his name" said Harry with a yawn, Otiz bounding over to him.
"All of you miserable lot into my office right now!" he was beyond pissed. Harry just whimpered in his arms but followed his fellow students.
Not really wanting to help the man up due to what has been happening helped him up with disgust. Albus once on his feet pushed Lucius away grumbling about 'stupid blonde haired pure bloods' and walked back to his bed and stared up at the ceiling having nothing else better to do.
Severus closed his eyes and remembered what his father used to beat him, he quickly snapped out of it and stared into Albus' eyes.
Harry has changed back and forth from phoenix to basilisk again and again, it seemed that his magic was starting to settle by the end of the day near curfew he transformed once again this time he was a combination of the two which made Otiz growl at being frighten away making the other three in the room jumps as well at the sound.
Otiz sensing this came out from under the table and turned into his human form, making Minerva change back.
The twins and Draco were trying their best to help Harry over come his shock which took about half and hour but he was soon calm enough, he was holding onto Draco as he tried to get up but he was shaky but otherwise fine.
That child was never cared for until he was taken in by Professor Snape last summer, I thought your father and I brought you lot up to be respectful and not harm others! You young lady are grounded and I think most likely Professor Snape will go to the Ministry about you planning to murder the poor boy as he is his father now.
Harry didn't know what to say but he knew what Tom was on about the snake in question had caught them a number of times, it was like her personal mission to spy on them.... unless.....
After two days of nothing but Christmas fun Harry and Severus were now getting ready to head to the Weasely's for a small Christmas celebration which Harry wasn't looking forward too...
"What was that for?!" snarled Otiz transforming into his human form but he was ignored which didn't help his anger, after helping Harry back up he went over to her, his green eyes glowing.
"D....dad....." whispered Harry to Severus hoping that he was heard only to have him hum a response to the child at the table.
"Mr. Malfoy, I think it would be best to wake up young Mr. Snape and take him to his bed for the night, he has permission to head to Hogsmeade tomorrow and for the foreseeable future so if you all want to go I would head to bed now" and he smiled a very slight smile and the group packed up their homework and headed to their dorms while Draco went about waking up Harry.
Father- Benjamin Albert Anderson, 38 years old, black hair and deep blue eyes. He is a Shop Manager for the local supermarket. AKA Ben
By the end of the day Poppy finally came towards her, she looked so annoyed that Poppy had forgotten about her of all things, she had been knocked out!
"That boy the insufferable dungeon dweller, I need to get that brat back on the right side and not have that snarky dungeon dweller have him otherwise my whole plan will be ruined and I can't have that".
"Mr. Malfoy, Otiz take Mr. Snape to the infirmary right away" said Pomona as she cast a Patronus to Severus to tell him what had happened.
"Get Hadrian here now!" said Blaise to everyone in the room, the commotion outside Severus' office was heard and both the occupants tan out to see what was wrong.
"I wonder what those two are up to?" said Ginny to Ron and Hermione only to have those two look at her but said nothing as they both knew that they were in enough trouble.
"Can I ask all the first years to head off to bed, I'll explain more tomorrow morning when the rest of the remaining years get filled in" said Severus to his house, the first years all headed to bed.
He looked over it and when he as the name on top of the parchement he almost fainted Harry Freakin Potter again, why did that name always come up and bite him in the arse, he would never know.
The boys weren't looking forward to going back to the school, Harry was grumbling while he was packing which was slow going as child Otiz was taking the stuff out gain which wasn't helping he was also hiding all of it.
All four of them along with Lucius walked over to Ron who was now wondering why he felt strange, he looked to his parents wondering why they were their then to his sister who looked sullen and withdrawn.
"If I had known I would of got him out of there. I would of saved him from what he has been through" Remus was angry and upset, this wasn't helping his wolf who was crying to be released.
"Son it's due to the blood adoption, you have my blood in you as well as James and Lily, more so me then them if I had to guess really. You won't need your glasses anymore and I have to say you hair is now sitting quite nicely" and he chuckled again at his son's expression.
Harry hadn't seen her properly since everything had happened and over the summer holidays and that was almost six months ago, she cooed at them and then jumped up onto Harry's shoulder and nuzzled his face, he was elated to see her and right away took some of his meat and gave it to her and while she ate he made sure that Otiz had his dinner as well.
"Is there any place you want to go to?" asked Severus to his son who by now was wiping blood off Otiz as he had yet again spilt his blood.
"Miss Granger what on earth is this that you've given me?" asked Filius when he came to hand out all of the homework and singled her out!
"I've slept with almost everyone in the Hufflepuff House both male and female, they are just so easy"
"Miss Granger please, it doesn't have to do with that at this very moment what I want to know is why you would be selling test questions, classwork and being allowed to use a self writing quill to complete all your school work without the knowledge of being caught in the act?" she asked getting more annoyed as she explained everything that was sitting on her desk.
We also have Sniddle if no one knows it's Severus Tobias Snape and Tom Marvolo Riddle relationship which I think we need more of, it's a nice relationship in my book. Tom is known as Tomas Malakai Sötétség and he's been living in Hungary before coming back as a Lawyer and then he becomes Headmaster.
"Hadrian are you alright?" as he walked further into the compartment Hedwig hooted and Tyki cawed and Otiz purred if you could believe it.
She then rounded on Harry and his friends who were looking at her in turn wondering what was going to happen next.
Tom ignored her until he sat down behind his desk in an overly comfortable chair, pushing aside some parchement an ink that he had been using before he went for a walk to clear his head, once he was done he turned to her.
Being a teenager he can easily snap at anyone which makes him transform, in his animal form he is as big as a tiger with the same temperament.
Remus smirked at Tom's face knowing full well that Sirius had been wandering the hallways in his Animagus form when he wasn't meant to be, he glared to Sirius under I desk trying and failing to keep it away from Remus.
"Every well, I am the godparent of Draco and I would like to know if it is alright with you to have his parents, Lucius ad Narcissa, to be yours if that is alight?" Harry almost spat out the last of his pancake over the table.
In McGonagall's office a faint knok could be heard from outside and so she let them enter only for over half of her lion's to enter, she was shocked.
"So next is the blood adoption, all paper work will be kept here and a copy will be sent to the Ministry once everything is finished, everyone over the age of seventeen will have to sign the documents to make it official, the only one under the age who will have to sign it will be young Heir Prince" said Griphook as another Goblin bright in a different dagger and a goblet.
"Otiz stop that right now" said Harry picking up the clothes that he had thrown on the floor only to make the hybrid laugh and run off only to be picked up by Tom with a new ring on his finger, it was the Prince consort ring Severus had the Slytherin ring, it looked like they had finally gotten more forward with their relationship unlike him and Draco but they were now only 14 so they had a while left but smiled.
In came bounding Otiz who had licked his face that now it was dripping but Harry only laughed at his antics, Severus was in the doorway smiling slightly.
".. the lad was only eleven years old at the time, you made him do this. We have looked into his records as well as everything that has happened and I must say we here at the Ministry are very disappointed in you".
Once they had entered the boy darted out and headed to his room that was always there and locked the door even before Otiz had time to comprehend what was happening.
She flew off making a few of the student wonder where she had come from and landed on Hermione as she was reading her book and not focusing on the lesson or what Coco was up too.
Severus looked at his son who was crying quietly into his shoulder, he knew he wouldn't stop for a while but he knew he had to do the last part of their plan, it was time for everything to be fully removed from inside his body and then the blood adoption.
"Welcome back third years, this year we will revise Mandragora or better know as Mandrakes, and the severing charm as well as Puffapods and Stinksap as well as de-fanging vampiric vegetation" said Pamona to the class as she went on about what they would learn in finer detail, the strange began to wander the classroom.
"Otiz calm yourself child. Come here and I'll explain to everyone" said Severus sitting his his chair, he placed Harry on his lap, who in turn curled into a ball, Otiz crawled up his lap as well as held onto his robes.
Your wand will be with me or your father at all times, you will not be allowed to use magic you will act as if you are a Squib. Do I make myself clear if I do hand over your wand and head upstairs to your room.
The day came to an end quicker than normal, Severus and Lucius were enjoying some fire whiskey, Narcissa was stroking Otiz as now he was fast asleep, while Harry was curled up on a chair asleep book on his lap, Draco was also out for the count.
"That's fine Draco", soon all four were up in the air playing they were being watched over by Severus and Harry's house elves Boris, Mink and Yahtzee as Narcissa and Lucius were working, Otiz was curled up under the table where their snacks were waiting for them.
We also know that Ginvera Molly Weasley has now become a slave to the Weasley family as her magic is also been bound, she in other words is a Muggle slave, I don't condone slaves in no way shape of form it's only for the story ok!!
He gasped in pain and shock making everyone come to him as he panicked due to his past, Otiz came out of nowhere and picked her up by the neck.
