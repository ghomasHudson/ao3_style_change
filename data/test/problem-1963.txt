Potter’s looking at him, worry in his eyes, and suddenly the room feels way too bright. Draco reaches over and grabs his wand, spelling the curtains closed, and a blissful dimness washes over the bed.
Trying to distract himself from the anger blooming in his spine, he decides to go through the department doors at random. This is the first time he’s been allowed loose in the department since he’d been tricked into going in by Voldemort as a teen. That was… seven, eight years ago now, right? He’s just turned twenty-three.
He makes himself get up, and then he eats and showers and steadfastly manages to avoid thinking of Potter for nearly half the day. But as evening falls, the loneliness begins to prickle at his back, and soon enough the prickling turns into a stab.
“I suppose it’s all right,” Draco mumbles, still feeling like he’s in shock. Then Potter slides his arm around him, palm flat on the small of Draco’s back, and he can’t help himself—he shivers and curls closer, pressing his face to Potter’s chest.
It would be so, so easy to reach out and touch him. To take his hand. To give away his own feelings.
“I was the Chosen One. Now I’m just Harry,” he says, unable to help the tinge of bitterness of his voice—he resists the urge to tack on, ‘
“Oh! That thing,” Harry cuts him off, thoroughly relieved. “No, I mean—yes, I’m over it. Er, it’s fine,” Harry says, and then decides promptly that he’d like to sink through the floor rather than face their looks of sudden suspicion.
“What—what is it?” Harry asks, breath ragged. Lust is spiraling through every bone in his body, urging him onward, making his chest burn and his erection throb, but just for a moment he pauses just to admire how lovely Draco looks like this.
“I don’t know about that,” Harry says, thinking with shame about how even now he’s lying to Malfoy, about all the insults he’s hurled over the years, about the scars scattered over Malfoy’s chest.
Harry shakes his head. “No, twelve hours is fine,” he says, convinced he’s going to hate himself for this afterwards, even as Malfoy gives him a look that almost feels like gratitude. Harry Summons a couple of shot glasses. “Afraid I don’t have measuring cups.”
“I don’t understand,” Draco says, shaking his head and staring off into space. “We’re not mated, so—so why did it
“So?” Harry asks, eyes meeting Draco’s. And then, slowly, he pulls Draco’s hand towards his mouth and presses his lips to Draco’s wrist.
“I wasn’t going to do anything. But my temper decided for me, I guess, and they ended up with elephant heads for a while.”
“I've only ever used magic,” Malfoy countered haughtily. “Whatever. I’ll go along with your stupid idea. Now get away from me, I think the Gryffindor is starting to rub off.” And then he walked away, leaving Harry to wonder how exactly this was going to work and why he had even suggested it in the first place.
“Are you sure?” Astoria says, and he flushes. Okay, sometimes he enjoys making fun of Potter in the papers, and sometimes he goes on talking about him a little more than he really should. But that was
He swore after the last time taking the Amortentia that he wasn’t ever going to depend on a potion again. But he wants to know the truth, and more than that—he owes it to Potter.
Harry laughs, pausing in trying to get Draco’s robes off so he can gently caress Malfoy’s shoulder. “I love you,” he says softly, nudging at Draco’s chin so Draco looks at him.
Instead of answering, Malfoy pulls his fingers out, leaving Harry feeling bereft of the touch. Then Malfoy Summons something, casts a lube charm, and Harry gets his answer when he feels the tip of a plug at his arse.
He hands it to Potter, and then he spells his own pants off, looking away and flushing brightly. “Here,” he says, mortified but so, so turned on as he adjusts so he’s on all fours. “Please.”
“You got it! The acronym, I mean. No one else but Hermione noticed.” He’s pleased about it even it if it had to be Malfoy, who was now looking at him with more than a little annoyance.
“You didn’t want me to know,” Potter says carefully. “You told me when you didn’t even really have control over yourself, you know? So we can make it so I don’t know anymore.”
didn’t cast anything,” Draco points out, because it is true. Technically. “And what do you mean, onboarding paperwork? You don’t mean Potter’s going to work here?”
“I ought to punch you,” Harry grumbles, looking down into his glass as if it might hide the flush in his cheeks.
They finally manage to stop laughing after a moment, and Harry stares at their hands, intertwined. He can feel Malfoy’s pulse, and his breath catches as Malfoy slides his thumb up and down against the back of Harry’s hand, just once, before pulling away.
Malfoy’s cheeks are all red when Harry flips them over, straddling Malfoy, breathing heavily as he reaches for the clasp on Malfoy’s robes. “I want to see,” he says breathily, because he’s wanted to see Malfoy like this from the moment Harry first bared himself for a painting. Malfoy flushes even further, picking up his wand and doing some sort of complicated movement. Suddenly most of their clothes are several feet away, and they’re down to their pants, God. Harry gasps, taking in smooth pale skin, the scars on Malfoy’s chest and the Mark on his arm.
about Draco’s life. But Draco has already opened his mouth, has already committed to it. He has no choice but to bare his soul.
“And you know you’re bollocks at healing spells, so stay still,” Draco mutters, casting several times until the pink tinge on Potter’s arm fades. “You could have gotten
It’s only right, Draco supposes, that he’s leaning up against the mirror, hands gripping at its edges when Potter first presses a slick finger inside him. “
If Harry thought the Allure was strong before, it’s nothing compared to now. “Fuck,” he says, and he’s pressing himself against Draco before he knows what he’s doing because everything in his veins is saying
Afterwards Potter puts his face in Draco’s chest and says, “Sometimes I wish you were the only thing I cared about. Doesn’t that make me an awful person?”
Except for now, when Malfoy is staring at him with an expression on his face that rings of both interest and exhaustion. And Harry has to admit that he wants to peel back the layers and expose just what Malfoy’s thinking by coming in here, wanting to talk, staring at Harry like he might even want to kiss him too.
The memories come on too strong, all at once, and a damned sob threatens to rise in his throat. He clenches his hands into fists, staring angrily down at the floor. Potter is the last thing he wants to be thinking about when his death is so near he could count the hours, but now he
“But I am trying to be nicer,” Potter says, meeting his eyes, making his heart flip. “After all, we’re going to be in this for a long time, aren’t we?”
to Draco, could admit that, but a relationship was something different entirely. He wasn’t sure if he was ready for it, not in the state the war had left him in. Not to mention that half of his friends didn’t even like Draco as a person, even though he did, quite a lot… His mind flashed to the letter in his pocket, to Ginny’s off-handed phrase that had jumped out at him immediately upon reading it: “Did you ever start talking to that girl who kissed you?”
Of all the things that he could’ve expected, it wasn’t that. He never would have thought—okay, he had thought, but only in daydreams late at night, while he was trying to fall asleep after nightmares and could hear Draco shifting on the other side of the wall. But to think that, while he had been struggling with just the thought of being attracted Draco, Draco had loved him?
So he takes what he can get. He takes the Amortentia, and he takes Potter’s time, pleads for it nearly, and Merlin, how pitiful he’s become, pitiful and helpless.
But these were light-hearted feelings, weren’t they? Light enough that if he shared them, they wouldn’t burden someone else. It’d been such a long time since he’d really talked to someone, and Ginny was going to be leaving soon anyhow. It wouldn’t hurt either of them if he didn’t divulge everything, right?
Harry supposed that was probably true. “Sorry, it was just… you know,” he flushed. It had been Draco, Draco surrounding him and holding him and loving him that made everything go so hazy.
“It doesn’t bother you, does it?” Harry asks. The thought had dawned on him earlier today, and he spent the whole evening mulling it over.
Just then, as if Harry had Summoned her with his thoughts, Ginny slides into the seat next to him with Pansy close on her heels. “Hello everyone!” Ginny says, setting her usual glass of firewhisky on the rocks down on the table. “Sorry we’re late.”
“I guess now that you say it, I’m not sure either.” Malfoy’s expression grows pinched. “Maybe I’m gay because my mate is a man. I won’t ever really know, I suppose, but—I hate thinking about it controlling me like that.”
Harry’s heart pounds in his chest. “I do too,” he admits. “But… I’ll take whatever you can give me. Even just this. I… I like it. A lot.”
Malfoy groans unabashedly, even though he must be overstimulated by now. “Fuck,” he sighs, eyes going soft below him, and Harry wants to kiss him so badly in that moment that it burns in his chest.
Hermione laughs. “Not from working at the hospital, no,” she says, shoving the pad back in her purse. “Healers can still get sick, obviously, but we have all sorts of safeguards in place while we’re working so that we don’t carry pathogens from the patients. There was a whole unit on the rise of safety techniques in Healing during our History of Magic class in fourth year, you should know that.”
“What was that?” Malfoy asks, like the smarmy git he is, and Harry hears the sound of furniture being dragged across the floor—the footstool beside their bed, maybe—and then he feels the tip of Malfoy’s cock pressing lightly against his arse, just below where the plug is deep inside of him.
“Right,” Harry says. “There are a lot of witches who have to do a lot of casting all at once on a regular basis, and it can be really taxing. But most of that effect is dampened if you use an item that’s already been charmed a certain way, like the chair you’re sitting in.” He gestures at the Easy-Shrink chair, now a permanent fixture in his workroom since Malfoy’s been visiting more frequently. “You just have to tap it with your wand to activate the spells—all it requires is a magical signature to feed it a bit of power. Of course, it’ll wear out someday, but I take care to try and cast a fair bit of spell-stabilization charms.” He smiles, shrugging. “And anyway, having repeat buyers helps to keep my business running.”
That, and Potter’s leaning in toward him, which might just have contributed to the overwhelming feeling of wanting to touch him so badly.
Draco stills, mouth falling open slightly. Never before has Astoria so much raised her voice at him. He shakes his head. “I don’t even know if I’m capable of—of doing other things,” he admits, looking away. He never realized—he never
to. And I think you want it too, Potter. After all…” His voice is sly as he sits back up behind Harry. “A little bird told me you’ve been wanking over me all damn year.”
Present-Potter nudges his shoulder, a sheepish look in his eyes. “I just wanted to show you—this isn’t a new thing.”
Potter cards a hand through his hair. Then he does something unexpected—he smiles at Draco. It’s a sad smile, one where it looks like he could either laugh or cry, and it makes Draco’s heart flip funnily in his chest.
Harry thinks of Malfoy getting turned, and then an unwanted image appears in his mind, of the other vampire holding Malfoy down on the bed, hovering over him, and he has to shove the image away. “Getting turned—did it hurt?” he asks, and he’s unsure if the question is crossing some sort of line, but the words are already out so he can’t take it back.
Draco snorts. “No, no, I was a little shite, you don’t have to pity me. That’s just—background, I guess, to the real answer to your question.”
“No, really. You've been helping me out this whole time—much more than I've helped you, I'm sure. I swear I wouldn't be anywhere near passing the final exams without you.”
“Good,” Harry says, relieved. “Not that I enjoy keeping things from Ron, but—it isn’t my place to tell him, you know?”
Hermione sighs. “Marriage,” she says simply, sinking Draco’s hopes of ever getting out of this mess.
“You’re going to make me think about sex whenever we’re in close proximity to a broom closet,” Draco says, glaring at him. “Very inconvenient.”
“I don’t seem to be nearly as tempting to anyone else,” Harry points out. “So it’s at least partly your fault as well.”
“I suppose that’s true, but.” Malfoy stops talking, shrinking in on himself, and it takes Harry a second to realize he looks rather terrified. “Listen, Potter. My only friends fucked off to France without me, and I’m here alone, and I can’t... I
“No, Potter—don’t even think about it!” Malfoy says hurriedly, jumping off the desk and stretching out his hand to stop him.
“That makes two of us,” Potter says, the edge of his mouth quirking into a smile. “And… er. I am sorry. About being such an arse earlier.”
He resists the urge to bang his head down on his desk, if only for fear of smearing the ink on his paperwork.
“Of course,” Malfoy says, giving him an odd look. “I’d think it’s rather obvious. They know what they want—a good shag, and then I drink my fill and they leave. I’m careful of course—you don’t turn someone unless you get carried away, you know. Though I’ve gotten close now and again.”
“You mustn’t touch the prophecies,” the Keeper of the Hall, Unspeakable Moore, reminds him for about the thousandth time—despite Harry having told her his very first day that he
“So,” Draco says, and then he hammers the last nail into his own coffin. “What did I say that managed to trick you into liking me?”
,” Potter says, voice wavering, making Draco’s heart pulse unsteadily in his chest—his name. The only time Potter’s ever said it.
“Soooo… I’ve been contracted by the Harpies! I start training in a few weeks—I just found out a few days ago!” She was obviously watching his face for a reaction, and he quickly schooled his expression into a pleased one.
The man turns to the camera. “I am in full support. That b****** deserves to die for what he did. For my Marie, and for everyone else… If I could get my hands on him, I swear, I’d make him lose everything he has…!”
Draco stares at him, brow furrowed. “You mean you’re not worried you’ll feel differently someday? Or that I might end up a Squib because of this stupid fucking disease?”
before stepping closer to Harry again, his façade falling just the slightest bit, leaving him with a look in his eyes that Harry can only describe as yearning. “It
“Shh,” Harry says, feeling at a loss, tears pricking at his own eyes as he watches Malfoy crumple. “How was it?”
“Nah, for some reason they never found out it was me. I’m betting that they didn’t even open their mouths about what had happened after they were righted again, on account of my status or something.” Harry shrugs, suppressing a moan as Draco starts nipping at his neck. “Everyone thinks they have a connection to me, that they can make me change… ah… when you’re… the only one… Draco…”
his fault, pretty much, even it was only to get away from the Death Eaters. Still, he’s extremely glad when she finally stops eyeing him with a suspicious glare every time he goes near the Hall on his own.
The truth was that he wanted it. The wanting burned inside him, an intense urge he hadn’t remembered to think about at all until Draco had kissed him so many months ago. But it wasn’t about sex; it never had been. It was about him needing to touch Draco and hold him and be held in return. It was about needing Draco to see him and love him through all of his imperfections.
Shame rises in his throat then, and he wants to laugh. He and Potter will never be close enough for Draco’s tastes—Potter is golden, and Draco can never touch him.
“Oh, er,” Harry says, caught off guard. He clears his throat. “You’re welcome, then,” he continues, fairly sure that isn’t the only reason Malfoy dragged him over here.
Harry thinks for a moment. “Quiet,” he says eventually, his thoughts slowly returning to the nights they spent out by the lake. That part, he never told Hermione and Ron about. “I dunno. I sort of thought he changed, but...” He shrugs. “But maybe he hasn’t.”
Harry’s blood goes cold. He stares at Malfoy, and suddenly there’s a flash of jealousy so strong in his veins that he almost feels queasy. “You—you have a mate?”
Today is going to be difficult to get through, isn’t it? The memories of their night are too fresh in his mind, and he keeps getting distracted, thinking of Potter’s hands, his touch. He wonders if perhaps Potter wouldn’t mind taking a quick trip home on their lunch break…
“We’re going to sit down now, okay?” he says, shoving amorous thoughts of Potter far, far away. He waits for Potter’s nod before slowly sitting down, letting Potter bear down on his hand as he follows.
It’s fine. He can do this. He doesn’t need to be fixating on every single thing Malfoy says and does.
He crouches down in an alcove in the hallway, breath coming too too fast, pressing his forehead against the cool stone and trying desperately to swallow down the hurt in his throat.
He’ll just keep hiding how he feels, he decides. At least until Hermione finds a cure—which might be never, he supposes, although he sure hopes that’s not the case.
“Ah, the question of the year, isn’t it?” Malfoy says, leaning back with an elbow on the step above him. With the other hand, he stubs out his cigarette, then tosses it up into the air and Vanishes it wandlessly.
Draco’s chest goes tight. “Potter, what are you saying?” He can barely believe they’re having this conversation. Vaguely he wonders if he’s dreaming. “Potter, I—” He stops and shakes his head. “We barely even like each other.”
be dreaming, or maybe he’s gone and purchased one of the WWW’s new and improved daydream charms, although their charmwork obviously needs some tinkering if the daydreams are allowed to include such terrible hangovers.
He can’t remember at all. He can remember going with Draco to London, and speaking with McGonagall about something afterwards, but beyond that…
Slowly, she smiles a sad smile, and his heart stutters. “In the garden,” she says. “You should go to him. It’s not too late.”
He stands and goes to Draco, even though the Allure gets stronger with every step he takes, urging him to try to kiss Draco, or maybe even to fuck him. But he ignores it, instead clambering into the bed beside Draco when he shifts out of the way. “I missed you, fuck,” Draco says, pulling Harry close and latching on like a lifeline.
“So you don’t usually work with this DNA material?” Draco asks, holding his place in his book with a finger.
But Malfoy doesn’t continue, instead simply looking at Harry, and there’s no aversion in his eyes but there’s no friendliness there either. Some kind of interest, maybe.
“Fine,” Malfoy huffs, rolling to the side so he can stand. “But you’re coming too,” he says, waiting for Harry to pull his trousers back up before dragging him to the bedroom, and then once they’re there he corners Harry against the doorframe and kisses him, slow and sweet.
He sleeps fitfully, and he can’t focus on anything at all the next day, which is a shame because it’s one of his increasingly few days off work. He’s almost tempted to go in and take an assignment just for something to do, but he knows himself well enough to know that he’s way too distracted for the intensity of ward magic right now, and he
It’s utterly ridiculous that a little thing such as this should affect him so. But his heart is sore as he curls up in bed, clutching the note and trying to remember how it felt to be in Potter’s arms. At least he knows now, what Potter’s skin feels like. It’s far more than he expected to get.
Harry doesn’t get much work done that day. Draco spends the rest of the afternoon in the shop with him, watching him make charms and occasionally distracting him with conversation.
Draco snorts. “That would’ve been nice to know,” he says, and then before Harry can get a word in, Draco kisses his neck, right against the bite-mark.
Shocked, Harry stares at him, almost too scared of getting turned down again to hope for that to be true. “Are—are you sure?”
And yet, Potter’s been thinking about it too, hasn’t he? He has to have at least somewhat, if that’s the lie he’s been telling.
He thinks of what would happen if he touched Malfoy, how ridiculous that would be, and then he remembers punching him, the harsh feel of his fist colliding with Malfoy’s cheek. He can’t help but glance at Malfoy’s face, but Malfoy’s either healed the bruise or Glamoured it because it’s no longer there.
. Which it seems they’ll have to comply with, as this room is simply too small to fit another one in here. What in the bloody hell?
“A mistake,” Potter says, and Draco winces. “God. Sorry. I just… I just wanted to see you. Even if…” He runs his finger over a mark on the table. “Even if it was the last time.”
The rest of the Aurors had come around to approving of him eventually. Still, Harry knows that Draco’s sensitive about it, for good reason. Harry understands; he knows intimately how shitty it can feel to have so much negative attention on oneself.
, so he lets himself slowly get wet, wandering down the street as he contemplates the new changes in his life.
“I do. Just sit there and shut up,” Malfoy says, eyes tracing his lines on the page in front of him. And then he freezes. “Oh, for Salazar’s sake—” He stops mid-sentence, slamming the book shut and beginning to pace. “Absolutely
He hands one to Harry, and Harry takes it, reading the cover aloud. “‘A Primer on Muggle Genetics.’ Interesting.”
“Please,” Malfoy says, and the desperate tone to his voice gives Harry pause. “There’s going to be an attack. They’ve found out about the Phoenix Gardens.”
, and for a moment he has to work to fight back the anger that bubbles up behind his clenched teeth.
like this. They can’t go back to fighting, to anger pulsing so strong in Harry’s gut that he can’t control it, that he has no choice but to explode. Harry can’t
He toyed briefly with the idea that Draco had left the grounds, but he knew from the start that it wasn’t the solution.
Except then he immediately pushes himself up again afterwards, wrinkling his nose. “Ew, Potter, there’s spunk all over you.”
Malfoy swallows. “You shouldn’t. Obviously.” At Harry’s bewildered look, he shakes his head a little. “I mean, you have no reason to. Except that I can’t ask anyone else, so I’m asking you.”
help in a way—Draco’s not sure he would’ve had the courage to pursue Harry if he didn’t want him quite as badly as he eventually did.
They sat on the sofa, which Harry frowned at for a moment. It felt as though it had narrowed: a month ago, they could have sat on either end with two other people between them, but now they were almost touching. Not to mention that the other chairs in the room, which they had used less frequently, had seemed to disappear.
That night, he’s barely just Apparated home from work before he pulls the blanket off the mirror, stripping down naked and breathing Potter’s name, relieved beyond belief when Potter appears behind him just like last time.
It’d taken him eleven years to figure out that it was, indeed, the latter. It must be—Potter’s not fake, at least. He’s the realest thing Draco knows, his magic crackling faintly around him in a way Draco doubts he realizes is happening, his eyes brighter than the sun. His expressions are like strings, and Draco is the marionette, always reacting in response—it was anger, for so many years, and then guilt over the war, and now—
talk about it. In fact, he simply decides to stop thinking of sex with Malfoy whenever possible, and he’s doing so good a job at ignoring it that he very nearly forgets it happened in the first place.
“Tell me if I’m going too fast,” Potter says, and then he grips Draco’s hip with one hand and slowly, slowly presses inside him.
touch anything. And don’t forget that if you show up late for your first day of specialty rotations on Monday, you may not be able to enter the department. Now please, those of you who
“Insistent, hm?” Draco says, smirking, and before Harry can work a retort in he’s leaning in to kiss him—
Fleeting images of the summer past, of seeing Malfoy around the castle, of working with him to rebuild the wards and taking silent lunches with him—all of them spin through Harry’s mind. He thinks of how they’d been paired together because most of the others gave Malfoy the cold shoulder, and Harry just didn’t care. He would’ve preferred Hermione and Ron, of course, but they’d been off tracking down Hermione’s parents.
“Did they catch you?” Harry asks him then, anger swelling in his chest. “Stealing from the fountain, I mean?”
“Well, don’t,” Draco says, climbing off the bed to undo his trousers, as if it’s simple as that, as if Draco isn’t pretending he doesn’t want Potter to love him at least a little.
She’s his best friend, after all. She’s funny and clever and intelligent and shares his enthusiasm for both reading and watching Quidditch, among other things.
“It’s okay,” Harry says. “I can be a bit thick, you know, but it’s fairly obvious when you spend half of your time at work staring at me.”
Potter simply looks embarrassed. “He’s not bad,” he says, and it takes a moment for Draco to realize he’s blushing.
“We work together!” Potter says, as if that explains his infallible positivity toward continuously getting turned down. “’Mione and Ron bring their coworkers to dinner all the time. They always ask about you, you know.”
Hermione breathes a deep sigh, and for a moment, she trembles like a leaf. But then she shakes her head, looking up at him. “You’re right. I should—I should be researching right now,” she says, and moves to pick up her book.
But Potter’s looking at him like he’s genuinely sad that Draco won’t talk to him about this, and Draco feels like he can’t
Draco sighs. “All right,” he says carefully. “So...” He leans back against the cushions and looks at Harry. “Why were you staring at me, then?”
Harry looks like he’s just been given the best present of his life. He grins, shaking his head as if he can’t quite believe it. “I love you,” he says, voice rough, sparking emotion in Draco’s chest. And then Harry leans down and kisses Draco, again and again, and the slow shift of Draco’s entire world changing finally starts to settle.
“Malfoy? Get out of my house,” Harry says, seething, slowly raising a hand and pointing it at the door.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter,” Malfoy says, taking the brush and sliding it back into his pocket. “You’re running an establishment, aren’t you? Do you let all of your customers cheat you out of work?”
Harry shrugs, the miserable feeling still lingering in his stomach. “Wasn’t sure if that was how it worked.”
So maybe Malfoy is dangerous and maybe he’s still cruel. Harry wants him anyway. Malfoy’s not even using his vampire coercion on him, but Harry couldn’t walk away from this if he tried.
” and coming, his cock untouched, squeezing his eyes closed as he bucks his hips against the other man and spurts out over the sheets.
This fire was not Fiendfyre. The flames went out with ease, and God, oh God, he could have lost him.
He hates not being able to tell her anything—Hermione and Ron both. His dinners with them lately have been mostly the two of them talking rather than Harry, and he doesn’t at all mind sitting and listening to their tales from work, but he wishes he could at least tell them
Idly, he wonders at the sheer amount of information his brain is creating. He’s never known any of these things about Draco, and one night, he remarks as such.
The mirror grumbles at that, but then Harry walks into the room, the noise of the shower running coming through the open doorway as he walks behind Draco and slides his arms around Draco’s waist. “Are you coming?” he says, pressing his erection to Draco’s arse, and Draco laughs.
, especially because every now and then Draco’s eyes meet his and—and there are sparks, warm and happy, all across Harry’s skin.
“I told you, Potter. I can’t explain.” Malfoy sounds terse now too, and the idea that Malfoy is just going to shut him out again hurts far more than Harry would like to admit.
“Fuck!” Draco grits out, and then he’s coming harder than he can ever remember, spilling over Potter’s fingers, his arse spasming frantically around Potter’s cock oh God oh
“I didn’t like the potion,” Potter shoots back. “I hated the potion, actually. I hate when stuff fucks with my head.”
Harry’s chest starts to burn, all the pent up longing and regret that he thought he’d done away with years ago serving as ample fuel for the fire as he stares at Malfoy, his heart thumping wildly. God, he’d wanted Malfoy so much. He still does.
“I’m not sure myself, to be honest,” Harry shrugged, throat tightening at the brush of Draco's fingers. “I died, and there was a part of Voldemort in me, but I chose to let that die without me… so I came back.”
. Especially when Malfoy looks at him again, so fucking close that he can see the specks of silver in his eyes.
“Draco,” Potter says again, thumb stroking against his back, and Draco has to squeeze his eyes shut in order not to cry.
Too many emotions are clawing for dominance in Draco’s brain, hurt and love and betrayal and heartbreak and anger. Eventually it’s too much, and he starts to go numb inside, numb to what is happening, numb to anything besides Harry’s body touching his.
The first time Malfoy painted him, it had seemed choppy and forced. There were plenty of gaps and pauses as Malfoy scratched his face and stared at the canvas, muttering things to himself.
“Ow,” Draco says, glaring at Potter suspiciously, holding his wand aloft in case Potter tries anything more.
He’s still not all right. But he thinks it might be better for him to get away for a while, to leave most of the things that remind him of the war, to sleep somewhere where he hasn’t heard people screaming. Even if it was his home.
Then he allows himself to let out a single, silent sob of utter misery, doubling over, all the grief of a relationship that would never be the same again hitting him at once. He bites back the scream that wants to escape his lungs, and then stands up and composes himself.
and that’s more than Harry could’ve hoped for at this point. “I wish you could too,” he says, rolling onto his side and looking into Draco’s eyes. “But—but I’m happy that you’re here with me anyway.”
Draco nods, briefly closing his eyes. When he opens them, he looks troubled. “I told myself I wouldn’t call you by your name,” he says. “But you’re turning into the friend I always wanted you to be, and I—I don’t know what to do with that.”
This might just be what happiness feels like, Draco thinks, looking at the spark in Potter’s eyes, feeling almost drunk on it.
“What?” Draco says, stung—because he may have been like that before, but he certainly doesn’t think he’s like that now. If anything, he knows now more than ever how shitty the things he’s done in the past have been.
He stares at it, not understanding. Had she gone home without him? Worried now, he steps back out, double-checking the room number. But no, it’s the right one.
Harry sighs, looking over at Malfoy, alone at his table. He hasn’t noticed them yet, and Harry feels a pang of longing, eyes tracing over his blond hair and long fingers, at how he’s barely picking at his food. “I wish I could too,” he says, and then, so quietly he’s not even sure Hermione hears, he continues—“but I’m in love with him.”
He stops in at a small café. It’s Muggle, or at least it seems so by the odd looks he gets from people staring at his robes. He briefly panics when he realizes he doesn’t have any Muggle money on him, slipping his hand into his pocket to discreetly cast the Coin-Conversion Charm on a handful of Galleons. The cashier looks surprised to be handed several dollar coins but thankfully doesn’t comment, handing him his coffee and croissant without fuss.
“Two hours.” Draco doesn’t know what to do with the leftover potion, so he slides it into the pocket of his robes.
“I’m going to go try and walk this off,” he excused himself to Ron and Hermione, who appeared to be having one of their moments and only half heard him.
Immediately, he looks over and sees that Malfoy’s bed is empty, bed-curtains draped open. And just as immediately, he wonders where exactly Malfoy went.
“Thank fucking Merlin,” Draco says, and then he leans back, eyeing him seriously. “If you really want me to do that—if you’re
“Draco?” Astoria calls from the adjoining sitting room, the one she’s all but claimed as her own to lounge and sleep in.
“God, really?” Harry says. He yearns to kiss him then, to pull him close, to press their bodies together again, but—he can’t.
“I… I guess I was thinking about going to the club,” Draco says, even though he was thinking no such thing until right this moment.
“It’s not Muggle science,” Draco mumbles, and really, it’s honestly easy to pick up on Potter’s tea drinking habits, seeing as he drinks several cups a day every morning at the office.
“I can’t,” he admits quietly, because Malfoy’s body is firm against his arm, his back slowly warming where Harry’s hand touches him. He wants to touch him more. He wants...
He has half a mind to tell Potter to go away, but he doesn’t have enough time left to make decisions that he’ll regret. He’d most definitely regret it if Potter left right now.
“Do you...” Harry feels suddenly terrified at what he’s about to ask. “Do you still hate Muggles? Or Muggleborns.”
It takes him a long time to figure out the right wording, and not long after he sends it, he starts wishing he could call the owl back and burn the damned thing. But the owl is probably halfway to France by now. All he can do is wait.
“You treat that like it’s such a big deal,” Malfoy mumbles. “I barely did anything.” And then he stares down at his plate as Hermione takes a seat next to Harry.
Harry swallows. Usually they all go out as a group after cases like this, but he can’t resist the way Draco’s looking at him right now, like he wants to be around Harry more than anything, like it would be painful to walk away. “Okay,” he says, his voice a mere rasp.
“No,” Harry says, voice firm, stilling his hips as he looks straight at him. “I really am in love with you. I—I can’t tell you how long it’s been, because like I said—I’m horrid with feelings, but ever since training, it’s like...” He stops, swallowing, and Draco feels like he’s on fire—since
Harry didn’t realize it would change him, seeing Malfoy bare against the sheets, watching his expression go slack with pleasure, coming apart himself with his arms wrapped tight around him. He curses at himself over and over, because he has a million things to worry about—like not dying, for one. But all he can think about is Malfoy.
“That was fucking brilliant, okay?” Harry says. “And if you don’t want to do it again, we don’t have to, but it’s not something I regret. I’m...” He reaches down and squeezes his hand. “I’m not scared of you.”
He sort of wishes Malfoy were taking his clothes off too—then he forbids himself from wishing that, because the thought of Malfoy naked and vulnerable in front of him fills him with too much longing to bear.
“Not really,” Malfoy says. “We talked about some things earlier yesterday, but she seemed rather normal. And then I returned to the hospital after work, and she was gone. She left me a letter.”
“How am I supposed to help you get over your fears, anyway?” he changed the subject. “That would require eating with you, and I’d rather not, if it’s all the same to you, Potter.”
Harry opens his mouth, annoyed, but before he can respond Malfoy hangs his head, exhaustion in the hunch of his shoulders.
“Merlin, okay,” Harry says, pulling his hand away and spelling it clean. Then he climbs over Draco and kisses him once more, hungrily, as if he could never get enough.
idea, something that would never happen in a million years. All of his friends, even Greg, would be quick to remind him of that, even though Draco of all people doesn’t need the reminder. He’s miserable enough as it is, knowing that Potter is the last bloody person in the world that he should be dating.
Malfoy looks down at Harry’s hand on his robes, then tilts his head up to meet Harry’s eyes. “You should know,” Malfoy says. “Just... I was thinking that I might not come back to school.”
Potter asks after Astoria, and Draco merely grunts and says that she’s fine. Truly, he’s itching to ask Potter what on earth Astoria was hinting at earlier, but he forces himself to wait because really, he’s still not sure about what he wants from Potter.
Draco follows, smirking. “Maybe later, if you’re lucky,” he mumbles for Harry’s ears only, and Harry laughs.
“Sure, Potter,” Malfoy says, looking almost like he wants to say something else but seeming to think better of it.
“Because I think Draco’s curious about you,” Astoria says, making Harry’s eyebrows shoot up in surprise. “He’s my best friend, you know. I want the best for him.”
“I… yes,” he said, and he spoke the truth. He trusted Draco, as odd as that seemed—they were on even ground now.
Harry looks down at his stew and shrugs. He’s not sure, not sure at all. Then he thinks of Malfoy’s pale hands and red lips and really, really wishes he
“You don’t have to feel bad about it or anything,” Draco tells him, his brow furrowing. “Like I said, I’ve been thinking about it too. It’s just not a good idea to—to actually act on it.”
“Potter,” Draco reprimands, unreasonably embarrassed about the idea of being so exposed, even though he’s still naked and blindingly hard and also has been rutting up against Potter for the better part of five minutes.
When the man finally shudders and comes, Malfoy takes it, his eyes fluttering shut as the man bucks his hips. Then Malfoy stands, wiping his mouth off with the back of his hand, and whispers something in the man’s ear.
“That was because I can think of a much better use for your hands,” Draco winks at him. Harry rolls his eyes, but scoots closer to Draco as Draco sets his wand down on a table.
Draco’s eyebrows raise—she hasn’t spoken to Aunt Andromeda in years, as far as he knows. “I didn’t know you were in contact with her.”
“Sorry,” Draco says, so faintly Harry almost thinks he’s imagined it. Draco clears his throat, staring down at the boiling water. “I suppose I was more trying to lecture myself.”
Potter seems to think nothing more of it, but Draco replays the moment over and over in his head throughout the day as he makes his potions and Potter puts together a weird Muggle document called a spreadsheet on his magic-proofed computer. Neville’s right—it does feel like something’s changed. He’s catching Potter staring at him more again lately, that curiosity in his eyes, and Draco doesn’t know what to think of it.
“Oh. Right,” Draco says, his expression shuttering, and okay, yeah, he was being a bit annoying, but Harry didn’t mean to make him feel
“Because I wanted to keep you,” Harry says. “I still want to keep you. I can’t bear the thought of dating some other bloke because every time I close my eyes I just think of being with you. These past few weeks—it’s been everything I’ve ever wanted.”
This, too, is a party Draco remembers well. It was Lovegood’s summer solstice party, just a couple months ago, complete with a band of singing ghouls (as much as one could call them
Malfoy ignores his objections, leaning back against the booth. “Let’s say I believe all of this is true, and you’re not undercover or something.”
He allows himself one brief moment to imagine what it would be like to mate with Draco, to lie next to each other in bed every night and kiss and fuck and fall in love for the rest of their lives—God. It’s a dangerous set of thoughts, and he banishes them, locking them away so they won’t come out again. Because it won’t happen.
Potter turns around and walks away, and he’s almost all the way down the steps up to Draco’s flat before Draco makes up his mind.
Malfoy sags with relief, and Harry hadn’t known until that moment just how much tension Malfoy was carrying. It’s not long before Malfoy reconstructs his façade, his face quickly morphing into carefully blank wall. “Twelve hours again?” Malfoy asks, his tone haughty, and for the first time Harry wonders if all of Malfoy’s prickliness is really just some sort of defense mechanism.
“Obviously it wasn’t,” Draco says, frowning. “Otherwise you wouldn’t—well. You wouldn’t have just spent over an hour fucking me.”
at his throat, his brain helpfully reminds him, and he has to squeeze his eyes shut and think forcefully of his paperwork to avoid getting an erection in his office.
“No—‘s fine,” Harry says, his voice coming out strangled, because he absolutely won’t wank to this if Astoria’s here. So she can’t leave, because he doesn’t
When he returns to the waiting room, he expects to see everyone there, but he’s surprised when it’s just Draco.
“You’ve just been so upfront about it,” Draco tells him, finding Harry’s hand. He squeezes then, so hard it kind of hurts, but Harry lets him hold on, lets him anchor himself. “You knew what you wanted.”
“Fuck, I’ve fancied you for ages,” he says, laughing incredulously. And then he does kiss Draco, but it’s sweeter, tenderer than ever before.
He imagines running away with Potter, imagines being the kind of people who could just forget about the war, about everything except themselves, except each other. But that would require telling Potter about his mission in the first place, which isn't an option, and anyway Draco could never simply hide. He’s Marked, and wherever he goes, the Dark Lord will be able to find him.
Then suddenly time is up, and Potter stands, looking like he’s more than happy to flee. “I’ll, er. See you?”
—Harry hasn’t bottomed in a while, and he always forgets just how it feels at first. “It—it won’t… it won’t fit, will it?” he asks, trembling with the effort it takes to stay still, to refrain from pushing back onto Malfoy’s cock.
“I want to be nice,” Potter says, and starts sliding his finger out, then in again. “You’re letting me inside you.”
“Oh, I don’t watch,” Astoria says. “There’s a waiting area that I usually sit in—quite nice, actually, there’s a masseuse down there too. But I wanted to show you this, because I just thought that you might not believe me if I said that I honestly don’t mind you having sex with him.” She gestures at Malfoy. “I might encourage it, even.”
Draco doesn’t know what to feel as he reaches for the nightstand; he’s barely thinking as he picks up his wand. By the time Potter looks up again, Draco’s holding it in front of him, ready to cast.
Hermione laughs. “You’re right about that,” she says, Conjuring a vial with her wand. “Mind if I take another DNA sample to run through the lab?”
Finally Draco pulls back, and when Harry blinks his eyes open, Draco’s face is red, his lips parted, eyes locked on Harry.
After a long time of waiting, the horrid thought appears in his mind that Potter’s chickened out. That he’s not coming after all.
He has to be really fucking gone over Malfoy for this to be affecting him this much, doesn’t he? Or maybe it’s that somewhere, deep down, he’s always cared about what Malfoy thought of him.
since Will left. He’s fucked Malfoy and kissed him and touched him, all because he wanted to, because Malfoy looking at him like he’s the center of his world leaves him feeling breathless, like he never wants it to stop.
He lays there for a long time, staring at the wall and trying desperately to think of nothing. But vague memories of being with Draco sweep through his mind anyway, taunting him with visions of Draco’s smile, Draco’s laugh, Draco kissing him. What will happen if Draco loses his magic? And how will it interact with his Veela blood, anyway? Harry imagines a future in which Draco is forced to mate just to keep a stake in the magical world, and then he pushes that thought away. He’s thinking worst case scenarios, after all.
Malfoy sighs sheepishly. “I grew up a spoiled child. Sometimes it can be difficult for me to want something and not be able to have it, so… I’ve been leading you on, to some extent, and I know it’s probably been terribly inconvenient to you.”
Draco face contorted, warped with fear and anger and distress. “Just. Fucking. Do it. Kill me, Potter. Save me. That’s what you like to do, isn’t it? If you love me, like you’re saying, then do it. Or…” he shuddered as a sob wracked through his body. “Even if you don’t love me. It’ll be better this way. I can’t…” And his face crumpled. “I can’t go to Azkaban, Harry, I can’t, the Dementors will suck out my soul and I won’t remember anything and I won’t remember you anymore Harry, please please save me—“
The candle-light is low, flickering, casting ominous shadows on the walls of the dark chamber Harry’s standing in. He assumes he’ll grow used to the sight in the coming years, but for now, it still seems incredibly eerie, and he suppresses a shiver.
Harry lays back down, feeling colder than he should be. Then he rolls over, puts his face in the pillow that Draco had laid his head on, and breathes in the scent of the man he wishes was in love with him.
Or that’s what was declared at the trial—so his mother said. He’s not sure. He can’t remember himself; he thinks he must’ve blacked out at those words, from terror or exhaustion or desperation to escape his own skin.
Harry sighs, mulling it over in his head as his heart thumps painfully in his chest. “I’d like to be friends,” he says finally. “But I’d also really like to know why you don’t want—more.”
They share a look, and Draco makes a face when Zeller isn’t watching, making Harry want to laugh again and setting his heart pounding all at once.
Harry would be an idiot to say yes to that, even if he privately agrees, so he just gives Malfoy a look of mild horror. “What? No—”
Instead he stalks away, into the living room, flopping onto the sofa with his hands clenched into fists. He doesn’t want Harry to follow, but Harry does anyway, and Draco can’t bear to look at him, even as Harry hesitantly sits down on the opposite end of the sofa.
This time, it’s Harry who leans in, pressing his lips to Draco’s. Draco makes a small noise of satisfaction and pulls Harry closer, deepening the kiss, and Harry has to restrain himself from grinning lest he ruin it with teeth.
Harry gives him a sad smile and puts a hand to Draco’s heart, still alive and beating for just a bit longer—a shared moment, a shared look; one last small amount of happiness.
“It’s Muggle entertainment. You’re supposed to watch shows and movies on it—moving pictures that tell a story. Kind of like a cross between Wizarding portraits and a Pensieve, I suppose,” he explains.
They’ve never talked about the rare nights that they sleep here, too tired to go back to the dorm, a stray hand on the other’s waist—and eye contact in the darkness, the edges of a smile, kissing even though they’ve both already come...
Even if that feeling only lasted minutes—lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, biting back tears after Malfoy left—even if it was over by the time he forced himself to get up, it’s not something he wants to revisit ever again.
Draco shakes his head. “Nope,” he says. “I slept with Pansy once—awful idea from both of us, really, never again. Then I hooked up with Theo Nott for a while in eighth year, then a one off with Blaise when we were drunk a few months or so ago.”
“You could have just come out and said it,” Harry says, frowning. “That you wanted to be friends, I mean.”
The explosion shakes the office and reverberates through Draco’s bones, although thankfully everything but the pile of fan mail and a wastebasket that’s knocked over by the blast is spared. All be told, it wasn’t even the strongest magical explosion Draco’s ever seen, given he had joint Potions with the Gryffindors throughout Hogwarts—
His face splits into a grin, because Merlin, his dream had been right. “Pot, kettle,” he teases, going along with the script, and Draco rolls his eyes.
“Ah, yeah,” Malfoy says, nodding. “It took me a while to wrap my brain around it too, when Mother first mentioned it might happen to me. I almost thought she was playing some sort of prank on me, but then I met my mate, and… it all became real, I suppose.”
Finally, gritting his teeth, Draco relents, sliding his hand into his pajama bottoms and closing his eyes. Then, just like sixth year, he wanks to the thought of Potter watching him.
Malfoy grins, pushing up the sleeves of his robes, which is a much more attractive action than it ought to be. His Mark is exposed for once, but Harry's gaze doesn't linger—he's seen it several times before, during quiet nights in the eighth year common room. "I suppose we have," Malfoy says.
“What are you doing here?” he blurted out, because the drawling had alerted him to one undeniable fact: the person he’d walked into was Malfoy. Part of Harry wasn’t surprised, because Malfoy was everywhere at Hogwarts. But the other part of him felt Malfoy’s presence buzzing on his skin like the crackle of a Stupefy, sharp and alarming. He hadn’t seen him since just after the final battle, since death and destruction and all of the things that had kept Harry awake at night ever since, and he almost wanted to flee.
“I reckon you should get to the hospital, if it is what you think it is,” Ron says, waving him on. “I’ll be all right.”
that’s between them. But Malfoy’s already gone. So he follows Malfoy back to the table and sits down in his chair, picking up his glass and downing a good portion of his beer in one gulp.
“Just… lay there, and sleep right in front of me. I’m your enemy!” Malfoy scowled, crossing his arms.
Harry really, really has been trying not to think about kissing him, ever since pub night, when he’d gone home with his head filled to the brim with thoughts of Malfoy. But now Malfoy’s in his shop again, and his resolve is going straight down the drain.
to do, not at all. He knows himself well enough to know that he would go absolutely mad if he had to sit in this dusty chamber for the rest of his life. But he still has more than a month left in the department rotation, so he may as well be productive somehow.
“Still basking in the glow of your little fans, aren’t you, Potter?” Malfoy sneers as he strides past.
So the Healers say. But Draco finds that hard to believe, as he watches her grow weaker with every passing month. “I know,” he says wearily.
him, suckling at his skin, hands winding around Draco’s back—and even if it’s just for this moment, Draco can finally stop hiding how much he wants him.
want this. It’s something he’s always daydreamed about, being touched without being allowed to come, having someone—for lack of a better word—
Harry bucks his hips uncontrollably as he rides out his orgasm, and Draco whimpers softly at that. Harry feels a smile coming to his lips even as he spurts out the last of it into Draco’s fist, pressing his hips back, clenching his arse around Draco in an attempt to bring him off as best he can in this position.
Being apart for even the time it takes to change into nightclothes is highly unpleasant. Draco doesn’t even want to think about separating to shower in the morning; at this rate even being away from Potter to piss is a nuisance.
A wave of nausea rises in his stomach then, because that would mean Draco’s stories from Azkaban are
“Really?” Potter asks, and brightens, and all at once it occurs to Draco that to Potter, the Weasleys are basically family, and also that not everyone feels as excruciatingly uncomfortable seeing their family as Draco does.
He takes it back to the sleeping quarters and then he perches on the edge of his bed, staring down at the vial. After a moment, he hears rustling and sees that Malfoy is peeking through his bedcurtains. “Oh,” Malfoy says, looking defeated. “Pomfrey wouldn’t give me any of that.”
Malfoy is silent for a long moment. Then he sighs. “You want to know why I didn’t want you to leave earlier?”
“Come on, stop brooding. We’re here,” Malfoy says, and Harry resents that Malfoy’s just called him ‘brooding’ but follows him toward the door anyway. The signs in the windows are all done in neon, and Harry watches as Malfoy walks up and flashes the bouncer a pointy grin, the man raising a hand in greeting. He easily lets them through, into the club beyond, dark and filled with people.
Ron sets his spoon down. “You know. The thing where you’ve been obsessed with him for forever? Don’t tell me you’re going to try to deny it again, Harry, we all know—”
“It’s nice out, and I can’t sleep at night. So why not?” Harry sat up, shrugging. “You didn’t do anything to hurt me.”
“Of course not,” Malfoy snaps, and oh, there’s the Malfoy Harry remembers. “Wizards paint with their wands, obviously.”
Draco nods slowly, shifting downwards and collapsing onto Harry’s chest. “I don’t deserve you,” he says quietly.
Astoria’s still in France, though not at the retreat she started at—she found a partner there months ago, someone she’s actually in love with, and they’ve since moved in together. The four of them go out for dinner sometimes, which Draco thought would feel far stranger than it actually does.
“But that’s boring,” Draco says broodily. “Everyone knows what your dating life is like—you snogged Chang back in third year, and then there was Ginny Weasley of course, and then you decided you weren’t into women and stopped dating entirely.”
He gave Harry a look of despair, and Harry understood. Draco really was like him, in the most definitive way possible.
And this time Harry lets him. He lets Malfoy lick into his mouth and shudders a gasp when Malfoy works one knee between his thighs, slowly rocking their hips together, and Harry’s never been more turned on in his life when he bucks his hips and sees Malfoy lift his head and gasp.
And judging from the way Draco’s skin feels slightly sticky, they’d certainly done more than just blowjobs last night.
Now that Malfoy’s been practicing more, he’s begun doing the painting charms nonverbally, which besides unfortunately being really bloody attractive is also leaving Malfoy room to occasionally speak as he draws his wand over the canvas.
Harry does the same, heart hurting, haphazardly slinging his pants and trousers on and wondering with a pang where they went wrong.
Just as Harry is wondering if it would be too bold to try and press their bodies any closer, Draco slides a hand down his back, landing to cup his arse and pull him in, slotting their thighs together. “
Potter’s still there when he opens his eyes. Draco’s glad—he’s still half-afraid Potter will fade away, that there’s some sort of time limit or something. He feels guilty enough as it is, using Potter’s image like this—though it’s really not much more than fantasizing while wanking, it
Strangely enough, a few days follow during which barely anyone visits his room. He’s glad of the quiet; now he can float in his pool of guilt in peace.
Except then he feels a strange sort of urge to keep going, to walk over and smile at Draco, maybe to impress him with some sort of magic display—
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Potter says brusquely, and maybe he doesn’t. That almost makes Draco angrier.
Malfoy sits there for one, two, three breaths before saying, “Okay,” and reaching over to grab his wand, casting a cleaning charm over both of them. “Okay,” he says again, rolling off of Harry, thumping his head on the pillow. He turns away. “Should I...?” he asks, vaguely motioning toward the door.
Harry laughs and thinks for a moment about how much he loves him, knocking their foreheads together. He can’t keep from smiling. “I’m glad you brought it up.”
Sighing, Hermione leans forward. “Listen, Harry, you know you can tell me anything? Ron and I, right?”
The potion is warm and sweet in his throat, and then he watches Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bob as he too swallows it down.
And then Hermione coaxes him up so she can wrap him in a hug, and he cries for the second time that day.
“Hullo, Harry,” Hermione says, and a chorus of assorted ‘hullos’ echoes across the table from their small group. Harry nods his own greeting and gratefully accepts the pint Hermione pushes toward him across the sticky surface of the wood.
to him right now, and he feels so damn exposed with Malfoy staring at his arsehole like this, muttering words of approval of all things.
“Okay,” Draco says. And then before Potter can say anything more, Draco kisses him, finally letting his feelings loose, letting himself feel how damn
Well, fuck. Draco’s caught red-handed, isn’t he? He sighs. “Just, er. That time when we were alone in the showers,” he says slowly, expecting Harry to tell him off for spying.
“…Okay?” Harry says. He’s growing slightly frustrated, so he turns and heads back to the kitchen, spelling the stove off so at least nothing will catch on fire. When he returns to the sitting room, Malfoy hasn’t moved. “Are you going to explain yourself now?”
hot, even now in front of him, arching his back and pressing himself onto another man’s cock. And it’s okay to think that just for now, right? Even if Harry still hates him?
“Your stories are—a lot more creative now than they used to be,” he murmurs. “Almost as if I’m not imagining you.”
help Harry when they were Trainees, that’s certainly true. Sure, Harry reciprocated, but he’s almost certain Malfoy would have been completely fine without him. Harry, on the other hand…
But his proposition does sound reasonable enough, so Harry nods in agreement. “Okay,” he says, holding his hand out to shake. Then he takes a breath, looks Malfoy in the eye, and says, “Like eighth year, right?”
Then Draco looks down, twisting one of his hands in the sheets. “I don’t really know how to do this,” he says carefully, turning to look over at Harry. “I’m nervous.”
“Oh,” Harry sighs, as Draco pulls away for good this time. He grins, feeling breathless. “Thought we were only supposed to do it once?”
Draco closes his eyes and breathes him in, chest constricting so tightly it’s as if he’s the one who’s panicking. He loves him, and he doesn’t want this to end—which is a horrible thought, because Potter’s obviously feeling so poorly, but Draco can’t help it.
“It’s okay,” Harry says, setting the book on the coffee table and turning to hug him, worried. “We’re together now, right?”
” Draco says, carefully lying the magically sensitive tree he’d just lugged over here on its side (nothing venomous, thank Merlin, though it definitely took a swipe at his arse halfway over here) and wiping off the sweat that’s already forming on his brow.
Somehow Harry isn’t surprised when he hears a crack of Apparition from his sitting room shortly after he’s arrived home. He’s also not surprised when he walks into his sitting room and sees that it’s Malfoy, eyes wide, looking as if he hadn’t meant to end up here.
“Do you not like it?” Potter asks, looking as if he’s about to pull away, but Draco shakes his head.
“I knew it,” Malfoy says, swallowing audibly. Then he looks up at Harry, so close now that Harry can see the flecks of silver in his eyes. “You always did enjoy a challenge.”
“It’s—I don’t, um, like small spaces? It’s—it’s fine normally, but—but not for a r-really long time, and—fuck.” Potter clamps his mouth shut, eyes darting around the lift. His breath is starting to come fast,
“Because… I love you,” Draco’s voice dropped to a whisper, and he pulled his arms around himself. “And you don’t… I can’t… not if you don’t…” He shook his head, swallowing thickly, and it hurt Harry to see the hurt on his face.
“Of course it is,” Malfoy says. “But there’s nothing I can do about it now, so here we are.” He throws Harry a look of sardonic amusement. “Are you done pestering me about my life?”
He barely restrains himself from reaching behind him. There won’t be anything there, he knows, and anyway, seeing Potter like this is almost enough.
Draco raises an eyebrow, smirking. “I don’t ever intend to find that out, actually.” He leans closer then, lowering his voice. “I’ll have you in your bed, or over your kitchen table, or in your workroom while no one’s watching—anywhere and everywhere.”
Harry shivers as the spell sinks into his skin, scrambling his thoughts, but before he can think himself out of it, Malfoy casts again—
“Whatever, Malfoy,” he says, picking up his glass and tossing back the rest of his whiskey. “Think whatever you want to think. Good to see
“Come here,” Harry says sharply, and then he slides closer and slips an arm around Malfoy, pulling him closer. Who, he discovers, is actually still quite freezing.
Malfoy looks smug. “Maybe I did.” He stretches, and Harry sips his drink and lets himself admire the long lines of Malfoy’s body. For once, he doesn’t even mind when Malfoy catches him looking. “So you...” Malfoy starts, then clears his throat. “What
“My place,” Harry offers, and he notices the slightest bit of relief in Draco’s eyes but doesn’t pay it any mind—he’s too focused on thoughts like
As their footsteps echoed in the corridor on the way to the Great Hall, Draco pulled out the matchbox he had taken to carrying with him, lighting a match and staring at the flame. “I wish Slughorn was as brilliant of a mentor as Langley is.”
The Sorting Hat has started its song, but Harry’s mostly tuned it out. It’s only when there’s an increased murmuring from the students around him that he manages to sit up and start listening.
“Sure,” Harry says, then takes a swig of his own bottle, sighing at the pleasure from the warmth of it in his throat before sitting down in the chair beyond the canvas. He’s pleasantly surprised to find that Malfoy’s put a cushioning charm on it. “How long d’you think the painting will take?”
And the press of lips was gentle, so gentle. Harry had never kissed anyone except for Cho and Ginny, but this was almost better than that because there was no one alive in the world that had ever made his blood boil like Malfoy had. Then Malfoy pushed him lightly against the wall, catching Harry’s hand on one side and his shoulder on the other. Slowly, slowly he moved his lips against Harry’s, and it was like a dream, a dream in which Malfoy’s mouth was cool and fresh and his tongue was swiping against Harry’s lips in a way that left him absolutely trembling.
They eat dinner in Draco’s room, and then they have sex again, slow, tender touches that last long into the night. Later they do sleep, but not much. Draco doesn’t want to waste precious minutes, and Harry doesn’t complain about waking up every now and then to Draco’s lips on his.
Harry doesn't really know how he ended up here, standing in front of Bentley’s a week later with nervousness oozing in his gut.
“You could go if you wanted,” Draco murmurs low in his ear, and Harry can’t suppress a full body shiver.
“What do you do about charms that don’t play nicely with the Muggle repellant spells?” Malfoy asks, as Harry sets the sponge down.
“Fuck,” Harry breathes, and despite just having what might be the best orgasm of his life, his cock twitches. He pulls Draco down to kiss him, and Draco goes pliantly, wrapping his wings around them both.
“I think I’m okay,” Draco shrugged. Once he had mastered matches, he had moved on to lighting candles and even torches. Finally, they had started acclimating him to using Incendio again, and though his progress was slow, he had eventually mastered it.
‘It will hurt less if you do it fast,’ Mother told him once, before spelling out a thorn from his thumb so she could heal it.
An idea occurs to Harry, and he grins, wrenching his hands free of Draco’s grasp. Before Draco can manage to grab him again, Harry wraps his arms around Draco’s body and rolls, tipping them off the sofa and into the spin of Apparition.
“Bloody hell,” he says, shaking his head. Then he shrugs and looks at Hermione. “I suppose we better get a move on getting engaged, then,” he says, and Hermione’s face flares bright red. But then she smiles shyly at him, and it’s obvious she’s pleased.
Harry is so, so hard. “Please,” he whispers, his hips lifting off the bed as he thinks of it—please, anything.
Breathing a silent sigh of relief, Harry thinks on it, shrugging. “I don’t think it’s that strange,” he says, as they turn onto a side street and dodge a short witch with a baby in her arms.
Harry lets out an involuntary shiver of jealousy. “God, I hope not,” he says, and Hermione frowns. “But I’m okay, really,” he adds. “This is just for the company, mostly. It’s not… we’re not really dating.”
Draco rolls his eyes sharply, reaching for the fastener of his own trousers. “If I say yes will you stop talking?”
“Maybe I am,” Harry says brazenly—and oh God, he was not prepared for Draco to leer at him in response, for Draco’s teeth to sharpen and his eyes to change and for Harry to feel that unmistakable, magnetic pull toward him. “Fuck,” Harry breathes, and he’s achingly hard as Draco backs him toward the bed.
“Well, maybe I don’t pay attention to the papers like you do,” Potter bites back. “I’m sure you were happy to have your claim to fame, though, weren’t you?”
God. It makes Harry’s heart flutter in his chest, and suddenly all he can think about is how he wants to keep being close to Malfoy like this,
Several meters ahead stands Potter, still in his pajamas, staring at the flickering of the flames. Draco walks up to him, not even hearing the sounds of his own footsteps, and they wordlessly watch as the MFErs finish their job.
,” Draco gasps out very quickly, clutching at the sheets, and Harry starts laughing and has to pull off.
“I get that now,” Draco says, nodding. “Part of me didn’t truly understand why you wanted to do this, right when you first asked—I mean, I wanted it, but then I’m usually the one to suggest things like this in the first place, so I couldn’t tell what made it different.”
“Oh,” Malfoy says, then nods, starting to look hopeful. “Yes. But—we came out of it so fast because we were merely splashed with the potion. It won’t be like that if we drink it—we can decide how long it’ll last, even, depending on how large of a dose we take. It won’t be bad,” he says, as if he could really promise it’ll be
The very air in the room seems soothing. Though, he’s fairly sure that’s the still a side-effect of the Amortentia.
you’re being coy. You basically asked for this,” he says, laughing when Draco bucks fruitlessly against his hand.
It feels like a weight’s been lifted off Harry’s chest. He hadn’t realized just how apprehensive he’d been about Malfoy turning him down until this moment. “Yeah?” he asks, probably too eagerly, but he can’t bring himself to care.
Because that was the turning point. Everything went downhill after that, everything became so awful that Harry couldn’t fucking bear it.
“It was implied.” Draco’s mouth twists. “I... Look. I’ll admit I’ve... also been thinking about it.”
to you—because you avoid me sometimes, and half the time I think you hate me, but. But… you don’t, and I—I love you, okay? You’re—you’re wonderful, and I don’t think you really know that.”
, Potter, showing up and ruining my plans and sticking your nose in places you shouldn’t have.” He pauses, his voice growing hard, and suddenly he presses his finger in all the way to the knuckle, making Harry yelp quietly. “I suppose that still makes me a bit angry.”
Malfoy relaxes minutely, and Harry feels a strange relief. “All right. Um... thanks,” Malfoy says. The word sounds strange falling from his lips.
,” Draco says, because Potter’s just wrapped his other hand, slick with the tingling lube, around his cock.
He pushes the door open, catching Draco’s hand as they walk outside, and he just barely catches Seb’s voice as the door closes behind them, saying, “Wow, I didn’t know Mr. Potter was gay!”
Mother coddles him today, setting out his favorite foods for breakfast, bangers and scones and poached eggs, speaking carefully of things that don’t matter in an effort to distract him. And he lets her, trying his best to let her know he appreciates all she is doing. He is careful not to let his fear show in front of her, even if he can’t hide from it himself.
After a few moments, Harry forces himself to mentally change the subject. He wipes his mouth with a napkin and asks, “You work with ‘Mione, right?”
,” and then try to short him on the payment for it, but if Draco’s good at one thing it’s getting his way in an argument.
Slowly, Potter reaches down and takes his hand, flipping his wrist back over in the process. “This—” he says, squeezing Draco’s palm, “—isn’t you. Just like my scars aren’t me.” He takes a breath. “You’re the man who makes anonymous donations every year to the orphanage I started—and yes, I noticed. You’re the man who first started making the effort to reach out to people after the war, me and Hermione and Luna and everyone else. And—” He pauses, smiling ruefully. “And you’re the man I look forward to seeing every time I go to a party because I’m too fucking scared to ask you to go on a date with me sometime.”
Harry bites back the retort rising in his chest, and then he has to stifle a laugh too, because he’s just realized that goading Malfoy in this way—without any real heat behind it—is actually somewhat fun. “And here I was thinking you wanted my help.”
“Just, um, figured something out with Charms, see?” Harry says, picking up the closest thing he can reach on his worktable, which happens to be a regular Muggle key from who knows what project.
Harry suddenly understands why Hermione is so concerned and lets out a small bubble of laughter. “God, no, not actually. It’s just, well, easier to explain than going into the whole Veela thing, so.”
Harry curls his fingers into fists and tries to push the wanting away. It doesn’t seem to work, instead growing in desperate pulses in his chest, and finally after an hour of tossing and turning, he gives in, lets himself remember every moment of when they’d kissed, lets himself hope in vain for something more.
Because fuck, this is going to be embarrassing, isn’t it? He’s going to be a drunk, bumbling fool, and Potter’s probably going to be unfairly sexy just like he was this morning, and Draco’s probably going to feel mortified as he watches it happen all over again.
Harry clenches his fingers into fists. “Malfoy—you don’t… you don’t have to do this,” he says, his breath hitching as that slick finger returns, pressing more insistently at his hole.
, watching as he picks up his wand and spells the dildo so it’ll continue rocking inside him, groaning as he adjusts the spell
Harry’s really not sure how to answer that, but he tries his best. “I think it’s okay,” he says slowly. “I like being around you. It’s nice to have company when everything’s going to shite.”
